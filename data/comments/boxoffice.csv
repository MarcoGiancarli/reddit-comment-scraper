To me the first couple trailers were pretty blah and only the last trailer was pretty good. None of them got me anywhere near as excited as the trailers for GotG, and it seemed like these trailers came out later and not as often as Guardians as well. The final film turned out well, so why didn't they push it?"
boxoffice,3e1uhy,DeeBased,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"They may not be planning an Ant-Man franchise, instead just needing a platform to establish him for use in future films such as Civil War."
boxoffice,3e1uhy,therelentlesspace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"honestly, I think Marvel trailers are all pretty generic. The difference is that they usually have a built in audience. You don't have to make a huge trailer for The Avengers.                   The reality is I believe they knew Ant-Man was going to be a bit of a disappointment. They have the same projected numbers that these sites do. Why spend more on advertising and dig a bigger hole to recoup your losses?"
boxoffice,3e1uhy,GoldandBlue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:56 2015 UTC,I think that's because Marvel held back a lot of good scenes and showed only the okay ones in the trailers. That certainly worked for marvel as people weren't expecting it to be as funny as it was and comedy is the biggest factor in its critical acclaim. Marvel knew the jokes were the only things that could make it enjoyable to non fans so they tried not to show them in the trailers.

boxoffice,3e1pay,JakkuScavenger,4,Tue Jul 21 07:33:03 2015 UTC,"Part of the difference could be due to differences accounting for when a film's revenue is realized. Let's use American Sniper as an example. It was released late December 2014 so it is considered a 2014 film. One way of accounting for inflation is to take all of the revenue the movie made and use the 2014 inflation adjustment. Another way would be to take the first week's revenue and use 2014 adjustment and put the rest against 2015's adjustment. Or it could go month by month if desired. The more accurate the inflation adjustment, the more work it will take.  The inflation adjustment is just an approximation anyway. Actual tickets sold would be a more definitive measure of a movie's success albeit at the expense of not capturing the prices of premium tickets like IMAX 3D showings."

Actual tickets sold would be a more definitive measure of a movie's success albeit at the expense of not capturing the prices of premium tickets like IMAX 3D showings.

boxoffice,3e1pay,DaveFincher,3,Tue Jul 21 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, ticket count would definitely need to be taken in context of population.

In fact, the Monday business is the highest for any Hindi film without a national holiday.   Stay tuned, because the second half will witness a few more of such event films ending with Dilwale on December 18th.

Superman, which would be inconceivable 10 years ago.  And Star Wars is breaking a 6-film tradition by moving to the Winter and giving up the race entirely."
boxoffice,3dxwbt,SpongeBad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"Then explain Minions and jurassic world. We've had 4 or 5 billion dollar movies this year so far, and are expecting two more. People are even saying Star Wars will cross 2 billion. People are excited about movies now not sick of them."
boxoffice,3dxwbt,FockerFGAA,0,Mon Jul 20 23:11:21 2015 UTC,"Summer is profitable, but it's not a great time to release if you want your movie to have real legs.  Everything is incredibly front-loaded, and that's been getting worse as time goes on and summers get more crowded.  Audiences only have so much time available.  Winter releases have some time to breathe.  The Star Wars move to winter gives it a genuine shot at the all-time number one slot.  Avatar and Titanic both released at Christmas, and held the top spot (and news cycles) for months thanks in large part to a lack of competition.  Now take the Star Wars brand, and - if the movie is good - you get the potential for a massive mega-blockbuster unlike anything we've seen before."
boxoffice,3dxwbt,entertainman,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think it is still too early to tell. It isn't a failure, but it needs at least 450m worldwide to be a success. That would cover production cost, marketing cost, and give some return. Anything lower than that should make the studio question a sequel."

boxoffice,3dx02t,TheJoshider10,7,Mon Jul 20 08:39:49 2015 UTC,"One site reports FF7 as third, the rest report it as 4th. It seems to be the only film that isnt the same total everywhere. Guessing there is a disputed number from some small market that 1 site doesnt use."
boxoffice,3dx02t,FartingBob,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"It did beat Avengers. I wish all of these box office sources were actually consistent with Furious 7's gross, it's pretty annoying. I'd like to believe it's number 3 worldwide (That's probably the fan in me talking though)."
boxoffice,3dx02t,LostSoulOnAStroll,2,Mon Jul 20 10:17:00 2015 UTC,"Almost all sites put it 8 million behind the avengers, only one site has it beating the avengers. I'm more inclined to believe it hasn't beaten the avengers."

I should emphasize that I've only passively looked at Japanese box office. Having said that - didn't AoU open to $6M in Japan earlier this year? If we consider that number, IO's opening seems like a decent start.  Edit - I see sources claiming that the number is indeed lower than expectations. Hopefully it'll have the legs to sustain for a few weeks!"
boxoffice,3dwfq8,NeilPoonHandler,22,Mon Jul 20 02:34:22 2015 UTC,"Ant Man doesn't show Marvel's limitation at all. Ant-Man's a hard sell, even if he can be entertaining, and it was a solid movie. I mean, to describe the Guardians you say: ""A cocky pilot, a green badass babe, a violent raccoon, a tree that beats the shit out of people, and a guy called the Destroyer fight their way across the galaxy."" For Ant-Man, ""A former thief can get really small and talk to ants."" I think it'll do better, once people see that it actually delivered pretty well, some of the most inventive action sequences.  People are portraying Ant Man as failure for God knows what reason. It did pretty fucking good considering it split the ballot in both the family film department (Minions) as well as the comedy department (Trainwreck). I hope it does well in the long run, but there are some heavier hitters about to come out. It's also important to note that 'Ant-Man' had the lowest budget than any of the MCU films this far. I wish this came out in the Guardians slot, like 2 or 3 weeks out, when there's no competition."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,swellipop,9,Mon Jul 20 09:39:11 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% and although it had a modest opening I predict that a sequel will see a nice bump akin to captain America 1 and 2, especially after ant mans appearance in civil war"
boxoffice,3dwfq8,dopest_dope,3,Mon Jul 20 10:27:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I kind of get what the article is saying although it is way more negative than it needs to be in what some could see as a glass half full situation.  A debut at 58 million isn't great for Marvel, but at the same time it's a movie featuring an unknown character and it still debuted at #1. It also picked up 56 million overseas as well. So as Marvel digs deeper in to its archive it can rest easy knowing that it's going to be able to make financially successful films.  Not every character is going to produce a juggernaut film, but I think Marvel already knew that.  On top of that, it was a good movie which is key. I bet a sequel would do well."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,matty25,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:59 2015 UTC,Ant Man doesn't show Marvel's limitation at all   Well it does. The article is just saying that the Marvel brand ALONE won't get you a $100 million opening weekend.
boxoffice,3dwfq8,Zeno84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:41 2015 UTC,"Every other movie in phase 2 was a sequel except for guardians. So, there was a natural hype among the people who saw the avengers.   In the case of guardians, Marvel got lucky. Guardians was released in a week with no competition and that summer was very dry. People were longing for a good film. This year we already have 3 movies crossing over a billion. The 4th film predicted to do that was released one week before Ant Man. Again, as I said in my previous comment, it split the ballot both in the family department (minions) and comedy department (trainwreck) along with competing against Jurassic and Inside out. If all these big movies were not competing against Ant Man, as was the case with guardians, Ant Man would have grossed atleast 80M. The difference between Guardians and Ant Man is competition and concept.  Edit: added 'and concept' to the last line."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,swellipop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:41 2015 UTC,"The only difference between Guardians and Ant Man is competition.   Well, there's quality and the ensemble cast. Guardians was better received by critics. And a better concept for Guardians, really.  So it's not just competition."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,Zeno84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:33:00 2015 UTC,"Ant Man has also received praise from both critics and general audiences. Any other studio would have failed, if they had released Ant Man. The real reason Ant Man has earned lesser than other Marvel Movie is because it was opened against a really stiff competition, although I am not declining the fact that it's concept is also silly but the fact that it became #1 even with all that shows the power of Marvel Brand, not limitation."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,swellipop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:15 2015 UTC,But you can see what they mean when they say limitation. They're just trying to say it's not all-powerful.
boxoffice,3dwfq8,Zeno84,5,Tue Jul 21 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man's opening weekend gross of $58 million is actually the lowest among all MCU films, after adjusting for ticket price inflation. And if you discount for the extra dollars spent for 3-D screenings, Ant-Man's gross would actually be much lower than that.   On the one hand, it is still a success considering that every other MCU film ahead of it featured well-established and marketable super heroes. On the other hand, it is a disappointment in that it couldn't at least beat the opening weekend for The Incredible Hulk, which wasn't even a decent film.    There is the chance that strong word of mouth will push Ant-Man up the rankings among MCU films, in terms of total gross, in the coming weeks."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,darkest_knight8,3,Mon Jul 20 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting to see if the drop-off percentage for Ant-Man is similar to Guardians, seeing as they both share the 'wait and see how other audience members liked it' approach of moviegoers watching these flicks."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,Gre3kgeek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:07 2015 UTC,Seriously this movie's run could be far from over. I'd rather wait at least another week and a half to proclaim its success or failure.

boxoffice,3dwfq8,Mybrainmelts,9,Mon Jul 20 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"""All these movies will beget an endless array of spinoffs, prequels and crossover films, testing enthusiasm for the genre. It’s a slate that has the Comic-Con crowd in a state of euphoria, but the rest of the public, not versed in the fruits of Stan Lee’s off-days, may need convincing.""  What goes up, must come down. The genre still looks strong based on Suicide Squad and BatmanXSuperman trailers, but this article hits the nail on the head. Ant-Man is under-performing, because it didn't connect with the general population. If the superhero comic genre wants to continue to excel, it has to find a way to make its product appealing to all types of people. I get the feeling the genre is contracting, and I don't think studios are dynamic enough to stop it. I think it will be a solid subgenre for a long long time, but I think these types of films will slowly stop being wide audience mass appeal blockbusters.  Once Fantastic Four bombs in a couple of weeks, the insiders are going to start sweating a bit. That will be two big comic book movies that failed to ignite in a row. They got some good ones coming next year, but they may start pulling back some films set to be released later in 2016 and in 2017."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,stoicblunder,11,Mon Jul 20 05:18:39 2015 UTC,"At least for me, it started with Avengers 2. I just felt it was more of the same. All Marvel movies absolutely ""taste the same"" and it's getting stale.   I am definitely one audience member who wouldn't mind if studios start cutting back on superhero films and only release them once a year. Maybe even once every two years.   I'm excited that the future DC movies are doing a different take on the genre because It's needed. Badly."
boxoffice,3dwfq8,elmatador12,9,Mon Jul 20 06:35:31 2015 UTC,Yeah but this is /r/boxoffice and you still saw it. :)  Avengers 2 pulled in about 1.4 billion worldwide. I don't know if that's really an indication that the genre is waning.
boxoffice,3dwfq8,matty25,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"Haha. Very true. However, I can't see myself seeing any Marvel movie in the theatre anytime soon. Avengers 2 was probably it for me.

boxoffice,3dwfq8,elmatador12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I hear ya.   There is definitely a little bit of overload from comic book movies right now. We haven't really seen it at the box office yet but it's something that is brewing.
boxoffice,3dwfq8,matty25,6,Mon Jul 20 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Avengers 2 was a disappointment. But Cap America Winter Soldier has me still excited for Civil War.

boxoffice,3duayp,NeilPoonHandler,52,Sun Jul 19 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is satisfactory for Ant-Man, considering it's competition and how hard Marvel had to work to get people on board with the concept of him. Good buzz around it too."
boxoffice,3duayp,TheChipmunkSeesAll,30,Sun Jul 19 15:46:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed - it's a pretty solid opening for Ant-Man. It had an uphill baffle to climb because the concept seemed silly to many moviegoers. But with the good reviews (80% Rotten Tomatoes score and excellent word-of mouth (it received an A Cinemascore rating), I'm hoping it will have solid legs in the weeks ahead."
boxoffice,3duayp,jadamsmash,17,Sun Jul 19 15:48:40 2015 UTC,I'd say it hits 150 domestic and 400 ww which would be great for this type of movie.

boxoffice,3duayp,Mybrainmelts,6,Sun Jul 19 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"Competition is stiff for Antman unfortunately. Paper Towns, Pixels, Vacation, and Mission Impossible could all open to more than 30M (could even be considerably higher for PT and MI), and that's all by the end of July."
boxoffice,3duayp,FockerFGAA,4,Sun Jul 19 18:37:55 2015 UTC,It will be close. It's opening is in between Captain America and Hulk. Based on their results it would put Ant Man at almost exactly 150m but anything could change that. I don't know a lot of people who want to go see it still and more family friendly movies come out this next week. If it drops 60% next weekend it will probably hit around 140m.
boxoffice,3duayp,gustave154,3,Sun Jul 19 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"It should hit 160 million Domestic, but the upcoming weeks are gonna be tough. Pixels next week, MI 3 week after, then Fantastic 4 week after, Then UNCLE. It's gonna be a trudge to 160, but it has good reviews and great Cinema Score."
boxoffice,3duayp,swellipop,3,Sun Jul 19 20:03:14 2015 UTC,Marvel should be more concerned with the Worldwide as that will make it a profitable film.
boxoffice,3duayp,stoicblunder,11,Sun Jul 19 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"I watched Ant Man today and while enjoyable, I feel the people giving it rave reviews on reddit are just trying to validate why they thought it would be so successful. It is regularly being rated lower than guardians and a few other marvel movies.   With family friendly competition coming up there is no reason why it will perform better then the typical movie going forward. I'm going to predict it will end it's run at about 145m domestic."

boxoffice,3duayp,YouTypeTooSlow,6,Sun Jul 19 21:25:19 2015 UTC,"I think Ant Man suffered from a major lack of positive pre release buzz. That is why the general population (non-nerd) did not show up. An event at Comic Con could have started a buzz that would spread through mass media and get a normal person interested in seeing the movie on OW. Maybe more than that, it's lack of appearance at Comic-con gave all the attention to other movies coming out next year: Suicide Squad, BMvSuperman, Deadpool. The trailers for those set off a huge amount of online buzz that extended way beyond the normal nerd/fanboy crowd. I knew something was off when more people were talking about Margot Robbie than Ant-Man the week before its release."

Star Wars pulls almost everyone since people have grown up with it since the 70s, Tarantino does not.  Also Hateful 8 might be released in a more limited way and expand into more theaters. This way reviews and word of mouth can advertise the movie as it expands and as Star Wars starts to make less money every week."

There are going to be many people who won't want to see Star Wars. There are also going to be people who will see Star Wars and then want to see something else later. I mean, Jurassic World was breaking records. Records that Star Wars is not going to break because of the time of year it'll be released in. Yet, in Jurassic's record breaking second week, Inside Out came to break records. Spy continued to shine. San Andreas wasn't hurt.  Mark my words, even with Star Wars stealing glory, Joy will do very will in its own right.

At the end, Interstellar can be considered a success due to the risk they took vs the returns at BO.  Similarly, Marvel took a risk with Ant-Man and it seems that more people are loving it. Furthermore, the movie will likely stay within the top 20 OW for 2015 as well. So when the article says:   Ant-Man‘s super ability to enlarge isn’t working so well at the box office.

You can see glimpses of Rudd's potential with the character buried in one of the least enjoyable Marvel films I've ever seen. Every other performance is agonizingly one-note, gags rarely get laughs, the villain is one of the flimsiest Marvel's come out with (the ""Pym particles make you crazy"" bit smacks of a re-write and makes no sense given how Cross never shrinks until after Hope claims he's going mad). Lang's group of friends is an embarrassing collection of racial stereotypes, with the faintest glimmer of Wright's original style buried deep in bland personalityless concrete.  It tried to be a heist film that couldn't commit enough to make itself anything more than the most generic superhero story imaginable.  I'm interested in seeing Rudd continue the character in future films, but Ant-Man was a tremendous disappointment, and I kept my expectations ground-low."
boxoffice,3dt1od,thor12345678910,24,Sun Jul 19 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"In order for $300 million to happen, I believe every person who sees a movie that weekend, must see only Star Wars.  Oh, and since it's around Christmas, every fanboy will have to convince 10 people to ditch their plans and see the movie with them.    It seems no matter how many times this topic comes up, it's like a complete mystery to fanboys why Star Wars won't make 300 million in a weekend.    As a reference point, the weekend Jurassic World opened, all the movies combined made $266 million.  So if Star Wars made 300 million, my exaggeration before would almost have to come true."
boxoffice,3dt1od,ghettothf,7,Sun Jul 19 07:05:12 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be hard to do the math if there is enough data around. The most flexibility is going to come from adding extra shows which is going to depend partly on how long the run time is. Multiplexes can allocate more screens to the movie but that's somewhat factored in already. I think the biggest factor is that, since it's not a summer release, it's going to be harder to get as many extra viewers to daytime shows due to school being in session. Plus, people are busy right before Christmas and winter weather is never going to work in your favor.  I am pretty sure a $300 million opening is theoretically possible but I can't see the entire movie theater industry allocating enough screens to let it.  Edit: I looked it up and there are ""39,056 indoor screens in 5,317 sites.  According to the /u/best_in_life's comment, there was an estimate which gave a max range of $250-270 million but that is based on 4500. (Incidentally, according to BOM the widest opening was for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 with 4,375 theaters.) But if we apply the same math but for every (indoor) theater in the US then $300 million is easily reachable. And that is without any extraordinary amount of screenings like running the theater around the clock or adding extra screens.  TL;DR $300 million is well within the capacity of the US. That doesn't mean it's going to happen but SW7 is at least not limited by physical infrastructure though there might be contractual obligations or other reasons preventing SW7 from taking over more screens in a theater."
boxoffice,3dt1od,department4c,2,Sun Jul 19 04:50:10 2015 UTC,"SW7 is at least not limited by physical infrastructure though there might be contractual obligations or other reasons preventing SW7 from taking over more screens in a theater.   Well, yes. But even if an exception was made, and all the available screens in North America is allocated to one movie, the hype would have to be beyond astronomical to get to $300M. That would mean ~37 million people would watch a movie in theaters in this digital age within the first three days, while a JW could only bring in ~26M people to theaters.  All I'm getting to is, a lot is possible if we speak purely in theory -- we might even reach 1B WW OW if every single screen in the world is allocated to one movie. Doesn't mean it can translate to reality."
boxoffice,3dt1od,best_in_life,4,Sun Jul 19 07:19:18 2015 UTC,"Understood. That's why I qualified the statement like I did. And also why I said "" I can't see the entire movie theater industry allocating enough screens to let it.""  I was only speaking to OP's question of ""Can our infrastructures support this scale of movie viewing?""  I agree that a lot is possible only in theory. And OP's question is possible.  If on the other hand OP asked ""Could we see a billion dollar domestic opening weekend?"" then we would have to dig a lot deeper to see if it's even possible with all theaters running all screens 24 hours a day for the full weekend and we might find out that it simply isn't possible for a movie of any reasonable length."

Can we witness a 300 million dollars opening weekend with Star Wars.   Short answer -- no.   I realize anything can happen at the box office, like we saw with JW. But let's see if a movie can break $220M, or $250M before we even think about 300M opening weekend.   Can our infrastructures support this scale of movie viewing?   There was a thread recently, where someone was curious to know the ceiling in terms of opening weekends. Found it! As you can see, the consensus was $250-270M."
boxoffice,3dt1od,best_in_life,4,Sun Jul 19 06:03:58 2015 UTC,"To back up your point. The single day record is $91m (Final Harry Potter). The second best is $84m (Avengers 2). Both were opening days (friday) and both dropped hugely on saturday and sunday from their friday totals (HP dropped over half from friday to saturday).  For a film to break $100m in any single day would be a huge achievement. For it to average $100m a day for 3 days while following a similar drop to the current best opening weekends (JW dropped just 15 and 18% each day over the weekend, a brilliant result and pretty much a best case scenario) it would have to open to over $115m and then have the best hold on saturday and sunday. It's saturday would also be over $100m and it's sunday would be over $80m. The current best sunday is JW at $57m."

Everyone remembers the quality of e1, e2, & e3.   The other factor is the state of the economy and how tight people are for money. If you're barely scraping by, and have to pick between seeing star wars vs buying presents for your kids, you might say, well, hopefully i get a christmas / new year bonus, and i'll beat the crowds and see star wars later. if you're unemployed and don't have anything better to do but kill time at the movie theater and spend your funemployment money, then you might see star wars multiple times before the end of the year.    people talk about the past 'lining up for star wars' - every star wars film to date (1-6) was released in may. people won't line up to watch movies in the middle of the winter, because even if it isn't snowing, it is too damn cold.

There's are hardly any competition for months and if you release a film that huge around that time of year, I'm convinced it will end up being better in the long run than a summer release. The top 2 highest grossing films came in December.  Hardly anyone releases anything very big in January or Februrary so when a huge film like Star Wars comes along, it has weeks to rake in cash whereas a movie released in summer has to deal with another blockbuster almost every week."

I'm expecting Jurassic to lose a lot of theaters over the next three weeks, and that will make it very difficult to surpass Titanic. It's definitely within shot of doing it, but it's going to have to put up one hell of a fight. Number three all time (as it will pass The Avengers next week) still ain't bad, though!  The fact that we are in its sixth week of release and it's still in over 3,000 theaters is absolutely incredible! We are one of the theaters, and it looks like we might have it for a seventh week at least! While our schedule for next week has yet to be released, I do see that on Thursday, we have three premieres (Pixels, Paper Towns, and Southpaw), but Jurassic is still playing alongside them on Thursday night. (The Gallows, Inside Out, and Self/Less are not, however. That doesn't mean we're losing IO, though as it only has morning showings right now anyway.) With 7 weeks with our theater, it's verging on being one of the longest running movies in our theater! Guardians was with us for around 10-12 weeks and Frozen we had up through its DVD release, and those are the only two I can think of that we had longer."

Matching Avengers for the remainder of its run would put Jurassic World into the number 2 slot, but there's not a lot of margin to spare...  Getting deeper into the numbers: Jurassic World beat Avengers in weeks 1, 2 and 3 of its release.  Avengers beat Jurassic World in weeks 4 and 5.  That would be momentum in the wrong direction.  We also have three days of week 6 now to analyze, and it's a tie between Avengers ($11.25M) and JW (estimated $11.4M).  Jurassic World has had stronger weekdays than Avengers in past weeks, but it's worth noting that that trend leveled a bit in week 5 (which was first week of June for Avengers -- lots of schools getting out), and may be non-existent in week 6 (second week of June for Avengers).  All of which is a very long winded way to say that it looks like it'll be a real close race for the #2 slot domestically."
boxoffice,3drg6z,realuberpie,2,Sun Jul 19 22:30:58 2015 UTC,Yeah this is what I was saying. Weekdays are helping JW a lot against the Avengers comparision. I think the rest of the weekdays will continue to be higher than the avengers. This week also showed us that JW can still match Avengers weekends also. People say that upcoming movies will kill off JW but look at the Avengers. It was also bombarded by new wide releases that targeted similar audiences but it still did it. They both also have very similar word of mouth strength and Avenegrs also has had a holiday for its 6th weekends Sunday which will be JW's next week which will make it fall behind a bit( this might be a bit confusing). So this will make it even closer and the margin for error will be less than $2 mil. But if it gets that close Universal will grind the movie in theaters forever to get that money
boxoffice,3drg6z,best_in_life,2,Sun Jul 19 22:42:38 2015 UTC,is this 600 million just US domestic or worldwide included
boxoffice,3drg6z,realuberpie,4,Sun Jul 19 05:02:56 2015 UTC,Domestic. The movie will likely surpass (or may has already) 1.5B by the end of the weekend worldwide.
boxoffice,3drg6z,best_in_life,2,Sun Jul 19 05:19:14 2015 UTC,and does the official box office count only domestic or not
boxoffice,3drg6z,realuberpie,2,Sun Jul 19 05:32:59 2015 UTC,"That includes domestic + overseas.  So for JW, the domestic estimate at the end of the weekend is ~$610M and overseas will be ~$900M -- giving a worldwide total of ~1.51B."
boxoffice,3drg6z,best_in_life,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:57:30 2015 UTC,that is excellent I'm so proud of bae succeeding in the world after all this time and these shitty sequels  how much did the number 1 grossing movie (I wanna say… Avatar?) make?  And is there even a chance of JW winning?
boxoffice,3drg6z,realuberpie,3,Sun Jul 19 08:02:52 2015 UTC,"Here is the list of highest grossing movies worldwide. JW won't be overtaking Avatar or Titanic, but the movie will definitely make the top 3. I have seen many estimates putting the final worldwide total at ~1.6B+.  Just to answer that last question -- JW has already won. It's a HUGE victory for the team that worked on it. So we don't have to worry about the movie overtaking Avatar or Titanic at this point."

boxoffice,3dqpes,MeteoricHorizons,7,Sat Jul 18 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised. Very mixed reviews, which generally wouldn't be THAT big of a problem for a kid's film, but Inside Out is still around, and it's one of the best reviewed films of the summer. Minions is still ahead of Inside Out at the theater I work at, but not by much. Inside Out is holding incredibly well."
boxoffice,3dqpes,tcatron565,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:26:51 2015 UTC,it's also in line with DM2's drop (and the 2 of them have been neck and neck for their daily totals). I was wondering why everyone had Minions 2nd weekend total so high when history clearly suggested that it would be in the range that it is in now.
boxoffice,3dqpes,jburd22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"Just because DM2 fell that hard doesn't guarantee Minions to. In fact, because of how extremely marketable the little yellow guys are and by just how much more hype surrounded this than DM2, by all means, Minions should not have fallen as hard as DM2. It's just that reviews just haven't been that good for Minions, and with the incredible reviews for the still popular Inside Out, that made a larger dent than what should have been a less steep drop."
boxoffice,3dqpes,tcatron565,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:27:17 2015 UTC,"Possibly some people looked at Home and saw that, whilst it was poorly reviewed, it's second weekend drop was ~43%. Of course that meant ignoring DM2's drop, as well as the fact that minions was clearly immensely front loaded,  whilst Hone only made ~$43m in its opening weekend."
boxoffice,3dqpes,Gamb1993,57,Sun Jul 19 08:54:31 2015 UTC,"a film based on one of the most obscure comic book heroes in the Marvel Universe   Oh honey, no. You have no idea how deep this roster goes. When Ikaris is fighting Deviants on screen then talk to me about obscure."
boxoffice,3dqpes,ribblesquat,18,Sat Jul 18 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"For those not aware, the original Avengers lineup was Ant-Man, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and the Wasp.  Guardians of the Galaxy are definitely more obscure."

That's a huge drop, I mean it was obviously going to drop with Ant-Man biting into it, but still that's a massive hit.  Kind of a shame about Ant-Man, I hope the estimate for it is wrong because it's a great film.  EDIT: Added words."
boxoffice,3dqpes,Gamb1993,7,Sat Jul 18 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"You're kidding right? That is a huge drop! It'll still be a success, but from 115 million to 39 million is crazy!"

boxoffice,3dqpes,TheCapedGamer,13,Sat Jul 18 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"So, I predicted Trainwreck to be a bomb. I'm eating my words now and admitting I was completely wrong.  I work in the box office at my local Regal, and we had two Trainwreck screnings for 8 o'clock. We sold out of one at 6:40, and the next at 7:10. It was a madhouse in the box office from 7:10 to 8, as people were changing plans and freaking out that the film had sold out. If we had another print and added ANOTHER 8'oclock, we definitely would have sold it out. This film is huge in the city I live in.  Anyway, this could really take off and be a hit. I haven't talked to anyone who didn't like it yet.  Ant-Man was super slow all night. We maybe sold 400 tickets to it through five showtimes all night. That's not so hot for a Marvel movie's opening night."
boxoffice,3dqpes,TyrannosaurusHives,6,Sat Jul 18 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Reporting the same here at our Wehrenberg. Trainwreck has yet to sell out, but it's been bringing in very high numbers, beating our Ant-Man showings consistently, which has been surprisingly quiet for a bigger summer release. The 3D version is doing abysmally. Minions 3D is beating it. We only have one showing of Jurassic World in 3D, so that's aiding its one showing to pull in higher numbers, but it's single showing pulls in more people than any of Ant-Man's 3D showings.  Edit: Our 8:50 showing of Trainwreck tonight got moved to our largest auditorium, kicking Ant-Man down to our second and fourth largest auditoriums (2 showings in the same round were already scheduled for the two largest auditoriums originally)."

boxoffice,3dqpes,poland626,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:16:00 2015 UTC,their stupidity of not using something very simple like fandango always surprises me   It's just that Fandango charges a service fee.
boxoffice,3dqpes,Daniel16399,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:42 2015 UTC,"the service fee's like, $2. I'd spend that $2 to get a better evening out then disappointment.  I also get that amc stubs card that's like, only $10 for a whole year. Every 100 i spend i get 10 bucks back and they always remove the fandango service fee. the card pays for itself."
boxoffice,3dqpes,poland626,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"the service fee's like, $2   That's per ticket. It adds up for a family."
boxoffice,3dqpes,Daniel16399,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:04:19 2015 UTC,I understand. that's why i mentioned the stubs card that removes that fee. I go to the theater enough in a year for that $10 card fee to pay itself. it should be better advertised imo because it's great.
boxoffice,3dqpes,poland626,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but no other theater chain has something like that.   And the person who avoids Fandango fees will probably avoid paying $12 for a membership as well.   I have one and have only actually paid once for it. I use the accumulated credit to renew it when the card goes on sale for $8.   Did you get the email saying that Stubs members get half-price tickets on Tuesdays now?"
boxoffice,3dqpes,Daniel16399,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:46:37 2015 UTC,On Tuesday it's half price?  That explains a few things. I understand amc isn't everywhere which sucks.
boxoffice,3dqpes,poland626,9,Tue Jul 21 23:56:12 2015 UTC,Looks like Inside out will win the Animated film for the year. I don't see Minions getting to $330m at this Rate
boxoffice,3dqpes,Shruth1,5,Sat Jul 18 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, that drop for Minions was huge. But it should still crawl past $300M, right? I mean Man of Steel made 181M+ in 8 days as well and eventually made 291M+. Minions will likely hold better (this weekend & beyond) when compared to MoS, which should help it get past the 300M mark (or so I believe)."

boxoffice,3dqpes,SethR0gen,10,Sat Jul 18 19:36:13 2015 UTC,I took my nine year old daughter because she thought it looked hilarious and about 20-25 minutes in I found myself worrying that it was a lot more serious than trailers made it seem. All in all - she LOVED it. She thought it was funny and loved the action.   I would say it's pretty even split but it's both funny and action packed.   Can't miss.
boxoffice,3dqpes,Danton87,2,Sat Jul 18 19:56:33 2015 UTC,So should I expect something like Guardians of the Galaxy then?
boxoffice,3dqpes,NeighborStrategy,4,Sun Jul 19 01:09:15 2015 UTC,No. Much more small scale compared to guardians. (No pun or jokes intended there). Its got more humor too
boxoffice,3dqpes,poland626,2,Sun Jul 19 04:17:39 2015 UTC,"More action for sure. It's slow to build, so not good for kids IMO. It's got less for kids than Guardians of the Galaxy - the anamorphic creatures in it are less kid friendly."
boxoffice,3dqpes,uni-twit,6,Sun Jul 19 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"If Ant Man made 22M on Friday, it should make over 65 millions on the weekend considering that it will only gain from Positive Word, why does the website says that it will top at mid 50s ?"
boxoffice,3dqpes,swellipop,14,Sat Jul 18 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"I think many box observers (including Variety) are predicting it to end up in the mid-to-late 50's, since Marvel movies in the past have been traditionally frontloaded (which means it drops on Saturday). However, I'm hoping that this movie surprises and has a small increase on Saturday, a la Thor: The Dark World. The film has excellent word of mouth and good reviews after all (it has an A Cinemascore rating and is at 80% on Rotten Tomatoes)."
boxoffice,3dqpes,NeilPoonHandler,13,Sat Jul 18 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, considering Ant Man has surprised many people with how good it is and this year's box office is full of surprises, Ant Man may surprise us with Box Office too."
boxoffice,3dqpes,swellipop,3,Sat Jul 18 16:38:06 2015 UTC,Based on numbers. I wrote the article. I took the percentage of opening days for a few other Marvel films and averaged it out. It was pretty front loaded on Thirsday night so topping $60M seems almost out of the question.
boxoffice,3dqpes,capdeporc2005,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"If it fails to reach 60 this weekend, what do you think is a good bet for the final tally?"
boxoffice,3dqpes,capdeporc2005,3,Sat Jul 18 17:57:34 2015 UTC,"Well, word of mouth is a big factor but it doesn't seem to have the lasting appeal of something like Guardians. Pixels may take a chunk out of it next weekend, followed by MI5 after that but I would say $130-$140. Somewhere in that range."
boxoffice,3dqpes,Pripat99,2,Sat Jul 18 18:04:15 2015 UTC,So definitely on the lower side for a Marvel movie.
boxoffice,3dqpes,AMCAmazing,3,Sat Jul 18 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"Yep. The Incredible Hulk (current lowest) made $152M adjusted, so this could take that place."
boxoffice,3dqpes,idiotdidntdoit,9,Sat Jul 18 20:41:02 2015 UTC,I'd say that is quite doubtful - I'm still feeling pretty good about taking the over on it finishing with $180 million domestic when all is said and done. This has very strong word of mouth and is going to have fewer drops than other movies that are dogged by poor critical reviews and bad audience reaction.
boxoffice,3dqpes,AMCAmazing,2,Sat Jul 18 22:38:37 2015 UTC,I work for AMC theaters and we have been selling out Trainwreck like crazy and Ant-Man as been getting like 30 per show time.

boxoffice,3dovc8,dragonsky,13,Sat Jul 18 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"I had to look at their biggest years on mojo, and that $1.433B from 2013 is getting crushed this year; if Straight Outta Compton and Steve jobs end up doing well, they should crack $2B for the year. And as long as Minions overtakes Despicable Me 2, Universal will have 3 movies in the top 25 all time in terms of WW collections.  Quick question to the real experts: Amongst the years mentioned on mojo, I see that Warner Bros ended 2009 with a market share of 19.8 (highest since 2000). Does Universal stand a realistic chance to beat that number this year? Sure Disney with SW:FA will go out with a bang, but the movie only has ~2 weeks in 2015.  EDIT - If you look at the future releases for Universal, 2016 will bring Untitled Blumhouse Horror 2, Ride Along 2, Neighbors 2, The Purge 3, Ouija 2 AND Untitled Next Bourne Chapter! Yes a new Bourne movie sound fun, but that's a lot of sequels!"
boxoffice,3dovc8,best_in_life,8,Sat Jul 18 03:37:29 2015 UTC,Landmark year for Universal. They made a billion this summer alone.

boxoffice,3dovc8,best_in_life,3,Sat Jul 18 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Does Universal stand a realistic chance to beat that number this year?    It's difficult to say, they have quite a lot movies to come out this year, but most of them don't seem like potential blockbusters. Maybe Everest, and Steve Jobs have some chance of adding a little more money for them. Let's look at what major releases other studios have:   Disney has a Spielberg movie, one more Pixar movie and Star Wars. Warner has The Man from UNCLE, Pan, Creed, and a few smaller releases. Fox has Paper Towns, The Fantastic Four, Maze Runner 2, The Martian, and a few smaller releases. Paramount still has Mission Impossible, Paranormal Activity, and Rings. Sony has Pixels, Hotel Transylvania and James Bong. Although not a major studio, Lionsgate is bound to get quite some market share from The Hunger Games.   Overall, I don't think Universal will hold on to that market share. It's not even guaranteed to win the year yet!  Edit: Some other thing to take into consideration. 2015 is definitely shaping up to be the biggest year. It's currently 8.5% ahead of last year and 2.1% ahead of the current biggest year - 2013. If this keeps up, 2015 is looking to end up with $11.1-$11.5 billion. For Universal to have more than 19.8% share of that it need to end the year with at least $2.2-2.27 billion. Or it needs to make $600-700 million more."
boxoffice,3dovc8,JakkuScavenger,3,Sat Jul 18 18:20:47 2015 UTC,James Bong is a movie I'd see.
boxoffice,3dovc8,Shaq_is_our_Savior,2,Sat Jul 18 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"Totally forgot about the Pixar movie -- it's not every year where Pixar has 2 releases!

If SW:FA comes even 20% below JW's opening weekend ($160M+), that should be considered a great start because movies released during the December holidays end up with better holds into January (and if it's an extremely well made product -- into February)."

boxoffice,3dnd7u,Fennrarr,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"The Star Wars film series have always been a juggernaut at the domestic box office, even when it doesn't deliver in terms of quality. The series has an average gross of $675 million, when only counting the original theatrical runs of each film in the series. The average lifetime gross (includes re-releases) of the series is $776 million. Obviously, these figures tells us that Star Wars is the biggest film series in the history of cinema.   These figures also gives us an idea of what a future entry in the series has the potential to pull in. I wouldn't be surprised if it tops $800 million, surpassing Avatar along the way. It will definitely be the number one movie this year. It will not be the number one film of all time, after adjusting for inflation (Gone with the Wind's $1.64 billion is highly unlikely). I think it will be interesting to see if it surpasses Avatar. My guess is that it will."

Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings and Hobbit series each grossed an average of 970m per.  I realize that this doesn't account for inflation, but their are other Box Office Franchise Giants that provide heavy competition for Star Wars.   Edit: Point being using superlatives like biggest and obviously will cripple an argument if there are any flaws into the logic. A la not mentioning Star Wars's inflation rates but still crowning it as the biggest.   Also SpiderMan, Transformers, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jurassic Park, and Hunger Games all have higher per movie grosses than Star Wars."

The figures that I provided does not include what those films earned overseas. Domestically, Star Wars is the most successful film franchise; none of those other film series you mentioned have a higher average domestic gross.   Secondly, why would mentioning that the figures I used are adjusted for ticket price inflation diminish the argument I was trying to make? For the purposes of historical comparison, that's the logical thing to do, unless you want to end up comparing apples to oranges."

Fox Animation Studios was an American animation production company  and was a division of 20th Century Fox Animation. Only one of its two theatrical releases, Anastasia (1997), found critical and box-office success. Its other theatrical release Titan A.E. (2000) got mixed reviews and was a costly flop. The film ended up grossing a mere $36,754,634 worldwide ($22,753,426 in the United States and Canada, and $14,001,208 in international markets). The film's budget is estimated at between $75 million and $90 million. According to Chris Meledandri, the supervisor of the film, Titan A.E. lost $100 million for 20th Century Fox. Almost a year before Titan A.E., 20th Century Fox laid off 300 of the 380 people who worked at the Phoenix studio in order to ""make films more efficiently"" and on June 27, 2000, the studio was shut down."

boxoffice,3dj28f,stoicblunder,24,Thu Jul 16 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"Break even is never calculated based on the domestic total alone. At a 130 million budget a domestic total around 160 would be enough to avoid disappointment.   The real game here is in how much the film can do over seas. Given marvels track record in China, and the fact that it's a market that reacts loyally to established brands, I'd say it has a good chance of pushing 300 million internationally.   A total over 400 million will be considered a success and will likely spawn a sequel. Personally I think it will do 450 +, based on early reactions to the film.   It should also be taken into account that this isn't simply an action movie Disney is releasing. It's a character based film which will have hundreds of promotional tie ins, a huge assortment of merchandise and establish a character that can be placed in its expanding universe.   The buzz has been bad but I will be shocked if this film doesn't turn a healthy profit."
boxoffice,3dj28f,asheraze,24,Thu Jul 16 18:19:26 2015 UTC,Bad buzz?? It has a higher percentage on RT than age of ultron (77% vs 74%)
boxoffice,3dj28f,GranatMorfar,6,Thu Jul 16 18:24:28 2015 UTC,I meant box office buzz.
boxoffice,3dj28f,asheraze,11,Thu Jul 16 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"Even if they essentially break even, I think it's a win for Marvel since Ant-Man is a pretty huge character in the Avengers, so if there is just a single Ant-Man movie introducing the character, he can then be used successfully in the future major films (Civil War, Avengers 3 Parts 1-2).  And Marvel movies do well on BluRay, and Ant-Man will assuredly be packaged in box sets for the whole MCU for a long time. And this is obviously in addition to merchandise, which you mentioned, so I don't see how it's a bad business decision for Marvel/Disney. It might not rake in a profit right away, but in time, it definitely won't be a failure.  Plus, Ant-Man will be competing big time with Minions this weekend, but the following week it just has Pixels, so I don't think the opening weekend numbers are the end-all-be-all for this film. It also figures to be a big draw for the kids on summer break, so it's weekday numbers could be impressive."
boxoffice,3dj28f,3000milestoSpacejam,9,Thu Jul 16 21:05:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and the buzz really isn't even all that bad. Preview audiences seemed to react pretty positively to it, and as of right now, the movie is hovering around 75% on Rotten Tomatoes. Even if this does wind up pulling in numbers similar to the first Thor and Captain America films, it will still be a healthy start for Ant-Man."

boxoffice,3dj28f,asheraze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"The issue with China, is how much do you get back? Studios only get 25% back from Chinese revenue. Rest of foreign market only kicks back 40% as opposed to domestic of 50%. While it looks good on paper to do well in China, the money just doesn't get back to the studio. Winter Solider did 115 million in China, but that only netted 28 million in revenue. So yes worldwide is important, but the take is much different in each region. Total cost on this, including VOD and Digital release, is going well north of 400 million. Probably closer to 450. So I think the true break even here Domestic is 200 then. Not 240."

boxoffice,3dj28f,Pripat99,14,Fri Jul 17 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"I think Ant-Man is more of a test for the future of Marvel movies than anything else, really.   Marvel is aware of two things. First, that they are already pushing moviegoers to the limit by putting two movies (essentially sequels) out a year. And secondly, if they want to continue to expand into new, untested properties and fully explore all sides of the Marvel universe they are going to have to do more than two movies a year.  So I think they are trying to do what Marvel does with comics and try to create sub-universes aimed at more focused, niche audiences. They are testing to see how well 'non-essential' movies do on their own, which is why there has only been a few scant mentions of Avengers and other existing properties.   I think as you say, Ant-Man will perform well above its projected earnings, which will allow Marvel to say that it exceeded expectations. I think that's why they lowballed the BO estimations. I also think (based on my viewing at a press screening) that it will get really good word of mouth and hold it's own for a few weeks longer than expected. It's also really re-watchable. I would compare it to GotG in terms of re-watchability. There are so many jokes that a lot of people will want to go back to catch them all.   I don't think Marvel has written the movie off at all, I think they know that they have a good movie, but they know that it is just a hard movie to sell. Especially after AoU underwhelmed a significant portion of their fanbase. This is a test case for creating stand-alone or side universe type movies.   This is also, comparatively, a very cheap Marvel movie. The budget of 130 mil makes it by far their cheapest movie to date, including the first Cap movie (140 mil) and Incredible Hulk (137 mil). So there is a lot less pressure to blow away the box office."
boxoffice,3dj28f,Pripat99,4,Thu Jul 16 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, Ant-Man is definitely Marvel testing the waters. Just like Daredevil on Netflix, which was a homerun. Here is the thing. Marvel exists to make money, so they need to maximize ROI for every dollar they spend on a film. That to me is where Ant-Man feels like it is going to fall short.   Sure, it has a budget of 130, but P&A is going to hit 80 million for this, at least. It is not like Thor or Winter Soldier. This is a brand new, 2nd tier character that needed a monster worldwide marketing campaign to simply increase awareness. So while actual production budget is cheap, I don't think the actual release is going to be that much cheaper than Winter Solider.  It definitely could have legs due to decent reviews. I suppose I am little more cynical than most. Why Ant-Man? Why not a film centered on a better character? Wright was really the driving force for this film, and he jumped shipped. It is surprising that Marvel followed through with this without Wright, and we will see if that bet plays out over the next couple months."
boxoffice,3dj28f,REACH_ME_DAT_MILK,4,Fri Jul 17 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"Again, you mention Thor and make it seem like he was NOT a brand new, 2nd tier character when his movie came out. He was! His movie was a year prior to Avengers, no one outside of the comic book crowd was all that familiar with him, and yet his movie is regarded as a success that is now on its way to a second sequel. Thor did $65 million OW, about $180 million domestic, and it was four years ago, pre-Avengers.  Have you considered that due to the unmet expectations of AoU that perhaps Marvel has been low balling expectations on Ant-man on purpose and that they feel quite confident that it will not only meet the $65 million projection but beat it, and thus give it a perceived win in the press?"
boxoffice,3dj28f,swellipop,-3,Fri Jul 17 10:28:25 2015 UTC,"Come on, it's Thor. Every human being in Western Civilization knows who Thor is. Sure they may not know the comic book version, but that doesn't really matter. Thor has built-in awareness, interest, and character elements that literally every single person knows. So maybe in MCU he is brand new, but Thor is one of the most recognized myths our civilization so I think it is a little different than something like Ant-Man.  I think Marvel is low-balling because they want to scare off any questions about their MCU business strategy. I don't think they need to do that since Ultron did amazing, and Daredevil was a huge huge win for them on Netlfix. But if Ant-Man does poorly, the analysts will be out like jackals: Is Marvel dead? Are superheroes over? Stupid questions, but people will start picking apart future Marvel projects where as they are getting a complete pass now. Right now, Marvel is Teflon. One big mistake will change that."
boxoffice,3dj28f,tcatron565,5,Fri Jul 17 14:47:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're absolutely wrong about ""every human being in Western civilization knows who Thor is."" I think even today most people if you asked who Thor is would point to the Marvel character rather than the Norse myth, which goes to show how amazing the Marvel effect can be. I won't argue that more people weren't aware of Thor then than are aware of Ant-man now, but I seriously doubt most people are even aware of Valhalla or other Norse mythological concepts.  I agree Marvel is Teflon, and as you know I agree that its perfect record won't stand forever. This is a golden age for them, and all golden ages pass. But I think you're wrong that this is the movie that's going to be the beginning of the end of it (just look at the reviews and listen to people who have already seen it!) and probably in about 12 hours when we have opening weekend estimates we will begin to know which of us is right and which of us is wrong."
boxoffice,3dj28f,baribigbird06,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:44 2015 UTC,"Every human being in Western Civilization knows who Thor is.    Dude, what? Until the movie came out no one knew jack shit about Thor, comic or myth. I grew up with him in the comics but even there he was a B-lister."
boxoffice,3dj28f,baribigbird06,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:00 2015 UTC,"What better character than Ant Man who introduces us to the most important things in Marvel- Pym Particles, Wasp, Hank Pym ? When Wright left, the film was already in production, Paul Rudd and Adam Mckay were re-writing the script in the time they were supposed to be shooting as stated by Corey Stoll. Moreover, Marvel had already announced this in 2013, so there was no way they could back off just 1 year before the release."
boxoffice,3dj28f,baribigbird06,9,Fri Jul 17 08:54:40 2015 UTC,"That seems to be pretty in line with Thor. I realize Thor was in 2011, but Ant-Man just doesn't have the hype past Marvel films have had, mainly due to the character not being such a well-known character outside of the comic book fans. I realize the Guardians weren't either, but Guardians marketed itself very well as ""something different from your average superhero movie."" Ant-Man's marketing strategy is ""hey, look, another Marvel movie!"" So, it's going to pull lower numbers. But, I disagree with you on that Marvel thinks it's a loss or that it was a bad business decision. Worldwide box office numbers have increased exponentially since Thor, and Ant-Man should have no problem grossing at least $400 million worldwide, and that's more than enough for a good profit for everyone involved.  As for the number of screens Ant-Man is opening to, that's actually a pretty typical number. See below for all wide summer releases:   Avengers: Age of Ultron 4,276 The D Train 1,009 Hot Pursuit 3,003 Mad Max: Fury Road 3,702 Pitch Perfect 2 3,473 Poltergeist 3,240 Tomorrowland 3,972 Aloha 2,815 San Andreas 3,777 Entourage 3,108 Insidious: Chapter 3 3,002 Spy 3,711 Jurassic World 4,274 Dope 2,002 Inside Out 3,946 Max 2,855 Ted 2 3,442 Magic Mike XXL 3,355 Terminator: Genisys 3,758 The Gallows 2,720 Minions 4,301 Self/Less 2,353   Avengers: Age of Ultron, Jurassic World, and Minions are the only ones to open in over 4,000 screens this summer, and rightfully so as they all had more hype than any other films this summer. The other two to come close were Tomorrowland and Inside Out, both from Disney. Again, the hype surrounding them (even though Tomorrowland's hype fizzled closer to its release, there was still so much clouded mystery to propel its theater numbers especially given the timing of its release) was higher than what Ant-Man has right now. 3,700 theaters is definitely on the higher end of the list, though. In line with Mad Max: Fury Road and Terminator: Genisys, which also both had good timing to help propel their theater counts (mid-May doesn't have a lot of competition and 4th of July). Ant-Man is hitting against so much competition, so that's going to drag it down a bit. Had it been released next month, it probably would've brought in closer to 3,900 screens. If it does well, it will increase. Many movies usually do increase their second weekends."

boxoffice,3dj28f,Prax150,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"So it looks like it is getting at least 3850 screens. It would need 19k per screen for that.

boxoffice,3dj28f,pottyaboutpotter1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"The lower opening and gross can be attributed to Ant-Man being a lesser known property, or a concept that is too pedestrian to appeal to a wider audience. Much of Guardians' success came from the fact that it was just completely out there and different in feel and tone compared to any Marvel movie or even Comic Book movie that came before. Ant-Man, while different, is still not different enough to make people want to check out the movie on piqued curiosity alone. More than any other previous Marvel movie, Ant-Man will greatly depend on word of mouth to give it long legs."
boxoffice,3dj28f,405freeway,2,Fri Jul 17 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything that has been said in this thread, but I will also say this - the $65 million projections, as I understand them, are not only coming from Marvel but outside publications that have independently done their own research. I also think it's a little crazy to say ""hey, Ant-man doesn't have nearly as many theaters as the three highest grossing movies of the summer, Marvel knows this is going to be a loss!"" At the end of the day, looking at the projections now and having a fairly reasonable budget for this as far as Marvel movies go pretty much ensures in my opinion that this will make money. Will it be a runaway blockbuster? No. Do I think it'll get a sequel? Quite possibly!  I know that you have been looking forward to this weekend as I have to finally see the beginnings of the fruits of each of our respective theories (re: the possibility of Ant-man doing at least $180 million domestic by the end of its run). Good luck to you!"

The only way RG performs poorly will be if the content if rejected; except for the second one in the series, all the other three MI movies were at least decently reviewed.  Also, as I glace through the releases before and after Rogue Nation I don't see other movies hampering it's chances. By the time RG will be out:    JW & IO will be wrapping up. Minions - likely to be in $13M-17M range for that weekend. Ant-Man will also have settled down.    The competition in August could come from Fantastic Four or Straight Outta Compton, but neither of those movies will open big enough to crush RG nor will they provide much direct competition.

boxoffice,3dhula,bill__the__butcher,3,Fri Jul 17 21:50:22 2015 UTC,I'm going to go against the grain here and say yes - as another comment already stated - tickets today are actually worth more than they were in '09. Avatar was massive overseas which is where it pulled 70% of its entire gross which I think would push it just over $2b.   Although the question itself is kind of wonky since Avatar was so intertwined with 3D it's not really Avatar without it.
boxoffice,3dhula,DaveFincher,3,Thu Jul 16 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"If the imax tickets hadn't been like $24 each, I might've gone back to watch it again."
boxoffice,3dhula,scottrmm,3,Fri Jul 17 06:28:25 2015 UTC,No Avatar was so beloved because of its 3D and visuals so there would not be the word of mouth and legs for the films if it had regular price and no 3D. Would have capped at like $1.2B if that
boxoffice,3dhula,Shruth1,6,Thu Jul 16 12:05:39 2015 UTC,"OP just asked if it were cheaper, not if it were in 2D. Important distinction."
boxoffice,3dhula,JonPaula,-4,Thu Jul 16 16:53:31 2015 UTC,No. Part of the appeal was seeing one of the first true 3D movie experiences on such a grand scale. Take away the visuals and it's a mediocre action movie. It would have still made a lot of money but it definitely wouldn't have broken all those records.
boxoffice,3dhula,Prax150,6,Thu Jul 16 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"OP didn't say to take away the visuals or 3D, though... just its inflated price-point."
boxoffice,3dhula,JonPaula,-4,Thu Jul 16 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"But the only reason prices were inflated were because of the 3D, and the main reason people went to see it was because of the novelty of the technology. If OP is saying would people go see it if it was exactly the same but cost less, that's just a nonsense argument..."
boxoffice,3dhula,Prax150,4,Thu Jul 16 18:54:18 2015 UTC,"It's not a ""nonsense argument"", it is the entire foundation of the hypothetical. We're not dismissing the ""novelty"", OP was simply asking if it were less expensive, would it still have cleared $2B."
boxoffice,3dhula,JonPaula,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"It's a ""nonsense argument"" because if the only factor you're taking away is the excess in ticket price, then it's just math.  If the average ticket price for Avatar was $3 more, and the average price before that was say $7, then it would have made $1.9 billion.  I mean, it's a vapid question. You can't take context out of something like that. They couldn't release the movie without increasing ticket prices because most theaters had to buy new equipment to show it on such a grand scale.  It's like asking if you would buy a Mercedes if it was less expensive. Well, yeah, but it's expensive for a reason."

It has gotten decent buzz and the comic book crowd usually turns out well, especially for Marvel movies.   As for Trainwreck, I think 20 is on the low end of my estimate. Going off of buzz around the theater I work at (which isn't a great indicator I'm sure but gives an okay picture as to what people want to see in the Midwest) Trainwreck has been one a lot of people say they ""want to see."" While the R rating will push some away, including teens, good word of mouth and good reviews could keep it around for a while and give it a good gross. I personally think it'll do 25."
boxoffice,3de96z,Yeah_Okay_Sure,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:26 2015 UTC,"$65 million for Ant-man seems like the most reasonable guess to me too. It could go higher than that, but I'd be mildly surprised given that I perceive Ant-man to be somewhat of an unknown among the general public. Thor is a great comp - people weren't as familiar with his character either prior to his movie and Chris Hemsworth was also largely unknown prior to it as well. While Rudd certainly has more awareness than Hemsworth did, it isn't for movies of this type. Still, I think this should do well.  I will temper that previous statement by saying that for some time now I've been thinking that the box office has become too saturated with super heroes and at some point people will tire of that particular sort of movie. Given the fairly good reviews, Rudd's presence, and the fact that there hasn't been a huge blockbuster action movie since Jurassic World I don't think this will be the movie that shows that fatigue. But given the softer than expected numbers for AoU it has to be something of a concern."

Guardians was a space adventure, Winter Soldier was a 70's type political thriller, Antman is kind of a heist movie. So while they are based on comic books, they're managing to differentiate themselves amongst that genre. I think that is going a long way towards pushing off any kind of superhero fatigue."

Basically a MUST SEE IN 3D type of movie  4)new laws have to be made to let Hollywood movies play for more than 1 month in China which will be a KEY FACTOR.  5)needs strong word of mouth and very strong legs  6)must have an incentive for people to watch it again so the repeat viewings rack up $$$  TLDR: possible but it would require all aspects to line up and have a revolutionary movie. Highly unlikely with other types of technology providing competion but its still possible at the rate that China and other Asian countries are growing their cinema industry.
boxoffice,3deyl4,Shruth1,5,Wed Jul 15 19:22:26 2015 UTC,Point #3 makes achieving this so much easier. As does the fact that the world population is much higher than when GWTW was released...
boxoffice,3deyl4,wolfman86,6,Thu Jul 16 10:56:23 2015 UTC,"I say no because there's just too much more ways a movie studio can monetize its product.  Pay TV, Broadcast TV, Cable TV, Pay-per-view, DVD/Blue-ray, Streaming.  All this will keep any successful movie away from a 2nd or 3rd release in a movie theater or an extended first release.

boxoffice,3deyl4,Republican_Atheist,3,Wed Jul 15 20:44:05 2015 UTC,"Can't see it happening.  First of all, inflation has been outpacing population growth since GWTW (domestically at least). So sure, you have more people going to see the movie but the proportion of the population that needs to go see a movie to break the record keeps increasing so it's only going to get harder to do. Again, this speaking domestically but likely true elsewhere to varying degrees.  Secondly, fewer tickets are being sold and runs in theaters are getting shorter. There's just way more entertainment options. And there are so many more ways to see a ""must see"" film including DVD purchase, VOD, rental, TV, streaming, piracy, etc. Tallying up revenue from these alternate content delivery methods would be a far more fair comparison to GWTW's inflation adjusted number. Incidentally, there was an (Entertainment Weekly?) article a few years back which calculated what it called the most popular movie of all time, or something like that, and it included views on TV, rentals, theater run, etc. That movie was Pretty Woman.  Basically, everything is trending away from that record ever being broken as it is currently measured.  That all said, if the US economy shifted enough, the exchange rates might be able to create the conditions necessary for the worldwide gross to be eclipsed but only due to the same number of viewings translating into far more US dollars."
boxoffice,3deyl4,department4c,9,Thu Jul 16 06:45:22 2015 UTC,"Well every so-called box office expert at /r/movies seem to think episode 7 will make 3 gazillion dollars opening weekend so that seems probable. /s   On a more serious note I do think, with the continually expanding international market, that the record could be broken at some time.   Worth having in mind is that straight up adjusting the gross of a movie to today's dollar isn't a perfect way of calculating its gross had it been released today. Many other factors such as other movies competing against eachother, other media that potentially could decrease sales etc. all makes the ""adjusting"" very complicated and seemingly impossible to do right."
boxoffice,3deyl4,GranatMorfar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"I think Star Wars is brought up, because it has the most potential as anything on the horizon, and it could make $150 million or $250 first weekend. It could dominate Jan/Feb like Titanic, Avatar, and American Sniper.   The only other movie on the horizon that might have a shot is the Avatar sequels, although avatar seems to be hated on a lot nowadays."
boxoffice,3deyl4,Tyler2Tall,6,Sun Jul 19 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"It already has been passed, that gwtw number includes many re-releases from years later.  Also,  you can't adjust WW numbers unless you know how much a film made in each market, and what the average ticket price is for the release year (and now)."
boxoffice,3deyl4,duckfield,-3,Wed Jul 15 22:42:07 2015 UTC,"Those numbers take that into account. If you were to just adjust GWTW's total from 1939 to 2015, it would be at over 6 billion worldwide"
boxoffice,3deyl4,Prologic9,3,Thu Jul 16 03:27:17 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't. Its first release only made $20 million in USA, which translates to about $650-700 million in today's ticket prices. And that doesn't even take into account that on first release the ticket price for it was $1 at a time when the average ticket price was ¢25. As for foreign box office, I find it hard to believe the movie opened outside the States before 1945 at least."
boxoffice,3deyl4,JakkuScavenger,2,Thu Jul 16 10:54:39 2015 UTC,So what youre saying is ... if they rerelease Avatar every decade...
boxoffice,3deyl4,entertainman,0,Thu Jul 16 13:44:23 2015 UTC,no
boxoffice,3deyl4,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think people understand what I was saying.   Duckfields comment implied that they were just taking GWTW's all time total earnings that it made over a period of 60 years, and doing a single adjustment to them from 1939 to today without taking into account the various years of release or the markets they released in.   That's not true, and if you were to do that its total would be at over 6 billion dollars. Which is obviously much higher than it's claimed adjusted total.    You could doubt their sources for foreign box office data over the years, but honestly unless someone has actually done the work themselves to compare they're just full of shit."
boxoffice,3deyl4,Prologic9,0,Thu Jul 16 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's you who misunderstood his comment then. He meant that that adjusted gross includes re-releases, as in adjusted for inflation Gone with the Wind made $650-700 million on first run and $1 billion from its at least 10 subsequent theatrical releases."
boxoffice,3deyl4,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"Well since all releases count towards the total earnings for the film, that's kind of a stupid point, isn't it."
boxoffice,3deyl4,Prologic9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:58:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Only because release windows are much smaller now where gwtw was in theaters for months, now movies hit home video in 4 months. I just don't see it happening"
boxoffice,3deyl4,mannymix03,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:07 2015 UTC,Avatar's adjusted gross is over 3 billion.   With the explosion of Chinese cinema it would be a safe bet that GWTW's record will be broken in the next 10 years.   This is also why worldwide records are pretty meaningless.
boxoffice,3deyl4,Prologic9,0,Thu Jul 16 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"All the records are meaningless.  Adjusting for inflation is just as stupid as not adjusting, it's just a different point of view"
boxoffice,3deyl4,satellite_uplink,2,Thu Jul 16 08:46:39 2015 UTC,"But the variables for worldwide records are so numerous that comparing contemporary releases, even films released in the same year, is pretty pointless.   No one in /r/boxoffice gets that though, and they constantly bring up worldwide numbers to make a point (usually about how Star Wars 7 is going to have a 300m opening weekend and go on to make 4billion dollars )"
boxoffice,3deyl4,Prologic9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"Can I get an Eli5 on why adjusting for inflation is unnecessary? It seems to me like it would actually make more sense to adjust for it due to rising ticket prices, and not adjusting for it just seems like a cop out."
boxoffice,3deyl4,_SpanishInquisition,2,Thu Jul 16 11:24:51 2015 UTC,"Because inflation is only one of the important factors behind trends in cinema popularity is film success - population growth, competing entertainment forms, demographic shifts, socio-economic shifts.  The entire structure of what cinemas were, how they were designed, how the film distribution system works... it's all entirely different from when Gone With The Wind played.  Ignoring inflation is knowingly creating a system weighted towards modern films.  Including inflation is knowingly creating a system weighted towards older films.  I think you can inflation adjust within a 10 year period, but any further than that and it becomes an increasingly grey area."
boxoffice,3deyl4,satellite_uplink,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, but that is because the way we consume movies now is so much different."

It's gross after its first release put it a little over $500 million (and that took four years)

If Star Wars has a complicated story (which it likely will) foreign audiences will be turned off. Plus I read on reddit a while ago that Star Wars: a new hope was just now being released theatrically in China. So our North American nostalgia won't be enough. Worldwide audiences need simple, mindless entertainment."

boxoffice,3d8sn2,Asdyc,4,Tue Jul 14 18:12:14 2015 UTC,They did it to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Titanic sinking and most likely to make more money.
boxoffice,3d8sn2,auna,3,Tue Jul 14 18:40:58 2015 UTC,Nah James just wanted to do fo it to prove 3d converted well is worthwhile and not just money grabbing.
boxoffice,3d8sn2,ritual-killer,6,Fri Jul 17 07:54:48 2015 UTC,That will require another 70 millions. And its already in its 5th week now. I don't think that's very likely. I would put it somewhere around 620-630.
boxoffice,3d8sn2,RogerSmith123456,3,Tue Jul 14 14:22:41 2015 UTC,About $630m
boxoffice,3d8sn2,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:47:47 2015 UTC,$650 million is almost guaranteed now.
boxoffice,3d8sn2,RogerSmith123456,3,Tue Jul 14 19:11:13 2015 UTC,Jurassic World's Monday gross yet again topped Avenger's and will continue for the rest of the weekdays. above pace. It will be around 600m by Thursday and with a $10m weekend it will be at $610m by the end of the weekend
boxoffice,3d8sn2,HowlMoonstone183,2,Tue Jul 14 19:00:34 2015 UTC,Gap is narrowing. It won't hit $660m or $658m for that matter.
boxoffice,3d8sn2,ghettothf,2,Tue Jul 14 15:50:48 2015 UTC,If it makes it past $650m universal will keep it in theaters forever for it to eventually pass titanic

boxoffice,3d9yc5,RogerSmith123456,4,Tue Jul 14 17:27:00 2015 UTC,Minions is still going to hurt I/0 so i think JW will put through for the victory. Ant-Man is also more family oriented so that will also hurt I/0 more than it will hurt JW
boxoffice,3d9yc5,Shruth1,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:53 2015 UTC,You see Ant-Man hurting I/O more than JW? Interesting...
boxoffice,3d9yc5,Shruth1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:16 2015 UTC,earliest reviews for ant man say that it is funnier and more kid friendly than any of the previous marvel films. You can also see this with thomas the train in the trailer so yeah it should hurt IO more than JW
boxoffice,3d9yc5,HowlMoonstone183,3,Tue Jul 14 19:04:31 2015 UTC,I dunno man. There's alot of ants in the movie who are full-frontal nude:  http://cdn.film-book.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/scott-lang-ant-man-02-500x281.jpg

boxoffice,3d9n4w,jannette1992,18,Tue Jul 14 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"No competition. Ant Man appeals to a way larger audience and super heroes movies especially Marvel movies makes way, way, way more money than R rated romantic comedies."
boxoffice,3d9n4w,Asdyc,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:25 2015 UTC,Trainwreck is R rated?  In that case it has no chance of beating Antman.
boxoffice,3d9n4w,alblaster,3,Wed Jul 15 06:11:56 2015 UTC,Trainwreck might do very well anyways but the amount of money it will make will be tiny (no pun intended) compared to Ant Man
boxoffice,3d9n4w,Asdyc,14,Wed Jul 15 06:21:23 2015 UTC,I get the feeling Trainwreck is going to be 'wrecked' by Ant-Man. Although I'd like to see it do well.
boxoffice,3d9n4w,DaveFincher,5,Tue Jul 14 16:24:28 2015 UTC,Early reviews of train wrecked have been good. I'm off Friday and seeing trainwrecked with the gf. Might catch ant man earlier in the day.
boxoffice,3d9n4w,trapper2530,4,Tue Jul 14 16:38:31 2015 UTC,It has way better reviews than Ant-Man but Ant-Man will dominate Trainwreck due to being a PG-13 Marvel movie based on a somewhat well known superhero rather than a R rated romantic comedy
boxoffice,3d9n4w,Asdyc,7,Wed Jul 15 06:23:03 2015 UTC,The two films don't have competing audiences.  One's a romantic comedy clearly aiming for a female audience. One's a superhero flick clearly looking for a mostly male audience.  It's like Inside Out v. Jurassic World or Mad Max v. Pitch Perfect 2. Both film's will likely do well completely independent from one another.

boxoffice,3d9n4w,jimmysilverrims,4,Wed Jul 15 01:28:45 2015 UTC,Well the six year olds I know all loved it
boxoffice,3d9n4w,entertainman,0,Wed Jul 15 01:32:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. Whether they should be allowed to watch it can be up for debate. But whether they do is not. There were quite a few children under 10 every time I saw it (3x so far).
boxoffice,3d9n4w,bogaboy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:37 2015 UTC,A large percentage of audience for Jurassic World were kids. It was like about 60-70% at the showing I went to. I saw a bunch of babies and a bunch of toddlers there. A lot of parents grew up watching Jurassic Park and end up taking their kids to Jurassic World.
boxoffice,3d9n4w,Asdyc,2,Wed Jul 15 06:25:20 2015 UTC,Think Ant-Man has a much larger appeal and a set fanbase. I will be highly surprised if Ant-Man is not sizably higher than Trainwreck.

boxoffice,3d61e9,Jon-Osterman,2,Tue Jul 14 00:38:25 2015 UTC,This is halfway Cars level
boxoffice,3d61e9,cianuro_cirrosis,9,Tue Jul 14 14:47:50 2015 UTC,I watched it on DVD for the first time. And here in Mexico everything from notebooks to kleenex packs is full of Frozen.  It's a good film.
boxoffice,3d61e9,249ba36000029bbe9749,6,Mon Jul 13 20:48:29 2015 UTC,What is a typical ratio for box office to disk sales?
boxoffice,3d61e9,hobojimmy,12,Tue Jul 14 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"This was typical back in the heyday of the DVD/Home Video market. Studios could release a film in theaters and it would make back the cost of production, and then they would make just as much if not more in the aftermarket which was all liquid profit.  Obviously that is not the case today. For most films, the aftermarket is completely dead. People don't want DVD collections anymore. Only standout action/family films tend to do well in the current market. Luckily the international market is growing so studios have started to put all their emphasis there instead."
boxoffice,3d61e9,GreatestOfAllTime96,3,Mon Jul 13 22:06:19 2015 UTC,I remember when I'd walk into people's houses and they would have a bookshelf full of DVDs. Seems weird now.
boxoffice,3d61e9,NeilPoonHandler,5,Tue Jul 14 12:52:02 2015 UTC,"I still collect DVDs, and I am very proud of my collection. I own over 460 last time I checked.  /r/dvdcollection is a great subreddit for DVD collector aficionados."
boxoffice,3d61e9,OtakuMecha,3,Tue Jul 14 14:07:42 2015 UTC,Same. What I do is get the blu-rays that come with a digital copy so I have both.
boxoffice,3d61e9,rickrossroll,2,Wed Jul 15 18:13:24 2015 UTC,VOD is the new market.
boxoffice,3d61e9,KenNoisewater_PHD,2,Tue Jul 14 11:18:37 2015 UTC,Redbox has probably had a hand in that as well
boxoffice,3d61e9,NeilPoonHandler,5,Tue Jul 14 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"It's sold more than 18 million DVD units in the U.S. alone, making it one of the best-selling DVDs of all time. Wow."
boxoffice,3d61e9,coldermilk,4,Tue Jul 14 01:32:16 2015 UTC,Curious what percentage of the purchases were on DVD vs. Blu-ray. Always had the feeling Blu-ray never fully caught on with the average joe consumer.
boxoffice,3d61e9,Groovesharts,3,Tue Jul 14 03:54:10 2015 UTC,Hard to tell. Do you count a dvd/bluray combo as one of each?
boxoffice,3d61e9,coldermilk,4,Tue Jul 14 04:39:51 2015 UTC,"a Blu-ray combo pack should count as just one Blu-ray, for simplicity's sake"
boxoffice,3d61e9,Juswantedtono,2,Tue Jul 14 04:54:22 2015 UTC,I thought it was approaching 50-50 but Frozen's sold 11m DVDs vs 7m Blu-Rays. I think part of the problem is so many people still use non-HD TV and computer screens that they can't tell enough of a difference with Blu-Ray to make a switch.
boxoffice,3d61e9,coldermilk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:34:14 2015 UTC,"Plus, I think the price differential on Blu-ray holds it back. Like if a customer sees two versions of Frozen on the shelf, one that's $15 and the other that is $25, they'll just pick up the cheaper one.  No matter how much better the image quality is on Blu-ray or the fact that it also has a digital streaming/download version of the film and the DVD, people like to stick with what they know. They probably don't feel the benefits are worth an extra ten bucks on the price."
boxoffice,3d61e9,Juswantedtono,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:20 2015 UTC,Good point. I always thought they should sell the Blu-Rays for a couple bucks less than the DVDs to encourage people to go buy Blu-Ray players. They'd still make plenty of profit off each disc.
boxoffice,3d61e9,coldermilk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Blu-rays cost just as much to produce as DVDs. Most of the Blu-rays I own are older movies that likely got discounted to like $5-$10 from places like Amazon, Target and Best Buy wanting to clear out inventory. In those cases, the Blu-ray was cheaper than the DVD version of the same film. People are still confused by the format.  I say they should just ditch the DVD copies in the combo packs, I never use them and honestly I feel the the current Digital Copy code license system is far more versatile for me than DVD. I can stream it on basically any device I have with Wi-Fi in near Blu-ray 1080p quality.  Make the Blu-ray cost as much as the DVD and I think consumers would take a bit more time to learn about the format."

boxoffice,3d61e9,NeilPoonHandler,18,Tue Jul 14 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"You should - it's surprisingly good, despite the overwhelming popularity and the haters that come with it on the Internet (I personally loved it).  The movie is a throwback to the Disney Renaissance period, when some of the most beloved Disney movies were produced (The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty of the Beast, etc.). It is a musical with quite a number of songs that lots of people love, including me.  Also, Frozen subverts the usual expectations one has for a Disney romance, since the princess doesn't end up with the handsome prince in the end. There's a continuous subversion of other standard Disney tropes throughout, and the movie is often very funny (not to mention that the requisite sidekick, Olaf the Snowman, is actually quite funny, endearing, and not annoying, IMO)."
boxoffice,3d61e9,Shruth1,3,Tue Jul 14 01:21:06 2015 UTC,I always wanted to but don't have the time. I guess I'll watch it this weekend and also watch inside out while I'm at it

boxoffice,3d7wku,JakkuScavenger,3,Wed Jul 15 11:56:26 2015 UTC,"I was initially inclined to think that it was due to reporting latency. But digging deeper it looks like there's something else going on. After a quick scan, it looks like domestic numbers match up but overseas conflict with each other, even for for films which aren't currently out. So it might be how each service decided how to convert currency? Odd since I would assume that everyone would need to get numbers from the studios as the original source.  FWIW, Wikipedia uses BOM's numbers. Also, http://www.worldwideboxoffice.com/ more closely matches BOM as well. At this point I'm inclined to go with BOM's numbers."

The second row are the actuals.  The third row is the difference. All guesses were low except for Minions which came in a little high.  Fourth row is the score. Score = actual - difference. Whenever someone guesses low, their score will just be their guess. If their guess had been more then their score would be higher until they hit the actual, at which point their score goes down again. This happened to /u/jburd22's score for Minions. Since the guess was over, the score is less than the actual by the amount of the difference.  Fifth row is percentage accuracy per column. What helped in this case we getting so close on Minions (98% accuracy on the highest grossing movie for the weekend). Being 24% off of Terminator:Genisys doesn't hurt the overall as much since T:G earned less than 10% of what Minions did.  The overall percentage (94.94) is total score (180,536,810) divided by total actual (190,160,118), not the average of all averages. Averaging together all the averages wouldn't take into account the different weighting of the different movies.  So back to the original question, can someone just guess $190.2 million? In short, no, since there is no place to guess composite box office for the weekend. Sure, someone could plug in $190.2 million as a guess for one movie but their score would be terrible since that would mean a huge variances. Let's say they put in that amount for Gallows, the first movie listed on the form. Their score for that movie would be -170,583,074 with a percentage of -1,739.14%. Their score for Minions would be -115,718,405 for a percentage of 0%. Etc. To put it another way, even if you could divine the exact weekend box office take to the dollar of all movies listed, it really wouldn't help since it is the accuracy of each individual movie being measured."

I give Ant-Man a ceiling of $80 million and even then I don't think it reaches that. Probably closer to $65 million  Mockingjay will do it. Star Wars definitely will. Spectre has a chance but is far from a guarantee.  The only other movies I'd say have a chance are The Good Dinosaur, because Pixar and dinosaurs are in right now. It's too early to say though, I haven't seen much promotional material at all. Definitely depends a lot on marketing. I'd say its unlikely though. And Mission Impossible 5. Very very unlikely but possible, the series does have goodwill going from the last one. Depends on reviews/word of mouth partially. will at least open better then F4 and maybe Ant-Man. But it'll have to deal with the holdovers of Ant-Man and Pixels and Southpaw too"

boxoffice,3d6a5a,YouTypeTooSlow,2,Wed Jul 15 02:03:56 2015 UTC,Yes. Which is why I think Batman v Superman can grosses more than a billion. Not sure about Suicide Squad. I think it will be a huge financial success but not in the 700-900 million range. More like 450-600 million.

boxoffice,3d6a5a,3000milestoSpacejam,2,Tue Jul 14 00:04:51 2015 UTC,"I think it hurts that Tom Hardy had to drop out. With Will Smith + Hardy + a Batman/Affleck cameo, this would have had serious star power. Nonetheless, Smith should still be a big draw internationally.  I'd peg it in the 700-800m range. As a reference point, Guardians of the Galaxy pulled in $774m. Pretty similar as they are lesser known character ensemble movies working within a big comic book universe. Neither the quality and kid friendliness of Guardians will probably not be topped by Suicide Squad, though. But Smith and an icon like the Joker could make up the difference.  I have to imagine they will play up the Batman bit closer to the movie's release to drum up bigger interest."
boxoffice,3d6a5a,jimmysilverrims,5,Tue Jul 14 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"The trailer deliberately chose a somber, serious tone—apparently following the popular trend of having a slow raspy rendition of an innocuous song vaguely relevant to the plot (although doing this to the Bee Gees is... an interesting choice).  This seems to imply that the film will be taking itself seriously, ar at the very least market itself seriously. This is an odd choice that's sort of dissonant with the off-beat and dysfunctional band of characters at the film's heart—especially when you're including Harley Quinn and a man named Captain Boomerang in that crowd.  This creates the very real risk of coming off as pretentious, and unlike Batman v. Superman I can see this as a film that a lot of people will be on the fence about seeing. Bad reviews won't put much of a dent in an event film like BvS, but something as off-beat as this could go either way. And pretentiousness is actively repulsive to the casual popcorn-flick moviegoer.  Right now, there's a lot left in the dark. I think this film will likely perform decently, but a lot can change from now 'til release. Barring any major marketing flubs, I can see this film having a decent (but far from record-shattering) opening weekend with a decent draw depending on word-of-mouth."
boxoffice,3d6a5a,GamingTatertot,3,Tue Jul 14 01:55:33 2015 UTC,"I loved the BvS trailer and honestly, I liked the Suicide Squad trailer more. What an awesome trailer and Robbie looks awesome as does Leto. I also can't wait to see how they play off the members that have abilities like Killer Croc. Finally, if I had to make an early guess I would say 700 million...around that range."
boxoffice,3d6a5a,stoicblunder,2,Tue Jul 14 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"The trailer was incredibly well done. Focusing on Margot Robbie is perfect for two reasons. One, her sexual attraction is off the charts. Two, it will get women interested. I think the Joker reveal was a little lame and should have come earlier in the trailer. I get what they were doing, but we need to see him action not just a short snapshot.  I have predicted the death of the comic book movie in the next few years, but this will keep it on the lifeline for awhile. 100-130 opening I would say, at least."
boxoffice,3d6a5a,Vendevende,3,Tue Jul 14 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"I was a little disappointed. Will Smith doesn't feel like Deadshot, as cool as Leto looked it does feel like a complete Ledger ripoff minus the grills and physique, and, as a critique overall, there are some real questionable characters - Slipnot? Croc? Jaden's dad?  It's too attached to the Batman mythos, a little like Ant Man is to the Avengers. Harley and Batman v Joker 3.0 will help with boxoffice numbers, but frankly it looks like a spinoff to Gotham."

boxoffice,3d6a5a,mattymck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:00:53 2015 UTC,"Now that ive thought more about it, i think the trailer is pretty bad (in terms of hyping people up about the film).  I feel like the trailer was really just for people who are already familiar with all the characters, and have been following who plays who. The average viewer isnt going to know who any of these people are except for the joker and the small glimpse at batman.   The trailer doesn't really tell the viewer much about what the film is about, just that they are called the suicide squad.   That said, leto looks prety awesome as the joker. Im excited for this movie, but i feel like the joker is the only one that will draw people into into the theatre, but it will also have them wondering where batman is. People may also think of this movie as Joker: the movie considering the other characters are not popular in the mainstream.   But of course as we get closer to the movie, there will more, and better advertising aimed at the uninitiated.   I expect opening weekend might be lower then expected, but the overall to be high."
boxoffice,3d6a5a,mattymck,2,Tue Jul 14 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"This is a good point, but I disagree on some points. I think Harley Quinn is a fairly well known character (she's the only one I've really heard of outside outside of Batman and the Joker) plus the fact it's Margot Robbie playing her is enough to get people interested in who the character is. But overall I think your right, but this was a trailer for comi-con which wasn't going to be released to the general public. Apparently anyway, I think they knew it was going to leak and wanted to create more buzz by pretending to be doing us a favour by giving us the HD trailer. Ignoring my conspiracy theory, the trailer probably assumed the audience at comicon knew all the characters in the trailer."
boxoffice,3d6a5a,hamlet9000,2,Tue Jul 14 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"yes exactly, without a more informing trailer, its really tough to predict how this will do. The trailer we saw was made for comic con"
boxoffice,3d424g,Tsukamori,12,Mon Jul 13 10:26:48 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Spoilers for Captain America Civil War below.   TL;DR, 3 guaranteed billion dollar movies (Batman vs Superman, Captain America Civil War, Finding Dory) and 3 that have a pretty good shot at it (Alice Through the Looking Glass, X-Men Apocalypse, Indepedence Day: Resurgence), and 2 that I just need more information to tell (Suicide Squad and Rouge One)  In order of release  Deadpool - February 12 - NOT LIKELY - While there is much hype over this and by all accounts it looks to be a solid/faithful adaptation, I believe it is confirmed to be R rating, which will greatly reduce it's revenue from t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m lolrandomspork audience.  Batman vs Superman - March 25 - ALMOST CERTAIN - If there was one film next year that will break a billion, it will be this.   Jungle Book - April 15 - NOT LIKELY - On one hand there is a crazy cast on this. On the other, it's a live action Disney movie. For comparison, Cinderella just got 539MM this year.   Captain America: Civil War - May 6 - VERY LIKELY - This is basically a mini Avengers, featuring not only Cap/Falcon/Black Widow/Winter Soldier, but also Iron Man, Vision, Hawkeye, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, and Ant man, as well as the debut of Black Panther and SPIDERMAN. That and it's adapting one of the biggest comic events in the past decade which included the death of Captain America.  In addition, the first Cap movie went from 370MM to 714MM in the second, almost doubling revenue.  I don't expect it to do the same here (a full doubling) but even a 40% increase would push it past a billion  Alice Through the Looking Glass - May 27- 50/50 - The first Alice movie went just over a billion in 2010 - Whether or not this one will also hit a billion depends on reviews quite honestly. That said, this and X-Men Apocalypse may very well cannibalize each other.   X-Men Apocalypse - May 27 - 50/50 - It's hard for me to tell with this series.  Revenue has ranged pretty consistently in the 300MM - 400MM, with the exception of the most recent, Days of Future Past which got to 750MM.  Whether or not this is a fluke or not remains to be seen, to be honest.   Warcraft - June 10 - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION (If I need to take a position, NOT LIKELY)- Honestly there's just not enough to go off of. I can't think of any Video game movies that have done well, but I can't say if this is a good analogue to those.  It's probably one of the biggest IPs out there so who knows.   Finding Dory - June 17 - ALMOST CERTAIN - 1)Finding Nemo is the number 2 Pixar movie, behind Toy Story 3, at 936MM.  2)Every Pixar sequel increases revenue over the prior entry in the series. Yes this includes Cars 2 from Cars and Monsters University from Monsters Inc.   Independence Day: Resurgence - June 24 - LIKELY - Independence Day net 817MM in 1996. This broke Jurassic Park's records for opening weekend and was for a long time in worldwide numbers was only beat by Jurassic Park till the turn of the century. Now again if the movie is a flop, it will flop.  But if it's anything like Jurassic World has been for Jurassic Park, we may see a repeat of history between these two franchieses 20 years later.  Star Trek Beyond - July 8 - NOT LIKELY - Neither of the previous Star Trek films broke half a billion, I see no reason for this one to either.   Ice Age: Collisoin Course - July 15 - NOT LIKELY - The last two movies have been 800MM+ which is impressive. However, the fourth movie marked a decline compared to the 3rd, and so I forsee this downward trend continuing.  This is similar to the Shrek franchise, which peaked at Shrek 2, and just declined from there.   Suicide Squad - August 5 - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION (If I need to take a position, 50/50)- Honestly this will largely depend on how audienes react to Batman vs Superman and what hints they leave to a shared universe.  It appears in the BvS trailer that the Joker may be a common thread between the two movies.  If DC can shed the ""DC can't make good movies"" reputation they have, then this may do very well. That said, it still is a very different movie - Avengers as an ensemble movie only really worked because we had a ton of movies beforehand leading up to it where characters could be developed.  This isn't the case here - they also have more characters than Guardians. That said, hype around this movie is pretty high, as almost any new information trends on Facebook.   Gambit - October 7 - NOT LIKELY - This is like the Wolverine movies. Probably enjoyable but not billion dollars worthy.  Doctor Strange - November 4 - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION (If I need to take a position, Not Likely)- I predict this will more or less perform as well as Ant-Man does, maybe a bit better.  Benedict Cumberbatch does have a bigger draw than Paul Rudd to be honest, but the premise of these movies is the same - a new introduction to the franchise of a solo character in a post Avengers world.  We haven't had a new solo movie (Guardians doesn't count since it's an ensemble).   Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - November 18 - NOT LIKELY - The only movie in the Harry Potter series to break a billion was the last one. This is not a main story installment, with an all new cast, so casual movie goers won't go see it like I feel everyone did in 2011, when it was at the height of a massive cultural movement. Fans who missed the universe will go in droves, but not enough to push it past a billion.  Moana - November 23 - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION (If I need to take a position, Not Likely ) - This is on the same weekend as Tangled and Frozen (and to a degree Princess and the Frog, considering the same director).  To date, Frozen is the only Disney animated film to break a billion. This movie does plan on being another musical, and computer animated, in a far-off realm (Polynesia).  While I welcome the more diverse cast, it depends on who they cast and whether the songs become earworms the same way ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" and ""Let It Go"" did. Of note, Frozen did BONKERS in the foreign market, and I don't know how well a darker skinned protagonist will fare (in countries like China where paler skin is more valued)  Star Wars Anthologies: Rogue One - December 16 - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION (If I need to take a position, 50/50) - Obviously Star Wars this year will break a billion.  Will a non-main entry to the franchise fare as well? Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them will provide some guidance. The Hobbit can be considered another example (albeit with a half-recurring cast instead of an all new cast as in Beasts), however both of these come after after a long period with no new content, whereas this will be coming a year after the last main installment in the series. Maybe the juggernaut that is Star Wars will demand a billion with each installment, main series or not.   Let me know if there are any films I should take a look at"

We'll see how Hitman movie next month will do as a baseline for how Video Game movies will be accepted, (essentially since they're both assassination video games), but as a baseline we have data for, the Prince of Persia (another Parkour-ish video game movie) only did 335MM in 2010."
boxoffice,3d424g,YouTypeTooSlow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:48:47 2015 UTC,Oh I didn't expect it to hit a billion. Though a video game movie will hit a billion eventually. My money is on a Mass Effect game.
boxoffice,3d424g,rzwodezwo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:43:54 2015 UTC,Mind that Prince of Persia was super super shitty. A good adaption of the AC series has great potential as I would see it.

boxoffice,3d424g,ritual-killer,10,Tue Jul 14 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"Avatar 2 wont come out until 2017. They postponed it again last year. The ones I think will cross $1 billion will be: 1. Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice 2.The Jungle Book (maybe? if its any good) 3. Captain America: Civil War 4. Finding Dory 5. Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them (it will depend on how they advertise it, but i think most people wanna see more of the HP world) 6. Rogue One (Depends on the success of Ep VII and if Darth Vader will have a role)  Movies like Deadpool, Star Trek, Suicide Squad, Doctor Strange and Gambit will probably end up in the 600-800 million dollar club depending on their respective successes."
boxoffice,3d424g,Prax150,9,Mon Jul 13 11:01:54 2015 UTC,"Deadpool   There's 0 chance Deadpool makes anywhere near a billion dollars. It's R-rated, which automatically limits its audience. It'll be heavily scrutinized too. Even though they're doing everything right from a marketing standpoint, the movie still has to turn out to be great. Plus it's coming out in like February, which isn't exactly the best release window for a blockbuster. Also while this is a Marvel property, it's not being made by Marvel Studios, so that might have an effect on BO as well.  In fact there's only ever been a couple of superhero/comic book movies that have ever made more than $100 million.  If they're lucky and the film is as good as the hype, it'll make $200 million at most."
boxoffice,3d424g,ritual-killer,-4,Mon Jul 13 14:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but look at how Kingsman did. If it turns out to be even remotely as good as Kingsman, I think 600-700 millions is guaranteed. But you're right. It wont make a billion."
boxoffice,3d424g,bipolarbearsRAWR,8,Mon Jul 13 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"Deadpool is more niche than Kingsmen. It has a lot less female appeal and less appeal to non-comic book fans.   From an outsider, it's just Ryan Reynolds doing a lot of fourth wall and snarky comments to the camera while in costume.  And Reynolds alone won't bring in the audience. Look at Self/Less this weekend and the performance of The Green Lantern."
boxoffice,3d424g,Prax150,5,Mon Jul 13 16:02:45 2015 UTC,Kingsman made $400M worldwide and $125M domestically. I think Deadpool would probably be lucky to match that.
boxoffice,3d424g,ritual-killer,0,Mon Jul 13 15:52:31 2015 UTC,"Deadpool is a well-established superhero though. And with the marketing strategy and the success of the trailer at Comic-Con, I think it will make a lot more than just 400 millions. But, of course, it has to be good. It can easily take the Green Lantern route or even worse if it isn't."
boxoffice,3d424g,YouTypeTooSlow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"He's well established with comic book fans. He's pretty unknown to outsiders. Plus his breaking the 4th wall and memes won't seem as cool or funny to casual audiences (for lack of better term, non-nerds)"
boxoffice,3d424g,JakkuScavenger,3,Mon Jul 13 22:06:31 2015 UTC,"The reason I think Rogue One is a wild card - it's not an Episode, it's a stand-alone."
boxoffice,3d424g,ritual-killer,2,Mon Jul 13 11:11:59 2015 UTC,"But imagine Episode VII becomes crazy successful. Rogue One will definitely earn 1 billion just with the name of the franchise behind it. If they really bring Darth Vader, (of course, the story has to be good too) I think it will definitely at least touch the billion dollar mark."
boxoffice,3d424g,JakkuScavenger,2,Mon Jul 13 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"Think Captain America 2, compared to The Avengers. I think Rogue One can hope to target half of whatever The Force Awakens makes worldwide. So if The Force Awakens does cross $2 billion, Rogue One becomes a lock to gross $1 billion."

boxoffice,3d424g,trapper2530,5,Mon Jul 13 10:54:35 2015 UTC,Idk why everyone thinks Captain America is a lock. Winter soldier made $715 mil after the first avengers . Age of ultron still did great but not as good as projections were. I could see it ending around $900
boxoffice,3d424g,lot183,2,Mon Jul 13 17:24:36 2015 UTC,"In a lot of ways Cap 3 is also Iron Man 4 (and IM3 made 1.2 billion). I'm sure RDJ will be at the forefront of most marketing, and I think Captain America vs Iron Man will be a HUGE selling point. On top of that its also going to have tons of other heroes. Hawkeye, Black Widow, War Machine, Ant-Man, Falcon, Vision, and Scarlet Witch are all in it, not to mention Spider-Man is confirmed to show up. If Spider-Man is part of the marketing at all that could be huge.   Its basically the whole Avengers cast minus Thor and the Hulk. It has a selling point the others haven't had in both the Cap vs Iron Man storyline AND the Spider-Man appearance.   I think it has a very very strong chance at 1 billion, if its not a lock"
boxoffice,3d424g,trapper2530,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:56 2015 UTC,It's got a shot but far from a lock. People who don't follow it closely probably won't know spider man is in it and some might not know iron man will be in it.
boxoffice,3d424g,lot183,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:10:02 2015 UTC,"Umm, i think you aren't taking into account that the marketing will be EVERYWHERE. And I absolutely guarantee you it will be playing up that Iron Man is in it and that the main plot point is Captain America vs Iron Man. There will be trailers before movies, tv commercials, merchandising. Trust me, most everyone will know Iron Man is in it.  Spider-Man is more questionable, they may try to keep that a surprise for your average movie goer, but I bet that they have him in the marketing too because thats a huge selling point.   I feel like you are completely taking marketing out of the equation. There's none right now of course because the movie isnt until Summer next year, but in the months leading up to it you will be hearing about the movie a lot. The average movie goer will know that Iron Man and probably the other heroes I mentioned are in it (again, Spider-Man is questionable depending on how they want to play that, but I'd bet he's in the advertising too)"
boxoffice,3d424g,trapper2530,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:25:32 2015 UTC,You aren't thinking of the people who don't regular sit on the Internet or watch TV and don't follow movies who just go a couple times a year. Those people turn out for Big movies like JW or avengers or Avatar. All they'll see if Captain America. They may see a trailer on TV which is 30 seconds and not put it together iron man is in it.
boxoffice,3d424g,lot183,2,Mon Jul 13 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"I absolutely guarantee you that Iron Man will be all over those 30 seconds. Why would he not? The whole gist of this movie is ""Cap vs Iron Man"", why would that not be the focal point of every advertising point? It'll be on movie trailers, posters, tv trailers, billboards, internet ads, talk shows, magazine covers, hell Avengers 2 even had advertising on Dr Pepper cans and I imagine this will do something similar.   Why would the marketing not focus on the fact Iron Man is in it? That's what separates this from the past two films. Its not like that 30 second ad will just be Captain America, in fact I bet the majority of that ad will show the characters in it besides Cap because you already know Cap is in it by the title. Iron Man will be plastered all over the advertisements"
boxoffice,3d424g,trapper2530,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:40:09 2015 UTC,I get that. I'm talking about the people who don't pay attention closely to trailers. The people who are borderline if they're going to go. The ones that go bc of word of mouth you need those people to go and if they don't I don't see it making 1 billion. It's definitely not a lock.
boxoffice,3d424g,JakkuScavenger,2,Mon Jul 13 22:50:11 2015 UTC,It has Iron Man in it.
boxoffice,3d424g,trapper2530,3,Mon Jul 13 18:10:24 2015 UTC,Is he worth a $300 mil boost though?
boxoffice,3d424g,JakkuScavenger,3,Mon Jul 13 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"I mean Iron Man 3 made $1.2 billion. Plus this movie will basically have all the Avengers except for Thor and Hulk, but on the other hand it will also have the first appearance of Spider-Man."

boxoffice,3d424g,jhawk1117,6,Mon Jul 13 11:13:33 2015 UTC,It's a sequel to one of the most beloved animated movies ever and the first one made over 900 million.
boxoffice,3d424g,JakkuScavenger,2,Mon Jul 13 12:12:28 2015 UTC,"It made $863 million back in 2003, the rest it made on its 3D re-release. It's been 13 years since the original was released and without a trailer or any outlook on its quality it's not possible to say what kind of business it's expected to make. So, at least to me, it's not a lock for $1 billion, but because the original made so much, it's very likely!"

The last one had the whole cast back and was probably the most anticipated one in the franchise and earned around $750M. A $250 jump would be crazy. Also, I doubt Moana will. Disney movies rarely make a billion and this one seems less marketable. Big Hero 6 only made $650 and Wreck it Ralph was around $500. Alice is a maybe through I see a big drop due to how poorly the first one was received. That and it had the gimmick of being the next big IMAX 3D release a few months after Avatar. Fantastic Beasts will probably be successful but I'd be shocked if it made a billion. Most of the Harry Potters didn't even hit that. Also, no shot Warcraft hits that. Ice Age 5.....probably not. Maybe close though."

If you look at box office data in Russia, UK, France, China and Germany, they all see 50-70% drops on big blockbusters - especially Russia.

It was also in the top 10 for 44 weeks, for reference, 2nd biggest film of the year so far domestically, Age of Ulton, is already out of the top 10 within 9 weeks. Even Titanic only got 26.   Avengers 1 had a 3x multiplier from opening weekend. Most blockbuster like this have around a 2-3x multiplier. 3x is considered impressive and great legs. Every few years you see a movie with Insane holds like Avatar (10x multiplier), Frozen (6x multiplier). Titanic considered as Legendary legs (20x multiplier) is still no where near E.T. which posted a mind boggling 30x MULTIPLIER from opening weekend.   The defenition of legs. Nothing will ever come close again. it increased a total of 18 times in its release over the previous weekend. Mind boggling.   The king of Legs, it will never be touched."

Slumdog Millionaire did something similar in the UK, more recently.  There's a lot you can predict will hold in, though:  Christmas-tied kids films have good legs, they tend to start low at mid-end November but then each week the public gets more christmassy and so often they hold in with virtually no drop, or even go up, right until December 25th.  Then drop 95% on boxing day.  Similarly non-christmas kids films released around christmas often hold really well through Jan-Feb because there's no other kids films released during oscar season.

boxoffice,3cx1wp,vakeraj,7,Sun Jul 12 14:48:51 2015 UTC,"While it never had a chance at topping Avatar, I think if it was more well regarded in terms of quality like the first one, along with Guardians and Winter Soldier, instead of just a resounding ""meh"" (74% on RT, compared to 90%+ for the other three) from most people, it had a reasonable hope of holding the box office crown of the MCU.

boxoffice,3cx1wp,mrm3x1can,3,Sun Jul 12 16:13:23 2015 UTC,I would not call it completely reasonable at all. That would mean the Age of Ultron would've had to make at least 1.3 billion more than its predecessor to beat Avatar.

boxoffice,3cx1wp,Cardow,9,Sat Jul 11 22:59:44 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible, it's just bloody difficult. If a movie were able to theoretically sell out every seat on every screen in the US, with constant screenings - it could make $3.65B in one weekend. I did the math on this a few months back for a similar thread.  Obviously, that's impossible. But it's proof that the limiting factor for box office results isn't infrastructure, it's demand. If enough people want to see The Force Awakens bad enough, $300M is obtainable.  Personally, I think it'll crack $250M. But its' also hard to predict, because we have no previous film to compare it to. Phantom Menace came out in another era entirely, and the December release puts it into a whole new ballpark of speculation. We've never seen a movie this big ever, much less in the Holiday season.  Count nothing out."
boxoffice,3cx1wp,Mushroomer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:04:44 2015 UTC,Are you sure u did the math right ? 3.65B in 1 weekend is unimaginable. I would assume it would top off around $600m OW maybe with the current system. Most theaters were also filled for most shows around the country for Jurassic World's gross so idk I just can't see how you can get $3.65B domestically
boxoffice,3cx1wp,Shruth1,3,Mon Jul 13 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"The hypothetical maximum is a film that opens on every screen in the country, and sells out every seat of every possible showing. There are approximately 45K cinema screens in the US, each holding around 250 seats. So 11.25M seats that in this hypothetical, are only showing Star Wars for the whole weekend. If we can assume a 3-hour turnaround between showings (runtime of movie+trailers/ads+load/unload), then we can play the movie 27 times on each of those screens. (Assuming the earliest showing starts at 5:59 on Thursday, and the final showing on 11:59 Sunday). So each one of our 11.25M seats can be sold 27 times, for an industry average price of $12. That produces $3.645B in revenue.  95% of the American population would need to see the film, with half of them seeing it in the middle of the night/early morning. It's an impossible scenario. But it proves that the ceiling isn't constrained by the theaters, it's constrained by demand. All it takes is enough people wanting to see a movie bad enough to produce that much revenue. (Edit - Of course, this could go even higher. If demand was truly infinite, people would pay an infinite amount of money for a single seat. There's no reason theaters wouldn't just price gouge if they knew people would absolutely pay. It also throws out the notion of a digital release - if Disney wanted to stream Episove 7 for $12 a head independently of the theater system, they could hypothetically make ~$103B. [with every person in america buying the film 27 times in one weekend])  Fun fact - I saw Jurassic World at a 10pm showing, Thursday night of release. The house was practically empty (mainly because it was the last JW show of the night). Even the most popular movies aren't selling out every show."
boxoffice,3cx1wp,Mushroomer,2,Mon Jul 13 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"If you search ""how many cinema screens in usa"" on google you would find that there were 39,056 screens back in mid 2013. Assuming they build 1,000 screens in 2 years (which is likely) there are only 40,000 approx. screens in US. Screen sizes come in 100, 150, 200 and 250 being the biggest with IMAX 3D played in them. So i would the the average screen size would be 175 seats. Average movie ticket price in US is $8.12, idk how u got $12. Ill take your word for movie times and use this information to deduct that... 7 million seats approx X 27  x $8.12...A total of $1.534 Billion in 1 weekend much lower than ur prediction but still insanely high. Proves that, like u said, theaters can handle the business but the demand must match it. If you want me to post links of the information or you would like to share where you got ur information from feel free to share."
boxoffice,3cx1wp,Shruth1,-7,Mon Jul 13 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"That's really not true anymore.  China is the gateway to that record number being broken - many more bums on seats when you included China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and SEA.  There's a reason why Hollywood has been aggressively courting China for the last 5 years.  Donnie Yen's announced role in Star Wars VIII prior to the drum up for VII was done so precisely for the same reason - to get the Chinese into buying tickets for VII so they know what's going on when they rush to cinemas to watch one of their biggest stars in VIII.  Star Wars will likely break records.  Hell, Transformers 4 - arguably the weakest movie in the bunch became the Number 1 selling movie in Chinese Cinema History and that's because it was directed at Chinese audiences.  You cannot assume anything."

When Return of the King opened on a Wednesday in December , it still scored the fifth highest opening weekend of all time even though it burned off some of the demand for it before the weekend. The reason The Hobbit opened with 'only' $84 million isn't that it was a December release. It was because there was already a ton of negative press about the movie before the release: the splitting of a small book into three movies, negativity towards higher frame rate, etc.  There is no evidence to suggest that The Force Awakens can't open to a $200m+ opening weekend. Die-hard fans will want to see it opening weekend, if not Friday (I'd say $100m opening day is quite possible) and there are a lot of diehard Star Wars fans!"

Edit:  Also, the movie would have to wow general audiences on Avatar's level to have a chance at topping it, even with the Star Wars brand.  Phantom Menace is presently at #17, and that was after a longer hiatus following MUCH more popular movies.  Ep. 7 pretty much has to blow Empire and Jedi away in terms of quality to pull off a top 20 finsh on that chart."
boxoffice,3cx1wp,voidsoul22,3,Sat Jul 11 18:01:29 2015 UTC,You're looking at domestic gross. Avatar is #2 worldwide adjusted.
boxoffice,3cx1wp,DaveFincher,7,Sat Jul 11 20:59:42 2015 UTC,And people were in hysterics waiting for TPM. I know I was. Even people who had never seen a SW film before got swept up in the hype and became overnight obsessives while waiting for that film to come out. I was in HS when it came out and this happened with a good number of my classmates.  Among casual SW fans and people who are not SW fans there's no hype whatsoever for this film. When Celebration was going on a few of my coworkers were really into the trailer and watching the live stream and we all talked about SW for a few days afterward. It hasn't been mentioned at all since at work. I hear more speculation and talk about upcoming Star Trek films than I do Ep. 7...and we're a pretty nerdy office because we're all IT and tech support.
boxoffice,3cx1wp,CharlieHarvey,3,Sat Jul 11 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"And people were in hysterics waiting for TPM   Yep, same here in Germany. Several years before the release of PM there was a HUUUGE hype surrounding it. It was practically everywhere, Star Wars posters and magazines were on every corner and people couldn't wait to get the newest info on it because Internet wasn't as widespread as it is now they had to rely on old media.  But the newest SW film barely sparks any interest here this time, there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm behind it like it was the case with Phantom Menace."
boxoffice,3cx1wp,dustfeather,3,Sat Jul 11 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"There's definitely hype from casual fans. Yesterday and this morning the behind the scenes reel was trending on facebook and my father, who is a casual fan, called to ask me if I'd seen it yet. Once the merchandise comes out and TV spots are playing the hype is going to ramp way up. But I still don't think it will beat Avatar. It's not as big of an event as TPM either."
boxoffice,3cx1wp,bennihana123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:17:44 2015 UTC,Domestic it can beat Avatar. Jurassic World is gonna end up some $70-$80 million behind Avatar. The Force Awakens seems to be trying to invoke the same nostalgia response from fans as Jurassic World and Star Wars has a much bigger fandom than Jurassic Park.
boxoffice,3cx1wp,JakkuScavenger,2,Sun Jul 12 09:31:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted here, Jurassic World is only $90 million away from your prediction of it being behind Avatar (domestically). The only thing that might keep Star Wars from hitting the same success is releasing in the Winter, when people are visiting others for the holidays, and there isn't as much of a draw to the theater as there is in the Summer. But even if it doesn't beat Jurassic World at the box office it won't be a failure by any means."
boxoffice,3cx1wp,bennihana123,2,Mon Jul 13 21:14:02 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're getting downvoted here   A lot of people here get seriously mad by the mere suggestion that Star Wars might have the potential to gross more than Avatar.

boxoffice,3cx1wp,JakkuScavenger,9,Sun Jul 12 09:29:25 2015 UTC,People just don't understand that to make kind of Box Office numbers as Titanic for example for have to have truly universal movie that appeals to people from very different backgrounds. Star Wars is hugely popular but it's still isn't universal movie in that sense. Even just the fact that there is 6 movie long backstory makes it not that approachable to everyone.
boxoffice,3cx1wp,IndyBrodaSolo,2,Sat Jul 11 21:19:42 2015 UTC,"There also has to be an element of surprise--people have to have high expectations for a movie and then get those expectations blown away. That's what creates the insane word of mouth + repeat business necessary for a run like Titanic or Avatar. Star Wars peaked in quality with episode V and since then people know exactly what they're signing up for when they go see a SW movie. The fan base for that franchise is obviously huge, but SW7 isn't going to convince Jane Fifty Year Old or Grandpa Seventy Year Old to go see it if they've never been interested in SW before. The demographic for SW7 will essentially be the people who saw the prequel trilogy in theaters plus a couple million kids who have been born since 2005. It will make plenty of money but theres no reason to think it'll topple Avatar or even Titanic's worldwide gross. $1.5b WW is my prediction."

Individuals, families, etc. just don't have enough cash in their wallets to warrant multiple films in one year topping $500m domestically, let alone hitting the numbers being tossed around.   Conservative estimates are that it will do Age of Ultron numbers (which shouldn't really be a disappointment .. it's still in the top 10 of all time). I still think, even with all of the stars aligning for it, it will still be hard-pressed to top Jurassic World.

I use my parents as reference because they are older, yet still semi-avid movie goers who have been to most big releases this year, but they will never go and see a new Star Wars movie. And I feel that for all the super fans there are a lot of people who simply don't care, turned off by the original trilogy (again I think just super-fans, I liked episodes 2 and 3) and people who don't like the franchise at all. /Rant.

Why couldn't Star Wars break all the records, it's a internationally loved franchise that is in a cinematic drought. Star Wars is number two adjusted for inflation so it's not ludicrous to think Force Awakens (if it's any good) could do just as well or better given the strength of international growth. Star Wars is one of those unique franchises that speak to all generations and has only grown in value over the years.   edit For clarification, copy and paste from a reply I made below. =) My line of thinking isn't just about it's initial release but also taking into account re-releases, inflation, ext.

People seem to now consider him the biggest box office draw in the world which seems wildly premature.  The guy is great, but he's starred in exactly two hit movies and both were part of massively popular franchises (Marvel and Jurassic Park).  Let's see how he does with a lesser known property (Passengers, which comes out next year, should be a nice measure of Pratt's popularity)."

I just don't know if Star Wars is as big a deal to the general public as some of the enthusiastic fans think it is.   The other thing everyone's just crossing their fingers about is JJ Abrams. He's made a lot of good movies, a lot of LIKEABLE movies that weren't necessarily good, and he's made some stinkers. He's been around a long time, and I remember Harold Ramis saying most directors have a finite career span, and JJ (just based on his years in the industry) ""could"" be approaching the end of his. We've all seen brilliant directors who've made killer movies and then they just descend into making bombs for whatever reason. JJ's spread himself thin with all the television productions his company is churning out, and while he keeps telling the world he's a huge SW fan, nobody really knows if that means he's going to make a SW movie all the other fans will like."

With Disney taking control of the Star Wars franchise, they tapered back many of the side projects(We are not seeing more Star Wars Kinect games) so there is a drought of good Star Wars stuff out there. What is out there, such as the animated TV show and the up coming Star Wars Battlefront, is of good quality.  Star Wars just has mass appeal. I know a lot of older people, who don't go out to the movies that often, but are definitely going to see Star Wars. Kids & teens are going to see it cuz its a cool action film.

boxoffice,3ct4he,KeV64,47,Fri Jul 10 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"Jurrassic world plays really well on nostalgia. Terminator had an outrageously bad trailer.  When i saw Age of ultron  on opening night, the entire theare groaned when they revealed major pllot points in the trailer. It did the exact opposite of what a trailer is supposed to do: it made people lose interest.   JW is also a much better movie. Theres a much more coherent plot, and the characters are much better.   Jai courtney is the most bland actor ive ever seen in a lead role.   JW on RT: 71%  Terminator: Genisys: 26%"
boxoffice,3ct4he,mattymck,12,Fri Jul 10 15:49:13 2015 UTC,agreed -- the Jai Courtney factor cannot be ignored.  It was like he was acting in an unfunny junior high school comedy with Emilia Clarke in Genisys.
boxoffice,3ct4he,bipolarbearsRAWR,5,Fri Jul 10 16:13:58 2015 UTC,His face never moves lol...I have noticed that his eyes do convey emotion which is rare but it's very discreet and he still is pretty bad

boxoffice,3ct4he,tikki_rox,10,Fri Jul 10 23:41:56 2015 UTC,We can all be glad that at least the better movie did better at the box office. That will presumably push Hollywood to stop spending money on schlock and it (along with Ted 2) acts as a reminder that sequels are not guarantees to a big payday.  I think the trailer is taking more blame than it should though. Spoiling the twist is commonplace and don't forget that T2's trailer also exposed the twist yet it went on to smash the box office.
boxoffice,3ct4he,department4c,7,Fri Jul 10 17:28:34 2015 UTC,"I think the trailer is taking more blame than it should though. Spoiling the twist is commonplace   Just because it's commonplace doesn't make it okay and less blame-able. That twist in Genisys could have propelled the movie further if we didn't see it coming whereas T2 was a masterpiece from the ground up so, naturally, it did well."
boxoffice,3ct4he,AceDynamicHero,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different of course. Some people will like movies more having seen the spoiler and some less. That said, there is evidence that, overall, people prefer to have stories spoiled. One source: http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-14521627 But what it boils down to is that if studios make more money from exposing spoilers in the trailers then they're going to do it."
boxoffice,3ct4he,department4c,5,Fri Jul 10 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's fair. Comedy sequels are unpredictable, sure, but action / adventure franchises are still a solid bet. For instance, I have no idea of whether there's even a script for FF8, but I know it will do great at the box office wehnever it comes out."
boxoffice,3ct4he,Go_Arachnid_Laser,2,Sat Jul 11 05:30:50 2015 UTC,but action / adventure franchises are still a solid bet   I'm not saying that action sequels aren't a solid bet. What I'm saying is they can't just mail it in and expect to make a killing. As long as moviegoers keep paying up for sequels the studios will crank them out. I'm just hoping that TG serve as a reminder that they are at least going to have to make a real effort to put something solid together.
boxoffice,3ct4he,department4c,2,Sat Jul 11 06:46:54 2015 UTC,Why is Jai Courtney hot property? He's the worst lead actor I have seen in a long time. And that's saying a lot.
boxoffice,3ct4he,TheGameOfClones,23,Sat Jul 11 09:04:29 2015 UTC,"JW and Genisys both played on nostalgia but JW played on something that had never been seen before (an operating park) whilst Genisys was the same thing as T1 and T2. Plus the gap between JPIII and JW is bigger than the gap between Salvation and Genisys. Not to mention, big budget dinosaur movies aren't made as much as big budget robot movies."
boxoffice,3ct4he,GamingTatertot,6,Fri Jul 10 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yup, the long time gap played a huge role for JW taking off life like it did. And the reverse for Terminator. I still haven't washed out the bad taste in my mouth from Terminator 3, ugh, just pure trash. And then whatever the last Term movie was, couldn't even get through it and I love the Terminator universe."
boxoffice,3ct4he,stoicblunder,3,Fri Jul 10 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"Dinosaur vs. Robot might be the biggest difference at the base of this discussion. Great point. Where else are people seeing beautifully rendered dinosaurs in IMAX 3D? Dinosaurs are awesome and people, young and old, love them.  Like if W was also a 27% quality movie it still would have done major damage over Genisys."
boxoffice,3ct4he,3000milestoSpacejam,22,Sat Jul 11 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, one is a decent movie and the other is reheated dogshit, so I can understand why. Also star power. Aside from Arnold (who is in everything really), T.G. has... Jai Courtney? The worst working actor in Hollywood. JW had Chris Pratt, one of the biggest stars on the planet right now.  And what do you mean the reviews are similar? JW was rocking a 77% Tomatometer score and Terminator has a 26%. I really wasn't a fan of JW and thought it was super rick-shod, but it's nowhere near the level of garbage the Terminator franchise has morphed into in recent times"
boxoffice,3ct4he,derpyco,17,Fri Jul 10 16:20:57 2015 UTC,I think the reviews and especially the word of mouth has been far stronger for Jurassic World than it has been for Terminator Genisys.

boxoffice,3ct4he,BatmanDavey1986,9,Sat Jul 11 00:52:19 2015 UTC,"The Terminator brand has been severely tainted by T3 and T:Salvation.  While JP3 was bad, it was so long ago that it's easily forgotten by the general audience. And even though it paled in comparison to the original, I bet kids at the time loved JP3 - and those young adults now rushed to see it.  Also, the box office was slow, and audiences were feeling a little letdown over what was supposed to rule the summer (Avengers 2).  Salvation was just 6 years ago and another Terminator reboot/side-boot/whatever-the-hell is old hat at this point.  There are a bevy of reasons, but the most obvious one is probably that JW looked like a good time at the movies, while T:Genisys looked like a reheated piece of shit with Arnie embarrassing himself."
boxoffice,3ct4he,GoddammitCricket,6,Fri Jul 10 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"I thought Avengers 2 was going to be huge and would even surpass the the first Avengers. While Avengers 2 was a big box office success, no way in hell would I expect Furious 7 or Jurassic World to make way more money than Avengers 2. Also, after Furious 7 came out, there was no way in hell I thought Jurassic World would even surpass Furious 7 or even the first Avengers. I knew Jurassic World would be a hit but I thought it would just max out at 900 mil - 1.2 billion worldwide and  even then I thought I was being extremely generous and optimistic for Jurassic World."

boxoffice,3ct4he,labbla,3,Fri Jul 10 23:50:41 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say Time Travel has completely ruined the Terminator franchise.  It's just way too complicated now and I don't care about the stakes in any of the movies.
boxoffice,3ct4he,mythmaster,6,Sat Jul 11 12:28:25 2015 UTC,Terminator Genisys is a terrible movie and no one really cared for another sequel. Jurassic World meanwhile has a lot of hype since its been 14 years since the last Jurassic Park and people are suddenly craving dinosaurs wrecking shit up again. Also marketing was bad for Terminator but it was good for Jurassic World and Jurassic World got better reviews and a bunch of parents brought their kids to see that movie. I don't think parents would bring their kids to a Terminator movie since the franchise is known for being violent and bloody and for being rated R. The PG-13 rating in Genisys just got rid of a bunch or violent or other mature stuff that could have made the movie awesome and it didnt help since all the youngsters would just watch Jurassic World or Inside Out instead.
boxoffice,3ct4he,Asdyc,4,Fri Jul 10 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"Branding. The Jurassic sequels never lived up to their potential, and people love dinosaurs like you wouldn't believe. Plus Pratt, and a good marketing push and decent reviews, locked it in.   Meanwhile there hadn't been a good Terminator in 24 years, they seemed to make every wrong move possible from casting to trailers to the final marketing push, and critics savaged the final product.  It's a shame. I'm in the (probably vast) minority who liked Gynysys and hated World, but thems the breaks."
boxoffice,3ct4he,pajamalamaobama,4,Fri Jul 10 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"It's been longer without a sequel, the trailers didn't spoil much compared to T:G, more mass appeal, better reception from both critics and audiences, better marketing, and overall just a much better film."
boxoffice,3ct4he,WirelessSurvivor,2,Fri Jul 10 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"And if you go by the reviews both arent really good movies.   No, most critics liked Jurassic World (71% RT).  Anyway, even though they're both franchise sequels they represent very different approaches. Jurassic World had zero returning major characters from the previous movies, and did something we've never seen before: showed us Jurassic Park as an actual amusement park. I had an overall negative reaction to the trailer but it still made me want to see the movie for that alone.  Genisys was yet another variation of the first two Terminators with almost entirely returning main characters. The trailer didn't promise anything we haven't seen already, just a bunch of callbacks and a very old Arnold. This approach to another Jurassic Park movie would've been to bring back Sam Neill or Jeff Goldblum and have it be about a vacant or destroyed park again, IE JP 2 and 3. I doubt that would've been nearly as successful.  But I think this speaks to the fact that Jurassic Park just has a lot more legs as a franchise. Its star is the dinosaurs, not any particular actor or character. That was the misunderstanding of JP 2 and 3 that Jurassic World corrected."

By 2017 im sure Avatar 2 will make $600m+ because the potential is unlimited. With this in mind it will break $2 Billion without much problem and might have a chance of rivaling Avatar 1

boxoffice,3com6z,mrstickball,3,Thu Jul 9 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"Overseas really, really, doesn't have 3D fatigue. Avatar plays perfectly into what overseas wants - a big showy, graphical powerhouse.

I think we could see the sequel surpass the original because the international market has grown so much in the past few years and that's where Avatar really made its money.   Although it's no big deal if it doesn't, the first made enough money that all three films could make nothing and they'd still be in the black."
boxoffice,3com6z,writer239,3,Thu Jul 9 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I see it doing very similar numbers, possibly even more if it's well reviewed and gets great word of mouth. You also have to factor in increased ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings, which Cameron tailored the first movie to and with good reason. To this day, Avatar is still one of the best theater experiences I've ever had, and I'll be seeing Avatar 2 in IMAX 3D opening night.   Now you've got higher frame rate, which has been proven to be a draw seeing as how the Hobbit films utilized it and made tons of money, along with underwater environments and other goodies?   Slam dunk win."

China has grown 327% in the 4 years since Avatar released. You can look at other Asian markets that have grown a ton since then (like Hong Kong and South Korea) and I think its close to a lock for $2b internationally..

boxoffice,3com6z,Defengar,6,Thu Jul 9 18:00:26 2015 UTC,Add in the fact that Cameron likely won't let his film be so all over the damn place with effects quality like Jackson was with the hobbit films (which becomes even more apparent at high FPS).

boxoffice,3com6z,capdeporc2005,2,Fri Jul 10 07:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I certainly think that the most likely outcome will be that it will not reach the same gross, at least domestically.  The first was attended, in good part, by people who wanted to know what all the damn fuss was about regarding Cameron's supposedly revolutionary technologies and techniques. They're a wild card—they could come back, or they could have had enough.  Still though, Cameron has developed a certain aura. A lot of people wonder about what he'll do next. So while it may not be likely that A2 will match the first one's gross, it wont be a huge surprise if it does.  Also, the actual quality will be critical. Repeat viewings are what make and break boxoffice records."

Gallows does have competition (like Jurassic world for example but not in the horror genre) but word of mouth opening weekend for teen crowds has little to no effect unfortunately but long term it's done on it's first week. http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4081&p=.htm"

HWR estimated that China would surpass Japan as the 2nd largest box office by 2015. In 2014, China grossed about $4.8 billion vs. Japan at about $1.9 billion.

I'm not saying anywhere close to $200M, but the $130-160M range doesn't seem out of the question. It also doesn't have much in the way of competition: the last big hits (Inside Out/JW) came out weeks ago; the weekend's other releases (Self/Less & Gallows) are non-factors; and last week's July 4th releases (Magic Mike XXL & Terminator: Genisys) are sinking like a stone.

I saw minions a few weeks ago in a packed theatre and honestly there weren't a lot of laughs throughout the movie plenty of kids not much laughs. I've spoken to more people who would honestly take there kids to see Jurassic World over Minions or Inside Out is a popular choice in the young family sector at the moment. Minions has a franchise that's why it will do so well. It was a disappointment to be honest with you a long movie for 90 mins. Minions on RT has dropped from 72% to 54% as so has imdb score (if you want to include imdb). It's a kids movie that has it going for it now that's it really and the brand name.

boxoffice,3cpmvn,jburd22,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:41:53 2015 UTC,Hmmm.  I think it will go much higher but we shall see.
boxoffice,3cpmvn,jburd22,2,Sat Jul 11 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"Everyone has taken their kids to see Inside Out in the last couple weeks and Minion fatigue has got to be setting in at this point, I doubt it will outperform DM2 which made $83 million in it's opening weekend."
boxoffice,3cpmvn,Mybrainmelts,13,Thu Jul 9 20:03:43 2015 UTC,I could be wrong about $120M but it will DEFINITELY outperform DM2.
boxoffice,3cpmvn,Yeah_Okay_Sure,3,Thu Jul 9 20:06:50 2015 UTC,DM2 did open over a 5 day period so it's hard to compare. If it only had a 3 day opener it would have certainly topped 100 mil.
boxoffice,3cpmvn,Mybrainmelts,2,Thu Jul 9 21:21:37 2015 UTC,Indeed. $143m over 5 days. Minions could beat that.
boxoffice,3cpmvn,Mybrainmelts,3,Thu Jul 9 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure, I know most are predicting this will top DM2, but I honestly highly doubt that. I'm not saying that it can't happen, hell I wouldn't be shocked if it opened to 145 mil over the 3 days, it's just my gut feeling is that it won't be as big as people think. Now there are a lot of factors that go into my gut feeling (more of an educated guess really) but it is a gut feeling none the less. But hey, after Jurassic World last month, it seems like every rule of the box office has been flipped on its head (JW and IO being MONSTER hits, Ted 2 and Terminator being massive flops, etc.)"
boxoffice,3cpmvn,mi-16evil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:24:39 2015 UTC,I think it will top DM2's 3day of $80 something. $145mil.......maybe.   $120m...yeah.

boxoffice,3coy97,NeilPoonHandler,17,Thu Jul 9 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"The two films, both of which have October release dates, will be allowed to play in theaters exclusively until the number of screens showing the pictures drops to 300 or less. At that point, the clock will start ticking on the pending home entertainment release.   That actually sounds very reasonable. There is absolutely no reason for movies that are very front-loaded and/or bomb to stay in theaters for three months. Take Tomorrowland, for example. At this point it has earned what it could earn and could safely be released on home video. On the other hand movies that keep earning money can stay longer in theaters."
boxoffice,3coy97,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:17:47 2015 UTC,What's amazing is child 44 bombed and it's still in theaters
boxoffice,3coy97,Mybrainmelts,4,Fri Jul 10 20:54:17 2015 UTC,Paramount is sweetening the pot by offering theater chains who show the film a percentage of the studio’s digital revenue for the period of digital and cable on-demand availability through the first three months from the initial U.S. theatrical release.   I think it's smart of them to try to appease the theaters. Time will tell whether it works or not.
boxoffice,3coy97,department4c,5,Thu Jul 9 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"It's nice for us consumers, but I believe it could still hurt theatres in the long run.

boxoffice,3coy97,Dorkside,4,Thu Jul 9 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"I think this change would be great for us moviegoers but I don't see how this wouldn't adversely impact the money that is made on movies. Unless it is the type of movie that has big screen appeal (aka visually impressive), the shorter the window to from theater to home release, the more likely people just stay at home come release date."
boxoffice,3coy97,cbbbluedevil,2,Thu Jul 9 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"This actually is a smart deal. I'm presuming from the article that this would probably be a trial of some sort and be on smaller release movies than big blockbuster for now. If you think about it theres no reason to have a movie in theatres for so long if it's not performing well at all. Look at the first 6 months of this year alone we have had bombs like Jupiter Ascending, mordecai, blackhat, hot tub time machine 2 and so on. At the end of the day it's probably costing more to show the movie than the returns are for the showing. It's a win win for consumers and theatre chains have more screens to show more independent/ smaller movies or more sessions for big hits like Jurassic World or something like that."

boxoffice,3cm9ju,stoicblunder,8,Thu Jul 9 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"I think it will open around 70-80. Overall reviews are good right now, especially among comic book fans. I think the numbers will go up as more ""non-critics"" add on. This isn't a movie geared for critics. It is tooled as a summer movie and looks to have humor and action. Add to it that it is a MCU movie, and that it has above average to good reviews, as well as a solid ensemble cast, and I think it will be a hit."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,Yeah_Okay_Sure,17,Thu Jul 9 03:12:06 2015 UTC,At this point not many people let critic reviews determine weather they want to watch a movie or not. Jurassic world got a 71% on rotten tomatoes and yet EVERYONE went to watch it. Ant man's only worry is not to be hurt by minions
boxoffice,3cm9ju,Shruth1,11,Thu Jul 9 00:51:24 2015 UTC,"Woah woah woah, Jurassic World was an already huge and established franchise, with a way bigger star than Ant-Man (sorry Rudd but Pratt could play the Queen of England right now).

boxoffice,3cm9ju,derpyco,6,Thu Jul 9 04:22:36 2015 UTC,Pratt had starred in one hit movie before Jurassic World and I think you're underestimating the following Rudd has.

boxoffice,3cm9ju,Lolzafish,-2,Sun Jul 12 15:31:41 2015 UTC,Rudd doesn't have ANY following.
boxoffice,3cm9ju,newuser40,9,Thu Jul 9 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man isn't going to make $200 million obviously, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Pratt wasn't the main reason people went to see JW. It was the brand. And Ant-Man has as big of a brand as JW does, mitigated by over-saturation like you said, sure, but at this point Marvel has proven fairly well that people will see their movies no matter what."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,Prax150,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:19 2015 UTC,Marvel superhero movies are a larger and more established franchise than Jurassic park ever was. Remember the merchandising for the first Jurassic park? It started shelf space with marvel stuff 20 years before the first iron man.
boxoffice,3cm9ju,Highside79,4,Thu Jul 9 14:52:23 2015 UTC,I think critic reviews matter far less but word of mouth matters much more. Pretty much all my friends on social media and in person were raving about Jurassic World. I think that had a huge effect on the box office.
boxoffice,3cm9ju,taylorswiftfan123,6,Thu Jul 9 01:40:04 2015 UTC,Even the people that didnt like Jurassic World still saw the movie due to all the hype and buzz surrounding it.

People won't rely on the critics for transformers because they already know what they are getting. Same with Jurassic world. Plus 71% is not a particularly bad score. They'll rely on the critics more for ant-man because it's not a familiar property. Guardians of the galaxy wouldn't have done nearly as well if the critics didn't review it positively. Plus Paul Rudd is not a big box office draw."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,mardfet,3,Thu Jul 9 15:14:27 2015 UTC,Dropped from 72 to 61 in a few hours. I see mid 50s for this one.

boxoffice,3cm9ju,swellipop,3,Thu Jul 9 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"At this point in time the opening weekend numbers won't be affected really as Ant man is a marvel movie and they do have a hot streak going. But, if it continues to get mixed reviews from critics and if it gets anywhere from a B+ downward on cinemascore and imdb isn't as high as it usually is it will have some effect in the long run. Schmoes Know just put there review up and they gave it 4.5/5 to say Vanity Fair gave I think 2/5. That's very polarising results for marvel at this point seeing they have had critical and financial hit's like winter soldier, guardians and the first avengers it seems ant man could end up between thor:dark world (65%) and the incredible hulk (67%) both small box office successes compared to guardians and winter solider. Seeing as 2015 is killed or be killed and something new every week this summer Ant man could ever dominate like Jurassic World (but I don't think it will pull Jurassic World numbers but you never know) or fumble like Terminator Genysis. It's very hard to know what will be hit's and not's in the critical sphere this year as Jurassic world and Furious 7 scored low 70's to 80's and where big hits but I think theres more to those stories."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,6373billy,3,Thu Jul 9 15:59:28 2015 UTC,I think it will go between 70-80% considering only 25 reviewers have reviewed it and Captain America: The First Avenger started with 40% and ended with 79%.
boxoffice,3cm9ju,Highside79,3,Thu Jul 9 16:04:23 2015 UTC,"I hope it does get in the 70-80% range. I didn't know the first Captain America movie started that low. From the sounds of all the reviews I've read/seen it is trying to be a heist movie rather than a super hero movie which is actually a good thing to blend the two together, let's just hope with more reviews going to come out there positive it's only a small portion of people who have seen it/reviewed it yet"
boxoffice,3cm9ju,Prax150,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:12:01 2015 UTC,It's a b-list hero movie coming out at a time where is getting fashionable to trash comic book movies. The reviews are going to trend low no matter how good the movie is.

We'll have to wait and see.  But even so, I doubt the critic over at Variety was chomping at the bit to review this one, and yet they've given a positive review. I don't think that just because it's their job to see the movie that they'll dislike it - from what I've seen so far of the reviews I think it might actually be a pretty solid entry in the Marvel catalog."

boxoffice,3cm9ju,GoldandBlue,2,Fri Jul 10 00:19:09 2015 UTC,Figure Rudd is going to do for Antman what Chris Pratt did for Guardians.  He is very liked charming persona and would single handedly boost the opening by at least 20-25%
boxoffice,3cm9ju,swellipop,3,Fri Jul 10 20:20:42 2015 UTC,Except Rudd is already seen as a non draw in Hollywood. He is a very likable actor but he can't carry a movie.

boxoffice,3cm9ju,GoldandBlue,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:33:54 2015 UTC,Many women will see this movie just because of Paul rudd. Sure he's not a big draw in hollywood but he has a huge female fan following who will see anything he is in.
boxoffice,3cm9ju,swellipop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:17:12 2015 UTC,Trainwreck also opens that weekend and will likely do better with women than Ant-Man. It also has a significantly higher RT score.
boxoffice,3cm9ju,GoldandBlue,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:09:09 2015 UTC,I agree but then again only 9 people have reviewed it and IMDb has given it a rating of 5.9 while Ant Man has 8.3 on IMDb and 25 people have reviewed it with many still crying over Edgar Wright leaving the project.  I don't know maybe women will see both and Ant Man is more appealing to kid so women wouldn't really hesitate going into the theatre feeling they have no reason to watch it other than their kids.
boxoffice,3cm9ju,swellipop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:21:22 2015 UTC,"IMDb   That might as well be Yelp or Amazon reviews. IMDb is just users reviewing it, many of which have not seen the movie. Same goes for Trainwreck. Shawshank is rated higher than the Godfather for crying out loud. I know critics are ""all snobs"" but I take the opinion of people who actually know films (and have actually seen the movie) over some 12 year old who still laughs every time someone says boobies, or just hates Amy Schumer and gave the film zero stars just because."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,GoldandBlue,2,Thu Jul 9 10:24:12 2015 UTC,"yeah, I guess I like having opinions of my own rather than getting influenced by some 'knower of films' who has given interstellar 72%, Kingsman 74%, captain America the first avenger 79% and even Iron Man 3 which has 79% (which many fans of Marvel or even casual movie goers will agree is absolute crap).   Many people are saying it's in top 5 MCU films. So, Even on RT I am pretty sure Ant Man gonna go up. Captain America the first Avenger started on 40% and ended up on 79%."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,swellipop,2,Thu Jul 9 10:46:57 2015 UTC,"I am not saying you shouldn't have opinions of your own. I am saying that I trust the opinions of critics over random internet users when I have not seen a movie. If I am on the fence on whether to see the new Mission Impossible and I will put more stock into a 61% RT score than an 8.6 IMDB score.                    And that is what we are discussing are we not? RT is not a measure of how good a movie is but a general consensus on how many people gave it a good review. Put it like this, right now 6 out of 10 critics say Ant Man is worth seeing. It does not measure whether they say it is OK or amazing, just whether it is worth seeing. Whereas IMDB has 1600 users giving it a 8/10. Do you really think 1600 people have seen Ant-Man already?                 That is why I put no stock in IMDB. 7 out of 10 critics say Interstellar, Kingsman, and Iron Man 3 is worth watching. That makes sense. But a near 9 score on IMDB for Interstellar? I mean i give it credit for ambition but it is a flawed movie. Why is IMDB so skewed? Because you have a bunch of people just blindly giving everything zeroes and tens."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,swellipop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:55:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think I ever said I prefer/trust Imdb over RT and I agree with everything you said here. I just said I don't let anyone influence my opinion, even RT because sometimes they are wrong too especially when it comes to fun films. Especially for this film because a lot of critics who gave it a bad rating were not even judging the film for what it was. In nearly every negative review, you will find them saying how Edgar might have done it better."
boxoffice,3cm9ju,Mybrainmelts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:20:03 2015 UTC,"I know people who didn't like interstellar and kingsman. I myself couldn't really stand cap 1. Thought it was hoaky. And it's reflected in the box office. Interstellar, while still a success, was Christopher nolans worst box office performance since batman begins. Jurrassic world may have a 71% but every one of those critics says the same thing. Stupid but fun. Just because the critics don't represent your taste in film, doesn't mean that they don't represent the general audiences taste in film. If it bothers you, find a particular critic that aligns with you, and follow them instead."
boxoffice,3cls0t,Ehan2,3,Wed Jul 8 22:12:51 2015 UTC,"I wish they would expand the movie more and advertise it more.  It fits perfectly with the ""Fault in our Stars"" crowd I'd say.  Maybe not quite on the same level as that film production value-wise, but it's up there.  I've seen it, I'm lucky to live in a city that got it the first weekend.  It's an excellent film.  Lots of interesting camera work.  The emotional climax of the story is very well done.  For me, I knew what was coming, it was inevitable, but it kind of snuck up on me and then flooded over me.  It was a pretty emotional punch to the gut for me.  It's going to be one of my favorites from the year I think.  I wish they would market it more, more people need to see this film.  I think maybe they are hoping for a long trajectory for the film instead of flooding the market."

boxoffice,3cjpim,Shruth1,10,Wed Jul 8 13:11:27 2015 UTC,"This feels like such a disingenuous comparison. Home Video wasn't even around until the 70s, the only way people could see these films was at the theatre.   Just my thoughts."
boxoffice,3cjpim,King_of_Fife,6,Wed Jul 8 14:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree.  It's very difficult to compare against other generations because the culture was different.    It's very similar when they compare old television numbers- ""MASH finale being the most watched TV show ever"" - well people didn't have cable then, so there were only like 5 options on TV then."
boxoffice,3cjpim,moochello,2,Wed Jul 8 15:40:44 2015 UTC,That doesn't diminish the fact that it was the most watched TV show of all time. Nor does is it diminish the fact that these movies were bigger and more culturally important than movies that come out today. It only serves to reiterate how fractured the market is in the contemporary era
boxoffice,3cjpim,d36williams,5,Wed Jul 8 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"Also, in 1965 there were roughly 194 million Americans and today there are over 320 million."
boxoffice,3cjpim,Dorkside,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:05:07 2015 UTC,I guess u got a point
boxoffice,3cjpim,HumbertHaze,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Also two out of the three high grossing movies he mentioned came out in late December, meaning most of their money would have been made in 1966"
boxoffice,3cjpim,department4c,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:35 2015 UTC,The way they account for revenue is based on the year the movie was released regardless of what year money was made in.
boxoffice,3cjpim,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:42:32 2015 UTC,Actually both Doctor Zhivago and The Sound of Music were in theaters for 4-5 years. The Sound of Music didn't even enter wide release until 1967!
boxoffice,3cjpim,voidsoul22,3,Thu Jul 9 11:40:39 2015 UTC,"Could you rewrite the headline in a way that doesn't make it sound like 2015 is competing with adjusted 1965?  Even if Star Wars 7 takes down Avatar it will be nowhere near 1B, and neither will Jurassic World."
boxoffice,3cjpim,voidsoul22,0,Wed Jul 8 20:08:20 2015 UTC,I mean just look at OS. Even if 2015 won't have as high grosses there will be more depth. Star wars with like $1.9 bil. Jurassic world with $1.7 bil. Furious 7 with $1.5 bil. Avengers 2 with $1.4 bil. Minions and hunger games 4 with over/under 1 bil. And spectre will also be $900m+ with a chance at 1 bil so the pool is more deep together so it is just as great imo
boxoffice,3cjpim,bry142,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:59:37 2015 UTC,"Those numbers are all worldwide grosses, with the inflation-adjusted projections being domestic."
boxoffice,3cjpim,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:08:35 2015 UTC,Yeah but I'm just showing you the greatness of both
boxoffice,3cjpim,elint,2,Wed Jul 8 23:46:05 2015 UTC,Less movies were released as well that is another factor of the success of the films.
boxoffice,3cjpim,HowlMoonstone183,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:32:31 2015 UTC,"True. The truth is the market was most saturated in the late 90's, early 00's"
boxoffice,3cjv25,thatchartshow,3,Wed Jul 8 14:01:02 2015 UTC,Dig the concept. Clips were way too long in my opinion if this is going to be a weekly segment. Found myself skipping each one to see the next one.

boxoffice,3ch63g,JakkuScavenger,7,Tue Jul 7 21:44:57 2015 UTC,Steven Spielburg is just amazing. Four original films in the this list. The man knows how to tell a tale.
boxoffice,3ch63g,jd7509,8,Wed Jul 8 07:51:42 2015 UTC,"When people say that Spielberg and Lucas created the modern blockbuster, they're not kidding. This is what the all-time domestic box office chart looked like by the end of Return of the Jedi's release. The top 6 are all films directed and/or produced by these two."
boxoffice,3ch63g,ninjaballs,5,Wed Jul 8 08:06:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Spielberg has 4, Cameron and Lucas - 2 each."
boxoffice,3ch63g,kevms,7,Wed Jul 8 07:56:50 2015 UTC,This is cool.
boxoffice,3ch63g,Republican_Atheist,5,Wed Jul 8 01:30:38 2015 UTC,This is awesome! Thanks for making this.
boxoffice,3ch63g,mealsharedotorg,6,Wed Jul 8 01:43:16 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to see a list like this for ages. I know a lot of work must have gone into it.   I think it's interesting that Avatar is the only film post-2000 to have made it in. I personally think we'll see it re-released alongside the sequels which might pump up its total gross.   I think original work like this should always be commended so enjoy the gold!
boxoffice,3ch63g,GoddammitCricket,4,Wed Jul 8 07:55:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, thanks. It took me about 2 hours. Once you get to movies released after 1977 it gets easier, because box office mojo has much more information about them. I was quite surprised that none of the Disney animations made it, but apparently they benefited immensely from re-releases."
boxoffice,3ch63g,voidsoul22,2,Wed Jul 8 08:04:56 2015 UTC,"Me, too.  This list is fantastic.  As someone who has casually watched box office number for more than 19 years (this August will mark 20 years since I was reading the entertainment section of the Friday edition of my local newspaper and noticed a section showing the previous weekend's gross receipts.  The following Friday it showed up again, and I was hooked), that only two post-2000 films make the list is exactly what I expected to see.    Titanic, Jurassic Park, Phantom Menace and Avatar are the only movies in my post-childhood lifetime to have generated the sort of cultural significance that it takes to make it onto these lists.  I mean, the reason they're called blockbusters is because of the line that used to wrap around the movie theater.  They truly have to be a once in a handful of years type of thing.  When I saw Jurassic Park, it was almost two months after it came out and my dad and I still had to split up and see it in different sides of the theater because it was sold out (we were a little late cause I spilled a coke in the car). When I saw Titanic the second time in theaters, it was week 9 and it was still a sold out show.  I have a video somewhere in the basement of walking the pre-sale line for Phantom Menace and it took 5 minutes to get to the end.  And most everyone on this site is old enough to remember the cultural significance of Avatar firsthand.  Making this list doesn't mean all the teenagers went and saw it.  It means grandmas came out to see it, hermits came out to see it, fans saw it 3 or more times, etc."
boxoffice,3ch63g,DaveFincher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"I have a video somewhere in the basement of walking the pre-sale line for Phantom Menace and it took 5 minutes to get to the end   Please post this if you get a chance. That would be awesome to see since most of us are too young to remember Phantom Menace well (I was 11 at the time, but didn't care about going to the movies then.)"
boxoffice,3ch63g,Jon-Osterman,2,Wed Jul 8 15:02:29 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Avengers is right outside the top 20 (probably #21), and Jurassic World will crack it within a month."
boxoffice,3ch63g,Jon-Osterman,2,Wed Jul 8 20:11:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Avengers is definitely #21 with $623 million, and at $605 and $603 million respectively Lion King and The Dark Knight are the only other movies with over $600 million."
boxoffice,3ch63g,Fidget08,6,Thu Jul 9 11:25:47 2015 UTC,"This is beautiful man, just beautiful. Brilliant work."
boxoffice,3ch63g,gaffney2010,2,Wed Jul 8 07:46:27 2015 UTC,Thanks!
boxoffice,3ch63g,mardfet,3,Wed Jul 8 07:47:34 2015 UTC,"/u/JakkuScavenger, you are cool beans. Do you think there's a chart of the timeline of highest grossing films based solely on original release?"
boxoffice,3ch63g,no_punch_line,2,Wed Jul 8 12:04:06 2015 UTC,"Uhm... If you mean not adjusted for inflation, it probably goes like The Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur, Doctor Zhivago, The Sound of Music, The Godfather, The Exorcist, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T., Titanic, Avatar.  Edit: Should be noted that Birth of a Nation is sometimes reported to have made $50m+. However, tickets were prices at $2.00, which at the time was 20 times the price of regular tickets."

boxoffice,3ch63g,Prax150,5,Thu Jul 9 08:46:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make sense to compare very old movies to new ones, does it?"
boxoffice,3ch63g,Shruth1,7,Wed Jul 8 02:53:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Nowadays movies make 30% of their total in a weekend. Before, they would be released in a few theaters and add a few at a time. No to mention it wasn't like, ""oh I'll just wait for it to come out on Redbox"" it was in the theater or not at all."
boxoffice,3ch63g,Shruth1,3,Wed Jul 8 14:41:08 2015 UTC,yeah especially considering it has been known for sometime that people are going to the movies at record lows.
boxoffice,3ch63g,ScriptSarge,4,Wed Jul 8 03:05:17 2015 UTC,"Well there's home media, pirating...  Why compare box office without home media today to box office during a time when there was effectively no home media?  People could only see Gone with the Wind in theaters, which is why it spent years or decades in theaters with lots of repeat viewers.  Box office inflation is much higher than regular inflation, so tickets are effectively more expensive.  So you're going to sell fewer tickets for more money per.  It doesn't make sense to take out the effect of the price change, but ignore the effect of that price change on consumer demand..."
boxoffice,3ch63g,gaffney2010,6,Wed Jul 8 06:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, Gone with the Wind in particular was re-released 10 times. Star Wars was released in 1977 and then re-released in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982 before it was released on VHS and then one more time in 1997."

boxoffice,3ch63g,Shruth1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:38 2015 UTC,Cool data! I find it interesting. And just wondering did you get the idea to make this post after reading my comment about this in the other post?
boxoffice,3ch63g,Shruth1,2,Wed Jul 8 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"I've seen people ask the question ""but how much money did it make on its original release adjusted for inflation"" several times on this sub."

Minions opened about £10m here, so that's $100+ in the US (we use an approx 10:1 ratio as a ballpark).  It's held in quite well in the second weekend as well."
boxoffice,3chhww,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:18:38 2015 UTC,"The difference being that we already have Inside Out in NA, which will take at least a small chunk out of Minions."
boxoffice,3chhww,Prax150,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:47:35 2015 UTC,Did Pixar plan to release Inside Out after the Minions hype died out? That is pretty smart of them. Inside Out is one of Pixar's biggest hits in the US but the movie isn't making much worldwide. Is there still a lot of countries where Inside Out havent been released yet?
boxoffice,3chhww,Asdyc,2,Wed Jul 8 23:05:19 2015 UTC,"Is there still a lot of countries where Inside Out havent been released yet?   Upcoming release:   Japan is a pretty huge market for Pixar (MU made $90m there and IO might get a boost from Frozen) China on July ( I think it's only competition is Shaun the sheep as Minions won't get any theatrical release) And there's some notable countries too yet to be released (UK, Germany, Korea, etc.)   Source: imdb"

boxoffice,3chhww,newuser40,2,Wed Jul 8 19:48:50 2015 UTC,I agree. Minions will be huge (not only of box office numbers but also on merch) regardless of its reviews.   Proof? Cars 2

boxoffice,3cfg7w,RogerSmith123456,3,Tue Jul 7 17:21:38 2015 UTC,It would need to gross like $120+ million in Japan.  I don't see that happening.
boxoffice,3cfg7w,RogerSmith123456,3,Tue Jul 7 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, about $117m. I was referring to Japan + Int'l holdovers. I think it's about done everywhere else which is why it's unlikely."
boxoffice,3cfg7w,mrstickball,2,Tue Jul 7 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"Its making maybe $1m internationally per week outside of Japan.   The biggest issue for Japan is that the yen-USD rate is TERRIBLE. Its down 35% from when The Avengers released, so if it had a similar ticket to USD ratio as TA, we'd probably be looking at $100m."
boxoffice,3cfn9x,mardfet,7,Tue Jul 7 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is not fair because movies like gone with the wind which has a ""1.6 billion domestic gross"" were in theaters for YEARS. Not only did they play forever but they got so many re releases. It is not a fair comparison and only movie grosses in their first run should be compared. Unfortunetly before 1980 or so, they did not keep track of re releases and the number of re releases for movies such as star wars was not recorded and can only be estimated. That's why movies after this should only count and everything before this should be forgotten because of no information of re releases. IMO all the records prior to the year 2000 should be wiped and we should start fresh from 2000 (sorry titanic). 2,000 onwards provided a good measurment of inflation and re releases both in US and Oversees"
boxoffice,3cfn9x,Shruth1,3,Tue Jul 7 17:24:07 2015 UTC,"Avatar might be #14 if adjusted for inflation but if you only count the original releases, which will never be accuretly meseaured, then it will definetly be #10 or even #5 adjusted"

Agreed, but the fascination with #1 has existed for ages, and at least the general public would want to follow the event films. On a slightly unrelated note, everyone knows Neil Armstrong was the first man to step on the moon? But who's second? Ignorant, but popular answer.  Additionally, most box office records will be crushed in a matter of few years anyway. But the numbers generated today makes for a fun conversation and/or analysis and that's the reason why at least I follow the numbers."

boxoffice,3cfn9x,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only reason it hasn't happened yet is that ticket price inflation has slowed down a bit since 2012."

People's obsession with feeling like box office numbers are misleading is a bit puzzling to me.   Yeah, so some older movies had more admission, but there was absolutely no form of home video. So that boosts numbers for theater admissions, while detracting in today's, while also giving another source of revenue.   It's like....who cares? Times is changed."

boxoffice,3cfn9x,el-condor-pasa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"As much as I find box office records entertaining I sometimes wonder if some movies are really as popular as the numbers would suggest when compared to the decades-past. Specifically, it would be very interesting to see which films filled the most seats, disregarding their ticket price.  Prices vary from different regions and with the popularity surge for IMAX, premium (RPX, et al), and 3D - any of which can cost double or more the price of a standard ticket. What's worse is we are in a several-year trend where thet big releases pigeon-hole movie goers into the more expensive showings. Most recently I saw Jurassic World opening weekend and on that Friday there were only 4 showtimes the entire day for 2D but 30+ for 3D. So while I don't have a problem with films being released in 3D or premium theater experiences (often go this route myself) I am curious to see how things rank when you count heads instead of dollars."
boxoffice,3cfn9x,roth403b,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:48:20 2015 UTC,"I wish they would track tickets sold.  Bodies in seats is a much more interesting metric to me. How many people actually came out to see it??  Ticket prices, 3D premium, yearly inflation, etc, skews the records.  Imagine if instead of saying ""this movie made $100million in a day!"" We said ""100 million people came to watch the movie, that's 1 of every 3 Americans!!"" It would be so much more interesting.   You would know a real movie event has taken place when 1 out of every 3 people you see has watched that movie over the weekend, then an arbitrary number that keeps changing.  Just my 2 cents. :)"
boxoffice,3cg35i,RogerSmith123456,6,Tue Jul 7 17:14:26 2015 UTC,Not likely. It could hold up but the following week trainwreck and ant man is going to take most of the audience away.
boxoffice,3cg35i,bry142,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:16:30 2015 UTC,"How much of the audience is really the same though? Minions appeals to really young kids, so a lot of parents will still be taking them to go see it. Trainwreck if an R-rated comedy. At worst Antman has a little bit of a spillover but not much. I think it'll hold decently well."
boxoffice,3cg35i,Prax150,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:03:59 2015 UTC,Trainwreck will take away some of the older audience. Ant man got the curiosity factor.

boxoffice,3cg35i,Prax150,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:25:57 2015 UTC,I would of say the older couples that needed a laugh. You may be right about the minions its opening is pretty high. I seriously doubt it will drop more than 50 percent next week.
boxoffice,3cg35i,bry142,8,Sat Jul 11 20:39:43 2015 UTC,I really doubt it. I'm thinking it'll open to >90 million but fall to less than 50 which will put it under Ant-Man but above Trainwreck.
boxoffice,3cg35i,taylorswiftfan123,5,Tue Jul 7 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Yeah ant man will beat it
boxoffice,3cg35i,Shruth1,4,Tue Jul 7 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"This isn't a crazy question... Minions opens over $100 ($110m Toy Story number??), and can still probably make $60m+ on its second weekend. I've learned not to bet against Marvel, but so far tracking isn't lighting up on Ant-Man like other superhero titles. Right now, looking like Ant could do fifties..."
boxoffice,3cg35i,TheTownDevil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:39:57 2015 UTC,Bingo. That's why this question is worth consideration....
boxoffice,3cg35i,Gamb1993,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:47:52 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure if Minions will do that well,  I think it'll make around $90m opening weekend. Reviews for it are fairly meh, and I think by Sunday definitely that'll hit it, and might see IO not drop as hard as some think it will against Minions.  Those reviews will hurt it second week too, I can't see it holding on by more than 50%, which even with the possible $100m opening would likely see it fall below Ant-Man's opening."
boxoffice,3cg35i,TheTownDevil,4,Tue Jul 7 23:16:28 2015 UTC,Kids don't read reviews...and Minions are like crack to these little ones. How much do you expect Ant-Man to open to?
boxoffice,3cg35i,Gamb1993,2,Wed Jul 8 00:20:50 2015 UTC,"True, but parents do. IO and JW are still out, they could hit it if parents go see that instead with their kids. Plus meh word of mouth could affect it in its second weekend too.  From what I've read Ant-Man's tracking at around $55-65m,  which I could see happening. The liklihood is it'll bite into the Minions box office, causing a somewhat larger drop than expected.  Then again I could easily be wrong, my predictions are rarely correct."
boxoffice,3cg35i,TheTownDevil,2,Wed Jul 8 07:01:34 2015 UTC,Parents don't care though. Their kids like the toys and ads.

boxoffice,3cg35i,TheTownDevil,2,Wed Jul 8 13:45:50 2015 UTC,"Antman is looking to open at 65M+ even if Minions had a 100 million opening weekend, it has to have a 35% drop or less to hold on to its spot which is highly unlikely."
boxoffice,3cg35i,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:00:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, that scenario is unlikely. However, I'm starting to think that Ant opens to less than $60, which means a Minions 2nd wkd drop of -40%, which now isn't that crazy.....hence the debate. Oh well, we'll all know soon enough"
boxoffice,3cg35i,FockerFGAA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:40:16 2015 UTC,Where are you seeing $65M+? I agree with you.  $65-75m  Minions: A $120M OW isn't out of the question. Marketing has been great.  Trainwreck - low $20s OW  Paper Towns - $30s OW  Pixels - low $40s OW
boxoffice,3cg35i,6373billy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:30:08 2015 UTC,I think Train Wreck (which is getting good reviews) will hurt Ant-Man more than Minions.  Minions could be coming off a $100m+ weekend   I see it being close. (within $10 million)

boxoffice,3cg35i,SpaceshipWeirdo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, having seen the movie a few weeks ago I do feel it is probably the weakest kids movie (compared to Inside Out) there is out. The reason why it's going to pull audiences in is because of a franchise, it's a long movie I thought and isn't necessarily for adults mainly aimed at children. Next week though Ant man and Train wrecked come out and both have there audiences (Marvel and Judd Apatow) but it will be interesting to see the numbers on train wrecked."

boxoffice,3cc9s0,mrdinosaur,2,Tue Jul 7 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yes I will agree it makes no sense. Many people have a lot data to back that up, but data is only half the battle at best. One of the reason's I love analyzing box office returns is that they so unpredictable. Culture is dynamic and people are incredibly fickle. The pure data says Compton won't open over 20 at best. But there is a whole ocean of cultural knowledge and recent history that suggests otherwise. Who knows, it could totally bomb as well."
boxoffice,3cc9s0,trapper2530,2,Tue Jul 7 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I love predictions to be totally shattered, either by underperforming or by overperforming. Like you said, the box office is affected by so many cultural and historical influences that even the most researched and polled estimates can be totally off. In many ways, box office analysis, trying to figure out 'why did this happen' rather than 'what will happen to this,' can be more fascinating and telling of human nature and what makes people go to the movies."

boxoffice,3cc9s0,TheGreatScalabrine,2,Mon Jul 6 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people saying that $54 is really low, but I think it sounds pretty much on target. Just look at the previous installments: MI: 1 = $45m MI: 2 = $57.8m MI: 3 = $47.7m MI: GP = $12m (limited release, when opened wide on Christmas it did about 44m more)   I know there's barely any competition for this latest installment but I'm not seeing what could lead to an opening that's almost $20m more than MI:2."
boxoffice,3cc9s0,heyheyhedgehog,2,Tue Jul 14 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"MI1 had the second biggest opening of the year, and MI2 had the biggest opening of the year so with inflation those two would be much more now adays then the figure you're providing. MI3 was a step down which is understandable after how bad MI2 was, and Mi4 opened in limited like you said, which is also the biggest limited release of all time, and then played all week and expanded so it did lose a bit of steam by the following weekend. When you take all these things into consideration people expect this one to open to much bigger numbers. Thing about the Mission series is they also have great legs. MI4 had amazing legs. If MI5 opens to 54 like predicted and has great reviews I don't see why it couldn't reach 180-200 domestically."
boxoffice,3cc9s0,RogerSmith123456,2,Tue Jul 14 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"All fair points, and I don't disagree about MI5 having amazing legs. Just not sure if everything you outlined there will get it to 60 or 70. But we shall see, and thanks for your valuable input!"

No one on that massive orbiting spacedock that was seen like 45 minutes ago in the movie noticing a huge raging space battle essentially right next to them? Parking a spaceship on the bottom of the ocean for the sake of VFX? Even in the movie, they claim it's because they 'need to hide'. The fuck?

boxoffice,3c9rx2,edisonog,8,Mon Jul 6 06:28:30 2015 UTC,Yes very true but that doesn't answer OP's question. The marketing has been massive. The trailer has been in front of every film I've seen since March including some adult films. One of the July 4th snapchat filters was the three main minions. They're all over everything everywhere. At what point are they wasting money because awareness has saturated the market?

Despicable (2010--$543m) and Despicable 2(2013--$970m) were the ones which ended this drought.   Furios 7 was a surprise and Jurassic Park has also came as a super-surprise.

Basically, when they know a movie will be a guaranteed hit, they hammer it home to make it MASSIVE.   If they're skeptics on a movies performance, dumping tons of money into it may just be a waste. It's riskier. You dump tons of money into Jurassic World/ Minions, cut co-marketing deals (possible that very little money exchanged hands between the like of Dairy Queen / McDonald's as both businesses hope to benefit)."

Maybe people know him from having seen his face on DVD covers of direct-to-DVD trash bins, but that's about it.  American comedies don't work at all here (Europe). Think of any big comedy hit in the US recently? It will either be direct-to-DVD/VOD or struggle to not be cancelled on week 2 despite a limited release. Ben Stiller works sometimes, Jim Carrey worked, that's about it.  Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, etc... are associated with vulgar, crass and dumb movies, not as funny nor good actors/directors.

boxoffice,3c7uz9,arkain123,7,Mon Jul 6 04:22:57 2015 UTC,I think that GOTG showed that comic fanbases mean little at the moment. Plenty of people will just go for the next Marvel movie even if it's about Speedball.

They actually looked like they would do better than this considering they weren't up against Dreamworks or Blue Sky. Just unfortunate for them that these unexpected hits came out of nowhere. Inside Out really deserves any profit it gets. Easily the best movie I've seen in a while.

You have to make movies for everyone and not just one certain country.  If US critics don't like your movie it doesn't mean the movie is bad and vice versa.  It allows good movies that are disliked in US to make good money elsewhere with audience that might appreciate them.

It's funny how when JP first came out critics said 'Yeah, cool FX but not much of a story and full of flat characters.'  Now JP is iconic for its distinct if thinly drawn characters and a very, very quotable script.  Terminator hasn't had that kind of re-appraisal. The one-liners honestly have remained in peoples' memories more than the films themselves.  For what it's worth all of the above is mostly speculation.

The worldwide boxoffice numbers mean a lot.  Genysis made 130m dollars already....and it has a budget of..what ? 150m ?  I am pretty sure Terminator can easily pass 300m dollar when it's all said and done.  And doubling on its budget seems like an alright deal to me.
boxoffice,3c6ppj,kplo,8,Sun Jul 5 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"But, and I'm surprised that this isn't commonly held knowledge in this this sub by now.....  Global Box Office yields less to the studios than domestic via distribution cuts, profit sharing, and other reasons.   Marketing, Marketing, Marketing. We rarely know the total cost of marketing, but it inflates the actual cost of the movie by 10s if not 100s  million dollars.   300 million is NOT good for Terminator.   150 million budget, maybe another 100 million in advertising....and global box office yielding less profit.   AND the studios cant simply break even on movies, they depend on making a multiple of their investment. Not to mention Paramount is in a world of hurt for franchises.   They and Universal lack comic book properties that Disney and Warner are pumping out with a reckless abandon.   Universal scored huge this year with a bunch of non comic properties, and while that may be part of the reason for success (finally some comic fatigue) Paramount really only has Mission Impossible and Transformers."
boxoffice,3c6ppj,PixelMagic,4,Sun Jul 5 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"As a general rule that never fails, a Hollywood success is the revealed budget multiplied by 2.5. 100 million budget is a success if it does 250 million dollars.

For some films, like Unfriended, the P&A budget will greatly surpass the the production budget. Blockbuster sequels tend to have lower spends than the launch film because of previous penetration.   Forget actual distribution costs, these days all you have to do is stream the film onto a server at the theater via satellite or deliver a hard drive. Marketing costs are the real costs when it comes to releasing a movie.   There is no real source to find P&A numbers because it's not in a studio's interest to release that data."

According to IMDb, it made $20 million on its original release, $11 million in its 1941 re-release and $4 million in its 1942 re-release (source). If we use boxofficemojo's formula, that would give us:  ($20m/0.25)x8.12 = $649.6m on original release in today's dollars."
boxoffice,3c3eg3,JakkuScavenger,8,Sat Jul 4 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"BOM explain on their website how they adjust for inflation:   In most cases you can calculate the estimated number of tickets sold for a given movie by taking its box office gross and dividing it by the average ticket price at the time it was released. To adjust it for inflation (or see what it might have made in the past), you then multiply the estimated number of tickets sold by the average ticket price of the year you are converting to.  In some cases we are able to obtain the actual number of tickets sold and we use that figure to base adjustments off of (apart from its reported gross). Usually this is the case with older movies, especially those released in the 30s and 40s (like Gone with the Wind).  Some movies have been released several times over the decades, and we do account for this. For example, Snow White was released in 1937, but half of its lifetime gross is from re-releases in the 80s and 90s, so each of these releases is adjusted according to the year it earned its money.  Also, December releases may earn money in two separate years. To account for this we take a movie's gross from its December opening until December 31 and adjust it according to the average ticket price that year, then adjust the remaining gross in the following year according to that year's ticket price.  Still, many movies from the 80s to mid-90s may not have as extensive weekend box office data and many movies prior to 1980 may not have weekend data at all, so the full timeframe for when that movie made its money may not be available. In such cases (and where actual number of tickets sold is not available), we can only adjust based on its total earnings and the average ticket price for the year it was released. Still, this should be a good general guideline to gauge a movie's popularity and compare it to other movies released in different years or decades.  Adjusting for ticket price inflation is not an exact science and should be used to give you a general idea of what a movie might have made if released in a different year, assuming it sold the same number of tickets.  Since these figures are based on average ticket prices they cannot take into effect other factors that may affect a movie's overall popularity and success. Such factors include but are not limited to: increases or decreases in the population, the total number of movies in the marketplace at a given time, economic conditions that may help or hurt the entertainment industry as a whole (e.g., war), the relative price of a movie ticket to other commodities in a given year, competition with other related medium such as the invention and advancements of Television, VHS, DVD, the Internet, etc…  Source   How do they account for the exchange rate between the dollar and foreign currency? Do they do this first and then apply inflation rates, or do they look at the inflation rates of international currency?   They don't really. It can't realistically be done for the reasons you've stated. BOM don't adjust worldwide box office for inflation. There are several articles that list a top 10 of worldwide box office adjusted for inflation, but none of them reveal how they made the calculations and it looks like they pulled the figures out of their asses."

boxoffice,3c3eg3,JakkuScavenger,2,Sat Jul 4 19:16:35 2015 UTC,Adjusted for inflation is basically - number of tickets we think the movie sold times current average ticket price.

boxoffice,3c35vo,asheraze,2,Sun Jul 5 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"This article was shit. The movie very well may do well, but it has almost nothing to do with what the writer was stating. Paul Rudd is a box office movie star? He doesn't have over a $100M grossing movie (including worldwide grosses) where he was the primary star. His four highest movies he is basically the third or fourth star in the movie at best (Both Anchormans, Knocked Up, and 40 Year Old Virgin). His more recent starring ventures in movies are the flops Admission, This is 40, and Wanderlust. I love Paul Rudd, but he has absolutely zero box office clout.  The comparison to the other movies that didn't have major stars also makes no sense. Paul Rudd is definitely known better, but he isn't bringing people to theaters. Neither was Hemsworth or Evans. What brought people to the theaters for those movies was the name Captain America and Thor. Thor also had a bankable star in Natalie Portman play a primary role in it. Ant Man has no character recognition and I am sorry, Michael Douglas is not relevant to the demographic that goes and sees these movies.   Comparisons to Guardians and Chris Pratt are also silly. Guardians didn't have name recognition, but it did have true stars in it. Also, the marketing for that movie was amazing. It built a fascinating story, introduced you perfectly to the characters (especially Star Lord), and used 80s music to produce nostalgia. Ant Man marketing has been middling at best. It has tried to include some Thomas the Train for the kids, but I feel that also missed the mark.   The only draw to this movie is the goodwill that Marvel has built with their movies and the fact that there now won't be any movie for the main demographic that will go and see it since Jurassic World thanks to the bust of Terminator Genisys. However, those draws are significant. I could see this movie failing to meet expectations and that is what I am predicting, but it won't surprise me if it hits the $65M mark either."

boxoffice,3c35vo,BallsDeepInJesus,2,Sun Jul 5 11:34:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the correction! I missed the boat on that one. Hooked on a Feeling was indeed from the 70s and was the main song used in the advertising, which was brilliant in my opinion. I honestly can't think of a better marketed film in recent years."
boxoffice,3c35vo,FockerFGAA,0,Sun Jul 5 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree with almost every word of this article. Look Ant Man could make a lot, well over 200 million, but it feels like it could totally flop. The reason there is a lot of doubt surrounding Ant Man, almost every article states as much before trying to argue against it, is that is just doesn't add up. At the core of that doubt is Paul Ruud.   Paul Ruud is fantastic comedic actor as a side man. He slays in Knocked Up, This is 40, Anchor Man, 40year old virgin, etc. He struggles when put in the lead. I Love You Man should have been a break out role for Ruud. It was essentially a creative disaster. It had to be one of the most middling comedies of the last decade. All that talent and it ended up a total wet noodle. Ruud is not a lead or he hasn't found the right vehicle yet. Ant Man could be that role, but nothing indicates that it will be, actually a lot goes against it.  Ruud is great at irony and self deprecating humor. He is not good at charisma and confidence. He is a smart ass but with no frat boy tendencies. Downey is essentially a huge jerk in real life, so he can pull off Iron Man easily. Ruud is a ""who, me?"" Type and that doesn't play well in a lead. Look at Pratt in guardians, great comedic actor but with a play boy undercurrent. He is a Tom cruise with an ironic sense of humor about himself. He looks like a lead. Ruud doesn't. Ruud would be better going in a Woody Allen direction. He is an egghead and looks like it and talks like it.  When he plays a confident lead role, it is always with an ocean of irony since he is a total nerd.  Just my two cents. If you disagree, please do. Can anyone show me where Ruud has played well as a strong lead?"
boxoffice,3c35vo,stoicblunder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:33:10 2015 UTC,Same could be said about Depp before Pirates and even Downey before Iron Man on some level. Neither guy was exactly box office magic before those breakthrough roles.
boxoffice,3c35vo,Vendevende,2,Sat Jul 4 20:46:59 2015 UTC,Yeah and same could be said about hemsworth and evans. They weren't big yet their films earned 350+ millions and it was back when Marvel studios wasn't big enough. This guy is on every ant man post scratching the bottom of the barrel to convince himself and others why Ant Man is not going to work without any strong arguments.
boxoffice,3c35vo,swellipop,2,Sat Jul 4 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"True, but both Depp and Downey were big names before their big moneymakers came in. Both were very active since the mid 80s. Depp was a great lead in a lot of films before Pirates.: Sleepy Hollow, Donnie Brasco, Fear and Loathing, Blow, From Hell. They may not have done very well at the BO, but he demonstrated any ability to carry a whole film by himself.  Downey is a little harder to pin down. He had a major drug problem so he was in and out of work/rehab through out the 90s and 00s. The thing about Downey is that people believed in his talent so much, they vouched for him over and over to get him back on track. So Downey is kinda of a special case of a big star who got sidelined by addiction and then was given hundreds of second chances to get big again, his dad's fame probably had something to do with that. But Downey was always an A-lister with a huge drug problem. He just had to get clean to reach his potential as a huge star.  I don't Ruud really lines up with Depp or Downey. Ruud got famous for playing comedic side roles and straight man roles (Role Models, I Love You Man). I suppose Ant Man is just an extension of his straight man shtick, so maybe this will be his big breakout role. My money is on it not working well."

boxoffice,3c19ti,mrstickball,7,Fri Jul 3 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"The chances of things turning ""ugly"" for MMXXL are ALMOST impossible. A production budget of ~$15M means that even a $35M opening weekend will be considered decent. But yes, Warner Bros will probably expect more than a ""decent"" opening for this film."
boxoffice,3c19ti,best_in_life,2,Sat Jul 4 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"Sure, its going to make money for WB. However, its 5-day opening looks to be lower than Magic Mike's 3-day, and will likely perform much lower than the original once all is said and done."
boxoffice,3c19ti,mrstickball,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:33:44 2015 UTC,Agreed. Curious to know -- what's the reason for a movie like MMXXL to release on a Wednesday if Friday-Sunday will bring in the largest chunk of the audience? Wouldn't a Thursday release help since the demand isn't burned off by much before the weekend hits?
boxoffice,3c19ti,best_in_life,2,Sat Jul 4 03:34:17 2015 UTC,"Saturday is Fourth of July. Whenever the 4th lands on a Saturday, box office tanks (see box office charts from July 2009 for the last time this happened). On the other hand, a lot of people get the preceding days off from work so releasing a movie on Wednesday makes sense during a week like this."
boxoffice,3c19ti,Juswantedtono,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:59:14 2015 UTC,I see I/O ending up #1 this weekend.

boxoffice,3c1y9f,best_in_life,3,Sat Jul 4 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"Probably $350Million overseas, maybe $400M at best, depends how its received.

boxoffice,3c1y9f,navman93,2,Sat Jul 4 01:47:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with both of ya (including /u/bry142) in terms of estimates -- $350M seems possible, and $400M could be in play as well. The overseas performance of this week will give us a better idea in terms of the long term total.   On a side note, if the movie earns ~$100M domestic and ~$400M overseas -- will it be in the ""safe zone,"" and justify another entry in the series? I'm curious since it seems that Paramount is planning to make a trilogy out of this one."
boxoffice,3c1y9f,AmishAvenger,4,Sat Jul 4 03:28:10 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, they greenlit two more already. Something to do with the rights reverting to Cameron in 2019, so they want to get them made while they still can."
boxoffice,3c1y9f,navman93,2,Sat Jul 4 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"If it does then yes.  Production Budget of 155M and advertising of around 50-100M (not sure, those are the ranges of numbers i've read). And if it ended up with ~$500Million, then i don't see why they wont go ahead with the trilogy.   You can pretty much confirm the sequels, IF the movie makes $150M domestic. However, this might seem harder to pull off depending on how it goes this week.  Sorry if this response seems a bit ambiguous"
boxoffice,3c1y9f,bry142,2,Sat Jul 4 04:58:25 2015 UTC,I really think the marketing budget is close to the 100 million. Another key factor is how the second week drop is. If the drop is not that steep and has a descent foreign performance it will probably be made the same budget. If it underwhelms really bad the movies will probably be made but they will have a lower budget.
boxoffice,3c1y9f,bry142,2,Sun Jul 5 01:29:13 2015 UTC,Will Probably get around 350-375 million overseas. 3D and the popularity of the franchise will save it. If it opens in china it could make more.
boxoffice,3c11ft,Republican_Atheist,8,Fri Jul 3 19:57:50 2015 UTC,15m budget versus 150m budget though... if international gross isn't stellar this could be the nail in the Terminator coffin.

As strange as this sounds, and I never thought there'd be a day where any human in documented history would say this, but movies like Magic Mike XXL are truly good films that stand alone, not as sequels, whereas the Terminator franchise is and continues to represent recycled action movies with no soul."

The thread called OP out for the spoilers being fake almost instantly.   However, someone also posted something along the lines of ""take that shit to reddit, they believe anything"" (which isn't an extraordinary response, because /tv/ loves to talk about reddit).  So I said I'd post it on /r/movies, since I have a reddit account and posted a fair bit on /r/movies, and personally didn't think it would gain any traction. I assumed a similar response would be found on reddit (people all say it was obviously fake) or that it would just be ignored.   Instead it got ~250 upvotes in the first hour and a couple hundred comments. No one questioned whether it was real or asked for proof. The only person who did call it out was /u/MulderD, who worked on the film (and up until Arnold posted was downvoted to oblivion) - I gifted him reddit gold afterwards as I felt he was the only one who actually did what I assumed everyone was going to do to begin with).   Then Arnold showed up and said it was all bullshit and the thread got wiped by the mods (or I think it was the mods, I can't be sure).  I was permanently banned from /r/movies, and became the #1 post of all time on /r/quityourbullshit.

boxoffice,3bwtjm,TheHoon,6,Thu Jul 2 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"I think the focus is international. If you assume you get back 50% of box office gross then it needs to hit somewhere around $300m to start being profitable. If it gets to $100M domestic then it only needs another $200M overseas. Salvation did $250M overseas so it isn't unreasonable to expect Genisys will do better and be profitable. However, it most likely won't be a cash cow unless there is significant overseas increases."

It was so utterly confusing and terribly plot wise:    Terminator Genisys Is Like A Loud, Lousy, Super-Confusing Cover Band  Terminator Genisys seems specifically designed to give you a headache. It’s a reboot, a sequel, a reimagining, and a rehash of the previous Terminator films all churned up and spackled together, a film that conjures up all your memories of those movies only to eradicate them with little explanation. The movie works so hard—at a few points, even recreating exact shots from the first two films—to so little effect, as if it’s rewriting our own timelines while we’re watching it. I found myself trying in vain to follow along as the movie danced as fast as it could, and this morning, less than 12 hours after seeing it, I’m having trouble remembering basic plot points and characters.

But it all depends on the critical reaction to the bio pic. All of the movies listed above have been certified of RT and have picked up oscar nominations in categories. A solid marketing campaign will help and if it does it can definitely hit $100 mil plus. It could potentially get hampered a bit if some movies come out of know where and like The Martian (Ridley Scott hasn't had a box office hit in a while), The Walk (Robert Zemekis defiantly will be pushing for some awards), Bridge of spies (spielberg), Crimson Peak (Del Toro) all open before, on the week and after the jobs bio pic.

The creative thing about a producer, is taking a movie, and making it financially sound. Not only in its development, but also when it releases. Directors, writers, actors, they know this, that's why they have to obey the orders of these producers. So yes, mainstream movies are made and they are expected to make money; no one likes dumping money and people have to eat. There are movies which are exclusively made as an art form however, the art-house movies which handle a poor budget and are made for the sake of it. There is a lot of talent in those films, and for many it is the way to prove themselves."

It'll fall off after the third installment like all the other animated franchises have so far. People love the shit out of the Minions, but now we're living in a state of Minion overload, and they're getting a full movie of Minion antics. I can barely remember the other characters from the other films - once they try to go all ""Hey, Gru's on another adventure with his kids and wife and shit,"" interest is going to plummet. No one gave a shit when Shrek settled down, and Shrek was the biggest franchise of the 2000s...  Edit: I see I'm getting downvotes now. Look at animated franchises with at least 4 installments. Shrek 4 was down $84m domestically from Shrek 3. Penguins of Madagascar was down 60 percent domestically and 40 percent internationally from Madagascar 3. Ice Age 4 was down $35m domestically (but up internationally). Franchise fatigue is real, and not just in animation. Spider-Man dropped $90m from SM3 to ASM and another $60m from ASM to ASM2. Pirates of the Carribean 4 was down $70m domestically from Pirates 3. This is going to hit DM3, trust me."

It will not outperform Inside Out.  Pixels: I'm a little biased because I ended up with this movie in my fantays draft, but I think it'll be a sleeper hit.  Sandler has been shitting the bed recently but this will be a turning point for him.  It'll open unspectacularly but go on to do $150 million.  Ant-Man: Depsite the lack of or negative buzz from casual moviegoers, Marvel can do no wrong and I'll hold to that idea until they actually do.  AN opening int he range of $75 million on the way to $225 million domestic.  Trainwreck: I agree with OP, it will be a success. It will cross $100 million.  Straight Outta Compton: Bomb.  M:I Rogue Nation: The crowded summer schedule will hurt it so it won't hit the $200 million that Ghost Protocol did, but it'll do well enoguh to warrant another sequel for sure.  $180 million.  Vacation: I don't see this doing more than $70 million domestic.  It may have a big opening weekend because people are curious but I think it's going to be a bad movie and there will be a big dropoff.  Fant4astic: I really don't know what to think about this one.  This is a real wildcard for me."

Domestic will get over $300m but will not match DM2 because it's a spinoff Pixels: will bomb. I think it will be a critical and commercial failure unless its a surprise critical hit like spy. But like u said I think it will be beat by minions  Ant-Man: will not have a huge opening weekend because of the concept idea. Even if its a critical hit , MI: rouge nations will kill it's audience in its 3rd week. This  will be Marvels first bust since the hulk Mission impossible: will do fairly good due to lack of competiton in August for big blockbuster action movies Fantastic Four: definition of a summer blockbuster bomb.

It's holding really well in its weekdays (I mean, it's summer so they'll be big anyway, but still, 33 percent from first to second Tuesday ain't nothing to fuck with), and it still has the whole Fourth of July weekend to itself as the only major kid's movie. That means that once Minions comes out next weekend it'll slow down, but it'll be slowing down when it's close to $300m already, so it has a chance to get at least $350m domestic.   Its worldwide success depends on a few factors, but I looked at the release schedules, and Disney staggered Inside Out in a lot of foreign markets until the fourth or fifth weekends of Minions' run there (it's already out in a bunch of places before it hits the US next weekend). There's still the question of proper translation and making sure the jokes travel properly due to the complex plot, which could be a problem, but if it holds it has an outside shot."

The movie broke several records (Even though it was 2nd place the whole time due to Jurassic World) and theres still so many countries where Inside Out hasnt been released yet. I am sure Inside Out will pass 350 million for just domestic only and worst case scenario, it will probably make at least $650 million worldwide which is on par with most Pixar films. Realistically though it might be in the $700-900 million range."

Disney packaged them together in drive-in theaters, which didn't just help it keep screens but helped it by giving it half of Avengers' drive-in returns depending on how Disney tallies those up. It had identical weekends from April 24-26 and May 1-3.

When word of mouth is there IMO it is easier to get to $400m domestic. Sure the OS market is growing but most of it is still China.

(as in not as involved or as important) T1000 turns his arms into spears and throws them all the time.

boxoffice,3bm01a,ShakoWasAngry,17,Tue Jun 30 08:27:44 2015 UTC,"No. He's had like 3 movies and a show that not a lot of people pay attention to. Million Ways bombed because it wasn't good, Ted 2 bombed because sequels like that quickly fall victim to diminishing returns, plus it was going up against two of the most successful movies of all time."
boxoffice,3bm01a,Prax150,4,Tue Jun 30 14:06:22 2015 UTC,..and the reviews haven't been all that positive.
boxoffice,3bm01a,wuzizname,26,Tue Jun 30 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"Meh, I liked Ted but I didn't really think it needed a sequel.   I have a feeling there are a lot of people out there who agreed."
boxoffice,3bm01a,gaycrusader1,5,Tue Jun 30 12:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know why movie studios always want to force a sequel.  Sometimes the story is told, and that's it.  Move on to something else."
boxoffice,3bm01a,Rob1150,15,Tue Jun 30 12:17:51 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple - studios will always prefer to make sequels as opposed to original content as long as the sequels are making money. This is because the sequels are more of a guarantee than original content - if you're putting out original content, it could gross a ton or it could bust, but a sequel usually has something of a baseline (no one considered the possibility that Ted 2, for example, would make $15 million in its opening like A Million Ways to Die in the West did, purely because it was a sequel to a successful first movie).  Clearly they aren't going to make a Ted 3, but studios don't care about if a story has been told or not - they care about the money. Let the directors or the creators care about the content."
boxoffice,3bm01a,Pripat99,4,Tue Jun 30 12:39:27 2015 UTC,"Bingo.  It's the same mentality with television (broadcast tv, not necessarily cable/netflix).    The reason why we see so many shit sequels is the same reason why tv shows we love get run into the ground despite the fact that they should've ended after 4-5 seasons;  They're making money, and lots of it.    It's the age-old ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" mentality."
boxoffice,3bm01a,Ssutuanjoe,2,Tue Jun 30 14:18:35 2015 UTC,I thought the last 1/2 hour of the original Ted could have been its own plot for a sequel.   But instead we had another 1/2 hour of needless chase at the end of an okay buddy comedy.
boxoffice,3bm01a,themastersmew,33,Tue Jun 30 17:23:28 2015 UTC,Or could it be that TED simply was not that good?
boxoffice,3bm01a,darkstar3333,3,Tue Jun 30 12:00:33 2015 UTC,"The first one came out during a box office slump, especially for comedies.

boxoffice,3bm01a,mvs5191,2,Tue Jun 30 17:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Drives me crazy. I think with tickets being so expensive these days, people are just more savvy about checking reviews and making informed decisions about which flicks are worth their time and money.  If your movie is terrible, news travels fast, and people tend to stay away much more than they did in the past..."
boxoffice,3bm01a,freekill,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:48:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is an external factor at all.  He wrote it.  He directed it.  He was a major actor in it.  He's got his own comedy style which he's been using for the better part of two decades.    In short, people know what to expect, especially out of Ted 2.  If that expectation doesn't lend itself positively, then they won't want to see it.    Hell, do you really think that a movie being ""good"" is the biggest factor in how much revenue it generates?  Look at JPW right now, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who says it's an amazing movie but it's breaking about every record in the books right now.  The movie is sold based on Seth's comedy."

boxoffice,3bmsof,GoldandBlue,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:27 2015 UTC,Domestic on this movie will be irrelevant. If it can push 350M overseas and 100M domestic then it will have a sequel I bet. Both of those numbers are reasonably doable.

Blockbusters that are review proof are usually anticipated by the general audience, another Terminator isn't anticipated by much of anyone.

boxoffice,3bkddd,demusdesign,3,Tue Jun 30 12:25:04 2015 UTC,"But this would mean that they sell like DOUBLE the amount of tickets on Tuesday.  Because this is total grosses increasing, not just admissions.  Also it would mean movie theatres are idiots for not decreasing ticket prices more often because they're making more money with discounted tickets AND more concessions because there are almost twice as many people there..."
boxoffice,3bkddd,Gonzored,10,Tue Jun 30 01:37:11 2015 UTC,"The discount turns a traditionally slow day into a busy one. As well concentrate weekday business into one day. Thus able to prepare staff and supplies accordingly. A lot of businesses they are most profitable when full. Example, lighting costs a business the same no matter if they are slow or busy. Being busy mitigates alot of costs. Concentrating business allows better utilization of resources (like staff) and a turnover point for things like cleaning and perishables.  Scarcity, when there is just one cheap night it becomes more valuable to frugal customers. They are aware of it and make a point of using it. Its the same way you might buy something on sale even tho you dont need it now because its on sale and youll need it eventually. If every weekday was cheap it would lose this scarcity. It doesnt continue to be as enticing. Ie, if business is double on tuesdays because its cheap doesnt mean you can simply double business on another day by making it cheap as well."
boxoffice,3bkddd,saucylion,-7,Tue Jun 30 03:45:20 2015 UTC,I'm extremely familiar with how business works... and that it wouldn't necessarily double business on other days.  But theatres could clearly make more money on cheap days because it gets so many more people into the theatre. Maybe studios won't let them discount it on more days.
boxoffice,3bkddd,pajamalamaobama,5,Tue Jun 30 05:02:17 2015 UTC,"Considering even lowering the price just once a week only increases revenue marginally on Tuesdays, it is pretty clear that a permanent price cut will not increase total revenue. Sure attendance will be up but as you said yourself the effect won't be as big as it is it is when they lower the price for only one day a week."
boxoffice,3bkddd,mannymix03,-4,Tue Jun 30 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"Right but what I'm saying is:    If in fact theatres discounting tickets on Tuesdays is the cause for the box office bump, then admissions on Tuesday must be about double other weekdays.  (again, I don't really think this is the case because that would mean theaters are just as crowded on Tuesdays as they are on weekend days-- something I find very hard to believe). Double admissions would mean roughly double the concessions sold, which is where they get the majority of their profits.  So, in this case not only is their revenue from tickets upticked slightly with the dicounts, but they are making MUCH more money overall because of the corresponding increase in concessions sales. Theatres should discount tickets much more often if all of this is true.  Even if it means ticket revenue drops.  Because ticket revenue would have to drop a lot to compensate for the profits made from the increased concessions sales.   The people running the companies know the business and are profit driven, so if this is the case there would be more discounted days.   This is why I have my doubts to discounting being the root cause of the box office bump on Tuesdays.  UNLESS-- studios do not let theatres discount tickets on days other than Tuesday, which is very possible.  But even if that's true, I don't think the theatres actually get the bump from discounts alone because I don't think the crowds are that much bigger on tuesdays"
boxoffice,3bkddd,mannymix03,2,Tue Jun 30 05:41:13 2015 UTC,"A) Studios don't let theaters discount tickets on days other than Tuesday.   B)The Tuesday bump is huge right now because it's summer. Look at figures for a movie like The Boxtrolls, which opened in Sept/Oct - grosses were up on Tuesdays compared to other weekdays, but the amounts were miniscule in comparison. Even the bigger movies like Gone Girl, which have successful Tuesdays, see grosses that are fractions of what they're getting on the weekend."

I wasn't the only Tuesday regular to do so, it was pretty much the norm. So I don't think it's that attendance is double is more that people are watching two movies instead of just one. On the reason why they don't do it more days I believe it's because if more days where special discount days then it's  no longer special."

boxoffice,3bh0y4,Daxtreme,14,Mon Jun 29 03:46:16 2015 UTC,It doesn't come out in Japan until August 5th and could make 50 to 75 million there.
boxoffice,3bh0y4,mythmaster,7,Mon Jun 29 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, forgot about Japan.  Jurassic Park made $100 million in japan back in 1993, I think jurassic world has a shot for it as well.  Let's see."

boxoffice,3bh0y4,stumblingaxis,10,Mon Jun 29 23:02:35 2015 UTC,You heard it here first. It will be 1.73 bn. Mark my words.
boxoffice,3bh0y4,MurderIsRelevant,-11,Mon Jun 29 09:29:16 2015 UTC,"Why would anyone trust Redditors predictions, especially after they couldn't even predict how big this movie would be?  This sub sucks at making predictions."
boxoffice,3bh0y4,HowlMoonstone183,11,Mon Jun 29 12:24:51 2015 UTC,"Nobody predicted it would be this big, not just this sub."
boxoffice,3bh0y4,satellite_uplink,9,Mon Jun 29 13:07:18 2015 UTC,That's because making predictions on something like this is extremely hard.
boxoffice,3bh0y4,DaveFincher,11,Mon Jun 29 12:43:41 2015 UTC,I think your guess is good. I'd personally say 1.7b final gross.
boxoffice,3bh0y4,GamingTatertot,4,Mon Jun 29 11:10:19 2015 UTC,"I just have to say, I love your work."

boxoffice,3bh0y4,Pripat99,9,Tue Jun 30 14:13:21 2015 UTC,"Can I just say that this discussion highlights once again how ludicrous the Avatar record is? We are in here talking about the final worldwide gross for JW, a movie that has obliterated records left and right since it opened, and most are pegging between $1.6-$1.8 billion. Meanwhile Avatar took in nearly $2.8 billion, or nearly a billion more than the high estimates for JW.  It is going to be a long time I think before we see the Avatar record fall."
boxoffice,3bh0y4,voidsoul22,3,Mon Jun 29 17:19:20 2015 UTC,"Was thinking about 1.8B, but that might be too optimistic based on your excellent analysis, even including Japan.  Post your analysis, I think somewhere between 1.7 and 1.8."
boxoffice,3bh0y4,GamingTatertot,2,Mon Jun 29 17:15:34 2015 UTC,1.6 billion. Around that number.
boxoffice,3bh0y4,whatevers_clever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:47:55 2015 UTC,I'd put it at 1.87bn
boxoffice,3bh0y4,NannerAirCraft,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:58:55 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say $1.71B. Although I think it has potential to make more.
boxoffice,3bh0y4,dillyd,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:36:46 2015 UTC,I predict that Jurassic World will dominate this sub for the next two months.
boxoffice,3bh0y4,Jon-Osterman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:17:12 2015 UTC,$1.645 billion was my estimate after the opening weekend - think it'll hold up to that.
boxoffice,3bfuj4,Jon-Osterman,3,Sun Jun 28 21:18:52 2015 UTC,Here's a better link for this statistic  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/smallestdrops.htm?page=DROP3000&sort=opengross&order=DESC&p=.htm
boxoffice,3bfnld,jiangsen,5,Sun Jun 28 20:21:27 2015 UTC,I don't think JW will beat Titanic but it is all but locked in to beat Avengers.
boxoffice,3bfnld,bluecamel2015,0,Mon Jun 29 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"Kind of funny that this starts the protected period in China, and the big tentpole film has (relatively) bombed."
boxoffice,3bfmer,Protodeus,10,Sun Jun 28 20:11:38 2015 UTC,"No, with minions coming out this will probably cap at around 250-280 million domestic. Worldwide it will beat that mark for sure."
boxoffice,3bfmer,AlbinoFoot,14,Sun Jun 28 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, you're shadowbanned by the Reddit admins. I've whitelisted you on our sub so you can post freely without being censored. Message the admins to clear it up."
boxoffice,3bfmer,AlbinoFoot,7,Sun Jun 28 21:12:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks, all cleared up now."
boxoffice,3bfmer,SnapesFavoriteSong,3,Sun Jun 28 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"I'm extremely confident it will end up over 300.  250 are you kidding me? It just made over 50 this weekend, it would have to drop like a ROCK to end up at that. 280 is also a very low estimate.  But i agree not 400"
boxoffice,3bfmer,AlbinoFoot,2,Mon Jun 29 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"Ya, I low balled it maybe a bit too much, a better estimate would 290-320."
boxoffice,3bfmer,jburd22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:10:44 2015 UTC,"Well it's pacing ahead of Monsters U which made 270, and will face off with Minions as did Monsters U with DM2. Not only is Inside out currently 15 million ahead of Monsters U at the same time,  but it has FAR better word of mouth and has an extra week without animated competition. Also I don't think Minions will be as Big as DP2 ( or Inside Out for that matter) so I easily see Inside Out topping 300 mil. If it plays like UP or TS3 it could reach 350, and if it holds really well 400 could be in play (though that is highly unlikely). Basically 280 is guaranteed at this point."
boxoffice,3bfmer,hatramroany,5,Mon Jun 29 05:06:22 2015 UTC,Minions is going to be huge
boxoffice,3bfmer,tcatron565,2,Mon Jun 29 11:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, DM2 had hype, but nothing like Minions. People are going ba-ba-ba-ba-bananas over the little yellow guys, and this movie is going to rock the box office. Mark my words, Minions will surpass $400 million domestically. Possibly even rival Toy Story 3. Inside Out will do well until then, and probably still put up quite a nice fight against Minions thanks to the Pixar brand, but it will probably max out just under 300 million, maybe barely scratching past the 300 million mark.  Very good summer for animation. Well, until Shaun the Sheep."
boxoffice,3bfmer,jburd22,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:06:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I think it will be big, but I highly doubt it will perform as well as Despicable Me 2."
boxoffice,3bfmer,Shruth1,11,Mon Jun 29 16:18:25 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it can break $300m but not $400m
boxoffice,3bfmer,Fribbulate,4,Mon Jun 29 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"I think it'll hit its peak around $315 million, with a lot of stiff competition coming up (Minions) I don't see it going much higher than that"
boxoffice,3beucd,stoicblunder,18,Sun Jun 28 16:08:17 2015 UTC,Well my friend posted all over social media how great of a movie jurassic world was on Thursday night. People who watch the midnight show or even on Friday express their opinion on social media which definetly affects the opening weekend
boxoffice,3beucd,Shruth1,5,Sun Jun 28 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Also let's not forget that word of mouth doesn't start on opening night. Trailers are important, and the trailers for Ted 2 made it look awful. I've not heard anyone say they wanted to see Ted 2 before it opened."
boxoffice,3beucd,TheHoon,2,Sun Jun 28 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"I also remember a lot more marketing for the first than the second, or maybe the first ones marketing was just a lot better."
boxoffice,3beucd,jburd22,8,Sun Jun 28 20:07:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, Bruno fell by like 50% on Sunday because of how bad the word of mouth was."
boxoffice,3beucd,newuser13,8,Sun Jun 28 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"But couldn't you also argue it was just front-loaded? Not saying that was the case, but how do we know bad WOM is definitely why it dropped off during the weekend?"
boxoffice,3beucd,newuser13,0,Sun Jun 28 17:22:23 2015 UTC,"http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1910059,00.html"
boxoffice,3beucd,newuser13,4,Sun Jun 28 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"This article just seems kinda like a puff piece about ""the power of social media."" I am not seeing any cold hard facts that link the drop from Friday to Sunday being directly linked to WOM. The article even states: ""Brüno had the weekend contours of a gross-out horror movie: the fanboys rush in on Thursday night and Friday, severely depleting the universe of potential customers. Chalk that up to word-of-mouth, viral and virulent."" Why should we chalk that up to negative social media? I see correlation but not causation. I could just as easily make the argument that Bruno appealed to a very small group who went to see it on Friday and there was no one left for Sat and Sunday. It's potential audience was small and rabid, hence a front loaded Friday. It's definitely a good example, but I am not seeing direct evidence that negative WOM hurt the opening weekend numbers."
boxoffice,3beucd,newuser13,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"People do not go to see movies in a vacuum.  Many go to see based on what others' opinions on the movie were.  That's why Avatar had such a high second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth weeks at the box office.    That's why Frozen stuck around for so long.  That's what happened with many, many movies.  This is not a new phenomenon.  Word of mouth affects box office take.  This is not up for debate."
boxoffice,3beucd,newuser13,3,Sun Jun 28 19:20:42 2015 UTC,Who is arguing otherwise?
boxoffice,3beucd,tcatron565,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:26:50 2015 UTC,You.  You just argued that Bruno's drop could have been due to front-loading instead of Word of Mouth when front-loading is actually often DUE to word of mouth.
boxoffice,3beucd,Fidget08,2,Sun Jun 28 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"Not really. I was arguing that only a small group of people wanted to see Bruno, and they saw it on Friday. No one else wanted to see it (regardless of WOM), which is why it started to tank. Snakes on a Plane is perfect example of what I am talking about. Anyone who wanted to see it was excited about the movie and saw it Thursday/Friday/Saturday. No one else want to see, it nose dives Sunday and for the rest of its run. Films can be front-loaded outside of how people actually feel about the content of the film."
boxoffice,3beucd,Nayelia,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except Snakes on a Plane was even from Friday to Saturday whereas Bruno dropped 40% from Friday to Saturday.   But those totals mask a worrisome trend for the picture: After a strong start on Friday, domestic ticket sales for ""Bruno"" declined 39% on Saturday. Such a huge drop is rare and almost always a harbinger of bad buzz and a short box office run for a film. The odds of ""Bruno"" earning a total of even $100 million, let alone the $128.5 million worth of tickets that ""Borat"" sold in the U.S. and Canada, are very low.   http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=bruno.htm"
boxoffice,3beucd,TheHoon,2,Sun Jun 28 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"Snakes on a Plane was front loaded without WOM about actual quality of the film coming into play. This happens all the time. But you make a good point. Bruno dropped 40% from Friday to Saturday, that is crazy. Women in Black 2, also got a Cinema Score of a C and dropped about 40% from Friday to Saturday. Maybe that is it, but horror movies always drop huge Friday to Sat.  A huge drop from Friday to Saturday along with a low CinemaScore could be a sign that bad WOM from actual viewers hurt opening box weekend. Just to play devils advocate again. Just because a movie scores bad with audience doesn't mean it will turn people away. Look at Hot Pursuit. CinemaScore of C+, terrible, gains from Friday to Saturday by 17%. Or another oddity. 22 Jump Street, CinemaScore of A-, people liked it, it drops 25% Friday to Saturday.   How about something like MacGruber, CinemaScore of c-, people despised it, only drops 7% Friday to Saturday. So the data is all over the place. I still don't see a smoking gun that tells me WOM on Friday significantly hurts Saturday and Sunday."
boxoffice,3beucd,DaveFincher,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:44:46 2015 UTC,"Over a small period of time, especially the opening weekend, word-of-mouth likely won't play a huge affect. Nearly all horror movies have runs similar to Bruno, but that's not because all horror movies are bad, it's just because the smaller niche of horror movie fans go to opening night. Over lengthier periods kg time, such as a week, it clearly does."
boxoffice,3beucd,DaveFincher,6,Mon Jun 29 15:11:27 2015 UTC,I hear Ted 2 was shit.  I skipped it for that reason.  I will watch it when it gets released.
boxoffice,3beucd,Janitor3333,3,Sun Jun 28 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything to suggest WOM can hurt opening weekend, at least not with blockbuster type front loaded films.  The studios build up hype leading up to the movie's opening and if people already look forward to something and decided they're going to see it the weekend it comes out, no terrible review or critical friend is going to change that.  Opening weekend is usually affected by marketing, awareness and hype.  WOM doesn't come into play until following weeks to determine the strength of legs.  (Also WOM generally refers to opinion of the actual movie, not trailers.  Bad trailers are just poor marketing, since plenty of crappy movies have made deceitfully enticing trailers.)"
boxoffice,3beucd,mrstickball,6,Sun Jun 28 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"Another related question is when do people decide to see a specific movie? Is it when they see the trailer, the week before, the day of? If people choose to see a specific movie vs another movie in the moment then I can see bad WOM hurting a film on opening weekend."
boxoffice,3beucd,JustAnEpicPerson,4,Sun Jun 28 17:16:12 2015 UTC,I think your asking questions that people in the industry are paid millions to answer. Any case I think people decide at lots of different points. For example after  The Avengers I knew I wanted to watch the Sequal. After seeing the trailer for Minions I want to see minions. after seeing the trailer for Spies I had no desire to see it but after seeing the reviews and hearing from friends I then decided to watch it. I think from a movie studio perspective they want to maximise the chance of making someone want to watch the films at each one of these points.
boxoffice,3beucd,mrstickball,5,Sun Jun 28 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"I think your asking questions that people in the industry are paid millions to answer.   Well said, a lot of the questions we get here on /r/boxoffice are big questions people get paid massive sums of money to answer. It's why I laugh when people ask something like ""How did Avatar make so much money?"""
boxoffice,3beucd,mealsharedotorg,4,Sun Jun 28 18:20:31 2015 UTC,"I kinda though that was the whole point of having this sub, to discuss the box office and how it works. What is wrong with asking ""How did Avatar make so much money?"" That seems to be the whole point of this sub. There are probably 100 different answers to that question. It's suppose to be a discourse."
boxoffice,3beucd,mardfet,0,Sun Jun 28 19:02:32 2015 UTC,Never said people shouldn't ask questions. You read why too much into what I said.
boxoffice,3beucd,DeeBased,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"You're tired Finch, go to bed."
boxoffice,3beucd,ThePondererTK,2,Sun Jun 28 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is getting paid millions to answer that question. An analyst would be lucky to make 60k in Hollywood. I have always found the studio system to be belligerently orthodox and old-fashioned. My guess is that they are decades behind when it comes to data and social science compared to other industries, especially startups. I mean they still use CinemaScore, which is probably the most statistically irrelevant survey parroted by industry leaders. From my personal experience, huge industries that have been established for a long time tend to get by on handshakes and back-room deals and old boys networks; not logic, customer research, and actual statistics. Just playing devil's advocate. I have seen this first hand in the banking and fashion industries."
boxoffice,3bevpr,DaveFincher,2,Sun Jun 28 16:20:42 2015 UTC,Inside Out is now bound to replace My Big Fat Greek Wedding as top grossing movie to never hit number 1!
boxoffice,3bevpr,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"That film had such a weird box office run. It hit $1m in its third weekend and kept adding theatres peaking at just over 2000... In its 26th week. It never made more than $11m in a single weekend yet grossed over $1m in 39 different weekends. And this is a comedy released in 2002, not 1982."
boxoffice,3be6sg,sfromero,11,Sun Jun 28 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"It's drop is also low, it's guaranteed to beat Titanic domestic now, I wonder how much higher it can go."
boxoffice,3be6sg,DaveFincher,4,Sun Jun 28 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's guaranteed to beat Titanic just yet.  For comparison, let's say Jurassic World holds up just as well as The Avengers from this point until the end of its run. The Avengers had grossed $457 million after 17 days, Jurassic World has done $500 million.  Avengers added another $166 to finish at $623 million. If Jurassic World did the same it would close at $666 million, $8 million ahead of Titanic.  That number seems narrow enough that Titanic could still hold the #2 spot.  And to those who think Jurassic World will easily hold up better than The Avengers, let's compare their recent daily totals.    Day #: The Avengers: Jurassic World:    15 $15,236,046 $14,700,000   16 $23,587,069 $22,500,000   17 $16,820,987 $17,000,000    It looks like The Avengers is starting to etch out World's daily totals and there's a lot of strong competition still to come out over the next 2 months.  I'm not saying that Jurassic World won't overtake Titanic, but I think it's still far from certain."
boxoffice,3be6sg,Dorkside,2,Sun Jun 28 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"At this point, is another 260 million out of the question, to beat Avatar?  I don't know if I see T5 or Magic Mike knocking it down that hard this weekend..."
boxoffice,3be6sg,trapper2530,3,Sun Jun 28 16:30:20 2015 UTC,Even assuming it does 35/30/25/20 and carries over strong that's $110 which is going to be hard. That still leave $150 mil to to catch up. Will be tough.   I'm more curious to see it's world wide total.
boxoffice,3be6sg,jacquesaustin,2,Sun Jun 28 17:06:18 2015 UTC,week days have been super strong too. it will probably earn another 40 million mon-thurs during that 4 week period as well. gets it over titanic but under Avatar.
boxoffice,3be6sg,FockerFGAA,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"Based on essentially every other blockbuster movie to come out during the summer in the last 10 years (excluding animated films) it'll end up around 680M with a max of 740M, just under avatar."
boxoffice,3be6sg,Sanlear,6,Sun Jun 28 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"It's a Jurassic World, we're just living in it."
boxoffice,3be6sg,Fidget08,5,Sun Jun 28 20:36:10 2015 UTC,This shit is so crazy.  Never underestimate people wanting to see dinosaurs.  I've seen it twice.

boxoffice,3bet8y,NeilPoonHandler,12,Sun Jun 28 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"The unstoppable dinosaur. Damn impressive legs.   I wonder if that means the Good dinosaur from Pixar will do great, since kids do seem to love dinosaurs."
boxoffice,3bet8y,Calmwaterfall,7,Sun Jun 28 16:45:47 2015 UTC,It's Pixar it will do fine
boxoffice,3bet8y,Mybrainmelts,3,Sun Jun 28 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"I know but it is about dinosaurs, so i was wondering if it will do much more than they expected."
boxoffice,3bet8y,Calmwaterfall,5,Sun Jun 28 17:23:31 2015 UTC,I think it will get a big boost because dinosaurs are big amongst kids again
boxoffice,3bet8y,Mybrainmelts,2,Sun Jun 28 17:24:44 2015 UTC,I agree and not to mention Inside Outs success.
boxoffice,3bet8y,TheHoon,0,Sun Jun 28 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"With both Jurassic and Pixar (IO) getting back to form, I reckon it makes TGD (a combination of both) a dark horse when it comes to big box office numbers this year."
boxoffice,3bet8y,TheGameOfClones,10,Sun Jun 28 18:27:38 2015 UTC,Inside Out is now bound to replace My Big Fat Greek Wedding as the top grossing movie to never hit number 1!
boxoffice,3bet8y,JakkuScavenger,6,Sun Jun 28 17:55:08 2015 UTC,It does seem very likely. With Magic Mike XXL coming next weekend even if IO beats JW next weekend it will probably be behind Mike and perhaps even Terminator although I haven't seen any tracking numbers voor T:Genisys.  I think it's interesting that Inside Out will get the record with a very different earning pattern.
boxoffice,3bet8y,curiousfanboy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty much Magic Mike XXL and Terminator next week, then Minions the week after that, Ant-Man the week after, there's just no opportunity for Inside Out to make it to number one at this point."
boxoffice,3bet8y,JakkuScavenger,2,Sun Jun 28 19:00:38 2015 UTC,That would be a big record for Inside Out actually. MBFGW has held on to that record for a long time.
boxoffice,3bet8y,TheGameOfClones,4,Sun Jun 28 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"Universal still seems to be lowballing on Jurassic World, like they did for the first two weekends. This means they are expecting a 28% Sunday drop, which imo is very unlikely. JW is going to make about 56 million in actuals imo, passing The Avenger's gross at the same time. At this point of time, beating Avengers in overall domestic is almost locked already- all that remains to be seen is whether it will beat Titanic also (which appears highly likely at the moment)."
boxoffice,3bet8y,higgsboson1997,5,Sun Jun 28 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"This will be the biggest BO year of all time, so far. There´s still SW, Bond, Ant-ma, MI:RN, THG, Minons. Yeah, these movies will be huge both domestically and WW."
boxoffice,3bet8y,Calmwaterfall,2,Sun Jun 28 19:15:56 2015 UTC,Really great numbers for JW. I thought IO might take #1 this week but JW continues to be strong.
boxoffice,3bet8y,DaveFincher,2,Sun Jun 28 16:24:46 2015 UTC,I went to see JW last night and the theater was completely full.  I think this thing still has a few major weeks ahead of it.
boxoffice,3bet8y,2ndChanceCharlie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:45:02 2015 UTC,Yet another incredible weekend for Jurassic World - three #1 huge weekends in a row. Wow.  Fantastic for Inside Out as well. It's nice to see Pixar doing superb business again.
boxoffice,3bf05l,mardfet,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"Auto-correct failed you: should be adjusted, not ""awe judged"".  Nice write-up though.

boxoffice,3bencz,Shruth1,2,Sun Jun 28 14:59:58 2015 UTC,Jurassic world also passed $500m in 17 days if estimates hold up! This movie is on track for a final gross of $670m and claiming that #2 all time spot between titanic and Avatar!

JW has been pretty near the Avengers on all 3 of its weekends so far (winning weekends 1 and 2, losing weekend 3), and the Avengers made $36.6 million it's 4th weekend. By comparison, the previous Terminator made $51.9 million it's first weekend, which was actually way below what it was predicted to make.  On the plus side for JW, Terminator's first weekend was Memorial Day Weekend, so that's actually a 4-day total instead of a 3 day.  However, on the minus side, Terminator came out on Thursday, so it's first weekend excludes the $12 million it made on it's first day. I also think there's more buzz for this movie than there was for the last one."
boxoffice,3bdvn0,rafiul9,37,Sun Jun 28 08:01:07 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the sub.  Short answer no.  Long answer (which someone else might elaborate on) is that Avatar was a perfect storm for box office success, a follow up to Titanic, then currently the biggest box office performer ever. 3D used correctly and the most stunning visual effects made thus far got people talking. These caused the film to have longevity at the box office which also took into account a lack of competition at the time of year it was released so it just hung out at the top longer than a summer flick will. The box office gross also has to take into account that because it was a 3D film made to be seen in 3D the ticket costs were higher.  Jurassic World is an unprecedented behemoth but not to that degree, and with new releases each week (Inside Out being nearly the same revenue in North America as JW on it's second week of release) show that it doesn't have the legs of Avatar.   It will no longer be the top grosser next weekend I gather.  As for the film that does dethrone Avatar I can't see anything doing that. Not even Star Wars 7. It'll happen eventually but not for the foreseeable future."
boxoffice,3bdvn0,Skyhooks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:24:14 2015 UTC,"You also forgot probably the most important factor: December release  Avatar didn't become the highest grossing movie thanks to a a large opening weekend, it got there because of week-in week-out performance.  The advantage of a December release is the fact that January and Febuary are absolute deadzones. The competition is low, you can continue to have good returns for 2 and a half months and slowly inch your way to a higher gross so long as word of mouth is strong.  Even in a summer with weak releases (which i believe the rest of this summer is filled) some tentpole release will eventually take away the wind in your sails and a movie's performance will peter out."

If you are going to be a regular box office follower like myself and others on this sub for years to come, you can expect to see Avatar's domestic record be challenged soon.Domestically, Jurassic world will maybe catch Titanic but not Avatar. Star wars 7 has the potential to challenge Avatar domestically but I do not think it will make it personally. Worldwide however , you can expect Avatar to sit on its throne for a LONG time. It won't be broken before 2020. It is just too hard to come close to 3 Billion when franchises like hunger games cannot even crack $1 billion"
boxoffice,3bdvn0,Shruth1,5,Sun Jun 28 13:13:17 2015 UTC,"No I'm Afraid not Avatar was an extremely rare event in the history of cinema. Avatar as others have pointed out had the perfect storm ever conceived. Why and How? James Cameron who directed Avatar was coming off Titanic (even though it came out in 1997 and Avatar 2009) Titanic was the most successful movie ever produced by hollywood for 13 years straight and won best picture has an enormous following world wide. It also was a at the time in 2009 the real coming of 3D into cinemas and 3D conversions were happening. A film like Avatar had never been made before using 3D as a viewing experience to make it apart of the movie (Gravity also did this) and it was also one of the first BIG hollywood movies to come out in IMAX around the world (yes there where a few like The polar express but those were small compared to this). James Cameron at the time took special effects to the next level to actually create realistic CGI worlds which before that was not done like avatar and was a huge selling point in advertising the movie. Avatar also had at the time a real star power of Sam Worthington who everyone said to be the next A list star along with sigorney weaver and michelle rodriguez. In the first week of opening Avatar grossed $77 mil on it's second weekend it slid 1.8%! That NEVER happens EVER to slide that much in it's second weekend, the average movie would drop around 40% or more in it's second week depending on the movie but to attain almost the entire crowd of people who saw it opening weekend and adding more as the weeks go by does not happen. But the most miraculous thing to happen to avatar  was in it's 5th week where it went up 8.1% to $54 mil only slipping 52.4% in 4 weeks overall. Avatar had a boost from getting numerous academy awards and rode that train like American Sniper did this year. With literally zero competition in 2009 to 2010 similar to Avatar it dominated for over 12 weeks in the top 5 and on the 13 week dropping to 7th place to $6mil which is what some top 5 at the box office looks like most times. With the added ticket prices going up Avatar was the probably the movie to add premium cinema experience much like the standard we have today with IMAX prices and 3D costing more wasn't heard of back then and started a major trend in hollywood that continues to this day. Jurassic World I'm afraid can't even match it world wide grossing $2 billion world wide and $760 domestically. That means every single session in the US and the world was pretty much sold out for months. Avatar was considered an epic picture back then with a run time of 2 hrs 42 mins (now i know that back in the golden age of hollywood and today some movies run longer than that but what avatar had going for it was it's scale much like Ben hur did back in 1959) it was the experience that drove people to avatar combined with very strong word of mouth and critics praising it become a phenomenon that spoke not only to the western world but different cultures around the world could understand with it's symbolic imagery. For Jurassic world to beat avatar it NEEDS 0 competition, critical acclaim and to be an experience. I don't think even Star Wars 7 can do the numbers avatar pulled. Remember it needs to in it's second week fall less than 2% which is the record to even be considered in the running and has to open to more than $84 million in December which is the record the first hobbit movie did back in 2012. Now that franchises are the big thing at the moment and some are even struggling to crack $1 billion (hunger games) Jurassic World will need a perfect storm that is impossible to have now. Avatar came out frankly at the right place in the right time the eve of a new era for hollywood filming for 3D and taking CGI to another level. To get close to those levels a movie NEEDS to change the entire game forever the way movies get marketed and how they are meant to be viewed comes into it in a huge way. Avatar now get's crap now for what it did to film making and for the story that back then NOBODY was saying that and if they did there probably lying as those figures for avatar suggests multiple viewings many times and actual stayed in the box office for a solid 34 weeks before getting pulled for Home video."

boxoffice,3bdvn0,Tyrone1988,3,Sun Jun 28 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"The summer release has the advantage of basically being able to capitalize off good marketing. Word of mouth helps, but has less of an impact on summer movies. The downfall is that the summer months are crowded so demand is burned off quickly for a movie. If you look at the top grossing movies of the last 10 years from summer months (excluding animated films) every one of them sees 60 to 70 % of their total domestic gross in the first two weeks. That puts the total domestic gross for JW anywhere from $635M-$742M with the most realistic amount probably being in the neighborhood of $650M.  If you look at the international you basically can assume somewhere around 65-70% of the total gross will be foreign to the US for a large movie like this. Movies like FF7 and Transformers:AoE are anomalies to that % range mainly because their domestic is quite a bit lower than the biggest movies. That puts the total international gross range anywhere from $1.8B to $2.5B with the realistic amount in the neighborhood of $2.0B.   I would put the chance of it passing Avatar overall in the neighborhood of 5%. It probably has about a 50/50 chance of passing Titanic for both domestic and international at this point."

Avatar and Titanic are the only 2 films to have grossed more than $2 billion worldwide (with Avatar being close to $3 billion). Extremely successful movies that broke all sorts of records like The Avengers and Furious 7, on the worldwide scale, are far behind in 3rd and 4th place with ""only"" $1.5 billion each.  So the real question for Jurassic World right now is, can it beat Titanic's domestic total to be the new #2, and can it possibly be the 3rd movie to make $2 billion worldwide.  I think the first one has a better chance but even that is uncertain."

boxoffice,3bbb73,Shruth1,2,Sat Jun 27 21:36:42 2015 UTC,"I think JW definitely has weaker prospects in the long run because there are blockbuster wannabe movies opening every weekend in the next month.

boxoffice,3bbb73,devakto,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:42:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's very impressive, but competition is a tradeoff you'll have to deal with in exchange for the benefits of mid-summer release, such as high weekday grosses. The main thing I'm wondering about is if it will  beat Titanic (final gross is $35 mil more than The Avengers).  JW is already $40 mil higher but if it can't maintain that margin, it may fall short of Titanic.  It can really go both ways right now."
boxoffice,3bbb73,Nayelia,7,Sun Jun 28 19:52:50 2015 UTC,Yup this is way too close to call. Either of them can take it. The crazy thing is though both these movies are making money without affecting each other which is really surprising

Just because 21/22 Jump Street has done well doesn't guarantee that other comedies will do well. Ted always seemed like a fun one-off idea for a movie.

The first one must have been the perfect confluence of timing, talent, and luck. Also, while Cusack on the screen wouldn't have made a huge difference, I read somewhere he fought tooth and nail to keep in most of the jokes in HTTM 1 and was integral to the editing of the film. So he was really missed on the sequel."

The best way for me to explain it is replace ted with African Americans and it basically turns into a film on how we've been treated throughout our history in America that just happens to be funny as fuck. They even mention Dred Scott. Seth McFarlane is a fucking genius."
boxoffice,3bayw7,pajamalamaobama,2,Mon Jul 6 04:20:16 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but the tone of the film really clashed with the plot for me.  A raunchy stoner comedy about...A civil rights court case?  I've never really felt like Seth McFarlane is particularly adept at political commentary unless it's setting up a stereotype to mock (like Stan as a stereotypical Republican), and Ted going that way didn't work for me.  I missed them just sort of hanging out.  The cheap gay jokes didn't help the tonal dissonance, especially that 'tying our dicks together' line(which actually managed to elicit an audible groan from the audience).  It's really tough to feel anything but tonal whiplash when they're surrounded by lazy ""lol gay people"" jokes that feel like they belong in a movie from 15 years ago.  Edit: thinking about it more, it's worth noting that aside from lazy jokes, a huge part of that whiplash for me has to do with the fact that a main theme is civil rights and the absurdity of calling into question anyone's validity as a human(even if they're a talking magic Teddy Bear).  This is preceded by a centerpiece joke about the fact that I as a trans woman don't actually exist and any attraction to me is a sickness that needs to be purged."
boxoffice,3bayw7,3000milestoSpacejam,26,Tue Jul 7 06:25:48 2015 UTC,"I think a few things really hurt it. Its premise seems flippant and probably offensive to some people considering the current controversies regarding civil rights dominating the political atmosphere. MacFarlane didn't help matters much yesterday when he tweeted ""Now help Ted get his rights and see Ted 2!"" right after the Supreme Court decision was laid out.  And to go from a stoner comedy to a stoner comedy court parody wasn't a great move when it comes to what the average person wants to see. Courtroom dramas struggle if the premise isn't ironclad - why see a shaggy courtroom comedy, then?   Of course, the biggest thing hurting Ted 2 is the competition level. The first one came out on a perfect release date, as it was slid up the schedule to replace a delayed blockbuster (GI Joe 2) that had, until that point, been big enough to prevent any other movies other than Magic Mike to risk opening the same weekend.   That was in addition to it coming out during a very weak, up to that point, summer - other than Avengers and a few other mid-tier successes, there had been at least six disappointments/flops at that point. Dark Shadows, Battleship, The Dictator, That's My Boy, Rock of Ages and Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter had left the box office pretty empty. As a result, Ted massively overperformed. And then Amazing Spider-Man, Savages and The Watch, the three movies that were its main competition for its target audience, all underperformed after it, allowing it to hold like a motherfucker.  In comparison, this one's up against one of the top 5 highest grossing films of all time and the highest-ever second-place opener. Kinda easy to see how it would take a hit in comparison."
boxoffice,3bayw7,PersianDj,9,Sat Jun 27 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the absence of Mila Kunis. Whose combination of beauty and likability as a female lead (playing a real character too) is a draw for both the key male and female demos.  *This isn't meant as a knock on Amanda Seyfried, but for context, Mila Kunis has over 10x as many fans on facebook as Seyfried. Inexact science for sure, but speaks to the difference in fandom for each actress.   And I think the absence of Kunis doubles as a loss in the sense that it makes the sequel feel particularly forced and rushed having been made without such a key character from the first--and one that was so key in making the main conflict of the first film actually feel strong and compelling."

boxoffice,3bayw7,JakkuScavenger,9,Sun Jun 28 10:04:42 2015 UTC,"Good points all around. I like your argument that Ted was really an anomaly. Ted 2 opening weekend is going to have hard time hitting the 2nd Weekend Total for Ted. That is a nose dive. Looking back at it more, Ted just seems like the weirdest thing. I mean Ted tied MIB3's opening that year with a 54mil and beat it on a per screen average. How the hell did that happen? So odd."
boxoffice,3bayw7,hatramroany,4,Sat Jun 27 18:25:08 2015 UTC,"MacFarlane recently stated about how he had to change the plot line of Ted 2 because it was the same exact thing as We're The Millers.  I think the whole ""court case to prove Ted is a person"" is a terrible plot, and I can see how something so shitty was the result of being thrown together at the last minute.  I think they should've stuck with the ""road trip to deliver weed"" idea, it's so much more suited for Ted. Even with We're The Miller's it's a year later and I don't think audiences are that critical of stoner comedies being similar to others.  The fact that this is the first comedy based around a court case means it's probably a shitty idea in the first place."

boxoffice,3bayw7,shehulk111,6,Sat Jun 27 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"From the people I've talked to, no one loves Ted. I mean most like it and maybe quote sections of it (I find lots of Macfarlanes work very quotable) but it's really not that funny of a movie. I mean parts are VERY funny, but as a whole it wasn't all that fun, in fact it was EXTREMELY boring at parts. It sort of lacked that comedy vibe. For Example both Jump Street films and the hangover have great vibes and flow great from moment to moment. Ted just has moments. I think because of this (partly due to the fact that Ted 1 and 2 don't actually have plots or a functioning causality) there really isn't a reason to watch them again. I mean the reason why I love the Hangover is that I love the plot and I think you could take all of the jokes out of that movie and it would still be great. So Ted is fine, it just doesn't really leave a good taste in the mouth afterwards. I think this is the reason why people who saw the first one and liked it in theatres (Like this guy typing this text) are sceptical of the new one. Macfarlane is very repetitive and once you see enough of his shit shtick it can get very tiring. I wish he would move on and maybe find a collaborator. Ex. If he could create a musical and hire some helpful talent from Broadway. He's a talented man but I really wish he would challenge himself.   TLDR: Comedies work a lot better when they have strong plot lines."

I could watch Hot Tub Time Machine over and over again, one of the reasons is that it  has a super tight structur. Looser comedies play well on first watch or two, but fall flat after that. Look at Knocked Up. I thought it was hilarious when it came out. I watched it again a couple weeks ago, what a Fucking mess. That mess was replicated in epic form with Funny People. I wish the studios would take writing more seriously like they did in the golden days. I haven't scene a comedy that can touch anything Billy Wilder wrote."
boxoffice,3bayw7,Cynicbats,2,Sat Jun 27 22:24:27 2015 UTC,"Trailer for the first one was far better especially factoring the novelty factor of watching a smart-ass teddy bear drink, brawl with Wahlberg, and surround himself with hookers."

boxoffice,3bayw7,Asdyc,5,Sat Jun 27 18:37:39 2015 UTC,I think the reason why it was projected to do 50 mill and didn't is because it has two very tough competition with 'Jurassic World' and 'Inside Out'.

ET got the #1 weekend box office spot in its 26th week of release. This is mind blowing and impossible to achieve today. Also Gone with the winds $1.6 billion dollar adjusted gross is near unbreakable and a close second. These records are not associated with the actual raw gross so newer movie with the inflation increase advantage do not gain an advantage, which makes it 100 times harder"

boxoffice,3b9vxm,JakkuScavenger,8,Sat Jun 27 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of records that have been standing for more than 10 years:   Revenge of the Sith (2005) Thursday gross and opening Thursday.  The Passion of the Christ (2004) highest grossing R-rated movie.  Showgirls (1995) highest grossing NC-17 rated movie. My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) - highest grossing movie to never hit #1. Space Station 3D (2002) - highest grossing IMAX-only release. Titanic (1997) - highest grossing 8 through 12 weekends. E.T. (1982) - most weekends at #1, top 5, consecutive top 5, top 10 and consecutive top 10. Titanic (1997) - most consecutive weekends at #1.   Regarding the last two records, it should be noted that there were no regular weekend box office updates before 1980, so no one really knows how many weekends movies such as Star Wars and Gone with the Wind spent at #1. For example: Star Wars spent at least 21 weeks at number 1 back in the 70's according to boxofficemojo and if you add its 1997 re-release that number grows to at least 24 weekends at number 1, which is more than the 16 weekends at number 1 they're reporting for E.T."
boxoffice,3b9vxm,Jon-Osterman,5,Sat Jun 27 07:02:16 2015 UTC,"unless a movie has the legginess of My Big Fat Greek Wedding AND the momentum of Avatar, i don't see Titanic's records being taken down at any point. Not ET even.  Showgirls and Space Station 3D are more specialized (Showgirls is the only NC17 film to be released wide) but maybe something interesting is the highest grossing movie never to hit the top 5, which the Imitation Game came achingly close to beating.  The records of Revenge Of The Sith and The Matrix Reloaded are like the record that The Day After Tomorrow held until Inside Out's release: sure they've been standing for long, but it's far from impossible that they'll be beaten some time soon. Same goes for The Passion Of The Christ: if American Sniper had an even leggier run than it already did, it'd probably claim that record."
boxoffice,3b9vxm,JakkuScavenger,6,Sat Jun 27 08:35:07 2015 UTC,"By the way if Jurassic World wins this weekend, Inside Out might never hit number one and end up outgrossing My Big Fat Greek Wedding."
boxoffice,3b9vxm,Jon-Osterman,2,Sat Jun 27 10:28:17 2015 UTC,Which would be the largest non-first place 2nd weekend? (Currently it's Man Of Steel with $41 million)

boxoffice,3b9vxm,JakkuScavenger,2,Sun Jun 28 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"Regarding Revenger of the Sith - there is currently no major movie scheduled to be released on a Thursday for the next three or four years at least.

boxoffice,3b9vxm,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:54:10 2015 UTC,Generally demand is burnt off when you don't open on a Friday. Case in point: Only four movies that didn't open on a Friday have had a $100m+ opening weekend

Maybe once the US population gets out of hand it could happen, but definitely not in the near future. Avatar, the most zeitgeist-capturing movie of the last 17 years, didn't even break 100,000,000 tickets-sold domestically.   More specifically, number of tickets per capita, the record for which is also held by Gone With The Wind, will likely never be broken. That's just because of how much more there is to do than go to the movies today, unlike 1939 America."

On that note, how about E.T spending 16 weeks at the #1 spot?

For example I can't seem to find any kind of number attached to how many tickets Jurassic World sold in its opening weekend, just the total dollar amount."
boxoffice,3b9vxm,UnluckyLuke,3,Sat Jun 27 04:39:22 2015 UTC,"Hollywood doesn't keep records of the number of tickets sold, the business is literally all about money, and because ticket prices are different at various theaters and showings, 3rd party analysts use very rough estimates based on average ticket price.  The studios themselves don't care if it's 1 person willing to pay $1 million to see the movie, or 1 million people paying $1 each.  Plus they have really terrible record keeping.  I used to audit that stuff =("
boxoffice,3b9vxm,Juswantedtono,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:24:37 2015 UTC,Exactly. Those adjusted for ticket price inflation numbers you see are not based on tickets sold. The MPAA keeps record of the average ticket price for every year. When they adjust for ticket price inflation they simply take what the movie grossed divide it by what the average ticket price was during its release and multiply it by today's average ticket price.

Selling international distribution rights and product placement and merchandising deals. It's not so common today, but the mid budget 80's movies it happened from time to time."
boxoffice,3b7ll2,mealsharedotorg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:52:57 2015 UTC,"You guys forget that the studio does not get all of the money made, they have to divy it up with the theater, not to mention any writers, actors, directors, producers that may have points on the film - which they get before the studio gets theirs.  It's very difficult to tell whether a studio has made their money back on a film, they usually don't until it hits home video/syndication."
boxoffice,3b7ll2,GoddammitCricket,2,Fri Jun 26 20:00:26 2015 UTC,I've always thought the rule of thumb was a movie needs to make about twice its budget at the box office to break even.

In those cases, the studios had very little say in the making of those films other than controlling the budget. In fact, the head of production at 20th Century had to convince the board of directors not to shut down production on Star Wars! (http://larry-vaughn.com/scifi-fans-thank-your-lucky-stars-for-this-man/).  In an interview, Shane Black stated that he was nervous about taking the reins of Iron Man 3, but Jon Favreau explained that a Marvel production was like a big machine with a lot folks supporting you to make sure you don't mess up. On the other hand, Joss Whedon has expressed frustration with studio interference and Edgar Wright up and quit.  So, the franchise studios probably prefer to find talented directors who don't have a lot of clout that they can control."

boxoffice,3b3j0x,JamesHouse,24,Thu Jun 25 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"To piggyback off you with more examples:   Argo did it in its 3rd weekend, somehow, utilizing incredibly small holds to beat some holdovers and four new releases ranging from mediocre to flops - Cloud Atlas, Silent Hill 2, Fun-Size and Chasing Mavericks - on October 26-28, 2012.   Dolphin Tale managed to go from 3 to 1 in its second weekend, holding just enough to beat Moneyball and Lion King 3D, Sept. 30-Oct 2, 2011.  The Blind Side used a good hold to leap over the cratering Twilight: New Moon and do it Dec. 2-4, 2009.  I had to go back eight years for the next example that you hadn't already mentioned. Elf dropped just 15 percent to gross $26m while Matrix Revolutions fell 66 percent and Master and Commander fell just short at $25.1m on November 14-16, 2003.  This is as far back as I'll go, but it's easily the most impressive: There's Something About Mary opened at #4 on July 17-19, 1998. The Mask of Zorro beat it that weekend. It was then beaten, weekly, by Saving Private Ryan four times and Blade twice. Finally, over Labor Day weekend, September 4-7, in its eighth weekend at the box office, Mary finally had her day, beating Blade by less than $150,000 - 10.92m to 10.788m."

boxoffice,3b3j0x,GoldandBlue,13,Thu Jun 25 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"Looking at Pixar's other non-sequel movies in their second weekend gives some fairly decent hope that Inside Out can hold at least in the -35% range.  Monsters, Inc.:  -27.2%  The Incredibles:  -28.7%  Toy Story:  -30.8%  Finding Nemo: -33.7%  Up: -35.2%  Ratatouille:  -38.3%  Cars:  -43.9%  A Bug's Life:  -48.4%  WALL-E:  -48.5%  Brave:  -48.6%  Of the movies over -40%, WALL-E is the only one that had comparable critical love (98% fresh), but I don't think that movie has as much replay appeal to it as some of the other Pixar movies and I don't remember it having quite the word of mouth that Inside Out currently has.  If Inside Out can manage around a 35% drop, it will be in the $60M range and could definitely be ahead of Jurassic World.  Of course non of those movies had the debut Inside Out did, which could mean that it was very front loaded and make it more likely to see a drop closer to 50%.   Hard to say for sure, but considering its is currently making almost identical to Jurassic World in the weekday box office, it seems like it has some legs on it."

boxoffice,3b1qh4,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:16:39 2015 UTC,No. BOM's inflation calculator does not take 3D movies into account.

Inside Out sold more tickets in its opening weekend than The Day After Tomorrow according to the estimates.
boxoffice,3b1qh4,terp02andrew,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:19:57 2015 UTC,"That's estimated tickets. They just take what the movie made and divide it by the average ticket price.

Ted 2 might be a walk-up movie which means social media/fandango tracking will only tell you so much.   I would be extremely surprised if it wins the weekend.  I can see I/O and JW being close.

Sometimes pure conjecture based off of a 'feel'. In 2010, I predicted Toy Story 3 would open at $110.3 million and it made $110.307 million.

If anything, this tells us how hard the Reddit circlejerk really works, or how preferences for movies have changed (one crazy fight scene at the end? it's great!).  That movie blew chunks, Chris Pratt is a terrible dramatic actor (but a great loveable fool), and I honestly didn't think it was better than JP2 or JP3. Those movies arguably had fewer plot holes than JW.  If Star Wars is halfway decent and doesn't outgross it, I will be extremely disappointed."
boxoffice,3awctq,jaypeg25,6,Wed Jun 24 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"The reddit circlejerk leading up to the release was super negative. Most of the top posts in threads relating to the movie involved either ""the dialog sounds like it sucks"" or ""trained velociraptors? thats dumb"" to just plain ""this movie looks like its going to suck"".  It's possible the fact that it was better than the low expectations led it to become so quickly adored by the hivemind of reddit. When you go in thinking something is going to suck, and it doesn't entirely suck, you'll have a better outlook about it walking out of the theater.  Personally, I was as excited a year ago to see it as I was on opening night, and it more or less lived up to my expectations. I like Chris Pratt. I like dinosaurs. I loved how real the park itself seemed to be. And my favorite scene (spoilers) wasn't even the final dinosaur battle, but the one halfway through the movie where the i-rex and the Ankylosaurus fought. It was really cool to see the Ankylosaurus try and use its defenses (hard shell and a damn club at the end of its tail). If anything I wished it went more into that dino on dino dynamic..but hey, there's always room for the sequel"

If I ever get to see a halfway decent Jurassic World I'll be thrilled.  I was just so frustrated with the plot holes. It was all so unbelievable, from the two goofy people manning the control room to the lone lazy security guard at the 'super dinosaur' compound to the actions of the park management and InGen."
boxoffice,3awctq,tgeezy,2,Wed Jun 24 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"The plot would have been avoided though if the people there have a decent set of brains. There wouldn't be a movie if it weren't for the idiots in control. Investing $25 million in a hyper agressive t-rex that is super intelligent and have the best traits of many dinosaurs and other animals? That's sound like its gonna end well. Also, why the fuck would you go inside the pit when you don't know where the i rex was. That was just pure stupidity."

Critically acclaimed art films like Boyhood or Birdman isnt going to be in the top five highest grossing movies of all time. Its these action packed, popcorn munching blockbuster films based on popular franchises that will be making the money. To be honest, I enjoyed Furious 7 and Jurassic World even though most of the scenes are ridiculous.  Yeah, when I saw the Fast and Furious movies back in the 2000s decade, I thought it would die off completely after the fourth film and that everyone would just forget about it. There was no way in hell I would thought this would become one of the biggest movie franchises of all time and that one of the film would actually be in the top 20 highest grossing films of all time let alone the third highest grossing film of all time. I felt that since Fast Five focused more on action pieces rather than just street racing, that might have made the franchise more accessible to people didnt care much for imported cars and street racing but love watching action scenes and explosions. Paul Walker death might have also signficantly contributed to Furious 7 insane box office grosses."

boxoffice,3axipu,filmmak,4,Sat Jun 27 07:11:57 2015 UTC,My reasoning is that the highest grossing weekend EVER in December was the Hobbit at 85 million.  Historically people wait till xmas day and/or vacation week to see it with friends and relatives.  It won't be easy to do 210 million in December.  Now if they went with a Summer release it would be a no brainier.
boxoffice,3axipu,LOTRcrr,0,Sat Jun 27 12:21:53 2015 UTC,"the highest grossing weekend EVER in December was the Hobbit at 85 million   And? We're comparing apples to oranges here. Yes, its the same month, but since when was April a big month for films? In the past few years, Captain America and FF7 proved that otherwise. Same idea here.   It won't be easy to do 210 million in December   I'll agree with you here, but everyone here seems to be very hesitant on it being a small release. I say this will break the December release record by day 2, if not Friday night alone."
boxoffice,3axipu,filmmak,4,Sat Jun 27 21:59:48 2015 UTC,Obviously it's going to break the hobbit record. I never said it wouldn't. I simply disagree with everyone who thinks it's going to crush JW easily. Hence the historically comparison.

boxoffice,3aw4x4,SandmanAlcatraz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late to the party here, but I wanted to comment.  I've been running my own ""Fantasy Box Office"" for about three years and only now are the online offerings good enough for me to stop doing it myself, by hand...  I've done it a few ways. First time out I found about 8 people and we did an auction. I give them a list of all the movies (wide releases only), links to all the trailers and we'd have a conference call and everyone got 100 points to bid on movies. The order of the offer was random to keep it fair. Typically tentpoles underperformed based on what people paid. Winners typically won by get more $80-120MM performers.  Other times when we only had 4 or five participants, we'd do a schoolyard pick.  The last time I did it, I gave everyone a spreadsheet with all the summer movies and they picked what ""share"" of each movie they wanted. You could take up to 15% of any movie as little as 3% and you had to pick at least 10 movies. This was great because it didn't require getting everyone together at once and I got 15 people to do it.  The real shortcoming with all of these is that it's kind of set it and forget it. Once the season starts, it's on autopilot which is kinda nice, but also kind of boring.  I'm really taking a shine to Fantasy Movie League. It's got a simple interface and you can easily make private leagues. Each week you fill your fantasy cineplex with movies that are given a price based on expected performance.  I'm happy to share my Excel spreadsheets if you're interested in any of the DIY stuff."

boxoffice,3av83n,Peterfug,3,Wed Jun 24 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. The art form is alive and well. More people than ever are making movies and the art of cinema is being pushed to limits never imagined before. Big budget mass market movies may often be shlock but that does not mean the art is dead. They are mass market after all, the heart of cinema is the independent movie makers. Doom and gloom gets us no where."
boxoffice,3av83n,mythmaster,-3,Wed Jun 24 03:03:45 2015 UTC,"I never said the art is dead. I believe it is getting a slow death unless we demand more from Hollywood. Around 80% of money is going towards the bad stuff. It's not even being contained to just summer season but taking over other seasons. Indie films do make a ripple and sometimes big difference. Studios cater towards the masses who dont care or are just ignorant. Films like Jurassic make waaaay too mich and keep the industry at a stand still because obviously people respond more to brainless dumb action. Alot of films are rushed, tv dinnered versions. 70-75% of Hollywood is sequels, prequels, remakes, re-imaginings, etc. Less risks are taken and passion projects are becoming scarcer. Less funding is going to things that need funding and mlre money is going to shared universes or sequels or whatever. The masses can't support their opinions of liking the brainless stuff besides just saying I like it and that's what matters. I can go on and on. You would think since more money is coming in, more risks and more money would go to mid budget or indie films but it doesn't. It's put into the already bloated budgets of blockbusters. We get more needless CGI or more subplots that are still one dimensional. Records are higher and higher and studios are chasing and chasing and trying to beat and it's just an endless snowball effect and it is better worse and worse. Little progress is ever made since everything is focused on blockbusters now. Even in an age where its all about visuals, we arent even pushing visuals to the limit. We just keep making more and more forgettable CGI. Films like Mad Max pushed the envelope. It may not have gotten much mass attention but it did everything right from passion, arcs, development, practical effects, marketing, action and even 3D. I'm missing alot but you get the point. Then something like Jurassic comes along that somewhat undermines the advances of Mad Max and will make 5-6x as much as Mad Max. It's dying slowly and is the total opposite of what you think"

I wonder where it'll wind up at in Merry 'Ole England? BOM says that HP:DH2 did $116m, and Skyfall wound up with $160m. So it sounds like it'll at least hit $125m if not quite a bit more."

The UK has been a weak market the last 3 years (Every year between 2006 and 2012 there was 1 $100m film in the UK, but none since 2012's Skyfall, the current record holder at $160m). It could well end up 4th all time behind Skyfall, Avatar and Mama Mia."

It's been out for a couple years and most of the reviews are from 2013 and 2014 and the last update mentions July so it has been awhile since it was updated.  I tried it and it kept crashing on my Galaxy S5.  It also wouldn't give me an option for selecting an actor.

boxoffice,3asomd,bigkix,-18,Thu Jun 25 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"That's not all the impressive. With inflation and 3D prices more films should be making 400 million but, with big budget films selling fewer and fewer tickets these day's any success is good. This film will probably finish at 600 million plus which will put its ticket sales around Shrek 2, TDK, and The Avengers."

Even with inflation there's a reason it's the only movie to do so in that amount of time. Even if a lot of tickets are matched for inflation to today's value. There's still only a dozen or so in history of film that could have matched that"
boxoffice,3asomd,moonwalkersb,-10,Tue Jun 23 18:34:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not that easily impressed. Many film's probably could have done this, most film these days don't even releases at the same time world wide like JW did, if you look deeper into its success you can see its nothing special. I may have been a bit surprised but it takes more to impress me, Avatar was impressive, Titanic, TDK, Spiderman 2002, Star Wars, Jurassic park, ghost Busters, just to name a few, those are impressive box office hits, and if it had the same ticket prices I'm sure TDK probably would have done the same if not better than JW. Fast is nice but I like the end results better, a movie can make all it wants as fast as it wants to but where its number stops is what really matters. This type of Record will become more common place as years go one thanks to inflation and 3D, and pretty soon this wont look so impressive any more, heck one day it will look pretty silly compared to future box office hits."

Alright so yes it is impressive but not to the point everyone make's it out to be like no other film would ever do what Avenger's did, its definitely a huge surprise like if any film was gonna beat it this would probably not even make the list but, i'm sure if films like Hunger Game CF, TDK, TDKR or Spiderman 3 had sold as many 3D tickets as JW did then, they all would have runs close to if not better than JW did, thats what i'm trying to get across here,   If you don't wanna chat with me no more that's fine ill let you go, just trying to talk here ill go find another thread and talk with people, sorry if I ruined your post, was not trying to, and good luck in Hollywood"

boxoffice,3ar61a,mrstickball,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:44:26 2015 UTC,$55m is totally reasonable - the hold to week 2 really shows this movie is going to have legs. $50m is almost a guarantee - heavier drops won't happen until Terminator takes all the IMAX screens.
boxoffice,3ar61a,RidiculousHat,6,Wed Jun 24 05:37:45 2015 UTC,"2 crazy weeks at the box office. JW breaks opening weekend, opening week, 2nd weekend and worldwide opening records, then Inside Out smashes the original movie opening record and crushes the non #1 opening week record (90m compared to 68m!).  Next year June is going to be a busy schedule as everyone tries to capture what was until this year the start of a general slowdown in the boxoffice."
boxoffice,3ar61a,FartingBob,7,Mon Jun 22 23:33:45 2015 UTC,Who remembers people aaying it would get less than that on weekend 1?
boxoffice,3ar61a,superegz,6,Tue Jun 23 05:36:13 2015 UTC,"Congrats to JW. It won't snag the third weekend record, as I don't see it falling less than 40%, which it would need to in order to match Avatar's $68.5 million. Regardless, it's been a pretty incredible run so far. It'll definitely break $500 million, and could even breach $600 million if it has really good legs."
boxoffice,3ar61a,kayjay734,6,Mon Jun 22 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"It won't snag the third weekend record, as I don't see it falling less than 40%   That all depends on how the media treat this. If this news gets out there on every media station all week it could have a bit of an avatar effect, but again, all depends on the media. The film itself wont do it, but if they really get out there and start selling the fact that its the fastest to X number, and Best X number people will go see it just because."
boxoffice,3ar61a,SethR0gen,11,Mon Jun 22 23:08:54 2015 UTC,"At this point, $600m is just about a lock. Its trending better than The Avengers, and it easily (relatively) broke the $600m barrier. Now, that isn't to say it'll easily get there, but it'd have to have some crazy, A-typical drops to not hit $600m. How much past that mark, is impossible to say.  But I'd say that $600m/$1.6b is the floor at this point. It had the 2nd best weekend despite the largest opening in history for a movie in 2nd place... That speaks volumes about how popular JW is."

Jurassic World didn't drop very heavily in most major world markets... 1% in Germany, 32% in the UK, and many other markets (Mexico, South Korea, ect) were in that 30% range.. Only about 1/3rd of the major markets saw >50% drops, which is EXTREMELY good. We may be looking at $1.3 billion by the end of next week. If that happens, the original Titanic gross may be in play."

boxoffice,3aq3hi,NeilPoonHandler,6,Mon Jun 22 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"Eh... Avatar's third weekend is $68 million. Jurassic World would have to drop less than 35% to beat that. I just don't see it. If it does beat that record, it might very well be on its way to beating Avatar. However, I doubt it. Look for Jurassic World to settle in the $625-675 million range domestic."
boxoffice,3aq3hi,JakkuScavenger,4,Mon Jun 22 18:37:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'll touch $68M next weekend. Mostly because Ted 2 should take away more business than Battleship took from Avengers in 2012. Jurassic should still get around $50M, which I think is enough to top Ted. Inside Out may win the weekend though - Pixar's 2nd weekend drops are usually pretty small.  JW has much harsher competition, May 2012 was super weak after its first weekend.  This also had an effect on Age of Ultron, as PP2 and Mad Max took chunks out of it in its third weekend."
boxoffice,3aq3hi,GoddammitCricket,9,Mon Jun 22 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"This is hugely impressive, considering that Avenger's biggest 2nd week competition was Dark Shadows, which went on to gross less overall than IO just did its first weekend."

The last film was only 6 years ago, and the sort of gritty, apocalyptic future trend it represents has been pretty thoroughly explored in movies and television recently.  I just don't know that there's a big market for what it represents right now. (Unless it pulls in spectacular reviews, in which case all bets are off.)"
boxoffice,3aq3hi,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:52:43 2015 UTC,Terminator is an old franchise but it's not nostalgic...we just had a Terminator film six years ago and they aren't marketing it in a nostalgic manner like they did with JW.
boxoffice,3aq3hi,AudacityofTrope,-2,Tue Jun 23 18:57:49 2015 UTC,I don't see how this franchise deserves this success or how this movie has appealed to so many people. We have one classic and two mediocre romps than ostensibly shat on the source material. I just don't get it.
boxoffice,3aq3hi,echothree33,4,Mon Jun 22 23:39:07 2015 UTC,"Looking toward box office success to determine what a movie ""deserves"" is a weird.  Save your outrage for the awards shows.  The movie has undeniably connected with audiences in a way few movies do, including far lesser annual Bay flick or YA screen translation.  Perhaps those members of critical circles that turn their noses up at such a connection and the taste of such a wide, diverse audience should re-evaluate their own position on the merits of this film, rather than asking the millions who've enjoyed it so much that they've delivered enthusiastic reports to friends to do so.    This film got its opening weekend based largely on the nostalgia for Jurassic Park.  It's subsequent and continued success are largely due to its own merits (which, yes, includes more affection for the first film, but that affection is not something that's occurring independent of the film-maker's decisions).  Jurassic Park III showed what happens when you try to coast on franchise association alone while delivering a poor product.  This film, on the other hand, was very well-made and exceptionally good at accomplishing what it set out to do."

On Friday, Ted 2 will kill its draw from adult males (admittedly its lowest concern). July 1, Terminator kills its adult and young male draw, because it's Terminator and it's PG-13 for kids to see respectively, and Magic Mike kills the adult female market. Then, on July 10, Minions kills its kid market, and on July 17, Ant-Man and Trainwreck further kill its adult male and family, and adult male and female audiences, respectively.  Monsters U is its best comparison with slightly boosted figures, as MU went up against a high-profile R-rated comedy in its second weekend, a PG-13 actioner (and a Despicable Me movie) in its third and a high-profile actioner and a big comedy in its fourth. I'd see IO ending between $310 and $330m.  Brave also went up against Ted and Magic Mike early in its run, so that's a viable comparison as well."

I think Ant-Man will do well if Marvel can get the hype train moving and Paul Rudd is a familiar face among audiences so they have that going for them. Also if it's a genuinely good movie and has good word of mouth that will help. I can see it making at least $500 mil worldwide, which is conservative for a Marvel film."

It should at least beat F7 globally, but it'll be interesting to see how high it goes, as a $470m weekday/2nd weekend is really unfathomable. That'd suggest that a $250-300m second weekdays/3rd weekend may be attainable.. Putting it around $1.25b extremely fast."

boxoffice,3al5pl,fracfar,6,Sun Jun 21 07:24:59 2015 UTC,"You thought yours was conservative? I estimated it would make $67 million, so now I'm way off :/"
boxoffice,3al5pl,Shruth1,0,Sun Jun 21 11:29:39 2015 UTC,I thought it was gonna make $20 million boy was I wrong
boxoffice,3al5pl,fracfar,4,Sun Jun 21 14:07:11 2015 UTC,That would make it the lowest grossing Pixar wide release. Why so low?
boxoffice,3al5pl,Pripat99,9,Sun Jun 21 14:09:09 2015 UTC,"So I spent an entire week defending IO from being called a flop, and even I predicted $72 million in the end. The tracking was at $60+ million, and so it looks like another week where the tracking is way off (looking to be by 50% or so). I'm glad I was wrong on my estimate though - this looks like a brilliant addition to the Pixar library (and if I was going to be wrong, I'd rather be wrong and lowball it than be wrong and overestimate it)!"
boxoffice,3al5pl,MeteoricHorizons,9,Sun Jun 21 12:40:05 2015 UTC,They're low balling it; Inside Out is gonna get $95M+ and Jurassic World is gonna get $105M+
boxoffice,3al5pl,Mysterian,3,Sun Jun 21 09:21:12 2015 UTC,"So those Friday/Saturday estimates put Inside Out at around $65 mil, and Jurassic World at around $59 mil with Sunday to go.  2015 has been all about bucking history, I think Pixar still has a shot at an upset tomorrow."
boxoffice,3al5pl,cultstatus,13,Sun Jun 21 07:59:59 2015 UTC,I think I'd consider JW's 2nd weekend beating a Pixar movie more of an upset.

boxoffice,3aj6eo,249ba36000029bbe9749,16,Sat Jun 20 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"I think some people here are possibly being a bit too hasty to think Inside Out will slip heavily, both of Pete Docter's previous 2 Pixar films (Monster's Inc. and Up) actually had bigger Saturday's than Friday's, and seeing as this film is getting such great reviews I can see it following the same pattern.  EDIT: In fact, looking back at Pixar's films, 7 total made more on Saturday than Friday, that's 50% of their films (not including IO, obviously). Of those that did drop none fell further than 10%, and most fell in the 5-7% range. Since 2008, of the 6 films they've released, only one had a Saturday increase which might be seen as indicative that this one will too, however the one that didn't fall was Up - directed by Pete Docter, the director of IO. Overall I suspect IO could well increase it's Saturday intake, but if it doesn't I doubt the drop will be much, probably only a few percent."
boxoffice,3aj6eo,Gamb1993,2,Sat Jun 20 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Up was released in May when a lot of schools are still in session. Too lazy to look up Monsters Inc but didn't it release in Thanksgiving week? Holidays make things funky. Pixar movies recently have been ""event movies"" which means they make more on opening day than on day 2 nowadays."
boxoffice,3aj6eo,Juswantedtono,11,Sat Jun 20 23:38:51 2015 UTC,"Inside Out had $3.7m in previews added to Friday. Additionally, there's usually pent-up demand on Friday for major movies like IO.   Alternatively, Jurassic World is likely to get a 40-50% increase from Friday. Father's Day will also positively impact JW, as new releases on Father's Day weekend are not effected by the holiday, but holdovers always are.  It'll be close, but JW is likely to hit $45-50m tomorrow, while IO will probably do $35-40m."
boxoffice,3aj6eo,mrstickball,7,Sat Jun 20 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"New releases tend to be more front-loaded, which is why IO will likely have a higher percentage of its weekend coming from Friday. JW will probably stay steady or even increase on Saturday and Sunday while Friday was probably IO's biggest day of the weekend."
boxoffice,3aj6eo,uncheel3,3,Sat Jun 20 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"Tuesday previews were factored into the IO Friday gross, so it isn't a huge beat. Also PIXAR movies tend to be a bit front loaded and the Fathers' Day weekend should help action movies like JW."
boxoffice,3aj6eo,MeteoricHorizons,5,Sat Jun 20 18:55:14 2015 UTC,Ahhh. The Thursday factor explains it. Thanks.
boxoffice,3aj6eo,best_in_life,4,Sat Jun 20 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Thursday factor also played a part. But /u/MeteoricHorizons is indicating to the fact that IO had select screenings on Tuesday as well (some 600+ 661 screens), and I believe Disney added those numbers to the Friday total.  EDIT:    Friday’s IO receipts are also propped by last night’s $3.7M plus 661 Tuesday Fathom shows.   source"
boxoffice,3aj6eo,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"Opening Fridays tend to be front-loaded to the point that they often earn more than Saturdays. During the second and subsequent weekends, Saturdays get a boost. For example Toy Story 3 fell almost 10% on Saturday. Even Brave, a Pixar original, had a 4% drop on Saturday. Meanwhile Jurassic World grossed as much as The Avengers on its second Friday and that movie had a 47% boost on Saturday."
boxoffice,3aji9v,ItsBobDoleYo,12,Sat Jun 20 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, should be a first. I think the closest we got was when Avatar and Sherlock both had a 60M+ weekend in 2009.   At this point, we might be looking at a top 2 with 90M+ each since IO is not staying too far behind JW."
boxoffice,3aji9v,best_in_life,5,Sat Jun 20 20:33:40 2015 UTC,$72 + $68 Shrek 2 and Day after tomorrow vs $75 and $62 for avatar and Sherlock Holmes. So Shrek and Day After Tomorrow win slightly.

boxoffice,3aji9v,mealsharedotorg,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"there's been a lot of times when there's been two 60M+ weekends (The Day After Tomorrow, World War Z, Frozen, etc)  That's what happens when a highly anticipated movie opens in the shadow of an uber-blockbuster, for instance the second weekends of Shrek 2 and The Hunger Games 2. In this case the demand for the new release is really high (e.g. what if The Incredibles opened after POTC 2? Or what if Spider-Man and Star Wars Ep II clashed back in 2002?)"
boxoffice,3aji9v,Jon-Osterman,3,Sat Jun 20 21:26:41 2015 UTC,Next weekend we might see three 50M+ weekends. The closest we've been to something like that was Revenger of the Sith's second weekend and Avatar's second weekend.
boxoffice,3aji9v,JakkuScavenger,3,Mon Jun 22 13:56:09 2015 UTC,I'm aging myself but as a kid from the 80's I remember Ghostbusters and Gremlins dominated the box-office the summer of 84.  It was the #1 and #2 movie through out most of the summer.  For a frame of reference I tired to take their opening weekend and adjust for inflation but it seems their combined weekend would only be @ 68 million.

Don't pretend that you secretly knew the truth and were just keeping it a secret.   ""Here are my predictions, and I KNOW these are right"", because I know I can mess up and look like a fool.   Yup. Potentially being wrong is the price of making predictions. That doesn't make you look like a fool, though. What makes you look like a fool is saying, ""Oh, yeah, I totally predicted the lottery numbers last week. Kept it to myself, of course. Can't believe everybody else got them wrong!""   I don't know who seriously thought this was only going to do $120M.   Virtually everyone who actually made a prediction instead of just convincing themselves that they'd made one after they already knew the outcome.

boxoffice,3ajxf6,Shruth1,4,Sat Jun 20 23:18:48 2015 UTC,"$85 million is still pretty damn good for Inside Out. The audiences for the two movies are similar but different too, can't see many parents taking really young kids to see Jurassic World.  Also remember half the audience for Pixar films constitute as adult aged, especially if it is a movie that reviewed well like Inside Out. The only time a Pixar movie didn't deliver was when they made one that reviewed poorly that didn't appeal to adults at all (Cars 2)  The bigger question in my mind is just how Jurassic World is doing as insanely well as it is. I really think it's just because it's the first blockbuster movie of the summer that is doing something relatively different (superheroes have been the mainstay for awhile) and a lot of other blockbusters like Tomorrowland failed to really generate any excitement or buzz. I see its success more because there was not much else to get excited for at the time."
boxoffice,3ajxf6,coldermilk,2,Sun Jun 21 06:06:29 2015 UTC,10-20% higher I'd say

Incredible Friday all around - it's nice to see Pixar doing amazing business again with Inside Out (who would have thought that this would do $90 million+ on opening weekend?), which is apparently a pretty great film. I can't wait to see it myself."

boxoffice,3aie8k,DaveFincher,3,Sat Jun 20 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"Average ticket prices have been slowing down a bit the past few years. In 2010 the average ticket price was $7.89, while in 2014 it was $8.17. That's an average of 0.88% increase per year. If the current trend continues it would take Avatar 27 years to cross $1 billion, adjusted for inflation. (At this point Avatar would have $794.6m x 1.008827 = $1,006.7m)"
boxoffice,3aie8k,JakkuScavenger,2,Sat Jun 20 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"The Exorcist is next up in line. It will break $900m domestic this year i would assume so id say in the next 6-7 years it will get it.

boxoffice,3aie8k,Shruth1,2,Sat Jun 20 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"If the new trilogy is any good, I could see Episode 9 hitting 1 billion domestic if it actually ended the Star Wars saga (or at least the main plotline with the original actors).  1 billion is an insane number, but its only 100 million tickets in the US @ $10/ea.   I think what will be just as interesting is who hits $1 billion for a movie first - the USA or China. China could very well have a billion-dollar grossing movie in 10 years if not sooner."

To pull something like 2+ billion dollars, you have to have truly universal movie that anyones grandma can go to see, something like Titanic. Star Wars has such a complicated backstory that no one who has not seen previous 6 won't go to see it. In Reddit it might seem that everyone has seen old Star Wars movies but there are plenty of people who haven't.  That's also same reason why Avengers 2 didn't do as well as Reddit predicted: I can't take my parent's to watch Avengers 2 when they haven't seen any other MCU movies.

boxoffice,3ah6u0,confluencer,3,Mon Jun 22 08:11:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think Star Wars as a franchise is that dense to get into. It's become ingrained into pop culture like no other film - you can have gone your whole life without seeing one of the movies, and you'll still absorb the mythos from everyday life.   Plus, the film is clearly trying to establish its' own feel, characters, and story. Parents will bring their kids, and teens will be old enough to have at least a familiarity with the prequel trilogy. Everyone older than that lived in the heyday of the franchise - and will be drawn to seeing those characters back on screen.  The simple fact is that we have no idea how big it will be. We've never seen a film this big launch, ever. Phantom Menance is the closest analog - and that was 16 years ago, in an age whose numbers don't even register on our current scale. Plus, the December release makes it even harder to predict. The biggest Dec. release ATM is The Hobbit at $84M. It'd be a modest prediction to insist that TFA will double that record."

For 2015, I think most of us would have expected AoU to keep the top spot until SW. Well, that was one heck of surprise on the international front with F7. Now, the domestic top spot will be snatched away by JW. Does ANYONE think SW will have a tough task to overtake JW once JW approaches the 600-650M mark?

Avengers just about did it, but it released in May when the schools were still going, so there was more demand for weekend showings, while some of that demand for JW would have been burned off by seeing it during this week (as it's weekday numbers suggest, it's about $20m more than Avengers monday-thursday total after only barely beating it on the weekend)."
boxoffice,3afa9k,echothree33,5,Fri Jun 19 22:55:28 2015 UTC,"Still a pretty amazing hold/total for a Thursday.  Kind of disappointed it didn't quite make $300M in 7 days, but I guess that's a record the next ""big one"" can shoot for."
boxoffice,3afa9k,JakkuScavenger,3,Fri Jun 19 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"It's still gonna be the fastest movie to $300 million. It took The Avengers 9 days, it missed the 8 days by less than a million."
boxoffice,3afa9k,mrstickball,2,Fri Jun 19 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"Its also gonna slaughter the fastest to $400m mark. By Sunday, it'll need 1-2 days at most to hit the mark, or about 2 days ahead of The Avengers."

boxoffice,3afa9k,Asdyc,3,Fri Jun 19 20:13:27 2015 UTC,Do you think the movie will break a billion dollars or even surpass Avengers Age of Ultron and Furious 7?
boxoffice,3afa9k,Asdyc,10,Fri Jun 19 22:23:14 2015 UTC,"It's guaranteed to break a billion at this point, even if it falls the most it could possibly fall, it will break a billion.  Next question is, how far will it go? It's almost impossible at this point that the movie grosses below $500 million domestic, and foreign is shaping up to be $700 at minimum, so $1,2 billion is pretty much bare minimum the movie can gross.  Maximum though... that's very hard to predict. We will need to see the 2nd week-end drops to have a better idea. It can obviously hit $1,5 billion, maybe even 1,6 if it holds very well. It could go higher than that if it's a phenomenon, but we will know that later."
boxoffice,3afa9k,puppet_up,3,Fri Jun 19 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"Damn, 2015 really is the biggest year for movies."
boxoffice,3afa9k,Asdyc,2,Fri Jun 19 22:34:08 2015 UTC,"What has surprised me the most so far and no doubt is majorly contributing to the success rate of these films is that none of them suck!  Every sequel so far has been ""good"" or ""okay"" at worst which is amazing given the track record of bad and terrible sequels in the past.    Furious 7 was good, Age of Ultron was good, Fury Road was good/great, and Jurassic World was good.  I feel pretty confident that Star Wars will also be good at worst if it's not amazing and that movie, obviously, also has the potential to wreck the box office records once again.    This year will go down in the history books as one of the best and most successful for sure, and we're not even in July yet !"
boxoffice,3afa9k,DeeBased,2,Sat Jun 20 05:48:03 2015 UTC,Yeah good is what I am fine with. It would be great if every movie is a masterpiece but I settle for good.

boxoffice,3afa9k,mrstickball,3,Fri Jun 19 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"Quality doesn't play into early numbers very much. The movie has extreme hype, and many people like it. It's a no-brainer as to why it's doing so well."
boxoffice,3afa9k,Asdyc,2,Sat Jun 20 00:50:57 2015 UTC,3 of the 4 Jurassic Park movies have broken the opening week record when they released. So....
boxoffice,3afa9k,WaterStoryMark,2,Sat Jun 20 02:17:10 2015 UTC,14 years of no Jurassic Park means a lot of hype. Little competition on its opening weekend. Chris Pratt as lead role. Parents who saw the first one as a kid have a lot of nostalgia and took their kids to see Jurrasic World.
boxoffice,3ag4lr,NeilPoonHandler,6,Fri Jun 19 21:33:15 2015 UTC,Inside Out is headed for 25-27M for Friday. Will probably end up north of 80. Maybe more like 85.
boxoffice,3ag4lr,n113,4,Fri Jun 19 22:25:07 2015 UTC,"RTH has given a $31M-35M Friday for JW and a (conservative) $30M-32M for IO, both are gonna be huge this weekend."
boxoffice,3ag4lr,MeteoricHorizons,6,Fri Jun 19 23:26:05 2015 UTC,Good to see the great god himself is acknowledge on reddit as well. Very possible we see two $100m+ films here if the numbers stay on RTH's higher side.  Optimistically:  JW: $35 /  $42 (+20%) / $38 (-10% Father's Day) => $115m.  IO: $34 (I think it can make $30 w/o overnight numbers) / $37 (10% uptick w/o midnights) / $32 (Slightly worse drop than JW) => $103m.
boxoffice,3ag4lr,311excitable1,2,Sat Jun 20 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"IO going crazy on the WC apparently, not sure how it's going to affect JW, but it looks like it might just be a photo finish."

boxoffice,3ag4lr,Gamb1993,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:05:39 2015 UTC,Nope this weekend just set the all time record with two films over $90 million

boxoffice,3ag4lr,thecompletegeek2,3,Sat Jun 20 18:53:28 2015 UTC,:0 I really hope both of those numbers happen for Jurassic World and Inside Out - I really want to see the former break the 2nd weekend record.
boxoffice,3ag4lr,GamingTatertot,2,Fri Jun 19 21:39:32 2015 UTC,I would LOVE if Jurassic World made 103 million along with Inside Out and its 80 million! I'll probably be giving both of them some money this weekend (Jurassic World for the 5th time too haha!)
boxoffice,3ag4lr,mrstickball,2,Fri Jun 19 21:55:42 2015 UTC,Deadline upgraded the estimate from $93-95m to $100-103m.. I'd say its very likely it eeks out that 2nd week record. Could you imagine a $85m and $100m movie the same weekend? Crazy.
boxoffice,3ag4lr,nbenzi,2,Sat Jun 20 02:22:31 2015 UTC,you've seen it 4 times already?? How often do you go to the theatres?
boxoffice,3ag4lr,GamingTatertot,3,Sat Jun 20 04:04:46 2015 UTC,Usually like 1-3 times a month. This is unusual for me. I've never seen a movie more than twice in theaters before Jurassic World.
boxoffice,3aezgt,NeilPoonHandler,16,Fri Jun 19 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"It just had a better Thursday than Monsters University, which went on to open at $82,4 million. Maybe people are being too conservative with that $60-70 million opening? It's pixar after all, with stellar reviews and a great thursday.  Monsters University was indeed a sequel though, so it had that going for it. I don't know, we will see."
boxoffice,3aezgt,Daxtreme,9,Fri Jun 19 17:22:39 2015 UTC,Monsters University wasn't as critically loved as Inside Out so far. I agree that he estimates are a bit low for a Pixar film.
boxoffice,3aezgt,tjfrank94,6,Fri Jun 19 17:50:11 2015 UTC,Plus people are starving for a name brand kids movie as it's been 2 years since their last one
boxoffice,3aezgt,Mybrainmelts,4,Fri Jun 19 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thought! 60M for such a highly appreciated movie combined with the Pixar brand value seems  low. At this point the low end might be closer to 70M, but I really hope it breaks 80M. That would make it two successive weekends where predictions were off ;)  Although MU was a sequel, Inside Out seems to make up the difference with great content. So, it'll be interesting to see the numbers."
boxoffice,3aezgt,best_in_life,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:56:03 2015 UTC,The thing is that was only 8PM showings. Plus every year the Thursday numbers become increasingly more and more front loaded.

boxoffice,3aezgt,MeteoricHorizons,3,Fri Jun 19 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely think this is going to open to $70 million+ now."
boxoffice,3aezgt,Asdyc,3,Fri Jun 19 19:09:19 2015 UTC,Finally an excellent Pixar film. The last four years have been underwhelming quality-wise for Pixar.
boxoffice,3aezgt,tcatron565,0,Fri Jun 19 22:23:47 2015 UTC,Monsters University and Brave were underwhelming for you?
boxoffice,3aezgt,Asdyc,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:46 2015 UTC,It not nearly as good as most other Pixar films.

boxoffice,3ajre3,fracfar,3,Sat Jun 20 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"There are going to be highly anticipated movies coming out each weekend after Jurassic World (Ted 2, then Terminator, then Minions, to name a few) that will consume this movie's market share and audience's interest. One reason that Titanic did so well was because was the only ""event film"" that was out that December, a month when there were (perhaps nowadays, to an extent) less event movies and more Oscar baity movies. Nowadays, the market is extremely saturated with popular movies coming out throughout the year, so now it's just incredibly difficult to keep audience's attention on just one movie every single weekend."
boxoffice,3ajre3,OtakuMecha,3,Sat Jun 20 23:54:33 2015 UTC,If it opened up in December and Star Wars wasn't already there then maybe it could have gotten a lot more. I've come to believe Dec is actually the best month to release a blockbuster movie like Marvel movies or Star Wars because usually there is hardly any competition for months. Both highest grossing films of all time opened in Dec.  But in summer there's tons of competition coming out.

boxoffice,3aeqku,logathion,5,Fri Jun 19 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"The reason Disney is making that push, according to the article, is to get the Chinese audience acquainted to the premise and characters. Also, the fact that Episode VII's trailer seems to have clicked with a decent number of audiences there will be promising; that's 13.2M views on a Chinese video sharing site as of April 17th. Additionally, the article states that Revenge of the Sith grossed 12.1M in 2005 - not a bad take before Chinese box office numbers began to explode.  To be honest, it'll be a big unknown until we get closer to release. The positive is that there's still five months, so some innovative marketing may do the trick. And if we see the cast & crew visiting China for promotions (like The Rock did recently), it will improve the chances.  EDIT: Wasn't completely happy with my own answer, lol.  One last detail from Time:   ""On the Chinese website Douban, the original 1977 Star Wars film received a rating of 8.3 out of 10 and drew more than 35,000 comments.""   I realize that's only 35K, but again... the numbers will only grow in the next 5 months."
boxoffice,3aeqku,best_in_life,3,Fri Jun 19 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes - If you're thinking about it in terms of being a Star Wars film (which in the US is more of a cultural experience than a film now). As just a film though I think it'll do fine, I don't think it will be #1 all time in China, but it won't be doing small time numbers either."
boxoffice,3aeqku,DaveFincher,3,Fri Jun 19 16:51:53 2015 UTC,A little correction - the original trilogy was never theatrically released in China. That doesn't mean it's not widely available for people to watch.
boxoffice,3aeqku,JakkuScavenger,2,Fri Jun 19 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Meh, it's still Star Wars. I'm sure a good amount of people in China know about or have seen the original trilogy."

I'd expect a 33/66 for VII, and it could hit close to a billion overseas. Certainly not a situation as rosy overseas as, say, F7, but the domestic cume is gonna be insane."

This will breeze pass $1.5 billion and will end between $1.7-1.9 billion and has a chance of $2 billion if it holds well in China and other major areas
boxoffice,3ab4t8,ms__marvel,-4,Thu Jun 18 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"Remember, it's 'just' making similar numbers to Avengers. Adjusted for inflation, Avengers is still #1 by about 5-6 million and Avengers has the advantage of people going 2-5 times to see it. Jurassic World isn't as good as Avengers so it won't have that with it.  It will sit somewhere around Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron at the end of its run IMO. China is closing its market soon as well because of the blackout so it might lose a lot of money because of that."
boxoffice,3ab4t8,jburd22,8,Thu Jun 18 20:40:22 2015 UTC,adjusted for inflation it's still doing far better than the first Avengers. At this point it is a fact that this film will pass Age of Ultrons domestic total. Hell by Sunday it could pass Iron Man 3's domestic total.
boxoffice,3ab4t8,ms__marvel,-1,Thu Jun 18 21:40:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah it will earn more than any movie domestically outside of Avatar, Titanic and maybe Avengers.   But as a worldwide total I would guess it won't go further than Avengers. If it does, then it won't do it by much. There are big movies opening pretty much every weekend from now which will dent its numbers in the long run.  Inside out will make close to 100 million, Ted 2 and Magic Mike will make together about 100 million (50 each) as their predecessors did, Terminator will probably make up to 50 million and then we have the two big hitters in Minions and Ant-Man, both of whom might make 100 million each.  There isn't a whole lot of money left for Jurassic World to make if we are being totally realistic but this movie has been a shock to us all so we never actually know."
boxoffice,3ab4t8,RidiculousHat,-6,Thu Jun 18 22:07:55 2015 UTC,"The Chinese market loses the movie soon thanks to the government imposed blackout of foreign films.   Keep in mind that four movies ever have grossed more than 1.5bil - Avatar, Titanic, Avengers, Furious 7. The last two limped over the finish line and were historically high performers in otherwise weak months. Competition in June is much more fierce - there's a decent chance this hits 1.5bil (though I'm predicting closer to 1.4) but the chance of it hitting 1.6+ is really low. If you use Avengers as a benchmark, opening weekend gross was 1/3rd of domestic total - 627 domestic beats avengers by about 4 mil. I don't know if we'll get a billion worldwide thanks to the China issue and the crowded summer marketplace."

boxoffice,3ab4t8,wheelsun131,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"It seems like the author describes both the 'estimates' and the 'actuals' as being really estimates, to me.    This seems like a bad idea and a confusing thing to do, but I think when the authors says    ""actual"" estimates   I think the author is referring to the figures often described by many people as ""actuals"".  estimates:   Fox issued a Sunday estimate of $158.4 million for Sith's first four days.   actuals:   Fox's ""actual"" box-office report for Revenge of the Sith was not far off-base: $158.5 million.   I think the author described the amount that's commonly called ""actuals"" as being estimated because a movie may have been playing in some or all of the 10% of theaters in the US & Canada that didn't release their figures to Rentrak or EDI at the time of the article and the figures for those theaters were still being estimated and included in the amount that's commonly called ""actuals"" as compared to the amount that's commonly called ""estimates"" which estimates the figures for all the theaters that a movie is playing."

boxoffice,3a9pop,AudacityofTrope,3,Thu Jun 18 13:41:44 2015 UTC,Critical reviews are proving largely irrelevant when the audience reception is this positive (not to mention that JW didn't exactly get poor reviews).  Even the Cinemascore reports have such a narrow spectrum of scores (Transformers movies regularly get an A ranging score; most blockbusters do) that they don't really convey an accurate picture of the degree of enthusiasm of positive audience reception among similar profile blockbusters.  The fact that JW has blown away every past non-holiday/opening weekday release so far is evidence that there's a huge disconnect between critical response and the degree of audience enthusiasm here.

We have what is touted as Pixar's new masterpiece, and the sequel to an unexpected R-rated smash hit, and should things stay in line with my predictions (Inside Out $275-285 million, Ted 2 $155-170 million) this should mean that Jurassic Park won't really be able to be as dominant at the BO - perhaps the following weekends will have grosses of $95 million, $40 million and $22 million (the last one if we're lucky)"

boxoffice,3a8ekp,JohnnyRoss,2,Thu Jun 18 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say they're just about right. Given my experience with this, if we're talking about the $90-$110M estimate, I think thats just right, although $110 seems a little high, but I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks even that."
boxoffice,3a8ekp,filmmak,4,Thu Jun 18 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"The hold for a second weekend depends partly on the audience's reaction to the film and partly on how front-loaded the film is.  In terms of audience reaction, Jurassic World is simply not comparable to The Dark Knight. It scores lower than TDK with CinemaScore, Metacritic, IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes. (Your claim that it's getting better WOM than Avengers also doesn't appear to be true.)  The degree to which a film is front-loaded is always open to some guess work, of course. But TDK is 7 years old at this point and films have become more front-loaded in the interim, not less so. The fact that JW's opening weekend was underestimated is, in fact, strong evidence that it's not going to hold well (since that's generally true of films that over-perform on their opening weekend).  The $90 million figure I'm seeing thrown around for its second weekend is consistent with a 57% drop, which is probably right in the middle of the range we should reasonably expect to see JW drop. (I'd peg it as anywhere from 52% to 62%.) It's a pretty reasonable estimate.  Now, weighing against all that, is the remarkable hold the film had on Tuesday. But the most likely explanation for that are families with kids. And that's precisely the audience that Inside Out is going to poach. (You'll note that one of the reasons Avengers managed a 50% hold in its second week was because its competition was Dark Shadows. Inside Out is going to put up more of a fight.)"

boxoffice,3a8ekp,echothree33,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:13:47 2015 UTC,I think it will be just over $100M this weekend.

boxoffice,3a86xo,1337Gandalf,5,Thu Jun 18 05:42:16 2015 UTC,"I'd be really interested to hear why you think so. The movie has been tracking at $60+ million which would put it right in line with Pixar's other top grossing original properties (not quite at Nemo or Incredibles levels, but at Brave, Up, and Wall-E). It has received stellar reviews, and audiences who have seen it say it's great. I see no reason to expect it to do less than $65 million or so, so I'd be interested in your reasoning."
boxoffice,3a86xo,Pripat99,2,Thu Jun 18 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"In no specific order:  The trailer didn't really show anything off at all, it explained the plainly obvious facts (Who could that red guy that's throwing a tantrum possibly be?!) while not showing anything about the outside world, aside from the fact that there is one at all.  I don't think the subject matter will be all that interesting, we've all experienced emotions, we all know what they feel like, and frankly feeling an emotion isn't that interesting, nor is understanding why we feel them, in my opinion at least, and frankly I don't think it'll draw in kids, or adults  The advertising was kind of a clusterfuck, my friend thought it was coming out on DVD, not to theaters, and frankly I don't blame her for that because it wasn't very clear.  Then there are the financial issues:  Jurassic World is eating every other movie currently, and it has all the mindshare.  Minions is coming out in 3 weeks, and it's a prequel to a huge franchise that tons of adults and kids love (I love it, and my 3 year old nephew was fucking obsessed with it). and everyone will talk about that when it's released, and I think it'll make 500-750 million WW in theaters. so it's got massive  competition on both sides of it's release, and 3 weeks tops before it's forgotten about by bigger and more exciting movies.  Edit: Apparently Despicable Me made 543 million WW, and Despicable Me 2 made 970 million WW,  so my revised prediction is 1.25 billion WW."
boxoffice,3a86xo,1337Gandalf,2,Fri Jun 19 09:02:30 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the well thought out response!  As for your concerns about the trailer, I think this is all pretty subjective - personally, I thought the back and forth between the emotions in the parents' heads was pretty hilarious. People thought Jurassic World's trailer was cheesy, and clearly that didn't matter for how it ultimately did. I think for movies like Jurassic World and Inside Out the trailer really hardly matters - you throw on the Jurassic Park or Pixar name and boom, you've got a hit solely because those properties are so well loved. And that's before you take into account that Inside Out has a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score and therefore it can be safely assumed that it is, in fact, a very good movie.  At the end of the day, what I think or you think of the content of a potential film really doesn't matter too much to the overall box office figure - what matters is whether a huge segment of the population will go to the movie or not. From the tracking (every single service out there has been saying 60+ million) it would appear at least that a huge segment will be seeing this. I think that's largely due to a complete dearth of animated films (last one was Home in late March) and the Pixar name always exciting audiences.  I don't know what you mean about the advertising as it has seemed pretty standard to me, but then marketing with animated films has never seemed to need too much genius to get the point across.  Jurassic World will definitely beat Inside Out this weekend, but I think you have to realize that they are catering to two very different audiences. If I have an eight year old and I want to see a movie, which one do you think it will be? If I'm 17 and want to see a movie, which one will it be? The answer there is different for each scenario, and because of Inside Out being a family friendly movie it will do well and not have to compete as directly with Jurassic World.  As to your point about Minions, I would of course agree that it will do huge business and do better than Inside Out - it's a much beloved franchise and the minions definitely resonate in the kiddie zeitgeist. But your post points to the exact reason they aren't a huge threat to Inside Out's box office - they are three weeks away! In the three weeks before it comes out, Inside Out will probably already have done about 2/3 of its overall business and so Minions will be taking away from what will already be diminishing returns at that point. Minions will do better, but Inside Out will have already cemented its place in the Pixar pantheon by that point and so it won't matter.  I'd love to hear what you think a flop for Pixar would look like. If Inside Out draws the expected 60+ million, will it have flopped because it won't have done as well as Minions? I don't think that'd be a fair comparison, but perhaps that's what you mean. If it draws $40 million, I'd agree, that's a flop (by Pixar standards). But what do you think a flop would look like?  Again, thanks for the response. These are the kinds of box office arguments I love!"
boxoffice,3a86xo,Pripat99,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:34:24 2015 UTC,"Pixar is a huge brand, so a  flop for Pixar would be successful for plenty of other movies, I'd say it's a flop if it made less than about 75% of it's budget (breaking even will probably be about 225 million, after factoring in marketting WW) (after it's done with it's theatrical run ofc)."
boxoffice,3a86xo,1337Gandalf,2,Fri Jun 19 11:55:04 2015 UTC,"Well at $225 million it'd be in the company of Wall-E (a great movie, but almost a silent film for the first half and thus very difficult to market) and Ratatouille (again, great, but it's a rat in a kitchen), and I think it's quite likely to outpace those. I'd say if it only makes $225 million domestic that's probably close to a flop. I don't know where we'd get budget costs though to gauge the 75% figure (Mojo is silent on the issue)."

Jurassic World, on the other hand, probably will, and Star Wars Episode VII has a decent shot at snatching the title from JW.

boxoffice,3a76za,Arkeolith,3,Wed Jun 17 23:11:04 2015 UTC,I don't wanna see it take #3. I'd rather wait and see if JW will do it.
boxoffice,3a76za,Pandrez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:40:27 2015 UTC,It'll be close. JW has a very good shot at doing it. Episode VII will almost certainly do it from both of the aforementioned.
boxoffice,3a76za,kayjay734,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:48:52 2015 UTC,It will probably fall short but no worries Jurassic world and star wars 7 will crush it and make it to like the 1.8 billion range each
boxoffice,3a76za,Shruth1,-1,Wed Jun 17 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"JW has more potential for repeat viewings than Furious 7 because it isn't depressing as shit, so I think it'll hit #2 or #3.   I know you can say that Titanic was depressing as shit and it was #1 all-time for a decade but people can avoid viewing those deaths as depressing given very few people could put a name or face to the victims beforehand. It's the whole ""that actor has been in my home"" emotion."

boxoffice,3a67sw,Spectre06,3,Wed Jun 17 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"It's because it's the movie's debut, so it would be dumb to exclude it. It would account for a lot of controversy too since ""with the Thursday's gross, the movie would've broken a record!"" etc."
boxoffice,3a67sw,mealsharedotorg,4,Wed Jun 17 16:17:55 2015 UTC,Yep. Back in the day it was only 12:01am showings so it wasn't misleading. Now you see all kinds of goofy release times rolled into Friday.  I don't know how a 5pm Thursday showing of Spy should count for a Friday number...
boxoffice,3a67sw,KirkUnit,6,Wed Jun 17 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't.  It only does because Hollywood wants these records to be broken, since that's publicity.  Just like the Oscars were thought up to generate more publicity.  I've been following box office results for 19 years, and I've always thought the opening weekend gross is a pointless metric.  You're just measuring hype, the current price of tickets, and the number of theaters showing it.  To me, the exciting things were always movies that drop < 10% week after week, number of weeks in 1st run theaters, opening weekend as a low % of total haul, and of course the grand totals.  Those are the KPIs of a movie that was culturally significant.  Opening weekend is just a measure of how much we were manipulated by ads, or a measure of the size for a built in franchise  base.  I suggest not focusing on opening weekend gross, cause eventually they'll be including Wednesday matinees into it as well.  Ha."
boxoffice,3a67sw,TheSweeney,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"You're just measuring hype, the current price of tickets, and the number of theaters showing it.   Exactly, what's your point? ;-)"
boxoffice,3a67sw,TheSweeney,2,Wed Jun 17 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"It counts towards the weekend gross, although it is a bit misleading. However, it was the movie theater chains that really pushed for the Thursday night showings after the Aurora, CO shooting at the Dark Knight Rises premiere. They wanted to make these things less of an event that could be easily targeted, thus making a few showings on Thursday night instead of a single showing in the middle of the night."
boxoffice,3a67sw,TheSweeney,5,Wed Jun 17 18:12:47 2015 UTC,Do you have sources for this? Just curious?
boxoffice,3a67sw,JakkuScavenger,6,Wed Jun 17 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"I don't offhand, but I do remember reading something about it. I'll look for it and post. However, Thursday night showings really didn't pop up en masse until after this event, so.  I'll post any source once I can find it."
boxoffice,3a67sw,JohnnyRoss,3,Wed Jun 17 18:20:05 2015 UTC,You're right about them being recent as in the last 2-3 years or so! Thank you I appreciate it! I'll look myself too
boxoffice,3a67sw,curiousfanboy,4,Wed Jun 17 18:21:33 2015 UTC,"I remember going to see DKR after the shooting and the theater didn't dim the lights all the way, the staff came into the theater multiple times during the film. It was distracting and frankly an overreaction to an isolated event. Not long after that more and more big movies I wanted to see had Thursday night showings.  It's weird. Thursday night showings make the film release less of an event as there is multiple showings of a film (my local AMC had at least 8 or so showings of Jurassic World this past Thursday), but it also makes it easier, as others have said, for record breaking. Not only are their more showtimes, but all of them are more convenient for everyone than 12:01am times. Students with school the next morning? Check. People who have to work? Check. People who have children? Check."
boxoffice,3a67sw,JakkuScavenger,2,Wed Jun 17 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"It honestly makes more sense. Back in 2005 when Revenge of the Sith came out and broke the opening day record ($50 million back then) on a Thursday, there were reports that a lot of people called in sick to work to see the midnight screening."
boxoffice,3a67sw,curiousfanboy,3,Wed Jun 17 20:29:09 2015 UTC,"It did count towards the weekend gross, and I agree with everybody that it is misleading.  But to be fair, most people who saw it Thursday night probably would have seen it during the opening weekend anyway.  So it opening at 7 or 12 probably wouldn't make a gigantic difference."
boxoffice,3a67sw,tcatron565,2,Wed Jun 17 18:07:45 2015 UTC,No but with JW it probably added between 5-10 million which is the difference between 1st or 2nd place on the all-time OW list.
boxoffice,3a67sw,curiousfanboy,3,Wed Jun 17 19:02:42 2015 UTC,It added $18m. Coincidentally that is the same number that the first Avengers got from midnight showings. Take that as you will.
boxoffice,3a67sw,tcatron565,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:26:30 2015 UTC,I believe that 18 million was for Thursday night and midnight showings.
boxoffice,3a67sw,Mojammer,2,Wed Jun 17 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"The Box Office Mojo article states that Avengers had only midnight showings, bringing in $18.7 million (source). Jurassic World brought in $18.5 million from Thursday night showings, so no midnight showings (source). The article also states Jurassic was playing at 3,220 locations on Thursday night, though the Avengers article doesn't state how many locations it was playing at for its midnight showings."

boxoffice,3a7ido,ShredderZX,6,Wed Jun 17 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"It will really depend on the quality of SW.  Not necessarily critical, but audience-reception.  Needs at least a A- Cinemascore to beat JW, I think.  A lot of JW's business is being driven by repeat viewings and the demand of children.  SW has the more visible brand, but dinosaur enthusiasm extends beyond the JP brand. I don't know if it can match the combined forces of of 6-10 year-olds to begging their parents and impressed audience members going back 2-3 times if the film isn't well-received."
boxoffice,3a7ido,AudacityofTrope,5,Wed Jun 17 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"I think it will ultimately be Star Wars. Star Wars will OBLITERATE The Hobbit's $84.6m December opening weekend record, possibly as much as doubling it, (I'm thinking just about anything in the $150-170m range is possible) though it will come short of JW's $208.8m, and in the first week or two of play will be behind JW, and maybe even a hair behind Ultron too.   It will then proceed to score five consecutive #1 weekends, only dethroned on weekend 6, on its 43rd day of release, by Kung Fu Panda 3. By then, it will have run the tables Avatar-style, stacking up fat stacks of millions every single day, and will have become the top-grossing non-James Cameron film of all time, at least domestically. (And even after KFP3, it will still have a couple months left of play.)  In contrast, JW will soon have to contend with Inside Out, Ted 2, Terminator, Minions, Ant-Man, and Rogue Nation. It will obviously make more than all of them ultimately, but every new major release chips away at it bit by bit, something Star Wars will not have to contend with (unless you're that one person out there who believes that the Dec. 25th release of Point Break will stop SW mania in its infancy).  Tl;dr - Star Wars will be slower out the gate but ultimately win because release date is everything."
boxoffice,3a7ido,Arkeolith,4,Wed Jun 17 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be Star Wars, it feels bigger than Jurassic World. It's a sequel, and features the return of classic characters from the original trilogy.   Jurassic Park was a phenomenon, but not to the level of the Star-Wars original trilogy."
boxoffice,3a7ido,HBKKurt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"Given its December release I don't think The Force Awakens will touch Jurassic World's opening week records.

I think The Force Awakens will edge out Jurassic World in the end, but I'm in no way certain of it at this point. If you had asked me just a week ago I would have said that Star Wars would easily be the higher grossing movie."

boxoffice,3a4og0,best_in_life,7,Wed Jun 17 05:06:57 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying I knew this year was going to break many records (work at a theater), and not many people know the scoop behind individual theaters themselves.  American Sniper released in January (wide released), and our theater, and many others were sold out three hours in advance. We have over twenty screens, and the theaters held at least 300 people (we had about 5 theaters showing AS). It came out to be roughly $100 million, but we were swamped.  50 Shades, although not too big of a hit, had us breathing for air on Valentines day as we sold out every show that night.   Furious 7 shot us out of the park, and did better than AoU in my opinion (more on that later). We had shows roughly every 30 minutes, in about 8ish theaters ranging form 100 seats to 500 seats, and we were sold out 3.5 hours in advance opening night. I knew this was huge, and much bigger than any April film  AoU, was busy, but not as much as you'd think (obviously did better given the final opening weekend numbers). We also had a show roughly every 30 minutes, but only sold out of 2D, and got 1/2 way full on the 3D's, which was a let down. The Mayweather fight killed it, at least for us, we probably had 600 people come to the theater that night, maybe.  Jurassic World was insane, and from what I heard (on vacation), it was a zoo.   Note, JW was estimated to open at $120M, but now holds the record. Others in this sub don't believe that Star Wars will beat JW, but I think it has a very good chance of doing so. Spectre, Hunger Games and SW will prove to be a very VERY busy holiday season in my opinion.   Also, not quite sure Age of Ultron: Mockingjay Part 2 is a film. ;)"
boxoffice,3a4og0,filmmak,2,Wed Jun 17 07:05:05 2015 UTC,"This makes me wonder, if the last six months is anything to go by -- this year could still spring a surprises, eh?   The fact that an AoU underperformed, F7 & JW over-performed -- do you see any of the next few releases (Inside Out, Ted 2, Magic Mike XXL, Genisys) out-performing expectations? Inside Out is 100% on Rotten Tomatoes (I realize that's not a barometer for success at BO, but then the entire Toy Story series averaged just about 100%).  Fixed the error -- typed it up before going to sleep :)"

Ted will be big, bigger than predictions, but not enough to make it ""huge"". I may just have a bias as we get especially busy, but I think it had a decent chance.   Magic Mike XXL may just be another 50SOG, busy at first, but then back to normal.  I do have low expectations for Genisis though. ""Come with me if you want to live!"" Is so cliche and I'm not sure if it has enough edge to go over expectations.  I do think minions will be bigger than $90M opening weekend, but I believe 7/4 is about to break a record for the lowest Friday release in recent history"

I do think the December release date is a totally different beast than June, but Star Wars is Star Wars. The hype has been building for years. But after I looked at Dec 18 releases, Star Wars may not get the record due to lack of screens. It will sell out pretty much through the entire weekend. It may not have over 4200 screens though becuase Hateful 8 and Point Break are also being released. If it had a clear weekend like jurassic, i think it could have hit 225."

Now let's say the Northeast has a similar blizzard to the blizzard that happened when avatar opened, that's at least 30 million dollars of Star Wars:TFA box office.  I would say the lowest Star Wars could go is 120 million(that's if a blizzard hits the east coast), the highest I could see it doing is 220. The most likely result will be between 175-195 million opening weekend"

boxoffice,3a2kyo,Predictor92,5,Tue Jun 16 22:51:33 2015 UTC,"that was Avatar's second weekend, which was buoyed up box office wise by a massive snowstorm that the northeast a week earlier(thus causing it's opening weekend numbers to be down), dropping only 2% from it's opening weekend. The winner that weekend was not something that was opening"
boxoffice,3a2kyo,no_punch_line,-2,Tue Jun 16 23:14:00 2015 UTC,Doesn't change the fact more people went to watch a movie that weekend than ever before
boxoffice,3a2kyo,Predictor92,5,Tue Jun 16 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"except that was not an opening weekend for avatar, that was it's second weekend. They also had perfect weather that weekend around the country(which is very rare for that time of year), Christmas shopping is over, and the family is all together and people aren't traveling. . This is what mrdinosaur meant when he said that files in December open smaller but but hold better, known as having better legs(though I expect Star wars to obliterate the current December record for an opening weekend). I expect the force awakens to take the second and third weekend records, I don't see it taking the opening weekend record  Also adjusted, the Dark Knight opening weekend still takes the biggest Aggregated  weekend ever"
boxoffice,3a2kyo,no_punch_line,-5,Tue Jun 16 23:50:07 2015 UTC,What the fuck are you talking about? You would argue that star wars won't get the record because less people go the movies during the winter. And im telling you more people went to the movies on the weekend of dec. 25-27 2009 than any other weekend in history of movies (til this past weekend)  Source
boxoffice,3a2kyo,Predictor92,5,Tue Jun 16 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"which is the weekend after Christmas, which has a totally different dynamic than the week before, the family is together for many people and shopping is over . BTW, it's not in terms of people, it's in terms of revenue, Dark Knight's opening weekend still wins(use BOM inflation tool, it's on the top right of the screen where it says actuals) Star Wars, the force awakens is being released the weekend before Christmas. Since many people have way more time off between Christmas and New Years, many casual moviegoers will wait till the week between the second and third weekend. You are losing the argument when you put in a weekend that says it disproves that december doesn't have big openings when in fact it's that weekend that proves December is known for having great holds and small openings"

The average Chinese moviegoer is likely to be vaguely aware of Star Wars, possibly having seen the prequels  (and not having particularly deep memories of them). To her Star Wars is basically The Hobbit in Space. Probably a fun evening out, but not counting the days till it comes out.

boxoffice,3a3djv,SethR0gen,8,Tue Jun 16 22:24:30 2015 UTC,Those Terminator numbers aren't as bad as most would expect. Also is fantastic four manages 62m that'd be great. man from uncle is in big trouble as it opens after mission impossible and fantastic four. If you look on google trends there is almost no activity for it online either. Also google trends shows a ton of activity for terminator so who knows how accurate that is as an indicator of success.
boxoffice,3a3djv,pajamalamaobama,5,Tue Jun 16 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"A big thing is that these numbers are as of now for these movies - i.e., there's time for marketing to really do its job. The numbers can sway either way, but a last-minute push can boost their power further. If Terminator had trailers in front of Jurassic World, that's a good thing for it in this respect, and it'll be slapped on Ted 2. That could bring it up into the $50m range, maybe even higher if there's demand for action on July 4 (as there's nothing from here until Gynysys on the release calendar in that genre).   I'd see everything else seeing at least slight rises using that logic - Despicable Me 2 did $143m over five days in 2013 two weeks after a Pixar, so I can see Minions easily doing $105-110m in three with three weeks after a Pixar. Paper Towns can benefit from a Fault in our Stars boost and marketing in front of Magic Mike and Trainwreck. I can't see Fantastic 4 going any higher than $62m, but if the marketing remains consistent, stranger things have happened. U.N.C.L.E. is going to lose to Straight Outta Compton, but WB marketing can probably rescue it from being a total bomb. It's a shame, it looks good, but it's a $75m actioner up against $150m actioners."
boxoffice,3a3djv,HobbieK,2,Wed Jun 17 03:18:49 2015 UTC,Yikes. Man From Uncle cost only $75 Mil to make but it'll still bomb.

boxoffice,3a27qp,mealsharedotorg,4,Tue Jun 16 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think you could look at Jurassic World's Saturday numbers as being closed to what it'd be like, unless you assumed 100% of maintees sold out. If the maintees sold out, you'd probably gain another 20-30% of sales (probably what you see from something like HP:DH2 was like).   So in a theoretical ""Max"" you'd be looking at maybe $80-85m in a day without midnights. Midnights could theoretically add, as in the case of HP:DH2 another $40m.  So the absolute max for a single ""day"" would be about $120m, but it'd be close to impossible to hit that. I don't even think the logistics are there to make it happen."
boxoffice,3a27qp,mrstickball,5,Tue Jun 16 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"so with a standard release, a film can't reach 300 mil in one weekend. So people saying the force awakens will make 300 mil on opening weekend are just pulling a number out of their ass."
boxoffice,3a27qp,jburd22,4,Tue Jun 16 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"Of course they are.  They are assuming a number based on a pre-conceived notion that every person that wants to see it will see it within 3 days of it opening. As much as we'd love to think that it would happen, it absolutely won't.   Not everyone wants to deal with 2+ hour waits to see a movie on opening day. For others, real life has to be in front of  the logistics of seeing a movie. Others may not have the money to do it within the first 3 days of opening, and finally, movie theaters may simply not be able to support it from a human resource standpoint.  This is also why movies have legs and sell over a period of time, rather than a very short span. Alternatively, movies that market to a very specific subset do cater to very specific crowds and have huge openings, following by massive drops. Movies generally don't have both, other than The Dark Knight and The Avengers (#1, not #2).   Now, I think Star Wars VII is about the best, most extravagant test case for a movie we're going to see in a very long time in terms of measurable hype. It will be insanely interesting to see how it sells over the first 3 weeks, since we have no idea how good it is, and how many fans truly want to see it. For all we know, it could see three consecutive $100m weekends, or better.  Edit: I think the closest thing we've ever seen to the kind of saturation they hope for is either going to be something like what Jurassic Park: TLW had (due to admissions vs. theaters available), or Furious 7 in China over its first 6 days (which made about $200m in 8 days which is about the equivalent of a movie making $400m in 6 days here)."
boxoffice,3a27qp,mrstickball,2,Wed Jun 17 00:52:19 2015 UTC,"The people making these predictions don't understand that there's a whole world outside of their hype bubble. Tons and tons of people will be willing to wait until after Christmas to see it. The week between Christmas and New Year's is going to be HUGE for Star Wars. People will be out of work/school and finished with all the bullshit that goes along with the holidays. Opening weekend is going to break The Hobbit's record, no doubt, but not by over 250% (what it would need in order to beat JW). That is extremely unlikely.  December releases have a lot working against them: A lot of people can't spare 2-3 hours during the two busiest weekends of the year; People have shopping to do, cards to send out; People get sick that time of year, or have to travel; Weather can be a factor; Money is tight."

Ehh. Not quite true. The difference is that sales are far more evenly distributed between the weekends and weekdays for that 2-week period from just prior to Christmas through New Years.  Source: http://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/?view=month&yr=2014&filter=dec&p=.htm  If you look at daily sales from about the 17th through Jan 2nd or 3rd, they are extremely high on any given day. Typically, movies gross a total of about $8-15m per weekday among all movies (assuming there isn't a Jurassic World type situation with a movie doing >$20m weekdays). Comparatively, the worst day in the past 3 years during that span of time was about $15m, and many weekdays are hitting $25-30m/daily.   Avatar is a GREAT example of the late December strategy. It managed to have 17 consecutive $10m days (Dec 17th - Jan 3rd)."

boxoffice,3a27qp,i_shot_the_sheriff,2,Tue Jun 16 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"So, a quick search with a non scientific source shows 200-300 avg for a multiplex.  If you consider that the new movie commands the largest screens (given), then you can skew higher, say 275 per theater.  Run time + 5 trailers + Commercials + Cleanup limits to 3 matinees a day, but theaters favor full price over matinee so it might be 2 matinees if that's what it takes to squeeze in another full price showing.  Let's say 5 showings a day."

Universal is rolling around in a giant pool of cash right now - this is easily going to be their best year ever with 50 Shades of Grey, Furious 7, Pitch Perfect 2, and now Jurassic World all being massive hits."

Universal initially estimated that “Jurassic World” would open to $204.6 million, but the adventure film had a stronger than anticipated Sunday.    And there we go."

boxoffice,39x85j,GamingTatertot,24,Mon Jun 15 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"Top 3 all-time world-wide is just about a lock. It only needs a 3x international multiplier to get there, and its not out in Japan yet (which grossed $120m for the original JP - the best foreign take for the franchise)."
boxoffice,39x85j,GamingTatertot,24,Mon Jun 15 15:30:31 2015 UTC,"If it makes it into the top 3, I will probably cry tears of joy. I've been waiting for this movie half my life and to see it be so successful in addition to actually being released finally is just an awesome bonus! I'm incredibly happy right now!"
boxoffice,39x85j,FartingBob,11,Mon Jun 15 15:31:58 2015 UTC,http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/  That's what you'll want to look at. It's already at #134. It has an outisde shot at $1 billion through next weekend (if it held REALLY WELL worldwide).   I'd say there's a 95% chance it beats TA/F7 for the 3rd spot.
boxoffice,39x85j,RogerSmith123456,4,Mon Jun 15 15:34:19 2015 UTC,We'll wait and see. The next few weeks is going to be one hell of a ride for me and for everyone else following this. I can't wait to see the final results!
boxoffice,39x85j,M_mBOT,2,Mon Jun 15 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"Why does Japan still usually get releases later than everywhere? This film opened in every major market on the same weekend, except Japan even though JP was incredibly popular there."
boxoffice,39x85j,Gren0s,2,Tue Jun 16 12:47:42 2015 UTC,"I really don't have a good answer for that, other than that most publishers try to coordinate releases in Japan much like the US so that they don't go up against each other, and have 3-4 weeks of breathing room against large tentpole releases. Japan's theater system and sales patterns are way different than most others, in that they have very slow burns. Maybe that factors into it."

boxoffice,39x85j,FartingBob,19,Mon Jun 15 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with a whole three leading roles under his belt. Dinosaurs pushed this movie, Chris Pratt helped."
boxoffice,39x85j,prepend,11,Mon Jun 15 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe if this was his first hit you could say that, but after guardians, Lego movie, and now this, it's not just a fucking coincidence that he's continually in stuff that doesn't just do well in the box office, but dominates in the box office. Plus, I keep hearing that Chris Pratt is one of the best parts of Jurassic world, just like in guardians and Lego. The guys a fucking movie star."
boxoffice,39x85j,prepend,12,Mon Jun 15 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Chris Pratt was most probably enjoyable human. But the best part were the dinosaurs and finally seeing the park realized. And then the dinosaurs again.
boxoffice,39x85j,prepend,4,Mon Jun 15 17:40:09 2015 UTC,Any rumours on what his deal are with this film? Money upfront or a percentage of gross?  If it's the latter I'm betting he's got a permanent grin on his face right now.
boxoffice,39x85j,fracfar,5,Mon Jun 15 18:17:52 2015 UTC,I think he's still too early in his career to be making percentage of gross. But he'll probably be able to negotiate that for the sequel.
boxoffice,39x85j,bipolarbearsRAWR,2,Mon Jun 15 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"Yea he might not have made crazy money on this one, but for the sequel, or his next big budget film he's going to make crazy money. GotG2 will probably get net him obscene amounts, even before JW's success he was on for a big payday then."
boxoffice,39x85j,thinkerthought,2,Tue Jun 16 12:50:08 2015 UTC,"I like Chris Pratt, but this is similar to all those Shia LeBeouf comments about how he was awesome because of Transformers and Indy.  GotG/Lego/JW were not ""star movies."" Just like Avatar and Titanic weren't star movies."
boxoffice,39x85j,dmol,2,Tue Jun 16 10:17:29 2015 UTC,"Indy 4 sucked and most people blamed Shia for part of that. And transformers was also a divisive film. Guardians and Lego are almost universally loved. I dunno how the public perceives this film, but with numbers like these, I don't think that matters to the studios."
boxoffice,39x85j,MisterWonka,2,Tue Jun 16 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"Indy4 and transformers made a ton of money. Some idiots said that Shia was now a blockbuster draw because of his high grosses.   I definitely like Chris Pratt, but saying he is a great actor or an audience draw is premature. I think Chris Pratt would agree with me."
boxoffice,39x85j,MeteoricHorizons,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"Well clearly the studio did not see Indy 4 as a success because they didn't move ahead with a sequel. Chris Pratt, however, has sequels lined up for both Lego and guardians, plus he'll probably be in avenger fucking infinity wars! Within the next month he'll probably be cast in another Jurassic film or something else if another studio cuts him a deal. Plus people just generally love the guy. He's this weird combination of good looking and relatable that you just don't get in movie stars these days. He's the Harrison ford of our generation. Shia is and will always be a douchey disney child star that nobody really likes but happens to be good at acting."

boxoffice,39x85j,MeteoricHorizons,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. it's best to see how he does in non franchise or adaptation roles to see how big of a star he is. There's a chance he will be in a sci-fi drama next year, that should be a good indicator"

boxoffice,39x85j,deep639,6,Mon Jun 15 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"""Utterly destroyed"" is a bit dramatic don't you think? It's only slightly edged over Avengers for the OW and it still has its whole run to go."

boxoffice,39x85j,Cynicbats,12,Mon Jun 15 23:01:54 2015 UTC,Is it possible for a $100M+ second weekend?
boxoffice,39x85j,TheJoshider10,17,Mon Jun 15 15:43:42 2015 UTC,"It is, since The Avengers did it. It'll be extremely hard, because having sub-50% drops when you get over (even) a $100m weekend gets less and less likely. But Jurassic World has a good family appeal, and those sorts of movies have better drops."
boxoffice,39x85j,devils0508x,15,Mon Jun 15 15:45:20 2015 UTC,good family appeal   It might have some difficulty with Pixar's Inside Out opening this weekend.

boxoffice,39x85j,Cynicbats,3,Mon Jun 15 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that bad weather will stop people from seeing star Wars. The trailers are showing so much promise and there are so many die hard fans out there dying to feel that star wars nostalgia, which I believe will be produced through Abrams episode 7. My family and friends are already talking about pre-ordering for opening night. It's going to be epic."
boxoffice,39x85j,enterthecircus,6,Mon Jun 15 23:21:22 2015 UTC,"The hype for this movie is unreal. People are pre-ordering tickets, something my family has never done before. I believe."

boxoffice,39x85j,omeletteparty,3,Mon Jun 15 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"The hype is real among people who post on message boards about movies. This doesn't represent the average movie goer, at all.

boxoffice,39x85j,curiousfanboy,4,Mon Jun 15 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"Star Wars is releasing during the worst statistical month for openings... December is not known for openings, as the top one (Hobbit) did only like $85m opening weekend.  What Star Wars is going to do is probably do $135-$150m on its opening weekend, and then do $30m daily / $100m second week / $60-65m third week which is like Avatar."
boxoffice,39x85j,boxofficeking12,3,Mon Jun 15 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"to be fair, Avatar would have made 100+ opening weekend if their wasn't a massive blizzard on the east coast that weekend(though all that did was defer demand to the second and third weekend). But you are 100% right believing that Star Wars won't break the opening weekend record, the casual moviegoer will likely be busy with last minute shopping or watching football. Their is also the weather, which is always a factor in December"
boxoffice,39x85j,Shruth1,5,Mon Jun 15 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, I have no doubt that Avatar could have made more. Even if you look at November and Hunger Games - it proved you could have a huge tentpole even during that month."

boxoffice,39xex7,Prax150,43,Mon Jun 15 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's simply because this was a very difficult film to predict for. No one knew just quite how big the nostalgia factor was going to be, if Chris Pratt and the new slew of character with none of the old characters would bring people in or make them back off, no one knew if the movie was actually going to be good or not, it was a very interesting guessing game. Plus, when you get to tracking and start seeing really high numbers, people probably scale it back since large numbers like this are rare. (Considering there's only one other film in existence to surpass $200 million in one weekend.)"

boxoffice,39xex7,confluencer,14,Tue Jun 16 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they underestimated the nostalgia this franchise has over the general audience. Everyone I know has either seen Jurassic Park or have heard of it, and have planned on watching JW."
boxoffice,39xex7,chrisychris-,10,Mon Jun 15 16:30:33 2015 UTC,"Huge under estimation  of the power of the brand still. Also it's been so long since the last one, it was hard to have any prior base to judge. Man of Steel was a good comp, because it was a refreshing of a nostalgic brand. That's why I was thinking around that #.  Jurassic Park was apparently another level as we see now.   I also think the public reception was way better than anyone anticipated. People love it. Lead to a huge weekend thanks to good WOM."
boxoffice,39xex7,BatmanDavey1986,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I compared it a lot to MOS too, except it seemed to be somewhat better received. Nostalgia movie getting rebooted, June release which is sort of rare for something expected to do over $100M, ensemble cast. I guess the difference was that Superman continued to be in the zeitgeist even when they weren't making movies about them. Jurassic Park's been away for a while."
boxoffice,39xex7,BatmanDavey1986,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:51:55 2015 UTC,MOS isn't as crowd pleasing as this film. I personally enjoyed it but it obviously wasn't nearly as well received as JW.
boxoffice,39xex7,MidnightOcean,7,Tue Jun 16 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen the tracking stats for every major blockbuster this year, and the one notable area where Jurassic World trumps all is the Females Over 25 demographic. Here are few tidbits about why JW beat two other large comps:    Total Awareness for Females Over 25 Score    Jurassic World 97   Avengers 2 93   Furious 7 95      Definite Interest for Females Over 25 Score    Jurassic World 70   Avengers 2 63   Furious 7 63      First Choice for Females Over 25 Score    Jurassic World 35   Avengers 2 33   Furious 7 31    Time and again, we've seen the female market turn out in force for movies like Pitch Perfect 2, 50 Shades of Grey and Magic Mike. I think the interest in Females Over 25 was a key part of why this movie wildly exceeded expectations."
boxoffice,39xex7,249ba36000029bbe9749,4,Tue Jun 16 00:17:47 2015 UTC,"The initial prediction was ~$100M. If you population and ticket inflation adjust the opening weekend of Jurassic Park, it was ~$113. I think it is a fair guess - even if they said, okay, Jurassic World is going to be 50% more popular that the most popular film in the series so far... that only gets them to $150-160M."
boxoffice,39xex7,mfranko88,3,Mon Jun 15 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"Part of it is 3D too. I read that nearly half of ticket sales came from 3D showings, which is a pretty big chunk even these days. Therefore the average ticket price is probably higher for JW than it would be for your normal movie."
boxoffice,39xex7,hamlet9000,2,Mon Jun 15 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"Good point - I wish I had a pro boxofficemojo account (if they even still have that feature...) so I could see the ticket sales numbers on a per film basis. Then we could see what the average ticket price was for that film, rather than just using the overall average for this year to calculate the ticket price inflation."
boxoffice,39xex7,stoicblunder,2,Mon Jun 15 19:54:20 2015 UTC,I too wonder what in the fuck went wrong. I agree being off 10%-20% is fair. But people throwing out numbers that are half of the actual gross? WTF? I thought they did polling and shit. I thought they had numbers from people buying online in advance. How could they not know this was going to blow the doors off?
boxoffice,39xex7,Dorkside,2,Mon Jun 15 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"Everybody needs to keep in mind that hindsight is 20/20 and that it's easy now to say ""Of course JW was going to do bonkers business!"" If you legitimately think that, become a box office analyst. Go play the weekend warrior over at BOM and wreck shit. (Do they even have that game anymore).  There were plenty of reasons why JW would only open to 120-150."
boxoffice,39xex7,stoicblunder,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:38:28 2015 UTC,I don't think a single person expected it to break the all-time OW record... it's still rather unprecedented for a movie's tracking to be off by a full $100 million.
boxoffice,39xex7,ChrisMill,2,Tue Jun 16 14:54:27 2015 UTC,"A common refrain I heard from people is that the trailer didn't look very good, the special effects didn't look very good, and they were anticipating that the film would be terrible.  ... and then they all went and saw it opening weekend any way.  My guess it that the polling picked up the reservations and that caused the model to hedge the box office. What the polling didn't predict was that nostalgia and desire would drive everyone to the movie theater despite their reservations.  But that's just a guess."
boxoffice,39xex7,Pripat99,5,Tue Jun 16 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"I have been following the box office since the late 90s, and I have no clue what they were thinking with this tracking. It had to be a groupthink situation. Someone said 100m or less and then it just got repeated over and over again until every just accepted it as fact. Data analysis is particularly prone to this because most people don't understand the underlying principles of predicting demand. Here are just some things to chew on.   1.) Furious 7 and Ultron had no trouble blasting past 100 million. Ultron almost hit 200 million. Both franchises are less universally loved than Jurassic Park. They also were not four quadrant movies. Jurassic World was.  2.) Guardians of the Galaxy opened to 94 million in August of 2014, a totally unproven concept with an unproven male lead. People were arguing that Jurassic World, the heir to the original Jurassic Park, would open to the same amount as Guardian, in June no less with absolutely zero competition? Fucking absurd.  3.) Wrong Comps. People kept comparing JW to Man of Steel. Nope. What is the connection? They are both a movie series? The last Superman movie before MoS was 7 years before. The last JP movie was 14 years ago with the original being only 22 years ago. Superman started in the 70s.  There are more but I am too lazy to write them."
boxoffice,39xex7,Pripat99,6,Mon Jun 15 19:31:27 2015 UTC,Both franchises are less universally loved than Jurassic Park.    I'm not sure if I completely agree with that. Marvel and Fast and Furious both have massive global fan bases.
boxoffice,39xex7,satellite_uplink,8,Mon Jun 15 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"I seconded guessed myself on that statement, but it think it is true. My mom would see Jurassic world, she wouldn't see furious 7 or Ultron, ever. Furious and Ultron hit the under 30 demo super hard, but fall rapidly off for older demos. Jurassic hits kids, teens, young adults, and older adults. It may not have as deep a reach in the younger demos but it has a much wider breadth than furious or avengers, IMO."

boxoffice,39xor4,mrdinosaur,16,Mon Jun 15 17:22:28 2015 UTC,I agree with #4. People really underestimate how big Avatar was. Star Wars won't get even close to it

Jurassic World could have strong legs after it's insane opening weekend and still come a billion dollars short of Avatar.  And people shouldn't take that as me denying Jurassic World is a big hit. I think the movie has a legit shot at $1.5-$1.6 billion which would make it the third biggest movie of all-time and still a billion dollars short of the top spot.  That's how crazy huge Avatar was."
boxoffice,39xor4,Dorkside,2,Mon Jun 15 19:48:50 2015 UTC,I think people lack an overall understanding of the box office. They don't seem to realise just how front loaded a lot of movies are.

More importantly, vote with what you have.  If you think something does not contribute to /r/BoxOffice, feel free to downvote them accordingly. This those not mean downvote a user who goes against your favorite movie. The subreddit should run on what the userbase wants to see so if you see something that promotes discussion, shows a certain perspective even if it's one you don't agree, or tells the news of box office, then upvote it and if other users see the same idea as you, they'll follow your path."

If people love discussing  their opinions on certain movies, they're in the wrong sub-reddit.   EDIT: I'm not sure about that last bit of #1, though. An important aspect of the discussion is the target audience, and I think allowing people to chime in with a bit of their personal experience in addition to the numbers is OK -- would like to know if that's allowed on the sub (I'm new here myself)."

But is there a reason that this sub goes off of revenue totals rather than tickets sold, or adjusting for inflation, or any other fixed metric?  I know comparisons are always going to be off over time but going with the unadjusted dollar figure seems to be just a reason to needlessly hype every movie that comes out."
boxoffice,39xor4,DerbyTho,4,Mon Jun 15 17:54:36 2015 UTC,I believe the reference is to this post.
boxoffice,39xor4,DaveFincher,4,Mon Jun 15 18:07:51 2015 UTC,I know this thread touched up upon it.
boxoffice,39xor4,DerbyTho,4,Mon Jun 15 18:28:36 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion but I think if you go by most other measures, certain existing movies (Avatar, Gone With The Wind, etc) would be uncatchable in certain categories and that would make it a pretty boring ""race"" to discuss because no one would ever replace the #1 movie.  Some will argue that Avatar is uncatchable anyway in total domestic unadjusted box office, but I remember everyone saying that about Titanic, so Avatar is bound to be caught eventually, if only because of rising ticket prices and premium ticket prices."
boxoffice,39xor4,gladvillain,3,Mon Jun 15 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"Right, makes sense. I guess it still makes Avatar very impressive to me that it's 14th in adjusted revenue. I understand why ""this movie could make the top 50!"" doesn't exactly scream fun."
boxoffice,39xor4,Cynicbats,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:09:41 2015 UTC,It's not 14th. It's 2nd - you're reading the domestic chart.   It's even more impressive when you account for the fact that GwtW was in theatres for a total of 10 years when you take all re-releases into account.   Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_films_adjusted_for_inflation
boxoffice,39xor4,gladvillain,2,Tue Jun 16 08:32:12 2015 UTC,"You bring up a fantastic point, and one that is worthy of its own post I'd say.  We do box office in a very American-style, which is reporting unadjusted box office ticket sales. This encourages, as you said, an endless increase in hype because it always appears as though the market is growing, even though ticket prices/inflation/etc are affecting it more than attendance. In fact, attendance has been steadily dropping; not as bad as the initial drops in the...late 90s? early 2000s? I can't remember.  Some Asian countries - I believe Korea and Japan - report attendance, which is more useful to actually figure out how popular a given movie is.  But I guess that's the game for box office numbers, and I think it means that the intra-year trends are sometimes more interesting than the over-time trends. Comparing any movie to something like Gone With the Wind is kind of pointless because society has changed so much since then that you're not really measuring the same thing.  So long story short, the reason why it's off revenue is that it's sort of tradition and set the 'rules' for the 'game.'"
boxoffice,39xor4,ineverwanted,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:05:08 2015 UTC,Good summary
boxoffice,39xor4,DaveFincher,2,Tue Jun 16 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"Is there something inherently bad about reporting anecdotal evidence about a movie's performance that seems to be anomalous? I went to the movies twice this weekend (JW and MM:FR) and I can't remember the last time I saw packed out theaters with so many sold out showings. If lots of people are reporting the same thing we can kind of see a trend and it, in my opinion, is lending to the discussion of our observations on the performance of the movie. Anyway, I've only been here a few weeks so maybe I just don't know the spirit of the sub, but that's how I see it."
boxoffice,39xor4,DaveFincher,2,Mon Jun 15 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking...of course, it's a small scale and lot of us are arm chair box office enthusiasts, but it's not every day that a movie is nearly sold out every showing on opening day. A trend is a trend."
boxoffice,39xor4,officemonkey33,2,Mon Jun 15 19:41:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is our sample size is way too small and scattered to mean much in terms of prediction or analysis. In my town, there are 3 AMC theatres. Two of them get a lot of attendance, but the third for some reason doesn't get much traffic. If I judged Jurassic World's weekend just by my experience at this third theatre, I'd say that it was doing similar to other movies this summer, with barely any lines.  And that's just between theatres in one town. Especially when we don't know the demographics of where the anecdotal stories are coming from (American Sniper, for example, played very differently in San Francisco vs. Omaha) it makes it so they're really just added commentary but not very useful to draw conclusions."
boxoffice,39ygbz,SkeeterNTheMonkeyMan,10,Mon Jun 15 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"There are other factors at play as well though. For example, far more movies are produced in a year now than even twenty years ago. This results in movies playing for much shorter amounts of time. Gone With the Wind was such a box office behemoth because it played for years. Now, the biggest movies play in most theatres for a couple months.  Another big factor is the presence of alternative viewing mediums. It doesn't take long for a movie to become available on demand now, so the need to see it in theatres is greatly lessened. Also, TV has emerged as a viable contender to movies in the last decade.   And despite what everyone on Reddit seems to think, piracy does impact the revenue of a movie, but it didn't before the internet age."
boxoffice,39ygbz,uncheel3,3,Mon Jun 15 20:39:49 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure that piracy is decreasing paying customers far more than population growth is increasing them.
boxoffice,39ygbz,IndyBrodaSolo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:03:24 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind that 3D showing cost more than standard showings so even if you got exact ticket counts there would still be other variables at play.

If you want to do it yourself, it's just ""Box Office earnings""/""CPI in year of release"" You can compare those to see the ""true earnings"" of a a movie. As for other factors, you're right unfortunately and those aren't going to be as easy to compare.  CPI = consumer price index"

He's the lead in the movie that just destroyed the record for opening weekend at the box office. People, actual humans in the world and not just reddit folk, know who Chris Pratt is now. And off the back of Jurassic World, and successful turns in both Guardians of the Galaxy and the Lego Movie, Pratt is proven to be a bankable name. Expect to see much more of him."
boxoffice,39tarm,vecnyj,3,Mon Jun 15 07:17:36 2015 UTC,I'd have to see him carry a not great movie to $100M+ to really believe he's a star (like The Rock with San Andreas).

boxoffice,39tarm,JustAKidFromBrooklyn,41,Sun Jun 14 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"The product placements in this movie were actually pretty tasteful for the most part. Yeah there was some blatant Mercedes product placement in there, and they did make damn sure to show the Triumph logo on Pratt's motorcycle whenever they could, but other than that I liked it a lot. The way they incorporated a lot of the product placement into shops in the park's Main Street was really cool, actually. It made it seem like an actual theme park"
boxoffice,39tarm,xodarkstarox,28,Sun Jun 14 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. This wasn't a painful type of product placement. Instead, it felt like a real organic park. Honestly I think the Mercedes in this was less obtrusive than it was in The Lost World."
boxoffice,39tarm,MaximumAbsorbency,17,Sun Jun 14 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. A lot of people have been complaining about the Beats in the beginning, but it's actually totally realistic that way. There are plenty of people who walk around with Beats like that. Nearly every product that anybody buys has a logo on it, I don't see why that should be different in the movie. I dunno, honestly I enjoyed the product placement in the movie, it didn't obstruct the movie in any way and made it seem like the movie could take place in our world. It would be weirder to me if there were no logos on anything, to be honest"
boxoffice,39tarm,kplo,8,Sun Jun 14 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"Oh thank god, I'm not the only one who thinks like you do! Honestly, there are logos everywhere. There are stores and products everywhere. If there are products and logos in a movie, does that really distract people that much? There are bad cases of product placement in movies (like that Subway nonsense in the Red Dawn remake, good god) but most of the time, it actually helps create a real atmosphere. Theme parks have a bunch of product logos, so it was quite fitting here. They even make a joke about it!   I also tend to notice that people complain about products in modern films, but somehow ignore it in classics such as Back to the Future, ET, and even the original 3 JP movies. I wonder why that is."

Age of Ultron is a good comparison with similar ratings, but Jurrasic World has better word of mouth slightly. So AOU did $392 million debut without china and will end at around $1.4 billion. Made around $80 million est opening 3 days in china so if added to original $392 then that would be $472 Global debut to $1.4 Billion total. Thats a 2.96x multiplier so if you do that to Jurrasic World it brings it to 1.512 billoin worldwide. However China is unpredictable and can sway $80 million either way. So its gonna make $1.433 billion to $1.6 Billion  and well past the $1 Billion mark if it follows around AOU levels (im sure it will do even better based of strong word of mouth, although ted 2, inside out, minions and terminator might hurt business a little)"

Avatar had absolutely absurd staying power that will be incredibly difficult for Jurassic World to come close to matching, especially with the strong competition that will be coming out over the next 2 months.  Though I do think $1.5 billion is in play for Jurassic World which would see it overtake Furious 7 and Age of Ultron as the biggest movie of 2015 (so far)."
boxoffice,39v7oo,Dorkside,19,Mon Jun 15 04:19:48 2015 UTC,Yeah straight up no way this touches Avatar.   ~1.4b seems likely just because so many summer releases are going to crowd the market in the next 9 weeks. Legs won't be as strong - exhibitors will have to drop print counts much faster than Avengers and Furious due to serious studio pressure.
boxoffice,39v7oo,RidiculousHat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:44:22 2015 UTC,Ultron is 74% on RottenTomatoes and JW is 70%- both films were highly anticipated and well received. No June movie has ever hit 1.5 worldwide and 1.7 would make it the third highest grossing film of all time. It could happen but the summer release schedule is so jam packed that I don't see it- competition for screen count is intense and Universal won't be able to keep Jurassic on as many screens if they want a big footprint for Minions.
boxoffice,39v7oo,RidiculousHat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:59:47 2015 UTC,"http://www.cinemascore.com/ <-- Exit polling from people who actually saw the movie. Jurassic and Avengers both had ""A"" ratings, indicating that both will have long legs. With such similar exit polls and Cinemascores, the films will likely have very similar multiples.   JW started higher but had a worse release date as far as future competition goes - and the original Avengers had an A+ as well as an RT score in the 90s. Data indicates that JW and Ultron will perform very similarly."
boxoffice,39v7oo,RidiculousHat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:14:35 2015 UTC,"Let me emphasize that I absolutely expect JW to beat Ultron simply due to its higher 4-quadrant appeal - Ultron's current worldwide is 1.35bil and I expect JW to hit 1.4bil.   That being said, I need more data if I'm going to be swayed by your demographic appeal arguments - CinemaScore and RT are both pretty definitive data points. You can see the impact of these data points on Avengers' 1 gross - drop first week was 50%, then 46%, then 34%. Ultron, by contrast, was 59%, 50%, 44% - much more in line with a film with lower wide appeal and lower critical reviews. But Jurassic World has very similar data and it would be reasonable to expect drops right in the middle - likely 55% or so to ~$100mil this weekend, 48% to $52mil, and then 39% the weekend after that. (These numbers are all domestic as the movie was not day-and-date in every territory - Japan in particular will be huge for Jurassic World).  But look at the titles Ultron competed with - the week after it was Hot Pursuit ($13 mil weekend), which might as well have been literally nothing, and the week after that was Mad Max ($45mil) and Pitch Perfect 2 ($69mil). The combination of those two titles is strong, but Jurassic World has to fight against Inside Out ($70 mil expected), Ted 2 the week after ($50-60 mil expected), and then the Wednesday after is Terminator: Genisys and Magic Mike XXL.   All the big studios will want extra screens for their movies, and 10 screens out there will start running out of room. Universal won't want to budge on JW print counts, Disney will want doubles of Inside Out (2D+3D) and Paramount is going to be a huge pain in the ass negotiating room for Terminator- they always are. The drop for JW this week at 54% will still be the best or second-best second weekend ever and JW will definitely outgross Ultron worldwide, but to hit 1.6-1.7bil would require the stars to align in a way that doesn't seem particularly likely.   Keep in mind that two movies ever have hit 1.6bil - Avatar and Titanic. Furious is going to overtake Avengers over the next few weeks to take the number 3 spot, but that's still going to be around $1.52bil and it was the king of a terrible, empty April. I would love to be wrong here and for JW to continue breaking all kinds of records - but with the China blackout coming as well, the international multiple doesn't quite line up with that 1.6bil number."

boxoffice,39v7oo,roma1092,5,Tue Jun 16 19:11:48 2015 UTC,Not the one who you replied to. But Avatar was the first big (not animated) 3D movie. It was a massive spectacle that everybody thought you should see in the cinema(great word of mouth). And it had little competition after it's 3rd week which meant it had a lot of screen available for quite some time(little competition).

boxoffice,39v7oo,BabaElvis,5,Mon Jun 15 23:22:36 2015 UTC,Avatar was #1 for 7 straight weeks
boxoffice,39v7oo,awesomejim123,7,Mon Jun 15 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"JW is definitely challenging AoU on the domestic front. AoU had close to 60% drop during second weekend, if JW can get anywhere between 55-60% second weekend, we're looking at some insane numbers in the long run.  AoU dropped an average of 27.8% from Monday to Thursday during the first week. IF JW can match that drop rate, we can expect a $63.44M Monday-Thursday figure to go with the $204.6M weekend estimates for a grand total of ~$268.04M. I realize that looks insane, but Avengers did record a $270M first week. Let's assume JW will drop steeper - 30% from Monday-Thursday; it'll still add $52M for a total of ~$256.6M first week. Either of those numbers will mean that JW will have a $20M+ head start over AoU from the first week.  AoU dropped to #3 during third weekend itself due to competition, and I suspect that JW might follow a similar path. Although Inside Out might not take JW out during it's second weekend, there's a Ted 2 (not sure about Max - Warner Bros production) coming out during the third weekend, and Magic Mike XXL & Terminator : Genisys during the fourth weekend.   There is competition, but I think if JW can overtake AoU's domestic total, the movie SHOULD have no problem becoming the highest grosser of the year WW -- until December, of course.   My prediction: $480M domestic, 1.6B WW."
boxoffice,39v7oo,best_in_life,2,Mon Jun 15 03:45:41 2015 UTC,I would think Max would issues with breaking into the top 5 weekend totals. The reason being that there seems to be no real marketing for the movie.
boxoffice,39v7oo,mgmoviegirl,2,Mon Jun 15 06:24:10 2015 UTC,JW is definitely challenging AoU on the domestic front.   Jurassic World is challenging The Avengers on the domestic front. Through Saturday it is tracking ahead of it and deadline is reporting that early Sunday estimates are putting it ahead of The Avengers through Sunday as well.

The reason for this is that its not going to do as well in China as F7 - not close (likely $180-200m). Domestically, its probably headed for $450-500m, which is huge. So probably $500m DOM / $1.1b INTL."

Even with the gigantic OW it has so far managed to be less frontloaded than the Avengers, so that bodes well for its legs. The Avengers had extremely broad appeal, but Jurassic Park is beloved by all ages and demographics. I'd say it hits about 600-650M DOM, with a worldwide total of around 1.6B."

boxoffice,39ua8w,MeteoricHorizons,6,Mon Jun 15 00:25:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the summer specifically, but this time last year, the domestic box office had taken in $4.665 billion. In 2015 so far, the domestic box office totals $4.842 billion."
boxoffice,39ua8w,Bugger217,2,Mon Jun 15 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how anyone could have said that given the success of Pitch Perfect 2, Mad Max: Fury Road, and San Andreas. All three of those blew away expectations in the box office. Sure, maybe Age of Ultron didn't break the records everyone thought it would, but it's still well over $400 million domestically (no movie from 2014 even did that) and $1 billion worldwide. Those are hardly bad numbers. This summer is absolutely kicking ass. The only summer release to really not do as well as expected was Tomorrowland.  We've also still got Inside Out, Ted 2, Minions, and Ant-Man waiting in the wings. Plus a few others that could surprise with Magic Mike XXL, Terminator: Genisys, Fantastic Four, Trainwreck, Vacation, Pixels, and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. I also wouldn't put it past Spy to have strong legs over the summer as well."

boxoffice,39ua8w,Bugger217,17,Sun Jun 14 23:40:43 2015 UTC,"A 30% drop would put its second weekend at $143 million. That's just not going to happen. I think the best comparison at this point is Avengers, considering it's the only other movie to ever open over $200 million. That dropped 50% in its second weekend (and that was with zero competition), and I think that JW will see something similar, if not a little bit more."
boxoffice,39ua8w,brcreeker,2,Mon Jun 15 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're pretty much on the money.  I think that JW will certainly get a media boost, and I think that it will stay #1 for its second week, but I think a 50-60% drop is realistic.  I figure that Inside Out and JW will duke it out for the top spot in JW's third week."
boxoffice,39ua8w,RidiculousHat,2,Mon Jun 15 22:09:28 2015 UTC,"Here's your comp weekend: http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2013&wknd=48&p=.htm  Week 2 title down between 50-60%, still record setting in the 70-80 mil range very similar to Ultron - no movie has ever had a second weekend 3-day higher than 77mil except Avengers 1 @ 103mil. (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/moreweekends.htm?page=2&p=.htm)  Should easily be top 5 grossing 3-day frame YTD. Won't hit the heights of JW weekend (which is current #1 3-day YTD), but should still easily cross 200 mil."
boxoffice,39szkp,MahanaYouUgly,35,Sun Jun 14 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"Fantastic opening, but tbh I wouldn't be surprised if Universal was being conservative just so they don't jump the gun for next weeks marketing. It's too close to call"
boxoffice,39szkp,MeteoricHorizons,14,Sun Jun 14 14:27:48 2015 UTC,Yeah when the numbers are this big estimating the Sunday drop is tricky. Avengers' weekend estimate was $200.3m then Mondays actuals came out 7m higher. We'll see tomorrow how the Sunday drop is for a June monster instead of a may one
boxoffice,39szkp,Mojammer,8,Sun Jun 14 16:33:05 2015 UTC,Exactly. There is really nothing to be gained by projecting to beat Avengers even if they're sure they'll do it. If JW does come out on top then they're golden. If they somehow don't then they avoid having egg on their face.
boxoffice,39szkp,249ba36000029bbe9749,12,Sun Jun 14 18:00:57 2015 UTC,I think Sunday night is a big unknown. You have game 5 in the nba and the season finale for GOT.
boxoffice,39szkp,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Sun Jun 14 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"NBA isn't a pivotal game, I have no idea how GoT will influence Sunday. I can't see anything greater than a 15%-20% drop for Sunday."
boxoffice,39szkp,MeteoricHorizons,12,Sun Jun 14 17:16:42 2015 UTC,"The NBA game is about as pivotal as a game can be. It's game 5 in a best of 7 with the teams tied at two games a piece. The winner of this game takes complete control of the series.   While I don't think it will have a massive impact on the numbers (the demographic that enjoys JP and the NBA had the two previous days and most of Sunday to see the movie), saying it isn't pivotal is simply inaccurate."
boxoffice,39szkp,CoachTTP,4,Sun Jun 14 17:39:20 2015 UTC,19.8 million watched game 4 (up 38% compared to last year) and now that the series is tied at 2-2 this is a pivotal game.   It'll be watched by more people than GOT.

boxoffice,39szkp,mrm3x1can,20,Sun Jun 14 15:46:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe because this is a box office discussion subreddit and it's fun when records are broken? When I'm on this subreddit I try (still working on it)  to leave my personal feelings about the movies' quality outside, and just focus on the social and financial implications of the receipts.   So it doesn't matter what movie it is, when records are broken it's a ton of fun. I was ecstatic about American Snipers performance despite not really enjoying the movie. It's just cool when movies do unexpected things at the box office because it says so much about movie goers and the industry as a whole."

I haven't seen it yet, but I'm told the writing was very off balanced so it doesn't really matter that he doesn't want to come back for that aspect. I also think that no one comes to a Jurassic Park movie for the writing or the acting - you come for the savage dinos. I would just be interested to see where a sequel even goes from here. Can we get a Jurassic Park movie where everything in the park actually works for a change? That would be a different take, though I suspect not nearly as profitable as rampaging dinos!"

A few examples of movies coming in 2016 (not all summer movies)(worldwide)  -Deadpool, februari, not a fan myself, but a pretty popular character.  -Batman Vs. Superman, march, pretty much guaranteed to make a billion.  -Captain America: Civil War, may, with more heroes in it than The Avengers AoU, I think this passes a billion aswell.  -X-men:Apocalypse, may, will probably do pretty good.   -TMNT 2, june, not sure about this one, but it'll probably make good money.  -Warcraft and Uncharted on june 10 could be a good weekend, 2 movies based on games with a pretty large fanbase, although I wonder if non-gamers would be excited for Warcraft. I think an adventure movie like Uncharted will do better, although Warcraft is the bigger name.  -Star Trek 3, july, could make some good money.  -Bourne 5, july, could make good money.  -Suicide Squad, August, great cast, and with spoiler appearing in the movie, it could do even better.  -Gambit, October, not sure about this one.   -Dr. strange, November, Marvel movie with Benedict Cumberbatch and Chiwetel Ejiofor.   Fantastic beasts and where to find them, november, Harry Potter prequel that will probably make good money. Rogue One, december, will make less than Star Wars 7, but probably still a lot.   -Other movies: G.I. Joe 3, Kung Fu Panda 3, Zootopia, Divergent, The Jungle Book, The Huntsman, Angry Birds, Finding Dory, Tarzan, Ice Age 5, Ghostbusters reboot, Assassin's creed.   I might have forgotten some. I think overall we're in for a pretty good summer and year in 2016. I don't think it will be disappointing."

boxoffice,39rm6v,shotterken,3,Sun Jun 14 10:51:02 2015 UTC,"yeah, the first one wasnt as good either,with plotholes and a shitty ending hope they improve in this one. However if the second fails theres a huge loss there as they started making a third one already."
boxoffice,39rm6v,wingzero00,5,Sun Jun 14 10:53:58 2015 UTC,Transformers 5 was moved to 2017.
boxoffice,39rm6v,Thegen68,5,Sun Jun 14 13:36:18 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping Warcraft doesn't just get seen as a video game movie. Having seen the trailer, the movie looks amazing in general.   With Blizzard having started, scraped and restarted with Duncan Jones with it in the works for a decade now. Then having the slot moved from spring to summer, also having the story quality to begin with, things seem very promising."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Hydroshock,2,Sun Jun 14 16:50:17 2015 UTC,Comic book movies were able to drop their reputation as shitty movies so hopefully Warcraft does that for video game adaptations.
boxoffice,39rm6v,REACH_ME_DAT_MILK,2,Mon Jun 15 02:43:19 2015 UTC,"the difference there is what good video game movies have there been?    Super Mario - total shit  Street Fighter - trash Mortal Kombat - decent (only one with Metacritic score over 50) MK2 - trash Lara Croft 1&2 - haven't seen (meta critic 33 & 43) Prince of Persia - decent   and the list goes on ( see it for yourslelf ) of shit/trash  There hasnt been a great video game movie yet  I really feel that too many of the games don't make into very good movies.   Warcraft may change that but its not like its telling all of the story.  As much as I like Legend of Zelda: OOT, i don't think it can be made in a good single movie, there is literally too much good content to cut down to under 3 hours  Same with Mass Effect, to be under 3 hours it take out so much of what made 1 a good game, 2 an EPIC game, 3 a good but with a disappointing ending game  Now Dragon Age 1&2 I could see being made into a good 2 1/2 hour or so movie, but that is the exception to the rule.  But i think the whole comic book movie thing was just over rated (the batman movies did well in the 80's/90's, superman was before that)"

boxoffice,39rm6v,shotterken,2,Sun Jun 14 12:17:44 2015 UTC,"Children are people, and when they want to go see a movie their entire family goes too. That's why mature movies generally make less but are more critically acclaimed. And it has always been that way.  For the record, Deadpool is rated R, the Bourne movies have always been top notch especially since they're reuniting Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon, and Star Trek 3 should be pretty good, I'm confident in Simon Pegg. And that's not to say the rest will be bad"

They seek out Jurassic World and Furious 7 to have fun with friends. That's why they don't gross as much, even though they are better made, blockbusters appeal to tons of people."

boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,-14,Sun Jun 14 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"Uh... this had been a pretty bad year at the Box Office.    Part of the reason Jurassic World is doing so well this weekend is because everything else is failing miserably. A couple of huge (HUGE!) successes aren't going to offset that.   Overall grosses are down from last year, and with July looking like a potential disaster area I wouldn't expect that to change."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Dorkside,8,Sun Jun 14 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're so down on July. I think there are 6 movies out that month which all have a good chance at clearing $100 million domestically: Terminator Genisys, Magic Mike XXL, Minions, Ant-Man, Pixels and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation."
boxoffice,39rm6v,awesomejim123,3,Sun Jun 14 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"I think Minions has a decent chance at clearing $1b alone, it's the only family animated movie since Inside Out and until The Good Dinosaur unless I'm wrong"
boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,-4,Sun Jun 14 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"Because $100 million just isn't the measure of success anymore, not when budgets are $200 million and there are movies making that much opening weekend.   To be fair July 2014 was pretty terrible so it wouldn't be hard to beat that I suppose."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Dorkside,2,Sun Jun 14 20:50:39 2015 UTC,I think some of the movies I mentioned will do considerably more than $100 million. Minions should be closer to $300 million and Rogue Nation likely will be around $200 million.

To be fair I also predicted this with guardians of the galaxy, but that turned out to be an awesome movie, so I will eat my crow.  I just don't see the appeal of a superhero movie where his power is to shrink. I also have doubts about whether Paul Rudd can play enough of a straight man to carry it."
boxoffice,39rm6v,awesomejim123,2,Sun Jun 14 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty confident that Ant-Man will go along the same route as GOTG. Paul Rudd is good, script readings have been great, and the trailers made it look pretty funny- with a superhero like Ant Man you can't really make a serious movie."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Neo6488,2,Sun Jun 14 05:06:22 2015 UTC,19 comedies have been above 250m. I don't see antman joining that list.

boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,0,Sun Jun 14 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"The year is up (so far) because we had an unusual early hit in American Sniper.  The summer season is way down. April was down. May was down. Despite having two of the highest grossing movies of all time, and there's nothing left in the Summer that's tracking anything like Jurassic World.   This is shaping up to be a Summer of misfires and ""qualified"" hits. ""Mad Max did well... for an R rating,"" etc."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Dorkside,7,Sun Jun 14 15:18:52 2015 UTC,Actually I believe every dollar American Sniper earned is counted as part of 2014's haul even if 99% of its box office revenue was from 2015.  That's why Box Office Mojo has American Sniper as the top movie of 2014.
boxoffice,39rm6v,RidiculousHat,5,Sun Jun 14 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"It's complicated. If you look at calendar gross reporting it generally reports the amount of money made during that time frame - Hobbit made 60 mil in January and sniper made almost all of its gross in Jan after the wide release. But if you look at reporting based on film release date, what you said is right - which may account for gross discrepancy per film rather than per month."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yes I thought about it some, outside of total grosses it wouldn't make sense to exclude the numbers. You can't just move its profit from January to another month when looking at smaller time frames."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,2,Sun Jun 14 04:44:32 2015 UTC,Sorry I thought Sniper came out this year.   Looking at their numbers the problem appears to be they don't compare directly. Mojo's monthy totals put 2014 far ahead of 2015 to date. I'm not sure where the discrepancies come in.
boxoffice,39rm6v,RidiculousHat,3,Sun Jun 14 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"You are certainly right that this summer is way more tentpole-y - last year, the filler did business (and this year it's not). Sniper's massive total was crazy and definitely inflates the numbers... but while April and May are both well below 2014 due to a lack of surprising hits (Rio 2 $130 mil domestic? Really?), this year still has a chance because June and July were both pretty bad last year.  To wit, this year June is up 0.5% as of the 12th and has to hit 997 for the month - considering we're at 347 as of Friday and still have another ~108 to gain by the end of the weekend, I think there's a chance to be flat with last year assuming Jurassic's multiple is similar to Ultron's. There'll probably be a 60% drop next week, but that's still another 76 mil and Inside Out should open to approximately the same as all the original Pixar properties - probably around 65ish. (Nemo 70, Up 68, Incredibles 70, Monsters Inc 62). We need to do about 500 mil in two weeks to catch up, and the last two weeks of June have grossed >$500mil for the past 5 years.   July last year was straight dogshit. Look at these titles - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as the tentpole? Lucy as the number two movie of July? Minions will beat both of them combined - DM2 grossed 350, Dawn was 208, and Lucy was 126. Minions should easily hit a solid 350 and the entire month last year grossed ~800mil... Magic Mike will hit at least 100, Terminator should be good for at least 75 (Salvation grossed 125 and July 4th is good for something if Transformers means anything...) and MI:V should bring in some cash.  We don't have a snowball's chance in hell of hitting August - thanks Chris Pratt! - but the summer is not so bleak year-over-year. Wouldn't be surprised if the season is about the same, which means 2015 is still cruising along. It's close - but I think we'll end up coming out on top this year."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,2,Sun Jun 14 05:05:43 2015 UTC,"You make a really good case for July, I just think its big problem is that its weakest release is pretty much all there is for the July 4th holiday. Why was this left so open?"
boxoffice,39rm6v,RidiculousHat,3,Sun Jun 14 05:28:08 2015 UTC,"Because July 4th is Saturday this year! When the 4th itself falls on a Fri or Sat, the weekend drops like a rock. Only a Twilight movie was able to save 2010, and even then it was a huge drop.    Jul 4-6 2014: 132 mil (Transformers 4) Jul 2-4 2010: 188 mil (Twilight Eclipse) Jul 3-5 2009: 162 mil (Transformers 2) Jul 4-6 2008: 160 mil (Hancock)      Jul 5-7 2014: 229 mil (Despicable Me 2) Jul 6-8 2012: 196 mil (Amazing Spiderman 1) Jul 1-3 2011: 202 mil (Transformers 3) Jul 6-8 2007: 174 mil (Transformers 1, also before 3D was a thing - lower avg tix price)   The week as a whole will still do okay, but when the 4th is on a weekend, you lose a day off where people have no plans and go see movies. Not quite the same. However, that means the following weekend - Minions, Gallows, Self/Less - will be enormous."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Mojammer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:39:43 2015 UTC,"This summer is even with 2012, down from 2013, and up from every other summer so far.  With Jurassic World it'll pull ahead of 2012 though probably not 2013.  Here"
boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,2,Sun Jun 14 05:24:32 2015 UTC,"Because June 2014's hit movies haven't come out yet (in terms of the comparison). Unless there's another big surprise this month the season will still be down at the end of June, even if June itself is an improvement (and there's no grantee it will be)."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Mybrainmelts,2,Sun Jun 14 05:16:29 2015 UTC,"what? Jan/Feb/March/April are usually slow months, but there were hits in those months, and the summer is when things kick into gear."
boxoffice,39rm6v,Prologic9,2,Sun Jun 14 05:38:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your point is?   The premise of this post was that 2015's box office is huge and will make next years look bad in comparison. We've have 3 huge hits, but overall less people are going to the movies. So the premise is false.  If you're trying to say ""the summer isn't over yet, maybe it'll change,"" that's a possibility. But we're here to speculate on what will happen, and the numbers don't look great for the rest of the season compared to last year. If July and August do well, then we'll probably have an overall season that matches 2014.   It should be said that 2014 was not a great year at the box office either, as it was already down from 2013. So that's still nothing to brag about."

What is this, ""National Treasure"" 3? Nah, if/when Disney goes this route, it'll be a full reboot set in the 1930s, with Chris in the lead.

boxoffice,39png2,hatramroany,15,Sat Jun 13 19:01:32 2015 UTC,One of the most widely known characters of all time and a co-starring role with one of the biggest names in comedy at the moment? Still not buying his box office ability as a solo star that's not Tony Stark
boxoffice,39png2,seffredts,5,Sat Jun 13 19:14:14 2015 UTC,What? He definitely didn't prove anything with Due Date. It's not hard for a comedy to open to $32mm these days.
boxoffice,39png2,tabbykits,3,Sat Jun 13 22:45:38 2015 UTC,What about The Judge?
boxoffice,39png2,spaceman2121,0,Sun Jun 14 03:11:12 2015 UTC,Does Sherlock Holmes count for RDJ?
boxoffice,39png2,CaptainCallus,13,Mon Jun 15 00:59:29 2015 UTC,I'd add Matt Damon and Mathew McConaughey to that list too.
boxoffice,39png2,GenSec,5,Sat Jun 13 22:07:14 2015 UTC,The Martian looks damn good as well. Can't wait for that to come out.

boxoffice,39png2,spaceman2121,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:50:52 2015 UTC,He did turn a movie like San Andreas nto a box office success
boxoffice,39png2,Char10,115,Mon Jun 15 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe not THE biggest, but certainly top 10 in the world today IMO.  I still think RDJ is more recognizable globally than he is.  I'm jubilant for him though, especially after reading his story of how hard he worked to be where he is now."
boxoffice,39png2,JonFrost,47,Sat Jun 13 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"Ehh, no one I know gave attention to The Judge (RDJ movie). It seems to me RDJ is strictly tied to Iron Man."
boxoffice,39png2,CharlieHarvey,17,Sat Jun 13 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"For those of us who are older, RDJ was pretty well-known way before Iron Man. In fact, I would say that there was some surprise among my friends and I when he suddenly came back from drugged-out-washed-up obscurity with Zodiac and then Iron Man. And I don't mean that in a critical way as I love RDJ, but he was in a bunch of stuff back in the late 80s or early 90s and then he became that celebrity who was famous for always being high as a kite and doing mad things that made the covers of all the tabloids and then he fell off the face of the earth for a decade.  Another actor kind of like Chris Pratt is Tom Hardy. He was in a lot of things and no one paid the least attention to him. I've seen so many films he was in and never noticed or remembered him! And then Batman happened and now you can't get away from him. Thanks to Mad Max (which I thought was an absolutely fantastic film) I hear the name 'Tom Hardy' nearly every day at work now.  Edit: About Tom Hardy - I think he has some kind of shape-shifting ability, because even now that I'm used to seeing him and know who he is, he looks completely different to me in every film he's in. Like, I love both Star Trek: Nemesis and Bronson. I did not realize that he was in either of these films until someone told me. And looking at his face I don't think I would have realized that he was in Mad Max, either, except for the fact that his name is now on my radar. He, again, looks totally different to me."
boxoffice,39png2,IdiotsLantern,11,Sat Jun 13 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"I think the general difference is RDJ and Chris Pratt are ""leading men,"" types, where they are cast as much for their charisma and personalities as for their ability to actually act. Tom Cruise, George Clooney, Matt Damon are Leading Men. It looks like Pratt is probably going to be too.   Tom Hardy is a character actor, which is a different breed. Think like Daniel Day Lewis. Character actors are supposed to be chameleons, indistinguishable from one film to another. Some actors ride the line, like Christian Bale is a character actor who can shift into Leading Man mode and back depending on the project.   Also, I remember ""Mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling,"" as the moment I suddenly started caring about Tom Hardy."
boxoffice,39png2,Griddamus,28,Sun Jun 14 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"Iron Man made me love him, Tropic Thunder and A Scanner Darkly made me believe that the man is an insanely good actor.   I hope he starts doing some more less blockbustery roles again soon."
boxoffice,39png2,iamateenagehandmodel,18,Sat Jun 13 18:47:24 2015 UTC,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is another great film of his.

boxoffice,39png2,EpicureanHorn,3,Sat Jun 13 22:55:09 2015 UTC,Well his contract is almost up with Marvel so he could reasonably be killed off in Avengers Infinity War and have a lot of time to put into other things

boxoffice,39png2,vault101damner,2,Sat Jun 13 23:01:21 2015 UTC,That was a low-ish budget family drama from what I saw. Not really Blockbuster material.
boxoffice,39png2,shotterken,12,Sun Jun 14 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"With the recent numbers of The Lego Movie, Guardians and Jurassic World, I would say he is tier higher than RDJ at the moment."
boxoffice,39png2,LoveOfThreeLemons,7,Sat Jun 13 20:35:26 2015 UTC,What did he do to get cast in these roles? I'm still amazed that some supporting actor in a low-rated network sitcom was given these huge parts in the first place.
boxoffice,39png2,Frozennoodle,19,Sat Jun 13 22:32:06 2015 UTC,He probably auditioned.
boxoffice,39png2,LoveOfThreeLemons,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:17:45 2015 UTC,But there are more famous actors just as charismatic who had reliable box office track records. Did they specifically want a near-unknown? Just seems like his career went from 5 to 100 overnight.
boxoffice,39png2,TERMINALLY_TRILL,19,Sun Jun 14 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"According to James Gunn, he refused to let Chris Pratt read for Star Lord, until he finally gave in because his assistant was really pushing for it.

boxoffice,39png2,rosstimus,11,Sun Jun 14 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, Chris Hemsworth was basically an unknown when he was cast as Thor, Chris Evans wasn't an A-lister at the time he was cast as Cap, and RDJ was a has-been when he was cast as Iron Man. So its not out of the ordinary from Marvel."

There was the tidal wave of Sam Worthington after Avatar, followed by the avalanche of Taylor Kitsch for whatever reason.   Chris Pratt could have very well fallen into the same pratfalls (hehe) but luckily the dude is so fucking likeable."
boxoffice,39png2,Tsegen,5,Sun Jun 14 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"Chris Pratt could have very well fallen into the same pratfalls (hehe) but luckily the dude is so fucking likeable.   Lucky for him he came into the right companies and franchises.   I don't think Kitsch or Worthington failed because they weren't likable, they just didn't have the same luck with franchises. If Avatar was a Marvel property and had another one coming out two years after the first (with perhaps a team-up in-between) Worthington's career might have been a totally different story.  If Kitsch had picked something that wasn't essentially done to death by other works and then run into the ground by an overly nostalgic director and a company far too enamored with him to stop him we might have another name.   But...okay, I admit, they're both pretty bland. I can't recall a single thing Worthington has ever said."
boxoffice,39png2,BenjaminTalam,13,Sun Jun 14 03:37:34 2015 UTC,An original IP starring Pratt would have to be released and those numbers observed to really throw out a statement like that.   I'm not really sure if legitimate stars with big draw exist anymore outside of comedy. We see movies that look good based on the trailers. X being in the cast is just a bonus for the non-tumblr crowd.

boxoffice,39png2,jadamsmash,13,Sat Jun 13 17:41:12 2015 UTC,Brendan Fraser was never in as good a position as Pratt is. He followed up the Mummy with a bunch of horrible movies that made him a joke. He even got a second life in 2008 but was not able to capitalize on it.
boxoffice,39png2,Tsegen,2,Sat Jun 13 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of these comparisons miss because Pratt simply has better machines behind him.  I mean, I don't want to oversell it, because a lot of people didn't have confidence in GotG, but all the other ""hopefuls"" of yesteryear jumped from movie to movie, with a much larger risk than he had."

My nephew is at a young age, the kind of where pop culture is their life basically if even he doesnt know who he is then he's not a star yet. His star is rising, but that's it. My parents also watch a lot of movies and if I mentioned his name they'd look at me like I just asked them to clean the latrine  (little movie quote for you there).

Exactly.This is not specifically related to Pratt but I feel like ""movie star"" is going the way of ""supermodel"", where everyone with a social media account with a few million people apparently count.  I think it's just a result of 'stardom"" being diluted. The reason people like Pratt are considered stars is because they're in major franchises with concepts that are essentially stars in their own rights. But I don't even know if it rubs off on the actors (see: Worthington, Hemsworth bombing and disappointing).  What matters now is the franchise. People like Smith and Cruise haven't had spectacular years outside their franchises."

boxoffice,39qp7y,Ninjaboi333,19,Sat Jun 13 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"Just joined /r/boxoffice and was just about to post something similar when I saw this. My first time doing this sort of prediction so be gentle  June 19 - Inside Out - 50-50.  Universally beloved coming out of Cannes - Probably the strongest kids movie this summer, and with school just about out for everyone at this point this will be what mom and dad bring kids to, especially 4th of July weekend.  No nostalgia factor like Toy Story 3 had hurts its chances  July 1 - Terminator Genisys - Not Likely.  The return of Ah-nuld will draw some, and it seems sequels this year are all the billion dollar movies.  But none of the original movies except Terminator 2 broke 500 million  July 10 - Minions - Likely - If there is anything anyone loved from the Despicable Me franchise, it's the Minions.  Take out everything from the other movies and focus on that. When the second movie made 970 million, I'm pretty sure this will hit a billion.  This is spaced nicely away from Inside Out   July 17 - Ant-Man - Not Likely - I don't think it will do better than Guardians did, and Guardians did about 3/4 of a billion.  July 31 - Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation - 50-50 - MI: Ghost Protocol was just shy of 700 million, but with the trend of profitable super-series this year, I wouldn't be surprised if MI:RN got at least close to the billion dollar mark.   August 7 - Fantastic Four Not Likely - None of the prior FF movies did spectacularly well, August movies in general don't do well. And I don't see the movie being a spectacle.  November 6 - Spectre - Almost Certain - They broke a billion last film, I see no reason why they shouldn't do so again this year   November 20 - Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 - Likely - Harry Potter series jumped about 35% from Part 1 to Part 2 of its finale. A similar jump would put it just over a billion. It's pretty much the only thing opening that weekend before the Thanksgiving break, and the only major market competition is the Good Dinosaur for family viewers, (which is why I don't think the Good Dinosaur will come close)  December 18 - Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Almost Certain - Nostalgia. Holiday season. Nostalgia. Fanboys. Nostalgia. Star Wars. Nostalgia.  Do I really need to explain this one?"
boxoffice,39qp7y,diablo19966,6,Sun Jun 14 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"Star Wars is pretty much guaranteed to break $1 billion, I don't think it will have a problem being the biggest movie of all time. When I saw Episode 1 at the midnight release my local cinema had every seat sold out for all 30 screens, it was incredible the amount of people that were there.  I just think it has everything going for it, a massive fanbase of all the people that grew up with the originals and the younger people who grew up with the prequels. People that loved the prequels want more Star Wars and people who hated the prequels want to see Star Wars redeemed, also, like episode one (the highest grossing star wars film) this one is new."
boxoffice,39qp7y,JakkuScavenger,4,Sun Jun 14 02:20:30 2015 UTC,Are you saying you think Star Wars is gonna hit 3 billion?
boxoffice,39qp7y,JakkuScavenger,2,Sun Jun 14 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"There is a possibility. However small it is, it exists."
boxoffice,39qp7y,HowlMoonstone183,6,Sun Jun 14 15:23:53 2015 UTC,Sure. There's also a possibility that the entourage movie suddenly springs to life and rattles off hundreds of millions per week and breaks 3 billion as well.
boxoffice,39qp7y,diablo19966,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"There are movies that have come close to $3 billion. It's not out of the question. The audience is there. Honestly, Avatar is not as untouchable as people believe it to be. If 9 months ago I had told you that there was a chance Furious 7 would gross $1.5 billion, you probably would have reacted the same way."

I can definitely see it hitting 3 billion.   It's the fanbase and nostalgia that will get it there, I know people who I thought weren't Star Wars fans that saw the prequels 10 times each, the repeat viewings will bump The Force Awakens massively. I'm no Star Wars superfan but I saw each of the prequels multiple times."

And yet, phantom menace was unable to break Jurassic parks opening record."
boxoffice,39qp7y,awesomejim123,2,Sun Jun 21 16:00:16 2015 UTC,I feel like a prequel is always going to underwhelm since the audience already knows where the characters are going to end up.  Force Awakens is uncharted territory.
boxoffice,39qp7y,RidiculousHat,3,Tue Jun 23 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"Rogue Nation seriously depends in the reviews.  If they are close to as positive as they were for Ghost Protocol, good chance at cracking a billion."
boxoffice,39qp7y,awesomejim123,10,Sun Jun 14 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"Two already: Furious 7 and Ultron.  Jurassic World has a nearly identical opening weekend as Ultron and will likely have a stronger multiple. Day-and-date international release was a great move and the average ticket price is super high thanks to IMAX and 3D print count. Comp title is Ultron and should gross extremely similarly worldwide. (3 so far.)  Inside Out is not gonna cut it. Pixar has had exactly one release break 1 bil worldwide. Inside Out has had great word of mouth, but it's a new property and will likely have subject matter too deep for hand-holders to want to see it more than once. Comp title is UP and expected worldwide is ~800mil cume if I had to guess. Release date is well targeted and there's no kids competition until July 10th so the legs will be great through the 4th (think Frozen) but it's just not going to land the same way.  Minions is going to get pretty close and I'm going to call the over - Despicable Me 2 is the comp and that was 970mil on a more crowded weekend the previous year... yes, it was a holiday weekend, but there are only two major kids' releases this year and the 10th has minimal competition. Multiple will be extremely strong and film will be top 3 weekly until the last weekend of July. (4 so far)  MI:5 will not cut it. MI:4 had a similar print count/IMAX footprint and a much better release date. Comp title is Bourne Ultimatum and I would expect ~650mil worldwide cume.  Dramas don't gross, so we can skip until November... Spectre Spectre Spectre!!! Hype is so high after Skyfall, the Sony hack brought notoriety, Christoph Waltz... yeah. Easy 1.1bil cume. (5 so far)  Mockingjay... eh, I think it'll be close but this is definitely not Harry Potter 7B. Much closer to Twilight 4B, which had a worldwide of 829mil... Hunger Games is more accessible worldwide but not quite at the level of HP. I'm going to say 950, which is nothing to sneeze at... but that's still beating Catching Fire (highest grossing HG film) by ~90mil. Gonna be tough.  Star Wars - easy game. Phantom Menace with 16 years of increase in average ticket price. Should hit 1.2bil without breaking a sweat and will likely be the highest grossing film released in 2015... but that gross won't be finished reporting until April. (6 so far!)  Should easily be the biggest year of all time - 2012 had 4 1bil+ titles (Avengers, Skyfall, TDKR, Hobbit 1) and nothing else comes close."
boxoffice,39qp7y,RidiculousHat,2,Sun Jun 14 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"If you've read the books you will know that a lot of crazy stuff is going to be packed into Mockingjay 2, assuming they don't stray too far away from the book it'll be faster paced and more thrilling than mockingjay 1 which still grabbed a strong 870(?)m. Combined with the last in the franchise I think it'll cross a billion.  MI5 is more of a 50/50, it all depends on how well it's received. The trailers make it look really fun.  Star Wars I think has a decent chance at being the highest grossing movie of all time. SW is a crazy popular franchise that hasn't been looked at since 2005 when the international market wasn't nearly what it is today, and with a Dec release date it'll only have shitty January movies to compete with. I'm extremely confident in JJ Abrams, he hasn't made a single bad movie or TV episode in my opinion, and SW suits his directing style perfectly."
boxoffice,39qp7y,ms__marvel,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"For Mockingjay B to cross a billion, it would need to gross 250 mil more than Mockingjay A and 140 mil more than catching fire, which is by far the highest grossing HG film. Only one book series film has broken a bil worldwide and that's HP7B - I would not expect more than 950 on Mockingjay B. It would need serious legs and the multiple is just totally cannibalized by the holidays once Christmas comes around - plus the first weekend of December is always a huge drop that really keeps Thanksgiving movies from throwing second and third week huge grosses. Note that HP7B was July.   MIV would have to gross over 300 mil extra from Ghost Protocol to hit a bil... And that's the highest grossing MI film. I just don't think it's in the cards for this film to jump that much. Plus, the last weekend in July/first weekend of August is generally a weaker time frame - Guardians is the best movie from that weekend and the worldwide cume was 774. August dies too quickly.   Star Wars will gross a lot but highest of all time is 2.77 bil. It would need some really, really incredible legs - not saying it's not possible, but to beat Avatar you need the lifetime worldwide gross of Avengers 1 combined with the lifetime worldwide gross of Frozen. It is a huge ridiculous number that Avatar achieved by being a cultural phenomenon."
boxoffice,39qp7y,uncheel3,2,Sun Jun 14 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"That's true, I didn't take the timeframe into account for Mockingjay, nor the competition with Spectre. I still think it'll be the highest grossing movie of the franchise though.   Avatar achieved by being a cultural phenomenon   That's exactly what Star Wars is"
boxoffice,39qp7y,trapper2530,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"Star Wars is an established franchise, albeit a far-reaching one - but Avatar appealed to all four quadrants and caught demos that were far outside the typical market for a sci-fi film by being the first cinematic experience of its kind. Star Wars does not cast a net anywhere near as wide, and I would expect the demographic appeal to be limited - in particular, I don't think the female pull will be quite where it needs to be.  And really, 2.77 bil is ABSURD. We are talking:   Worldwide of Avengers 1 and Avengers 2 COMBINED The Indiana Jones franchise... plus 800 million dollars The domestic gross of all 8 Harry Potter films... plus 400 million dollars"
boxoffice,39qp7y,The-Broseph,7,Mon Jun 15 01:22:28 2015 UTC,I believe in Rogue Nation!

boxoffice,39qp7y,jhawk1117,3,Sat Jun 13 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"I think either Spectre or Mockingjay Part 2 will hit a billion and Minions may fall just short. With Jurassic World and Star Wars being near locks, 2015 would break the record for most films over a billion."
boxoffice,39qp7y,prof_talc,3,Sat Jun 13 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"Conclusion movies tend to do good. Look at Harry Potter. Mockingjay will get it. Bond will get it. I feel like minions will get it too. That would put my prediction at 7. Avengers, JW, F7, MJ2, bond, star wars, and minions."

boxoffice,39qp7y,jhawk1117,3,Sun Jun 14 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"To me it looks like 5 or 6. Jurassic world is practically sealed already, AoU and F7 have already passed and we have three other major candidates: Star Wars TFA, Spectre and Mockingjay part 2. I don't think minions will pull 1 billion and I'm on the fence about Mockingjay, but the other 2 are almost givens: spectre will bring a popular arc of the bond stories and Star Wars is a franchise reboot. Such reboots (the hobbit 1, phantom menace, etc) tend to make a lot of money off the bat, and Star Wars is so god damn bankable that $1 billion is basically guaranteed. Either spectre or hg will probably make a billion, but three big films all competing at once would suggest that not all three will manage it"
boxoffice,39qp7y,stumblingaxis,3,Sat Jun 13 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"Furious 7, Age of Ultron, Jurassic World so far... I'd love to see Force Awakens cross a billion (it most likely will), if Inside Out is as good as early reviews are saying, word of mouth could hopefully carry it close if not over the billion mark. Doubt Good Dinosaur will make it, Minions could also crack a billion since the appeal for them is massive. Spectre could follow in Skyfall's footsteps as well... Very excited to see this year play out."
boxoffice,39qp7y,JakkuScavenger,2,Sat Jun 13 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"Well there's already 2 with AOU and FF7. JW is basically a lock at this point. Word of mouth will determine the outcome of Inside Out, I see no less than 650 million though. Minions will most likely break following despicable me 2 almost breaking it.  Spectre, I don't see how it doesn't out do its predecessor. MJ2 will get the Bonus of being the last Hunger Games movie, at least for a while, so I see big things. And Star Wars is Star Wars, it's basically guaranteed. So at minimum I say 5. At most I see 8"
boxoffice,39qp7y,stumblingaxis,2,Sun Jun 14 01:34:00 2015 UTC,"I think TFA should end up #3 all-time in reasonably short order. If it ends up being a good enough movie to make repeat buyers out of folks who weren't already big Star Wars fans, I think it can make a run at Titanic."

boxoffice,39plu8,NeilPoonHandler,12,Sat Jun 13 15:27:17 2015 UTC,Crazy. I predicted it would beat expectations but it has going to beat that by a big number.  In seeing reports theaters are selling out in a major way and many theaters are cancelling shows to add new JW showings.  The Friday numbers are great but if a movie is going to beat A1's opening weekend it will need strong word of mouth and honestly the word of mouth on JW is incredibly strong.  The weather is hot (People go see movies). Word of mouth is escalating. It has an extremely diverse demographic pull. It is in a perfect window where all schools are out and kids are just a week or two into summer break.   I am now fully expecting this to beat A1.

boxoffice,39plu8,Dorkside,3,Tue Jun 23 19:51:57 2015 UTC,"They've been constantly revising them since the Thursday night number, or even when there was an inkling of it. From $110 to $130, to $150, to $160-170, to now $190-200. There've been no less than 5 revisions from even the same site."
boxoffice,39plu8,JakkuScavenger,6,Sat Jun 13 17:46:48 2015 UTC,Now BoxOffice.com is estimating a $210 million opening weekend.
boxoffice,39plu8,bluecamel2015,5,Sat Jun 13 17:52:00 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked if this got remotely close to The Avengers. Guess we'll have to see!

It might not beat its record, but at this point it's not out of the question. We might have to wait until Monday to be sure, because Universal is likely to project a modest Sunday if it looks like Jurassic World is close to beating the record."
boxoffice,39plu8,JakkuScavenger,3,Sat Jun 13 18:03:29 2015 UTC,"For whatever its worth, JW is trending to surpass AoU/TA on its first weekend (if you assume the Thursday previews/China)."
boxoffice,39plu8,hamlet9000,3,Sat Jun 13 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"because Universal is likely to project a modest Sunday if it looks like Jurassic World is close to beating the record.   This. A lot of people don't know that Sunday numbers are estimated and can vary widely.   If it is close to beating A1 Universal will play it safe. It is better to wait till Monday/Tuesday and find out for sure it beat it and have the headline in be ""Jurassic World Beats Avengers"" than having the headline revised down OR having that headline come out on Sunday.   If JW beats A1 the headline coming out during the week has a greater effect than it would coming out Sunday afternoon."
boxoffice,39plu8,JakkuScavenger,0,Sat Jun 13 18:42:53 2015 UTC,It's already made more money in its first day than The Avengers.   I can't really take first day records seriously any more. They just keep adding more and more shows to Thursday and then claiming that Thursday is really Friday. I'm guessing that within 3 years we'll have Wednesday midnight previews that are being counted towards Friday's total.
boxoffice,39plu8,hamlet9000,0,Sat Jun 13 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Thursday previews accounted for $18m, that's the same as The Avengers midnight screenings."
boxoffice,39plu8,JakkuScavenger,0,Sun Jun 14 07:16:15 2015 UTC,"Yes. While receiving an extra 3-4 screenings on each screen in many locations. If it didn't get the extra screenings, Jurassic World doesn't have its fake ""opening day"" record."
boxoffice,39plu8,MeteoricHorizons,0,Sun Jun 14 07:26:16 2015 UTC,"So? There was a story about a theater that played The Avengers on 20 screens at its midnight screenings.

On the way home I wondered if this would translate to a larger opening weekend in the US - maybe around $190m and if maybe it would go on to break $1.5b or even $2b by the end of its run. Then today came, and I read about everyone projecting a $180m+ weekend. Hmmm..."

boxoffice,39plu8,NormalNormalNormal,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"I think that people spontaneously wanted to go see JW, and the pre-sales for it weren't strong. Heck, even the Thursday midnight previews weren't crazy, or indicative of this kind of weekend. Age of Ultron did 27.1 million midnight for a $190m weekend... And JW is looking at $18.6m for a $200m+ weekend. That kind of jump is pretty much unheard of. I put out a lot of numbers on Friday when the midnight sales were put out. AoU had a 7 to 1 boost from midnights to weekend. Furious 7 was at a whopping 10 to 1. Pitch Perfect was a 15 to 1, and JW is looking at about a 11 to 1.. Which again, is unfathomable (Harry Potter DH2 was a 4:1 for reference)"

boxoffice,39qx8n,3000milestoSpacejam,6,Sat Jun 13 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"Anecdotally, I know a lot of people are waiting on WoM+reviews on this one. These days, you can't just expect everyone to turn out for every superhero movie just because, but FF seems to have a likable cast and has familiar characters.  I guess what we're seeing with San Andreas could be similar to what happens with FF, so I would say over regardless as even with mediocre reviews SA is putting its way to $120m. With some good reviews I think the $150-200m range for FF is pretty likely. It's not like it has a ton of competition in the blockbuster market once August rolls around."
boxoffice,39qx8n,Mermbone,3,Sat Jun 13 22:24:44 2015 UTC,"over definitely. How much over, i have no clue. but $114 million is pretty low for a summer blockbuster especially considering that this a comic book movie. not to mention it wont have much competition other than ant man but ant man will have been 3 weeks old at that point. I can definitely see it getting to $150 mil. It really depends on ant man. If ant man is like GotG then I doubt it will make much but if it does good but nothing out of this world then i can see fantastic four making alot. Also they need to release a good trailer before it comes out. These past 2 have been really lackluster."
boxoffice,39qx8n,hamlet9000,2,Sun Jun 14 12:29:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to under it. I've seen no significant positive reaction to the trailers and the mainstream audience's primary memories of the Fantastic Four are a couple of fairly crappy movies from a decade ago that featured a plot which is seemingly identical to the plot being peddled by the new trailer.  This is easily an ""under"" vote for me. I wasn't anticipating it making even $100 million on opening weekend."
boxoffice,39qx8n,tboiscool,2,Sun Jun 14 07:25:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is an estimate for the overall gross, not the weekend. But, yeah, there's no way it opens to $100 million."
boxoffice,39qx8n,hamlet9000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:59:35 2015 UTC,"Oops. Yeah, I misread that.  Then I have to swap to ""over"". Rise of the Silver Surfer made $137 million 8 years ago. That figure already reflects people's reactions to the first mediocre film, so I have to believe that interest in a reboot will at least be in the same ballpark.  In the last 10 years, only two films based on major DC or Marvel superheroes have performed under $114 million: Punisher and Ghost Rider. Even the complete train wreck of Green Lantern managed to clear $116.  Based on pure gut, I'd peg the FF movie as performing in a similar range to San Andreas."

boxoffice,39qx8n,RidiculousHat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:44:05 2015 UTC,"Over but by a small margin. Comic book movies haven't really grossed a number that low (except Green Lantern, puke) for quite some time - the release date lines up similarly to, say, Captain America 1 (176m) or Wolverine (132m). The movie could be atrocious and go under, but Miles Teller has some goodwill right now and comic book appeal is pretty reliable. The only question mark I have is if Ant-Man introduces comic book fatigue or cannibalizes the gross at all coming out three weeks before."

boxoffice,39q6l2,kingofcrob,21,Mon Jun 15 00:54:23 2015 UTC,Entourage waited too long.  Plus I never felt it was nearly as popular as sex and the city. I have no numbers to back it up though.

boxoffice,39paqb,Anosognosia,6,Sat Jun 13 12:59:29 2015 UTC,How do the Chinese market behave when it comes to weekly drops compared to the US? Do the markets have the same behaviour?
boxoffice,39paqb,mrstickball,7,Sat Jun 13 14:29:41 2015 UTC,"""It depends""  Although I'd say the drops are a bit more steep in general for American blockbusters. Age of Ultron had a 65% drop its second weekend, but it did release on Tuesday (China really isn't a fan of American releases, so they launch/release American movies at goofy intervals).  Alternatively, Furious 7 had 50% drops during its entire run + an insane $60m opening Day on Sunday.. So drops really depend on a variety of factors.  And of course, they force American movies to only be permitted on market for 30 days. For many movies, its a moot point, but Age of Ultron earned 1 million RMB (about $150k USD) on its last Thursday, so it still could have made a bit of money. Same with F7- its last weekend there was something like $5m USD. It could have hit $400m without them forcing it into a 30-day license."
boxoffice,39paqb,swellipop,7,Sat Jun 13 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"Marvel should really take the subtitles problem more seriously. AOU received negative word of mouth in China because of subtitiles, otherwise it would have grossed more than 250 million."
boxoffice,39paqb,mrstickball,7,Sat Jun 13 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"I believe that the Chinese government forces all movie companies to go through 2-3 specific subtitle companies, and they are extremely inept/corrupt, so its a roll of the dice if a proper translation/subtitle comes out.  From what I've seen, some studios are in fact taking it more seriously, and trying to figure out solutions for in-house translation/audio dubbing to circumvent the problems. (Kung Fu Panda 3 is one of the first to re-animate every frame for the Chinese language)."
boxoffice,39paqb,Anosognosia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:20:10 2015 UTC,they are extremely inept/corrupt   Not a unique problem to subtitling when it comes to Chinese markets. China is going to have a really big hurdle to jump once the goverments focus on basic infrastructure and industrial job creation starts to slow down. The transistion into consumer/post industrial society is going to get rockier and rockier as time goes by for China if they can't deal the with croniesm.
boxoffice,39paqb,Mojammer,2,Mon Jun 15 01:12:04 2015 UTC,"Before Furious 7 opened I was thinking if it doubled the first Avengers movie it would be fine, but 200+ was the real goal considering Iron Man 3 and Cap2 both did about 115-120m there.  So yeah, 235 is a very good run."
boxoffice,39u059,GoldandBlue,15,Sun Jun 14 19:31:51 2015 UTC,A lot of people loved the first one and (I haven't seen it yet) I assume the idea of this one taking place in a park rather than on Isla Sorna has brought out a lot of nostalgia for the first one in people.  Plus the marketing budget had to have been huge. I've never seen a movie as marketed as this one. It's been around every turn for months.
boxoffice,39u059,OtakuMecha,-9,Sun Jun 14 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"But that still doesnt explain it because as much as people loved the first one, part 2 and 3 did not make anywhere near this much. And 2 still had Spielberg."
boxoffice,39u059,MisterWonka,6,Sun Jun 14 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"The Lost World was an enormous hit. It made like $615 million worldwide, if I recall correctly. The only reason it didn't win the box office for that year is that it was 1997, the year of Titanic.   It also broke records for highest single day total AND highest weekend box office, both of which it held for a few years.   You're underestimating the success of the franchise as a whole. Obviously that doesn't account for everything, but it is a factor."
boxoffice,39u059,OtakuMecha,9,Sun Jun 14 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said, the other two were on Isla Sorna. This one is in a tunning park.

boxoffice,39u059,mrdinosaur,9,Sun Jun 14 21:00:32 2015 UTC,"It's not any of the actors, it's the franchise. It speaks to the power of the original Jurassic Park, which has only gotten more beloved in time despite far inferior sequels. On top of that, the rerelease of Jurassic Park in 3D was quite successful and got people talking about it again.  Also, Universal went really aggressive with the marketing on this one. Pratt riding with velociraptors is pretty iconic, as ridiculous as it might be, and featuring that front and center in the marketing was a bold move that paid off.  And finally, I think the movie just plain connected with people. It was lightweight, easy to enjoy, and loaded with fan service. The third act is thrilling and has people leaving the theatre feeling exhilarated, which encourages recommendations. My bet is that this movie will surprise with its legs as well as its opening due to positive reaction.  I don't think this was a good movie, but it was very very crowd pleasing. That being said, I don't think anyone expected these kinds of numbers."

Or you just personally didn't like the second and third movie? The Lost World had the best opening weekend of '97 and was the third highest grossing of that year.  Jurassic Park is a monstrous franchise that had one speed bump in 2001, which was the last thing that a lot of people remembered about the franchise since it was the most recent. Now that JW went nuclear the franchise is fresh again."

boxoffice,39u059,mrdinosaur,-3,Sun Jun 14 23:45:44 2015 UTC,You thought Low World and Jurassic Park 3 were good? Both have RT scores at around 50% and audience scores near 60 and we all know audiences tend to be more generous.
boxoffice,39u059,SupieGP,5,Mon Jun 15 01:15:59 2015 UTC,Here's the thing: nobody's arguing about the quality of the films here. Box Office performance can be influenced by film quality but not really relevant for discussion except in regards to audience reaction.
boxoffice,39u059,MisterWonka,-2,Mon Jun 15 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"But I am asking about why the movie performed so well and this guy just keeps responding that the movie was great. Mad Max was great and didn't do these numbers, there are stronger franchises that did not do as well. That is why I am asking. For it to exceed projections by so much when there was really nothing to make it stand apart from the summer pack really intrigues me."
boxoffice,39u059,mardfet,2,Mon Jun 15 06:13:59 2015 UTC,"I think their point is that what any one person thinks about the movie is irrelevant. So you may say Mad Max is a stronger franchise and don't know why it didn't do better. Critically, yes, but reviews are only part of the picture. You have to look at a lot of other factors.  Mad Max, first of all, was never a franchise as big as Jurassic Park. The first film barely made it out of Australia. The Road Warrior grossed a modest 23 mill in the U.S. Beyond Thunderdome clocked in the mid 30s. Compared to Jurassic Park, which was an event film when it was released. It shattered box office records and was the highest grossing film until Titanic in 97.  Also Fury Road was R-rated, appealed more to men, and was marketed far less than Jurassic World.  As for why Jurassic World is exceeding expectations so much? Well, you're right in saying that it really isn't anything too far outside of usual summer popcorn fare. But it tapped into nostalgia hard. I think everybody underestimated the good will that the original Jurassic Park has garnered over the years and how much people have allowed themselves to forget the sequels. The cross generational appeal is high, the movie is relatively short compared to many of its peers, and it is by and large a crowd pleaser. There's no mythology to learn, lots of laughs and thrills, and it doesn't hurt that there hasn't been a AAA release in a month.  So yeah, just an unexpected perfect storm."
boxoffice,39u059,sorenji,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:46:51 2015 UTC,"As a Jurassic Park fan, it's because it's Jurassic Park. A great many people that I know didn't want the franchise to die, and especially not with a whimper (JPIII). Many people have been waiting for this movie for 14 years ; some have been waiting for 22 years. There's not many movies that can say that. The draw of the original JP is that it had dinosaurs - the draw of this movie is that it's Jurassic Park. The original was/is seminal movie, a legendary movie. That can't be underestimated."

boxoffice,39u059,HarbhajanSingh_,2,Sun Jun 14 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"I know The Lost World was the book sequel, but it and JP3 seem like spinoffs compared to JW in my opinion. JW really feels like the true successor the first because it's Hammond's vision becoming reality."
boxoffice,39u059,stoicblunder,3,Mon Jun 15 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"People really like the franchise. It's been 12 14 years since the last one came out, after they made 3 movies all in the span of 7 years.   Chris Pratt could be a pretty big draw.

None of my friends and family think any of the movies were shit. Jurassic World is a good film with some gripping moments and breathtaking scenes. Obviously it doesn't match Part 1 but it is still a good movie. And it is not Chris Pratt; it is the Dinosaurs."
boxoffice,39u059,M_mBOT,-1,Mon Jun 15 16:44:38 2015 UTC,"What high horse. Did I say the movie was bad? Did I say the movie should have flopped, you are projecting this weird defense of the movie when I am asking why a movie was able to exceed projections by such a huge amount when there is really nothing that sepreated it from the summer pack. There was no death (Furious 7), there was no franchise domination (Avengers 2), so what was it? And you are basically saying ""fuck you for not loving it"". Is this a discussion of box office performance or a movie circlejerk?"
boxoffice,39u059,Johnwesleya,2,Mon Jun 15 16:48:10 2015 UTC,The franchise has been shit save for the original  But the franchise has been awful (excluding the original of course).    The franchise hasn't been shit. Most people enjoyed the previous movies and were excited for this new film. It came after a really long time and everybody loves dinosaurs. It is a simple explanation why Jurassic World has earned so much -- Dinosaurs + well made family movie
boxoffice,39okbd,NeilPoonHandler,9,Sat Jun 13 06:54:06 2015 UTC,"Never underestimate the enormous box office appeal of Jurassic Park, I guess. After all, the first two Jurassic Park films both had the opening weekend record at one point. Now this film is a serious challenger to dethroning The Avengers' opening weekend record (at least until Star Wars: The Force Awakens).  2015, bitch."
boxoffice,39okbd,Sanlear,7,Sat Jun 13 10:25:17 2015 UTC,It's pretty much critic proof.
boxoffice,39okbd,mrstickball,11,Sat Jun 13 13:37:30 2015 UTC,Deadline has just revised it to $190 - $200m.  W.O.W.  I am totally speechless. That is double what some people predicted. Maybe even into the realm of its 3-day cume hitting what some predicted would be its entire box office run.
boxoffice,39okbd,MarsupialKing,2,Sat Jun 13 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"This movie was a lot bigger than anyone expected it to be.... I work at a theater and we always have a sheet for the expected attendance for the day. Yesterday we were expecting 1,600 between the 6-10pm hours. We cleared 2,500."
boxoffice,39okbd,mrstickball,2,Sat Jun 13 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"Insane. I think such information shows why its beating everyones' expectations by huge numbers. No one was prepared for it being over $130-140m, and we're now talking $200-210m.  Just curious - if you did 2,500 in attendance, how much more could you have theoretically done? I'm kind of surprised that JW could clear what it has."
boxoffice,39okbd,MarsupialKing,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much more people we could have taken to be honest. I know we sold out most shows and had to open a couple more. We could have fit a few hundred more people, it just would have been difficult as we did not have the necessary staff for 2,500 people and it would have been even longer lines. For American sniper we got close to 3,000 though, so we could have held out a little longer haha"

boxoffice,39okbd,5-88-60-8-7,-1,Sat Jun 13 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"Insane. I've been on the fence about seeing this (still might in a month or so), but in trying to decide, I read many of the reviews/feedback (and spoke to some who saw early screeners) for the movie.  Even the good ones kind of describe it as more of a dumb popcorn spectacle full of plot holes and other stupidity (so much that the movie is even self-aware of this) but some kind of fun if you just go with it.  Since Wednesday, all kinds of people that don't go to the movies much have been asking me about it as well. When I basically echo what I've read/heard and the dumber scenes/plot points, the reaction from just about everyone is, ""Wow! That sounds so stupid! I wasn't going to see this, but I'm definitely going to now!"" Go figure...  Is there such a thing as ""bad word of mouth"" actually working to get more people to see a movie? Like ""It's so stupid/unintentionally funny that it's cool, and I just have to see it with everyone else!""???  I can easily see this doing $190m+... Critic proof indeed, but I'm not sure what that says for quality cinema and what lies ahead (except we already have dinosaur sequels penciled in for 2023).   TL;DR Even negative word of mouth has been motivating everyone I've spoken with to want to go see the movie. I'm not sure what that says about all of us, but yeah, it's making a boatload of money."
boxoffice,39okbd,mrstickball,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"I think the issue about the negative context is that its simply an effective (extremely effective) popcorn movie. Its easy to look at, and judge those kinds of movies, but it seems that people really, really wanted one that wasn't another Marvel cookie-cutter."
boxoffice,39okbd,electricblues42,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"Critic proof indeed   I came here from another part of reddit, not exactly as knowledgeable on these things as most of you are. But I just wanted to say this, over the past years I and most everyone I talk to has come to not trust movie critics. I personally haven't seen one I trust to have good judgement since Ebert. If the reviews are at 50% or over I consider it a possibly good movie. Too many critics have the same mentality ""if it isn't as good as [insert black and white classic] then it's trash"", and that is really not that useful. A movie should be judged by what it is, not in comparison to your own personal tastes.  Though the people saying it's ""good, not great"" are correct. I liked it but it's still a dumb summer blockbuster. Actually I'll probably see it again, I liked it that much.  TL;DR: Movie critics are less and less trust able as unbiased critics among certain viewers."
boxoffice,39okbd,gatsbylovespools,14,Sun Jun 14 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"Hol-ee Shit.  I figured it would do well, but $177 million is simply insane. Even if it has Jurassic Park III legs from here it makes $400 million, and that's counting a 5-day opening."

boxoffice,39okbd,Mysterian,4,Sat Jun 13 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"I'm happy for Legendary Pictures.  Thomas Tull and his team out there have been working hard to revitalize awesome old franchises like Batman, Superman, and Godzilla, and new ones like Pacific Rim.  They've been giving the source material the respect it deserves and have now done it again here for Jurassic Park.    Other studios and production companies just treat the old franchises like product and let them fizzle out (with rare exceptions such as WB's revival of Mad Max, and of course Disney's marvelous treatment of Marvel.)  What Tull is doing is fan service at the highest level, and as a movie fan, I'm grateful for that.    Glad they a huge new hit to hang their hat on, and to help fund future big budget awesomeness out there."

boxoffice,39okbd,elmatador12,2,Sat Jun 13 11:01:20 2015 UTC,I thought the marketing of this movie as brilliant. Only revealed a little at a time. Had a full on Jurassic world website acting like it was a real theme park with live cams. YouTube videos with the geneticists. Pretty good stuff.
boxoffice,39okbd,DarkLiberator,2,Sat Jun 13 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, latest estimate is 82.9 million, which means it Avenger's OW record is in play. I dunno if it will get there, but 200 million seems assured."

boxoffice,39nsaa,pm_me_ur_pajamas,9,Sat Jun 13 04:13:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people do it.   It's about the group experience, the sense of participating in a film together."

boxoffice,39nsaa,BatmanDavey1986,0,Sat Jun 13 12:30:23 2015 UTC,Honestly I had high expectations and this blew them away. I was extremely happy with all of it.
boxoffice,39nsaa,Bieb,15,Sat Jun 13 08:34:42 2015 UTC,"I know this is purely anecdotal, but at my local movie theater the lines stretched all the way around the multiplex. I'm pretty sure all the times were sold out. I wouldn't be surprised if it scored a $170M+ performance."
boxoffice,39nsaa,MeteoricHorizons,11,Sat Jun 13 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"FWIW, its tracking 15% ahead of The Dark Knight Rises. TDKR hit $160m opening weekend, despite the Aurora shooting, so....  $160m should easily be the floor due to WoM. It could very well hit your $170m which is unfathomable. One big thing is that the runtime is sub-120 minutes, which means more showings for hungry fans."

boxoffice,39nsaa,mrstickball,5,Sat Jun 13 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"Legs will be really, really interesting to me, since I grew up with it in the '90s and would view it more as a ""Kids"" movie in that parents would want to drag their kids to see it, trying to find common ground with them, movie-wise.  If a 50% first-weekend drop was in the cards... The movie could hit upwards of $400m domestically. Which (IMO) would be far beyond anyones' hopes, and one would think that they'd be greenlighting a sequel in a matter of days."
boxoffice,39nsaa,MeteoricHorizons,4,Sat Jun 13 02:47:13 2015 UTC,"It'll depend on the word of the mouth, and so far (at least in my experience) it's been very positive."

Last week, it did $500k, which would suggest that it probably has another $2-3m in the tank domestically.   Overseas, it still looks like its earning $15,000 - $50,000/wk in many territories. So another $4-5m may be possible. It'll be interesting if they can eek out the remaining balance to get it into #3 all time, which is a herculean effort."

boxoffice,39l5tf,stoicblunder,21,Fri Jun 12 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"Edit/Update:  As per Deadline, they are now projecting $70m OD / $155-165m OW. Its also earned $61.4m through the first 2 days internationally, and that doesn't include China bringing in an additional $20m on Friday as per estimates. They have revised the estimates upwards about 3 times thus far today. It won't be close to AoU's $87m OD for top of 2015, but has a good shot at beating Furious 7.  Insanity.   Midnight openings this year:   Age of Ultron - $27.6m ($191.3m OW) Jurassic World - $18.5m  Furious 7 - $15.8m ($147.1m OW) 50 Shades of Grey - $8.6m ($85.3m) Pitch Perfect - $4.6m ($69.2m) San Andreas - $3.1m ($54.6m)   Highest multiplier was about 15.5x (PP2), and lowest was 6.99 (AoU) of those I pulled basic data from.  That would put JW at a bare minimum of $129.5m, unless it does worse than AoU midnights. If it hit F7's multiplier, it'd be at about $172m... Which would be insane."
boxoffice,39l5tf,mrstickball,9,Fri Jun 12 15:07:04 2015 UTC,I wonder why deadline is giving a lower range. They are saying it will make 135 at most. I don't really understand where that limit is coming from. JW will play strong and steady all the way through Sunday night. So it's not dropping off a lot.
boxoffice,39l5tf,Prax150,10,Fri Jun 12 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"Historically, no movie has ever grossed more than $116M for a June OW (Man of Steel), and $100M+ has only ever happened 4 times (MoS, Toy Story 3, Transformers x2). So they're probably playing the odds. +$20M on the previous June record sounds about right to me."
boxoffice,39l5tf,Mojammer,5,Fri Jun 12 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when the numbers get big the safe bet is to be conservative.  And for a website that makes money from headlines if you go to the high end too fast and then have to backtrack you'll get less traffic than if the headline number keeps rising.  There's some story-telling skill involved."
boxoffice,39l5tf,mrstickball,3,Fri Jun 12 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its analytics vs. history... And its very hard to say which one wins out. Analytics says ""$150m"" or whereabouts. History says ""$110m"" because MoS had an even larger Thursday ($21m).   All I know is that its doing extremely well in China, and is on-track for $100m+ there for the week+weekend."
boxoffice,39l5tf,Mojammer,3,Fri Jun 12 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"I just learned this week (well, I read this on another movies board...) that Man of Steel's walmart number was a buyout by walmart who then sold around 80% of those tickets to actual movie-goers.  I'm not sure if the $12m was at normal prices or if Walmart got a deal on that.  Seems likely it was some kind of discount so it's hard to say how it compares ticket-wise to normal grosses."

I am happy I'm winning this bet but.... $150m? Utter insanity. That's in addition to the ~$61m its made in 2 days overseas. It is, in fact, tracking to hit north of $400m globally."

Pratt and Howard were both great, there were some genuinely funny moments, pretty predictable but still enjoyable.                     That said, don't think while watching it because it will frustrate you. There are a lot of ""are you fucking kidding me?"" moments. A LOT."

But today I watched it in a packed house full of families and with my own family. And holy shit did the audience eat it up. Lots of screams. Lots of laughs. The entire theatre broke out in huge applause as soon as the credits rolled. My dad, honest to god, was emotional and declared it the best thing he'd seen this year. This is an elderly gentleman who watches mostly movies from his home country and is unimpressed by special effects.  And I realised that this movie is perhaps not a good movie but as a straight crowd pleaser it was near-perfect. Despite poking fun at itself, it was genuine, un-cynical, and basically rewarded everybody who fell in love with JP back in '93.  Very weird for me on a film-loving basis, but this is box office gold. This is what people want to feel when they're at the movies en masse. Action, excitement, humour. If the romance was done better this would be a AAA."

I didn't care about the dino mayhem, I watched it like you would...well, a movie... because it looked so bad. Poor Chris Pratt commanding a pen of non-existent raptors who lunge at him and he doesn't flinch because they aren't there. All the actors have that odd, half-blind, acting-opposite-a-tennis-ball kind of reactions, and you can tell. By this point you can really tell. Raptor heads in cages without shadows on them, being touched by actors who are clearly just touching empty air.   The only animal I believed in the entire film was the damn apatasaur, and that damn scene made me cry. Because A DINOSAUR! A DINOSAUR! It's really there!!! AAAHHH!!!   Ahem....

boxoffice,39mjy1,stoicblunder,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"HSX always lists a blockbuster's opening pretty low months out, even with a trailer - unless it's a surefire winner like Avengers, people don't start pouring money in until the date gets closer. I think the other reason people might have been low on it is that both Lost World and JP3 were just pretty terrible - it was easy to rationalize that this one wouldn't be a barn burner either. I think the fact that Chris Pratt is having a moment now combined with a trailer that looked pretty good upped the excitement factor."

Its looking at possibly $450 due to the huge number of places it opened up at before Friday ($61m before Friday worldwide + $150-160 US + $80m China weekend = $290m before you add in the 60+ territories it was in Fri-Sun)"

GU2 was an ensemble and made less money than the first one, t it had a better OW. and he has a lot of $100M+ releases. But now he's moving to Netflix for his next four movies. Is that Netflix being proactive in picking up original movies, or Sandler being ahead of the curve on his own popularity?"
boxoffice,39i1a5,Prax150,9,Fri Jun 12 02:41:26 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting: Dinklage with a mullet, which will get people in theaters; Josh Gad aka Olaf from Frozen, which admittedly isn't that much of a sell in live-action but could still draw some people; if Terminator flops, Ant-Man will be the only major action hit since Jurassic World, which will build up anticipation and interest in Pixels (see: in April, people were expecting Tomorrowland to do $150m and San Andreas to get $80m, but the failure of the former built up the strength of the latter); they used recognizable video games that have stayed in the public domain for decades, which means Sony will draw up to three generations of people interested.  Yeah, Sandler's not exactly hitting his stride lately, but I think this is an outlier both for quality and performance (I've only seen a few rumblings, but people are saying the commercials are using lowest-common denominator humor and hiding actual quality - not Oscar-worthy value, of course, but enough that it'll be Sandler's best movie in a long time). I'd expect its RT score to be between 55 and 70 percent with an opening weekend of $45m and a final gross of $140m domestic."

boxoffice,39i1a5,Cynicbats,5,Thu Jun 11 21:56:28 2015 UTC,Do you think Ready Player One is going to actually happen? I feel like all of the intellectual property involved there is going to be real tough to acquire and without it the movie would suffer in comparison to the book. I hope it does happen though - I loved the book.
boxoffice,39i1a5,Pripat99,4,Thu Jun 11 22:10:39 2015 UTC,"Nope. Even if Spielberg is the director, I just don't think it'll happen."
boxoffice,39i1a5,Cynicbats,5,Thu Jun 11 22:40:22 2015 UTC,"Since Spielberg is attached and not a director with more of a ""pop culture senseability"" (Edgar Wright, for example) I have a feeling a lot of the 80's references won't be included and it will be more of a straight sci-fi story. I just don't see a guy who was such a major part of 80's pop culture making a movie that celebrates it with the same level of geekiness that someone who grew up in that era and was raised on his films would, his perspective on it all is just too different."
boxoffice,39i1a5,Pripat99,2,Thu Jun 11 23:30:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't imagine how it would even work without the cultural references. They're such an integral part of the book that without them it would essentially be ""here's a treasure hunt with clues"" and I feel like it would lose a lot of its luster quickly. I can see them cutting a lot of the references simply because they can't get access to the intellectual property, but all of them? It would kill the heart and soul of the story."

MacFarlane needs to make something new with the concept, because comedy sequels are more unreliable than action franchises. Look at Hangover 3, who could predict that it would bomb so badly after two straight hits?  And the MacFarlane movie brand just took a big hit with the ""Million ways to die in the West"" disaster.  You know what? Forget what I just said. I just checked the imdb page for Ted 2 and Sam Jones is also in this one. There's no way it will fail."

boxoffice,39i1a5,ms__marvel,4,Sat Jun 13 17:15:30 2015 UTC,"You're right about it not being wise. Even their weakest property of late (Thor 2) made 200 mill domestic. But after 3 global phenomenons in Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy and then Age of Ultron in the last 12 months, there are very few reasons to why Ant-Man will underperform. It might not be amazing, but it will hardly gross something like an Adam Sandler movie would."
boxoffice,39i1a5,Gamb1993,5,Sat Jun 13 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"God no, whether it's liked or not, it won't be a flop. At worst I imagine it will do slightly better than breaking even. I can see it being considered a flop by current Marvel standards, as in it only does okay and not amazingly, but it won't lose them money.  EDIT: By liked or not I don't mean if it's rubbish, I mean if it's not considered as good as the other films. If it's considered total trash then I suspect it'll flop. I find that unlikely though."

We will see - Nemo is one of my favorites (behind Monsters Inc.) so maybe I just have to have some faith!"
boxoffice,39cl2l,Mushroomer,2,Thu Jun 11 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"He's probably in the same spot that Stanton was in after John Carter.

boxoffice,39cl2l,Pripat99,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"That's a great analogy with Stanton, and I agree. Funny enough, I think Bird was one of the possibilities to direct the upcoming Star Wars and he declined in order to direct this."

From a mass appeal perspective, I could tell it was completely doa. The trailer was absolutely terrible. It told us nothing and it made th movie seem bland, boring, and lame. That is the kiss of death. This the age of super hero films, the more absurd and over the top the better. The top film last year was essentially a theme park ride masquerading as a movie. Look at the big winners this year, none of them are what you would call intellectual or subtle, which is why the marketing for Tomorrowland made no sense. Show me explosions, make me laugh, make me feel something. Instead we got a limp wrist introduction to a movie that could be great, but most of us will never know becaue we went to see mad max for a 3rd time."

boxoffice,39apqa,Skyhooks,5,Wed Jun 10 14:32:23 2015 UTC,I'm guessing under $300. Blockbusters are getting more and more front loaded and that would take like a $150M opening to reach.
boxoffice,39apqa,mardfet,6,Wed Jun 10 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"If it opens to 120+, 300 mil will be pretty easy for it to achieve. I mean, a 2.5 multiplier is pretty standard. It also helps that from what I've gathered the word of mouth on this film will be pretty great, and it will be a fun movie that most people will want to see. But there is no way it reaches 350 with out very strong word of mouth."
boxoffice,39apqa,jburd22,3,Wed Jun 10 18:23:57 2015 UTC,Godzilla opened to $93 and topped out at $200. Transformers opened to $100 and topped out at $240.
boxoffice,39apqa,mardfet,4,Wed Jun 10 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"Godzilla also had lukewarm reception. Transformers saw major franchise fatigue.   The thing with Jurassic World is that giving the franchise a long break and nostalgia (along with what seems to be pretty effective marketing) will drive this to have a big opening weekend. If general reception is solid, it totally has a shot at reaching $300+ million domestically.  Not saying it will happen, of course, but of all the live-action movies coming out over the rest of the summer, I think this one has the most potential to hit that mark."
boxoffice,39apqa,Bugger217,2,Wed Jun 10 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"Godzilla had very mixed word of mouth (a lot hated it and told people not to see it). transformers 4 was, well, those who saw it know. I think Jurassic World lends itself to a larger audience and should have good legs. From what I've heard it delivers on the 'fun' aspect, and all the reviews I've seen say that despite its problems it's a blast. These things usually lend to films doing well. If it plays like a marvel film (basically get the same crowd) it will easily reach 300M."

boxoffice,398dmy,Dorkside,3,Wed Jun 10 00:11:51 2015 UTC,"That's just absurd.  Netflix spends on ALL OF IT'S CONTENT (both originals and licensing, tv series and movies) something like 2 billion dollars per year.  The most successful movies make alone that much with box office and home media. There is no way Netflix could ever threaten film business with $8/user/month model, because they simply haven't enough money to pay for feature films.  Netflix paid 30 million dollars for War Machine. And that's it, one fixed fee. It doesn't matter even if it will become the most popular movie of the year, 30 million is all it's gonna ever get from Netflix. If Brad Pitt movie would make 30 million in box office everyone would think that it's a massive flop. But somehow when Netflix pays 30 million for it everyone is saying that it's some kind of proof that Netflix will kill movie theatres. Again, just absurd. I mean even something like Insidious Chapter 3 has already made 40 million dollars in box office and it's been there only couple of days.  tl;dr: Netflix spends something like 2 billion dollars per year for all of it's content and that includes both originals and licensing. How Netflix could ever compete with theatre distribution with that small amount of money?"
boxoffice,398dmy,IndyBrodaSolo,7,Wed Jun 10 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure. With Netflix, their ticket to the big time was HoC, which was great not just in quality but it offered you ""television on your time"" as opposed to waiting week after week, it kinda reinvented the way we watched the medium.   With features...I mean it's cheaper and it's in the comfort of your own home? What makes it unique? I'm not really sure if that's going to make it a factor player just yet.   Now granted, VOD has exploded in the last few years and audiences have demonstrated with the smaller indie releases (that do limited theatrical run and VOD simultaneously) that they're okay ponying up the cash if they can stay in their own home.... but  is War Machine that big of a threat to the film business in general? I'm not sold.   Now. If you were to tell me Netflix was premiering a summer blockbuster equivolent, like a Marvel/DC Feature, the next fast/furious, something that has a massive built in audience -- I think that would lead the business to be more concerned. Right now I think it's still early days and we're all just testing the waters."
boxoffice,398dmy,dontcallitjelly,10,Wed Jun 10 03:03:58 2015 UTC,I don't personally see Netflix investing $100 million + on a film any time soon. Not when they can develop 10 seasons of TV shows for the same price.
boxoffice,398dmy,ASIWYFA,4,Wed Jun 10 04:40:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly; with Netflix, a massive film like that isn't going to earn them an immediate profit apart from the new people who don't have Netflix, rather than the people who are already subscribed and along for the ride.  They simply don't have to spend their money on something like that, they wouldn't make enough true profit from it. One day with a new subscription model (which is DESTINED to happen with Netflix) a $100M movie would make a lot more sense."

Also, it's a movie with fast, gorgeous cars, lots of over the top action, hot chicks and it doesn't take itself too seriously either, it's something anyone 18+ would be able to enjoy really.  Avengers 2 on the other hand was pretty terrible (completely killed off my willingness to see more superhero movies, too) and couldn't rely on the kind of novelty the first movie relied upon."

Furious is a huge franchise and this is the last time you will see Paul Walker in the franchise (or ever). Avengers was an event but Avengers 2 was just a continuation of the MCU series.                     One is a series finale and the other is episode 7 of the series.

boxoffice,398ziy,swellipop,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:50:04 2015 UTC,While 'flop' is far too strong a word to call for Age of Ultron's performance the fact that it's doing less business then the original Avengers should be something the studio should keep tabs on. Considering both Thor: Dark World and Winter Soldier (and arguably GotG) got an Avengers bump you'd think the trend would extend to its direct sequel. It could be the start of Marvel hero fatigue from the public. Though I'd have to say we'd need to see how Ant Man performs before we can even start to wonder if it's occurring or not.
boxoffice,398ziy,iamateenagehandmodel,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"As a casual movie goer, the winter soldier and guardians were really good movies maybe Avengers helped a little bit but even without the Avengers they would have been a box office success and  would have earned 700 millions easily.   Age of ultron while did get help from the first avengers success, actually suffered because of the avengers. It was over hyped and people had impossible expectations and when it didn't stand up to its ""hype"", they said it's not as good as the first one which led to its box office decline.   Though I'd have to say we'd need to see how Ant Man performs before we can even start to wonder if it's occurring or not.   I won't set Ant man as a bar to judge whether Marvel is declining or not. Ant-Man is the least known and the most silly superhero to the general audience. Departure of Edgar Wright made many people uninterested in the movie. I would look at Civil War to judge whether Marvel is declining or not.  It's funny how Age of Ultron is in top 5 grossing movies  of all time. only somewhat a hundred million less than the first one and people are acting like it is the end of Marvel."

I'm kind of expecting middling reviews and reception based on what I've heard (just a prediction though, and sometimes general audiences receive a movie better then critics), so I don't think it holds super well. I'm guessing it ends around $250 million.   one thing it has going for it though, as far as having a strong hold, there's not a ton of direct competition until Terminator on July 1st, leaving most of June to Jurassic World. Inside Out will take some of the family audiences away but thats about it. Because of that I'd give it a ceiling much higher then my prediction, probably around like $320 million. but again I don't think it reaches that at all"
boxoffice,38zv6r,lot183,2,Mon Jun 8 16:22:58 2015 UTC,so you are expecting it to perform almost exactly like Transformers 4 did last summer?

It's common to hold on reviews because If they are good, they can build quick momentum for a lot of people. This is so that people can be like ""Oh Jurassic World has great reviews, it also comes out tomorrow lets go see it""."
boxoffice,38zv6r,GoldandBlue,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:25:33 2015 UTC,You hold the for the week not for the day off. I a not saying the movie will be bad but the handling of the press is usually reserved for bad movies. To say that is untrue is you doing exactly what you are accusing me off. You want the movie to be good so you are trying to justify the handling of the embargo.
boxoffice,38zv6r,Mybrainmelts,4,Mon Jun 8 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it is not uncommon. Like Galoofy said, it's only a bad sign when the embargo lasts until the day of release. Holding off on reviews can be successful if they are positive because you can create a massive wave of instant hype. To me this means that the reviews are likely in the 'good' area which will likely have little effect on the box office."
boxoffice,38zv6r,Daxtreme,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:59:11 2015 UTC,"Every movie holds off reviews, that is not what is in question. You want reviews to come out the week off so that all the talk is about your movie. For Example Mad Max, we weren't talking about the embargo at this time of it's release, we were talking about how well received it was. What Jurassic World is doing, waiting until the last minute to allow people to talk about the film is historically saved for bad movies and you guys are trying to act like the two approaches are the same. They are not. Having an embargo is almost universal practice. Having an embargo until the last minute is historically a bad sign. That is what Jurassic World is doing."
boxoffice,38zv6r,SethR0gen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:00:42 2015 UTC,a Jurassic Park movie isn't Aloha.
boxoffice,38zv6r,BatmanDavey1986,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds reasonable, that's around what I think as well. It would have to be amazing though to have good legs, this is a summer release and they rarely have legs, even the good movies. It has to be Guardians good or something."
boxoffice,38zv6r,petepostlethwaite,2,Mon Jun 8 15:13:28 2015 UTC,the key is to connect with the audience (which Guardians did). Having Chris Pratt is a HUGE advantage and maybe the films biggest asset.
boxoffice,38yw5v,Dorkside,12,Mon Jun 8 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"I think Attack of the Clones (the lowest grossing Star Wars film), adjusted for inflation, sets an absolute basement for The Force Awakens: That's $434 million.  I recognize that that's a large number. But with the return of the original cast, I have to believe that the movie would have to be almost unimaginably terrible to perform worse than AotC. In fact, I don't think that realistically predicting $500 million is insane. It may even be conservative.  $500 million guarantees The Force Awakens the domestic crown for the year.  Now, here's the big question: What does TFA's foreign box office look like? Star Wars films have historically underperformed worldwide (with worldwide share 5-10% lower than other high-grossing films in the same year). If TFA does 70% of its business worldwide, then you're looking at $1.6 billion+ and it takes the crown. But if it only does 60%, then it would come up short even if it made $600 million domestically.  And, IMO, it's really hard to say what Star Wars will do at the foreign box office. Superhero movies were struggling for years with a pattern very similar to Star Wars (under-performing other high-grossing films at the foreign box office), and then the MCU smashed through the barrier a couple years back. Was that superhero/MCU-specific? Or will Star Wars end up benefiting from a similar change in the worldwide market?  (If Star Wars performs at its historical share of 50-55%, of course, it's got almost zero chance of taking the worldwide crown for the year. But that's not realistic given the explosion of the foreign box office over the last 2-3 years.)"
boxoffice,38yw5v,hamlet9000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"Well said. I don't have anything to add, but sometimes a simple upvote doesn't seem like enough."
boxoffice,38yw5v,ghettothf,8,Mon Jun 8 05:28:53 2015 UTC,"This should be a no brainer.  Star Wars has the cushy holiday season where movies are not front loaded and have long legs.  I think $500 million is a lock.    The biggest wildcard for its worldwide gross is China.  The top 3 movies of all time there are Furious 7, Transformers 4, Age of Ultron.  I can't say for sure how much Chinese people like Star Wars, but I can say for sure it's not even remotely close to the love it gets in other parts of the world.  The chances of surpassing Furious 7 I'd say are practically nil, and likely pretty low of surpassing Transformers 4.    I'd say a billion is reasonable for international gross, a $500 million domestic.  Let's be optimistic here and say $1.6 billion.  Not close to Avatar levels, but I don't think anyone is expecting it to reach that level other than blind fanboys."
boxoffice,38yw5v,jburd22,6,Mon Jun 8 05:24:36 2015 UTC,"Looks like it should be a three way race between Avengers, Star Wars and Hunger Games for the top spot of 2015.  Let's say Avengers finishes with around $450 million, which seems likely.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 grossed $295 million and Part 2 got about a 30% bump to gross $381 million. If Mockingjay Part 2 gets a similar bounce it should gross $438 million which would leave it short of Age of Ultron.  I'm thinking Star Wars has a strong chance at $500 million, so this is my predicted top three domestic movies for 2015:   Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens - $500 million Avengers: Age of Ultron - $450 million The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 - $438 million   I'm sure people will dispute the exact dollar amounts, but does anyone want to argue that the top three earners will be ranked in a different order?"
boxoffice,38yw5v,jburd22,12,Mon Jun 8 00:52:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see Mockingjay having that much of an increase honestly. I believe that it's guaranteed 400 mil, but to me I don't see it topping Catching Fire's 424 dom total.  Harry potter 8 was a fucking event, the so called end of an era, where hunger games has been loosing momentum with the last one (though I seem to be in the minority that think it's without a doubt the best one). Also twilight peeked with Eclipse which was also it's third last instalment. Plus with Spectre and Force awakens, I think Hunger Games will have a little less buzz, but hey never doubt Katniss I guess. Catching Fire was so big despite Frozen Fever so maybe I'm wrong and not seeing the signs.  Force Awakens will have the challenge of beating Avengers Domestically and Furious 7 internationally, the latter seeming like a harder achievement. I do think it will beat Avengers atleast Domestically because it will be a pop culture event. I don't see avengers not being in the top 2, so Furious 7, Jurassic World, Mockingjay, Minions, and Sceptre will all fight for 3-7 spots. We pretty much have almost 7 guaranteed 300 M+ films this year where last year only had 3 (more like 2, American Sniper is a 2015 movie). It's also very likely that more than half of these will join the billion dollar club (so yay money).  I'm actually very intensely looking forward to how jurassic World performs this weekend. Star wars is a guaranteed hit, but Jurassic world could rather be frontloaded like last years Godzilla,or pull off monster legs and be the big surprise hit of the year. I think that it is very possible for it to break 400 domestic and a billion WW IF it plays its cards right (great reviews and word of mouth) and could even be in this years top 3. Basically What I am saying is don't take JW out of the conversation just yet. I might do a detailed analysis and prediction some time tomorrow. Bring on the Dinos."
boxoffice,38yw5v,kplo,4,Mon Jun 8 04:27:22 2015 UTC,"Good points about Jurassic World.  I would love for it to be a wonderful movie as I'm big fan of the franchise, but the trailers and early buzz has left me sceptical."

As long as Joss doesn't fuck everything up I think SW7 will take top spot. Original cast returns, lots of special effects, holiday season, huge established fanbase. It's got a lot going for it. The reunion aspect is going to give it a similar bump as the first Avengers movie. Not sure how it will do overseas or the total grosses but I agree 100% with the order SW, AoU, HG."

It is also opening in December which means its overall gross will live and die based off word of mouth unlike the avengers. Abrams was successful with star trek, but even those didn't cross 300 million. Star wars has a legit shot at 400, but 500 is a pipe dream."
boxoffice,38yw5v,HobbieK,7,Mon Jun 8 04:27:19 2015 UTC,"Adjusted for inflation Revenge of the Sith pulled in $481 million. That was without the boost of 3D ticket sales and when the US had 25 million fewer citizens.  Given the appeal of bringing back the original cast members, I think $500 million for The Force Awakens is far from a pipe dream."

boxoffice,38yw5v,jburd22,3,Tue Jun 9 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"I think at the moment there are a lot of people boarded on the Avengers train because it's more or less a family superhero movie. Kids are more invested into Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Cap, etc. than into Vader, Yoda, Luke, Han, etc. Which means that families are more invested into the supers as well, which ultimately gives it the advantage at the box office, in that respect IMO."

boxoffice,38yw5v,jburd22,4,Mon Jun 8 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it doesn't have a chance, In fact I'd be flabbergasted if it didn't reach atleast a billion. It's just there's a significant difference between 1 bil and 1.5 bil. Domestically I don't see TFA reaching Phantom Menace, so if it wants to reach that number it needs to really step it up overseas. Maybe with some help from China, which as of late is the big wild card."
boxoffice,38yw5v,Daxtreme,4,Mon Jun 8 04:38:14 2015 UTC,"The Force Awakens is definitely the biggest wildcard left this year. I mean, it can realistically gross $1 bil, $1.5 bil, $2 bil even, if it's received very very well. No one knows, that's what's driving everyone mad! It has a range of 1 bil, which is unheard of as far as I can tell."
boxoffice,38yw5v,JonPaula,2,Mon Jun 8 04:44:38 2015 UTC,"For my money Jurassic World is the biggest wild card this year, but yes TFA is still a pretty big wild card.

Its budget should be around $150-170 million (unknown right now), so a gross similar to Captain America 2 is entirely fine with them and a success in itself.  There will be a point where Marvel will hit a ""flop"" though. It might be Ant-Man, who knows. :P I say ""flop"" because at this point, the Marvel viewerbase is so loyal that even a box office disappointment might still show decent numbers."

boxoffice,38yhx4,stoicblunder,2,Mon Jun 8 18:28:53 2015 UTC,Mad Max's production budget is $150 million.   The old rule of thumb is that your domestic box office needs to hit your your production budget to turn a profit. Mad Max is very likely to do this.  The new rule of thumb is that you need to do twice your production budget in worldwide gross to be profitable. Mad Max has already done this.

Also, it's making most of its box office from foreign markets which give a lower return to the studio. TMNT had a similar budget last year of 150 million and made 480 million worldwide. It ended up making only 80 million in profit once rentals, vod, and sales were factor in. So Mad Max might come up short. I think people love it, so it could way overperform in secondary market."

Entourage came back down to earth hard after those ridiculous early numbers. Even people who liked the show were asking, do we really needs this movie.  Now does Spy have any staying power because it turns out it is a very good film? Or is it too late. Jurassic world is going to obliterate everything in its path next weekend. People are still way under estimating how big JW is going to be.  Sad about Aloha. 60% drop. Saw it last week like a rubbernecker. Wow did Crowe fuck up. Perfect cast, perfect locale. A great idea for a story. The he just Richie Tenebaum's it. Honestly one of the worst films I have seen by a major studio.

It's also going to be the only comedy besides Entourage in theaters until Ted 2 arrives, so it should do fine. The R rating probably is hurting it, but from what I've heard it was worth the rating for the humor. Strong WOM should help, I could definitely see more Feig-McCarthy collaborations in the future."

Add in some good numbers from Australia and other regions you might see it hit 180-190 total box office. It's probably gonna end up short I think or break even. It failed in the sense that they expected much more out of it. It may break even, but it is not going to be very profitable if at all."
boxoffice,38wyxl,pajamalamaobama,3,Sun Jun 7 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"What the hell? Where did you get $200 million for cost? This isn't exactly Mad Max. $65m budget plus a low-medium marketing spend - remember, Fox played it at SXSW and various festivals and got a lot of free publicity to launch their hype train, which saved them more money than an all-out ad blitz would - and it's going to turn a tidy profit. This result is a little on the low end, but it by no means is a flop.  Melissa McCarthy movies hold well - even Tammy did $85m after a $30m 5-day launch - and it's the only R-rated comedy in the market until Ted 2 in three weeks. Add in the good reviews and that female-driven movies usually have decent legs anyway, and it's in even better shape. I really can't see it grossing any less than Tammy over time, and wouldn't be surprised if it crept past $100m by the end of its run. It'll take hits from Jurassic World and Inside Out, but at the same time it's decent counter-programming to those two movies as well. And it already has $56m overseas, which means Fox's international team is doing their jobs. Worst-case scenario for Fox is a $200m worldwide gross, and even then they'll make a profit in the end due to long-tail sales and ancillaries."
boxoffice,38wyxl,stoicblunder,0,Sun Jun 7 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"So 65 mil production cost. Pure production. That doesn't include distribution or marketing at all. Domestic release cost will probably be around $50 million. Foreign will be the same around 40-50 million. Digital release costs should be about 30-40 million for both Domestic and Foreign. You are looking at least at 190 million for cost alone. That doesn't include residuals and other payouts to performers. Now that I look closer, this is probably going be over 200 million for cost."

I understand why they marketed it that way, but audiences are fickle and always want something new. The film has so much more to offer than what they showed in the trailers. With decent marketing, no reason why this doesn't open to over 40 million. Great movie, bankable stars, only real comp was 3rd movie in diminishing horror brand."

boxoffice,38wyxl,ribblesquat,2,Sun Jun 7 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about using ""long tail"" to refer to sales over time at all. That was not the original intent of using the statistical term in business.  It was referring to cheaper production and distribution costs for various products allowing a company to make more money selling a greater number of unique products with smaller audiences  instead of making a few products and hoping one will be a megaseller. On a sales graph with the megasellers on one side of the graph the smaller audience products trail out behind it to look like a ""long tail.""  Hey, I know I'm foolish to be frustrated by this because language is a living thing and after the term was popularized in an '04 Wired article everyone heard it and just sort of said, ""Oh yeah, that must be sales over time."" It still drives me crazy. It's like ""it's"" vs ""its"" for me.  EDIT: I just thought of an example of a movie company making money off the original long tail concept. The Asylum with their mockbusters. Many products with low production costs and they won't be megasellers but each product has its own small audience."

There would be daily updates Thursday - Sunday with relevant details and connections to why the film was successful or not (how was it marketed? What have recent genre/star/creative team/studio successes and trends done to boost it? What is the state of the box office overall?) It's tough to manufacture, the site in its prime was just written by passionate people who put all the pieces together they could find, they used to have movie reviews which was great, but that ended long ago.  Not to mention their database - I want any statistic since 1980? Clear lists of a number of different records? Comprehensive and up to date release schedule? It's quality information, painstakingly researched and detailed, written about passionately.   I could go on and on, I've browsed the site frequently for over 10 years and I can't say that about most sites. The lack of interest in the site by its own publishers, as well as projections that VOD and streaming will overtake the relevance of home video media and theatrical revenues in a few short years doesn't bode well."

If you adjust for inflation the record certainly goes to the Excorist ($441m in 1973 dollars) at well over $1bn (It sits at number 9 all time adjusted in the US alone).
boxoffice,38vqjd,FartingBob,12,Sun Jun 7 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"I could probably think of a couple of potential candidates, but the issue is that many studios will flake and cut out the potentially R rated scenes from movies just to lower the rating and cater to a wider audience (and make more bank), so it's pretty difficult to reliably predict what movies would actually be R rated if they were made."

The professor said that the wider the age group for a movie or tv show, the more people will go to see it. That is why so many of the PG-13 and PG movies have the billions of dollars in revenue. So by using that prediction (even accounting for the ""children"" who get into the R rated movie), it still might take a while for that to happen if it were to ever happen."

boxoffice,38t63z,best_in_life,27,Sat Jun 6 18:04:24 2015 UTC,I'd wager about $100 million more for safety. A total take of $500 million would be perfect.
boxoffice,38t63z,SethR0gen,13,Sat Jun 6 18:08:52 2015 UTC,150m was what it was supposed to cost before all the re-shoots. No one actually knows the total budget and given how they're trying hard to keep it from getting out I'm thinking over 200m.

boxoffice,38t63z,Mojammer,7,Sun Jun 7 05:43:02 2015 UTC,"Long term break even point is more or less 1.75X production budget.  If you look at Deadline's most profitable movies of 2014 you'll see the box office is only one piece of the puzzle (though as the first piece it's certainly the most important and sets up the others).    So give MMFR's $150-200m budget the break even zone most likely starts around $275m, and it's definitley there by $350m.  Most movies don't break even from box office alone."
boxoffice,38t63z,SethR0gen,5,Sat Jun 6 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Don't know where you're getting your information from, but if it cost 200m, break even starts around 375ish. 200m plus (lets be kind) 60m for marketing is 260m. If the movie makes 375 and keeps 65% of that which is also being kind it will have recouped 243.75, and then make up the rest with dvd, pov, etc. No way does it start breaking even at 275m, or is it definitely there by 350m, because the average a movie will make post theaters is 30-60m depending on the movie. Also remember, those figures were kind. The truth is harsher. The very list youre quoting put interstellar with a budget of 165, and a gross of nearly 700m having only make 45-50m in profit."
boxoffice,38t63z,Mojammer,2,Sun Jun 7 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"SNL kagan is a research company that analyzes a bunch of things including movies, and they say long term profitability is reached somewhere in the 1.4-1.75X area, so 1.75 just for simplicity.  If the box office gets to that area then over its lifetime a movie will most likely make back all its costs.  Doesn't line up exactly with Deadline's profitability, I linked to that just to show that a movie's income and expenses include much more than production and box office."

Now, you could replace the sand bit with them getting stuck in the water/mud and have him find out there and use the sandstorm sequence for the final return as a climax, but then you'd lose out on the character development of Nux throughout that scene (working together with Max as he becomes closer to the group) and considering he was the only character to have any development, it's best that was included."

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One Captain America: Civil War X-Men: Apocalypse (the last one only made $234 million worldwide domestically but it was so well received that I see this one getting a boost) Alice Through The Looking Glass"

boxoffice,38up64,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:09:15 2015 UTC,It's actually more like Star Wars 3.9. Just sayin'.
boxoffice,38up64,Dorkside,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:05:56 2015 UTC,"Here are my domestic predictions for the movies you mentioned:   Star Wars: Episode VII - $385 million Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - $355 million Captain America: Civil War - $335 million Alice Through the Looking Glass - $240 million X-Men: Apocalypse - $225 million Kung Fu Panda 2 - $160 million Independence Day 2 - $155 million Ice Age 5 - $150 million   I'm probably being bearish on the majority of my predictions but I think most of the sequels in 2016 are going to underperform their predecessors.  I think the biggest example of that will be Through the Looking Glass, which I'm guessing will fall way short of the original.  It never seems wise to bet against animated family films, so I wouldn't be shocked if Ice Age and Kung Fu Panda both wildly exceed my estimates."
boxoffice,38up64,oakattack,4,Sun Jun 7 00:32:50 2015 UTC,Ice Age 5 will do 200 +. Can't see Tarzan having the legs to put up a fight. Ghostbusters (which will probably be delayed) might take a bit.
boxoffice,38up64,Dorkside,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:42:33 2015 UTC,I don't think 200+ is a lock considering the last Ice Age grossed $161 million back in 2012.

boxoffice,38up64,kayjay734,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean Rogue One? That gets released in 2016. Episode VII gets released later this year.  And I think you're wayyyy underestimating Rogue One, BvS, and probably Civil War as well. In fact, I'd go so far as to guarantee that they'll all perform better than you've predicted. I can't see any Star Wars film performing under $400 million these days, especially if Episode VII is received as well as we hope it will be. Batman v Superman combines the two most iconic superheroes of all time on screen for the first time, and the anticipation for the movie has basically broken Comic Con in half the past two years, so I'd venture to say it's the most heavily hyped superhero team-up film ever (notice I said hyped -- the first Avengers wasn't nearly as big of a deal this far out from release -- and I don't think BvS will make as much, but I think it's more anticipated). Civil War is also basically Avengers 2.5 and will be marketed as such, even though it's officially under the Captain America umbrella."
boxoffice,38up64,Dorkside,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"I know I wrote Episode VII, but I meant VIII which I now realize is not out until 2017.  It turns out we're extremely far apart on Rogue One seeing as how you think it will out gross what I'm predicting for VIII.  I'm about about as big of a Star Wars lover as there is, but I think fans are getting carried away with how they think it'll perform. Lots of people seem to believe The Force Awakens will be giving Avatar a run for it's money which I think is far fetched, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong.  I guess we can check back in a couple years and find out who was right. See you then!"
boxoffice,38up64,kayjay734,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:22:03 2015 UTC,"Episode III made over $380 million in 2005. Strictly accounting for inflation, if as many people go to see this movie as did that one, Episode VIII should make around $500 million. This isn't even accounting for the fact that said movie should have hype levels a la Episode I preceding it (the most recent trailer for VII broke the record its past trailer held for most views in a day, week, month, etc), that the prequels are much farther in the rear view mirror than they were in 2005, and that there seems to be a renewed sense of optimism surrounding the new direction of the franchise -- that's not even to mention the 3D/I-MAX premiums that play a large role in inflating blockbusters' domestic takes.  I'm just saying I don't think there's any way that this movie doesn't garner at least as many viewers as Ep. III did (which would mean it would blow $380 million out of the water) and that it likely will attract far more viewers, considering it's not fighting as much of an uphill battle with the public and for the simple reason that there are nearly 35 million more people living in the United States, which means that there's a larger pool for the money to come from (yes, I realize that those 35 million people are all 10 and under, but many of them will be going to see this movie, and many of the people who were too young to be interested in seeing Star Wars in 05 are now old enough).  The above statements apply to both VII and VIII, by the way. I know you were talking about VIII specifically. And no, I don't think The Force Awakens will break $2.78 billion worldwide, or even $2 billion worldwide, but I think $1.7-$1.8 billion is in the mix if it's very good."
boxoffice,38up64,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:42:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Avatar, but with all the hype surrounding The Force Awakens, I find it hard to believe it won't outgross the first Avengers in the North American market ($623 million)."

boxoffice,38swjz,SethR0gen,3,Sat Jun 6 19:16:18 2015 UTC,Agreed completely and even Will Smith is coming off two wide release movies that both did under $61 million domestically.

boxoffice,38qdzx,Go_Arachnid_Laser,8,Fri Jun 5 23:08:04 2015 UTC,All reports I've seen for Jurassic World have been around the 130m mark. Genysis is a real wild card. Maybe unexpected good reviews will make things clearer.

boxoffice,38qdzx,Dorkside,4,Fri Jun 5 23:59:14 2015 UTC,"If it opens to 120ish like they're predicting it'll be closer to the 300 end, but thats if."

If Jurassic World holds up similarly to those movie it could come well short of $300 million even with a $120 million opening."
boxoffice,38qdzx,TuckingFypo69,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:29:43 2015 UTC,"I'll just say this. Unless the movie has terrible reviews it wont drop as much as those movies because it's not exactly a direct sequel at this point since there's been so much time in between, and it has no direct competition in terms of summer action movies for 3 weeks after release and at that point it's just Terminator, which who knows how that'll do. Also, even if the movie drops the same as Transformers which like you said opened to 100m, not 120m it'll makes another 35m more than it did, 20m the first weekend, plus 8m the second, 3m, etc. Bring it's total closer to 300m than 250m, but again that's only if it opens to the 120m they're predicting, which somehow I doubt it'll open that big."
boxoffice,38qdzx,lasersaurous,7,Sun Jun 7 06:12:01 2015 UTC,How is the movie Southpaw going to make just $2 Million more than Max?! I am either overestimating Gyllenhaal's draw power or underestimating a dog's draw power.
boxoffice,38qdzx,tcatron565,3,Sat Jun 6 08:34:58 2015 UTC,Because it has to work against pixels and max has nothing real to compete with so southpaw will be lower than its popularity compared to max which will be higher

boxoffice,38qdzx,jhawk1117,5,Sat Jun 6 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Really? I would imagine that after the success of Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation would definitely surpass 200M domestic. Now we can't look at the opening of MI:GP and predict a likely scenario, since GP opened at fewer screens and then expanded over the Christmas weekend. But I feel MI:RN will be a WW success owing to the Tom Cruise-factor (stunts included), & the brand name. The marketing highlighted the best parts, and it's got the audience's attention. As long as the content doesn't end up being terrible, MI:RG could be the biggest success in the franchise."

boxoffice,38qdzx,jhawk1117,3,Sat Jun 6 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"Disagree entirely. Hawkeye and Black Widow never had a solo film but both have been given plenty of development.  Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch had a good amount too. Look at the X-Men films - outside of two subpar Wolverine films you never had a solo flick but the characters developed plenty.   I'd rather they trying something new with an ensemble like Civil War than rehash yet another origin story.  And speaking of Civil War, plenty of people are pumped about Spidey showing up and I'm willing to bet he has more development than in the four shitty solo films."
boxoffice,38qdzx,taylorswiftfan123,3,Sat Jun 6 03:12:01 2015 UTC,"Winter solider was basically a black widow movie as much as it was a captain America one. And she's been around since Iron Man 2, so she's been around long enough to have her character developed. Age of ultron was about 2 or 3 scenes away from being ""Hawkeye and the Avengers"" imo. Scarlet Witch is far from a fully developed character imo."
boxoffice,38qdzx,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:23:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, black widow was in winter solider a lot, but her character development was minimal outside the ""you don't want people to see your history"" line.   And why do you think they had black widow and falcon or whatever his name is in winter soldier?  Because they knew another solo film wouldn't work. So what's going to happen in Ant-Man when it's just him the whole time? Boring and recycled shit, that's what.   Did i say that Scarlett Witch was fully developed? No, I said her and Quicksilver still had development in the movie.   I actually enjoyed Age of Ultron. I've seen in twice and it's more enjoyable to me because it utilize all their strengths and cutting from character to character stops it from being boring. I also didn't think there were as many forced jokes as people made it out to be."
boxoffice,38qdzx,Dorkside,3,Sat Jun 6 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"What exact has falcon done by himself? Next to nothing of value. Black Widow could easily have a full length movie. The reason these solo films are continually being made is because they want to fully introduce the characters to a mainstream audience, that don't know the back story of these characters. And people clearly still want them."

boxoffice,38pr2k,mannymix03,2,Sat Jun 6 18:02:09 2015 UTC,I work in the industry. I love it. So this is how I can discuss in my time off
boxoffice,38pr2k,Cynicbats,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:31:42 2015 UTC,Because guessing and betting (if only in games) is fun.
boxoffice,38qflb,Daxtreme,3,Fri Jun 5 23:13:55 2015 UTC,It could be down to what exchange rate they used when converting foreign grosses into dollar.
boxoffice,38qflb,EverythingsBackwards,2,Sat Jun 6 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, however they are supposed to convert it at the time of the reported gross so... weird that it would be off that much."
boxoffice,38qflb,stoicblunder,6,Sat Jun 6 16:41:34 2015 UTC,I think you're in the wrong thread my friend.
boxoffice,38pitp,chrisychris-,3,Fri Jun 5 19:21:13 2015 UTC,"After ""Annabelle"" I wouldn't trust a prequel from a James Wan movie without Wan's involvement."
boxoffice,38pitp,Go_Arachnid_Laser,3,Fri Jun 5 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"Wan was involved, and Insidious 3 definitely was a worthy entry into the franchise imo."
boxoffice,38pitp,taylorswiftfan123,2,Sat Jun 6 05:35:39 2015 UTC,"The Hollywood Reporter: Spy to make $30-$35 million, Insidious $20-$25 million, Entourage mid-teens to $20 million over five day  Shaping up to be the weekend that everyone was predicting - Spy leading with Insidious putting out a number in line with estimates and Entourage falling off a cliff after a decent number on Wednesday. THR also puts San Andreas at $25-$27 million, which should be good enough for second place. That's a great hold if it ends up being so."
boxoffice,38pitp,Pripat99,3,Fri Jun 5 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"It would be hilarious is Insidious somehow beats out Spy and puts a stop to all those ""Melissa McCarthy can do no wrong!"" statements everyone in the media seems to be making this week."
boxoffice,38onbx,stoicblunder,13,Fri Jun 5 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"I think perhaps it's the case of, because Insidious is a popular horror franchise, the fans were more quick to run out to preview screenings than for an original comedy. Spy should benefit from word of mouth, and I'm still betting it takes the weekend.   That said, Insidious could still do a bit better than some were predicting. I think it could still be in a close race for 2nd with San Andreas, though."
boxoffice,38onbx,Bugger217,4,Fri Jun 5 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"Nah, comedies don't really do that well Thursday night because especially for something like Spy, the audience is older and there's not really a rush to see it ASAP. Spy will probably going to do best on Saturday and hold better. Stuff like horror, comic book and YA films do best on Thursday because of the fan anticipation and the younger audience more likely to rush out and see it quickly. Although it is odd Spy started at 5PM, seems really early to me."
boxoffice,38onbx,mardfet,2,Fri Jun 5 16:51:57 2015 UTC,We thinking Insidious can break 30 mil this weekend? Or is it just insanely front loaded. I think people are under estimating it
boxoffice,38onbx,Bugger217,4,Fri Jun 5 17:42:03 2015 UTC,"Horror movies in general tend to be pretty front-loaded, but Insidious is a popular franchise. I think $25-30 million is the window we're looking at here.  It's definitely not gonna open to the $40 million that Chapter 2 saw, considering that one wasn't received as well as the first film, and Chapter 3 faces much stronger competition."
boxoffice,38onbx,mrstickball,5,Fri Jun 5 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"Yes i think 25-30 makes sense. 10 million budget, i am sure they doubled that in marketing.But wow Blumehouse is really setting pace for horror film production. Its like a profit factory."
boxoffice,38onbx,tcatron565,2,Fri Jun 5 20:14:30 2015 UTC,Most horror movies are profit factories... Always have been. Spend $1-5 million and they almost always make north of $30 million. Just need a good marketing campaign and a good concept.
boxoffice,38onbx,ssjrem,2,Fri Jun 5 22:16:41 2015 UTC,This makes absolute sense to me. Highly anticipated installment of popular horror franchise premiering at night (the time when horror films bring in the most people) versus a brand new original comedy flick.  Spy will still easily win the weekend. Horror films tend to be heavily frontloaded in their weekends. (Poltergeist was nearly the #1 movie on the Friday it was released against Tomorrowland and Pitch Perfect 2's second weekend.)
boxoffice,38onbx,31FilmTalk,2,Fri Jun 5 21:22:14 2015 UTC,Spy's Thursday preview number is actually better than the previews for The Heat. It's not the kinda movie that people will rush out to see on a Thursday night. Spy should still win the weekend. I say mid 30s for Spy and upper 20s to lower 30s for Insidious.
boxoffice,38ku39,NinjaDiscoJesus,4,Thu Jun 4 21:31:22 2015 UTC,I'm amazed considering SPY is rated R. I didn't know this at all till last night selling tix at my theater.
boxoffice,38ku39,B_Elanna_Torres,2,Fri Jun 5 12:42:22 2015 UTC,R movies have been doing very well this year.
boxoffice,38ku39,GoldandBlue,6,Fri Jun 5 16:11:28 2015 UTC,I'm a little baffled how well this is being received. Never thought I'd consider seeing a McCarthy movie in the theater (especially one that looks so terrible).
boxoffice,38ku39,ninjartist,5,Fri Jun 5 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"I saw it this evening, thought it was great. I don't think I've ever seen McCarthy in anything so I don't know what the baggage is but she was awesome in this. Trailers were shit, title is shit, plot was convoluted nonsense, loved the movie anyway."
boxoffice,38ku39,ribblesquat,4,Fri Jun 5 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"She's great under the right circumstances. And pretty much infallible under Paul Feig, who's pretty much used her perfectly every time. So it's not really just McCarthy, it's Feig, Byrne, Statham too. I'm sure it's great."
boxoffice,38ku39,Prax150,4,Fri Jun 5 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Feig seems to know how to use her. Everyone else is just fat jokes."
boxoffice,38ku39,GoldandBlue,2,Fri Jun 5 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"The trailers edit the movie to look like the run-of-the-mill McCarthy character, because I think the studios are under the impression people like her for those kind of antics.  But in the movie, McCarthy plays a competent, intelligent, clever agent on her first assignment as a spy.  They never mention/make fun of her weight.  She falls over once, but it's a gag on a terribly designed scooter, not McCarthy.  She's actually pretty agile in the movie.  In kind of a funny reversal, Jason Stathem plays the over-confident, bumbling idiot.    The movie completed challenged my expectations and deserves the praise in my opinion.  It works great as both a spy movie and a parody of spy movies.  It's full of surprises, well choreographed action, and offers more humor than the usually McCarthy schtick."
boxoffice,38ku39,nunsinnikes,2,Fri Jun 5 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"Just be aware that it got a 74 on Metacritic and the Average Rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 7.3/10. Still a good score, but not as impressive in light of this information."
boxoffice,38ku39,MeMyselfandBi,-2,Fri Jun 5 17:08:35 2015 UTC,early days yet
boxoffice,38ku39,SethR0gen,12,Fri Jun 5 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"99 fresh to 6 rotten. This aint dropping below 90%.   Also, and I'm not directing this at you, but it's funny how little you see on reddit about this movie considering the good reviews. Had this starred JLaw or someone more circlejerky we'd never heard the end of it."
boxoffice,38ku39,SethR0gen,-19,Fri Jun 5 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"It should drop below eventually.  McCarthy is not well liked on reddit, I haven't seen any of her leading role movies though so am no comment  huh  EDIT 2 - 12 NOW   makes you think what childish users are actually on this small specific sub  yeah this sub is going the way of /r/movies already"
boxoffice,38ku39,SethR0gen,4,Fri Jun 5 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"I don't care for her much either in all honesty, but I'm open to any movie, especially one this well received."
boxoffice,38ku39,Prax150,-8,Fri Jun 5 00:45:51 2015 UTC,well there must be other movies out this week that are worth a ticket too  i cant afford too many tickets as jesus hates me
boxoffice,38ku39,Prax150,5,Fri Jun 5 00:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm staying home this weekend. Spy, Insidious, and Entourage are rentals for me."
boxoffice,38ku39,Fagasaurus_Rex,-3,Fri Jun 5 00:48:49 2015 UTC,they all VOD?  Crazy
boxoffice,38ifgf,Republican_Atheist,3,Thu Jun 4 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"Nice article, as someone with close ties to Rentrak it's nice to see more news on what I've been talking about privately for the past couple of years. The predictions I read last year (that were very conservative) was that the Chinese Box Office would be the same size as the US Box Office by 2020 (this may come sooner). It also speculated that it would be twice the size by 2025.   I know you're a fellow Cameron fan, so I'll add that privately I was suspicious that James Cameron actually prolonged the production of the Avatar sequels to allow for more growth in China. Not merely for Box Office receipt sake (although that may be a factor), but because I know that he'll want to get as big a global audience as possible for the message he wants to spread with Avatar."
boxoffice,38ifgf,DaveFincher,3,Thu Jun 4 12:55:24 2015 UTC,Do you think we'll see a cultural shift towards Chinese films more?   Also - I think Jim Cameron will be taking that into account because his films do really have broad international appeal. Maybe China could push Avatar 2 into even more insane numbers.
boxoffice,38ifgf,DaveFincher,-1,Thu Jun 4 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, China has a lot of big home made films. I don't see them being exported world wide any time soon though."

China allows 34 foreign films into the country each year under revenue-sharing agreements, and studios collect only 25% of box-office revenues on those titles.

boxoffice,38gqm5,NeilPoonHandler,4,Thu Jun 4 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"I like Spy at this number.   McCarthy + Bullock + Feig in The Heat, June 28, 2013 = $39M  Similar content, but subtract Bullock and insert Statham to make it appeal more to males, and I think it takes at least $35M-$40M."
boxoffice,38gqm5,CesareSomnambulist,3,Thu Jun 4 04:59:30 2015 UTC,"It has some really good reviews, so I'll probably go and see it. Didn't realize it was actually that good."
boxoffice,38gqm5,CallMeMoo,3,Thu Jun 4 15:12:47 2015 UTC,What's the draw here? Does Melissa McCarthy bring people to the movies? I'll reserve judgment for when I see the movie but the trailer didn't seem funny.
boxoffice,38gqm5,yoggiez,3,Thu Jun 4 05:01:52 2015 UTC,Today was the first time I even heard of this flick. Strange.
boxoffice,38gqm5,Likes2PaintShit,4,Thu Jun 4 07:32:25 2015 UTC,"I saw it at an early screening. It's very funny and it's very rated ""R"" so none of the Funny jokes were shown in the trailers."

boxoffice,38gqm5,Go_Arachnid_Laser,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:26:29 2015 UTC,I don't know... 'Tammy' was bad enough to kill McCarthy's appeal dead.   It looks to me more of a slow burner due to the excellent reviews than a big opener.
boxoffice,38fuey,mrstickball,7,Wed Jun 3 22:57:55 2015 UTC,"Can't believe so many people actually think this movie is going to break $2.5 billion, $750 million domestic, and have a $250+ million opening weekend."
boxoffice,38fuey,uncheel3,5,Thu Jun 4 01:29:45 2015 UTC,A lot of people cant distinguish between what they want to happen and the reality of the situation.
boxoffice,38fuey,SethR0gen,2,Thu Jun 4 02:54:07 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people have their perception's skewed by reddit's own biases. False Consensus effect in action. Hell people thought Age of Ultron were going to break $2b very easily.
boxoffice,38fuey,Republican_Atheist,5,Thu Jun 4 12:44:55 2015 UTC,Anyone who really thinks this will make $3b+ is insane.
boxoffice,38fuey,Republican_Atheist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:38:39 2015 UTC,I'm sure people said the same about Titanic and Avatar and the original Star Wars.
boxoffice,38fuey,JakkuScavenger,7,Tue Jun 9 13:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed that I've seen any responses for $3 billion. Does anyone honestly think it has a chance? And for what? Just because it's Star Wars?  I mean, let's put this into perspective. Even if Star Wars did $700 million domestic, and $1.3 billion overseas, it would still be upwards of $800 million away from taking the #1 (unadjusted) worldwide spot.   Those numbers are so astronomically high, and incredibly hard to achieve. Simply being Star Wars is not enough to get you there. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I would say it's highly unlikely for any movie to do such business."
boxoffice,38fuey,Bugger217,5,Wed Jun 3 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"I cross-posted the link to /r/movies, so you may be seeing some fanboys mixed in to the results, FWIW."
boxoffice,38fuey,SethR0gen,6,Thu Jun 4 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"Heck I got downvoted for basically pointing out that it wouldnt break the opening weekend record that the circle jerk claimed it would. I even backed it up with links that showed the biggest december opening is still less than half of the biggest opening weekend of all time, but that didnt seem to make a difference."
boxoffice,38fuey,Republican_Atheist,5,Thu Jun 4 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, regrettably, /r/movies is full of people with poor maths skills."
boxoffice,38fuey,mrdinosaur,4,Thu Jun 4 03:00:22 2015 UTC,/r/movies cares more about hype and feels than sources and statistics. Don't worry about it bro.
boxoffice,38fuey,Republican_Atheist,3,Thu Jun 4 12:39:59 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, box office predictions are a pretty niche thing and most people have no idea how much movies actually make or why they make it. I have a lot of friends who are into movies who are also betting on 3 billion dollar gross with no idea how astronomically crazy that would be. It's just not going to happen.  Also, I think people overestimate Star Wars' international appeal. Not saying that it doesn't have a ton of it, but I would bet dollars to donuts that Star Wars is a bigger deal for the West than it is for the East. It will do gangbusters either way but my bet would be in the 1.5 billion range total worldwide if it's good. If the movie turns out to be a stinker, I'd clock it just past a billion.  That being said, stranger things have happened with the box office. But picking up a franchise that hasn't had a main film in 12 years, with that and the two previous films being slammed critically, there is going to be some growing pains, despite it being Star Wars."
boxoffice,38fuey,FartingBob,2,Thu Jun 4 18:46:29 2015 UTC,The dollar is also very strong right now which will make it harder for it to even reach $2 billion.
boxoffice,38fuey,Shruth1,2,Thu Jun 4 12:39:25 2015 UTC,"I expect Avengers 1 type totals, with a much slower opening weekend but better longevity."
boxoffice,38dkpm,popdisaster00,16,Wed Jun 3 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"Big Entourage fan here, it was a cornball of a movie but so was the series. It's exactly what I wanted from the film. I miss that show a ton. It was good to catch up with the guys again. I hope it wins the weekend box office. I would love to see another movie. Haley Joel also killed it, good to see something great come out of him."
boxoffice,38dkpm,MarvAlbertNBAjam,9,Wed Jun 3 15:31:41 2015 UTC,Glad you liked it. I doubt it'll win the weekend though - that will probably be Spy.
boxoffice,38dkpm,seperationsunday,7,Wed Jun 3 16:48:52 2015 UTC,Projections are still around $20M for Fri - Sun. So maybe we'll see something in the high $20s for Weds - Sun.
boxoffice,38dkpm,DodneyRangerfield,9,Wed Jun 3 14:59:35 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound bad at all, especially for a show that hasn't been in the cultural zeitgeist since...2006? 2007?"
boxoffice,38dkpm,mrdinosaur,6,Wed Jun 3 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not terrible. I don't know what the budget was, but that would help to know how successful the opening is. The majority of the ticket sales for this one should be domestic, right? I don't know how big Entourage ever was outside of the U.S."
boxoffice,38dkpm,kingofcrob,4,Wed Jun 3 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"Budget is supposedly 30 mil, if it comes close to that first week in the US it would be more than good enough financially. If it can hit 60 mil domestic and maybe another 40 overseas (it's going to do well on VoD as well) i think there's a decent shot at a sequel."
boxoffice,38dkpm,zmanbunke,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:51:21 2015 UTC,"If such was actually the case that sounds pretty damn good. HBO must be feeling solid and you're right, this is a prime movie for VOD, so it will make some revenue after its run.  Dunno bout international, no idea what the appeal for Entourage is outside of the states."
boxoffice,38dkpm,Pripat99,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:52:21 2015 UTC,"Dunno bout international   saw it last night at a 930 session in Sydney, Australia.  the theater was probably at 70%, plus we have a long wk end coming, so it seems like its going well here"
boxoffice,38dkpm,Mojammer,3,Fri Jun 5 01:04:46 2015 UTC,"Two million for a Tuesday is pretty good. Was it the planned release date from the trailers and announcements? Or did they push it back because it probably won't compete with summer weekend releases? I love entourage, but wasn't hyped on the movie after waiting four years and seeing the trailer. But I heard good things, and I think word of mouth will be a big deal for this movie. it might be pulling in more each day through the weekend, but probably not pushing past 25-30."
boxoffice,389qsu,hadafrewbrews,42,Tue Jun 2 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"Couple reasons:   First one was so successful that passing it was going to be hard to begin with Novelty factor was gone. First one had a lot of hype about seeing all the characters come together Word of mouth wasn't as strong Even though Avengers 1 came out 3 years ago, we've had 4 Marvel movies since (3 featuring Avengers characters) Only so much you can do. How many times has the world been in danger now? I think people already know what to expect from this movie so there wasn't as much desire to see it"
boxoffice,389qsu,BrosephSingh,9,Tue Jun 2 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"They also ""stepped backward"" with Ultron being a less formidable foe than in the first movie. Vision's outfit looked like they didn't put any time into it and it will soon be looked back upon with a ""what were they thinking?"" cloud over it. Nothing compelling about the characters even though they tried to force feed a love interest and some Hawkeye back story. And as others have said, just not that good a movie."
boxoffice,389qsu,249ba36000029bbe9749,3,Wed Jun 3 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"While I agree with some of what you said...  It's common knowledge that Vision's outfit was really accurate to the source, and most people loved it."

boxoffice,389qsu,Dani_Californication,19,Wed Jun 3 05:45:38 2015 UTC,"It wasn't as good, but it's also that it wasn't a zeitgeist-capturing, groundbreaking, must-see event like the first one was. There had never before been a superhero team up movie when the first one came out. When this one came out, it wasn't exactly old news, but the concept wasn't nearly as novel, either, and therefore didn't garner quite as much attention. Approx. $450 million, which it will likely end up with, is still a fine take, though."
boxoffice,389qsu,kayjay734,10,Tue Jun 2 22:33:58 2015 UTC,People act as if it's a failure but ending somewhere around 5th highest grossing movie of all-time cannot remotely be considered a failure.
boxoffice,389qsu,Daxtreme,37,Wed Jun 3 16:51:26 2015 UTC,It wasn't as good
boxoffice,389qsu,TheOdyssey_,15,Tue Jun 2 20:50:16 2015 UTC,It's as simple as this really. Word of mouth propels a film to great heights. AoU didn't have this because it wasn't that good. People expecting it to make $2b+ were out of their minds.
boxoffice,389qsu,DaveFincher,3,Tue Jun 2 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"Only film that had even a shadow of a chance at 2b this year is Star Wars, and that's implying it gets mad reviews and acclaim. If it's Ultron quality it'll gross around 1.5b for being decet Star Wars."
boxoffice,389qsu,TheJoshider10,0,Wed Jun 3 01:06:44 2015 UTC,"Star Wars would have to be not just good, but seriously godlike to cross 2 billion. Even though it's Star Wars, even though it's building up 40 years of fandom, we have out of 6 movies thus far 2 great ones, 1 good one, and 3 bad ones.  There are obstacles to hurdle for the 2 bill mark."

It was the culmination of this shared universe experiment and people were curious, excited to see this team come together, how will it pay off and tie all these separate movies together. It was like the Super Bowl or a season finale. It will draw in people that usually could care less about this type of thing. Avengers 2 is just another episode.                         Plus, it is getting to the point where if you haven't seen the previous films, you will not understand major plot points in the film."
boxoffice,389qsu,GoldandBlue,0,Wed Jun 3 06:16:09 2015 UTC,Not that it maters as nothing significant really happens to the main characters anyway  6 avengers go in 6 come out where are the stakesstakes  Not to mention the extra big deal of making sure people are safe. Should've gone the dark superman route and blew it up without the deus ex and leave strong headed capt america behind since I doubt he's leave and give him something heroic to so

boxoffice,389qsu,idiotdidntdoit,-3,Wed Jun 3 03:25:22 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why I never went to go see it. I only trust a very select few of my friends to tell me which movie is good and bad. We have similar tastes. Well, one of em got a chance to watch it when it released and he said that the movie is a ""no-go"". So I never saw it."
boxoffice,389qsu,danightman,0,Wed Jun 3 02:34:53 2015 UTC,"This movie is definitely a ""no-go."" It was very, very disappointing."
boxoffice,389qsu,Daniel16399,6,Mon Jun 8 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"This is just some personal conjecture from my own point of view:  Avengers is a strange beast. Each of the movies listed above was pretty unique in its own right upon the original's release. There was certainly something special about those movies that had viewers itching for the next installment. Avengers, when it released, was already entering well worn territory. There was nothing uniquely enticing about it, aside from being the ultimate culmination of previous comic book movies leading up to it. This made it novel. It was a pretty good movie, but it wasn't anything inspiring. There was nothing there to really hook viewers to see how it escalates from an already epic point, and as a result we return to a 'been there, done that' movie. Ultron is the best clear sign of comic book movie saturation, where we've seen enough of the exposition and are just ready for that magic monkey wrench to really shake things up a bit. I honestly believe Civil War will out gross Ultron- it seems exotic enough to be the type of movie to break up the ennui of comic book movie onslaught."
boxoffice,389qsu,purple_parachute_guy,5,Tue Jun 2 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"There has been a glut of superhero movies over the last few years, revenues are going to start falling off for them, and I think we saw the beginnings of that here. (Plus the poor word-of-mouth just emphasized the fact that, of the million superhero movies of the past/next few years, this one is nothing special)"
boxoffice,389qsu,HowlMoonstone183,4,Wed Jun 3 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"The reason I ask is that, usually when the first film in a hit series does surprisingly well (i.e. Pirates 1 compared to Pirates 2, Batman Begins vs. TDK, Transformers 1 vs. ROTF and subsequent releases, etc.), the second easily surpasses it.    It's the same reason Empire Strikes Back grossed less than Star Wars, and Spider-Man 2 less than Spider-Man. When the first film is an unprecedented success, there really is no room for box office growth. All of the factors that culminated in the first film's success are impossible to replicate.   I think if the movie had been better and generated more buzz and excitement post-release it would've helped. But the reason the domestic drop looks so sharp is because the bar was set so damn high. $623 million is absolutely insane."
boxoffice,389qsu,ChrisMill,3,Wed Jun 3 23:48:25 2015 UTC,Instead of looking at it as falling short of the first avengers movie I think it makes more sense to take the first as an outlier and ultron as being a step above iron man 3.
boxoffice,389qsu,Mojammer,3,Tue Jun 2 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"Something has to do with the build-up for the first one. They had their other movies building it up with the post-credit scenes for years before Avengers came. So many movies pointing to a crescendo that was going to come.  And sure enough, a crescendo it was, a culmination that peaked at $600m+ domestic, $1.5B WW movie. It was exciting and the years of waiting paid off.  But then they come and suddenly  say... ""Wait, that wasn't it guys, there's more, come back for more""  But this time there is nowhere the same hype or buildup. Sure, it has done well but just not on par with the normal growth a 2nd installment of a movie has."
boxoffice,389qsu,roth403b,3,Tue Jun 2 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"Avengers wasn't ""the first film in a hit series that does surprisingly well"". It was the sequel that blows up huge.  If you look at similar franchises, Age of Ultron is performing very similarly to the third film in each series (Matrix, Pirates, Nolan's Batman, Transformers).  This performance by Age of Ultron is really, really unsurprising. The only people surprised by this are those who blindly looked at the relationship between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and thought that Age of Ultron would have the same relationship to Avengers. It was cargo cult thinking that had no relationship to the reality of how the box office works.  If you look at the films that truly dominated at the box office (Avatar, Titanic, Avengers, Dark Knight, Star Wars), what they all have in common is repeat audience. They're films that saw large numbers of people going back to the movie theater again and again and again. Quality is obviously a factor here, but the big factor tends to be the ability to see something that has never been done before. And that's why the sequels to these movies generally can't  If you saw Avengers in 2012 and you were blown away by a team of superheroes just being fucking awesome together, the only way you could get that experience again was to go back to the theater. If you saw Age of Ultron in 2015 and wanted to see a team of superheroes just being fucking awesome together... you went home and put Avengers in your BluRay player.  What about a franchise like Lord of the Rings, which managed to show modest growth from one sequel to the next? Well, you largely achieve that be substantially growing your audience between films. (Which generally translates into the first film underachieving and finding its audience only after it left theaters. This is also helped a lot by quality, which drives people to share the movie with their friends or encourage them to see it when it comes to home video.)  Why couldn't Avengers be a film that grew its audience and saw a larger box office return? Because it was really, really clear that Avengers already represented a pretty thorough saturation of the audience interested in superhero films.  The MCU, as a franchise, is unique in the history of cinema. But in many ways Avengers was the 5th movie in the series. And by the time you reach the 5th movie in a series, you've generally reached your audience.  What would it take for Marvel to get a movie bigger than Avengers? Well, they'd have to either (a) find a way to radically increase the size of their audience; (b) deliver something so utterly unique that you can't scratch the itch it creates by watching other MCU movies at home; or (c) produce a sense of finality (as seen in the Harry Potter and, to a lesser extent, Twilight franchises).  How could they do that?  (a) Guardians of the Galaxy is, in many ways, a film very distinct from the other MCU films. If it has an audience which is, in some significant part, unique from the MCU audience, then a team-up between the Avengers and GotG could be huge.  (b) Similarly, taking the superheroes into an adventure with truly cosmic scope (instead of just another variation of ""save the world"") might do it.  (c) Maybe the death of a major, first generation character (Cap, Thor, Iron Man) would create a sense of finality. But probably not.  All of which is to say that Infinity War might be able to pull it off (if it features the GotG coming to help deal with Thanos, one of those major heroes dying, and people become invested in the idea that the payoff on the Infinity Stones represents a ""conclusion"" to the first epic arc of the MCU). But I wouldn't bet money on it."
boxoffice,389qsu,hamlet9000,4,Thu Jun 4 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"I think people understood this is a stop gap till avengers 3. Absolutely nothing of consequence happened in this one besides adding two new avengers, one of them half way through the movie.   Also there has to be a major case of super hero fatigue in the general public. This isn't anything new. We've seen this before. I think that's maybe why GotG did so well was because it was completely different from what we've seen from Marvel before."

If Avengers 2 was going to beat the original's record it would have done so regardless of a one-day disruption. Avatar got released the same weekend as a major East Coast snowstorm which depressed turnout as well, but all that happened was that people simply went to watch it in future weeks."

I am waiting to see with Ant-Man but Marvel's MCU might of peaked and might be in decline. It can't go on forever so this is no surprise.

Even though a lot of people liked it, I was put off by the creepy, doomsday, dark and gritty feel of the first trailer with the weird Pinocchio song. And that trailer did not represent the film well at all, either. I can imagine a lot of the people who loved the first Avengers because of the snappy banter, excitement, fun and thrills were a bit confused by that trailer as well, and that probably dampened enthusiasm. Also, to a much lesser extent - Joss shooting off his mouth with off-putting comments leading up to the premiere probably didn't help anything, either."

boxoffice,387lct,TheOutlier,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:03:53 2015 UTC,The best way to watch it as an adult is to watch The Phantom Edit.  It jettisons a lot of Anakin's joie de vivre and almost entirely takes that imbecilic fuck Jar Jar out of the film.  It also takes the droid chatter away.  It's a much better film.

However, when I'm at school, if date night with my girlfriend includes a movie, then that's probably the priciest situation. I'm guessing in that instance, it would be the $26 for 3D Jupiter Ascending. Note we didn't want to see the 3D showing, but it a Valentine's Day thing that we had to do on a Thursday night after classes and the only showing left was a 3D showing. Since starting work at the theater, the only films I've paid to see are (me explicitly, not anyone else paying for me) The Maze Runner, 3D Jupiter Ascending, and Insurgent. I can guarantee you The Scorch Trials will also be getting my money for our one year anniversary."

Spy is direct competition and is one of the best reviewed films of the year. (Could this be why they went for the early open?)   I'm with you on the open. Getting to 20 would be a surprise. I think they would be lucky to make back the budget, which I read was supposed to be $30M.   To each their own, but I've got no interest in this movie and I watched every episode. I only got through the last couple seasons barely and just wanted it to be over. I'm definitely over Ari.   This might have done better if a single member of the cast had done anything at all since the show. There's no cliff hanger left over from the finale to draw anyone in either."

Sorry, I just really can't stand Entourage. I expect a decent weekend pull (14-16M) and then it will likely fall off the cliff once the die-hards have seen it."

Rated R comedies don't have much overseas potential so maybe 10-30m there? IDK      The thing about Entourage is that product placement is huge which means WB most likely will spend a net of near zero on marketing (the Ari Gold cadillac ""prequel"" thing for example).  So the red they have to cover on this is pretty small.  I'd give a second movie at least a 60% shot before even seeing the box office."

boxoffice,387qpf,Dollarama,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:04:27 2015 UTC,"This film has got very little chance of doing supremely well. Compare this to twin peaks (vastly different shows, I know) which had a viewing figure high of 14.9m and It's respective film made $7m (adjusted for inflation) overall fighting against very small hitters.  On the other end of the spectrum, Sex and the City had finale viewing figure of 7.3m and it's respective film made $415m and was fighting the strangers and earlier releases of family movies (Indy V and Narina: Prince Caspian) . This film had the 'Chick Flick' factor, something that would bring in a wider audience, a large cult audience and a RT rating of 49%  Entourage had a gross audience high of 8.3m but the film has had poor reviews and is fighting Spy and Insidous 3 which is going to split the audience a fair way. There's very little to attract a new audience to entourage. The vast-majority of female audiences are unlikely to be attracted and the 'R' rating pretty much wipes out the teen audience (who were most likely to be the 'new' audience who could be attracted)  . It was never a big-hitter overseas so it's going to be relying on the Domestic Sales pretty heavily. With reviews as they are I'd say it would be lucky to pull back it's budget of $30m.   But you can never predict an avid fanbase.  I'd go for opening at $15m and just scraping its budget in the end."
boxoffice,387qpf,Xeluther,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:11:08 2015 UTC,"Cinemascore is giving it an A-, which is quite good. Actually that's ""upsetting the predictions and topping the charts over Insidious 3"" and ""Spy"" good."

Especially since both Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone have had some pretty entertaining appearances on Fallon (if you haven't seen Stone's lip sync of Blues Traveler, she kills it).   Rachel McAdams might be waiting to promote the second season of True Detective (premiers June 21st for any fans out there)."
boxoffice,385dsj,tokomini,3,Tue Jun 2 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"Genuine question: Do actors really have any say in the promotion of the film once it's complete? I thought promotion was covered in initial contracts when signing on for a film in order to prevent this sort of situation.  The way I saw it, the lack of promotion resulted from it being a smaller film and from a kind of universal recognition that it was maybe not worth promoting so much, regardless of star power. I agree with other people that the existing marketing was confused though. Also the name throws me off. Emma Stone's pretty likable, but the vibe I got from the existing marketing was kind of ""white people in Hawaii, also military""."
boxoffice,385dsj,lasersaurous,2,Tue Jun 2 10:40:07 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how much clout they have. Usually there will be some requirement to do press or TV interviews. Once you reach a certain level than you don't. There are also some actors who just refuse to do press regardless. Daniel Day Lewis and Sean Penn are examples of that. What is negotiated often beforehand is how prominent an actor is featured in marketing. Tom Cruise for example is usually the star, even if he isn't because he almost always wants top billing.              In Aloha's case, they wanted to showcase their cast because it does have an all star cast. Which ended up translating to ""pretty white people in Hawaii"", unfortunately it sounds like the movie was also just that."
boxoffice,385dsj,GoldandBlue,3,Tue Jun 2 16:38:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the movie was just so self-indulgent and just re-treaded Cameron Crowe's same themes he's repeated in his past 3-4 movies with just a different backdrop.  Crowe's movies are just paint-by-numbers ala Adam Sandler at this point."

boxoffice,385dsj,danieldavidpeterson,3,Tue Jun 2 07:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think more than anything, Aloha flopped because the studio undercut it. It was not a good film, but this is a business based on image as much as actual content. You can package any shit movie into gold if you market it the right way. It won't stay gold but you get enough suckers in the door and pick their pockets and you got yourself a winner for opening weekend. Aloha could have opened much higher than 10 million if they used interesting and innovative marketing or perhaps didn't open it at the end of May. With this star power it should have been easy. The problem is that the marketing accurately reflected the mess on screen. No one had any idea what the hell the movie was about.   On another note, Sony needed to get offs it's knees and tell Crowe recut the movie so that it was good. The leaked emails show that Crowe was left to his own devices and Sony gave him too much  autonomy. It was piss poor studio management combined with a writer director who no longer can self-edit."

Really? I saw the trailer twice, what I took away from it was that Bradley Cooper was returning to Hawaii for business reasons (military contract blah blah blah) which would force him to reunite and work with old flame, Emma Stone. Bill Murray around to say sage comic things. Is that not what it is?"
boxoffice,385dsj,KirkUnit,2,Tue Jun 2 06:37:01 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand what the strategy was for releasing what appears to be a romantic comedy but maybe is actually something else at the end of May. This is when people go to the movies for explosions, robots, and well-made animated films. It seems really strange to me that this was the release date for this movie.  The marketing was off - I don't think I saw a single television ad for Aloha. I wonder if that's because Sony knew it was terrible and therefore decided to not even waste the money trying to get people into the theaters? If that's the case, that seems like a major failure to me - even though I mention the release date issue above, right now this thing could have catered like crazy to the demographic that is underserved in the movies during the summer (those that like drama or romance) and probably cleaned up. I don't know - maybe there were television ads on channels that I don't watch but that the AARP set does."
boxoffice,385dsj,Pripat99,3,Tue Jun 2 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"It was initially set for a Christmas 2014 release, which I guess is a little better suited for the type of movie that it is, but it was pushed back to May. (I'm not 100% certain on the reasons. Something with the Sony hack maybe?) I know the studio behind it never really liked it themselves, and I'm pretty sure most people involved knew it would tank, which would explain the move from Christmas where it would have been crushed under the weight of Unbroken and Into the Woods. But... then why push it to May against so many summer blockbusters? If it just had to be released, why wasn't it released back in February or March? Even January would've been decent, and likely have pulled in more coming right off the red hot American Sniper with Bradley Cooper."

boxoffice,3818ev,GoddammitCricket,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:45:16 2015 UTC,"Spy will definitely gross more. It already had huge ""brand recognition."" Not that the film is part of a series or anything, but just that Melissa McCarthy lead comedies are a thing now. Identity Thief, The Heat, Tammy, and now Spy! All of those films have done well at the box office with all grossing at least $80 million. (Some might include Bridesmaids in this set, but there's several other major characters at work in that film, not just her's.) Good word-of-mouth is already helping as well with amazing reviews coming in from critics. (95% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 37 reviews so far!)  Not to say Trainwreck won't do well, because I think it will. It also has some nice name recognition behind it with Amy Schumer. This is her first film, though, so there's no telling just how big of a draw her name will be for the box office. It's Judd Apatow as well, who isn't exactly a huge name, but his films have done fairly well. Also, early critic reviews are having excellent showings as well. (100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews so far.)  The good thing is the two films aren't likely to hurt each other. There's 6 weeks in between their releases, more than enough time to let Spy's hype die off before Trainwreck comes in. Since both films are using their ties to Bridesmaids as part of their marketing strategy, you are more than likely to see Trainwreck as part of Spy's trailer pack. It'll be fun to watch.  Right now, I'll say $145 million for Spy and $75 million for Trainwreck."
boxoffice,3818ev,tcatron565,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:07:09 2015 UTC,"I think we have to hold off a bit since Trainwreck is still a month and a half away, so it hasn't hit peak visibility. Amy Schumer is red hot right now from her TV show and they can definitely build off of that. She's basically the ""it"" female comedian/comedy actress right now. Judd Apatow may not be what he used to be, but he still adds value. The cast is peppered with recognizable faces catering to different demographics, and it will be interesting to see them in this type of film, interacting with each other - Bill Hader, Tilda Swinton, John Cena, and LeBron James potentially coming off an NBA title victory, who I'm especially curious to see play ""LeBron James"".   Spy may come out on top because of the broader appeal of an action/comedy, but Trainwreck has the pieces to have a really strong showing."
boxoffice,37zk2u,stoicblunder,13,Sun May 31 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling it'll be in the $25-30 million range, $30-40 if it's good."
boxoffice,37zk2u,CommanderStark,11,Sun May 31 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"Last year, Get On Up (James Brown), opened at a similar time - August 1. It did a $13.5M opening and ended with about $30M.   Just for fun, let's look at the top grossing music biopic Walk the Line (Johnny Cash) which had a $22M opening for $119M gross in November 2005 (approx $26M, $144M today). Let's also consider the highest grossing rap music biopic Notorious (Notorious BIG) which opened with $20M for a $36M gross in January 2009. While the month is off, the content is similar, and it was rated R like Straight Outta Compton will be.  Get On Up and Walk the Line were PG-13.  Let's put aside, for now, the ""perfect storm"" theory of whether Straight Outta Compton could reap the benefits of societal tensions.   For a successful music biopic you need a successful artist for it to be based on. Now I like NWA, but they aren't on the same level of Johnny Cash, James Brown (or Ray Charles, as Ray is the second highest grossing music biopic) in terms of popularity. A wide range of ages and cultures listen to their music. NWA's fanbase is much more limited - their musical content doesn't carry well through all demographics, they haven't existed as long, and their time as a group was relatively short. Cash, Brown, Charles, even Notorious BIG all made music more recently than NWA has (Eazy E died in 1995). The film is already at a disadvantage. If you think that its opening will DOUBLE Walk the Line, or TRIPLE Get On Up, I respectfully disagree. Don't forget that Walk the Line also had two stars in the lead roles giving Oscar worthy performances while SOC's biggest star will be Paul Giamatti, in a supporting, most likely antagonistic role. The film will be carried by unknowns, and directed by F. Gary Gray, whose biggest opening was only $23M for Be Cool in 2005 which was LOADED with stars, and a sequel to boot.  NWA's demographic will be very similar to that for Notorious. Both are artists the top echelon of rap music. Notorious opened in January which is traditionally a dumping ground for films, and still gained a respectable $20M. Now opening in January may have helped it because a quality film amongst the trash can be appreciate more there rather than competing at a better time of the year. Still, that has to be the low water mark for Straight Outta Compton, and so HSX is undervaluing it a bit, I think. While SOC comes out in late summer, it's still summer, and so the audience is there - although it is rated R. Based on just these numbers, I'd expect SOC to do about $22M-$25M. It still has to compete with The Man from UNCLE that week and Fantastic Four in its second week.  To return to the idea that SOC could capitalize on societal tensions with racism and police (NWA did make Fuck the Police, after all), I just don't think it's going to move the needle much in itself. I don't know if this is really going to be the type of film that will bring people together in some kind of phenomenal occurrence like, as one poster put it, The Passion of the Christ. Not to downplay the achievements of NWA, but I think their story has far less potential to reverberate than the story of Jesus Christ. Even if there was a bump, I don't see SOC doing any more than $30M, and that would still be a great opening, since the film likely cost $40M-$50M."
boxoffice,37zk2u,CesareSomnambulist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic analysis. Everything you say logically makes sense, but a part of me thinks Compton is special and won't conform to these data patterns. I am definitely a gut guy but I love data as well. The data suggests SOC is not going to hit a home run, but my gut says it will. What to believe?"
boxoffice,37zk2u,CesareSomnambulist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, data really is limited and of course it can't be right all the time. But it's all we have to go off of with over two months to go. Maybe it'll catch fire once marketing ramps up, or maybe it'll get a lot of stigma attached to it with the whole Suge Knight-killed-a-guy on set thing. Universal's getting sued over it now and that looks bad for everyone. But maybe it's fitting for a movie about gangsta rap that someone gets killed.  Of course, the reviews are another factor that can have a major impact."
boxoffice,37zk2u,rpp8,6,Thu Jun 4 04:51:29 2015 UTC,"Give its competition, I'd say $20M is about right.  Positive word of mouth would be huge for this movie, leading to a strong second weekend."
boxoffice,37zk2u,wierdaaron,5,Mon Jun 1 01:32:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any data on this but I think there's a chance that this one could have a ""Passion of the Christ""-like effect that brings in an audience that doesn't go to the theater very often and makes a ton of money. The fact that the subjects of the movie are involved with it and are endorsing and even actively promoting it means that a lot of rap music lovers and music history buffs could be interested in seeing it."
boxoffice,37zk2u,GoddammitCricket,1 point,Sun May 31 23:55:37 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you that this feels like a zeitgeist film. It will hit at just the right time, maybe. I think it at least will hit 20, but the sky is the limit if it becomes a social phenomenon. It could cut either way,  but I feel this buzz with the movie so I am guessing it's going to crush it."
boxoffice,37zk2u,mardfet,4,Mon Jun 1 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"$40M opening weekend is a bit too hopeful. I know a lot of people are looking forward to it, but you have to remember - a biopic about NWA has a pretty limited audience.  I don't think this will have any connection to anything going on right now in the news/Baltimore, at least box office wise. Of course theaters in Baltimore will show it, it's a major Universal release.   All the same fears occurred when Notorious came out 6 years ago, I saw it opening weekend in Ohio and the anti-gang task force were milling about the mall that the theater was in (Easton, for anybody in Columbus). It won't have an effect on the movie's box office though.  I think Fantastic Four and American Ultra will obviously have a bit of an impact on SoC, they'll split the young male audience.  Notorious is the obvious comparison (and I'd argue Biggie is way more well known to non-hip hop fans), and that only opened to $20M before dropping pretty hard.  I can see Compton opening in the high 20s, and topping out around $80M. Depends on how the reviews are, that'll drive people who'd otherwise wouldn't be interested if it gets rave reviews. If it ends up not being a good movie, it'll probably have the same total around Notorious' $40M or so."
boxoffice,37zk2u,HobbieK,3,Mon Jun 1 03:22:53 2015 UTC,I think it'll have a very solid ($30M+) opening and then burn out very quickly. Seems like it's going for a fanbase that's very underappreciated by most movies that will likely turn out in droves for this.
boxoffice,37zk2u,mrstickball,2,Mon Jun 1 04:36:37 2015 UTC,Music Movies don't make the kind of money you are talking about.   http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?view=main&id=musicbio.htm&p=.htm  I don't think Black Audiences are going to riot because they saw a movie.
boxoffice,37zk2u,stealthtiger3,2,Mon Jun 1 15:20:54 2015 UTC,Given the subject matter... $25m / $100m total. Extremely good run for that type of movie. I don't think a music documentary has ever done that well.

I worked the box office yesterday and this older woman came in to see what movies we were playing, so I gave her a list of movies that shows the schedule for the entire week. She saw Entourage and asked if that was the Bradley Cooper movie. I told her no, that is Aloha she is thinking of, and she got all excited and exclaimed how good he was in American Sniper, and immediately bought a ticket."

boxoffice,37z7cs,k5therobot,3,Sun May 31 21:17:27 2015 UTC,"Mad Max and Pitch Perfect were business as usual, falling to $13M and $14M respectively. Mad Max is still heavily relying on its excellent word of mouth to a very strong $115M total so far, and should be able to top $130M before the end of its run.   I think it should be noted that Pitch Perfect 2 is also riding a huge wave of great word of mouth, barreling past $150M soon. More than doubling the box office of the original, it's near impossible Universal doesn't commission a third one."
boxoffice,37z7cs,accessgranter,2,Mon Jun 1 04:20:29 2015 UTC,Appreciate the effort dude.  I wasn't hoping San Andreas to do this good considering The Rock's last solo 'Hercules' really underperformed .

boxoffice,37yqc0,BatmanDavey1986,5,Sun May 31 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"I copped the brunt of the TomorrowLand salvage operation - they carpet bombed YouTube with 30 second ads that tried to tell you what the movie is actually about.  I saw that trailer about 10 times as it popped up before every video and didn't have a skip option.    Clooney VoiceOver ""the future is in trouble""  House MD dressed in a redicuous outfit standing in what looks like a set from spy kids 3 - ""he thinks you can save the future""  Clooney again ""you wanted to see Tomorrowland, well here it comes"".  It dropped a reasonable % second weekend but it's a drop from a disappointing base.  I think the success of San Andreas on a much lower budget is a lesson for Tomorrowland.  If you have a CGI driven blockbuster it needs to come across as epic.  Also I've seen every TL trailer now and not seen one joke.  Seems like the movie takes itself too seriously."
boxoffice,37yqc0,PointOfFingers,4,Sun May 31 22:47:47 2015 UTC,"Very impressive opening for San Andreas - quite a bit more than I expected. The Rock, plus massive CG-destruction is clearly a potent combination."
boxoffice,37yqc0,mrstickball,3,Sun May 31 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"San Andreas - wow. Between this and JP4 its the 90s again. Wonder what next week will look like. Could hit $150m domestic which would be crazy.  Tomorrowland - abject failure. Near-60% drop for a kids movie is baaad. Barely beats PP2.. insane.  PP2 - continuing a very good run. Aloha didnt put a dent in it. I thought it'd hurt it more. Will end north of $175 m. Not likely to hit $200m unless it gets a crazy dollar theater run.  MMFR - another good drop. $150m is a lock. Will be very interesting if it ever makes it to China, as South Korea is loving this movie. I wonder if it could do $75m or more there.  AoU - a good drop, and it beats Aloha! Looks like it may hit $450m in the US. Good legs toward the end.  Aloha - its success is stated in tne namesake. Wow. What's bad is the estimates prior to the end of week... down 20-30% from estimates. Terrible."

boxoffice,37yqc0,Pripat99,7,Sun May 31 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"Aww come on man - you were calling for 70-90 million a week ago! 40 million prediction was off (clearly - and I was one of the ones calling for that) and this did much better than those predictions, but this is a hard business to make good predictions in, especially for original-ish content like this."
boxoffice,37yqc0,stoicblunder,3,Sun May 31 16:17:55 2015 UTC,"Haha that was wishful thinking on my part. But 40 was way too low for a film like this, and a lot of people were saying mid to high 30s. It's certainly hard to predict. I really did think this would have a 70+ opening, and I think it should have been. There is no reason a huge disaster movie like this with one of the biggest and hottest stars should not crack a 75 mil opening. People loved it as well. So that tells me the marketing was off. It did feel a little bland. In any event I am glad it did well, but I think this is still underperforming to its potential."
boxoffice,37yqc0,Pripat99,4,Sun May 31 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"I think the thing is it didn't have a solid new hook to bring in audiences. People have seen disaster movies a thousand times before, and so you need a real new twist in order to get people to come. Take a look at 2012 - part of the reason I suspect that did so well is because it was based off of a popular Mayan myth and that made it connect more with the popcorn set. Same thing for Day After Tomorrow - everyone has heard about global warming, but what could a disaster from it look like? This didn't have anything like that, it was a by the numbers disaster film. Well liked actor saves family amidst total destruction - that storyline has been done again and again.  Just my two cents. I think it'll continue to clean up though, no real competition in its genre for two weeks when Jurassic World comes out. Spy is going to surprise people I think, but it's clearly looking to attract a different audience than this."
boxoffice,37zi09,jiangsen,7,Sun May 31 18:46:27 2015 UTC,The no China release is really holding MM:FR back.

A big reason Bollywood (India's Hollywood equivalent) is able to do well domestically because it got big decades before the advent of lots of US films being exported."
boxoffice,380hip,IndyBrodaSolo,13,Sun May 31 23:07:19 2015 UTC,Nope. Each Terminator has made way less than the last one and there's way too much competition. The only people who would see it are fans of the series and all the fan reaction has been awful. I only see this doing $70-$90M.
boxoffice,380hip,mardfet,-1,Mon Jun 1 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"Each Terminator has made way less than the last one   Other than the fact that all the sequels made substantially more than the original. Though you are absolutely right that the franchise has been trending down, only it with started Judgement Day.  I think Schwarzenegger having a major role in Genisys will be enough to get it over $100 million, but I'm not sure by how much."
boxoffice,380hip,Dorkside,6,Mon Jun 1 05:35:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure if we can really call Schwarzenegger a box office draw anymore. Guy has had nigh on four flops in a row in movies he's headlined. Then again none of those films had him in his signature role so maybe he could spring a surprise.  Either way, I still think this film faces an uphill battle. Coverage had been almost universally negative with every reveal and I'd be absolutely shocked if this got better reviews than any previous Terminator film (and that includes the Christian Bale one)."

boxoffice,380hip,mrstickball,6,Sun May 31 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping Mad Max brings about a new trend of rated R action flicks, especially when it comes to sequels and reboots.

Nobody wants this movie, and I think people will opt for Ted 2/SelfLess instead of the same story being rehashed.   Seeing Arnold embarrass himself spouting his old catchphrases inspires groans instead of excitement.  Plus, even if it was a hit, it wouldn't be a sleeper.

boxoffice,37upem,NeilPoonHandler,32,Sat May 30 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"You gotta remember that real disaster movies peaked in the mid 90s and then went away right after 9/11 for obvious reasons. There is a whole generation of people 25 and younger who didn't rally partake in the disaster flick bonanza back then. They didn't see Dante's Peak and then Volcano the theaters. What I think is happening is culture is swinging back to the mid 90s. You have a new Jurassic Park, new Independence Day next year. Disaster flicks are great 4 quadrants movies, and they can make a ton of money if done right. I think the audiences are going to start having comic book fatigue very soon, and the well will dry up really fast. My guess is that disaster flicks will,come back big to,fill the void."
boxoffice,37upem,stoicblunder,8,Sat May 30 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"I think what you're saying about Jurassic Park and Independence Day speaks more to the fact that Hollywood never found a franchise they didn't want to blow the dust off of and try to bring it back. It's all about capitalizing on nostalgia, and Universal is about to do that in a big way with Jurassic World.  There's been disaster movies since 9/11, even of the same ilk as San Andreas - Day After Tomorrow, 2012, Into the Storm come to mind just off the top of my head. You're always going to have people love watching the world explode. I don't think it's necessarily a genre where you're going to see multiple movies like it every season, but once or twice a year definitely seems to be a possibility.  A good test for your theory that comic book fatigue is going to start soon would be Ant-Man. I'm still kind of in disbelief that they decided to make this to begin with, it's not a well known character, he doesn't have incredible powers or anything - it seems to me to be tailor made for comic book enthusiasts but not for the general public."
boxoffice,37upem,Pripat99,1 point,Sat May 30 16:43:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I agree with you that JP and ID are essentially just reboots, but the timing is important. I noticed that JP, the original, started to get really cool again with twenty somethings about 2 years ago. It's the rule of 20 years cool, if it happened 20 years then there is a good chance it will be cool today amongst the young folks. The industry is picking up on this and that is why Independence Day 2 probably got greenlit. They had 20 years to make a sequel, but they are choosing to do it now. Movie studios are putting most of their chips into tentpole blockbusters, and I think disaster flicks fit well into that model. It's a pretty easy formula: strong male lead (big star), attractive female (doesn't have to be big star just really attractive), absurd disaster (comet, earthquake, aliens), nerd sidekick, $$$.  To be honest, I have been sick of comic books movies since the mid 00s, so I am imagine I am projecting a bit. That being said, Ant-Man makes no sense to me nor does Paul Rudd as a lead. Also, the director is essentially a hack. He directed the Break-Up, which was a bottom of barrel romcom. Edgar Wright who has a lot of chops and had be instrumental to the film being made, left due to creative difference. There were a ton of rewrites on the script. Everything tells me it is going to be a really shitty movie, but the fan boys don't care. This is why I think there is comic book movie bubble.  You have a set audience that will see any Marvel or DC movie. So the buzz and the box office are inflated compared to the actual general interest in the films. The moment the general public gets sick of these films it will be a free fall. It will start out with one or two comic book movies under-performing. They will say it was bad writing or directing or a misstep. Then two will become 3, and the bottom will fall out. Studios will start slashing future projects left and right, they are very reactionary. That is how I see it happening, but it wouldn't be the first time I am wrong. Ant-man could be the first shoe to drop."
boxoffice,37upem,stoicblunder,3,Sat May 30 19:18:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's a ""20 years cool"" thing or a ""let's bring back stuff that's pretty old because the 40 somethings will feel nostalgic for it and the teens will just like stuff being blown up"", but Hollywood does love a proven winner no matter how old it is. Take a look at Red Dawn, Karate Kid, Total Recall, RoboCop, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Amityville Horror, Planet of the Apes...the list goes on and on. Moviemaking, especially blockbuster moviemaking, comes with enormous financial risk, and studios would always rather bring something back that's already made it at the box office than try something new. And if it's old enough, then people won't feel the same fatigue that they once did for the franchise.  I would agree that disaster movies in general would fit into a simple formula for Hollywood - doesn't need to actually be good (heck, look at San Andreas on RT - clearly doesn't matter that the critics think it's a bad movie) so long as it has a likeable lead and stuff blowing up. 16 year olds don't care about dialogue or acting - they like destruction! And the older crowd will go for the action and not care a whit about story. I do think though that it's the sort of thing that can lead to too much saturation, though I would've said the same thing about comic book movies a couple years ago (seriously, how did Thor of all comic book characters carry not one film, not two films, but now apparently a damn trilogy?).  I have been eyeing Ant-Man for awhile now as a bridge too far on the comic book subject. I admittedly am very familiar with DC Comics and not as much with Marvel, but I have a passable understanding of most of the Marvel Universe, and I can't get even a little bit excited for this one. I think Paul Rudd as an action hero is an interesting choice as well, and Peyton Reed is an even more weird selection to helm. I think that it will tank, but like I said, comic book movies have constantly surprised me on this (Kenneth Branagh, who was known for Shakespeare, directed Thor - SERIOUSLY).  I don't think the core Avengers, the various Batman and Superman, etc. franchises are in danger at all. Those are extremely popular and will remain so. But the random offshoots (Gambit? Deadpool? Black Panther?) at some point have to come up dry, right?"

boxoffice,37upem,FunandFailure,1 point,Sat May 30 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"All good points. So let me be more specific. I meant to say disaster flicks flourished from 96-98. Look as this run: Twister 5/10/1996, Independence Day 7/3/1996, Daylight 12/6/1996, Dante's Peak 2/7/1997, Volcano 4/25/1997, Titanic 12/19/1997, Firestorm 1/9/1998, Deep Impact 5/8/1998, Godzilla 5/20/1998, Armageddon 7/1/1998  Then radio silence til Perfect Storm in 2000 and then nothing until The Core(bombed) in 2003. Day After Tomorrow in 2004, War of the Worlds 2005, Poseidon 2006, total radio silence for 3 years until the movie 2012 in 2009. And then they started trickling back into stlye a couple years ago with WWZ, Godzilla, Into Storm, Olympus.  So disaster movies have always been here, but there was frenzy of them in the mid to late 90s. That period compared to the following 17 years is very different."
boxoffice,37upem,stoicblunder,1 point,Sat May 30 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"I think 9/11 had a significant amount to do with it, plus comic book movies came into vogue, along with fantasy like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings eating the money otherwise used for disaster movies.   Also, I count Jurassic Park as a disaster movie, though a much smaller scale than the others. I kind of think that was the spark that started the huge resurgence of disaster movies in the 90s, plus telling everyone that the technology was there to make the impossible possible, and though expensive, there was money to be made. I'm pretty sure JP's reign as the highest grossing film of all time led to a lot of those movies getting greenlit, including Titanic. I also think it inspired George Lucas to revisit Star Wars with the new technology, but that's neither here nor there. Basically, Jurassic Park was a disaster movie and kind of a big deal."
boxoffice,37upem,ncuday,2,Sun May 31 00:43:48 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Pretty interesting that Volcano and Dante's Peak were able to survive at the same time. Ditto for Armageddon and Deep Impact in 1998. The potential for a new generation to experience this genre is there.
boxoffice,37upem,CesareSomnambulist,2,Sat May 30 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"Oh man, it was nuts back then. I remember seeing all these in the theater. All were packed, except Volcano. There is something very specific about the genre that makes the films very enjoyable. It's like watching a group of real people go through a struggle and survive. They are really positive movies at the end of the day and a lot of fun. Since they take place in the ""real world"" instead of a clearly fictional one, disasters movies have a sense of authenticity which Avengers clearly doesn't. Even if the movie is absurd, the characters are normal people which helps audience connect with them."

boxoffice,37upem,BlueTeamTV,3,Sat May 30 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the bottom will drop out of the whole genre. I have been a movie nerd since the mid 90s, so I saw the comic book phenomenon develop and then take off. Comic books movies have always been around but they didn't really started to take off as a box office bonanza until X-Men in 2000 and then Spiderman in 2002. Those two films changed the game. It has been crazy every since then.  It doesn't feel like it could end because they are still making huge bucks, but I think it peaked with the original Avengers at over 600 million domestic. The sequel won't come close to that. My guess is that Ant-Man and F4 will underperform this summer. Batman vs Super will be huge next year and X-Men Apocalypse may be the last epic one for awhile. 2017 has no less than 8 comic book movies scheduled. My gut says that is where the slashing begins. If FF4 under-performs this summer, it is gone for 2017.  Look I am more than half full of shit, I will admit that, but the movie business is a fickle beast. My guess is that a new genre emerges that overtakes the popularity of comic books movies and the genre will collapse for a decade or so or more."

They had large production budgets and lost money.   If you take a list of the biggest disaster movies 5 were in the 90s and 5 were in the last 10 years. It is true that 4 from the 90s were huge with ID4, Titanic, Armageddon, and Twister. However there are really only about 10 to 12 true disaster movies to reach 100 million so I don't think any Era really has been the age of the disaster movie."

boxoffice,37rq1q,elmatador12,3,Sat May 30 05:46:18 2015 UTC,I'm astonished that Aloha will open to double digits. I guess old people haven't had anything to see since Age of Adaline.
boxoffice,37rq1q,RichHomieCK,8,Fri May 29 21:21:25 2015 UTC,"That's precisely it - Aloha caters to a demographic that is very underserved at the box office right now. It's not just seniors, but anyone looking for anything remotely of the romantic strain is going to have no where to go but Aloha. Bradley Cooper, Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone in a tropical paradise - who cares if the reviews make it sound terrible? Date movie to be sure.  But hey, I say this as a guy who took his then girlfriend and now wife to see Ben Stiller's The Heartbreak Kid for our first movie in a theater together, so maybe I'm biased towards awful, terrible movies that look like date movies."

boxoffice,37rq1q,GoldandBlue,3,Fri May 29 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"Surprised as well by Aloha, but I think the low-balling was a little Potomac Fever by insiders who consider the film toxic waste and wont't go near it.

They can carry a film for a while, though most of them skip right on by the concession stand I've noticed. :p We had Jersey Boys for so long because the older demographic just kept coming to it.  Speaking of the old demographic, we can also tell when comedies have about run their course when the demographic shifts to the older crowd. It never fails. Never. The sooner the old folks come in for the comedy, the shorter we have the film. We got rid of Hot Pursuit this week, but only had one showing per day last week. Nothing but old people. Mark my words, Pitch Perfect 2 will start pulling in the old crowd within the next few weeks with Spy releasing.  And, yes, Aloha was filled with old people today and even at last night's premiere."
boxoffice,37qs3v,Dorkside,14,Fri May 29 17:26:33 2015 UTC,"For comparison's sake, Mad Max brought in 3.7 million on its Thursday night opening, and while it isn't the best comparison (since Max is a franchise, this is original, Max is R, this is Pg-13), I still think the demographic for the two movies is probably similar, so it's at least a bit helpful as a sign post. If we assume the two films follow a similar trajectory, that would put San Andreas in line for the $40 million opening that most have predicted."
boxoffice,37qs3v,Pripat99,6,Fri May 29 18:34:44 2015 UTC,I was looking at past Thursday previews and they look at over the place. It does seem to indicate SA will hit at least high 30s.

boxoffice,37qs3v,stoicblunder,3,Fri May 29 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"We'll have a better feel for it when the Friday estimates come in later this evening. I think the 50s would have Warner Bros. over the moon, but I think the high 30s, low 40s is a more reasonable estimate. I just don't think the Rock has the wattage to get to 50s at this point in his career, but this will certainly be the test of that hypothesis. Outside of the Fast and Furious franchise (which I think we can agree the Rock helped but doesn't carry) he has never starred in a movie that grossed higher than $40.5 for its opening."
boxoffice,37qs3v,Pripat99,6,Fri May 29 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"Nice breakdown, though I don't think San Andreas has the same strong word of mouth as Fury Road so that might hurt the movie on Saturday and Sunday."

Awesome staff, food prices are pretty reasonable compared to theaters.    Plus I just like the ambiance.  It's about 2 miles from Lake Erie. So in the evening you get a cool breeze that comes off the lake. There is a national park behind it, so the air always smells fresh and highlighted by local flowers/trees (especially this time of year).  There are two fields in front of each screen.

Japan has their own form of entertainment and unlike say China---they don't need US films as much,  if that makes sense.  I'd bet $35-$45 million.

One film when they are releasing 2 a year is a not a sign of much and is certainly not evidence of a pattern at all. Now if Ant-Man disappoints then it would start to ring warning bells that Marvel has tapped out.  B) Beyond the box office numbers it was just not a very good movie. It was the worst received Marvel film since the 1st Captain America.  C) The box office in many foreign nations (cough China cough) is larger than it was 3 years ago, more theaters are 3d capable (higher ticket prices), and Marvel's films in 2013-2014 were VERY well received so AuO should of at least gotten to $1.8 billion or more looking at A1's performance.  D) The film is going to end up nearly $200 LESS in the US than A1. That is a lot of money. Beyond anything the US numbers are extremely disappointing.  E) China's box office explosion is the only thing saving AuO from being a pretty big damn big disappointment but as I have told people before---Studio's make VERY little money from China box office.   China is a pretty much assholes and they take of 75% of every dollar a foreign film makes right off the bat.  If you gave a Studio a choice of A) $400 US and $225 China B) $500 US and $0 China   They would take B EVERY SINGLE TIME."

And of course, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, Doctor strange can be good.   B) Beyond the box office numbers it was just not a very good movie. It was the worst received Marvel film since the 1st Captain America.   I don't agree with that. It wasn't the worst received since Captain America. Thor The Dark World was. AOU is at least in top 5 Marvel films ever with The Winter Soldier, Guardians, Avengers and Iron Man.  The only reason it is going to end up making less than The first Avengers and in the US is because of competition. The opening weekend had Mayweather and Pacquiao fight. Then Mad Max and Pitch Perfect came along and now we have Tomorrowland, San Andreas and Aloha."
boxoffice,37q8im,bluecamel2015,0,Sun May 31 06:11:39 2015 UTC,The only reason it is going to end up making less than The first Avengers and in the US is because of competition.    No it is going to make less because it was not well received. Sorry everybody is different and YOU personally might of liked it but the film as not well received by critics or fans.
boxoffice,37q8im,bluecamel2015,1 point,Sun May 31 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 75% implying that 3/4 critics liked it and Imdb has a score of 8/10. Maybe, some people thought it wasn't good but it only affected 10% of its amount, there is no denying that if there weren't other films, especially mad-max, it could have easily exceeded it's prequel's box-office money."
boxoffice,37q8im,bluecamel2015,2,Sun May 31 17:01:06 2015 UTC,Rotten Tomatoes is a binary. It allows critics to pick 'rotten' or 'fresh' So it is not an actual metric of likability.  Also RT is a small sampling of critics.  AuO is simply not well liked by movie goers and especially in the US.  Sorry this is not up for debate. You can PERSONALLY like it but it has nothing to do with how well a film is being received. I hate the F&F films. Can't get through 20 minutes but people love them.
boxoffice,37q8im,bluecamel2015,1 point,Sun May 31 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Avengers is better than F7 on every level but ending of furious 7 was emotional which tricked people into thinking it was a good movie. It earned well in U.S and reached 1.5 billion because of good word and no competition and of course Paul Walker. If Mad-Max and pitch perfect had been released in April, I see it earning just as much as AOU has earned.   As I said, AOU's word of mouth has affected only 10% of its earning and no doubt Mad-Max is better than it that's why many people chose to see it instead of AOU. There is no way of knowing how many people in US liked it because we both don't know everyone, maybe people you know didn't like it and people I know thought it was better than the first, but my claims are at least supported by IMDb and rotten tomatoes.  Edit: Added a few lines."

boxoffice,37mtz8,PointOfFingers,4,Fri May 29 03:36:53 2015 UTC,Mad Max had a few years of delays which may have contributed to the final budget - they built the sets and cars in Australia and then when it rained and the desert stayed green for a year they shipped everything to Africa.    After they did a test screening the studio chipped in extra money to make some of the set pieces more impressive - so they knew they were on to something good.

boxoffice,37ni63,GoddammitCricket,1 point,Fri May 29 02:12:00 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. I can see it opening to about $8M to match its 8% on RT.  Bad marketing, bad reviews. The stars likely won't save this one."
boxoffice,37ni63,CesareSomnambulist,2,Fri May 29 15:53:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can see Aloha opening in single digits - it was tracking for a mid to high teens debut earlier in the week but everyone is revising their forecasts downward after the awful reviews. It's not going to make any money overseas either as the US/Canada release is much earlier than its release in major international markets - negative buzz will have long killed it by then. Given it cost $40M to produce I can't see it coming close to breaking even.  San Andreas seems to be tracking for about a $40M debut. It has mixed reviews but these big budget disaster flicks often perform well, despite mixed reviews (The Day After Tomorrow, and Armageddon come to mind)."
boxoffice,37ni63,ItalianRicePie,2,Fri May 29 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"I agree that Aloha will not do well at all at the box office, but I could see a $10 million opening, only because the genre it's in addresses a demographic that turns out that kind of opening despite terrible reviews - the romantic drama.  To give you an example, let's look at The Best of Me, a recent movie that was absolutely scorched by the critics to the same tune as Aloha (8% on RT). Despite that, The Best of Me still opened to $10 million. Given that Aloha comes from a beloved director, I could definitely see it getting to the $10 million mark.  But at the end of the day, you are correct in that I think it'll be a tough road to hoe for Sony to break even on this one. I would say they've got somewhat of a shot because I have to imagine the marketing budget on this one is slim (has anyone even seen a TV ad for Aloha?), but I think it will be a challenge to get there.  I agree with your thoughts on San Andreas. $35-40 million sounds right to me (though as I've said elsewhere, if it went much bigger than that I wouldn't be completely surprised). I look forward to it as a big test of the Rock's drawing power."

boxoffice,37nkm3,IndyBrodaSolo,3,Thu May 28 23:17:03 2015 UTC,"In the regard of attendance it might increase slightly worldwide because, as you said , to the increase of living standards. Domestically it will probibly further decrease due to more option for entertainment with virtual reality and technological advancements. Even avatar is only ranked #14 and avengers 1 at #26 or something if adjusted to inflation which reflects the ticket prices. Granted movies back in the day did play for much longer but the decline to the movie is allready evident in the 21st century.  From a boxoffice standpoint, inflation can only be fought off for so long. Worldwide markets will start to explode like the Chinese market is and records will start to tumble. (Expect avatars 2.7 billion might take 10 or more years). Domestically since 1950 the record for highest grossing film has been held by the original star wars for the longest duration of time (1977-1997) 20 years or so. Avatar currently is at 6 years and allready under slight threat of being surpassed by the new star wars 7 movie. This goes to show no matter how phenomenonal and unbreakable a record may seem records will keep toppling and eventually movies like avatar and avenegrs which seemed like a once in a lifetime experiance might be forgotten. these are my 2 cents on the future of the boxoffice"

boxoffice,37mgpk,SethR0gen,6,Thu May 28 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"True. But I'd argue for people who were mildly interested in the movie it might have been a turn off to see that big ""rotten"" symbol next to its name. At least that was the case for me - I like Clooney and Brad Bird but seeing that it's rotten is making me wait for it to show up on TV and save $12."
boxoffice,37mgpk,bennihana123,3,Thu May 28 21:33:32 2015 UTC,Hollywood should realise that every franchise is built out of at least one critically acclaimed and universally loved movie.
boxoffice,37mgpk,jburd22,25,Thu May 28 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"Stars like Johnson get fans excited enough to actually go to the movies.   I stopped reading there.  Besides, Clooney isn't the major factor why Tomorrowland is failing. I saw the movie. Clooney is good in it.  The biggest problem is that the trailer seemed to promise that you were going to see a Disneyland-esque city come to life. (After all, it is named after one of Disneyland's ""lands."")  But the movie never had that ""magical"" tone. In fact, the film itself calls the trailer a ""commercial."" Instead of a futuristic and magical city, we get doom and gloom.   For that reason, it's easy to see why word-of-mouth is killing this movie."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Daniel16399,14,Thu May 28 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"I do think the Rock's presence in films is a large draw to the ones he's in, but I don't think that really has anything to do with George Clooney, as you said."
boxoffice,37mgpk,accessgranter,3,Thu May 28 18:52:33 2015 UTC,I thought it was like a steam punk futuristic utopia. I'm so confused about this movie now and honestly I'm questioning if I'm ever gonna watch it.
boxoffice,37mgpk,fitzjack,2,Thu May 28 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"Wow that trailer really failed miserably at giving me an idea of what to expect. I have a date coming up so I've narrowed it down between that, Age of Ultron again if it's still playing here, or Mad Max. She's pretty interested in Mad Max so I may stick with it so she doesn't get disappointed."
boxoffice,37mgpk,fitzjack,7,Thu May 28 21:48:01 2015 UTC,"I do spot a certain irony in praising The Rock (who I like, seems affable enough) for his flop that still grossed $73 million domestic while simultaneously denigrating Clooney for Tomorrowland which will certainly gross more than that."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Pripat99,1 point,Thu May 28 21:54:27 2015 UTC,The difference is that Hercules was a mild success on the back of the Rock. With anyone else it would have been a huge flop.
boxoffice,37mgpk,jadamsmash,1 point,Thu May 28 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"Well the real difference (and why it's truly an apples to oranges comparison) is that Clooney is not the star of Tomorrowland and The Rock was the star of Hercules. It's hard to say whether Tomorrowland would've been a flop with someone other than Clooney because he isn't truly carrying the film even if the marketing would make it look like he did. I would think not having Clooney would've hurt more than helped because I'm sure some did go see it because of him (even if it was because they were misled to believe that he was the star of the movie).  I just don't think that right now you can say The Rock is a more bankable star than Clooney. They do completely different films in completely different genres, and so this kind of argument is a pretty disingenuous one to make (but hey, it's the NY Post, so what do you expect). Would Up in the Air or The Descendants have been a hit if The Rock had been the star instead? Would Hercules or GI Joe: Retaliation have been hits with George Clooney in there instead of The Rock? You can see why it's a hilariously ridiculous comparison to make."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Pripat99,6,Thu May 28 20:57:28 2015 UTC,I disagree with this article for the simple reason that George Clooney was never the reason that his movies flopped. It's generally because of bad writing and directing.
boxoffice,37mgpk,Davish9,1 point,Sat May 30 18:26:09 2015 UTC,But the point of the article was to point out that even the Rock's terrible movies still make more money than most of Clooney's.
boxoffice,37mgpk,mythmaster,5,Sat May 30 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"True, but that has more to do with the type of movies that each actor is suited for than it does with Clooney's shortcomings as an actor.  The Rock is cast in action movies. George Clooney is cast in dramas. Action movies make more than dramas, especially worldwide."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Davish9,2,Thu May 28 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"It's really as simple as that.   The writer seems to be equating acting ability and profitability at times.  Clooney isn't the greatest actor ever but he will choose and create projects far more interesting than 'the Rock's' and those tend to draw less people.  The Rock is entertaining. But he could never pull off most roles Clooney does, often vice versa aswell, Clooney shouldn't really be measured by that standard atall."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Mostly-Sometimez,6,Thu May 28 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I for one quite enjoyed ""Tomorrowland"". I wish Hollywood would take more chances on ideas like this one.

boxoffice,37mgpk,JonPaula,3,Thu May 28 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"Well, duh. He's not trying to be. It's not like Tomorrowland could count on riding the blockbuster crowd-pleasing wave from Monuments Men or the Ides of March.  ""Regular"" Disney has been trying unsuccessfully to launch a winning franchise since POTC. There's a point when you have to stop looking the failures individually and start looking at the people in charge."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Go_Arachnid_Laser,2,Sun May 31 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think Tomorrowland was ever envisioned as a franchise. From the content, it seems pretty clear this was always intended to be a standalone film.  I doubt ""Regular"" Disney really needs to launch a winning franchise when they have Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, not to mention a Frozen sequel on the horizon. As of right now they have the top market share of the box office among the studios in 2015, and I don't think Disney will finish lower than second when they have two Pixar movies, the first of a new Star Wars trilogy, and Ant-Man on the way.  edit: Now as I look at it, Universal may very well catch Disney with Minions, Ted 2, Jurassic World, and a slew of smaller offerings. The point still remains - Disney isn't at a loss for franchises."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Pripat99,2,Thu May 28 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"""Disney"" in general? No. But the executives at Marvel, the ones at Pixar, and the ones at ""regular"" Disney are not the same people. And ""regular"" Disney executives have been seriously trying hard to start up a franchise with turkeys like John Carter and Lone Ranger.   I mean, those happened. Not making them up. Clearly they do want a non-Marvel, non-Pixar franchise."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Go_Arachnid_Laser,2,Thu May 28 22:04:44 2015 UTC,"Of course they happened. You can always use more franchises if you can get them. My point was that Disney isn't hurting in the slightest because of those failures.  As for what you say in terms of accountability, Rich Ross, the studio head who greenlit Lone Ranger and John Carter? He was already fired by the time Lone Ranger was released. So I guess Disney has already done what you've suggested and looked at the people in charge for those failures. Tomorrowland has nothing whatsoever to do with that, since as I said it was never going to be a franchise of any sort."
boxoffice,37mgpk,Pripat99,1 point,Thu May 28 23:00:24 2015 UTC,Besides Tomorrowland is nowhere near the financial failure John Carter and The Lone Ranger were.

He wasn't the big draw like other big directors.   Before Avengers they had a sneak peak of Tomorrowland, with Brad Bird giving an introduction, but you could feel none of the audience knew who he was."
boxoffice,37mgpk,DroogyParade,6,Sun May 31 16:38:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard to argue with this point right now, but I doubt that Hollywood is really considering Brad Bird to be a major box office draw. I think there is a cult for Brad Bird that is loud and enthusiastic, but it's by no means a large group.  As for your point that all his films have been with established franchises/companies, that's certainly true. He's got two Pixar films (Ratatouille and Incredibles) one Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol) and The Iron Giant in addition to Tomorrowland. I would point out, however, that Incredibles is one of the higher grossing Pixar films (fifth, and two of those above it are sequels) and that Ghost Protocol is second grossing in the MP franchise (which is no mean feat when it had been on hiatus for five years prior). And hey, Ratatouille is literally a film about a rat cooking in a French restaurant, and it still grossed over $200 million!  I do agree with the larger point that right now he's not a bankable director on the order of Spielberg or Bay or whatnot. But I think he has room for growth, and just because of one miss with Tomorrowland (which may have been in part because of some questionable marketing from Disney) I wouldn't write him off yet."

Sure, he's the only director to have ever done that (twice, when not adjusted for inflation), which is impressive, but that doesn't make him a god among gods, which all leads back again to the subjectivity of it all.  I'll give you a bad James Cameron film. Avatar. It's a visual marvel, yes. A technical masterpiece, sure.

If anyone can make a better sequel, it's Cameron (especially when the bar is so low in my eyes), as he's made two of my favorite sequels ever, but just because a man tells me I'm gonna shit my pants and says his movie is gonna be bitchin' simply doesn't make it so. I don't care who you are, if you're making a movie, you're gonna pimp it out as hard as you can.  And no, I won't feel stupid when I see Avatar 2. Doesn't matter where he's filming it. He could go to the moon, and that wouldn't automatically make it the greatest film of all time. It has to be more than going places we haven't seen before, it's about making a good movie, or in this case, movies. And that is never ever guaranteed.  If he makes a great movie, awesome. He's done it before, and I'm sure he'll do it again, even if the Avatar sequels are garbage.

I do agree that the MCU is too much of a mess now (it's so dense, every single image has so many things going on) but I would bet everything that Avatar 2 doesn't outgross the original no matter how good it is because people saw Avatar for the effects, not the story.

Avatars opening had it in like 4K theaters whereas back then it was a few dozen at a time, roadshow style basically so even though it was in theaters much longer, that's just how it worked. I'm sure worldwide many movies have out grossed Avatar if you count the final grosses. Plus Avatar DID get a rerelease only a few months after it came out if you remember."

boxoffice,37ipmt,theonewhoknocknocks,29,Wed May 27 22:39:33 2015 UTC,Know I complained about the commercial in the past. But I went to see it TWICE.   Bad ass movie :)
boxoffice,37ipmt,DeepRoast,6,Wed May 27 23:35:08 2015 UTC,I would go to see Mad Max for third time. This movie is so damn good
boxoffice,37ipmt,Mozardd,3,Thu May 28 02:33:28 2015 UTC,I am also going to rewatch mad max the next quiet weekend that comes up.   I feel like mad max has to have some long legs with all the people claiming they rewatched it.
boxoffice,37ipmt,SpinkickFolly,15,Thu May 28 17:46:52 2015 UTC,I feel like mad max will somehow pull out #2 this week due to word of mouth. If not then top 3 for sure
boxoffice,37ipmt,Shruth1,10,Wed May 27 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"Tomorrowland can drop like 60% and still be on pace to beat Max. Pitch Perfect also has a pretty good buffer. If Max does really well, with like a 40% drop (it will probably mid to high 40s) then they could be close. I'd still say 4th place though."
boxoffice,37ipmt,travod,3,Wed May 27 23:46:10 2015 UTC,I'm taking from the perpesctive that it won on Tuesdays boxoffice. If it hold well like this into the weekend with sub 50% drop I think it can take 2nd or 3rd
boxoffice,37ipmt,Shruth1,3,Wed May 27 23:51:43 2015 UTC,"It had a good Tuesday, but Poltergeist had a better one and neither of us are expecting that to come in 2nd. R rated movies usually have better weekdays anyway."
boxoffice,37ipmt,travod,2,Wed May 27 23:56:21 2015 UTC,R-rated movies generally perform better than PG and PG-13 rated on weekdays.
boxoffice,37ipmt,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Thu May 28 12:40:37 2015 UTC,Mad Max is sub 40% during the weekdays so far this week... PP2 is near 50%
boxoffice,37ipmt,mrstickball,13,Thu May 28 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"So it should hit $100M today, and it's done ~$135M international.   We don't have the hard numbers on marketing and everything, but man I really hope this is enough to convince WB of the viability of a sequel.   Plus, this is the type of movie that's going to look really pretty on Bluray. Factor in the DVD crowd and it feels like a no-brainer, but then again my knowledge of the industry is basically vilch. I just want more George Miller crazy train."
boxoffice,37ipmt,tokomini,4,Thu May 28 01:35:44 2015 UTC,its not even close to being profitable yet

boxoffice,37ipmt,OnSpeakerCrab,4,Thu May 28 06:11:37 2015 UTC,You don't understand how box office works. Studios don't get 100% of ticket prices and production budgets don't even include marketing.
boxoffice,37ipmt,IndyBrodaSolo,3,Thu May 28 08:56:34 2015 UTC,150 million dollar production budget. 100 million marketing budget. 250 mil total.  Grossed 230 mil worldwide so far.  Theaters take around 50%. Needs 500 million worldwide to break even.
boxoffice,37ipmt,mythmaster,4,Thu May 28 08:13:21 2015 UTC,"There's also DVD sales and stuff but yea, basically this."
boxoffice,37ipmt,JohnnyRoss,1 point,Thu May 28 12:14:58 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, I think you're right, about it taking much more than people think for a movie to make profit, but I don't think $500 million is the break-even number.  Do you think the marketing budget was honestly much over $50 million? Do theaters honestly take HALF of what the movie makes (not trying to be sarcastic, genuinely curious; I'm not incredibly educated on the subject, either)?"
boxoffice,37ipmt,Bugger217,1 point,Thu May 28 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"I said 100 million because many have commenters have noticed a vast increase in Mad Max advertising. Maybe these commercials only played on WB affiliated networks and they saved money? I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised by 100 million though.  A theater can take 20 - 25% of a movie's opening weekend and then up to 80% in the later weeks (which is usually beneficial to the studios, but hurts a 'leggy' movie like Fury Road.) Different countries have different rules too. 50% is a relatively safe guesstimate.   What I do see as a general rule of thumb is double the production budget in worldwide grosses to break even which would be 300 mil worldwide for Fury Road. It all depends on how much money they spent on marketing."
boxoffice,37ipmt,mythmaster,-1,Thu May 28 20:21:45 2015 UTC,Miller has confirmed they're already working on the sequel.

They were basically dead even last Monday-Thursday, and then Pitch Perfect 2 took the weekend, likely because the teen girls that couldn't go watch it on school nights watched it on the weekend. This weekend will be more of the same. Plus Mad Max's theater count looks to be taking a bigger hit than Pitch Perfect 2. Plus the big movie this week is another action movie.  I think the bigger story will be PP2 vs. Tomorrowland for 2nd. Tomorrowland sinking below both PP2 and MM for the weekdays already is telling, but Tomorrowland isn't losing any theaters this weekend according to BoxOfficeMojo.com, so it still seems to be a good bet for 2nd. Then PP2 in 3rd and MM in 4th unless Aloha surprises us."
boxoffice,37gmoy,NeilPoonHandler,11,Wed May 27 14:11:34 2015 UTC,Definitely looks like a sure thing. I would be shocked if this movie opens below $100 million.
boxoffice,37gmoy,JamesHouse,1 point,Wed May 27 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'd be a little shocked if it opens above $100 mill. Jurassic Park has enough misfires that it can't cost on name alone. Also, the real major star of the first one was Spielberg. Hell, this was Time Magazine's cover before Lost World. The guy was a force then bigger than any movie star. I really feel like this one has nothing going for it other than people's love of dinosaurs and Chris Pratt, which really can't carry a movie to $100 million. My personal guess is it will lose to San Andreas."
boxoffice,37gmoy,Roller_ball,9,Thu May 28 04:20:19 2015 UTC,The marketing and name brand recognition (as well as the goodwill Pratt has earned) are gonna make this one of the slam dunks of the summer.
boxoffice,37gmoy,ChrisMill,2,Wed May 27 16:58:26 2015 UTC,His acting seems sorta iffy in this one though.
boxoffice,37gmoy,Usagii_YO,4,Wed May 27 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Is it his acting or the script that looks iffy? :) I completely agree that such lines as ""So you just went and made a new dinosaur? Probably not a good idea"" sound trite, but let's be honest, no one goes to Jurassic World for the script or even the acting - you go to see dinosaurs running around and ripping people up.  I do hold out hope that the script might hold some gems that weren't in the trailer. When I think of Jurassic Park, I think of ""Yes, but when Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists"" and ""Find Nedry! Check the vending machines!"" in addition to the great thrills and effects. But I'm sure neither of those were in the Jurassic Park trailer.  But honestly, if the Transformers franchise can keep producing absolute turkies as far as acting and script and still earn hundreds of millions of dollars, I see no reason Jurassic World can't do the same with what I have to imagine will be far better acting and script."
boxoffice,37gmoy,Pripat99,5,Wed May 27 20:02:45 2015 UTC,It is pretty weak dialogue but I'm also surprised by how flat Pratt's delivery appears to be in the trailers and I say that as someone who's been been a huge fan of his since his days on Everwood.
boxoffice,37gmoy,Dorkside,2,Thu May 28 00:58:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. You may be right about his performance, no way of really knowing until the movie is out!"
boxoffice,37gmoy,Pripat99,2,Thu May 28 01:08:03 2015 UTC,"Very true, I'm hoping the movie will surprise me. I think my enjoyment will probably be aided by going in with lowered expectations."
boxoffice,37gmoy,Dorkside,2,Thu May 28 01:10:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope it will be good too - it's one of the only summer box office releases I'm really looking forward to (this and Inside Out). I've liked Pratt in everything I've seen in him, and he seems like a pretty great person in general, so I suppose I'm rooting for him as well. I do worry that you might be right though, in a few weeks we'll know!"
boxoffice,37gmoy,Pripat99,2,Thu May 28 01:25:17 2015 UTC,Why do you think so?
boxoffice,37gmoy,chrisychris-,40,Wed May 27 19:26:35 2015 UTC,I'm sure it's going to do big numbers but I have a nagging feeling the movie is going to suck.

boxoffice,37gmoy,GoldandBlue,2,Wed May 27 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"The only thing I want to know is who the fuck is making the trailers these days, and why the fuck do they still have a job? I dont think there is blockbuster coming out for the next few months that didnt have the entire plot spoiled in a 2 min trailer. Completely ruins the movie and I hope JW/Genisys suffer because of it."
boxoffice,37gmoy,ProxyReaper,4,Wed May 27 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean there are some good trailers but most are very generic. I know people like to ride Marvel, but they make some of the most generic trailers out there, they just have a product people want."
boxoffice,37gmoy,GoldandBlue,2,Wed May 27 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Generic for sure, but some of the best because they dont have spoilers. I felt like the ultron trailer didnt spoil any of the movie for me. I couldnt imagine being excited for AoU if they spoiled the Hulk/BW romance, Andy Serkis, Ultrons plan, Quicksilver's death, the end scene, Jarvis becoming a being, and the Scarlet Witch being the enemy/becoming an ally. They got me excited and thats it."
boxoffice,37gmoy,ProxyReaper,2,Wed May 27 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"Except they kinda did spoil most of the stuff you listed. I'm an info addict as far as new movies and games are concerned, so I watched every trailer and TV spot they released. The only real surprise for me was Quicksilver's death.  Edit: I'd just like to add that my lack of spoiler discipline is mostly my own fault, though spoilers don't really ruin movie experiences for me anyway. But the marketing I've seen for a lot of big movies have usually had enough spoilers for me to piece together the full storyline to a lot of movies weeks before even hitting theaters."
boxoffice,37gmoy,VyRe40,1 point,Wed May 27 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"Except if they had given spoilers, how would you know? I feel like a lot of the time people complain about spoilers in trailers, they are usually wrong, and they don't come back to correct themselves after the movie.                                Besides, the biggest spoiler Marvel does is having their film schedule set so far out."
boxoffice,37gmoy,GoldandBlue,4,Wed May 27 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, have you seen the genisys trailer? Its nothing but plot twists. Spoiling a detail is fine, like the hulk buster armor, but revealing multiple major plot twists in a single trailer is completely asinine. Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese switch roles, Arnie has been in the past for years, and John Connor is a robot. How could those not be massive spoilers?"
boxoffice,37gmoy,ProxyReaper,1 point,Wed May 27 21:46:37 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not really John Conner? Maybe I spoiled it for you? Or maybe you have to see the movie to know for sure don't you?
boxoffice,37gmoy,GoldandBlue,2,Wed May 27 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"I dont get why your so defensive. Its completely a spoiler regardless of if its an imposter or not. In your scenario it would be even worse, actually. Now i go into movie knowing he's a robot at some point, instead of finding out, aka spoiler. And since he's presumably the most important character of the story, yeah thats a pretty big deal."
boxoffice,37gmoy,ProxyReaper,0,Wed May 27 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"Its only a spoiler if it was meant to be secret. For example, Darth Vader is Luke's father is a spoiler. John Conner being a robot seems like a major part of the movie."
boxoffice,37gmoy,GoldandBlue,1 point,Wed May 27 21:53:54 2015 UTC,I think I'm the only one looking forward to Genisys. I'm a huge sucker for overly complicated time travel movies.
boxoffice,37gmoy,Roller_ball,3,Thu May 28 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I think it'll be heavily frontloaded. Regardless of buzz, a new Jurassic Park will make big bank. That being said, if it's bad, it'll probably begin to fizzle out in the remaining weeks."

boxoffice,37gmoy,Mybrainmelts,7,Wed May 27 23:32:26 2015 UTC,It will beat $100m and it doesn't matter if it gets middle of the road reviews.

boxoffice,37ds2i,stoicblunder,5,Tue May 26 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"Not terrible for Polter since it's budget was only 35 mil. Fox projected it at 20-22 million. So while it didn't burn the house down, it was a decent showing. That is the thing with horror films. People love em. As long as you can pull in 50 million in total revenue, you got some golden profits."

It means that an up and coming director can get a small budget of a couple million, and make something great like It Follows. But it also means studios putting out pieces of shit like that webcam movie."
boxoffice,37ds2i,stoicblunder,1 point,Wed May 27 04:32:12 2015 UTC,Yes there are a ton of trashy horror flicks. It is like the farm league for directors. Do well and you get moved up to the majors. It Follows was the best horror film I have seen since Scream back in 97.  Totally groundbreaking for the genre. What is crazy about that It Follows is that felt like it was made outside of the normal studio system. It felt very indie in the best way possible. It didnt have the feel of the conjuring or any of the remakes.

boxoffice,37cujv,sctrojans1112,6,Tue May 26 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"I think you're off on the comparison to What Lies Beneath if you mean content wise.  I think good comparison films would be Sleepy Hollow (Tim Burton and GDT have similar audiences, released in November, supernatural period horror film), The Others and The Woman in Black (both also supernatural period horror films).  Sleepy Hollow (November 1999) - $206M WW  The Others (August 2001) - $209M WW  The Woman in Black (February 2012) - $127M WW  Crimson Peak will be released in IMAX and so that's also something to consider, although I'm not sure of how much it impacts box office versus standard release. If anything it shows that there is some confidence in the performance of this film, and that it may be seen as a ""theater experience"" (and the trailer seems to vouch for that).  It will be affected by the release of another Paranormal Activity sequel in its second week, although that series is on a downward trend. Goosebumps with Jack Black, released the same day, could get some of the audience for the sake of nostalgia, but its going to be a more lighthearted horror comedy. As far as October releases go, Crimson Peak is poised to be the #1 horror film of the Halloween season and uncontested at least until Rings in mid-November.   Last October, Dracula Untold took in $215M, Annabelle $255M and they were early October releases. Ouija, which was released in late October, only took in $102M. Last October had a big box office, though, and may have been a bit of an anomaly. By comparison, 2013's only October horror movie of note was Carrie at $83M.   I like Sleepy Hollow as a point of reference for content and last October's box office for the buying trends. Sleepy Hollow adjusted for inflation is about $226M. I think Crimson Peak outperforms that based on a lack of horror options, decent star power, and the unique style - but maybe not past Annabelle's $255M. I'd guess between $230M and $240M."
boxoffice,37cujv,CesareSomnambulist,3,Tue May 26 20:18:08 2015 UTC,Great analysis man! Very in depth and thought provoking thank you for that!
boxoffice,37cujv,Mybrainmelts,2,Tue May 26 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"I think the rating will help it. if it gets a PG-13, then it will open pretty good, but R rating will hurt it a bit if the budget is high."
boxoffice,37cujv,mardfet,2,Tue May 26 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"It already got an R rating actually, kinda surprising given that it's so far off but dang, Annabelle made $250M? That movie sucked so hard. This is coming off more as a blockbuster and not just a standard horror film to me, with its huge budget and an IMAX release. Could flop, could do really well but I don't think a $30M opening is totally unreasonable."
boxoffice,37cujv,CesareSomnambulist,1 point,Fri May 29 13:47:54 2015 UTC,I agree with this for the most part. It looks quite big budget. But horror movies in October can buck the trend that an R rating is a disadvantage - people are craving a good one regardless of the rating. I expect it to be PG-13 myself.
boxoffice,37cujv,Bugger217,2,Tue May 26 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"Has a rating already. Rated R for bloody violence, some sexual content, and brief strong language."

boxoffice,37cujv,tcatron565,1 point,Wed May 27 02:16:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think horror is the only genre that can really get away with an ""R."" I know the teenage crowd won't be able to see it without someone older as they would with a PG-13 horror, but many horror fans see an ""R"" rating and automatically assume more intense than the PG-13 ones, and that's a big draw, and even more so with the new onslaught of PG-13 horror flicks like Ouija, Insidious, The Last Exorcism, The Woman in Black, etc. The Conjuring was R and brought in over $100 million domestically, for example. Especially around October when the horror genre is at its highest peak of interest.  Frankly, though, I haven't heard a single thing about Crimson Peak outside of the TrailerVision poster that plays behind me at the theater I work at. Hopefully that changes soon because it looks pretty interesting, and more word spreads about it as the release gets closer."

Pans and Cronos has given him a lot of love he doesn't deserve  Pacific Rim is one of the films I use as a barometer of how stupid someone is (yes yes that in itself is stupid heard all the witty responses)"
boxoffice,37cujv,tcatron565,4,Wed May 27 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"No, my response is very valid. How can there be bad word of mouth when his only two films that are similar to this were very well received?  That is strictly your opinion. Pan's Labyrinth has 95% from critics and 91% from audience members. Those are Mad Max numbers right there. It seems you are in the major minority of not liking it.  Pacific Rim also received positive scores at 72% from critics and 77% from audience members. You're still in the minority there for not liking it.  I understand that you may not like the movies, but both films were very well received, which is a good sign that Crimson Peak will also be well received, meaning good word of mouth."
boxoffice,37cujv,NinjaDiscoJesus,-1,Wed May 27 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. His films play well in the fanboy market. Outside of that they lumber on. I mentioned Pans and Cronos.  You are using rotten tomatoes as a basis for your judgements.   Hellboy 1 and 2 were flops. Blade was a franchise and not a great box success (it made money sure) and Pacific Rim scraped into a minor profit   Trust me, word of mouth, outside the world of fanboys and rotten tomatoes reviews, is not that great  Baffling response, and you keep at it  You prob really think you are right as well  If Pacific Rim had good word of mouth it would have made far more than 411m"
boxoffice,37cujv,tcatron565,1 point,Wed May 27 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"His films play well in the fanboy market. Outside of that they lumber on.   Okay, then why do they do so well with critics?   You are using rotten tomatoes as a basis for your judgements.   Yes. What is your point here? Rotten Tomatoes aggregates their results based on critic reviews and audience ratings. It's not restricted to any one group of people, anyone can put in a rating. What would you rather me use? IMDb? 8.3/10 for Pan's Labyrinth. 7/10 for Pacific Rim.   Hellboy 1 and 2 were flops. Blade was a franchise and not a great box success (it made money sure)   Okay, but those movies aren't exactly related to Crimson Peak like Pan's and Rim are, and I explained why. GDT is the writer, producer, and director for Crimson. The only other two films like are Pan's Labyrinth and Pacific Rim.   Trust me, word of mouth, outside the world of fanboys and rotten tomatoes reviews, is not that great   I've only ever heard great things about Pan's, and only generally favourable stuff about Pacific Rim.   Baffling response, and you keep at it   Numbers don't lie, bud.   You prob really think you are right as well   Great argument!   If Pacific Rim had good word of mouth it would have made far more than 411m   Domestically, it opened with $37 million, but proceed to make $102 million. Its legs were fairly strong. What these numbers tell me is that the film's marketing wasn't good, which caused for a less than stellar opening. As I remember, the trailers made the film look like a bad rehash on Transformers and Battleship, which already are both bad movies. If the word of mouth had been as terrible as you are claiming for it to be, it wouldn't have made it much past $70 million domestically.  Also, I see you neglected Pan's. A $4.5 million domestic opening leading to $37.6 million overall. That's amazing!"

boxoffice,37b0rh,Defengar,13,Tue May 26 09:51:05 2015 UTC,One thing that gives me hope is that Warner Bros. is very much on the side of Mad Max. They gave it a huge marketing push and a prime summer spot. They'll take even a modest success as a sign to make more Mad Max films.
boxoffice,37b0rh,mi-16evil,12,Tue May 26 13:49:34 2015 UTC,I like to imagine the reason for this is because it's such a kickass movie even the grey suits at the top of corporate thought it deserved every opportunity they could give it.

boxoffice,37b0rh,ArnoldAn,9,Wed May 27 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"I think this will have better legs than Edge of Tomorrow: Max has a nostalgia factor that brings in a whole new market segment (and their kids) and it is getting even better critical praise. I think the buzz of the first as a one of the classic ""must see"" action movies would create a monstrous opening weekend for a sequel. Studios know this. Bottom line though is keep spreading the word about this movie b/c it truly is something special. I also think people haven't tapped into a lot of the other aspects of the film that makes this a true triumph, such as breaking narrative form by basically having one extended third act spread across 5 or 6 action set pieces. I effin' love this movie."
boxoffice,37b0rh,kayjay734,10,Tue May 26 16:07:30 2015 UTC,"It hasn't hit profitability yet. Usually about 50% of proceeds go to the theaters, and there are different rules for different countries in the international market. The general rule of thumb for a studio released feature, if a = marketing + production costs and b = box office take, is (b-2a)/2. So for Mad Max, which likely cost approx. $200 million to produce and market, $400 million is probably the line to break even at (which it will likely reach)."

Movie has to gross 2x it's production+marketing budget before breaking even. So Fury Road has to gross at least 400 million before breaking even and that's assuming that marketing budget was 50 million and it probably was higher.  Of course there are also merchandise, dvd, blu-ray, vod etc."
boxoffice,37b0rh,hasabooga,1 point,Tue May 26 21:38:58 2015 UTC,How much money does the movie have to make before we can call it a success? The budget is apparently $150 (though I've seen as high as $200m rumoured) so are we talking about $500m here?
boxoffice,37b0rh,GoldandBlue,1 point,Tue May 26 13:28:09 2015 UTC,"It is hard to say because marketing is never factored in or made public. Let's say $150 is accurate. It had a pretty strong marketing campaign so let's put it conservatively at $70M domestic. Again, if we are being conservative let's say $80M international. That is $300M international they need to make to break even. And that is being conservative."
boxoffice,37b0rh,RDandersen,1 point,Tue May 26 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"That is $300M international they need to make to break even.     If we're talking about the studio breaking even on the movie, it's waaaaay more than $300M at the boxoffice. Like, double that, at least. But profitability at the box office and success are not always the same. Some movies double their production budget and are deemed failures, other barely meet it internationally and gets sequels greenlight. It's really, really hard to know when a movie like this is considered successful for the studio because the goal posts can go so far beyond the theater.   What we do know is that Miller has at least one sequel chambered already and quite a few people aching for it so whether that gets the greenlight or not will be the ultimate determination of Fury Road's success."
boxoffice,37b0rh,GoldandBlue,3,Tue May 26 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"If that is the measure than Mad Max was a success before it opened. WB cares about it's relationships with talent. Miller and Hardy are two very important people to the studio and the rave reviews was probably enough. Unless the film completely flopped there was never any doubt, in my mind at least, that WB was happy with the movie and their futures with both Miller and Hardy.             I potential Mad Max franchise was a bonus to WB. What they cared about was having Miller join Nolan, Cuaron, Affleck, etc, to their roster of go to talent, and be the de facto home for their future projects."
boxoffice,37b0rh,RDandersen,-3,Tue May 26 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"If that is the measure than Mad Max was a success before it opened.   No it wasn't. So far, 0 Mad Max movies have been greenlight past Fury Road. WB caring about Miller is all well and fine but ultimately meaningless to consumers if it doesn't result in movies. It is a narrative that is created and promoted because it's good PR and whether it's true or not, and I happen to believe it is, is irrelevant without production.      and the rave reviews was probably enough.     Historically speaking, absolutely not. There's a reason the terms critical success and financial success exist and it's because they are two entirely separate measures that do not always go hand in hand. And for movies of a $100M budget, it is always the later that is the dominant.     What they cared about was having Miller join Nolan, Cuaron, Affleck, etc, to their roster of go to talent, and be the de facto home for their future projects.     You have that backwards. Mad Max is the result of his relationship to WB, not the cause of it. The only work he's done the last 9 years prior to Fury Road are 2 WB production as Director, Writer and Producer.     I'm sorry so say this but you come off as either a bit willfully ignorant or incredibly naive. That's fine, it's allowed, of course, but you do realize that you are on a forum that is dedicated to mainly discussing the financial performance of films at the box office and the factors that play into that, right?"

You specifically said ""It's really, really hard to know when a movie like this is considered successful for the studio because the goal posts can go so far beyond the theater."" And that is what I am answering and now you come back saying but that is naive because blah blah blah blah. The goal for this movie did in fact go beyind performance in the theater. Miller had just had a frustrating experienvce with the Justice League movie and WB wanted to keep the relationship on good terms. He had this idea since the 90's and WB gave him the greenlight. That goes beyond Box Office, and you are the one that brought that up."
boxoffice,37b0rh,RDandersen,1 point,Tue May 26 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"You do realize that ""breaking even"" is a term of financial success, right? The post you replied to asked about success in general and replied to ""conservatively $300M international to break even"" which is a measure of financial success. It's also the flagrant misuse of the term ""conservative"" but nevermind that.    The point is that when I went on to explain that when the studio wants to produce a sequel, which they do, but not until goal X is met and we don't know what X is, we can't even begin to guess at whether the movie is successful or not until a green light on the sequel. So when you say things like       If that is the measure than Mad Max was a success before it opened.     how am I suppose to interpret that? Honestly? All your speculation about personal relationships aside for now, you open with an unprompted rundown of financials that's off by a factor of two, so there's no success there. I then introduce an alternative goal for success that hasn't yet been met and you reply that this was met prior to release. You then follow it up with studio/personal relationship babble which is irrelevant to both points, especially the one you brought up to begin with, so tell me, how am I suppose to interpret that? Blinding fanboyism? Willful ignorance? Or naivete of a passion product still being bound by the reality of business in its roots.    Unless your point is ""The movie is a success because all WB wanted was a working relationship with Miller and they have that now"" I honestly have no idea what you are talking about and if that is your point I guess we just have radically different interpretations of what ""box office"" is."
boxoffice,37b0rh,GoldandBlue,5,Tue May 26 17:59:45 2015 UTC,Let me get this straight. My OP was about the financial success of the film. You then respond and say the success of the film is not always measured in Box Office success. I then agree with you and say that the measure of success for this film was greater than just Box Office. Then you respond and say I am naive and we should only talk about Box Office. You are the one talking in circles.           How do you interpret what I said? Well read it in the context of my post.
boxoffice,37b0rh,Honestmonster,1 point,Tue May 26 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"Even if Mad Max breaks even as a film it could still be worth it financially to WB. A lot of that ""cost"" goes right back into other divisions of WB and they can see it as a money generating franchise for those divisions. A sequel also doesn't have the risk that resurrecting a franchise that's been dead for 30 years does, so therefore it's more likely to get a sequel than it was for Fury Road to be made in the first place. Looking at how much money it made at the box office then guessing at ""costs"" the production incurred is useless."

boxoffice,37b2kf,TrueMarvelFan,79,Tue May 26 08:55:42 2015 UTC,"If anyone truly knew the answer to this question they'd be stupid to tell you because they could sell their answer to a studio for a tidy sum. The answer is 'we don't know'. If people did then as you say someone else would have replicated Cameron's success by now, which they haven't. In fact, they haven't even come close.   However, there are some things we can say about Titanic and Avatar to give you an idea of just how they make so much.   They have broad appeal - they appeal to what is called all four quadrants that is: both male and female and over and under 25 years old. Now most blockbusters are also aimed at these four groups too. Cameron goes a little further than that. Not only do his films appeal to audiences domestically, they also appeal to audiences internationally. Avatar made  72.7% of its entire gross at the international box office, which might not sound that crazy, but when you realize it made $760,507,625 domestically it really is very impressive. Avatar managed to reach people around the world like nothing has before, or since.   People watch them again, and again, and again... - most films will experience what is called a 'drop off', that is the money it makes one weekend compared to the next weekend, this is usually ~50-60%. Avatar dropped by only -1.8% in its first weekend, and only -9.4% the weekend after that. Not only that but in its 6th week at the box office Avatar actually increased on the previous weekend by +8.1%. It continued to do numbers like this for a very long time you can see for yourself here. It wasn't only Avatar either that had long legs and spent a long time in the theatre, Titanic did too, in fact it spent so long that the film reels started to disintegrate because they'd been played so long and so much.   You might ask why do they last so long and have so many repeat viewings? The answer for this is much harder and more speculation on my part. I believe that the reason is that Cameron doesn't just give us a film to watch in the theatre he gives us an experience. One that you can't really replicate at home. The grand nature of Titanic and the revolutionary 3D in Avatar meant that seeing it at the theatre was something that you knew you probably wouldn't see against at home. This itself caused massive amounts of positive word of mouth which again led to more people seeing it and even more repeat viewings.   With other films like Age of Ultron (although the negative word of mouth will have also been a factor) people go see them once and that's it. It's just another film, it's not an experience.   As for your other question, I do think he'll be beaten, you can only fight inflation for so long (although it's note worthy that Titanic would still be #1 if Avatar hadn't taken its crown)."

boxoffice,37b2kf,Haydenhai,4,Tue May 26 11:57:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think Avatar 2 will beat Avatar; it is no longer a new IP, nor is the 3D tech they use unseen and groundbreaking, and its been a while for the hype to die down a bit.

I'd say that smaller target demo separates them from his later films.   Although it should be noted that they were both in the top 10 highest grossing films of their respective years, Aliens coming in at #7 for 1986, and Terminator 2 coming in at #1."
boxoffice,37b2kf,jwt155,1 point,Tue May 26 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"I think a major part your missing with Cameron's success is his legitimacy towards moviegoers. He has been so consistent for so long, dating back for nearly 3 decades, and has made at least one film that any type of viewer can identify with. Almost no other director has this type of resume with a broad audience. A major part of his success is not only the broad appeal of his movies but also the strength of his brand name that has been steadily built up over the years."
boxoffice,37b2kf,Psimitry,2,Wed May 27 15:14:00 2015 UTC,"They have broad appeal   This, I think is the main thing. The way he writes (and I'm not being negative here - I thoroughly enjoy his movies) hits on very solid points for most viewers. His most successful movies have been written on very simple, yet universal characters. His heroes are about as basic as it gets - they're always where they are for a very specific (yet unique) reason. His love interests are always a part of that situation, yet with enough debt to be interesting. His villains, on the other hand, are always one-dimensional. So evil they could be e-ville. When dealing with universal characters like this, it has an INSANELY high international appeal."

Mad Max: Fury Road is a theater experience film, but it has narrow appeal, so it's losing to family flicks and comedies at the box office. Jurassic World will make a boatload of money, maybe the most in 2015 so far, because of the same factors; but it won't be another Jurassic Park because it doesn't have the same visionary behind the wheel. Cameron has all the check marks for success, not just one or two."
boxoffice,37b2kf,seperationsunday,16,Wed May 27 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that in many circles, both Titanic and Avatar were predicted to flop before they released. Cameron just defies expectations.  I think Titanic did around $30mil and Avatar $70mil for their US opening weekends - not the kind of supersized blockbuster numbers that you see Avengers and F+F doing. But they kept making more and more money, and I think word of mouth really sustained Titanic and Avatar. They are 'event' films, the kind of films that everybody talks about. They're made for the cinema.  The buzz around 3D probably helped Avatar a lot. I know 3D had being around for quite some time pre-Avatar, but it felt like this was the first time it was doing properly and on a large scale. I remember getting such a kick putting those 3D glasses on. It was Avatar that started this awful trend of 3D films - in 2010, you had awful 2D-3D conversions (Alice in Wonderland, Clash of the Titans) that saturated the market."
boxoffice,37b2kf,Haydenhai,1 point,Tue May 26 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"The predictions for Avatar being a flop were more of the lack of information on what to expect rather than many people expecting it to actually flop; the only reason people were unsure is because they had little to no prior experience with a massive 3D, high tech, wide appeal, world wide released movie with the budget and movie experience that James Cameron has previously been known for. It was a huge movie, and with every huge movie that is very ambitious there's a chance that it can be exceptionally weak and not meet the promised hype. They were being realistically negative by default rather than having true reasons for expecting a flop."

Aliens with the love of Ripley for the little girl, Terminator is Sarah Conor with the unconditional love of Kyle Reese, Terminator 2 is Sarah´s love as a mother in search of the perfect adoptive father for her son, etc. etc.  They are chick movies that men love to watch because of the tech and explosions, so everybody is happy. It is incredible that so far he is the only director to get this, and it is probably because of his collaboration with very talented women like Gale Anne Hurd and Kathryn Bigelow."
boxoffice,37b2kf,GotMoFans,9,Tue May 26 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion? James Cameron makes action movies for women. I know Titanic had longevity because girls and women kept seeing it. I think the love story in Avatar was the appealing plot point to go along with the beautiful 3D visuals. If you make an action movie geared to women that men like and are willing to see, I think that led to Cameron's record breaking success. I think that Star Trek worked better than the previous Star Trek movies because it was the ST women who weren't Trekkies would love. If SW: The Force Awakens doesn't completely appeal to women, it won't make over $450 domestically."
boxoffice,37b2kf,Republican_Atheist,20,Tue May 26 10:35:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's more accurate to say that he doesn't make action films geared only towards men. Although that's just me being nitpicky and I agree with your overall point, he is one of the most inclusive directors."

boxoffice,37b2kf,sorry_bad_english,2,Tue May 26 21:53:44 2015 UTC,"This may help answer your question, it's Cameron describing his approach to storytelling :    “You have to find a key into the heart of the audience, which means you have to find universals of human experience and then express them in exotic new ways.  So you’ve got to find something that people recognize.  As simple as boy meets girl on a ship which is going to sink.  But the knowledge that it’s going to sink was a critical part of that storytelling.  Because otherwise you had two hours of women in corsets and funny hats before anything happened, before the ship even hit the iceberg.  But if you know it’s sinking, you hang around for all that. “But I think it’s always about the characters and about how those characters express something that the audience is feeling.  So it has to have some universality to it, having to do with relationships, whether it’s male-female, parent-child, whatever it is.  And then you have to take them on a journey — and then you have to make it excruciating somehow. Challenged, endangered, in pain.  Fear, tension, and triumph.  Some form of triumph — our values, our victory, something.  “In the case of Titanic, everybody died.  Including, at the very end of the film, the main character, but she lived a life that she had learned.   There was an energy transfer from one character to another.  Which I also think is a fundamental of a love story, that there’s some a flow of energy from one character to another.  So I applied that rule set at a very abstract level to Avatar. Because it’s a very different story.  But I think you can step back to a very abstract level of general principles.  If you apply those principles, that will work.”"

boxoffice,379eow,Shruth1,27,Mon May 25 23:12:35 2015 UTC,"Instead of just wildly pulling a number out of my ass I'm going to try to do a detailed analysis and see If I can create a reasonable estimate. It's important to note that adjusting for inflation, no star wars film has made under 400 million domestic, so that will be the low bar (Attack of the clones adjusted 422 mil dom). If it doesn't reach this it will be labelled a disappointment. I think that some people are getting hyperbolic with their expectations (It won't beat Avatar, get that out of your head), but I would be genuinely shocked if this doesn't break the 400 mil barrier. Note: from here on out all of my stats will be adjusted for inflation, provided from boxofficemojo.com  Now let's set the high bar. How film finances work is different than 30 years ago, so we can't use the original Trilogy for a frame of reference. The best frames of references are the star wars prequels, the lord of the rings franchise (biggest decemeber franchise) and the James Cameron Juggernauts. The hype surrounding this film may be gigantic, but it is not as feverish as when the phantom menace was released. Being that their was less scepticism for it and that people went to the movies more in 99, I'd say that it will be very difficult for TFA to reach PM's 688 dom tole. (also note that quality didn't factor into PM's total, it took a while for the quality of the film to sink in).   The next step is to predict the opening weekend, and the weekend multiplier for total. predicting the opening weekend is hard, because I'm going to use Return of the King (last LOTR film) and Revenge of the Sith (last SW film) for reference, but they both opened on weekdays (Thursday and Wednesday respectfully). For Revenge of the Sith had an opening weekend or 137 mil, but If I take the 3 best days of the 4 day opening, I get an opening of 158 mil. Let's assume that 1/3 of the people on thurs would have gone on friday, which adds 20 mil to the total, giving ROS a 178 mil opening weekend. This is how I would predict the force awakens to open in May, maybe giving it a little nudge since opening weekends are more prominent now (let's go with 185). But this is dec, so we have to change it up. If I take the best 3 days of ROTK's opening, I get 115 mil. I'll add 20 mil to that to compensate for the 2 missed days (this is also inline with it's next 2 weekend drops of 49%, and you prob won't get record setting weekends when everyone is getting ready for christmas). It's important to note that dispite their difference in opening numbers, they both ended up pretty close in their overall domestic haul, so I'll treat them as equivalents (ROTK is the ROTS in december). So if ROTS opened in december, it prob would have opened to somewhere in the 135-155 range. For Force Awakens, I expect something higher than that, so we'll add on 10 mil for the rise in opening weekend culture, and just feverish buzz (maybe even word of mouth) and I'll put a range at 145-165 opening weekend. I highly doubt TFA opens less than furious 7, but 165 seems too high for me, so I'll put the opening weekend at 154, just above the middle. For the multiplyer, worst case scenario it plays like ROTS' 3x would put it at a total of 462, and I'll say best case it plays like ROTK's 4x which would put it at 616 mil (this is right in line with Avengers). It'll be curious to see, whether this plays like a star wars film, or a Lord of the rings film. Before doing this I thought 500 mil was very difficult, but by seeing the stats, opening in December gives TFA a huge advantage. I'll just go for the middle, which'll give me a domestic total of 534 mil.   Worldwide is very tricky, if you adjust ROTS, it easily reaches a billion. China is the real wild card. A lot of recent films there have become blow out successes even though their previous instalments weren't. So I could very easily see this become a huge hit in China. Let's say a Chinese total of 250 (to be fair I just pulled that out of my ass so yeah I'm disobeying my own rules, I am far less knowledgeable on foreign box office). ROTS had a 468 foreign total last time, so let's say that it expands to 600 for TFA, add the 250 from china and we get a foreign total of 850, and a worldwide total of 1.384 bil. That is my prediction."

boxoffice,379eow,CesareSomnambulist,1 point,Tue May 26 04:13:41 2015 UTC,but do you? that is the question.
boxoffice,379eow,jburd22,4,Tue May 26 05:59:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's difficult to call right now since it's still half a year away. I think the marketing and buzz for this thing has been pretty organic, and the studio machine hasn't even begun to flex its muscle just yet. Ultimately, I think that The Force Awakens could be made or broken based on whether it reaches children. The big question is how it fits in with the movies of today, because I think the success of the past two trilogies were in a lot of ways determined by that.  Everyone knows that a lot of the original trilogy's success is owed to how much kids fell in love with the characters, universe, and most importantly for Lucas, the merch. They were serious movies, of course, but they were still ultimately fantasy stories with minimal violence, bad language, etc. I think this was key for Star Wars breaking free from the other big winners of the 70s, because that was a period with very gritty, no holds barred type films (The French Connection, The Exorcist, for example). This of course paved the way for other kid-friendly fantasy blockbusters after it, like ET, Back to the Future, and Indiana Jones.   The Phantom Menace undoubtedly capitalized on being a big return for the franchise after a long time away. But the marketing and the film itself also seemed to be similar to the tone of the first three films, at least in terms of appealing to kids, and their parents. Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith were different. Phantom ended up not being the movie people were expecting in terms of quality, no, but they also weren't expecting something quite so political. It was less straight forward than the original trilogy. So that didn't help leading into the next two. They were also sold as more serious and darker films, and the political aspects of the trilogy continued.   Revenge of the Sith is particularly dark, even if it is the best film of the prequel trilogy IMO and the triumphant return of Darth Vader. It still involves Anakin getting dismembered essentially in hell, killing a group of younglings, choking Amidala while she's pregnant before she eventually dies in child birth, and the decapitation of Count Dooku. Yes the original trilogy had violence and some dark things, but not at this level, and I think that really matters when you compare it to the other big films of the time. Films traditionally aimed at kids were starting to become grittier again (ie; superhero movies) but Harry Potter, which I would argue is closer to the original Star Wars in tone, still cleaned up a the box office. LOTR, while still fantasy, is more mature and serious than Harry Potter, so maybe closer to the new trilogy, and it also cleaned up. The new trilogy got kind of stuck in between these kinds of blockbusters and I think that hindered its performance a bit. Instead of going against the grain like the original trilogy, it was a mish mash of popular tones of the time.  Like you, I don't know how it will stack up internationally, either. TFA should be able to compete with the numbers of last year's Transformers film at $1.1B, but it is a bit surprising how well Furious 7 has done and continues to do in China (at least on the surface, since there was significant Chinese investment in production). I'm not sure how TFA will stack up against F7 just yet because F7 is still going and TFA is so far out. But F7 did reap the benefits of circumstances that aren't replicable, such as the death of Paul Walker and questions of whether it was the final chapter of the resurgent franchise.  F7 is at $1.5B right now, so essentially you have predicted that TFA falls in between Transformers last year and F7 this year.  I like your number. I think it's very realistic. But it's too early for me to say just yet. If the tone is similar to Avengers, which is arguably a lot like the original trilogy in tone and marketing, then I see it being the biggest film released in 2015, and so $1.5B+. If it gets too caught up being gritty and realistic, I see it losing out to the Avengers, and being around 3rd place at under $1.1B."
boxoffice,379eow,CesareSomnambulist,6,Tue May 26 15:23:19 2015 UTC,"I do, it sickens me to death that fan boys are blatantly agreeing that this will be the fist film to cross 3 billion. I loved the detailed explanation you've given though my estimate is higher than yours, around 1.45 billion if it has a high rewatch value like the avengers and avatar i could see it doing 1.7 billion."
boxoffice,379eow,wingzero00,5,Tue May 26 08:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think the greatest unknown is how the franchise does after a 9 year slumber versus the fact they are bringing back the original cast.   3 billion is delirium. I think 1.5 - 2.0 billion is a good range... But its so hard to tell. China is a huge wildcard, and so are many markets that are much larger now - Russia, South Korea, EMEA, and Latin America are huge now."
boxoffice,379eow,mrstickball,3,Tue May 26 17:19:18 2015 UTC,Oh forget 3 billion. The goal for star wars should be 2 billion. It still boggles my mind to this day how Avatar made 2.7 BILLION dollars worldwide. Like that is just insane
boxoffice,379eow,Punchdrunkpun,5,Tue May 26 21:41:44 2015 UTC,"The curious thing about WW for Star Wars is that it doesn't have the typical 30% domestic, 70% international split that applies for LOTR and many other releases. Instead, Star Wars has historically hovered closer to the 50/50 marks. It will be interesting to see if this trend will hold up or not. Either way, I think you're right in that China is going to have a major role to play, and may even be the deciding factor in that regard."
boxoffice,379eow,FartingBob,6,Tue May 26 07:54:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, when the original trilogy was out, international box office was barely reported at all and the numbers couldnt be trusted.  The prequels though have reliable International numbers, but back then a 50-50 split between domestic and international was much more common. It's only in the last 10 years that we've really seen International numbers almost always bigger than domestic.  This film will certainly have a bigger Int:Dom ratio than any previous SW films, although whether it proves as successful overseas as Avengers and Furious 7 have this year (around 1bn International) remains to be seen."
boxoffice,379eow,JakkuScavenger,3,Tue May 26 09:14:14 2015 UTC,"Return of the King is not really a fair comparison for opening weekend. Aside from the fact that it opened on a Wednesday, as you already mentioned, it was three hours and twenty minutes. What that means is that theaters couldn't play it as many times as they would be able to play The Force Awakens."
boxoffice,379eow,jburd22,4,Tue May 26 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"That is true, but it's the closest comparison because:  a) it has the best December opening weekend with inflation.   b)It was more to see how mega franchises can perform in December.  c) hype surrounding ROTK was super high and I think anticipation cancels out lack of screens. I wish we were given per screen average to see if ROTK had more sold out showings than average for example."

boxoffice,379eow,best_in_life,8,Tue May 26 08:49:35 2015 UTC,"I would like to think that Force Awakens will be one of the safe bets this year to reach a billion dollars. How high it goes beyond that number will depend on the buildup to the release, and WOM.  If WOM is highly positive, we will likely see 500M+ domestic. Even if we have a 40/60 domestic to overseas ratio, the overseas total comes to 800M. So I'd say 1.3B might well be the floor if the WOM is on the positive side.  If WOM is negative, the brand value and opening should still take it over 400M (as /u/jburd22 also mentioned). At that point, if the domestic to overseas ratio remains at 40/60, we have ~400M domestic and ~600M overseas for a grand total of 1B.  Anything below the billion dollar mark would likely be considered a disappointment for one of the biggest & most awaited release in recent times.  EDIT: Although I used the 40/60 ratio, the trend for big releases (Avengers & LOTR as reference) shows a ratio closer to 35/65; that would mean the floor might well be greater than 1B in worst case scenario.  Just putting these numbers here so I can check if I'll be close after the release: Domestic: ~550M Overseas: ~850M Final: ~1.4B"
boxoffice,379eow,Daxtreme,2,Tue May 26 04:42:07 2015 UTC,"Like the above poster said, it's highly unlikely that the movie grosses under $400 million domestic just because of the Star Wars brand, plus the fact that it's released in December (which generally means it has long, lasting legs) That being said, it's pretty safe to assume that there is at least a 66% (1 std dev) probability that the movie will gross between $400 mil and $600 mil domestic, that's only a $200 mil variance in the worst case scenario.  The real variance begins when you account for foreign gross. It's nigh impossible to accurately predict what the worldwide pattern will be with episode 7, especially lately with China becoming this huge, unpredictable monster that can gross $60 million or $390 million on just about any movie.  So, for the sake of this unpredictable foreign gross, I will predict, against you a bit largely on the foreign front so we can compare later on:  Domestic: $500M Foreign: $1.1B total = $1.6B"

boxoffice,379eow,BrosephSingh,2,Tue May 26 08:59:37 2015 UTC,I'm not expecting it to make 2 billion. Right now I'll say 500 domestic and 900 overseas for 1.4 billion total worldwide
boxoffice,379eow,mrstickball,2,Mon May 25 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"There is no way of knowing, because the international market is so different today than 9 years ago. We also have no idea how good of a movie it will be, and if that matters overseas.  I think that, at a minimum, it breaks Decembers record for opening by maybe $100m and could pull Hunger Games type numbers.  If it sucks, it should do $400m just from the name alone domestically. If its good, $600m is in play. I dont think Avatars record is in jeopardy. 3d isnt a big draw, and I dont see the movie getting a 4 month unopposed run like Avatar.  On international... I think everyone is lying if they say they know whats going to happen. Star Wars had weak sales in South Korea and China last time...and are key to a huge BO run. Europe will be huge, and so will Japan. Anywhere from $700 million and up is in play. Who knows where it ends up. $1.1 billion is the floor and would be bad. It should hit $1.5 billion... or at least target it. It will be an exciting run for sure."
boxoffice,379eow,Republican_Atheist,2,Tue May 26 02:17:29 2015 UTC,Whatever happens I'm just going to sit back and laugh at all the people who will be claiming it is going to gross $3b+ as we get closer to release.

boxoffice,379eow,EliteThem,1 point,Tue May 26 01:20:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't be disappointed if SW FWA gets 2 billion WW.  It will make F&F7 money (1.5B) and some.   It should make 200m (550m) or more domestic than F&F7, which looks to be finishing ~350m, so theres 1.7B.   It could well make 650+ making it 1.8B+ etc.   And if the movie is real good, it will have more ""rewatch"" value then F&F7, so getting the other 200m (especially in the ever growing international market) doesn't seem all that out of reach, but again, it all depends on how good the movie is.   TL;DR: It's a lock for 1.5B, but how much more depends on if the movie beats expectations.   2B is possible with steller reviews."

Tell us all about how great and ground breaking the films coming out of the China Film Group Corporation are.  We all know that any art form flourishes under state-controlled monopolies.  Always.
boxoffice,37537s,bluecamel2015,2,Mon May 25 18:29:00 2015 UTC,So does this mean it has a good chance of crossing $300m in China?
boxoffice,37537s,Republican_Atheist,2,Mon May 25 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"Not really. It plummeted 70% last weekend in China, only making $50m during the 7-day week. Unless it magically finds a good hold, its going to top out around $260-$270m. Which is still extremely good for a Marvel movie there."

(For people checking out film podcasts I highly recommend Filmspotting.) A few thoughts as you embark..   Keep it under an hour. Lots of new podcasts blather on for a long time, but you don't need more than 60 minutes - even 30!   Keep the conversation organized. Lots of new podcasts I check out are aimless and just talk generally about their topic. Have specific questions and even named segments that organize your thoughts.   Pick a day of the week to post and never, ever miss a day.   Let us know when you get started!"

It's good, but they are snooty, which I can't stand. Talking about movies should be fun. Cinema Blend had a really good one back in 2006, but they ended it.  I would definitely listen. You can use Soundcloud to distribute. It has a great social component that will help get you new listeners.  I would love to help out anyway I can. I have a music podcast, and it is a lot of fun. I think the key is to have a mixture of routine segments and novelty segments. A listener wants to both know what is coming each week, but also be surprised as well if that makes any sense. Also, make it short and sweet. No longer than an hour, 45-30 min is more digestible.  Go for it!"

I scrolled back up after reading half of it and saw that Ray Subers had been subbed. :(  So few articles are written now (once a week barely) and they lack the content.  And whatever happened to the summer predictions post? Grrrrr. It's only weekend reports now, no overseas reports, no forecasts, no grading card.  If you look at the history, you can see Ray was writing articles on 3/1, 3/1, 3/3, 3/5, 3/7, 3/8, 3/8, 3/11, 3/12, 3/14, 3/15, 3/15, 3/19, 3/21, 3/22, 3/26, 3/26, 3/28, 3/29. That was all the posts of March.  Now look at May:  Last one from Ray was 5/3, then 5/10, and 5/17 for the new guy.

BoxOffice.com is good for domestic and overseas analysis, but they don't get too fun with it. It's just straight facts, which is still great. They give analysis on daily BO, too.  They also put out long range forecasts each week for the movies opening in two months, which is cool. They give predictions for opening weekend, and total domestic take."

boxoffice,36zu9o,mythmaster,4,Sat May 23 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"to the detriment of their shareholders.    Not really, you mentioned this but if you look at Disney's stock after Lone Ranger/John Carter, they don't really drop as hugely as you would expect after reports of having to take 200M writedowns on those films precisely for the reasons you mentioned, their stand-alone live-action movies are few and fair in between, they have Marvel, Pixar, Disney Animated and Star Wars to cover their asses. Additionally they have their theme parks, merchandising, etc etc so even if/when Tomorrowland fails, it'll be a drop in the bucket for them.  Compare that with Dreamworks where the company is pretty much based solely on movies (and some marginal TV/merchandising) and they only release like 2-3 movies a year (only one in 2015 if memory serves (Home)), and their stock has more volatile reactions to Mr. Peabody and Sherman/Penguins of Madagascar underperforming.  With all that said, yeah man, I thought Tomorrowland would break their streak of Disney live-action originals (not based on prior cartoons) doing badly, but I guess not. Don't know if it'll be a bomb on the level of JC/LR but, I don't think Bob Iger cares too much as Hulk just sneezed and money came out to cover the Tomorrowland writedown"

boxoffice,36yszg,girafa,17,Sat May 23 07:03:33 2015 UTC,I'm interested about the box office because the truth is that movies are the most expensive art from. If they won't make profit the whole industry will collapse. It's as simple as that. For example new Mad Max has 150 million dollar budget plus millions used in marketing. Money is not only thing that matters but If movies stop making money nobody would invest that kind of money to movies.
boxoffice,36yszg,IndyBrodaSolo,8,Sat May 23 07:26:38 2015 UTC,If you consider games an interactive art form I think they beat movies in which is the most expensive. Doesn't take anything away from your point though that it's because movies are expensive to make that their box office is so important

Unfortunately, game sales and $ amounts are data that is sold by the NPD.  The most official data we get is a monthly chart telling us sales rankings of the consoles and a top-10 of individual games.  No numbers or anything with it unfortunately, which is the most interesting part of it.   I think I'm fascinated by box office results because it's interesting to see if something is a success or a failure.  There's no real reasoning for me behind it, it's just interesting to me."

boxoffice,36yszg,ghettothf,1 point,Sat May 23 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I used to follow that site for a while.  But their data is basically estimates, and non-official.  I remember when it first started out, it would get sales numbers from Gamestop employees and prorate based on some sort of formula.  I believe it's better now, but it's still just rough estimates.    NPD used to release sales numbers to the public, but they stopped years ago.  Game sales data is fascinating because it's so hard to gauge whether the general public would embrace games like The Last of Us or the Witcher 3.  It's nice to know if a game will get a sequel."

Plenty of other larger industries would suffer the same fate but we aren't privy to their information and they continue operation. Oil, construction, banking, etc.   For example new Mad Max has 150 million dollar budget plus millions used in marketing   We don't even get to know the actual figures. What was the marketing budget? That isn't reported. There are broad generalizations, but it's guesswork that doesn't apply to all movies. Plus the deals with theater owners, distributors, etc.   Simply put: we aren't even given all of the information needed to know what is or isn't a success. We guess about a lot of it, and even though our data is incomplete we still love to follow the numbers."
boxoffice,36yszg,Dani_Californication,6,Sat May 23 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"It's the ultimate bottom line. If you liked old school action like Mad Max and it does well in the box office, you could expect more movies like it. If it bombed, then no one is probably going to produce a similar movie."
boxoffice,36yszg,Dani_Californication,5,Sat May 23 08:51:55 2015 UTC,Box office results are the best way to predict what kind of movies are going to be made in the future. Not just broad genre trends but which actors or directors will be big names. Seems sort of obvious why that might be of interest to people.
boxoffice,36yszg,Dani_Californication,9,Sat May 23 13:29:45 2015 UTC,"It's fun to follow the major trends and think about the discrepancies and inconsistencies between film outcomes. Why did the wildly successful Winter Soldier, a sequel to an established character and hot off the super successful Avengers, still not outperform GOTG? Did negative word of mouth really derail AoU a notable amount after its opening week, or is it due to superhero fatigue, or competition (F7, PP2, MMFR)?   It's interesting to see how sequels fair. Sometimes word of mouth helps, sometimes a B-grade actor's death leads the upcoming film to nearly double its predecessor's box office and become #4 (close to #3) highest all time BO.   Recently Pitch Perfect 2 made as much in its opening domestic weekend than PP1 did over its entire run.   Part of the reason is it's like rooting for a sport team. People want studios to see that there is a large market for films just like a moderately successful but excellent film. Sometimes others want validation that their film is popular; if not critically, than culturally.    What would change?    Some people will go see a movie just because it's successful. Sometimes the specific numbers don't matter as much but to report that ""This film has made more money than your favourite superhero film"" or ""This film became the new #1 R rated film at the box office of all time"" can persuade people to see it."
boxoffice,36yszg,mrstickball,0,Sat May 23 08:22:47 2015 UTC,"The sports analogy is what I was thinking of. I'm just curious why this industry seems to be more entertaining to track the numbers of instead of, say, the music industry - which tracks albums sold instead of $ made. Why not follow the money in music? Why not follow the money (more religiously) in video games, which cost just as much as movies?"
boxoffice,36yszg,kplo,8,Sat May 23 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"Video game budget isn't really followed, in fact it was seen as odd when GTA V's budget was reported/discussed, but sales definitely are followed quite fanatically.   Over at /r/nintendo or /r/wiiu there are constantly posts about the Wii U's sales, because it's a failing console, or the sales of Nintendo's major games, because those games are extremely well made and important: there's an extreme correlation between Wii U's sold + a game's release and its sales. More so than any other console. Nearly Over half who own a Wii U own Mario Kart 8 because that's an outdated article. That is a a fucking huge attach rate. Wii U sales are 9.5m while MK8 sales are 5.11m.   The wildly successful PS3 had a shitty attach rate. [With over 80m units sold,](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) the highest selling game was 10.7m. The PS3 sold 8x as many units as the fail[ed/ing] Wii U and its best selling games sell barely 2x more?   There's no indication of consistency or quality there. Sometimes sales figures are blatantly ambiguous with the discrepancies of ""units shipped"" vs ""units sold"" still not confirmed to this day. Game sales are an erratic, nonsensical pattern, made even worse by hardware sales and active accounts. Steam don't even release their game sales publicly, apparently have 8.5m+ users on at any given time with about 10-20% of them actually playing games. Some people buy but don't play games. It's a recurring meme and karma grab (and to be fair, an anecdote for many) that they buy a cheap game and never play it. Or even install it. You never hear about people buying a ticket to see a movie, then not going.    I read a bunch of reports about how GTA V breaks $1b in 3 days and lots of people are pleased with GTA V.   An issue with video games is that there are multiple elements: the console ('console wars') and a game itself. A console like the Wii could sell well with only Nintendo games selling well -- because that's what happened, the top 15 selling games/software are by Nintendo, before Ubisoft's Just Dance comes along. The attach rate for the Gamecube was considerably higher than other consoles. The Gamecube was a failure, losing to the new Xbox console. Its games and franchises are still revered despite the poor sales, and it's seen as an underrated gem by game subreddits.   It's more important for a console and game to sell well because, especially in a multiplayer-centric hobby, people need others to play with. They can also share experiences. I can log on to Battlefield 3 right now, but because I got bored of it and never bought DLC, I would have no one to play with except a few overseas people in 500+ ping connections.   All this shit about gaming sales sounds confusing, and that's mostly because it is. There are too many factors with games than movies. The console, the games itself, the sales, how many people actually play it, what are they playing (offline, or online where it requires others)?    In the fairly dissimilar situation that they're in, a game is like a movie, and a console would be like a... theatre. General public don't care about how many theatres a movie releases in, or how many theatres are even open. Studios do, that's why Transformers pandered to the Chinese. But the public care about console sales because it's a vital part of the playing experience.   Movies aren't really the same interactive and shared experience. You can find a Mad Max forum or post in a movie forum ""Who wants to talk about Mad Max?"" and people can respond. You don't need others to watch Mad Max in the same way you literally need others to play a game. Some online games become obsolete due to no players or getting their online network shut down (e.g. Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield 2).   People also seem to focus more on games/console arguments based on hardware and capabilities. Which console has the better hardware, which game has the best graphics? They're the ""sport teams"" many console fans support, as well as sales.       You're right, music is quite different. I think because budget is less of an issue there. It's not a 'thing' in that industry. The music fans/industry focus a on sales, not money made, because they have awards for sales benchmarks, not money benchmarks (which is what the movie business have: all time Box Office, not ticket sales). But their sales operate more on a daily/weekly thing. Same with books. You hear all about books/songs opening and becoming a ""best seller"" but it's based on that day or week. Movies have this with a day and weekend but there's a huge focus on all time, too, because movies don't stay in theatrical release.   I'd say people nowadays, studios and the public, put a huge importance on YouTube views of songs (music videos, audio versions, etc) too, which movies and games can't really take advantage of. But even then, I'd say that most people don't really care about views. Speaking modernly, over the past decade people only really cared about YouTube views (and sales, I guess) to ensure popularity for a song. When it had over 2b views, even Gangnam Style was getting played at parties I went to. Popular songs = played at clubs and parties and people are expected to enjoy it or know it.   Also, the music also has the issue of song vs artist. An artist could have 800 million views on a song, but about 50 thousand on their other stuff. So people recognise the popular song and play it at parties, maybe even listen to it genuinely, but they don't support or indulge in the artist, just the song. I can't really think of the same situation in movies. There are many, many, many artists that have pull because of their name alone in music, while there are very, very, very few who have a similar level of pull in film. People aren't going to see Joss Whedon's Avengers because Joss Whedon is Beyonce and he's releasing his next major work, people are going to see Joss Whedon's Avengers. You can stick any John Doe director onto a Marvel movie and it will succeed. Popular songs aren't guaranteed so one hit wonder songs like Somebody That I Used To Know just... happen. Then you check out Gotye's other videos and their views are quite underwhelming. You could, hypothetically, have someone steal Beyonce's song book, release that stuff herself, and it would likely not succeed, or not as much, because Beyonce isn't releasing it.   The same situation occurs in Hollywood to a lesser extent with some artists (Spielberg, Nolan, Cameron), but I believe word of mouth has a far bigger impact in the film industry. Hearing from word of mouth, there's less commitment to make for a movie (cheaper and shorter than a video game, seen as more social, shorter than an artist's album/discography and may require less repetition to get into properly, sometimes it's cheaper too).      On that note, because films are easier to get into (time, effort, money) than a game or music, it's a lot easier to be a casual fan of the industry. Many will see mostly/only ""blockbusters"" in theatres (whether it's a genre or not is irrelevant), whereas popular music isn't just ""pop"" (arguably the 'blockbuster' of music), it includes a few main genres. So people can't really be just a fan of one type of music, but they can be for movies. Games too, but there are too many other differentiating aspects involved to see it as similar to film."
boxoffice,36yszg,tcatron565,1 point,Sat May 23 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"K. Lots here. Bear with me, as I'm after some trivial understanding of this.  For one, there are a lot of variables to consider about BO just like your examples of video game sales. Number of tickets, 3D, year of its release, choices in media, inflation, etc. So many things to say ""all movies aren't competing on the same playing field.""   You don't need others to watch Mad Max in the same way you literally need others to play a game.   I don't see the difference. If I play Skyrim, people would need to have played Skyrim to talk with me about which Gorgon (or whatever) is best to play as, and if I watch Mad Max users would need to have seen it to discuss it. Or they don't. For both.  If we could break this down into simple lines, I'd say your reasons boil down to ""People want to be able to predict trends""  Is that fair to say?"
boxoffice,36yszg,OtakuMecha,5,Sat May 23 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about variables in cinema however it still dictates popularity towards a film. People still see the film and get all the content. People may buy Halo MCC, but quite literally only half the product works (the offline campaign). 98% of the time it fails to connect online. For almost everyone. People not liking a game/movie is one thing but movies don't have these issues with the video file to every theatre turning black mid-movie.   All movies aren't competing in the same playing field, as all games aren't. Games also have similar variables with pre order bonuses: preorder for $60 to get (in game item)! Pre-order for $75 to get (collectible real world item)! Pre order for $100 to get (in game item + collectible + statuette)!   Sometimes video game sales are tallied through gifts (buy this game and get other game half price; buy this graphics card and get this game free with it).   I think the variables of movies are less diverse than for games. The movies at an IMAX will be big blockbuster movies competing against each other in the first place, based solely on hype (and sometimes technical production eg cameras). Avengers, Hobbit, Interstellar all appear in IMAX. Stuff like Mad Max miiight but it wouldn't have a prolific of a showing there as more popular and accessible films would    I use talk as an example because that's what you do with movies. You watch them with others but that isn't really anything. The point of them is to talk and react. With games, you interact with the game, control the narrative of multiplayer (wins/losses), and you can also react to it.   And with talking about movies, you can do that in person and online. Same with games, but the primary function is playing it. You could watch people play it, many do, but you can't start playing it and indulge in spontaneity if you don't have access to it, or devices to play it. Movies are also easier to acquire, through legal or non-legal means   Destiny was met with middling reviews, but it's an online only multiplayer game I'm pretty sure. It needs sales to function.   People wanting to predict trends is definitely a part of this, but sales matter a lot more for the functionality of games. They're important and serious, and quite unpredictable. People predicted 15m+ units for Wii U after MK8, Smash, Super Mario, etc, which have about 5.1m, 3.2m and 4.0m sales each. Low Wii U sales = 3rd party developers won't make games for it due to likelihood of poor sales.   Supporting movies BO is more fun and lighthearted. IMO, contrary to what most think, 1 outlier successful film of its type won't cause a huge market shift. TDK didn't seem to have any major affect on cinema in or outside of the superhero bubble except for arguably Man of Steel. There's less at stake for 'betting' (not literally) on a movie to fail or succeed. Mortdecai made, what, $12m? It was still available for screening for many weeks around the world. An online-heavy game sells 5-10,000 copies worldwide? Game experience is essentially non-existent or heavily ruined."
boxoffice,36yszg,stoicblunder,2,Sat May 23 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with the music industry is that its extremely disparate. You have singles, radio play, albums, and digital downloads - 4 formats.  Comparatively, the box office has one format: the box office. For example, you don't really see anyone talking about IP residuals from secondary and tertiary revenue streams (DVD sales, digital downloads, toys, TV rights, ect). These revenue streams exist and make money, but the box office is that... The box office.   The problem with the video game industry is that most data is behind the NPD paywall. It costs $10,000/mo to get data for video game sales. I built a company concerning downloadable sales just to get around the paywall. The problem is that the market is so varied, its near-impossible to do a unified report on the market between all the format types out there."

With music, you can follow their chart runs and the trends in the music industry in general. It's just really entertaining to me."

I think it'll do really well with young people, but if random 30-40 year old dudes think it's too kiddy, it might have some trouble. Brad Bird can do no wrong in my book, but this might just be a case of a movie not fitting into any one genre well enough to be a huge hit, especially with recognizable actors only as supporting characters.   That said, I'm cautiously optimistic. I think it'll win the weekend, and it'll be interesting to see if PP2 or Mad Max gets second. I say $43 million for Tomorrowland this weekend, and I think I'd take the over on $150 million domestically."

We've also had well above that number of tickets sell before, but it was a long time ago when ticket prices weren't that high. Gone with the Wind is well over $1 billion domestically when adjusting for ticket prices. In fact, 8 movies are over $1 billion domestically after ticket price adjusting. Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, The Sound of Music, E.T., Titanic, The Ten Commandments, Jaws, and Doctor Zhivago. In fact, Avatar falls all the way from first place to 14th!

The whole point was that long waiting between 1 and 2 doesn't matter so we should only care what T2 made.  T2 made 500 million in box office and it was biggest hit of 1991. My point was that sequel can be successful even after years of waiting.
boxoffice,36sm4e,generaltsao,7,Thu May 21 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it was like a Pitch Perfect situation where it was a small first film that becomes popular after it's theatrical release is usually the only time there's a big jump in sequel revenue. Most movies that earn, say, $400M will likely have a sequel drop. Considering Avatar was basically just there as an effects thing, and because of how long it was in theaters, having a $300M increases would be absolutely ridiculous. That and the original is not even really well liked anymore. Empire Strikes back had like a $400M drop with inflation despite the fact that Star Wars was much more popular and well received."
boxoffice,36sm4e,jburd22,-3,Thu May 21 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, but I still believe in Cameron, because he has track record of raising the bar in sequels. Alien to Aliens, T1 to T2. Avatar 2 might be something completely different from Avatar 1."

boxoffice,36sm4e,BigEye4You,2,Fri May 22 00:01:14 2015 UTC,I think he means raising the bar in terms of box office sales.  The sequels of all those series he listed did better than the originals.
boxoffice,36sm4e,bluecamel2015,2,Fri May 22 03:54:59 2015 UTC,"They're different movies.  Alien was horror/suspense and Aliens was more action.  I happen to prefer Aliens and I know I'm not alone in that.    I respect and enjoy Alien very much, but it mostly comes down to personal preference when you're talking about which movie is better."
boxoffice,36sm4e,satellite_uplink,1 point,Fri May 22 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'd thought that too, that's the right answer of course, but I watched them both in the same day last month and came to find I really like Alien more. It was close. That was a good day."
boxoffice,36sm4e,BigEye4You,14,Fri May 22 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"I highly, HIGHLY, doubt it. I really wish threads like this would go away because I honestly believe that the first film to cross a billion domestic will rather be:  a) a mega hit sequel that comes 20-30 years down the line that just makes alot due to inflation, or  b) a completely new film that blows everyone's fucking minds  Making a billion domestic is an almost impossible feat and requires the movie to appeal to all 4 quadrants, have INSANE legs, have lot's of re-watch value, and be ""worth"" seeing on the big screen. If you look at the films of the last 30 years, the only one that would have done so was Titanic.   Not only do I think that Avatar 2 won't cross 1 bil domestic, I also believe it has little chance of reaching the first ones domestic/international haul.   Sequels to Mega hits never make as much as the last because the mega hits were the exception. Avatar 2 won't beat the first for the same reason Avengers 2 won't beat it's predecessor.   As for the Force Awakens, it's still a wild card, but I also highly doubt that it will become the highest grossing film of all time."
boxoffice,36sm4e,overstuffedham,7,Thu May 21 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. Honestly it is still puzzling on how Avatar made 2.7 billion. Not because I am saying it was bad/good....it is just still a mystery how a film could make that much money. China's box office has EXPLODED since Avatar 1 came out and is 90% of the reason so many films make 1 billion anymore.  Even with China's box office exploding to where it is today....almost nobody expects any film to make 2.7 billion. SOME people were wondering if AuO would make 2.7 billion but very few even considering it in the realm of possibility. A1 was a hit in every major market, shattered opening weekends all over the globe, and had awesome legs, had high 3d and Imax viewings and yet made 1.5 billion. Compared to Avengers 1 and Avatar Avengers had all the advantages 1) Avengers was more well received by critics 2) More well received by viewers (This is up for debate but I think I still give the nod to Avengers here) 3) Ticket prices were higher than when Avatar was released 4) The amount out of 3-d theaters that can charge more is WAY higher (I'd guess 2-3x higher) when Avengers came out then Avatar.  Yet Avatar earned over 1.2 billion more than Avengers.  It goes to show you that 'legs' CAN make a difference. Even with the effect of 'strong legs' Avatar is an still just weird as shit. Looking at the breakdowns in ticker prices, box office receipts, lack of 3d capable theaters, etc. etc it makes NO sense that Avatar made that much money.  I went on a tangent there but I just think Avatar's box office run is super underappreciated.  I have a hard time believing any film today can make 1 billion domestic. That would have to be a film that is a true ""YOU MUST GO SEE THIS! IT IS GONE WITH THE WIND IN THE 21ST CENTURY!!"" type film with VERY little competition for many months to give it incredible legs. Even then I just cannot see any film cracking 1 billion in the US."
boxoffice,36sm4e,prepend,2,Fri May 22 01:45:46 2015 UTC,Honestly it is still puzzling on how Avatar made 2.7 billion.   Which is why I find all the people in this thread saying the sequel won't make anywhere near that amount laughable. They don't even know how the first did what it did. Cameron is a box office magician. I see no reason to doubt him.
boxoffice,36sm4e,overstuffedham,2,Fri May 22 17:14:02 2015 UTC,Cameron is a box office magician.   Without question. You could claim Titanic was just a fluke but he pulled off that magic again.  I honestly have no idea how he does but he does it.
boxoffice,36sm4e,mrstickball,-1,Fri May 22 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason it made that much is the accounting process, which saw box office include the price of the 3D glasses.  That won't be true for avatar 2."
boxoffice,36sm4e,BigEye4You,2,Fri May 22 07:06:06 2015 UTC,which saw box office include the price of the 3D glasses.   Do you have a source on this?
boxoffice,36sm4e,kplo,7,Fri May 22 17:06:16 2015 UTC,The first movie made so much money because of the 3D alone. This was the first film to really use 3D well and since then we've had multitudes of films doing 3D post production. Unless the writing and story become insanely better I don't see it coming anywhere near.
boxoffice,36sm4e,Jon-Osterman,4,Thu May 21 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"We really haven't had any other good 3D movies. If Avatar 2 outdoes the 3D in the first one, it could do quite well.  Isn't he filming in high frame rate? Perhaps that could be done better than the Hobbits."

boxoffice,36sm4e,HobbieK,4,Fri May 22 17:14:21 2015 UTC,"It won't. Avatar was a perfect storm in terms of box office return, and it almost certainly won't make more than the first. We're plateauing when it come to technological advancements in film (something like HFR is actually bemoaned by a lot of moviegoers), and it's not likely the next film will have free reign over nearly 2 months of releases, since studios are finally realizing that a film can make money nearly any time of the year."
boxoffice,36sm4e,ghettothf,0,Fri May 22 02:05:51 2015 UTC,it almost certainly won't make more than the first   I personally disagree. Doubting James Cameron is never a smart move.

boxoffice,36sm4e,Shruth1,2,Fri May 22 02:53:01 2015 UTC,"ITT: A lot of people who underestimate James Cameron.  I won't say it's impossible, but James Cameron is probably the only person who could do it.  Both Titanic and Avatar had something special going for them, but it was certainly not the quality of the movie.    Titanic had the aura of being the most expensive movie ever made at the time.  That spiked curiosity, which led to a good opening weekend at the time, and word of mouth went out across to all the women about its love story, which gave it legs.  Avatar had the aura of having the best 3D for a movie.  Even my parents and other people who never even watch movies in the theater went to see this movie.  Word got around about how technically amazing the movie was, and gave this movie legs.    So people seem to judge Avatar 2 based on the quality of Avatar 1 as a film.  This is the wrong type of thinking.  If Avatar 2 does something more advanced technologically than any other movie, word will get around about that feat alone, and that will drive ticket sales past opening weekend.    So what if, Avatar 2 does something like having actual humanoid robots or some shit act in the movie.  The film itself could be total shit, but people will just see it for the humanoid robots.    So while 1 billion is likely far fetched, I'm not going to say it's impossible."

It was its visuals, which at the time were unheard of and beautifully spectacular. It was also at the start of the 3D trend. Since then, 3D has been done to death, and movie after movie has used and expanded on the techniques Avatar used. Cameron is going to have to bring it hard with the visuals to bring in that same hype again.  Avatar 2 will likely follow in Avengers: Age of Ultron's path. Still a box office success, but will not surpass the original."

Especially when it's coming off of lackluster prequels.  Star Wars must have played forever back then, and likely had more than one re-release. Now, the market is more crowded, and everyone will be able to own TFA like 5 months after the movie hits theaters. The entire box office situation is just much different these days."

It's not impossible if you make movie that appeals to people universally and not just to young geeks. That's why Titanic made so much money.

Are we seeing the effects of positive WOM or is this due more to demographic differences (a younger PP2 audience busy with school during the week perhaps?)
boxoffice,36pibb,shangri--LA,7,Thu May 21 23:21:14 2015 UTC,"It's common for niche films because you have the core audience run out opening weekend (especially Friday night) to go see it. Horror films are another great example - awesome weekends and then see a drastic decline.   Some young people are out for summer so it's a little different now. Plus, Mad Max had very strong reviews and amazing word of mouth, so that's helping it decline less than it should."

boxoffice,36nupm,pajamalamaobama,8,Wed May 20 23:56:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he was even asked to direct MI5. They've made it a point to have a different director for every film, with the intent that each film should have a unique identity.  I do think Bird is worried, and that has played into his somewhat early commitment (relative to his new film's opening) to Incredibles 2."
boxoffice,36nupm,Skyhooks,3,Thu May 21 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"Scott Mendelson of Forbes (correctly) noted it's the same thing that happened to Neil Blomkamp earlier this year. Once the negative buzz about Chappie started coming out, he suddenly announces his next project, keeping himself in the public eye and at least somewhat detached from bad press if the movie underperformed.  Chappie's going to end its run in China barely doubling its budget, which isn't a total failure but not what Sony wanted, which I think is what happens with Tomorrowland as well. It'll do decent numbers, but it won't do enough to warrant its budget (I see a $350 million WW final gross or so, as San Andreas and Spy will chip away at its holds before Jurassic World fucking destroys all comers in three weeks)."
boxoffice,36nupm,lrrpkd,2,Thu May 21 01:18:10 2015 UTC,"I think San Andreas will be a sleeper hit. Is there much marketing in the US for it? In Australia I've seen the posters and a trailer at the cinemas but besides that marketing is non-existent. Mad Max has been marketed like crazy here for months, and for obvious reasons."

I'm guessing The Force Awakens should be a near lock for it as I think it'll stay number one from its release on December 17th to at least January 29th when Kung Fu Panda 3 comes out.  Edit: Looking closer at the release schedule, maybe Ride Along 2 could dethrone Star Wars on January 15th. The original Ride Along had an opening weekend of over $40 million last January."
boxoffice,36o86y,JakkuScavenger,2,Wed May 20 22:34:19 2015 UTC,"If the cards play out right, it's possible that it could go for 5 straight weekends at #1. It's going to have a mammoth performance, one that can even sustain after an extraordinary opening weekend. Word-of-mouth will play a part in whether it sits on top for that long though.  It's kinda because even Ride Along 2 can't really eat that much into the hype the way MM4 and PP2 were able to eat into the Avengers' box office pie."

boxoffice,36lt9r,wingzero00,5,Wed May 20 09:38:56 2015 UTC,Domestically I'm starting to doubt it will crack $500 millions and that it will probably come closer to $450 million.  Insanely massive numbers but I imagine Disney will still be disappointed with them given that the first Avengers did $623 million.
boxoffice,36lt9r,Dorkside,2,Wed May 20 18:13:22 2015 UTC,$450 domestic would be a pretty big miracle. It would need to make another $70 million to get there and it is really only 1-2 weeks left to do that. It will probably be 4th or 5th at the boxoffice this weekend.  $425 is probably the best bet. It is going to end right around $200 less than A1 US.
boxoffice,36lt9r,bluecamel2015,0,Wed May 20 20:05:36 2015 UTC,Extremely unlikely. It would need to do nearly the same amount it did the LAST 7 days if not little more. Not going to happen.
boxoffice,36lt9r,bluecamel2015,-1,Sun May 24 16:36:06 2015 UTC,I did do the math. Something you should of down. It will need to earn another 15 million Tuesday-Sunday. It is its 5th week and getting that 15 million this week is not going to be easy so it will NOT be 'EASILY' there.

boxoffice,36lt9r,bluecamel2015,10,Mon May 25 17:10:22 2015 UTC,Yes.    Literally anyone can do that.
boxoffice,36lt9r,RDandersen,2,Mon May 25 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"adjusted for inflation, it's moving at the same rate as the Dark Knight Rises (which seems a very appropriate relation), and if it continues on that path it could end north of 470 mil domestic. However, DKR performed mostly in August against basically nothing where Avengers has a lot of competition this weekend and will be battling leftovers next. A total of 425 is guaranteed at this point, so I think it will finish in the 435-450 range. 450 is it's bar for success in the upcoming weeks. Still no small feet."
boxoffice,36lt9r,jburd22,2,Mon May 25 17:58:19 2015 UTC,Did that 18 days ago.
boxoffice,36lt9r,PrettyFkinFarFromOK,2,Mon May 25 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"With Friday #s just coming out, one can lock down a few things, I think.  Domestically, as of Friday (22nd), AoU is at $388.5m, and is likely to end up with about $410m by the end of the long weekend (or about a $21m weekend).  Assuming 50% drops from here on out, you're looking at about another $30m for its run, or about $440m domestically. But I would say that's the ""Low end"" because the movie is starting to have better weekend holds. The closest comparison may be The Dark Knight Rises, which made about $50m after this same frame, with 30-45% drops each week. So the higher end of the spectrum is probably about $460m domestically.  Internationally, its a little harder to say, because we don't know AoU's 2nd week gross in China. It could be anywhere from $60m (really bad drop) to $100m (really good drop) with a median value of $80m.   By the end of this week, AoU is probably looking at about $1,300m worldwide. I'd anticipate 50% weekly drops from here on out from about $150m in revenues this week. For the sake of argument, we'd also need to include Japan ($40-50m).   So in the end, you'd be looking at:   Domestic: $440 - $460m USD International: $1,050 - $1,200m USD Total: $1,490 - $1,660m   Median value, I would say is probably close to $1,550m USD.. Just enough to let it beat out The Avengers."

In Australia your doing good if you hit the late teen's or 20's depending on the movie but that's the general ball park area for your average movie. In 2015 Furious 7 is number 1 with $33 mil and that's over performing, next is avengers with $27 mil big difference compared to China and the US"
boxoffice,36iqvg,6373billy,1 point,Fri May 22 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"It's not so much a sequel I don't think for Mad Max but actual action movies to be properly done like what fury road has done with a R rating. It's become a rare thing to find in action movies nowadays what fury road has done with the wide shot's of action with no shaky cam, an actual good story with actual interesting characters that get developed whilst having intense adrenaline action scenes combined with a terrific atmosphere set by george miller with a R rating. It should do well at the box office to change the dying (in my opinion) action genre. Look at the Taken sequels the third expendables and so on all crap and what's taking it's place is PG-13 rated comic book movies (I like comic book movies and not hating on them but I also like diversity in movies)."
boxoffice,36iqvg,6373billy,10,Fri May 22 13:52:37 2015 UTC,A lot of people want Mad Max to succeed to show the viability of R rated action films.
boxoffice,36iqvg,mi-16evil,1 point,Tue May 19 21:58:40 2015 UTC,Isn't this already what 90% of the action films are rated? At least the ones I watch are... I think. Now you've got me wondering... thanks for the reply.
boxoffice,36iqvg,ahighone,7,Tue May 19 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised how many movies are actually for 12 years and older. In some cases it's okay, like Fast Furious series. But movies like Mad Max and Expendables (I'm looking at you, part 3)... They really should be rated R."
boxoffice,36iqvg,Dcornelissen,4,Tue May 19 23:06:20 2015 UTC,"No. The vast majority are PG-13. There are, maybe, 4 R-rated action movies that have grossed over $500 million worldwide."
boxoffice,36iqvg,mrstickball,4,Wed May 20 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"Isn't this already what 90% of the action films are rated?   I don't have hard numbers on this, but I'm going to say no. No way in hell that this is the case. Overwhelmingly, they're PG-13."
boxoffice,36iqvg,Zeno84,8,Wed May 20 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Obviously, each movie should be judged on it's own merits (budget, rating, etc.), but movies can often be unfairly criticized for not ""winning"".  For example, any number of sensationalistic headlines like ""Mad Max 'Pitch"" Slapped at the Box Office"" or ""PP2 Makes 'Mad Max: Fury Road'-kill"".  It can create competitive animosity between the fans of each movie, which can seem especially absurd when the two films are in completely different genres like this.    The bottom line is fans of this series and movies like this just want to make sure there is incentive for films like this to be made.  Pitch Perfect 2 is just a perceived obstacle in the way of making that happen."
boxoffice,36iqvg,vadid37,0,Tue May 19 19:53:28 2015 UTC,So then I would be justified in saying that this makes little to no difference even if I am a fan of the genre/franchise since all it really takes is someone to greenlight it without caring about this particular weekend head to head?
boxoffice,36iqvg,ahighone,2,Tue May 19 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"In a society of common sense and reason, this would be the proper approach.  I think realistically, it will come down to whether or not Mad Max makes more than ""x"" dollars (the x decided by the studio of course).  If it surpasses that sweet spot, then none of this will ever matter.  If it barely does the business necessary, then I could see where negative media spin on perceived box office losses to other movies would be considered.  In this instance, I think critical response (including potential award season recognition) will negate any of that.    In my opinion, Max will make his money one way or another.  While there is nothing wrong with enjoying its successes along the way, we're really way too early in the process for hand wringing or lamenting it's lack of appeal to general audiences and teenage girls."
boxoffice,36iqvg,vadid37,2,Tue May 19 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"I think the success bar will be whether this film breaks 150 mil domestic (make back it's budget back state-side; this does not include marketing). I think at this point, a worldwide total of 400 mil is easily in range, and if the film passes both of these barriers I think it will be considered a ""hit"" by the studios/press."
boxoffice,36iqvg,jburd22,2,Tue May 19 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"It is a 100% case of just playing favorites. There's no reason to compare the two films, other than the fact they released on the same day. They're different genres, different audiences, and operate on two different scales. Of COURSE PP2 will win that first weekend. It's just not a contest.  On that note, Mad Max will probably out-gross Pitch Perfect 2 over its' lifetime. That's my personal prediction."
boxoffice,36iqvg,Mushroomer,2,Wed May 20 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"It's much more important that Mad Max holds up well and/or wins ant sort of box office battle against PP2 because of its $150+ budget. Its important for its prospects sequel or sequels (it's pretty likely at this point).  Pitch Perfect 2 made tons more on only a fraction of the budget of Mad Max. Pitch Perfect 3 is all but inevitable. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a Fat Amy spin-off movie as well. These low-to-medium size budget female-driven comedies/dramas have little down side and tremendous profit potential. Like The Fault in our Stars' spiritual successor ""Paper Towns"" by John Green was green lit pretty much on Fault's opening Friday.  So, yeah. Any sort of Mad Max win against PP2 is huge for the studio."
boxoffice,36iqvg,bipolarbearsRAWR,2,Wed May 20 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"Mad Max doing well makes movies like it more viable. If it has to beat out PP to do that, then so be it."

boxoffice,36iqvg,AnusOfSpeed,9,Tue May 19 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"weell not to be the one ruining the party, but if we count the per theaters average Pitch Perfect is still going stronger.  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?view=1day&sortdate=2015-05-18&sort=theateravg&order=DESC&p=.htm  And honestly I think the rivalry it's stupid, and a lot of people have taken too seriously titles like ""Max Pitch-Slapped"" etc. They target audience it's almost opposite, and they are not competing (I am sorry AMC crew, but your story that girls bring boys to see PP2 and so they couldn't see Mad Max it's not so relevant)  Let's look at facts:  PP2 bringing 112 m$ its first weekend is incredible, they are probably already making profit. You can't deny it.  Mad Max started good, but not really THAT good. It will have an incredible word of mouth, and it will surelly make is money back, but we are talking about a 150 m$ production, plus enormous advertising, so you just can't compare the stakes of PP2 production to the Mad Max one."
boxoffice,36iqvg,Maso_del_Saggio,5,Tue May 19 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"BUT...the only reason the count per theaters for PP2 is higher is because it's on fewer screens, so mathematically, the average goes up anyways.  Regardless, yes, it's stupid to compare because they are two films in two different genres. However, if the press (and to an extent the public) are going to turn this into a contest, why not play along? It's important, anyways, for MM to make it's money back and pave the road for not only a sequel, but more high quality films in this vein.  With that being said, I disagree with you comment, because considering it's genre and considering that MM is rate R, it started phenomenally well. Had it been PG-13, numbers would have been different - guaranteed."
boxoffice,36iqvg,Maso_del_Saggio,1 point,Wed May 20 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"Have an unpvote for the kind disagreement.  Any way about your first point, that's exactly the deal: making more money in more theaters is ""easier"", so, even though WB couldn't care less about averages, if we want to talk about word of mouth or general public success I think the averages are a better indicator of the performances. Remember that expansion or decrease of the number of theaters is based on averages, not absolute values.  So let's take a deeper look at your point about the incredible R rated performance:   http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/mpaa.htm?page=R&sort=opengross&order=DESC&p=.htm  Mad Max is 21st, so no doubt a really good result, but certainly not a record. Let's look at averages: it becomes the 54th result ever, surpassed by the kind of Lucy, Gone Girl, 300 Rise of an Empire, Lone Survivor, Neighbours, The Conjuring etc.  So really, it has still a lot to demonstrate. And I believe it will, this weekend. I am just saying that right now I am not seeing numbers that are incredible, for a movie that had the widest opening week release ever for a R rated movie  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/widestmpaa.htm?page=R&p=.htm"

boxoffice,36iqvg,jburd22,4,Tue May 19 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"I think a closer comparison would be Interstellar. Both opened in 2nd against a more family friendly film, had a 5 mil monday and were in the same range weekend wise. Mad Max also has better word of mouth so I don't think this film making 190 mil domestic is out of the question. I don't think it would do this as it is in the summer (fall movies have better legs), but 190 is definately possible. I think this movie will likely end in the 160-180 range."
boxoffice,36iqvg,JamesHouse,3,Tue May 19 21:03:04 2015 UTC,Combined with international numbers I'd say that would be a big success

boxoffice,36gmjc,coldermilk,3,Tue May 19 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Studio was very clever on a release strategy.  They opened it on 4 screens, then the following weekend expanded to 32, then 1200 and topped out at 1600.  The buzz around the film let them expand without a huge marketing budget.  They will also clean up on DVD/VOD."
boxoffice,36gmjc,tcatron565,1 point,Tue May 19 12:18:13 2015 UTC,Which is quite interesting as that studio has never had a wide release before.
boxoffice,36gmjc,mrstickball,7,Tue May 19 15:23:39 2015 UTC,Mad Max finished stronger on Sunday and Pitch Perfect finished weaker then the two studios had predicted.  Pitch was about $1m less and Max was $1m higher then studio estimates based on the Friday openings and it looks like word of mouth and good reviews will ensure Max overtakes Pitch this week.
boxoffice,36gmjc,GoldandBlue,2,Tue May 19 12:09:48 2015 UTC,"Even then, early estimates (see: Friday morning) estimated MMFR at around $41m, whereas it ended about 10% higher. That bodes really well for the movie."

Gone Girl did $160M domestic and over $300M worldwide, Lucy was a wholly original R rated property that made almost half a billion ($458M) Mad Max is already at over $110M in its debut and still has a ways to go. Perhaps this will begin the end of studios neutering their films. There is a very big audience for R rated films. Adults like seeing movies too, you know."
boxoffice,36g6qq,mardfet,2,Tue May 19 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  I'm so glad Warner Bros. released this as an R-rating. They could have easily cut out a minute or so of violent, suggestive imagery, dubbed over a few of the swears and gotten a PG-13. Saving the director's cut for the home video release.  It's great they held back from doing do and it's equally great that audiences have responded so well to this film getting released without any MPAA multiple submission kung fu going on."
boxoffice,36g6qq,coldermilk,12,Tue May 19 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"Glad it did well.   I was anxious for the movie till I saw the trailer and it focused purely on the road and cars and really put me off a bit.  It showed 0 plot and really those chasing scenes are in 2 parts of the movie.  They are cool, but the plot is what makes the movie awesome, the chase scenes are the adrenaline boaster part.  Went to see it an it's AWESOME!!  Much better than I even hoped, but the trailer doesn't do it justice."
boxoffice,36g6qq,DeepRoast,7,Tue May 19 10:38:32 2015 UTC,"What's funny is that I've heard the film described as ""a 2-hour car chase"" but it wasn't a negative critique, quite the opposite actually. I've also had one person completely trash it because of a total lack of plot. It's nice to read your reply and see that's not a consensus opinion.    I don't know man, I'm just super excited to see it - and with a strong international opening with $64M, I expect there'll be more to come."
boxoffice,36g6qq,tokomini,11,Tue May 19 13:57:17 2015 UTC,"The plot is quite good. They basically explain the world/why things are the way they are in between the chases. Its not an in-depth speech or anything, but you do begin to understand the world of Mad Max more and more during the movie."
boxoffice,36g6qq,mrstickball,3,Tue May 19 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"The 2 hour car chase, was what I was afraid of due to the trailer. That was ALL they shown.   In a way the movie is wrapped around this ""chase"" but doesn't say why, where they are going, why they are going there and who.   The plot isn't the chase so much as the characters and their journey (no spoilers).   The chase is just the by-product of the plot and source of cool actions scenes.   Edit:  No spoilers, but come back after you seen it.  I REALLY hope there are more movies, and well lol go see it already! Afraid to say more, especially ending."
boxoffice,36g6qq,DeepRoast,6,Tue May 19 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"Another example of Hollywood revamping a decades-old property, giving it to the original director who hasn’t been all-that-relevant in ages, casting a hot young flavor of the month actor...

It has better word of mouth, re-watchability and critical appeal.  I'd expect Fury Road to do Matrix like numbers domestically and only drop about 20% over each of the next weekends and hang in the top 10 for a good 10 weeks.  Pitch Perfect 2 will likely see a 45%-55% drop. There's no audience discovery going on here. People know what they were getting and all went out to see it opening weekend.

You can rent a private screening of a current or non-current movie for a few hundo. Always love catching films there.

We also receive free ICEEs when we make per cap for the week. The biggest perk is free movies. The stipulation there is there has to be at least one paying customer seeing the movie as well, and we have to wait a week after the movie's release. For example, I can't get into Pitch Perfect 2, Mad Max: Fury Road, or When Hope Grows for free, but I can see anything else we're playing (which at the moment only includes Avengers: Age of Ultron and Hot Pursuit). We have eight screens, but two are being used for Pitch Perfect, and two each are being used for 2D and 3D versions of Avengers and Mad Max."

Great staff that you can tell actually love movies. I love reserved seating so i don't have to worry about getting there early and fight with crowds for a good seat to see Avengers. They always have smaller, independent, or art house films that usually arent carried at AMC or other big chains. They have Arclight Presnts screening multiple times in the week so you can rewatch classics on the big screen. 21+ screenings for drinking. They also have a bar if you wanna grab a drink before your movie starts. Plus The Dome which is huge and there is nothing like watching a movie like Interstellar or Mad Max there. The crowd is also great, outside of cheers and ahhs, people know to shut the fuck up and turn their phones off. Its like everyone is in on the experience. And it is across the street from Amoeba, which i know is not really about the theater but c'mon, its Amoeba."

boxoffice,367tze,mannymix03,1 point,Sun May 17 06:49:13 2015 UTC,I just think its because they are a specialty theater. I think Alamo is also regular price in the morning. But ive actually never been to either in the morning.
boxoffice,367tze,SchottGun,3,Sun May 17 08:18:01 2015 UTC,"I work at a 16 screen Carmike in South Georgia. It's not the best but it is pretty acceptable in slightly above broad terms. We get to watch films as early as the Sunday afternoon after they premiere. Free popcorn and drinks including ICEE...sometimes, I preview the films if they havent been q screened yet. I mainly just work with promotions, standees, posters, marquees, etc. The management does pretty well with incentives and such...like $150 rewards for top selling this or that or having special screenings just for employees. We do regular, caramel, and cheddar popcorn. Also, we sell hot dogs, nachos, pizza, pretzels, name brand candy along with cotton candy. We are playing Mad Max, Avengers, Pitch 2, Home, Furious 7, Longest Ride, Hot Pursuit, Age of Adaline, Paul Blart 2, and Unfriended but we do have alot of limted releases at times too. We just lost It Follows, Woman in Gold, Ex Machina, Little Boy, D Train within the past month. Since we are in the town where Sherwood (Courageous, Fireproof, Facing the Giants, etc.) resides, we get along of local Christian stuff. Staff is bleh....alot dont care and just see it as a job. My town isnt full of crazy die hard fans or whatever. People get advanced tix the day of and only show up an hour before showtime...the big sellers are teen stuff and religious stuff here. Everything thing else remains stable and consistent where as those genres boom and then fall hard. My favorite theater to visit is in Orlando....they have a 4 story tall IMAX!!"

The service is great, the Sony 4k projectors are awesome (I wish it had an Imax but the building is just too small) it's a full restaurant/bar. Reserved seating and strict rules, I once saw a guy get kicked out and the manager was waiting at the door of the theater to personally apologize."

There's a full wine and beer bar, and instead of regular hot dogs they have brats and sausages, and still do free flavored ppcorn powder. Kinda small, only 7 screens I think. I think they have two ATMOS auditoriums and are showing Mad Max, Avengers, PP2, and another one I'm not too sure about. Movies are $11.25 and $8.75 for matinee,  but I think their matinee cut-off is 4p, which is kind of lame. I go there a lot. I joined the rewards program and just try to rack up points!"

boxoffice,368j1s,stateofdaniel,12,Sun May 17 05:06:20 2015 UTC,"B+ isn't bad.  But also Mad Max is a little weird and very stylized, so it's not going to be to everyone's tastes."
boxoffice,368j1s,Fripples,1 point,Sun May 17 06:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those people, I didn't think the movie was bad or anything but it just wasn't quite what I expected. It felt a little disjointed at times and it seemed like the action never quite got as insane as I thought.   Like it got close several times but always pulled back and calmed down before the action really got to a crescendo.   The easiest example of this was with the Guitar guy on the awesome war vehicle. Several times I thought he was just about the bust into an epic shredfest that would accompany the action on screen, only for his audio to trail off when the camera changed to a different character.   I thought visually the movie was amazing, very creative and distinct characters and everything felt very grounded in the universe."
boxoffice,368j1s,ButchTheKitty,1 point,Mon May 18 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"Cinemascore is weird. Plenty of stuff unrelated to the movie can affect the grade. If the movie is too long, or the music too loud, or there's too much violence, or too little, or the campaign misrepresented the tone of the movie, or the movies themes were not in the zeitgeist... all that will lower the score."
boxoffice,368j1s,Go_Arachnid_Laser,-4,Fri May 22 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"So I'm really hoping that Mad Max does well for a few reasons:   The movie was fucking epic. Miller and company need to make more movies, so BO needs to be stellar. Hollywood needs to learn to make better quality movies like MM. The movie was fucking epic.   Just wondering why you think the CinemaScore is so low??? I'm concerned cause word of mouth is critical to this having long legs. Do you think the MRAs are giving poor reviews and it's skewing the results? It doesn't make sense, especially considering Rotten Tomatoes...  Anyone???"
boxoffice,368j1s,chrisychris-,8,Sun May 17 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure about this sites credibility, but B+ is above average almost reaching excellent. Not sure why you think this constitutes as poor?"
boxoffice,368j1s,GuitarWarrior,2,Sun May 17 06:17:40 2015 UTC,"I think stateofdaniel is wondering why MM is a B+ while other recent movies that scored far lower in critical scores on other sites (Age of Adeline, Age of Ultron, Pitch Perfect 2, and surprisingly Chappie) got either higher or similar scores.  I'm not sure I'd trust this site though. Not knowing anything about it beforehand, their claims of being an ""industry leader in measuring movie appeal"" doesn't seem to be supported by their lack of fans on the twitter and facebook pages they link to. They don't seem to give scores lower than C's; reading up on how they score, it seems all of their scores are the averages of audience reviews at select locations on opening night. It also looks like they factor whether or not people buy DVDs. At least it looks like that on their scorecard.   So: in comparison to other CinemaScores, I guess MM's is relatively low. But not really. If I had to guess, I'd say that this score measures the general appeal of a movie, not how good a movie is. Its not too much of a stretch to say people in general would enjoy a light-hearted movie about a cappella singers more than a movie about violence and slavery in the apocalypse.   I don't really see why this one site's score matters in comparison to the rest of them. It is, after all, one of the highest rated movies of the year on RottenTomatoes, currently #25 on IMDB's Top 250 and #19 on Letterboxd's Top 250. It definitely has the support of old and new fans of the series. I wouldn't be worried about it making back its budget and then some."
boxoffice,368j1s,JakkuScavenger,3,Sun May 17 06:40:28 2015 UTC,"Cinemascores is an exit poll. They ask people what grade they give the movie (A, B, C, D or F) after watching it and also gather their demographics."
boxoffice,368j1s,FrontRowSteve,0,Sun May 17 12:17:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it is a tad surprising. Have you seen the incredible social media buzz, the raving critic reviews, and the explosive praise/positivity in general for this film? I'm really surprised it's not an A."
boxoffice,368j1s,lestranger92,-1,Sun May 17 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"B+ is lower than you think.. It basically says people got what they thought it was going to be or they hated it. I have seen it twice with two different large groups. It was either hate or love, no in between. CinemaScores have a whole bias built into them. The grades are not like school grades. An A is really really fucking good. A- is great. B+ is good. B is meh. B- is not good. Anything below is terrible terrible terrible. On a 100 point scale, this grade would be like low to mid 80s. They need to get rid of the letter grades because they send the wrong message.  Mad Max is a great action film, but it is not a masterpiece that some people are claiming."
boxoffice,368j1s,Vic_tron,6,Sun May 17 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"Are you saying it isn't a masterpiece just because some people don't like it, or because you personally don't like it? If it's your personal opinion then that's fine, but judging a film's actual worth based off of a Cinemascore rating would be utterly ridiculous."
boxoffice,368j1s,purofan,-6,Sun May 17 19:53:41 2015 UTC,Why do you care about other peoples opinions when it seems you've already made your own at this point?
boxoffice,368j1s,Honestmonster,5,Sun May 17 07:33:44 2015 UTC,Because it influences many people's decision to watch or not watch the movie which in turn determines weather a movie gets a sequel or not. I love the Lone Ranger but so many people hated it that it will never get the sequels that were originally planned. And it pisses me off.
boxoffice,368j1s,HobbieK,2,Sun May 17 08:17:37 2015 UTC,Everything about the Lone Ranger was terrific except for Johnny Depp.

boxoffice,3664ok,kplo,7,Sat May 16 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"Im not worried about Mad Max at all. It exceeded projections (so did PP) which is a positive sign, and everyone from critics to celebrities to average joes are gushing about it. Word of mouth will probably keep its weekend 2 numbers pretty high as well.                      Plus you have international still and add to that the fact that WB is desperate for a new franchise and loves Miller and Hardy. Unless it doesnt make another cent, the movie will be seen as a success."
boxoffice,3664ok,GoldandBlue,5,Sun May 17 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, looking at tracking in the last 2 days made me think the ceiling for PP2 was upper 50s. Not really surprised as the buzz for this film had been building for a looong time and there was genuine excitement among male and females.  40M is solid for MM (more important imo is its hold the next 3-4 weeks) but i'm rooting for it to hit mid-40s if not even upper-40s"
boxoffice,3664ok,ItsBobDoleYo,23,Sat May 16 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"God this sucks. I don't mean to hate on Pitch Perfect, I'm sure it's an ok movie, but Fury Road is an instant classic and a huge game changer for the action genre and we need more movies to go this big."
boxoffice,3664ok,BenjaminTalam,27,Sat May 16 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"You'd have to be foolish to assume Mad Max would win this weekend against PP2. It's a PG-13 comedy with a huge pre-built fanbase, against an R-rated action sequel trying to revive a dead franchise.   Mad Max doing $40M or above is a great preformance. Especially since it'll likely have a long tail as the following weeks pass.   Shit, I imagine there are plenty of kids who bought tickets to Pitch Perfect 2, then walked into Mad Max"
boxoffice,3664ok,Mushroomer,21,Sat May 16 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"A $41 million opening weekend is nothing to be ashamed of for Fury Road. Also, given its strong word of mouth it seems likely it will have better legs than most summer blockbusters."
boxoffice,3664ok,Dorkside,10,Sat May 16 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"It will also probably do amazing overseas. I remember how Waterworld was a huge joke in the US as one of the biggest bombs, but it did pretty well globally."
boxoffice,3664ok,Roller_ball,10,Sat May 16 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you mention Waterworld. My sister andBrother in law totally adore this movie. I've been trying to pitch Mad Max to them as ""Waterworld with Sand instead of Water"". Question to some people that have already seen Fury Road: is this accurate?"
boxoffice,3664ok,holocarst,8,Sat May 16 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"Well it's at least kind of accurate I think. I don't remember Waterworld having guitar-flamethrowers or breastmilking-machines, but it has been a while since I saw it."
boxoffice,3664ok,MasonJoody,7,Sat May 16 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, Waterworld was basically The Road Warrior on water, so absolutely."
boxoffice,3664ok,fullblownaydes2,3,Sat May 16 21:45:42 2015 UTC,Basically 100% accurate. Even the first shot is the same with them looking off in the distance then eating/drinking something gross.
boxoffice,3664ok,Roller_ball,6,Sun May 17 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. Some points to add:  -This is an R rated film.  -Yes, the movie is a classic in most of the world, maybe more than in the US.  -Regardless of box office, this film will be big in home release."
boxoffice,3664ok,kplo,2,Sat May 16 21:16:08 2015 UTC,41 million is a bigger gross than the entire runs of every other Mad Max movie.
boxoffice,3664ok,mythmaster,7,Sun May 17 11:07:30 2015 UTC,This is only the second day. I'm sure PP2 has such a big crowd because they've already got a big fan base. Plenty of time for Mad Max to make money.
boxoffice,3664ok,tkeiy714,6,Sat May 16 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"I loved Mad Max: Fury Road, but it is in no way a 'game changer', even if it does really well. There is no aspect to it that could immediately be applied to other movies in a good way.  I don't want more movies to be more bloated in action. Also, most directors really don't have the talent to pull of the creative elements the George Miller put into it."
boxoffice,3664ok,Roller_ball,1 point,Sat May 16 19:25:37 2015 UTC,Can I ask why you think that? It looks like the average action movie to me.
boxoffice,3664ok,legalbeagle05,11,Sat May 16 23:40:38 2015 UTC,God damnit I'm gonna pissed at America if Mad Max doesn't make a solid earning.
boxoffice,3664ok,BatmanDavey1986,14,Sat May 16 16:37:29 2015 UTC,It's tracking to have an opening weekend of over $40 million which is more than solid.
boxoffice,3664ok,Dorkside,4,Sat May 16 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"A $150M budget, though..."
boxoffice,3664ok,JustAKidFromBrooklyn,3,Sat May 16 21:39:26 2015 UTC,That is higher than I would have predicted. It'll be interesting to see how the movie performs internationally.
boxoffice,3664ok,Dorkside,3,Sat May 16 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"Mad Max is going to have strong word of mouth which will help it have legs this summer. Also, it's set to kick ass internationally. I don't think they'll have any problems making a profit off of it."
boxoffice,3664ok,tcatron565,2,Sun May 17 00:16:00 2015 UTC,Blu-Ray sales though...  DVDs will make them all the money back and then some
boxoffice,3664ok,derpyco,2,Sun May 17 03:40:05 2015 UTC,Overseas is coming in huge.  $130m to date after this weekend.  Mad Max is gonna be just fine.
boxoffice,3664ok,Mysterian,2,Sun May 17 05:58:51 2015 UTC,$130m? Wow. I thought that its best case scenario was about $110 including US. That means it may make $170m worldwide between US and world... Nice!
boxoffice,3664ok,mrstickball,5,Sun May 17 13:08:45 2015 UTC,"Why? I loved it too, but it is totally a movie I wouldn't be upset with others not liking."
boxoffice,3664ok,Roller_ball,5,Sat May 16 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"Though I wouldn't rate it as highly as many others are rating it, Mad Max was really cool. It was different to see an action movie where there's so little exposition and have so much of the film rely on artful visual storytelling and be almost entirely action oriented at the same time. I'll be sad if it reaches bomb status."
boxoffice,3664ok,hebrewwarrior69,7,Sat May 16 16:51:42 2015 UTC,Opening at $41 million guarantees it won't bomb. It might have that Pacific Rim problem of not making enough. But Pacific Rim was PG-13 so having an opening about the same might be a stronger sign for MMFR. It probably will have better legs domestically than PR.
boxoffice,3664ok,GotMoFans,8,Sat May 16 17:27:17 2015 UTC,PR had legs though in China.  It made one hell of a recovery because of it.
boxoffice,3664ok,SpinkickFolly,7,Sat May 16 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"And because of that, and strong home video sales, we're getting a sequel!"
boxoffice,3664ok,Bugger217,0,Sat May 16 20:54:48 2015 UTC,I hated Mad Max. I don't understand all the great reviews. The movie was incredibly pointless with no plot and random things going on. 2/10 won't see again.
boxoffice,3679jr,Dorkside,7,Sat May 16 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"I've never been a huge popcorn fan. I used to get nachos (which were kinda gross, but better than popcorn) at my old go-to theater. Now that I exclusively go to the Alamo Drafthouse, I like having a real meal instead of just ""movie snacks"", even if the Alamo charges less for popcorn than other theaters, serve it in a HUGE bowl, and offers unlimited refills."

boxoffice,3679jr,Cynicbats,4,Sat May 16 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"I went to one of these.   Food wasn't bad and it wasn't too intrusive on the movie, if you accept that you will hear some background noise/you might see someone walking in front of the screen for a bit (the seating is arranged to minimize the disturbance).   All in all, I might even say I prefer it to a standard showing."
boxoffice,3679jr,mvs5191,6,Sun May 17 00:03:24 2015 UTC,"Great, more kinds of foul stink and disgusting eating noises. Can't people stop feeding their faces for 2 hours any more? And servers taking orders and going back and forth all the time? Just great."
boxoffice,3679jr,6510,1 point,Sun May 17 00:01:11 2015 UTC,Precisely why I gave up going to this one casual theater that was turned into one of these luxurious theaters a few months ago. It's absolutely needless.
boxoffice,3679jr,FrontRowSteve,1 point,Sun May 17 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in Australia they have this ""Gold class"" concept which costs more and you get food service etc and a smaller audience. So, basically this. It is by far the worst movie-watching experience I've had, both times. Beyond the smell and intrinsic annoyance people feel entitled to behave like they're at home because they paid a little extra. It mostly seems to appeal to what Australians call ""cashed up bogans"" (CUB - something to look up) and being stuck in a small room with that kind of obnoxiousness is my idea of hell. It's extremely telling to me that this concept has been tried everywhere but has only taken off as a mainstream thing in Australia. Because we're the only country with CUBs, essentially.  Also, very small screen, so it's utterly pointless considering my setup at home now."
boxoffice,3679jr,6510,1 point,Sun May 17 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"You just had bad servers, or the layout of the theater was not arranged properly to be a dine-in theater. The servers are supposed to duck below the tables so that they are barely visible going passed you.  As far as the disgusting eating noises, basic movie food is just as loud and these dine-in theaters don't serve fish, so the smells are minimal."
boxoffice,3679jr,JustAKidFromBrooklyn,1 point,Sun May 17 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"There's one near me that's called the ""Movie Tavern"" where they have the lights on with promo videos playing while you take and receive your orders, then the lights dim and while trailers play you eat your food. Usually by the time the movie starts people are pretty much done with their food and the theaters are so well laid out that you never even see the waiters or waitresses. I'm sure a bunch of regular theater chains will try to do this and mess it up haha."
boxoffice,3679jr,mardfet,3,Sat May 30 15:17:06 2015 UTC,Dinner and a movie took on a whole new meaning!
boxoffice,3679jr,tcatron565,3,Sun May 17 00:22:07 2015 UTC,I actually had some of those AMC Churros tonight. They were pretty good.
boxoffice,3679jr,HobbieK,2,Sun May 17 04:08:29 2015 UTC,"""Mike Truesdale can appreciate that. He left a recent Saturday afternoon screening of “Avengers: Age of Ultron” at an MGN Five Star Cinema in Glendale, Calif., with grease stains on his T-shirt from a Margherita pizza. “I get it on me. I can find it. I’ll eat it off my shirt,” he said.""  Wow."
boxoffice,363933,Dani_Californication,41,Fri May 15 18:58:53 2015 UTC,You know it's a strange time in history when several movies in one year hitting a billion dollars isn't even really surprising at all.
boxoffice,363933,mardfet,22,Fri May 15 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"It's just inflation.  In 20 years, it will be 2 billion."
boxoffice,363933,Number1AbeLincolnFan,42,Fri May 15 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"Not fully. Its more due to foreign markets getting larger (especially China, South Korea, Latin America, and the EMEA market), as well as the USD getting a little weaker.  The American box office is not much larger than it was 2-3 years ago."
boxoffice,363933,mrstickball,20,Fri May 15 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"Ticket prices (at least in the US) are actually flat over the last 3 years. In 2013, there were 2 movies to cross the $1 billion mark:  Frozen - $1.27B Iron Man 3 - $1.22B  This year Furious 7 will approach $1.5B as will Age of Ultron. There are also a multitude of other movies (Jurassic World, Minions, MI5, Hunger Games, and Star Wars) that have a legitimate shot of crossing the $1B barrier.   It has a lot less to do with inflation and a lot more to do with that the expanding foreign markets. That is why you see a much higher foreign percentage on the top movies than you did in previous years. If a movie hits $600M domestic like the first Avengers this year then it will most likely hit $2B international and would beat the first avengers by $500M worldwide. It could even surpass Titanic as #2 all time in that scenario."
boxoffice,363933,FockerFGAA,16,Fri May 15 22:11:20 2015 UTC,"Spectre will certainly have a shot at the billion dollar club, too!"
boxoffice,363933,DeeBased,8,Fri May 15 22:55:18 2015 UTC,And James Cameron films will be making 10 billion.
boxoffice,363933,BigEye4You,5,Fri May 15 20:50:05 2015 UTC,10 Marvel movies for $1billion each or 1 James Cameron movie for $10billion.
boxoffice,363933,angershark,7,Fri May 15 21:40:28 2015 UTC,10 Marvel movies would certainly come out quicker than 1 Cameron movie
boxoffice,363933,DodneyRangerfield,32,Sat May 16 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"Well-deserved, IMO - I know the film has been getting a lot of flack in some quarters, but I thought it was a blast."
boxoffice,363933,NeilPoonHandler,28,Fri May 15 19:08:52 2015 UTC,I thought it was a terrific sequel. All of the characters have been affected by their individual movies and it really shines through.
boxoffice,363933,dejerik,12,Fri May 15 23:12:32 2015 UTC,Anyone remember how fast Furious 7 got there for comparison?
boxoffice,363933,trapper2530,19,Fri May 15 19:23:10 2015 UTC,17 days.
boxoffice,363933,Bazooe,3,Fri May 15 20:04:29 2015 UTC,Wonder which one will have mode long term power.
boxoffice,363933,trapper2530,11,Fri May 15 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"Idk, Fast 7 is already scary close to surpassing Avengers 1 to take the place as the 3rd highest grossing film of all time. And I don't see Age of Ultron out grossing the first."
boxoffice,363933,Bazooe,3,Sat May 16 01:36:20 2015 UTC,"With only $50 million left and still some life in it i think F7 is a pretty good bet to unseat the first Avengers which is pretty... wow, if you would have asked a few months ago which movies had a shot at the top 3 worldwide in the next few years i don't know if anyone would have thought of F7"
boxoffice,363933,DodneyRangerfield,2,Sat May 16 13:18:31 2015 UTC,"Ultron, only in that it still has more markets like Japan to open in. F7 is pretty much spent at this point. But both are going to be really close to each other in terms of grosses, which is crazy given their hugely varying pedigrees on previous installments."
boxoffice,363933,mrstickball,24,Sat May 16 02:29:18 2015 UTC,"Unfair comparison since Furious opened the same week in most markets.  AoU had a more staggered release, including China last weekend."
boxoffice,363933,Fripples,3,Fri May 15 20:22:35 2015 UTC,Are staggered releases a good thing or bad thing for movies? Any advantageous either way?
boxoffice,363933,jomanlk,6,Sat May 16 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"I know that they would rather release it later in Asia, because of piracy issues."
boxoffice,363933,kplo,1 point,Sat May 16 01:35:12 2015 UTC,Piracy isn't as rampant as it was.. Look at the Chinese box office for proof. No need to steal the movie when theaters are now seen as a status/cultural symbol.
boxoffice,363933,mrstickball,7,Sat May 16 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"Do know that the chinese box office is deceiving as hell, studios are making 25% back from what they gross in China, which is very little."
boxoffice,363933,kplo,3,Sat May 16 02:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, its certainly lower than other markets, but I do believe most OS grosses are still pretty bad compared to domestic."
boxoffice,363933,mrstickball,3,Sat May 16 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"It depends. It sounds impressive to release globally worldwide, but in practice you run up against practical difficulties related to local customs in each territory. For instance while it may make sense to drop a big film on Thanksgiving weekend in the U.S., in some other countries it may just be a normal weekend and it would benefit the film more if they waited until a more opportunistic weekend to release. Not to mention all the manpower difficulties of getting it all done on a single day when otherwise you could break up that work over a longer period of time.  So I guess if you want to make a big splash then go ahead and release same day worldwide, but I think most studios prefer to space it out for a longer term benefit."
boxoffice,363933,hobojimmy,3,Sat May 16 04:45:46 2015 UTC,"There can also be local releases that complicate this. A particular weekend might have no competition in America, but in Japan there may be a major anime release (for example)."

I actually saw articles describing the film's performance as ""middling"".   Meanwhile, back in reality, the movie is probably going to finish in the top 5 worldwide all-time."
boxoffice,366u6r,dragonsky,2,Sat May 16 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Yep! The news was posted about it yesterday, although openings weren't huge, AoU will definitely have a great worldwide gross."

boxoffice,36376c,FrontRowSteve,14,Fri May 15 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"It's a shame. I think most long-term box office nerds would agree that Subers is the best BOM staffer the site's ever had. No reviews, no biases, just pure facts. I'm already not a fan of the new guy, his writing style is more flashy and less detail-oriented.  I wonder where Subers lands? He said he starts somewhere in a month, and someone replied something along the lines of ""their new offices are looking good."" Since he's a numbers guy, I'd assume something like FiveThirtyEight, but it could be anything from Buzzfeed to one of the lead industry dailies to a marketing firm. Wherever he goes, he'll do a great job."
boxoffice,36376c,pajamalamaobama,11,Sat May 16 03:50:40 2015 UTC,What I liked about his long-term forecasts is that he always analysed it afterwards. Comparing what he got wrong and what he got right.

boxoffice,36376c,JakkuScavenger,2,Sat May 16 12:52:41 2015 UTC,"BOM after the IMDB forum buyout (or whatever it was) sucked. Haven't bothered with them sense, other than looking at the numbers."

That makes it sort of an unfair comparison at the international scale at this point. I think because of that reason, Google Trends is much better suited for a country-by-country basis rather than an international basis."
boxoffice,3646rv,chrisychris-,1 point,Tue May 19 15:27:10 2015 UTC,That's because PP2 has a late release in most non English speaking countries where it won't perform well.
boxoffice,3646rv,ItsBobDoleYo,3,Tue May 19 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Sweet! You should post whenever we have head to head releases.   Word-of-mouth is definitely pushing Mad Max forward, more since Pitch Perfect is already well known."
boxoffice,363lpl,mrstickball,2,Fri May 15 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"AoU is tracking for an $80M weekend in China and should be at slightly under $160M through 7 days of release. For comparison, Furious 7 made $221M in it's first 7 days of release.  AoU will probably end up making somewhere between $250M and $300M in China."
boxoffice,363lpl,ItalianRicePie,3,Sat May 16 03:40:30 2015 UTC,"AoU will probably end up making somewhere between $250M and $300M in China.   Which is still pretty awesome, given Marvel's track record in the country."
boxoffice,363lpl,ItalianRicePie,2,Sat May 16 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"I think the amazing, and somewhat unexpected run that Furious 7 had in China has taken some of the gloss of Ultron's run, however it is still a fantastic result as most people were initially predicting no more than $200M for AoU from China."
boxoffice,363lpl,BigEye4You,1 point,Sat May 16 03:57:16 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I think Furious 7 shows how useful establishing a franchise is in China. To get near $400m in 30 days in any market is crazy. Only 4 movies in history did it in the US, and F7 could have done it in maybe 35 or 40."
boxoffice,363lpl,Bugger217,1 point,Sat May 16 04:49:49 2015 UTC,Does this account for inflation? Or has the Chinese box office just grown that much?

boxoffice,362x2y,trevdordurden,13,Fri May 15 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's opening weekend will be big, but it's going to have good worth of mouth that will help sales later on.  I think it'll open up number 2 at the box office, behind Pitch Perfect and pushing Avengers down to 3rd."
boxoffice,362x2y,NeighborStrategy,5,Fri May 15 19:56:26 2015 UTC,"This seems most accurate to me. I have a feeling Max will have a strong presence after this weekend, due to the reviews and word of mouth. PP2 has many devoted fans that will want to see it early, but probably won't entice that many people who didn't see the original."
boxoffice,362x2y,QuixoticMcGee,9,Fri May 15 21:23:06 2015 UTC,"Saw it, loved it. Hope it makes oodles of money but realistically I think we're going to be leaning on international pretty heavily for this. I don't see it getting to far above 100 million domestic so it probably needs around 300 mil international to be successful. Really hope it is so we can get some more R action films with big budgets coming our way (looking at you too Deadpool)."
boxoffice,362x2y,ianmcg77,3,Fri May 15 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"I feel that as long as it opens to larger than 30mil, a 100mil domestic total should be guaranteed. The word of mouth has been nothing but stellar."
boxoffice,362x2y,jburd22,3,Fri May 15 19:46:59 2015 UTC,I see it having a long tail like The Kingsmen.
boxoffice,362x2y,crazy-jew,7,Fri May 15 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"I think this movie is going to overperform as compared to under. The reviews have been stellar, and $4mil for a thursday is not bad at all. I think it'll benefit from a few weeks of rewatchability. Tomorrowland might come and dethrone it, but I wouldn't be surprised at a $60mil opening"
boxoffice,362x2y,derpyco,4,Fri May 15 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"I'll be really interested to see how it holds up in weekday numbers and especially its 2nd week with the rapturous reviews. Its obstacle would be Tomorrowland. Working against TL is the extreme secrecy surrounding its plot and being original content, in its favor is the Disney name, George Clooney, and the intrigue surrounding it because of the secrecy. 40-50M tracking sounds about right, strong reviews could kick it up a notch.  Don't know how much room they'll be for PP2, MM:FR, AoU, and TL (AND Poltergeist). Granted it'll be a long Memorial Day holiday so probably strong numbers all-around to accommodate several movies. If it's lucky MM'll barely slide and go around 30M for its 2nd weekend.  It'll be interesting to see what everyone picks for the box office estimates game"

I have heard almost nothing and i'm relatively interested in it.  I don't think it can hold off San Andreas but I do think it may be able to match or exceed Spy by a handful of millions.   It's all over when Jurassic World comes out, but I don't see it slipping from the top ten anytime soon."

boxoffice,35omnm,filmingej,7,Tue May 12 06:29:07 2015 UTC,"It got savaged in the Sony hacks, and even if your average Joe forgets about that, the reviews will probably be knives out. Cameron Crowe isn't a big name anymore, and the poster itself is touting movies he made 19 and 15 years ago. The cast is big but none of them are bulletproof (and Sniper was an anomaly for Cooper, not the norm).  It's not looking good. I think it'll counter-program to adults at least for a weekend or two, but I'd be stunned if it did more than a mid-teens opening weekend or more than $50m total."

Bradley Cooper is a box office draw, but that doesn't mean you can stick him in any formulaic rom-dram and expect it to kill.  Why did Sony move this to the summer anyway? They seem to not be putting any effort into advertising it. The awareness is deathly low. With the big push San Andreas is getting and the rave reviews of Spy, plus the backing of Disney for Tomorrowland - this will get steamrolled.

Of course that's just my personal gripe with the trailer and doesn't have so much to do with box office predictions.

It'll be 'Tomorrowland''s second week and it's opening up against 'San Andreas'. It'll be crushed by those for sure. The one thing it does have going for it, though, is that there aren't any other drama/comedy films opening up around it, and it does have a nice cast (Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Alec Baldwin, Rachel McAdams, and Bill Murray are all shown in the trailers a lot), so it should have an okay opening, but nothing spectacular. Probably weak legs as well."

boxoffice,35o4r2,mrstickball,2,Tue May 12 16:14:54 2015 UTC,Only for imported films usually. The government likes to protect the domestic film industry so they only give 30-day licenses to imported films. A weekday release means they only play for four weekends instead of five.
boxoffice,35nd8j,mrstickball,20,Mon May 11 22:38:52 2015 UTC,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
boxoffice,35nd8j,ItalianRicePie,12,Tue May 12 00:18:22 2015 UTC,"My logic for $1.5 billion being attainable is as follows:   Age of Ultron is tracking about 25% below The Avengers domestically, which should yield about $450-465m domestically. Worst case scenario is probably closer to $440 million USD. The movie is tracking about 20% ahead in foreign markets, prior to China and Japan's release. Assuming the 20% held, the movie would gross about $1,075 million USD. I believe that China's overall gross will be above 20%. Since it will be the largest box office territory, it will allow enough of a margin to allow it to surpass $1.5 billion by a comfortable margin (or at least outside of a margin of error).    $440 million domestic + $1,074 million foreign would yield about $1,514 million USD. However, I think China may gross more than $100 million USD, and could even hit $200m (reservations for AoU in China are twice that of F7, which would put its opening week in pretty rarified territory, as Furious 7 grossed $86m OD/$242m after 8 days)."
boxoffice,35nd8j,DaveFincher,3,Mon May 11 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"I think you are correct, and AoU will gross slightly more than $1.5 billion worldwide.   Cap 2 did $115M in China which was just under half of Cap 2's domestic tally. Given this, I would be very surprised if AoU didn't make more than $200M in China and I personally think it will do closer to $300M.   Given AoU is already at $875M worldwide, and will do at least $125M more domestically, it's almost impossible for the movie to gross less than $1.4B worldwide unless it makes virtually no more money in other foreign markets (hard to believe, especially when the film is yet to be released in Japan)."
boxoffice,35nd8j,jburd22,1 point,Tue May 12 04:33:14 2015 UTC,"FWIW, it made about $70m last weekend overseas (before China+Japan). Those markets alone are probably going to bring in $100 - $150m, bringing the total to about $1 billion + domestic + China/Japan. Easily enough to make the ban bet."
boxoffice,35nd8j,jburd22,1 point,Tue May 12 15:11:20 2015 UTC,The reality is you're both basically gambling on how well it does in China. Good luck to you both.
boxoffice,35nd8j,mythmaster,2,Tue May 12 09:44:59 2015 UTC,Pretty much. I think it can hit about $1.4 billion without China (although it'd be EXTREMELY close). He believes the movie is pretty much DOA everywhere but China.
boxoffice,35nd8j,avickthur,1 point,Tue May 12 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"it still has to hit in some smaller countries, and even in the markets it is in, it still has a good 100-150 mil that it will make."
boxoffice,35nd8j,avickthur,2,Tue May 12 16:24:19 2015 UTC,"Right. As of last weekend (when it hit $875m WW), it had only released in 72% of total territories. So there's still quite a bit left to go."
boxoffice,35nd8j,bluecamel2015,3,Tue May 12 17:09:53 2015 UTC,and it just scored the second highest opening day in china with 33 mil. I think Avengers 2 is in the clear.

boxoffice,35nd8j,DaveFincher,2,Tue May 12 14:42:02 2015 UTC,I keep forgetting about the impact of the Chinese market. China alone will probably get it to $1.2B.

I might wait for Blu-ray since an extended cut is being released.

It  has yet (Well today) to open in Chin and Japan and the US it is entering 3rd week.  The 'rest' of the world is everything outside the Big 3 (US, China, Japan). People on here are saying that 'rest' is going to bring in $100-$150 million from here on out. That is insane and will not even come close to that. It has been open in the other major markets Uk, France, Germany, India, Russia, Australia, SK, etc for 3 or more weeks. AuO will not come close to making even 100 million in the 'other' box offices outside the big 3. Not even half that much."

I think the second Avengers will top both of them but not by much, the growth in international market even in 3 years since the first has been stunning.  I think it'll be 500M US and 1.55 Billion world wide being the 4th movie to generate 1 billion just from the rest of the world. It's made 560 million worldwide before opening in China where It will make at least 250 million if not 300 million."

boxoffice,35ng8q,ZestyDragon,1 point,Wed May 13 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that Avengers 2 will top either of them. At this point Avengers has made almost as much as it can around the world, all it really has left is 100-150 mil domestic plus maybe another 100-150 mil from China, and at MAX 100 mil from Japan. From my POV the max Avengers 2 can reach is 1.4 B worldwide which does not put it in the furious 7/Avengers territory."
boxoffice,35ng8q,jburd22,1 point,Fri May 15 19:53:06 2015 UTC,"so you're saying that 1.4 is so far off from 1.5? seems arbitrary, if it can hit 1.4 it can hit 1.5 while it has got the majority of its run it can still edge up higher, not alot of family stuff coming out in the next two weeks and i think you're underestimating the global boxoffice."
boxoffice,35ng8q,jacquesaustin,2,Fri May 15 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it will hit 1.4, I think it's lucky if it hits 1.4. At this point, each 100 mil becomes infinitely harder to achieve than the last. I do think a 1.3 mil total is guaranteed at this point however."
boxoffice,35ng8q,jburd22,6,Fri May 15 21:12:03 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say Furious beats both.
boxoffice,35ng8q,Coast_Dragon,0,Tue May 12 14:15:43 2015 UTC,Furious 7 will get that last 52 million to pass the original Avengers by hook or by crook. Age of Ultron will pass both of them once they debut in China and settle around 1.6 - 1.8 billion worldwide.
boxoffice,35ng8q,mythmaster,2,Mon May 11 23:39:36 2015 UTC,There is no way Avengers 2 reaches the 1.6-1.8 bil WW. That would take like a 450 M haul from China.

boxoffice,35ng8q,mythmaster,1 point,Sat May 16 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"AuO will make a lot in China compared to A1 but it is not going to make over $250 in China. It is far behind what F7 did in China.  Do not be surprised if AuO makes less than A1 in Japan.  AuO is going to end up $150 below A1 in the US and probably closer to $190-$210 below. AuO is going to beat A1 in South Korea but AuO is going to make substantially less than A1 in pretty much every other market.  UK, France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, India, Spain, Thailand, etc. AuO is just way too behind. AuO will make maybe another $60 million US (That is probably being nice as AuO is falling way faster than A1 did) and it is has been out for 5 days in China already. AuO has yet to open in Japan but has opened EVERYWHERE else for at least 3 weeks. It is tapped out worldwide besides China and Japan.  It can't make another $500 million here on out. Just can't. It would require it to have INSANE legs in China to even cross $1.4 billion world wide.  AuO was at $990 total Thursday. That includes the first 5 days in China (Which is when a film makes a large % of it's box office total in a market).  Let us say AuO makes $80 million this weekend in China and I'll throw in another $50 million from US and rest of the world. That means AuO would have to still make another HALF A BILLION DOLLARS after this weekend JUST to get to $1.6 billion. There is simply 0% chance that happens. $1.8 billion is even more absurd.   Let us just stick to your low estimate--how in the world can AuO get an ADDITIONAL $550 billion? It has Japan to open in but it has been in the US for over 3 weeks, China for a week, and is tapped out EVERYWHERE else.   Not going to happen. Not even close."
boxoffice,35ng8q,bluecamel2015,1 point,Sat May 16 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"It doesn't need 450 million in China. It only needs 300 mil (the first Avengers only made 86 million in China) to offset the 220 it will lose domestically assuming it runs out of steam around 400 million. It's behind Furious 7 in China because it hasn't had a full weekend yet. It opened on a Tuesday at midnight vs Furious 7.  I've heard it's tracking 20% higher internationally, but  I can't find any reliable numbers at Boxofficemojo. If China offsets the weak domestic numbers, the international box office picks up the slack and Japan gets at least 50 million, that's 1.6 billion."

It will make maybe $200 more than A1 did which only offset the US deficit.  In South Korea AuO will end up making maybe $20-30 more than A1 but in pretty much EVERY other market AuO is millions behind. Even in the smaller markets (Denmark, Norway, etc) AuO is going to end up 5% to as much as 50% behind.  Sorry but not up for debate. AuO has ZERO chance of hitting $1.6 billion. ZERO.   Fast and Furious opened on a Sunday in China and made much more than AuO did.   Sorry but it is just not going to happen. $1.4 billion is the limit when it is all clear.

Just because a franchise is old doesn't mean it doesn't court the same audience. Look at GotG which most people were not even aware of or at least far fewer than who are aware of the Mad Max character. That didn't stop people from going to go see it. I'm not saying that the audience is expecting to see the exact same characters. I'm saying that the people who go to see Mad Max would also in general watch AoU.

They could make just 70% of what the original did and it's still a massive financial win for the studio.    Disney and Marvel will still own all those records through the first one, and they're going to make buckets of money to pile on top of this with two Pixar releases, another Marvel movie, and friggin Star Wars this Christmas.

It actually looks like shit, so bringing up how older concepts sounded like shit isn't even the same ballpark. All of the films you mentioned had far better trailers."
boxoffice,35ksfq,Republican_Atheist,4,Mon May 11 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"If you think Inside Out looks shit based on trailers then we're watching different trailers.  It looks ace!  Also, I didn't downvote you so chill a lil'."

boxoffice,35mabj,taylorswiftfan123,1 point,Mon May 11 21:13:15 2015 UTC,600 theaters is the minimum to be considered wide.  And to answer OP: it won't. It's done.
boxoffice,35mabj,GoddammitCricket,2,Tue May 12 02:34:16 2015 UTC,If it performed poorly in limited release it might not go national.
boxoffice,35mabj,GoldandBlue,1 point,Mon May 11 18:09:51 2015 UTC,"Came out April 17th this year in 510 theatres. Pretty much bombed out with US $621,812 with a shocker $1,219 average and opened at no.17. Plus an abysmal 23% on RT put the nail in the coffin. It probably won't open in any other country now after US release so if you want to see it it's a VOD for sure now in a few months time maybe even less depending on the studio."
boxoffice,35k6pr,SethR0gen,5,Mon May 11 03:47:04 2015 UTC,I really hope Mad Max does well. I'm scared it won't though.
boxoffice,35k6pr,Republican_Atheist,2,Mon May 11 11:43:57 2015 UTC,R movies have done really well this year so far and almost every critic I have read so far is literally gushing over it. I think Mad Max is more likely to surprise than disappoint. But that is just a gut feeling. I think word of mouth will help it long run too.
boxoffice,35k6pr,GoldandBlue,1 point,Mon May 11 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"If we are to trust this tracking then it should end around 120m domestically, and if it holds very well then maybe as high as 150."

boxoffice,35ie5k,Bugger217,7,Sun May 10 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a good list!! I was to lazy to check all the others.  Anyway, how many of these can really overachieve? At least surpass 200 million world wide?  Surely Mad Max, Magic Mike... and the others I admitt my ognorance.  Your suggestion?"
boxoffice,35ie5k,Bugger217,5,Sun May 10 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"San Andreas and Pan certainly both have very solid shots at well surpassing that mark. Other wild cards would be In the Heart of the Sea, Vacation, and then maybe Point Break.  Edit: Spelling."
boxoffice,35ie5k,MisterWonka,4,Sun May 10 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"I think Vacation has a really good shot. We are the Millers is a good comparison and that made like $250m worldwide. If the advance reviews are good, I think it'll make it."
boxoffice,35ie5k,mardfet,1 point,Sun May 10 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"San Andreas will probably do close to Hercules, maybe a tad better without the competition from Lucy but nowhere near $200M. $95M max.

boxoffice,35ie5k,Bugger217,4,Mon May 11 01:01:48 2015 UTC,We're talking worldwide here. San Andreas could definitely reach that mark worldwide.
boxoffice,35ie5k,GoldandBlue,2,Mon May 11 04:13:58 2015 UTC,"The problem with WB as far as huge numbers go is that they do not have a big tentpole franchise right now. They are waiting on DC, but they will still have a good year. I think Max will do good numbers, not spectacular but good. Entourage, Magic Mike, will do well. They even have potential sleeper hits with UNCLE, Vacation, and Black Mass. They just wont do Disney or Universal numbers but they will have another solid year."
boxoffice,35ie5k,GoldandBlue,3,Sun May 10 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"But you have to consider the ""nature"" of the three big company you mention (we have to add Fox).  Buena Vista to me it's a story of its own kind: they can't fail (economically). Disney has its particular way to handle merchandising and in general to make profit outside the ""cinema experience"" that make them in a strange position for a film distributor.  They can make a lot less movies, paying a lot less human resources and taking few to none risk, and anyway make a ton of money.  So the real comparison to me it's between the other three, and this and the last year were not so kind to WB cinema division economically.  EDIT: this is only for USA, but look at the number of films and total earnings, and it's pretty obvious the average for WB films ot's not that high  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/studio/?view=company&view2=yearly&yr=2014&p=.htm"
boxoffice,35ie5k,gcm6664,2,Sun May 10 20:48:17 2015 UTC,True but as a movie lover i appreciate that WB is the only major studio that seems genuinly interested in making original movies. And that has been fairly profitable for them.
boxoffice,35ie5k,mythmaster,2,Sun May 10 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"Yes I am with you in this.  The topic started from me seeing how in the last two years a lot of original WB films didn't really find their public, and that's from a ""film lover"" point of view can become a problem because, as you said, there is not a really big drive today to risk with new IP or ""solo"" film."
boxoffice,35ie5k,GotMoFans,2,Mon May 11 07:32:07 2015 UTC,That is not a very great list for what used to be the biggest studio. Sad actually.
boxoffice,35ie5k,autowikibot,15,Mon May 11 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"With the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit franchise officially over (unless they somehow get the rights to the Silmarillion), WB is putting all their eggs in the DC cinematic universe/Fantastic Beasts/Lego movie franchises to battle Disney's Marvel/Star Wars/Pixar behemoth.  That doesn't start until 2016."
boxoffice,35ie5k,GotMoFans,3,Sun May 10 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"Silmarillion seem to be out of reach for WB if Tolkien heirs are to be believed ( is it written in this way in english?)  Anyway to me it's clear that WB need to keep investing in new IP. Look at American Sniper and Godzilla: they single handedly save WB from a disappointing year, with Hobbit inability to reach 1 billion in a worlwide market every year more profitable and the Lego Movie that didn't really catch up in the rest of the world but can at least be the premise of a new incedibly powerfull universe( http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2014&p=.htm )"

boxoffice,35inlv,Bugger217,11,Sun May 10 19:19:14 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it will look like this:   Pitch Perfect 2 - $43 million Mad Max: Fury Road - $38 million Avengers: Age or Ultron - $34 million
boxoffice,35inlv,dragonsky,-2,Sun May 10 19:21:21 2015 UTC,..ok you are seriously overrating PP2..I expect PP2 to bomb
boxoffice,35inlv,Mybrainmelts,3,Mon May 11 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"The movie is tracking above $40 million, and most analysts a predicting at least that. I've seen a couple of predictions at $50 million. You're underestimating the popularity of the first movie."

boxoffice,35inlv,LAXtremest,3,Tue May 12 00:56:33 2015 UTC,"This is gonna be really tough to figure out, I agree with you that PP2 will probably come out on top, and as much as MM:FR is my most or 2nd-most anticipated movie of the year, I don't know if it's a slam dunk when it comes to the US box office. It'll come out right around $40M, maybe just shy, but it'll duke it out with AoN for 2nd and may end up 3rd. I'm intrigued by its longevity and how it'll play out overseas (it'll probably play stronger int'l but how much stronger?)"
boxoffice,35inlv,Peterfug,3,Sun May 10 21:37:31 2015 UTC,Mad Max is the wild card in this. It could end up killing of being a total bomb.
boxoffice,35inlv,pajamalamaobama,2,Mon May 11 00:09:11 2015 UTC,"I believe it will be Avengers, Mad Max, then Pitch 2....Avengers dropped 60% so lets say it drops 67......IDK lol. Its so hard....Mad Max really fucks up the whole thing (though im dying to see it)....Avengers is being totally unpredictable...and Pitch didnt open to big numbers the first time but sequels do better about 90% of the time"
boxoffice,35inlv,dragonsky,2,Mon May 11 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"Pitch Perfect is an easy #1. The first one has an enormous reputation, it doubled its worldwide grosses on DVD (which means even more people have seen it through torrents, streams, etc.) and the advertising groundswell has hit hard. Add in that there have been only a few studio comedies this year - and most either flopped or are Get Hard and Paul Blart 2 - and it's going to do really well. Predictions are in the $40s but I'm gonna say $55m.  Avengers 2 will fall at least 50 percent this weekend. 50 percent would mean $38.6m, 55 percent would mean $35m or so, 60 percent $32m, etc. So I think Max can take second place. Reviews are stellar but it'll need to connect outside of the Redditor fanboy audience, but I can also see it holding next weekend pretty well.  So...  PP2 $55m Mad Max $41m Avengers $36.5m"
boxoffice,35inlv,RichHomieCK,1 point,Mon May 11 19:51:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly expect PP2 to bomb..this movie does not have huge marketing, and not many people asked for a sequel..it will make decent business first week but afterwards it will fall.  I expect Mad Max to take #1. Avengers is still doing well so it will likely do 35+ mil. and I doubt PP2 will be able to make that much so I think Mad Max is 1st followed by AoU and PP2"

boxoffice,35hxpg,kayjay734,1 point,Sun May 10 16:04:52 2015 UTC,How much do people think it's going to make in China? I mean I can see it making 150m but not much more.
boxoffice,35hxpg,DaveFincher,11,Sun May 10 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"Furious 7 made well over $300 million there, I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say Avengers 2 will approach that number. That country is adding a dozen movie theaters per day -- it's growing at a ridiculous rate, and blockbusters' box office takes in the country will grow accordingly."
boxoffice,35hxpg,kayjay734,0,Sun May 10 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"I don't deny that. However, to approach that number it will have to make more than 3x the amount the first film did only 3 years ago. Iron Man 3 made $121m in China. I'm just looking at the numbers."
boxoffice,35hxpg,DaveFincher,5,Sun May 10 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"Furious 6 made $66m in China 2 years ago. Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon made $163m 4 years ago (while AoE made over $300m).  I don't think there's rhyme or reason to the Chinese market. Sequel entrenchment seems to be a huge benefit to them, so Avengers could do very well, given that Iron Man did $121m. I doubt it'll hit $300m, certainly. But I think $200m may be in play."
boxoffice,35hxpg,mrstickball,1 point,Sun May 10 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"Well, there wasn't a 300 million dollar movie until last year. And Furious 7 is probably going to be the first 400 million dollar one."

boxoffice,35hxpg,JakkuScavenger,1 point,Sun May 10 16:41:54 2015 UTC,Why? I'm honestly curious why you think it won't make half as much as Transformers or the last Too fast too furious movie.
boxoffice,35hxpg,ennnuix,2,Sun May 10 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"The first film made $86,300,000 in China. They're not absolutely mad about Marvel films like the US is. I would prefer people give evidence to support their claims that AoU is going to make $200-300m+ in China."
boxoffice,35hxpg,DaveFincher,2,Sun May 10 16:49:10 2015 UTC,Fast & Furious 6 only made a little over 66 million there. I think it's not unreasonable to believe that AoU will experience a similar growth.
boxoffice,35hxpg,Rhetorical_Answers,1 point,Sun May 10 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Well, Iron Man 3 already made 121M one year later, which was twice as much as Furious 6 made (66M) in the same period."
boxoffice,35hxpg,ennnuix,1 point,Sun May 10 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"I think that it, along with every other major American IP is still growing/expanding in China. Its not like the Furious or Transformers movies had much higher grosses prior to AoE or #7, yet both magically hit $300m+.   I am not saying Avengers will hit $300m, but given that IM3 hit $120m 2 years ago, and Marvel does try to promote the franchise in China, I think it can hit $200-220m easily.  The other side-note would be that the movie is doing unfathomably well in South Korea, and that market does perform somewhat similarly to China."
boxoffice,35hxpg,mrstickball,2,Sun May 10 18:24:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Age of Ultron has a large action scene in Seoul, Korea including a new Korean character with a teensy bit of Korean dialogue."

boxoffice,35hxpg,Bugger217,8,Sun May 10 16:20:17 2015 UTC,"Star Wars maybe. It has the 3D markup for some theaters (though not native 3D like Avatar) and is in that December sweet spot that gave us the unpredicatable successes of Avatar, Titanic, and American Sniper. It'll be a long slow burn but it's the only film that will even come close.  Honestly though I wonder if any film will be the next Avatar, even Avatar 2-5."
boxoffice,35hxpg,mi-16evil,6,Sun May 10 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"Avatar was the movie that brought 3D into existence until there is another movie that  really makes it the event to go see in theaters, it will be a while."

boxoffice,35hxpg,TrueMarvelFan,14,Sun May 10 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"No fucking chance. It'll be lucky to even break $2b. You're underestimating BO capabilities by a huge amount.   Despite all their hype and possible increase of fans in the past 3 years, it seems like AoU will finish below Avengers 1. That alone should show you how extremely hard it is to break $1.5b"
boxoffice,35hxpg,Dani_Californication,2,Sun May 10 17:12:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly to me it's more than that. The first film was a big event, we never saw anything like it before. Everyone knows now what to expect from a Marvel film and the mediocre reviews meant that it didn't really seem likely to beat the first film."
boxoffice,35hxpg,TheJoshider10,11,Sun May 10 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"Crazy talk. There's no doubt that the movie, of course, has a shot at beating Avatar, but the whole ""It's going to do it just because it's Star Wars"" sort of claim holds zero water. The movie has to be more than just ""Star Wars"" to do that. It has to be good, and it has to be something that everyone loves and wants to see over and over and over and over again."
boxoffice,35hxpg,Bugger217,2,Sun May 10 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"I think that Star Wars VII can hit probably $1.1 - 1.2 billion on name alone.. Much like how TPM somehow did $450m on its name alone.

boxoffice,35hxpg,mi-16evil,15,Sun May 10 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"No. This is just how a sequel to a movie that had unexpectedly high numbers is supposed to do. Even if its $450-500m domestic, its still gonna be the 2nd highest-grossing Marvel movie ever."
boxoffice,35hxpg,ManateeofSteel,3,Sun May 10 18:30:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We can't start talking about decline till I'd say all the way to Infinity War Part II, as Part I will likely have that lower stake that every other first parter has had.   Captain America: Civil War will be an interesting test though and may dilute future installments. I worry that after one standalone film has an Avengers style roster then people will become disinterested in future single hero films that aren't Iron Man.   Also there's the possibility of RDJ leaving after CA:CW, but the dude is making $50 million every time he grows the goatee and Marvel will still pay him because he is still the biggest star by a mile in those films.

They know they can pocket a cool 1-2B on these big superhero group movies. They'll look at how much it underperforms in the U.S. to determine how worried they should be. If it drops a lot, well that's not just 'cause of its opening weekend being impacted by sports, it means there's a lack of repeat business which says something about the quality. Based on the 2nd weekend drop with essentially no competition, the situation certainly seems it may be that way. They'll see how things go with Ant-Man as they move onto phase 3 and launch even more obscure comic book character movies (Doctor Strange, Black Panther).  As someone who's only seen maybe 3-4 Marvel movies, I'm way more intrigued by Captain America 3 & Avengers Infinity War."
boxoffice,35iy9b,ItsBobDoleYo,14,Sun May 10 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"I think it was just over estimated. For a sequel, it's doing good. I think the problem is that this film is just a bridge to the better films like Civil War and Infinity War."
boxoffice,35iy9b,chrisychris-,5,Sun May 10 23:23:45 2015 UTC,"It's definitely under-performing. Here's an article I quoted in another thread where even Bloomberg Business was predicting an opening weekend of $217 million. Other predictions were even higher. I think predictions were inflated, but the larger than expected drop this weekend is evidence that Marvel isn't bulletproof. I'm a big fan of Ant-Man from way back, but I'm only expecting it to do Thor: Dark World numbers of around $450 million. That's mostly just a gut-based guess, I hope it does better. If it comes in around that range, I'll bet Disney's going to fall far short of internal projections for the two films."

My reasons were:   All sequels to mega hits perform less than the first. (Dark Knight Rises, Spider man 2, Empire) The reviews weren't as strong and it was opening in less theatres. the anticipation wasn't as high, it didn't feel as big of as an event. The novelty of the Avengers being the first team up film has worn off. There really was no main hook to the marketing   But really it was more just the fact that the Avengers was a perfect storm of success and I knew Marvel recreating that would be extremely difficult. I mean it didn't just top the records it decimated them. I just knew that unless the second was really fucking great it wouldn't be as big of a phenomenon."

The first avengers is such an outlier to open over 200m and still have a 3.0 multiplier that you can't even count that as part of the equation.  I think it makes more sense to look at ultron as a step up from Iron Man 3 than it does as a step down from Avengers.  And going forward just use that to predict future avengers grosses.

I looked at the 1st Avengers, and it had a $29m Friday, followed by a $42m/Sat, $30m/Sun. Would seem that it should track closer to $75-77m.   Its tracking about 15% below the original movie, which will put it north of $500 (if it held to 15% - its probably going to be closer to 20% lower by the end, IMO). Of course, it doesn't matter if the Avengers awaken the Chinese behemoth.   As bad as Hot Pursuit has done, few people care. Should hit about $13-14m on a $35m budget. Won't make its budget back at the box office, but will probably end up being a movie that gets its money back via Netflix or giving distro rights to Oxygen/OWN/Lifetime."

It is going to make over a billion but it is going to be a 'disappointment' in terms of its box office numbers. It way under performed its opening weekend."
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,7,Sun May 10 00:44:11 2015 UTC,"191 is no disappointment. This low drop for second fridays is common, which will likely lead to a 75-85 mil weekend which is AMAZING for a second weekend."
boxoffice,35egz7,jburd22,4,Sun May 10 02:54:02 2015 UTC,"It is a disappointment.  A 75% drop for movie that has NO competition is very, very poor showing.   It made 15 million less in its opening weekend that Avengers 1. It sounds silly to say a movie that is going to make over a billion a 'disappointment' but it is way under performing. Just a fact based on numbers."
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,4,Sun May 10 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"75% drop is bad. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think an average drop from 1st weekend to 2nd weekend is more like 55%. Would have expected an Avengers movie to hold up much better than that."
boxoffice,35egz7,DeeBased,2,Sun May 10 04:05:37 2015 UTC,"FYI, the weekend drop is estimated at 59%. Bad, but not earth-shatteringly bad."
boxoffice,35egz7,mrstickball,2,Sun May 10 17:12:45 2015 UTC,55-65% is more the target. AuO has not played nearly as well in US audiences. The first Avengers had a great word of mouth but AuO has not been nearly as well received.
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,8,Sun May 10 07:31:24 2015 UTC,"75% percent is bad, but it's not really 75%. Avengers 2 Thursday was 24ish mil so its actual friday was somewhere close to  60 mil, making the drop 66%. This may also be bad, but for movies with gigantic openings, it is very rare for them to have a 50% next weekend. The only 2 films that opened over 150 mil that dropped 50% are Dark Knight (75 mil) and Avengers (100 mil).  Now lets play a game of numbers. While some people will be comparing this to avengers, the best comparison box office wise is Iron Man 3 (which really was the first Avengers sequel) and was released in the same time frame. That film had a second friday of 19 mil, which led to a 72 mil second weekend. That movie made most of its weekend money on Sat and Sunday, which makes sense cause you don't get the fanboy crowd rushing to it on opening day. Also May films don't do as well during the week compared to later summer releases so there is always a jump during the weekend for May releases. The other important fact is that Iron Man 3 and Avengers 2's openings were very similar, but during Friday and Sunday, Avengers 2 destroyed Iron Man 3. It was on Saturday where Iron Man 3 got the edge and levelled the playing field. Basically this indicates that the Boxing match had an impact on Avengers 2 box office and the people that didn't see it last weekend may see it this weekend.   Basically at MINIMUM the film makes 72 mil this weekend, and it is way more likely to be in the 75-85 mil range, which, by the way is HUGE and easily puts it as the second best second weekend. It's 9 day toll will be over 300 mil and it will be the second fastest boxoffice sprint for a movie domestically, EVER. nothing about these numbers is dissapointing  Last note, Avengers 2 is NOT disappointing from a box office standard. Everyone new this would preform less than the first (Spiderman 2, Dark Knight Rises, even Empire Strikes Back) and I honestly believe those who where predicting the massive 230 plus debut were doing so for clickbate reasons. I new going into that weekend that this would make less than the first, both overall and on opening weekend. Avengers 2 is easily on track to become one of the highest grossing films domestically (we're talking top 5) and that is no small feat. If anything it is a testament to the strength of the Marvell brand. Rant over."
boxoffice,35egz7,jburd22,-4,Sun May 10 05:25:13 2015 UTC,"Ok some valid points but some misses:  1) I am going to be nice but you are either really uninformed but it honestly seems like you are just out right lying and hoping nobody calls you out which is really sad.. The Friday-to-Friday drop for AuO is NOT 66%. Why did you say that? That is just a totally false statement:  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&id=avengers2.htm  Sorry but it is clear. The drop Friday-to-Friday 74.7%.  IT IS NOT UP FOR DEBATE. It is a fact.  You are trying to say that that is false because it made 24 million Thursday . You are aware that Thursday evening/midnight box office numbers are INCLUDED in Friday box office totals right?  So you are trying to state AuO made 84.4 million Friday PLUS 24 million Thursday---that is FALSE. The 84.4 million INCLUDES Thursday's 24 million. That is how it always is. You seem to be trying to be knowledgeable about how box offices work but that something I should not have to explain that to you.  So sorry  but your 'rant' falls flat on its face because as you said (I am QUOTING your comment above in case you try and change it ""75% percent is bad, but it's not really 75%.""  So thanks for proving my point because it IS REALLY 75%.  2) ""The only 2 films that opened over 150 mil that dropped 50% are Dark Knight (75 mil) and Avengers (100 mil).""  This is TRUE but only 9 films have ever made 150 million opening weekend. Of those 9 do you know which were the ONLY TWO that ended up making over 500 million total US?? Dark Knight and Avengers. If Avengers 2 can't get much over 500 million US that is a massive disappointment. Avengers 1 made over 623 million US. AuO was expected to beat that. It now is bordering on not even making 500 million. That is bad.  3) Comparing AuO to Iron Man 3 is not really valid. A sequel is compared to it's predecessor. In that respect AuO is failing by a fairly substantial margin.  AuO openend 15 million BELOW Avengers 1---that is a disappointment.    It also important to remember that films do not just play Friday-Sunday. Movies make a large portion of their money Monday-Thursday (Yes a lot of people see films during the weekday)  So lets compare.  AuO has already failed to beat A1 by a decent margin in their opening weekends. Now lets compare the ""Week after"". Following its opening weekend A1 made 62.08 million Monday-Thursday. AuO made only 44.43 million this last Monday-Thursday.  So AuO is substantially behind A1 during the week after each one's opening weekend by a big margin. That is not good for AuO.  Nobody is saying AuO is not going to make a TON of money but in deciding if a film is a box office disappointment is based on EXPECTATIONS. In that regard it is really not up for debate--AuO is way behind even conservative expectations. Is it a 'bomb'? Of course not but that was not the question.   PS--It is also important to remember 2 things 1) Movie theaters get a cut of a film's ticket sales and the theater's percentage increases with time which is why studios want their movies to make as much money as possible EARLY 2) AuO is playing well overseas but what people seem to not understand is that studios make WAY less money off foreign box office for a ton of reasons. If you gave a studio the change to have a film make 1 billion TOTAL box office with 400 million US and then other movie makes only 750 million TOTAL box office with 600 million US they will take the latter EASILY.   In China for example studio's only get 25% of ticket sales. That is awful. So when people say 'Oh  but movie X did $150 million in China--yet and the Studio got 25% that PLUS the studio has to pay a TON to market in China's cities so it is making little to nothing off those China sales. Let alone studios have to pay censors, translators, staff, etc for other countries. It also has to dump huge amounts to promote those films in China, Russia, Germany, Belarus, etc., etc. Foreign countries also can be total dicks and try squeeze the studios out of much money as possible (See China as stated above)."
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,2,Sun May 10 07:21:45 2015 UTC,"OK, some more points. I know how box office works really well. My point about the 24 ml was valid. I was NOT saying the 24 mil wasn't included in the friday haul, I know it is. I guess I didn't clarify that the first Avengers had a way smaller Thursday midnight ( I believe in the 15-18 mil range). but had about the same friday, so just on Friday by itself Avengers 1 made more than Age of Ultron. This means the drop that Avengers 2 had friday to friday was less than it seems and the drop wasn't fair to judge on its own since marvel films usually aren't as front loaded on thursday night.   Next point: If Avengers 2 doesn't break 500 mil, it is NOT a disappointment. Age of Ultron was NEVER expected to beat Avengers 1. Avengers 1 is one of the biggest juggernauts in box office history, being a perfect storm of a release. It is the reason why every studio is creating a shared universe and is jumping the gun. Usually it's safe to compare a movie to it's sequel boxoffice wise but that is not the case for Avengers. Avengers wasn't a hit it was a game changer, a boxoffice Behemoth. For the Big franchises it is among the likes of The Dark Knight, Spiderman, and Star Wars: a New Hope. I mean look at the Empire strikes back, that made HALF of its predecessor and it is one of the highest grossing films (top 10) adjusting for inflation. the films that shatter the big records are never surpassed by their sequels, they are on a tier of their own. So Avengers 2 not breaking 500 (which it honestly has a good shot of doing) is no disappointment since only 4 movies have done so. Each of those 4 (avatar, Titanic, Avengers, Dark knight) completely changed the film industry.    I also think the Iron Man 3 comparison is very fair since it's about Iron Man (who is the biggest box office draw of the avengers) and preformed way better than the first 2 and seemed to ignore the boxoffice rule for third installments. It's clear that avengers had a super positive impact on its box office. Iron Man 3 was also a HUGE success, and is one of the biggest hits of this Decade. Also if AOU makes 85 mil this weekend, Disney will be nothing but ecstatic.   So can we finally say this film is not a dissapointment. It won't make as much as the first, of course, but the first had the Fastest sprint for a movie. EVER. we're talking about a movie that defied every expectation and broke the opening weekend by 40 million. You simply cannot recreate that. My problem with people calling this a disappointment is that they are just looking at the numbers but they aren't looking at the bigger picture. We are talking about a film that is Guaranteed 400 mil, and will end in the 440-525 range. It will WITHOUT A FUCKING DOUBT win the summer boxoffice. This will be the fourth time IN A ROW that marvel studios will have achieved this. No franchise has ever came close to doing this. Marvel is now synonymous with summer films. the only time anything resembling this has happened is when Lucas and Speilberg ruled the box office world from 77-83.   The key to this is that this film is not Avengers 2, it is Marvel 11. This is a franchise that off of Avengers success has thrived and only gotten stronger in the following years. Avengers 2 isn't the Avengers sequel, it is another Avengers sequel, and as far as 4th sequels go, this is going pretty well. The Marvel train is not stopping anytime soon."
boxoffice,35egz7,jburd22,2,Sun May 10 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"Oh and btw---AGAIN AuO failed to meet its expectations and did NOT make 85 million but instead made 77 million.  AuO has failed to meet tracking and expectations for its opening weekend, the following week, and its 2nd weekend.  It will without doubt make AT LEAST 125 million less than A1 did 3 years ago. That is disappointing."

boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,1 point,Sun May 10 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"""Age of Ultron was NEVER expected to beat Avengers 1.""    I have to disagree with this point. Just from opening weekend standpoint, EVERYBODY was watching to see if Ultron could outdo A1's opening weekend numbers. There were tons of predictions that Ultron might hit the $210m to $225m range. There were tons of articles speculating this. Online ticket sales were outpacing the Avengers by (cant remember exact number) at least 37%. Overseas sales were up 44% over the Avengers before it was released in the USA. Saying no one expected this to make more than the first Avengers is simply not true.  Also, this should have Marvel VERY worried. The BIGGEST dip in entertainment media sales is NOT the disappointing release itself, but the sequel that follows. Everyone goes to the sequel of a blockbuster movie because the last one was so good. If the sequel isn't so good, they skip the NEXT (third) sequel. I believe this is what happened with Expendables 3, and it used to happen with breakout record albums as well. Frampton's follow up to Frampton Comes Alive sold great, but it wasn't so good, and AFTER that not so great album his career tanked.   TL;DR - Marvel will do okay on this sequel, but since people aren't liking it as much, the NEXT Avengers sequel is vulnerable."
boxoffice,35egz7,DeeBased,3,Sun May 10 19:23:56 2015 UTC,"Now this is just my opinion, but I think most of the big predictors knew this wouldn't match the first one on opening weekend. I mean the ticket sales were through the roof, but that makes sense as the marvel brand is a lot stronger than it was in 2012. I just know that buzz wasn't that strong. I could tell from the general public, or online, or even with my group of friends that I see films with that the buzz wasn't as strong. I had a feeling that the fanboy community would make a big splash on the friday, but that the rest of the movie going audience wouldn't be as motivated to see it this time around. I mean were you MORE excited to see this than the first? Cause that's what it comes down to.   As far as why the predictions were so high, I think alot got too ahead of themselves on the ticket sales and weren't paying attention to the general public. Also an article that says ""Avengers 2 set to break all time opening record"" gets far more page views than ""Avengers 2 set to debut less than first"", which means more add revenue, you get my drift? Plus you're allowed to lie with a prediction."
boxoffice,35egz7,jburd22,2,Sun May 10 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"In general, I agree with you. A lot of the reviews weren't as positive, but I also heard buzz about it from diverse groups who probably weren't even Marvel fans. Personally, I wasn't all that excited about the first Avengers (and definitely not after a 2nd viewing), but I'm not the norm. I MUCH preferred Guardians of the Galaxy.  Here's an article that quotes Bloomberg Business as predicting a $217m opening weekend, and it mentions that Disney ""has been talking a huge game."" So while you and I might have been more moderate in our predictions, the industry was poised for a 'bigger than Avengers' take. Oh, and thanks for the  polite reply while presenting your opposing view!  P.S. I agree with you about ""The Perfect Storm,"" on the first movie. I think Marvel did an unprecedented, brilliant marketing job leading up to the first Avengers movie, and I think they deserve AT LEAST half the credit for it's success. My opinion only, but I think Joss did an adequate, but not brilliant job of delivering a movie that capitalized on that marketing effort (while copying the ending of Independence Day), but basically got handed the keys to that success on a silver platter."
boxoffice,35egz7,DeeBased,3,Sun May 10 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"Also, trust me, marvels not worried. Avengers is the exception, it's impossible to recreate that perfect storm of a release.

boxoffice,35egz7,jburd22,0,Sun May 10 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"I am going to keep it simple: You very, very clearly stated that it was a 66% drop Friday-to-Friday because of 24 million on Thursday. What you did was ADD the 24 million from Thursday to Friday's numbers because you did not know Friday's box office numbers ALREADY included Thursday.  Please stop your BS ---you were wrong so do not make it worse by continuing to make stuff up.  Why are you still ranting. You agree with me.  Here, again, is a direct quote and the FIRST thing you said: """"75% percent is bad, but it's not really 75%.""""  Well sorry bud but it WAS 75%. So according to what YOU said---that ""is bad"".  Let me guess know that you realize AuO did have a 75% Friday-to-Friday drop suddenly you are going to do some revisionist BS and spin why 75% drop is not bad when you explicitly stated it was.  You are a fanboy freak. I like Marvel movies as well but this entire thread has nothing to do with liking a movie---it is about BOX OFFICE numbers. That is it. I absolutely hate the F&F series and am baffled why they even exist---but it makes a shit ton of money.  AuO is a box office disappointment. Disney might spin it but it was without question supposed to at least match A1 and they 100% expected to beat A1. That is not going to happen. AuO is trailing wayyy behind A1. That is not good.

It was YOU that said ""75% percent is bad, but it's not really 75%"". That is YOUR WORDS. Not mine---YOURS. Direct quote. You tried to start some argument and lost and lost badly. You lost within the first sentence. Let me quote you again so you get it: ""75% percent is bad, but it's not really 75%.""  So I guess the bigger question is------did you read anything YOU said? Well sorry champ but it was 75% so according to you AuO did 'bad'. Your words not mine.

boxoffice,35egz7,jburd22,-1,Sun May 10 17:07:13 2015 UTC,Oh btw.  Let us say AuO makes 85 million in its second weekend.  The first Avengers made over 103 million.   The more I look at it AuO seems much more likely to hit $400-$450 US total. If a sequel makes 67% its predecessor US total that is alarming for Marvel. Is it a 'the sky is falling'? Absolutely not but it is very concerning. Trends start somewhere and it is always alarm to any studio that their cash cow has peaked and is in decline.
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,5,Sun May 10 07:46:00 2015 UTC,I don't think it's something to be concerned about. we are talking about a film that will eclipse 1 billion dollars and be a top 10 film earner.  The only alarm here is to make more films. How many films released this year will do that? 3?
boxoffice,35egz7,RulesoftheDada,1 point,Sun May 10 08:10:38 2015 UTC,I said it is something for a studio to be ALARMED at. The Amazing Spiderman 2 made what--700 million and Sony immediately knew that was a major disappointment.  What you seem to not understand is that the nobody is saying 'the sky is falling'---but you. The point is that as a Marvel exec it is a tad ALARMING as AuO was not well received and even with the hype is failing and falling to meet box office numbers. It could be an outlier but TRENDS start somewhere.  Also---films like this making 1 billion dollars is simply not that much. Studios have to spend insane amount of cash to market a film globally. Movie theaters take a large amount of cash (For later weekends it can be over 50% of ticket sales). Also as I stated above--studios make even worse margins in foreign markets. China only gives 25% of Chinese box office to the studio for example.
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,2,Sun May 10 15:42:24 2015 UTC,I never said the sky is falling anywhere in this debate.
boxoffice,35egz7,RulesoftheDada,1 point,Sun May 10 19:15:26 2015 UTC,Nor did I say it AuO box office disappointment was a 100% proof that Marvel's MCU has peaked.
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,2,Sun May 10 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"How do you know it has peaked? Civil War, Infinity Wars, GotG all have potential to make $400-500 + million and $1-1.5+ billion WW easily. That's $4-5 billion for 4 movies. Plus all the other Marvel movies, could be $10 billion for Disney/Marvel. Disney could effectively buy a few nations with the money they will make with Marvel and Star Wars. Disney Land could actually become a sovereign nation and no one would/could do shit."
boxoffice,35egz7,Adam87,0,Sun May 10 11:54:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know which is why I never, ever in any shape-way-or-form said I know it has peaked."
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,3,Sun May 10 14:55:24 2015 UTC,I think global will keep cruising and make up for a lackluster US haul. I'd love for it to make less globally than Avengers because then Furious 7 will keep hold of #3 all-time until Star Wars.
boxoffice,35egz7,pm_me_ur_pajamas,0,Sun May 10 13:55:23 2015 UTC,It will probably make over a billion but is not going to come close to beating A1.
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,3,Sun May 10 14:55:54 2015 UTC,"AoU has already made over $800m in three weeks. It'll easily make $1.4b, just a question of if international markets see steep enough drops to stop it from $1.5b."
boxoffice,35egz7,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Sun May 10 17:47:36 2015 UTC,"Here is your problem. It will probably not make much more than 150 million in the US from now and honestly it might not even make that.  It opened in most international markets WEEKS ago. African, South Africa, India, all of Europe--it opened up BEFORE it opened in the US and in many of the larger markets (UK, Russia, France, etc) it opened up a 3 weeks or more ago so there will be very little more money coming from those markets.  The only place AuO has left are Japan and China. Now Japan and China are the 2 largest box offices outside the US but we need to remember a few things.  The FIRST Avengers made 86 million in China and 45 million in Japan. Japan is a tough one and I can EASILY see AuO not even beating A1 in Japan.  China is a different story as every year US films become more popular in China but they are rarely 'super hero films'. They prefer films like F&F and Transformers to superhero films. The top 7 grossing US films in China--none are superhero films.  Iron Man 3 comes in at #8  It is at $875 million NOW and that $875 million includes all markets beside China and Japan being open 2 or more weeks. AuO is also showing to have very weak 'legs' as it is dropping MUCH faster than A1 did.   See: a) A1 dropped 50% in US from 1st to 2nd weekend AuO dropped 60% in US from 1st to 2nd weekend  b) AuO earned about only about 71% of what A1 did the Monday-Thursday after release in the US.  In Brazil AI made 63 million but AuO seems to likely to be less than 50 million.  In France AI made 19 million opening weekend...AuO made 12.5 million and AuO is falling faster than AI  So lets look at the numbers. $875 million worldwide total today.  1) It has made $312 million in the US through 2 weeks. At this point A1 had made$373 million so AuO is over $61 million behind A1 but it is important to remember that AuO has shown to have much weaker legs than A1 and is 'dropping' faster than A1 by a pretty substantial margin. A1 made $623 million US. Now I am going to be nice and just keep the difference the same; thus I am going to act like AuO will ONLY make its current $61 million 'deficit' it currently has. That means I am going to pretend AuO will match the legs A1 had post 2nd weekend. This is being very nice because AuO is dropping much faster than A1 and in reality AuO will without doubt make $100-$150 less than A1 did domestically but I am being nice. Anyway that means $623 - $61 million = $560 million US. It has already earned $312 million so that would required it to earn an ADDITIONAL $248 million in the US. This is not going to happen at all --not even close but we are going to pretend.  2) Japan. A1 made $45 million in Japan. I have said that you should not be surprised if AuO makes less than that but I am again going to be nice and say that AuO makes $60 million in Japan 3) China is of course the curve ball here. A1 made $86 million in China. I can see Auo making as little as $80 million to over little over $200 million in China---it is just hard to know. I am going to go swing for the fences a bit and say AuO way out does itself over A1 and makes $175 million which is over double what A1 did. 4) Another 40 million in the 'rest of the world' outside US, Japan, China ($40 million is probably going to be very generous. It will probably be closer to half that amount)  So lets do some addition $875 + $248 + $60 + $175 = 1.398 billion.  So I even with my extremely generous numbers AuO falls just short of $1.4 billion.   A much more accurate estimate would be $1.25 billion total worldwide. So when you make the statement: ""It'll easily make $1.4b, just a question of if international markets "" the math says ""Nope"". It will in no shape way or form be 'easy'.  The only reasonable way AuO makes $1.5 billion would be for Japan and China to give it over $400 million---which is just not at all going to happen."

boxoffice,35egz7,mrstickball,0,Sun May 10 17:14:28 2015 UTC,Foreign box office are EXTREMELY hard to predict and it grows EVERY year but it is highly doubtful it will make 1.5 billion.
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,1 point,Sun May 10 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say it should hit it and end up right at $1.5 billion.  As of today, its at $875m worldwide without a dollar from China. US alone will put it at $1.0 billion. The original Avengers did $900m overseas, and all the data we have states that AoU is doing about 15-20% better overseas than the original. That would put AoU at about $1,475 - $1,520 million worldwide, assuming a $440m domestic run."
boxoffice,35egz7,mrstickball,1 point,Sun May 10 18:40:48 2015 UTC,Your numbers are way off. $1.5 billion is way out of reach and would require China to give AuO well over $275 which would be about 325% increase over A1 so that is a pipe dream.
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,2,Sun May 10 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"Where are my numbers off? Tell me, please, where they are off."

boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,0,Sun May 10 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"I have no clue where you are getting your numbers but they are made up.  Let us compare largest foreign box offices and see where AuO is compared to where A1 was at the same time:  (US, China, Japan are 1-3 the rest below are in order from largest to smallest)  1) France through first 2 weekends: A1--25.82  AuO--23.84  Equals: AuO 92.3% of A1  2) Uk through the first 2 weekends A1--48.22 AuO--48.92  Equals: AuO 101% A1"
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,0,Sun May 10 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, I am getting my numbers here:  http://deadline.com/2015/05/international-box-office-pitch-perfect-2-australia-avengers-age-of-ultron-furious-7-hot-pursuit-1201423936/  Top countries outside of the US are Korea ($74m / $50m final for A1), UK ($61.5m / $80m final for A1), and Mexico ($40m / $60m final for A1).   According to them, AoU is 20% ahead of The Avengers, and is only in 72% of all box offices at the moment, with China and Japan still to go. So again, adding 20% onto The Avenger's foreign gross + $440m domestic = over $1.5 billion. This assumes China follows historical trends and generates about $150m for Age of Ultron."
boxoffice,35egz7,mrstickball,0,Sun May 10 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"All nonsense. I will have to copy and paste because you do not get it: ""1) It has made $312 million in the US through 2 weeks.

Anybody claiming AuO is going to make 1.5 billion world wide is delusional or just really bad at math.  AuO is not going to make $560 in the US. It will make another $150 more from here on out. It will probably make $125 million in China Japan at $60 million is being nice but well within reason. In the REST of the globe AuO is pretty much tapped out and will not make much more money at all. I was being very nice with another $40 million coming from the rest of the world minus the Big 3 (US, China, Japan).  $1.2 to $1.25 billion is best bet and $1.5 billion is BS. Not going to happen."
boxoffice,35egz7,bluecamel2015,2,Sun May 10 19:15:07 2015 UTC,Are you willing to offer a ban bet on AoU making $1.4 billion? Because I will put up a 1 month ban bet on /r/BoxOffice if AoU doesn't make over $1.45 billion (since you are confident it will hit $1.4b or less).
boxoffice,35e223,wreun,5,Sat May 9 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"At this point it looks like it's going to finish its domestic run with $450-480 million. Quite impressive, but much lower than what the first did. It probably will end up grossing as much, if not more than the first one worldwide, thanks to international numbers."
boxoffice,35e223,JakkuScavenger,4,Sat May 9 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"Its so interesting that you can have a sequel like this that results in two wildly different numbers - Domestic, and overseas. I think, though, that if AoU ends up in that $450-500m range, it will just go to show how insane The Avenger's original run was.. When it was going on, I don't think people understood what a $200m 1st weekend + $100m second weekend was to the box office... Simply unprecedented by huge margins. AoU is simply returning the franchise to earth. At least in America."
boxoffice,35e223,mrstickball,3,Sat May 9 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"Its so interesting that you can have a sequel like this that results in two wildly different numbers - Domestic, and overseas.   It's mostly because the international box office is growing at a faster rate than the domestic."
boxoffice,35e223,JakkuScavenger,2,Sat May 9 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Oh certainly. Between that and the falling value of the dollar, there's a growing disparity between domestic and OS box offices. The fact that some blockbusters now do better in China than America is insane.. At one time, China was maybe 1/20th or 1/50th of the American market, and they were only known as a nation of pirates. Oh how things change in 15-20 years!"
boxoffice,35e223,mrstickball,3,Sat May 9 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"Consider several things about China: They have almost four times the population of USA (although I've no idea what ticket prices are over there) and they only get ~40 American movies released in cinemas each year, which makes every one of those kind of special."
boxoffice,35e223,JakkuScavenger,3,Sat May 9 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"Certainly, but the market is extremely new, and is still growing by leaps and bounds. Every year, a new movie breaks the record for highest-grossing movie in their market, which is incredible if you think about it."

boxoffice,35c8e2,mardfet,5,Sat May 9 04:38:34 2015 UTC,65-70? Even movies with the worst word of mouth dont average that. A drop like that is extremely rare and only happens with terrible movies.
boxoffice,35c8e2,SethR0gen,1 point,Sat May 9 10:16:49 2015 UTC,55-60% is for the weekend.. The original one that did over $200m on its opening weekend still managed about a 10-20% lower drop. So its notably more frontloaded than the original.
boxoffice,35c8e2,mrstickball,1 point,Sat May 9 14:28:46 2015 UTC,Yeah but it doesn't open in China until next week. Let's see what it does in China before thinking it's a far cry from the first movie. I think it'll still do just as well as the first movie.

The first two international weekends for the first Avengers was 342.5 million dollars while Age of Ultron was 369.2 million dollars.  Plus, it hasn't opened in China yet unlike the first Avengers.  Every single Phase 2 Marvel movie except Thor: The Dark World has made more money in China than the Avengers.  Chinese box office:  Avengers: 86.3 million  Iron Man 3: 121.2 million  Thor: The Dark World: 55.3 million  Captain America: The Winter Soldier: 115.6 million  Guardians of the Galaxy: 96.4 million  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&view=byweekend&wk=2012W17&id=avengers11.htm  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&view=byweekend&wk=2015W17&id=avengers2.htm"
boxoffice,35buv6,ItalianRicePie,1 point,Fri May 8 22:47:06 2015 UTC,So what is AoU likely to end up grossing in China? Is $300M a realistic target?
boxoffice,35buv6,mrstickball,2,Sat May 9 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think that no one knows. Marvel movies are not as well-performing in China as other markets, but both the market and the Marvel brand name are growing. I think the best they've done was Iron Man 3 at about $120m.   I think the over/under is $200m, but it could flirt with $300m if it found longevity."
boxoffice,35buv6,Peterfug,6,Sat May 9 14:54:28 2015 UTC,Probably seeing that...Avengers 2 is just under $700 mil and will take at least 2-4 weeks to catch up...where as Furious 7 is about $100 mil away
boxoffice,35buv6,Peterfug,5,Fri May 8 22:03:12 2015 UTC,"Furious 7 is definitely in the long tail though and might take 2 -4 weeks to make that 100 million and all the new competition doesn't help it. There's no new markets for Furious 7 to open in unlike Age of Ultron.  Last weekend Furious 7 made 56 million dollars worldwide. If Furious 7 makes around 30 million this weekend, Age of Ultron might pass it although I agree it's unlikely."
boxoffice,35buv6,ItsBobDoleYo,-3,Fri May 8 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"Well I still believe Furious will hit the mark before Avengers 2...Furious has been racking in its money faster The Acengers and hopefully faster than Avengers 2. I bet! Lol just kidding...I honestly dont care. The only films I am looking for to are Mad Max, Southpaw, The Martian, The Walk, Everest, and Star Wars of course"
boxoffice,35buv6,mrstickball,4,Fri May 8 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't even know if I'd bet that AoU will surpass A1, though strong foreign grosses makes it seem more likely that not"
boxoffice,35buv6,mrstickball,3,Fri May 8 23:51:27 2015 UTC,China is the wildcard. AOU is gonna be down $100-150 million domestically when its all said and done. All non-Chinese territories should make up most of that.. Leaving China to make or break the $1.5b  mark. It'll be VERY interesting to see where it ends up at.
boxoffice,3567af,mi-16evil,20,Thu May 7 13:14:53 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Mad Max will do more than $50m. I would LOVE to be proven wrong -- it's my most anticipated ""blockbuster"" of the summer -- but I have a feeling that the first weekend will be around $35m."
boxoffice,3567af,popdisaster00,10,Thu May 7 15:17:58 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what makes Max so unpredictable. I can see it making as low as $35 million and as high as $65 million. It's got a wide swath.

There aren't any big box office draws in it. I know Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are in it, but I don't think that either of them are going to pull a large number of people in."
boxoffice,3567af,trevdordurden,2,Thu May 7 13:50:07 2015 UTC,I'm normally against sequels of reboots. Mad Max is the alternative. You'll be pleased.
boxoffice,3567af,GoddammitCricket,15,Fri May 8 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"You guys are way overestimating this movie. It's not mainstream - at all. It's a very weird film, although the action is insane. It's essentially one car chase with breaks in between set pieces, just as Miller intended.  But neither Hardy or Theron are recognizable in the movie or the advertising. And even if they were, they're not box office stars in the slightest.  And Mad Max is a CULT hit, outside of the Internet, it's known but it's not massive, like say Star Wars or Ghostbusters, etc.  I think movie buffs, like us, will eat it up - it's a fucking great ride. But I cannot see it getting great WOM for curious moviegoers. I think more mainstream fare, like PP2, Tomorrowland, San Andreas will eat up its audience.  My prediction: $25M opening, $70M total  It'll most likely open in 3rd place, behind AOU and PP2."

AoU wasn't the first weekend mammoth I thought it would be, and the buzz isn't as rabid as Avengers 1 was. I think it's in for a steep drop-off this weekend.  Also Mad Max is R, which hurts it. But I don't think 50 or so for Max is out of the realm of possibility. I think it all depends on how much Ultron drops, which I think will be a lot. I don't see a whole lot of repeat viewings of this. Something I think that hurt weekend 1 more than the fight did."

Maybe too low but I see it becoming this years Edge of Tomorrow or Pacific Rim since no one I know is interested in it and it won't get very much attention with the general public IMO.

boxoffice,3567af,WaterStoryMark,2,Fri May 8 00:29:38 2015 UTC,Nice analysis/comments OP. I was shocked to see this get the budget it did. Happy for the director fulfilling his vision - we should really celebrate that. I've heard some buzz among film fans but for the general public this is more like John Carter. Think it'll open third because AoU will still suck part of the audience that would otherwise check it out.
boxoffice,3567af,wierdaaron,2,Fri May 8 01:04:56 2015 UTC,"Word of mouth will push Mad Max for a few weeks. Slightly underwhelming opening though, I think.

Modern audiences might have some name familiarity with the title, but the same is true of the Smurfs. Hardy and Theron are respected actors, but not box office draws in themselves. 50m seems like a safe opening weekend bet, with good reviews maybe pushing it toward 70-85 and bad reviews dropping it to 40m."

boxoffice,353ng4,mrstickball,16,Wed May 6 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"Sequels only outgross the original when there's room for growth. There are two ways to look at it:   If the first film is a surprise hit/sleeper that leaves an impression (POTC, Batman Begins, Twilight), then the sequel has a chance to build on that intial success to propel it to higher heights. But if the first film is an unprecdented success (Spider-Man, Star Wars, Avengers) it's hard for the follow-up film to match it.    Age of Ultron will probably finish in the $450 million range domestic and will be a monster overseas. Anywho thinks that's a disappointment is pretty ignorant."
boxoffice,353ng4,ChrisMill,15,Thu May 7 00:13:45 2015 UTC,"TL;DR:  I've seen this argument in /r/movies often about how Ultron was going to blow The Avengers out of the water. I kept stating that it was going to be nearly impossible for it to out-gross the original.. Domestically at least.   So I did some research of blockbusters and their sequels. I took movies that had their original title gross over $200m domestically, and compared it to the sequel. Of the 25 original movies that grossed >$200m, only 7 actually made more than the original movie - a telling sign of the likelihood of any sequel outgrossing the initial movie.  The data heavily suggests that (at least) the first sequel is far more likely than not to fail to out-gross the original movie by a rate of approximately 2.5 to 1.   The data isn't exhaustive in that it only tracks the 1st sequel. You can probably think of a fair number of franchises that had follow-ups that did better than the direct sequel, such as Iron Man 2/3, or the Harry Potter series."
boxoffice,353ng4,Dorkside,3,Wed May 6 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"So, given the incredible performance of Avatar do you think there's any chance the sequel could top it? Seems like too tall of an order but James Cameron movies do seem to defy the laws of the box office."
boxoffice,353ng4,DaveFincher,13,Wed May 6 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"Domestically, its going to be insanely hard, because what Avatar did was beyond unprecedented.... Well, other than Titanic.   I think the challenge for Avatar 2, if it wants to top the original, is if its able to incorporate some sort of Zeitgeist-y hook to get people to keep coming back again and again. Avatar had the advantage of being the premier 3D movie, which helped both its per-ticket average and its overall run since no one else really had the capability to go toe-to-toe with it.  However, internationally, it should be a lock to outgross Avatar 1. The movie did $200m 5 years ago in China and $100m in South Korea, which may as well of been last century.   I think Avatar 2 could/wound flirt with $2.5 - $3.0 billion internationally, and would just about be a lock for the 1st movie to hit $3.0 billion or even $3.5 billion worldwide, which of course would be beyond anything we've seen. But domestically, I think it'd probably look at $500m unless something happens to where it offers something for US moviegoers to come back to 10-15 times (ala Titanic, ala Avatar).  Also, as an addendum - I think that we look at sequels a lot differently (probably) than movie studios. We look at them thinking that they are making them because they have to do better than the original. Movies studios probably look at them, knowing that even if the sequel doesn't out-gross the original, that it'll at least make XXX amount of money, and the first one cost YYY to produce. Even if Avatar ""bombed"" in the US to $350-400m and did $1.5 billion OS (which is less likely than it making $2.5 billion overseas, IMO), no movie producer or Cameron is going to care, because its still probably going to net them more money than pretty much any other movie made outside of said Titanic and Avatar 1... And for that, they'll keep making sequels."
boxoffice,353ng4,hamlet9000,5,Wed May 6 21:48:50 2015 UTC,Never underestimate James Cameron.
boxoffice,353ng4,FockerFGAA,2,Wed May 6 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"So, given the incredible performance of Avatar do you think there's any chance the sequel could top it?   There's always a chance, but Avatar had huge legs because its 3D technology was unlike anything we had seen before and people went back again and again and again to see it in all its awesome glory.  Expecting to capture that lightning a second time seems doubtful. Particularly because public opinion on the first movie has soured considerably in the face of a major backlash to its success.  Although I wouldn't count Cameron out: Titanic had massive legs, too, for completely different reasons. The guy obviously knows how to make films."
boxoffice,353ng4,karneykode,1 point,Fri May 8 01:10:22 2015 UTC,Avatar came out at the height of the 3D craze and because of that basically sold at a 50% markup to other movies. Avatar 2 would need that same 3D desire and the market just doesn't appear to be there.

From the reviews, I don't need to spend $15 to see a ho-hum by the numbers Marvel movie. I'll wait until it comes out on STARZ or Netflix to see it. Full disclosure, I'm more of a DC Comics fan, but I've been really wanting to see a good Marvel film that is beyond just by the numbers action and snappy dialogue. They're all flash and no substance. The last two Marvel films that I've really liked  was Kenneth Branagh's Thor (had a great Shakespearean quality to it, that made it special) and the first Captain America (it had heart and was sincere, and Tommy Lee Jones stole the show). Iron Man 3 was decent, I'm a big fan of the director, but Stark's PTSD was a complete asspull and completely unearned."

boxoffice,34we3x,tkeiy714,7,Tue May 5 06:27:41 2015 UTC,"I just felt it was very uncharacteristic of the Tony Stark that we had gotten three films before. I'll watch em, but dont expect me to immediately jump on the band wagon just because its marvel. DC has an identity, just like Marvel, it just happens to be the polar opposite, it took them to find their footing. They tried to emulate the success of Marvel with GL but failed because it emulated the tone of Marvel films. Let Marvel do what it wants with its tone, that's fine, more power to them. DC is doing their thing with a more down to earth and thematic approach. I like DCs approach better so far because even if they have stumbled, they are more substantive. When I went out of MoS, I was amazed at how thematically rich it was and the implications of a god like being on planet earth, and how it carries over to next films. Virtual studies have shown that the final battle between Supes and Zod caused 129,000 deaths, a million injuries, $700 billion in damages, and had a total economic impact of $2 trillion. A great deal of that will be the focus of BvS. MoS was far from perfect in dialogue and sometimes pacing, but it got you thinking, which is what I want out of a film. The problem with Marvel I have, is that there is little that I take away from the films once I see them. I would love for Marvel film to really have some substantial themes that makes you ponder the film.  Again I applaud Marvel for the success that they have, and hope they do well because then everyone wins. Many of their films I really enjoy. But most of them it seems, save for Captain America 1, Thor 1, and Iron Man 1, have been ultimately forgettable unfortunately."
boxoffice,34we3x,grayk47,1 point,Tue May 5 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"Avengers 2 is getting bad reviews as critics who are in no way a fan of comics are starting to get tired of ""Marvel"" movies. I liked Avengers 2 a lot, and it seems to me that many of the bad reviews were petty attempts to tarnish the superhero genre rather than genuine commentary on the film. They often focus on the fact the movie was ""too visually loud"" or ""didn't have enough quirky Whedonism."" Is a movie which spent $200 million on special effects not supposed to have a lot of explosions and fighting? I certainly felt Whedons touch in the movie. Its no two hour long Buffy/Angel dialogue, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Also, Thor is my favorite Marvel/Disney movie as well. Branaughs presentation of Asgard is so perfectly epic. It was the first time in a long time that an alien world actually wowed me in a movie.  Edit/tl;dr: Critics seem to be accusing Avengers 2 of being dumb like a Micheal Bay movie. I think that's a petty, flawed criticism of the movie."
boxoffice,34we3x,GeneralissimoFranco,3,Tue May 5 14:51:42 2015 UTC,"Many of the reviews that I've read that were critical of it, accuse it of being just a bunch of checked boxes that needed to be included and not bringing anything new to the table. Now I cannot judge the film yet but since Avengers minus IM3, I would agree with the statement that Marvel has really fallen in a rut of playing it safe and not really adding anything to the table. Pretty much every movie I have seen of Marvel after Thor and Captain America in 2011 (I have seen them all except A2) feel like the same movie. Funny cast with boring plotline and terribly forgettable villains.  Marvel took a risk with GotG, I commend them for that. But even then it was largely forgettable, it was an Avengers in space with the same shortcomings. It was immensely funny with a great ensemble cast, but the plot was forgettable and the villain/s were atrocious.   Superhero genre in the last decade has been demanding that the audience take their films seriously and demand respect and in doing so, critics have the right to call out the MCU as being stagnant with their scripts.   What separates Michael Bay's Transformers from the MCU is that Transformers knows that it is dumb and embraces it, it doesn't care if has a dumb plot. But when you bring Joss Whedon and Kenneth Branagh into the picture, I expect those writers and directors to push that envelope."

I don't have my picks for this week yet, but just by way of explanation I figured that Adaline would take second place because it was the only major movie out that hits the demographics that Ultron/The Fight of the Century didn't dominate.   I think this coming weekend is going to be a tough one.   EDIT: Damn."

I would have been there opening night if it were not for the NFL draft.  Also when I worked delivering pizza on Saturday night 90% of our orders were large party orders and deliveries to people hosting parties for the fight.  A lot of those people were men in their twenties and thirties.  Pretty much the core demographic for Avengers."

boxoffice,34t4m3,bluntmasterflash,1 point,Mon May 4 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"I would say yes as well but I honestly expected a bit of a dip. The first Avengers was an event. It was the first time all those characters came together, this is just a sequel. And they will be back because movies have been announced for like 10 years.                       I think internationally it will do well because it is a spectacle and they want to see those stars on screen, but domestically I expect it to fall a little short."
boxoffice,34t4m3,GoldandBlue,17,Mon May 4 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"This just seems like damage control to me, they said it probably took off ~$10m to the weekend gross. It should hardly matter in the long term, considering people who didn't see it this weekend will most likely see it next."
boxoffice,34t4m3,Republican_Atheist,5,Mon May 4 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"I really don't buy the excuse. If you wanted to see the movie opening weekend and watch the fight, there were more than ample opportunities to do so, even more than normal. You could have seen the film Thursday night, Friday night, any other time on Saturday, or any time on Sunday. This sounds like Avengers-apologism to me."
boxoffice,34t4m3,scolbert08,10,Mon May 4 15:23:36 2015 UTC,The fight still cost 100 dollars. Some people can spend money on the PPV and Avengers tickets. Others had to make a choice.

Due to there is access to a cam torrent for a week, and a week worth of possible spoilers. Also often I am interested in seeing a movie, and don't get around to seeing it in theaters for awhile, a month after opening when I finally have a chance to see it, the excitement isn't the same and I instead wait for the home release. I wonder if the anticipation is lowered after it is already released around the world for 1 week, and other people discussing it, before North America can watch it."

I'm sure this is a far greater percentage of viewers than those that would pirate it in that week.   The not-quite-really Pirate in me says ""why the fuck would I bother to watch it in a format I can barely see when I can see it in beautiful imax next week""   How often this release strategy happens also leads me to believe p that has to be some sort of benefit to it.

boxoffice,34t4m3,BurnerAcctNo1,1 point,Mon May 4 14:13:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't go because when I looked for tickets at the theaters with assigned seating, I didn't like the choices and I didn't want to go to the theater 2 hours early in order to get good seats at a place without assigned seating.  This is why I don't really understand the importance of the opening weekend for big blockbusters.  I understand it for smaller movies simply because of how quickly they fall off, but a blockbuster like this isn't going to fall into that category."

boxoffice,34s09l,Bugger217,4,Mon May 4 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, domestic will smaller than the original but foreign really carries a film these days. Like stupid carry...something like 75%. So when Avengers 3 hits and people want to know why we have to wait 1-2 weeks to see it while everyone else in the world has seen it, just gotta think back to this moment"
boxoffice,34s09l,Peterfug,10,Mon May 4 05:37:05 2015 UTC,It's mainly because it didnt beat the originals opening weekend. Other factors play into it but that's the main one.
boxoffice,34s09l,Peterfug,1 point,Mon May 4 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"It is definitely arguable that it didn't gross as much because of the underwhelming ""Fight of the Century"" that was viewed widely.  I think it'll gross more than the first Avengers."
boxoffice,34s09l,Alfskill,3,Mon May 4 04:57:01 2015 UTC,It will gross more worldwide but not domestically. The fight had a decent effect but I think the lukewarm word of mouth will have some people just waiting for the dvd or redbox

boxoffice,34s09l,mardfet,1 point,Thu May 7 12:04:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that it would make a billion, just that will make more than your average summer blockbuster, thus making it an even bigger box office year."

There's no guarantee that Hot Pursuit won't open to $75M or that Avengers IW P2 won't open to $6M. Granted it probably won't happen but there's no guarantee. Nobody guessed Guardians would be the highest movie of the summer or American Sniper the highest of the year.

boxoffice,34q3tl,NeilPoonHandler,14,Sun May 3 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"Now I'm wondering how long it will be before we see another $200m weekend. It only took 2 years after the first $100m opening weekend for another movie to reach that landmark. It's now been 3 years since Avengers and the only movie in the foreseeable future that had a shot at reaching $200m again, Avengers 2, has failed to do so."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Juswantedtono,20,Sun May 3 17:03:00 2015 UTC,I think The Force Awakens has a decent shot at a $200 million opening weekend so we still might see one this year.
boxoffice,34q3tl,Dorkside,20,Sun May 3 17:23:13 2015 UTC,December releases usually open smaller and then have long legs

boxoffice,34q3tl,Piker10,21,Sun May 3 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"Of course it isn't opening small, but the December opening weekend record is $84mil for The Hobbit. Star Wars will definitely shatter that record, but does anyone really think it'll nearly triple the current December record?"
boxoffice,34q3tl,JamesHouse,3,Sun May 3 19:29:31 2015 UTC,I say you're correct. $135 mill opening with only 30% drop
boxoffice,34q3tl,LukeDiaz,3,Sun May 3 22:43:18 2015 UTC,"I think it'll break $170 million at the very least - if you adjust for ticket price inflation for ROTS, and it sells as many tickets in its first weekend as that movie did Wednesday through Sunday (which I sincerely believe could be underselling it), it will break $200 million domestically its first weekend, regardless of its release being in winter. Don't underestimate the power of that franchise's fandom."

So there is that going for it.   $200m is a tall order, but I think that given that it'll be the first Marvel-esque opening in December.. It can do it. Alternatively, we've seen a ton of movies do unfathomable numbers in November, so I don't see how opening up 3 weeks later than Catching Fire."
boxoffice,34q3tl,mrstickball,6,Mon May 4 03:17:17 2015 UTC,Not a chance.
boxoffice,34q3tl,SethR0gen,2,Sun May 3 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"While possible,  I don't think it's very likely. December releases are usually slow to start. I think the next films to have a real shot are Batman V Superman and Captain America 3."
boxoffice,34q3tl,gmark109,12,Sun May 3 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"Cap 3 isn't breaking 200 million if this movie couldn't. Cap 2 did 95, the addition of Iron Man isn't gonna push it over 150"

boxoffice,34q3tl,Fripples,1 point,Sun May 3 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Cap 3 is a very long shot. Marvel movies are still on top but they're not going to see any more explosive growth, the fight is now to maintain the hype more than take it to the next level, it will open above 100 probably, maybe 150, accounting for added characters.  Batman v Superman only if it looks really good up to release date, Man of Steel didn't generate that much optimism and a lot of people are reserved following the teaser. If the trailers look awesome and the reviews are good then it could reach 200. DC does not look to be doing a very good job with any of their movies so far in my eyes.  Avatar 2 is also going for a Christmas open so no chance really, think the love for the original has also waned when viewed in retrospect and the visuals won't have the same impact this time around.  The real candidates is Star Wars VIII which opens May 2017, though of course it depends on how well VII is recieved."
boxoffice,34q3tl,enlightened-giraffe,1 point,Mon May 4 11:07:46 2015 UTC,"If they released in any other month yes, for Christmas, not realistically. It will however make huge bank throughout january though."

boxoffice,34q3tl,Janitor3333,5,Sun May 3 18:07:16 2015 UTC,You have to remember that most blockbusters are sequels or part of a franchise. Avatar came in as a stand alone film with only James Cameron hype (which is huge to be fair).   This is why it's opening weekend didn't have the usual patterns.  Overall though how  James Cameron made 2.8 billion dollars... only one man knows.   Also I'm fully expecting a 60-70% drop for AoU.  Edit: It also got the record for the largest opening weekend of any original film.
boxoffice,34q3tl,Janitor3333,4,Sun May 3 18:24:31 2015 UTC,Good old 2009. I remember everyone declaring Avatar a flop after its opening weekend.
boxoffice,34q3tl,Dorkside,4,Sun May 3 18:38:27 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was a really bad weather weekend as well.   Really cold and snow storms in the north east.
boxoffice,34q3tl,enlightened-giraffe,1 point,Sun May 3 19:44:02 2015 UTC,Avatar 2 releases on Christmas day so it won't touch 200 either.

boxoffice,34q3tl,jordanb18,2,Mon May 4 11:08:39 2015 UTC,I seriously think Star Wars will crack it. Batman v Superman also has a very strong chance.
boxoffice,34q3tl,Dorkside,11,Mon May 4 01:22:34 2015 UTC,Pretty crazy that a $187 million dollar opening weekend could be considered disappointing but I think that's what we have with Age of Ultron as almost everyone seemed to have it as a lock to clear $200 million.
boxoffice,34q3tl,Janitor3333,13,Mon May 4 02:46:59 2015 UTC,Well it has done worse than the prequel. I think it will drop off just as hard in the second week too.

I know I went to a midnight showing just so I could watch the fight, and the buzz around the fight was crazy, definitely more people talking about that then Avengers."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Dorkside,32,Sun May 3 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"Considering how boring the ""fight of the century"" was I think it's likely this will be the last time a boxing match has any significant impact on the box office."

Even in NBA, they're planning on taking away a technique that forces the other team's worst free throw shooter to shoot free throws because it isn't appealing enough for the casual fan. Commercials have to be 30 seconds or we get bored, songs need to be catchy right away, not a minute into the song. Not saying heavyweight fights were slow but welterweight tends to be faster.  Also two of the biggest boxers of our generation are welterweights. That's just how it is. Rondy Rousey is huge in UFC but... she's a female. And we never really thought womens' any sport would take off but now she's the biggest MMA fighter in the world. Huge attraction. So things change, culture changes, it happens."

I like boxing - Mayweather was fantastic, as much as I don't like him as a person he played the game amazingly well.   But the majority of people don't think of boxing as a game or a sport, they want to see people beat the tar out of each other - which is what you will find far more of in the heavyweight levels of boxing."

boxoffice,34q3tl,Fripples,9,Sun May 3 19:05:29 2015 UTC,Box Office Mojo speculates it might have cost Avengers about 5 to 10M.
boxoffice,34q3tl,gaffney2010,1 point,Sun May 3 21:53:13 2015 UTC,"I kind of took that as a conservative estimate, but it probably isn't too much larger.  I wonder how much of the lost ticket sales won't just watch next week?  This may help offset what is starting to look like a dramatic first-to-second weekend drop."
boxoffice,34q3tl,jadamsmash,7,Mon May 4 04:19:36 2015 UTC,"I saw Age of Ultron, and then watched the fight. Two major disappointments in one day!"
boxoffice,34q3tl,jadamsmash,3,Sun May 3 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"So I'm not allowed to find a fight and movie underwhelming? I thought Age of Ultron was entertaining, I just expected so much more."
boxoffice,34q3tl,xodarkstarox,1 point,Sun May 3 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah the effect was absolutely huge. I work at a popular movie theater and our busiest time, around 7-8, was completely dead. And all night after that was completely dead as well. It started to slow down around 5, so it didn't give it any time that day to make any money."
boxoffice,34q3tl,enlightened-giraffe,1 point,Sun May 3 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"In the last few days the hype was huge, much more than AoU hype in my social circle which i didn't expect at all, it must have eaten at least 10 mil out of AoU's box office."
boxoffice,34q3tl,NeilPoonHandler,9,Sun May 3 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"Post was removed by spam filter and I approved, sorry about that."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Janitor3333,10,Sun May 3 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"This was still an excellent opening, IMO, even though it is a bit disappointing that it was unable to top the first film's opening weekend."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Fripples,6,Mon May 4 08:04:16 2015 UTC,"How come they don't count sundays, do they just mean Friday and Saturday when they say opening weekend?"
boxoffice,34q3tl,demusdesign,7,Mon May 4 11:11:07 2015 UTC,"This number includes Sunday estimates, which are usually pretty accurate."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Janitor3333,11,Sun May 3 15:44:54 2015 UTC,I would really love to see some of the algorithms behind this. It's always fascinated me how they know if I'm going to choose to go to a movie on Sunday or not.
boxoffice,34q3tl,enlightened-giraffe,5,Sun May 3 17:33:59 2015 UTC,Thank you.
boxoffice,34q3tl,jadamsmash,1 point,Sun May 3 18:06:42 2015 UTC,It may get a bump in actuals since it's hard to estimate how many people that ditched going to the theater saturday evening for the fight will go on Sunday.
boxoffice,34q3tl,gaffney2010,12,Sun May 3 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"The gross is a perfect reflection of the movie imo. Good, but totally underwhelming. Instead of taking it to new heights, age of ultron was a very safe and formulaic approach. It doesn't deserve to make as much as the first. They better step their game up for the next one."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Elementium,3,Sun May 3 18:37:38 2015 UTC,They don't really have to step their game up for the next movie.  They could just continue being only extremely highly grossing for a long time.
boxoffice,34q3tl,SethR0gen,2,Sun May 3 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"If they decide to make avengers 3 as by the numbers as 2, people just won't give it good reviews. It'll still make money, but not what it should make. And it'll tarnish the reputation of the rest of the mcu."
boxoffice,34q3tl,wmeredith,2,Mon May 4 11:12:35 2015 UTC,"In a way I expected it. Avengers was like the premier episode of a TV show, AoU was mid season filler (of a good tv show!) but they couldn't really do anything crazy, they have to save that. Hopefully Infinite War will be the two part grande finale where all the guns come out."
boxoffice,34q3tl,ofMilwaukee,1 point,Sun May 3 17:51:12 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity do you think the 75% and 6.7/10 on rottentomtatoes is an accurate reflection of what the movie deserves critically?
boxoffice,34q3tl,FartingBob,1 point,Sun May 3 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. They made a movie that will be liked by most people, even if no one absolutely loves it."
boxoffice,34q3tl,darknessflamegundam,2,Mon May 4 01:47:41 2015 UTC,It probably could have done better in a couple weeks...college exam weeks and all
boxoffice,34q3tl,darknessflamegundam,7,Mon May 4 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"First weekend of May has been the standard biggest opening weekend slot for a while in the US though, which is why it opened then, because Marvel knew it could pick any weekend and every other remotely competing film would move out it's way."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Rias_Gremoryy,-3,Mon May 4 04:00:02 2015 UTC,I still think that domestically it will do better than the first one as well as worldwide. It doesn't have any major competition for the next couple weeks and the drop-offs won't be that bad.
boxoffice,34q3tl,darknessflamegundam,7,Mon May 4 13:16:34 2015 UTC,"This upcoming weekend is gonna be pretty dry, sure. I don't expect Hot Pursuit to do incredibly well. The week after, however, sees Mad Max and Pitch Perfect 2. I think both of them will perform well.  Ultimately, I think Ultron will fall short of the first movie domestically, but that slack will be made up for overseas."
boxoffice,34q3tl,Mybrainmelts,5,Sun May 3 19:36:58 2015 UTC,See I still think Ultron will be #1 that weekend if only barely. Pitch perfect 2 will not take a lot from it and mad max will only take the older fans. And a lot of people who haven't seen the film probably have not done so b/c of maypac fight (which I heard was pretty dissapointing lol). But I guess we will just have to wait and see.
boxoffice,34q3tl,Dorkside,7,Sun May 3 23:33:21 2015 UTC,mad max will only take the older fans   Not true. Mad Max has had amazing trailers and people are starting to talk about it. I had never seen Mad Max but the sand-fire storm in the trailer sold at least one ticket from me.
boxoffice,34q3tl,enlightened-giraffe,5,Sun May 3 16:38:16 2015 UTC,I meant the 17 and over crowd. Parents won't take their kids to see mad max over avengers.
boxoffice,34q3tl,hamlet9000,1 point,Sun May 3 16:48:42 2015 UTC,I haven't seen it because I am busy studying for finals
boxoffice,34q3tl,darknessflamegundam,1 point,Sun May 3 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"I actually think Hot Pursuit might be something of a sleeper hit, but I still don't see it taking any significant amount of business away from Age of Ultron."
boxoffice,34q3tl,hamlet9000,1 point,Sun May 3 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"I wish all the best for Mad Max but the marketing push has been pretty week, it looks amazing to me but i don't think it will do that well."
boxoffice,34q3tl,darknessflamegundam,4,Sun May 3 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"What gives a movie legs is something unique; it needs to create an itch that can only be scratched at the movie theater.  Avengers provided that with the Battle of New York, featuring live action superhero team fighting unlike anything previously seen on film.  Age of Ultron raises the overall ante (it includes 4-5 action sequences that are on the level of the Battle of New York), but if you want to scratch that itch for watching awesome superhero team action sequences you can do it by slipping Avengers into your BluRay. Lots of people (including myself) will see the film a second time, but it won't be as many people.  This made it very unlikely that Age of Ultron would have a better opening weekend than the original Avengers (which was already playing to a saturated audience while benefiting from a large number of people going back repeatedly on opening weekend). It makes it even less likely that it will improve on the long-term domestic numbers."
boxoffice,34q3tl,SethR0gen,1 point,Sun May 3 17:32:21 2015 UTC,Although worldwide is possible but I think it is best to just wait and see.
boxoffice,34r3y3,PrettyFkinFarFromOK,2,Sun May 3 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Nice write-up!  I believe Age of Ultron will manage to at least break $500 million and Rogue Nation will clear $200 million.  I think Tomorrowland could exceed expectations and become yet another Disney movie to break $200 million this year, though another part of me feels it could go the other way and fail to pass over $100 million. It's one of the movies whose performance I'll be most interested in this summer.  Other than that, I think all my predictions would be pretty close to yours."
boxoffice,34r3y3,Dorkside,4,Sun May 3 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Haha I feel pretty mixed about Tomorrowland as well. I'm just crossing my fingers that it doesn't become Brad Bird's John Carter.  I highly doubt breaking $500 million is on the radar, but at the very best it's still going to wind up over $110 million below the first one. The legginess of the first one was hugely due to the fact that characters from 4 hugely successful movies are present in the same movie (which led to an unreal level of hype) but say the second one even has a 2.7x multiplier, it'll still end up at just ~$510 million (now I'm saying ""just"" because of the scale that we're looking at)  I really hope Rogue Nation clears $200 million! I guess my estimate is more on the pessimistic side, I was planning on saying that it might end up in the $195 million region."
boxoffice,34r3y3,mardfet,1 point,Sun May 3 21:15:53 2015 UTC,"IM FAMOUS <3   These are actually some pretty good predictions. I mean it changes week to week, some I'm sure I'd guess higher or lower by the time it's coming out but long range these seem reasonable."
boxoffice,34r3y3,mardfet,1 point,Mon May 4 22:39:41 2015 UTC,although I guess I cheated a bit because I'm into statistical modeling
boxoffice,34p08k,SethR0gen,12,Sun May 3 05:45:38 2015 UTC,"Anectodal evidence of course, but I left my theater today at around 12:30 am and streets were empty. I hung out at my friends house for a bit and on the way home there was a lot more cars, around 2 am, so a lot of people were watching this fight. Movie was awesome btw. The reviews made me lower my expectations, and I wasn't blown away, but it was a great 2.5 hours. Better than furious 7"
boxoffice,34p08k,LukeDiaz,7,Sun May 3 06:51:29 2015 UTC,"This sub loves anecdotal evidence, so no problem."
boxoffice,34p08k,DaveFincher,3,Sun May 3 07:35:14 2015 UTC,Exactly how I'd describe it. The reviews aren't wrong but it's still a good movie.
boxoffice,34p08k,Elementium,11,Sun May 3 12:31:45 2015 UTC,"Why is word of mouth bad? Apart from critics, I haven't met anyone who disliked the film. Most seem to like it more than the first film, even."
boxoffice,34p08k,WaterStoryMark,7,Sun May 3 11:52:43 2015 UTC,Yeah but where are the really enthusiastic people telling me how hella fuckin epic it is and that I HAVE to go see it.
boxoffice,34p08k,Janitor3333,-4,Sun May 3 12:21:44 2015 UTC,"They're on my Facebook news feed. Everyone is loving it. Except, like I said, critics. I am friends with a few professional critics and all but one of them hated the film, entirely."
boxoffice,34p08k,WaterStoryMark,7,Sun May 3 12:41:48 2015 UTC,"I went with a group of about 8 people. These guys are huge MCU fans. The general consensus from my group was the first and last 30 minutes were great, but the middle had a lot of problems."
boxoffice,34p08k,Snark88,2,Sun May 3 12:55:20 2015 UTC,So just like the first one
boxoffice,34p08k,OfficerTwix,2,Sun May 3 15:50:14 2015 UTC,Interesting. I can see where people would have problems with the slower scenes.
boxoffice,34p08k,WaterStoryMark,2,Sun May 3 13:10:36 2015 UTC,"Havent seen it, but friends who have generally said ""really good, but not as good as the first"". Which i guess isnt bad word of mouth, but im not the biggest MCU fan so i dont know if i'll see it or wait till its on blu-ray."
boxoffice,34p08k,FartingBob,9,Sun May 3 16:41:00 2015 UTC,And people actually believed this was going to do 300m+ OW.
boxoffice,34p08k,DaveFincher,7,Sun May 3 07:36:23 2015 UTC,This has been quite the ride.  I've been glued to these updates all day yesterday and today.  I was thinking 190-200 up until about 5 days ago when I drank the cool-aid and my expectations went through the roof.  Oh well.
boxoffice,34p08k,Mojammer,5,Sun May 3 05:53:50 2015 UTC,My prediction was 185. If this was price is right everyone would have overbid on that toaster oven.

boxoffice,34p08k,DaveFincher,9,Sun May 3 08:23:53 2015 UTC,"It's certainly lower than expectations, both personal and professional. Most of the big Analytic services were tracking for 200-220m."
boxoffice,34p08k,PrettyFkinFarFromOK,2,Sun May 3 08:27:52 2015 UTC,"I think it fits it well, if not around $5 million less.  The first movie was a huge event because it was the first crossover film on such a scale. This is just a sequel, however good it has lost the ""OMG THEY'RE TEAMING UP"" excitement the first movie had.  This movie was always tracking for $195 million even with the sequel frenzy, and some of it got knocked out (no pun intended) due to the Mayweather-Pacquiao match."
boxoffice,34p08k,Citizensssnips,0,Sun May 3 20:03:54 2015 UTC,"Lol, bad?. 190m would still put it as the #3 biggest weekend of all time."
