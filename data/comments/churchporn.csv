I wonder how well it is holding up over the years with cliff erosion and such. I recall an engineer friend of mine working on a project on a cliff and they had to design in such a manner that allowed for 2 cm of erosion a year."

One has to have an authorization from the office he founded and used to own. I guess that really slows things down and it's a pity really, because many of those buildings are in need of some fixing up... Nonetheless, this Cathedral is still a great piece of art!"
