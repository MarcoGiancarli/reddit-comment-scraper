facepalm,3e2dh9,mrOsteel,15,Tue Jul 21 14:49:51 2015 UTC,What's that?
facepalm,3e2dh9,ahurlly,5,Tue Jul 21 15:31:25 2015 UTC,"/u/drifton explained it in a nutshell. You can also learn more at /r/puppy101 !  Littermate syndrome is where you adopt two pets from the same litter (and some times two from separate litters but similar enough in age and before either's bonded with you) that have bonded with each other before they have a chance to bond with you.  This creates an issue of co-dependency where neither animal will do anything without the other. Sounds adorable, right? Not when neither dog will listen to you because ""Well my brother's not doing it, so why should I?"" ""Oh... but my brother does it this way."" ""I'm not gonna do this if my brother's not here doing it with me!"" They basically break down into a ball of anxiety and depression when separated from their littermate and won't listen to you when they're together.  Littermate syndrome requires double duty to fight and build independence in each animal. You have to feed them at separate times, have them sleep in separate beds (preferably separate rooms), walk them both separately, train them separately - including two separate sets of obedience/socialization classes on separate days of the week and take them to the vet separately.   All in all, it's double the work, double the cost, yet triple the frustration. If you want a playmate for your fur kid, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, get another one after you've had the first for at least 6 months.   EDIT: Grammar."
facepalm,3e2dh9,Fizzbit,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:46 2015 UTC,Thanks this is really good to know. I'm about 2 years away from being in a place where I can get a dog but I always planned on getting two because I was afraid of them being lonely. I'll be sure to wait a year in between.
facepalm,3e2dh9,ahurlly,8,Tue Jul 21 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Depending on a bunch of different factors, a buddy isn't a bad thing at all, but it's critical that your first dog be bonded with you before you even think about introducing a new pet.   Dogs will bond quickly with each other (with some exceptions) so the best way to think of it is, if you've got a dog that's already attached to you, you've got a ""doggy wing man"" - to tell the new guy ""Hey kid, listen, yeah you're cool and I know you're new here and scared and wanna follow me around, but check it out, this dude here? The furless one that stands on two legs? He's AWESOME, lemme tell ya! He'll feed you, give you treats, go running with you - even play fetch! Here, let me show you the ropes.""  9/10 a new dog will learn mannerisms and bond with you based on observing the first dog, and the old dog may even learn some new tricks and behaviors from watching the new guy get the hang of things. Just be careful they don't teach each other the bad manners!"
facepalm,3e2dh9,Fizzbit,18,Tue Jul 21 16:58:47 2015 UTC,Thanks I plan on reading up a lot on training methods before I get a dog because I was 3 when I got my last one and I wasn't exactly involved in her training.
facepalm,3e2dh9,ahurlly,11,Tue Jul 21 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"For sure! Whether you decide to adopt from a shelter or rescue or buy from a responsible breeder, some good resources here on reddit are /r/dogs, /r/dogtraining, and for the basic stuff, the sidebar at /r/puppy101. There's also plenty of breed-specific subreddits in case you have questions about behaviors that are unique to certain breeds (i.e. herding and heel-nipping in corgis and aussies, excessive mouthiness in labs, loose-leash walking for any working breed, etc), or if you want to get a certain breed, those specific subreddits will have resources available for you to help find reputable breeders and good shelters/rescues.  The key thing to remember is regardless of the age that you get your dog at, one of the first things you should do is enroll in obedience class! Socialization is the key to a well-rounded and behaved animal, and it's a very powerful bonding experience as well.   Best of luck!!"

The thing is though, the alien controlling the guy is actually making him tell the truth, but it does it in a way that seems crazy (the hand gesture and face that he's so famous for) and the fact that the alien knows it looks like a crazy-person hairstyle just helps it's agenda."

facepalm,3dy7ur,samx3i,85,Mon Jul 20 22:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's worded strangely too.  $394 million wasn't the cost to ""introduce"" Obamacare; it was the cost of the website.  Actual costs of overhead are much, much higher, as in $279 billion.   There are approximately 321.3 million American citizens, so you could instead give $644.25 to each citizen.  I think most people would probably rather have the insurance than the $644.25, but that's purely speculation on part. I can't prove that.  EDIT: Looks like the actual costs of the website were significantly higher: Office of Inspector General released a report finding that the total cost of the HealthCare.gov website had reached $1.7 billion.  Source"
facepalm,3dy7ur,Blubalz,12,Mon Jul 20 20:55:18 2015 UTC,"Well...321.3 million citizens aren't enrolled through the Healthcare exchange.  If you were to only calculate the people who didn't have insurance and only those who picked up insurance through the Healthcare Exchange...then that number could be used to calculate how much $279 billion would've been for each of those people affected.  I'm not sure of the total number, but I don't believe it's even topped 20 million.  So...just doing a quick search it looks as though roughly 17 million are enrolled under the ACA.  Now you're looking at $16,400 per person who potentially wouldn't have had insurance coverage before the ACA.  I think the number of people who would rather have $16,400 is probably a pretty significant number.  That's purely speculation on my part as well."

facepalm,3dy7ur,Blubalz,2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:50 2015 UTC,"The average subsidy was in the ballpark of $200 monthly.  For each individual that purchased insurance through the ACA, this was the average.  This number is still under debate, so I'm just going to use it as a hypothetical and potential example.  Numbers and subsidy levels also vary state-by-state.  Here is an example of where some of these numbers come from.  The average yearly subsidy per individual is $2890.  Let's forget about the $16,400 ""implementation cost"" per person, and just look at the roughly $200/month that is now being spent per person for the duration.  I think the argument of, ""Hey, would you like an extra $200 in your pocket every month forever?!?"" would be much more enticing than $20/month...and it's not a stretch to justify these numbers."
facepalm,3dy7ur,samx3i,3,Tue Jul 21 12:22:16 2015 UTC,"I think the number of people who would rather have $16,400 is probably a pretty significant number.   All good points, and you're probably right. Of course, having insurance could very easily save some people $16,400 or more in any given year. Anyone is one health or injury catastrophe from massive hospital bills. Something like this is incredibly difficult to measure in terms of real value."
facepalm,3dy7ur,Blubalz,3,Tue Jul 21 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"That's true, but the amount of money we're talking about is absolutely ludicrous.  You're looking at roughly 17 million people now who have picked up plans that are in some way/shape/form subsidized by the government and other insurance holders.  So this billion dollar bill we're talking about isn't a one-time fee.  These people are going to have subsidized insurance for the duration, and the bill will be footed by the government.  I agree something needs to be done about healthcare, I work in healthcare myself, owning a physical therapy clinic.  There are hospitals charging $12 for every single little paper cup they bring your pills to you in.  There are pharmaceutical companies charging an arm and a leg for drugs and treatments that cost next to nothing in other countries.  The US is one of 2 countries in the entire world where it is LEGAL for pharmaceutical companies to direct market to the consumer.  (New Zealand is the only other one.)  Lobbyists in Washington and consequently Big Pharma, large hospital systems, and Insurance companies control the healthcare marketplace in our country.  I don't know a single person that has come through our door who had insurance previously that has had their premiums go down with the ACA.  Every single person I've spoken with, which is everyone that comes through our door, has seen their insurance premiums rise OR had benefits drastically reduced and deductibles greatly increased.  Until we remove special interests from Washington, and shut down the lobbyists, I don't think we're really going to see a change in the healthcare world, and the tax burden to fund the ACA doesn't look promising."

facepalm,3dy7ur,samx3i,5,Tue Jul 21 02:16:02 2015 UTC,"Great question.   That's the total cost for the entire project, which includes setting up the physical and technical infrastructure for the entire exchange, as well as every state's exchange (those that chose to implement them, anyway). It also includes staffing for all the people who did that work, as well as all the lawyers/business people/bureaucrats who made the whole project work.  It wasn't so much a $634m website; it was a $634m system.  /u/EngineeredMadness talks about a lot of the bureaucratic and technical backend reasons that make this project expensive by it's very nature: http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwhsmv  /u/avacar points out that the $634m price tag is a grand total over several contracts that were signed to the company that did the work. There was a whole lot of prep work that took years to go through in order to even be able to begin building a system this complex, and it took a lot of people a lot of time to do it. Couple this with EngineeredMadness's points and you've got a pretty good idea of what happened.  http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwgh1k  Again, I'm not defending the site, or the cost. It's a government contract, it almost undoubtedly had more bloat to it than it needed to. But if you really look at all the in's and out's of what it would take to build a system this complex, you can at least comprehend the reasoning behind why the numbers got so large, and can hopefully appreciate why keeping the site both functional, responsive, and stable is a momentous undertaking.

Both my dad and I are on Fetlife (Facebook for people into talking about non-vanilla sex) and talk about sex quite a bit. We talk about our fetishes and even plan on going to site events together (I'm new to the site so I've never been to one before). It's not weird at all because it's appropriate with our relationship. In fact, other than my best friend, my dad was the first person I talked to after messing around with my first girlfriend. He talks about all the shit that him and his girlfriend are into - my parents are separated - and it doesn't bother me at all.  My mom on the other hand; half the time she doesn't know whether or not I have a SO, and doesn't really question or talk about anything to do with sex. Which is good, because I'm simply not comfortable with talking about stuff like that with her. My dad talked to me about sex basically since I was 14, but my mom pretended sex was something that only happened to married couples."

Or sex in general. That's pretty cool though, must be nice to have a mentor you can completely trust."

So when he finally forms a real romantic relationship with a woman, one he happens to not have really chased after because it wasn't his usual type, he didn't need to fulfill those romantic feelings with porn. I don't think the point was to say he quit porn forever, just that it's purpose and need had changed now that he found what he needed elsewhere. If he was to find a woman with the same problem as him they would have had a terrible relationship, just because two people share the same problems does not mean they are meant together."

There are plenty of guys out there that let porn get in the way of a healthy sexual relationship with their significant other. That is the other side that I think /u/Dancecomander was trying to explain. It can be a problem for some guys out there and they do need counseling to work on these unhealthy releases that neglects their partners needs.   It's cool in most cases. I watch porn, but my fiance and I also have a healthy sex life when we have a moment and are both in the mood. That's just not how it works it all instances.

I'm going to be upfront with you; what little information on the subject you have provided thus far very much suggests to be that you two had problems well beyond pornography.  Regardless, you need to come to terms with the fact that people cannot force themselves to experience sexual desire. It really is as simple as that, and pornography has nothing to do with it."
facepalm,3dslqj,Dancecomander,7,Sun Jul 19 09:04:35 2015 UTC,"The fact that he's lying could also be due to her not being okay with it in any way. If people are not okay with the truth, can you really blame those that lie to them?"
facepalm,3dslqj,BrerChicken,26,Sun Jul 19 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"Yes?  If your significant other doesn't like you doing something, find a new one. That's the same bullshit logic cheaters use. ""They'd be too upset if I told them the truth, so I'll lie"".  Doesn't matter whether she's ""right"" or ""wrong"" about whatever her stance on porn may be. If something is that important to you that you feel you're better off lying than telling your s/o the truth (in a situation like this), then you need to find someone else. Because lies like this will ALWAYS come out."

She was just not the kind of person I could be honest with which caused me a lot of pain growing up.   But honestly, you can't just go out and find a new significant other when you find one flaw. And they're are many, many things you will do that they don't like. You can't just expect them to like it, though you can expect them to deal with it without hyperventilating. But it's absolutely understandable if they can't deal, and you choose to tell a white lie to appease. Maybe it's not the most ethical course of action, but it's definitely understandable."

Or since I don't like it when he sucks on his teeth when he has something stuck in them instead of getting floss, he should dump me and find a new girl?   I implore you to take porn out of this particular strain of comments you and /u/BrerChicken are having.   So replacing porn with something else completely, would you still use that sentence and hold true to the belief that you seem to be implying here?   Find one single flaw in your SO? Oh, time to kick them to the curb and find a new one! I don't get that logic."

facepalm,3dslqj,ykks,4,Sun Jul 19 12:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say you nailed it.

A ""real"" IQ test can't be found online because, much like the ""real"" Rorschach cards, viewing the test/cards beforehand would not only make it easy to cheat but also bias any results (making them worthless, even a single person who cheats can offset the scales by which it is measured in comparison to others).

The person on Facebook did not say she was in the 56th percentile, which would mean she is above 56% of people, or slightly above average. She said she was in the top 56%. When measuring numbers in that way, you want to be in the small number. The TOP 1% is always better than the top 10%, for example."
facepalm,3drslb,railroadbaron,3,Sun Jul 19 04:55:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah she never said percentile though. She said top 56%, meaning that 56% of people scored to the same level or higher than her, and 44% scored to the same level/lower. There are more people smarter than her than there are people dumber than her (if you count a Facebook IQ test a valid scale of how smart you are lol.) Top 56% is same as bottom 44%, which is bad. You want your top percentage to be a smaller group than your bottom percentage.  It also says in the says in the same picture that she had a score of 96.8, with the average being 100.

Did those sell well too? If yes, then mass market paperback third.   If the book doesn't sell enough copies, then you will only have hardbacks available. And, for mass market paperbacks, even if a non-fiction book sold really well as a trade pb, it's still pretty unlikely that they'll make a mass market pb. Mass markets are usually only for fiction.  edit: a word"

Trade paperbacks are typically between $8.99 to $12.99. Mass market paperbacks are usually between $3.99 to $6.99. The profit margins decrease when the selling price per unit is a smaller amount. Even though it's more expensive to print a hardback, the selling price more than makes up for it."

facepalm,3dqhrd,LeCrushinator,6,Sat Jul 18 19:41:38 2015 UTC,"That's actually only true up to a point. Once you start looking at people with Masters and PhD degrees, you start seeing a trend to more religiosity. With all of these studies, there are snippets of data to justify any position on the topic of religiosity. It's important to look at the whole picture and not just focus on one aspect of the results.   The most recent Gallup Poll on this topic (from 2015) shows that while the most religious people tend to have attained lower education levels, religious people in general are the majority in all levels of education."
facepalm,3dqhrd,librarymania,3,Sun Jul 19 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"Can you provide a source for your first couple of sentences? I can't find any studies showing an increased number of religious people at higher levels of education. All I've ever heard or read is that the numbers drop the higher the education level.   The most recent Gallup Poll...   Are you referring to this? It does state that they are the majority at all levels of education, but it doesn't show the actual numbers. It makes sense that the majority are religious at every level, since the majority of people are religious. The survey doesn't say anything about how much of a majority the religious maintain as the education level increases."
facepalm,3dqhrd,SydeshowJake,3,Sun Jul 19 05:52:09 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of studies on this topic. Here are some that I obtained from the EBSCOHost database Religion and Philosophy. As you will see, it is a complex subject, and there are no easy one-to-one correlations. There are many more studies than the three I've mentioned here.  McFarland, M. J., Wright, B. E., & Weakliem, D. L. (2011). Educational Attainment and Religiosity: Exploring Variations by Religious Tradition. Sociology Of Religion, 72(2), 166-188.  Abstract: ""This study examines the relationship between educational attainment and various dimensions of religiosity. On the basis of a network closure argument, we hypothesize that the relationship between education and religiosity varies by religious tradition. Analyzing data from the 1972–2006 General Social Survey, we found that educational attainment predicted increased attendance at religious services, decreased levels of prayer, increased inclination to view the Bible as a book of fables, and decreased inclination to view the Bible as the literal word of God. These relationships, however, significantly interacted with religious tradition. Increased education largely resulted in greater religiosity among evangelical Protestants, black Protestants, and Catholics but not among mainline Protestants and the nonaffiliated. Overall, this study shows that education does not uniformly decrease religiosity and highlights the importance of considering religious tradition in future research.""  Reimer, S. (2010). Higher Education and Theological Liberalism: Revisiting the Old Issue*. Sociology Of Religion, 71(4), 393-408.  Abstract: ""It has long been assumed that higher education has a corrosive effect on religious belief and practice. Contrary to research from the 1970s and 80s, however, recent studies show that the college experience has little effect on the religiosity of college students. In this paper, I reconcile these opposing viewpoints by showing that higher education has a liberalizing effect, but only for a minority of students. A sample of church-going Protestants demonstrates that those with higher education are more theologically liberal, but the type of education matters more than the amount of higher education. Exposure to secular theories and whether one attends secular or religious schools have robust effects on theological liberalism.""  Uecker, J. E., Regnerus, M. D., & Vaaler, M. L. (2007). Losing My Religion: The Social Sources of Religious Decline in Early Adulthood. Social Forces, 85(4), 1667-1692.  Abstract: ""Many Americans exhibit declining religiosity during early adulthood. There is no consensus about why this occurs, though longstanding assumptions suggest the secularizing effects of higher education, normative deviance and life course factors. We evaluate these effects on decreasing frequency of religious practice, diminished importance of religion and disaffiliation from religion altogether. Results from analyses of the Add Health study indicate that only religious participation suffers substantial declines in young adulthood. Contrary to expectations, emerging adults that avoid college exhibit the most extensive patterns of religious decline, undermining conventional wisdom about the secularizing effect of higher education. Marriage curbs religious decline, while cohabitation, nonmarital sex, drugs and alcohol use each accelerate diminished religiosity -- especially religious participation -- during early adulthood.""  The Gallup Poll link you provided is the correct one. Aside from the percentages in the beginning of the article, if you scroll further down you will see data in the methodology and sample size sections. Gallup Polls aren't as detailed in their reports as a peer-reviewed article.  edit: Just wanted to add that I have no dog in this fight. I'm areligious. Not atheist, not agnostic, not religious.

They may still be forced to go to church/mosque/etc. with family even though they don't believe, or have to keep up a ruse that they are still believers so their family won't disown them.   Kind of gives a little perspective on it. Not saying it's right, but when I stopped believing and saw what I perceive to be ridiculous lies (Humans originating from two people, a man getting eaten by a whale yet surviving, Jesus himself resurrecting/etc.) I wasn't just angry at the religion, I was angry at myself for eating it up for so long."

Where as an atheist, while I would rarely if ever actually say anything out loud to someone religious, it quite literally does come off the same to me as if a 35 year old person said they unironically and seriously still believed in Santa Claus. Same goes for homeopathy or any of that nonsense. It's as equally ridiculous to me.

Plus, new research can always overturn even the most respected nonfiction, while on the other hand people often hold the Bible as constant and use it to overturn new research.

I then took a shower in the clean water provided by the municipal water utility. Then, I brushed my teeth with that water, filtered to standards set by the EPA and my state. After that, I turned on the TV to one of the FCC regulated channels to see what the National Weather Service of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration determined the weather was going to be like using satellites designed, built, and launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I watched this while eating my breakfast of US Department of Agriculture inspected food and taking the drugs which have been determined as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. At the appropriate time as regulated by the US Congress and kept accurate by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the US Naval Observatory, I get into my National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved automobile and set out to work on the roads built by the local, state, and federal Departments of Transportation, possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality level determined by the Environmental Protection Agency, using legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve Bank and printed by the Federal Bureau of Engraving and Printing. On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the US Postal Service and drop the kids off at the public school. I park my car on the street, paved and maintained by the Department of Transportation, and put quarters issued by the United States Mint into the parking meter. Then, after spending another day not being maimed or killed at work thanks to the workplace regulations imposed by the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, I drive back to my house which has not burned down in my absence because of the state and local building codes and the fire marshal's inspection, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables thanks to the local police department. I then log onto the Internet which was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration and post on freerepublic and fox news forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine is BAD because the government can't do anything right.

We both were operating under the assumption that he was bi. Late last year we decided to try swinging since neither of us really had a chance to experiment like most people do in their late teens and early 20s.   It started out fine, meeting bi couples and everyone having sex with everyone else. Then the problems started. He couldn't keep it up for the woman in the other couple, only me and the guy. Then he started losing it with me, and eventually got to the point where he couldn't get it up for me at all. We tried several times and then he broke down and said that it just did nothing for him anymore, and he was gay.   Since there were steadily increasing problems, I kind of had my suspicions. With that being the case, it didn't come as a huge surprise to me. It obviously wasn't easy to hear, and I definitely mourned what I was losing, but I was able to accept it as something that is an integral part of who he is.   I'm very lucky that we are able to remain best friends, and that we got two pretty awesome kids out of the deal."

If you really want to get some perspective, ask bi guys whether they were born that way or not.  I think that most would probably say that they don't really know.  Many that I've met have a strong attraction to women but ""choose"" to mess around with guys.  Now I'd say that for strictly gay men, most would absolutely say that they were born that way and many were attracted to men at a very young age.  However, knowing that at least with bi men, that there is quite a bit of conscious choice going on... it's difficult to really say with any definitive conviction that sexuality is an inherent genetic trait.  I suspect that it's a mix of both.  Some people are probably very much genetically ""wired"" to only find the same sex attractive.  However, there's evidence that a lot of gay women end up choosing to be lesbians later in life... or a lot of women and men choosing to have gay relationships while in prison for example.  Very complex issue."

I've primarily dated women and am engaged to one, but it's not because I'm more attracted to women.  Out of the people I've met who are attracted to men, I've gotten along with more women.

Keep in mind that until very recent times gay people married the opposite sex and had children because they could have been killed for homosexuality, so say there is a gay gene (probably a bit more complicated but this is for arguments sake), it would get passed down and be recessive in some people. We also know that being gay is not a choice, meaning that either a mutation happened to make the child attracted to the same sex, or that trait has been passed down."

facepalm,3dmhj8,MrSriracha,533,Fri Jul 17 15:05:58 2015 UTC,lots of trans people care because it's one of the first publically accepted trans people. they finally are starting to have role models.  plus the general populous saw that this is something that actually happens and some of them might have accepted trans people because of it.
facepalm,3dmhj8,vivaenmiriana,276,Fri Jul 17 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"I admit I was one of the people who didn't accept Caitlyn. After the Espy's my opinion changed. Her message resonated with me and I realized that it wasn't right of me to judge people because I didn't understand them.  I might not like it, but I have learned to come and accept it. I think the trans community has Caitlyn to thank for that. I also think it was hugely courageous of her to put herself out there and face the ridicule and condemnation from so many people.   It opened my eyes to what a trans persons life must be like. After the Espy's I see no reason to try to make there lives any worse. We are all people and we differ in many different ways. We should respect each other regardless and I think I didn't respect the trans community prior to that speech. I'm sorry for that, but I do now and I hope many others do now as well."
facepalm,3dmhj8,oldie101,133,Fri Jul 17 18:19:29 2015 UTC,It's big of you to (semi) publicly admit that. A lot of people refuse to change their opinion because that means they were wrong. Good on you.
facepalm,3dmhj8,CraptainHammer,48,Fri Jul 17 19:19:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that.   A couple of quotes that resonate with me:  ""No one should be ashamed to admit they are wrong, which is but saying, in other words, that they are wiser today than they were yesterday."" Alexander Pope  ""Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them."" Bruce Lee  ""A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them."" John Maxwell  ""The man with insight enough to admit his limitations comes nearest to perfection."" Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  ""We shall act with good intentions, but at times we will be wrong. When we are, let us admit it and try to right the situation."" Joe Paterno  ""Unlike some politicians, I can admit to a mistake.""

Nobody's perfect, and genuine ignorance is one of the biggest obstacles the transgender community faces. I'm glad that in your previous opinion of transgender people, you didn't willfully isolate yourself from learning something new."
facepalm,3dmhj8,Droidball,38,Sat Jul 18 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"I'm truly sorry if I'm wrong, but isn't the point not to care?  Bruce: My name is Caytlin now, and I'm also now a girl.  Me: Cool. So, how was dinner last night Caytlin?  Right? Just treat her like a girl now, (using she instead of he, etc,) and call her by her new name. Just like if my friend changed his email, I would keep using the old address. I'd just say, ""thanks for the heads up"", and change my ways accordingly.

facepalm,3dmhj8,DigiDuncan,26,Sat Jul 18 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"Well, the point is to care that there are still a lot of transphobic people in our society. Ideally, nobody would freak out over your gender. Unfortunately, we don't live in that world."
facepalm,3dmhj8,turkey_berzerky,4,Sat Jul 18 01:48:23 2015 UTC,"The reason that it's good that people are paying attention, is that she is the first celebrity of her stature that has come out as transgender, and transitioned while in the public eye. This has provided an incredible platform to spread awareness of trans issues and the trans community, as well as just making people realize that transgender people DO exist.  And I'm not sure if you'd try to correct me with Laverne Cox, or Janet Mock, or Chaz Bono, or another transgender celebrity - none of them have anywhere near the visibility of Caitlyn Jenner, both by virtue of who she is, as well as her proximity to the Kardashian family.  She, and the trans community, are able to use that visibility as a springboard into the public eye, to educate people and motivate a positive change for trans people everywhere."
facepalm,3dmhj8,Droidball,3,Sat Jul 18 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"The point is, not many people are treating her like that. It's been 90% negative. But any time a courageous individual finally takes a stand for others, the ripple is generally too much for the masses to handle."

facepalm,3dmhj8,professor_murder,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"The individual should be treated like that, yes. However, there needs to be a spokesperson for the issue who represents everyone, and who should be discussed and recognized, because of the heavy stigma and legal issues transgender folks face. We can't fix these problems by not talking about them."

facepalm,3dmhj8,BooYeah0484,26,Fri Jul 17 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think someone who texts and drives (...)   She wasn't texting.   In February 2015, Jenner was involved in a multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. The accident caused one death and eight injuries, but Jenner was able to walk away from the accident. The stepchildren of the deceased filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jenner in relation to the incident. In July 2015, Los Angeles investigators determined that while Jenner was inattentive, ""she was not intoxicated or texting"" before the crash, and would not face felony charges."
facepalm,3dmhj8,ShyBiDude89,140,Fri Jul 17 19:55:47 2015 UTC,"This may come as a newsflash to you, but not everyone who was party to an action that has an end result of someone dying meets the elements for severe, felonious, jail-time criminal behavior.  Unintentionally causing the death of someone when operating a motor vehicle is a misdemeanor in most states, and is rarely punished with anything more than a suspended license and perhaps a fine if the offender has a clean driving and criminal record - as Jenner does. Aside from that, Jenner was proven by an analysis of her phone and phone records to not have been texting at the time of the crash.  She's not being charged because she did nothing wrong other than perhaps following too closely and not reacting fast enough.  She's not not being charged because she's famous and rich, anyone else in the same situation would likely not be charged, as well, or would be being charged with a misdemeanor that would have effectively no repercussions for that person other than a court date and the charge being on their record."

Nothing about this situation seems genuine. It's feels like a marketing stunt wrapped in something that (s)he actually wanted to do. I may be biased because I hate all things Kardashians, but the moment I found out he was involved with them (even by proxy), it all made sense.  You have people like Lana Wachowski who's transformation isn't some huge gimmick, why can't we look at them?    EDIT: I know she didn't fake the transition. I just feel like the amount of ruckus surrounding it is... well marketing. It seems like such an intimate surgery to just throw onto national news stands in the way it was. Prolly just me."

facepalm,3dmhj8,Mmffgg,6,Fri Jul 17 14:46:59 2015 UTC,I recall seeing a survey which showed something like 40-50% of Americans wouldn't vote for a presidential candidate because he wasn't a Christian.  ¯\(°_o)/¯
facepalm,3dmhj8,I8_un_taco,26,Fri Jul 17 20:08:10 2015 UTC,Anyone can be discriminated against. It's just some groups tend to be discriminated more.
facepalm,3dmhj8,kiss-tits,11,Fri Jul 17 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"Well, after the gay marriage ruling, Alabama did halt all marriage licenses: http://www.newsweek.com/avoid-supreme-court-gay-marriage-decision-alabama-temporarily-bans-gay-348366  So they are discriminated against! Alabama banned the straights!   /s"
facepalm,3dmhj8,mommy2libras,2,Fri Jul 17 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, it goes much further than that. I'm from Mobile. Back in January, some counties started giving licenses to everyone because the ban was considered unconstitutional. Mobile decided they wouldn't. So they got handed an order from a federal judge that yes, they had to allow same sex couples to get marriage licenses. So they decided not to give them to anyone. This was back in February, right before Valentines day. And it's been closed up until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure if it still closed or not. But I do know that a probate judge spent over 200k of taxpayer's money on lawyers because there were suits against him for not following the order of the district court judge.  That SOB should be burned at the stake. Mr Don Im-a-total-shithead Davis."
facepalm,3dmhj8,junkman105,9,Fri Jul 17 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"It's not that straight people are being discriminated against, i think what people see is that if you are white, and or straight it is a bad idea to make it public that you are proud of that fact.   Straight guy wants straight pride parade, everyone says he's a homophobe.  White guy is proud to be white...this makes him a racist in the eyes of the media.  I totally agree with Lilrev16.  It's sad that both of these people are getting all of this media attention."
facepalm,3dmhj8,Khers,22,Fri Jul 17 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with you, I get national pride but often find racial pride to be stupid. The only place I can understand racial pride is if they're a discriminated minority and it's an act of defiance (blacks in America, whites in Africa, Chinese in Japan and so forth).  And there's nothing to be proud of if you're straight so it's a stupid thing to be proud of. Gay pride is a thing because they've been shamed and put down. No one's ever 'straight bashed' outside of fanatic tumblerites."
facepalm,3dmhj8,TehFrozenYogurt,2,Fri Jul 17 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"As a straight person, everyday is a straight 'pride' parade. It's the simple fact that my life isn't upsidedown and that I fit into society easily.  Also, being proud that you're white in a white dominant country such as the US is like being proud that you're privileged. Say a teacher gives three cookies to one kid, and only one cookie to another. The one cookie kid might say, hey, I only have one cookie but I'm proud of that fact and will work with what I got. The three cookie kid can't say that or else he'd look like a major dick."
facepalm,3dmhj8,webby686,40,Sat Jul 18 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"A few differences:   1) 83% of Americans identify as Christian. Christians are in the majority and have plenty of influence. Trans people have been a marginalized group for decades and, today, are still victims of violence and discrimination in jobs, healthcare, housing, etc. Has anyone in the last century been murdered for being Christian? Kicked out of their home by their parents for being Christian?   2) Your religion is a choice. Being trans is a biological condition: gender dysphoria."
facepalm,3dmhj8,BigRedOG,9,Fri Jul 17 16:22:24 2015 UTC,It's actually roughly 71%  http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/

The point still stands that it's a very common demographic that faces relatively small persecution. And usually radical Islamists don't specifically target Christians so much as anyone who isn't Muslim or anyone who is part of the western world.  But I do agree that ""last century"" is kind of a large timescale. Christians were definitely persecuted to some extent over that time."

facepalm,3dmhj8,Neebay,31,Fri Jul 17 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"Not really. Most people seem to be supportive of Jenner, but you'd have to be blind not to see how heavily people have attacked her for her transgenderism.  There's also the fact that most NFL players (and Americans in general) are Christians, but don't get crap for it like Tebow does. I'd guess that it's because Tebow's faith is probably the most prominent part of his public image, so when people want to attack Tebow, they go for that. I don't think most Tebow haters hate him because he's Christian, they just hate him as an athlete."
facepalm,3dmhj8,Droidball,17,Fri Jul 17 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've sincerely never seen someone attacking Tebow, or his faith, any more than the odd blogger, 4channer, redditor, or other online commentor. Never something published through legitimate news or media outlets.  Maybe I've just missed it, but every time someone hoists Tim Tebow up as a martyr for their victim complex, it seems like they just made up the criticism themselves, or are seizing on that one tiny voice in the crowd that is criticizing him to go, ""HELP, HELP, I'M BEING REPRESSED! Did you see him repressing me? you saw it, didn't you?  EDIT: I accidentally a letter"
facepalm,3dmhj8,guyincognitoo,15,Fri Jul 17 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"Most people who objected to Tebow weren't attacking him, just objecting to the constant religious references.  Kurt Warner, who is just as religious as Tebow, has suggested that he should tone it down a bit.  ""You can't help but cheer for a guy like that,"" former NFL star Kurt Warner said. ""But I'd tell him, 'Put down the boldness in regards to the words, and keep living the way you're living. Let your teammates do the talking for you. Let them cheer on your testimony.' ""I know what he's going through, and I know what he wants to accomplish, but I don't want anybody to become calloused toward Tim because they don't understand him, or are not fully aware of who he is. And you're starting to see that a little bit."""
facepalm,3dmhj8,Droidball,17,Fri Jul 17 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"That sounds like, ""Tim's a great guy, and it's awesome that his faith is as important to him as it is...But he's also a great guy, and needs to show people that, instead of showing something that makes people think that his faith is all that he is.""  Which doesn't at all sound unreasonable. I've got friends who are veterans or still actively serving, and their military service is the only thing they ever talk about to other people - it makes them look like tools, which sucks because most of them are really awesome people. I've got gay friends who do it, too, with regards to their homosexuality.   It's frustrating, especially when you know that X person is very cool and interesting, once they stop making every conversation about Y defining feature of their life.  EDIT: And even still, that doesn't sound like, ""Shut up about Jesus! Nobody likes a Christian, you stupid fuck! Go do your God-talk somewhere else, you shithead!"", which is what everyone who uses him as a poster-child for their victim complex makes it seem like."

It's another case of Christians building a strawman just to feel good about themselves.  I do, however, think it's stupid how Tim Tebow gets so much back lash mostly for being of the faith, while Caitlyn gets so much recognition just for wanting to be a woman.  I understand it's because trans people now have a role model, but why should I care? And why give her an award? It strikes me as weird."
facepalm,3dmhj8,Bendrake,67,Fri Jul 17 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"You are very correct, trans people are persecuted so much worse.  I've seen people openly mock trans people in public the moment it's apparent that they are trans - that's pretty bad.  I've never seen someone openly mock a Christian the moment it's found out that they are Christian.  I don't know why it has to be Christian vs trans, maybe because Christians are some of the worst offenders in regards to persecuting trans people.

facepalm,3dmhj8,Sports-Nerd,2,Fri Jul 17 20:11:09 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of Tim Tebow's success, outside of college, was because of how vocal he was about his religion.

Hell I think is very vocal about his faith RG3, but no one ever cites that as a reason he isn't having success."
facepalm,3dmhj8,bamberjean,3,Sat Jul 18 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yea mocking is one thing, but transpeople (especially transwomen of color) are more than openly mocked.

facepalm,3dmhj8,yndihalda1,3,Sat Jul 18 00:59:07 2015 UTC,It's honestly just good that you are not in that group anymore. There are so many pastors that still do that because it's somewhat acceptable. You don't have to endorse that kind of lifestyle but it's important that you don't go out of your way to persecute and alienate. Makes the whole religion look bad.
facepalm,3dmhj8,nschirmer,9,Fri Jul 17 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"I do, however, think it's stupid how Tim Tebow gets so much back lash mostly for being of the faith   It wasn't entirely just because of him being of the faith. Tim made an awkward show of his praying before each game. For one, prayer is something that's meant to be private between you and your God, not a public spectacle to get you fans and media attention... not to mention praying to win a football game is a very bizarre thing. I can also see people saying the same thing about Caitlyn and making her transition a public spectacle, though.  But I don't personally care all that much. I'm not even a football fan so I was never on either side of the Tebow thing."

facepalm,3dmhj8,docsnavely,2,Fri Jul 17 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"This is an example of confirmation bias.  70% of the United States is Christian. I therefore find it difficult to believe that the majority of Americans would say those sorts of things about Tebow. I couldn't find any statistics on how people feel about the transgendered, but trans people do suffer significantly more tangible oppression than cis people, such as double the unemployment and a high rate of sexual victimization. It stands to reason that the majority of people do not feel this way about Jenner or other trans people.  The reason this person believes Christians are being oppressed in some way and trans people are glorified is because they are of a conservative mindset, with sympathy towards Christianity and at least some antipathy towards sexual minorities. It's also common for the majority to see any attempts by a marginalized group to gain acceptance or power as a direct and unjustified assault on the rights of the majority.  Tim Tebow praying before his games is seen as normal and acceptable because Christianity is the majority, but for instance, a Muslim doing the same thing would be seen as having different motives because he is not the majority - perhaps he'd be thought of as a troublemaker attempting to force his religion on others, simply because it's not an ordinary thing. Meanwhile, people who criticize Tebow are seen as rabble-rousers themselves.  Basically what this meme is saying is ""I see people criticize Tim Tebow and I disagree with that. I also see people applaud Bruce Jenner and I disagree with that. Therefore I'm going to attribute both actions with one monolithic group, claim that they're the majority, and cry about how I'm being oppressed."""

facepalm,3dmhj8,romerom,2,Sat Jul 18 00:25:51 2015 UTC,This. So this.
facepalm,3dmhj8,boastfulbadger,3,Sat Jul 18 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"The problem is that ""I'm a Christian"" seems to be followed with some variety of ""respect my right to be a bigot"" a lot of the time."
facepalm,3dmhj8,MountainHigh31,6,Sat Jul 18 03:04:56 2015 UTC,not sure why this is facepalm
facepalm,3dmhj8,fer_d,4,Fri Jul 17 18:06:37 2015 UTC,So we agree that Tebow sucks and Caitlyn is a true athlete?
facepalm,3dmhj8,byrd82,7,Fri Jul 17 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"I posted this to this sub because I thought it was silly Christian propaganda. The girl who liked this image, resulting in it showing up on my feed, is some who is very religious and I'm sure homophobic. I feel like it's saying ""society is oppressing me as a Christian!"" The comments on this forum I feel are all over the place. Did I misinterpret the image? Are you guys agreeing with me or pointing out that this isn't a proper facepalm post?"
facepalm,3dmhj8,Eleine,13,Fri Jul 17 16:52:22 2015 UTC,This is a perfect face palm post. I can't believe some of the comments in this thread. My FB friend posted this too and I groaned to the depths of my soul. Enough already with this fake persecution propaganda! This is also a perfect post for r/forwardsfromgrandma.
facepalm,3dmhj8,SaxyTimeReloaded,2,Fri Jul 17 17:27:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, my grandma would never forward such a thing. She is awesome."
facepalm,3dmhj8,Hobbs54,3,Fri Jul 17 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"When I see these kind of posts, I think that this type of person doesn't actually think being Christian is largely condemned. I think they want as much attention and praise to be placed on being Christian and having 'traditional' values as there is on progressive topics like gay marriage or being transgender. But, the irony is that transgender people would love for their lifestyle to be mainstream enough to be 'ignored'."
facepalm,3dmhj8,tundrawolf,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it's not an expected reaction.  Announcing one is Christian in the US is like declaring grass is green.  Announcing ones transgender identity is a brave act which has, for a very, very long time, garnered enormously hateful, violent, visceral reactions from the general population. When's the last time someone was raped and beaten (or threatened with such) purely on the basis that they were a Christian in America?"
facepalm,3dmhj8,DuckingShot,3,Fri Jul 17 21:42:22 2015 UTC,I actually kind of agree with this
facepalm,3dmhj8,furyextralarge,2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:09 2015 UTC,"For the Tebow thing. I don't care that he is a Christian. He just seems to suck at it. The Bible says to pray in seclusion so the prayer is real, not an attempt to make you look pious. Bibles words, not mine."

facepalm,3dmhj8,cardsagainstmysanity,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me, actually.  And I'm an atheist."
facepalm,3dmhj8,damonteufel,2,Fri Jul 17 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"this comment section sure is full of interesting, thought-provoking discussion"
facepalm,3dmhj8,dead4seven,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"The irony of that ""meme"" is remarkable. Tim Tebow is arguably the most talked about athlete of my generation, even though he barely passed as a third string qb. One thing people constantly talk about is how he is a good Christian boy. If you're going to make a comparison at least know what the fuck you are talking about."
facepalm,3dmhj8,cvoorhees,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"You're not supposed to pray in public or demonstrate your faith publicly as a Christian. It surprises me how many people don't understand their own faith. We do that because the heathens would practice publicly because they wanted to show people how Godly they were. It wasn't about their religion, it was just about demonstrating to people how great they are. So yes, I'd rather praise the celebrity that had to go through this surgery and transitioning while being constantly eyed by the public and constantly judged for it. Transitioning is a viable treatment for dysphoria which no one chose to have. Tebow chose to be Christian and chose to be public with his religion even though the Bible says not to do so unless necessary. One did it for attention, the other did it for mental health reasons."
facepalm,3dmhj8,turkey_berzerky,2,Fri Jul 17 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. Shut up, Tebow."
