Had I paid, I'd be pissed about it. So damn short.  I'm getting sick of them chopping up the game anyway and spreading it across as pre order bonuses. I'm leaning toward just boycotting DLC altogether."

BatmanArkham,3e12t7,Shady_Advice,38,Tue Jul 21 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"I'll say it again, I feel like turning Jason Todd into ""The Arkham Knight"" was just a senseless ploy they used so they could come up with a new ""Arkham _____"" title.  Game should have either been a faithful homage to the Under the Red Hood story or a Scarecrow game. Cramming both these A-list antagonists together to share the spotlight denied both of them the chance to truly shine."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,The5Virtues,29,Tue Jul 21 05:02:41 2015 UTC,"I was severely underwhelmed with who the Arkham Knight was.   I read a theory on here somewhere that went something like this: The Arkham Knight is actually a random nobody that Dr. Strange operated on in the last game, given great abilities similar to Batman through painful experimentation. He is obsessed with killing Batman due to the fact he didn't make it in time, or even knew, who the man was to save him. Also, some mental issues as a result of the torture. There would have also been a scene of Batman finally unmasking the Knight only to go ""Who are you?"" Further enraging him.  I thought that sounded a lot better."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,vamplosion,9,Tue Jul 21 05:36:42 2015 UTC,I felt like a better way to approach the plot in a new way would be to have it like MGS2 - the first section you deal with scarecrow and put an end to his plot but leave Batman affected by the scare-toxin. (effectively ending it where Barbara 'dies').   The second part should be set months later where Batman is struggling with visions of the Joker and have the Arkham Knight appear. All clues should be given that the Knight is Jason Todd as a ploy by Joker to mess with Batman's head. Then BAM - revelation - the Arkham Knight was actually Tim Drake distraught by Barbara's death months prior. Would have been a much nicer twist and would avoid the whole Scarecrow and the Knight stealing eachothers spotlights.
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,CaikIQ,7,Tue Jul 21 13:55:58 2015 UTC,"I wanted AK to be the spirit of Amadeus Arkham that we learned about in Asylum. It would have been a great throwback to those who played since the start and it could have literally been anyone inside the suit, possessed by his spirit. Just my thoughts, anyway."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,CaikIQ,3,Tue Jul 21 08:11:02 2015 UTC,"That would have been unique, but I don't really remember much of this character. What would have been his motive for working with scarecrow against Batman?"
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,Tamaur,3,Tue Jul 21 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Amadeus' wife and child (?) were killed by a patient at Arkham Asylum causing him to go crazy and be admitted to his own asylum. I guess you could link Bruce's parents death or something similar to Amadeus' insanity."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,mattyglen87,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:11 2015 UTC,Interesting. Would have at least been a cool side quest in this game.

BatmanArkham,3e12t7,The5Virtues,5,Tue Jul 21 07:57:56 2015 UTC,I feel like Rocksteady ran out of time developing the game.

BatmanArkham,3e12t7,thuglife2e,4,Tue Jul 21 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"Wow... That... actually would have been pretty great. Early on, before the DLC announcements and online interviews made it painfully obvious who the Knight was going to be, I had actually hoped it would be Strange himself (somehow still alive) behind the mask.   In the comics Strange is obsessed with Batman to the point of wanting to be him. He even has his own Bat-armor the he likes to put on in the comfort of his own home. They hint at this in the Riddler interviews in Arkham City, but never actually did anything with it, so I had hoped this would be the final culmination of all that. Strange going full-on bonkers and using what remained of TIGER and Ra's Al Ghul's funding to turn himself into a new Batman, a ""Better"" Batman."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,hino,0,Tue Jul 21 13:05:59 2015 UTC,The problem is the audience wouldn't care about the random guy.
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,delahunt,13,Tue Jul 21 15:54:00 2015 UTC,"They came up with a decent cover for the name. In the Arkham universe, Jason was tortured for a year (holy shit) in an abandoned wing in the Asylum. So he's the Knight from Arkham, who wants to kill the Dark Knight."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,The5Virtues,0,Tue Jul 21 06:21:27 2015 UTC,Where was this explained?
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,YouTypeTooSlow,6,Tue Jul 21 07:11:18 2015 UTC,It's explained as you play Arkham Knight.
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,Blaculahunter,3,Tue Jul 21 07:36:17 2015 UTC,It is during the reveal of who AK is. Joker faked the video and kept JT in Arkham for like a year.

BatmanArkham,3e12t7,Hasmith99,8,Tue Jul 21 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"I thought the media should have made a bigger deal of Batman being unmasked also.  They should have talked about his parents being murdered and generally had more shock from the revelation, particularly Vicki Vale who apparently knew Bruce by the answering machine messages."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,LTmad,4,Tue Jul 21 09:12:15 2015 UTC,"True, but her personal relationship with Bruce doesn't seem like she wanted that on the news at the moment, By the voicemail in Wayne Tower it seems she cares for him to some degree."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,Huntersteve,2,Tue Jul 21 09:14:57 2015 UTC,"I guess to me it seems like she might show more astonishment. That's like an oh my fucking god moment, that this playboy has been acting the whole time and is really the baddest motherfucker walking the earth, instead of being a withdrawn weird dude from his tragedy, he's the strongest anyone could be."
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,delahunt,3,Tue Jul 21 09:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she seemed pretty shocked on the screen after Gordon took the mask off, but it wasn't in focus and the camera cut away."

BatmanArkham,3e12t7,dogty,8,Tue Jul 21 05:57:18 2015 UTC,I think he was just pointing at the the idea of having a satisfying hand-to-hand combat experience as the final fight with AK/Jason. God knows a hand-to-hand fight sequence against anyone else in the Bat family would be nothing less than extraordinary.
BatmanArkham,3e12t7,BewareTheSuperman,3,Tue Jul 21 06:05:38 2015 UTC,Exactly.
BatmanArkham,3e3c9w,Nihilus09,5,Tue Jul 21 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that Barbara should have stayed dead because finding out she was still alive really ruined that portion of the game for me considering I was like ""WHAT THE FUCK THEY JUST KILLED HER!"" and I thought shit was gonna get real."

BatmanArkham,3e3c9w,eric844,6,Tue Jul 21 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"He had a perfect reason to whine. Batman kept treating him like a little kid, not trusting him or accepting his help, having him slave away in the movie studios working on an incurable disease and not even telling him upfront that the woman he loved was dead. He was being a total dick."
BatmanArkham,3e3c9w,BarnumFly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah i know. It wasn't really his fault, just made him less likable. Sorta reminded me of the Chris O'Donnel Robin"

BatmanArkham,3e3c9w,BarnumFly,3,Tue Jul 21 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I thought it was refreshing. So many shows and movies think a death makes something more intense or sad and I think it can be a cheap way to intensify a scene. I really liked how Batman was able to save all his allies, and came out on top in almost every way. If one of the family had died, Scarecrow could still have had a victory in his defeat, but without a death, Scarecrow doesn't really have anything to brag about, besides revealing Batman's identity, which Batman showed he didn't really care about. He couldn't hurt the family. He couldn't kill Batman. He lost. Completely."
BatmanArkham,3e3c9w,Evenseeker,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about him losing completely. By forcing Bruce to unmask himself before the world, he effectively ended the Batman's career. I mean, think about it. Even with Joker crippling Barbara, torturing Jason and killing Talia, even with Bane destroying the Batcave and nearly killing Alfred, even with all the ways his enemies have hurt him, Batman always moved forward, he never stopped waging his war on crime.  You can interpret that ending in a number of ways, sure. But the fact is Scarecrow achieved the rare feat of changing the status quo. He did win, in a way."
BatmanArkham,3e3c9w,BarnumFly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:33 2015 UTC,Apparently it's the first time ever in Batman history a villian succeeded in unmasking him.

BatmanArkham,3e2737,JDRoc,10,Tue Jul 21 11:36:48 2015 UTC,"I did it in the first Batman AR Challenge - Reason: if combo breaks, it'll end anyway. I barely use counters. I mainly jump over foes. Jump, jump, jump, jump... it'll give time to think your next move. Remember: KEEP JUMPING! Make a list of these and mark the ones you've completed. It helps a lot - you'll retry some times and you'll probably lose track without the list. Main thing here is to get some moves out of the way as soon as possible, especially those that leave you exposed to attack.    I always start out like this: * 01 - Batclaw Slam - PS4: L2+Triangle, Square // Xbox: LT+Y, X * 02 - Counter - PS4: Triangle // Xbox: Y * 03 - Super Stun - PS4: Circle, Circle, Circle // Xbox: B, B, B * 04 - Aerial Juggle - PS4: Circle, Circle, Circle, Square // Xbox: B, B, B, X * 05 - Aerial Attack - PS4: Circle, X, X // Xbox: B, A, A    It's likely that while doing those, you also did: * 06 - Strike - PS4: Square // Xbox: X * 07 - Redirect (Jump) - PS4: Left Stick+X, X // Xbox: Left Stick+A, A    Now, mix in some gadgets: * 08 - Quick Electrical Charge - PS4: L2+Circle // Xbox: LT+B * 09 - Quick Batarang - PS4: L2 // Xbox: LT * 10 - Quick Explosive Gel - PS4: L2+Square // Xbox: LT+X    Keep jumping over enemies and punching here and there to build up your combo meter. Whenever it fills up (flashing yellow), use one of these: * 11 - Special Combo Takedown - PS4: Circle+Triangle // Xbox: B+Y * 12 - Special Combo Disarm and Destroy - PS4: Square+Triangle // Xbox: X+Y * 13 - Special Combo Remote Electrical Charge - PS4: Hold L2+Circle // Xbox: Hold LT+B * 14 - Special Combo Batarang - PS4: Hold L2 // Xbox: Hold LT * 15 - Special Combo Explosive Gel - PS4: Hold L2+Square // Xbox: Hold LT+X * 16 - Special Combo Batclaw - PS4: Hold L2+Triangle // Xbox: Hold LT+Y * 17 - Special Combo Multi Ground Takedown - PS4: X+Circle // Xbox: A+B    Some extra moves you can use: * 18 - Cape Stun - PS4: Circle // Xbox: B * 19 - Batclaw Super Stun - PS4: L2+Triangle, Circle // Xbox: LT+Y, B * 20 - Charged Super Stun - PS4: Hold Circle // Xbox: Hold B    Avoid using these, unless you're really comfortable with them: * 21 - Beat Down - PS4: Circle, Square, Square, Square // Xbox: B, X, X, X * 22 - Ground Takedown - PS4: L2+Triangle // Xbox: LT+Y * 23 - Blade Dodge Takedown - PS4: Left Stick, Hold & Release Triangle // Xbox: Left Stick, Hold & Release Y * 24 - Combat Pick Up - PS4: R2+Circle // Xbox: RT+B    JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP. It'll change the way you play this game - you'll hit x100s combo easily without being awesome at the combat (that's me)."
BatmanArkham,3e2737,leonardofelin,2,Tue Jul 21 12:48:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I've tried this exact strategy. My problem is I just lose track and end up panicking, not remembering what ti do next. When I start jumping to think about what to do, I just freeze. Kinda lame, I know. Anyway, I sent you a friend request. I'd appreciate the help"
BatmanArkham,3e2737,factually_accurate_1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:42 2015 UTC,"Just pause the game if you lose track or just keep jumping. You are virtually untouchable if you are jumping and the combo doesn't break, so just keep jumping while you plan your next move.  There is also an AR challenge you do with Nightwing where it counts each move performed by Nightwing and Batman as a unique move, so that cuts down the move list to half. Just do that challenge and perform 8 moves with Batman, switch to Nightwing and perform the same 8 moves again and you will get the achievement/trophy."
BatmanArkham,3e2737,nickulo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:35 2015 UTC,Seriously? Nightwing moves count?! Wish I knew this....
BatmanArkham,3e2737,leonardofelin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the Freeze Grenade and Special Combo Freeze Grenade. Those help you get hit less.   Aerial takedown is another to consider, but you have to make sure you're relatively clear of other enemies.   And I accidentally did a Batclaw + dodge the other day... Pulled a guy toward me and used the momentum to throw him pretty far. Not sure if hat counts as a separate combat move.   I used the dodge/redirect a lot too while I was doing this. But IIRC you can only do that twice before dropping your combo. And the quick fire gadgets you can only use one of at a time. Multiples will drop your combo. But you can quick fire and dodge before striking without dropping he combo.   I think you should keep trying this yourself OP. It'll be way more satisfying when you get it done."
BatmanArkham,3e2737,Nitschke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the Freeze Grenade and Combo tip.  Re: jumping. As long as you jump over a thug (I'd say ""contact"") it will not drop the combo. If you jump AWAY from a thug (no contact) then you need to hit someone on your next move or you'll lose the combo."

BatmanArkham,3e2737,megamatt8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:49 2015 UTC,You can do it in the story near the end of the game.  It's when you have to put a certain someone in a box. You only fight 1 person and they have unlimited health as long as you don't put him in the box.  Just do 1 move and then keep punching him until you figure out your next move.  Hope that makes sense.

BatmanArkham,3e189x,nickulo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:18:17 2015 UTC,"There's one in Panessa Studios (I'm sure) where you have to change the colour of Riddler switches until you get them in the right sequence (blue, red, yellow, green - something like that). The correct sequence can be found on the wall in the opposite room - I had no idea, and stumbled on the right answer after a few tries entirely by luck.  There's another one (can't remember where), were a trophy was on a wall surrounded by small Riddler switches. Hitting a switch would also deactivate the one opposite it. I still have no idea what I was supposed to do - I just spammed it with Batarangs until it gave me the trophy."
BatmanArkham,3e189x,TheBatPencil,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:36 2015 UTC,"My favorite one to actually solve finally was the ""watch your head"" one under Bleake Island. The one with the big electric field above you. It was one of the first ones on my map, and I kept coming back hoping I had the right gadget. The EMP was the last voluntary Batmobile upgrade I got and when I did I immediately when to this riddle and got it figured out.   Although probably the LAST trophy I got was the one on the NW side of Bleake where you have to glide into the building from the water. I spent so long crawling all over that building trying to figure out how to get in. Thought maybe the story would take me in there at some point. When I finally found it I just sat there and stared at it for a minute... Thinking about how dumb I was."

BatmanArkham,3e0phm,KieferSkunkerland,5,Tue Jul 21 01:40:58 2015 UTC,"Mr. Freeze (AC): One of the best (if not THE best) boss fights in gaming.  Deathstroke (AO): A really well done boss fight that hits home just how important timing is for a fight with the well placed counters. (Even if it is a bitch and a half on New Game+.)  Arkham Knight (AK): While I think this would have been much better as a Mr. Freeze style fight, I still think it did an excellent job of being a Predator boss fight.  Ra's Al Ghul (AC): While similar to the Deathstroke fight which came later, I still thought this did a great job of mixing several types of combat into one boss fight and the environment looks great.  Killer Croc (AA): Maybe not mechanically the best boss fight, but atmospherically amazingly good."
BatmanArkham,3e0phm,Fricknmaniac,5,Tue Jul 21 02:19:49 2015 UTC,"The first time Croc popped out of the water I ran like a sissy hoping to reach the obviously booby trapped floor. I didn't succeed.

BatmanArkham,3e0phm,marbanasin,6,Tue Jul 21 19:40:40 2015 UTC,"Joker (AO) Poison Ivy (AA) Deathstroke (AO) Mr. Freeze (AC) Grundy & The Penguin (AC)   My listing isn't based on game mechanics but on how much it reminded me of something that felt like a true Batman moment.   The Beatdown of the Joker in the Prison Chapel during Arkham Origins is easily my favorite scene in the entire series, it was magnificent and really captured what I'd always longed for in a Joker vs Batman confrontation.  I know many fans hated Poison Ivy's boss fight for the tedious wait-and-exploit mechanics of it but I adored the depiction they gave her. The plants protecting her, the hordes of mind controlled security personnel, and Ivy's own killer flytrap just felt like exactly what I'd expect from trying to fight her head on.   Deathstroke, again, was just what I wanted from a brawl between two of the world's best fighters, but it really did feel like a brawl and as much as I loved it I would have liked it more if there'd been more to it, maybe a predator sequence where you had to get close to break his guns before going hand-to-hand.   Mr. Freeze was marvelous in how menacing and relentless he was and I loved it, even if it was just a drawn out predator hunt.  Finally PEnguin and Grundy, I think this one really gets overlooked a lot. I loved the fight with Grundy, and I especially love the conclusion with the Penguin. Once more, it felt like just what I'd expect in a Batman showdown. The Penguin's not a brawler in his own right, he hides behind muscle, and once it's down to just him versus the Bat he pulls out a BFG to try and keep up."
BatmanArkham,3e0phm,The5Virtues,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"So I'm basing these on actual gameplay, although theme and feel do come into them, cause if the gameplay didn't match the character (Looking at you AK Deathstroke boss fight) then it wasn't quite right.   Mr. Freeze (AC) - I still regard it as one of the best boss fights ever done in any series Deathstroke (AO) - While I didn't find this one particularly challenging, it felt like a proper fight between two equals and you really did have to be quick on your feet Bane at Gotham Royal (AO) - Although I hated the fight with him at Blackgate when he goes all TN-1, the first fight was very true to the character and how he not some roided out muscle man who will run into walls. Ra's al Ghul (AC) - I thought this one in particular was very different from the other boss fights in the series, but that's mainly because of the intermittent cut scenes and the sand landscape inside Batman's mind Johnny Charsima/Joker (AK) - Basically the whole sequence with Robin working with Batman and the musical number to add was just thrilling, especially with the way it handled itself when creating your typical 'boss fight' with a non physical adversary.   I've excluded fight's like Killer Croc (AA) and Scarecrow (AA) because they didn't feel like a 'boss fight', more of a sequence of avoiding someone, even though I loved the Scarecrow sections in AA. Although I never liked the Croc 'fight' cause it was just extremely tedious and frustrating, though I will give it that it accomplished brilliant atmosphere."
BatmanArkham,3e0phm,Autumn_Twin,4,Tue Jul 21 10:12:40 2015 UTC,"In no particular order: Mr Freeze (AC), Deathstroke (AO), Clayface (AC), Albert King (AK), Two Face (AC).

I feel like he was the worst boss to date, he was the hardest boss in the entire Arkham series to date (and he was so early on in the game it was ridiculous) simply because you had to rely on luck. Keep hitting him and hope he doesn't do an unblockable attack on you. Counter his attack and hope that it hurt him and that he won't do another uncounterable attack on you. It was insanely frustrating. Deathstroke is the only reason I have not attempted that game on the 'die once and you start all over mode' (sorry the name escapes me)"

BatmanArkham,3e2xkf,telltalemaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:54 2015 UTC,"At first I though it was Calendar Man as well but after reading his journal I likely doubt it. For starters we know he wanted to kill Batman on Halloween and likely had some sort of plan. But Scarecrow kinda stole his idea and he went as far as to write ""Damn Scarecrow"" in his journal.   Now the likely theory is he saw the unmasking and planted bombs on manor knowing Bruce would return. But that seems extremely unlikely especially considering who we're talking about. He would have had to gather the necessary equipment which would take some time. Get over to Wayne Manor and somehow get close enough to the building. A building with top of the line security and likely on high alert as part of Knightfall and the earlier kidnapping of Babara. Bruce instructed Alfred to lockdown the Cave and likely the manor as the Arkham Knight seemed to know their security.  He would also have to work while the media presence increased to report the breaking news. You also have to consider his physiology. He's a large heavyset man, who wears a metal brace on his leg as one of them is short than the other. Meaning he likely doesn't move very fast. It's also very unlikely he would get help as he normally works as a lone serial killer.   The only way it could be Calender man is if he planned to attack Wayne Manor to attract Batman. But even then he will still need to get past the security which would be very difficult for a mere human. And it looked like there were several bombs throughout the building that would have taken a long time to setup. He has the motivation but I don't think this is something one normal person could do. Now if we saw Ra's al Ghul or someone with more connections or abilities in the crowd I'd believe it."

BatmanArkham,3e2xkf,ARTIFICIAL_SAPIENCE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, you know what i think happens ? I honestly think that bruce wayne retires from being batman for a while. With all of the nods the the dark knight returns, i see whatever happens in the future of this universe being heavily based on that arc. There's this part in the dark knight returns movie, where batman uses the fear toxin on a two face thug. His appearance ( as perceived by the thug ) is very similar to this, ""new"" Batman's appearance that we see at the end of the knightfall protocol. Not only that, this ""new"" batman seems to be using the fear toxin in some capacity. Then here's the kicker. The thug who says ""Hey, freak ! Maybe you missed the news, batman's dead"" is labeled as ""two face thug"" when subtitles are toggled on. AND, he is wearing the same type of hat as the two face thug in the dark knight returns is. Does this mean anything at all ? I think yes. Think about it. You have a reason for bruce retiring (he even says he is going to quit), you have the manor blowing up like in the dark knight returns, and you have this fear toxin/two face thug scene. Maybe that knightfall scene takes place after bruce's retirement, and he is once again taking up the mantle. I mean, its clear that much time has passed, right ? The thugs are very confident that batman is dead, Jim gordon is mayor, and tim is proposing or getting married to barbara. Hmmm...."

BatmanArkham,3e08vy,07jonesj,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess I'm not super familiar with their stuff. I did enjoy the fact that they showed the process of getting the achievement instead of just the best run.
BatmanArkham,3e08vy,nickulo,2,Tue Jul 21 04:15:18 2015 UTC,"It took me a good 4-5 tries, and I looked up how to get the achievement. Gliding isn't the problem, it's maintaining enough altitude to make it to all 3. If you don't time it just right, and keep the right pace on dives, you'll end up in the water."
BatmanArkham,3e08vy,demonfoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"I started with Salvation Bridge to see if I could even get under it, and then used it as a launch point instead. But once I did that I had it done on the first try, shrugged, and figured it was no biggie. I guess I was just lucky.   Granted I also had the max grapnel boost for my first shot. That's probably a requirement."
BatmanArkham,3e08vy,nickulo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:10 2015 UTC,"I did. The last bridge was the issue. I was either slightly too high and Batman would climb up, or I was too low and Batman wouldn't make it all the way across the bridge."
BatmanArkham,3e08vy,Expired_Bacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:12 2015 UTC,So I didn't watch through the whole video. Is the verdict that you have to do it without using the grapnel boost in between or are you allowed to use it?

BatmanArkham,3e0ska,HighRulerStarch,2,Tue Jul 21 02:05:17 2015 UTC,"It's hard difficulty with no counter symbols, essentially. There are probably other changes, but the missing counter symbols is the biggest difference between hard difficulty and knightmare."

BatmanArkham,3e05tq,thilinac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"Look, anyone operating without a key generator from Valve who is selling steam keys is grey market. Grey market means the legality of those sales is questionable depending on any given key.   GMG does not have the authority to revoke keys because they did not generate the key. They can submit a request to steam which they probably have but steam has more important things to worry about than someone having a game key from a reseller."

I wrote a list of 15 moves and got it out in half a dozen tries.  The Joker part is probably easier, but I can't stand to interrupt cool story sections to trophy hunt. Even if I've played it before. It removes all my interest in the following scenes if Batman has stopped his eternal struggle with Joker to spend a bunch of time trying to hit him with 15 different moves in one combo. That's something I love about the AR challenges, they're a tool that Batman uses to hone his skills so it only makes sense that he tries a bunch of weird shit in them."

My first playthrough on PS4 was really smooth but now the game seems to be really buggy.  I've had this stuttering due to loading, objects not loading in properly in time, disappearing models (including a vantage point during the Arkham Knight fight, which left me hovering in midair while swinging around) and a whole bunch of other stuff.

Here's a bad man with a Batmobile rippling with guns, and a deranged ""Let's get nuts!"" kind of attitude, the 89 armor just feels right for this."
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,bnr55,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Returns suit, it just looks better to me. But the '89 suit will do fine."
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,Drewisawesome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:08 2015 UTC,I'd believe that if there were challenge maps with the pack. Something like Bruce in Nanda Parbat dlc for AO. The batmobile skin will be for race tracks and 1989 skin for the rest of the game. Don't panic.
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,2Scribble,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:49 2015 UTC,Everyone assumed- but I had my doubts.  We'll see. This 'source' isn't really saying much. But the way licensing can work with hollywood studios I unfortunately will be pleasantly surprised if we have full access to the Burton suit in game.
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,tcooker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:29 2015 UTC,Is there any official work yet?
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,TonyVilla89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:35 2015 UTC,Well the batmobile skin not being usable in story is pretty much a given - but why would they lock the skin? That doesn't make any sense - there's no real challenge mode so there's no real purpose to the skin. They'd be chopping their own legs off by locking it to only one miniscule portion of the game
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,TehBreezy1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:41:12 2015 UTC,the suit can be used in story mode but the batmobile skin is for the races only

BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,SP821,-2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"Batmobile makes sense, even if they did create it's own battlemode, which they could have, the animations would all have to be re done as the car doesn't have a giant trunk   The suit though? Jesus this game is turning into trash."
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,Scartoxic,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:24 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd be OK with the default batmobile being used in cut scenes to make up for the lack of trunk.
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,vamplosion,0,Tue Jul 21 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"Now I regret the season pass. I should have listened to everyone saying the only way to stop games from abusing this ridiculous DLC+ system was to stop buying it. I figured AK would easily keep me entertained for months on end and the pass would be worth it. Wish I could get a refund right about now because if the future DLC is as short & boring as the Harley, Red Hood,& Batgirl DLC then it's the ultimate ripoff that I fell for like an idiot"
BatmanArkham,3dxrm3,liquidgelcaps,0,Mon Jul 20 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"I just expect disappointment with this game right now. While it is well done, it feels like every thought of ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" is met with ""yeah, but it's much less than you thought it would be"" when it comes to Arkham Knight. First the Knight himself. Then the no challenge maps.  Then the super short Harley DLC. Then the no free roam for the other characters. Then the slightly less short but in no way worth the pass Batgirl DLC. It's just one thing after another. I feel like they should have delayed this game another six months and made it perfect. I expect a lot from Rocksteady because I know what they're capable of. This game feels much less complete than City or even Origins. Technically, it's super impressive.  But for the ""final"" Batman game, I and many others feel a bit let down.   So while I would have said, ""Of course the 1989 skin will be usable in the main game"" before release, now I just don't know. I would not be surprised if it isn't. If it's a licensing issue, I would rather they just offered a suit they had full rights to, and kept the racing maps. It's kind of sad really."
BatmanArkham,3e0r8v,goran_dragic,3,Tue Jul 21 01:54:49 2015 UTC,"Well there is also the tunnel area that you access through Port Adams, as well as breakable objects and disarming the bombs in thugs' brains"
BatmanArkham,3e0r8v,RandomMandalorian,2,Tue Jul 21 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, i forgot to add the bombs to my post. the map says i have two more, so that'd put me at 225  do breakable objects count towards the 243? i have like 50 of them left but i'm at 210. and destroying them has never affected my riddle progress"
BatmanArkham,3e0r8v,RandomMandalorian,3,Tue Jul 21 02:04:48 2015 UTC,Every 5 of any kind of breakable object amounts to one riddle
BatmanArkham,3e0r8v,RandomMandalorian,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:16 2015 UTC,Oh and of course Panessa Studios has riddles as well
BatmanArkham,3e0r8v,RandomMandalorian,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:21 2015 UTC,"oh right i got everything from panessa, but holy shit i had no idea that 5 breakable objects were one riddle. that explains it. thanks"

BatmanArkham,3dy57k,BakerBalls,15,Mon Jul 20 14:19:18 2015 UTC,"this seems to be a big consensus with the game and I agree, its part of what makes me a little nervous about the ""season of infamy"" DLC where 'Gotham villains invade"". Are we getting a bunch of cheap boss battles? Will it be actual missions leading up to a battle? With so little information given, I can't justify getting the season pass to potentially have interesting villain fights."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,drakelb,15,Mon Jul 20 14:39:45 2015 UTC,Joker in a tank. Two Face in a tank. Penguin in a tank. Mr. Freeze in a tank....
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,drakelb,18,Mon Jul 20 15:04:12 2015 UTC,"and just to make it interesting let's make sure its all the same looking tank too, and the way to defeat them is to take out 4 cobra tanks and then launch some rockets at the main villain tank."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,TySoN_F,14,Mon Jul 20 15:19:55 2015 UTC,"Well I won't lie. If Penguin came packing in a giant rubber duck, I feel like that would be a fun and damn funny tank battle."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,maxt0r,3,Mon Jul 20 17:23:26 2015 UTC,I'd buy that for a dollar!

BatmanArkham,3dy57k,moshisimo,10,Tue Jul 21 06:09:32 2015 UTC,For me the lack of boss battles is more confusing than anything. All the other games thrived on boss battles and suddenly there's almost none? Sounds sketchy.
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,Hasmith99,6,Mon Jul 20 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the ending (not the 100% ending, haven't got there yet) as in how cinematic it was, at least from my interpretation of it. I felt it really did a great job at showing how Scarecrow basically scared Joker out of Batman unknowingly using the fear toxin, and it was really fun to play through it with the changing sceneries and all. BUT, it's not a battle as in you can't lose. It doesn't take skill, it doesn't reward you for your effort in a tough challenge. It's more of a 'sit back, push a few buttons, and enjoy. That was very, VERY disappointing."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,TheBatPencil,5,Mon Jul 20 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"I loved the idea of that part, as well. Actually did it yesterday. I loved playing Joker and seeing the Jokermobile and what not. But yes....it wasn't a challenge or anything, just very cinematic. I assume the Knightfall initiative is much the same, but I'm still looking forward to doing that.   p.s. Fuck the Riddler"
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,DontcallmeGeorge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:24 2015 UTC,Only way it could've been better is if we could fight people hand-to-hand like in Asylum.
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,maxt0r,13,Mon Jul 20 21:50:21 2015 UTC,"WB Montreal blew Rocksteady out of the water when it came to boss battles. Even if they didn't always get it right, they definitely made an effort to make sure they were all different and appropriately interesting, dramatic and cinematic.  Rocksteady's boss sequences always felt more... videogamey, I guess. The Deathstroke and Two-Face fights in Knight feel like recycled concepts thrown in late in development, and the Predator fight with the Arkham Knight lacked any kind of dramatic punch.  I think the Arkham games are at their most engaging when they break their own conventions, rather than force square pegs into round holes just to stick to them. The Scarecrow sequences in Asylum and the Deathstroke battle in Origins, for example; they force you to think on the spot, and it feels more like actually being Batman rather than a video game."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,Nihilus09,2,Mon Jul 20 16:59:07 2015 UTC,Freeze batte in AC is better than any in Origins fact!
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,ChubbyHippo109,0,Tue Jul 21 00:03:00 2015 UTC,I think the terrible ones in AK cancel out the awesomeness of the Freeze fight.
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,ChubbyHippo109,6,Tue Jul 21 06:40:08 2015 UTC,"I think people are a bit harsh on the boss battles in this game. Yeah, I know ones like Deathstroke are complete shit but some like Pyg, the Arkham Knight tunnel one and Harley and Joker in the Batgirl DLC I actually found really enjoyable."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,07jonesj,6,Mon Jul 20 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"Pyg fight was cool, I'll give you that."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,2Scribble,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:35 2015 UTC,The riddler's boss fight is actually pretty good.

BatmanArkham,3dy57k,ToledoJones,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:56 2015 UTC,"I actually loved all the boss fights because I loved the combat in the batmobile, but the Riddler's boss fight was so much fun again."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,2Scribble,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel Arkham Knight has the worst gameplay out of the three Rocksteady games... but the best story. Interestingly, ranking the Arkham games for both story and gameplay reveals completely opposite lists for me.  Story: Knight > Asylum > City  Gameplay: City > Asylum > Knight"
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,cy1763,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:15 2015 UTC,I'd put that  Story: Origins>Knight>Asylum>City  Gameplay: City>Origins>Asylum>Knight  But I'm a PC user so Origins was always smooth for me and despite how many people hate it's always been my favorite -shrug-

BatmanArkham,3dy57k,slickestwood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:33 2015 UTC,I think Knight plays slightly better than city. At least in terms of mechanics.
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,Hasmith99,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:00 2015 UTC,what boss battles?
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,diogosanto,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:24 2015 UTC,"My problem with the boss battles in AA and AC was with the exception of mr freeze, the boss battles were very one note. Only way to do damage was to do X. then rinse, wash and repeat.   AK biggest offense with bosses was too many in the tank mode."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,Hasmith99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"I would have been happy if you at least fought Deathstroke in some manner after he's out of the tank. That one punch quicktime event was lame as shit. He's Deathstroke! He would have had a backup plan. Shit, how hard would it have been to make some sort of simple fight after he's out of the tank? Super underwhelming."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,LosLoneGringo,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"Well, while not great, at least they're not Titan Joker levels of bad... Eish, after all that teasing, Joker prefers to be distracted by Jack Ryder's helicopter..."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,zsxdflip,3,Mon Jul 20 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"I remember too many of Asylum's bosses feeling similar/the same as the Titan battles. Too many of Knight's bosses were similar tank battles. IMO only City did them right consistently, which is why I will always hold it a step over the others. Dat Mr. Freeze boss."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,rufusbball,3,Mon Jul 20 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"Titan Joker was a bit absurd, but at least it was a true boss battle."
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,RetlawInfinity,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"Titan Joker was great what are you talking about? And for why he got distracted, Joker's a showman so he'd want to get as much showtime as possible and he didn't expect Batman could beat him"
BatmanArkham,3dy57k,ARTIFICIAL_SAPIENCE,2,Mon Jul 20 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"You're the first person I've ever seen saying that the Titan Joker battle was great...

BatmanArkham,3dzi9l,jeanwearinfool,3,Mon Jul 20 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound critical but I hope you understand I don't mean it mean spirited.  I started watching this and ended up going to just watch the walk through instead.  I think you should think more about your edits.  They seem to jump all over the place and there doesn't seem to be a cohesive point as to why.  Some even jump in the middle of dialogue.  Honestly just doing a well played playthrough tells the story well enough.  If you're trying to tell a different story than the DLC maybe consider what cut scenes you need to tell that story and what gameplay elements you need to drive the action for that and try to go easier on the editing in the gameplay sections.  Although, tbh, it's a very short DLC and I don't know how you could pull any story other than the one that is already there out of it.  Maybe if I knew your end game intention better I could give you better feed back.  All that being said, you look like you're pretty good at the game!"

BatmanArkham,3dzgdi,HaouLeo,4,Mon Jul 20 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"well, they haven't really given details of any of the incoming DLC apart from a name and a really short description. All we can do is hope for the best. I was also very disappointed with a lot of need for speed challenges and 3 combat challenges. C'mon, throwing a bunch of respawning enemies into an arena isn't that hard."
BatmanArkham,3dzgdi,The5Virtues,3,Mon Jul 20 20:18:50 2015 UTC,Right? They had a perfect formula working since Asylum and they decided to change it. I don't dislike being able to access challenges from the in-game world but limiting it so much is distasteful.
BatmanArkham,3dzuek,sinisteredge95,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"There are only 2 3 classic Predator ""challenge maps"", and you can only use Batman on those.

BatmanArkham,3dzuek,GreekHole,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:29 2015 UTC,so the current challenge maps are only AR for batman?

The department store entrance where it originally started, you should be able to walk right in now. Then there's the skyscraper where the mission ended, that leads to the area you fought Knight.  The actual ""mining tunnels"" that connect the two areas have no riddler trophies and are inaccessible."

It managed to survive bigger damage like the Origins, Asylum, City and the new one in Knight suffered."
BatmanArkham,3dwiqr,Mega1500,17,Mon Jul 20 03:59:33 2015 UTC,I was actually a little bummed it didn't get damaged. I was expecting Batman to have gotten in a surprise explosion or something. Thus damaging the Post Arkham City suit and making him try out the brand new one. Trying to get into a room is a pretty unexciting reason for a new suit.
BatmanArkham,3dwiqr,RaffNav,23,Mon Jul 20 07:52:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was completely lazy. We'd done so much harder than that in the pervious 3 games and then like 2 guys with guns and we need a new suit. Really?  That mission should have been the intro to Fear Takedowns and such but the switch to the suit should have been like it was in the E3 reveal, in Wayne Tower."
BatmanArkham,3dwiqr,TheJoshider10,5,Mon Jul 20 08:33:32 2015 UTC,I wonder if you can get the suit early if you go to Wayne Tower str8 up?

BatmanArkham,3dwiqr,Techno_Bacon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"It's lazy because it's a very generic and pointless place to give a new suit. We've spent the previous 2 games battling larger than life characters and easily triple the amount of thugs as that one room, yet like 3 armed thugs and suddenly ""oops, better get a new suit"".   Instead, they could have done something good. Have us play with the post AC suit until we meet the Arkham Knight and then have the suit get absolutely fucked. Show the threat of the Arkham Knight and that he cannot be messed with, therefore we go to Wayne Tower to get a new suit."
BatmanArkham,3dwiqr,TheJoshider10,16,Tue Jul 21 18:49:09 2015 UTC,I really like the battle damage you take throughout the game. I think it's a nice touch.

BatmanArkham,3dwiqr,Millicay,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:35:51 2015 UTC,The suit got beat up in my playthrough. There is an option to use the perfect suit that is resistant to wear and tear...
BatmanArkham,3dwiqr,versak,5,Mon Jul 20 09:11:40 2015 UTC,This is the AC suit..
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,deadhead20,31,Mon Jul 20 10:20:40 2015 UTC,"Deathstroke's 'fight' was easier to me than AK.  Regardless,  I'm with OP on this one.  Why even put him in if you're going to do a disservice to the character by sticking him a tank and even have said character remark on the ride to GCPD about not fighting man to man.  By the time the militias leader goes MIA the night is about over anyway.  I don't think it was a necessary.  I'm no storyteller but I would've just had the militia operate more like terrorist cells defunct of central leadership at the point AK goes MIA,  but also still listening to voice syth commands thinking AK was back.  They listen to it even with Deathstroke the proclaimed new leader too which is laughable."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,00100_00100,6,Mon Jul 20 10:49:43 2015 UTC,"Why even put him in if you're going to do a disservice to the character by sticking him a tank and even have said character remark on the ride to GCPD about not fighting man to man.    I guess the answer to that is ""because they did the same to pretty much all the characters""."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,Tonkarz,3,Mon Jul 20 12:30:29 2015 UTC,"yeah after dying the first time, I simply hacked a tank, and then went around and took out 3 other cobra's, the hacked tank took out one for me and then fought Deathstroke for a while. when I got there, I unleashed a missile salvo and that was the end of it."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,styxtraveler,2,Mon Jul 20 11:49:28 2015 UTC,"They listen to it even with Deathstroke the proclaimed new leader too which is laughable.   I agree with you on everything else, but sometimes they'll say stuff like ""guys, the boss is back!"" or ""Told you he wouldn't leave us behind."" But yeah... Deathstroke in a Tank isn't what I expected at all..."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,Pollera,12,Mon Jul 20 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"They had to put in someone, otherwise doing side missions after completing the main story wouldn't make any sense. Deathstroke was a perfect replacement for the Knight.  But yeah, that boss fight being a tank battle is upsetting :("
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,BeyondBrett,3,Mon Jul 20 10:24:10 2015 UTC,True. The hype on fighting Deathstroke was what kept me going.
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,Pollera,5,Mon Jul 20 19:28:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, felt like a huge waste. I was hoping it would go from tank battle to melee fight but no. If anything it was easier than the Cloudburst fight since once the Cobras are down you go straight into direct combat with Deathstroke's tank."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,maxusy3k,5,Mon Jul 20 10:37:04 2015 UTC,"I thought for sure that once you got Slade to the GCPD, he would come flying out of the back of the Batmobile for a real fight, but he just went peacefully to jail."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,Ianm1225,5,Mon Jul 20 12:31:09 2015 UTC,"And then he threatens to kill all the dudes inside the cell with him, and he didn't even keep his word! Seriously uncool, Slade."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,RdJokr,3,Mon Jul 20 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"What bothers me is that slade is still a huge threat without weapons! He would have a high chance of killing batman on the walk in! But arkham batman is almost more superhuman than slade, which I'm okay with until they neuter one of my favorite characters to make batman look good.  I will add that I love the game a ton, I just have a lot of gripes with it. This game had the highest highs and lowest lows of the series, personally. More highs than lows, though, so I'd still give it an 8.5-9."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,N67nightmare,3,Mon Jul 20 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"As Joker says it himself: -""When does the title World's Greatest Assassin starts to become false advertising?"""
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,BarnumFly,3,Mon Jul 20 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"i know, right. It felt sooo wrong just calmly escorting him to his cell. That honestly brought the game down a peg for me"
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,WolfofOldNorth,3,Mon Jul 20 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"Hell I would have taken the boss fight from AO right after that moment. Like right in the parking lot, have Slade just manhandle Batman until he kills the police guarding the door and Batman goes off. Just a total disservice and I thought with all the delays they could have done a better job with this."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,JokerFaces2,3,Mon Jul 20 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"The fact that there's no hand-to-hand fight with the Arkham Knight or Deathstroke is by far my biggest problem with the game. After each tank battle (which I enjoy other than the fact that they replace a fistfight), the AK/DS should have launched out and initiated a hand-to-hand brawl in the street very similar/identical to the Deathstroke fight in Arkham Origins. A completely one-on-one brawl with a tight camera angle, requiring expert use of Batman's moves and gadgets as your opponent learns your tactics and begins to counter them.   Honestly, if the game had this, it would move up from an 8.5 to a 9 in my mind. That's how disappointed I was in those ""boss battles"". An actual fight against Firefly would have been great too, and again I wouldn't have even minded if it was copy+pasted from Origins. A Man-Bat fight similar to the Origins Firefly fight would have also been cool."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,Pollera,5,Mon Jul 20 14:24:35 2015 UTC,"They've always had trouble with hand to hand boss fights. It's easier to make it a predator situation (á la Mr. Freeze) or a straight up tank battle with the Batmobile. If you've played the Harley Quinn or the Batgirl DLC (though in the latter it was handled slightly better) you'll see what I mean. Especially in the Quinn story.  Nightwing showing up and pretty much behaving like a goon with a stun prod, where you jump over him and hit him in the back is ridiculous, considering you've played as him taking down tens of penguin goons in the game."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,TheBatPencil,4,Mon Jul 20 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"It feels to me that it was something added on very late into development with no time to flesh out a new scenario, so they just slightly retooled the Cloudburst battle and ran with it. The same thing appears to have happened with Two-Face; the Predator showdown with him is just a rehash of the Catwoman story at the end of City.  Dealing with ""boss"" encounters is something that the Rocksteady team has always had a bit of trouble with. Even if they didn't always hit their mark, WB Montreal deserve credit for making each ""boss"" fight something unique, interesting and relevant to the characters involved.  I was hoping that fighting the Arkham Knight would be something along the lines of the Deathstroke fight from Origins, only a bit more brutal. That would have made a lot more dramatic sense to me."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,Pollera,3,Mon Jul 20 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"That one scene where they went for each other's throats was great. I would have thought that after he got unmasked and you did the predator bit, you would have had a short scuffle with him, kinda like fighting Deathstroke but with a few less zoomed exchanges, like the Martial artists in AO. It would have made sense, gameplay-wise, because you would have fought him in all core mechanics. Combat and race Batmobile, predator and man-to-man combat."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,BiggDope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. WB did a good job with the varying tactics in each of the assassin's fights in Origins be it Shiva, Deathstroke, Bane, Copperhead, Firefly, etc."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,ShadowJuggalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of this game feels like they got rushed and couldn't finish in time with everything they had planned to include. What is there is amazing, but it makes you realize what is missing would have been so, so great."

I really thought we would've gotten something like the boss fights from Origins (which I absolutely love!) but nooo, just this shitty tank fight..."
BatmanArkham,3dxihq,Strickerx5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who didn't find the cloudburst or Slade fight all that hard? I mean, it could just be because I upgraded the hell out of the batmobile first but I still don't think the fights are that hard. I mean, it really doesn't even require that much skill. You just sneak up behind them, lock on, shoot, and run away. Not much to it. Hell, with Slade you don't even have to lock on. :/"
BatmanArkham,3dxt2y,TravisGHarrington,6,Mon Jul 20 12:29:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it was the impact against the wall, while inside a burning vehicle that killed them... LOOPHOLE!"
BatmanArkham,3dxt2y,diogosanto,2,Mon Jul 20 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"Kind of like how in Begins, Batman doesn't 'kill' Al Ghul, he just doesnt 'save' him. From the crashing burning train that he himself sabotaged.   Or how he refused to kill that single prisoner while training, so he blew up the entire building. With the prisoner still inside.  Sometimes Batman gets confused about how murder works. I guess I should be thankful he didn't go full-Keaton and just start shooting people up with the batmobile."
BatmanArkham,3dxt2y,SillyNonsense,2,Mon Jul 20 15:05:12 2015 UTC,"His rule is kind of f*cked up. People can die, but if he's not directly responsible (for him directly must be with his bare hands), he did not broke his rule. Even so, he leaves thugs in a state where they must prefer to be dead (and being unconscious in the cold, with several broken bones is pretty close to dead anyways... don't know how many survive)."
BatmanArkham,3dxt2y,diogosanto,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"In the game they seem to be okay. Sure if it were real life theyd all have broken bones and concussions while slowly freezing to death face down, but in imagination batman land theyre fine.   Batman beats the shit out of them, the cops come pick them up while they're dazed and confused, and a little while later you can find them heckling you in the GCPD like nothing happened."

BatmanArkham,3dxt2y,LokiWillRule,4,Mon Jul 20 12:42:54 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened whilst I was playing, except the car went over the wall.  But the water killed him, not Batman, so its all good, right?"
BatmanArkham,3dxt2y,BenThePieGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"It was just like in City, whenever the thugs fall in water they don't come out. I just sit there hoping they come back out, but at the same time hoping they don't."

Look this isn't a comment saying PC is TEH MASTER RACE AND DA BEST!!! or shit like that :P Origins was designed with coding and intentions that the PS3 and X360 could BARELY deliver.

Yes, but that's not really him, is it? They already nerfd him to shit anyway, it would only make him worse. Harley wouldn't stand a change against Batman&Robin, and she knew it. And non of the other villains are fighters at all (except the fire-chef ;). There would be no point trying, they all apparently have awesome layers anyway.   2) The only races you needed to do were the 3 Riddler ones and they were ok, but the Batmobile overall felt like a chore.   3) Wasn't too bad, but i agree.  4) Should have been better*  5) The overall plot could have been better too."

Thinking it is a hint that something is coming next, but whether it'll be another Batman game or another DC franchise hasn't been determined yet. Rocksteady working the DC license has worked out well for WB so far so I don't see why they wouldn't put them onto something else."
BatmanArkham,3dwppj,HappyBot9000,3,Mon Jul 20 10:30:20 2015 UTC,"I believe this to be the developers talking about making the Batman games and how this is their last one. At least for a while.

BatmanArkham,3dwppj,Samtheman53,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:39:37 2015 UTC,They are probably hinting at something as Superman gets mentioned a few times too
BatmanArkham,3dwppj,Gef210,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"I'd like to hope so, but all of the hints are kept vague enough that they don't have to commit to anything.  Some of the leaks in recent weeks indicate that WB Montreal is developing a Superman property (or at least part of it). I like Origins okay, but it was miles away from Rocksteady quality, and if people thought Knight was buggy, Origins had not only multiple game-breaking glitches but the game itself had challenges that you could only get one time during the game and never go back to. Maybe I'm a filthy casual, but I don't think the Arkham series is the right place for that kind of ""teh h@rdcorr"" attitude.  I would rather have Rocksteady do Superman, and WB Montreal take on Suicide Squad."

BatmanArkham,3dxwm0,drakelb,-8,Mon Jul 20 13:14:04 2015 UTC,But the fact that they are still basically giant turrets and guns (doesn't matter if they were meant for walls or tanks) is still un-Batman like. What if he accidentally uses the Vulcan cannon on a person? They're dead.

BatmanArkham,3dxwm0,The5Virtues,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, but to me they never captured that sensation in this. It never felt to me like ""Oh, Batman's going crazy and hallucinating the Joker"", not to mention the in-game implication that the blood is physically turning him into the Joker; it didn't feel like ""Batman's going mad!"" it felt like ""Joker's blood is magic!""  The only way I can reconcile the story in my own head, and not just scoff and the absurdity of it is to assume that's the case, Joker's blood is so screwy that it's acting as conduit for his spirit to return to the mortal coil and haunt Batman from within his own mind.  I fully acknowledge this is just personal headcanon, but it works for me, at least enough for me to stomach the only part of the story that I actually enjoyed."
BatmanArkham,3dxwm0,Pollera,4,Mon Jul 20 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"Joker's constantly asking for a whiff of more Fear Toxin. It's not just one or the other, it's both.  The blood makes batman slowly turn into a joker-ish state (as with the other infected) while the Fear Toxin enhances the psychological effects of it, causing Batman to hallucinate Joker as the infection grows stronger, and the fear of becoming the Joker turns ever closer.  That's why towards the end of the game, when Scarecrow injects you with toxin, you play as Batman after he became the Joker. It's Batman's fear coming true."
BatmanArkham,3dxwm0,The5Virtues,0,Mon Jul 20 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"I understand all that. I just find it incredibly stupid (I'd have loved it if it was purely fear toxin, it's the infectious blood thing I can't abide)."

I can't remember it fully, but I know that as Batman if you go around the tower counter clockwise, ledge takedown the patrolling guard (after the jammer guard passes), then drop off and let Batman automatically grapple, three guys will run to the balcony. You can quickly grapple up to a gargoyle and use the freeze stuff on all three of them. Then, while they're frozen blast one into the others. Boom, two medals right there. Use the sonic batarang to take out the jammer, enter through one of the outside entrances to get to the second floor grate, grapple up to the lip of the central observation chamber and watch the guards. Let one lay down a few mines, then use the mines to take out the mine layer and one or two other guards. eliminate the armored guards first using smoke and freeze grenades, take down the others using silent takedowns, ledge takedowns, or grate takedowns and earn the last medal on the final guard."

WOOSH  Out flies Batman, a blur, launched forward from the cockpit like a metal slug through a railgun, gliding wings spread, rocket boots on full blast, pulling his wings to his side and darting towards the plummeting vehicle. Reaching the car, he tears open the door with all the strength his technologically advanced suit provides, pulling the suspect out of the vehicle mere seconds before impact.   BOOM  Batman flies upward, away from the explosion at full speed, with the criminal in tow, suspended by a single rope. Batman slingshots the criminal up towards the roof of a towering building. The criminal arcs, flying about 8 feet over the edge of the roof before roughly landing on its surface. He groans, slowly attempting to get up as he notices Batman flying over the edge himself, landing right in front of the criminal, a dark, intimidating presence."

BatmanArkham,3dw5i2,namchie,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:11 2015 UTC,"New abilities for Terry: •Jump Boots: Double-tap X or A after jumping off the edge of a building/ledge to activate a brief double jump. Can be upgraded for more length/hang time. Good for jumping between buildings. •Faster movement in general: Terry's basic run would be faster than Bruce's, as well as his takedowns and how quickly he applies things like explosive gel. •Advanced Bat-Claw: The Bat-Claw can now be shot at an enemy and from there, the enemy can be tossed in any direction. Good for crowd control in large combat situations, and good for stealth options like dragging enemies through weak walls for a knockout/dragging enemies over edges more conveniently. •Advanced Voice Modulator: Works at all times, in all situations. Still has a long cooldown for a single use but that can be upgraded to be reduced. Mimics thug voices when target isn't wearing a headset. Maybe you could acquire more thug voices to affect different targets in stealth through a voice-collecting side mission that involves hunting down specific high-ranking thugs. Hope that makes sense. •Invisibility: One of the gadgets on Terry's wheel is a toggle switch for invisibility. It's not a one-and-done kind of use like a smoke pellet though; there's an invisibility meter that slowly drains. You can turn the invisibility on and off at any time, but when it's on, it drains the meter, and when it's off the meter starts to regenerate. If you drain the meter, the invincibility shorts out and alerts nearby enemies to your presence. •Glide boost: Holding triangle while gliding activates Terry's jump boots/thrusters and he's rocketed through the skyline. Can be upgraded to last longer and go faster, essentially turning you into a human rocket. When used in correlation with the gliding takedown, grapnel takedown or shockwave attack, it can take out multiple enemies at once. •Grate takedowns: Terry can reach out and pull an enemy into a grate, taking them out. But from that point on, that entrance/exit from the grate cannot be used again in that stealth encounter.    Added a few of my own ideas and elaborated upon your own, hope you don't mind. As of right now Terry is sounding OP as fuck, even more so than Bruce in AK, but that could probably be dealt with through tougher and smarter enemies. I'm thinking maybe some enemies that can shoot up on to gargoyles or crawl through grates just like you can; encountering an enemy in a grate during a stealth section would be scary as HELL haha"
BatmanArkham,3dw5i2,ininja2,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"Your ideas are really good. It would be great if the invisibility replaced the smoke pellets, or if invisibility became the go to defense when under fire. He sounds OP as hell, but he would probably have to fight superpowered opponents head on at some points, and maybe your average predator mission could have like 20 guys with powerful weapons, half of them armored and like 5 hostages to make up for him just being able to take out so many of them easily. People have been throwing around using the nemesis system used in Shadow of mordor in the next game, but considering the rather linear storylines these games usually take, I doubt this will happen."

BatmanArkham,3dv559,Shadow_Riptor,30,Sun Jul 19 21:23:47 2015 UTC,Harley's pregnancy was a false positive.
BatmanArkham,3dv559,The5Virtues,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:26:02 2015 UTC,I always assumed that--rather than a false positive--she lost the baby due to the stress when Joker died; not uncommon for high stress to result in complications during gestation.

BatmanArkham,3dv559,darkpgr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:09:43 2015 UTC,"Not true. They are fairly rare (<3%, assuming the person followed all the instructions AND read the result within the specified time frame) but they happen.  Also we are assuming Harley was able to follow the instructions of the test in the first place... human error can make a false positive more likely."
BatmanArkham,3dv559,corvus_sapiens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:48:55 2015 UTC,"They are fairly rare, but false positives are always either miscarriages or chemical imbalances (which would show up on all pregnancy tests).

BatmanArkham,3dv559,Jalaguy,15,Tue Jul 21 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"This was covered in the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC.

BatmanArkham,3dv559,Pugs_are_great,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:03 2015 UTC,no it was false positive. there are negative tests all over the floor in the harley revenge dlc
BatmanArkham,3dv559,NeoDammarung,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:41 2015 UTC,Which occurs after that scene in AC. His point is still valid.
BatmanArkham,3dv559,Pugs_are_great,2,Mon Jul 20 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"Rocksteady confirmed ""false positive"" not miscarriage.   They even added some text on the box in the DLC that says something like May give false positive."
BatmanArkham,3dv559,corvus_sapiens,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:40:39 2015 UTC,Rocksteady had to confirm because they made a mistake with the science. False positives don't exist like that with pregnancy tests. You only get false negatives with pregnancy tests. False positives either indicate chemical pregnancies (early miscarriage) or some hormonal imbalance that doesn't just go away once.
BatmanArkham,3dv559,HaouLeo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:08:16 2015 UTC,It's not impossible to consider she has some hormonal imbalance

BatmanArkham,3dv559,corvus_sapiens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:50:47 2015 UTC,"That's how false negatives arise, not false positives (when the indicator is either a plus or minus). It's like saying that a faulty or broken computer will download a program on its own."

BatmanArkham,3dwda9,SillyNonsense,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:08 2015 UTC,We couldn't free roam in Blackgate though. Implying its somewhere a bit away from where Origins spanded
BatmanArkham,3dwda9,SillyNonsense,7,Mon Jul 20 02:21:12 2015 UTC,"I read conflicting things about it. It's shown to be an island somewhere in the bay but then again the game refers to it as being on the mainland and being converted into a shopping mall later on.  So I don't know. It must have moved locations at some point. Either way, it was somewhere in the general area of South/New Gotham.  I made a map of the Arkham series Gotham today and while it doesnt include Blackgate (because it's too ambiguous) you can see the general area I'm talking about. Best guess is that at one point it was on the land just southwest of South Gotham.  http://i.imgur.com/4z6kYbm.png  It's based on how Arkham Knight portrays these areas and therefore there are inconsistencies with how they were portrayed in earlier games. Most notably the angle of Arkham City and how it relates to South. Knight has it at an angle with the bridges leading away from it at different locations than before."

BatmanArkham,3duw81,explosive_toast,9,Sun Jul 19 21:28:42 2015 UTC,Jason listens to emo/hardcore cause we all know how angsty/whiney he can be sometimes. I can also imagine Joker listening to ICP because after all...he's an insane clown.
BatmanArkham,3duw81,Thelightbeamrider,6,Sun Jul 19 22:30:50 2015 UTC,I imagine Jason Todd listening to Metalcore and Emo music now oh god
BatmanArkham,3duw81,Moe_Strife,16,Sun Jul 19 22:56:24 2015 UTC,Pyg listens to his own singing
BatmanArkham,3duw81,grntplmr,9,Sun Jul 19 19:39:51 2015 UTC,Joker seems to be a huge music buff in this series. He actually sings in all games besides Asylum. So he probably listens to everything
BatmanArkham,3duw81,NightwingIvI,7,Sun Jul 19 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"In my head the Arkhamverse is stuck in that ""timeless"" TAS era, so I don't imagine them having pop music or anything beyond the 40s. I know it's a vastly technical world, but the fantastical nature of it ungrounds it from our world and music history for me."
BatmanArkham,3duw81,GreekHole,6,Sun Jul 19 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"The Pyg listens to opera music. Creative, I know."
BatmanArkham,3duw81,Fallout22,6,Sun Jul 19 23:14:00 2015 UTC,I'm just gonna assume Nightwing listens to Nightcore from time to time.

BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,TheMeatyOreo,19,Sun Jul 19 09:19:26 2015 UTC,What about Clayface looking like Talia? Mocking Batman for not being able to save her.
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,PrinceCheddar,8,Sun Jul 19 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"When the Joker was leaked I wanted it to be Clayface, driven mad by the Lazarus put and thinking he was Joker."
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,NeoDammarung,3,Sun Jul 19 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"That would be great. Like, at some point during the game, you overhear different thugs talking about the Joker being back, so Batman decides to investigate.

BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,Autumn_Twin,13,Sun Jul 19 12:25:22 2015 UTC,"Minor Arkham City Spoilers:  Sadly, he was supposedly murdered by The Penguin because of smuggling inside Arkham City. He was seen being dragged inside the museum and never seen again. This happened prior to the Arkham City incident. :/  Edit: The bio mentions that he was fed to rats and had his arms eaten or something but he managed to escape and hasn't been heard from since."

BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,skolasa,5,Sun Jul 19 15:19:49 2015 UTC,At this point in the series he'd only be somewhere around 5 to 10 years old. Although it's kinda funny imagining a 4 foot angry kid commanding an army trying to kill Batman.

BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,_Comic_,9,Sun Jul 19 21:28:30 2015 UTC,Huntress. But I have no idea how she'd fit into the storyline. In canon she's fighting crime in the refugee camps.
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,Tonkarz,4,Sun Jul 19 12:07:13 2015 UTC,"Music Meister, voiced by NPH of course. It would have been cool if he had sort of a trippy sequence kind of like Mad Hatter's. The main problem I can see is how you had to listen for most of the other side missions in Knight, but if you were to listen for him, he would take control of you."

BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,sd173,14,Sun Jul 19 14:46:50 2015 UTC,Same. The way they left him in city implyed him being involved in this one. Especially he could have into scarecrows plan as scarecrow probably would want revenge for the mauling.
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,tjj7,5,Sun Jul 19 14:55:34 2015 UTC,He's in the DLC
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,CharioteerVacuole,10,Sun Jul 19 17:28:33 2015 UTC,I mean you technically did see him and he's the most likely in the DLC

BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,Carsonlt,4,Sun Jul 19 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"He's suspected to be in DLC because of files found in the game.  For people that want the DLC's to be a surprise, stay away. But in the DLC sticky at the top of the subreddit it goes into why it's expected, plus the other DLC's expected to be released including character skins and challenge maps.  It's of course not confirmed until it's annouced. But it's weird for those files names to be included.  Here's a screen shot of the files. Spoilers for expected characters to show up in DLC. There's no story spoilers, but some people might want characters to be a surprise. Though the characters will probably be shown in advertising for the DLC if it's annouced. I'm most excited for DLC6."
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,Dark_Knight_Reddits,3,Sun Jul 19 22:12:32 2015 UTC,Mr Freeze.
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,edwart_,3,Sun Jul 19 14:34:35 2015 UTC,NOt for AK..but for the future of the Arkhamverse....Damian Wayne!!
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,superfreakonomicsfan,6,Sun Jul 19 23:12:22 2015 UTC,Green Arrow
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,RexxVortexx,2,Sun Jul 19 12:45:21 2015 UTC,Clock King. Especially how AA and AC were full of throwbacks to TAS. Always thought he was a pretty cool villain. Could've been incorporated into time trials in the batmobile/Gliding challenges to keep Batman 'On time'.
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,SquilliumFancyson,2,Sun Jul 19 18:23:41 2015 UTC,Amanda Waller. In Batman Beyond Terry is a clone of bruce Wayne in the cartoon or comics made by Amanda Waller to replace Batman. I think having the Arkham Knight be the first clone of bruce made by Amanda Waller to be a replacement for batman would have been badass and it would explain all the military drone shit too and the ending where Bruce fakes his death at the end could have been a perfect set up to a Beyond Arkham game.
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,Crankmon,2,Sun Jul 19 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"If Assault on Arkham is canon (Though it's debatable if it is, never gets mentioned once in AK) then Deadshot killed Waller before Asylum.  Beyond Arkham would be a great title for a Batman Beyond game though."
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,TheClonesLegacy,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:01 2015 UTC,Definitely Talon and the Court of Owls. Although the Heir to the Cowl side mission had me thinking Damien Wayne was going to be involved
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,Arktos22,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"A Batwoman mission could've been cool. The easter egg was nice, though."
BatmanArkham,3dtk5h,mrglow,2,Sun Jul 19 22:24:54 2015 UTC,Superman. A fear gas or Poison Ivy influenced Superman that you get to kick the sunlight out of would have rocked

BatmanArkham,3duaw9,bshively,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:21:33 2015 UTC,"I play in the Xbox One, so I don't have the 60s suit and Batmobile yet; however, I'm assuming that they'll go the route of a legit 60s Batmobile instead of the glorified paint job the present 60s Batmobile is."

Therefore, the newspaper in the flashback merely indicates that the flashback takes place after the DLC, but we knew that.  The chat window is Huntress for sure. That's the Birds of Prey symbol in the background, and H's reply is in character. Also note that there are three avatars in the chat window. There's Oracle's and Huntress' and the third one is some kind of... Black Canary. You can actually access that area from very early in the game through the windows."

BatmanArkham,3dvv8y,izzyv1990,0,Sun Jul 19 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"but does he go too far at times? Bat rims maybe go with your point but why call the computer the batcomputer? Batarangs and any other combat device, very understandable fair enough. Why name them the batwing and batmobile if they are never going to be mentioned to criminals? I'm guessing he's limiting his options on equipment if most of it has to be bat related and I doubt Bruce Wayne would spend the extra money to make specialised equipment for Batman."

He clearly has the strenght to simply run up the wall like he was running on the ground. it's all about making it interesting for us, the batnames are so we get attached to them. Batman could have hundreds of cars and they wouldn't matter to us, but oh the batmobile, that one is important, it has a NAME!  tbh it's not supposed to make sense, just play along with it."

BatmanArkham,3dvv8y,2Scribble,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"Well lets think about it for a second - up until the Dark Knight movies EVERYTHING has either followed the Bat theme or had the word 'Bat' in it. It's part of what defines the series and makes fans either fist-bump or cheer.  Christopher Nolan-verse man on the other hand... not so much. We got a tank and a big jet... no real names for them... unless you call the Tank the Tumblr and the big jet the Twitter :P   Fans debate to this DAY which is better. And despite what each side will tell you BOTH sides are quite large and - most importantly - quite divided. If a trope is good and makes you smile should it be used? Is it bad to go over the top? In comics and video games is there any such thing AS over the top?   Even before Christopher Nolan-man writers tried to tone down the 'bat' by giving Batman different names 'I am Vengeance. I am the Night' 'The Dark Knight' etc - those are eponymous, surely, but you really couldn't see Vengeance-rangs or Night-Rims or Dark Computers could you? As cool as the tank was in the Dark Knight movies it was just a tank (as we saw later in the series, one of many) and the jet was just a jet. There was no real 'tie' to them - they were just equipment.   Maybe this is something that is more down to the fans - to what they want to hear and see - than anything relating to Bruce Wayne or Batman or the Twitter or the Tumblr. Maybe it's what people have come to expect - or maybe it just sounds good... or maybe, scarily enough, we're just over-thinking the whole thing lol"

That's a pretty horrible thought really.

BatmanArkham,3ds1rp,DragonballSuper,4,Sat Jul 18 22:33:21 2015 UTC,I think i heard a while back that it was addressed/mentioned in the Arkham Knight Prequal Comics. Idk fo'sho'tho'
BatmanArkham,3ds1rp,tivilon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:56:54 2015 UTC,I don't think the world's greatest detective could deduce this mystery.
BatmanArkham,3ds1rp,DragonballSuper,4,Sun Jul 19 00:37:05 2015 UTC,"Also Batman knocked Clayface into the pit,so if he is dead why does he not care?It is clearly shown that indirectly killing the Joke upset him but if he directly killed Clayface why would he not care?"
BatmanArkham,3ds1rp,EliParker,3,Sun Jul 19 05:26:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could argue Batman's no killing rule only applies to humans, which Clayface isn't much of anymore."
BatmanArkham,3ds1rp,Arya_Queen,2,Sun Jul 19 05:40:24 2015 UTC,"Well then Batman is an asshole.Clayface has the mind of a human,the thoughts of a human,the feelings of a human.The only thing he does not have is the looks,also we see Clayface locked up in Arkham Asylum which means he purposely went out of his way to NOT kill him."
BatmanArkham,3ds1rp,-Poison_Ivy-,2,Sun Jul 19 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"For me Clayface became human and looks like what Joker did before he become the Joker. Also he is living life in Gotham, looking at the exploits of Batman."

What if a character free roam pack comes out as dlc, will the other mod that's on this sub be considered piracy? The reason it's only supposed to be for season pass owners is because we will be getting all of this anyway. We already paid for it, just using it early until the refined version drops."

It has the batman beyond, Zur En Arrh, Dark knight returns, and new 52 batman skins. It also comes with the playable character mod where you cycle from F1-F11 to switch characters. F11 is batman for reference, and anytime you switch you need to go to the pause screen and do a restart for enemies to show again. It has no further content then what I listed."

BatmanArkham,3ds63t,liquidgelcaps,4,Sat Jul 18 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"My rule is that it goes opposite to the direction you're facing.   So if you're facing east and call the batmobile, when Batman jumps in, the batmobile will spin and face west."
BatmanArkham,3ds63t,XMenOrangesTangerine,3,Sat Jul 18 23:44:09 2015 UTC,"What I've found is that is swerves the direction batman's facing.  Eg: if you were facing the way the batmobile was coming from, it would pull a 180 so you can drive in that direction without turning.  The problem with this mechanics is that there's an auto camera when you call the batmobile, which defeats the purpose."

BatmanArkham,3drnsa,YoureanA1nutcasejack,2,Sat Jul 18 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"I would like to switch between the main 5 characters in a couple of open world's.  It would give you quite a bit of gameplay variations because Superman could be mostly aerial fights,  Batman is the stealth portion, Green Lantern could do puzzles with his ring, Wonder Woman can be the hand to hand cimbat portion and Flash could be a ground level fighter and deal with fast opponents.  Well all of them should be involved in combat but they have specialities.   It would never actually happen I doubt but if it did I would be the happiest fanboy alive!  (I would love Shazam and the rest of the DCU but there really isn't enough room for them unless they are just cameos or something)  Also I'd prefer a solo game without multiplayer."
BatmanArkham,3drnsa,DrunkSolidSnake,2,Sat Jul 18 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think that everyone should have abilities according to who they are and their powers, but they should all also have the basic ability for hand to hand combat and stealth. Also, you wouldn't like if the game was either single player or multiplayer ? As in, you can choose whether or not you wanna do single or multiplayer ?"
BatmanArkham,3drnsa,DrunkSolidSnake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"Oh I meant that they should all have combat like that. And WW would fight with sword and shield which could be great if Darksied is the main villain and creating Anti Life monsters and what not.   Also I wouldn't have Green Arrow despite loving him because he isn't really a major leaguer.  To me the JL is Batman, Superman,  Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Flash with Martian Manhunter as their ""Oracle""."
BatmanArkham,3drnsa,DrunkSolidSnake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:42:51 2015 UTC,I think multiplayer would affect the story too much.  To me there would need to be missions that NEED only Batman or something and if it were multiplayer the other players would have to wait until that section is done.  I don't like that but if it were something like certain missions were multiplayer then I wouldn't mind that at all.
BatmanArkham,3drnsa,DrunkSolidSnake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:47:38 2015 UTC,I'd also really like seeing Firestorm in the game since he is my favorite DC hero but that is never going to happen...

BatmanArkham,3dqgid,bazookaporcupine,4,Sat Jul 18 18:57:29 2015 UTC,Shadow of Mordor is dope and is actually an extremely good PC port (because monolith did it themselves instead of outsourcing it)

BatmanArkham,3dqgid,The5Virtues,3,Sat Jul 18 20:56:50 2015 UTC,You'll have fun with it.  I got about half way through the game before I totally lost interest.  So I mean... it's alright.

BatmanArkham,3dqgid,corvus_sapiens,0,Sat Jul 18 15:46:20 2015 UTC,I dont believe that WB will give away a game for free. Ubisoft launched the free game page a week before Christmas so If Im correct the game was out for like a month and you could redeem your game. I believe that they said that they screwed up two weeks after release. WB is quiet as calm water so I dont believe in anything for free.
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,Mikesapien,9,Sat Jul 18 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"I thought about them doing this too. Makes more sense then all of the events happening in one night, like the games"
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,SolarCity47,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:33:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The Arkham games are... cluttered.  You mean to tell me Gotham is under full-scale military occupation, and Batman somehow has time to be solving dumb ridlles, stopping multiple bank robberies, taking down some mutant bat creature, tracking down a serial killer, tracking down a serial arsonist, saving a whole fire department one fireman at a time, and testing a possible new Batman candidate, all before breakfast?  How do the villains not get in each other's way? I'm incredulous that it's all one night when it takes 60-something hours to complete the game."
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,RandomMandalorian,16,Mon Jul 20 09:04:18 2015 UTC,"Like a Batman Telltale game, but less point-and-click, and more Batman?

BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,zsxdflip,2,Sat Jul 18 15:46:06 2015 UTC,You're done with Arkham games in a week? Really? It took me months to 100% Arkham City. I'm still working on finishing Arkham Origins.

That doesn't mean I put it down and never play it again, I've played the main story  and ng+, main story again and am now on ng+ again.

BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,TheJoshider10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that I like episodic stuff in general, it's that an episodic format would be more suited to the Batman mythos.

I've heard good things."
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,hypareal,5,Tue Jul 21 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"Eh, honestly i'd just be fine with another WB Montreal released Batman game. They could keep the exact same gameplay as Arkham Knight except remove the Batmobile and to me it's already a better game. The story of Origins is probably the best in the franchise so I have no worries that another WB Montreal made Batman game would be both engaging cinematically and enjoyable without the inclusion of the Batmobile.   Really hoping Origins comes to PS+ so I can platinum it."
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,YoureanA1nutcasejack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Two questions:   What's wrong with the Batmobile? What makes Origins ""the best in the franchise?"""
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,izzyv1990,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:05:49 2015 UTC,"Everything to do with it's placement in the story. Rocksteady neglected their Batman simulation in favour of Being the Batmobile, with generic tank gameplay that doesn't progress or change throughout and is only there to be like ""look guys, we have a new feature!!!"". The narrative is based around the Batmobile including many set pieces when really the Batmobile should be strictly a vehicle used to compliment the gameplay and the new open world of Gotham. By forcing a tank down our throats every mission it ruined all replayability to me and honestly it ruined the game for me. Traded it in after 3 days because I completed everything I wanted with the game and Rocksteady's incapability with storytelling and level design led to me trading it for The Witcher 3. I said the story, not the game. I think Asylum is the best overall but the story of Origins had nice depth to it. It worked as a good early story for Batman with a solid Bruce-Alfred story and a incredibly well done Batman-Joker origin. I really, really liked their reasoning for Joker's obsession and it was great to see it unfold on screen. In other words, it had the most depth. Asylum's was simple but strong, City's was a mess with too many overlapping narratives and Knight fixed the overlapping issues but ultimately Rocksteady were useless at writing their own story so instead they rehashed a common story and played it off as new, with an ending that stupidly screams ""look guys our franchise has ended!!! so emotional!!!"" instead of just ending it as a solid Batman story without the finality, this way it'd be easier for WB Montreal to continue the series outside of prequels. I'd still be up for a sequel that clears up the mess Rocksteady ended the game on.   It was a 10/10 gameplay experience whenever I was out of the Batmobile, then it became a 7/10 and then ultimately with such a disappointing story with so many issues overall it was just a simple 7/10 game. Major, major issues and it's shocking Rocksteady made some of these mistakes."

BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,_LilSebastian_,3,Mon Jul 20 09:15:18 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that a franchise that has made over 700 million dollars is just gonna disappear because rocksteady doesn't wanna continue ? These games are gonna keep popping up until they have NO fan base anymore. Or, at least too little fans too keep making games. That's just what happens with game franchises. Especially when they are partly owned by money hungry companies like WB. Did you know that the ONLY reason arkham origins was created, was because WB told rocksteady that they can't wait any longer for another game, because they wanted more money ? With a company like that, there's just no way they're letting this go. The franchise is a gold mine."

I love Batman as much as the next guy but a yearly franchise just isn't good for anything. A few years between games makes it more exciting to grab them. I could hardly contain the excitement for Arkham Knight. As long as they don't milk it to death with yearly releases, it would be totally fine, I think."
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,VampireOfLeningrad,2,Sat Jul 18 23:23:47 2015 UTC,"I think the joke flew right over your head bud. It wasn't about release dates or amount of games. It was about game quality and story commitment. The Assassin's games, post desmond saga, have nearly completely failed to capture what it was that the original set of games did to draw in its fanbase. And while the fanbase may be large in general, the attention to the games has been dropping steadily since the end of the Desmond story. Assassin's creed is no longer as good as it used to be, and is steadily becoming less and less enjoyable. Maybe not for its mechanics or style, but for its lack of commitment to its own established universe. And has since become a very badly attacked game series. Almost up there with CoD in terms of fanbase hatred. Its sad really. So my point was: You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Literally.  It takes a lot of care and consideration to make a constant series, and if you don't take that into account, you end up with a failure as big as AC, and a desperate lineup of titles that aim to try and reclaim that old glory the games originally had."
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,Imacleverboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"No I got what you were saying. What I'm saying is their lack of commitment and story comes from just pumping out Assassin's Creed games just for the sake of making a new one. People feel the way they do about those franchises because, regardless of whether there's any substance to the games, they'll be out every October/November. I was saying as long as they don't release a Batman game with no story that just features gliding around and beating people up every year, it won't get to that point."

BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,HotBreadKitchen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:20 2015 UTC,"I think narratively Arkham will conclude. There's only so many ways the story can ostensibly include the word ""Arkham."" It's as much a plot point as it is a brand, and future plots are going to have to eschew Arkham. It's getting old.  However, the game series will definitely continue, just not under the ""Arkham"" banner. They'll probably be called something else."
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,HotBreadKitchen,2,Mon Jul 20 09:10:18 2015 UTC,"exactly what i thought. What could they really call the next one ? ""Batman: arkham number five"" ?"
BatmanArkham,3dqd3b,BiggDope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:08:06 2015 UTC,Doing it as much as they have has already oversold how significant Arkham really is to the mythos. Most things Batman have nothing to do with Arkham.

The ups made the downs worse for them. And I agree with them up and down the line. Except for the dumbed down combat, I actually kind of appreciated that.   I got used to tank combat but it was boring and samey (it becomes fun again for a little while when you gain the ability to hack the drones).   The one thing I'd add is, as someone who played the entire Arkham series on keyboard and mouse, I discovered late in my playthrough that Pursuit mode is much easier on an XBox Controller than keyboard and mouse.   I spent a good couple of hours on the last set of Riddler tracks with Keyboard and Mouse, having spent the whole game learning to control the Batmobile that way. Then I switched to my XBox 360 Controller and beat the tracks in less than ten minutes, basically the time it took me to get acquainted with the controls. I'm going to keep my controller handy for future playthroughs."

If Starro is the main threat, then you would play through as Batman but having to defeat the superpowered members being controlled by Starro.   Seems like we'd get those boss fights people love that you'd have to adapt to. Unless, ""I can't inflict any damage to Superman, but maybe if I use the Batmobile's 60mm cannon!"". Although I can see that happening. Along with, catching/chasing Flash in a Batmobile race.  Maybe Martian Manhunter's fight would be similar to Mr. Freeze's from City. Explosive gel takedown, so he begins phasing through walls instead etc"
BatmanArkham,3dr3xc,TY2J,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:23 2015 UTC,This could also be related to the rumored Silver Age DC game they were talking about. Maybe this Justice League Game is that game.

BatmanArkham,3dqabx,seanmac46,7,Sun Jul 19 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"Green Lantern could work well. Just replace gadgets with constructs and gliding with flying. The Lanterns are space police, so the detective side missions could transfer over well too. The difficulty would be the setting, as we are used to the open world. The only solution I can think of would be groups of smaller open world hubs, such as the lantern homeworlds, akin to Arkham Asylum/Batgirl DLC. I don't know if there is enough things on each planet to warrant a large open world."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,lukario,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the constructs can be literally anything, as long as the ring bearer can master the emotion of the ring that they're wearing. Say that there's a wall blocking your path, so you use your screwdriver construct to open the sewer grate to bypass said wall. ""Realistically"", you could have a drill construct, a C4 construct, a tank construct , etc to destroy the wall, but due to constructs being predetermined, it ruins the freedom that comes with a lantern ring. The only way you could account for majority of the possibilities would be to have a Scribblenauts style library of constructs, and at that point you might as well play Scribblenauts."

BatmanArkham,3dqabx,Gef210,2,Sat Jul 18 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"The best way I can think of for making a superman game is implement his new ""solar flare"" power. It's recently introduced move that expels all his solar energy from his cells into one attack that leaves him normal for a few days afterwards.   The opening of the game would be a big fight with Doomsday or something. We get to play as fully powered superman as a taste briefly. He uses this move to finish off Doomsday and loses all of his powers. The rest of the game you progress as a slightly stronger human who levels up throughout the day (game) either from experience or picking up ""solar"" or some other in game currency. Getting more of his trademark powers as you go along the game.  By the end of the game you're pretty close to being the man of steel again and normal thugs and enemies you've fought before are cake to finish but start taking hostages or whatever other gameplay mechanics to keep it challenging. Or start adding in other kryponians in the last arc."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,imjustbettr,3,Sat Jul 18 17:03:26 2015 UTC,How I always imagined a Super Man game working is having it take place during an alien invasion by Zod. That way all of your enemies having been kyrptonians or robots designed to fight kryptonians you wouldn't be super overpowered against them. Plus it would be fun to have to chase down and destroy giant alien gunships and stuff as well.
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,sinces,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:35 2015 UTC,Kryptonians didn't really know they would be overpowered on earth so they wouldn't program their robots to fight super powered individuals.   De powering superman would make the game bearable however it would get old real quick towards the end when you get your powers back and everyone is still a regular joe.   After that the game would transform into a bunch of escort mission and shit like that which would make it unbearable.
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,Gef210,8,Sat Jul 18 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"I know it'd be kind of overkill to keep it in the Batfamily but I think a solo Nightwing game would be pretty cool.

BatmanArkham,3dqabx,JamesD-TV,2,Sat Jul 18 15:03:56 2015 UTC,"If Flash was in a game there would have to be a charging up factor to his running, or else if your losing a fight you can just run away.

The big idea I had a while back is an Animal Man game set in an area with tons of animals around, like the Savanna or something. And you have a radar kind of like Detective Vision that lets you see all animals within a certain distance and harness choice powers from a few of them. Like you could have a motion power, a transforming power, and a passive stat all at once.    Say you're fighting some poachers and extend out your radar. You pick up a crane, an elephant, and a lion. You get the crane's motion power of flight, the elephants passive stat of increased weight, and the lion's transformation of claws. Then you go to town with a fucking crazy fast, heavy-hitting aerial slash attack."

Combat system that is in batman would be awesome (think about those crazy dashes to enemies that look impossible to do i that short time). Just one thing: flash may not have super strength but when he runs his attacks are crazy (super sonic punch baby!). The potential on boss battles is huge just look at this, my favourite scene Still if they would do something like the very beginning (right after obtaining his powers) and by that we could nerf him to the ground... Still can't imagine Flash game without A LOT of slow mo (like everything slows down and you move like normal).  Atom would be impossibly awesome. Imagine you could shrink in the game (would have to share villains with others heroes I guess though). Arrow makes most sense. Saw the red hood dlc and combat system  still worked even though he had guns. In CW tv show Arrow fights a lot in melee and it looks awesome. Batman had gadgets = arrow can have gadgets and different arrows. The only thing is how they could handle the movement in the city.   Edit: When I think about it more - why play as the hero? It would be so cool to play as the bad guy for a change.   Edit 2: Firestorm = can do so much with his powers and exploration and movement can be handled just by flying. And think about those conversations with two guys in one body :)   Superman in problably discussed becouse... he could sell the game. Other super heroes might not be as known as Batman. No matter who fits the best money will be the factor that really matters."

Thugs with freeze guns or military zones with speed force disruptors.  To handle speed I'd want two controls, I'll base it on PC but it could be adapted to controller.  Scroll wheel sets your velocity. Shift+Scroll sets time speed. Also a button to quickly change time speed.  So you can set speed to Max and time to slow to do the OP beat everyone in a second, or if you're just travelling the city bring time back to normal so you can zoom about.

She's got an excellent pool of villains to draw from (though most people don't seem to be aware that she has a rogue's gallery at all) and there are some magnificent stories to be told with a character that can bridge the gap between Greecian epics and modern super heroics.   I'd also love to see a Superman game. It's a tricky prospect but if it can be done I'd love it.   OH! Or a Wonder Woman game, I'd love that, I think there's alot of opportunity for a good WW game! If they can get the right team and the right writer (Brian Azzarello would be an excellent choice) I'm sure they could do something great with her.   The Flash would be a great choice to, it would require some innovations but I think a game with a sort of free flowing movement like Mirror's Edge, combat with chaotic pinballing combat like a hyped up version of the Arkham combat would be amazing.

BatmanArkham,3dqabx,BloloLO,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"A technical brawler Wonder Woman game would be cool.   Combat would be Devil May Cry/Bayonetta/God of War only more accessible (i.e. simpler). But perhaps it'd have a counter button like the Arkham games as well. But countering wouldn't disrupt a combo you are in the middle of. Once the counter is finished, you can go right back to the combo chain you were in.  It'd be set on Themyscira when demons from Hades invade. You'd have to rally the amazons, take back Themyscira, and journey into the underworld and put down Hades and Aries (obviously you'd play as WW).   I'm sure we all remember our WW lore in that Themyscira is sitting on top of a bunch of portals to the underworld, and every couple of decades the underworld tries to invade only to be crushed by the amazons (this is why the amazons are all warriors) - or sometimes a random single hellbeast will find a new portal and escape, only to be hunted down by the amazons.  The game would add the concept of amazon fortresses established in hell to keep an eye on the demon population. This is to make Themyscira a bit more interesting. So even if the amazons themselves mostly get along with each other, there can still be small skirmishes with the undead or with demons and so on.  So there'd be a bit of exploration, and you'd be able to collect stuff to power up WW's abilities. Stuff like her lasso, throwing tiara, summon-able dual swords, shield, bracers-off mode, Aegisfire (IIRC) and so on would all be collectable. Maybe they get stolen in the initial part of the game, or perhaps in this game's canon she is gaining some of them for the first time. Maybe there'd be ambrosia or something hidden around that increases WW's max health. I'm thinking sort of Metroid-esque power-up collection.  The other option is an Arkham style game featuring the Birds of Prey. Oracle, Black Canary and Huntress. And maybe others. Both BC and H would be playable.   Huntress would play a lot like Batman, but there'd be a much wider range of improvised environmental weapons. In the BoP series, there almost isn't a fight where Huntress didn't use an environmental weapon of some kind. Predator mode would have Huntress being able to run silently and face off against enemy types who also sneak around. You'd have to out-sneak them (how this would work exactly is hard to say)."

As game goes on you can buy upgrades like gliding after jumping so it's like you are flying. Then eventually you can unlock full flight and all that.  Take some ques from the current Superman comic where he uses his new found explosion powers at the beginning for some reason and slowly regains everything throughout the story.
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,CapThanh,0,Sun Jul 19 13:07:08 2015 UTC,"Not DC, but I would like to see a Spartan game."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,00zach00,0,Sat Jul 18 16:39:49 2015 UTC,"I would focus on a character that has absolutely no superpowers at all or one that is weaker for example...  Superman cant be good... Superman has only 1 weakness and I feel like that can make the game more limited if that makes sense...  Examples of Games that would not be as good as the Batman Games:  Wonder Woman  Super Man   Flash  Each of these have power that is too strong to have a game like this... Superman is basically gonna win every time unless kryptonite is involved.  Green Arrow is Rocksteady's best option. Not only does he relate to batman in many ways, including lack of powers and the fact that he is also a billionaire, but I feel like Rocksteady's specialty is building off of a regular old guy (Example: Batman in Arkham Origins. He is unknown at first but then makes a name for himself as the hero Gotham deserves) and turning him into something more than that... The only other example of a DC Character that does not physically have powers right now is The Atom. Also very similar to Batman  considering he uses a suit and gets all of his power of technology and basic human abilities like you and I have."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,Bungles_Danforth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:09:23 2015 UTC,"Superman is weak to magic, too. Also, a lot of the villains in the superman universe have powers that pose a danger to him, ie. Metallica, parasite, Zod. I don't know if I'd like a superman game but I think it'd be doable."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,thuglife2e,0,Sat Jul 18 18:22:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't like a Green Arrow game. It would be a Batman game with the batarangs more intuitive and replaced as arrows, storyline would become really cheesy, and would just piss me of the didn't make another Batman game. I don't think a free roam game would for anyone else but another style definitely would. That way you can control the enemies and superman's power level distinctly through levels."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,izzyv1990,0,Sat Jul 18 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"Give me a superman title. It could work. Trust me. Thugs in Metropolis pumped with super suits and kryptonite weapons courtesy of Luthor? Yes. Supervillains running amuck and generally causing havoc and destruction or planning elaborate traps for superman? Yes, Braniac invasion mid-game to really tie it all in? Why not. Continuing titles that take Supes out of the planet to other worlds or to deal with cosmic entities like Darkside? Could totally go for that."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,izzyv1990,2,Sat Jul 18 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"Hey yeah, that actually does sound really good. You could have a deal where, similar to Arkham knight, an army invades (that would probably be run by Lex) all in super suits, that works. And if Brainiac invaded mid-game that would be cool too."
BatmanArkham,3dqabx,IDRINKYOURMILK-SHAKE,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"People always treat supes like he's indestructible and his weaknesses are hard to come by. But the fact of the matter is: no, they're really not. And people who are at his level of strength often deal him just as much damage as his weaknesses can, such as darkside or braniac."

BatmanArkham,3dqjf3,TY2J,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:50:10 2015 UTC,Original release date was actually in October 2014. I don't think they ever put an actual date to it. But when it was annouced the plan was October like Arkham City and Origins before it.

BatmanArkham,3dqjf3,BruceofSteel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"With the game being set on Halloween it might be worth looking at dates from the Long Halloween as potential Easter Egg days.  From the top of my head there is: Halloween Thanksgiving Christmas New Years Little Xmas (Jan 6th) Groundhog Day (mentioned by calendar man, he mentions a few others but I can't quite recall) Valentines St Patricks April Fools Mothers day Fathers day Independence Day Labor Day August 2nd (Falcones b'day)"
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,BarnumFly,33,Sat Jul 18 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"The Joker's a mystery because his past is unknown and the finer details of his psyche are impenetrable, there's no way of knowing 100% what he'll do. But part of what's scary about the Joker for Batman is that he does understand the Joker more than anyone else can. The Joker's biggest fear, however, doesn't really require a literal mind-reading device to understand, because it's really pretty obvious when you look at how the Joker views himself. He's a showman who holds the solipsistic belief that he and Batman are the only people who really matter at all, that they're representative of the primal forces that govern the world and everyone else is just background noise. So of course that'd be his biggest fear, an ""artist"" who believes they're furthering some insightful philosophy would utterly hate the prospect of making no long-term mark on the world."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,BeTheGuy2,10,Sat Jul 18 14:54:49 2015 UTC,"This is a great answer.  I would just add that it's not that Joker is literally inside of Batman's head, but that Batman's psyche has created a very realistic manifestation of the Joker as a split personality.  We can assume with a high degree of certainty that this manifestation is an accurate representation of the Joker because A) Batman has his titan-infused blood in his system, which is causing him to develop similar aspects of Joker's deranged persona, and B) As stated above, after all these years Batman probably knows more about the Joker than perhaps anyone else in the Arkham-verse. When we combine all this with the fear toxin, we suddenly have a very realistic analog of the Joker attempting to take over Batman's psyche.    Therefore, if Batman believes that he knows what the Joker's true fear really is, than he is already correct, since this Joker is technically just a product of Batman's mind."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,lancejammer,7,Sat Jul 18 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Well if we assume Batman fully became Joker (during the time we play as him), then Batman would know Joker's fear because he is Joker. Then the tiny bit of Batman came back and used that fear against Joker and defeated him. I'd love to see the real life version where it's just some blood cells fighting to the death."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,RandomMandalorian,7,Sat Jul 18 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"Is it the real Joker. No, it's not some creation of Batman. It's a bit of the the actual Joker.  You don't think the old infected man was just imagining the Joker's deception and cunning, do you?"
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,ARTIFICIAL_SAPIENCE,5,Sat Jul 18 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"it IS Joker. They mention that a few times in the story. The people who are 'infected' are becoming Joker. The last part with Scarecrow, had Batman not came back then it would have been Joker in Batman's body.  Does it make the most sense. No but it's a comic book story"
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,batmanhill6157,4,Sat Jul 18 16:12:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as goofy as the science is, the blood apparently does give people a literal duplicate of the Joker's psyche. I mean, it's not like the other four victims would have any personal experience with the Joker to base the personality traits they acquired on."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,Jalaguy,3,Sat Jul 18 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"To add to that, the old man joker recognizes Harley, indicating he's a copy and not a projection of the joker."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,Thistlemanizzle,2,Sat Jul 18 17:21:51 2015 UTC,Maybe that's not really Joker's real fear. Maybe that is the fear that Bruce projects on him. He is only defeating him in his mind so he is giving himself a way to defeat him.
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,DALinProgress,2,Sat Jul 18 17:13:27 2015 UTC,"The explanation is that this Joker is not just a figment of Bruce's imagination. It's not just Batman's fears personified.  Batman's brain is literally turning into the Joker's brain. That is actually the Joker.  Or a... clone of him, anyway."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,Tonkarz,2,Sat Jul 18 18:04:27 2015 UTC,"you're making your own contradictory assumptions so of course they contradict.  you're first assuming that hallucination Joker isn't 'really' Joker in any meaningful way.  then you're assuming that being forgotten is somehow the fear of real Joker and not of hallucination Joker.  neither of those assumptions is necessarily true, and in fact this contradiction is good evidence that at least one of them is wrong.  for example, I think ""being forgotten"" is a completely reasonable true fear of a hallucination.  like an imaginary friend, he only exists mentally which means being forgotten is quite literally death."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,LoZfan03,2,Sat Jul 18 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"like an imaginary friend, he only exists mentally which means being forgotten is quite literally death.   Great, you reminded me of Inside Out and now I'm sad."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,greatmuta2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:17:37 2015 UTC,"I doubt the person Joker was before becoming the Joker had the thoughts and fears he had when he did become the joker. The thing is,Jokers blood is corrupted not only from the Titan but from the incident that caused him to become Joker.Whatever was in him to become the deranged psychopath he became was then injected into 5 others and it corrupted them all in their own way.  The fear toxin in Bruce progressed the illness and take over his mind,then he was injected again and his new fear was being forgotten and going back to being his old self and the piece of the old Bruce helped him fight and hold it back...For now,it is however still in him obviously but it's now ""Locked away"" mentally to prevent him becoming a psychopath (Well murderous psychopath)."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,omgdisease,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"I always thought he was becoming the joker. He explains how the disease acts and shows that each of the people that were infected got different parts of joker's personality (eg: Johnny Charisma has Joker's showmanship, and Christina Bell has his obsession with Batman). I just always assumed Batman got the whole deal, all of his personality. If you assume that all the infected had never had contact or really knew a whole lot about him, then how do they become more showy or obsessed?   That's why I assume the disease/infection acts like it takes over or replaces the host's personality, and is more like little Jokers running around in someone's head, thus transforming their personality into Joker's."
BatmanArkham,3dqly9,omgdisease,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Which is also pretty nonsensical. I don't think Rocksteady thought that plot point through very well, suddenly making Joker's blood a parasitic virus that gives you his personality and physical traits. There's suspension of disbelief, and then there's making no sense at all."
