Tallahassee,3dxasq,PennysShy,7,Mon Jul 20 08:27:55 2015 UTC,"Basically the city is in quadrants, with the uni being in the SW.  Every quad has everything you need.  Honestly, SW is not a great part of the city - loads of apartments, loads of undergrads who like to party, lots of petty theft, too.  Traffic is ridiculous, especially in the fall and on game day weekends.  NE is more family friendly, quieter, and feels a million miles away from campus life even though it's only a ten minute drive.  There are a lot of houses for rent all over.  SE is also good.  Here's a map: 1. Lafayette Park area is a beautiful neighborhood within walking and biking distance to a lot of shops in an area called Midtown; might be pricy rentals but worth investigating.  2) Spottswood neighborhood, a little bit hippie, a lot of professionals, more affordable.  3) Indian Head Acres - quiet, family friendly, affordable, very 70s.  4)  Camelot - older people, quiet, lots of houses on the market right now, generic suburb neighborhood.  North of Park Avenue from there is a string of townhome and duplex communities that are always up for rent.  Other neighborhoods to consider - Levy Park, almost immediately north of campus - small 50s houses and a lot of hipsters.  Southwood - feels far away, but it's just a drive down Orange Ave and up Lake Bradford to get to campus, and it's a neighborhood that offers apartments, townhomes, and houses, but it is pricy.  Moving to Tallahassee is weird, because you're gonna find a place and probably immediately wish you lived somewhere else.  So move in with the idea you'll probably move again.  It took me several moves to figure how to settle here.  Your needs will change as you age."
Tallahassee,3dxasq,tercerero,5,Mon Jul 20 13:07:23 2015 UTC,Just to kind of piggy back everyone else it will be hard to be near campus and have all of the other housing arrangements you are looking for. I just moved here a month ago with a similar situation and we settled on the NE side of town North of I-10 (Killearn area) and it feels quite safe and nice. My SO works right off campus and it only takes her 15 minutes to get to work with out taking the interstate.   There are also some nice neighborhoods off of Park (AVE?) that we have thought about buying around after our lease expires.   and Welcome to Tally it is a great city.
Tallahassee,3dxasq,CoffeeAndPomade,3,Mon Jul 20 13:19:30 2015 UTC,I strongly recommend you look into Levy park. It's a quiet area that's as close as you can get to FSU without having to deal with game day traffic and horrible student places. I know a few professors and grad students who live (or have lived there) and they love it. You're also reasonably close to the Northwood/Lake Ella area for shops and the park.  The other plus is that you have the opportunity to save some money on your commute by using the city bus service. As public bus systems go Tallahassee's is nice and clean and the drivers are friendly and helpful.
Tallahassee,3dxasq,crownjewel82,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"There are also a few nice, quiet neighborhoods north of Tharpe street, with it being quieter and less student-centric as you go east (Parkside Park Terrace neighborhood, Town and Country, etc). It gets really student-filled west of High Rd though. Here you can find houses for rent around your budget. There are also nice houses for rent just north of I-10 on Monroe St, near Lake Jackson (on the E and W side of the street). Tallahassee is not big, so these are still a 10 min-ish drive to campus. Many times these homes can be cheaper than something S of I-10. Traffic is not a huge problem here and there are lots of ""back roads"" you can take to get to major destinations like FSU and downtown, the mall, etc. Killearn is nice, but can be pricey and is very family oriented (lots of people with kids as it has good public schools) and lacks the nightlife of the rest of the city (if that's your thing).  Those are assuming you have a car and are fine with driving. If not, Levy Park for sure. Or in Midtown. (LP is on the W side of Monroe St, and Midtown is more on the E side and can be pricier). Easy to bike, walk, or take the bus to FSU.  It's possible to live in those places I mentioned and ignore the college and its lifestyle while still being close. Tallahassee is on the up and up for the most part with more businesses and shops opening by the year. Crime is a problem but it mostly stays localized to certain parts of town, either way, lock your doors and whatnot. If you live in Levy Park, don't leave anything like a grill out not locked up. I moved here for school and never left and I really love it here, that doesn't happen for everyone but I do hope you guys enjoy your time here!"
Tallahassee,3dxasq,mbltlh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:29 2015 UTC,"First off, welcome to Tally!   The majority of the housing that is very close to campus is mostly undergraduate students so I would look for a place on the outskirts but still close to the campus. I live in an awesome little ""family neighborhood"" about 20 minutes (with traffic) from campus called ""weems plantation"". It is on the north east side of town just off of Mahan. My rent is $1250 but I know there might be houses for rent that are probably a little cheaper. The houses are pretty new, I think they were built in 2007. Also, there is an awesome park with tennis courts, a dog park, really cool hiking trails, etc. literally 2 minutes away.  Basically, I would look for housing on the north east side of Tallahassee. The majority of the houses closed to campus are decrepit and pieces of shit..  Killearn is another area of Tallahassee I would look into for housing. It is also a ""family area"" and is pretty safe. It is the north side of Tallahassee.  Do you have any pets or anything specific you're looking for in a home? I will look for a couple houses in a good area and post you the links to them when I get back from campus today!"

Tallahassee,3ds2lz,ahmc84,4,Sat Jul 18 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"Like others, I'd just stick with Comcast.  If you go to the service center to take care of things as much as possible instead of doing things over the phone, it won't be nearly as bad customer service.  You might be able to get a promotional deal from Comcast by virtue of being a ""new"" customer (don't know if they consider that by name or address).  Even if not, you could always tell them you'll go to CenturyLink if they don't give you a better deal.  They almost certainly will fold."

Honestly, I know some people have horror-stories with Comcast, but I had them for several years and it was an overall positive experience (talking strictly Internet access, not TV or phone service). However, I'd recommend getting your own modem, such as a Motorola Surfboard. When I first moved to Tallahassee, they gave me a modem that couldn't handle the bandwidth level for which I signed up. Setting up your own modem is automated now; you don't even have to call them anymore."
Tallahassee,3ds2lz,psyboarz,2,Sun Jul 19 15:37:08 2015 UTC,Comcast is the only decent internet in town for residential. I'm currently able to download between 15-17 megabytes a second. http://imgur.com/dIBATBZ  If you are unfortunate enough to be having disconnects you'll need to hound them. It took me almost a year to convince them to look into our neighborhood line after getting frequent disconnects and sure enough the main neighborhood line was practically cut in half.  They're argument to not wanting to check was that nobody else in the neighborhood was complaining. However 90% of our neighbors are elderly retired who wouldn't notice if internet suddenly didn't exist anymore.

She's a realtor and former Tallahassee mayor, and in addition to buying and selling properties, she also rents out a dozen or more townhouses, duplexes, and houses all over town. She's whip-smart and pretty strict. She's careful about who she rents to and how they treat her properties, and she's always on top of things when you need help. It's like renting from Martha Stewart: The properties are immaculate and she handles every last detail, but you're almost a little afraid to make her mad. Given the choice between a manager who's never around and rents to any idiot with a checkbook...or a woman who's a walking encyclopedia of property management and responsible renting, I highly recommend the latter.

Tallahassee,3ddgcb,godwithasmallg,4,Wed Jul 15 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"Updated Story: Holy shit...   A man being transported to the hospital from the Havana Police Department after taking the euphoric drug ""Molly"" escaped from the ambulance and was later killed during a home invasion in Tallahassee   ...   ""He was shouting and came to the threshold of our bedroom,"" said the homeowner, a retired police officer who did not want to be named. ""He said 'I'm going to kill you. 'I'm going to kill you. 'I'm going to kill you.'""   ""Thank God we're still alive,"" he said.  I guess he had to say that regardless but wow, how the hell did the ambulance just lose this guy? I understand how he could possibly get out but then they couldn't find him?"
Tallahassee,3ddgcb,MacaulayConnor,2,Wed Jul 15 15:31:32 2015 UTC,To what extent is an ambulance required/allowed to restrain and detained someone who refuses care? It said he demanded to be let out and they stopped the ambulance...are they required to let him out if he demands it? I certainly don't think they would be allowed or advised to pursue someone who's clearly a little unstable. I'm kind of confused by a lot of this.
Tallahassee,3ddgcb,MacaulayConnor,-1,Wed Jul 15 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"He was already under their care and clearly unstable. So you suggest that they should just let him go out into the world and do whatever while totally fucked up? If someone is a danger to themselves or others they should at least try and keep track of him and call the police. I don't know what circumstances got him in the hospital in the first place but once he is there they should be responsible for making sure he isn't a threat to others before just letting him jump out of the ambulance and saying good luck. I'm not saying they didn't do this, just saying it's confusing and trying to figure out what you're saying."
Tallahassee,3ddgcb,BlueSapphyre,4,Wed Jul 15 23:15:28 2015 UTC,"So you suggest that they should just let him go out into the world and do whatever while totally fucked up?   I didn't ""suggest"" they should or should not do anything. I'm not ""saying"" anything. I asked a question.  Specifically, I asked about the legal rights and responsibilities of paramedics towards those in their care. They are not doctors, but often work under medical direction, so are they able to officially determine instability/being ""a threat to others"" and detain him accordingly? Would they legally be allowed to detain him considering he walked into a police department and essentially said ""Hey, cops, I'm on illegal drugs right now""? Since he was being transported from a police station to a hospital via ambulance and hadn't actually been admitted yet, is that a factor in how much control paramedics have over the situation? I'm not knowledgable about what a paramedic could and could not legally do in this particular case, or any similar one. Hence, you know, asking."
Tallahassee,3ddgcb,shabushabumochi,2,Wed Jul 15 23:43:22 2015 UTC,"There are different levels to handling a combative patient, but yes, in moderate cases paramedics can restrain the patient in a supine position, similar to if the patient was having a seizure. The paramedic can place them in flex cuffs (not metal cuffs) but must also be escorted by a law enforcement officer. In extreme cases, medication like tranquilizers are used."
Tallahassee,3ddgcb,BlueSapphyre,3,Thu Jul 16 12:43:15 2015 UTC,Why wasn't he in restraints if he was freaking out that much? Maybe he only had the episode after he escaped? Damn scary story though.

Tallahassee,3ddgcb,PeterRikers,0,Wed Jul 15 21:35:09 2015 UTC,Well the ambulance would have to slow to a stop and then chase after him. He was probably long gone by the time they got back to the area he jumped.

I am in graduate school and her best friend so I know all the details on the properties, but she would be the landlord.  One is closer to I-10 so it's easy to access.  The other is south of the airport and quieter.  Both are 3 bedroom and 2 bath with the master having a bath in the room and the other rooms sharing a bathroom.  Basically she would be renting the room and wouldn't rent the extra rooms.  If you wanted a female roommate, I know she's new to town and was also debating getting a roommate at one property.  If you did that, I would recommend the property near I-10.

Tallahassee,3cluwj,sidescrollin,4,Fri Jul 10 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, very rosy outlook. But in the real world, sometimes people stop them.  And then they feel embarrassed. Its a thing. I'm just asking for tips for people who are interested, why all the questions!?"
Tallahassee,3cluwj,crownjewel82,0,Fri Jul 10 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"Obviously given the number of replies that are surprised this is even a problem or the people that assume it would be, most people have little first hand experience in the matter, as you would expect. Given that, I don't think anyone is going to be able to say, for sure, any places that you can go to without worry. I have never been anyone and tried to try on a bra, and my girlfriend has never had any problems trying them on, so I haven't got the slightest clue.   Victoria's secret is really girly, and there are a lot of immature girls hanging out around there. No need to go to a good lingerie shop, because they have very expensive bras that are made to fit a specific way, and the workers there are trained for that. I think you would have less of a problem there, but there is no need in spending that much, also most of those places usually have bigger sizes.  I would assume your best bet would be somewhere more casual, like a department store, like Macy's or maybe even just target or walmart or something. If you guys are worried about it being an issue and don't actually have implants or breasts as a result of hormone therapy that need real support, then I wouldn't worry much about the fitment from now, I think that after a few are tried on, she will know what size fits best.   The most specific part of sizing, from my experience, is the actual cup shape and relationship to cup size and size/width. Place like department stores and even victoria's secret sell pretty crappy fitting bras, many made just filled with padding. If you have larger boobs, like my girlfriend, these cheaper brands are unsupportive and make weird shapes. My girlfriend like brands we have found and upper end stores like Freya, and the sizing is entirely different.  Your girlfriend doesn't need anything this specific at the moment, by the sounds of it, so the regular stuff at department stores will probably work just fine. As I said, once she manages to try some on she will probably have a good idea of what she needs, and will be able to simply by them in the future, or return them if absolutely necessary, so you won't have to really worry about what store you are at and how their fitting room staff behave."
Tallahassee,3cluwj,teh_maxh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"The biggest concern with buying a bra is the fitting. Victoria Secret is probably the best store for that now but I don't know what their trans policy is. If you want to try, go when it's not crowded and ask for a fitting.   Worst case scenario, you can always help her measure at home and then buy the bra from the internet. Bare necessities will let you return stuff if it doesn't fit."
Tallahassee,3cluwj,CoffeeAndPomade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"Burlington (if they're still open) doesn't really pay attention to what you're doing, but it's a sad place. Target probably won't pay attention to what you're doing, but sometimes will ask to inspect what you're bringing into the dressing room. (Target has the advantage of not having segregated dressing rooms, too, once you get in.)"
Tallahassee,3cluwj,thug_life4,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"OP,Just out of curiosity would you mind expanding on your question some? It had nerve occurred to me that finding a friendly business would be an issue, not that it doesn't seem plausible now that you mention it. Like have you, or know of anyone who has, had issues before with stores? I would hope not but like I said, I am a bit curious, sorry if it is a weird question."
Tallahassee,3cluwj,thug_life4,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:55:11 2015 UTC,"It's cool. This may come as a surprise, but yes, transgirls, especially those who are just starting the transition and still look more like men, do sometimes have trouble trying to buy women's clothing in public. I heard a particularly rough story where a girl got told she couldn't try on the bras at victoria's secret because the dressing rooms are for ""real women"" only. Transphobia still very much a thing.  But, I did sort of get this totally unfounded idea in my head that maybe some local shops here would be more open than say, corporations that employ people all over the country and so no one individual store knows the company wide policy about who can and cant use a dressing room (for example, victoria's secrets company wide stance is that men transitioning to female can try on clothes if the dressing rooms aren't full. random, and not the best, but true.) So, that's why I asked! I just like it when people are nice."
Tallahassee,3cluwj,Miyomei,-9,Thu Jul 9 05:21:09 2015 UTC,"I mean yeah, a dude looking to bring a bra into a dressing room is strange. Id expect to get some looks and possibly not be allowed, since you know, bras are for women."

Tallahassee,3c4z8q,DimRock,3,Sat Jul 4 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"From their website.  The bold is my emphasis.  • The League of the South asserts that Southern society is radically different from the society impressed upon it by an alien occupier. American society today is egalitarian and Marxist and is devoid of any grace or charm. In contrast, we believe in a Southern society that:  • Upholds the ontological or spiritual equality of all men before God and the bar of justice, while recognizing and rejoicing in the fact that is has neither been the will of God Almighty nor within the power of human legislation to make any two men mechanically equal.  • Is structured upon the Biblical notion of hierarchy.  In short, a recognition of the natural societal order of superiors and subordinates where Christian charity (as found in the second Table of the Law) toward our neighbors produces harmony and stability. Christ is the head of His Church; husbands are the heads of their families; parents are placed over their children; employers rank above their employees; the teacher is superior to his students, etc."

How much parking is there? Parking is non existent and if you find a spot you will be driving slower than you could walk.  Would you consider it a safe event? As in, are there ever any fights? Or do people ever get arrested in the park? Extremely safe lots of cops and families.  What is the best part about the event? Driving home"
Tallahassee,3bvlgn,psyboarz,2,Thu Jul 2 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"I can't answer everything, but there are a lot of people and traffic is bananas. There are always shuttles, since there isn't enough parking in the park for everyone that goes. I don't know where the shuttles are this year. I've never heard of anything dangerous happening, and its pretty much considered a family friendly event. It is pretty crowded, but it's the best view of the fireworks and they have a lot of live music."

They had an incredible mess dumped on them yesterday and have worked hard through the night to get power restored to as many folks as possible. They've also been providing constant updates and have been highly responsive via their Twitter account (@COTnews), which has been extremely helpful. They've managed this situation about as well as they possibly could. They were named #1 public utility in the nation a few years ago, and stuff like this storm management is why they deserve it."

Tallahassee,3bnew7,Serpent10i,5,Tue Jun 30 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.  Its not a lot of work to write a summary after I watch these things and its fun to see what you guys think.  Small rant: I think Reddit can do things that the newspaper isn't designed for.  Its a perfect medium to turn everyone into a journalist and get feedback.  I don't know if it will ever become more popular, but you sort of need to create some quality supply to get some demand.  Ideally the city commission would have a reddit post for every single item.  If we had a bigger community on here (""~200 users here"" now rather than ~16), I'd probably do that before each meeting. Its way more effective than taking time off work at 4PM to get 3 minutes of speaking time with no feedback."
Tallahassee,3bnew7,Calijor,2,Tue Jun 30 21:02:18 2015 UTC,I suggest you check this over the course of the next few months to make sure of the changes and also if you ride the bus regularly they generally have any route changes posted inside the buses.

I had the thought that you probably could turn a profit by having a luxury bus line take people from Thomasville to Downtown Tally in the morning and then back in the afternoon.  There's a caravan of people coming to work everyday.  If you charged $100 a month and had free breakfast and wifi so that people could work, I bet you could make at least a small profit."
Tallahassee,3bnew7,Kryian,2,Tue Jun 30 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"Have you watched the documentary about NYC's illegal bus lines?  They are cheaper, faster and more flexible than the traditional bus lines.  I can't find the full documentary that I watched, but here is The Atlantic's write up.  Also, in regards to your other comment (apologies in advance for the slight snark):   And the private sector's never been known for its providing transport to the poor at a loss...   Yep.  Because the private sector finds ways to do it cheaper and turn a profit, like the NYC lines I just mentioned.  Sorry for the snark.  I tried to avoid it, but couldn't come up with a way to say it that didn't seem somewhat snarky."

Hopefully someone, in some city figures out a good alternative and other cities adopt it."

Just immerse yourself in the language to learn it.  That said, as a Latino, I'd be careful going anywhere in SA without knowing enough to seem like an everyday person.  No matter what country you pick, people love to pick up foreigners, especially light-skinned ones.  Easy money.  That and in many communities it's very culturally knit, so if you don't fit in, they'll dick you around.  Not trying to scare you, but please do your homework before you pick a place, and do it WELL.  I hate when people just think somewhere else is better because of movies and pop culture.

Tallahassee,3b1zjx,TwisterFister,4,Thu Jun 25 12:33:02 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree - soccer is gaining new fans every day.  A professional (or semi prof) team coming to this area would really boost the economy.

Tallahassee,3b1zjx,RschDev,0,Thu Jun 25 14:43:20 2015 UTC,so FSU was to blame for the team leaving ? I mean theres plenty of arenas that share venues between hockey & basketball. To me it seems the wood was damaged out of incompetence

Of course the south side has all the notoriety, but there's been some fucked up crimes (like, for example a spate of sexual assaults in Killearn or that lawyer being shot dead in his driveway in Betton Hills) all over town.  And there's a ton of petty crime and robberies all the time.  Doesn't hurt to have security systems anywhere you live.  I'm not saying build a moat and never leave your house.  A simple camera is a deterrent and can accrue evidence, and it doesn't reflect on the user's mental state."

Tallahassee,3ayzwu,MacaulayConnor,2,Wed Jun 24 22:10:04 2015 UTC,"The uber conversation is really interesting, although I'm not sure I understand all of the regulations involved in taxi driving. I get the insurance, the registration, the driving limits, inspections, etc. But why require a permit to operate at the airport? And why ban street hails? What's the reasoning behind these particular regulations?"
Tallahassee,3ayzwu,Kryian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:14:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's particularly relevant to Tallahassee, but in larger cities airport pickup zones are a madhouse with taxi traffic. I would imagine they use permits to simply control the amount of traffic in those areas.  Just a guess, though."
Tallahassee,3ayzwu,MacaulayConnor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's possible...I feel like it would be easier to just hold taxis to the same standards as your average person going to pick up someone at the airport. Keep it moving and no one gets hurt.  Also, the street hails. God I miss living in a place where I could just hail a taxi like that. Those were simpler times...by the same logic, I suppose it could be to keep traffic moving? Its not like we have bus/cab lanes, but it's also not like Tallahassee has such an unmanageable amount of traffic that a cab stopping to pick up a fare would just ruin everything. I can't imagine 1) traffic being THAT bad, and 2) demand for cabs being that high."
Tallahassee,3ayzwu,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:11:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. Is this televised like C-SPAN?

Tallahassee,3ayzwu,Krang_Devastator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:31:46 2015 UTC,Oh awesome! Thanks again. C-SPAN is probably one of my most watched channels. I just find political debates fascinating.
Tallahassee,3ayzwu,BlueSapphyre,2,Wed Jun 24 17:36:08 2015 UTC,"I like political debates too.  The city ones are cool because its about thing and places that I walk by everyday.  The national guys are trying to handle huge things that are nearly impossible to fully grasp.  Also, while you can see the commissioners political leanings, they aren't devoted to political party rhetoric like the national debate is.    Richardson is the South Side advocate, Miller is pro-environment and tries to defocus from constant South Side efforts, the Mayor is a progressive but just likes to organize and communicate efficiently, Maddox is a heavy handed former democrat mayor, Ziffer is probably the most conservative but is very moderate.  They are all very smart though."
Tallahassee,3ayzwu,BlueSapphyre,2,Wed Jun 24 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair Richardson is a lot more than just the Southside advocate.  It's true the other Commissioners asked him to assume the role of Southside Liaison to their Office, but he fights for the arts, businesses, and persons with disabilities.  I find him to be the least political and most pragmatic of the Commissioners"
Tallahassee,3ayzwu,BlueSapphyre,0,Thu Jun 25 12:31:37 2015 UTC,"He is a very smart guy.  I guess rather than Southside I should have said ""little guy"".  Its not really pragmatic to expect Uber drivers to accommodate people with disabilities though, but I suppose it is the law if you are going to treat those drivers as single-car taxi services."
Tallahassee,3awn2w,charlie20010,4,Wed Jun 24 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"You can approach Domi Ventures (they're an incubator). They have tons of access to that kind of thing.

Tallahassee,3av15y,Chaff5,3,Tue Jun 23 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"Yelp is a terrible source of information about restaurants for anything beyond the address, phone number, and hours of operation. I could write anything I wanted about any restaurant and people would believe it.  An example: A customer once wrote a review about the bar I work at. It read ""Dont go here. The bartender kicked me out for no reason and a customer punched me in the face."" What he didn't bring up was that he was kicked out for bringing his own beer (illegal, for starters, and just a dick move) and that he was punched in the face after he threatened to ""burn the bar down again"" (once again, illegal, and a dick move). The guy also neglected to mention I kicked out the customer that punched him in the face.  So remember, take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt, because they might just be bullshit."
Tallahassee,3av15y,Chaff5,0,Tue Jun 23 23:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get what you're saying about a single review, but it's there's multiples saying the same thing, it's a possible issue, no?"
Tallahassee,3av15y,Chaff5,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:28:46 2015 UTC,"After perusing the yelp reviews, I see what you're referring to.  The negative reviews fall into two categories: ""HIPSTERS!"" and ""Rude service"". The former I tend to ignore, as far as the latter goes I'd guess a number are ""They wouldn't put up with my bullshit so 1 star"" types. I did read a couple of negative reviews that seemed legitimate...As I've mentioned elsewhere, I've always been treated great there, but your results may vary."
Tallahassee,3av15y,Chaff5,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:32:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it wasn't the former that bothered me, it was the latter. But I suppose there's a lot of employee turnover, since this is a college town, so it just depends on when you go. If it wasn't on the other side of town, I would stop in and try it out."

And also, anything investing related would be fun: corporate logos for a picture round, components of the Dow, a history of stock market crashes, various investor/trader terminology (you could probably make this as easy or hard as you want, anything from things most people know, like the Dow or S&P500, to straight up day trader terminology, which is crazy fun but probably barely anyone knows).

Tallahassee,3aezgz,Raikus,20,Fri Jun 19 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"Gaines Street Pies is moving across Railroad Ave. to a new location next to Grassland's Brewery. They filed their proposed sign seen in the image and it was rejected by the city saying it didn't meet the sign code for the area (specifically interior lit sign).  If you've taken a drive down Gaines Street lately you've no doubt seen the huge, lit signs for chains like Jimmy John's, Urban Outfitters, The Block, Deck and many others. It seems that the sign codes don't apply to national chains -- only locally-owned businesses.   This isn't the only example of the city screwing over locally owned businesses in favor of chains. If anyone cares about this issue it would help to contact city Commissioners and let them know:   gil.ziffer@talgov.com  nancy.miller@talgov.com  scott.maddox@talgov.com  andrew.gillum@talgov.com  curtis.richardson@talgov.com  EDIT: Update! According to GSP:   Your voices have been heard!

There will be a public hearing on July 9th. Thanks for all of your help and we will keep you updated!"

I wonder if once they've effectively run off every local established business and replaced them with bland generic franchises, if another part of town will take up the slack and become the new authentic artsy Tallahassee area.

Just think of it this way, a developer comes in and convinces a bunch of rich people they can get even richer by buying up all this property around Gaines street and leveling the existing community (who cares about those anyway?) and building expensive student housing, monetizing the surrounding parking situation (free parking within a mile? Nope) and bringing in a bunch of safe trendy franchises (like Urban Outfitters).  It concentrates the money back into the hands of the already wealthy, rather than letting it go to waste in the hands of the middle class just trying to make a life for themselves and enrich the community.  Perhaps that's overly cynical, and a little simplified, but what's going to happen when a Starbucks eventually replaces All Saints?  When the proposed grocery store being built right across from Bread and Roses drives them out of business?  What happens to actual grassroots local communities when they can't survive the gentrification apocalypse?"
Tallahassee,3aezgz,clearliquidclearjar,2,Sat Jun 20 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm as invested as anyone in holding onto the arts and music section of Gaines Street, but the grocery store is a pretty good idea.

Tallahassee,39xl6g,zeperf,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"From the website:  A highlight of the proposed changes is as follows:   Add definitions of digital platform, transportation network application company and transportation network operator to incorporate UBER-type companies and drivers. Amend Article II from Taxicab Franchise to Vehicle for Hire Company Permits. Previously, only taxicab companies had to apply to the City Commission for a franchise, and meet certain requirements. This amendment drops all references to franchises. Proposed change will require all vehicle for hire companies to apply for a permit (taxicab companies, transportation services, and transportation network application companies). Proposed change is for application to be made to a vehicle for hire administrator. Previous franchises were for 10 years; proposed change has no time limit, but requires annual update of driver, vehicle, and insurance information, and the payment of an annual company permit fee to be used for administration and enforcement. Article III is amended to require all vehicle for hire drivers to apply for a driver permit. Proposed change is for permit or credential to be valid for two years instead of one year. Proposed change is for companies who choose may conduct background investigations on prospective drivers and issue credentials in lieu of completing the City application process as long as companies certify that all criteria have been met. Proposed change is to remove requirement for drug testing except for reasonable suspicion. The driver permit cost can be lowered from $42.50 to $30.00, except for those companies who choose to conduct their own background checks, who will pay a flat fee of $7,500. Article IV is amended to require all vehicle for hire vehicles (whether owned by the company or by the driver) to be inspected. Inspection is amended from twice a year to once a year. Maximum rates (section 22-97) are amended to allow transportation services and transportation network (UBER) companies to charge no less than the maximum rate of taxis and no more than 250% of the maximum rates of taxis, of which the rate must be agreed upon by the driver and passenger before the ride begins. Transportation network (UBER) drivers must accept passengers solely through the digital platform and may not solicit street-hails."

Tallahassee,39nbx3,Tomhugedong,9,Fri Jun 12 23:41:35 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  There is a large service industry market in Tallahassee, due in large part to the universities and legislature. Depending on your experience, it may be relatively easy to find work.   In my experience, it is always the best move to take an entry position such as dishwashing if nothing else is available. We have a transient population and restaurants/bars can have high employee turnover, and it's best to get your foot in the door, even if the job isn't what you may have been looking for initially.   I'm not from the Midwest, but I have travelled there and have friends from the area. I don't foresee any geographical culture shocks, but it is worth noting that Tallahassee is, in large part, primarily a college football town. The culture associated with FSU/FAMU is more or less prevalent dependent on where you decide to live.    Good luck and Godspeed."

Tallahassee,3998v5,sassysaba,2,Wed Jun 10 04:58:39 2015 UTC,"Besides CL, hotpads.com was useful for me. When searching in Tallahassee, half of what you'll get is going to be student oriented housing, which is kind of annoying if you're not a student. Most of the larger complexes are marketed towards students, but being in the Midtown area you may not have that problem as much. There are also tons of smaller complexes, so you do have lots of options, in regards to the type of complexes that are available.   If you'll be in the area before the time you have to move here, driving around is really helpful because there are a lot of houses for rent that you won't find on online postings, and it'll allow you to scope out the neighborhoods."

I've lived here 3 years and I can say this: the cheap are really shitty and the expensive aren't that amazing. I used to live in Player's Club and that to me, is the only place done up well enough and fairly priced for everything (504/month furnished and utilities included, might be more now).  Personally I would look into getting a townhome or house. A lot cheaper and better to deal with a landlord than management in my opinion. Unless you're looking for a place without roommates...in which case apartments may actually be cheaper."
Tallahassee,3998v5,teap0ts,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:28:41 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping my roommate days are behind me forever (no offense to any of them). But it's time. I felt similarly about the apartments aimed at college students/undergrads when I was at FSU, I'm assuming that apartments aimed at a non-student, professional demographic will have more incentive to not be so overpriced and shitty. I've mostly avoided houses because, while cheaper, they tend to have more bedrooms than I really want for just one person (which isn't a terrible problem to have, I suppose), and because I don't want to do yard work. If I could find a great townhouse or even a condo leased by an individual as opposed to a large corporate management company (my current situation), that would be great. I'm definitely open."

Everything you are suggesting is way, way out of their league. Carswell's not going to bring in a touring band that won't make the dough."
Tallahassee,37kpq8,tercerero,2,Fri May 29 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to be helpful by providing contacts.  Even if Carswell doesn't book them, he may be able to point them in the right direction.  Which I said."

They can totally get booked in Tally, and that FB group is a great place to make those contacts. I do suggest that they put up some music on their bandcamp page and not just on youtube. They have a good sound, and I could see them in Liberty or added on to a larger show."
Tallahassee,37kpq8,clearliquidclearjar,1 point,Fri May 29 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"Woah guys, no fighting. Everyone's being helpful. We're just trying to get contacts right now. We don't plan on hitting these places up till probably the middle of June or July. We don't expect playing any huge venues, but it's nice to have the connections if need be.   We've all been part of different bands that have played, and some of us have toured with our previous bands, but we're just trying to set up some concrete stuff. We just want contacts cause we want to do this tour dirt cheap and hope to make some friends along the way for future endeavors.  As for right now, our music is only available to press at the moment along with our press release for our debut single. The single will come out on June 30th, and then after we do a small summer number of summer shows, we're planning on releasing our EP sometime around September-October, we will definitely have it available for listen before it goes on sale.   We're just planning to drum up hype and get fans until the release, because there is no point on putting on a tour if no ones going to show up. When we do our summer shows we will most likely be playing the whole EP, which will allow people to actually hear it before it releases in fall, and before we go on our fall/winter tour."
Tallahassee,37kpq8,clearliquidclearjar,1 point,Fri May 29 20:06:58 2015 UTC,"I'm seriously not trying to fight, just saying that those suggestions were a little above your current scope. But you do need to put your music on your bandcamp page, because just having merch on there is sketchy. People want to know what you sound like before they consider booking you, obviously, and so much of a small tour is done through people who aren't big promoters. You know?"
Tallahassee,37kpq8,clearliquidclearjar,2,Fri May 29 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we will definitely have stuff up by june 30th, and I'll make sure that when I hit up venues and people to send them the press links. We would just post stuff publicly but we have an agreement with a media distributor to release the music video, and part of the agreement was that the release of the video and single would happen on the same day.   If anyone is super interested in hearing our stuff though, I wouldn't mind PM'ing them a direct link to the single or the EP."

She's got a foul mouth, along with most of the people in there (you're in a barber shop for christ sake), but she does a damn good job and very reasonably priced. Just be prepared to wait though, she doesnt do appointments, and there are sometimes up to 5 people waiting for her while the other barbers all have empty chairs."

Instead of asking their gender then making a half-hearted sarcastic inclusion of nontraditional gender roles, just ask if they prefer more masculine or feminine cuts. Pretty simple."

Armada is the strategic capital ships battle, it's very slow moving, and you're planning your moves 2-3 turns ahead of time. So you could have an attack command in 3 turns, but by the time it comes around there's nothing to attack. Planning is so important."

Tallahassee,35v6sw,pancakescestcharmant,1 point,Wed May 13 21:23:17 2015 UTC,"Basically, no. And good luck subletting, because there's 50,000 people trying to do the same thing. Your best bet is to find an individual landlord (not a complex or management company) via craigslist, and offer them an extra $100 a month for a six month lease versus the price of a year lease."
Tallahassee,35v6sw,das_thorn,1 point,Wed May 13 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"I figure my best bet would be trying to find a sublease, but they arent really common for August. My current lease ends july 31st, then i may be leaving town a couple months after that, or longer, or shorter, I just don't know. My GF just graduated and It all comes down to when she finds a job. If she gets a job offer over the summer then it's all gravy, but like for me I didnt get employment for over a year after graduation, so who fucking knows when/where we are moving since she has been interviewing with companies all over the country.  I'm just super stressed right now because I dont have a solid plan on how to handle this situation."

There are plenty of leases available starting on August 1st... I just signed a lease for August 1st. My current lease is up on the 31st.  I asked the landlord if I could move in on the 30th or 31st and they agreed so I won't be out on the street for a night.   You're going to have to find a storage unit to put your stuff in, and either stay at a friend's or an extended stay hotel."
Tallahassee,35sqto,pagenumber,3,Wed May 13 05:20:42 2015 UTC,"Talk to your current landlord. I also had this issue (only a 12 day gap, but still) after signing a new lease and the office at my current apartment is allowing us to stay by prorating a daily rent. The prorate is based off the monthly rent, divided into the number of days in August, and then multiplied by the number of extra days we are staying."
Tallahassee,35sqto,OnceNFutureNick,2,Wed May 13 13:10:49 2015 UTC,I would try finding someone who will let you sublease for that period of time. Most people are dying to get any money for their place over summer so even if you have to rent for all of August it could be worth it
Tallahassee,35sqto,ffloridastatee,2,Wed May 13 10:39:19 2015 UTC,I'm in this exact problem next year when I graduate. Lease ends in August but I graduate in December. I talked with my landlady (who is kinda aware of our existence so we're not just random tenants) and she said she could extend my lease for a few months to accommodate the gap. Check with your landlord. If you're on good terms they might give you your extra time. Good luck!
Tallahassee,35sqto,FSCoded,1 point,Wed May 13 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"Unless your old place has someone lined up to move in they will likely let you extend your lease. You may have to pay till August 31st, but overlap is better than not having a place. You generally want some overlap as it's impossible to move in a night."

Tallahassee,35r4hg,Anothershad0w,14,Wed May 13 14:57:21 2015 UTC,He was never a democrat. He's been in office for almost 30 years as an independent. He's never accepted money from superPACs and never run a negative ad campaign. He's switching to a democrat to run for president because he doesn't want to be a spoiler in a two party system. I don't find that bothersome or unreasonable. I look at his voting history over the past 20 years and believe he has maintained his principles better than any other candidate running for president.
Tallahassee,35r4hg,Anothershad0w,-1,Tue May 12 20:56:06 2015 UTC,"ok, you're correct.  he wasn't really ever a D.  but my point about him switching to D for the money, access and votes still stands.  i guess you're not bothered by it."
Tallahassee,35r4hg,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue May 12 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"If he ran as an independent he would pull liberal votes away from the Democratic party, weakening himself and the democratic candidate in the general.  The only people his running as an independent would help are the Republicans.  Since he is running as a Democrat he is representing a more moderate/liberal populace in the Democratic primary. If he loses, the democrats (including liberals) can unite behind the winning candidate.  He's just playing the game the best he can, he didn't make the rules."

Your coils could be frozen from lack of airflow.  Our issue was a faulty relay switch which would surge the breaker. They just needed to install a slow starter on it.

Tallahassee,35pibi,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue May 12 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"I just fixed mine this weekend.  Turned out to be the starter capacitor.  Neither the fan or compressor were running, but I had power past the contactor.  The compressor is louder than the fan.  It should be easy to tell if its running if you put your hand on it.  I saw online that you're supposed to check for continuity between all three terminals to check if the compressor is good or not.  Also a heat pump is just an air conditioner that can run in reverse so good heat should mean good cooling assuming all electrical stuff is fine and nothing is clogged."

Even then without proper exercise(for a Husky, maybe one hour fast walk or run a day). Puppy school is more about training you, not the dog. Good on you for doing it, a lot of people don't and they create uncontrolled monsters. Good luck and just have patience and love.

Tallahassee,35prjr,tercerero,3,Tue May 12 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"It really depends - Saturday afternoons can be a nightmare.  Mornings are good - you'll get an older crowd.    I used to at a regular time (early evenings), and we got to know a lot of people/dogs who were there at the same time.  My advice is - let your dog off leash - leashed dogs attract attention from the others, and since they can't run away, they will likely bite.  Don't get in the middle of a dog fight & don't lift your dog up and try to walk out, you'll get creamed.  If you get a bad feeling from any dog, just leave.  Don't bring any food or treats in.    Try to find like minded people who don't mind if their dogs rough house - play is how they learn, and your puppy needs it."

Tallahassee,356foc,BroomstickLollipop,2,Thu May 7 14:36:09 2015 UTC,They looked for venues too late and Orlando/Atlanta both didn't have venues available for an event that lasted four days plus the day or so of setup needed.
Tallahassee,356foc,StrikerObi,4,Thu May 7 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"I wrote this a few days ago on the league subreddit   I know there was a PR post about this in an AMA like a week ago, but I'm going to bite. It's because it was cheap and low risk. They're hosting it at an event center that wasn't doing anything those four days anyways, on a campus that isn't in session. You can't tell me that it cost more than a few grand a day to rent it out.  Plus, the city is small, but it's big enough to easily host the 5-10K visitors, especially since Florida legislature isn't in session hogging up all of the hotels. While yes, Tampa/Orlando/Miami/Jacksonville would have bigger venues, would the extra cost of the venue be worth the small attendance boost? Maybe, but this is safer financially.   To add to that, the majority of their income will come from online streaming services, and not the live event.  So yes, you want a nice event center, it doesn't matter quite as much as most sporting events."

Not sure how quick they will fill up though so you will probably want to get there early. UFC usually fills the place an hour before the fights start but I'm not sure how much the cover will deter people.

I can't speak for elementary/middle, but you've picked a rough time for getting the attention of high school teachers - we're about at the peak of our yearly standardized testing nightmare and at least at my small school (SAIL) it'd be very difficult to find more than a couple of teachers willing to give you the time of day.  I have a hunch that you might be able to get a better response right now from some of the private schools who don't have to deal with all the testing?  Perhaps try contacting Maclay School or Grass Roots?  Sorry I don't have anything concrete to offer.  I looked at your link and it seems like a useful tool, but probably not something I'll use in senior level math :)"

Tallahassee,340oax,swampcreek,-4,Mon Apr 27 11:17:08 2015 UTC,"For those moving to Tallahassee.  Try youtube ""tallahassee.""  The news in Tallahassee is censored. It is government city with all the corruption and exploitation that comes with being in the south:  Racist, thugs, old hateful people and crime.  Someone is always being investigated by the FBI.  You will get it all on youtube: unflitered.  At least you know what you are up against.    It is one of the armpits of the U.S., There ditches, no sidewalks, garbage. (quality of life = ghetto). This more prevalent in certain parts of the town.  Naturally, the town is highly segregated into have and have nots;  the majority of is have nots with 60,000 college students.   If you have options, consider them strongly.  Most who come, will ultimately will leave.  Unless you are from there or family, it really is dead end place."

She's a former mayor, so she knows the town and in which neighborhood you'd fit best just by talking to you. Also, she's strict as hell about things like cleanliness, pets, credit score, etc. She's a cross between Martha Stewart and a drill sergeant. If she likes you, you're set for life and have an amazing place to live. But if you break the rules or make messes, God help ya!"
Tallahassee,33jtka,jpw5x4,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:23:59 2015 UTC,"Southgroup Apartments are pretty decent. They manage various properties, each with their own pros and cons.   I've lived in their property on Ocala. Management was great but the walls were paper thin. I've heard good things about London Town and meridian is a great location. I was supposed to rent one of their Castle Apartments but my roommate fell through. The tour I took looked nice though.   Aside from that you could try looking for a duplex or something around town. I'm living just past Blairstone and properties are much nicer on this side of town."
Tallahassee,33jtka,Pixelgin,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:31:26 2015 UTC,"After 4 years at FSU, I can definitively say that Jackson Properties is far and away the best experience I've ever had with a property management company. I would've lived here for junior year as well if I knew what I was missing. Very forgiving as far as late fees go, always very prompt in getting someone to your place when you file a service request, cheerful, friendly, respectful.. They don't treat you like some kid who they don't have to listen to just because you'll be gone in a year anyway. They even sent me a card on my birthday, hand signed by all the cute gals they have working in the office. If you're looking to rent a house and not an apartment, J-Prop is 100% the way to go."
Tallahassee,33jtka,cfowlaa,0,Thu Apr 23 07:13:28 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. Jackson Properties has been fantastic. They gave me a deal when I lived in the apartment before my husband moved down. When we got a roommate, they didn't bat an eye and they added him to the lease no problem. Their staff is extremely friendly and competent."

Worth checking into if you'd rather have cheap rent than a pool or whatever.  Also worth looking at: Park Ave Apartments right off of Franklin near Cascades. Older 2 beds that have recently been somewhat renovated. Grad students, late 20s locals, kitchen workers."
Tallahassee,33jtka,clearliquidclearjar,-1,Thu Apr 23 05:26:53 2015 UTC,"I've used Student Housing Solutions, and all I can say are things that really apply to every rental company... Document everything.  Get receipts for everything. Read your lease.  Reread your lease.  Know your legal rights.   STU, and I'm sure many others try to prey on poor, stressed students without resources or time to try and strong arm fees, damage claims, threaten collection agencies, etc at move-out time.  Plenty of attorneys around town willing to help you with a lease agreement.  Also be wary of false promises like them showing you an apartment, but leasing you a diffident one.  Literally nothing matters unless it is in writing and signed.  That all being said, if you treat it like the business transaction it is, nothing should throw you for a loop."
Tallahassee,33jtka,clarinch,0,Thu Apr 23 03:07:09 2015 UTC,Student housing solutions is horrendous. My apartment flooded three times and they practically ignored my maintenance calls. I'd go with a local company like Regional Property Services or Meridian like a previous poster mentioned.
Tallahassee,33jtka,chordae-tendineae,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:24:53 2015 UTC,"Sure, they're horrendous.  I'd never use them again under any circumstance - the only reason we had them at all was because they bought our complex and lease from another company...  can't remember what the old one was...  Hell, the only saving grace we did have was the fact that we were still bound by original lease agreement from the other property management agency."

Tallahassee,33cu96,WickThePriest,5,Mon Apr 27 04:02:08 2015 UTC,"We explored this park after dark a few nights ago, not expecting to see anything but ghosts.   We stumbled upon thousands of lightning bugs on the far side of the mansion!  They lined a non existent pathway into the woods, where they beckoned us deep into the pitch black forest. We declined to follow them as we were all getting terribly creepy vibes, and they would disappear when you got too close.  We went back there another night to find it unlit by these mysterious creatures, but other mysterious lights made an appearance."
Tallahassee,33cu96,kennys_logins,3,Tue Apr 21 21:23:09 2015 UTC,"I had no idea that was a park. I went there once a long time ago, in the middle of the night. Followed the train tracks alongside Mahan to get there, wouldn't have recognized the place if not for the mansion."
Tallahassee,33cu96,clearliquidclearjar,3,Wed Apr 22 00:28:42 2015 UTC,"From my experience, the train runs through that area around 9am on Saturdays. I actually set out to find this place via trails back in September and it wasn't until my curiosity led me over the rail tracks from the fern trail (the underpass section shown in the video) I stumbled upon it. I invited friends back to it numerous times."
Tallahassee,33cu96,kennys_logins,2,Wed Apr 22 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"Don't turn from your mic when talking about features.

That's right by my house but I've never gone INTO it, just walk down the tracks to the entrance and turn back."
Tallahassee,33cu96,ramzafl,3,Wed Apr 22 03:56:53 2015 UTC,I tried fixing this a bit through raising the levels when I turn my head in post-production. In the future I will probably turn my entire body if If I need to describe a feature or not at all.

Tallahassee,33axvr,BrainStewYumYum,11,Tue Apr 21 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"The Knott House is right down town, and Pebble Hill Plantation is about 45 minutes north, near Thomasville, GA. Both are museums that do tours and are great examples of southern architecture. Also, the Old Capitol is a museum and it's open to the public during the day, with the original Legislative chambers and such. You can also go up to the top floor of the Capitol building, which has a full 360 degree view of the city.   For older stuff, Mision San Luis is a living history museum on the site of the old Spanish and Apalachee mission. The mission was burned to the ground when the residents fled before the incoming British troops. They've excavated the area and rebuilt a number of the buildings. It's a lovely mix of Apalachee and Spanish cultures.   The Tallahassee Museum of Natural History has a working example of a farm in north Florida at the turn off the twentieth century, as well as native wildlife exhibits and a zip line course through the trees.   Wakulla Springs is about 30 minutes away. You can swim and take a boat tour up the river to see wildlife and also the areas where Tarzan and Creature From The Black Lagoon were filmed. The Lodge there is an old hotel that has a great early twentieth century Florida resort feel to it, and the dining room serves some pretty bangin' fried chicken. There are also walking trails there, and plenty of wildlife. The spring itself is quite unique; iirc, it's the deepest freshwater spring in the world. Unfortunately, the water has become quite dark due to pollution, so it's not the crystal clear water it was 20 years ago, but it's still really beautiful."
Tallahassee,33axvr,agentfantabulous,4,Tue Apr 21 01:58:03 2015 UTC,"From the OP's self description, Wakulla Spring is something you should really check out. Hit the Lodge and then go on a boat ride."

Tallahassee,33axvr,ran22147i,2,Tue Apr 21 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, there have always been times where tannins from oak leaves and such have darkened the water. This is different. The glass bottom boats no longer run, because the water clarity is so poor year-round. When I was a child, one could see clearly to the bottom of the spring beyond the dive platform, but it is almost black down there now. The water sources that feed the spring have not been fully discovered; it's quite a complex system. There has been massive development in the watershed (again, not all of which is even known), and a concerted effort to prevent further damage to the spring and river from runoff. To my knowledge, the scientists aren't entirely positive what is causing the water to darken, but it is clearly different from the usual rainwater and sediment."
Tallahassee,33axvr,agentfantabulous,2,Tue Apr 21 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"The dark water is likely a result of sea level rise and rainfall patterns: abstract  The pollution in the spring shed from development is mainly excess nitrate from septic tanks, but that is not the cause of the dark water."
Tallahassee,33axvr,supercoolquestion,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you for the link. The abstract does not address water clarity, but I'll try to get time later to read the full article.   I remember a few years ago when the Spring Creek Springs stopped bubbling, and all the old timers said they'd seen it before. Love to go swim in the Cole Hole on a hot day. Surreal to taste freshwater surrounded by sea."
Tallahassee,33axvr,agentfantabulous,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:01:54 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that the clarity depends on the source of the water (aquifer or recent rain), which is what the article addresses.  Anyway, the good news with Wakulla springs is that water quality (in terms of nutrients at least) has improved recently due to efforts made under the TMDL. Plus now there are manatees reaching the head springs and their grazing is keeping the hydrilla in check."
Tallahassee,33axvr,supercoolquestion,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen manatees all up in the swimming area several times in the last few years. One guy hung out under the floating dock for hours, coming to breathe every so often.   I did read recently that some botanists were starting to believe that the hydrilla is native, and not introduced by early European explorers. I'm glad to know that environmental policy is making a difference."
Tallahassee,33axvr,agentfantabulous,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I need to get down there again. Hydrilla is a category 1 invasive exotic on the 2015 FLEPPC list, and it was introduced in the 1950s I think. Maybe it's a different plant you're thinking of?"
Tallahassee,33axvr,supercoolquestion,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible. I'm on my second pregnancy in three years, I may have shed those particular neurons.

Tallahassee,33axvr,agentfantabulous,2,Wed Apr 22 00:39:51 2015 UTC,It's still cool. It's really the the first place I went that let me see Florida clearly. There are other's but behind the strip malls and over-development Wakulla Springs exposes how beautiful and wild and primordial Florida actually is.  Also any state park. Leon Sinks is a great walk and the Indian Mounds.
Tallahassee,33axvr,kennys_logins,2,Wed Apr 22 01:02:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I feel like that is the 'real' Florida, not the weird plastic Disney-ized version. At least, that's the Florida that keeps me in Florida."
Tallahassee,33axvr,agentfantabulous,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:31:35 2015 UTC,The irrepressible nature here and the mash-up climate make this place great.  Also every bird that's not a Canadian Goose is a cormorant... at least according to the tour guides at Wakulla Springs.

You won't run into the crowds you'll see in Panama City Beach and the beaches are incredible.  And...bonus architecture!  While you are there, check out Eden Gardens State Park - https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/eden-gardens .  It's a beautiful old plantation right by the beaches.    Just east of Eden Gardens State Park, on Hwy 30A, you'll run into Seaside - http://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/cities/seaside.html - which is where they filmed The Truman Show.   Have fun!"

This is what FSU students say because they never leave the campus area. I post a weekly event listing every week on this subreddit. Check it out and if you have any nightlife questions, post them there.   I went to TCC and I have friends who teach there, and for a community college it is a great option. Welcome to town! You might want to check Mission Road for small houses or duplexes for rent. It's not the most well kept up area, but it's cheap, near TCC, and not too rough."

Tallahassee,33auto,SpookyFarts,8,Tue Apr 21 17:28:12 2015 UTC,Don't live in Frenchtown. Crime isn't as bad as what you were told.

Tallahassee,33auto,clearliquidclearjar,6,Tue Apr 21 13:50:36 2015 UTC,Also from Orlando. The ghetto here (frenchtown) is nothing compared to the numbered streets of OBT and Paramore.
Tallahassee,33auto,Manateekid,2,Tue Apr 21 11:03:00 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly I just looked up what area covers frenchtown, turns out I spent some time there and found it quite alright. Guess I'm not too worried then. And yes Orlando is pretty sketchy at times."
Tallahassee,33auto,clearliquidclearjar,3,Tue Apr 21 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not actually bad at all. Maybe 20 years ago. And then, in the past decade, a large chunk of one edge got gentrified and they renamed it Levy Park so they could sell it to hipsters and young yuppies. I've had more friends get robbed near FSU than in Frenchtown."
Tallahassee,33auto,Manateekid,2,Tue Apr 21 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"You are giving some sound advice here, but I must protest, as a native. Levy park has had the same name forever, and that area was never part of Frenchtown."
Tallahassee,33auto,clearliquidclearjar,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but no. I used to live at the corner of MLK and 7th and on Milton in the 90s, and it was all just Frenchtown then. Levy Park was there, but it wasn't used as the name of the area."
Tallahassee,33auto,clearliquidclearjar,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"The 90's ? I've lived here since 1958.   So in other words, someone has started calling a huge area to the south of the park the 'levy park neighborhood'. Gotcha."
Tallahassee,33auto,allthetoes,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's how marketing works. I was born and raised here, lived in what was called Frenchtown as late as the late 90s and is currently considered part of the Levy Park neighborhood. 6th/7th, Milton, all that area."
Tallahassee,33auto,GloryHoleChamp69,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"Wow that's neat, when you say robbed... are we talking like gunpoint in broad daylight or more like pickpocketed and stuff?"

Tallahassee,33auto,cosmospring,3,Tue Apr 21 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"I rent a 1/1 guest house in Midtown for $600. If you have transportation, look away from the heavy undergrad areas.   The other points I can suggest: Get involved. We have a remarkable level of civic engagement, and a wide variety of volunteer opportunities. If you want to enjoy your city, become part of it and part of making it better.  Join a sport league. We have the traditional sports along with roller derby and kickball. You can't play roller derby, but we're always looking for refs.  Go outside. Tallahassee is nestled into nature. Get the Tally Parks app and start making the rounds.  Forget the girl. Seriously. You're 21. You have your whole life ahead of you. And it doesn't even get really good until about 28.  Best of luck to you, and welcome home. :)"

I just got done with my last semester here so I hopefully won't see her again, at least not regularly which makes it a lot easier, we had classes together... I'm honestly over her, just not over what she did, but I'm getting there.  I have a reliable car so I was hoping to ""commute"" and live a bit further out where prices drop, glad to see that's how it works, some cities it doesn't work like that. I really plan to get involved, not sure how yet but I'll see what's out there when I get there, I really like being part of something and meeting new people, just getting out there. Lately especially I've had a huge attitude change in life and love to just be happy and friendly and brighten people's days, which I'm sure will come in handy in tally. I love nature, hikes and long walks are great, as is the beach, glad to see Destin isn't as far as it is from where I currently reside.   Can't wait to find a nice apartment in my new home, I'm honestly amazed at how friendly, cheerful and welcoming most people in Tally are! :)"

Tallahassee,33auto,d0pemagik,2,Wed Apr 22 02:47:01 2015 UTC,"Some respones, in the order you brought them up: (1) I hear good things about the TCC-FSU pathways program; good luck to you. (2) If ""better than barracks"" is your expectation you can probably expect a 1br to start around $500 -- I pay $700ish for a 1br but I'm not sure they get any pricier than this place. (3) So many options; college bars, non-college bars, and a few that are a mix -- what's your preference? (4) There are two Big Purple Gyms that are both 24x7. No Aldi. Lolz to hearing crime is bad here. That's just straight-up funny. You sound like you will not experience Tally as unsafe. Weather -- yep. Anything else? If you're moving here in the Summer and it seems quiet and even boring, just wait until the Fall semester begins again. Enjoy."
Tallahassee,33auto,d0pemagik,1 point,Tue Apr 21 11:34:49 2015 UTC,"Excellent reply, thanks for that. Here's some more questions for you: (1) How did you find your 1BR?  (2) Options! I like that, around here right now it's pretty much the Gym and the Bowling alley, that's about it, so anything more than that and I promise I won't complain! Demographically it seems students make up about 50% of Tally's population so I'm pretty sure there's plenty of options, My preference doesn't really exist, I'm not a heavy drinker typically, but sometimes I like to ""get loose"". Most nights I'd rather just go to a festival or concert, watch some standup comedy or whatever. (3) Thanks for the Gyms, there seems to be a total of 3 Anytime's according to Google as of now, maybe I'll stick with that, I'll see when I get there. (4) No Aldi, that's a shame but life goes on. What About H&M and Old Navy? What's the shopping situation like as a whole around there?  Glad to hear crime is just blown out of proportion, truth be told most people who've addressed it are people that like to panic over nothing, but I thought I'd ask.  I went to Tally DURING spring break and it was pretty empty but I still really liked it, how busy is it really during a semester?  Thanks!"

Tallahassee,32t3oq,BoxofWhine,2,Thu Apr 16 14:32:24 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure what you're referring to is actually an Indian place. International bazaar? Edit: 10 seconds later I remember that India is in Asia....>.<.....but I don't think they would have mochi
Tallahassee,32t3oq,CorriByrne,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"Capital Seafood or Lynns or whatever its called this year. ""Asia"" is a big place. What exactly are you looking for because there are other places that specialize. Its like saying ""Is there an American market in town?"""

To answer your question, I guess the ""typical"" Asian countries one might think of like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, maybe Indian products would be what I am looking for. :) But I'm up for exploring others if you have suggestions! Thank you."
Tallahassee,32t3oq,CorriByrne,2,Thu Apr 16 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"Lynns has some mochi products and the certainly have the ingredients to make mochi- but that is work. Lynns has a pretty good selection of Japanese items but not much. I think I have found frozen Daifuku balls in the freezer section. Most of their product is Southern Asian-  Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, warm climate foods. I had the same problem when I was looking for handmade long noodles for New Years. I had to order online or try to make them myself- not. Its like finding New Orleans Gumbo spice instead of Mobile Gumbo spice. And don't ever confuse Japanese food with Chinese. Mon Deau. Actually I think I have Mame Diafuku in my freezer. Probably need to throw those out."

Tallahassee,322liw,chapstickninja,5,Fri Apr 10 08:01:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Been a daredevil for 20 years with no accident. I'd say it's not the speeders that cause the majority of accidents. It's been proven in multiple studies. I'd say it's the drowsy, drunk, texting, or distracted drivers that cause your accidents. If you're paying attention then you probably won't cause an accident whether your a defensive or offensive driver."
Tallahassee,322liw,sarge101st,2,Sun Apr 12 12:25:20 2015 UTC,"Texting drivers are the worst around here, though I'd guess it's probably a problem everywhere. I've missed countless green lights because someone was texting and didn't bother to go.  I've seen so many people weaving over the lines, and when you pull up next to them eventually they're looking at their phone.  So frustrating, I mean, do you really need to reply back to texts while you're driving?"
Tallahassee,322liw,BALDASSHOLE,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:29:39 2015 UTC,I agree. I feel that distracted driving is our most dangerous traffic issue in this country over speeding or drinking and driving. Look up the AAA sponsored footage of recorded video in vehicles of teenagers who were on their phones while driving. It's not only teens either. It's rampant with everyone.
Tallahassee,322liw,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:12:13 2015 UTC,Exactly the answer I was looking for. Thanks for stopping by.

It's always a fun B movie, uncut - Kevin Cole, the man in charge, has a taste for horror, but he mixes in other excellenterrible stuff. Lots of talking to the movie, very MST3K vibe. Plus, some of the best burgers and grouper sandwiches in the area."

Tallahassee,30yt09,clearliquidclearjar,2,Tue Mar 31 20:51:03 2015 UTC,"As a Buck Lake resident I'm looking forward to it if they do as they promised. Wanting to keep the development stagnant based on the past isn't going to make live oaks pop out of the ground. The best option now is to see it developed into a outdoor center that can attract more sole location stores (in Tallahassee) like Bass Pro and Costco.  I'd be nice to have a east-side theater, but right now it sounds like there isn't and never was an agreement between Cobb and the developer to build one here.   I could see it attracting more upscale national restaurants based on the relatively close proximity to the interstate. Something like a Cheesecake Factory is probably asking for to much. Heck, I'd settle for a Red Robin. Food options are rather limited on east Mahan."

Tallahassee,30fizp,thug_life4,2,Mon Mar 30 13:19:46 2015 UTC,You probably want to contact some of the property management companies in town who can show you places that will become available in July or August.

And in the end, my son has had an apartment to himself, with a landlord he likes who is fair and helpful, close to school.  Minutes door-to-door to class on his bike and no parking hassle at school.

Tallahassee,30a5gj,SITB,24,Wed Mar 25 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"I also moved from Madison for grad school 2 years ago.   You know the one freak set of 5 days in the Summer where it gets to be in the high 90s and super humid? It feels like that in Tallahasse from mid-May to August. Surprisingly though, I see very few mosquitos compared to the hellhole Wisconsin can be in that regard during the late Summer.  In WI, when rain comes through, it comes in as a long line that approaches your area then continues on in the same direction until it's passed. In Tallahassee, patches of rain appear out of thin air and disappear in different parts of the city. It will be raining on one side of the campus and be sunny on the other side. This happens every day July thru August. You wouldn't be caught in WI without snow boots; you shouldn't be caught here without a good set of rain gear.  Tallahassee is a lot like Madison in sense that it's a smallish city which holds the seat of the state government and a major research university. Life tends to revolve around one or the other. Madison is significantly more quirky than Tallahassee but Tally has its charm if you look hard enough. The airport is regional like Madison, so expect the same limited schedules and high airfare.  Frenchtown is the Allied Drive of Tallahassee. The south side of town is equivalent to Park St. near the Beltline. Railroad Circle is Tally's Willy Street. Unfortunately, there is no State Street equivalent. Also, if you like craft beer, Proof is pretty much the only established local operation(Edit see below, there's Momo's and now Grasslands), so the city is sorely lacking compared to all the breweries that dot around Dane county.  Duval, Bronough, and Monroe are kind of like the University Ave and E Washington of Tallahassee. They get clogged during rush hour as everyone travels to/from downtown. Capital Circle, which loops around the city, has significantly less bumper-to-bumper backups than your typical Beltline rush hour.  For roaches, get some of these, and make sure to replace them on schedule. We rarely see roaches, and then usually only in our garage and only when we forget to put down new traps.  Get to know some outdoor activities that are within 1-1.5 hr drive. I recommend Wakulla Springs, Apalachicola National Forest, and St. George Island.  Like arts & crafts, antiques, and ""foodie"" restaurants? Try Thomasville, GA 45 mins. across the border. Speaking of the border, you have to go to GA if you want your precious 40 oz bottles of beer. Those aren't allowed for sale in FL. However, liquor stores in FL are open til midnight or 1 as opposed to the 9PM law in WI."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,DrSandbags,13,Wed Mar 25 20:47:27 2015 UTC,"The Proof statement is incorrect - We've been brewing beer at Momo's longer than Proof has. Also there's Grasslands brewery just opened, and their house brews will be on tap once they get their license."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,ellers23,2,Wed Mar 25 23:29:45 2015 UTC,"You are indeed correct, and I should have remembered that because I now remember going to Momo's on the northside once and trying their IPA. I just looked up Grasslands. It's great that we have another brewery popping up. Hopefully the area gets a brewer big enough some day that does widespread off-site retail sales."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,DrSandbags,2,Thu Mar 26 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hope so too. The difficult part is the way Florida law is changing for craft beers/breweries. For us (at Momo's), we can't distribute our beer or sell growlers because we're a restaurant. Apparently you have to pick one or the other - brewery or restaurant with house brews."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,ellers23,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"That blows, but at least you guys are making good stuff!"
Tallahassee,30a5gj,clydefrog811,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:12:12 2015 UTC,No one knows that though. You should advertise it.

Tallahassee,30a5gj,burnblister,11,Thu Mar 26 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"Proof is not the only established craft beer bar. It is probably the only one close to campus. Leon Pub (on 6th Ave) established itself years before Proof opened. There is also Brass Tap (in Mid Town) they've got 70+ beers on tap. There's also the Fermentation Lounge.  They've got a smaller (7-12?), but constantly rotating selection of craft beer. Try a beer with a large soft pretzel!  We also have annual October Fests that are held in the All-Saints area. We even have an annual Beer Fest that's held at the Car Museum. Don't tell me that we don't have an established beer scene!"

Tallahassee,30a5gj,alifelessordinary,3,Mon Mar 30 21:10:47 2015 UTC,Touching on your last point about liquor - grocery stores can't sell liquor so Publix and Costco will have separate attachments where they sell all their liquor. That was a really weird experience for me coming from California/Illinois. Basically I did a lot of circling around in Costco until I finally asked someone where the vodka was.

Granted, its much safer than a bad neighborhood in Chicago, but it's not somewhere I'd want to be walking around at midnight.  Overall I am indeed happy with my decision. It's nice to experience another part of the country and get a feel for a little different culture. More liberally-minded people might find the southeastern US a little backwards, but Tally is a little bit more of a progressive oasis.

(There are the German roaches too, and boy can they get out of control fast.)  My only other advise: Get used to being sweaty. Just remember though, when the winter comes around you can call friends and family in the great white north, and describe how nice and warm it is down here, while they are chiseling away at the ice trying to get into their cars."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,CWill039,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"I'm from MN originally. My SO and I bought a house a year ago in Tallahasse and we realized that we weren't really prepared for what it takes to take care of a house here (if you rent a house). We had a background where the main problem was snow. Here, you really have to make sure your house stays at about 50% humidity so you don't have any issues with bugs (like termites) or mold. We now pay attention to our dehumidifier much more closely (I was pretty lax with it before and didn't know that air conditioners needs to be on 'auto' and not 'fan' for the dehumidification properties to work). Also, there are very few basements here and the ones that do exist often have water problems. We didn't end up buying a house with a basement, but we had really wanted one because that's what we thought was normal coming from the midwest. Also ALLERGIES. I never had allergies in my life until I got here. Right now the ground is covered in a layer of bright green pollen. That's all I can think of now. Oh, and instead of hearing MN/WI accents you're going to hear southern accents. Much like in the midwest, it'll catch your attention when you hear a really thick one."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,BlueSapphyre,2,Wed Mar 25 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"The green pollen (I think it's yellow) is from the pine trees and annoying but harmeless.  The bad stuff is the invisible oak dander.  The humidity takes getting used to (and by getting used to, I mean spending a couple of months at your vacation house in the North Georgia mountains) and roach's are a minor problem."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Thu Mar 26 11:41:47 2015 UTC,"That's great to know, I'm  used to the snow and basements as well.

Tallahassee,30a5gj,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:42:47 2015 UTC,"As an undergrad, its great. There are niches for grad students, but some people struggle with either finding friends or finding things to do. If you enjoy casually drinking with friends and like outdoorsy things you'll be fine here. Appalachian national forest close by, lots of state parks.  There are roaches in florida, just happens. They're actually usually palmetto bugs, those are the big ones. But it's not terrible, find one dead every once in a while. Don't need to get a raid key chain or anything lol.   And like someone said before, it gets very hot. I can't really comment because I'm so used to it, but if coming from a cold state might be a bit of an adjustment. DrSandBags explanation was a good summary.  For rent, don't bother with the ""luxury"" student living all around campus. They are ridiculously overpriced, cater to undergrads, and are built so quickly. You're better off renting a house around campus or living like 8-10 minutes out and getting a quieter less expensive but nicer apartment."
Tallahassee,30a5gj,GloryHoleChamp69,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:05:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Any thoughts on how bikeable of a city it is?
Tallahassee,30a5gj,barkomarx,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the major roads have bike lanes, and many places have bike racks.  Unfortunately many of the more scenic routes that I would prefer to bike are very dangerous (no bike lane, no shoulder).  But getting from point A to B is manageable depending on where you live.  TLH has four quadrants, basically (NE, NW, SE, SW).  Try to live and work within one of them, and you'll have everything you need within biking distance.  But if you live outside campus area, you'll probably find it difficult to navigate back and forth across town."

Most people down here are great, and that includes those that fly confederate flags and whatnot.  Almost no one would hassle you because of your skin color.  In fact, the only place I have ever seen someone harassed because of their skin was in Somerville (an upscale suburb of Boston) where a guy was following a muslim woman and her daughter calling them terrorists.    That's not to say there aren't sketchy people and places to avoid, just that the stereotypical, dangerous, confederate racists are few and far between. There are definitely places to avoid.  The south side of Tallahassee definitely has its rougher areas.  The Orange Blossom Trail area in Orlando is very sketchy.    Generally keep an eye out for trashy areas and you'll be fine."
Tallahassee,303vkq,gonzoforpresident,3,Tue Mar 24 07:20:53 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.  It's just like anywhere else you go - most cities and towns are going to have sections that are sketchy and high in crime.  In Tallahassee, that's mainly the south side, although I'd still be careful around the campuses.    Even the Florida panhandle, which is where I spent way too much of my childhood, isn't quite as backwoods and redneck as it used to be.  Very friendly people."

I've never really encountered racism or heard it from my friends spanning l different kinds of races and nationalities. Even people who still wear or fly confederate flags aren't racist, they just have ""Southern Pride"". I consider Florida a very accepting state. You have nothing to worry about,  you'll probably be pleasantly surprised. However,  some of the places you listed are rather boring... maybe I'm jaded from living here most of my life but if I were you I would skip Tampa and Orlando and Naples and spend more time in Key West.

The Bookmine used to have readings and such (is it still open?)  For educational activities, Mary Brogan, Challenger Learning Center, Tallahassee museum, FSU Marine lab. The senior center has language, dancing, and knitting/embroidery classes.  Publix Aprons, Kitchenable, and New Leaf Co-op all have cooking classes. Bella Bella has food/wine pairings with some frequency, Smashing Olive too. There is a farmer's market at Timberlane Square every weekend in the summer, another one in front of the downtown library, and U-pick farms around the outskirts of town.  Wakulla Springs, St. Marks, and Apalachicola National Forest are all within a 45 minute drive for hiking/camping/fishing/kayaking.

Tallahassee,2zkywm,ILIEKDEERS,19,Thu Mar 19 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"I was raised in Wakulla county, and have lived in Tallahassee since adolescence. I have travelled the U.S. fairly extensively as a touring musician, and have spent time exploring some of the coolest (and not so cool) cities the country has to offer.   Tallahassee has provided me every opportunity I have ever sought, and in the setting of the veritable paradise on earth that is North West Florida.   I have the trade of tattooing (which, thankfully, is popular here), a small business (check out Liberty Bar and Restaurant, winner of a 2015 Tally award for best nightlife!), fulfilling hobbies, and a wonderful group of friends.   The weather as good as can be found anywhere in the country.   The ocean, rivers, and springs are a short distance from home.   There is an abundance of natural splendor in the outlying areas.   What we don't have is: a major traffic problem, a major crime problem, cost of living inflation associated with larger cities, high unemployment, or a pollution problem.  I hope this next part doesn't sound judgmental, because it isn't intended to be.   I find that sometimes whenever a person finds a city to be boring because of its lack of entertainment or bars/nightlife, what they are really looking for is a distraction from developing themselves and their interests.   But it sounds like you have spent enough time here to know whether or not Tallahassee is a good fit for you.   Where else have you thought to live?  Edit: spelling"
Tallahassee,2zkywm,taconole,2,Thu Mar 19 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"First off let me say, Liberty is an amazing bar and I would miss it incredibly if/when I leave. And to further give you credit, I can't deny that this town also represents my failings of outside opportunities (the place you apply to is always better than the place you are.) That said as a 25 year old a ton of friends come and go when you are in a college town and that in it of itself can be truly sad.   Tallahassee, for all the reasons you mentioned, would be an amazing place to settle down. Right now, I really want to see what this country/world has to offer and Tallahassee can only give so much. Truthfully I would like to land in a bigger city. Meeting people constantly is tough in Tallahassee (college town and people constantly leaving), and it is incredibly a small town.   I think Tallahassee is a great place for college and 35+ crowd, but for a single 25 year old. This place can get old fast."

As a person who actually does keep up with quite a few officers I can say that we do have a crime problem, but considering we are also the most economically segregated city in the US it might not be present in your location. Per capita we are just as dangerous in parts of our city as you would assume your other listed cities are. Just because YOU haven't been mugged or sucker punched doesn't mean the city is Scot free."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,TwisterFister,6,Fri Mar 20 10:41:47 2015 UTC,"Scot free.  Well, we are most definitely not Scott free."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,mbltlh,4,Fri Mar 20 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"Nor did I say it was Scot free (how could it be? we're overrun with Scots). But I have lived in actual cities, and Tally is pretty dang safe. The stats are skewed because they include crimes by and on college kids, but their numbers aren't counted in our population, which drops us by about 50,000 people. I lived right downtown for the last ten years and regularly walked, drove, or hung out through some of the poorer parts of town, and it's just not all that bad."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,allthetoes,0,Fri Mar 20 16:43:59 2015 UTC,Its pretty arrogant to assume you are important enough to be the only statistic worth citing. I've had numerous non student friends robbed downtown. Just because it hasn't happed to you doesn't mean its impossible.
Tallahassee,2zkywm,datCUNTmane,4,Fri Mar 20 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"You realize this has gone from ""Our murder rate is really fucking bad"" (the comment I responded to) to ""people get robbed."" Which, yes, no one's debating that."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,coolbuns,-1,Fri Mar 20 17:19:46 2015 UTC,Our murder rate is bad though. Its not my job to educate you on growing crime rate and 15 years of no police growth while our population grows steadily. Just because you're privileged and haven't experienced it doesn't mean you're the only view.
Tallahassee,2zkywm,coolbuns,6,Fri Mar 20 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"I moved here from south Florida for school in 2007. I moved away twice (Gainesville for grad school, Atlanta for a job) and have happily found my way back. I really, really, really, enjoy living here. Like someone else said, the outdoor splendor of North Florida (springs. need I say more?), coupled with the small-ish population (light traffic, things are affordable mostly) is my ideal.  I lived here in 2007 when the economy collapsed. Tallahassee is on the right path to being a great little city (I've seen it compared to Greenville in South Carolina in terms of economic development potential relative to population size), but if you desire bigger things you should leave. It's never going to be a NYC, Seattle, Chicago, Atlanta, or even touch Austin.   I will agree that it is hard to make friends. If you haven't lived here forever, and don't have children, your circle can be small. I prefer this, but I do worry because my close circle doesn't intend to stay here for the long haul. Either way, I am comfortable here and I know what it is like to live in an anxiety induced state due to being unhappy with where you live. If that's the case for you, change it, you'll thank yourself."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,tercerero,6,Thu Mar 19 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"I love this city. We have wonderful parks, increasingly neat food and beverage options, and a budding civic engagement sector. I serve on a couple boards and meet cool people who are passionate about their work. Our local leadership is accessible and seems committed to improving the city for all of its residents. There are great local sports leagues. And there are lots of places to hang a hammock.   I hated it when I moved here. I was post grad and not interested in undergrad culture. And now I've built a great life for myself. And this city just keeps getting better."

Tallahassee,2zkywm,Every1sFriend,5,Fri Mar 20 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"I've lived in South Florida, Savannah, GA, California, and spent two summers in Alaska... I moved here permanently five years ago. I remember when I used to drink a lot it was great, but now that I'm not into the bar scene anymore it seems to be lacking. There are a lot of good things to do outdoors and by yourself if you're an introvert, but I imagine if you enjoy spending time indoors or in the heart of downtown that it can seem a little lonely at times. I just got back from LA and for the first few days back here I spent a lot of time crying and wallowing and feeling like this place is a dead-end. I think I'm coming out of it now and trying to see the beauty in the old growth trees and... that's about it. I can empathize with how you feel completely. Tallahassee is small and slow but you have to seek out what it has to offer, there are plenty of hidden gems."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,wmccluskey,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"With that attitude you might get downvoted. All joking aside, I see what you are saying. I have my moments of introvertedness and it this town is wonderful, but when I want to explore socially... it simply lacks."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,tercerero,2,Fri Mar 20 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"It was looking down on Tallahassee as the plane was landing and seeing nothing but mobile homes from above.  Something about it depressed me. I know Tallahassee is more than that and that my sights had everything to do with the location of our podunk-y airport but... even the town I lived in in Alaska was only a mile long by twenty blocks but with its whale sightings and the fjord and the mountains, there was so much natural beauty that you didn't need the material satisfactions of malls or movie theatres. But here I'm like, ""guess I'll hike the sink holes for the millionth fucking time.""   I'm not going to pretend that outlookhas nothing to do withpersonal satisfaction but I do believe people outgrow their surroundings. We're not fresh 21 year olds anymore.  It's not fun to stay out until 4am and battle a hangover the next day. We can't do fast food for every meal anymore.  Being ""seen"" provides no satisfaction,  and beyond those things it's tough to feel fulfilled here. Plus, it's a college town, it's as if everyone around you stays 19-22 while you just get older. It's surreal and it's very easy to feel purgatoried here.  I don't care if I get downvoted."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,mimmotoast,8,Fri Mar 20 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"It's true: this place is great for college students and families.  At the stage you're in between these, and there's not a lot for you.  It sucks to be single and ages 25-35 in this town.  Many people end up staying here because they get a job and/or meet someone & start a family and then it's more difficult to relocate.  BUT, this town is miles and above in what is has to offer even just in the past five years.  You have much more to do than I did at your age & stage."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,wmccluskey,-1,Thu Mar 19 14:17:11 2015 UTC,"I've been here 7 years (I was 18) and I can agree this place has been better, but certainly not incredible."

Tallahassee,2zkywm,RyanTally,10,Thu Mar 19 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're depressed from your failed applications, not because of Tallahassee.  Have you ever heard the saying ""only boring people are bored?"" The same is true with depression. Tallahassee has tremendous opportunity for excitement, but nothing is going to seen exciting when you're depressed.  Make some friends!  In college you were surrounded with people your age, and forced into activities with then. Now you're just on your own.  Find groups with similar interests through meetup.com, then branch out. Volunteering helps, too.  In all seriousness, what do you feel Tallahassee is lacking? Aside from snow sports, I can't think of anything you can't do here.  And if you want something here, why don't you start it yourself?"
Tallahassee,2zkywm,dimera99,-3,Thu Mar 19 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"I feel it is lacking a unified citizenship. No one seems happy to be here truthfully. Most people I have met are either looking to leave or not happy here at all. I do not feel as though I am alone in this feeling. A minority takes pride in Tallahassee while the rest are using it as a launch pad. It pretends to be bike friendly, but we have ghost bikes everywhere. There is no real outlet for young professionals. No real career mobility. And if you don't like football, your screwed in the fall. And if you do like football, you only really have the fall. There isn't much to do around here other than look old at the college scenes, or look too young at the other activities."

Are there any sports you do enjoy?  The ultimate frisbee club is pretty cool, too.  With springtime here, I enjoy the festival and the reopening of the farmer's market, but I'm old, so you probably won't enjoy those things too."

Get off your ass, and do something."
Tallahassee,2zkywm,BlueSapphyre,-2,Thu Mar 19 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"Man this was possibly the rudest thing to say since you have no idea what I do. Way to represent your community and look like a complete asshat. Yes I play sports, my friend campaigned for the mayor (Gillum). I have been to scores of talks and have actually given some myself. Festivals, gee too many to count but they tend to be the same EVERY YEAR (Springtime Tallahassee has never changed in the 7 years I have attended). Lets get real here, this city is not built for my age group, it simply isn't. Many have agreed with me on this thread, so I know I am not completely insane when bringing this up.   And I do ""get off [my] ass and do something"" all the time. From sports, to concerts, to festivals, to musical performances I have given this city a shot. Those are not what makes a city great, any city can have those activities. Hence the title, ""What makes this place so great"". My point is it is stale here. You can only play in the same damn flag football league over and over until it becomes boring. As a young adult, Tallahassee can tire itself out quickly and that is the point I am trying to make. Your lack of decorum in this thread has made my opinion worse not to mention the barrage of downvotes on almost every comment I have had despite being very understanding and even agree with some people.   I was looking for a discussion not an attack on my character. I have lived in this city for 7 years so I think I have a small clue of what I am talking about. If any other commenters are reading this, thank you for your kind responses and level headed suggestions. But to /u/wmccluskey... use some tact when on these message boards."

I think your friend Andrew would tell you that straight up. Can't run from your own problems though. Being content is hard work. People are going to be defensive to a post like this. I don't know why you would not expect that. I'm sorry you don't enjoy the town anymore. I hear Detroit is hiring people just like you. Go be cold and get robbed up there? Lol jk.

Tallahassee,2z6htv,PhobiaFaye,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:42:07 2015 UTC,I checked Craigslist this weekend and there were 30+ yard sales listed just within Tallahassee for Saturday.
Tallahassee,2z6htv,tallasassy850,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:23:45 2015 UTC,Are you sure they were yard sales? Alot of local thrift stores put their ads in there.
Tallahassee,2z6htv,tallasassy850,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yep! It's true that there are ads for thrift stores and junk holes but there were a ton of ads with residential addresses, pics of some stuff, or lists of stuff they'd have at their sale. I suppose each weekend can be hit or miss, but I was out and about this past weekend and there were lots."
Tallahassee,2z10cc,charlie20010,3,Sat Mar 14 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"If you do go with that place, consider getting the black out shades. They can make a difference."
Tallahassee,2z10cc,TheLoveofDoge,2,Sat Mar 14 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the house. I have lived in places that would freeze you out with just a window unit and some that could never catch up from the sun baking on the bricks outside.   If the place has shade during the day and isn't totally exposed to the afternoon sun, it is going to be better than one that has the sun beating down.  The wind stops in the summer here, so it gets hotter than it does down south.  Ceiling fans are your friend in the summer, central ac or not. If you can, ask questions about it to the landlord, or a neighbor if you can to get some more insight into it."
Tallahassee,2z10cc,blindythepirate,2,Sat Mar 14 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"Its a tiny 1952 old florida home, up on stilts and plenty of windows. It has a giant tree that covers up most of the roof (when it has leaves) so i guess im going to be in pretty good shape?"
Tallahassee,2z10cc,VolatileAngel,4,Sat Mar 14 18:53:44 2015 UTC,You should be fine. Simple fans and heaters are cheap if it comes to it.
Tallahassee,2z10cc,rolls20s,2,Sat Mar 14 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"Multiple factors - size (BTUs) of the window unit, size (sq ft) of the room(s) to be cooled, quality of insulation, how willing you are to put up with the noise, and whether or not the window unit has an automatic thermostat and if not, how willing you are to manually adjust it regularly. Without some sort of AC, the humidity will kill you in the summer. Not at breezy as it is towards the coast."
Tallahassee,2z10cc,SalgarandPepper,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:52:07 2015 UTC,How big is the place and how many window units are there? I grew up in a house in Panama City that only had window units. It was pretty reasonable but we had a unit in every single room except the bathroom.

Tallahassee,2z10cc,chapstickninja,1 point,Sat Mar 14 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"Probably fine. Maybe get a fan if necessary to move to cold air to other rooms. You won't get as much of a breeze as So Fla, though."
Tallahassee,2z10cc,chapstickninja,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"I think if the place is small you'll probably be ok.  You might want to check the age of the window unit though, I know older ones might not work as well, since they may be low on refrigerant, or have other issues.  Older units probably wouldn't be as energy efficient either, so you might have a high utility bill.   I would suggest going to visit the place and seeing how well it works, I don't think that would be an unreasonable request to the landlord given how hot it gets in the summer."

Tallahassee,2z10cc,mrsmetalbeard,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"We moved to Tally from the Midwest (and then back again a couple years later). When we were there, we were shocked to get our first electric bill for over $400 because we had run the A/C ""so much"" because the weather felt so hot and humid to us. However, we quickly adapted to keeping the thermostat at 85 degrees and just ran fans at night. I think you'll be fine."

Tallahassee,2yomjd,GloryHoleChamp69,0,Wed Mar 11 20:03:26 2015 UTC,i always wanted to explore all those drainage ditches around south side. Some go underground.
Tallahassee,2ymyi1,clearliquidclearjar,5,Wed Mar 11 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"They got built seconds before the bubble burst. Obsolete before the first people moved in. But I believe the original plan for the Kleman Plaza condos was to market them to FSU and FAMU alums who wanted to throw big parties for football games. Here's an article about it.  Also, they didn't plan for nearly enough parking for the Tennyson (N.Monroe near the Capitol), assuming that people would be willing to park downtown and walk. (Hint: they are not.) It sucks, too, because (as Tally is prone to do) they knocked down the cool old library building to built the damn things."
Tallahassee,2ymyi1,StrikerObi,2,Wed Mar 11 03:36:52 2015 UTC,"They were really expecting $400k for a 3-bedroom suite? Even the one-bedroom condo at $160k costs more than my 3-bedroom, 1500 sqft house did (though to be fair I bought my house at the absolute bottom of the local housing market in 2012).  But now Gaines St is done and starting to thrive, creating the 18-hour downtown that Mayor Marks hoped these condos would. Maybe now that this part of town is far more appealing than it was in 2005, there will be renewed interest in these condos? Perhaps a successful manager could resurrect them? I hope so."
Tallahassee,2ymyi1,clearliquidclearjar,2,Wed Mar 11 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"You don't remember the pre-crash prices? Completely insane. The median price of a new home in 2005 was around $250K.

Don't think that leabing tally will solve your problem, it gets harder as you age. I will admit I hate how too often people only associate tally with partying. ..I hate that!"
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,jugzeh,7,Sun Mar 8 05:00:01 2015 UTC,"Tallahassee native here - confirming that it can be difficult to find people who try to socialize in a non-drinking environment.  What sorts of people are 'your people'?  I may not be the one who has the information you need, but I think the community could better address your question if we knew a bit better what you're looking for."
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,Luthwyhn,6,Sun Mar 8 04:23:04 2015 UTC,People who generally do not rely on substances as a part of their socialization.
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,CFCinUS,2,Sun Mar 8 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"Idk if Grad students usually join clubs but they'd be a good way to meet people. If you're religious, it should be fairly easy to find people who don't rely on substances in the religious organizations on campus.  You mentioned doing outdoorsy things. You may want to look into outdoor pursuits or consider look into joining an IM team. Really, joining any group that your interested in is a good way to just get out there and meet people and maybe you'll find a non-partying group that you like"
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,Derstn,3,Sun Mar 8 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"You're right, I didn't really clarify what I'm looking for. I guess I'm just trying to find other young adults/professionals here who like to do outdoorsy things, see live music, and even go to a bar every now and then, but not to get wasted."
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,SalgarandPepper,3,Sun Mar 8 04:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in this boat. I'm 26, have a solid career and responsibilities, but everyone I know is still partying like they're 21.  I don't get out much other than a few nights a month. Everything here really does seem to revolve around drinking and being anything but sober.  If you're into shooting, or would like to learn let me know. It's the only thing that keeps me sane."
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,doki36,1 point,Sun Mar 8 08:17:59 2015 UTC,How do you feel about disc golf? I don't play personally but my SO knows quite a few people who belong to little clubs that meet at Tom Brown regularly to play. They are usually late 20s/early 30s in the stage of life you seem to be. Could be a good way to get outdoors and meet people.
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,Darthchicken,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I'm late to the party but I clicked on your thread because I'm in basically the same boat. I've been in Tally for just over a year. I'm a mid-20s outdoorsy girl who is also over the ""let's get wasted"" phase of life (though I do enjoy a craft beer now and then). I'm a little shy, but if you like we can meet up sometime."

Tallahassee,2yb3sz,gimanswirve,2,Thu Mar 12 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"Try out fermentation lounge. It's a bar but it's usually full of grad students and it really isn't the type of bar to get wasted.  Go to the FSU reservation to meet out doorsy people. There's kayaking, canoeing, rock climbing and a bunch of other stuff.    Go to the Inter fields. Usually full of people playing soccer or other sports, really easy to make friends there."

Tallahassee,2yb3sz,whereisthecake,2,Sun Mar 8 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"The post sounds as if I wrote it. I'm also a Masters student at FSU. I enjoy beer and cocktails, but I don't like to go out and get drunk, per say. I enjoy the conversation more than the drinking. I can't tell you how many times I've said that I can't find ""my people"" here. You sound like my kind of person.  The Masters degree is very isolating. I'm trying to finish up mine now, and I've never felt more alone in my entire life, especially since I don't have many real friends here.  Why don't we meet up? :) I'll be your friend. I know exactly what you're going through because I feel the same way on a daily basis.  Edit: My boyfriend is pretty much the only reason I've gotten through mine. A good support system is imperative."
Tallahassee,2yb3sz,BlueSapphyre,2,Sun Mar 8 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"If you have time that could be filled by social relationships,  it means you aren't spending enough time on your research.  Your major professor would be displeased.   In seriousness, I've found a few strategies very helpful.    talk to your professors and peers,  and see what they're doing when they aren't on campus find out about relevant academic extracurriculars - groups formed around particular topics or projects meet people from outside of your program - you'll find the best friends are often interdisciplinary get off campus and into the community, volunteer with groups that have relevance to your interests become a regular somewhere (a gym,  a coffee shop, a running trail, etc.) and talk to the other regulars"

Tallahassee,2yb3sz,allthetoes,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"Tallahassee is tough for newcomers because, outside of those who temporarily move here for school, a lot of Tallahassee's community and social network is built from people who've known each other since high school/middle school and stayed in town well into college or grad school. This makes it very difficult for outsiders to make friends when they're new here.   On campus, you might want to spend time at FSU's Student Life Center (SLC). It's one of the easier places to get to know people on campus and if you're somewhat geeky you'll find like-minded people.   Off-campus, frequenting an established local coffee shop is also a decent way to discover a fairly welcoming community of people."

Tallahassee,2yaxdc,Honkey_Cat,3,Sun Mar 8 12:55:31 2015 UTC,"Not a lake, but if you go down to St. Marks and park next to the old fort there, go into the fort grounds (either through the gate or over the fence if it is closed) and take the trail to the left through a small marshy area, it leads to a really nice spot to sit and watch the river. There might be people there fishing, but usually it's quiet. I've been asked to leave once by a random park guy, because they were closed, but that is once in dozens of visits, and he was pretty chill about it."
Tallahassee,2yaxdc,clearliquidclearjar,2,Sun Mar 8 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"Go late and park outside the gate at silver lake, hop the gate. Bring a female and an ice chest and watch the stars. If you're quiet on the walk there the folks that live in the house there won't bother you. I go there every now and again, chill place."
Tallahassee,2yaxdc,jugzeh,2,Sun Mar 8 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"Pensacola west past capital circle, left on Aenon Church rd (flashing lights there). It'll eventually turn into a dirt road. Continue maybe a mile and the road will end at a T and stop sign. If you go right, you'll end up on Silver lake rd and pass Silver Lake on your right. But if you go left, then take either your first or second left (I don't remember which, it's been a while), you'll get to Moore Cypress pond. Great place for a bonfire, and I've even camped out there on several occasions."

Tallahassee,2y6axd,Sarge2552,3,Fri Mar 6 21:02:59 2015 UTC,"It would be MUCH more economical of you to get unfurnished. They charge you so much more each month for that furniture and you could easily get stuff on FSU free and for sale (fb group) around the time you move in for cheaper since everyone is trying to sell their stuff when moving.   I live in a 1/1 that is 540 but is unfurnished. I found it through a realtor company, doesn't really have a complex name it's just a little cola sack. It's like 7 minutes away from campus and is nice, really love it. They exist, but it took me A LOT of effort to find this place. I looked endlessly for weeks. Check out craisglist and just look online. Don't stick to larger well known complexes because they'll charge you much more for that all that clubhouse nonsense."
Tallahassee,2y6axd,tb3648,2,Tue Mar 10 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"This is all really good advice, but I have to admit that ""cola sack"" cracked me up. I may start calling them that, but it's actually cul-de-sac. Then again, that's just French for ""bottom of a sack"", so close enough."

They have cheap properties all over. They tend to be older places and a little shabby, but I stayed in mine for ten years before I suddenly wanted something bigger.

Tallahassee,2xxlqi,andsaca,2,Thu Mar 5 01:27:51 2015 UTC,HYPE TRAIN COMING THROUGH
Tallahassee,2xxlqi,BlueSapphyre,-8,Thu Mar 5 07:27:02 2015 UTC,I left LoL a couple months back to play Heroes of the Storm. I enjoy Heroes so much more since the team play is much more significant and it's near impossible for a single person to carry a crappy team.
Tallahassee,2xytd9,allsaintsapt,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, I edited my comment with some updated information. If you think stretching to $900 would be difficult, you should know that the renters are currently are advertising this place for $1250/month for the lease that starts in August. I just don't want to waste your time if you guys planned on staying beyond the summer months.  We will be moved out by the end of this month, but the renters will need a week or so to install the wood flooring. So mid-April is roughly when it would be available, and we could determine a more specific date if you're still really interested.  The washer/dryer came with the place and is staying.  The deposit depends on your application. In taking on my lease, we go through the leasing office to do paperwork so you'd fill out an application like any new tenant. The deposit will likely be based on your credit and renter's history.  I have a cat. I believe there was a one-time pet fee of a couple hundred bucks to begin with. Let me know if you're still seriously considering the place and we can figure something out."
Tallahassee,2xytd9,Pixelgin,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:20:38 2015 UTC,Yeah unfortunately I was sold on the $900. $1250 is a rather steep increase and falls outside of my budget range.  If they change their mind on the pricing or would let someone rent at the current price let me know. The place sounds great.
Tallahassee,2xwrra,e5c4p3,2,Wed Mar 4 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"I don't bike, but have you looked into the bike club in Tallahassee?  Capital City Cyclists - http://cccyclists.org/  You may be able to find a riding buddy or group through them."
Tallahassee,2xwrra,Honkey_Cat,2,Wed Mar 4 17:29:39 2015 UTC,I haven't looked into them.  thanks I will check them out.
Tallahassee,2xwrra,whabt,2,Wed Mar 4 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"Check out the Tallahassee mountain bike association!  We do beginner rides every Sunday. Beginner just means no drop; there's usually singletrack/ multi-use options and the rides are pretty intense workouts (10-16 off road miles).  The rides rotate between... 6? different trails in town. The next two weekends will be a little sparse because of the fat tire festival at Santos, but it's a great way to get to know some good people and hit the different trails in town.  You should be able to find the ride events on fb, but let me know if not so I can link it later (on my phone at the moment)."
Tallahassee,2xwrra,whabt,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:17:36 2015 UTC,That would be cool.  thanks!

Tallahassee,2xu9lv,CorriByrne,2,Tue Mar 3 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"Old St. Augustine Road (roughly, southeast of the Governor's Square Mall) is a good area. Augustine Club, St. Augustine Hills are two good apartment complexes I know of."
Tallahassee,2xu9lv,das_thorn,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:33:37 2015 UTC,I used to live roughly in this area. It's totally fine. Nothing more or less.
Tallahassee,2xu9lv,StrikerObi,2,Wed Mar 4 03:25:16 2015 UTC,"Tanglewood at Pullen and Old Bainbridge (near I10 and Monroe).  Pretty good management and decent rates.  The buildings are old, but liveable.  And they're pet friendly."
Tallahassee,2xu9lv,Calyn-dur,1 point,Wed Mar 4 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"Not in midtown, but Tally Square Apartments over by Governer's Square Mall is nice. Recently updated apartments (within the last year), in my experience it's quiet, affordable for the area, no nasty bugs, the management is very kind, and maintenance is always quick to help out. Only ~10 min drive to the stadium area of FSU's campus.  http://www.aspensquare.com/florida/tallahassee/apartments/tally-square"

Both of them have properties in the areas you're interested in: http://www.4renttallahassee.com/ & http://www.frankgomezrentals.com/  Edit: Also almost all of the property management companies in town have leases starting in August, so a lot of what will open up this summer isn't necessarily listed yet."
Tallahassee,2xu9lv,mrsmetalbeard,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"Why are you only looking at apartment complexes?  There are plenty of actual houses for rent if you have 2 roommates already lined up.  Hotpads.com is a good resource if you know what neighborhood you want.  Your friends are active duty military and they are worried about a sketchy neighborhood?  Outside of Bond, deep Frenchtown and Elberta Empire I can't think of many neighborhoods that sketchy.  Another area that is not super close to campus but very drivable and reasonably priced full house rentals is Southwood."
Tallahassee,2xu9lv,Davismj,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:30:12 2015 UTC,"I lived in Heritage Park all throughout grad school. It is about a mile from campus, and surrounded by sketchy neighborhoods, but is itself a secluded little place full of families and grad students. A few college kids stumble in there, but it usually stays pretty quiet.  Otherwise, Midtown or Killearn, if you don't mind a bit of a drive."
Tallahassee,2xu9lv,clearliquidclearjar,2,Wed Mar 4 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"If you aren't married, well off, and raising kids, there is no reason to live in Killearn. It's far away from anything interesting or fun about Tallahassee."

I haven't been in a while but last time I went there was only one other group of people and we only saw them when they took their boat out in the bay area.

Money at nights is the best. That's when it surges the most. Most customers are perfectly normal. You'll get some weirdos for sure.   Safety is your option.

Seafood- not too impressed by much unless you have time to hit the coast. But I'll second Shells (cash only).

Tallahassee,2wcpr5,Raikus,4,Sun Feb 22 13:05:32 2015 UTC,Apologies on the sign. I was going to draw a large one on the whiteboard but couldn't find the dry markers anywhere in the shop. We had some redditors show up and introduce themselves. I guess without the catalyst of a sign others were afraid to stand on top of the nearest car and start screaming their usernames for some reason.

Tallahassee,2w98rk,Raikus,3,Fri Feb 20 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"Burgers: My vote is for Vertigo, even though I think they're a tad overpriced. Voodoo Dog and Bird's also make killer burgers. Monk's & Midtown Caboose (same owners) are really good as well. BurgerFi gets an honorable mention.  Pizza: Gaines St Pies / Midtown Pies (and soon to open Northside Pies) are the best for sure. That's in my opinion as somebody who used to live in northern NJ which is an area known for excellent pizza. Other places that make very good pizza are Decent Pizza and Momo's (especially their Market Sq location which also has beer brewed on-site). The Brooklyn Water pizza place gets an honorable mention.  Tacos: For authentic Mexican food the answer is definitely La Tiendita. It's cash only as far as I know, and dirt cheap. The tacos al pastor are fantastic. You can also get food with various types of offal (beef tongue, cheeks, tripe, etc). For Americanized Mexican I really like Taco Republik. Full disclosure: my fiance's coworker's husband owns the place. He's Indian so when you see the few Indian inspired food items on the menu, know that they are fantastic. Also their Yucca fries are incredible."

Best tacos in town in my opinion are authentic Mexican tacos at La Tiendita on Monroe. You're gonna have to search for it as it's small. It's in between the T Mobile store and Barnacle Bills. Try the tacos with carne asada, chuleta (fried pork,) or the sausage. They make salsa homemade and they have homemade orchata and juices."

Tallahassee,2w98rk,siftekhar,2,Wed Feb 18 18:20:31 2015 UTC,You will be in heaven then. When you order horchata at La Tiendita it comes in a massive mug that's shaped like an elephant's foot. I am not kidding. I order one and by the end of the meal it's usually not finished.
Tallahassee,2w6wlo,RschDev,0,Tue Feb 17 13:51:11 2015 UTC,cool stuff ! reminds me of this video i found  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7-2ura5Nbs
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,Jaboowinston,2,Mon Feb 16 14:32:55 2015 UTC,Jeremy Cohen is a fantastic traffic lawyer and he is very affordable. I would honestly recommend him. He has gotten me out of two tickets where I was guilty in the past year
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,thug_life4,2,Mon Feb 16 15:52:52 2015 UTC,Ocala one cost me 300 and change in 2011. God I fucking hate those cameras.
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,Seminole11,2,Mon Feb 16 19:10:49 2015 UTC,Yeah those flashes go off all the time and IVe never gotten a ticket.  I swear they are for show.
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,99slobra,2,Mon Feb 16 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah the red light cams here have more flaws than a piece of backyard agate. The one at Monroe and Tennessee is notoriously screwed up. I'd contest the ticket if you end up getting one. There is some human oversight in the ticket delivery system, so you might not get one anyways. If you do, though, the contention system is pretty simple."

Tallahassee,2w2tn0,maronamanifest,1 point,Mon Feb 16 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"The tickets aren't automatic.  Someone reviews them. If you get a letter from an office in Blountstown that's the ticket. I've had many close calls like yours and no tickets. I did however foolishly burn the light going under the fly-over and the ticket had pics of my car coasting through with the light red. Dag!  If you contest the ticket,  the cost of a lawyer is the same price as paying the ticket  (which carries no penalty). Clever girl."
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,jugzeh,0,Tue Feb 17 17:13:14 2015 UTC,... no sympathy for you.  Maybe don't try to run yellow lights and go at speeds where it would be dangerous to slow down ?
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,baldrad,-5,Thu Feb 19 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"Technically, you are supposed to be clear of the intersection before it turns red. So they might have you on a technicality."
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,clearliquidclearjar,5,Mon Feb 16 22:58:09 2015 UTC,Not true. Your rear axle must be over the white line on your lane before the light turns red.  Source: no tickets.
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,sandy_catheter,2,Tue Feb 17 01:27:46 2015 UTC,Also not true. It doesn't have to be your rear axle. The front bumper will do.   Driver can legally enter intersection during entire yellow light interval.
Tallahassee,2w2tn0,kevjohn_forever,0,Tue Feb 24 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe the rules changed from the last time I read them. In any event, I've stopped halfway over the white line a number of times at camera intersections and have yet to be ticketed.  Edit: nowhere in your link does it say anything about what constitutes ""entering the intersection,"" so I'm going to stand by my statement. I'm too lazy and otherwise occupied to cite sources."

Tallahassee,2w05yy,agentfantabulous,11,Sun Feb 15 20:57:25 2015 UTC,Sakura is probably the best in town.
Tallahassee,2w05yy,evandactyl,6,Sun Feb 15 22:24:33 2015 UTC,+1 for Kiku. That is my favorite place in town for sushi.
Tallahassee,2w05yy,TerminatioN1337,3,Sun Feb 15 23:04:56 2015 UTC,I haven't been in years. Glad to hear it's still good!
Tallahassee,2w05yy,agentfantabulous,4,Mon Feb 16 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"I like both, but the service at sakura is really hit or miss, usually miss. Kiku is my favorite."
Tallahassee,2w05yy,pashapook,5,Mon Feb 16 00:45:51 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has recommended Tally Thai. I love sushi (lived in Asia for 9yrs) and very few places hit the spot.

Tallahassee,2w05yy,mojo87,2,Mon Feb 16 16:49:33 2015 UTC,It's off Pensacola in the same little strip as Brooklyn pizza! Seriously. Best place ever. I either get their rainbow koi roll or Caribbean roll and add pineapple to it.

Tallahassee,2w05yy,cfowlaa,3,Sun Feb 15 22:47:54 2015 UTC,Tally Thai and Sushi on Pensacola is really good

Stay classy, Tallahassee.   Siam Sushi is my favorite. The staff rules and the quality of both the sushi and the Thai food is killer.   The Udon Pad Kee Mao (spelling?) is like human catnip to me. I get it ripping hot and blast my face off.   Jasmine is also great for the same reasons. Friendly staff, great product."

It's cheaper than some of the really fancy schools, but more expensive than some schools too. However, it's the only one in the area. If you're planning on staying here for awhile and can afford it, it's great. If you aren't planning on staying here anyway, you might want to look at a school in a bigger city.

Tallahassee,2vc8b3,ReMiiX,3,Tue Feb 10 02:20:49 2015 UTC,"As a local karaoke regular, here's the main rundown:  Monday: Nowhere that I know of.  Tuesday: 1) Midtown Speakeasy with Nathan (OP's original comment), starts at 9 or 930.  2) Pocket's Pool with Dwight, starts at 10.  They've upgraded to the Karafun song list so good selection, it gets kinda busy and is a little smoky but fun vibe.  Wednesday: Down Below (under Barnacle Bill's) with Nathan, starts at 10.  This dive bar is one of the coolest places in town to do karaoke.  Thursday: 1) Bird's (from OP's original comment)  2) Down Below with Nathan, starts at 10.  Friday: 1) Down Below with DJ Scott Long, starts at 10.  My favorite place/night and my favorite karaoke DJ.    2) The Moon (aka ""Stetsons"") with Johnny Ray, starts at 10.  $10 cover.  Fun karaoke, but there's a lot of bleed over from the country crowd so if country's not your thing, you're gonna have a bad time.  3) Casa Grande with Nathan, it's a Mexican restaurant on the Parkway, starts at 8.  Saturday: Down Below with Nathan, starts at 10.    Sunday: Sidecar Gastrobar in Market Square with Nathan, starts at 930 after Trivia with Hank.  I think Geo's stopped running karaoke when they moved.  Applebee's may still do it on a weeknight (Wednesday I think?) but I haven't seen it on the board in a while.  I think I saw that Parlay next to Dave's Pizza Garage may fo karaoke earlier on Friday nights too but I don't know the details."

Tallahassee,2v7enf,GTDesperado,2,Sun Feb 8 21:57:00 2015 UTC,"tom brown is cool and if you have little kids then it's probably what you are looking for, play ground wise, but the greenways are the coolest parks in Tallahassee. The green way at the end of Pedrick has tons of trails and interesting places to explore, plus the new walk way across the rail road tracks is amazing. and once you are across the tracks you can walk across the land bridge to a trail system that ties back into Tom Brown. probably to far for a small kid but the whole green way and the trails are beautiful. I strongly suggest the walkway across the train tracks at sunset."

Tallahassee,2v5kmn,ChapinKnight,17,Sun Feb 8 02:35:59 2015 UTC,There is this thing called a stop line. And yeah. People run red lights. Hence all the cameras.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,99slobra,6,Sun Feb 8 02:49:50 2015 UTC,"Big discussion and disagreement in regards to this issue in /r/florida: http://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/2jm54p/waiting_to_take_a_left_turn_at_an_intersection_in/cldez1v  I was taught to drive 10 years ago by a drivers ed and the laws of a different state. I was always told that I could sit in the intersection on a green, even if that meant waiting until a yellow or red for the opportunity to take the left turn.   Maybe the law really is different in Florida, or the cops interpret it differently since it's not really explicit. The reason I'm starting to think that it's a difference in laws is that everyone does this in my home state of Wisconsin (and you'd get honked at by the guy behind you if you didn't) and I've never heard of anyone being ticketed because of it. But after I moved to Florida, I noticed that very few people did it. Even if it was legal in Florida I can understand why some people don't, considering this town has some of the highest rate of red-light runners I've ever witnessed, and that can clog up the intersection if you have to wait for that to clear.  Some other discussion, not particularly Florida-relevant, that says it's OK to go into the left lane even if it means you taking the left turn on a red (because everyone else should wait), so y'all know where I'm coming from:  http://drivinginstructorblog.com/q-should-i-pull-into-the-intersection-when-im-turning-left/  http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/traffic_talk_should_you_enter.html  http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=700715  http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2014/07/28/3769325_rules-of-the-road-when-can-i-enter.html?rh=1  http://www.adirondackdailyenterprise.com/page/content.detail/id/521778/Entering-intersection-for-left-turn-confusing-to-many.html?nav=5153"
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,DrSandbags,6,Sun Feb 8 07:02:11 2015 UTC,Seriously. Try waiting at the stop line in SC or any major city and a cop might actually pull you over for being incompetent. But the explanation of the high rate of red light-runners helps explain some of the hesitance here in Tallahassee.

Tallahassee,2v5kmn,CFCinUS,9,Sun Feb 8 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Out of all the things Tallahassee drivers do, you complain about this?  -Why has news of a turn signal/blinker never reached Tallahassee?  -Why does everybody turn right on a red even when it makes an oncoming car slam on its brakes?  -Why is it that at the beginning of every slow line of traffic, there's a minivan with a half-marathon bumper sticker?  -Why don't people understand that the speed limit on Thomasville road is 45, not 30  -Why is there seemingly and endless supply of old people that don't quite know where they are going?  -Why do people get in turn lanes a quarter of a mile before the turn lane begins?  -The intersection of Meridian and Bradford ('nuff said')  -Why do some people always slow down for school zones, even at 5pm on a Saturday?  -Why do Sorority girls near FSU jaywalk without even looking to see if a car is coming?  -Why do they give you the stink eye after you just slammed on the brakes and spared their life?   THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS!!"
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,WickThePriest,6,Sun Feb 8 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"I pull out into the intersection so at least one car can go.  It's state law in Ohio, and it just makes sense.  But drivers fucking suck here.  My personal favorite is the blinker WHILE turning, as an afterthought.  Second favorite is the red light runners.  It's getting to the point that I think it's actually encouraged.  Be careful on your left turns at low sun points on Appalachee.  Blinds you and sometimes you can't see the light to know it's red."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,199nein,5,Sun Feb 8 06:53:25 2015 UTC,I don't sit in the intersection because people in Tallahassee typically aren't the best/safest drivers. I'd rather lose a minute of my life than my life in a minute because I might be able to make a turn a few seconds faster.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,pashapook,7,Sun Feb 8 13:11:11 2015 UTC,"I see too many people run yellow and red lights. If you pull into the intersection to wait and three people run the yellow into red light, you're stuck out there long past red. If people actually stopped at yellow lights here that might work."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,thug_life4,0,Sun Feb 8 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"at that point though you just go. after you have crossed the line you have already ""made"" the light you are not running it. you are just looking like an idiot sitting in the intersection or putting the car in reverse"
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,pashapook,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly, except that's illegal and blocks traffic. You can't go ahead while you are waiting for the cars that are running the light because you'll hit them, then you end up super running the red light. There are camera intersections in town too."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,alifelessordinary,2,Tue Feb 10 00:39:26 2015 UTC,I don't think I've seen that happen too often - in my experience most people at least stick the nose of their car out. And I wouldn't fault someone for driving defensively and not wanting to be stuck out in the intersection trying to turn but also avoid people running red lights.  I think what's more infuriating are the cars that leave a car and a half worth of space between them and the next car during rush hour. SCOOT UP.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,panamacitynative,6,Mon Feb 9 16:40:22 2015 UTC,Its people like you that cause accidents. If you're out in the middle of the intersection and two people run the red light in the opposite direction you're stuck there really running the red light. What's with people hanging out in the middle of an intersection like they own it?
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,panamacitynative,-1,Sun Feb 8 04:34:48 2015 UTC,"Its people like you that cause accidents.    So you're blaming the people that have every right to sit in the intersection instead of the people running red lights?   What's with people hanging out in the middle of an intersection like they own it?   What's with people changing lanes acting like they own them? What's with people turning right on red acting like they own it? I mean, it's completely legal to pull past the stop line. And no cop is going to hassle someone if they're sitting there after the light turns red because some jackass ran the light going the other way. I take advantage of pulling into the intersection to help with the flow of traffic and alleviate unnecessary buildup."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,NicNoletree,3,Sun Feb 8 07:18:53 2015 UTC,"There may not be a law that says you can't do it but there's also not a law that says you have to wait out in the middle of an intersection. I am perfectly free to wait until there is opportunity to turn left behind the line.  I guarantee you more accidents have been caused by people waiting out in the middle of the section than by people waiting behind the line. You may not get a ticket for it, it may not technically be illegal, but you are going to cause more accidents than me in the long run and people like you. so go ahead do whatever you want but don't get mad at me for not feeling comfortable sitting out in the intersection when it's red. Every time I see someone out in the middle of an intersection turning left I think that person is a huge gigantic idiot."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,panamacitynative,5,Sun Feb 8 14:39:27 2015 UTC,"So, again, you're blaming the people that have every right to sit in the intersection rather than the people running red lights?  And I don't see how sitting in the intersection would cause an accident anyway. If you're sitting there waiting to go no one coming perpendicular from you is going to t-bone you unless they're blind. They'll just sit there the extra 2 seconds to let you get out of their way."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,BlueSapphyre,7,Sun Feb 8 14:52:17 2015 UTC,I agree with you 100% sounds like someone is in denial that running a red light is a bad thing and could be the root cause of these accidents.  Serious therapy needed.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,panamacitynative,0,Sun Feb 8 15:25:51 2015 UTC,You don't have a right to sit in the intersection. How can u even see the color of the light if u r under it
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,thug_life4,4,Sun Feb 8 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"How fucking far are you pulling into the intersection where you can't even see the light? And yes, of course drivers have a right to sit in the intersection, it's perfectly legal."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,DutchPirate,2,Mon Feb 9 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"But you have to be careful with that. If you can't clear the intersection (like if the road you're turning onto is backed up), you'll get an obstruction of traffic/moving violation."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,panamacitynative,3,Mon Feb 9 19:01:50 2015 UTC,I agree. It's just part of being a good driver and being able to properly judge how much room/time you're going to have. I would never be the 3rd or 4th car that's trying to turn left and blocks the intersection. Not only that but I never block a street when I'm stopped so people can turn in and out of the drives. Not a lot of people do that but that isn't specific to Tallhassee.

The answers to your question are:  -THe roads are very poorly designed around here -The light/stop signs in the city are poorly placed/timed -Majority of drivers do NOT get on the gas at a green light, or a yield sign w no oncoming traffic  These three main reasons is what causes people to be later/more in a hurry than they were when leaving their original location, hence the increased speeding and red light/stop sign running by these people"
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,Eckhart,2,Mon Feb 9 18:37:51 2015 UTC,I agree with your first 2 points. The roads are very poorly set up. And the stop lights themselves are too low and at some intersections they're not even hanging across the street. They're right above the stop line which is retarded.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,spoon_cake,2,Mon Feb 9 19:19:25 2015 UTC,I agree dude. I think it's mainly college kids who don't have a lot of experience driving. Why would anyone worry about red light runners in this situation. Nobody has moved horizontally if you are in that position. If somebody hits me they're super fucked up. If you worry about that you might as well just not drive a car and stay home. Just go into the fucking intersection if it's green you pussies. Infuriating stuff.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,thug_life4,2,Sun Feb 8 15:46:15 2015 UTC,because the majority of us don't drive like assholes. seriously nothing pissed me off more then when my light turns green and your dumbass is still in the intersection waiting to turn. stop doing it. wait one more light cycle.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,chrisarrant,0,Sun Feb 8 13:21:10 2015 UTC,It's legal and I'm going to continue doing it. We all wanna get there quickly. Some people are slower than others with this move.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Sun Feb 8 15:48:23 2015 UTC,and i'll continue laying on my horn while you chill in the intersection longer than you should.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,chrisarrant,2,Sun Feb 8 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"Then you'd be the asshole. Laying on your horn should be avoided at all costs, only when completely necessary such as if you're brakes were to go out or a crash was imminent. A tap on the horn? Sure. But to extend beyond a beep is alarming to other drivers and could cause an accident. I suggest you read this on horn honking etiquette. It brings up some really great points that I've already touched on."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Feb 9 06:02:19 2015 UTC,"In addition to some of these other points, turning left from Bradford to Thomasville North is an intersection I will never go into if I don't have a green arrow.   I am not 100% on this, but I'm pretty sure the streets don't line up completely. I don't feel that there's room for a car in between the two straight lanes. You can't see the approaching straight lane due to the long and common buildup of cars in Betton's left turn lane.    That's just one specific intersection, but in general around here it just seems like there's too many intersections with difficult visibility into oncoming traffic, and if something goes wrong I'd rather be behind the line minding my own business than stuck out in the middle desperately looking for a way out."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,chrisarrant,1 point,Tue Feb 10 01:21:46 2015 UTC,Its only been going on for the past 5 years or so. I think its so the lazy assed driver can see the lights from lower windshields without leaning forward in the seat. The newer lights are hanging higher now too.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,BlueSapphyre,-3,Sun Feb 8 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I wonder the same thing.  Moved down from DC suburbs in November and Tallahassee drivers are so incredibly over-cautious.  There can be a mile-long gap in traffic and a green light and people still won't make that left."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,chrisarrant,-9,Sun Feb 8 04:35:40 2015 UTC,They really are straight pussies.
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,BlueSapphyre,2,Sun Feb 8 08:19:30 2015 UTC,Why is this man being down voted?? Im tired with the liberal/hipster/adult baby agenda not only on reddit but increasingly in this city I call home
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,thug_life4,-1,Mon Feb 9 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"It's illegal to be stopped in the middle of an intersection, even if you're caught there when a light turns red. You're obstructing traffic. You're only supposed to go past the line if there's room for you on the other side."
Tallahassee,2v5kmn,chrisarrant,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:29:23 2015 UTC,"While not illegal, it's not a good habit. If you can't clear the intersection (like if the road you're turning onto is backed up), you'll get an obstruction of traffic/moving violation."
Tallahassee,2v2gm6,Swisskisses,3,Sat Feb 7 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"TCC offers several entry-level acting courses with topics ranging from stage and film practice, movement, voice, and even improvisation.  Eva Parks and John Schultz are in charge of the department and are wonderful, caring people.  They sometimes also offer scholarships, if that's your thing.  Outside of that, I would look to the general auditions for TCC's and FSU's theatre season, which happen at the beginning of each spring and fall semester.  Auditions at both schools are open to the public, students and non-students alike.  Also keep in mind that FSU has a top-tier film school, and are always look for actors to volunteer their time in students films (plus you basically get professionally edited film audition reel material for free.)  If you're looking something even more basic than all of that, Theatre Tallahassee offers beginning-level acting workshops a couple times a year (though they are usually geared towards a much older aged demographic.)    http://theatre.fsu.edu/ http://film.fsu.edu/ https://www.tcc.fl.edu/Current/Academics/CH/Pages/Theatre.aspx http://theatretallahassee.org/"

The article seems to imply that, because there is a pipeline near the river, toxic waste is being dumped into the river, but doesn't provide any evidence of spills or leaks.  I also love the tenuous connections to the Republican boogeymen the Kock brothers. The pipeline was approved in 2003, they bought Georgia-Pacific in 2005, so therefore the pipeline was their fault.

AirTran came in 2001, and there was a price drop, but business people continued to fly Delta because of frequent flyer miles et al, and AirTran left in 2004 from lack of sales. Business people are not as concerned with prices as the casual flyer is, so they rather rack up on benefits, or have more flexibility in flight times, even if it means higher airfare.

Tallahassee,2ujz1f,jrm07f,3,Tue Feb 3 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you're looking to be in town, close to everything but away from students, I'd suggest living on the southeast side. There are several nice apartment complexes on Old Saint Augustine (the part that runs parallel to Apalachee Parkway). It's a good little area to be in, quiet and out of the way and a mostly adult/family area.   There are also a few complexes right off of Capital Circle (in that same general area) and Blairstone that are super nice and not too bad budget wise. The Apartment Finder booklet and website is where I found my apartment and I'm extremely satisfied with where I'm at, location wise (southeast side)"
Tallahassee,2ujz1f,amusicalheart,2,Fri Feb 6 16:19:14 2015 UTC,"I second this. I live in that area and it is great. Anything west of Monroe Street is more than likely going to be college students.

Tallahassee,2ujz1f,SalgarandPepper,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:06:07 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you for your service. Second, in terms of living I assume since you are likely in your mid-late 20s you probably want to skip out on living in student dominated areas that will be loud and more prone to crime. Depending on your budget, I would suggest renting in midtown. You can find amazing deals there BUT they are rarely listen online and are scooped up very fast. Drive around that area and look for signs in yards. midtown is the young adult area of town and is surrounded by great bars and restaurants. It is close to EVERYTHING and is both quiet and safe. Avoid anything off Jackson bluff, south of apalachee parkway, french town, and generally a .5 mile radio is around campus.   In terms of things to do, we have 3 breweries (proof, grasslands, momos pizza), there are many sporting events/concerts located on or around campus (also check out the bradfordville Blues club), there are tons of awesome parks/greenway/trails, downtown get down/market days, first friday (located in railroad square), great restaurants (Momo's, wells brothers, Kool beanz, Bella Bella, tucker dukes, shells, bhan thai, Habanas), great bars (Liberty, fermentation lounge, leon pub, brass tap, wine loft, the lounge)  If you ever need any suggestions please pm me.

Tallahassee,2ts0hb,clearliquidclearjar,3,Wed Jan 28 07:19:56 2015 UTC,"My personal recommendations are:   Little Italy if you want somewhere quiet with some ambiance and great, fresh Italian food. Texas Roadhouse if you don't mind a loud environment and are looking for a decent steakhouse that is better than most in your price range. Bird's Aphrodisiac Oyster Shack if you want a little local hole in the wall burger and seafood joint. Kiku Japanese Fusion for sushi or hibachi with a bit of ambiance (no hibachi tables though... I prefer Japanica for hibachi tables).   Honorable mentions: Ted's Montana Grill for another steak option. Momo's for pizza.  Those should all be within your price range. If your price range was a bit higher my recommendations would have likely been a lot different but all of the above are still great."

Ugh."

No one has actually found that professors hired with CKF money are biased in their research or are so biased because of CKF money.  The university investigated this already and found that the department ignored all recommendations made by the auxiliary committee with the CKF rep. The faculty senate (remember non-econ college professors usually tend toward the liberal side so they're definitely not pro-Koch) investigated and found that CKF did not have undue influence on the process.  All of this is ""what if what if what if"" with no real specific charges. It's been 7 years since the partnership was formed, you'd think there would be some meat to these accusations by now."

I would consider it grossly irresponsible if they just handed millions to the university without any control or conditions.  These conditions are there to ensure the goal of the gift is achieved.  As to academic freedom, you assume that the present system at the university ensures a more unbiased approach, but couldn't you argue that the bias of other professors and those on the hiring committee is equally compromised? It is demonstrable that academics tend to hire other academics with similar or complementary viewpoints.  Perhaps these conditions are appropriate to prevent this gift from falling victim to that same bias. *edit: typo"

Tallahassee,2rrkis,Soulcatcher_,3,Thu Jan 8 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"Tallahassee Museum is a great way to spend a day outside.  If you're interested in other outside activities:  Braden Trail (hiking and camping) http://apalachee.floridatrail.org/big-bend-area-trails/fort-braden-trail/  St. Marks Nature Refuge (biking, canoeing, and hiking): http://www.fws.gov/refuge/st_marks/  Tom Brown Park has excellent trails, disc golf, and mountain biking.  McClay gardens also has great outdoor walks.  Thomasville, GA is about 45 minutes north-ish and has great restaurants and shops to walk through.  Mission San Luis might be open, that's a fun afternoon if you haven't been there.  The Indian burial mounds off N. Monroe would be a nice picnic/walk around day trip if the weather is nice."
Tallahassee,2rrkis,Soulcatcher_,2,Thu Jan 8 21:41:16 2015 UTC,Great suggestions thank you!  What part of town should I get a hotel room?
Tallahassee,2rrkis,Soulcatcher_,1 point,Thu Jan 8 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! Tallahassee has lots to offer above and beyond the ""College town"" activities.  I didn't realize you were coming in from out of town, I hope you enjoy the weekend here!  As far as lodging, it depends on how much you want to spend.  If you stay in downtown Tallahassee, there are plenty of nice options but these might be pricey for the weekend.  Hotel Duval and Aloft seem to be the most prominent hotels in that area, but I've never stayed there. If you stay downtown you will be in walking distance of museums, the capitol, and Railroad Square (art/hipster district) things like the downtown market: http://www.downtownmarket.com.  There are a lot of food options there as well, such as voodoo dog, gaines street pies, Andrews 228, etc.  If you want to stay near the campus/Railroad Square/downtown area, I've stayed at the Residence Inn at the Capitol (http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/tlhdt-residence-inn-tallahassee-universities-at-the-capitol/).  This gives you a small kitchen and living space, but its a little pricey.  If you want to stay on North Monroe, this puts you in driving distance of pretty much everything, downtown/San Luis/Burial Mounds/etc.  These hotels are pretty much just your standard stuff, google maps probably has good info on reviews.  If you stay off the Thomasville Rd area (different than Thomasville, Ga with all the shops), this puts you more in North Tallahassee which is very beautiful and near McClay Gardens, lots of shopping and food, Bradley's Country Store (http://www.bradleyscountrystore.com), Trader Joes, and keeps you out of the student traffic.    Those three areas would be my choices, I would definitely avoid South and West tallahassee for lodging. These areas are student and low income areas and you'll get more sirens/party noise/cheap hotel experience there.  As far as food: * Gaines street pies: http://www.gainesstreetpies.com   Voodoo Dog: https://www.facebook.com/VoodooDogTally Wells Brothers Burgers: http://www.wellsbrothersbarandgrill.com BurgerFi: http://www.burgerfi.com Jim and Milts BBQ: http://www.jimandmilts.com Latin Xpress Cafe : Cuban food, weird hours though. Pho 7: Vietnamese food. Kool Beanz: http://www.kool-beanz.com (pricey) Waterworks: Island/tropical bar with fun drinks and food. Little Italy: http://www.littleitalytallahassee.com (small local Italian place)   *Coffee: Catalina Cafe, Lucky Goat, Black Dog Cafe, Craigs Killer Coffee.  I would encourage you to just explore and try local stuff as much as possible, there are a lot of great local places to eat/drink/visit. =)"

I've had two suits and two shirts taken in (sides, waist, and sleeve length) and I was very happy with how they turned out. Just make sure if you know what style you want going in that you stick to it. For example, she tried to nudge me to keep my jacket sleeves a little bit longer, but I wanted them a bit shorter than she recommended. Of course you have to defer sometimes to the more knowledgeable person but just keep in mind there is sometimes more than one right answer. I have another jacket I need altered and I will definitely go back to her."

It's an asymmetric game set in a dystopian cyberpunk future. One player plays as the ""evil"" megacorporation, while the other player is the Runner - a hacker who is trying to take down the megacorps and expose their secrets. The corporation sets up servers to score their agendas behind ICE (firewalls). The hacker needs to use icebreakers to get through them and steal the agendas."

Tallahassee,2qf9xk,wgraves,2,Fri Dec 26 15:07:25 2014 UTC,"http://www.makingawesome.org/  and  https://www.facebook.com/groups/makingawesome/  Heres the copy/paste of the description from the website:  A hackerspace or hackspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace or creative space) is a location where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital or electronic art (but also in many other realms) can meet, socialise and/or collaborate. Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things.  Many hackerspaces participate in the use and development of free software, open hardware, and alternative media. They are often physically located in infoshops, social centers, adult education centers, or on university campuses, but may relocate to industrial or warehouse space when they need more room.  Functions The specific activities that take place at hackerspaces vary from place to place. In general, hackerspaces function as centers for peer learning and knowledge sharing, in the form of workshops, presentations, and lectures. They usually also offer social activities for their members, such as game nights and parties. They typically provide space for members to work on their individual projects, or to collaborate on group projects with other members. Hackerspaces may also operate computer tool lending libraries, or physical tool lending libraries."

Tallahassee,2q7kx2,BigBaldFourEyes,1 point,Wed Dec 24 21:00:53 2014 UTC,"Second for Progressive. I've actually filed a claim that wasn't my fault (a car hit mine while it was parked on the side of the road in front of my house) and they were very responsive. Rates didn't go up either, which shocked me. If you go with Progressive, make sure you enroll in the Snapshot program. You plug in a device in your car's OBD port and it records your driving habits for a couple of weeks. If you are careful, you can save 10-15 percent."
Tallahassee,2q7kx2,JefemanG,1 point,Fri Dec 26 04:32:32 2014 UTC,"I have Farm Bureau and they're not only good about claims, but they also offer A LOT of discounts.  I'm a 20 y/o male with a mustang GT and between school discount, grade discount, honor society discount, and loyal customer (parents have been with them for 15 years) I pay about $35/month for full coverage and a $500 deductible.  However, if you don't have anything for discounts, they are more pricey.  I got a good price from there due to the discounts, but before that, they were a bit more expensive than say Progressive or Geico, who did not offer me similar deals."

A word of warning, though - they are highly irreverent and do not take themselves or anything seriously, so it's mostly just a good time.  Family Tree is great for LGBTQ serious issues, though.

Tallahassee,2q2npu,Mecha-Dave,4,Mon Dec 22 15:51:48 2014 UTC,"Mickee Faust is for all types. I'm a white cis-male and did some shows with them. I even met my wife at one of the events. They just accept that everyone is different and that those differences can be strengths. They've got people with CP wearing skimpy clothes on stage, constant cross-dressing and irreverence, and basically a whole bunch of fun. Their idea is that EVERYONE is a weirdo, and you quickly forget whatever is making you feel alone when you see the level of acceptance they've got going on.  I'm pretty sure the family tree is still going... though they may be having physical location woes. I know that they do support groups at the Unitarian Universalist church when they don't have a space.

He either couldn't pass or wouldn't and was being a bully. And maybe he kills a child in that school zone. It is not this persons responsibility to pander to this person. If he doesn't have sirens on his car, you don't have to pull over. I think that if a person is not comfortable going the speed limit and wishes to go shower in an area, yes the should pull over.

Tallahassee,2oz1c7,IGotYourMaam,1 point,Thu Dec 11 20:00:52 2014 UTC,"When I had a really basic LG slide phone the service was almost non-existent. I would drop calls, not get texts, not be able to send anything, etc.  With an iPhone 4s, the service was better, but busy areas like on TCC campus it was almost useless.  Now I have an iPhone 5s and the service is much better and way more reliable. The 4G really made a huge difference. I rarely don't have service unless I'm on the outskirts of the city or inside some FSU buildings.  Also, the intersection of Tennessee and Ocala has been a dead zone for Sprint service across all phones I've had the last three and a half years. Really frustrating to be talking to someone and pass that intersection because the call always drops or cuts out."

There's stuff for kids there, but it's actually really fun to go walk and look at the animals and Florida history as an adult. It's not expensive at all.  For dinner, if you like Indian food Samrat on Apalachee parkway has done great vegetarian dishes ($11-$15 per entree). Cool Beans on Thomasville rd is amazing and has a lot of variety ($15-$25 ish per entree). *edit to add one more: Soul Vegetarian Restaurant on S Adams.

I think there will always be a place for that, even if it isn't within the current structure of traditional news media. I think the industry is still a good 10 years off from is giant metamorphosis. I do believe a change is coming, but the industry is changing, not dying. People still need news, there has to be some sort of aggregate for thruth and facts.

Tallahassee,2lvky4,WickThePriest,1 point,Tue Nov 11 12:19:01 2014 UTC,All the important questions.  I play a weekly game on roll20 with my friend in San Diego and some strangers around the globe.  But the in person game just isn't coming together like I'd like.  Work schedules being what they are.  Going to talk to Abby about your room dealio tonight though.  We live in the ghetto and she's sick of it.

Tallahassee,2ldb1p,secondhandheroes,6,Wed Nov 5 14:38:51 2014 UTC,Which edition?
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Wed Nov 5 14:43:34 2014 UTC,5th edition. I was running pathfinder (3.75) but as I read the 5th edition rules I realized it had all the versatility I loved from pathfinder with far more streamlined mechanics.
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,BlueSapphyre,2,Thu Nov 6 14:57:18 2014 UTC,"Oh ok. I prefer 4th, seems like 5th harkens back to a lot of old things."
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,Dusty1919,5,Thu Nov 6 15:00:01 2014 UTC,I have always been very tempted to try D&D. Never actually played but I have some basic understanding of the premise from books and video games based on Forgotten Realms.  How long does an average play session take?
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,MindStalker,2,Wed Nov 5 15:27:57 2014 UTC,"Weeks, often months, generally a play session last till a preset time or a good break point, but that just pauses the game."
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,clearliquidclearjar,1 point,Thu Nov 6 00:06:53 2014 UTC,"A session lasts as long as you like. I keep the table running from 6-11pm, but since this is an open table, the players are expected to come and go as they please."
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,eyabs,2,Thu Nov 6 14:55:38 2014 UTC,Lake Ella or Railroad Square?
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,eyabs,2,Wed Nov 5 18:43:50 2014 UTC,Lake Ella.
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,McDoof,2,Thu Nov 6 14:57:32 2014 UTC,"Oh hello! Yes, we are running 5th edition, which harkens back to 2e flavor except with modernized mechanics.  We start roughly around 6-7 due to folks trickling in, and people come and go as they please until Black Dog cafe closes at 11pm. So session length is entirely up to each player; since it's an open table, no one should feel obligated to stay longer than they like.  And this is the Lake Ella location."
Tallahassee,2ldb1p,gabrielle1106,2,Thu Nov 6 14:53:49 2014 UTC,Do you allow some creative freedoms when making a character? I have a concept character in mind whose a wizard that lives in a rope trick and has a swarm of monkeys that follows him around.

Tallahassee,2kkr63,slamdancer,2,Tue Oct 28 17:07:06 2014 UTC,Oh nuts. The only issue I've had with them is they installed the splitter backwards so the connection was slow. It was an easy fix for me to make though.

Unfortunately, many businesses hire right before and around the start of school to be ready for football season, especially food and hospitality. Probably not a ton of office positions this time of year either. Most retail businesses are doing seasonal hiring right now, so if you go in and make a good impression you might catch a seasonal position, but only if you'll be in town for Black Friday/Christmas. If you're not getting calls back, make sure you're making a good impression when you go in to apply! Presentable clothes, good attitude, big smile."

Doesn't mean you will qualify for all of them but I am sure pretty much anyone would qualify for at least a couple at any given moment.  Random tip as well, most job posting are open for at least one full weekend, so if you checked the available jobs at FSU once per weekend you would almost never miss an opening. No need to check it daily."

Tallahassee,2j50zp,rolls20s,2,Mon Oct 13 23:47:12 2014 UTC,That accent is prominent everywhere in North Florida except tallahassee.  So let's call it the tallahassee accent...
Tallahassee,2j50zp,rystesh,1 point,Tue Oct 14 02:22:36 2014 UTC,"I've lived in North Florida for most of my life, I would say that's not really even a good example of a Florida Southern Accent, and even that isn't really even found commonly in Tallahassee."
Tallahassee,2j50zp,chapstickninja,-3,Tue Oct 14 14:23:42 2014 UTC,It's an awful version of the southern accent. It reminds me of comparing the Cockney accent to the rest of Britain.
Tallahassee,2j50zp,BlueSapphyre,6,Mon Oct 13 19:19:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but it's safe to say that there are a large amount who don't have it that live in tallahassee. It's a lot more noticeable when you get to places around it like Quincy, Crawfordville, or Monticello."

I drove 3 hours to see the place for a scheduled appointment and they never arranged it with the current tenants.   I eventually got to see a similar apartment and put a security deposit down and assumed everything was good until I called a month or two before moving and they told me they no longer handled that property...  They never called me to tell me that this happened and I no longer had a place to move to.  Just a terrible way to treat people....

Tallahassee,2ibmmn,vanstansunderpants,6,Sun Oct 5 01:19:28 2014 UTC,"There are lots of places within that distance, depending on your preference of activities.  If you like the outdoors you could try one of the several state parks nearby, Torreya (sp) is probably the most well known.  You could also look into Ichetucknee springs or bear paw if you want to tube/canoe/kayak though the season for that is probably over.  The is Seacrest wolf preserve in Chipola where you can interact with Wolves but they are only open to the public on Saturdays.  There is also a nice state park in Chipola that has some decent trails with waterfalls on them that are fairly picturesque, but I can't remember what it's called.  Seaside, fl is a quaint beach town about an hour and a half away and is where The Truman show was filmed.  There are plenty of other really nice beaches within that drive time as well.  Jacksonville has a zoo that is pretty nice and affordable and there is another state park there that is home to an old fort that is cool if you like history.  There are also several places to shop there and an outlet mall between j-ville and st Augustine (which is also worth a visit but someone already suggested that).  You could probably also check out wild adventures which is not amazing as far as theme parks go, but isn't terrible either. Closer to home there are waculla springs, Leon sinks, Marianna caverns, and even the tallahassee museum.  If any of that sparks your curiosity I can elaborate somewhat and maybe even provide links and pics for some things (in the morning, I'm about to go to bed right now)..."

It's a little on the pricey side, though.  Stay away from anything managed by First Property Services. They manage several apartment complexes and rental homes in town and they are absolutely terrible."
Tallahassee,2i7c4g,slamdancer,1 point,Fri Oct 3 17:37:58 2014 UTC,"Just FWIW, I rented from First Property Services for three years and never had a problem.  They fixed stuff when it broke, usually quickly, and I even got my deposit back (I didn't screw anything up and cleaned when I moved).    EDIT: They even let me extend my lease month to month with no extra charge when I had a house under contract and was trying to close.    I have friends who still rent a townhouse from them, and they say in the last year with new staff it has become a bit more of a nightmare, with arbitrary rules being enforced that aren't in the lease, as if they lived in a neighborhood with a HOA.    In my experience as a renter, it's really hit or miss.  Some places started out great and sucked by the time I moved.  Other rental agencies were hated by some tenants, but I never had problems.    That said and to address OP's question, I know several people who have lived in Londontown and sing it's praises.  I have no firsthand experience, though.    EDIT: Typos because fat thumbs."

They're trying to do this to us now, I just told them to fuck off.  No one from FPS has ever visited the property we rent. I didn't even meet anyone from there until I had lived there for two years.

I only eat local. If you come into midtown then Crepe Vine, Bella Bella- (Jewish-Italian) Siam Sushi, Empire Take-out Chinese, and all the Publix have a great deli section. Get some something for take-away and then ask me to recommend a good park near-by. I work on the road alot between TLH and P-Cola. Niceville tommorow.

Tallahassee,2hjwzo,sarabara2013,3,Fri Sep 26 19:07:46 2014 UTC,"I've tried both CenturyLink and Comcast. CenturyLink was awful. We were paying for 10 Mbps and Speedtest was showing we could barely hold 2 Mbps. We couldn't even watch tv and stream youtube at the same time. We called and they said there was no issue on their end.  So we changed to Comcast and they're great. We have Preferred XF Double Play and consistently hold 50 Mbps. Great customer service anytime there's an outage. When we upgraded to HD, it took like 2 mins at the office to exchange our box for an HD box."
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Fri Sep 26 19:16:53 2014 UTC,Really glad to hear Comcast is pretty good since it's at the top of my list. Most of the reviews I've read or heard were pretty awful.   Have you streamed any tv shows through your internet? One person I've recently talked to said when they tried to load Netflix it lagged or would load then just stop. Not sure what speed they had; didn't think to ask.
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,Dusty1919,2,Fri Sep 26 19:29:19 2014 UTC,"I have the 25mpbs speed, usually get 38ish. I cap my Steam downloads at 2MBps and still have more than enough left over to stream HD netflix with no issues at all."
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,teap0ts,2,Fri Sep 26 20:09:48 2014 UTC,"Comcast has THE WORST customer service, but they are the cheaper alternative and therefore that is the only reason I put up with them. I split $50 with 2 other roommates for an internet and cable bundle.   Go into the store when dealing with them for ANYTHING. Phone service is a wreck.  Also, you're not in a contract for the bundle (it might be a student deal, I can't remember, but they never asked for my student ID).   Oh, and it comes with 6 free months of HBO and all that fancy crap. After the 6 months is done, I'm just going to cancel my membership and have one of my other roommates get the cable/internet bundle so we can get the next 6 months free again."
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,BrachiumPontis,1 point,Fri Sep 26 20:21:48 2014 UTC,Comcast has okay service for me- can't really complain. EXCEPT:  Customer service BLOWS. The people on the phone have wasted hours of my time and hundreds of dollars with their screwups. The people in town are really good though.
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,coolbuns,1 point,Fri Sep 26 21:20:38 2014 UTC,If you go to the local Comcast place off Hartsfield Road you will have a much easier time than calling their service number. The number you call is usually an 800 number and the local offices do things differently. On the phone I've sometimes been on hold for close to an hour but in the local office the people are helpful and the issue gets solved easily and in a timely manner.
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue Sep 30 16:22:22 2014 UTC,I haven't had any troubles with streaming. I'll normally be playing a game and streaming to twitch while my roommate streams netflix and I'm still don't have any dropped frames.
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,Dusty1919,1 point,Fri Sep 26 21:22:18 2014 UTC,"I had a very similar situation but not as extreme, paid for 5mbps and was getting 5. Decided to upgrade to 10 and got 6, they said they only guarantee 60% of the advertised speed. Switched to comcast, paying for 25 and getting 38 now.  That being said, hopefully you never have to deal with Comcast customer service. The internet may be better but the customer support is even worse."
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,BoxofWhine,1 point,Fri Sep 26 20:08:31 2014 UTC,Similar story. Century link basically stole from me. Avoid at all costs.
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,srust21,2,Sat Sep 27 01:13:30 2014 UTC,Contrary to /u/BlueSapphyre my parents have had CenturyLink for about 8 years now and when I visit it is great. They have the 10 mbps plan and its always maxing out at 10 on speedtest unless someone is using it.
Tallahassee,2hjwzo,azazael13,2,Wed Oct 1 19:19:34 2014 UTC,"I have had both Comcast and Centurylink here in town.  Comcast:   Pro - Fast internet speeds, more options to view things online (ABC and Fox don't have a contract with Centurylink yet). Con - Horrible customer service.  I had many issues with my service, and it was always a hassle to get actual help, yes I turned it off and then on again.  Also towards the end of my time with them, they raised their prices every single month.  When asked about it they always tried to pass it off as 'taxes'.   CenturyLink   Pro -  Great customer service.  Great prices.  One thing about their prices is that your phone and internet price is locked for 5 years (federal/local taxes not withstanding).  If you call them every year when your contract would be up, they will give you the best current deal, the only catch is you have to call and ask for it.  This by far and away beats Comcast's 'initial price before we triple it'.  Also a minor thing, but changing channels is so much fast, I also love the channel preview option. Con - The speed isn't nearly as fast, the closer you are to their main hub the faster you can get, up to 25 I think.  No online viewing of ABC or Fox.   I realize your question was for just internet, but I thought I would cover their packages as a whole.  I have looked at possibly getting just internet from Comcast, and leaving my cable/phone with centurylink, but when I spoke to a Comcast rep about it, they seemed bewildered that I wouldn't want cable."

It's great for the people that want to stay casual, but not so great for the 20-somethings who actually want commitment.

Tallahassee,2gf45s,getpopular,2,Mon Sep 15 04:52:44 2014 UTC,"the smoke place corner of magnolia and mahan.  roll your own carton ~$28 with a $5 yearly membership.    pick your raw tobacco, pick the filter style, go into the back room, dump them in to the machine, and watch it pack all your smokes.  highly recommended.  if you're unsure of flavors or filters, tell them what you currently smoke, they'll roll you a tester you can step outside and try before you commit to a carton."
Tallahassee,2gbwwq,clinical_psyence,3,Sun Sep 14 00:10:50 2014 UTC,"I picked up a truck load of some sweet gum and a little pear last year. I have since switched to mostly gas. You can have the wood if you want it. Both of these woods are great for smoking. But there are some local wood sellers. Check with the city land fills. They used to have mulch they gave away and they may have wood that people leave at the curb for pick up. Check in from of people houses in the old midtown neighborhoods. People are doing more yard work now that its sort of getting cooler. They will often leave wood at the street for pick up by whom ever gets it first.  Learn your species. You don't want pines, cedars, or camphor. But maples oaks and gum are awesome. There is that place up 27 almost in Quincy that sells all sorts of cuts and chips of various species. Lots of arborists and tree companies will let you take there wood too. Try Millers Tree Service.  Home owners are cutting down these old Bradford Pears that where planted 20-30 years ago because they are now looking like crap and they are a mess. As far as meat I like fresh market for better cuts buts Stars is great too and cheaper. They can even order whole hogs or suckling pigs or goats or pretty much any kind of wild meat thats legal and in season. Char grilled wild duck breast is amazing. And now you need to get into dry aging your own roasts. Message me on FB."
Tallahassee,2gbwwq,CorriByrne,1 point,Sun Sep 14 14:27:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the offer! I'm looking for someone that delivers, but I appreciate the offer. Gonna call millers in the morning.   Are you getting good smoke from gas? I started with an electric, but never got a smoke ring so it was basically an outdoor oven more than anything else. Nowadays I'll start with charcoal to get the fire going then its split logs all the way. Usually hickory, but thinking about mixing it up with some fruitwood to look for some different favors.   Good idea on fresh market. Hadn't thought to check there. I'll try stars again too. Stopped by there to check it out, but the kid I talked to didn't seem to know the cuts of meat I as talking about (brisket flat and point).   Haven't tried dry aging ... Sounds awesome."
Tallahassee,2gbwwq,CorriByrne,2,Sun Sep 14 23:53:17 2014 UTC,No you really cant smoke with gas- Ok actually you can because you need to cook the meat well and the smoke is just flavor. So cook the meat and finish it with smoke. Yes dry aging is a great thing- I will buy well marbled roasts and age them 60 days in my fridge. It a great flavor. They dry out and get all concentrated. Ignore sell by dates if you know what you are doing. I am working on a 90 day aged Boston Butt roast now. I'll let you know when its ready. It should be ready when my wine in ready.

Tallahassee,2gbwwq,GTDesperado,7,Mon Sep 15 00:22:40 2014 UTC,"There's Star's Meat Market on Tharpe, they normally have whatever cuts of meat you could want, and then there's Silver Lake on Highway 20. If it's not in a package, ask and they'll cut it for you.  For wood, I always have a stack of well seasoned oak and if I need anything else for flavor I'll get some chips and soak them to toss on the coals."
Tallahassee,2gbwwq,GTDesperado,2,Sun Sep 14 01:33:48 2014 UTC,Thanks! Anyplace in particular that you get the oak?
Tallahassee,2gbwwq,Derstn,2,Sun Sep 14 01:53:32 2014 UTC,There's some places that sell firewood. In the past my parents would go to a place on N. Monroe. They also sell small amounts of specialty wood.

Tallahassee,2g8dbp,ILIEKDEERS,8,Sat Sep 13 02:35:30 2014 UTC,"The owners of these businesses ignored the obvious for so long, it's surprising they didn't close sooner. Things like having two toilets for an establishment that saw over a thousand guests a night just weren't a concern worth looking into, and over time it's those kinds of things that drove people away."
Tallahassee,2g8dbp,Tbacot,3,Sat Sep 13 12:57:30 2014 UTC,"Oh, it dominated the flow of the room. A large portion of the people there on any given night would spend their entire visit in and around the bathroom/back bar area.

Tallahassee,2g79ib,rlaph,6,Fri Sep 12 14:08:19 2014 UTC,"I did research for the DeVoe Moore Center, which is Florida State University's public policy center. My supervisor was very interested in my research as long as the findings were in support of deregulation. I'm not surprised by this at all."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,scalpemnoles,1 point,Fri Sep 12 20:40:36 2014 UTC,"So just being curious, who is the Koch relationship manager in Tallahassee. The mullet wrapper called out Trice Jacobson, but she lives in DC. I assume that there must be someone in Tally managing their investment in FSU."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,Tallypunter,1 point,Wed Sep 24 20:35:35 2014 UTC,Can someone explain why this is an issue? I don't get it.
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,8,Fri Sep 12 14:34:04 2014 UTC,"Koch is not acting as a philanthropist, they are paying the university to do research whose outcome is predetermined by Koch, such that it benefits Koch's bottom line. Here is the masterplan, as articulated by the president of the foundation in question. It corrupts the institution because it's function is bought and paid for, as opposed to being determined by the scientific method. Koch is basically funding its own version of ""the facts"", specifically, the most profitable ones."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,-8,Fri Sep 12 15:10:07 2014 UTC,"I guess I'm just missing why this is an issue. If I donated money, I would want it to go to something I agree with."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,8,Fri Sep 12 15:15:56 2014 UTC,"right. if you were a patron of the arts, that would be one thing. But the outcome of science should be independent of profit motive. If people are wealthy enough to tell a bunch of scientists what the outcome of their research is, then the research is not free to be informed by truth. It is biased, and corrupted from the start."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,-7,Fri Sep 12 15:17:30 2014 UTC,So basically you're against big pharma et al. since their research is very profit driven? I was chemist in the private industry (oilfield) for a long time so I guess I'm just not understanding why profit driven research is bad.
Tallahassee,2g79ib,Kneeyul,9,Fri Sep 12 15:21:59 2014 UTC,"If big pharma told you the outcome of your trials ahead of time, and that your funding depended on ""getting"" those outcomes, the work would not have integrity. It is intentionally biased research."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Fri Sep 12 15:27:12 2014 UTC,"Thanks for being so amicable with me on this discussion. I still don't see the issue, but that's ok. Not everyone sees things the same way."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,Kneeyul,2,Fri Sep 12 15:31:11 2014 UTC,"That's a weird distraction to bring up big pharma. The point is that the objective goal of science is to take evidence and formulate a conclusion, NOT to say ""here's the conclusion we want, what evidence can we use to support it?""."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,-1,Fri Sep 12 15:28:50 2014 UTC,"It wasn't meant to be a distraction, but a relation."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,spookyjeff,4,Fri Sep 12 15:32:10 2014 UTC,"And again, the point is that the objective goal of science is to take evidence and formulate a conclusion, NOT to say ""here's the conclusion we want, what evidence can we use to support it?""."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,-2,Fri Sep 12 15:36:20 2014 UTC,"Interesting viewpoint. I guess coming from industry, science is seen a little different, where you're using it to build support."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,spookyjeff,1 point,Fri Sep 12 15:39:02 2014 UTC,"Ok, as a fellow chemist I'll take a shot at explaining this:  Imagine if you got a grant but it came with the stipulation that you would find that all chromium compounds with derivatives of a particular ligand catalyzed a reaction. You find a compound that actually inhibits this reaction. You should report this! Everyone thought this reaction proceeded via a mechanism that isn't actually correct if this compound doesn't work. You can't report this though because your continued funding depends on you finding a predetermined result.   In addition, it's good for non-profit driven institutions to exist alongside profit driven ones because it allows things that won't generate profit in the short term (or ever) but are still valuable, like all basic research."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,deathproof-ish,1 point,Fri Sep 12 18:24:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, whenever I go to conferences and listen to academic papers, i find them practically useless. For example, TAMU developed a method to detect corrosion within 0.01 mpy (milli-inches per year), but practically if corrosion is <7 mpy, then you can assume there's essentially no corrosion. So I have a huge disconnect with what academia is doing and what industry does. Like, it's a waste of money to develop a method to that degree of accuracy when it's unneeded."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,KieferSutherland,2,Fri Sep 12 19:59:34 2014 UTC,"That's the exact point, you think that degree of precision is unnecessary but in a decade we have devices that are only possible because we're capable of that level of precision. Its long-term."
Tallahassee,2g79ib,BlueSapphyre,2,Sat Sep 13 00:27:31 2014 UTC,I think Spookyjeff is the better chemist/scientist here. Can we give him an award or something?

Tallahassee,2g74it,brianala,1 point,Fri Sep 12 13:43:17 2014 UTC,"It's much more cost effective to buy prescription glasses online. Here's a good rundown of how to do it:   http://glassyeyes.blogspot.com/2007/10/online-eyeglasses-how-it-works.html  Basically, once you've had your eye exam, get a copy of your prescription. You'll need to measure your Pupillary Distance (PD) yourself, but it's easy to do. If you have an old pair of frames, you can use them to help figure out what will fit.   My favorite site to order from is http://www.zennioptical.com/  I've got about a dozen pair from them, the quality is pretty good, and you can get glasses as cheap as $7 including the lenses. It's totally worth it, unless you have a ridiculously strong prescription and need super thick lenses."

Rick Scott’s reelection campaign chair”  I think that pretty much sums up the spirit of the anti-Thrasher arguments. It isn't about ""How much actual teaching will he do?"" It's about ""Does he legitimately have the students' and faculty's best interest as his top priority?"""

Tallahassee,2g1cxq,OnceNFutureNick,1 point,Thu Sep 11 11:04:24 2014 UTC,"People first said Thrasher shouldn't even be allowed to interview, now they say he shouldn't advance... If you're against him before he even interviewed, you don't come across as very interested in finding the best candidate.  If running a major university was solely about dealing with students and faculty, maybe Thrasher would be a bad choice. Running FSU is about a hell of a lot more than students and faculty, unfortunately. Thrasher basically singlehandedly got FSU a medical school. He has a plan to rescue the Engineering program from the quagmire that is the shared program with FAMU. He wants to get the school more money for preeminency. These are things academics won't be able to do. In any case, he's got a JD from the best law school in Florida, so it isn't like he's some uneducated hillbilly.  I mean, seriously, how much teaching does a university president do? How often does he actually interact with faculty? Not very often, unless I miss my guess."

Tom Brown Park - Best park in town and an iconic Tallahassee land mark. Has recreational sports facilities from racquetball to disk golf and a myriad of trails to wander. There's a dog park, pavilions for events and if you're lucky you might get to see the police or fire fighters training on obstacle courses (pretty neat to watch imo).  Old Fort - Exactly what it sounds like. Nothing of the fort remains but it's footprint and mote still exist. Kinda cool to just sit in and use your imagination as to what it may have been like.  The Capitol - The capitol building isn't impressive, but the view it gives visitors over the town is. At the very top floor there is an art gallery that changes constantly and large glass windows all around the upper floor give you a breath taking view of the city as a whole.  Mission San Luis - an archaeological site that is still actively being researched from time to time (you'll see excavation teams out there sometimes) that was the site of a cohabitation between Spanish settlers and the indigenous tribes. The grounds are gorgeous and the reconstructed fort and community meeting 'hut' (it sat roughly 10,000 people so...realllllly big hut) are very interesting if you have an inclination towards history. They have employees that will sometimes dress in full period costume and tour you around the grounds in full character.  Can't think of any more now, but I tried to provide you with what I consider unique locations that are free or only require a small parking fee. Most all of these should be google-able and the farthest one from town is 15 minutes south of campus."

Tallahassee,2f8ese,WickThePriest,4,Wed Sep 17 06:12:09 2014 UTC,I haven't personally been there but I heard Tree to Tree Adventures at the Tallahassee Museum is really fun.
Tallahassee,2f8ese,bigllamas,4,Tue Sep 2 05:08:01 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's super fun. I went there for my birthday. It's pricey but worth going at least once. And you might as well do the longer course, it's worth the little extra."
Tallahassee,2f8ese,Waitatick,2,Tue Sep 2 05:52:38 2014 UTC,"Go to the multitude of springs and national forests around here.  Good light hiking trails, fun things to see/learn about, and ice cold water to numb your bodies after wearing yourselves out in the heat.  The chilrin are back in school now so there won't be any of those annoyingly loud and foul mouthed teenagers you'd like to pull under the waster, affix a large rock to, and leave them to drown."

Tallahassee,2f8ese,WickThePriest,2,Tue Sep 2 15:43:52 2014 UTC,This so sounds so dope.
Tallahassee,2f8ese,teap0ts,1 point,Thu Sep 4 01:03:43 2014 UTC,"You could do a greenway tour. There is Miccosukee and the JR Alford Greenway. If you don't mind a bit of a drive, Thomasville GA is really cute."
Tallahassee,2f8ese,BlueSapphyre,2,Fri Sep 5 04:46:05 2014 UTC,This sounds just like what I was looking for!

Tallahassee,2f8ese,clearliquidclearjar,1 point,Tue Sep 9 17:59:29 2014 UTC,"Are you looking for outdoor type adventures or indoor?   If you're looking for indoor fun, try one of the pottery painting studios in town. There is one at the student union and one on the north side of town in Market Square. If you're over 21, the one in Market Square allows you to dring wine while painting.   The Tallahassee Rock Gym in RR Square is a great way to get your lift on while spending time together."
Tallahassee,2f8ese,teap0ts,0,Tue Sep 2 14:04:04 2014 UTC,"Indoor and or outdoor! I'll definitely check out the pottery thing, girls love that lol"
