TheAntiFeminist,31wn0g,badthra,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"I believe that all people should be treated equally. There are feminazis, who twist the meaning of feminism to make it seem that women are better than men. This is not real feminism. Then there are the quiet masses of feminists who know that feminism is about equality. Just because they don't rage does not mean that they do not exist. Second-wave feminism made it clear that feminism is about dissolving traditional gender ideals that hold back any person from doing what they want to do or from being treated unfairly. That's it.   And this case is an example of the backlash from those who subscribe to a perverted version of feminism where they want women to be treated better than men, or they want to punish men, but I think this is just as wrong as oppressing women."
TheAntiFeminist,31wn0g,Dai_Einon,6,Wed Apr 8 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"Notice you didn't say anything about Patriarchy Theory, the central tenet of feminism (and if you don't believe it's central to all feminism, take a look at the Seneca Falls convention and the Declaration of Sentiments.  All branches of feminism stem from this the way all branches of Christianity stem from the first and the belief in God and Jesus).  Is that because you believe it too?  If not, you're not a real feminist.  And I'm sorry, but what you specifically believe does not change feminism.  Feminism doesn't become what you want it to be because it gives you cuddly warm feelings to think it's good and wonderful and it's just this variant group that's twisting it.  It doesn't become the hero of the story because you're such a good person and you want to be the hero of your story fighting for rights of the oppressed and all that.  It is what its actions, its founders, and its leaders show it to be.  And as you said, the ones that believe feminism is about equality (and these are not the real feminists) are quiet.  The ones that believe women are superior are the only ones talking about stuff other than ""not all feminists are like that"".  You and your kind of feminists don't matter to feminism as anything other than a shield.  You aren't real feminists, you're their tool.  You let them get away with and do whatever they want while bemoaning their actions with  ""well, they're not real feminists"" and ""oh what they do is so awful, no one should ever do that"" as if what you're saying makes it better as you go back to sipping your latte and doing fuck all about the problem.  You aren't the real feminist.  The real feminists are the ones going out and getting the right to vote without the responsibility of going to war.  They're the ones stripping the right to a trial away from men.  You don't affect anything feminism does.  You just provide an outlet because ""they're not real feminists""."
TheAntiFeminist,31wn0g,badthra,3,Thu Apr 9 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"Feminists are like Scientologists now-a-days.  You're always wrong and they are right.  They will always ""know"" more than you about the subject.    Patriarchy is something that is brushed under the rug until you get to OTIII.  Oh, and if you choose to leave or disagree, you're persecuted in every single way possible."
TheAntiFeminist,31wn0g,Dai_Einon,-1,Thu Apr 9 00:55:23 2015 UTC,"But I do believe in Patriarchy theory, I believe that women have been historically oppressed by men, but I support the feminist movement. Are you saying that it would be better to deny women the right to a vote and to a say in the government that is supposed to be representative of them? And I have never met a feminist, or encountered any sort of feminist online who says that women should not be allowed to fight for their countries. Feminism is about expecting equality, and that means in the places where society has been bent to force men to fit masculine ideals as well. And I really don't understand what you mean by doing fuck all about the problem. I see a problem, I speak out against it, I support an opinion. What do you want me to do? Feminism is not an organized group, and obviously I don't have a significant influence over the mob mentality of it.  And Seneca Falls HAPPENED because Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott wanted to speak up about women's rights, there's nothing in the Declaration of Sentiments that addresses feminism as a cause working to bring down men.   And the quiet masses do speak out. I don't understand what point you're trying to make. Feminists have had a clear hand in working towards reproductive healthcare for women, representation of women in government, addressing domestic abuse (of both men and women, since abuse cases are split fairly evenly over gender), addressing sexual harrassment and abuse (the amount of harassment that women in the military put up with is ridiculous, and I personally have been catcalled and I am a minor), talking about sexual objectification of women, of double standards between both men and women, and other issues. It's not fair to just say that the feminists who believe that feminism is about equality talk about nothing except how feminazis give feminism a bad name."
TheAntiFeminist,31wn0g,YabuSama2k,5,Thu Apr 9 01:35:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand the fine points of Patriarchy Theory.  It says men have always oppressed women and that men inherently want to oppress women (right off the bat, men bad, women good.  women better than bad man cause women moral).    This implies that every woman before feminism was a fucking moron that didn't think of asking for rights, because when looking at every other group that asked for something and got it, it was pretty fucking fast right after asking.  It implies that men are horrible people that love nothing more than to oppress women and are such dumb-asses that they don't even know how to do it properly (cause they manage to hurt themselves with it).  They don't say that women should not be allowed to fight for their countries because that would be denying something to women.  Feminists aren't about that.  Now actually going out and making protests about the draft not including women or getting it abolished the way you do for everything else?  No, you wouldn't do that either.  That would put women in danger.  Feminism isn't about that either.  Only men can get the danger.  Equality.  Feminism isn't an organized group?  Why don't you tell that to NOW?  Or to Feminist Frequency?  And if there's a mob mentality, you agree that it doesn't matter that if there are feminists that ""aren't like that"" because they don't matter to the mob.  Feminism doesn't explicitly say it's about bringing men down, but blaming all your problems on men is definitely a gateway to things such as #killallmen or ""I bathe in male tears"".  Quiet masses.  Speak out.  I don't think you realize how you sound.  You're working so hard to make yourself look good AND legitimize feminism that you're contradicting yourself.  Feminists had a hand in blocking reproductive services for men, blocking services for domestic abuse of men, hiding evidence of abuse against men, ignoring sexual harassment and abuse of men, ignoring the sexual objectification of men, ignoring the double standards that negatively affect men, and many other things that you like to overlook since feminism sounds good to you.  And you literally are doing nothing but talking about how feminazis give feminism a bad name, so you're not exactly a counter argument yourself.  And no, women were never oppressed.  Black Americans were oppressed.  Homosexuals were oppressed.  The Irish were oppressed.  Women were not.  You don't oppress someone by keeping them safe by having them pick berries and putting yourself in the position to get your asshole eaten out by a cougar.  You don't oppress someone by having them look after your kid while you go and get your salad tossed by a man eating animal or get speared by some other animal or poisoned by yet another.  You don't oppress someone by having them stay home while you go off to earn some psychological traumas while trying to avoid getting shot, stabbed, or beaten to death by another ""oppressor"".  A group isn't oppressed when they feel they can make demands of a king without any sort of repercussions.  A group isn't oppressed when they can ask for a vote and get it faster than any other group did when they asked it and do it without paying for it the way all the other groups did (with their bodies and their lives).  You don't oppress someone by constantly putting your own people in prisons more often or for longer periods of time, for whipping or killing people when they hurt the ones you're oppressing, or by giving the oppressed group everything they asked for even if it means conducting witch trials on your own people.  What you can do to oppress someone is make them do all the hard physical labor for you while you sit on your ass all day, make them die for you, and slowly strip them of everything by making them out to be idiotic and morally abhorrent so that it only makes sense to strip them of their rights as human beings because they are failures that need to be monitored closely by society and the morally superior ones.  You make it so you can do whatever you want to them but if they strike back, they get carted off for punishment immediately.  You make it so you can do this without trials, without hearings because these are the morally inept.  They cannot be trusted.  You make it so they work harder and pay more and even pay you for the rest of their lives if you can.  You make them your slave, and you make it so if they rebel against this by not working for you, they get carted off for punishment.  You strip them of their ability to speak out against the moral upper class, and you cast out any that refuse to follow your rules out of society.  You get them branded.  You make them lepers.  Of course if you really want to make this slavery last, you make the ones you're oppressing think they're hot shit.  You make them think they're the best society has to offer.  Then they'll die for you, lose limbs for you, and pay for you and do all the little things like pull your chair out and they'll do it happily.  Of course if you fuck up and keep calling them pieces of shit or calling them creeps, weirdos, and assholes, you might end up losing hold of them.  And that's where feminism fucked up.   It's not women that are oppressed and it never was, but it was women that complained.  Anywhere you see women being treated badly, you'll see your average man have it worse.  Feminism is full of bullshit, and you know what the biggest threat to bullshit is?  It's something feminists love to try to rid people of, like at the domestic violence conferences in Toronto.  It's free speech.  It's having people talk about their experiences.  But feminists like you keep trying to cast the blame somewhere else, and it's usually onto men.  Of course you're a minor so you probably don't know about all this stuff.  You probably don't watch the news or read into history beyond what's spoon-fed to you by your feminist teachers.  I'd recommend looking into it, because you've been lied to, and not by men.  If you'd like to start your research, you can verify a lot of what I'm telling you by looking in the side bar in the /r/mensrights subreddit or on girlwriteswhat's blog.  They've got sources  for everything I've claimed."

TheAntiFeminist,2xtsp3,whitey_sorkin,2,Wed Mar 4 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"It's not an argument, it's a fact and rape is rape."
TheAntiFeminist,2xtsp3,whitey_sorkin,-2,Wed Mar 4 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"Yes rape is rape, and nearly all of it is carried out by men."
TheAntiFeminist,2xtsp3,whitey_sorkin,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:33:32 2015 UTC,"I was raped by a woman.  Go and post your generalizations and ignorance elsewhere.  Evolutionary biology, psychology and sociology are just a few things you need to take into account instead of coming off as an ignorant and closed minded individual.    Regardless, more men are raped than women in the US.  Period."

TheAntiFeminist,2xgmwe,Theeeantifeminist,1 point,Sat Feb 28 14:19:08 2015 UTC,The 10 examples per gender make this example seem anecdotal when it is systemic.
TheAntiFeminist,2xgmwe,kizzan,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"Ya, I would have preferred someone use statistics rather than just 10 figures, but that's essentially feminist math."
TheAntiFeminist,2xgmwe,kizzan,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:26:39 2015 UTC,Maybe the chart could have showed top 10 male professions with their avg salary and do the same for women?
TheAntiFeminist,2xgmwe,kizzan,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:15:24 2015 UTC,"Ya, if I was decent at graphic design I would love to make infographics for this subreddit."
TheAntiFeminist,2xgnyt,Theeeantifeminist,3,Sat Feb 28 14:32:42 2015 UTC,Feminists don't understand that their hug box style of research does nothing but delude them.  Read up on history and see how irrelevant the sufferagettes were to the cause of universal sufferage.  All they accomplished was gaining women the privilege to have equal rights without equal responsability.    Universal sufferage was inevitable long before feminists were even a thing.
TheAntiFeminist,2xdfoq,Theeeantifeminist,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:47:40 2015 UTC,Link to the study  Great information from the study provided by /u/DejaBoo
TheAntiFeminist,2xdfoq,IlleFacitFinem,0,Fri Feb 27 18:19:39 2015 UTC,Here's another article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2449454/More-men-raped-US-women-including-prison-sexual-abuse.html
TheAntiFeminist,2wqziy,Theeeantifeminist,1 point,Sun Feb 22 10:05:53 2015 UTC,"God, this is so true..."
TheAntiFeminist,2wqyv4,Theeeantifeminist,2,Sun Feb 22 09:52:54 2015 UTC,Translation:   No one is agreeing with my insane nonsensical rhetoric and professional victimization so I must pack it in and accept defeat. Even still I will blame others for my failure which is why I quit in the first place.
TheAntiFeminist,2wqyv4,IlleFacitFinem,1 point,Sun Feb 22 09:54:15 2015 UTC,"Jessica Valenti also makes a living off of point out things as obvious as ""LGBT people face discrimination everyday"". She also talks about ""finally dealing with campus rape"" at a time when Campus rape is in severe decline. The gap between men and women is also closing.  I'll point out she also runs ""feministing"", a website that hosts authors that are radical feminists, that fail to read the sources they site, authors that insinuate that just because someone is female means that they are trustworthy while simultaneously saying that men are untrustworthy.   Honestly, I have no sympathy for them unless they are actually being threatened online. If they cant handle criticism they shouldn't be in this line of work, and I for one am not going to go easy on them just for being women."
TheAntiFeminist,2wqzpx,Theeeantifeminist,2,Sun Feb 22 10:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well, you're not wrong.  My worst idea was to give nukes to Iran and North Korea to see what happens."
TheAntiFeminist,2wqzpx,InWadeTooDeep,1 point,Sun Feb 22 10:52:36 2015 UTC,"The idea of feminists being armed is legit terrifying.  Obviously it's just a fantasy, although they can arm themselves, but hopefully they don't organize.  I hope that is a very old picture and the people carrying the signs have since realized how insane what they were saying is/was."
TheAntiFeminist,2wqzpx,InWadeTooDeep,1 point,Sun Feb 22 11:02:59 2015 UTC,"I'm more terrified of the idea of armed radical groups without any kind of stabilizing force, at that point you're basically in Afghanistan circa 1992."
TheAntiFeminist,2wqzpx,InWadeTooDeep,1 point,Sun Feb 22 11:15:18 2015 UTC,ISIS is the male version of what would happen if feminism became an armed movement.  haha
TheAntiFeminist,2wqzpx,InWadeTooDeep,1 point,Sun Feb 22 11:17:35 2015 UTC,"No, ISIL isn't gendered, it's just insanely shortsighted and violent."
TheAntiFeminist,2wqzpx,PleaseRespectTables,1 point,Sun Feb 22 11:21:46 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a long conversation.  But yes, it's a religious movement run by males.   Why you kill my joke?"
TheAntiFeminist,2wqz8b,Theeeantifeminist,1 point,Sun Feb 22 10:00:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought it looked like Wondermark!"
TheAntiFeminist,2wqz8b,BlueDoorFour,1 point,Thu Feb 26 04:48:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was looking for the original source.  :)"
TheAntiFeminist,2wm9yr,IlleFacitFinem,0,Sat Feb 21 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post.  Everyone welcome /u/IlleFacitFinem as the new official moderator here.  He'll be helping with everything from CSS to keeping stupid people in their place.  Although, so far we have yet to have a single problem.... I'm honestly quite amazed.  So, everyone say, ""Hi"" and don't feel afraid to message either of us with comments, suggestions, ideas or complaints.  :)  Thanks for being a part of the community!"
TheAntiFeminist,2wfw6g,Left4pillz,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"Scary and quick to draw-your-point argument.  However, it is scary how real this is becoming for men in modern society.  How much more do we have to kill ourselves before women stop immediately saying they try more often?!  sigh"
TheAntiFeminist,2vmzel,Theeeantifeminist,1 point,Thu Feb 12 09:46:09 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the author's comparison of male-bashing in the media to shark attacks. Spot on!
TheAntiFeminist,2v8deo,Theeeantifeminist,2,Sun Feb 8 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"Not a big fan of Fox News, but I love the last line in this piece: From equality to revenge."
TheAntiFeminist,2v8deo,kizzan,2,Sun Feb 8 22:46:30 2015 UTC,Why should the news source matter? Read the content and judge it from there.
TheAntiFeminist,2v8deo,kizzan,1 point,Mon Feb 9 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I agree, but as a Canadian, a few years ago we lost 4 soldiers to an IED and ambush in Afghanistan. Fox News pundits then went on the air mocking our soldiers and saying those guys died because they wear gay pink uniforms (they don't, and we spent ten years in that war losing guys every week).  After that Fox lost their broadcast rights in Canada (not a bad thing) and I've hated them ever since. What a way to treat your closest allies, who stood beside your country on 9-11, in Afghanistan, during Katrina and with the bail outs in '09."

TheAntiFeminist,2ukazq,Theeeantifeminist,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"It's too bad InfoWars is completely littered full of bullshit. Kind of hard to take anything seriously from Truthers or Anti-Vaxxers, even if they do make good point."
TheAntiFeminist,2ukazq,ffejulator,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"Ya, I was surprised who made it as well.  Regardless, it's funny as hell."
TheAntiFeminist,2ujdfz,Theeeantifeminist,6,Mon Feb 2 17:54:51 2015 UTC,"There are so many alternatives to tampons. I am sympathetic to women for having periods, but I am not concerned about which they use, considering there are so many alternatives.  So... I don't care about tampons. If you want to free bleed, who gives a fuck, you don't need a movement or hashtags for that, just stain your panties and move on like the inane moron you are."
TheAntiFeminist,2ujdfz,IlleFacitFinem,5,Mon Feb 2 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a health issue for others.  Imagine someone bleeding at the store or on a seat at the theater.  These people aren't just stupid, they are dangerous and stupid."
TheAntiFeminist,2ujdfz,IlleFacitFinem,5,Mon Feb 2 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you're going to bleed through your damn pants, stay at home. I would rather not catch diseases off your negligent behavior."
TheAntiFeminist,2ucymh,Insensbastard,1 point,Sun Feb 1 00:43:59 2015 UTC,Mine is in the link.  I'm going to actively push this sub-reddit.
TheAntiFeminist,2ucymh,Theeeantifeminist,2,Sun Feb 1 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for promoting.    Can you explain your link and title to me?  It just takes me to channel's you're subscribed to and to be honest, as nice as it is, it's not like an actual list outside of that site.  Thanks for being a part of the discussion."
TheAntiFeminist,2ucymh,Theeeantifeminist,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:01:07 2015 UTC,Interesting; I click it and it takes me to my YouTube channel page.  In any event.   Anyway my point was for those of us who do have YouTube channels to promote them here and additionally provide links to other's (eg Sargon of Akkad).  Ultimately it would be nice to have a YouTube community of anti-feminists I could collaborate with to get our message better heard and to host on my occasional streams.
TheAntiFeminist,2ucymh,Theeeantifeminist,2,Sun Feb 1 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea with one slight flaw.  I have no issue with videos from their channel being posted and I will probably setup links on the sidebar to channels like thunderf00t and The Amazing Atheist, etc.  Right now I am more focused on making this a community.  Sargon and all the rest have so many subscribers and stuff to do, they will not be part of the conversation here.  I could be wrong but they have a lot on their plate already  So I'm shaping this channel to be a community, we don't need to post channel links to people who have over 100,000 followers.  Their articles and videos are a nice addition but in starting this I was trying to create a community apart from them.  This is the subreddit for my YT channel, however I do want it to be a place where people can post information.  But a lot of those people already have their own subreddits or are just too busy to communicate.  I, fortunately, am unpopular right now and have less than 100 subscribers.  Therefore I am able to easily do this and stay an active part of the conversation.  I make no real income off my YouTube videos.  In fact, I disabled the ads you can skip for the time being, while the channel grows, because I hate them and I don't want people to associate me with ads or paid services.  Thanks for your comment, I'm a little buzzed so I hope mine was coherent.  If not, talk to my horse Paul, he's great with analogies."
