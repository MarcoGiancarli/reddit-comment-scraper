UnusualArt,3dr935,KarmaNeutrino,4,Sat Jul 18 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"This creepy piece was created by Buddy Nestor using graphite, spray and acrylic. His website is here, along with the rest of the series. Here's what he says about this series:   “My latest series of paintings are portraits of female artists.  These physical and psychological images are my attempt to capture the true nature of humanity.  They are spiritual X-Rays.  The models that I use in my work are all beautiful women.  However, there is nothing beautiful about the portraits I create.”      Commentary from http://www.juxtapoz.com/   Buddy Nestor was an abstract painter until a few years ago when he struck a strange new chord with portraiture that took his work to a new level. Derivative of his abstract style, Nestor's ""spiritual x-ray"" portraits are intended to remove the mask of beauty to reveal darker, more honest aspects of the personalities of his subjects.  Belying his intention of removing beauty, and regardless of how uncomfortable his works are to many people, they are paradoxically comprised of pleasing shapes and muted colors, like marbleized colored plastic or objects seen through distorted glass. They are mesmerizing and even beautiful, disturbing only when their full context is realized.  The uncanny and destabilizing nature of his work is powerful.  It mesmerizes and confuses the logic of the viewer opening up cracks in the psyche.  This is one of the most important things art can do: open the mind."

The majority of your content is link submissions to your own domain, thefarpavilion.com, and therefore if your user page were submitted to /r/spam, you would be shadowbanned. I believe you have good intentions, and therefore I won't do it, but you need to fix this.  If you read the reddit rules, then you can see that what you are doing is spam. A good rule to follow is the 10:1 ratio of other comments/posts to posts from your own website, and this would mean that you are not simply promoting yourself, and are actually interacting with the community. As it says in the rules, 'Submitting links from your own site, talking with redditors in the comments, and also submitting cool stuff from other sites.' is acceptable.

UnusualArt,3bldlj,Madbrad200,2,Tue Jun 30 04:03:22 2015 UTC,"Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War) (1936) is a painting by Spanish Surrealist Salvador Dalí. Dalí made this painting to represent the horrors of the Spanish Civil War. Dalí painted this work six months before the Spanish Civil War had even begun and then claimed that he had known the war was going to happen in order to appear to have prophet-like abilities due to ""the prophetic power of his subconscious mind."" Dalí may have changed the name of the painting after the war in a manner of proving this prophetic quality, though it is not entirely certain.      This painting expresses the destruction during the Spanish Civil War. The monster in this painting is self-destructive just as a Civil War is. This painting is not meant to depict choosing sides. Dalí also made this painting look very realistic and yet continued to bring in surreal concepts. Although humans do not have the potential to look like the creatures in this painting, it retains a realistic feel, reminding the viewer of the levity of the ideas behind it. Dalí also brought ideas of tradition to this piece with a beautiful Catalonian sky, creating contrast to the idea of revolution. There are many boiled beans in this painting. Dalí is quoted as saying the reason he included boiled beans was ""one could not imagine swallowing all that unconscious meat without the presence of some mealy and melancholy vegetable."" By this he meant that there were many hardships in the war so the Spanish citizens had to do their best to deal with their problems. He played with themes of love, eating, and the war and how they are all related.   Source."
UnusualArt,3bldlj,crisbot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"I don't ever doubt his ability to paint but oh boy, was he full of himself. He screamed for attention in any which way. If he would have had a pet sloth instead of an anteater he would be reddit's art version of Nikola Tesla."
UnusualArt,3blzvu,HobbyDaily,5,Tue Jun 30 08:25:32 2015 UTC,"Reddit is full of unnecessary downvoting.  It's the one aspect that tarnishes the experience of being on this site.  Want to compliment someone's post?  Make a joke in response to someone?  Have an intelligently-expressed opinion that someone disagrees with?  All of these things are often silently downvoted.  The practice of downvoting is negative and tedious to experience and I'm happy to see subs that don't utilize it.    If it's important to disagree with someone, the lack of a downvote means that you have to actually write and express your opinion, and that's not a bad thing."
UnusualArt,3blzvu,maoista,3,Tue Jun 30 12:02:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%, the problem is you can not remove the downvote. I can simply hide it and there are still ways to downvote and people do it all the time. This means that people who know how to cheat the system do it while the rest are unable to. That is why I am asking this question and whatever the poll shows that will be it regardless of what I think.  Regards."
UnusualArt,3blzvu,ActualMemeShia,2,Tue Jun 30 12:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to note what the Reddit voting system is for; sorting relevant content.

Users should keep that in mind when making their votes, and not let their opinions guide them  completely."
UnusualArt,3blzvu,KarmaNeutrino,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:05:21 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it is necessary. If it breaks the rules it will be removed; if it is bad content, just ignore it, or if you want, leave a comment explaining why it is bad content. Posts will still be downvoted, but from mobile users or the front page - I believe it will make the sub more positive on the whole, and encourage conversation."

UnusualArt,3a510t,TallahasseWaffleHous,8,Wed Jun 17 11:22:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. Title would have you believe that this started on the ground, when in reality that tree is on borrowed time. Someone picked that spot six feet off the ground, skinned it, planed it, and then nailed 7/8ths of a chair into it."
UnusualArt,3a510t,faxseedoil,13,Wed Jun 17 11:37:05 2015 UTC,That's the idea. Even if it is not shown a lot of trees are killed in order to make chairs and stuff. I will try finding the article to give you better understanding of the concept
UnusualArt,3a510t,faxseedoil,11,Wed Jun 17 12:45:44 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting concept. Next the artist should half-skin a cow, and pull half a leather jacket over one of its front legs, stitched to it's hide.   /s     I understand the concept, but I feel that if the purpose is to protest the killing of trees, then the artistic expression of the protest should not be the killing of a tree."

UnusualArt,33hzwm,comprop,2,Thu Apr 23 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I did exactly what you're talking about with the 2x mushroom piece, but the photo doesn't do it justice. There are a ton subtle intricacies and depth that you only get by looking at it closely and from different angles.   I would feel like I accomplished a lot if even 1 person felt inspired by my art! Thanks for that (:   e: some tips for creating string art-   Drywall is much better than actual wood. Since it's significantly easier to get the nails hammered in, designs can become really complex. I used about 300 nails in the first photo and it held up great. My SO thought it was going to crumble for some reason. Plus it's really nice to paint. I sketched my designs on the drywall and simple acrylic paint covered it beautifully. It surprised me.  For the string- I used various yarns (bought cheaply online) with weights ranging from fingering, to sport, and DK. On the second pic, I used heavier yarns- worsted and aran sizes. I'd also recommend getting a nice glue to hide the ends. I like to use tacky glue.   It's not that important for the nails to line up, numerically, if that makes sense. As long as they're equidistant, you can lay down the yarn wherever. However that leaves many imperfections as far as symmetry and continuity goes. On the small mushroom, I was careful to correspond all of the nails. On the 2x mushroom piece, I just put the nails in evenly across the design. It saved quite a lot of time.  Sorry for the novel haha, but these were really fun to make! I have a few more ideas I want to try out soon too."

When I went to colour it however, I attempted to inject more positive energy into it and I feel a lot of that hatred was nullified into a more interesting and balanced work. The work has a fire element to it, with hair the colour of blood, with a green almost grinchlike feel ot the skin.

He reports:  ""I was walking very fast when my foot caught on something that sent me stumbling a few meters away, I wanted to know the cause. In a dream I had built a palace, a castle or caves, I cannot express it well... I told no one about it for fear of being ridiculed and I felt ridiculous myself. Then fifteen years later, when I had almost forgotten my dream, when I wasn't thinking of it at all, my foot reminded me of it. My foot tripped on a stone that almost made me fall. I wanted to know what it was... It was a stone of such a strange shape that I put it in my pocket to admire it at my ease. The next day, I went back to the same place. I found more stones, even more beautiful, I gathered them together on the spot and was overcome with delight... It's a sandstone shaped by water and hardened by the power of time. It becomes as hard as pebbles. It represents a sculpture so strange that it is impossible for man to imitate, it represents any kind of animal, any kind of caricature.""  ""I said to myself: since Nature is willing to do the sculpture, I will do the masonry and the architecture""  For the next thirty-three years, Cheval picked up stones during his daily mail round and carried them home to build the Palais idéal. He spent the first twenty years building the outer walls. At first, he carried the stones in his pockets, then switched to a basket. Eventually, he used a wheelbarrow. He often worked at night, by the light of an oil lamp.  The Palais is a mix of different styles with inspirations from Christianity to Hinduism. Cheval bound the stones together with lime, mortar and cement.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval#Palais_id.C3.A9al"

I have a few other similar paintings like this. The series is called ""Animals with Issues"". They each have a story with them. Barry the Bossy Beheaded Bear, Harriet, the Hottie Hooker Hog, Jacob the Jellyfish with Jaundice.  Barry's story is:  ""How can you be bossy when you're beheaded you might ask? The answer is you can't. Thus is the reason why everyone and anyone Barry has every bullied and made to feel inferior, rallied together and nipped that problem in the bud! Let this be a lesson to all the Barry's of the world. You can't just push anyone around because you've had a bad day or even just because you're an asshle and you just feel like it. Your day will come. It might not be tomorrow or next week but it will come unless you check yourself. Until then, sleep with one eye open because we're watching, motherfuer.  Barry the Bossy Beheaded Bear is one of those rare ""MUST HAVE"" pieces for your home or office. When you see him, you'd better snatch him up because he just might not be around much longer. Barry comes from a set of other friends which I lovingly refer to as ""Animals with Issues"". The Animals with Issues series was created to show that animals have real problems too just like us. These animals would appreciate any love and support you can give them. It doesn't matter if you want to horde them all for yourself or share them with someone you know would love to own Barry or one of his many problematic friends. Or you could even just give them a shout out. It's all good with Barry and his friends."""

This website offers some insight:   Korean artist Ji Yong-Ho combines various types of tires to create unusual realistic sculptures of animals. In Lion 2 he used stainless steel structures, in order to express the dynamic features of four-legged animal. The limbs of the Lion 2 are elaborated with shredded motorcycle tires and the fur is represented with turned out tires. Tires are a medium that translate what the artist means to express most sufficiently. The black tires are reminiscent of industrialization, which includes industrial material, industrial wastes, and even environmental pollution. He focuses on mutated animals and especially on artificial mutation. His works seem terrorizing and strong but the truth is that they are fragile and unstable. Yong Ho Ji's intention is to send a message of warning on environmental destruction and a human-caused threat to itself."

I am still working on the site for UnusualArt and having some difficulties with money I have to do it all by myself.  The second reason why I have been so busy is this cute little friend. I found him in my backyard a baby deer out of nowhere. I took care of him for days until I was able to contact the Local zoo, who made an appointment with me and took the deer in the next day.  Sadly the other deer rejected and bullied the little fellow and after around 2 weeks he was sad, underfed and totally isolated.  The zookeeper suggested I take it back home to see if he feels better and as you can see in the video he feels much better.  Anyway I have no clue what is good and what is bad for a young deer so I beg you, give me as much advice as possible or share this video so someone with knowledge can help me.  I think I already posted it to /r/aww /r/animals /r/wildlife if you know another place where I can find someone who can help please, post it there or send me a PM.  Sorry for the long post!"

I love the series. It's so intimate, but you have to use your imagination. You imagine the day the pictures were taken, how brave and stupid it is to smile when you don't know what's in store for you.  You think about what must have happened between the people in the pictures-- Betrayal.. or an accident.. Heartache.. Regret. Maybe the people who submitted the pictures still love the people in the pictures and wish they didn't. But they do, so they can't just throw them away. Someone needs to guard the memories, but they don't want to do it anymore.   All the pets. Exes. Parents.  Ubi Sunt? It's an old saying: ""Where are they?"" Maybe we don't want to know.

""  The series began when Malm stumbled onto the rusting bolts at a barn in Bergsladen, Sweden.   He immediately recognized the wide caps and slender stems as having humanistic qualities so he gathered them up and proceeded to heat, forge, twist and bend them into shape in his studio.  The resulting collection of sculptures titled Bolt Poetry, evokes humanistic moments of affection, sadness, and pain. You can see more of his work on Behance."

The interesting thing about this method is there are so many lines that you literally don't know the end result until it is finished - so here you go - ""the snail"" :)   there are many interesting details about the snail. the first one is the snail possesses the most contrast so it is what your eye is automatically drawn to.. and then your eye wanders INTO the painting as there is much depth.. winding along many many paths that wind and twist, only differentiated by their colours and patterns. On the bottom left there is a field of psychadelic flowers and to the right a field with many tiny men all hanging out, climbing the rainbow road, and swimming in the bubble stream.   This painting throws perspective out the window.. with trees popping out of nowhere and growing out and through each other.. giving a glass-like feeling to some of it. Giant flowers spring up around the snail and giant blades of what seem like grass.. with tubes that feed life giving nutrients to the entire scenario.. often looking like roads flowing through these blades. To the bottom left there are blue and red 'veins"" - much like the chamber s of the heart pumping life blood throughout the system. In it's chaos there is much bizarre and strange order, as well as a twising spiralling feeling throughout the entire picture. No colour was not used in this painting.   Paradoxically a tree grows out of the shell of the snail. Many branches morph to form roads and pathways.. a truly organic systam. White and orange flowers bloom on opposite ends, balancing the painting out.   This painting was made using indian inks.   Shawn Dall"

Edy Hardjo, the photographer behind the project, uses detailed, high-quality action figures to put some of our favorite superheros into hilarious and sometimes compromising positions.  After putting the figures into their picture-perfect poses, he removes the stands he uses to prop them and some of the more obvious joints with Photoshop to make them seem more life-like.

UnusualArt,2xismc,Shuleek,2,Sun Mar 1 12:27:18 2015 UTC,"The Gashlycrumb Tinies:       The Gashlycrumb Tinies: or, After the Outing is an abecedarian book written by Edward Gorey that was first published in 1963. Gorey tells the tale of 26 children (each representing a letter of the alphabet) and their untimely deaths in rhyming dactylic couplets, accompanied by the author's distinctive black and white illustrations. It is one of Edward Gorey's best-known books,  and is the most notorious amongst his roughly half-dozen mock alphabets.  It has been described as a ""sarcastic rebellion against a view of childhood that is sunny, idyllic, and instructive"".  The morbid humor of the book comes in part from the mundane ways in which children die, such as falling down the stairs or choking on a peach. Far from illustrating the dramatic and fantastical childhood nightmares, these scenarios instead poke fun at the banal paranoias that come as a part of parenting.

The hydrographic process can be used on metal, plastic, glass, hard woods, and various other materials. Also commonly known as ""hydro dipping"" due to the fact that the parts are dipped in water.  The water transfer printing process is extensively used to decorate items that range from entire all-terrain vehicles and car dashboards, to small items like bike helmets or other automotive trim. Films can be applied to all types of substrates including plastic, fiberglass, wood, ceramics, and metal. For the most part, if the item can be dipped in water and can be painted using traditional techniques then the hydrographic printing process can be used.    In the process, the substrate piece to be printed is pre-treated and a base coat material is applied. A polyvinyl alcohol film is gravure-printed with the graphic image to be transferred, and is then floated on the surface of a vat of water.

UnusualArt,2w27dr,Gotitaila,4,Mon Feb 16 11:11:59 2015 UTC,"I love this, but I read somewhere that Starry Night was actually the view from van Gogh's room at an insane asylum mixed with some buildings he remembered from other cities."
UnusualArt,2w27dr,veganpainter_,2,Mon Feb 16 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"The best part of van gogh's starry night, in my opinion, is that the sky/ distant background looks like a giant wave crashing over a town. I think this fails to capture that."

UnusualArt,2w27dr,EvianKerbalnaut,2,Wed Mar 11 20:08:16 2015 UTC,"You mean something that emphasizes the ""wave""? I don't know of any, I just sort of noticed it by looking at the picture."
UnusualArt,2w27dr,Aspel,2,Thu Mar 12 23:35:05 2015 UTC,"Alex Ruiz  often wondered about how the night sky looked to Van Gogh when he painted 'Starry Night - this is an homage to him, and to his painting, one of Ruiz all time favorites.   We see him standing here, looking up at the night sky...probably in awe, as he wondered how he would capture the beauty he saw.  More info here"

It is a piece of art created over W H Mallock's 1892 novel A Human Document whose title results from the partial deletion of the original title: A Human document.'  Phillips drew, painted, and collaged over the pages, while leaving some of the original text to show through. The final product was a new story with a new protagonist named Bill Toge, whose name appears only when the word ""together"" or ""altogether"" appears in Mallock's original text.  When asked about the book, Phillips replied:    Image i - First page of A Humument, 1970 edition     Interesting: Tom Phillips (artist) | Erasure (artform) | Altered book | Dark Star (band)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

UnusualArt,2uxu30,HATEWAGON,-1,Fri Feb 6 21:51:17 2015 UTC,This is very nice. The thing I'm not sure about us why'd it have to be black and white.
UnusualArt,2uxu30,ablair24,9,Fri Feb 6 06:18:39 2015 UTC,"I would guess that its done on purpose since typically if the words ""world hunger"" come up, African nations are the first to come to mind. Also Americans have the stereotype of gluttony. So the artist is probably playing off of those two ideas."
UnusualArt,2uxu30,DeathSpell55555,18,Fri Feb 6 07:53:27 2015 UTC,Also the Yin Yang sign is white and black
UnusualArt,2uxu30,ColdWaterEnthusiast,6,Fri Feb 6 11:40:09 2015 UTC,Yep. Stereotype. Obesity is a problem everywhere.
UnusualArt,2uxu30,ablair24,1 point,Fri Feb 6 13:42:24 2015 UTC,"This makes more sense than yin yang to me. As I thought yin yang is more about a balance between the opposite forces, if I'm not wrong on that."
UnusualArt,2uxu30,ablair24,3,Fri Feb 6 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, supposedly it is supposed to be a balance, and I guess the artist wanted to show how imbalanced the situating with hunger is. I don't remember where I read this, but I heard that the world already has enough food for nobody to be hungry, but the food is in the wrong places. Most likely because of how the world economy works."
UnusualArt,2uxu30,tidbitsz,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"This is what I found after a quick search. According to USDA's site one-third calories are wasted in the US, but basically from the link:   In short, those with financial resources outbid the poor and increase hunger.   Maybe countries with predominantly white populations are more affluent, and it would make sense in that context of world hunger and poverty."

UnusualArt,2uxu30,6F6A9O9,4,Fri Feb 6 18:41:43 2015 UTC,because yin and yang is black and white? would you rather the artist use an obese albino black person and an anorexic dark sun tanned white person? would that make you feel better?...

My guess is that there is an easier way down somewhere out of the shot and this poor beast either slipped or was overcrowded over the edge. The shot is really great but the perceived social implications make this photo really over the top.

UnusualArt,2pkst2,happyasashpigit,2,Wed Dec 17 14:17:31 2014 UTC,Vik Muniz is one of my favorite artists. I really like the linked creation as well as when he had a plane draw a cloud in the sky.  He has a TED talk where he talks about some interesting things. More of his work can be found at vikmuniz.net.  EDIT: links
UnusualArt,2pkst2,hooch,2,Wed Dec 17 14:23:52 2014 UTC,Thanks for this! There's a lot of detail there and the idea of doing a portrait of an expressionist artist in that same style is kind of meta.
UnusualArt,2pkst2,hooch,2,Wed Dec 17 14:45:04 2014 UTC,This is my futile attempt to draw like Jackson Pollock. [OC]

""Dumala places plasterboard painted in black under the camera. Each phase of movement is engraved with thin needles. He scratches the paint and thus obtains white lines and hatches on the dark background. Each drawing has a very high graphic value. However, after being recorded, every drawing is repainted with black paint so that they live shorter than a drawing made by a finger on a steamy window. His work has placed him among the greatest creators who have improved the technique of animation with original innovations."""

Why do we gameify art so much, trying to make it a puzzle we have to guess the meaning of?  This stuff's raw, brutal, eroticised, angry.  It's a punch in the guts or a hand own your pants.  Not a fucking Rubik's cube.  It's propaganda, yeah, and it mirrors the sex, violence and power fantasy of advertising as well.  Not everything has to be a locked box just so we can, in critiquing it, congratulate ourselves on our own cleverness.  In fact, fuck, when has that ever been what art's about?"

There was a huge controversy back when the show was popular over the purple teletubby being gay because he was purple and had a purse among other things.  Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? Well it was, but it was a real thing.   It's really amazing how far we've come in terms of homophobia.  The art is a bit dated with that reference though.  On a side note teletubies was a godawful shoe and ushered in the age of mind numbing childrens shows. Jim henson and stuff like seasame street taught kids by being educational and telling jokes and being colorful. Teletubies was mind numbing nonsense where the colorful characters spoke in jibberish and lead to a weird generation of kids shows that treated toddlers like idiots."

I've been on my phone and wasn't able to make a clean cut post for this exciting new opportunity.  All applications will be looked over, discussed and shared among the current roster of moderators. Unfortunately in this situation, the application is your first impression. I wish you all the best of luck and look forward to reading what you guys submit and mostly I look forward to bringing on two new team members as /r/UnusualArt climbs in subscribers every day!"
UnusualArt,2oyfmi,happyasashpigit,2,Thu Dec 11 08:45:54 2014 UTC,"I have always loved /r/unusualart from the moment I found it and I would love to apply for the mod position.  I live in the MST timezone of the US.  I work 30 hours a week at a local pub and another 30 a week from home doing art, design, and web dev work. I wouldn't be able to work on mod work while I am at the pub and it usually consists of 2 nights a week along with 3 days a week (shifts are around 6 hours with a beer and a meal at the end of them). I have a set schedule but it shifts constantly as we all try to cover for each other to go have fun spending all that hard earned cash. I would have no problem doing mod work alongside the work I already do at home. It is usually sitting at the computer anyway and there is almost always a reddit tab or two open.  I don't have any previous mod exp. I have however been an active community member with a pention for positivity on various social media platforms. I have been to local meetups and met the local mods who are great and we seem to easily speak the same language. I have done work for mods in the past such as designing new Snoo logos and subreddit banners. I feel like I understand mod culture and I would love to be a part of it.  I have done work on web UI and UX and I would like to carry that over to the wonderful world of /r/unusualart. I would like to redesign the sidebar structure and color palette while still keeping the original intent of its purpose. I like the banner and I would like to ask the community what they think about it. If they think that it should be redesigned or augmented in anyway I think that we should give the people what they want. I have a full suite of design tools at my hands as well as the experience behind me to know how to use them to their full potential. I would like to utilize my tools and skills to make /r/unusualart the most unusual and wonderful sub it can be.  There are plenty of unusual facts about me but I think that the most impressive is that I can pee VERY high into the air. Years ago I would drunkenly challenge random bar people to a pissing contest and I never lost.  I have made some unusual, along with some formal, artwork and I put the pieces up on my art blog. Anyone is welcome to check things out and I hope that you enjoy the heavy reddit references in some of the image descriptions. I hope you like what you see here and if you have any questions you know where to find me. Thanks for the opportunity and I hope to hear from you soon.  EDIT: I also should note that I spend a lot of time shooting down spam accounts on Twitter and Instagram because I want to keep content visible that is worth viewing. I understand TOS very well and adhere to reddiquette with my commenting, posting, and voting behavior. I want to keep /r/unusualart a place to see unusual art with an understanding that unusual art is a term that is difficult to define."

UnusualArt,2o1vho,avonelle,1 point,Tue Dec 2 21:56:23 2014 UTC,no idea but you can see some sort of oil laid down before the paint process.  So it would have to be a paint that doesn't mix with oil? I'm no artist though. Look up Turkish Water Painting. Or there is a top comment on youtube with a  link
