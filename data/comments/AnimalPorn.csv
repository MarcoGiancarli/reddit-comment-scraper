Although the cheetah can sprint to speeds of 75mph for a maximum of 12-15 seconds before overheating, it does not have much strength to take down its prey. Its body is designed to be lightweight so that the muscles only have to carry 125lbs at the most, so their bones are lighter. They're also very slim, to prevent wind resistance when sprinting. However, this leaves them without the kind of bulk that the lion has. The cheetah's small head also prevents it from having an extremely powerful bite force. Because of this, cheetahs must kill their prey swiftly, at the neck, using what energy they have left after the enormous burst of speed!"

AnimalPorn,3cxg9d,ProLicks,3,Sun Jul 12 01:07:22 2015 UTC,I mostly agree.  But it's fun watching them flutter around the flowers.
AnimalPorn,3cxg9d,Science_Babe,5,Sun Jul 12 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd never been completely grossed out by a photo of a dragonfly before, but here were are."

AnimalPorn,3cwmev,Byeka,12,Sat Jul 11 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"The hardest aspect of shooting mating ladybugs is not laughing when the male wiggles his backside -gonna have to work out the lighting so I can film it...  Tech Specs: Canon 70D (F16, 1/250, ISO 100) + a Canon MP-E 65mm macro lens (around 3x) + a diffused MT-24EX. This is a single, uncropped, frame taken hand held.  Technique: I'm holding on to the leaf they are on with my left hand, and resting the lens on that same hand to keep everything steady. Then I went looking for an angle that would let me get as much in focus as possible -both of their leading eyes have to be in focus."
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,pmcg115,6,Sat Jul 11 12:10:12 2015 UTC,"Literally posting animal porn (or insect porn) to animal porn.  I'm oddly impressed.  Great photo too.  Well done, OP."
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,Byeka,2,Sat Jul 11 16:32:11 2015 UTC,Thanks :D
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,crassbandicoot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:16:19 2015 UTC,Technically insects are animals so it works.
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,wtfjen,2,Sat Jul 11 19:35:58 2015 UTC,Huh... the more you know.
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,whooshing,3,Sat Jul 11 21:12:37 2015 UTC,Their surface texture reminds me of a citrus fruit. Beautiful little creatures.
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,LafayetteHubbard,2,Sat Jul 11 20:42:06 2015 UTC,Thanks :)
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,aazav,2,Sat Jul 11 21:12:31 2015 UTC,I'm interested in the different head colors. OP do you know if this is a sexual dimorphism?
AnimalPorn,3cwmev,oneawesomeguy,3,Sat Jul 11 13:55:01 2015 UTC,I don't think so -pretty much the standard color for 21 Spot Ladybugs.

AnimalPorn,3csqj9,hinklefinkledinkledo,17,Fri Jul 10 13:50:40 2015 UTC,What a trip. It looks like the picture is upside down and the calf is jumping into the air
AnimalPorn,3csqj9,falconx50,12,Fri Jul 10 16:37:03 2015 UTC,I was 100% convinced this picture was upside down. Great photo and perspective.

AnimalPorn,3cpkk3,soulteepee,4,Thu Jul 9 23:31:32 2015 UTC,They're amazing.  I saw them at the National Zoo and I'd never seen anything like them.
AnimalPorn,3cpkk3,sizyy,3,Thu Jul 9 23:50:54 2015 UTC,Im going to be the Angelina Jolie of adopting those africans.
AnimalPorn,3cpkk3,Vindette,2,Fri Jul 10 06:33:35 2015 UTC,So beautiful. I have this photo as a desktop background; they've got to be my favorite wild animals.
AnimalPorn,3cpkk3,NASTY_the_villian,2,Fri Jul 10 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"These guys are about as vicious as animals come, they've been exterminated in many parts of Africa because of it. They are stunning though!"

AnimalPorn,3ckkdj,hinklefinkledinkledo,7,Wed Jul 8 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"If that's from the video I remember, the shark got him on the third or fourth pass. Valiant effort on the seals part though."
AnimalPorn,3ckkdj,surfnaked,4,Wed Jul 8 21:20:19 2015 UTC,"Shots of this sort of thing are fairly comon. Half the time the seal gets away because the shark doesn't have the turn radius. Seal cuts inside his turn radius, drops to the sea bottom, and sswims away. The other half the time the first hit does enough to make the seal...shark bait."
AnimalPorn,3ckkdj,DragonflyRider,0,Thu Jul 9 02:12:28 2015 UTC,SHARK BAIT HOO HAHA!
AnimalPorn,3ckkdj,Ficadin,2,Thu Jul 9 15:14:31 2015 UTC,I hope I never comeback as a Seal.

AnimalPorn,3cjrt3,alpinebodhi,2,Wed Jul 8 13:32:20 2015 UTC,How did you get so close?
AnimalPorn,3cjrt3,fuzzusmaximus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I didn't intend on being so close. I was actually shooting a different batch of elk from afar when I heard him behind me.  I also had a zoom lens (18-200mm) that I was using."
AnimalPorn,3cjrt3,fuzzusmaximus,2,Fri Jul 10 13:24:12 2015 UTC,It's a fantastic pic.  I checked it on Flickr and saw that the lens was at 150mm so I had to ask.  I couldn't imagine being able to get that close to an Elk.
AnimalPorn,3cjrt3,fronkey,2,Fri Jul 10 13:41:33 2015 UTC,I didn't either.  I should have been paying better attention.  It is not something I ever plan on doing again.  I try to keep a large distance from wildlife even if they are as mellow as this guy was.  Thanks so much for taking the time to look at my photo.

Can I ask what sort of equipment you used to waterproof your camera? I just received a waterproof DSLR bag and I'm a bit nervous about using it for the first time, but I would love to shoot similar shots."
AnimalPorn,3cjdyo,KidCadaver,2,Wed Jul 8 15:25:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the love!  I use a Gopro for my underwater photos.  I have a Hero4 Black.  I'm still saving for a big SPL waterhousing for my Canon!
