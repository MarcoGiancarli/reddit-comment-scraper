ASA is one of the largest groups that accredits appraisers, so anyone they refer you to would be properly trained and accredited to complete the appraiser. (And they cover Canada as well as the U.S. and overseas.)  You can also try their ""Find An Appraiser"" feature on their website. You will want to indicate that you need an appraiser in the Personal Property Discipline, and I'd likely start with one that has a Specialties in General Residential Contents. (They also accredit appraisers in business valuation, equipment appraisal and a few other areas.)  If that doesn't work, you can also check out the Appraisers Association of America. That group only has Personal Property appraisers, but since that is what you need, they would be able to help."

whatsthisworth,3dymef,littlecakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:40 2015 UTC,Great looking machine! The intentions were good to replace the cord but it should be done with a proper grounded appliance cord.  A good spot to attach the ground wire is just under the base where a cord holder is screwed in.  You want to grease the bearings and check the brushes too. This model is from the early thirties.  Value depends on condition which has a lot to do with weather it can be safely used and cosmetics such as chrome pitting and enamel chipping.
whatsthisworth,3dymef,Numismatic,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:23 2015 UTC,I've restored one of these before. I believe there is a large copper plate bolted to the interior in the hollow neck to which the ground attaches.

whatsthisworth,3dkdl6,bigblacksquirrel,3,Fri Jul 17 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"PBA charges 37% of their hammer price as fees. For such a popular book/author and with the media attention around Watchmen you're better off just auctioning it on eBay.  OP you're right the value varies too much to put a concrete number on it just put it up for auction (10-day on a Thursday or 7-day on a Sunday, around 8-10pm) and let your bidders work out the price. Personally I would start it at $500 to guarantee that minimum but you could start it lower with a reserve, or higher without one if you'd prefer. If you have any proof it was signed that will help the selling price, if not it could be worth it to send it to an authenticator."
whatsthisworth,3dkdl6,capincus,2,Fri Jul 17 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"37% is outrageous. I agree with you about putting it on eBay because of the buzz around Harper Lee and Go Set A a Watchman right now, but I just checked the sold listings for signed Harper Lee items and the prices are all over the place. Any idea how much it costs to get an autograph authenticated by someone reputable?"
whatsthisworth,3dkdl6,bigblacksquirrel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"My bad it's actually 34%. They break it apart into two sections 17% from the seller and 20% from the buyer (multiplied for 34%), but both fees are calculated on a mysterious nonexistant hammer price and the sale prices they show include both fees. Their estimates are also a joke I sold a book with them a couple months ago and their estimate for it was exactly the same as a copy they'd sold a few months prior in worse condition, neither copy actually sold for the estimate. For niche or extremely rare books they're a good option (although anything over $5k I'd go with HA/Christie's/Sotheby’s) but anything likely to sell relatively quickly eBay is probably a better bet.  I don't actually know never had an authentication done, and to be honest an authentication is as easy if not easier to fake than a signature so I've never put any stock in them. But it's probably worth comparing prices on reputably authenticated sale prices vs. non-authenticated prices to see if the cost (whatever it is) will amount to more money."
whatsthisworth,3dkdl6,capincus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:50:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes more sense. The 20% from the buyer is just the buyers premium, so they are only actually charging the consignor the 17%. That is much more reasonable. Most higher end auction houses charge the seller 20% and then have a 10-20% buyers premium, or as the older time dealers like to call it, a buyers penalty."

You need to ask your mother how and where she acquired the piece, also you need photos of the back. The canvas could possibly have provenance -references to the galleries or museums it may have been exhibited in - this will help verify that is indeed original. Take a photo of the signature, which it looks like should be on the back of the canvas if it's not on the front. Once you have enough information on the piece, contact a representative at Artnet Auctions. If it's original, they do take blue-chip art very seriously, and will give you step-by-step instructions on how to list the peice with them. At the very least they have access to pricing for the work, but they won't readily share there estimate with you if don't list the piece with them (that is of course if they want to list it or not). But before any of that, it has to be an original, if it's a print - you're not looking at very much at all."

However, according to the website in the link, ""The vast majority of New Home machines have the serial number on a Slide Plate""; so I'm guessing that you can probably determine what model it is by its serial number :) It talks more about serial numbers on the website, as well (right under the heading: ""Late 19th/20th Century New Home Machines"").

whatsthisworth,3d3bdc,glasgow015,3,Mon Jul 13 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"I have sold art professionally for years and some basic principles can be applied when assessing most antiques. First of all your object is in near perfect condition, which if it was 500 years old would be absolutely amazing if not impossible. Look through the British Museums collection of Aztec masks and see if you see one that is even close to this condition...you won't. Now it is possible although extraordinary unlikely that you have a major museum quality artifact that a buddy got for free but at a certain point you have to put all the evidence next to each other and see if it makes sense. Did your friend get it from an exceedingly wealthy or influential person? Does this look similar to other examples of documented objects? Does this object have a convincing and documented provenance? Would it being real be too good to be true? Once you start to look at everything together you start to get a pretty good picture. What I immediately noticed beyond the condition is the polished sheen to the stone, the uniform cutting/placement and condition of the mosaic, and the exceedingly consistent line weight and depth of the carving. It is kind of a cool object and you should certainly make an appointment with some one to get it checked out but be prepared for it being worth less then the cost of the appraisal."
whatsthisworth,3d2lh4,agoldprospector,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:48:23 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert :(, but here's what I found out! :)  Gutzon Borglum was a famous Danish-American artist and sculptor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutzon_Borglum He carved a few different busts of Abraham Lincoln, including this one at Capitol Hill: http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/busts/abraham-lincoln-bust , and this one located in front of the Lincoln Tomb: http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/art/borgbust.htm . However, the work that he is best known are the presidential heads in Mount Rushmore! :) The project was overseen by his son, Lincoln Borglum.  According to Wikipedia, ""Gutzon Borglum had nearly completed the 60-foot heads of the four presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and T. Roosevelt) when he died on March 6, 1941. Lincoln Borglum had to abandon his father's ambitious plans to carry the work down to include the torsos of the presidents and an entablature due to a lack of funding; he left the monument largely in the state of completion it had reached under his father's direction."" (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Borglum).  The date shown on the bust seems to coincide with the sculpting of Mount Rushmore; and could possibly be the original model for Lincoln's head! :)  Although, here is a different original model of Mount Rushmore: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Gutzon_Borglum%27s_model_of_Mt._Rushmore_memorial.jpg.  I couldn't tell you how much your bust may be worth; but if the bust that you have is a real work of Gutzon Borglum, I have a feeling that people would pay a pretty penny for it (especially if they are interested in presidential history)! :)  Here are a few of Borglum's works that were sold at auction :), although none of them give the prices that they were sold for :( : http://www.invaluable.com/artist/borglum-gutzon-ltiiljtuou and http://www.artnet.com/artists/gutzon-borglum/past-auction-results.

Its products are also sold in Austria under two names: Eduscho and Tchibo. Eduscho was founded in 1924 by Eduard Schopf https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Schopf; and Eduscho is derived from his name.

It is black ink and some light impressions can be felt in places on the back. The signature and caricatures appear correct to what I have seen on the internet.  The ""with love"" salutation fits what Lennon would have written.  Yoko complained that Lennon would frequently give away his doodles and requests which she disapproved (of course!).  This obviously was important to somebody and had been displayed a long time.  I figure Lennon was in Central Park (he did quite frequently) struck up a convo with a photography and doodle this on what was on hand.

I mean you don't start the American Bible Society to trickle out a few bibles. 1859 seems a little old but when you consider this book is minimum 1300 years older than that it kind of puts it in perspective. Because this is quite common it would have to be in good condition to be worth anything. But given the deterioration to the spine, damage to the cover, water damage and what looks like a completely separated front board there's really no value left (it would cost more to repair to collectible condition than multiple copies of this Bible would cost in collectible condition).  The second one isn't rare at all either it's one of a hundred similar bibles published in the late 19th century. But because of the size and the intricacy of design these Bibles are actually extremely popular and assuming everything on the inside is intact and the spine is in decent shape this could net you $80 bare minimum and probably more in the neighborhood of twice that."

I can't tell how old yours is (no model numbers marked anywhere?) but I'll guess it's from the 1950's or 1960's. Unfortunately vintage Olympics are not a highly sought after (see here for a range -- you may even spot your grandfather's model if you dig around a bit on eBay).  It's very likely the line on there is piano wire -- again, still used today for big game hunters in saltwater fishing.  Unfortunately, I'm guessing the reel itself may only be worth $30-50 to a vintage collector. The rod itself - depending on the maker and condition, may actually be worth more than the reel.  It may have more sentimental value as a reminder of your great-grandfather though, who likely pursued shark or similar with that rod at one time.

Misprints only add value if they make an already valuable book rarer for a specific reason. For instance the first UK printing of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is worth a lot of money (~$4k in pristine condition) because it was cancelled early on due to errors in the printing and there are therefore very few copies. But a 127th printing of the Prisoner of Azkaban with errors isn't worth anything because a 127th printing isn't desirable before the errors."

whatsthisworth,3brfwr,callmesnake13,5,Wed Jul 1 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"It gets down to experience really, because the main indicator is usually the quality of workmanship.   While I can't read Arabic, I have seen enough original artistic samples (including some by beginners) to know that the calligraphy on this box is pretty horrendous.    Terrible calligraphy on it's own is not necessarily a bad thing, but paired with this context, it's a red flag to me.   Keep in mind that I said ""red flag"" though.  Always keep an open mind when you're not terribly experienced with an item category.  I think it's a fake, but maybe some expert will eventually roll in here and point out a couple reasons on why it's not a fake.    The general roughness of the piece is another indicator.  Likely an in-person examination would drop some flags too (ie, an examination of the quality of finish or the feel of the material itself).  So, when you're looking for hidden gems, keeping an eye out for general quality workmanship will be 90 percent of your battle.  After that, it gets down to research/knowledge about specific examples and how they sell in your area.  edit: It's also worth noting that older tourist items are a collector's category of their own sometimes.  An old fake can still have value."
whatsthisworth,3brfwr,RareBeautyEtsy,4,Wed Jul 1 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"/junesponykeg sums it up perfectly. If you are frequently around antiques, you start to notice the quality of the workmanship on most pieces. Your piece just has the look of a cheaply made piece that is marketed towards tourists. That being said, if you enjoy the aesthetic appeal of the box, then I would not worry if it is an antique or not. I love some of the 1970's and 1980's tourist pieces from India. Buy whatever floats your boat."

Little did I know the previous owner had just moved from Chicago and the entire underside of the car was falling apart from rust from 15 years of road salt. The body and interior looked great and the engine was strong, so I paid a pretty fair amount. After driving it around a few days to get some buyers interested I took it in for an alignment. The mechanic brought me out when they had it on the rack to show me how badly rusted out the floorpans, wheelwells, suspension, and gas tank was, and I almost cried. To fix it all would have cost me more than the car was worth.  I ended up selling the drivetrain and parting out the interior and doors to break even."

You can price it at whatever you want elsewhere, and maybe some idiot comes along and pays 5x on Amazon what they could buy it for on Ebay, but that's not usually how this kind of stuff works.  Especially on super niche items like this that would only appeal to the most extreme collectors.  They're going to check the price on both sites and buy on the cheaper one.  The price you paid likely already factored in the condition of the box accurately."
whatsthisworth,3bo3q4,capincus,-8,Tue Jun 30 20:04:54 2015 UTC,There are people who make thousands of dollars a month just by switching items between Amazon and eBay. I agree with such a niche item most collectors are going to be smart enough to search around but the first part of your post is still extremely wrong.
whatsthisworth,3bo3q4,junkit33,4,Tue Jun 30 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, if you're willing to put the leg work in to arbitrage a couple bucks here and there I believe you can make some money in spots.  But I find it extremely hard to believe that anyone is making ""thousands of dollars"" a month regularly doing this.  Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.  By the time you add in seller's fees and shipping costs, you really need to be clearing at least 20% on the arbitrage.  Finding a 20% difference between just about any item on the two sites is pretty rare.  Of course you also owe taxes on the delta, though I realize these kinds of people probably are not paying it.  Bottom line - there's no way there's enough of a market to consistently pull off that kind of income.    And that's before we even start to calculate the amount of time people spend doing this kind of nonsense.  Great - you made $200 in net profit (before taxes) but spent 50 hours on it last month.  You would have been much better off working a part-time job or investing that time in your personal development for your career."
whatsthisworth,3bo3q4,capincus,3,Tue Jun 30 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"I've made hundreds of dollars on items just by buying them on eBay and relisting with a better title. That's just polishing an auction on the same site. When you take the different customer bases into account you can make lots of money by finding items with enough disparity between the 2 platforms. For instance new in box stuff sells for 20-30% higher on average on Amazon than eBay, that's enough room to make a bit of money just by switching it between the 2 platforms. Plus if you're ballsy enough to drop-ship the work entails listing it on Amazon and then just buying it off eBay when you get the sale and having them ship directly to your buyer. Even if that's only a $5 profit that's legitimately 5 minutes of work tops. But there are occasionally items with much larger price gaps and if you search /r/flipping I'm sure you can find a few dozen posts of people who only do this type of arbitrage and have actual spreadsheets/sales figures posted.  People are so lazy they'll pay 20% more money for FBA items just so they don't have to wait more than 2 days for their item when they could easily contact an MF seller and get expedited shipping for cheaper or find 2-day shipping on eBay for significanty less. Of course they're too lazy to shop around.  Edit: perfect example: last week I had a book listed at $60 on eBay and $150 on Amazon because the lowest price on Amazon was $225. I had a woman negotiate me down to $75 on the Amazon price (plus $4 shipping) when she could have bought it for $60 with free shipping at any point just by searching eBay."

The design looks like either late Victorian or Edwardian, but is it actually from that era or is it a 60s/70s repro, I don't know.   Looks like it's been painted (diy, not factory) too.  I do lean towards reproduction, for the record.   Something about the seat pan doesn't seem right to me.  In any case, even as a reproduction, 100-150 seems fair enough to me - the chair and stool are absolutely lovely.   If it's a genuine antique, the price is a steal as far as I'm concerned."

The one on top appears to be Irish.   The one on the top right is obviously from Great Britain, although I'm not certain of the denomination.  On the top left you have a nice French piece. Can't tell the denomination without seeing the other side though.  Then the one in the center with the funky edging is Italian. The edging is not original, but added. Looks cool though.  The small coin between the French and Italian coins looks intriguing, but isn't a coin per say. It's actually more of a token, possibly a gaming token. Not worth very much, but I always found them interesting. Have a few myself.   That's it for the easily identifiable coins. I never got much into ancient coin collection, so I can't help with the group on the bottom. All I can say is that they don't really appear to be Roman, but I don't want to hazard a guess beyond that.   Nice collection you've got there.

Without better photos, I can't tell much about it. I can see that there's some darkening in the varnish, which might indicate that the violin came from Mittenwald. You used to be able to order violins like this out of the Sears catalog for a few dollars, and the quality was intensely variable. The model on this violin looks pretty good, but it's really hard to say what the craftsmanship is like from the pictures provided. The better factory instruments usually came from Markneukirchen and would have an actual maker's name associated with them (although sometimes that was just a brand name and not an actual person). Is there any more information on the label, or anywhere else on the violin?  I'd recommend the article ""Mass Markies"" by Edward Ball, if you can find it, for more information. (It was in The Strad in 2003, I think.) Aaand I'd also recommend going to someone who knows a little bit about violins, in person, to see if they can find anything.  Anyway, it looks like it's set up and in decent condition, which is good. Depending on the quality, it could make a good first full-size violin for a middle or high schooler, all the way to a nice outdoor instrument for a professional. But unnamed German violins don't fetch much, so I wouldn't hold out hope for more than $500."

Here is a recent auction for what is probably the non-customized version of this record, going for just over $20. the auction only has 14 views, including me, so it is unlikely there was any bidding war.  it is unclear if your edition would be worth more or less than that one, but that ebay auction might have let the steam off the global market until a senior citizen in Oklahoma suddenly starts obsessively putting together a Bing Crosby discography.  if you have a good ebay seller rating you might get $20 for it but I think that is unlikely.  that being said, sometimes some wierd stuff like this is valuable, like those radio year in review news or sports records that happen to be for a particular year or season, but in this case i doubt it."

My parents had an almost identical one to yours hanging in their dining room for years. Obviously I can't tell you who painted it because your photo of the signature is completely blurry but it's pretty irrelevant because it wasn't painted by anyone of any note. I always find it interesting that these types of paintings are always signed in the most illegible manner possible.  Value is maybe $50 or something but even that is difficult to say because we have no idea of the size of the piece. But as I said, down on Cape Cod there are tourist trap warehouses chock full of this stuff. Sorry. It's good that you like it though."

whatsthisworth,3azdgv,kissmypearl,9,Wed Jun 24 18:47:49 2015 UTC,Well this post is more or less pointless without an image of the actual art work but let's take a shot anyway. Certificates of authenticity are worthless unless from a reputable and respected source which 'Neville Gallery Fine Arts' is not. I am not saying it is fake or Neville Gallery is unreliable but it is so obscure and difficult to research it may as well not exist. I could start churning out certificates of authenticity in my basement it wouldn't mean the piece is definitely original. People often think no way a gallery would be allowed to operate like that it must be tightly regulated but they are wrong there have been tons of galleries that have done that over the years and gotten away with it.  Additionally 1980's Dali pieces are notoriously unreliable and there are 10 fakes for everyone real one. A lot of people I know who buy and sell art wont even touch prints from 1978 and on unless they have amazing provenance. I can likely tell you a little more if you post some detailed images of the piece itself.

Why not just make... 5, and then sell those? In doing research I honestly cannot believe the sheer amount of different models and varieties they have. Surely this just confuses your customers?"
whatsthisworth,3axmgc,Carlton_Honeycomb,2,Wed Jun 24 12:52:24 2015 UTC,"It was confusing yes; there was typically about 6 different size classes for each tier, with anywhere from 6-10 tiers throughout the course of the year. Some models are made specifically for big box stores such as sams and costco, some walmart exclusive models, etc. Many of them are one in the same, but with different model numbers depending on where they're sold and/or maybe a feature or two is different.   I agree though, simplicity is really important as a consumer, and if the shopping process is even complicated with so many models to compare, it's kind of off-putting. That's kind of what I love about Apple. You rarely have more than a couple options at a time; it's refreshing. Anyway, cheers mate. Enjoy the TV; I'm probably biased when it comes to the longevity. Working in support, you typically only hear from customers if something is wrong. I'm sure there are hundreds of thousands of customers out there with TV's that have no problems that I never heard from."

whatsthisworth,39u5av,funchy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:04:55 2015 UTC,"Pianos do not age like fine wine or violins. They're mechanical devices that wear out without constant maintenance, like cars. And like cars, many of them are not worth restoring. It looks good as furniture, so it might be worth a little more if the insides are not good.  It's likely worthless, unless it's newer.

whatsthisworth,39u5av,binomine,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:45:38 2015 UTC,"This thing has almost never been played.    People always assume this is a good thing, but if a piano goes without proper maintenance, then it's plausible that it cannot be re-tuned. The car analogy is ok here. Locking a car in a garage for 60 years doesn't guarentee that it will start when you open it. It would require some work to get it into drivable condition, and if you were foolish to store a non-classic car, then it might not be worth restoring it.   I believe from your picture, this piano is a Spinet. Spinets are the economy model of pianos. They're more expensive to tune and work on, so they're not very valuable used. Nor are they worth restoring. They are designed to last about 30 years and then get thrown out, which yours is twice as old as that.  Gulbransen actually is a good piano brand, and actually a sought after brand for a small group of ragtime players.  If this piano is in tunable condition, which can only be determined by a visit from a piano tech, I would say it'll be worth somewhere from $2000 ~ $1600.  $750 ~ 1000 if you want it to move quickly. You might also try a used piano store if you want it to move quickly, although expect about $250 for it.  They usually are not interested in spinets, but since Gulbransen is a brand name, they might bite.   It could be that I don't have resolution I need, but I don't believe those keys are ivory, because I can't see the ivory marks. Also, 60 year old ivory should have discolored by now, and they look white. Steinway stopped making ivory keys in the 1930's, and really, it would be weird for a economy model piano to be fitted with ivory keys, but if someone wanted it, it's possible.  If it is a bad picture and the keys are made of ivory, then the keys can be sold from anywhere from $100 ~ $500 dollars by themselves. I think they're just plastic keys, which are older than most people realize.   Likewise, the piano itself would function as furniture, anywhere between $250 ~ $750, ivory keys or not. Again, you'll have to wait for someone to purchase it sold like this. If you want it to move quickly, the garbage man moves it pretty quickly.   And of course, even if it isn't tunable, you can swear up and down that it is tunable and sell it on craigslist for $1000 anyways, because it seems that happen with 3rd party piano sales.   EDIT: Just incase I'm wrong. If this turns out to be an upright piano instead of a spinet, then it should be actually a pretty valuable if it's tunable. I would place it closer to $4500. I think it's a spinet, but I'm not entirely sure because I'm unfamiliar with this brand.   EDIT2: Just realized, my figures are assuming those are plastic or wooden keys on there, since that's what it looks like to me. If they really are ivory keys, you might want to add $1k to every figure except the furniture piano figure."

whatsthisworth,39rq2c,mna_mna,3,Sun Jun 14 08:04:28 2015 UTC,"I have sold Wayne Thiebauds' work in a previous job and I am 95% sure that this is legit. It certainly looks like his signature and if someone was going to fake one of his pieces I think they would go with a cupcake or something more closely associated with his work. What this thing is worth and what can you sell this for are 2 very different questions. I think a generous retail gallery asking price for this piece would be like $2,500. The fact that it doesn't look anything like what he usually does makes it unusual but it also makes it less desirable and less valuable. People who buy art at this level want something that is reflective of the artist's work and career something that when people walk into their house they say 'oh wow that's a Wayne Thiebaud they got there', this piece is not that. Additionally what some one will pay at a gallery and what some one will pay from some guy or at an auction is radically different. When you buy at a gallery there is less risk involved. The piece turns out to be fake? The gallery protects it's reputation by refunding your money. There is an underlying condition issue with the piece? Gallery gives you your money back. You fall in love with another artist's work? Gallery gives you credit for this piece to put towards a new piece. You can't offer this level of security and service and to be honest for a piece at this level neither can an auction house (they certainly can when we are getting in the hundreds of thousands and millions but not for a couple grand). Also you don't have a fancy gallery with amazing lighting and trained sales staff with installation service and insurance. I would try and get it authenticated and list it for $2,500 and I would likely take $1,500 if it came along."
whatsthisworth,39rq2c,glasgow015,2,Mon Jun 15 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"It's an etching, the bottom corner says something ""proof"", meaning it is an artist's proof. An artist's proof occurs when an artist makes an editioned print - there will be the numbered prints, and then two ""artist's proofs"" that exist outside the edition for the artist to keep. This could also be a unique work but it'd be odd to include the notation that way if it were. It won't affect the value, unless there were no other prints beyond this one, which is unlikely."

I had a good Coin shop owner that would give me %55 on silver and %65 on gold.   This is not typical, and most buyers offer to buy at %35-40 of current spot price.

Be careful when moving them to not scuff or damage the footings, the condition of the footings are normally used as a guide for how they have been treated and not the condition of the seat as many would think. oil/grease stains, dents and dings, and scratches are bad on the footings. dings and dents, cracking on the chair and the arms are less of a concern as that is considered normal wear and tear.   oh, also, ensure that the arms are snug, loose arms is a bad thing.   Hopefully someone who knows more about the chairs can chime in for you because, as i mentioned, i am no expert."

The leather is in good condition with the exception of the thin, tightly stretched piece that is on the top of each arm. Both arms of both chairs have slight cracking in this area.  3.) I have not polished any of the metal but I have greased all the movable parts.  4.) Everything works including the electric lift on the one. I was a little hesitant to plug it in but with a little fluid added it raised and lowered smoothly.  5.) Everything is clean or able to be cleaned with the possible exception being the chrome plated base on the one, which is rusted.  6.) There are no dates stamped on the bottoms of the seats. I had not considered that they were likely redone.   I have looked for a good while on the internet and cannot find either model. Until now, I hadn't considered that they may have been redone. I am starting to wonder if some of the parts are either not original or were optional.  Thanks for the help and I will update this post if and when I end up selling them."

It also signified the dominance of the Byzantine Emperors over both East and West. In the Holy Roman Empire's heraldry, it represented the church and the state.

whatsthisworth,393467,redemption2021,2,Mon Jun 8 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"1881 is probably a pattern number, not a year. you need to figure out if this is silver or silver plate. if silver (somewhat less likely) weigh it, multiply the weight by around $15/oz, someone will correct me on this, that gives an approximate melt value which is the floor of what it's worth. this is a fairly common company. the box alone typically goes for $15-20. if it's silver plate, i dont know how to price it, but maybe keep it yourself and invite people to dinner parties. http://www.ebay.com/bhp/oneida-ltd-1881-rogers"

If a dealer were selling it at an antique mall, shop or show, they would probably ask for a little more, but since you are not a dealer, I would ask $100. It probably is an ice chest, but if it is, it is missing a metal liner on the inside. There would have been a metal liner on the inside to prevent the melted ice from leaking out through the wood, and the top of the inside lid also would have been lined to prevent condensation from the melted ice ruining the wood. The hole in the bottom does make me think it is an ice chest. Is the lid properly attached? In the pictures it looks like it not sitting flush to the top of the box."

I think the best way to look at having one is to have fun, and get rid of as much stuff as possible. People come to yard sales looking for a bargain. It is fun to get rid of things and give people a smoking deal. I had a friend who had her first yard sale and was going for top dollar and was so upset when no body bought anything. I tend to have quite a lot of items when I do have a sale  and i figure if i can get 25 cents to a couple dollars for something (even if it is worth $50 or more) then I am happy.  If you want to get closer to what your items are worth, then I would try craigslist. Sometimes when i was asked what I wanted for an item, I would say, ""what do you want to give me for it?"" and many times it was more that what I would have asked for. My advice is do not expect to get what you think your items are worth. $1 for a pair of shoes, 25 cents for a book, men's cologne $1 per bottle,  etc.  Good luck!"

whatsthisworth,38g5lj,ketchuphead,3,Thu Jun 4 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"Authentic?  Well, yes in the sense that it is definitely a netsuke.  Perhaps a better question would be is it old, or valuable, or significant.  Let's look at a couple factors :  1) Material Another poster had stated that they were typically made of bone, but this is not the case.  Most older surviving netsuke were made of ivory, or wood.  There were some made of bone, but it was not common at all.  When examining a netsuke to see if it is ivory you want to look for a crosshatching pattern called Schreger lines - it looks like a bunch of little ""v"" shapes.  99% of the time if you see those lines (you might have to hold it at different angles to see it) it is ivory.  Not being able to see them does not always mean that it isn't ivory, but it's a good start.  This particular netsuke, however, does not appear to be animal ivory from the pictures.  Better pictures would be required.  Please look for the Schreger lines.  2) Carving quality Netsuke went through a strange stylistic metamorphosis.  The earliest netsuke were very very plain shapes.  They were very utilitarian, and not decorated.  Eventually, as Japan opened up to the West, they started to get more and more decorative and complex.  Beautiful carvings made by masters we created which are true works of art.  Eventually, after WW2, Japanese carvers started producing netsuke to be sold as trinkets for foreigners, rather than the utilitarian objects they once were.  Carving quality suffered, and new 'features' began popping up which did not exist in antiquities.  This one is not very well carved.  It looks more like scrimshaw than a netsuke.  3) Subject Matter Older netsuke were typically very utilitarian, so simple shapes such as cylinders and torii were used.  As time passed more and more random shit started getting made.  Nowadays you can find ""genuine real authentic antique netsuke"" (read : modern repro) at flea markets and yard sales showing all kinds of random stuff such as dragons and elephants.  A fish is not outside the realm of possibility for a true antique.  4) Time period One of the key ways to date a netsuki is to look at features carved into it.  Modern netsuke are made to appeal to western audiences who like to put little trinkets on shelves.  If you see a netsuke that was made to stand upright chances are it is not terribly old.  Also, since traditional netsuke were utilitarian the carvers saw no need to made the object fully 3D...  They would typically be very plain on the back.  Sometimes just a smooth flat surface.  Why carve the back if the back of the piece was never going to be seen while the piece was being worn?  Yours is carved on both sides, which screams modern...  also the holes are friggin huge, ugly, and obvious.  They are too high on the netsuke, as well.  It's almost as if the carver wanted everyone to think ""Wow! Look!  Holes!  It must be legit!""  This sort of nonsense didn't start until the 70's or so.  There's lots more things I could go into about this piece, but suffice to say that from the pictures provided I do not believe it to be an old netsuke.  It is definitely a ""netsuke"" in the same way a Pontiac Fiero is a ""sports car"" - but not a very good one.  One last thing ...  NEVER EVER EVER EVER use the hot needle test.  Yes, it will prove that a plastic netsuke is plastic, and no it won't hurt an ivory netsuke, but it will murder a wooden one...  and also there are a lot of older netsuke which have been lacquered for protection and if you poke it with a hot pin you will fuck up the lacquer.  You don't want that, do you?  Value of *this example * if we can determine an approximate date, will be between $50 and $300."
whatsthisworth,38g5lj,SamOldman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:17:38 2015 UTC,"Here are what I believe look like the Schreger lines you mentioned. Shitty cell phone pictures so I'm not sure if it's really visible. Definitely looks like the pattern described and completely organic, as opposed to being carved to appear as such which I've read is a common occurrence. It does not stand upright. The shape is odd and makes me think it was made to actually be functional, however your explanation about the height of the holes maybe takes precedence over that? And what about the signature? Any more info you have to share would be much appreciated. Your post has been tremendously helpful!"
whatsthisworth,38g5lj,SamOldman,3,Thu Jun 4 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"Your first pictures made it hard to get a sense of scale, but these recent pictures do shed a lot more light on the piece.  Yes, those are definitely Schreger lines, so this is ivory for sure.  I would estimate that this is from the 50's, based on what I'm seeing.  I'm fairly certain it was made for the tourist trade, but that doesn't diminish it's coolness too much.  To elaborate on the height and size of the holes - it's obvious that they are meant to be noticed, but they do lack some of the gaudiness you'd see on later pieces.  Once you start seeing geometric patterns around the holes, or circles carved around them, you know for sure it's a tourist piece.  I thought the piece was a lot bigger than it really is, so the size of the holes (in yours) actually aren't that unusual.  I'd estimate this to be around $250.00."

whatsthisworth,38g5lj,SamOldman,5,Thu Jun 4 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"It looks authentic because it is signed and the two holes are were the strings would have gone through so that it could be used with a belt on a kimono. It is likely carved from bone and then dyed brown. You could send a picture to the Peabody Essex museum if you are just looking for authentication, they have a large collection of netsuke (pronounced net-ski).

You also seem to be missing the ramrod/cleaning rod or, as in my version, the built-in rod bayonet. I'm led to believe some of them had their barrels filled with lead and were used as parade rifles. Mine has a little door on the rear of the butt that slides to the side to hold some barrel cleaning equipment. You might want to look and see what's inside yours if there is one because sometimes previous owners would put notes in there. Depending on the condition it could be worth anywhere from $500-$1,000.

The book itself has minimal value ($30 max) so the entire value is in the signature and most people that are willing to spend $700+ on a signed book aren't going to go for the third book especially the US version with minimal collectible value of its own. You might be able to get $600 if you're lucky but I'd expect around $5-550.  For the GrandPre signed books if you mean $200 each, I doubt it. Once again the books have pretty much no value on their own and GrandPre's signature isn't particularly desirable. You can find the deluxe editions of the later books signed by her all for around $100 (I see HBP for as low as $66 and CoS and DH for $100 in various places and these haven't sold).

These lenses are marked ""Takumar (Bayonet)"" or ""Takumar-F"" to distinguish them from the older screw-mount Takumar lenses.    Yours has the super multi-coating which means this lens was made before the 1980's.  I believe this page shows the same exact lens you have. The original variant was made in 1965, while yours has the super-multi-coat which means your make was made in 1971. According to the page the average price is around $189. Not bad for something 44 years old. It's worth noting that there may be photographers or collectors who'd be interesting in it.

It traces its origins to a chair made by A.J. Forbes around 1894 for San Francisco's Swedenborgian Church. The term mission furniture was first popularized by Joseph P. McHugh of New York, a furniture manufacturer and retailer who copied these chairs and offered a line of stylistically related furnishings by 1898. The word mission references the Spanish missions throughout colonial California, though the design of most Mission Style furniture owed little to the original furnishings of these missions. The style became increasingly popular following the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901. The style was popularly associated with the American Arts and Crafts movement.

Based on the water damage to the face, I'm going to guess that the movement seized a long time ago after Grandpa forgot to screw in the crown before taking a shower. You can try winding it: turn the crown toward you until it pops out, then gently turn it 1/4 forward, 1/4 backward, 1/4 forward, 1/4 back, etc. about 15-20 times.  If after a few of these turns, the second hand isn't moving, it is, unfortunately, trash.  If it works, you can get ~200-600$ for it I'd guess. If not...it's worth as much as the Seiko.

The release coincided with Star Trek Generations - the first film to really feature this ship (prior to that movie it had only been seen as a model in Picard's meeting room).  New in box they sell for about $40-50 (which is about the same as when they were first released).  However, this one is out of box and quite damaged. The yellow plastic is caused by sun exposure, a common problem in the Playmates Trek toys. It also looks like the port nacelle might be bent. I'd guess ~$5-10 in it's current condition.  At that price, it's probably not even worth the trouble of selling. Give it to a kid who like Star Trek."

It mentions the European Editions of Catesby's book, the demand for prints of the New World's birds, and that in 1750, engravers from Nürnberg were working on an edition.   In 1750, after the success of Johan Seligmann's re-etching of Mark Catesby's birds in 1749, two engravers from Nuremberg, Germany, issued a copy of Volume II of his work, which included the fishes, animals, insects and some plants.  The engravers, Nicholaus Friedrich Eisenbrger and Georg Lichtensteger, issued these plates in Catesby's original folio size of 14 x 20 inches.  This version was such a commercial success that it was reissued in 1777.  This work, which had plates 1 through 100 of his Volume II, also included some plates from his supplement.  These plates are beautifully colored copper plate engravings approximately 250 years old and are quite scarce."

whatsthisworth,37q9uj,stumpblubber,5,Fri May 29 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"A little more, but just a guess: HERE is the googlebook page for the Eisenberger and Lichtensteger book.

It's really hard to assess diamonds with a photo because so much of their pricing is tied to cut, colour and clarity. However, they look to be maybe 0.3 or 0.4 ct's each. Assuming mid-range quality, they probably retail for about $150-300 a piece. However it's really hard to resell diamond, you'd probably have a hard time selling them for more than $20-40 a piece, and again, quality is going to make a big difference.  Re: actual ring, again, I've got to make assumptions, but I'm going to assume you've got about 1/3 of a troy ounce and that it's 14k gold - that would be normal for a ring like this. That means at today's gold prices, you probably have about $230 worth of gold."

whatsthisworth,37dnmz,Anarkilted,-1,Wed Jun 10 22:10:42 2015 UTC,You could go to a website like bluenile and design a ring that matches the one you have.  There would be a ton of variance though since you don't know the color or clarity of the diamond. I wouldn't use the info there for anything important. Just satisfy your curiosity by playing around with the figures to see the upper and lower limits.

The signature could be the printers signature as it is certainly not Kathe Kollwitz. Good find worth getting checked out.

It's completely impossible to tell from these photos.  However, if you post a high quality profile of them (showing the sides) we might be able to at least make a good guess. A diamond in a round cut will tend to have a frosting look on its girdle because they are hard to cut in a circle (alternatively, some have facets). If it's a smooth circle, they are CZ or moissanite or something like that.  The resale value of diamonds is significantly lower than their retail prices. However, a high quality diamond can still be sold to dealers for pretty good prices (maybe 25-50% of retail depending on where you live).

Check ebay sold listings for specific issues   If the games aren't worth much alone try putting it up as a bundle on ebay and selling all together. It's an active market and you shouldn't have any trouble."

The swan closeup was my first indicator - the colored ""gems"" are plastic. You can tell because they are cloudy and completely flat on the back. True Chanel will use true jewels every time, and they typically will be able to be seen through and through (no back), so that the light can shine through them.   The ""pearls"" are also not hand-tied or spaced, and are too white to be real - real pearls are often much more milky.   Hope this helps!"

whatsthisworth,36ftfh,moksinatsi,5,Tue May 19 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"The very first question you could ask yourself in a case like this is whether it is worth it to you to own this collection for yourself at the price of $65? It doesn't even have to be a recognized collection, you just have to like it. Is the collection so attractive to you that you would be willing to invest the time and effort to assemble a similar collection? Is the $65 worth less than the total amount of effort you would have to spend to achieve a similar satisfactory collection? I often look at things and ask myself what it would take to duplicate the item? Then I ask myself would I spend that amount compared to the item available right there and then at that price? Unfortunately, when looked at from this kind of perspective many things are ""inexpensive"" or ""great deals"", but you may not ever make a profit from them or even receive in return what you paid for them in the first place. If you like it, can afford to buy it, can maintain it, and will get pleasure from it, go for it!"
whatsthisworth,36ftfh,FrackingTowerOfPisa,2,Tue May 19 03:41:06 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worth it to me, but I guess the reason I ask here is because, no, I don't really have an extra $65 laying around. Will I regret it if I don't buy it? Yes. Will I be able to eat for the rest of the week if I buy it? That part is questionable...  So, I guess it's going to come down to a decision between long-term emotion and present necessity.  As a side note/final stab at value, I did find a review article that mentions the original price (in 1961) as $3,000 for a set of 2,500 or $1,800 for a set of 1,500. This might be the smaller set, but in any case, would the original price have any bearing on the current price in this case?"

Vintage and antique books are rarely worth what people think they should be worth.  When they do hold a considerable value, it's due to the condition or possibly a famous signature.   This is particularly true for any printed book.   I would value your 2nd book at around $10-$15 based on what I was able to find through eBay."
whatsthisworth,36ewgi,BriMarsh,2,Mon May 18 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything you said is true  I just want to clarify condition only ever lowers the value of a book it's the actual content of the book that makes it valuable, a first edition by a popular author will be more valuable than any random vintage book, an early copy of an important translation/edition of a bible can be valuable but just random old bibles aren't worth much especially like these when they barely even qualify as old."
whatsthisworth,36ewgi,capincus,4,Tue May 19 00:21:41 2015 UTC,"I have an ephemera shop, and have been selling books for years. I also used to collect small books, so I am a bit familiar with the subject.  First, they are cute. I don't see anything more here, without seeing them in person. People love little books, because they are cute.   The condition precludes them being worth a lot overall. Condition, in the small books, is even more important, because it's rare to find them in good condition. They were generally not made as one-of-a-kind, rare tomes that would be handled by a scholar. They were made as novelties, or for children.   See of the signature is from someone famous. That increases the value.  I have sold these to people that have military relatives deployed in Muslim countries. As they are small and easy to conceal, they  can fly under the radar.  Not that I advocate going against military advice. (Disclaimer)   I would say less than USD10.00 each.   However, not sure I saw both. The Catholic one with the angel I have sold for about $15.00."

If it's cute and a kid can play with it, it's worth as much as any 2nd-hand doll; if it's not cute and just stands there, it is, unless handmade or from a really significant manufacturer, worth as much as somebody wants to pay for it and no more; there's no intrinsic worth here."

At any rate, it seems a low pressure gauge, so may not be applicable for steam by US standards. Which low pressure steam gauges here go to 15-psi.

whatsthisworth,35mxe8,A_Filthy_Mind,1 point,Tue May 12 09:58:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry to jump in semi related. Out of curiosity, how did you find appraisers? I have some items, but they seem really niche to find some one that will know them well. Also, how much would you expect to pay to get it appraised?"
whatsthisworth,35mxe8,mwants,2,Tue May 12 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"No problem man! Well basically I browsed several antique dealers websites and often they show several pictures of what they currently have or what they are looking for. If it was a match I'd send them an email with a picture inclosed. I also browsed websites like ebay to find similar items and their price range.  The problem is that they immediately want to call you and try to fish as much information as possible. Usually if you have several items and have intent to sell, they are willing to come to you to do an appraisal. Just communicate clearly that you are talking with several parties and ask him up front if there is a fee involved. I had one such person over already and he was going to make a bid, but I don't have any obligation.   With the people I've currently contacted, the dealers, I've noticed that most try to downplay the worth of the item. Telling me it's hard to sell, or that people often exaggerate.   It's hard to find someone to trust, or that doesn't have an agenda. Right now I am trying to collect as much background information as possible, hoping that maybe it belongs in a certain collection. I have contacted a curator of a clock museum through email, and am just going through sources. Someone's bound to have professional knowledge of it, and then I'll go from there!  This is just the process that I've been taking, I hope it is of any help. I've come to the constatation that exact appraisals are very hard to find, because antique ware is very influenced by supply and demand.   For example we also have dishes of a certain city in porcelain, 'Doorniks porcelain' and some decades ago it would be worth 100 euros a piece, while now it'd be 25 euros, IF you find someone that wants to buy it."

Or seperare them out just to have better information if you take it to an auction house to sell as a collection.

If there are more of the former and less of the latter the average will be significantly lower.

It is often used with a TISH-40 or simply TISH (Terrestrial Interference Survey Horn) and a spectrum analyzer to survey the direction of interfering signals. While doing a ""sweep"" of the area you are pointing your antenna you will see on the spectrum analyzer peak and valley points of a sawtooth graph. Once you have the survey horn locked in place where you are receiving your strongest or highest peak you start twisting the dial on this device to see where the interference goes away or is strongest. Then you know what type of bandpass filter you need to put inline to your receiver. The bandpass filter passes the band or frequency of the interference. Oddly sometimes you can just wrap your LNB or LNA or Feedhorn (the part that receives your signal bounced off of the antenna) with chicken wire to shield if from a lot of unwanted interference.  Additionally, this frequency is for Microwave (point to point), television, radio and a few other things.   This test device is still in use by old school engineers.

Walker, Jr. at Stanford University in the 1990s to test EUV/XUV imaging of the Sun using normal incidence EUV-reflective multilayer optics.  MSSTA contained a large number of individual telescopes (> 10), all trained on the Sun and all sensitive to slightly different wavelengths of ultraviolet light. Like all sounding rockets, MSSTA flew for approximately 14 minutes per mission, about 5 minutes of which were in space—just enough time to test a new technology or yield ""first results"" science. MSSTA is one of the last solar observing instruments to use photographic film rather than a digital camera system such as a CCD. MSSTA used film instead of a CCD in order to achieve the highest possible spatial resolution and to avoid the electronics difficulty presented by the large number of detectors that would have been required for its many telescopes.

We are now thinking this is actually a Warren Platner-like piece that was developed in the late 60's by Laurel Lamp Company to complement the collection from Knoll. This is because we cannot find any evidence supporting the claim that Knoll ever sold this lamp table.  It's still a true mid-century modern piece that's in great condition, so we still would like a ballpark of how much it's worth. We were thinking somewhere in the $300-$600 range. Sound about right?"

You're doubly wrong because the cosmonaut pins would be the most overproduced ones and thus the least valuable.

whatsthisworth,33vsth,her_nibs,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"Milk churn:       A milk churn is a tall, conical or cylindrical container for the transportation of milk.  It is sometimes referred to as a milk can.  Milk was originally distributed in 'pails', a lidded bucket with a handle. Often two pails would be carried on either end of a wooden yoke. Once the railways started carrying milk the pail proved less than ideal as it was top-heavy and tended to spill. Dairy farmers used a tall conical wooden container - a butter churn - to 'churn' the milk to make butter, and this proved to be preferable for the railways to transport. It held a lot more milk (about seventeen gallons) and its conical shape made it less likely to spill or topple over. These wooden churns were intrinsically heavy however and from the 1850s a steel version was introduced and soon became the standard. The name churn was retained for these containers although they were not themselves used for 'churning' butter.  As with British Railway Milk Tank Wagons. the milk churn was a standard size, the older galvanised iron conical type held 17 gallons, whilst the cylindrical type with the mushroom shaped lid introduced in the 1930s held ten gallons. Each churn carried a brass plate near the top to identify the owning company and when full it would have a white paper label (tied to the handle on the lid of the conical type and to the side handle of the cylindrical type), which was used for accounting purposes by the creamery or dairy.

whatsthisworth,33fbl9,Chuckles77459,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"Likely $50-$200 -- check the cuffs carefully for signs of wear on the fabric; those and the front seams are usually the first place to show wear. It's not a popular sort of coat anymore, but the materials and relatively nondescript styling are a plus here. Much depends on how it looks while worn -- if it's a dated-looking cut, which isn't evident from it on a hanger, then you're looking at the low end. If it's truly flawless (also check the lining carefully, and inspect it all for moth nibbles, and be sure the fur isn't about to start crumbling) and a conservative cut that could belong to era, first-rate photographs and a well-timed eBay listing might even bring in a little more than $200."
whatsthisworth,33bc78,IamZepia,3,Tue Apr 21 03:15:12 2015 UTC,"Is that a pencil drawing or ink wash? Hard to tell from the photo. I'm sure you noticed from your searches that he was a Woodstock, NY artist who moved to St. Augustine, Florida in the 1920s and became the St. Augustine Arts Club's first president in 1931. This became known as the 'Lost Colony'. He also apparently served as a commercial artist for the local daily newspaper, The Record. Other searches indicate that it snowed in St. Augustine on Feb. 2, 1951 so perhaps this is a drawing based on that event. It seems his oil paintings fetch between $500-$1400. I'm not sure replacing the frame is going to change anything, but it is a nice drawing. It may actually be an engraving print from a copper plate, but, as I said, It's sort of difficult to say for sure from the quality of this photograph. Regardless, it may actually be worth the time to have this looked at by a professional art appraiser."
whatsthisworth,33bc78,angrydroid,2,Tue Apr 21 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the vast reply. The art itself seems to be a combination of 2 different types of techniques, pencil and brush (the while snow)  I will try to get better pictures but I don't think it's an engraving due to the white ink he used as snow but I could be wrong.   Thanks again, I will try to find a local appraiser to know more about this piece."
whatsthisworth,33bc78,angrydroid,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:06:10 2015 UTC,No problem. I just said it might be a print because one of the sites I was looking at had what they described as prints from copper plate engravings and it was a also of a building and looked very similar with the white wash area.

whatsthisworth,333baz,K1ngN0thing,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:59:25 2015 UTC,Price depends heavily on what cameras they will fit on.   Do they fit on a canon EOS 1D? Well they are probably worth a few hundred. Glass doesn't really age. Some of the features may be outdated but quality glass lenses are still quality glass lenses 10 years later if it hasn't been damaged. Do they only fit canon t2 and older? Well probably worth much less. Unless of coarse you are tapping into the specialty collectible market.   Note: I'm unfamiliar with these lenses and didn't do any research so these figures are all made up. It was just an example.

A friend of mine's father was a translator for the U.S. 3rd Army. I've never sold any but some casual looking around would indicate they are worth $100-200 or more. There's quite a lot of variety so it seems to be a bit of a confusing market and there are a lot of factors like condition, model, serial number, military markings and things like that to consider. I sort of imagine officers were given a bit of leeway in which field glasses they used so this might explain the variety. The person in your other thread on /r/WWII seems to understand that they are ""worth what you can convince someone to pay for it"" but there seem to be a good number of these types of binocs on ebay going for the $200 range. I'd be curious to see what someone better-informed has to say. Now please excuse me while I go kick myself because I think I may have semi-accidentally thrown out one of the cases for these."

Says it's Indonesian and went at auction for $150 about 7 years ago. Bear in mind it appears to be in better shape.  It is a cool bicycle though. I'd be inclined to fix it up a bit and keep it. Probably worth more as a conversation piece.

I did not research, just from memory so maybe give or take a year or two :) I believe Fleer put those out. Ryan had one of the longest careers ever, thus there are tons of his signatures floating around unfortunately making them more sentimental than valuable.  That Don Zimmer Cubs card is him as a manager, which he managed from 88-91. It hurts the value when it's signed to someone FYI.  Whitey Herzog looks to be in a St. Louis uniform and definitely managing thus that was between 80-90. While he just went into the HOF a few years ago, his signatures aren't that valuable.  Card values have dropped off the map so you have to get the card graded and the signatures should be authenticated to get the most value. I'd recommend taking it to a reputable card shop and they can give you an idea on value - most of them are honest believe it or not :) Good luck!"

whatsthisworth,30zzaw,AsianElvis2,3,Wed Apr 1 01:24:56 2015 UTC,"The signature is certainly supposed to be Dalis. He definitely did the pointed D thing that seems to be seen here. I have looked at hundreds of Dali signatures and to be honest this one looks a bit off, on things like prints or exhibition posters (starting in the 70's) you usually see his super quick less elaborate signature, this one has too much articulation. Also by 1986 Dali was near death (he did his last painting in the early 80s) so this would have been incredibly late for him. He was pretty thoroughly taken advantage of at the end of his life and signed thousands of things, including blank poster stock that people later printed on. Could explain the weird signature placement. The gallery is likely a shlocky commercial gallery that deals in insignificant work of big name artists (tons of these places open and close all the time). Late life Dali signatures are notoriously difficult to verify and are of somewhat limited value compared to earlier work. It is worth investigating to see if you can verify the signature."
whatsthisworth,30zzaw,glasgow015,2,Wed Apr 1 15:31:31 2015 UTC,Wow this is by far the best answer I have gotten anywhere. How was Dali taken advantage of? Wouldnt he have known what he was signing? The placement was definitely bothering me. Even if someone was trying to forge the signature why would they put it smack dab in the middle. Your explanation makes way more sense.
whatsthisworth,30zzaw,glasgow015,2,Wed Apr 1 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"When Dali approached the end of his life there were people around him who were willing to exploit him. Dali himself was never super ethical about the reproduction and oversight of his work so it likely wasn't a tough sell when a business partner or family member asked for some pre-signed sheets of paper. We aren't talking about a couple of dozen here and there we are talking somewhere around 20,000 pre-signed sheets that we know about. This was in the early 80's and he had already retired from creating new artwork because of poor health that led to tremors which made it impossible for him to paint, he could however still sign things. So when I see a dated exhibition poster with bizarre signature placement from this time period it makes me suspicious. Of course there are other explanations, maybe he autographed it for someone and it was never part of a commercial run. Or maybe some guy had a Dali poster he tried to fake a signature. I have never seen a Dali signature where the A is so rounded but I am also not certain I have seen one that is this late, and it is reasonable to assume his signature was affected by his poor health. The D looks right. Not seeing it in person it is a bit hard to say. I do think this could be a real Dali signature but I would not be shocked if it were a really good fake either. It is going to be really hard to verify. A lot of people I know won't even touch Dali pieces from this time period because of how low value/ high risk they are. Where did you get it by the way?"
whatsthisworth,30zzaw,glasgow015,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:47:54 2015 UTC,"Wow so Dali was greedy? He probably made so much money. I got it at a thrift shop, The poster is now currently on my kitchen wall thinking how awesome it is that there is even a possibility it could be his signature."

whatsthisworth,30z5ir,glasgow015,3,Wed Apr 1 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"1stdibs is a terrible indicator of an item's actual value. Dealers list things on there for absurd prices expecting to take much less than what they are listing at. I bet that seller would take less than half that price for that piece and that would still be above fair retail price. You could realistically get 300-500 if you were patient and willing to to take good pictures and continually relist it until it sold. It will take a while to find a buyer for this. Mid century stuff is real hot right now but the real collectible and valuable stuff is the good designer work, which this is not.

I would try and sell it locally, if you live near a major metropolitan area then there should be a place around that specializes in mid century modern furniture. Since the demand is quickly exceeding the supply a lot of places that used to just take high end Danish stuff will roll the dice on some of the nicer American stuff now.

On Ebay, you can find Alinari prints with asking prices from $6.99 to $4,500.  I would not ask the internet for the value of this piece. I would get a professional appraisal.

whatsthisworth,304v4g,me__uk,2,Tue Mar 24 14:34:00 2015 UTC,Flip the title page over what is the copyright date? That's the basic way to distinguish a first edition (not foolproof but it eliminates 80% of non firsts and the copyright page has the more relevant info like later printings listed or first edition noted).   Here's one And two This is the first case where I'd actually say your book is more valuable than the asking price. The condition is much better on yours and the fact that there was a 1987 reprint at all means there was at least some market for this and the minimal I could find means it's decently rare. The cover on yours looks more like a library rebind than a professional binding but I can't find any pictures of the original cover to be sure. I've found science books to sell pretty well so if I were posting this on eBay I'd list it buy-it-now at $200 and probably take any best offer over $100.

There were several ways to get them - this is something different.  Back in 1991 you could buy specially marked cases of Coca-Cola, some of which contained a mini-cd.  This package is some sort of marketing piece which I believe was used to convince retailers to offer the special cases of Coke which had the CDs in them.  I can't find any record of this full set (with the box, Discman, and cds) sold or even mentioned anywhere on the internet.  I know Sony has some rabid collectors, and Coca-Cola is one of the most collected brands on the planet.  Surely someone, somewhere, know what it is worth?"

This appears to be made primarily out of cardboard not the most durable of materials. There's no way to know how many of them were produced and like most advertising pieces (especially something so niche and time limited) the majority of them would have been thrown away/destroyed. Maybe a couple of people brought them home or bummed them off their local stores but anyone who cared enough to do that probably already collected Coca-Cola memorabilia on their own. All this amounts to the lack of info online. It's possible (perhaps even likely) that it has never been sold as a collector's item (at least not online) and thus its value is exactly what someone pays for it.  It's incredibly niche and weird, and so unbelievably 90's which is awesome. But it's also a cheap cardboard prop which means it's very unlikely to hold up condition wise forever (not the best quality in a collectible). And while there are a ton of Coca-Cola collectors a lot of them care more about the history of the product making a relatively recent item less valuable."

whatsthisworth,2zpndh,mirthquake,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Here are some questions that will lead to your answer:  What is it made of? (Are there Bakelite adornments? That's desirable these days. Unbroken original glass? The police history buffs will be attracted to that. Is the helmet made of some outdated material that was only used during that one year? Then the design/engineering crowd could be interested. Is there colorful hand-stitching? That may pique the interest of Americana enthusiasts). And what sort of insingnia and lettering is it decorated with? Are they colorful? Written in historically interesting styles? How are they applied?  Other relevent factors include the condition, age, beauty, how stylish it is as determined by contemporary standards, its size (a helmet that fits the most buyers will likely sell for more than one that's an extra small or XXL), whether its plain or decorated, whether that style of helmet is iconic (does it look exactly like helmets you've seen in historical photos or films? If so, set decorators, prop managers, costumers, and people who love shared memories of the past might want to buy it) or obscure (perhaps yous is one of just a few. This might appeal to a different audience--niche collectors who look for unusual items), and its historical significance (Who was it made for? Who made it? If either of these people or organization are of importance, then this adds to the helmet's significance. Does it represent a particular police district? Rank? Job? Squad? An old district that hasn't existed for decades? A municipality that still exists?)  I've dealt in antiques and interesting old things since I was a little kid--Dad's a pro and taught me young. I sell on ebay, manage estate appraisals and liquidations, broker deals, etc. And my advice for you is to not sell this helmet on ebay. Sure, it would be fast and you'd get $50-$100 bucks. But on eBay, items like this get lost in a tide of similar things. They become anynymous, significant more because of their numbers (starting price, shipping cost, ending date, BIN) than for their qualities.   I think that you can get more money for this by selling it directly to a collector who appreciates what they're buying; someone who wants to rotate it their hands before paying for it. Many collectors still operate this way, particularly older people less experienced with the internet and more used to the sociable culture that surrounded antiques pre-ebay. Try craigslist. Try the free weekly shopper's guide. Hang fliers at libraries and cafes. List it at a relatively high price and say that you're willing to negotiate. Getting a direct conversation started is the most important part. And when a collector sees the helmet in person, it becomes the only such helmet in the world. Sure, others like it exist in the theoretical land we call ""on ebay."" But don't underestimate the power of the moment. Many people relate through touch and smell and trust only their own evaluation of an object's integrity. In that moment, the market value of a theoretically fungible antique goes out the window and their personal desire for this one object comes into focus. Those are the customers you want for something like this."

whatsthisworth,2znp2v,Angus99,2,Fri Mar 20 02:57:37 2015 UTC,Reprints have little to no bearing on the value of an original. I'm not saying these are actually valuable because I doubt they are but that has nothing to do with the fact that they've been reprinted.
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,capincus,2,Fri Mar 20 03:37:59 2015 UTC,The value of original materials are absolutely impacted by reprints in the publishing world as any dealer or collector will confirm. Particularly given the volumes for these items.  Scarcity is value.  Original values are directly and specifically impacted by the reprints and the larger the quantity the greater the impact.
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,Angus99,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:36:38 2015 UTC,Whether or not it has ever been reprinted effects the value because it can change whether or not it's available to the public at all. But the original is always going to be more valuable than reprints. A first edition of The Wizard of Oz or an original lithograph are infinitely more valuable than the thousands of reprints.
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,capincus,3,Fri Mar 20 04:41:21 2015 UTC,"Your statement was ""reprints have little to no bearing on the value of an original"" which is patently false.  If the Wizard of Oz had never been reprinted, the originals would be worth infinitely more than their current prices.  If two books are published of equal desirability, and one is only a limited original run, and the other goes through multiple editions and is massively produced, the value is directly impacted.  The number of reprints have direct and specific impact on the value of the original, and denying that is a basic economics fail.  In the case in question, the original strips were printed in quantities of hundreds of thousands.  They were never scarce to begin with.  They began to be reprinted in the year that they were produced, and have continued to be reprinted periodically since.  The market is flooded - to suggest that availability has ""no bearing"" on the value of the original is wrong."
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,Angus99,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:00:30 2015 UTC,"My phrasing in my original post was definitely horrid. The point is reprints obviously don't completely devalue the original piece. Like I said I don't think these are actually valuable because they'd still have the potential to be worth thousands of dollars like the Wizard of Oz is even if they were reprinted similarly thousands of times. The reason they're not valuable is because they're cheap pieces of newsprint with plenty of copies printed from 7 years after the comic debuted, not because they were reprinted later. I'm pretty sure if you found an original of the first strip Charlie Brown appeared in in 1950 you could still sell it for thousands of dollars and the original comic book appearances of Peanuts can be worth hundreds of dollars on their own despite the fact that I can buy every strip ever reprinted for like $30 bucks at my local used bookstore."
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,capincus,2,Fri Mar 20 05:29:23 2015 UTC,"The point is that there is a relationship for any piece of published work between its value and the number of times it has been reprinted.  You could certainly note that the current value of Peanuts strips from the 50s is largely dictated by the fact that they have been massively reproduced in multiple editions since publication.   The example you link to proves the point - those are editions produced in limited numbers - by being packaged with scarcer material.   Your point that originals are move valuable than copies is obvious and has never been argued in the thread, but your refusal to acknowledge (including for the Wizard of Oz) that the value of the originals is directly influenced by the availability of the work in subsequent forms was, and continues to be, wrong."
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,Angus99,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:38:34 2015 UTC,"How does being ""packaged in scarcer material"" change the fact that they're valuable solely for containing original Peanuts strips despite the fact that all of those strips have been reprinted hundreds of times? Scarcity of the original is infinitely more important than how many times an item has been reprinted. That's why this format is valuable while the random newspaper clippings printed in bulk (that and quality of materials) aren't."
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,capincus,2,Fri Mar 20 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"They're not valuable for solely containing original Peanuts strips.  Their value is influenced by the fact that they were produced in a form that has not been subsequently reproduced to anywhere near the degree of the basic strips - it's a variation in packaging, which again, any collector or dealer will confirm is going to influence price.   The example you find, to try and prove your point that reproduction has no influence on original value, proves the contrary."
whatsthisworth,2znp2v,Angus99,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:18:35 2015 UTC,"They're not valuable because of the packaging they're valuable because of one tiny little comic strip inside of them. No one spent $4,000 on a lot with only Peanuts in the title because it happened to be in a Fritzi Ritz book they paid it because it's the first incarnation of these peanut strips. I can buy 40 different reprints of the exact Action Comics #1 that launched Superman for under $10 but if I find an original even though I probably couldn't distinguish between them it's worth a million dollars."

whatsthisworth,2zl3ht,vellamatic,3,Thu Mar 19 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell if its a reproduction or authentic. It looks really old but these things are faked to show age often. Things like this are much better off evaluated in person. There are hundreds of things to look for when determining the age and authenticity of an item. Unfortunately without being able to physically examine it there is no way to authenticate one way or the other.  Looks like a nice piece though, I recommend seeking out an antiques appraiser locally."
whatsthisworth,2zl3ht,NorCal-DNB,3,Thu Mar 19 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"I'll authenticate it.  It looks like a Dutch brass cushion style mirror.   Poorly polished at some point, made in the 1860-80 range.  The nails and wood are legit, that eye screw at the top was added recently.  In it's current condition you're looking at about a grand.  Really, the only thing that needs attention is that polish build up.  Unfortunately once you start flaking it away you run into a ""Whoops, made a clean spot"" situation."
whatsthisworth,2zl3ht,MrMajewski,2,Thu Mar 19 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks. We don't intend on selling as its family heirloom and we love the piece. But we were just curious if its of any value.  I'm surprised you think its brass since the material is quite thin but I'm no expert as you can guess. Two questions if you don't mind:   What do you think is the best way to remove that polish buildup?  Also, the mirror is corroded/stained - would you suggest replacing it?  Update: you are bang on target mate! I just found a very similar mirror with that description: http://www.antiques-atlas.com/antique/brass_cushion_mirror/as136a556 Decorative material is copper (?)"
whatsthisworth,2zl3ht,me__uk,2,Thu Mar 19 21:55:27 2015 UTC,"Not an expert, but I seem to remember reading that you shouldn't really touch the back of an old mirror as it's a good indication of the age, in it's current condition it might be worth more than if it were re silvered."
whatsthisworth,2zl3ht,MrMajewski,2,Thu Mar 19 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Don't touch the mirror part, it's part of the charm. The polish removal is something that will take a looong time to do right.  Without seeing it I'm not entirely sure what the best plan of attack is. Start with the Polish build up on the mirror itself and see if it flakes off easily with a q-tip alone. If that does not work use a little bit of water to soften it up. Once you've achieved a familiarity with how the polish reacts to water then very slowly in small areas start working on the copper / brass part of it. You may end up just having to stop and go to a different plan of attack as in flaking it off may do more harm than good once you start seeing the different color of the metal underneath the polish.  Whatever you decide to do however, make sure that you do not use any sharp objects as you will permanently scratch the surfaces. Hope this helps and good luck!"

whatsthisworth,2zdzq3,OldHomeOwner,2,Wed Mar 18 04:36:01 2015 UTC,"You can find all sorts of sites with varying appraisals. Usually you are looking at a retail price which, for obvious reasons, you aren't going to be actually getting for something you are selling.  I agree, at casual glance, it looks like you might have a fairly old original 1st or 2nd Class 1813 model. The woolen armband is probably genuine as well.  The generalized price I give is probably what a reasonable offer would be coming your way. From a collector, if you can find one. I sort of halved the average price and then rounded it a bit. This gives us the kind of price that is going to actually be said to you. Nobody is going to be getting out a jeweler's loupe and calculator and figuring it out down the last decimal point.  I'm just going to tell you right now, most antique dealers won't even take a look at things with swastikas on them. eBay forbids sale of things like this. You're going to have to find specialty shops and collectors and that is where you're going to take a reduction in price.  Oh and if you can establish a provenance of the items with a signed affidavit with things like who owned it, what it was awarded for, what unit they were in, or a photo with them wearing it, then that makes the item more historical and interesting and will definitely add a little or a lot to the value depending on the story."

That Iron Cross 2 (ek2) was most likely awarded to a soldier doing his job and saving his commrads (it is a military award for valour).  My father n law fought for the Germans in WW2, he recieved a EK2 and a EK1 (differnet times) he lost part of a leg, most of a finger and spent the rest of his life drinking to dull that pain, while trying to save his friends.  He was not a Nazi party member and did not believe in the principles but was drafted and when you are put into combat you fought or died.  He moved to Canada and lived the rest of his life there but he had his medals framed and displayed them proudly because he lost to much of his body, his mind, and to many of his friends not to.  Just because it has a Swastika on it doesn't mean the person who owned it was evil or even believed what what the party did, that would be like saying every American who wears a US pin is 100% behind what its government does."

whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,jeepdave,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:03:34 2015 UTC,Yea I got mixed up with the year. Still a very nice truck. I don't think any of the parts would be be able to be swapped. If they could it would look silly because the body style is very different between the two models.   Heck I might pick it up if I can get a decent price on it and fix both up. Thanks for the advice!
whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,jeepdave,2,Mon Mar 16 01:53:52 2015 UTC,Look for frame rot in the back and cab corners. Floor boards are common and a easy repair but any serious frame is a no go.
whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,ezfrag,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"Also check the door sills and around the vent near where your knee would go, this age truck was pretty bad to rust from the rocker panels inward. If the door sills are rust free, the whole floorboard is probably solid.  Pull the plywood out of the bed and look to see if the original floor is still there at all. You're going to have to replace the bed floor for sure, but you should get an idea how just how bad of a job it's going to be."
whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,Suppafly,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:26:18 2015 UTC,I don't think any of the parts would be be able to be swapped.   You'd be surprised. There are some parts that can swap back and forth over 30 or so years.
whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,electronsays,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:33:34 2015 UTC,Even if they could the rounded body of the 55 would look silly with the straight bed of this one. I think it would be best to keep the projects separate.   It is pretty interesting how the parts swap though. I was shocked when the GMC and the Chevy were pretty much the same truck just branded differently.
whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,cd411,2,Mon Mar 16 16:12:38 2015 UTC,I'd start at less than that. Like 750. At least if it's a roller that needs a bed.  Also that looks more like a 65 than a 55. How much of your other truck are you swapping?  Price can also change a lot depending on location.
whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,Suppafly,3,Sun Mar 15 21:27:39 2015 UTC,The only thing of value off the one I currently own is the engine and the cab. Even the cab is in poor shape but it is salvageable (I was pressured into the project). That defiantly does not look like the same year. I would feel bad ripping the cab off this one just to drop on a cab in worse shape; assuming it would even fit.   Maybe I'll just scrap out the decent parts on my 55 and start a new on this one.   To say I know what I'm doing would be an all out lie :)  Thanks for the input!
whatsthisworth,2z5mf2,gl77,2,Sun Mar 15 21:56:11 2015 UTC,Always ask what they want first then offer them about half while pointing out the problems.....at that point you can usually split the difference.

whatsthisworth,2z5c3a,creek042,8,Sun Mar 15 18:49:32 2015 UTC,I'm not exactly sure about these but I can give you some general pointers.  The ones with travel stickers will have a boost in value. People love the look of a trunk that's seen the world. One of them has a stencil MLB and is a pretty nice looking trunk. That probably means something like Michael Lawrence Butler but explore the possibility of it being Baseball related.   Don't throw anything out until you have someone who knows vintage items have a look. You'd be surprised at the value that some pretty innocuous looking stuff has. The old photographs could fetch some bucks and vintage clothing always gets people's attention. The checks and personal papers maybe not so much but toss them all into a box and let someone who deals in ephemera have a look and see if they throw you an offer.  That's a good stack of goodies you've got there. As a picker I'd love to have  20 vintage trunks of stuff to go through. You should be able to do alright with this lot without too much work.
whatsthisworth,2z5c3a,Quackenstein,3,Sun Mar 15 20:27:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Glad to know at least a couple here have value. Would you say in the absence of any period items inside and stickers they wouldn't be worth much? Some boxes are empty and don't have any tags/stickers. Would those be better off being restored for sale?
whatsthisworth,2z5c3a,Quackenstein,3,Sun Mar 15 21:37:36 2015 UTC,"Don't restore them. They have more value as vintage items. Also, the metal trim and hardware can affect the value. Most of the trunks I saw had some innate value. You won't add any value by cleaning them up and may even ruin them. Whenever I sell vintage items I leave it up to the buyer to clean and restore. You can always take patina away but it takes years to put it back on.  If I were you I'd contact local vintage and antique shops and tell them what you have. If you say you have 25+ vintage steamer trunks, possibly with period contents, they'll come to you. Hell, if you're anywhere near central MA I'd like to take a look myself. Let them know you're taking multiple offers before you decide to sell. That way they'll offer their best deal.  EDIT: I just saw you're in NYC. So close and yet......"
whatsthisworth,2z5c3a,ezfrag,2,Sun Mar 15 22:29:19 2015 UTC,"That Gillette razor box you show in the first pic is worth about $10.

whatsthisworth,2z5c3a,Copyright03,4,Mon Mar 16 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"I am very jealous.. You should be able to get at least $100 per trunk. More for the Cunard sticker one as Cunard is related to the titanic, so be sure to list it with Cunard/white star line."
whatsthisworth,2z5c3a,MrMajewski,2,Sun Mar 15 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"The trunks are each worth at least $100 if they are still functioning as trunks, but probably more depending on where you sell them. If they're already in NYC you should really try to sell them there. The contents all need to be evaluated independently. Each of those buttons could be independently valuable, for example."
whatsthisworth,2z5c3a,MrMajewski,2,Mon Mar 16 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"Nice lot.  Quackenstein sums it up pretty good.  I wouldn't bother with restoration and would attempt to sell these as a lot to so.eone lime Bass Pro Shops or another large chain that decorates their store with period items.  You may also have luck selling them to a decorator who could use a wall of trunks.  To sell them individually and make a good profit depends on your location.  So, where are ya?  I'm very interested in seeing more photos of the contents, regardless of how small the items are.  I'm sure I can help you identify the better items."

The frame, background fabric scream 1960's wall decor to me. The color of the 'stone' is the same color as all the resin or plastic used to make reproduction pieces. Also the signature is cut off.   Lithography stones are large and heavy. https://anitachowdry.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/inking-up-litho.jpg  Copper etchings were done on copper plates and look, well like pieces of copper with an etched image.  The quickest way to find out for sure is to heat up a needle and stick it into the plate. If it goes in then it's plastic.  I've been wrong before though, maybe this will be one of those times."

A 2tb hard drive can be bought for under $100. A 32 gb flash drive can be bought for under $15.   The ram might have some potential but it depends on the speed of it. If it's from the same place as the rest of the gear it wouldn't be worth a whole lot.   The CPU depends on what it is. It doesn't seem that fast and I don't know what brand, how many cores, or in what condition it is.   Fans are worth nothing. A fan can be bought for $5 new. I'm not going to buy a used pc fan, they go bad after a while usually.   A new budget disk writer can be bought for $15. A used one isn't worth much.   I would say your best bet is to either keep it, sell it as a whole, or recycle it. I wouldn't ask more then $25 max for the whole thing.

whatsthisworth,2ywvdo,crankypants15,2,Fri Mar 13 14:31:20 2015 UTC,Just google search by issue number there are ridiculously thorough resources out there for comics. Mostly what you're looking for are important events in characters history and the first appearances of popular heroes/villains.
whatsthisworth,2ywvdo,capincus,2,Fri Mar 13 14:39:23 2015 UTC,"http://comicspriceguide.com/  You're going to want to pay attention to the condition of the comic book itself. Creases, folds, tears, scratches, handwriting and overall wear have an enormous impact on the overall value of a comic. Usually the outer side edge of the books received more wear than any other part. Sometimes people who thought they were clever would try to trim off the worn edges. This is usually easily detectable. Don't even bother trying to do it.  That said, your earlier titles from the mid-50s into the 70s are referred to as 'Silver Age' comics. Comics earlier than those are, of course, 'Golden Age' and after that are known as 'Bronze Age'. I think you'll find that, if in very good condition, your Silver Age titles will be worth quite a lot depending on the titles and the issue numbers involved. Some are quite rare and eagerly sought after. What you want to do is, as quickly as possible, get those into appropriately-sized mylar comic book bags. You may also find it wise to get acid-free backing boards to further support them. Old comics were printed on notoriously poor-quality paper. This pulp paper used sulfur in the manufacturing process. Even small amounts of moisture can have disastrous consequences for them. This manufacturing process mostly stopped in the mid-80s. You'll also want to keep them out of direct sunlight because that can fade the colors.  Source: I was a comic book buyer for a large comic book chain back in the 90s."

The ""Lady and the Unicorn"" tapestries weren't brought to the Cluny museum in Paris until the late 1860's (and note that your tag says ""cluny"" on it). This is a reproduction of ""Taste"" (""Le gout"" as noted on the label). I'm guessing linen just because of the way the printing looks. Note - if this were a tapestry or even embroidery, the back side would be full of colored threads used in the weaving or sewing.   I think 1920's because lots of tourists were bringing back oodles of European reproductions at that time. I've inherited quite a few myself.  ""The lady is taking sweets from a dish held by a maidservant. Her eyes are on a parakeet on her upheld left hand.

It's a much nicer looking copy than the ones selling for $80, it also would be rarer because it would have been the most expesive binding available from the publisher.

It is named after Albert Heijn, Sr., the founder of the first store in Oostzaan.  Albert Heijn is the oldest organization owned and operated by the Dutch supermarket operator Ahold. The founder of the company (Albert Heijn) was born in 1865. In fact, the name ""Ahold"" is short for Albert Heijn Holding. The stores are full service markets (as opposed to discounters) known for their focus on quality stores and products. This focus on superior products is part of the reason that Albert Heijn is regarded as one of the more expensive supermarkets in the Netherlands, Belgium and Curaçao. However, after a recent price war - initiated by Albert Heijn itself and involving nearly all Dutch supermarket chains from late 2003 all the way into 2006 - the prices are now at a more normal level.   At the moment, Albert Heijn's market share is around 30%. The company's logo consists of a stylized ""ah"" beside a white swoosh.

whatsthisworth,2y8abc,Hellocollegejason,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:51:21 2015 UTC,The console is worth between $120-180 on its own. Each Bonks game is worth $40 each. Not sure about the value of the other games. You could probably get at least $200 for everything together as long as it's complete and in working condition.  I remember Bonk's Adventure being one of my favorite side scrollers. I'm sure that this title is bound to stir up some nostalgia in people.
whatsthisworth,2y5wmg,InukChinook,2,Fri Mar 6 19:10:35 2015 UTC,It's worth about 20 or 30 bucks.  They vary wildly in price though. Some of the vintage and marble sets go for a few hundred bucks. Check out these eBay sold listings.

whatsthisworth,2y4bzo,Isidors,2,Fri Mar 6 08:40:03 2015 UTC,Not really particularly valuable. Not a popular series but big enough printings based on Spawn's popularity to not be too rare. Steve Niles is the only particularly desirable signature but it's also very common and a more valuable signature would be on some of his own work not a derivative.

If the larger pearl was perfect, it would be worth around $3.00. The others about one dollar each.

This one has the same dot inlays as yours for $130: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-GRGM21-MYL-Gio-Mikro-Electric-Guitar-/201291713141?pt=Guitar&hash=item2eddebca75  This one looks very close to yours for $50: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Gio-Electric-Black-White-Guitar-with-Case-/251852127628?pt=Guitar&hash=item3aa38e7d8c  This one is also very much like yours for $90: http://www.ebay.com/itm/IBANEZ-GIO-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-BLACK-/380995088364?pt=Guitar&hash=item58b513afec  Here is the wiki page on the GIO: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez_GIO  Yours has 22 frets, so I am going to go ahead and guess that it's the GRX ((From Wikipedia: GRX series. The budget version of the Ibanez RX series (Similar in design to the RG, and with a similarly thin neck, but 22 frets rather than 24.). The neck profile is based on the 22 fret RX-series neck. There are a number of configurations for this model including the use of pick-guards, humbuckers and single coil pickups. Models range from no pick-guard and two humbuckers (H-H) to a super-strat design with pick-guard, two single coils and a humbucker (S-S-H).))  Hope this helps! $50 is a pretty good deal for any guitar that is in working condition in my book, but according to eBay it does seem to be within the price range for a used one, albeit on the very, very low end of the price range. You got a good deal, but you're not going to make a fortune off it if you only bought it to resell, since it is a budget guitar aimed at beginners and you can buy a brand new one from Guitar Center for $130.  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Ibanez-Gio-GRG20Z-Electric-Guitar-109097857-i3024373.gc"
whatsthisworth,2xgqe5,Badger_Silverado,4,Sat Feb 28 15:34:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is a good learner guitar. If I had set it up and was selling it I would charge $85 - $100 as long as it's in good shape. If I was buying I would pay $35-40.  So you got yourself a good deal and a fun guitar to learn on!

In my case, people might be splurging on a worthless item because they and/or the seller were misinformed. Also, the final sale prices on Ebay are usually all over the place. You might see five of something that sold for $15 to $75, with no rhyme or reason. Then, if you're doing something like an estate sale, location comes into play.

If you find the right people interested, the price could go up a good deal. I'm pretty familiar with gaming stuff, but I've never been in the market for an iQue.

I would do an eBay auction starting at $69.99 for 7 days based on the selling price of the US copies and see if someone even bids that.  If it doesn't sell after relisting it once or twice for 7 day auctions at that price, you can safely assume the Japanese copy is not worth $70, let alone $109.

There was not one Long March, but a series of marches, as various Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. The best known is the march from Jiangxi province which began in October 1934. The First Front Army of the Chinese Soviet Republic, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's troops in their stronghold in Jiangxi province. The Communists, under the eventual command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) over 370 days.  The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, then north, to Shaanxi.

A purchase of that magnitude might have been recorded by the firm that made them, so there's one avenue.   I think they are dolphins, maybe?  Do you have any rockhound friends? They usually have a loupe. Or a magnifying glass might help.   Or, take a piece of paper, and a pencil. Put the paper over the engraving, rub the side of the pencil point over the paper. Sometime it makes a negative image.  Or, try breathing on it with hot breath, and looking at it fast. Sometimes that makes the letters stand out.  Don't polish them until you know more."

Rockhounds, does that mean geologists?  If so... nope.  I don't have a magnifying glass, I'll try the pencil and breath thing.  Definitely not going to polish them.

whatsthisworth,2vztlf,FSMike69,10,Sun Feb 15 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"It's an American ""Ike"" Uniform jacket. issued from 1944 through the 50's. If the adjustment tabs on the waist of the jacket are buckles. it's ww2. If they're buttons, it's korean war issue. Yours looks to be Korean war issue. The right pocket will have a Quartermaster Issue tag with a Manufacture Date (but they wash out really easily). The buttons on the collar are branch insignia, yours are signal corps. What's really cool are the pins on the shoulder epaulets. Those are Distinctive Unit Insignias (probably 43rd Signal Company). If this is a ww2 jacket, DI's are rare, especially on an Ike jacket. They stopped being produced in early 1942.  Unfortunately either someone has stripped the awards off of this jacket or the vet never won any meaning they served less than a year and never achieved anything. Rank is Private First Class. Shoulder patch is 43rd infantry. Overall an awesome find, but not a particularly valuable one. It's Not a well known unit, not a decorated soldier. It's probably post-war. Every Vet got one and every one kept theirs nice. Overall I'd say it's in the $20-$50 range depending on moth holes and whether you sell it to some kid who likes army stuff at a yard sale or a Korean War collector at a show. I'd say Ebay is your best bet if you want to sell it but I'd personally hang on to it. Value is going up on militaria. People are treating it as an investment, but that might fall through in 20 or so years when they all try to sell their prizes. God, I just geeked out over a coat...

There are many, many makers marks from Japan, and even the ink color can tell you something. But I will tell you what I think, based on what I know so far.  They are post 1922, as they say ""Made In"" and most likely post WWII, as Japan was occupied for a bit, and items for export to the US had to be marked ""Made In Occupied Japan""  Here are examples: https://www.etsy.com/listing/112090741/vintage-pair-of-victorian-man-in-blue  They usually don't go for much, but Japanese Porcelain is tricky. And there are instances where a fake mark is put on a valuable item to avoid import taxes.   That's why I cannot really tell you anything for sure, because I don't have enough info. They do not strike me as being anything unusual, but I do not have all the information I could have.  But they are nice, mid-century Japanese figurines that she must have liked. As far as value, without any more information, I would price them about $35.00 for the pair in my shop.

Not an expert, but I do know that early Asian pottery was painted so that the decorations had very little depth to them, i.e, they didn't look like a 3-d scene. It was only after Western cultures came in that the decoration gained depth.  That said, with the color of the blue and the color of the glaze, along with what /u/Magnificats said, I think these might be worth an expert look. The impurities in the clay, the style of the foot, the fact that they are only blue, the style of the marks, I just have a feeling. But, as I said, I am NO expert!  If you are thinking about selling them, contact Brunk's, Rago, Lark Mason or Doyle's. They are all auction houses or auctioneers. Lark Mason is a noted Asian Art expert, I have his book on my lap as we speak. I did not see these marks in his book.  All of the people I mentioned can be found with a quick search.

I would say the Jordan stuff is worth the most his cards still sell pretty well. Always go with the price range that if a card books for $15 bucks expect $2 maybe $3 on eBay. It's a pretty steep markdown.. But that's the game these days people want the cards like the Vince carter with jersey pieces or signatures not the base or insert stuff. I think you do have some nostalgia factor though maybe give it a few years and those 90's kids that are just getting into the job market will eat it up trying to snag some childhood memories. Could be wrong but the market is seeing that right now with 80's kids buying up classic systems and games. Thanks for the pics I remember having about half or more of those cards as a kid.

I can't help you with valuation, but having worked with rice paper in the past I wanted to remind you to be extremely careful if you do decide to remove it from the frame for some reason.  Raw rice paper is fragile and very prone to tearing or shearing, especially along its grain.  It handles being very wet well (which is why it's used in Chinese watercolor), but when dry it is barely stronger than tissue paper.  You may need to get the help of a professional if you plan on moving it into another frame.  Because the raw paper itself is so brittle, it is very likely that the painting has been pasted onto another piece of stiffer paper or a backing board (or, God forbid, the mat in front).  If this is the case, do not attempt to lift the painting off this support yourself as it will almost certainly tear.  Your painting is very pretty and very clearly expertly done.

Basically, the probe is placed into a (Newtonian) fluid and it rotates at a constant load. Depending on how thick the fluid is, the rotation will be slowed which will measured by the system. Alternatively, it is possible that the rate of rotation will be kept constant and the change in force required to do so will be measured.   This is my basic knowledge. New ones go for $400 and up it seems. Unfortunately I do not know if there is much value to a vintage version.

Blue Willow Beginnings  The Blue Willow pattern combines design elements influenced by Chinese export porcelain, which was popular in early-18th century England. Although the pattern’s exact origins in England are uncertain, many experts believe the first engraving was the work of either Thomas Turner or Thomas Minton at the Caughley factory around 1780. Many attribute the now-famous “Willow Legend” to Josiah Spode, who created it as a promotional tool to market Chinese-style tableware around 1790.

It looks interesting, but you need to take better photos.   1) Are you sure it's painted and not a print?   2) Why does he think it's worth that much?   3) Why does he think it's that old?   My experience with paintings from that era is that;  colors fade, damage happens, things usually degrade, there tend to be common forms to collectible things, and that reproductions are the scourge and bane of collectors and dealers alike.   That looks as if it could be less than 100 years old.   My other concern is that it doesn't match ANY art style from China from that era.   It actually looks like an uncomfortable family portrait, painted by the Chinese version of Grant Wood.   That's also a HUGE sheet of paper for the era - their pictures were often contained in scrolls.  Sometimes erotic ones. None that I'm aware of were that huge.   It is interesting, but 10K is a LOT of money and I'm just not seeing the value there.

Looks like silver spot price is around $18.12/troy today, so (taking into account that this is sterling and not pure silver) you're looking at around $164 in just the silver.  Now anything with the Tiffany name attached generally commands a premium and the patterning on this one is much nicer than other examples I have seen. I would put this thing in my shop at around $350-450 but it would sit a while until I found a buyer.  That being said, if you were to try to sell it to a dealer or pawn shop I wouldn't expect more than 100-150 out of them.

I don't have a lot of experience with the phono half of this radio but even when you get that half repaired, you'll still have to get the radio/audio output half of the radio working too, which requires a decent bit of learning. I like the looks of these old systems but my advice as well is to buy a modern turntable/amp/speaker setup.  In regards to price, I'd say $40 is a resonable one, although I notice radio/phono combos tend to go for less than plain old radios."

If not, its not real. So with that said, and based on what I know, I feel your bag is not real. I think this because the serial number and the lining in real bags do not match your bag. The serial number is never obvious and the lining does not match. So to answer your question, less than a $100.  I've worked in a high end handbag store, I have multiple designer handbags, and none of my LV have an obvious serial number or light microfiber interior with tiny holes for the liner. I don't know what the leather is called but is very pale and then darkens with age. Coach uses it a lot as well. Hope this is an expansion on U/twoheadedboys post."

The bag does not have a lining, the cloth inside the bag is actually a small zippered center pocket. The rest of the inner bag is bare leather. The outer leather does darken so maybe the leather is genuine even if it isn't a real LV"
whatsthisworth,2sd2mo,twoheadedboy,1 point,Wed Jan 14 16:40:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like I've likely passed on multiple LV bags as I'm never quite sure if they are genuine, but I've passed on countless more obvious fakes.  First examine the weight of the bag.  Most high end purses, especially leather ones, feel heavy for their size.  The hardware, buckles, zippers, etc should also be solid and of the quality you'd expect on an LV bag.  Check the stitching.  It should be perfect, e g uniform spacing, the same number of stitches on parallel seams, etc.  Check the spacing on the letters of any markings.  Words should be clearly defined, not crunched together or mis-alighned.  If the bag passes all of the above tests it's at least not an awful knockoff.  At that point I'd try to find similar designs on their website or for sale on eBay from a reputable seller, confirm the rest of the bag is consistent or take it to a boutique type consignment store and see what they say.  The trouble with LV is that they've changed so many things over the years that it's hard to keep everything straight... Different interior clothes, types of markings.  I visited a high end thrift store that had a LV duffle bag with YKK zipper pulls...."

The fact it was painted by Suzanne Schirra adds nothing to the value, it is a decorative piece not a collectible work of art.

The unfortunate part is that the sword appears to be one of the mass produced swords that were made during the war. This talks about the difference in new and old swords. If it were an old, family heirloom, it could be worth thousands or more. But as I see it, due to the Tsuba (hand guard), saya (scabbard), and the Menuki (ornament on the end of the handle). They appear more modern in design. You can take it to someone that can unwrap the tsuka (handle) (DON'T DO THIS YOURSELF) and take off the Meguki and ito to verify if anything is written on the tang. Honestly though, I'm betting it's worth more to your family as a memory of your Grandfathers service then it would be to sell it.

whatsthisworth,2rzpf0,modernchic1977,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"Hi, based on the style of carving and the heavy feet and base, it is probably late Victorian, early 20th century.  The styles of secretaries changed by the late 20s/30s, and the knobs might have been changed on the piece (or not).  If there is no makers mark anywhere (not on back/underside of drawers?) that also makes me think there is some age to it.  I have one similar from the same time period (but without that kind of carving).  It's the feet and what looks like different types of wood used that make me think it is probably that age.  With more pictures of the drawers, a better guesstimate could be reached.  Nonetheless, these pieces aren't particularly valuable, maybe $200 tops?  Heavy Victorian is out of fashion at the moment.

That style of metal work(shaped sheet metal stone holders and rope work, sometimes in silver or brass) and the turquoise/coral(or carnelian) combo is pretty widespread in the Himalayan region.  The stones are turquoise and some kind of coral/faux coral. They could also both be glass coloured as turquoise and coral.   Could we see the underneath? There should be some kind of hallmark.  If it's in base metal it's not worth too much- except as a lovely art piece. If silver it is worth more. You probably paid a fair amount is brass and glass. You got a very good deal if silver and actual stones.  This is probably made for tourists/export sale. The design is very common, with each artist doing slightly different flourishes. The eye and stone fittings are kind of sloppily done, so this is maybe a newer piece.  The material whether silver or brass, and the stones whether turquoise, reconstituted turquoise or glass, and real coral or faux coral will affect the value.

The shield in the upper right is interesting. It makes me think that this may have been from the mid 1800's.   The clothing and hairstyles on the figures seems to be what rural people might wear around or just before the Civil War. Men wore those poofy-looking shirts because they were not fitted and one size could fit just about any guy, broad or narrow shouldered, and the sleeves would allow for a lot of movement. Here on Long Island, NY we have a re-created 1840's style village (the Old Bethpage Village Restoration) and the re-enactors all dress like this.  The style of the basket in the center also looks very old, indeed.  I'm just a history buff and think that you should show it to someone who deals in historical artifacts or perhaps send an image, with a ruler or yardstick beneath it for scale, to a historical society or museum in your area or in NYC.   It sure was fun looking at and thinking about the carvings and symbolism. I'm sure I'm missing a lot of symbolism because the artist took a lot of trouble to be so detailed, right down to the tiny, thin vines.

The answers to these questions will help determine worth.   To give you an idea of the range of these items, from worst-news to best;    You'll see that cheaper ones are pretty common on eBay If you head over to Live Auctioneers - (professional Auction website) you'll see these two sold for $175.  This one sold on Ruby Lane - and it has a maker's mark and has been dated, is quite old, very finely made, and in amazing shape.  And back to eBay for a giggle - this person is smoking crack.   Ruby Lane is retail, so that's the absolute top end of what you could expect to get for a comparable item.   Look for a maker's mark, see if it's marked sterling, post images if you get any and I'll do my best to help.   ALSO - be aware, some folks buy silver for meltweight.  Right now, Silver is about $16 a lb  (appx €13.00 for .45Kg in non-Freedom units) so if she's sold at Auction you might not get very much money at all.   Once you know what you're willing to sell her for, call antiques places and see if they'll consign her for you.   Much luck"

whatsthisworth,2r2ymh,Benis_Boy,2,Fri Jan 2 07:18:09 2015 UTC,Here is a starting point.
whatsthisworth,2r2ymh,CannibalAnn,3,Fri Jan 2 07:43:05 2015 UTC,"There's a page on the site detailing the history of Smorthwaite ( http://www.brianloomes.com/collecting/smorthwaite/ ). As the site offeres valuations by email, and they have already researched the maker, it would definitely make sense for OP to get in contact with them for a formal evaluation.   The long case clock market is depressed, so it won't be worth a huge amount. The rough ball-park figure would be a couple of thousand £, but I'm not an expert at all. I live with a clock enthusiast. We have 3-4 long case clock of a similar age in the house, as well as a bunch of mantel clocks, bracket clocks, carriage clocks, Viennese regulators etc. It gets a bit noisy on the hour. I'll ask him to take a look at the pictures."
whatsthisworth,2r2ymh,crepitus,1 point,Fri Jan 2 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I had to take notes. He says that you must post your pictures on the NAWCC forum as you will get responses from real experts. Take better pictures of the spandrels - the brass corners around the dial. They aren't very clear and can help to date it.  It's an early long case clock in really good condition. We can see from the web site that it was made in Colchester between 1712 and 1739. Around this time, most London clocks would have 2 hands, but clockmakers in the countryside would continue with 1 hand for a number of years. It's a dial for 1 hand - intead of marks for individual minutes it has a fleur de lys marking the half hour. Some clocks were later modified to have two hands.  The weight is part of the ""endless loop pulley system"" invented by Huygens. This allows it to run for 30 hours, and drives both the hand and the bell. The bell is driven by a ""count wheel strike"" mechanism. These can go wrong and it will strike the incorrect number of times for the hour. (If happens then there's a latch inside to disconnect the chiming mechanism and you can advance the hour without chiming to catch up). Later clocks have a ""rack strike"" mechanism instead.   He loved the movement, it looked old, but in really nice condition. His main concern is that the case does not look old and battered enough - which either means it's a later case, or the clock has had really careful owners. He thought the key looked like a later addition - it's a bit too fancy, but says he may be wrong.   To get it going, wind up the weight first - select a cord and pull downwards, if you get the right cord then the weight will move upwards. Once it is wound up, advance the hour hand clockwise, and pause after each hour to allow it to strike. When it's finished advance the hand around again. When you get to the correct time, start the pendulum swinging."
