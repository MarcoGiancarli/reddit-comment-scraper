needadvice,3e3c3x,bluequail,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:14 2015 UTC,"/u/gamerpuppy is right.  The fact of the matter is that most people are so self absorbed that they probably didn't even notice what you said or did that you felt was embarrassing.  And the few people that do spend time thinking about the little quirks that makes each of us different only do so, because they are so insecure, that they think badly of others, to try to make their own selves feel better.  Even if you do something big that would be considered embarrassing, they won't think badly of you.  If they laugh, it is because someplace in their mind, they connect it to if it had happened to them.  I'll give you an example. One time, during a particularly rainy week, I was going out to feed my horses (we had them boarded at the time), I slipped, and ended up with mud on my backside, from my heels to the top of my head.  While I was feeding the horses, my oldest boy called to let me know my youngest boy was running a fever, and I needed to stop and get motrin on my way home.  I went to the store with my whole backside covered in mud, because I knew I had just fell,l and people would realize it.  Of course, the store staff (which I saw all the time) laughed about it, but it was about it, and not about me.  Say you do something that would be attributable bad choices.  Like getting drunk at an office party, and dancing on a table with a lampshade on your head.  Even something like that would only remain in their span of attention, until someone else makes a bad/stupid choice."

needadvice,3e2mvt,justsofuckingtired,4,Tue Jul 21 14:09:42 2015 UTC,"That's such a fine line of enjoying recreational drugs and depending on them to make your day better. I'll give you a bit of a (kind of) success story.   So two years ago I used to drink every day, after work. It wasn't anything major, it was a tall boy from the gas station, usually. What I didn't recognize immediately was I was slowly becoming dependent on alcohol to alter and change my mood. I never once would have called myself an addict or an alcoholic. Until one night I made a horrible decision to drive after a night of moderate drinking.   I was drunk. I knew I was drunk. But I also thought in my head I would be fine. I rationalized the situation as I was driving. And then the cop lights showed up behind me. I was arrested for a DUI because I refused to take any field tests along with refusing a breathalyzer. I was 21. I lost everything. My job. My car. My independence, and most importantly I lost my freedom.   I found myself yearning to drink a lot after that. But I couldn't, as I was on probation and I had to take drug tests and alcohol tests each month. They were randomized. So I HAD to stop drinking. I ultimately had no choice, I mean I could have risked it after my alcohol tests for the month, but I didn't. I realized that my freedom was way more important to myself than it was to feel a bit buzzed. I'm still struggling with finding a good job like the one I used to have. I still don't have my license yet as I have to save up nearly 2500 dollars to even think about getting it back. I'm doing it, it just takes time.   I had to go to these group therapy sessions where you would talk about your problems with certain substances. Now, it wasn't until I was in these meetings did I understand the weight of addiction and dependency. There were doctors, landscape architects, and many other ""successful"" people that put themselves in shitty positions because they needed to get their mind off of work, or problems at home, or simply to get rid of their headaches and morning shakes.   I learned on my own accord, was never forced into anything I didn't wanna do. I actually enjoyed the meetings. It made me understand I wasn't alone. People out there struggle everyday. And most people were required to be at these meetings because of a bad decision or a group of bad decisions.   Two years removed from the group meetings I can tell you that one of the only things that got me through without smoking a joint or having a beer was because I valued my freedom more than I valued being fucked up.    You have to find your reason. It can be whatever. Freedom, your job, a significant other. Anything that can be the voice in the back of your head that stops you from spiraling downward into substance abuse. You just have to figure out what you love more and why.   Maybe sit down. Make a list of all the things you love. Or things that you want. Hang it on a fridge, put it in your wallet, keep it in your car. Just always have it handy so when you feel those urges creeping in you can sit down, take five minutes, read over the list and understand what you love MORE than drugs.   It's what I did. It still helps me to this day. If you're asking if I drink, it's on occasion. It doesn't interfere with my life nor my list I made and that's okay  You're not alone in this. I'm sorry this was so long, but I know what you're going through. If you ever need anyone to talk to you can feel free to PM me.   Good Luck!"

Sure you'll still feel bad now and then but have less need for the high in general. Also remember that getting high will slowly lower your general state back to bad. How raise your mental state: have a goal, make a plan, get support, be around the right people, work out, eat healthy, sleep regularly and enough, read up on things in your life that you find challenging.

needadvice,3e0yn2,byebyebitchez,5,Tue Jul 21 05:40:07 2015 UTC,"Cats who have spent their lives using a litter box don't just start peeing in a corner for no reason.    The most common reasons are medical (anything from a UTI to cancer), not enough/clean enough litter boxes, and stress from changes in circumstances... new pets in the home, new baby, moving, etc.  But they do NOT just randomly start peeing for the hell of it.    Fixing the cause fixes the problem.  Cleaning the corner, no matter how WELL you clean it, won't.  MAYBE putting another litter box in the corner will help, but it really depends... more than likely, they'll just find a new corner if the issue isn't caused by existing litter box issues.  Another common cause is that their current litter is hurting their paws.  It's common among declawed cats in particular.  If you changed litters recently, it may simply be that the new litter hurts one of the cats paws and s/he is doing their business elsewhere.  A good indication of this is if you're finding uncovered poops in the litter.  The pain overcomes the burying instinct.    That may not be happening in your specific case, since you do have other cats who may be inadvertently covering the poop of the one having the problem... so don't rely on the absence of uncovered poop as an indicator.    One of my cats grooms her paws too much.  Sometimes she'll irritate her paws by tugging on their paw hairs between the pads too much.  She'll refrain from covering her poops when that happens, but my other two end up 'doing the deed' when they go in to bury their own.    If not for the location of her preferred litter box, which makes it easy for me to tell when she's in there pooping, I wouldn't even know she is failing to cover it thanks to the other two.  Well, actually, that's not completely true - when she doesn't cover her poop, you can smell it until another goes in there and takes care of the problem.  So that'd be something else to pay attention to... are you suddenly smelling poop more often or after one particular cat is in there?  That'd be a sign s/he isn't burying it.  My advice:  switch back to the old litter and clean the corner.  See what happens.  If it's still being peed in, take the cats in for a checkup.  Someone's probably got a UTI, and they're likely all going to end up with one if you don't get that solved."

Most days, he throws me tips and tricks and how-tos on some of the horses I ride, and that's great.  I want us to succeed, and come november for our last show, the young ones we have been training will go to their first big show and I want them to do well.  And they can't do well if they don't get ridden by him, and they all learn more if they have longer practices in the morning when it's cooler vs. a 15 minute workout because of heat and humidity causes them to heat too fast."

needadvice,3e25ld,SevenSixtyOne,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"The job is fine, I came from a different aspect of the horse world, intending to learn more about the discipline we train here at this barn.  And I've learned and soaked up so much here, it's wonderful. Though, at this point, I feel like I've plateaued in the learning department.  I love learning though!  Yes, I get paid to work.  Why do I care when/if he shows up? Well, since our wonderful customers have their horses here with us to be trained and worked on, it's usually up to him to do the training.  I am not aspiring to be a trainer, as I do not have the patience and mental thinking for it.  Horses be stubborn, and I'm not strong enough to fight with them.  I care when he shows up because the horses all get ridden and trained, and don't suffer through the heat.  OR, in some cases, he'll be out late, and we'll skip horses just to be done with the day.  :/  I'd much rather get them all done, so those horses don't fall behind in their training schedule. And I can't say no to the longer day, my boss needs my help.  haha, he relies on me a lot to keep his ass in gear and going.  I can try convincing him to get done sooner, and sometimes that works."

needadvice,3e08wu,jayman419,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"Tretammons,  I can certainly understand how you feel. PM/PM Support can be really boring. I have worked in PM field for 6+ years now, and found my day-to-days and corporate grind real boring - particularly with tasks involving professional services like being a project controller.   Recently, I took my step away from PM and became Technical BA and data analyst for an IT financing and PM support group – a detail not too far from PM, but still a different vein of activity. I have had your same thoughts for awhile, but so far I've come to like the current arrangement. Of course, this path may not be what interests you.   But the bottom line is this: our current job (or any job) is just a job that “provides and income for you” to fund your way of life. In my opinion, you shouldn’t quit your job or start a small business rashly because you find it boring – You should be doing things that maximizing the amount of income you get and save that money for the things you want to do and retirement. And, if you find a job that pleases your sensibilities for both a career path and tastes in life, then you are in a sweet position for. (But you have to remember, chiefs often hate to eat the same food they serve.)  Getting rich or sustaining an income outside the corporate structure is hard work. I used to work at a start-up incubator, and most start-ups I worked by failed or stagnated below the 1 million revenue mark. This lifestyle may not be for you.   (There is a method of starting a business and being a supplier for your corporation or your company’s customers… but that’s a different conversation all together. )  Anyways, here some of my observations and thoughts I had before that might address your crux:    Look at Coursera and other free e-learning platforms and find you topic you might be interested in. And then straddle on your interest, and go find a job and more *paid for education in the field.  Get professional certifications and certificates in other subjects PM and accounting, and then find an assignment in your company other than your norm ~ or another industry.  I’m a big fan of General Assembly, and their partner start up incubator 1771. They have a great energy about them, and it’s a great resource to incubate your crazy ideas (and get involved in the startup culture.)  Get into real estate. I had a friend who got their real estate license and sold houses on the side. Eventually, this became his FT job when he couldn't handle the volume of business at his then corporate job.   The list goes on… I can talk about this all day, but I’m at work. You can PM me if you want to discuss other methods to curb the grind."

I might have that backwards.  I'd suggest you go to the ER.  If you don't feel like driving, call for a cab or an ambulance.  If you are dead set against going to the hospital, I'd suggest that you start drinking ipecac syrup, to cause the type of vomiting that will even empty out your pinky toes.  (edit - I don't know if this is safe for humans or not, but when we need to make the dogs vomit, we give them hydrogen peroxide.  But ask a doctor or poison control if you can use that for that purpose).  But at the hospital, they will make you vomit, give you activated charcoal to soak up as much of that as they can, and they keep you on fluids to minimize the damage to the internal organs.  If it is the liver, you'd be fortunate, the liver can usually heal itself.  But your kidneys are a one shot deal, and if you damage them enough, you'll be on dialysis, and I've known people on dialysis that have died.  In fact, I lost my big dog, Beast, this past February to kidney failure.  He was feeling pretty badly by the end there.  Also there is an /r/askdocs, they'll tell you to go to the hospital."

You took between 7 and 15 times the recommended maximum dose, depending on if it was regular or extra-strength.  Ibuprophen overdose can cause sweating, ringing in the ears, confusion, slow breathing, and seizures, which means waiting can make it harder to get help.   It can cause chest pain, muscle weakness, slurred speech, and problems with vision and balance.  It can cause damage to the stomach lining or intestines (especially if it's just one big lump of the stuff) and by the time you feel anything you're already bleeding inside, which can be fatal."

At this point anything I'd say would be speculation and there's just too much guesswork. The bottom line is an ibuprofen overdose can be pretty scary, maybe even fatal.   Realistically? Does that mean you're going to die? I have no idea. I'd love to tell you not to worry, and realistically like 99% of the side effects are survivable if someone's there to watch you closely.  By the time you notice pain in your belly somewhere, get to the ER, get seen, get checked, get into an OR, get cauterized or stitched, I mean... I dunno. Things could go badly in that situation.  And most likely that's all they'd do in the ER. Get the check-in and initial check and whatnot out of the way, maybe give you some fluids, and wait most of the night to see if you say ""my stomach hurts"" or for other symptoms to develop.   They could fix you up right away if something went wrong, or you could idle half the night being ignored. I can't even guess which might happen.  Plus? I've been in the ER where the doctors drop everything and pay attention to you when you walk in. Both as a patient (spontaneous R pneumothorax) and as the SO of one (R kidney stone turned into sepsis).   Trust me, you want to sit there idling away the hours instead. If the doctor has to spend more than a couple of minutes with you, it means you're pretty screwed. :) Just cause they're not in the room with you doesn't mean they're not doing their jobs.

They may be somewhat high-maintenance, but that's actually a good thing because it gives her something to do so she's not sitting around being lonely all the time. Having something that depends on you is really good for you emotionally.  You should also look into hobbies for her.

I graduated college this past December. I'm a 27 y/o female with a husband that is in a year-long rehab and I had to move home to live with my parents. I had huge dreams, and I still do, but the drastic turn of events has put my life in limbo and I have been depressed and directionless for the past 7 months.  I still have a hard time accepting my reality and dealing with my circumstances....I use video games to escape and get my mind off things, but when I turn off the tv, it all comes flooding back.  At first, when I first moved home, I was chomping at the bits to get out of here, because I live in a small town with zero opportunities, especially for jobs that have anything to do with my degree.  I even tried joining the Air Force through getting an officer commission, but the doors just wouldn't seem to open for me there.  Eventually, I swallowed my pride and started applying for local retail jobs...jobs I swore I would never do again. I cried when it finally hit me that I'm gonna have to do something to keep from wasting my life.  I had a job interview yesterday (yes, on a Saturday...weird totally), and even though I am heartbroken to do something I don't want to do, I desperately need the money. So I am happy to accept the job if they offer it to me.  But here's the thing. This is just a stepping stone in my life. Today does not define my future.  You and I are not destined to live a life of poverty, stress, depression, or wasted potential.  As frustrating as it is to be controlled by outside circumstances, this is not permanent. We have to ""endure and survive"" (a reference from my favorite video game, The Last of Us) in order to break free from these chains that are holding us back.  Have you thought of getting a get-by job until you can do something different? Try browsing through indeed.com and start applying for any and every job that you're qualified to do. That's what I did, and I've already went to an interview.  You might despise what you have to do for now, but if we can get through it, more doors will open and more opportunities will start presenting themselves.  I know exactly how you feel about wasted potential...I live that every single day.  But my plan is to work this job (if I get it) and save, save, save. And when I save enough, I'm moving back to Atlanta...where all my friends are and where all the job opportunities are.  This is just a stepping stone.

What I have to say is that from what I heard of friends and family who are in their 30s, what you study in school doesn't dictate what your career will be in. There's so many changing factors (economy, interests, opportunities), so I guess don't be too stressed out if that's what you're worried about...not knowing what to spend the rest of your life on.   The way I'm approaching it is aiming for the major that's the most difficult to get in, in my faculty. I'm just going to aim high, and if along the way I find a major I'm more interested in, my grades will hopefully be good enough for the transition to be smooth.

I'm either so floored by what they've said that I'm just slackjawed and unable to respond, or it seems such a fruitless endeavor trying to defend myself that I just give up and don't bother, all flustered and annoyed. When I find myself doing that, I have to make a conscious effort to say something, anything. Blurt something out, even if it doesn't seem to make sense. Most of the time it's usually enough to give your brain a little kick to get it running again. And once it's working again, you can do damage control on your non sequitor, or explain or elaborate on your kneejerk comment or grunt or whatever.   Also, I try to remind myself that if I just check out of the conversation, I run the risk of looking like I've just given in. Like I've accepted that the other person is totally right. And that's usually the last thing I want. Putting up a fight with a retort, even if it's a tiny one, even if it's just one last belligerent word, while probably not being the healthiest way to resolve anything is certainly a better choice than just throwing in the towel.  And if all else fails, I try to imagine what someone else would say. Someone I admire or respect, how do I imagine they would react to this? What would my grandma say? Or my best friend in high school? And then react appropriately. Or inappropriately, whichever works. Just react.  Do, however, try to avoid letting your anger get the best of you. Anger can be great fuel sometimes, and it can pressurize and crystallize even the strongest grief or sadness deep inside you into the brightest hottest jewel of flaming rage, but don't let that fire burn the house down. Getting pissed off rather than pissed on sometimes keeps you from being able to think clearly about what, exactly, is pissing you off so much. Once you know that -- once you're sure what it is that's upsetting you, and you can see past your feelings -- it's easier to get to a place where you know what you need to get past it."

You can buy a car for under a $1000, but in your position, if it breaks you're fucked. Insurance/registration costs vary radically depending on where you are too. For maximum cheapness a small capacity motorbike or scooter is the way to go. for example:  http://bellingham.craigslist.org/mcy/5111721929.html The things run on the smell of an oily rag and usually have inexpensive insurance. Ride it until you can afford a shitbox for the winter.  Do a stay upright course ( or whatever the local version is ) This part is important, you will (probably) not have the road skills to not die without it.  Ask your mum to front for the cash for the training course. Find out the insurance costs, the gas mileage, how far you will be going so you know what you will be spending on gas.  Do the same for a theoretical cheap car as well. See if she'll loan you the money for the scooter rather than the visa co. The fact that you know what everything will cost will help convince her that you are responsible. Pay her back on time or early. My usual advice is don't buy a motorbike if you are under 25, but they are cheap if really pinched.

I'm uncertain the bus schedule around here may not work to suit his purposes. As a recovering addict...his savings are gone... That was my main reason for feeling the need to help. You're all right about the interview, I'll take him to that on Monday but as for carpooling, it's not reasonable and he would end up stranded every day after work miles away from his home. He's got a neighbor who is willing to sell his truck for $1200, and he should have been saving from his unemployment to buy it. My recommendation to him today is going to be that he tries to work something out with his neighbor (as they have become close friends) where he can use his truck to get back and forth to work and with every paycheck he can just make payments on the truck. When he does get back to work he's going to make pretty good money and it shouldn't take more than a month to be able to fully pay off the truck. He's probably going to try to tell me that since he helped me I should be willing to help him. It was one thing when we were living in the same house and going to the same job, but when it's so far out of the way and I drive a '99 Ford Contour with a considerable amount of mileage on it...I'm going to end up going through 2 oil changes in the time it takes him to get a car of his own and probably get that much closer to running my car into the ground. Not to mention my girlfriend is disgusted by how he's taken advantage of me in the past and if I cave in now it's going to mean an unhappy home life for me. He didn't really ask about the car he was kind of demanding saying things like ""I'll need access to your car..."" which I felt was presumptuous and just goes to show that if I don't start saying no he's going to keep treating me like the ""yes-man"" he can take advantage of."

In turn, you get a damn good paycheck, and they literally take care of any need you could ever actually have (your definition of need is likely to be adjusted.)  I'm a completely different person than I was before. I chose a law enforcement career afterwards (not there yet, just got out, interviewing/working my way into it) but I'm motivated like I never was before.   Really, it came down to just choosing something and going with it. It might change later, and that's ok. That's probably very normal. Just find something, anything, and go start doing something man. In my experience, motivation isn't going to ever come from something external. You decide to be motivated, you decide to have a passion for something, you decide who you are and what you want to do.   The only advice you need is the advice you already know- get off your ass."

I know we all have to grow up some time but I have no dreams, no aspirations, no motivation.   That's because you haven't been exposed to anything.

I do not have a license to practice law in Ontario, or in Canada for that matter, but what usually happens is you find another person to take your place in the lease. This can happen in two ways.   The first way is called an assignment, where the person stepping into your shoes accepts full responsibility for the lease and you are absolved of it. For practical reasons, this doesn't really happen much because landlords like to keep you on the hook.  More likely, you will have to find someone to sub-lease your room. This will require you to write up a contract between that person and yourself, that is very brief and says, ""in return for letting X use the room, X agrees to pay me Y amount per month."" Ok, so now you two are contractually bound, and if X skimps out on the rent, you can hold X accountable for it. Also get X to pay a damage deposit to you, in case X wrecks the place and you don't get your damage deposit back.   Start looking for people to take your place. Good luck!"

I've been a lonely guy for my whole life and I had never had problems with people, so I didn't know how selfish others can be and she was selfish. I think I became aggressive, because I felt like I had to achieve something in my life and I felt like she was selfishly and unnecessarily taking away my control in the relationship, so I thought I had to act to get it back. I remember telling her that I have to leave her and that there's something wrong with me and once I did that I felt great for some time, but then I realized that I was still attached to her and tried to get her back. It ended up being too painful for her to handle, so she found someone else while I was left depressed. I remember that I became depressed before I realized that she and others are selfish. There was this feeling that I couldn't achieve anything more and I had to somehow find a way through it, and I might have made the mistake to think that the only way to achieve anything is to ruthlessly, aggressively, repeatedly push myself through doing things. There was the black emptiness that seems to have caused my depression, it was like I had lost the value of everyone's praise when I realized that people can be so pointlessly selfish and hurtful.  I'm sorry, if it's slightly jumbled up. I've kind of realized that there are some flawed thought patterns that I'm still using, but I have no idea how to fix them, nothing else seems to work."

I did want to be accepted with others, but I didn't want to put in the effort to make friendships. The other part was 2 months, in which we spent some time together in real life.  Before realizing that people can be selfish, I used to fall in love with others easily, I was blind to my own selfishness, I was really emotional and unaware of what caused my emotions. I don't remember her or anyone sharing real emotions with me back then, however. She didn't do that at all, and it felt as if she didn't have any emotions. I still think that she was ""possessed"" by her ego and that alot of people are, and I might still be and not be aware of it at all. Currently, if anyone shared anything deeper with me, I would probably make them feel safe and welcomed around me, but I would also put solid boundaries as to how close they should come to me. I would try to step back and act as a guide to help them. I would know what they feel and think almost perfectly, but I wouldn't become emotional myself.  I think that, right now, talking to people would still use too much of my effort and that it wouldn't work how I'd want it to work because of the state I am in. I do chat with people.

And how could you not feel that way, after such a disheartening experience? You are not alone. A generation of us are suffering right alongside you. I feel you my friend.  You seem to have some positives going on in your life which you reference. It's good to be grateful, it helps keep things in perspective.

I will instead encourage you to continue your search once you have gone through the grieving process. In this economy, to our generation, with all the pressures that are put on us to find stable employment to put us on the right track, it is not an exaggeration to say that losing a job offer can feel like losing a pet or even a child.

I've been fired many times which makes me seem like a world-class idiot.  I can't say I've got the solution for you, but I can give you some ideas.  Many people will tell you to analyze where you went wrong and learn some lesson.  You can spend some time on that, but you will also be bothered by the unfairness of what happened.  I recommend that you carefully limit the amount of time that you spend analyzing and being bothered.  Because the bottom-line is that someone else had the control over you, and you need to regain your sense of control over your life.  So, controlling what you do will help a lot.    When you start feeling really bad, allow yourself 15-20 minutes to think about it, then do something physical that completely requires your focus (and not much money).  Try a new recipe, clean the refrigerator thoroughly, study a language.  Spend some time every day planning something for future fun (even if you don't actually get to do it). Look for a free concert, or plan your ideal vacation.  Read Wikipedia articles that catch your attention.  The point is to make sure your brain understands that you have control over your life.  Finding a new job is actually a sales job in itself.  You are selling yourself to a new boss.  We often remind discouraged salespeople that,""You have to collect a certain number of ""no's"" to get to the ""yes.""  Every ""no"" you get is probably you avoiding a bad job for you.  And, asking questions is the best way to help the ""buyer"" (the new employer) really know what he's looking for in an employee (surprisingly clueless these bosses).  I guarantee that you will eventually get a new job.  Let your brain accept that fact and do not let it tell you that the search is hopeless.  Spend a little time fantasizing.  I like to play whack-a-mole and bash assholes like your ex-boss with a two by four when they pop up in my mind.  This too shall pass.  Good luck."

Obviously not an emotional consolation, but it's something.   Anyway, that sucks and you have my sympathies."

needadvice,3djsp9,her_nibs,3,Thu Jul 16 23:28:43 2015 UTC,"I was interested in visiting Australia / New Zealand a couple years ago. What I discovered is that, basically, other countries don't want you unless you have something of value.   Let's say you're a food service worker. Well, they don't want you because they have enough people there already who can do that so you would be stealing a job from a citizen.  Or let's say you're retired senior citizen. Well, they don't want you because you will definitely be using their universal healthcare yet you didn't spend any of your working years paying taxes to keep it running.  You can either do like the owner of Mega Download did and buy citizenship by making a 10 million dollar financial donation to the government or you can learn how to do one of the jobs that the country has a shortage of workers in and do that specific job when you get there.  http://www.migration.wa.gov.au/services/skilled-migration-wa/occupations-in-demand  No matter where you go, I think I would start with a student visa or a holiday visa just to see if you like the country. It would be dumb, for example, to spend the 2 years training to be a welder, then getting the 3 years experience before they let you come over, and then find out you don't even like the place."

If both of those seem boring, then go to Europe, probably Western Europe.  If I had to guess, you would like Denmark, The Netherlands, or Germany/Austria, but really, you have to get out there and see for yourself before you more anywhere."

Do you want to be around everyone, enveloped in their culture? Or get away from anyone and enjoy the world to yourself?  Ask yourself those questions, figure out your priorities, then do your research. Find out where you want to live, then understand where you can live based on your limited schooling and lack of funds."
needadvice,3djsp9,AnalogDogg,2,Thu Jul 16 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"Have you thought of moving to the mountains or Alaska or in the somewhere in the country? I live in the mountains, in the country we do not have any of the typical fast food stuff here. If you want something you have to plan to go get it. Alaska would be the same. Other countries may be the same. The real change starts inside so you drive that bus. Want to eat well, learn how to make it and live the life you choose. Education can be had online from anywhere. Prefer a classroom setting? There are some of the greatest colleges in the world in more remote settings in the Northeast USA. Research it, you will see they are here. Wish you the best."

There are a ton of different cultures in America, I find it hard to believe you can't find a place here that you'll like.  I mean, the difference between a place like Lexington, KY and San Francisco, CA is so vast culturally its probably more of a culture shock than traveling among much of the EU."

needadvice,3dijzz,hyperproliferative,2,Thu Jul 16 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"If your company is listing for your job, and offering 85k on the low end, I'd e-mail the CEO and send a message along the lines of ""I appreciate the raise, but why are new hires being offered more despite [list some accomplishments]?""  No threats, veiled or otherwise.   Just letting him know you're aware of the discrepancy.  In the meantime, it wouldn't hurt to interview.  That said, working remote is a hell of a perk.     Not having to spend an hour in the car each day staring at brake lights, waking up, showering, taking calls in your underwear.       Don't forget to factor in stuff like that when you're calculating salary...  I always figure my workday is from the moment I wake up to go to work, to the time I get home in the afternoon.   Lunch, Commutes, Showering/etc... are all things you're doing at that time because of the company, it's not ""your"" time."
