skiing,3e0jui,plaxpert,3,Tue Jul 21 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"Although Park City is a fun town to hang in and around, their slopes are overpriced for skiing/riding, incredibly crowded, and the snow is mostly man-made. The few times I've had my skis run over, or met rude people skiing on the mountains in Utah was at Park City. For après ski, though, it's a great town.   You could hang in Park City as a home base, though, and travel to the nearby Cottonwood Canyons to ski at one of their four resorts (Solitude and Brighton up Big Cottonwood, or Snowbird and Alta up Little Cottonwood), or head further north to Ogden Canyon to ski at Snowbasin.   Have a great time!"
skiing,3e0jui,totosmaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:55 2015 UTC,"No way! If you are coming to Utah, then Park City is where you want to be. Short lines, deep powder, and the town is relatively quiet from January to April. Don't waste your time up north near Ogden. Snowbasin is especially awful, so I think your time is better spent elsewhere. PCMR and Canyons are both EPIC properties starting this year, so that is the place to be."
skiing,3e0jui,Redditorialist,3,Tue Jul 21 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yes way. And EPIC will ruin that area because it's going to become even bigger, and most likely even more overpriced.  I learned how to ski at Park City when it had short lines, but that changed when the Sundance Film Festival became big and Park City turned into a massive tourist town. The powder is there, but it isn't all that frequent because its elevation is too low. Deep powder? Alta and Brighton on a more regular basis."
skiing,3e0jui,totosmaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're right. Park City is great, but so are Alta and Brighton. But there are absolutely no other good places to ski in Utah.

Certainly don't look anywhere north of SLC."
skiing,3e0jui,Redditorialist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you agree that in an awesome snowfall year, that Deer Valley is phenomenal to ski? All-skier terrain plus amenities like almost all runs are created on the fall-line and the gradual progression of beginner to intermediate to advanced slopes on the mountain.   Solitude has a sweet little mountain that's easily accessible with just slightly less snowfall than Brighton, and Snowbird has some nice long runs off the top of the mountain with good snow too. And I had a fun time at Snowbasin when I skied there, plus the men's downhill for the Olympics were held at Snowbasin. It's got that hometown feel for a resort.   Even though I live in and ski in Colorado now, I'm a Utah ski snob and feel that so many resorts beyond Park City are worth it to ski."
skiing,3e0jui,totosmaster,2,Tue Jul 21 22:41:25 2015 UTC,"NO!!! (ahem) Excuse me. I meant to say, No. Snowbasin is not a good place for a tourist coming out west.

skiing,3e0jui,Redditorialist,2,Tue Jul 21 23:04:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I haven't had so much fun debating with someone in a while.   OP: As a Utah native for over 40 years, current Colorado resident, and a ski instructor at both Brighton and Alta, here is my list of resorts to ski/ride in Utah:    Alta - skiers-only - best snow anywhere, great side-country terrain, easily accessible from parking lots, fair price Deer Valley - skiers-only - when it's a good snowfall year, splurge for this place because it's worth it Snowbird or Brighton - for skiers/riders - Brighton's mountain is more easily accessible from the parking lots than Snowbird, and not as gigantic - snow at Brighton rivals that of Alta (during storms, they trade off as the resort that get the most snow) Solitude - for skiers/riders - nice little mountain with good snow The Canyons - for skiers/riders - it's gigantic with fun terrain, but it's got to be a good snowfall year, or else it's not worth it to ski on man-made snow, plus, it has to be cold enough to make that snow and sometimes, it's just too warm - clue: if the prices at a mountain chalet are too good to believe, that's because there's no snow on the mountain Snowbasin - for skiers/riders - if you want to travel a bit north, have time, and it's been a good snowfall year, you'll get a good idea about hometown Utah skiing at a lower cost, plus be able to say you skied where the Olympic men raced during the 2002 Olympics   Your turn..."

skiing,3dx1v7,ltyboy,17,Mon Jul 20 06:22:58 2015 UTC,"I went to Niseko and Hakuba last year and they were both amazing.   Niseko is more of a ""ski town"" and it was my favourite. Great accommodation nice and close to the lifts, a few good bars and shops etc. The mountain was amazing, pretty big too and the snow was insane.   Hakuba was a bit more chilled out and a little less touristy. We stayed in a traditional Japanese style hotel and loved it. Hakuba Hifumi it was called and I can really recommend the owner. He was incredibly friendly and helpful.   Regardless of where you go you'll have fun I think. The Japanese were very helpful to us and extremely welcoming everywhere we went."

Niseko the mtn, wasn't the steepest, the snow was great, and the trees are far apart.  when i returned i recommended it for your blueblack/black skiers, because it can make you feel really good about your abilities.  really just get to let loose and ski and not 'worry' as much about the next turn in the wide open trees/runs.  I think you'll have a great time!! i did!!"

skiing,3dx1v7,shreddingpow,5,Mon Jul 20 15:12:05 2015 UTC,"I've been to Niseko quite a few times, Hakuba a couple of times and Furano once.     I would say it depends on what you are really looking for.      Niseko is the most western of the resorts. The Australians in Niseko outnumber the Japanese 5 to 1. That being said, its a really big resort with great on and off piste runs (including backcountry) and it has a huge number of restaurants and bars. Grand Hirafu is the best part of Niseko to stay.     Hakuba has a range of ski towns. Happo-one is the most westernised and busy, Tsugaike Kogen is a much quieter resort, the lift lines are mostly non-existent. Its quite japanese, everything needs cash and there is no ATM in the town. You'll have to be prepared for that. It's the best town i've stayed in at Hakuba.      For both Niseko and Hakuba you can get lift passes that cover all the resorts which gives you a lot of choice.    Furano is what I would recommend if you really want the Japanese experience. It is generally colder that the other resorts but has better snow most of the time. When I was there in peak season there were't any lines for lifts during the week and occasional lines on the weekend when the locals come skiing. Even then it was much quicker than either of the other resorts. Not many people speak english at all but I don't speak Japanese and I got along just fine. Great restaurants too, but expect to take off your shoes at most of them.     If you have any other questions send me a message and I'll do my best to answer.     Edit: If I was going back I'd go to Furano without a second thought."
skiing,3dx1v7,MyAbility,3,Mon Jul 20 10:07:28 2015 UTC,"Furano, interesting. That one doesn't come up in these threads much. Can you elaborate on the terrain/conditions a bit more? Also have you been to Rusutsu? I'm planning my first Japanese ski trip as well, and right now we're just getting the broad strokes together. Will probably be 2-3 weeks so we'll have time to go to multiple spots."
skiing,3dx1v7,DoktorStrangelove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:44:36 2015 UTC,I went to Furano and Niseko in 2011? (maybe 12) for 4 weeks with 2 at each. I hadn't been to Furano before and was hedging my bets. It certainly isn't the biggest ski field but I was there with great snow (Fresh powder dumps almost every day and night) and even when Niseko's snow was degrading a little in the afternoon I still had fresh tracks in powder. There were so few people there. I never had any problems in finding some good tracks through trees or even on the ungroomed runs. In Niseko you have a 2-3 hour window after fresh powder overnight to get some runs in before every square inch is covered in tracks. No waits at the lifts either. There isn't much backcountry stuff if thats what you're into. Something about its positioning made it much colder than Niseko too.
skiing,3dx1v7,MyAbility,2,Mon Jul 20 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. I'm sorta into BC, but I'm kinda 50/50 whether I want to build any into this trip. The guys I'm going with are fairly into it, so we might try to find a lodge for part of the trip that offers guided backcountry days.   Rusutsu sounds like it might be the best balance, at least from what I've heard. Larger in size with high snowfall averages, but also not as crowded as Niseko. I'll look into Furano more, though.   Let's say I'm able to go for 2-3 weeks starting in mid-January...can I generally expect consistent snowfall? I've seen nothing but craziness from Japan reports during that time, but I just wanna know if the reality is a bit different. I guess I'm worried about managing my expectations so I don't get disappointed somehow."
skiing,3dx1v7,DoktorStrangelove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:15 2015 UTC,"I've never had a bad year in Japan, I've had years that weren't as good as others, but never even close to a bad year. Compare that to North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand where I've had a few bad years. I don't think I've ever been in Hokkaido skiing in Jan/Feb for more than 4 or 5 days in a row without fresh powder, even if it is just a few cm. I've also had trips to Niseko where I never saw further than 10m in front of me for a week. I'm not trying to oversell it, it really is special."
skiing,3dx1v7,MyAbility,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"I went to Rusutsu on a day trip from Niseko and loved it. Like others have remarked, it's quiet like most Japanese resorts.  Also do also look at Moiwa - a little resort further down the road from Niseko. Stayed there a few days prior to moving on to Niseko and it's a lovely resort with a few runs (although I hear backcountry skiing is fab there). Not as commercialised as Niseko. Plus has an proper outdoor onsen!  EDIT: While I was in Niseko, I also heard good things about Kiroro (""Oh man, I love Kiroro!"") - there are day trips there from Niseko as well. But these day trips only goes a few times a week so unfortunately didn't get to go."
skiing,3dx1v7,Mrdini,2,Mon Jul 20 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"Ive been to a bunch of different resorts and there are pros and cons to each.  It really depends on where you're traveling from, how long you're staying, and what you're looking for out of your trip.    As already mentioned here Niseko is great.  Its one of the only mountains in Japan that has the ""ski town"" feel.  A lot of the town has been bought and developed by Australians and other foreigners, so it has more of a western vibe (après ski, bars, restaurants, western style hotels/lodges).  However, its also an additional flight from Tokyo (unless you're coming from somewhere you can fly directly into Sapporo), and almost an entire travel day on each side.  It can also be quite pricey.   Many of the resorts I've been to on the main island (1.5-3 hr bullet trains from Tokyo) are more Japanese style.  There are less bars, and they close fairly early.  Many times the only ""restaurants"" available are cafeteria style in the hotel.  The hotels may have tatami mats rather than western style beds.  These can be awesome fun, especially if you have a group of people, but its a different experience than you may be used to.    That said, for the most part all the snow in Japan is awesome.  Ive been going to various mountains, usually multiple times a year, for the last 8 years.  Ive only had a few bad experiences, and those were mostly very early (early Dec) or very late (April) season trips.  Some of my favorite resorts Niseko Nozawa Onsen Naeba Shiga Kogen Myoko Kogen  Last point, make sure you hit the onsen after a day on the slopes.  Traditional Japanese baths fed directly by hot springs, they really take the sting off a heavy day on the slopes."

skiing,3dpwm2,Remy1985,14,Sun Jul 19 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of terrible advice in this thread. A few pointers:  Don't lean back and tip you skis up. You need to remain balanced and almost leaning forward. The biggest thing is keeping your feet together and your weight distributed more evenly between your feet, unlike when you're carving the groomers.   Powder skis are effective not because they are fatter under foot, but because they are generally longer and have a rocker shape instead of a camber under foot. Imagine a two by four board spread across two cinder blocks. Now stand in the middle of it; it's going to bow downwards under your weight. That's what you want your skis to do when skiing powder. If you lean back too far, you're just going to be off balance. You need to keep your weight centered and let the skis do the work. The wider width ski certainly helps, but it's not the most crucial part.   I was an East coast groomer ripper my whole life, and when I moved to Tahoe I couldn't handle powder at all. The best piece of advice I was given was keep your feet together and weight evenly distributed, and try to think of your skis doing dolphin dives at the apex of your turns and then resurfacing at the exit point of your turns where you're changing edges to the other side. This let's you focus on flexing and extending your legs at the right time and staying over your skis. Your pole plant will help you maintain this rhythm as well. Hope this helps!"
skiing,3dpwm2,Juan_Deer,4,Sat Jul 18 16:44:58 2015 UTC,"Right on.  Powder skis won't help with bad technique.  Keep even weight all around.  ""Un-weighting"" the uphill ski on hard pack can help with turning but kills you in powder."
skiing,3dpwm2,paradigm99,2,Sat Jul 18 18:07:58 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'd add to this (already solid) advice is to incorporate more of a bounce in your turns so you rebound out of them. Similar to what you're talking about with ""dolphin dives,"" rebounding out of your turns keeps you floating. This is why people say it's easier when it's steeper because those steeper trails naturally force you to make more turns; bouncing and rebounding through your turns is easier when you're making a lot of turns. They don't need to be sharp turns. You can often just be bouncing back and forth, but still headed in a straight line down the hill.   Another thing to add: if you're feeling it burn in your quads, you're sitting too far back. I had an old ski bum tell me once, ""You must ski how you fuck, not how you shit."""

skiing,3dpwm2,jmt970,3,Sat Jul 18 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"If ski racing is fucking, skiing powder is making love; everything takes finesse instead of power, balance instead of force. It's a skill you acquire - how long did it take you to learn to enjoy skiing moguls, groomers, and race courses? Put more time into powder and you'll get comfortable. It's a joy to ski in deep, dry powder, no matter what your boot is clipped into. I'd even advise you learn what's comfortable and what doesn't work in pow on your race skis, and later buy something wide to see how the tool improves the experience. But stick with it; try stuff. Also, go in search of powder days to really get you to fall in love. Start with a favorite groomer with a 6"" layer on top, see how the turns are less razor edge and more silky. Deep powder is like that, but with nothing firm underneath."
skiing,3dpwm2,jmt970,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:45:57 2015 UTC,I always enjoyed race courses and when I started skiing moguls like a slalom it took no time at all to learn.  What skis should I bring?  I have fischer SL 165cm and Nordica Doberman GS 181cm.
skiing,3dpwm2,munkisquisher,7,Sat Jul 18 18:52:32 2015 UTC,That you mentioned quick edge transitions probably explains why you're not having fun skiing pow. Powder skiing is a completely different beast than on-piste skiing and that is reflected in the shape of the various skis (look at a pair of GS or SL boards compared to powder skis).   When you're in powder you don't want to be skiing the edge of your downhill ski but rather the bottoms of your skis. Keep your legs under you and more equal weight on both feet when you're turning.

I took a very expensive lesson and it was $350 well spent.  He got me to stop thinking about edges and consider the powder as a 3d volume and your whole bases as the control surface. Slow down your turns, keep your weight over the middle more than you do on piste, slow down your turns, press out through the turn rather than trying to turn the ski. Bringing your ski around underneath you will just send you head over heels.  Take a private guide in conditions you're uncomfortable in, it's worth it."

You can stay in Banff (there's shuttle buses), but now your ski day schedule is governed by the ""last bus to town"".  Whistler-Blackcomb is good - lots of different trail variety, two mountains in one resort and the town is right there at the foot of it; most hotels are walking distance from the base or if not the bus service around the village is pretty good. And the night life is pretty good. Can't speak to art, and as a ""place"" its pretty new (really only got developed in the late 80s/early 90s), but for restaurants and nightlife its all right there.  Last big trip with the gang before getting married+kids was there... a solid week of night-time debauchery and go-hard skiing. Whistler is just a compact, everything-in-one-place convenient package."

Or hill is a 5 minute drive from town, so it isn't necessary to have a ski-in ski-out condo.

Also in Park City the only full ""ski in, ski out"" experience in a town is at PCMR proper, which has some serious limitations in terms of terrain and snowpack. TBH for people staying as long as OP, wanting to hit multiple resorts, you might as well drive up one of the cottonwood canyons for the full experience, or stay on-resort in Alta/Snowbird/Solitude/Brighton.   A really good way to do it is an airbnb rental in Holladay, Cottonwood Heights or Sandy.

skiing,3dmeko,troglodyte,2,Fri Jul 17 15:29:30 2015 UTC,"Go longer on rockered skis. They tend to come around more easily thanks to less effective length on firmer snow, so you'll be able to bring them around.  I'm the same height but heavier; I ski up to 185s. I'm an expert skier and I'm reasonably strong, but my style is very much about finesse and I can bring around 185s no sweat. I mention this to give you a frame of reference: I'm probably a similar style, and I use a similar ski. You'll feel like rockered 163s are very stubby, I think, and the 170s will give you more float and stability while improving your skiing."
skiing,3dmeko,laukkanen,2,Fri Jul 17 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"For a true advanced skier pick 170cm all the way;  the Shreditor has rockered tips,  the 170 will ski like a much shorter ski.  I'm 5'6'' and ski a 180cm ski that is 126 under foot when the snow really starts piling up."

skiing,3dmeko,tsk94,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider that hasn't been mentioned, is K2s sizing. K2 is one of the few companies that measure their skis true to size. Meaning the skis stand height will be exactly 163 or 170cm tall. If you were to compare this, to say, Rossi, their 163 would have a actual stand height of ~159-161cm. So keep in mind that K2s in a 163 would be like many companies ~165-168ish and the 170 ~173-175ish.  With that in mind, I think it depends on a few factors. Are you skiing a lot of tight trees, moguls and/or making lots of short fall line slalom turns, and/or doing lots of rails/boxes in the park? If so then I'd say go with the 163. Again they are a long 163, and for that type of skiing would probably be better for 90% of the time. If however, you do/intent on skiing more open terrain, deeper snow and in general a larger (GS) turn shape, and less focus on more difficult rail/box tricks, then the 170 is probably the way to go.  The other main factory is if you are still growing or not, if you are going to grow a few more inches then definetly get the 170s. If you've stopped growing and want a size to stick with then I think it depends on the type of skiing you're doing."

skiing,3dmrho,erickssm,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that makes total sense. The only other factor is that I typically fly to pow pow (thanks east coast...) so I can't travel with a full touring set-up and inbounds set up.  I figure AT bindings might be a good compromise."

If not you'll need those too, and a pack to carry them on the decent.   I only use my skins for tours and bootpack anything I can access from the resort. I think the STH2 will do you just fine based on your situation.  That being said; if you decide to go AT go with the adrenaline. They're lighter than dukes and guardians. And have better retention with less play."
skiing,3dmveq,fonixmunkee,3,Fri Jul 17 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"Dynafits tour way, way better.  They also suck inbounds.    If you're looking to tour, a lightweight setup is fantastic.  If you're looking to ski aggressively inbounds, weight is your friend (particularly in the ski).  It's way harder to go fast in cut up manky crap (i.e. 90% of inbounds skiing) on a lighweight setup.  There's a reason most ""charger"" skis have lots of metal in them and weigh a lot.    If you're trying to put together a single ski/binding/boot setup that's really good everywhere, you're going to be disappointed.  My advice: save some money and get two setups.  If that's not an option, then decide where your priorities are, get a setup that does really well in that situation, and learn to deal with it the rest of the time."

Marker Tours are slightly lighter than the dukes, and definitely feel like an alpine binding.  I'm 5'10, 170. I ski dynafit ft12's on a LOT of different skis, including about 50% of my inbounds skiing. I've hit 5-10 foot drops at speed and not had a problem. I've only felt like locking out the bindings on no-fall terrain in the backcountry, but that's more so the ski doesn't go sliding than to avoid pre-release. If you think you 'need' plate bindings to ski in-bounds in the midwest, you're probably mistaken. Unless you ski park, I guess.  On the flip side of things, it shouldn't be too bad to lug Dukes/Trackers/Guardians up hills in the midwest.

skiing,3dijpv,skiattle,2,Thu Jul 16 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, the blob has to go away.  If it doesn't, combined with a strong El Nino?  Let's just say don't put the bike away for the winter."
skiing,3dijpv,jaobrien6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:56:48 2015 UTC,The blob + super strong El Nino is a very scary thought.  Hard to imagine a worse winter than last year but it seems that it could at least be a possibility.
skiing,3dijpv,Proph3T08,5,Tue Jul 21 08:22:17 2015 UTC,"Differently fucked. This year was normal precipitation with significantly higher temps (8-10F above average). The problem here is that we'd get snow, then we'd immediately get 2""+ rain and bye bye snow. El Niño is associated with below normal precipitation and slightly elevated temps (1-2F). My prediction is we build a crappy base but we keep it better and longer."
skiing,3dijpv,lazyanachronist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:25:05 2015 UTC,the big warm blob that gave us the +10F temperatures last season is still there. so we're going to be hot dry fucked.

skiing,3dijpv,skiattle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:55 2015 UTC,Well considering last year was the worst year on record I probably wouldn't place bets on it being worse. But El Nino generally produces warmer and drier winters for us. On top of we still have a massive blob of warm water of our coast which needs to go away. OpenSnow's California blogger put out a blog yesterday discussing why he is skeptical for California still and we will be in a worse position than them if El Nino continues to strengthen.

skiing,3dijpv,HarryTruman,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"That's not what that says. You seem to be conflating air temps with ocean surface temps. Asside from the hand wavy ""warmer"" at the bottom, that doesn't say anything about air temps. The increase air temps from el niño are modest, 1-2F. The ridge created an 8-10F warmer winter. If that ridge sticks around, we're very fucked. If it goes away, we're in for a better winter than last.  The problem this year wasn't a lack of snow, we had tons of snow. It was all immediately followed by rain. That's less likely to happen in en niño years. Mostly because the precipitation just won't be there."
skiing,3dijpv,lazyanachronist,2,Thu Jul 16 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"We did not have tons of snow last year.  Stevens Pass had less than half their usual snowfall.  We had tons of precipitation last year, because you're right about the rain.  If we hadn't been so much warmer than average last year, it might have been an OK year."
skiing,3dijpv,jaobrien6,0,Thu Jul 16 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"There was a pattern of 2-4"" of thick snow followed by enough rain to wash it away. The snow tended to build on west aspects, and the snow gauges are in neutral locations, so they didn't tend to record it. It also tended to be well above the gauges. I skied this pattern 10+ times. Since it was normally on days that forecast rain, the resort was usually empty."
skiing,3dijpv,lazyanachronist,2,Thu Jul 16 23:06:30 2015 UTC,I don't think you can cherry pick what you observed on certain aspects and elevations (west facing and high elevations) and try to make a generalized statement about the season as a whole.  There are always going to be aspects and elevations in any weather pattern that will record more and less snow than other aspects/elevations.  The measurement at the gauges are still representative of how last year compared to an average year's measurement at those same gauges in the same locations: substantially less.
skiing,3dijpv,jaobrien6,0,Thu Jul 16 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not cherry picking, it seems you just want to argue. Read what I wrote and attempt to understand it, it's not very complicated. There was a very obvious, regular pattern. I'm sorry you didn't see it on the internets snow report.  Actually, you're right. There won't be any snow ever again, don't bother even trying this winter."
skiing,3dijpv,lazyanachronist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:29:09 2015 UTC,"I read what you said, I understood it, I simply don't agree with your assessment of it.  I'm also not arguing, just disagreeing.  You're the one getting defensive and being a little overly dramatic here.  On any day, good winter or bad winter, big storm or dusting, there are aspects that got more snow than others.  The point of measuring snowfall at the same point always is that it normalizes these effects.  For example, the top of 7th heaven always gets more snow than the base of Stevens.  It doesn't do any good when someone says it was a bad winter with lower than average snowfall to say ""nah, there was always tons of snow at the top of 7th.""  Because if it had been a good winter, there would have been even more snow up there.  But if you don't understand my point and want to believe we got a lot of snow last year, hey, more power to you."
skiing,3dijpv,jaobrien6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:39:30 2015 UTC,"I understood it   No you didn't. I am not saying we had an above average year, or even a good one. That's the point you're arguing against."

But if you're gonna do that, don't sell your Chronics because they're a better and slightly stiffer ski, and you'll enjoy them more if you take any trips to bigger mountains.

Boots-600 poles-100 Bindings-350x2=700 Ski-500x2 total-2400 plus taxes  should give you a decent ballpark for a good setup, all new.

skiing,3dhij4,sruffian,3,Thu Jul 16 13:58:47 2015 UTC,"A couple of his numbers are pretty high, IMO.   There's no reason to spend $100 on poles, find a cheap pair on sale that's the right size and straight.  I spent $20 on my last pair. You can get excellent bindings for about $150 to $200.  Unless you're getting touring bindings for backcountry use or unless you need 18 DIN bindings (I feel confident in saying you probably don't), there are no bindings out there you should be spending $350 on.   $600 for boots and $500 for skis are reasonable ball parks.  You can find cheaper if you find great sales or depending on what you're looking at, but those are reasonable price points to budget IMO.  Edit: I don't know what you'll be looking at for racing, now that I re-read.  I've never raced so I don't know what appropriate price points for that gear would be.

It shows that El Nino doesn't necessarily mean a terrible season especially up here in Whistler. The problem the PNW had this year and will most likely have next year is ""The Blob."" The Blob is a warm body of water that is sitting on the west coast and is the reason for the terrible snow season seen in the PNW. If this Blob persists then I presume the PNW is going to have a terrible season. Although at this point it is pointless trying to predict winter weather in the middle of the summer.

Everyone I know that has worked for Vail Resorts has nothing but bad things to say."

Keystone seems like it'd be one of the cooler ones to work at, or at least that's the consensus I've gotten from my friends who have worked there. If you're comfortable with the realities of spending a year or two in the mountains (i.e. low pay, mediocre living conditions, hard and often very physical work) then your happiness in whatever job you choose at VR is gonna be 100% down to your department management. If your bosses are good, you'll have a great time...if they suck, you probably won't enjoy it as much. I've been in both situations.   I worked for Vail, and I think it was a bit more of a grating experience in large part because that's the company's flagship resort, so there was a lot of attempted micro-management going on at the top level.   I find that the people who are most jaded about the VR experience are the ones who ended up choosing to stay in the mountains long term, but who didn't really put much thought into how to sustain that life choice and ended up working a shitty on-mountain job for a year or two longer than they wanted."

Don't be afraid to work for VR for a season, it's a really good way to initiate yourself to this culture and lifestyle...but like others have said, immediately start looking for the next job idea so that you don't have to do it for more than a year."

skiing,3d66ey,RidinTheMonster,2,Wed Jul 15 02:17:26 2015 UTC,"you dont need to be a fantastic skier to be a ski instructor. the majority of ski lessons at any vacation destination resort are going to be beginners, and as someone with no experience, that's what you would be teaching. while it's nice to be able to ski every day as an instructor, some people prefer getting some other job at the resort(snowmaking, lift, etc.) because, while potentially not as lucrative(no tips), the hours allow for more freeskiing, and you still get a season pass. you could also work at a local restaurant or bar that is a known apres ski spot. I wouldn't worry too much about getting rejected, just apply early. there's a high turnover rate in ski instructing, resorts always need more people."

You shouldn't have to share rooms and live with so many damn people for 900+ a month, even when you're paying in Canada Cash.  I wouldn't do it until you start to get real desperate.

If you're old and all you care about is comfort, and you just want to take 4 laps on the same groomer then go to the bar, they're probably fine for you.  I wouldn't even recommend them to those people though. I would recommend they just go get a cheap normal ski boot with a soft liner and a somewhat sloppy fit. Honestly if you're shit enough at skiing that the Apex would be a good choice for you, then having a professionally fit performance boot probably isn't in your wheelhouse yet/ever. A ""comfort fit"" boot (read: the sort of fit a NY house wife gets when she sits down at the rental place and bitches to the boot guy about how much the first 3 pairs hurt) is going to do all the skiing stuff better than the Apex...it just won't be quite as comfortable to walk in.  But guess what? If you can ski, but you can't bear to walk more than 50 yards in ski boots, you're a pussy. If you can't overcome that, well, start carrying a backpack with some boat shoes in it for going to/from the snow, if you must. Just don't ever, ever, ever buy a pair of Apex boots."

Lots of waiting in boots that never fit me quite right pushed me that way. I'm more than happy to let them go, but am a bit pissed off paying so much for a sub par product."

Don't back down when they try to give you the runaround and offer to just fix them, tell them you hate them and just want your money back. They're going to try to not give it to you since you skied on them a bunch already, but just stick to your guns and it should work out.  Then, when you're done with all that and you have new boots, make your girlfriend start taking lessons so you can actually go skiing."

Anyway, the fact that they have a model that costs almost $1100 before shipping and whatever else is just out-fucking-rageous. You can get a whole setup for that much if you spend wisely. Hell, if you shop around a bit you can get some of the best current model year performance boots on the market for like half that...even less if you look 1-2 model years back for some new-old-stock stuff.    I know why these guys are still in business, they're supported by the same demographic that keeps Bogner alive...if you're trying to get better at skiing just leave these things alone, they're not for you."

I think I ran a deficit the two years I was a bum in Vail, but had a great time. One thought, if you're only a sophomore will you be old enough to get into bars where you want to go?  Besides skiing bars are pretty much the only nightlife in many ski Towns. However if you don't need to ski a lot you can work days and have all your nights free for socializing. Working somewhere for tips can be way more lucrative than a hourly rate, so even bussing tables or such can bring in more than working for the mountain. Also if you're not in it for the skiing you can do the same thing at a beach resort or even cruise lines."

skiing,3cz0wl,snowclimber,3,Sun Jul 12 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"Pro patroller here.  I've taken lots of injured people off the slopes that were taking various blood thinners -- mostly coumadin.  Taking blood thinners shouldn't stop you from skiing.  You'll be fine.  You should go ski whatever you want to ski.  If you're into skiing double blacks, sweet.  Honestly bro, the vast majority of the horrible things I've seen happen to people occur on green and blue runs.  It's pretty shocking and unbelievable how bad people can fuck themselves up on a flat, wide open green run.  And forget about collisions.  I've been on hundreds of 'em and they're what I worry about -- some bongelo skiing into me.       Skiing on groomed runs is dangerous and statistically speaking, you are far more likely to get hurt skiing on groomed runs than in expert terrain.  So bro, if you're gonna go skiing -- and you should -- then ski what you want to ski.  Just ski carefully and in control and don't take particularly unnecessary risks like jumps, rails and extreme terrain, and it's all good."
skiing,3cz0wl,prkspilot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:09:10 2015 UTC,"Which blood thinner?  What heart surgery?  Honestly, if you're in an accident that would cause hemodynamic issues, the medication wouldn't be your worst concern.  I would think it would be blood loss on a mountain.  You may be more likely for brain trouble, but wear a helmet and stay out of the terrain park.  Mitigate the issue....don't give up skiing!"
skiing,3cz0wl,HaemoglobinUK,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:50:48 2015 UTC,Hooray for Warfarin!   The best advice I can give (as someone who works in a hospital although is not a doctor) is to discuss it with your doctor (or another specialist) and make sure you take care of yourself. Considering you're so young this is a pretty shitty set up but it may not be as bad as it seems once you've talked to your doctor.
skiing,3cz0wl,Bad-Phish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:15:43 2015 UTC,"What type of surgery? What type of blood thinners. If just aspirin/plavix, you are probably OK. Anticoagants like Coumadin/Xarelto/Lovenox are a much bigger issue. I personally would not ski on them, but everyone has a different level of acceptable risk. On them relatively minor trauma (especially head trauma) could put you in a real bad situation. If you chose to continue, I think you are going to be stuck on the easier groomers. Also, while Coumadin is much harder to regulate (frequently have to check level, lots of dietary restrictions), it is the only one that can be reversed if you have a bleeding complication. Agents like Xarelto, Lovenox, and similar do not require any monitoring, but cannot be effectively reversed in an emergency.  Also, are you getting a valve? Bovine and porcine valves do not require anticoagulation, but don'tast nearly as long as mechanical ones. I know of young peoe who opted for tissue valves, knowing they would need a replacement in the future, just so they could go through their 20s and 30s without changing their lifestyle. These were however D1 college athletes."
skiing,3cz0wl,booyoukarmawhore,5,Sun Jul 12 09:13:57 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the sticking to groomed runs. It depends in his ability.

We could be in for record-breaking precipitation, but a lot more of it in the form of rain than we'll want to see.  (Not to mention that we rely on the snowpack to refill reservoirs in the spring.

I try to go to Taos about 3-5 times a year, but I'm coming in from Albuquerque so its close to 4 hours each way.  Santa Fe is great though.  Good vertical feet, short lines, great spread of difficulty.  They have enough runs that you can go all day and not get bored doing the same runs.  My only complaint is that they don't have a turbo lift.  Some advice:  If you don't get a season pass, get at least a peak plus card.  For $60 you get a $25 discount, so you save money as long as you go more than 3 times.  Watch yourself during Texas spring break.  SF is a hot place to go during their spring break and they are all insane.  A lot of them don't know their limits and will do blacks when they should be on greens.  I don't mind vacationers, its good for the park and the state, but Texans are just plain crazy."

I hate the lifts, the slopes aren't that great, the staff are always rude as shit, and the owners (same people that own Sandia) are assholes who don't give a shit about their ski patrol, the locals, or local companies like Twin Tip Nation (even though they're not so much a thing any more). Besides, it's way too expensive for what you're getting. Even if you live in Santa Fe it's worth it to drive to Angel Fire or Pajarito or Taos or anything other than SSF.  But, that's just my opinion, and it's not an opinion many people share."

In addition to ice skating, and doing cardio alternating days among a bike, elliptical, and treadmill (those are in a gym), I hired a personal trainer at the beginning of the summer to give me some exercises to keep me in shape for tennis as well as preparing me for skiing (he's a semi-pro road biker who retired as a professional when he had a horrific accident). Here's some of the stuff for my legs that I do in the gym every other day (I do upper-body exercises one day, legs the next, and so on):   On this machine I perform sets on one leg at a time. So I'll do presses with my right leg for three sets, then switch to my left leg. I only press as much as my weaker leg dictates (which is my left leg). On the same machine, I work out my calves, again, one leg at a time for three sets, by placing the mid-sole of my foot on the bottom edge of the press with my leg extended, then roll that foot up and down to make sure I maintain good mobility and strength in my calves. On this machine I do three sets of adductors, then three sets of abductors on a similar machine.  From a stationary box, I start on top of it, with my heels near the edge and I bounce off the floor back up to the top of the box, in three sets, again.  On a smaller box I perform lateral box walkovers like this.  Plank Sit-ups on a ball.  I perform other exercises, free of weights, but I'm forgetful when it comes to their names, and I don't know how to describe one of them that I do on the floor, but I'll try. One exercise is like being in down-dog but I bounce from side to side with my legs with my left leg behind me on the right side, then my right leg behind me on the left side (I'm so sorry, I don't know how to better explain it). I also do burpees.    I know I'm forgetting something, but can't remember what at the moment. If you want to know my upper body routine, just let me know. Good luck!"

Let's say a run is a mile and you're making moderate wide turns, say 50'. That's 100 turns a run, each turn is a squat. 10 runs an hour and it's a thousand squats an hour. The first couple days suck.

But now they press a variety of pairs in different models and lengths. Mine are the billy goat tour that was replaced by the steeple 112. Some of those were made in a wood veneer this year, and AFAIK they are doing things similarly next year.  The wood veneer adds a non-negligeable amount of stiffness to the ski. Not a ton, but it is there and most noticeable in the tips and tails, as you might expect. Not necessarily a bad thing, just FYI. Like I said, I love the effect it had on my billy goat tours."

The first gen aluminum toe piece was prone to either cracking at the base plate or toe wings. The toe wings have been reinforced and a different aluminum alloy for the base plate. I personally haven't had issues with them since. There are reports of the heels breaking at the post. I haven't had problems, but YMMV of course.  IMO, where they have the upper hand over, say, a dynafit radical is weight and retention. I pre-release from the toe more than I'd like with the toes unlocked with radicals. I'm able to stay in plums much, much better. And if you can put up with no brakes but want a higher din than something like a speed radical, these are lighter than a brakeless radical ft."

One thing I should probably mention too is there is no longer a plum distributor in the US. At least as far as I know. Not that the distributor before was actually useful at all though...  If you do end up with a pair of plums, any binding without a factory warranty, or just need spare parts, skimo.com will be your best friend. They're a solid company and have by far the best supply of anybody in the US of spare parts for these sort of bindings.  Have a good season yourself!"

skiing,3cl73c,LifeInvader04,4,Wed Jul 8 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"Comparing a traditional binding to a tech binding is like comparing a swimming pool to the ocean. Sure fundamentally they are doing the same thing, but they are really very different pieces of equipment. Moreover tech bindings are for touring, traditional bindings are not. They have the dynafiddle nickname because people who use them tend to fiddle with them to get the exact setup they want and like, not because they're difficult to use.  I'm really not sure that there is a context in which comparing the two makes much sense."
skiing,3cl73c,McTonkey,3,Wed Jul 8 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"If you can either tolerate and not break them inbounds, or dedicate a BC rig, there is no other way to go IMO.  There is definitely a learning curve but once you're familiar with what they can and can't do and the small things you need to be careful about (like ice under the toe, etc), they really aren't difficult to use.  Frame bindings have their place. If you're strong enough, they will work acceptably for touring if you can't dedicate a BC  rig w/ tech bindings. If your want to put some serious mileage down, get a tech set up. Fitness will only get you so far (literally). Tech bindings are much easier repair in the field and make it out on a broken binding. I'll often carry an extra toe with me on more committing days (I know some people carry an extra toe and heel). Wouldn't want to carry an extra guardian or duke in my pack..."

I'm sure if you go to Vail or aspen, yeah, culture of affluence describes it pretty well. But in my circle of friends, yes, we do spend a fair amount of money on ski stuff, but it is our biggest passion in life. None of us make tons of money, I'd say 95% of us make well under 100k per year. Most of us either work or have worked in the industry or have pretty average jobs. Skiing is the most important thing to us though, so it gets prioritized financially.  Its like the 18-24 year old DH mtb crowd. 7-8k+ bikes on top of 2000 shitbox cars.

You have to be a technical master and, willing or not, you have to take huge risks. (And catch great light with excellent technical and editing support on the video.)"
skiing,3chj9l,JohnnyUtah,2,Wed Jul 8 09:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think the reason the video is boring to watch is because it breaks a ton of the rules for watchable videos.    Long clips, most are hard to see what's happening, it's all the same POV of controlled skiing, he's not expressive [at least the parts I skipped through].    There are several entertaining videos, even from poor skiers, that I've been able to watch, simply because they make watchable edits.  I think more important, is that it's disheartening that so many people are being negative on this video because of how he skis, and how it works for him; that it doesn't fit into a specific ""culture"".  There's so much talk about ski racer elitism; this is just so ironic.   I was on the gopro subreddit last week and there was a link to a snowboarding video where some guy on the flip side was teaching his girlfriend how to snowboard.  I watched the edit and instantly hoped he didn't post it on the snowboarding reddit, because I assumed it would get torn apart like so many edits do on this subreddit.  He did post to the snowboarding reddit, and he actually got ""good edit"", and positive vibes from everyone there.  I don't know why we don't give positive vibes to everyone here, whether they're a beginner, amateur, or in this ridiculous case, gold medalists.  TLDR:  I like Two Door Cinema Club and don't need to know how to cook up cocaine to enjoy skiing."

skiing,3chj9l,paradigm99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"Good lord everyone. It was meant as a light hearted joking comment. That's why I included the * and the second sentence.   As for the other part of your comment saying he grew up in Utah and this video not being a representation of his skiing in powder. I've grown up in Utah as well and have been skiing since I could walk. Watching this video, as the only video I've seen of him skiing anywhere other than a race course, there wasn't anything that made me go wow. Like a few other people commented, unless they knew it was Ligety before the video they never would have thought he was a professional skier. I'm sure he was taking it easy in the video and just making some turns, but if I had no prior knowledge of who he was I would say yeah I'm a better skier that that. I can guarantee he doesn't go as big as he could from fear of injury. But there are also a lot of skiers that are really good in certain settings, but not in others. I know a few guys that compete in park that absolutely kill it, that can barely turn anywhere else. Or racers that can't ski bumps to save their lives. Being able to ski extremely well in certain areas doesn't necessarily mean you're going to kill it in every situation.  Here's one of the only other links I could find of him skiing powder. Again nothing worth saying wow over, just a guy making a few turns. By no means is he anything close to a bad skier, but realistically if this post was made by some random guy, we would all be like that looks like fun. Nobody would be commenting on the guys skiing abilities. Unless there was a dick saying they could ski better than that. http://youtu.be/ne8Ibjzp02I"

skiing,3cgqcd,bigmo5,3,Tue Jul 7 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"I'll caveat this by saying I've never tried them, but for that price (starts at $1750), I would rather get 2-3 pairs of skis from a nice spring sale. I actually think your odds of riding a ski that you love on any particular day would be with a quiver to select from than a single custom ski.   An analogue...  If you're goal was to pick the team that was going to win the world series, would you rather a) choose the Cardinals or b) get to choose 3 teams. The Cardinals have the best record, but I would still choose option B."
skiing,3cgqcd,wrob,2,Tue Jul 7 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"Your paying them $1000+ to ""fit"" you to a ski shape/profile that you will like...much like a boot fitter. Overpriced imo but if money isn't an issue, go for it. I have not heard anything bad except cost. Just remember, you pretty much dont buy skis ""for life"". You live in Telluride so I am assuming you ride alot. They will be beat/dead after a few seasons & need replaced, just like a ski off the shelf. Then you will have to fork over big bucks again.  Why not just spend a full day or two demoing? Thats the normal way to ""fit yourself to a ski shape"". You'll find a ski(or two) that you love and walk away with $1000 in your pocket. Your in a ski town so you probably have access to just about every brand/shape/stiffness available(call your regional reps if you have to)."
skiing,3cgqcd,FreeballinPGH,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:46:35 2015 UTC,"But isn't it worth it to have a solid pair that you know are going to be great for you? Also, you know they will tune them and make sure everything is working? I am still hesitate but need to know if they are worth it."
skiing,3cgqcd,FreeballinPGH,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"You will find a great ski that you will love if you demo(for half the price).  Take this lightly, your not some ""special snowflake"".  There are hundreds of skis by dozens of brands backup by knowledgeable individuals. You WILL find something. Think of it this way. If custom skis like Wagner were worth it(performance advantage over off the shelf skis), we would see every pro/am rushing to get them. But that's not happening.   Tune & working? Any ski shops can give you custom tunes & help you decide on edges if you think you need more than the standard tune. You will know if a ski ""works"" for you after a few demo laps.  Lastly, do you have/plan on buying other setups? One ski setups(even a custom $1700 Wagner) simply wont cover you every day.  Why spend that much on 1 pair when you could have 3 pairs that actually cover every day/situation?  For example, I have a park/all mountain ski, a pow ski, & touring ski currently. I spent less than $1700 on all 3 combined. I am always covered & have options for everyday & situation. Lets face it, not every day is a powder day & conditions change fast. I would never give up that flexibility for one setup."

skiing,3cgw54,gotanychange,3,Tue Jul 7 20:34:28 2015 UTC,"Hey man stay strong i had my second ACLsurgery in four years today (on my birthday haha). There is a sub for ACL injuries that is really helpful for fitness and rehab advice (can't link on mobile). A stationary bike will become your best friend after the first few weeks. It is vital that you try to extend your leg fully as soon as you have had surgery or yourisk never getting that extension back, bending will come naturally once the swelling goes down so don't worry too much about it.  Apart from that make sure you do everything your physio does intensively and don't rush back into sports that will strain the knee. Feel free to pm me if you neer advice or someone to talk to it can be a bit of a lonely journey at times.  The above is important but the best piece of advice i can give you is stay mentally strong and remember that it will get better! I had my right leg done 4 years ago and missed a whole season but came back stronger and able to ski just as much and as well as before because of the sheer effort you need to put into strengthening you quads and hamstrings!"
skiing,3cgw54,ganjapeace,2,Tue Jul 7 21:19:45 2015 UTC,"ACLs are a total crapshoot. Two of my friends tore theirs playing soccer on the same day about four months ago - one is almost completely better now, and one still needs crutches. Find a good physical therapist and just try to get back to full range of motion as quickly as you can, but don't push it. Beyond that it's mostly luck."

skiing,3cgw54,nonzero_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Had ACL surgery 3.5 months ago. My partner took me on an overseas ski trip (my first time skiing, ever) in January. On the first day, in the first 2 hours, I ruptured my ACL. Physio told me to rest for one week, then I skied very gently again for another 3 days with a hinged brace. Surgery was in March, and due to having a terrible physiotherapist for the first 2 months, recovery was slow. I've switched physios, and she is helping me with rehab a whole lot more. We've got our next ski trip planned for the end of the year (I'm in Australia, we have to travel far for snow), so I've got a goal. In terms of advice for helping your legs be strong for skiing again.. exercise bike / cycling is really good, and your balance is important. When you do injuries like this, you lose balance. Your body has muscle memory, which includes remembering how to balance. ""If you don't use it, you lose it."" Balance exercises are important, not just building muscle again. Make sure you find a good physiotherapist to help with your rehab, and make sure they understand and are happy to work with you to get back to skiing, as opposed to just having a functioning knee again. Other piece of advice, like /u/ganjapeace said, is stay strong mentally. I have days where I get angry and upset, and I just want a knee that was normal like before. Be gentle with it, don't push yourself tooooo hard. Be in touch with your body, be aware of your movements, keep your chin up, and it'll be ok. Good luck, feel free to PM me. :0)"

skiing,3cgw54,shinymuggle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"The basic standing on one leg, progressing to rolling up a towel and balancing on it with one leg, progressing to doing so with your eyes closed. From there, start distracting yourself to make things harder: throw a ball while balancing on one leg to either yourself (just up and down) or back and forth to a friend or family member. Incorporate very light squats into it (pre-surgery, it was about 2.5 months until I was allowed to do a squat post-surgery). If you have access to a balance ball / wobble board, they're great too, starting off with both legs, then one leg."

I'd scope out what you think you want, keep an eye on it, make sure the right sizes for you are there; the less there are of them the cheaper they will be, so if you get them right before they sell out you'll be paying the least amount of money.

skiing,3cfymt,One_Mikey,0,Tue Jul 7 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"From the guide in the sidebar;  Should I buy/use these old skis I was given/found on Craigslist? No. You definitely can, I’d even encourage you to give a pair of straight skis a go so you can see what it was like for your forefathers. But wait until you’ve gained some level of proficiency first.   The thing is, about 15 or so years ago, the concepts and principles that drive ski design underwent a fairly radical transformation. We went from essentially dead straight skis to the shaped skis you see today. The older style make learning, and skiing in general, more difficult. Because they’re straight, it takes a process of un-weighting, transferring that weight to the other ski, and then actively flexing the ski to initiate a turn. Done correctly this becomes a very precise but subtle process and is very difficult to master. Modern skis essentially turn themselves. With wide tips and tails, and a narrower waist, the physics of modern skis mean that you initiate a turn just by transferring your weight, making the whole thing a lot easier.      More importantly the bindings you are likely to find mounted on them are no longer indemnified, which means they are no longer considered safe and no one will adjust or repair them for you. Like everything bindings atrophy over time. Think about it, something made up mainly of metal components that have been exposed to moisture, wind and large temperature variation and plastics that have faced the same conditions. More crucially the mechanisms of bindings are dominated by springs that obviously will lose the shape and elasticity that they require for the binding to function properly. That doesn't mean that they will fail but it does mean that they are a lot more likely to. Like skis, binding design and the mechanisms that hold and release you have been improved as well. They create less stress on parts of your body like the knees and hips than bindings from 15+ years ago.  Finally, no one will work, adjust or even look at the bindings. Each binding manufacturer maintains a regularly updated list of their bindings that they continue to indemnify. This is a list of models that the manufacturer still deems to be guaranteed in acceptable working order. No ski tech (the guys in the workshop) will even look at a pair of bindings unless they are on that list. That's simply because when you blow out your knee from the binding not releasing or breaking in the middle of a run, they don't want to have lawyers chasing after then, and neither do the binding companies. It is also the case that only the bindings on that list that will have spare parts like brakes and AFDs available, so if there are issues with the bindings they will be difficult to repaired."

Colorado is much more expensive but has several resorts in the same area. Will encounter many tourists,  college age kids, and partying. Lots of free shit to do like the x-games/concerts. Still fun to be found if your looking for a classic winter out West.   Wyoming is more expensive but very rugged. Fewer people and development. If your looking for a more remote feel with some of the best terrain, this is a solid choice. The outdoors is pretty much the entertainment and is one of a kind.

I'm looking at the Dakine Heli Pro DLX 24L pack and it seems like it's small enough to stay out of the way but big enough for me to pack everything for one day. Essentially until I ski backcountry it would be used to hold some gear (food, hydration pack included, extra gloves, camera etc.) for one day at a time. But would it still be good enough to use in the backcountry afterwards?  In short, is it worth buying a pack now and using for at the resorts and backcountry later, or should I just wait until I hit the backcountry?"

It is nice to have extra room in your pack so you can rummage for things...if your pack is sealed tight, it all has to come out when you need something from the bottom.

Extra layers take up the most room, and this is dependent on the weather conditions and weather or not you have gear like a puffy that will pack small.  I don't have a good puffy, so extra layers takes a lot of room in my pack.  Maybe if i had a puffy it could fit in a 24?  not sure though... Once you are done hiking you are covered in sweat, and its nice to be able to chance your underlayer, then throw on something warm and your shell.  Also food, water, crampons, firstaid kit, goggles/sunglasses, hat/helmet, extra gloves and socks, skins, face mask, probe/shovel, light, maps, phone...  may be forgetting some stuff.

skiing,3c988p,grumpywasatchskier,2,Mon Jul 6 04:38:17 2015 UTC,Yeah the skis I like the most are outfitted with Dynafits and I ski them at the resort all the time.  They haven't blown up yet and I've certainly put them to the test.

skiing,3c988p,Tancoll,3,Mon Jul 6 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"You have 2 real choices. Frame style bindings (Marker Baron/Duke/F10/F12, Salomon/Atomic Guardian/Tracker, Tyrolia Adrenalin etc.) or tech bindings (Dynafit, G3 etc) there are also the new generation bindings like the Dynafit Beast and Marker Kingpin.   If you want a bidning that is going to give you the most similar feeling to what you're used to, you want a frame style binding. The issues with them is that the weight and the walking mechanisms are less than perfect for going uphill, but the downhill performance is going to be pretty close to a traditional alpine binding system. The other benefit is that you're not going to have to get new boots as well, although if you don't have boot with at least a walk mode, it's not much fun going uphill.   Tech bindings offer much improvement on the uphill (lighter, more natural range of motion) and the downsides that you hear about are overblown and exaggerated. I know plenty of people (myself included) who ski hard on Dynafit radical STs or FTs. The other thing to consider; are you going to be skiing as aggressively outside the resort as you do inside? If your answer is yes, I'd suggest reassessing that attitude. You will have to update to tech compatible boots as well though.   tl:dr; the performance differences are negligable, don't buy into the idea that tech bindings can't be skied hard, frame binding are more like what you're used to but are shit if you're actually doing much touring."
skiing,3c988p,Maladjusted_vagabond,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:24:49 2015 UTC,So im fine dropping of ledges on tech bindings while still having a decent range of motion for beginner touring?

Also I am buying a new pair of boots at the same time so Ill get boots accordingly (any advice on boots is welcome too in regards to touring)
skiing,3c988p,Maladjusted_vagabond,4,Mon Jul 6 19:54:09 2015 UTC,"Before Hoji basically invented the Beasts (which might be a better tech option if you're really getting after it), he was skiing on radicals and if you're skiing harder than him i'll eat my STs. I'm really not too familiar with what we're looking at in the region you describe. If there aren't any long approaches etc, you might be better off with a frame to start with. That was the route I took, but I ended up getting a tech setup the next season. If you're going to really get into it, you're going to be on tech eventually.  Only advice about boots is go see a good and reputable fitter. Other than that this might help understanding the different bindings/boot compatibilities.

skiing,3c988p,toast2266,3,Mon Jul 6 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"The problem with tech bindings isn't getting rad in the backcountry - they're fine for that.  The problem is inbounds; they ski really harsh because, unlike a traditional alpine binding (or a frame touring binding for that matter) there isn't really any elasticity built into the binding.  Add to that the fact that most of the tech bindings have a pretty vague connection at the heal, they don't really ski all that well in hard snow conditions.  In soft snow (presumably what you'd be finding in the backcountry) all of these traits are far less noticeable, so tech bindings are generally preferable since they tour waaaay better than any frame binding.  Obviously there's plenty of people that ski tech bindings inbounds and do just fine.  But there are also lots of people who ski inbounds on snowblades; just because people do it, doesn't mean it's not stupid.

Someone said don't leave PC because there are too many Mormons. Ignore that advice. Salt Lake City has a fun downtown that has changed a lot over the last 10 years.

Where you want to live I guess depends on what kind of lifestyle you're looking for. Most of the local going-ons will be happening around the old town side. That's a cool place to live if you want to experience the local culture of a ski town and be able to stumble home from Main Street. I'm guessing by ""outside of PC"", you're asking about Kimball Junction/Synderville. That's a fine place to live if you're looking for something a little quieter, and might be able to find slightly cheaper accommodations. It's a 10 minute drive into town from the junction. The bus (free) runs till ~9:30 during the off season, and ~midnight during the season. I wouldn't recommend living there if you don't have a car, but it's something worth considering if you do.   Get an epic pass to Canyons/PCMR. You'll be coming in during the shoulder season. Plenty of other seasonal workers start coming in around that time, but it still very much has the ""small town, locals only"" feel during that time. Once the season starts, town starts picking up speed and the nightlife gets pretty entertaining. I often find myself muttering about ""too many tourists"" and traffic can be bad. Ask if you have any specific questions about neighborhoods you're looking at."

This link will break it down for you:  http://www.canyonsresort.com/plan-your-trip/season-passes/season-passes-explorer.aspx  Supposedly, Vail is gonna have Canyons and PCMR connected this winter with a gondola, but I haven't heard any recent news on how that's progressing. If you're coming here to work for one of the resorts, you'll probably get some ski privileges to some of the other places in Utah. But the cottonwood canyons are about an hour away from PC, so PC isn't the best location if you were hoping to ski those all of the time.  *edit: To clarify, all the other resorts in Utah except Alta-Snowbird (and Deer Valley-Solitude, which I'm only mentioning as an aside for a reason) are going to be their own thing as far as passes go.

While having a car is nice, it is definitely not necessary. There is also a bus that goes between SLC and PC but its only a few times a day.  With all of that said, having lived in both SLC and PC, I MUCH prefer PC and its not even close. Especially in the summer, its about 20 degrees cooler than the Salt Lake Valley.

skiing,3c53f2,justamerica46,6,Sat Jul 4 21:38:17 2015 UTC,"So much fucking wrong information here.  Some baseline information:  The entire pivot series - P12 thu P18 - have the same turntable heel design. They don't release purely laterally, purely from the heel. If cough some posters cough had a basic grasp of mechanical concepts, they would see that to make this happen, there would have to be some serious compromises (a la knee binding). The turntable heel works in conjunction with the toe. This design has been more or less unchanged for almost 20 years for a simple reason: They work. And they work really fucking well. It's not marketing bullshit.  The toe on the P12 and P14 is the same housing, but different spring. It is plastic, and has pivoting toe wings. It is NOT a single pivot design. They work just fine, no appreciably better or worse than anygeneric 14 din plastic binder out there imo. I've personally broken two of these and will not use them. There isn't anything inherently wrong with the binding, but I am extremely hard on gear, so this may or may not matter to you. The old P15/FKS155, PX15 (different heel), and the current P18/FKS 18 are a metal, single pivot toe. These are essentially indestructible and have more elasticity. I forget the actual numbers.  Now that all that's out of the way:  The turntable heel will not save your ACL in a backwards, twisting fall. The single pivot toe may/probably allows for a more consistent release in these situations, but if you're fucked, you're fucked - no binding is going to magically protect you from torn ACLs (possible exception: knee binding, but maladjusted put it nicely re: these ""bindings"").  The increased, multidirectional elasticity in the heel combined with a single pivot, metal toe in the p15 and p18 make for an insanely elastic and durable set up. You will be able to run a lower din setting in the heel, probably the toe as well, than any other binding without pre-releases. Metal binding=indestructable as well. Solly 997, 900s with metal toe/916/sth16 steel are the only other bindings that meet or exceed the durability of the metal fks.  The binding is also no less laterally rigid than an STH 14, or any other common binding. You can feel the ski flex more underfoot due to the drastically smaller mounting platform and increased elasticity in the heel. A 916 family binding is heavier too. However, as far as power transfer to the ski, you will sure as shit not notice any difference. Especially when you factor in things like non rigid bridges, rubber/replaceable toe lugs, lateral stiffness in boots. There are so many other things that make so much more of a difference that for all intents and purposes, they're gonna have the same lateral rigidity as any other option.  The P15-18, along with the 916 family, are the only alpine bindings I've used that I don't either break or pre-release from constantly. This includes guardians, p12-14, px12-14, sth14, sth2, and some others not worth mentioning. However, I do believe they are superior to the 916 in release characteristics since I am able to run a lower din setting (toe and heel) without pre releases. They do have a different feel due to lighter weight than a 916, increased elastic travel, and shorter/smaller mount footprint, but for all intents and purposes, are just as ""powerful"" when it comes to lateral power transmission as a 916. This all is just anecdotal of course, but it is at least based on my (and other's) real world experiences, unlike some of these other posters apparently just talking out of their ass."

Anecdotally people will say they're better for the knees but there is nothing to suggest that is definitively the case. The release can feel 'smoother' than bindings with different mechanisms but they won't, and aren't designed to, specifically protect your knee. Fantastic binding overall though. If you're looking for knee protection from a binding the only real option is the KNEE binding, but good luck doing much skiing on them."
skiing,3c53f2,Maladjusted_vagabond,3,Sat Jul 4 21:51:31 2015 UTC,They work extremely well and are practically bombproof. The only bad thing I can think of is that they can be a bitch to get on in deep snow.

skiing,3c53f2,McTonkey,2,Mon Jul 6 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"If they are the new pivot binders they won't prevent all ACL tears. There is a difference with pivot and FKS binders. Fks are an older model but we're recently put back into production. I lost my acl and meniscus to fks binders, but they are still my favorite binding. Pivots don't rotate 360 degrees, and are not in production anymore, but I used them for over 4 years with no problems other than the plastic breaking down.   If I blow my ACL it's going to be my fault with pivots/fks. They don't prevent knee injuries, they might help, but they are the most bombproof and easiest to maintain in my experience. I have 4 pairs and extra parts for them all, so you can say I am a fan.   I prefer them personally, but because I know the bindings inside and out. They are pretty simple.   I always recommend fks binders, but saying they will save you an ACL is pretty stupid. In some falls they will, but not all."
skiing,3c53f2,RNAPII,4,Sun Jul 5 01:18:11 2015 UTC,I have the current model pivots & fks. They have the exact same range of motion. The older model you have might be different. The only difference between the current pivot and fks is color choices.
skiing,3c53f2,wineandwoman,2,Sun Jul 5 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"The nomenclature is weird, but the pivots changed years ago and were different using a spring so you couldn't have 360 degrees of motion in the heal. Then they took the pivot name and slapped it on fks style bindings when they re released them. The toe piece is pretty much the same but the heal piece is different. I found the old pivots to work better, but had more moving parts and broke easily.   When they stopped producing fks binders I used to buy old race stock of them."

Haven't seen em in a while, but they developed some serious lateral play in the heel. I actually had a pair mounted on some old ass moment donner partys since 140something underfoot R/R doesn't care about lateral rigidity.  The p/fks 18 toepiece is the same toe piece as the old fks 155, old fks 180, px15 race, and current fks 180. The p/fks 12/14 shares the same plastic explode-a-toe with the px12/14.  Also, there was a fks style heel w/ metal geze toe that was not a single pivot. I believe produced for a short period in the early-mid 90s? One iteration (dunno if there were others, I think there might have been) was branded as the Rossignol 1_0 pro. I don't think that's what RNAPII is referring to though."

skiing,3c53f2,RNAPII,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"all of the best bindings do essentially the same thing well - release when there is too much torque on your boot.  However, the FKS (pivot) bindings do one thing better than any other binding - they have the most elastic travel before the release.  What this means, is that they give you the best chance of riding through a momentary excess of torque without completely releasing.  They flex with the onset of torque, and keep flexing until they finally release.  If the torque corrects itself, they'll pop back into place.  On the other hand if the torque continues, they'll pop out.  The very definition of what a binding should do: release when they should and not when they shouldn't. TL/DR: FKS/Pivot are the best bindings you can buy."
skiing,3c53f2,jondrums,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:25:33 2015 UTC,I've been getting some mixed feelings in this thread but this is a pretty solid answer. Thanks for taking the time for it.
skiing,3c53f2,neatopat,-2,Sun Jul 5 13:40:27 2015 UTC,This is the worst answer in this thread. Every binding does exactly what he's saying and what he says about the elastic return of look/fks bindings isn't true. Salomon STH2 have the most elastic return. This is a perfect example of how r/skiing is full of a bunch of uneducated misinformed idiots spreading misinformation.    You should probably not believe anything anybody says and do some research for yourself on the Internet.
skiing,3c53f2,jondrums,2,Sun Jul 5 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"I stand by everything I posted in the top level comment.  With the possible exception of the TL/DR, which is clearly opinion and should be taken with a grain of salt. I am a true binding geek so I guess I can't help but jump in to what I look at as a really fun topic.    I have every ski binding worth considering in my garage with the exception of tele gear - and I have skied them all extensively.  I know what I prefer and I have good reasons.  There are lots of legitimate reasons to pick bindings, and mostly you can't go wrong with the higher end lines of the big name brands - Salomon, Marker, Look/Rossignol, Tyrolia, and Dynafit.  I'm firmly with CaCoD on this topic(perhaps we have even crossed paths somewhere - I use the same handle in multiple places :).  For alpine, I will only ski FKS 15/18 or Salomon 916/920.  My hands down favorite binding of all time is the original FKS pro 180 with the 4-bolt geze style pig-nose toe.  Talk about a true binding geek...  Here are the reasons why I would use a different binding:   the brakes are non-functional when bent super wide, so I use 916 bindings on my 138mm skis.   the toepiece won't fit a rubber soled rockered boot, so for this I use old Salomon 977-Racing bindings which have enough vertical adjustment in the toe to accommodate.  I also use a look sliding AFD modified to fit the 977s for a better release.  A better choice for almost everyone would be the Marker Squire, which has a sliding AFD and adjustable height in the toe out of the box. For almost all touring I do, I am on Plum Guides (Dynafit style) or Dynafit Radical FT.  In the off chance that I really want to tour in my alpine boots, I am willing to put up with they annoyance of Marker Dukes (or, I take my FKS and plan to set a bootpack).  Salomon Guardians may have the edge here, but I haven't spent enough time in them to say that for sure.    Lastly, you may wonder how many pairs of skis I have...  The answer is a very reasonable 3 pairs - light touring skis, inbounds killers, and powder boards.  I run Binding Freedom inserts and Binding Freedom plates which allows me a lot of flexibility in binding choice."
skiing,3c53f2,CaCoD,2,Tue Jul 7 06:27:35 2015 UTC,"I like your preferences.. You talking about these (15 din is enough for me)?  http://imgur.com/9DxVaU4  One of the arms of the original heels got completely mangled, so I've been keeping half an eye open for a pair of 14 din heels for cheap to pair them with.  And to completely binding nerd out:  Somehow the 916 and STH16 steel both have more toe height adjustment than the 997 and 900s (I would presume 957, et al have less travel as well). Obviously not enough to matter when used appropriately, but some AT boots fit in one but not the other. For a short period of time, I was stuck skiing BD quadrants inbounds - it fits into a 916/STH16 steel, but not a 900s or 997.  One other work around re:toe height with the fks toe is to grind the sole of the boot down to fit. I know at least a couple of the tecnica guys did this to their cochise to use the CAST system w/ fks. Not ideal, but none of these fixes really are.  I am not a fan of the guardian, but all frame bindings suck. I broke both toe pieces my first pair within 6 days. Had pre-release problems at the heel too. I have a few days on my warranty pair and still have pre-release issues at the heel with the din set +2 over what I run my 916s at.   I think we use pretty much the exact same bindings. All my inbounds alpine skis are mounted with fks or 916/997/etc, and radical ft or plum guide for touring. And the guardians that got donated to a basically community touring rig. You can see just how attached I am to that binding.  I recognized the handle from TGR. I like the subtlety in your mention of your use of the binding freedom plates and inserts ;). Which do kick ass btw."
skiing,3c53f2,jondrums,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:40:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not absolutely positive, but I think the 977 was an outlier with extra toe travel.  I only have one pair, but it has enough vertical travel in the toe to jam my dynafit rockered vibram sole boots - more travel than 916.  I still don't trust the release, so I only ski this very rarely."
skiing,3c53f2,CaCoD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:46:12 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's interesting. I haven't tried to cram an AT boot into a 977. But if you're able to jam a dynafit boot in there, it definitely must have a lot more travel than a 997 or 900s, both of which wouldn't fit a bd quadrant. Good to know I guess - Although hopefully I don't ever find myself having to do that, haha."
skiing,3c53f2,CaCoD,3,Thu Jul 9 12:47:21 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, you found the one response that actually wasn't totally fucking wrong. However, you are completely wrong.  The combination of elastic travel in the heel and the single pivot toe (yes, this doesn't include the p12 and 14, only the old 15 and 18), make for an extremely elastic set up, in multiple axis. If you've skied the sth2 or guardian, you would know that the heel is utterly hopeless compared to the fks heel.  Assuming the name isn't a coincidence, jondrums is probably by FAR one of the most well learned/educated people on this sub."
skiing,3c53f2,neatopat,-1,Mon Jul 6 02:13:42 2015 UTC,"Haha. He said they're the best bindings you can buy and the only reason he gave was that they have the most elastic travel, which they don't. That's not very well informed. The STH2's actually do and that heal peace was specificity designed to offer the most lateral support of any free ride binding. There are actually a number of big mountain pros who ride for other companies that insist on using the STH2 for that reason.    That being said, they are different bindings with a different intended purpose. The best tool is the right tool for the job, so it's kind of ignorant to say that one binding is the best binding for all skiers and all applications."
skiing,3c53f2,CaCoD,3,Mon Jul 6 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"Lateral rigidity comes from more than just the heel piece design, cmon man. Salomon may claim to have designed it to be the most laterally rigid binding, but without the data to back it up, this is all just marketing drivel as far as I'm concerned. That isn't to say they're wrong, but until someone proves otherwise, I'm hardly inclined to believe them.   Edit: Bit of an aside, but if you've ever taken apart an sth and an sth steel toe, I think its pretty apparent the steel variant should be more laterally rigid due to the materials used throughout.  My experience is that the fks and 916 platforms, in that order, have the most real world (ie, effective) elasticity. I have found minimal appreciable difference in lateral rigidity/response between the two.  As far as elastic travel, on paper/bench, the sth2 toe has the most elastic travel. The issue I have with the toe is I break them. The heel does NOT. I have major pre-release issues with that heel, on multiple pairs of bindings, even with the din +2 from usual. I don't with fks/916s; I think I've come out of a 916 heel once in the last 3 seasons. The one time I came out involved unintentionally launching off a cat track at 40+mph in flat light to an uphill landing, so it certainly hasn't been for a lack of trying.  I have no idea what actually is going on that causes this issue for me (no, its not snow under the boot or anything like that). I fully am ignorant as to exactly what makes this heel not work as intended for me. As I said, this is all anecdotal, and my experiences certainly aren't the absolute judgment on binding design.  This isn't meant as a rhetorical question at all, but what big mountain pro is choosing a plastic variant of the sth2 over an sth16 steel or p18? I'm simply unaware of anybody big mountain athlete that does this.  Out of curiosity, have you actually skied any of the bindings we are talking about (pivot with plastic toe, pivot with metal toe, guardian, sth 2, sth, sth steel/916, etc)?"
skiing,3c53f2,neatopat,0,Mon Jul 6 04:22:37 2015 UTC,"I know the STH2 heel has no elastic travel. It's not designed to. That's why I said they're different bindings with different intended benefits. JP Auclair was notable for only skiing Salomon bindings. I remember a sales rep reading a list of names, but I don't feel like researching right now.    I ski both STH12 and STH2-13. I don't know what you're talking about when you say steel. That's what the S in STH stands for and there are only two models currently of the STH2. The 13 and 16. Maybe you're thinking of the Z12 vs the STH12 which are basically identical except the STH has the steel housing? Anyways, I love both the bindings I have. Only other bindings I had that felt as solid were racing bindings. It's what I need for how I ski. I don't ski much park. I only ejected one time all season and it was from the toe when the tip of my ski caught a tree. I hail ass, drops, and have had my share of hard tumbles. No release issues at all. I have zero complaints and like I said, for how and what I ski it's what I need.    I've never skied pivots or fks. I know people who do. I know a lot of people really like them. That's why I haven't said anything bad about them. I did a lot of binding research last year and I heard of some troubles clicking in to the heal piece. I just like Salomon bindings better and I've never had any problems so that's what I'm sticking with for now.    I do know a huge percentage of people who buy fks/pivots only do so because of the myth that they will save you knees. And I hear about it all the time and it's annoying. Also the fact that they are kind of the go-to for park skiers and the cool bindings to have. Maybe they're great for that. I don't know. I've never ridden them and I don't really ski much park. That's why I told OP to do his own research and make his own decision. To many answers on here are anecdotal/mythical and not based on fact. I found out for myself researching bindings that what you find is mostly regurgitated sales pitched and misinformation from people who don't know what they're talking about or who suck at skiing and whatever binding they're using doesn't matter. You have to try to make sense of it all and try to figure out what's best for you. So like I said, to flat out say one binding is the best and that's it isn't very helpful."
skiing,3c53f2,CaCoD,3,Mon Jul 6 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"ALL alpine bindings have some elastic travel in the heel. This includes the STH and STH2.  The sth 16 steel was a re-release of the 916 (which was a repackaging of the 997, 900s line). Its an sth, but all metal toe and heel. Absolutely indestructible binding.   If you haven't skied any of the bindings aside from the sth/sth2, I don't understand why youre making all these claims that are simply factually incorrect. There are bindings that are objectively better than others, regardless of the purpose (not including touring obviously). Some will be more durable and offer better release characteristics. The experience of myself and others is that it is very difficult to beat the durability, performance, and release characteristics of the fks with metal toe and 916. Go look at what any of the athletes on the fwt are riding - the guys that push gear the hardest of any athletes, not including racers.  For 95% of skiers, none of this will matter. If you're psyched on the sth2, that's great! However, some claims you and others have presented as facts in this thread are just flat out wrong. That's all I'm trying to clear up. Its ironic you call people out for regurgitating sales pitches and spreading misinformation when its clear you are doing the same thing: you haven't skied these bindings but claim others are superior, are unaware of the existence of at least a couple (916, sth16 steel), and made ridiculous claims like ""the sth2 heel has no elastic travel"".

This is the STH steel. It is a fully steel binding with independent wing adjustments and at 2800g they are a good 600g heavier than an STH16. I think they are the most bombproof binding ever made.

Where the heel design is supposed to help is on backwards twisting falls. Not the most common fall but I've been told one of the most common in serious knee injuries. On those falls a traditional heel piece holds you in. The pivot heel piece rotates on those falls to let you out.  I had one of those falls last year and the pivot worked exactly as expected.  It sounds like some other people here have had prerelease issues. I haven't had a single problem.  They can be a little finicky and a pain to get back on when they get a bunch of snow in them. A minor inconvenience for a super solid binding.

I have found the biggest advantage to be the low weight. I feel the newer ones are less resilient but far and away this line of binding seems to be lighter than most bindings on the market which I love and has brought me back to them time and time again"
skiing,3c53f2,phillyfresh1990,-1,Sun Jul 5 01:31:39 2015 UTC,All bindings do the same thing. Pivot 14 is durable but they're kind of a pain to install and adjust.
skiing,3c53f2,neatopat,-3,Sun Jul 5 05:07:36 2015 UTC,"The heal piece pivots to allow you to eject your heal sideways just like your toe. It's just some marketing bullshit that doesn't work. The sales guy shouldn't have told you it would prevent an ACL injury because it's not true. A clear indication he has no idea what he's talking about. It's bio mechanically impossible since that's not how your knee works.   Try this. Stand up, lift one foot an inch or two above the ground, and rotate your foot with your knee. You'll notice your heal stays in place while the distal end of your foot (toes) rotate. This is why the toe piece of your binding releases sideways. Now try to keep your toes in place and rotate your heal. Your knee stays straight and the rotation comes from your hip. This is why your heal piece doesn't eject sideways.   They're popular bindings, mostly among park skiers. A lot of people like them. They won't save your knees. You will lose some lateral stability. A lot of other brands are beefing up their heal pieces because they're finding the added rigidity and stability is beneficial."

skiing,3c4tod,damprobot,4,Sat Jul 4 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to internet shop for boots.  I'm in the bay area as well, and my plan is to head up to Truckee to go to the Start Haus in the fall once they've got everything from the new season in.  The tradeoff is that this time of year prices will be low, but so will the selection- and boots aren't really something you want to make comprises with. I was @ Start Haus at the end of last season, and they only had a couple boots which would be appropriate for me. Out of those, only one kinda worked, but I bailed on it so I could wait until the stock was replenished. That being said, you could find something which works for you and get it at a great price if you get lucky.   I also can't recommend Start Haus enough. The 3 main other people I ski with have gotten fitted from there. When I was in fitting, everything about the operation made me feel comfortable. They look at how the boot sits flexed, unflexed, and while you're walking in it. They can punch, pull - whatever to modify the shell if needed. And Johnny Moseley was in there last time I was.   If you want to stay in the Bay then you could try California Ski Company in Berkeley- no personal experience, but some recommend them."
skiing,3c4tod,2Consigliere,0,Sat Jul 4 23:01:23 2015 UTC,"No idea about boot shopping in your area, and as I'm sure other people will say, every boot fits differently for every person.  That being said...  I was recently in a similar position as you regrading my style of skiing. I'm a race coach who spends more and more of my time hitting big off-piste stuff, so when I was getting new boots I needed something I could still carve with, but I could also wear and huck with all day without wanting to cut my feet off (hint: not race boots). I ended up getting the Lange RX series (120 for me, because they didn't have 130 at my bootfitter). They're stiff enough to carve, but have a soft rubber sole so you won't break your ankles hucking onto ice. No walk/ski mode, but I'm so used to walking/running/playing soccer in race boots that it doesn't matter.  They have the option for thermal fitting (or whatever it's called..), but the boot fitter told me that thermal fitting is basically just for tourists who ski two weekends a year. He said without fitting, after a month they'll pack into the shape of your foot anyway, and be better for it. He did give me some fancy insole though."

As far as i'm aware AU is mostly struggling and relying on snowmaking to keep trails. http://www.mountainwatch.com/ is a pretty good source of info regarding both Australia and NZ ski areas.   Plenty of sites can give you auto generated numbers but they do extended season outlooks and a handwritten forecast every day.

skiing,3c0x01,bitshifternz,2,Sat Jul 4 01:00:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, i tend to use http://snow-forecast.com for just raw numbers. Their long range forecasting (beyond a few days) can wildly vary but its often not too bad of a guide.  Eg heres the summary for victoria, you can see it shows Falls Creek's reported bases: http://www.snow-forecast.com/countries/Australia-Victoria/resorts  One thing to pay attention to is forecasting altitudes. Snow-forecast.com forecasts top, middle and bottom. Mountainwatch says above the forecast what altitude they are forecasting for eg falls creek is 1770m.  Of course these are all computer generated, so the more complex or unpredictable weather system gets, the more the algorithms struggle to estimate snowfall figures. Hence looking at multiple websites."

skiing,3by3pr,ItsFranklin,16,Fri Jul 3 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"There's no way to get a decent boot under $200. Boots are so important and honestly, right now you're just not good enough to commit to anything. You need to rent beginner equipment for a few more years. Many shops will rent you a beginner season package. After you've skied maybe 30 more days, you might be ready to buy something. When you do, since you're east coast, it will be a ski that's around 85mm underfoot.   But just a word about boots--beginners tend to go for a comfortable boot and often it's too loose fitting. As you get better, you'll understand why snug boots are so important. Boots need to respond to your subtle movements. I have wide but short feet (I'm female) and it was really hard finding a snug boot. Without custom insoles, they made my feet sore. And then I got them foamed so they'd last more than 2 seasons. With all the add-ons, they're coming to around $1000. No joke. But since I ski 45+ days a season, this is a necessity."
skiing,3by3pr,magicmarjie,26,Fri Jul 3 08:20:59 2015 UTC,"I've only ski'd 4 times in my life, however I can manage most black diamond hills.   You must not live out West. Where in the midwest or east do you live?   Looking to spend a maximum of $125 on the skis.   not going to happen"

skiing,3by3pr,paradigm99,7,Fri Jul 3 03:09:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, although they may be slightly wide because they're powder skis. The waist width is 100mm and anything 100 and above is generally considered to be a powder ski. For someone who has skied 4 times, they may be slightly more difficult to turn compared to a narrower ski."
skiing,3by3pr,paradigm99,2,Fri Jul 3 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"So I should be looking for frontside skis (less than 85mm wide), rocker/camber setup, and a soft flex? I tend to cut often and I prefer ""joyriding"" than straight down speed."
skiing,3by3pr,Musabi,12,Fri Jul 3 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"85mm with med flex probably wouldn't be bad but another option is renting skis for the season. You can rent for the whole season for around $125 and then after the season once you're better, you can buy better skis better suited to your ability and you'll probably have a better idea of what you're looking for. If I were you, I'd go with the rent option. If you buy skis now for like $200, you're only going to want to buy new and better skis for the next season."

I don't know how much it costs you to rent, but it might be better to just buy used skis. I would suggest old racing skis (slalom) to learn on. They'd be softer because they're used, but you'd still be able to pick up good carving technique (as opposed to fat skis, where you're never going to learn carving on those..)

skiing,3by3pr,SkiMonkey98,3,Fri Jul 3 12:37:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of places that I have lived in have ski swaps.  It is basically a swap meet/flea market type thing held around early to mid fall.  A lot of people go there to sell their old gear, and some retailers go there to sell their old (2-4 year old) stock or old rental gear.  I went to our ski swap last year to get my brother some ski gear and we got skis for $35 that were old rentals from a local lift area.  Poles for $10, and we also got him some boots for about $80.  Also keep a look out for deals that local shops run during the fall.  A lot of places will discount last years stock to make room for the latest equipment.  A lot of people say you have to spend over $200 to get boots, and that isn't really true IF you have a normal shaped foot.  You want to absolutely make sure that it is comfortable.  If you get one that feels good and is $100 then thats great!  But keep in mind any slight pressing or pinching will be 10x more painful after a 5-8 hour day skiing.  If you have super wide feet and high arches like me then you'll probably have to get an expensive pair of boots.  Also, a lot of ski shops have boot fitters that will adjust your boots for a fee.  So if you find you have some pinching on one of your boots don't dispair.  However they can only modify so much, so don't take that as an excuse to buy cheap but painful boots.  Going craigslist/used should be fine.  If you can, try to find old rentals.  They are usually well maintained ""middle of the road"" type skiis, which are great for beginners.  You will grow out of them in a few years probably, then you can think about getting a more dedicated ski that fits your style better."

skiing,3by3pr,mexicanwasabi,2,Fri Jul 3 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"You'r probably doing to want to invest more into the boots as well. You want to have the maximum amount of comfort possible along with responsiveness. An improperly fit boot calls for a ruined day/week/month/season. And to reiterate some of the responses here, 85-90mm will be a proper waist, with a softer flex so you don't have to be as aggressive sounds appropriate for you.   Then again what the fuck do I know, I'm your typical park rat."

skiing,3by3pr,upvizzle,2,Fri Jul 3 14:51:12 2015 UTC,If you are looking for gear then there is no better place then ski Swaps imo.

skiing,3by3pr,Square_Rooted,2,Fri Jul 3 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience, you can find skis (and bindings) second hand for your price range. The boots are significantly more tricky to get cheap, but you never know, you may get lucky and find a pair that fit well and are cheap.  I recommend seeing a boot fitter anyways, but be prepared to spend quite a bit more than $200. Boots are the most important bit of ski gear and you want a pair that fit really well.  I can't recommend committing to gear so early but if you really want to, I wish you good luck in your hunt."
skiing,3by3pr,upvizzle,3,Tue Jul 7 17:57:17 2015 UTC,"Ski'd 4 times in my life.... ""manage""   Careful out there dude, I hope by manage you don't mean simply making it down alive, it's about making it safe for other people around you too. Anyway, with my OSH speech over.  There's little chance you're getting good edge performance out of your ski's given how inexperienced you are, not trying to sound like a dick just trying to help you pick a ski. With that in mind you're gonna want a more forgiving ski that doesn't punish you for poor technique and isn't gonna have you catching edges where-ever you go.   80-90mm range underfoot width is what you'll be looking for. The length of ski for your height will be the 175+ with 178mm - 183mm probably perfect for you. You won't need bindings with a DIN higher than 12, I'd recommend rocking a DIN of 7-8 if you weigh 190 pounds.   Turning radius, won't mean that much to you since you probably aren't going to be riding your edges very well for a long time. But I'd go with something less aggressive, say 22m-30m.   If you're gonna go powder hounding get something with a bit of footing in the front, up to 110mm and something similar in the back.   Summarize:  *Tip: 105-115mm *Underfoot: 80-90mm (best 85+) *Tail: 100mm-110mm *Radius: 22m+ *DIN: 7-8   Check second hand ski sales for something cheap, if you live in the states its possible to find some real bargains, but still you are being super tight with funds good chance second hand skis will have been ground down and have almost no edges left or a bad patch job etc....  Good luck and be safe out there."
skiing,3by3pr,jibbindas8,5,Fri Jul 3 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"22m-30m is not 'less aggressive' that is a huge radius, almost world cup super G sized...smaller radius is less aggressive not bigger. Finding a ski that has a 22m+ radius that's 175cm would result in a ski no human could bend.   your tip-wist-tail dimensions are correct more or less, a ski in those dimensions will have a 15-18m radius @ 175cm"
skiing,3by3pr,Check_the_shrek,0,Fri Jul 3 17:36:05 2015 UTC,The whole point I'm making here is that 80% of people out there these days don't even need to worry about turning radius because they don't ski using their edges. I've noticed a trend with new skiers buying fatter skis because they find it much easier to slide their turns as they have no edge control.   Go put a new skier on a pair of race tigers with a radius of 12.8m they'll get the shit best out of them on those. Soon as they pick up and edge they are going to spill.

In Akureyri (next largest city, in the north of Iceland) the local mountain has snow blowers and fairly steady good conditions for skiing.   Mountain skiing on the west fjords is also really popular.   But if you come here in the winter, bring head torches. In December the sun rises at 12.00 sets at 15.00.

I do this every year, I got cold two years ago in sept in Saas-Fee but in Tignes around this time of year, its usually lovely and I assume it'll be similar in les deux alps.  I go in a light long sleeved top, long hiking trousers with no insulation and light gloves. You might be a little cold right at the start but trust me, you'll be warm soon enough.

skiing,3bmrbn,Neuronless,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"In Isère (Grenoble) there is Sept-Laux, L'Alpe D'huez, Chamrousse, les Deux Alpes...  If you go to Savoie, les Arcs (2000) is really good, La plagne, Courchevel (very pricey if you're not a Russian oligarch)...  And if you go as far as Haute-savoie, my personnal favorite is la Clusaz (2h from lyon) or Le Grand Bornand (right next to La Clusaz).  There are navettes (small buses?) leaving from Lyon during the season, to most of these resorts, with all inclusive packages, they are relatively cheap but you need to show up really early!"

skiing,3bmrbn,Neuronless,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:04:50 2015 UTC,Never had this problem there but I'm not surprised... A lot of resorts will do that.  I like looking at the Webcams online and checking third party websites for snow height before planning my day... But there's always a risk alas
skiing,3bmrbn,holtby45,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"I think /u/neuronless has it there really.  I don't like to go much further than 2 hours for a day trip but that still opens up a huge amount of options.  Lots of resorts for 30 euros per day.  One of my favourites is l'alpe d'heuz (though that isn't 30 eur per day).  Also, there are trips with Skimania where you're collected from the city centre early, taken out for the day by coach and brought back in the evening.  It's early starts and the choice of resorts isn't huge, but the price is transport/pass included and works out cheaper for some."

skiing,3bliq9,Drrizzit,33,Tue Jun 30 04:53:39 2015 UTC,Hey not to stick my nose in where it doesn't belong but your first investment should be an Avy class.
skiing,3bliq9,embrasse-moi_bien,3,Tue Jun 30 12:39:09 2015 UTC,Yes. And make sure your friends that you go with have done one too.
skiing,3bliq9,Just-givener,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I took an avy 1 course after several seasons of backcountry skiing. I thought it would just be basic information that I had already learned from friends and experience, and it covered all of that, but it was so much more. I learned a lot and it was incredibly valuable."

skiing,3bliq9,DoktorStrangelove,4,Wed Jul 1 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"No, those free avy classes are just intros to the concept and are not by any means sufficient.  There are no free aiare level 1 classes."
skiing,3bliq9,paradigm99,24,Wed Jul 1 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah put some AT bindings on the Shamans.  I love my shamans with Fritschi freerides, although they are a bit heavy.  Research different AT bindings and tech bindings and pick what you like. Using snowshoes and hiking with skis on your pack will make you hate life.  Be sure to take an AIARE Level 1 course!! Colorado has the most dangerous, scariest snowpack in the country and leads in avalanche deaths every year.  I lost a good friend and backcountry partner a year and a half ago."

skiing,3bliq9,loungin,6,Tue Jun 30 13:29:22 2015 UTC,"Take an AIARE 1 course! Take it with your friends if they havn't either. It's awesome: you get to learn about avalanches, managing risk, and get a tour or two to boot. It is WELL worth the investment.  Hidden Valley in RMNP is a good spot for a quick and easy day trip. Easy parking, short hike, not as committing as a lot of other stuff."
skiing,3bliq9,DmoneyMC,4,Tue Jun 30 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"Alright here's the low down-  Take a mother fucking avalanche course.  The mountains have an extraordinary ability to provide mass amounts of happiness, and mass amounts of sorrow.  Do not become the headline of CAIC and the Denver Post by throwing caution into the wind.  Here's a link to get you that certificate you NEED. http://coloradomountainschool.com/courses/aiare-level-1/  With the above in mind, always check the avalanche report before going out.  Learn to spot potential hazards in the snowpack like wind loading, facets, various storm cycles, etc...  Learn the proper etiquette in the backcountry.  Don't traverse above other people, give heed to those who were there before you, and most importantly always be prepared to help in case of an emergency.  Know how to use your tools efficiently when situations are tight.  Practicing with your beacon in designated areas, or even in your backyard, are invaluable practice for when shit hits the fan.  Finally, try to get your foot in the door by skiing popular areas that are close to the road, like the East side of Loveland Pass, East side of Vail pass (away from the sleds), and just wandering around the woods.  Learn the basics of what is going on, and observe what the snow is doing.  P.S.-  If you're asking about whether or not you should get AT bindings, you're probably not qualified to be trotting around in the backcountry."

skiing,3bliq9,RNAPII,3,Tue Jun 30 13:46:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't skip on the pass.  Sometimes you don't want to devote that much time and energy to skiing and just want to take a lift for a few runs.    Take your avy course before you just learn from a friend.  Snowshoes blow, Either get a whole new setup or replace yours with AT bindings.  You might as well just get a separate AT setup.  It's more expensive but you'll be glad in the end."
skiing,3bliq9,statmarker,6,Tue Jun 30 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"Don't you guys have foolishly cheap passes down there? Tbh I think it might be unwise to skip out on a pass because touring is pretty challenging and physically demanding, and at times where it's too dangerous to go or you just want the immediate gratification of a high speed quad, you will really miss that seasons pass."
skiing,3bliq9,DoktorStrangelove,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"We do, and it is being foolish. BC is sweet, but it's a supplement for me, not the only thing. It's super nice to ski a storm day at a resort knowing that the next couple days in the backcountry (taking avy safety into account) will be completely untouched.  HOWEVER, if it's his first year I understand. He's gonna have to essentially gear up from scratch, so financially it could be an either/or situation for him."
skiing,3bliq9,username_obnoxious,2,Wed Jul 1 03:26:31 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like a bum out, but have you done any backcountry skiing? Booting laps on a pass? There's a lot involved beyond just skiing and it might be a good idea to dabble before you dive in and drop almost a grand on some BC gear. Skipping on a pass might seem like a good idea, but there's going to be days when you want to get out and shred some storm pow but it's just not safe and might not be safe for a week at a time.   That being said, skip snowshoes and get dynafit bindings and skins. And a transceiver, probe and beacon and an avy course."

It's much more fun to ride without worrying about equipment.  I used to be very careful with skis but now I figure skis are supposed to be ridden and there is almost no damage that cannot be repaired easily (except really badly ripped out edges).  Unless you race, repaired core shots and dings will have no effect on ski performance."

I wasn't even mad, the level of fun you have goes way up when you stop caring about how they look.  It's like having a clean, unscratched mountain bike or an off-road truck that looks like it just rolled off the lot.

Also how to reattach? Thanks!"
skiing,3bjz9v,RicketyRasputin,2,Tue Jul 7 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on the pole. Older poles will typically have the handle just friction fit onto the stick (with maybe some glue), in which can you can use a wooden mallet (or a hammer and a block of wood) to knock the handle off by hitting it at the base. Then you can saw the pole down to size, and mallet the handle back on (with some contact cement if you're sure you got the length right).  If the handles have screws at the top, undo those and the handle should come off. If not, undo them and proceed as above. Don't cut at the base of the handle though, otherwise you'll never get the chunk of wood out.  If you're still unsure, send me a picture of the poles and maybe I can help more. Good luck!"

skiing,3bgaeh,ask1987,2,Sun Jun 28 23:35:59 2015 UTC,"I have.  I liked taking them out when conditions were great, not so much for variable snow.  The flat tails didn't release as smooth in the turns and if you were in wetter snow it would catch and give constantly.  No worried about burying the tips, but that also meant they were prone to get deflected.  It was my second favorite ski in our lineup that year behind the Volkl Katana.  Plenty of float."
skiing,3bgaeh,Squirrel_Whisperer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:14:39 2015 UTC,What made you prefer the Katana?
skiing,3bgaeh,Squirrel_Whisperer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"I ski more aggressively and have stiffer boots (you want to match stiffness in skis and boots).  I also prefer a wider turn radius.  The (old metal) Katana was a bruiser of a ski that could plow through anything.  It took more effort to get them around in tight areas but you knew they weren't going to give out on you.  Often you hear people claiming their skis are stiff chargers, but they aren't.  Their ski might just be stiffer than the marshmallows that they used to ski on.  The LibTECH POWnas is a similar stiff, flatter ski.  Blizzards hired on a high ranking Volkl employee and that is why over the past few years they are also producing stiffer skis.  The Sidestash was an easier ski.  You could cruise around with less effort but it didn't perform as well.  Volkls require that you ski them or they will take you for more of a ride.  It is why people who go Volkl tend to stick with the brand.    I guess you see a pair for sale somewhere and are wanting to know if you should pull the trigger.  What price are they?  What is your budget?  I really like the Scott Punisher.  Playful while still being pretty rigid and confidence inspiring."
skiing,3bgaeh,Gotta_Gett,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"My dad uses his sidestashes when he needs a lighter ski for on mountain powder or longer climbs. He really likes them, but has a whole quiver at his disposal. I always used his old skis in college since I was racing, but now that I have a real job and free skiing a lot more, I got a pair of Annex 118. From what I understand about the K2 product line, the Annex 118 are the next width option after 108. I have really enjoyed the Annex. They ski really well in powder and crud compared to the older 98 under foot salomons I had. The annex are tip and tail rocker, but regular camber underfoot which I prefer. I like the extra control and pop that having camber gives you especially in rougher east coast snow. If you haven't looked at them yet, I would. The only time I wish they were narrower was in the spring. They are a big unwieldy in moguls and slush."
skiing,3bgaeh,sweeza,0,Mon Jun 29 19:25:28 2015 UTC,"Head quite a few good things about the Side Stash, albeit if you want some skis that are good everywhere I would suggest either Black Crow Atri or if you want some K2 skis, go for the Line Sir Francis Bacon skis(Line is owned by K2)"
skiing,3bgaeh,RNAPII,3,Mon Jun 29 09:18:04 2015 UTC,"Just because Line is owned by K2 and shares manufacturing doesn't mean they are the same.  Line skis certain aren't ""pretty much a K2 ski"".  It's not just a rebranding.    K2 also owns volkl and olin skis.  They also own Morrow, 5150, RIDE,  and Liquid which are snowboarding companies.  They also make bikes and roller skates.  They also (at least used to) make fishing poles.    If you want to see something crazy, go look up how many snowboarding companies Burton owns."

A strong El Niño event translates to unseasonably warm winters - that's what we just had, the shitty winter we just skied was thanks to El Niño.  What we had 2009 to 2011 was a fairly strong La Nina event, that brought the snow, the powder, the cold and the heavy rains.  What your friend was describing is when a strong El Niño gives way to a strong La Nina the following year (common).  That's what we can hope for, but - these are very hard to predict and we will have to see which cycle we are in come fall.

skiing,3bbofr,shradicalwyo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"Super Pass and Epic are both great passes (variants are also great). I usually go with whatever is the 'pass to get' or what most of my buds go for that year. If you can't decide, just pick one, you'll love it, and you can always try the other the next year."
skiing,3bbofr,Primus32,2,Sat Jun 27 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"I've gotten the super pass plus for the last few years because I can't stand the I-70 grind and winter park is pretty much the best way to get off of I-70 ASAP. You get WP, copper, and steamboat, the 3 best (in my opinion) resorts on the front range."
skiing,3bbofr,RAKE_IN_THE_RAPE,4,Sun Jun 28 02:50:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly you can't go wrong with either, there's a lot of variety here...although coming from Jackson you might be disappointed in some of what we've got. Nothing really skis like Jackson. Parts of Aspen Highlands, Telluride, and Mary Jane are kinda similar, but MJ is the only one of those that's very close. In general I think you'll be kinda surprised at how ""flat"" everything here is compared to JHole.   Your best chance to avoid crowds will be the Super Pass, but the Epic Local might be a more convenient idea for you.   I would seriously consider doing an Epic Local combined with a Loveland pass of some kind, that'd give you a lot of decent options fairly close to Boulder...or just get the Loveland one and ski a few of the other places on day passes as you go, just to get an idea of what you like.   Edit: ok I'm at -2 right now, so since I'm genuinely trying to be helpful, I'll tell you why I think I'm being downvoted. There are two kinds of people who ski the Super Pass...people who think more people should get one too, therefore they disparage anyone who recommends the Epic Pass in even a lukewarm way, and people who think places like Copper and WP are some big fucking secret that nobody will ever find out about if they give dickish anti-advice to people who are asking for help choosing a pass.  Seriously, distance-wise there is more stuff close to you on the Epic Local. Then you'd probably have more fun at MJ but also have a hard time getting the most out of a RMSP because the other mountains aren't as convenient to Boulder. I'd just flip a coin and go for one, then try the other one the following season."

skiing,3bbofr,KnightOfCamelot,-2,Sat Jun 27 21:10:48 2015 UTC,Wait wait wait. If you park on the Jane side you can basically always get parking. And most of the time you can ski to your car. I've literally never had a problem finding parking at Mary Jane.
skiing,3bbofr,RAKE_IN_THE_RAPE,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:52:06 2015 UTC,"I'm personally a fan of the Super Pass. Winter Park's Mary Jane side is fantastic for tree runs, and Copper's back bowls have some nice cliffs. Both usually also have shorter lines at the lifts too. That being said, I also like the Epic Local too since it gets you to so many mountains."

Enough fun terrain to keep you happy for 2 hours, maybe 3 on a pow day - anything more and you can get bored. The super pass plus includes unlimited Eldora.

Days with some of the best conditions in years, where I was expecting huge lift lines, were practically empty. Not that I'm complaining about not waiting in lines, but I don't want to see local ski related business going under either.   IDK if it was the colder weather or crappy driving conditions but every time I went out, crowds were a lot smaller than I expected."

skiing,3b0csh,marijuanatablet,2,Thu Jun 25 18:37:01 2015 UTC,So the early bird ($49 CAD) and the $60 CAD are actually the same thing. Early bird is limited to the first 100 at a discounted price. You get to choose your size for both options! Thanks for your support!

They've done a good job dividing labor and assets holdings (rental property) to make it seem like the resorts are just scrapping by. They've also been able to keep wages significantly lower by using seasonal, international workers and laying everyone off in summer. The lake resorts in MN do it to. They basically hire high schoolers and some people in college but don't want people making a career out of it."

skiing,3au9ko,that_tech_guy,0,Wed Jun 24 00:44:39 2015 UTC,"The one thing that always concerns me about minimum wage hikes is how this devalues the work of everyone else at higher pay grades. If I'm making $15/hr or something as a skilled employee and a ticket scanner is now making $15, you bet your ass I want played $22 now because I'm worth it. Pay hikes across the board end up putting a nice dent in the economy."
skiing,3au9ko,kidgetajob,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily agree that pay hikes across the board put a dent in the economy.  These pay hikes are really only for hourly employees and most of these people are not going to save the extra 2 or 5 dollars an hour they make.  They will probably spend slightly more on groceries, at the bar, on take out, in restaurants or on gear. I completely agree that it devalues the work other people do and that every other hourly employee will want a pay bump.  I do not see how Vail Resorts paying their lowest paid employees 20%-30% more puts a dent in the economy, if anything it strengthens it."
skiing,3au9ko,thatgeekinit,2,Wed Jun 24 12:36:30 2015 UTC,"Just the opposite actually. The lower your income, the higher % of your income you spend immediately. That helps the economy because it is 70% consumer spending.  Minimum wage increases push wages up across the board at least on the low end. If you are making $2 over minimum now and the minimum rises $2, you should almost certainly fight for a raise.   The only ""negative"" impact is that a small group of workers who actually can't produce enough to be worth minimum wage get excluded from the work force. However when you consider that wages have fallen as a share of revenue and corporate profits are way up, most low wage workers make plenty of profit for their employers.    Yes, ski resorts are basically all about selling real estate and all that other stuff is alleged to be break-even but you can't sell all that real estate in the middle of nowhere without a ski resort so the only thing break-even about running a ski resort is in the accounting that lets you shift the profitable parts of the business into the real estate deals while keeping the costs on the resort side."

skiing,3avtvj,rschoey17,3,Tue Jun 23 22:23:47 2015 UTC,I was in Wengen this year for skiing. I left before the actual race but I saw all the preparations and the training session for the downhill race. It was interesting to see and there was already a crowd cheering for the racers. You could basically ski nearby the track to get to all the viewpoints (the most popular viewpoint is the Hundschopf). The training was for free fortunately.
skiing,3avtvj,nonzero_,2,Thu Jun 25 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"I was at the men's/women's GS in Sölden a couple years ago. It was funny cos if you just went up to watch the race, you had to pay some amount of euros to take the mountain road up to the resort, which got you access to the finishing area. If you bought a lift ticket you got to take the road up for free, got to ski all day, got access to the finishing area, and you could also watch the race from along side the course (this was a bit sub-optimal though, cos the safety fences blocked the view a bit).   Overall it was a great couple days. Big party at the end, lots of people, people got really drunk and did silly stuff (mostly dudes dancing around with their shirts off and stuff). If you didn't want to party, you could just go up for a couple more runs. After everything was done you could get onto the course (gates gone, of course) and see how crazy iced-up the run is."
skiing,3avtvj,gonoherposyphalaids,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:54:12 2015 UTC,I'm a bit of a budget so I wasn't planning on skiing there.

skiing,3avtvj,gonoherposyphalaids,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:07:52 2015 UTC,"A standing-room ticket with shuttle is 18€. A seat with shuttle is 45€. An early-season lift ticket is 49€ (Sölden's GS is in October) which gets you slope-side standing access (probably a better view than most of the seats, which just catch the end of the run anyway and you end up watching most of the race on the TV screens). But check the prices at Adelboden if that's where you're going."

It was a very laid back venue, you could walk up next to the course and camp out, party in the finish arena and see a lot of the women once they were done with their races. I haven't been to Adelboden, but since it's a bigger venue there may be more restrictions. All in all I would recommend going if you love ski racing and the culture behind it in Europe."

Even seasons when everything else is icy, runs like ""La Belle/La Bete"", ""La Yahoo"" or any of the glades of off La Crete (nicknamed the Black Forest). All these runs are glades, however there are some good runs that are steep or have moguls such as ""La S/ Super S"". In conclusion, the snow at first sight might be a bit off (icy, or grainy) but if you go for the less used trails you'll find some quality snow. Hope this helps."

skiing,3as2bt,Snubsurface,6,Tue Jun 23 01:31:53 2015 UTC,"I really have no idea what I'm talking about, but my first thought is; shouldn't your first step be patenting the designs?   These are some pretty big claims to be making without providing anything to back it up. I think if you actually had the data and evidence to support your claims manufacturers like Doppelmeyer and Poma would be interested. I'd be surprised if everything you're saying is true though - for example I've been on lifts that have directional changes (at least how I interpret it from your descriptions)."
skiing,3as2bt,Maladjusted_vagabond,-3,Tue Jun 23 03:37:07 2015 UTC,"I just thought of it yesterday, and have made notes.   It's actually so simple I could make it working model out of Legos, but I haven't considered the whole process of staking my claim.  Probably the first step is getting a good NDA, then refining it bit with some help once so it patents easily.  And as concerns directional changes more like a train switching yard, but low no power involved. Individual cats could start from one base station and be set at the base for different destinations, branching from multiple points. Passenger cars can travel to any station connected to the switching point. If a resort has multiple mountain base stations connected by bus, as some do, passengers could get on and request a destination and travel by lift instead.   The only limitation is that only one car travels a span at a time. Cars and multiple seat benches could carry higher numbers of passengers and speed can be be quite fast."
skiing,3as2bt,111l,2,Tue Jun 23 03:58:26 2015 UTC,"Here are the big difficulties that I see:      You think that it will be cheaper and safer than existing designs. ""They"" are not going to agree based on a Lego model. You would need it to be reviewed by a professional engineer, who will do calculations on how big the support structures need to be based on various sorts of loadings (wind, snow, etc); what the estimated maintenance costs are; etc. That's not cheap. For instance, say you have 100 chairs * 1/2 the chairs are full at a time * 4 people/chair * 100 kg/person * 487m vertical rise * 9.8 m/s2 / 4.5 minutes is about 475 horsepower necessary to do work on the skiers (so that's before thinking about losses). That lift (Santiago Express at Keystone) is reported to have 700 horsepower. Nothing says that they have to use 700 horsepower all the time. This doesn't strike me as a target for significant energy savings. Staying with that lift, it serves 2800 skiers/hr. With one car on the span at a time (so one leaves every 4.5 minutes), you get 14/hr at a speed a bit over 5m/s, so you need 200 people per car to match the capacity. That's a lot. And it makes the switching point less useful because it's harder to get 200 people to agree on a destination. You can make spans shorter by adding more switching points along the way, which increases your rate of departure but now your simple system is getting complex. Assuming that everything else works, it doesn't just need to be better than the existing technology, it needs to blow it away. If I'm building a new lift, I expect Poma or Doppelmayr to be able to do it on-schedule and on-budget. They've been doing it for years, so there should be very few surprises. Then my existing mechanics, tools, and spare parts are likely to transfer to the new lift. If you introduce a new technology, I get none of that.   Good luck, but remember that ideas are cheap, it is follow-through that makes a difference."
skiing,3as2bt,Datnewraaaaaandy,0,Tue Jun 23 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, great info!  Please see my response to paradigm99 above, I covered a lot of my thoughts.  In response to your points:  I expect to be laughed out of the room the first time I show this, they've been making super lifts forever, what do I know?  I thought  about this, because each chair can only carry so many people, so your example lift is like Mt. Everest.  I can launch multiple chairs on separate cable crawlers at the same time going to various locations.  Motive power gets larger, but, could also be achieved with a modular design, where multiple flywheel modules are ganged instead of upsizing one unit. Spare units can be ganged, but disconnected for immediate switchover in case of breakdown and at servicing intervals. Lift never needs to be out of service. Rotational forces can be  compensated for by pairing counter rotating flywheels.  I have already considered several capabilities and features of the design as currently envisioned which will appeal to different audiences.   It will be unique, at first.   It will have a smooth ride and as near to comparable capacity and load rate  of the Mt. Everest lift you sited as possible, but perhaps not in the first iteration.  It will be a low down-time system.  It will be Eco friendly, in choice of materials where possible, in using simple, reconditionable parts, rather than just disposable or recyclable. It will create no electric fields and present no electrocution hazard.   Since it can be driven sideways, or transition to a vertical climbing/ descending ladder-climbing carriage anywhere in line, some lift lines can be designed as theme park rides, complete with animatronic dinosaurs and such.  The  lifts can be adjusted to provide more of a thrill ride effect, with jerking and swinging designed into the the support transfer paths rather than into cable sections. These  theme park rides could simply be one hop from the base station, and then a meandering gravity slide (which, by the way adds energy to the system) similar to the Ninja suspended roller coaster, but not as fast, this ain't Six Flags.   Now it's not just a ski resort it's a Theme Park.  I will be making a working model, I can't not.   There are many, many more ideas to be considered."

skiing,3as2bt,Jodiug,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:29:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you are sincere, but I have considered that off season use of ski lifts to perform other tasks, such as mildly thrilling theme park style rides could be easily realized by directing passenger cars along special routes. It doesn't  just have to haul mountain bikers, a slight incline after the selected height has been reached  and now you can hide animatronic dinosaurs in the woods, etc.   The thrill rides are only meant for a downhill trip, I wouldn't like a longer trip when the goal is skiing.  My idea would allow for routes to include vertical climbing and descending, including negotiating overhangs and obstacles, which could be entertaining.  Ride features, other than the lift system itself could be powered by the energy from the lift system, and then, during ski season, disconnected and put in a shed."
skiing,3as2bt,TongueDartTheFartB0x,5,Thu Jun 25 06:15:40 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest it sounds like you are selling me on the jabberwocky project right now.  I have a bit of skepticism mainly because I'm electrical engineer with a power systems background and I'm used to people trying to tell me how they solved the energy crisis by ignoring the conservation of energy or something like that (not quite the same but people's brilliant solutions sometimes come from ignoring how things really work.)  However, if you really are serious the first place to start would be documenting your invention.  The next thing you should be concerned about is viability. Will this actually be wanted and does it take in to consideration of everything. Viability is the most important part of an invention. Patenting is actually one of last steps you should take. You risk creating patents too narrow or broad in scope if your idea isn't completely fleshed out. If the scope is too narrow you can be easily bypassed. For example if your patent specifies widget a and another company finds widget b works just as well did they violate your patent? It would be a difficult process, maybe will be riding lifts by snubsurface in the near future.  I should also state I'm not an expert on intellectual property and you might just want want to ask a different sub about intellectual property and get acquainted with the topic."
skiing,3as2bt,neatopat,0,Tue Jun 23 16:59:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, it was helpful.   With further consideration the it he idea is to have lighter weight but stronger cars that are unpowered and have no electrical features, and provide motive power from the base via a non- load bearing circulating cable  spinning flywheels  on each tower engage the drive train on the travelers which carry the cars from support to support.   A lesser quantity of energy can be scavenged by the much lighter cars on the downhill trip, but enough to make it worth collecting.   No point in converting to electricity if it's just about slinging a bucket from hand to hand."
skiing,3as2bt,neatopat,2,Tue Jun 23 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"Talk to someone you know and trust. If they know mechanics even better. Ask them what they think of your idea.  If it can really be built of lego, why not build it?  If it works as well as you say, gather some experimental evidence to support that. Write your ideas down and contact a patent office.  Take it to a lift manufacturer   Why these steps? It is so you can figure out what your idea is worth. No design is perfect from the beginning. Your description sounds like a ""silver bullet"" approach: people here have problems believing it without data or a prototype. If there is anything I know of engineering, it is never that simple. There are tradeoffs, and you have to be aware of the downsides if you're going to sell the idea. Just to give an example, does it still work in high winds? Can it take shrinking due to temps and does it work after heavy snowfall?  Maybe I'm wrong and your idea is perfect. But even if it is, my advice is don't get too far ahead of yourself, before you have something to show. Good luck! I look forward to riding one of these lifts in the future :)"

Get me up as fast and as direct as possible so I can ski more.    Also, have you seen the infrastructure at most resorts? A new lift is a huge investment which is why just about every resort has at least some shitty old lifts still in service. There are maybe a few resorts in the whole would who would be able to even consider revamping their lifts and it's most likely not worth it for the insignificant changes you're taking about. They may sound revolutionary in your head, but in reality lifts are currently considerably safe, don't get stuck that often and are easy to extract passengers if they do, no one cares about moving horizontally, and there is no need to change direction. What it sounds like you've found is a brilliant solution to a problem that doesn't exist."

skiing,3as2bt,NogMachine,0,Tue Jun 23 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"Supreme overconfidence and an active imagination, of course.  I cheerfully discard some claims and have refined some concepts, and think I see a different way of performing a task (getting load from point A to point B).  Suggestions and constructive insights and criticism is welcome, but I really only just started thinking about it 2 days ago, so the non-problem I am working on is just an exercise at the moment. An exercise in increasing the efficiency and functionality of an existing system with, what I expect would be, a reduced cost.  I think it would be less expensive to build a system that is under less strain and distributes the load more evenly. If carbon fiber is too expensive today, other materials can be used in a similar fashion to make a cheaper lighter but just as functional passenger car or chairlift.  I would think a system that scavenges energy from its natural tendency to roll down hill,  and then store that energy mechanically rather than converting to electricity, would be a cost savings.  I would think that two or more smaller support cables  for the load bearing carriages would provide stability, safety in the form of redundancy, and lower cost of cables, even though quantity increases.   I would think that simple maintenance of a simple set of devices that are designed, wherever possible, to be removed and replaced by hand would be a plus.  I think it would be less expensive, both initially and over time, if the equipment mounted on each support to enable the transition/hand-off from cart to support and back to carriage  had fewer moving parts that had a longer life cycle then, say, a whole bunch of rubber tires, like on a standard lift. it is still entirely mechanical, and is initiated by a rod extending from the front of the cart would initiate the safe handoff of the cart across the support and onto the next carriage. The extending rod, will also be the first to encounter any problems when an actuator does not depress, and prevent the car from being sent into an unsafe condition, either forward or back until the condition is cleared.  I haven't done my math, but I would suppose that the resistance presented by a non load bearing cable providing motive force would be less, requiring less energy to be used to start and keep it running, rather than having to spin up,  and continuously run the long cables with all the weight of the chairs and the people and the cable itself.  I don't know that traditional lifts incorporate any technology for recovering kinetic energy. If no, then how could this not add to the plus side of the ledger?   Some energy from the flywheel  at each or at certain supports can be dumped into an electrical system to run local any electrical services desired, with no direct connection to a power grid. That should present a savings. An oversized flywheel could provide power to  warming huts, etc., If so desired.   If by providing motive power  from the base station and then having a better transfer of that energy using less expensive and less dangerous materials, along its distribution path (without converting it to electricity and then back to physical working energy, and incurring the penalties), it seems this would present a savings, especially as energy is fed back into the system in the same form by the downhill actions.  Depending on weight bearing capacity desired for the system, which could be changed later, passenger carriages can be of various capacities and designs, as easily or more easily interchanged and even intermingled, as only one car travels a section at a time, so the balance of the system is less affected by load variations, or at least does not have to designed for as wide a tolerance  as  traditional system. This may or may not be seen as a savings, but it is novel.  Simple carriage designs can include be modified  as desired, and incremental improvements can be used to lure skiers back to take advantage of them as they are unveiled rather than giving them all at once. This is just marketing, but I've considered how best to maximize ROI over the lifetime of the system. This includes touting its eco-friendiness, smooth ride and novel operating system, ability to be sent to different locations without changing lifts, numerous safety features, etc., etc..  Every part and piece can be both improved in function and reduced in cost over time.   There is no pioneering research in the proposed system, as much as possible I thought of using existing non-proprietary technologies and materials. Low tech is a good option when space is not a consideration, no need to jam everything in a little box. The power train does have a lot of energy, and can be dangerous, although less dangerous than electrical distribution. The worst thing seems to be  a flywheel ripping it self apart and sending shards though any containment. I have thought of a possible safer self balancing flywheel design that will destroy itself, but be less likely to cause other damage. Safety is a plus, flywheel may be more or less expensive.  It's true, I do not know exactly how traditional ski lifts work, but is didn't want to think about one of those, I tried to serve the purpose in a different fashion.   I'm still thinking of it right now, and I think it is snazzy.   Every time  get on a lift (and I've been all over Aspen, California, some Utah), I marvel at them, and then always, always wonder if there is a better way. Especially when I get stuck for twenty minutes 70' up, in a really cold cloud, and I'm being whipped around. My system lets cars descend if they get stuck or there is a fault in the system.  I welcome your input."

The Porkies only has two lifts but has 787 vertical feet (which is a lot for Michigan).   Boyne Mountain and Nubs Nob aren't anything to write home about outside of Michigan, but they're probably the best hills in the lower peninsula after Boyne Highlands.  I know you're more interested in actual mountains but since you have Caberfae, Shanty Creek, and Crystal Mountain on here, leaving Nubs and Boyne off seems a little arbitrary (but I fully understand if you have a reason).  Nubs Nob is directly across the street from Boyne Highlands as well."

When you click on a mountain and then go back, you should tell google maps to 'remember' the zoom level and location you were at.  2).  It feels like the google map container is too small and makes it a bit harder to navigate around   3).  you should pull maps into your server, not hotlink them.

skiing,3apd6q,thatgeekinit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"I've been twice. Whistler is probably the most expensive ski resort area in North America. Vancouver is also one of the most expensive cities in North America. The Canadian dollar is pretty weak (or historically more normal now) ($1.00CAD = 0.81USD = 0.51GBP) so some of the bigger Colorado spots might be temporarily more expensive. If you are used to how much things cost in London, you probably won't be shocked by grocery shopping or bars/restaurants in Whistler but now that I've skied some other areas in Canada, there is definitely a 20% or so higher food cost in Whistler even compared to other BC ski areas.    I seldom found even a simple meal in Whistler that was under $20 CAD after taxes and tip.   In general, if you plan to buy a season pass, sooner is much much cheaper for US/CA resorts.   As to nightlife, Whistler has quite a few bars and restaurants in the village area and it always seems pretty lively to me even coming from a major US city. I've been there are the tail end of MLK week and there were tons of US college students up there and they probably party more than ski.  BC resorts in general are absolutely full of UK, Aus, NZ."
skiing,3apd6q,jesusman69,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:11:06 2015 UTC,So informative! Very much appreciated. Luckily I have a job so I can save up for next year.   Do you have any idea how much seasonaires go out there with?   Edit: how much do season passes usually go for?
skiing,3apd6q,thatgeekinit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:02:39 2015 UTC,how much do season passes usually go for?   umm...you could look on their website  DAMN thats expensive
skiing,3apd6q,thatgeekinit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"No idea, I've unfortunately never let my inner ski bum out for a whole season but I've been thinking about trying this year.  You should definitely consider expanding your search across more of Canada. There are a lot of awesome resorts, especially if you wouldn't mind being in a more remote area or smaller city than Whistler/Vancouver for the season.   I'd check the website for season pass prices. Looks like they are $1599 until Oct 12. Given the weak $CAD, that is not a bad deal when compared to many US passes although not the aggressively priced Epic Pass to Vail-owned resorts which is probably the best deal in skiing. It is also significantly more expensive than most of the smaller Canadian resorts. Revelstoke by example is $799 CAD for their early special with the biggest lift-served vertical on the continent (Whistler is #2 and #1 for acreage). Banf/Sunshine Village in Alberta is $979 right now and its closer to Calgary than Whistler is to Vancouver."
skiing,3apd6q,Datnewraaaaaandy,0,Mon Jun 22 21:14:19 2015 UTC,Good god that price made me cringe. Are the other resorts known for their nightlife? I've heard Banf is alright but I haven't heard too much about it
skiing,3apd6q,GianSeehra,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:23:01 2015 UTC,"I've never been to Banf but it is popular and I've seen some amazing pictures. It is supposedly about a one hour drive to Calgary so you are not too far in the middle of nowhere.  Nightlife at any western ski resort is not going to be at the level of London or NYC or Vegas or Berlin or SF by any stretch of the imagination. The big resorts are going to have some small ""clubs"" and lots of bars. The smaller resorts are going to have more friendly bars and probably some live music acts in-season.  Revelstoke actually had decent nightlife in town. I don't think there were any nightclubs but there are fun bars, an aquatic center, and a good microbrewery.  3 hours drive to Kelowna (pop 120k) but smaller cities can be very nice in Canada compared to their US equivalents. Absolutely laid back ski bum paradise IMHO.   Last year I did Red Mountain and Whitewater. Red had one bar on mountain a few other ones down the road in Rossland but it is a very small town. Whitewater is a short drive from Nelson which is a bigger town and had a few fun bars and more dining options."

skiing,3anmgm,HistoricalNazi,2,Tue Jun 23 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"ODESSA:       The ODESSA, from the German Organisation der Ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen, meaning “Organization of Former SS Members,” supposedly was an international Nazi network set up towards the end of World War II by a group of SS officers. The purpose of the ODESSA was purportedly to establish and facilitate secret escape routes, later known as ratlines, to allow SS members to avoid capture and prosecution for war crimes and to escape to Latin America or the Middle East.  The existence of the organisation is a matter of dispute. Books by T.H. Tetens and Joseph Wechsberg claim to have verified the organisation's existence and provided details of its operations. Wechsberg studied Simon Wiesenthal's memoirs on the ODESSA and correlated them with his own experiences in the book The Murderers Among Us. However, historian Guy Walters, in his book Hunting Evil, claimed he was unable to find any evidence of the existence of the organisation. Historian Daniel Stahl in 2011 says the consensus among historians is that ODESSA did not exist.  ODESSA is best known from its appearance in spy novels and fictional movies.

The thing about those caps is that for me personaly they are my dirty/work/fesitval caps so paying that much for something that will get used up fairly quickly is a little out of bounce. Is it the minimal cost you guys can provide at ?
skiing,3aqqjw,grumpywasatchskier,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"We are such a small brand, in a niche market, that we need to have our prices relatively high compared to competitors, as we don't have the same bargaining power of bigger brands. We believe that we're providing a better quality hat to the ones on the market, with designs that meet our customers interests. We want our customers to have fun with our cap, so if you get it a little dirty at a festival or mountain biking. We think it'll add character to the hat, and we want our caps to be filled with adventures.  Lastly, if the price of the hat is still too expensive, we suggest instead of going out on a Saturday night to grab some friends and enjoy the outdoors. I'm positive the cap will pay for itself. Hope I could answer all your questions.  A"

I used the commercial grade white tiles, and they worked out pretty well for a while, but the tiles I have in the compression are starting to break after ~3 years of sun exposure in the ol' back yard.  The tiles themselves are extremely fast, and offer a little bit of control (unlike turf,) but they're pretty rough/sharp and will tear up softer ski bases very quickly.

skiing,3acw63,smelgie,2,Fri Jun 19 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"Rent a house. Check VRBO or other similar sites. Should be lots to rent this far out. I would rent a car, as I'm assuming you will be flying in from Calgary anyways. Not all house rentals will be near the shuttle line, and you can get a better place in the gondola line if you want to leave earlier. Plus you can drive to Kicking Horse for the day, which I highly recommend.  Edit: Seconded for the Village Idiot as well. Great spot."
skiing,3acw63,ski_bum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:35:43 2015 UTC,"The ""this far out"" part always works best. Get it cemented in the calendar and then it's always easier to work the rest of work/life around it.  When we try to plan closer to the fact--above the reduced number of rentals--you always end up with people backing out because their schedule gets tight.    Rental car is sounding like a good idea. Especially for this first trip. If we have low snow, can always turn it into a tour and scout all the neighboring resorts. And if it's a great snow year, we won't really be thinking about the car sitting in the driveway even if we use the shutte, will we?  Thanks for the tips!"
skiing,3acw63,Poncherelo,2,Sat Jun 20 00:26:35 2015 UTC,I haven't been there yet but I have recently been in touch with Jeff (https://www.explore-share.com/countries/canada/activities/ski-touring/918-revelstokerogers-pass-ski-touring) to discuss the different possibilities to go on a ski tour with him. He is super nice and really willing to help ! Good luck !
skiing,3acw63,Poncherelo,2,Mon Jun 22 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link and the recommendation! I didn't know this existed!   The group is all high-level skiers and riders, but there's a rift between those who want to get more into touring and those who are happy just going to different mountains each year and staying inside the resort. I'm definitely on the touring side, but I'm not the one with the most experience. So I will be checking this out!"
skiing,3acw63,thatgeekinit,2,Thu Jun 25 23:25:11 2015 UTC,Whistler is a very good option for Backcountry skiing. You can go for the day or do a hut to hut traverse staying in very nice mountain lodges. There is also a lot of heliskiing there...but then it gets more expensive.
skiing,3acw63,thatgeekinit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"I may have to reconsider Whistler.  I've been a few (quite a few, actually) years ago but just resort skiing.

About 19 hours travel including some delays. The way back was 13 hours.   If you can fly out west to LA or something and take WestJet to Kelowna, that is probably better."
skiing,3acw63,Funkonomic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:44:25 2015 UTC,That could happen.  I'll check out some west coast stops.    Is it significantly better to fly into Kelowna than Calgary?  Obviously the drive time is shorter but I'm a bit concerned about weather conditions and multiple parties coming in on different flights.  Not that Calgary is particularly clear and sunny...

Is it worth it have a rental car for the week or is it easy enough to handle everything with walking and the shuttle once you're in town? Thanks!

skiing,3a9fva,StephenFly,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'm from Wanaka so I'm biased towards Treble Cone, even though most of my skiing has been in the North Island for the last few years. TC is awesome terrain is great, BC is wicked if you have touring gear. The resorts here are pretty small compared to what I've been to in North America and Europe so doing a campervan trip between a bunch of resorts will be your best bet to get more variety.   If you're starting in Christchurch, go to Mt Hutt for a bit (biggest in South Island) but try go mid week (gets packed on the weekends,) then make your way to Wanaka passing through some of the club fields - Craigieburn, Broken River and Ohau are good. When you get to Wanaka, try Treble Cone and perhaps Cardrona (pretty tame, comparatively.) Head over to Queenstown and try the Remarkables and Coronet Peak, remarks being the better of the two for off-piste.  What are your dates? I might be around the area if you want to go for a ski?"

skiing,39ycwa,RepDetec,16,Mon Jun 15 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"I am not affiliated with WB but I spend quite a bit of time up there through work (alpine race coach)  By chance I happened to ride up the t-bar with the glacier manager this past February and we spoke about the snow guns (after I joked about the idea of installing them).  The intent for this coming season is to install a few guns for testing purposes. If things pan out they will install 20+ guns along the ridge above the glacier which will continuously blow snow when the conditions allow. The resort estimates that it will take 20+ years of snow production to get the glacier back to 1990's levels.  Will a few guns make a difference? Not really, but they will allow for data collection.  Last summer was brutally hot which when combined with the low snow year resulted in an extremely thin cover of snow on the glacier - photo from summer camp. Beefing up the winter snow cover will benefit summer users and the glacier: the snow is far nicer to train on and it reflects way more sunlight which slows melting.  There are concerns: energy will be needed to pump water and run the guns (90% of BC's power comes from hydro) and the layers of dense man made snow will raise the risk of avalanches.  There are good snow years and bad snow years. The past two years have been exceptionally bad and the frequency of poor years seems to be increasing. Hopefully efforts like this will keep the resorts viable for future skiers and for people like me who's jobs rely on the snow!"

skiing,39ycwa,tmbrwolf,4,Fri Jun 19 12:34:41 2015 UTC,"I would imagine part of it comes down to keeping the snow white. As glaciers melt, all trapped gravel, silt, and sand starts to accumulate on the surface making the glacier darker. The darker it gets from the melting, the faster it melts. Im guessing, but I think part of the idea is to help top up the surface layer so you don't get the same degree of darkening. Not to mention modern snow guns can pump out lots of snow adding to the uphill side of the snowpack."

skiing,39ycwa,111l,2,Mon Jun 15 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"But if Whistler used less electricity, they could sell more of that hydro power to other users, who could then buy less coal. If they were partly responsible for developing that hydro, great! But that's no reason not to reduce energy use as well.  On the other hand, it sounds like this is a pilot project. It seems worth it just to answer the question ""will it work?"""
skiing,39ycwa,hangm4n,2,Tue Jun 16 02:34:31 2015 UTC,Whistler receiving less income due to closing the summer glacier service is the worst outcome for the mountain company and although they care about the environment the company is there to generate profit.

Between the two peaks theres something for everyone and more - with the goods really lying in the advanced/expert terrain. It can get crowded, especially during holiday periods, but last year was not nearly as bad as some of the years leading up to it. However, they are upgrading the old double to a quad as we speak, which will improve the base crowds dramatically starting next season.  Stowe has a great village and tons of bar/food offerings, not to mention lodging, but I personally love the quiet, true Vermont feel of the Mad River Valley."

skiing,39zirj,KustyTheKlown,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"first of all, this is vermont, not colorado. you can ski the mansfield sidecountry with no avalanche risk and it really isnt that irresponsible to go alone if you know where you are going. anything into the notch will eventually hit the road, and you wont be lost in the middle of nowhere.  and if youre in your 20s, the sugarbush pass will literally be $1000 less than a stowe pass. edit - just learned about the stowe for20s pass and now i am jealous.   and sugarbush will have a new valley house chair this coming season. and sugarbush is no slacker for sidecountry and off map options, with slide brook, and the paradise woods/church area offering fantastic hits  stowe has the advantage of that 7:30 AM start time.   either is a fine choice.  i ski about 35-40 days a year, with about 20 of those in vermont, but i like to spread it out among sugarbush, stowe, mad river, smugglers, and jay. so i dont buy an eastern pass. i do a la carte eastern skiing, gas station BOGO deals, liftopia, etc, and get an epic pass for the west  this year i got the max pass instead of the epic, mainly because it has eastern options and big sky has been on my bucket list anyway. while i dont love killington/pico/stratton, i'm not above using some freebie days there. and i'm very into the freebies at sugarloaf and sunday river. i'm planning on 5 days big sky, ~8 days copper/winter park, 5 days steamboat, 3 days sugarloaf, 3 days sunday river, 2 days killington, 2 days pico, 1 day stratton. will easily get my $700 worth. and then hit jay, mad, stowe, sugarbush, smuggs each at least once a la carte."

At that price you can't go wrong with Stowe.  The crowds are only ever bad from about 10AM-2PM and the lifts are so quick that you're never really waiting in line anyways.  Goat, National, Starr, Lookout, Bypass, and most of the woods are generally fairly empty even on the most crowded days.  The only lift I avoid regularly is the gondola because that line actually does build up more quickly than the others.  Also, Stowe's terrain is legit."

If they are fans of the band, cool, it shows some personality, and at the least I appreciate the deviation from the most common song types in edits."
skiing,39qiju,tc2k14,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:45:50 2015 UTC,"I am going to recommend the Scott Reverse over the Dynastar Powertrack 89 for a few reasons. I am the exact same size as you too. First, the Dynastar 89 has real skinny tails. For an on-piste hard snow ski you aren't riding switch, that's fine, but these are a little too skinny. For edge hold, especially with a ski with stiff tails like this, it will be a pain to get a full rounded turn on it. Second, a full wood core gives a ski a real soft ride. The Fynastars have the sandwiched wood with Titanal. Although I haven't ridden the 89, I have ridden this Titanal/wood sanwhich, and am not a fan. Real chattery, and have that slap band feeling to them when slapping over hard packed crud. Here is a review I thought was great: Dynastar 89 Review  Why I like the Reverse so much is their specific tapered design, small subtle rocker, super responsive from bumps to hard corduroy turns, comparable $400 price point. A phenomenal ski. Scott is extremely undervalued for their performance and quality. I ride the Punisher, and the old version of the Reverse, the P3. The Europeans love them. Go look up reviews. Here is one to start you off: Scott Reverse Review"

Compared to last year, we had plenty of accessories, multiple SD cards and batteries at our disposal, allowing us to film plenty of different angles.  Shot with GoPro Hero 3+ black.  Accessories used:   Helmet mount x2 50cm pole Bar mount (for skipole) Chest mount 2 SD cards (2x32 GB) 3 batteries   I used 2 batteries every day, on one day I used all 3 of em. I kept them together with the spare SD card in a tiny metal box in my jacket. My other pockets were all full of accessories, parts, connectors etc. I only lost one connector."

skiing,39n1z0,Undercover_Newb,10,Fri Jun 12 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"I would pick Revelstoke as my first choice skiing is some of the best in NA the mountain and snow is fantastic and reliable. Revelstoke never has terrible seasons they always get a good ammount of snow. As has some of the best heli and cat skiing ops in BC.  Kicking horse would be my second pick, probs my number 1 ski resort in NA when is has snow but it isn't as reliable.  Fernie would be my last pick, the mountain is great when it has snow but season are very hit and miss. The head walls offer some great skiing from the end of January, also has super easy access some great side country. If you will be ski touring then this bumps Fernie ahead of kicking horse.  Also depends on your situation if you will be working, your skiing ability, when you arrive into the resort etc."

skiing,39n1z0,Zebleblic,6,Sat Jun 13 19:14:21 2015 UTC,"I'd pick Revy for the skiing. Great terrain, lots of touring (Roger's Pass is real close) and usually a lot of snow. I personally loved Revy. The nightlife is alright but nothing compared to Fernie. Fernie's party scene was ridiculous the 2 seasons (2011-2012 ,2013-2014) I was there. Fernie has great skiing and an awesome community, but the snow the last few years have been a little hit or miss.   Haven't spent much time in Golden, however. Kicking Horse was awesome both times I skiied there, but I didn't spend much time there. Gnarly terrain. Very small town.  If you want to take it more mellow and ski crazy terrain, then Revelstoke no question. I had better ski days in Revy than Fernie. If you want to wild out a bit and have lots of fun, Fernie could be an option.  If this is your first time in BC, know this, you're in the powder triangle (Fernie, Nelson, Revy), no matter where you ski, it'll be awesome. All 3 towns are fairly close and if you're down to drive a bit, you'll never have a shitty day of skiing."

skiing,39n1z0,The_Gnar_Car,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:00:25 2015 UTC,"Contrary to others I'd say Golden gets better snow than revy, but just a tad less.

You're moving somewhere for the skiing not the town, and both Golden and revy are chock full great skiers to be friends with."
skiing,39n1z0,Tamagi0,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:10:52 2015 UTC,Kicking Horse for steeps and most advanced terrain. Revelstoke for quantity of snow over the season. Fernie for good local community and potential for legendary dumps (can be a little dry in between though).

skiing,39j1qk,nikodmus,10,Fri Jun 12 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of lifestyle you're trying to live. To some, ski bumming is just ski, eat, sleep, repeat. Others want to party and be immersed in ski town culture, which Salt Lake simply won't offer.  If cost is an issue, there's many ski towns out there that are substantially less expensive than Jackson and Teton Village. The property surrounding Jackson Hole is an extreme. Granted, Salt Lake will still be cheaper than a lot of ski towns, but there's a bunch that are a good middle ground."
skiing,39j1qk,catchphish,2,Fri Jun 12 05:13:52 2015 UTC,"Wait a second, did you say Salt Lake won't offer partying? There's way more to do in downtown SLC than in Park City in terms of nightlife. Maybe that was a problem 10 years ago but not anymore...  If you're talking about staying at Alta and expecting a rave... then no you're usually not going to get it."
skiing,39j1qk,ajfa,0,Fri Jun 12 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"(a) I know drinking culture is there in Salt Lake, but it's by no means a 'party city.' You still can't even get full strength beer on draft. I'm sure it's gradually changing, but the last time I was in town was March and it's still quite Mormon all over the place.  (b) Ski town culture is just different than any city. It's really not like living anywhere else. There might be more to do in SLC than Park City, but that's missing the point. Ski towns are about being somewhere immersed in a singular common objective: sending it as much as possible. Or maybe that's just my take. Either way, I think ski bumming in a city is selling yourself short, and that was my original point."
skiing,39j1qk,catchphish,2,Fri Jun 12 19:52:32 2015 UTC,"(a) You go downtown any night of the week and there are bars open, live music playing, and evening events. If anything, in the last 4 years especially Park City has felt sadder and more tired, and SLC has grown in the nightlife department. Not sure about Vail and other places. No, SLC is not Austin or New Orleans, but it's gotten much, much better (and in my mind rivals Austin for variety, if not quantity).   (b) I get that the ""ski bum"" experience isn't about going to a posh lounge or after-work bar downtown and chatting with the 9-5 crowd -- which is what you'll get in SLC. But I'd equally say if your goal is to hang around like-minded individuals after hours, you're better served at someplace like Molly Green's during Brighton night skiing than an upscale apres-ski bar in Park City or Vail with all the NY/LA yuppies on vacation.   For some reason people love to hate on SLC. No, it's not like all mormons have left town. Yes, there are asinine alcohol laws. But for what matters, you go to a resort like Brighton or Alta and you'll see ""normal people"" there -- i.e. not just the independently wealthy and intolerably rich yuppies on vacation. Overall the non-mormons I've met on the lifts are just as colorful (if not more so) than folks anyplace else I've lived or skied. In LCC/BCC there's a lot of naughty language and booze, and a laid-back feel. Personally, I like that I can spend a lot of time in the mountains and still attempt to have a career in SLC. You can't really get this in any other city in the US..."
skiing,39j1qk,ajfa,2,Fri Jun 12 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that SLC is dead in terms of nightlife. It's just not high on the list, which you acknowledge. I'm also not trying to ""hate on SLC."" I'm actually somewhat of a fan. If I could get my S/O to come, I'd probably even move there because of my deep, deep affection for Alta/LCC, the much cheaper cost of living, and the shitshow of people that gets worse every year in Colorado.  Also, there's plenty of ""locals"" bars in places like Vail. I don't know as much about Park City (I almost always stay in SLC when in Utah), but I'd imagine it's not too different. I've had friends ski bum in Vail and I assure you they're not drinking at the fancy slopeside places that get rich out of towners. Any big ski town is going to have the posh $15 cocktail places, but also some dive bars with $1 PBR nights on Tuesday.   You can't really get this in any other city in the US...   Reno, Denver, Vancouver, etc. all provide this to some degree. In terms of time to get out of town or to a lift, Reno is the only one that compares to SLC in terms of getting to a ""real"" mountain. Denver is less than an hour to Summit County, but only on weekdays. Vancouver has a couple good areas right across the Lions Gate Bridge, but it's almost 90 minutes to the first ""world-class"" ski area (Whistler).   Either way, everywhere I listed allows you to pursue a career and still ski a ton. I've averaged around 30 days living in Denver/Boulder, even when doing grad school or working a 9-5. Granted, I was able to ski double that once I moved to a ski town, but 30 days a year is still fine."
skiing,39j1qk,catchphish,0,Sat Jun 13 02:23:49 2015 UTC,You are aware that the resorts around Reno & Vancouver barely open this year & the year before was also horrible...right? Shit poop dirt snow trails down the mountains like so.  I think you overlooked that part.....

Cottonwoods had no problems making closing dates. Snowbird was open into May. Many of us are still touring.   250"" & running lifts for 6+ months blows anything Vancouver or Reno had.  Lastly, 30 days is not even close to ski bumming. Bums here hit triple digits easy. I dont think any lifelong skier would think 30 days is fine. Many SLC professionals hit 75+ no problem. Going skiing here is like "" going to the gym."" We go before work, or for lunch, or after work. Anytime you got a spare 2 hours if ya want. We can do that because it is only 20 minutes each way. Not a half day/full day event like the cities you listed. You'd be in the car for 2+ hours every time(at the very least). Fuck that."
skiing,39j1qk,FreeballinPGH,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:42:30 2015 UTC,"I read through and your missing the main point.  Ski culture in a small town vs. ski culture in a big city are two very different things.  I've experienced both (SLC, Denver, Vail, Crested-Butte, Wolf-Creek) and living in a city like SLC will always have the rat race mentality behind it.  That's not to say that SLC isn't awesome b/c it is, it's just way different than what most people are looking for in the ski town experience."
skiing,39j1qk,themarmot,0,Sun Jun 14 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"Shit.. I didn't know people from SLC get so defensive about how awesome it is. Especially right after someone compliments it:   If I could get my S/O to come, I'd probably even move there because of my deep, deep affection for Alta/LCC, the much cheaper cost of living, and the shitshow of people that gets worse every year in Colorado.   I know Canyons/PCMR isn't the best of Utah; not by a long shot. I literally just mentioned how much I prefer LCC. I was in Breck this winter, so that was the pass I had. I'm not a trustafarian, so I try to ski for free unless somewhere gets dumped that's not on my pass.   You can ski for a long lunch in Reno or Vancouver. You want me to Google Maps this for you? Look up Mt. Rose or Grouse respectively. Denver is more of a hike to anywhere good, but Boulder has Eldora around 35 minutes away. Also, you must be living in Sandy  or something to make it up BCC or LCC in 20 minutes. Or going 120mph. Either you're endangering everyone around you or exaggerating to seem cool on an internet forum.   Lastly, I never called myself a ski bum for skiing 30 days when living in Denver/Boulder. I skiied over 60 this year and I still wouldn't call myself a ski bum because I wear a suit to work. It's about the lifestyle as much as it is about the number of days you ski, which means the SLC yuppies you mentioned skiing 75+ days don't qualify either.  There's really no need to get your jimmies rustled guy. I love skiing in Utah. I think it's a pretty fun place to visit too. Just let it be."

skiing,39j1qk,Squirrel_Whisperer,-2,Fri Jun 12 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"No it isn't.  What is horseshit is r/skiing's inability to imagine there are other fun things to do outside of skiing.  I mountain bike, ski, snowboard, play tennis, soccer, ultimate frisbee, and etc.  The other aspect is that our biking is great.  A lot of the trails I see on /r/mtb are too tame for my tastes and wouldn't choose them over skiing.  The average day of skiing does not match the average day of biking.  A big powder day is clearly better than the best day of biking.  Biking has predictability where to worst day isn't that bad, while skiing has waist deep snow to boilerplate ice.  I expect to take downvotes each time I suggest there is something better than skiing.  But the reality is that for a huge portion of the population in Fernie that live here year round, the summer is the better season and they love biking a bit more than the snow.  For someone who only gets to ski 4 weekends a year, it doesn't get old and what I am saying is blasphemous.  My saying that I enjoy biking more on the whole does not mean I think skiing is shit.  Anyone who interprets it as such need to chill the fuck out.  I am not attacking your precious hobby.  I live for sport and skiing is just one of them.  Gun to my head, I choose year round biking.  It used to be skiing hands down.  Even my boss who owns a ski shop looks forward to biking.  Fernie's tagline is, ""Come for the winter, stay for the summer.""  Our summers kick ass."

I  want to say revy is more of a BC destination but I could be totally wrong. Honestly, I would still focus on where you can find the best paying job with the hours you want and go from there. It's going to make your life a lot easier, and better paying job with good schedule = more days on snow.   Also, side-country is the same as backcountry. Don't let it fool you into feeling secure just bc you can see it from the hill. Always be safe and go with other like-minded individuals."

Not too far from fernie or revy but the rent is cheap (this comes from someone who bummed in whistler--never again, so expensive). Source: paying 650/month all included for a spacious two bedroom house, which is split between 2 people. Could easily fit 3 if we needed to. For any ski town though, you gotta get there early to find a decent place."

skiing,39j1qk,DoktorStrangelove,6,Fri Jun 12 03:54:20 2015 UTC,"The rental market in Jackson is $$$, more like what you'd expect in a major city per ft2. Not enough supply for the demand either.  However, it isn't as fucked than if you were looking to buy.  Actual cost of living is again a little on the high side of average, but nothing too outrageous. It really isn't too terrible considering you're in fuckin Jackson hole.  If you're seriously considering this, I'd look into living on the ID side of the pass - Victor/Driggs area. A few of my friends have done this as an alternative to Jackson. Still pricey, but a lot more reasonable and a little easier to actually find somewhere to live. Jackson pretty much does not function if the pass is closed (since all the workers who keep Jackson running live there), so they actually do a pretty good job of keeping it passable in the winter for what it is. Note though that WYDOT does not use salt on roads, they just use sand. Which actually works pretty damn well, but don't even think about buying shitty no season tires. Sack up and buy a set of good winter tires, don't drive like a hack, and you'll do fine.  Edit: I also hope you have a shitload of money if you're not gonna work. Or just plan on touring on the pass, which actually would still be totally awesome. Just the weekend JHMR passes are like $900something iirc."

skiing,39j1qk,Gushers4Lunch,4,Fri Jun 12 18:04:32 2015 UTC,"I lived in Vail when I was a mountain employee, my brother lived in Jackson. If you can find work, it's definitely doable...I lived at Vail and Chamonix on very, very basic employment without too much trouble. If you can't, you better fucking have a burn-down budget figured the fuck out. Without employee subsidized housing, you're looking at $700/mo in rent AT MINIMUM (more like $900-1000), plus JHole's season pass is over a grand. Those are your absolute bare-bones expenses, not including food/booze.   As others have said, it's really not worth it to go to one of the bigtime resorts if you don't have a job. Jackson is one of the top 10 places I would seriously avoid in your situation, unless you have like $8-12k to splash on 4-5 months of living expenses at a place like that. You're already in Canada...as others have said, go to Fernie, or to Revelstoke, or even Whistler. If you MUST go to the US, go to one of the smaller CO/UT mountains, particularly ones not owned by Vail. Or, better yet, go live in Leadville and use the money you saved on rent to buy an AT setup and a season's worth of beer, cured meat, and cooking fuel up front."

I just throw Whistler in cause it's huge and Revelstoke cause it's sidecountry pow heaven.

skiing,39j1qk,pocketmonster,3,Fri Jun 12 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"A jackson pass will be close to 2k next winter. We have been in an extreme housing crisis for a while now, with even shitty 2 bedroom alts going for 2500 a month. Deals are avail but you won't find them without the help of a local or friend that has been out here for a while. The painted buffalo and super 8 do monthly rentals at about 1k a month. I've heard that they have been trying to do away with that tho. The Hostel in teton village is the shit, ski to the door and 2 mins to the tram. No buses to deal with. Plus you can sleep in on a pow day and still be on 1st box. Its about 800 a month for a bed in a roon with 3 other ppl. Living over the pass is cheaper but then you're driving, the pass closes and isn't plowed not to mention the sets of brakes you'll go through.   All that said tho, jackson is a great place to ski bum it. I moved away for the summer but ill be back for sure this winter!"
skiing,39j1qk,Jsauce75,3,Fri Jun 12 15:33:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the super 8 seems to be trying to actually be a decent place now. Rates are way higher than from what I remember now that they renovated, especially during peak season.  Definitely agree that the village hostel IMO is the way to go if you're going to be skiing primarily JHMR and the sidecountry. Although, to the OP: Get someone who knows where they're going if you venture out the gates (best part about the place is the sidecountry). Very easy to get yourself into deep shit, especially in granite."

skiing,39j1qk,CaCoD,3,Fri Jun 12 07:50:50 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to get employed by the mountain or the Four Seasons, both sponsor visas and provide housing. About 1/3-1/2 of your pay will go to housing, but passes are free or almost half price for the Four Seasons.  Second best is renting a motel room. Super 8 is $210 a week, and Kudar Motel is $650 a month. If you want a kitchenette, Elk Refuge Inn and the Pony Express are under $1k. There are a handful of other small motels that offer unadvertised monthly rates for around $700.  Outside of that, you have other options: the cheapest studios in town are $1000-1200 and are usually gone before they can me it to the newspaper (nobody uses craigslist at all), and requires F/L/D and a one year lease. A room in a house is anywhere from $500-1000. That said, everything is word of mouth. The listings that make it into the newspaper are either dangerously in disrepair or $4000 a month mansions.  Waiting tables or bartending is the best ski bum gig in town, but after the ""worst season ever,"" I'd seriously consider going to Colorado and getting amulti mountain Epic Pass for half the price of a JHMR pass, and you don't have to deal with Keeping Up With The Waltons quite as much. I got lucky with the housing situation, so I'm here for the summer, but YMMV especially as a Canadian  Edit: also the mountain closes in the 1st week of April ""because migration"" while much of UT and CO is open into late May/June 1"
skiing,39j1qk,mtfied,2,Fri Jun 12 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives in Colorado but made a few trips out there this season: Your ""worst season ever"" still kicked most of our seasons' asses. Through the first part of January didn't exactly suck. In Colorado, we had odd weather patterns, but still more or less average year as far as totals go through most of it. Still probably would be totally ok swapping snowfall...  And if you're ski bumming in CO, don't get an epic pass. That's what all of us tools on the front range do who have to have real jobs. That or a loveland pass, which is even less unreasonably priced. I paid $250 for my pass last year, at retail. Go live in CB or Telluride."
skiing,39j1qk,ajfa,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"Coming from the east, I can ski anything - but the pitch at JH and ice are not fun. January was the best with 4-5 solid powder days, but it snowed maybe once in March. It is nice to have Targhee here for a day trip and Big Sky for an overnighter. Heck, Park City and Alta are only 5 hours away, and when Jackson residents drive 4 hours RT just to hit up Walmart and Home Depot, 5 hours doesn't seem like much. Sorry if I sounded whiney and entitled (I do live here afterall) but seeing CO friends posting more and bigger powder days and skiing in June made me jealous. I'm not sure what the best CO pass is, but it beats $1500 for one season on one mountain. Mountain Collective maybe, if you are a person with a real job and lots of frequent flier miles. Telluride looks awesome with the altitude and the town tram"
skiing,39j1qk,FreeballinPGH,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's sorta how the CO season went. From mid December to April, it snowed <4"" like twice. I was in Jackson over new years, and I think the laps we did in Four Pines and Granite were by far the deepest turns I had all year. But from what I hear, it pretty much stopped snowing after that. We at least don't have to ski sheets of ice inbounds though when it stops snowing. Although you guys get teton pass. Which is like 3x the vert and area of our equivalent - berthoud pass.  The big difference IMO is the combination of terrain and stability in Jackson. In Colorado, we do get big storms, but our snowpack is shit so the danger goes through the roof. Deep instability all winter long. This year has been odd, it was awesome to ski pow all May after everyone had forgotten about skiing, but it started getting a little annoying since peak skiing season kept getting delayed (whining about pow in May, I know..). The last couple weeks it's been raining and causing a big wet slide cycle. This weekend we might have at least a no-precip window, but warm temps and clouds overnight mean no freezes. So I haven't really been able to get out much and ski many big lines this spring. Although when I have, we've managed to ski some of the best (and worst, for that matter) snow off peaks I've ever skied.  Mountain collective, loveland, crested butte, and maybe WP are probably the best deals in CO. I don't know much about telluride, but it does look awesome. Crested butte, along with the other SW CO areas, blow the front range out of the water terrain wise. Loveland and WP come with 3 days each at crested butte, and my loveland pass as a renewal is $250. Considering a ticket to CB is like $110 during peak season, it's sort of a no brainer. And I also get 3 days at monarch and an unguided silverton day. If you do mountain collective, using 2 days at Jackson and a day at A$pen pays for itself, with no flying required assuming you're living in colorado."

Good work on getting away with something and calling it ""Western"" instead of actually waiting for the right time."

skiing,39cfgy,L0J,2,Thu Jun 11 15:16:00 2015 UTC,"If you're going to armchair quarterback somebody else's decisions from a place where you'd never suffer the consequences, at least do them the service of not cherry picking quotes out of context.   ""Instead of spring corn, our boots sunk to the ankle in isothermal mush. The rain had done its work, and if the line had been one giant slot, the wet slide danger would have turned me back. Instead, the lateral bands would safely funnel anything coming down from above to the side, making our exposure a bit shorter. We talked it over, and agreed that we felt fine.""  To be fair: it was not boot deep in all places, and perhaps that's misleading. Occasionally, we did experience that depth of boot penetration, mostly in places of thin snowpack, but generally speaking the underlying snow still had a firm structure.   You're right: rain absolutely contributed to loading. But did the clouds that lingered afterward help to keep the snow surface temps cooler than a clear day? Yep.   Acknowledging wet slide danger as part of an assessment of potential risks while making decisions doesn't instantly mandate turning back--it should be part of a broader discussion. Does no-fall terrain up the ante? Unquestionably. But as I stated, our risk was more minimal in that the simple construction of the line gave us less total exposure. Based on our assessment of conditions under our feet and where we were, using the knowledge and experience of two brains, we communicated well and came to a decision.   Perhaps we did get lucky in adverse conditions, but the backcountry gives wicked feedback and nobody can say for sure unless the rug gets pulled from under them. Given that we took turns leapfrogging ski cuts down the entire thing, I find it a little hard to say that our approach sends the wrong message:  ""After pushing some of the goopy, sludgy mess down the hill on a series of ski cuts, we realized that it was a sort of slow slough management. Schmoo would pile up in runnels, only to pour over our skis anytime we got further ahead of it than we should. Essentially, we ski cut the entire thing, both of us keeping it conservative lest a rogue patch of less sticky snow come pouring down on us after we'd kicked it off.""  I'm keenly aware that my ability to make decisions as a team and as an individual in the mountains amounts to absolutely no less than a series of choices that are potentially lethal. Personally, I greatly admire that quality in the people I ski with and the mountain people I consider mentors. The lines I've backed down from don't always see the light of day, but I do make an effort to present an honest, balanced picture of failure as well as success.   The goal here was to give a trip report on a ski day that has some personal history. You're welcome to interpret the message as you will. Armchair commentary is easy when your boots aren't in the (sludgy) snow, and the people I respect would ask honest questions before assuming judgement instead of assuming the worst."

I got to try out both of the 2016s At snowbird for for a couple weeks. 2.0s are better for average day to day conditions but if you're going pow hunting more oftern I would snag the Prodigy, That being said you could ski the 2.0s in pow if need be. 108 underfoot is still decently fat."
skiing,39999f,cyanicenine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:46:05 2015 UTC,I have the prodigy 2013s. They are good.
skiing,39999f,cyanicenine,3,Sat Jun 13 00:57:50 2015 UTC,"I own the Faction Prodigy and have been happy with them.  One of the things I appreciate is that they came straight from the factory with a nice base structure already ground out.  I've bought a lot of skis and nearly all of them have come from the factory completely flat, with no base structure at all, so I appreciate that.  This made them excellent recently in the deep spring slush so I didn't get slowed down by suction in the sloppy mashed potatoes.  Haven't gotten a chance to ride them in pow yet, but I imagine they'd do quite well.  The super soft rockered tips climb up and out of just about anything.  Faction had problems with some of it's earlier Candide line up (1.0 - 4.0) skis because they tried to use balsa wood cores.  Which definitely made for an extremely lightweight ski, but there were some durability issues.  They've since changed back to a more traditional poplar and ash core, which is what the Prodigy uses.  As an all mountain ski I think the prodigy would be a great one quiver.  The 2.0 is more symmetrical, with a shorter sidecut for hooking into spins.  So if you plan on doing any park the 2.0 might be a good choice.  The prodigy is of a similar width, but it is directional with a longer sidecut so it will ride more traditionally than the 2.0 which will favor a more centered park stance.  Faction is making quality skis, I say go for it if you want a pair."
skiing,39999f,gfmels,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:45:05 2015 UTC,Thanks I appreciate the feedback. I don't get into the park much so would you recommend prodigy of 2.0?

I'm 6'2'', 155 lbs, not very strong to be honest, intermediate skill level, typically ski in southern/central Wisconsin with a week or two in Colorado (A Basin, Loveland, Winter Park)."
skiing,39999f,cyanicenine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"The 174 would be too short imho.  The prodigy has a substantial amount of tip rocker, it is also slightly shorter than advertised, so the 174 is really more like a 172.  I would get at least the 178, but most people would probably tell you to get the 184.    It's so soft in the tips it really is not a difficult ski to manage even with extra length."
skiing,39999f,voklskier4452,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:02:37 2015 UTC,Not sure which brands you deal with but on the couple hundred pairs of skis I have sent out over the last few years I haven't seen any come from the factory flat.  Sure some of them have more aggressive patterns from the factory when compared to others but never flat.
skiing,39999f,cyanicenine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:54:09 2015 UTC,"If I can't detect it with my fingertips then I don't consider it to be structured (it is possible they had a really shallow structure).  I have skis from most of the major manufacturers, salomon, rossignol, K2, volkl, armada.   Maybe those other skis ""technically"" have a structure but if it's so slight that you can't detect it, then it's not going to be doing much for you.    On my Faction skis you can look at the ski from several feet away and see the ridges from the structure, and it was obvious in the wet snow how much better that ski was preforming versus my other skis.  I have a pro tune on a couple of my K2 skis, and the structure of the Factions looks similar to that on my K2's which I had to pay $70 to have run through the structuring machine."
skiing,39999f,KrimsonKnight,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"Thats actually quite the opposite of how structure works.  Deep structures obviously do work better in snow with high moisture content as you found out but the much shallower structures are what works for the entire rest of the season which is why most skis come with them.  If you are paying $70 for someone to put a super deep structure on your skis you are paying a lot for bad service, they are taking a huge chunk of base off of your ski in order to achieve the ""look"" you desire.  Go to any good race shop and see what their work looks like. That said if you are into having crazy structure on your skis then by all means have it your way, I have received far stranger requests while working in the back shop."
skiing,39999f,SkiMonkey98,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"First off, I live in the PNW.  Snow with low moisture content is right up there with unicorns and leprechauns as far as I can tell.    Secondly, what recreational skier is saying to himself ""You know, I really feel like this rock hard icy groomer isn't fast enough.""  Speed issues for the general masses do not manifest themselves until you get to the wet snow.  That flat cat track that was no problem for even the most pizza'd skier to get back to the lift, suddenly becomes a mile long hike once you get to warm wet snow, or my personal PNW favorite, rain soaked pow.  Faction is putting this ""deep"" structure on their bases by default, so I can't be the only one who thinks this way.  EDIT: I should also note that the structure that came default on the Prodigy is nearly identical to the structures that I get when I buy a race tune from our local shop."

skiing,3967bt,Warlord24,4,Tue Jun 9 23:06:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't broken my leg but I'm an biomedical engineer who works on similar devices. It's really important you take it easy coming back because your bone structure needs time to adapt to the new force profile through your femur. You will have lost a lot of bone mass in your off time so it will be easier to break your leg again. The good news is the body is an amazing machine, your bone will grow stronger and more dense in important areas around your rod over time.   TL; DR, take it easy and take your time and you'll be fine. Good luck!"

I still had the rod in, but had had a lot of lasting pain because of the rod. Skiing was easier on my leg than walking or running. You can totally ski, just take it slow and don't push farther than you know you can take. Remember, if you break your leg again with the rod in, you're extra fucked."
skiing,3967bt,RedDragonPryde,2,Tue Jun 9 23:44:29 2015 UTC,"My friend had the same operation after a broken femur. His doc said he could ski as the bone would actually heal stronger than when it started at the site of the break (he had a very very clean break), but.... he also said that if you ever did break it again you'd basically be fucked, because the rod inside the leg would be bend and there would be no good way to pull it out to replace it and it would require a major operation.  tl;dr: ski, but be careful.  edit: He actually recommended having a second surgery to remove the rod after it's completely healed if you participate in risky sports for the reason above. Not sure the timing on that though..."
skiing,3967bt,bawheid,2,Tue Jun 9 23:53:41 2015 UTC,"I broke mine about 6 years ago and you eventually get used to it and learn to readjust. In my opinion, it depends on how you broke it and if you think that what you did is repeatable. Mine was a ""freak accident"" and I didn't think that it could happen again, if I avoided recreating some of the circumstances.   My advice is to trust the doc, as many have pointed out, but to also listen to yourself. If something hurts, don't do it and take it easy until you feel comfortable. My rod has been in my leg since the surgery and probably won't come back out; and I mostly never think about it, except for some associated knee pain.   I still ski at a high level, but it took me a while to gain the confidence to do it without fear. Anyhow, here's a pic of my leg the day it happened: http://i.imgur.com/uLrbKiX.jpg  Good luck, you'll be fine, even if it takes a season or two!"

It's my understanding that not every bit of metal bolting, pinning or screwing bones together necessarily has to come out again. Think of people with metal plates in their skull, those plates are there for a lifetime. Unless your screws impinge or interfere with your movement or cause you discomfort, maybe they'll stay where the surgeon put them or until they need them back for the next guy:)"
skiing,3967bt,111l,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:04:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, snapped my femur last nov. In April I was doing some black groomers and even dabbling in the trees with enough physical therapy. For some reason skiing is even easier than hiking for me. Hip and leg are still a good level of fucked up but I'm hoping to be 100% by next winter.  You can do more than you think you can and with the intramedullary nail it's better to push your muscles that were damaged in the surgery. Definitely keep at it with the hip flexor stuff because that's what's giving me the most long term issues it seems."

skiing,396s2r,LeKiwi,7,Tue Jun 9 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the Blizzard Brahmas. I watched your video and watched you ski, along with your description of what you want to ski I think something in the low to mid 90s underfoot will suit you. You have been skiing on carvers but want to go a bit off piste to find the crud (bit of an early rise in the tip) and chopped pow, the brahma will handle all of that very well while allowing you to rip the resort with your buddies.   Big skis can do more harm to your knees than good if you are skiing hard pack vs daily pow turns. The Brahma will take care of you. It is a stiff ski but your weight will barge right through the metal sheet and you will bend that ski. Go for the mid or top length when buying. Good luck!"
skiing,396s2r,skithetram,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:56:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I will look into them. I have one more question. If I buy my skis online somewhere and want my boots fitted. Do I buy bindings before and have them mount the bindings? Or do I better buy boots and bindings together after I've already bought skis.
skiing,396s2r,Redditorialist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:59:19 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for the Brahmas. I skied the 2013-14 version (they are mostly unchanged since then), and they absolutely rip. They are my go to ski for hard snow conditions.   I am about your size (6'1"", 200 lbs) and I am on the 187 length. They are stiff as a 1989 teen dude who found his dad's playboy stash, so I would consider sizing down to the 180 if you aren't a particularly aggressive skier. I would bet that 180 will still be plenty of ski for you. The Brahma will reward you for pushing the speed limit on the groomers, but it is still plenty versatile to keep up on days with 6"" of fresh snow. They should be good enough for now for deeper days since you are just learning the sweet science of powder skiing. But consider a wider ski (100-110 mm) when you start graduating to deeper snow.   Best of luck, and next time consider posting this in the weekly ""All about me"" post. That's what it's there for."

How would you describe your skiing style?    There are a lot of awesome skis out there.  I'd find a few you like and demo/rent them then decide from there.  I've picked up the last three pairs of skis I own that way just buying last seasons graphic for a good discount.
skiing,396s2r,allkatnic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"I usually ski in the French alps. As I live in Belgium I don't go over there for just a day or two, so demoing seems a bit harder. I try to see as many resorts, so my friends and I pick a different resort every year.   How can I describe my skiing stile, hmmm. I like to ski with my legs really close together, I somehow find that most comfortable skiing position. Also, I love speed and taking jumps or pieces of untracked terrain next to the pistes/slopes.  Here is a video of me and my buddies skiing. I am the one with the green helmet (upper right, you have profiles). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR7QWBl70AM"
skiing,396s2r,AnonSBF,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"You are clearly the best skier in your group.  I would suggest getting your legs apart so you can get further on edge and rail the turns more.  Because of where you ski I am going to suggest the Volkl Kendo.  You really won't need anything over 100mm underfoot.  The Kendo, and Volkls in general, is a ski you will need to ski.  If you aren't driving it, it will take you for a ride.  Some people love the Dynastar Cham 97. I hate it, but because it is a softer ski and wants to do a lot of short radius turns and I don't ski that way.  If you keep your speed moderate and like the idea of snaking short turns down the slope it could be the perfect fit."
skiing,396s2r,AnonSBF,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:16:07 2015 UTC,I loved the Sin 7s when I took them out on a demo day (Colorado). I'd recommend getting a size bigger because of how they widen at the tip. I sized up and found that I was able to initiate turns better and get a harder carve than when I tried the Sins in my usual size.

skiing,396s2r,gris-gris,2,Tue Jun 9 22:10:05 2015 UTC,well you have pretty much the same exact height and weight as i do and my two quivers right now are 175 and 188.  I would say get 174 unless you are sure that you will be shredding a lot more powder. The 179 on the 100's are definitely worth a look too and those will be the ones that ill go for if i'm looking a one pair fits all.

However when comparing to Japans massive dumps of powder, I feel like Korea would have to have to offer something quite compelling to persuade me to go there instead. I'd be curious to see what others can say if they have been to both.  If returning to Japan, lots of Australians go to Hakuba and Niseko. Go somewhere different, there's plenty on offer.  Personally I loved Shiga Kogen. It's a massive multi area valley where you ski between interconnected areas, all on one pass. http://www.yudanaka-shibuonsen.com/userfiles/file/Shiga_Kogen_Map.jpg  You can probably find a resort matching whatever sort of thing you're looking for in japan - start with the bullet pointed lists on here: http://www.powderhounds.com/Japan/Best-Ski-Resorts.aspx"

They blow lots of snow and have many groomers, thus leading to very predictable groomers to cruise on throughout the session.  Smuggs and Mad River have the best skiers attitude in my opinion.  Meaning most people there just want to ski and not show off their expensive gear.  Jay, Smuggs, and Mad River have the best advanced terrain.  Jay, Stowe, Smuggs, and Mad River all have great slack and back county to explore.  Overall, Stowe is the best resort mountain.  Since pricing is not a factor, I would go with Stowe since its close, predictable, and has all the resources you would need to get your feet underneath you and allow for advancing your skill throughout the winter."

skiing,391rny,voklskier4452,4,Mon Jun 8 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"Smuggs has good terrain but has slow and cold lifts.  I have never been a fan of stowe but it does have a large amount of varied terrain and I know many of my park rat friends like it there.  Bolton is closest of all of them and dirt cheap, they also do night skiing which is always fun to do.  It has far fewer trails than the ones you listed except for MRG but they are mostly pretty interesting trails.  Sugarbush has grown on me over the last couple years but they still do stupid crap like only open a couple lifts at 8am on weekends and holidays.  I'm not sure about your college pass but I know on the 20's pass at sugarbush, MRG is an extra cost of like $60.  Jay can be cold and is reasonably far away from burlington.  The terrain is good but I would go with someone who knows the mountain to get the best experience.  I am in the same boat as you and I will most likely be getting a bolton pass and a sugarbush pass.  Reason being it is a quick drive to bolton from burlington or hinesburg where I work so i can easily get some night skiing in or get some early morning runs in before going to work. I have a place to stay in sugarbush which means it is my best ""big mountain"" option for the cost or I would drive down to killington/pico because I still like it better than the mountains around here."

skiing,38vi3g,SPF12,6,Sun Jun 7 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"A Basin compares well with Squaw, IMO.  I've skied both enough to say that and I'm surprised anyone would say otherwise.  Nothing else in Summit and Eagle counties compares with Squaw, but then again, nothing else around Lake Tahoe does, either, unless you include Kirkwood.   Day ticket prices have become exorbitant in CO, even higher than Heavenly and Northstar, so you'll want a pass, of course.  A Basin would be my first choice, but that's 'cause I like steeps and altitude.  However, I don't know enough about tree skiing at the other mountains, and I love that as well.  A-Bay has very little in the way of trees. Long bump runs and groomer trails abound elsewhere.  The advice here regarding backcountry is right on.  Continental snowpack is far less stable, both in the short and long term, than coastal snowpack.  However, in the 9 to 11,000' range, there is a ton of great wooded terrain that holds the snowpack well; it's up higher, and in chutes and bowls, that the danger lurks far greater.  Get trained, ski with 2 companions, pieps and shovels, you can ski safely most of the season.  You hit the lifts right after a storm, hit the backcountry 48 hours later, when the avy danger will have dropped significantly."
skiing,38vi3g,frank_mania,9,Sun Jun 7 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"If you do any skiing out of bounds you need to be aware that the snowpack in Colorado is completely different from Tahoe. Instabilities can last weeks or months here.   Hike to terrain at Breck is where I go to avoid crowds if I'm there. Pali at A Basin and some of the Zuma cornice runs. Keystone sucks. Vail is good once you figure out where to go, but gets ridiculously crowded. Beaver Creek has some fun tree runs, and the stone creek chutes are fun but short. Also BC is much less crowded than Vail."
skiing,38vi3g,Timberline1,5,Sun Jun 7 05:16:43 2015 UTC,"Well said. Vail is amazing after a fresh snow, but it's not worth it on many other days IMO. Breck has some fun stuff, but I haven't really found anything I'd be afraid to hit (including the hike terrain). BC has fantastic terrain. Love it. People like to hate on  A Bay for being small, but those are the people that probably just stick to groomers. Love A Basin. People go there to ski... it's not soulless like some of the other mountains seem to be out here. Keystone sucks."
skiing,38vi3g,jdizzle15,2,Sun Jun 7 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"Keystone sucks.   This is the consensus view. Keystone has a lot going against it, but I feel this  is a bit too dismissive. If OP is going to become a local, it may be worth knowing the ins and outs of Keystone as well.  First the negatives. It gets far less snow than its Summit county neighbors, even often getting several inches less in a day than A Basin which is 7 miles up the road.It gets ridiculously crowded and the layout of the mountain leads to endless bottlenecks and tricky navigation. For the most part, the terrain lacks challenge. The parking lot is a seriously long hike from the lifts and even if you get dropped off by a shuttle bus, you'll have to trek through a fake village to get to the snow.   On the plus side, I am not a terrain park guy, but Keystone has a massive one and if you are in to that sort of thing, it's hard for me to believe that theirs isn't worth checking out. There is some interesting terrain in the Outback, good tree skiing and the back bowls are worth a hike or a $5 sno cat ride (although the runs are relatively short and the long flat run out back to the lift is tiresome). Pretty good bump runs on North Peak. The Santiago lift is usually uncrowded in the afternoon and you get get a bunch of laps in on Ambush and Powder Keg. Impressive snow making system. Although the front side is usually pretty unbearable, on uncrowded days you can have fun bombing the long groomers there."
skiing,38vi3g,frank_mania,2,Sun Jun 7 19:21:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the synopsis.  Keystone is the kind of family resort I'd never go to: it hasn't the snow or terrain for me, too expensive to bring my family to.  But were I a local, and had access to the occasional comp pass, I'd certainly explore it during an off-peak weekday, especially when freshies are to be found."
skiing,38vi3g,DoctFaustus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:59:56 2015 UTC,Some days are just Keystone days.  It happens.  Skip the big parking lots and fake village and park over by Mountain House.  It was the original base area and has a much better feel and less crowds.  A big ol' cup of BBQ baked beans at Labonte's Cabin is the cheapest lunch on the hill if you're foolish enough not to pack one.
skiing,38vi3g,Eggrolltide,6,Tue Jun 9 06:25:12 2015 UTC,"The big difference is that it snows here.  But honestly, expect more crowds and less gnarly terrain. There's a lot of fun to be had if you seek it out, so be sure to get off the beaten path. Ignore the people who complain about everything, I hear all the time how everything is too crowded, vail resorts sucks, terrain is flat, and I just think that those people complaining lack creativity."
skiing,38vi3g,thefrenchtickler69,2,Sun Jun 7 13:02:52 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you how it compares to Tahoe mountains because I've never been out there but I think you'll find the mountains in the area to be just as good.  So within 45 mins of you you'll have A-Basin, Keystone, Breck, Vail, Copper, Loveland, and Beaver Creek. A-Basin and Loveland are both mountains that cater more to locals than to tourists so you'll find them to be less crowded during prime skiing months.  Both mountains offer some amazing experts only terrain,  especially the east wall at A-Basin. All the big name ones are amazing to ski early season if the snow is good,  which it usually is,  and usually has everything open by early December.  Once you get to Christmas time the big name resorts become extremely crowded on the lower mountain.  I've found Breck to be the worst at crowd control personally. I just usually ride A-Basin during January and February due to prime parking and great atmosphere at the bars. Vails back bowls are incredible,  especially on a powder day. Keystone is great for tree skiing as most of the lift accessed terrain is below tree line. All in all my favorite area at any of these mountains has to be Zuma Cornice at A-Basin so definitely check that out if you get the chance."
skiing,38vi3g,jmt970,2,Sun Jun 7 05:09:01 2015 UTC,"Squaw has more exciting terrain than anything in Eagle/Summit county but there's still some nice options. Living there, you'll figure it out quickly. Also this is subjective but the snow quality (light, dry) is better in Colorado, I think that'll be the biggest difference you'll notice on your first big pow day.  You'll hear a lot of people on the internet rag on Colorado but there's a reason people vacation out here in droves, and that reason is consistency due to the snow quality and high elevation. A bad year in the rockies is still pretty good. A bad year in California or the PNW is a complete disaster, as we have seen recently."
skiing,38vi3g,King_Dab,2,Sun Jun 7 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"So I live near Aspen and lived in Summit County for a couple seasons. Here's my  semi brief synopsis of Summit County, and it's ski areas.   Breckenridge: 45 minute wait lines, working for vail resorts BLOWS and they hold your pass over your head. The park is perfection and Breckenridge has the best terrain. Hit it up during the week during non-peak points in the season. Grooming = on point, if you like bombing groomers. There's a lift that goes to a 10 minute hike to amazing bowls/chutes/great terrain. Be careful up there, as it gets skied out quickly. Be there at 8 for lift open, unless you like sideswept snow.   Keystone: to the guy who says keystone sucks, he obviously hasn't really ridden keystone. My personal favorite out of all the Summit county mountains, the front mountain never gets snow, thus keeping gapers roaming about the front side. The real money is the back two peaks no one ever rides at keystone. Snow, and I've got one word: trees. Mostly expert terrain back there, be warned. Oh and not to mention if you like park, they have got it all. A-51 to I-70, the parks are stacked with really fun features, and lots of stupid tourists to laugh at (as the parks are on the one side. But- with one lift to access them all, 50+ park lap days are easily available. (During the week)  Vail: now THIS shit gets packed. Such a great park and the back bowls are... Fucking Christ. And they tend to get A LOT more snow then anyone else. If there's a powder day coming, go to vail... Unless it's the weekend. Or peak. Or any day. Because they reach their mountain capacity, more days then not. Not in summit county, but close enough, and if you have an epic pass you can go there (and beaver creek)  A Basin - the shit. From the beach to the gnarly terrain to the mostly semi limited crowds, a basin is the bees knees. I literally have nothing bad to say about this place. Some bitch about the outdated lifts but, I feel like it adds some nostalgia.   BUT - Aspen/snowmass beats any of those mountains by a landslide. Truth.   Edit: Fuck how do I forget the funnest one? Copper. Amazing park and pipe, the trees are supreme, and the crew is super duper chill. Not as main stream as the Vail-owned resorts, copper generally offers smaller crowds and fun times. Good deals on random days of the year and the terrain is super fun to navigate."

skiing,38vuec,tartay745,2,Sun Jun 7 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"Get the 186s. Generally you want a ski for intermediate/advanced to be about your same height and taller for expert skiers.

If you get the 177s they will be good for a while but once you progress you'll be wishing you went longer. I guess it's a question of how fast that progression will be, and whether or not you'll be updating skis again in the near future."
skiing,38uzpz,Undercover_Newb,2,Sun Jun 7 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"I love my wailer 112s. If it snowed more in Tahoe they'd be my daily driver. I ski the 190s and I'm 6'3"" 195, and the only defect with the ski is some softness in the shovels when charging in heavy Tahoe mank. I have some Shiros for that though....  In open pow of any depth I've had good to great float. With the huge amount of tip splay, they plane fast. The ski is floaty, slarvy, and works great at slow speeds in tight trees. The edge hold is great, and they make for a fun groomer ski, if it's not 9am on a March morning in a melt-freeze cycle.   The ski is super fun in corn and general spring conditions. I think it would make a perfect dedicated touring ski. I ski on rocks in low tide, and the bases hold up. My pair is 3 years old and has seen 100+ days, and it's still a fun fun fun ski.  The only time I wish I was on a different ski is in deep, heavy sierra cement. And that's likely due to my height and wight. My other skis are mantras and katanas, so I like metal and I like to nuke through things. Not the strength of the wailer, but if you can get out a pair, do. They're fun."
skiing,38uzpz,amateur_acupuncture,2,Sun Jun 7 03:58:57 2015 UTC,Are you on the 112RP's or 112RPC's? (thanks for the reply btw)
skiing,38uzpz,amateur_acupuncture,2,Sun Jun 7 04:14:50 2015 UTC,"It's the '11-12 I think. The RPC is stiffer and more charge-oriented, but I don't know how much more than the OG wailer, or if the new RPs are softer. I'm not sure in which product line my skis would fall today. EDIT: I went to the garage and looked. It's the RP.  Either way, a super fun ski. At your weight, you may get everything you want from a long RP. You're welcome, I'm happy to evangelize my wailers, DPS is a great small company."
skiing,38uzpz,CaCoD,2,Sun Jun 7 04:54:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't skied the concept so can't really offer anything there. Im definitely intrigued by the longer radius with multiple camber points. I can say that I'm not a fan of the dramatic multiple camber profiles (a la moment), but the praxis offering looks much more refined and subtle.   Wailer 112 - I wouldn't call it a charger by any means in the standard layup I skied. Regardless of the flex, the shape is very much more content making hippy turns than charging variable snow. I haven't skied the RPC, but the shape still isn't going to lend itself to hard charging. The shape is very capable of going fast in soft snow that isn't heavy chop or crud, but so are most semi stiff 110-115 underfoot skis. This also isn't mostly reverse camber, and actually has a pretty good amount of camber underfoot - which is part of why it performs on hardpack as well as it does.  I'd also consider the praxis GPO. It is more pivoty than the rp112, but in a smeary way. It won't ski hardpack like a slalom ski due to the longer radius and more gradual rocker/taper, but that's what makes it more smeary and much less hooky in soft but variable snow.  One side note, I would ignore the blister gear review of the GPO. Normal those guys are pretty on point, but pretty much every statement they made about the ski I thought was the complete opposite of reality. The last handful of pages of the Tgr GPO thread are way more useful.  If soft snow performance and hard charging are the priorities, I'd also check out the on3p billy goat. Aside from the praxis protest, it's probably my favorite ski of the soft snow/charger category I've ever skied, and certainly the most versatile. As well as it skis soft snow, it has no business rallying variable and hardpack as well as it does. I've had exactly 1 day where I felt even slightly undergunned on this ski, and it was a waist deep day in JHMR side country.  I'd like to throw out there as well that nobody aside from on3p, including DPS, comes close to the absolutely bombproof construction of praxis. It is on a completely different level. I have a pair of freerides as a spring touring ski that see an absurd amount of abuse (like all my skis). Like walking on 4x4 roads, skinning up boulder fields, skiing/sidestepping/jumping on piles of rocks, etc. Last time out, they got skied about 1200 vert of what couldn't have been more than 50% snow. Admittedly it was slightly excessive, but it cumulated in ""skiing"" the actual dirt/boulder road cut to with absolutely no snow. Like jump turns to piles of dirt and boulders. There is a lot of light base scratches and obviously edge burrs, but zero coreshots or significant edge damage."
skiing,38uzpz,amateur_acupuncture,2,Sun Jun 7 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"+1 for the Billy Goat. I'd almost forgotten that I'd briefly owned a pair. Super floaty, but they charged through Tahoe mank. A very fun ski.  I think my Shiros are more ""charge-y"" than the billygoats, but even though that ski was 2cm longer and 4 mm wider, it felt much more of a deep-snow specific ski and less versatile. I don't tend to grab the Shiros if it's the day after the storm or there was a huge wind event when I know I'm gonna ski windscour or sastrugi....   I'd love to own a pair of praxis skis from a durability standpoint. My buddies who own them ski rocks with impunity."
skiing,38uzpz,CaCoD,2,Sun Jun 7 17:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the RES of the newer gens have made that the least hooky ski I've ever skied. Especially in snow like tahoe mank. The 191 has a substantially different on snow feel than the 186 (I own the 186 tour, 191 std layup, and have skied the 186 std layup), more than the dimensions suggest. A lot more planky and really wants to go straight. Still stupidly maneuverable for the size though.  Durability wise, I'd really consider them on the same level as praxis. Possibly a little more beef since I believe their bases and sedges are slightly thicker? Finish quality is a little nicer with praxis though. I ski rocks more or less as if they were snow with both brands and have yet to destroy a pair. Which is a lot less than I've managed with pretty much any other ski, even with sometimes trying to avoid rocks.."
skiing,38uzpz,amateur_acupuncture,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"The Billy Goat's are looking really nice, it's just I'm not sure I would be able to handle them in tight trees. What do you think?"
skiing,38uzpz,CaCoD,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Mine were the first ski with tip and tail rocker. They revolutionized how I looked at tight trees in soft snow. They turn on a dime. Really, and ski with a 5-point sidecut shape and tons of tail rocker is meant to turn fast. I don't recall much of a difference in published tuning radius.  That said, the Billygoats felt like a much bigger ski than the wailers. They're only 2 mm wider underfoot, but if I still had both pairs of skis, the wailers would see more use. I think they're a little better in firmer and on groom."
skiing,38uzpz,hiddenlands,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"The newer ones with RES are definitely less ""slashy"" (read: have a supportive tail), but I've never skied anything else that is as maneuverable as the BG for its size and ability to charge hardpack or less than ideal conditions.  It is a ski that requires a bit of tip pressure to really do whatever you want it to, but it won't punish you for a bit of centered/tail gunning skiing (hardpack is a little less forgiving, the RES wants to turn the wrong way if you get too sloppy). Im 5'9 155# and I've skied my 191s a good amount in crested butte - very tight, steep, techy terrain. I do find it to be a bit much there, but its because the ski won't physically fit in some places being a 191. A 186 would COMPLETELY solve all those issues.  In summation: If you ski with a centered stance, an RP112 will be more maneuverable at low speeds in tight spaces/be a little more user friendly overall. If you can actually keep your weight forward and pressure the front half of a ski, I can almost guarantee you will have zero issues with maneuverability with a BG."

If you're worried about flight time, perhaps consider an operation that also has a snowcat, so you can at least ski low angle trees during a weather event.  If you live in Utah, and have cash to spend, why ski in your backyard?  There is a heli outfit in Tahoe, but it doesn't snow here, so I wouldn't risk it. There's an outfit in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada that some friends have flown with and they enjoyed, but when I think ""great experience"" rural NV doesn't really come to mind if I'm dropping a bonus on it.  FWIW, many outfits book up months to a year in advance. Start calling around now to try to find an open spot for next year, especially with the more popular guide services in the bigger-name locales."

skiing,38p5mp,amateur_acupuncture,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to keep looking, and I hope to find what I'm looking for, but there are cat skiing operations that list the same runs/vert as the heli-skiing that services the same general area- which suprises me, I would have thought that the heli would have gotten you higher, faster.  Is it just that the heli is taking you to steeper, more rugged terrain?"
skiing,38p5mp,jmt970,2,Fri Jun 5 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I think a lot is terrain based. If your permit area is far from a road/your base, it makes a lot of sense to fly as you can cover more area, faster. But, if your permit area abuts a road and you have a good ridge to climb, then it can be easier to rack up vert over a longer day in a cat.  I've cat skied, and its nice to warm up, have a snack, and kick it in the machine while it climbs. Your vert is spread out over a longer day.   Of course, there is the note of group dynamics to consider. If you don't ""sell out"" a machine with your friends, or a guaranteed group os skiers like you, you run the risk of in an aircraft or cat skiing 25 degree pow with 55 year old surgeons whilst looking at the hotness. A friend is a hell guide in AK and most of the time he takes rich old guys down what would be single black terrain at the resort. It's just easier to manage risk that way."
skiing,38p5mp,facepillownap,2,Fri Jun 5 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"Is it just that the heli is taking you to steeper, more rugged terrain?   In general, yes. The A-Star can get to places that are either out of range or just not accessible by a cat.   Honestly though, I think most people would be better off doing cat instead of helicopter served skiing. Unless you are truly truly an expert, the terrain they put you on will be similar and cat skiing is a fraction of the cost."

You could potentially get bad luck and bad conditions (and by bad I mean something like a rain event or a thaw/freeze, not just the fact that it hasn't snowed in a while).  You need to make sure you approach it with the right mindset or you could end up being really disappointed.  I've only been cat skiing so I can't suggest any heli operations.  Good luck and have fun!"

If you want a truly once in a lifetime experience, you will need to pay the big bucks. A friend of mine with moneybags for parents goes heli and cat skiing in BC every year. They've gone to Baldface Lodge (as I've heard, it's essentially the rolls Royce of experiences), Canadian Mountain Holidays and Selkirk Tangiers. Heli skiing requires more ideal weather windows, so you may end up waiting for a storm to end - whereas cat skiing is less weather dependent."

skiing,38jsdl,LeKiwi,44,Thu Jun 4 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"It is probably close to impossible without crampons and proper angled ice axes, and even then it may be difficult depending on conditions (soft snow walls, overhanging snow at top, etc). Not to forget that any movement in this situation increases the risk of falling further down into the crevasse, who knows what is below the snow he landed on. This is why he puts an ice screw into the wall and attaches it to himself, in case the snow underneath him gives way he will hang securely on the ice screw. Pretty much a textbook example of how you should react to this situation if you ask me."

skiing,38jsdl,vodfather,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:07:59 2015 UTC,"The biggest factor is that he was with a party.  He expected for them to notice his absence and figure it out.    Self rescue can be a dicy proposition.  The snow inside the crevasse was visibly soft, and depending on depth, trying to worm your way through it can be very physically taxing, and the possibility of worsening your position is real.  With one ice axe, one ski, two poles, and one ice screw anchor, a person could have gotten out, possibly easier than expected.  Then again a person could have overbalanced and gotten injured, fallen deeper into the crevasse, lost more gear, etc.  I expect that if his party had not shown up, he would have started working his way out, but his party was there within 20  minutes right?  If you are in a perilous situation like twenty feet down in a crevasse, you have to get an anchor in, get your skis off, not be stuck on your face, then catch your breath.  By the time your figure out what just happened, and what you are going to do about it, 20 minutes has passed, and your party has arrived to rescue you.  If a couple hours pass, and things change."
skiing,38jsdl,middleclasshomeless,5,Fri Jun 5 18:53:13 2015 UTC,did he lose a ski while getting out? he didn't appear to be injured. or is it just practice to air lift someone off when things like this happen?

Once he screws in, he's safe, until that point he's not.   Admittedly I'm not so experienced here but I have at least done a course on this. The one thing I was wondering about was why he was using an ice axe to climb out rather than using an accender on the rope. Maybe figured it was better as it was up basically a ramp. Also they didnt seem to do a good job of preparing the lip, should have stuck a shovel or something under the rope. Other than that looked good work."

skiing,38oxat,SamuelGompers,5,Fri Jun 5 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"To chime in here... Plastic has a life. Over time it looses flexibility and it becomes brittle and much more prone to breaking. What does it this mean? It means that plastic shell can split in half on the hill. Meaning your foot is now surrounded by jagged plastic, its not staying in that binding very long, and you have no control. Sound fun? Not really. I've seen these shattered shells come into the shop before, and people can't get over how scary it was when it happened. Don't join that crowd.  In a more practical sense. Most manufactures only keep parts for 5 years, maybe 7 max these days. After that, straight to the dumpster. Inventory and keeping parts in stock for a 15 year old boot (as much as everyone swears they bought it only 5 years ago) is terribly costly and complicated. Simply put, you will almost never find a piece for a boot that old.  Check out a ski shop in early fall. They usually have last year's stock at some good prices."
skiing,38oxat,tmbrwolf,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:26:09 2015 UTC,Basically you're saying boots have a general expiry date of 5 years or so?
skiing,38oxat,TheLi0n,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"No, boots will last you a long time if you take care of them. Just don't expect to hold on to the same boots for your entire ski career. If finding replacement parts is a worry because you wear through boots, get replacements ahead of time. Don't wait until you have worn the heel right through to the shell."
skiing,38oxat,tmbrwolf,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"Good advice. I've been through a number of boots, but I love my current ones. Time to buy some spare heels."
skiing,38oxat,TheLi0n,15,Wed Jun 10 04:37:04 2015 UTC,Come to the 21st century: get new boots! If the boot sole has broken off it is probably a sign of excess wear in other parts as well. I had to let a favorite pair of boots go for just that reason. Go see a good boot fitter.
skiing,38oxat,katanavwerks,-4,Fri Jun 5 18:00:33 2015 UTC,I know I should; theyre just so expensive!
skiing,38oxat,DJ_codeword,9,Fri Jun 5 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"A new boot costs less than a broken leg. Old boots are known to be pretty dangerous to ride in. If you live in a ski town I'm sure you could hit up some end of the season sales, or hell, maybe goodwill has some."
skiing,38oxat,cyanicenine,8,Fri Jun 5 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"While it is certainly ideal to get fitted for boots properly and pay top dollar for whatever boot fits, it's not always feasible if you are on a budget.  The most affordable way to get boots is to go to your local ski swap. Every city with skiing available nearby has one, and often several. They usually happen in the fall (October or November) and portion of the sales go to the host, often ski patrol or ski teams. It's a great way to find a huge selection of cheap used gear, especially boots. Boots more than skis have terrible resale value, because of the emphasis on getting properly fitted. Most people won't buy used boots. So you can find tons of formerly $600 boots for $50, often enough they've only been worn a few times or never worn at all.  Sure it's not as great as getting fitted for a new boot, but there is usually a huge selection to choose from, so you should be able to find something that works reasonably well. If you learn how to do a shell check you could just go around and look at the shells and then buy a brand new liner. Aftermarket liners are better than stock liners anyways, so you could feasibly end up with a better fitting boot for considerably less cash going that route rather than paying top dollar at a ski store. You could even use some of the money you saved from buying a used shell and put it towards some Sidas custom footbeds, boosterstraps, or some bootwork to get your shells fitting perfect."
skiing,38oxat,zergl,4,Fri Jun 5 21:20:30 2015 UTC,You know what's expensive as well? Having an accident because your boots experience sudden critical existence failure.
skiing,38oxat,tl0L,10,Fri Jun 5 22:25:42 2015 UTC,It's time for new boots my dude.
skiing,38oxat,The_High_Life,4,Fri Jun 5 19:58:20 2015 UTC,Call who ever made that boot and see if they have replacements.  You may have let this go too far and need new boots though.
skiing,38oxat,iwasinthepool,3,Fri Jun 5 17:28:23 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess they're fresh out of parts for that boot.
skiing,38oxat,PigSlam,4,Fri Jun 5 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"Step 1.  Determine year, make, model, size.   Step 2.  Search the internet, using those details  Step 3.  If you find a place that sells the thing you're looking or, buy it.    Alternate Step 3.  If you are unsuccessful at step 2, go to a ski shop and ask.   Without the details from Step 1, nobody will be able to help you."
skiing,38oxat,neatopat,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:20:02 2015 UTC,Ski shops rarely have these (especially that old) unless they are they the boots they rent and replace regularly. There are just too many different makes and models to carry teplacement heels and toes in stock. The only hope us to contact the manufacturer.
skiing,38oxat,PigSlam,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, but ski shops often have an established relationship with distributors, and have a better 'in' with those companies than the average joe with a web browser/phone.  Step 3 is a solution that allows the possibility of contacting the manufacturer, as they would be a potential place online that has the thing OP needs, and may be willing to sell it to them."
skiing,38oxat,neatopat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"I've worked at multiple ski shops. Whenever people need heal replacements, they're told to call the manufacturer. That's the only way to get them, if you're lucky. Unless your heal piece is identical to one on boots still available in retail, they're virtually impossible to find. One, it's a way for boot companies to get you to buy new boots. Two, like I said, no store is going to stock every heal peace for every make an model boot made in the last ten years. It's just absurd. Also, ski shops don't have a special relationship with manufacturers as far as being able to buy things the public can't. If a company wants to sell something, they will sell it no matter who's asking.    The best solution and what I tell people all the time is when you buy a pair of boots, buy replacement heal and toe pieces then. They will definitely be available and then a few years down the road when you need them you won't have to try to find them."
skiing,38oxat,doghanded,3,Tue Jun 9 00:20:22 2015 UTC,Try emailing the manufacturer. It will probably cost like 15-20 bucks if they still have some on hand.

It was shot mostly at Crystal, but there's a line or two in there from Big Sky, Revy, Whistler, and the North Cascades. We rented an RV to escape the Washington winter - there's a few drone shots of it driving across Montana. Shralpental is right about the ski area with no snow at the beginning, it was hard to get through the winter with no post work sessions at Alp!"

skiing,38j3y3,paradigm99,10,Thu Jun 4 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"I've been at high altitude in CO quite a bit the last few weeks and there are wet slides everywhere in the mountains right now. Every aspect on nearly all slopes over ~35 degrees. We haven't had a good freeze thaw cycle for at least a week or two so it's especially touchy right now. To anyone out in the mountains in Colorado in the next week or two: be careful and don't venture into avalanche terrain, especially if it's warm and the snow is getting soft, it WILL slide, everything is."
skiing,38j3y3,Jrodicon,5,Thu Jun 4 17:55:28 2015 UTC,Yeah..This is a deep fracture line. Is that inbound? Was it open when it happened?
skiing,38j3y3,nriopel,10,Thu Jun 4 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"It's inbounds, but it's some of the most conservative control I've ever seen, which is probably correct for that face. It's great terrain, though!  This is Arapahoe Basin, by the way. Last mountain open in the Front Range of Colorado, and the skiing still doesn't suck in June.  EDIT: By ""conservative control"" I mean they don't let you on it if they don't have perfect visibility. It's above a basin that is generally accessed, so they have to be really careful. Not quite as bad as, say, Laramie Bowl at Jackson (a blue square situated directly below a cliff band, which is directly below a perfect avvy start zone), but still requires pretty solid control."
skiing,38j3y3,troglodyte,4,Thu Jun 4 16:27:59 2015 UTC,It was inbounds but the terrain was closed.   In 2005 a skier was killed inbounds on open terrain with the same exact conditions so ever since then they always make sure to close steep terrain  before these sorts of wet slides.

skiing,38j3y3,username_obnoxious,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:41:10 2015 UTC,Holy shit. And that's why you wear a beacon whenever you're in(or below) avalanche terrain. Even inbounds.
skiing,38j3y3,skwormin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"ok, how many people actually wear beacons inbounds? not me. I hiked the east wall I think 9 or 10 times last month. Never brought my beacon with me."
skiing,38j3y3,username_obnoxious,2,Thu Jun 4 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Depending where I'm skiing I will. I talked with a patroller at ABasin the day that they opened the east wall, about wearing beacons inbounds.  He said more and more people are wearing them inbounds when they're in risky terrain. He made the point that by the time they get a recco out there it's too late, and that all patrollers wear beacons.  My ortovox weighs weighs next to nothing and if I'm in the mountains it's in my car anyway. Why not just strap it on? I don't want to look like a dick for getting buried with my beacon in the car."
skiing,38j3y3,skwormin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:59:40 2015 UTC,"yeah true. But at least we have the comfort of knowing the avy dogs are there, and their search 'function' is better than any beacon I know :)"
skiing,38j3y3,DeathB4Download,2,Fri Jun 5 03:25:03 2015 UTC,Many Europeans wear beacons everyday.  Edit* The question was:   how many people actually wear beacons inbounds?   I answered that question. Quit with your semantics.
skiing,38j3y3,Timberline1,5,Fri Jun 5 00:40:06 2015 UTC,Because they generally do less avalanche control work than American resorts do. Not a fair comparison.
skiing,38j3y3,IrishBuckles,3,Fri Jun 5 00:55:42 2015 UTC,I think they do much less avalanche control off piste though so it's different.
skiing,38j3y3,jmt970,2,Fri Jun 5 00:55:59 2015 UTC,"Quit with your semantics.   Sometimes semantics are important. In this case using the term ""inbounds"" implies we are not talking about Europe because most European resorts don't really have in/out of bounds. If you go off-piste even within the resort area it's often uncontrolled and essentially out of bounds so of course you'd wear a beacon. And I know that you know this."
skiing,38j3y3,jmt970,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"If I'm skiing my home resort on a huge day, I wear mine because patrol will sometimes let you into roped off areas before everyone else if you're beeping.  I do not wear it for safety. You've got better odds of being struck by lightning while celebrating your powerball win than you do of getting killed by an avalanche while skiing in-bounds on open terrain."
skiing,38j3y3,skwormin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:47:53 2015 UTC,what? So you just run around and flash everyone your beacon all day? Just don't really see that happening/
skiing,38j3y3,jmt970,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"So you just run around and flash everyone your beacon all day?   No. You talk to patrol and they will tell you where/what time and then do a beacon check before they let you duck the rope. This only happens on very specific runs and may happen once or twice during an amazing season and basically everyone who is in the know is a local. They will also open the mountain before the scheduled season if we have the snow, and will not let you load until you do a beacon check and sign a waiver."

Several guys skinned right to the summit. There is only 1 slope just before the summit ridge where you might want traction and microspikes would probably do.  I left at about 5:30. I was moving pretty slowly though as my skis are heavy. People with skins did it in 2-3 hours easy.

Instead of focusing on technique I would work on being as fit as possible once ski season begins.   Get that leg and core strength and you'll be in a much better position that first day on the slopes. You'll get longer days with less potential for injury and shorter recovery times, which will lead to more hours on skis and more improvement in a shorter period of time.  If you're pressed for a fun adrenaline pumping sport in the heat of the summer season then rock climbing or mountain biking might be your calling : )"

skiing,388s2c,Twin_Tip,2,Tue Jun 2 18:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah this year was a bummer, especially for the Baker Ski area. I usually go a few days a year there but not this year. The Mt Baker ski area is next to Mt Shuksan which many people don't know. Mt Baker can be seen from the very top of the ski area lifts on a clear day but usually there are no clear days at Baker."
skiing,388s2c,Budge-O-Matic,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"I've only been to Baker a few times when I would visit my brother on Whidbey Island.  It's crazy to me to think of it not having any snow.  The couple times I went, there was so much base that the chairlifts would only be a foot or two off the ground/snow.  Unfortunately never had any fresh pow while I visited though.  One year the ski resort was closed because the lodge was literally buried under the snowfall.  Believe it was my freshman year of college in '96 b/c my dad sent me the newspaper clipping.  Edit:  I guess I was off by a few years.  Looking at wiki:  ""The ski area is home to the world's greatest recorded snowfall in one season, 1,140 inches (95.0 ft; 29.0 m), recorded during the 1998–99 season"".  So it was when I was in college, but not my freshman year."

skiing,385mze,neatopat,0,Tue Jun 2 21:10:29 2015 UTC,"It's really not necessary. If you just sit there you cannot fall out. The probability of something happening to cause you to fall out is basically non-existant. If you calculated the millions of people who safely ride a chairlift every year against the extremely rare accidents that happen, the chance of falling is basically 0%. Compare that to the number of people who die in car accidents each year and you should be terrified to get in your car and drive home."

skiing,385mze,neatopat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Yes it's nice you have to feel comfortable, but it's still not necessary. The chairs won't sway enough to dump you out. They can't. They're designed not to. Also, if winds are high enough the lift won't be open."

skiing,385mze,I_Call_It_Vera,3,Tue Jun 2 14:24:14 2015 UTC,"Where I've been skiing lately (Colorado) it seems that we don't use the bar when snowboarders are present.  Not because they want to be rebels or look cool by being unsafe, but I think it's a matter of comfort.  4-6 people crammed on a lift with the bar down (assuming foot rests) are a heck of a lot more comfortable with skis on than 4-6 people with snowboards.  The angle at which you need to sit with snowboards make it difficult for everyone to put their feet comfortably on the footrests attached to the safety bar.  At least, this is what I've been told.  I've never boarded a day in my life so I can't confirm from firsthand experience."

skiing,385mze,Ban_All_Gifs,6,Sat Jun 6 05:21:19 2015 UTC,"The bar is like a seat belt in a car. You probably won't need it, but if something bad happens or you do something stupid it's nice to have a safety device.  A strong gust of wind or a lift malfunction can also cause you to fall off."
skiing,385mze,neatopat,-5,Tue Jun 2 14:23:30 2015 UTC,"A strong gust of wind will not cause you to fall off. I've been on chairlifts in 60-80 mph winds plenty of times. You just hold on. It's not like the chair flips upside down or anything, and if that were the case, the bar wouldn't help. Also, the chance of a lift malfunction causing you to fall off is so low it's basically non-existent. People create fear where there is no reason for fear. Compare the statics of people who have fallen from a chairlift while sitting still and the number of people who die in their car every day. You should be terrified to drive your car, but you're not. If there's basically a 0% chance of me falling off a chairlift, then I'm not going to be afraid."

skiing,385mze,brokenshoelaces,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:38:19 2015 UTC,"You don't know how rare it is.  Statistics are not generally collected on falls from chairlifts unless it's due to mechanical failure.  Colorado is the only state that requires it.  And obviously it's in the resorts' best interests not to publicize such incidents.  According to this document, you're about 9x less likely to die from a chairlift fall than a car accident, but that only includes reported incidents (i.e. mostly mechanical issues).  The document goes on to say ""human error is the cause of most falls from ski lifts"".  http://www.missionridge.com/sites/default/files/NSAA%20Lift%20Safety%20Fact%20Sheet%2001.2012.pdf  So, given that fatalities due to human error are far more common than mechanical accident, and given that those fatalities are mostly people not using the bar, it's likely that riding a lift without the bar is on par with or worse than your chance of dying in a car accident.  That is FAR from ""basically non-existent"" -- way too many people die in car accidents.  So yeah, the odds of falling are very low, but it happens, I'm going to keep using the bar every time."

So while you're right in saying that having the bar down isn't a license to be an idiot, he didn't seem to take the minimum steps to try guarantee his safety - acting like an idiot or not."
skiing,385mze,neatopat,-9,Tue Jun 2 06:56:48 2015 UTC,Putting the bar down is in no way a guarantee of your safety. The lack of a bar didn't cause him to fall. Him goofing off and trying to throw snowballs caused him to fall. The bar is irrelevant.

So yes, the bar is completely relevant in this case.  Had it been down, it would have prevented him from falling forwards even while acting like an idiot."
skiing,385mze,PigSlam,2,Tue Jun 2 08:03:42 2015 UTC,"So was it the not putting the bar down that caused the fall, or the throwing of the snowball?"
skiing,385mze,Possum_Pendulum,2,Tue Jun 2 16:47:36 2015 UTC,It was a combination of both obviously.
skiing,385mze,neatopat,0,Tue Jun 2 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"He fell because he's an idiot and tried to throw a snowball. What you're saying is if I drive my car 150mph and crash and I'm not wearing my seatbelt, I crashed because I wasn't wearing my seatbelt. No, I crashed because I was driving like an idiot. He didn't fall because he didn't put the bar down, he fell because he's an idiot."
skiing,385mze,startibartfast,3,Tue Jun 2 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"Nope, what we're saying is that given the fact that you're already crashing, it would be better at this point to have a seatbelt on, but it's also too late to put one on. The bar reduces the number of actions that can potentially lead to you falling, thus increasing your safety.   Anything you can safely do on a lift with the bar up you can also safely do with the bar down. Some things you can safely do with the bar down that will cause death if you do them with the bar up. Now, I know you'll just say you shouldn't be doing those silly things with the bar up. But accidents happen. And when they happen with the bar up, you fall. Keep in mind, you wouldn't try to crash your car, with or without your seat-belt on. But if it does happen to crash, you'd sure be glad you had the bar down.  Also foot rests. I'd put it down for the footrests even without the safety factor. People who don't put it down are just delusional, and I'm convinced they're doing it solely for appearances sake."

skiing,385mze,0sr0,0,Tue Jun 2 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure I agree, I think you can do things while also trying to guarantee your safety as much as possible within the realm of that activity.  For example, the person who doesn't put on his seatbelt on in a car isn't trying to guarantee their safety, but it doesn't mean driving is the issue."
skiing,385mze,PigSlam,0,Tue Jun 2 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you understand the term ""guarantee"" very well.   You can't guarantee safety, at least not without a lot of qualification.  There are risks, and you can mitigate those risks with things like seatbelts and safety bars, but you can never guarantee safety.  I can guarantee that I will never die from a skiing accident by never going anywhere close to a skier, I suppose, but wearing a helmet or using the bar is in no way a guarantee, they're precautions."

In fact, I'm losing respect for this sub because of how numbskulled its inhabitants are (wrt this issue in particular). It's like offering a choice between safe-ish and safer at no extra cost and they consistently don't want to be safer. Just fucking retarded. The only reason to have the bar up is to get on and off. If you're on, and don't want to be off, then the bar should be down. No brainer."

skiing,385mze,neatopat,-4,Tue Jun 2 18:52:55 2015 UTC,No logic can support the need for a bar. If you just sit still you cannot and will not fall. The fear of falling from a chairlift is an irrational fear unless you do something stupid to cause it.    I have yet to hear one argument or situation where a bar would prevent someone from falling when they otherwise wouldn't have. Every single time there is a chairlift accident it is the riders fault. My dad investigated ski accidents for a living. He doesn't put the bar down because he knows it's pointless.
skiing,385mze,walkaboutman888,0,Tue Jun 2 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"Every single time there is a chairlift accident it is the riders fault   This would have to be the single stupidest argument for not using the bar when it's there. By this logic, you shouldn't wear a helmet because its the skiers own fault if they have an accident. Or don't wear a seatbelt when you're driving in the desert because any accident will be your own fault."
skiing,385mze,neatopat,0,Fri Jun 5 11:01:39 2015 UTC,"Stop comparing it to a seatbelt. When over a million people a year die on chairlifts, then you can talk about seatbelts. Until then, they are in no way comparable.    You're just supporting my argument. It's a personal choice that only affects that person and is their own fault, which is why bars aren't mandatory, helmets are not mandatory, and in some places seatbelt are not mandatory. If it doesn't affect you, then mind your own business and leave us alone. Some ski areas don't even have bars. They do fine and no one ever gets hurt. You know why? Because when there's no bar people are smart enough to sit there and not fuck off and it's literally impossible to fall. If you're stupid enough to try and throw snowballs on a chair lift, it's just a matter of time before you hurt yourself doing something else just as stupid."

The 13 resorts within 30-45 mins of the downtown area typically get 50-100% more annual snowfall than the colorado resorts, are easier to access and have more interesting, diverse and technical terrain.  I would suggest either staying in the city and trying out snowbird/alta, brighton, solitude and snowbasin or staying in Park City and doing deer valley, PC and the Canyons.  Furthermore, lift tickets in utah (and accommodations in SLC) are considerably less than in Colorado and resorts are less crowded/shorter lift lines."

Not sure if the snowfall will be as lackluster next year as it was this year, but I'd ignore Park City and head to Little Cottonwood and Big Cottonwood (Alta, Snowbird, Brighton, Solitude). Rent a house, stay at the resorts or find a cheapo hotel in south salt lake valley if you're on a budget. Park City resorts have less snowpack, less inspiring terrain, and Park City nightlife just can't compete with Salt Lake anymore.

If you are concerned that 108 is a lil bit too wide you can wait a couple of months the new sfb to hit stores. It is shrinking to 104 under foot.  I have the wider mr pollards opus and at 118 it actually performed very well on some very firm groomers.

We get a lot of ice and hardpack on groomers and they can still carve like a dream. It helps to have a really wide binding, like a Salomon Guardian.   It's not a ""traditional"" east coast ski but I would totally recommend it, especially since you spend most of your time in trees."
skiing,38830i,encryptedinformation,2,Tue Jun 2 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"Michigan skier here, picked up a pair of the 2015 SFB in a 186 this past season. (I am 6 ft, 185lbs, and prefer all mountain skiing) I would sleep with them if i didn't think I'd cut myself in the middle of the night. I work at a shop, so I always had access to wax and an edge tuner to keep the friction down on such a fat ski. Edge to edge the boards are actually very responsive, props to the camber underfoot. There was never a day here in the midwest where I would have wanted any other/narrower ski. I also took them out west skiing Vail, Breckenridge, Snowbird, and Alta this past season. Utah was lacking in snow but the crud was nothing to worry about, and on a nice powder day in Colorado I fell in love. So playful. As for the next years SFB, I had an opportunity to ride it at a test day at Boyne, they were extremely light with the new core, however I don't think that it compromised the stiffness at all, never got any chatter going breakneck.. just wish I could have taken them through some fresh.

I thoroughly enjoyed them all season long! Evo had a great deal on them and I jumped on it right away.  They are 92 under foot with a traditional camber.. which for me was the ideal design due to the fact that my hills are 90% ice. Just a suggestion.

If the snow is soft they are awesome. You can really get them on edge and dig in to your turns, and they are very playful in pow or through moguls and trees.   You will probably not enjoy them on icy, slick, hard packed, firm conditions because of the rocker design. They are chattery and feel like they are about to lose an edge which is not ideal when you are charging and need the confidence to set the edge and hold it through the turn."

I'm not sure about the U.P. but anywhere I've gone out east, I absolutely prefer a less rockered ski. For example, I skied the Volkl Bridge (similar ski) and absolutely loved it in Colorado. The Bridges were absolutely money through the backwoods and park. Then I started carving at high speeds and they shook way too much and it took far too much energy to keep them stabilized. That was enough for me considering you don't lose much in the backwoods with a less rockered all-mountain ski similar to the Rossi experience series."
skiing,38830i,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"I live in Ohio (my local shithill is Perfect North, and occasionally Mad River) and I bought Gotamas a few years ago to be my ""out west ski"".  Before long I was just skiing the goats every day because I got used to the width and started to like it.  That being said, I'm 6'6"" and 215, so I probably deal with their heft better than somebody smaller.  Are they the ""right tool for the job"" here?  Hell no, but it also means when I go out west the few times a year I make it, I don't have to re-adjust to my skis.  To me that's worth it.  My point with all of this is that No, I would not disqualify a ski just because of its width unless it was something absolutely crazy wide with 0 sidecut that was strictly a powder pontoon."
skiing,38830i,lazy_legs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:58:57 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, no.  I spent an entire season on them in PA, and absolutely loved it.  I'm 6'0"" 180lbs and ride the 184s.  Would have gone bigger, but I was getting them at a killer price, and the 184 was it.  They are perfect for the kind of skiing I like to do.  Mine are mounted dead center (I think that's about +2-3) with STH drivers.  They spin wonderfully, the tips are pretty light, so you spin the ski instead of the ski spinning you.  Really playful, they love to be buttered all over the place, but can you can still get a hell of an edge with them.  They do tend to wash out a bit if you don't land bigger park jumps near perfectly.    TL;DR- They ripped the shit out of the East Coast."

I wanted to bathe in chapstick before stepping outside. Probably the only time I've ever wanted to stop skiing due to the cold... but didn't because there were no lift lines.  The thing that bothered me the most was the lack of grocery stores / supermarkets.

We enjoyed both towns more than Summit County, mainly due to the more local, less crowded vibe.  I really think you should look at Telluride. A bit on the posh side, but 800k should get you something very nice in the Mountain Village area, which has bars and restaurants, and there is a free gondola into the historic town on the other side of the mountain where the best restaurants are. I think the gondola runs to midnight. Could probably get something in town, too.  Crested Butte had a very lively nightlife, and it seemed like a hipper, younger crowd. Much more affordable and the skiing was also fantastic. But the town is down the mountain, about 5-10 minute drive, so no walking from the lifts to your place."

skiing,386mak,jmt970,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:31:14 2015 UTC,"Bend is our winter destination this year. I'm pretty excited about it, but my fiance is skeptical. We've been watching youtube videos about Mt. Bachelor and it always looks empty. I've been told by many, that its just a fortunate coincidence, and not because the Mt. is bad. We're hoping to stay in Bend and rent an RV to take to Bachelor on the days we decide to ski for downtime and meals. Any idea what it'll be like trying to drive an RV from Bend to Bachelor everyday in worst case scenario weather?"
skiing,386mak,McTonkey,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"Mt. Bachelor is about 20-30 minutes from Bend on a well maintained road. The road is not steep and has enough places to pass that driving an RV is no problem (I've done it many times). There is a place for parking you rig in the lot overnight, but they do charge now a days (not sure how much). There are public coin operated showers available. No nightlife on the mountain, though. But plenty to do in Bend- good restaurants and more brewpubs than anyplace I've been, except maybe Portland.  Bachelor is sorta big - not Breckenridge big - and has enough lifts so people spread out pretty well. Although I don't ski there on the weekends anymore, powder days do bring out the crowds. I find that a lot of folks take off after a few laps in the morning, when most of the easy pickings have been shredded.  Bad weather can be an issue and if it is windy or a whiteout, the Summit lift won't be open. That makes the other lifts there more crowded.  I think you will like Bend and Bachelor. It is also great in the summer if you like mt. biking, hiking, rafting, etc. The down side is that the Bachelor isn't very steep (nickname is Flatchelor) and you have a drive back and forth to the hill everyday since there are no accommodations in walking distance.  good luck in your search. also check out Lake Tahoe. Although they have had a few poor years snow wise, it' still gorgeous and has a lot to offer."

Skydiving is not at all physically taxing (unless you have some sort of medical condition). Mentally, that depends on if you're afraid of heights/jumping out of a plane. For most people, no, it's not taxing. You can easily skydive in the morning and have the rest of the day to do things/sleep if you're that way inclined."

About a minute after the parachute deployed she was ready to do have brunch and get loaded on bloody marries.  Outside the U.S. It might be different but they were required to do tandem dives because they have never been before so the guide (not sure what you call the guy strapped to your back) did all the work.

Also from my experiences with Queenstown, money, not energy, is the limiting factor. Hell see if you can fit in a trip on the Shotover jet on the off day too, skiidiving should only be a couple hours.  If it all gets too much it isn't a hassle to take a day off, a lot of the mountains have the ski 4 days out of five or whatever passes too."

skiing,37zrda,timstock7,14,Wed Jun 3 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"Basically every ski sold today is a single-quiver, powder-oriented, all-mountain ski with a ~100mm waist and a rocker-camber-rocker profile. It's at the point where this question makes a lot of us roll our eyes - you're going to have an enormous list of options.  That being said, you're tiny, so there's a few things you can look for in a ski. Specifically, you're going to want to avoid metal topsheets. Unless you have thighs of steel, you'll probably find skis like the Blizzard Bonafide or Brahma to be a little hard to flex.   Your height basically limits you to the shortest men's skis you can get, which is alright - you don't want something long in the trees and the bumps.  Stick with something with lots of wood, and you'll probably have a lot more success. When you go to your favourite ski shop, the sales associate will be able to fill you in on what they've got. Demo a shitload, and buy the one you like the best.  My honest advice, though, is to save up and buy two pairs of skis. One for trees/powder days, and one for groomer days. All-mountain skis kind of suck if they're too focused on being a jack of all trades."
skiing,37zrda,otwall,2,Sun May 31 20:05:23 2015 UTC,"I do have a pair of east coast skis with a 79mm underfoot, so I likely have the groomers covered, it's just I'm kinda nervous about jumping on a 115mm+ underfoot after skiing the ice coast my entire life. I also feel like having two skis on both sides of the extremes (and nothing in between) could be frustrating. What do you think?"
skiing,37zrda,inqurious,4,Sun May 31 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"YMMV, but I learned on the ice coast from age 5 to 25 when I moved to California. Can still carve on my 112-underfoot because of learning on the ice coast."
skiing,37zrda,otwall,2,Sun May 31 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"If you're intimidated by fat skis, it's totally fine to grab ""thinner"" ones.  Personally, I think anyone skiing fatter than 115 is compensating for poor skill, but that's just me.  You've already got great groomer skis, now buy a rockered, slidy, 110 ski. You'll adore it in the trees and on storm days.  It'll be terrible on groomers, but that's why you just bring both skis with you and swap out in the parking lot if you decide to switch to groomers halfway through your day.  All-mountain skis are basically chattery on groomers and too carvy in trees and bumps. They're like a solid C+ at all times. Great if you're on a budget, if your days are all over the hill, or if you just don't want to handle multiple skis and the hassle that comes with a quiver.  Learning how to slide/slarve also takes like a day so fat powder skis don't have much of a learning curve."

skiing,37zrda,Sheldonconch,1 point,Sun May 31 22:50:33 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to commit, yeah. You have to be okay with a ski that's useless outside of powder though!"
skiing,37zrda,Sheldonconch,1 point,Sun May 31 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"I have not noticed any downside to the width. I wouldn't personally go below 110 in ski width, and I think my current ski is 126. I think camber makes a bigger difference than width for float though.  I don't think full rocker is absolutely necessary as long as it has a ton of rocker in the tip (and tail if you ski backwards). And I mean it has to start curving up just in front of the boot. For float I think you need a good foot or two of scoop in the front, and it needs to curve up a good few inches. With all that being said, I use full rocker skis. Love them. I went a bit stiffer than the Line EP Pros that I was on before so that I can land bigger drops with more stability. I ski mostly powder.  My EP Pros and My Surface New Life float a ton better than the K2 Pettitors I had for a while. Not sure how much of that is camber and how much is width.  Be bold. Follow the advice here and don't be afraid to go for a fat reverse camber ski. That was my biggest mistake when I was first making the transition that you are making now. I went halfway and ended up with a couple skis that were okay, but not that great for what I was going for. Don't do that mistake and end up with the ski of your dreams in 3 years. Just make the jump and do it now.  So after that ramble, my final advice I ended up at is go with a ski that is at least 110 underfoot and full reverse camber or damn close to it. Seriously don't fuck up, you won't regret it. Check out praxis skis, they break down the dimensions like most ski companies don't. These GPO might be up your alley. http://www.praxisskis.com/products/gpo-standard-edition.html The Billy Goats are a staple: http://www.on3pskis.com/skis/billygoat/ I have the New Lifes, and really like them, I think these took their place: http://www.surfaceskis.com/hardgoods/freeride/balance/index.html  Good luck.

skiing,37zrda,powen01,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like they are a good combination of charging ability and tight tree skiing that I want, and at 117 underfoot I think they'll handle the pow pretty well. Just wanted your take on them.   It looks decent with two caveats. 1 is that the tip (and tail if you ski backwards) rocker is not quite long enough. This is the biggest thing that will give you float in powder and make you love life, go huge, and hug puppies on a powder day. The key stat here is the ""tip rocker"" of 35cm. That is how far back from the tip it starts to curve upward. This directly translates to how much float you will have which means how much you will be on top of the snow and feel like you are flying. It has just over a foot in front and under a foot in back. A little more than that would make a big difference. I would look for something more like 40-60. I googled a review to find a closer look at the camber profile and read this one: http://earlyups.com/gear-praxis-concept-187-review/  His one suggestion agreed with my initial reaction. An extra 10 cm of rocker. It needs a longer scoop in front to float like a butterfly.  With that said, that foot curve will be better than any skis you've probably had, but like I said, don't be a pussy. Go for it and you'll love skiing on a pow ski.  The other sticking point is they are throwing some new designs in this ski attempting to ""have it all"" and be good at everything. It has two regular camber areas in front and behind the boots, and reverse camber (rocker) in the tip, tail, and in the middle. They also give it some reverseyish sidecut I guess. Normal sidecut on a ski looks like this )( , but someone came up with a pow ski that is shaped like an oval instead of an hourglass like this () . I guess it is pretty fun for pow turns. Well anyways, with all this going on, it seems like they are testing and trying to make it too much of a hybrid. Usually when ski companies do this, the idea doesn't ski how they thought it would, and it is scrapped. Or (like reverse camber) it makes everything so much better and every ski adopts it. Would I love to have this ski? Yes, absolutely. Would I love skiing on it, yeah most likely. But I probably wouldn't get this ski without testing it. I may feel it doesn't have as good of float as I like and other little things.  With all that said, the reviewer seemed to like it all around, aside from a couple drawbacks because of the ski design trying to do everything so not doing one thing super well.  Will it be your favorite ski you have ever skied on? I'd wager yes. Will you get a different pair in a couple of years and kick yourself for not getting something with longer tip and tail rocker in the first place? Yep I think so. Good luck!"

The 102 underfoot keeps you at a good depth, IMO, but I'm 6 inches and 60 lbs over you.  I don't understand skiing a 115 and being so ""on top"" of the snow you can't tell if there's 3 inches or 3 feet of powder.

Cant count how many times I've been teaching race carving on these pair of skies on a powder day, just to go right into the powder after work.  The sidecut and the rocker makes the ski able to turn in everything like moguls and trees.

skiing,37udj8,Jibjumper,4,Sat May 30 16:46:49 2015 UTC,"Just a quick tip to help with that. Use your poles even when you don't feel like you need to. At first it's going to feel super exaggerated, and really at first you probably should exaggerate it to get used to the feeling. You don't always need a hard plant, but if you consciously start your turns by extending and planting, you'll find you're able to turn quicker and more often. It really helps to clean up your form and will turn decent looking skiers into someone who looks like they know what they're doing. You'll also find the more you use your poles the more comfortable you'll feel making turns at speed on steep stuff. It's all mental game and the act of extending your arm before your turn starts really will take your skiing to the next level."

The whole thing for poles on piste is it forces you to have your hands up/out in front of you and reaching for turns which is important no matter what terrain or speed you are going.  The pole plant really initiates the turn and if you can do it naturally without thinking on piste, it will help you off piste in a big way.   Huge turns in powder... definitely one of the best feelings out there."

I live a solid 4 hour drive from anything real and a flight away from what I like to ski so I feel your pain.  Over in the states we have a few options for some great ski camps focused on learning off piste technique.   Gordy Peifer runs one called 'Straight Line Adventures' and there is another run out of Jackson Hole called 'Steep and Deep.'   See if you can find something like that in Europe and you'll see a huge return over the course of a few days on the slopes.     Another idea is have your friends video tape you so you can see your own technique, maybe even post it here asking for critique while you're on your trip, to find things you can work on.

When you are doing quick cuts like that usually you're cutting to the chase or the raison d'etre.  I personally found it distracting.  When I edit, I'm typically saving music synchronized shots for key action scenes to provide more emphasis.  When it's overused it can be a smidge distracting.  Glad you got out to the Alps and had some good weather.  Keep it up!  The longer you're on snow the more easy the turns and jumps get.  A lot of us have been doing it since we were children.  I'm teaching my wife and learning later in life has a lot of disadvantages.  Don't give up- it's a life sport and you can find a million ways to enjoy skiing.  Cheers!"

On the tough areas you have to brake and control your decent, you can't just bomb down the mountain. Once you start to play the game as a sim instead of an arcade game it becomes a lot better. If you're on the top of the mountain and not constantly turning/braking then you're probably not playing it as intended. I was also annoyed by the rocks/crashes until I changed how I viewed the game."

You need to hit such narrow spots way faster with far less turns. I think of it like this, once im in a narrow spot, i like to get out of it, because their is no escape, your smack dab in the middle, the snow from either side will naturally pull towards you, if it begins to slide you are in for the ride. So if you hit such a feature, gun it!"

skiing,37ur46,tylrwnzl,2,Sat May 30 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"This sounds about right. I was down there on a lower snow year and had plenty of fun but some terrain was closed due to the lack of snow. I skied The Remarkables, Coronet Peak, Cardrona and Treble Cone. I spent the most time at Treble Cone as the snow was best there off the quad. I didn't have many problems with crowds anywhere but the roads up to The Remarks and TC were harrowing particularly after overnight snow.   I'd say best terrain was probably at the Remarks but required a bit of hiking from the top of the lifts and if you're touring TC would be a great place to start from. Coronet and Cardrona were quite boring and fairly flat so unless you want park features I'd avoid.  I wanted to but didn't end up trying any club fields mostly because it seemed like such a huge hassle all the way around (nutcrackers, lodging, hikes to/from the lodges, etc.) Plus you have to leave you car down in the valley in an obvious place for car prowlers.  NZ is a great place to ski, I would recommend it to anyone but don't go expecting USA style and sized resorts and amenities or you'll be disappointed."

skiing,37sdcf,BootsieHamilton,1 point,Sat May 30 11:24:58 2015 UTC,"Great little article. Ive been to ARG many times and I would also suggest flying into Mendoza, usually a connection through Santiago. Mendoza is really fun and a lot more manageable than B.A. You can also find a lot of outdoor gear there as it is the jumping off point for Aconcagua trips. The busses in Argentina are really nice and quite reasonable. Also, if there is enough snow, a day trip out to Penitenties, a small ski resort, will do really well for acclimatizing to the altitudes. You can get well over 3000M there. If you are coming rom sea level this will really help once you get on the glaciers. I would not recommend buying any gear down there though unless it is an emergency."

skiing,37mbts,Bsaariaho,5,Thu May 28 17:52:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it just comes down to your own experience.  Basically set it as low as you can where it won't always pre-release on you.  It sounds like you should start at 11.  If you ski a season and they don't pop out on you unless you fall or do a weird/awkward maneuver, then you're probably good and can maybe even goto 10.5 or 10.  If you are popping out in middle of turns, crank it up to 11.5, then 12 and so on until you get to a point where that stops happening.   Part of it is personal preference too....depending on how skilled and how confident you are with regards to recovery maneuvers."
skiing,37mbts,majortato,1 point,Thu May 28 18:03:18 2015 UTC,Probably depends on snow conditions as well.  I didn't pop out all year at 8 but did some spring skiing and popped out twice in three runs.  Had to crank it up to 9.5 to make sure I stayed in during hard turns in heavy snow/slush.
skiing,37mbts,tartay745,1 point,Thu May 28 18:54:03 2015 UTC,sounds like you need to get some proper wax on your skis for those conditions.  ;-)
skiing,37mbts,majortato,1 point,Thu May 28 19:00:39 2015 UTC,That's probably some of it too. To damn lazy to wax them lately.  Should probably get warm weather wax instead of all temp.
skiing,37mbts,tartay745,1 point,Thu May 28 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"When you're in bounds not going nuts, just lower your din until it pre-releases too much, then increase it a little. I'd rather have a few pre-releases than a non-release unless I'm in some serious no-fall zone, and by then I should have it dialed in."
skiing,37mbts,kbergstr,1 point,Thu May 28 21:38:56 2015 UTC,"I've only fallen 3 or 4 times in the past 100 or so ski days and only 1 of them was at all serious but that 1 was a pretty close call for 1 of my knees (first time in Utah, torpedoed my skis into so heavy snow and one foot was caught so it didn't release) so I'm not too worried about falling :)"
skiing,37mbts,majortato,1 point,Thu May 28 22:26:52 2015 UTC,"Well it sounds like you haven't really pre-released then either.  Which means whatever DIN you currently have set is either good or too high, so I would go lower and if you start pre-releasing when you shouldn't, start moving it up by 0.5.  Another part of it is also what type of terrain and speeds you ski at in general.  For example, if you're racing or going over some serious gnarly terrain, it's more dangerous for the skis to pre-release, so I would error towards having it a bit higher (what's worse, a twisted knee because your bindings didn't release when you fell or a broken head because the ski popped off when you accidentally jammed too hard into an ice mogul and you went tumbling down the side of the mountain?).  On the other hand, if you're mostly skiing groomers and not in a race course, a pre-release probably just means a spectacular fall and a bruised ego, highly unlikely to result in serious injury, so erroring towards a lower DIN is better."

skiing,37mbts,Hobbez_,1 point,Fri May 29 02:12:35 2015 UTC,"What's the advantage of setting it lower? Of course, being able to release during a fall. But besides that, does a lower din give any benefits to performance?"
skiing,37mbts,jmt970,2,Mon Jun 1 16:03:20 2015 UTC,"There's no performance benefit or detriment.  The advantage is that it reduces risk of injury if you do fall.  You want that ski to pop off as easily as possible when you fall.  If the ski stays on while you're tumbling down the hill, you can really screw up your knees and more.  Obviously, if you set the DIN too low, it might pop off due to a high speed turn or if you're skiing rough terrain.  In those situations, it could cause you to crash when you shouldn't have.  That's why it's important for you to find the happy medium where the ski stays on when you want it to and the bindings release when you want them to."

From Wikipedia:  On 29 April 2012, the main building of the Ski Village was destroyed by a fire. The blaze occurred in the early hours of the morning and no-one was injured. This fire was subsequently ruled to have started accidentally, with subsequent fires on the site being treated as arson.[5]  On 1 May 2012, a small hut at the top of the main slope containing controls for the ski lifts was destroyed in a second fire in the early hours of the morning.[6]  On 21 May 2012, the former snowflex nursery slope was partially destroyed in a third fire, again started deliberately.[7]  On 24 April 2013, the remaining wooden outbuildings of the former Adventure Mountain outdoor playground were set on fire, destroying the only remaining infrastructure on the site.[8]  Since the initial fire, the site has remained closed to the public aside from a brief attempt by the Sharks Ski Club to hold sessions in May 2012,[9] which were stopped when the ski lift motors and power ancillaries were stolen. The site has stood derelict and has been blighted by significant fly tipping, theft and vandalism ever since.[10]"

skiing,37els0,chronorunner,7,Wed May 27 01:41:44 2015 UTC,"I used to tune skis for a shop in Colorado, and my experience is that waxing skis is trivially easy. All you need is a work space, some wax, a cheap-o iron and a straight piece of plastic to scrape the wax off. Tuning skis by hand took a lot of practice and skill and if you did it wrong you could really make a ski perform poorly.  I think you can learn to wax a ski watching a video on youtube or what have you, tuning a ski I recommend you get a tutor or leave it to the pros.  This video is a fair reflection of how we did it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-XCWhvStd4"
skiing,37els0,myshkingfh,2,Wed May 27 02:14:20 2015 UTC,"So wax your own,  but let a pro do the edges?  How important is it to match wax to temperature?"
skiing,37els0,RepDetec,6,Wed May 27 02:29:34 2015 UTC,"Matching temperature isn't all that important for a casual skier. If you have a warm weather wax on when it's 0 degrees out and vice versa, you're going to notice. Otherwise, not so much. I ski around 100 days a year. There's no way I could match wax temperature for any significant number of days, so I stopped caring. All temperature wax these days is pretty good and what I use probably half the time. Otherwise, I'm using wax for what is an average day (usually somewhere in the 10-30F range). I've also found that temperatures can vary so much that it's almost pointless to match it. It could be 0 degrees in the morning, 30-40 degrees in the middle of the day, and 10-20 degrees in the afternoon as the sun gets low. My advice is don't think into it too much. Choose based on the average conditions you're going to be skiing in. Unless you're racing and trying to shed time, you're not going to notice much."
skiing,37els0,neatopat,1 point,Wed May 27 02:44:35 2015 UTC,How important is a digital iron?  Is it really that easy to burn my base?
skiing,37els0,RepDetec,3,Wed May 27 03:30:48 2015 UTC,"We used literally the cheapest iron available because it didn't have any steam cents to worry about. We never worried about the temperature but like it says in the video, if your wax is smoking, turn down the temperature.   For a scraper the wax companies would give them to us but a piece of plexiglass worked just as well. Problem is you want them to stay sharp and they can dull quickly. We could sharpen them back up on our tuning belt but that's probably not as easy in a garage."
skiing,37els0,myshkingfh,-1,Wed May 27 04:12:15 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much impossible to burn your base unless you hold the iron in one spot for a really long time. Also, the iron will be too hot for the wax and burn it before it's hot enough to burn your base.    A digital iron isn't for protecting the base. It's for melting wax at the right temperature. Different waxes will have different melting points (turns to liquid) and flash points (burns). It's easy to tell without a thermometer. If your wax isn't dripping, it's not hot enough. If it's smoking, it's too hot. Generally a ski waxing iron will have better temperature control, a flat even base, and be smaller and lighter. People definitely use shitty clothes irons and they work fine.   As already mentioned, waxing is pretty simple and really hard to screw up. Tuning (edges, base repairs, base structure) isn't difficult, but requires some training and practice to get it right and you probably don't want to screw up on your own skis. Also, just about every shop these days will have machines that can do a far better job than humans."
skiing,37els0,neatopat,1 point,Wed May 27 05:49:16 2015 UTC,"That's what I recommend. You can get a stone and deburr edges on your own but the guy below who goes into detail should give you some taste of what you're getting into trying to tune without a tutor. It's complicated, there can be a lot of gear, and you can fuck up your skis.   The guy talking about wax temperatures has it right too. You're not racing so just get a general purpose wax that is in the ballpark of a typical day. If your wax says something like 10-30° F you'll probably never notice that it's not quite right. I might switch to a spring wax if the snow is melting as you ski over it, but that's probably just lilly-gilding.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0feWN6hIH2w"

skiing,37els0,Maladjusted_vagabond,5,Wed May 27 04:23:31 2015 UTC,"There are basically three ways you can look at it. 1. Pay someone to do it all. 2. Pay someone once a season for a base grind etc and maintaining with waxing and edging yourself. 3. Do it all yourself.   If you want to tune your skis yourself, and do a really good job you need to get a range of tools and stuff. If you go down this route, I'd still suggest getting a base grind once or twice a season, depending on how much you're actually skiing. But that means bevels of varying degrees for your both side and base edges, good files, diamond files, and you can even use base flatteners to eliminate most of the need for base grinds etc, and really do it all by hand.  I like these side bevels from Kuu, they come in a variety of angles so work out the type of beveling you want for the type of skiing you do. Google for guides on ski beveling. I also think doing the base edges really compliments beveling the sides, that being said if you do the bases you have to makes sure your ski bases are flat and structured. That means grinding or Base Flatteners allow you to achieve it. As for base edge bevelers I'm a fan of this one from Ski man, but these from SVST are good too. Some diamond files are essential too. I use the 100 grit (black) for the initial bevel and then the 400 grit (yellow) to finish. You also need a gummie stone and steel file for any big burs or gouges in the edges, they can be bought at any hardware. Like I said you don't want to be using the steel file to often otherwise you will quickly run out of edge. That's why you use the diamonds files, but even so you don't really want to be doing it everyday.  Waxing is pretty straight forward, make sure you have and iron that you can control temperature, but any iron will work, it doesn't have to be a waxing iron. Do some research about how different types of wax works and figure out what is best for you.   You can shop around for the best prices for all that gear, those links were just the first on google.  There are other bits and pieces you'll need especially if you want to do any major repairs of de-laminations, core shots etc in the future. But those things I listed would be my go to for maintenance.   You need to learn how to do it all properly though, you can fuck things up if you get it wrong. So practice on an old pair of skis or get someone who knows what they're doing to physically teach you."

skiing,3792ae,MonsieurBishop,6,Mon May 25 21:36:06 2015 UTC,I quit college before I failed as a junior in mechanical engineering. I went out to Tahoe and lived in an rv in Truckee with my gf who had never skied and we both have never been happier. We are back in Chicago for the summer because I run a small business and make enough basically retire for the winter if we save a lot. We actually have jobs for the month of October in Colorado on a legal pot farm (We worked there for a bit after this ski season) and it pays amazingly then are gonna go live by Monarch Ski resort for the winter and get season passes. The only reasons we are leaving Tahoe is that they tend to get less snow and the cost of living is crazy expensive compared to Colorado. On the other hand there's not much work in rural Colorado so you have to have savings. We actually worked at Northstar ski resort this past winter too haha I was on the snow tubing hill and a little bit of lift ops and was the worst job I had ever worked actually... In terms of pay and boringness... and watching people ski while you are at work... I got two hours of skiing before work on weekdays though so that was nice. But yeah I have never been happier either other than being a ski bum. Keep on living the dream!!!

You get a season pass and can even get rental skis or a board for the season if you work lift ops. I know people who lived in their vehicle but once you are out there you will figure it out. I suggest not working lift ops just because it doesn't allow you to ski as much as a night job but everyones gotta start somewhere!

skiing,37acaq,afraxine,9,Tue May 26 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"It makes for a good home base, though. It's close (by Canada standards, at least) to Fernie, Kimberly, Revelstoke, Kicking Horse, etc. Revvy has awesome back country, and kicking horse provides great technical terrain.   I still prefer sunshine, mostly because it's an hour's drive from my house. Fernie is my absolute favourite, but the snow just didn't happen this year. I could see myself falling in love with Revvy, and I see the potential in Kicking Horse, but have never caught it with great snow."
skiing,37acaq,looples,0,Tue May 26 04:32:57 2015 UTC,Revelstoke is a pretty advanced hill even by west coast standards. The altitude alone kicked my ass for sure.   Still had a blast conqeuring the terrain though. Definitely wish I went near the end of the season rather than the very beginning
skiing,37acaq,ski_bum,3,Tue May 26 06:34:49 2015 UTC,"Sunshine and Louise are consistent. The snow quality is very good, and it rarely ever gets into a freeze-thaw cycle December through March. You will not get the quantity of snow however. 30 feet is an all time year for Sunshine. They hit around 15-17 feet this year, which was below average, but not awful. An average year will be in the mid 20s. Revy hit 30 feet this year, and it was a rough year. However, mid season rain and freeze-thaw crust below the stoke chair are almost common in Revy. The terrain is much bigger and better gladed skiing overall. Hitting banff for the year isn't a bad call. You can rock sunny and the lake on the average days, and make short trips to revy and kicking horse for the all time days."
skiing,37acaq,ski_bum,1 point,Tue May 26 04:37:55 2015 UTC,The thing is I'm not gonna be driving (I don't think). So what's the bus/train/shuttle situation in banff? Also how many people live there in the winter? I hear it has decent nightlife?
skiing,37acaq,hillsanddales,1 point,Tue May 26 04:42:23 2015 UTC,"Nightlife in Banff will be better than Revy. Lots of locals, and tons of tourists. There's quite a few solid bars on that are loads of fun. I actually like the nightlife in Revy, but its much different. Much more of a local vibe compared to the tourists (lots of Calgarians go to banff for weekend party trips). It is quite a bit quieter though. Also Revy is still a blue collar working town, and probably attracts more sledders than skiiers for tourists. The motels there are jammed with Alberta famers coming out to sled a lot of times. Buses are good in Banff from what I hear, but I've never taken one. If it was me, and I had one season with no car, I'd hit Revy though. Sunshine and the Lake might get 3-5 amazing days a year, whereas Revy will get 10+"
skiing,37acaq,ski_bum,2,Tue May 26 04:48:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I'd break the decision down into 3 sections: snow, terrain, location.   For more snow, I'd say revy>kho > sunshine> louise. That being said, on a powder day, I would take Louise over all three. Killer lines if you know where to hike, that stay untracked longer (revy and kho are very much local hills where people know where to get it).   Which brings me to terrain. This is debatable, but I'd say kho > louise > revy > sunshine. They're all great though, and a lot of people are gonna trash me for that ranking so I'll provide some explanation. Kicking horse is steep, and I love steep. Revy has incredible terrain (esp if you like cliffs), but it takes a while to hike to. Better bang for hiking buck at kho and louise. Sunshine has the dive, but not too much else (maybe Im missing lots?). All that being said, if you also want to rip groomers, kicking horse is terrible for that. Louise and sunshine will be better bets if you are looking to progress.   Location: For things outside of asking : Sunshine (Banff) > Revy > Louise > Kho (golden).  For backcountry: Revy > Louise > Golden > banff. Unless you have a skidoo, then more options open up in golden.  OK, looking forward to hearing what other people think.

I almost always take Revy over Louise, but you make a good point about the awesome lines - Revy lacks the high alpine steep lines that Louise has. With full coverage though, Revvy has the most consistent fall line tree skiing of anywhere I've ever been. Kicking horse easily has the most steeps and chutes, but the lift system sucks and its hard to lap the best areas all day."

Find someplace where the snow is traditionally good and everything else (food, lodging,  work) world's out and be happy for the season you get.   Bear in mind that Banff and Whistler are very different types of snow,  skiing and weather.   Whistler is on the coast so you get wetter heavier snow,  but it tends to be warmer.   It's also the largest lift access resort in North America.   Banff can be cold,  which makes the snow nice,  but cold.   Also,  you have to earn your turns a lot more.   Trade offs!"

However I must speak about the video itself as an artwork;  When you upload a video with the intention to entertain, remember that we are people like you, watching the tip of your skis for 4 minutes is unbearable. Just shoot some short 10 second clips of the slope, perhaps from a distance, from the lift up, from the top, when you eat a dinner, etc etc. And edit them in between the clips you want to emphasize.

skiing,37e1vp,Yawks,9,Tue May 26 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, realize that very few skiers get sponsored and of those that do, far fewer ever make any money from skiing. Getting some free or cheap gear is a good goal to start with and even that will be a long shot.  That being said, there are a couple things you can do to stand out.  I assume you have a demo reel you can send around. This should be well shot and edited as it is mainly for your potential sponsor to see your marketing potential, not necessarily your raw skill.  Similarly, you should send it in with some ideas on what you can do to help their brand and make them money rather than just saying ""Yo, dude, I rock at skiing how about some free shit?"". Good young skiers are a dime a dozen but smart and marketable skiers are rarer so if you can show a potential sponsor that you are capable of producing a polished marketing product that people will actually want to watch and that you are interested in helping them from a business standpoint, you will be ahead of the curve. Just remember, they need to see the potential for you to increase their bottom line. Nobody is out there giving away something for nothing."

Rather than having to chase down potential sponsors and cold sell them on sponsoring you, it very well can turn into the opposite (speaking from experience).  For the more traditional approach, the big thing is being able to sell yourself. Having pull within the industry, notable comp results, that sort of stuff is important to set you apart from any other decently skilled skier with a camera."

I wouldn't want to go any wider for a daily driver ski, you've still got some width and the stealth rocker for when it's deeper, but they're not going to be a hindrance when the snow might not be so great.  Those bindings will be good for you too."

They ended up sending me the Sequences because they were sold out and I ended up really liking them. They're super lightweight, I had no problem going 70mph on them and they also made it a lot easier to plow through mashed potatoes than my regular width twin tips. The very limited ""pow"" experience I have on them is riding them at my local golf course in a couple inches of snow and they seemed to handle just fine, plus being ultra light made it nicer to hike up the hill while carrying them"

The Helix is my favorite, it's super playful and fun to ride, trees, park, etc. I wish those were in stock for you..  I think the Sequence, while smaller underfoot, might be a good option for you.

Sure, there are other skis out there that will make different types of skiing easier, but the bottom line is that you just haven't been skiing long enough to acquire all the skills and ability you need to ski more technical and steep terrain and in different sorts of conditions.  The bindings are certainly not the issue. You're on what you should be on if you're touring. And I have to disagree with what /u/DoktorStrangelove is saying about skiing hard on them. Look up some old videos of Hoji, before he invented the Beast, and see how he skis on Radical FTs, pretty hard IMHO.   When it comes time to get your next pair, do some research (the ski section in the guide from the sidebar might help clarify some things, and blister gear review do awesome reviews of skis), try and demo some skis, but until then I'd just focus on improving your technique and ability to ski in a variety of terrain and conditions."
skiing,376aev,DoktorStrangelove,1 point,Tue May 26 07:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yes wider skis would help you in deeper snow, and some skis with a bit of rocker (tip and tail rise) would help you turn easier, which is good if you're on something steep and technical and you need to be more agile to get down fast and avoid hazards. Some of your problem is probably your ability level, but these days good gear is capable of making a decent skier into an expert skier much faster than before, so you should be taking advantage of that.  Dynafit bindings are also designed with climbing as a primary use, so any true alpine binding is going to give you better feel and performance skiing downhill. They'll also be safer, I have 2 friends who used to ski Dynafit setups every day even at resorts...both of them had their bindings explode while laying into hard turns this season. They're just not designed for hard downhill use."
skiing,376aev,Bsaariaho,1 point,Mon May 25 09:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yes wider skis will help, but not to the extent you probably want them too. I've been skiing powder on a pair of nordica beast 10s (74 under foot) for about 10 years now and haven't had any problems. Your biggest problem is that you are scared of what you are skiing, if you are truly shitting yourself looking down the trail you probably shouldn't be on it. If you are that scared it'll ruin your form. While you should leave your comfort zone (only way to get better), maybe you are too far out of it."

skiing,372zqi,surlygoat,4,Sun May 24 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"First, you need cheap, used skis that you don't mind people skiing over. AND as you aren't certified yet, you'll need something to pass the exams on. Your level 1 exams won't be hard, but its seriously difficult doing ""teaching pace"" skiing/wedging on fat skis.   Pass your exams and get a job teaching - it will be beginners! You WILL have to skate uphill to help people up. you WILL have to ski sloooowwwwlllyyyy (its actually really hard skiing parallel slowly!). And as a first year instructor, you won't be teaching people off-piste or in deep snow. fat skis = horrible to teach beginners on.  I taught/was examined mainly on rossi e88s, and i'm a 6ft guy. They were great, but it made passing higher level exams a bit more difficult where I could've really used a higher performance, narrower carving ski. For someone your size, you should be doing your exams/teaching on something no fatter than 80 underfoot.   The simple fact is that instructors need minimum 2 sets of skis. the teaching carve skis, and the fun skis - be they park or pow.   HOWEVER, if you aren't gonna instruct, and only want one pair of skis, I'd say a pair of all mountain skis at around 105 would be fine for you."
skiing,372zqi,Just-givener,6,Mon May 25 08:00:35 2015 UTC,I was an instructor in whistler for 4 years.   For teaching at a lower level a good park ski would do the trick. But you will want t fatter ski for yourself on days off.

The main thing you want to look for is something fairly wide underfoot 100ish with some tip rocker.  Now is a perfect time to buy as there are tons of good sales right now.  From that list the following skis would work fine for your uses; Faction prodigy, Salomon Rocker 2 100, Fischer big stix, Fischer koa, 4fnt aretha, Salomon Rockette, Armada tst.  The Salomon Rockette would probably be the most forgiving choice for a newly out west skier.  They will turn easy and not get hooked up in the soft stuff due to the tapered tips.  Good all around width, with plenty of rocker in the tips yet a solid camber underfoot.  I would go with the 170 at your height/weight."

I'm from the southeast so my skiing so far has been limited to the yearly (or not so yearly, while in college) ski trips. I'm pretty confident in my ability to improve pretty quickly, once I have some solid time on the slopes, and from what I've heard, you don't have to be raised on the slopes to be a 1st year ski instructor..   On a trip this year, a ski patroller told me they looked for people comfortable on blues to be first year instructors, and I'm definitely beyond that. Of course this is all just secondhand knowledge haha so I could be totally wrong! But I see a lot of resorts that hire ""inexperienced"" instructors to teach beginners/toddlers, so that's what I'm vying for.

Aim for a length between your nose and forehead, mount at about 3 or 4 cm back from center. This will allow you to have reasonably good performance on groomed stuff (for teaching beginners), good performance in pow (fat enough to float, with rocker), and they'll be fun in the park (soft, mounted at -3 or 4)."

skiing,372zqi,Bsaariaho,2,Mon May 25 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"Based on personal experience, I would recommend the line prophet 90's. They're a great all mountain ski that shreds groomers, wide enough to go into the powder, and twin tipped to feel parky enough to try to get in there. For the real powder days they couldn't really hold up (no 90 mm wide ski can) but are great as a pair that can go just about anywhere  Source: using them for 2 years and very happy with my purchase"
skiing,372zqi,i_canmakeamess,2,Sun May 24 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"I love my rossi E100s for this kind of thing.  The temptation 100 is almost the exact same construction, but with a women's specific design (sidecut, layup, topsheet).  It has metal so it'll stick on groomers, but its narrow turning radius and air tips construction makes it plenty maneuverable for skiing with little kids.  I've even hiked with them, which they were definitely light enough for."

I also got lots of skiing time in, mostly with the other instructors, but occasionally with other people I had met who worked at the mountain in different departments.  Lessons don't go on all day. And most instructors don't get back to back to back lessons all day every day. There's plenty of free time to ski, especially if you work weekdays.

You really should  go to a store or fitter to try a bunch on. Also, boot liners ""pack out"" a bit with wear, so be aware with sizing (i.e. a boot comfortable today may be sloppy in a couple months). You want it to be very very snug when you first try them on. Also, price does not mean the boot is ""better.""

This gives you the option to go to the fitter as soon as you feel any kind of pain.  Let's say you live 200 km away from your skiing resort, and you want to go skiing for a week. After two days you feel pain on the side of your foot. Instead of having to wait till the week is over, you can go to the shop right away and get it done, and have better boots the day after :)"

skiing,373nwl,Apollinaire131,2,Sun May 24 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"As said, go to a boot fitter. $400 is still cheap for ski boots. A good boot fitter will tell you what you need for your style of riding, skill level, weight, and foot shape. If your boots fit properly you'll be able to focus on your skiing. Poor fitting boots will lead to pain, and possibly more serious damage to your feet.   (And if you happen to be a teenager with giant feet that fit well in full tilts I have a pair of barely ridden Tom Wallisch boots in a 30.0 that I bought before I knew anything about boots. I'm in a K2 Spyne 130 now in a 29.5.)"

Fit is everything. If Full Tilt shells don't fit your foot well, there's no point in getting them. They may be marketed as a great freestyle boot, but having them or not is never going to be what makes you stomp or fail a trick.  PS: $400 is pretty normal, and honestly not even that expensive by boot standards.  Lastly, it's memorial day weekend... Go get your insane deals on 2014/15 gear. This is one of the biggest weekends of the year for ski gear sales."

skiing,373nwl,chopperharris,2,Sun May 24 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"I have a few pairs of full tilts.  They are nice, but the plastic they use on them isn't as durable as other brands, which is also why they are cheaper.  I have the hotdoggers, and two other pairs I forget the names of  (black ones and then the originals).    The weight of the boot won't necessarily help at all with boots in the same catagory for freestyle.  Lighter boots are certainly nice for walking in, but that's the only thing I have really noticed the weight changes.    You should also just go to a bootfitter."

I bought my boots this spring and they're a 2013 model, ran me 260.) Skis you can pick up on Craigslist if your gf helps you with what style. Cl is super hit or miss in my experience. You can get decent skis for 600-700 new with bindings, maybe even less on sale. Not worth spending a lot on them right now cuz your skill will surpass their versatility within a few years and you'll want to upgrade to something more suited to advanced skiers.   People have already said it but boots make waaaay more difference in your ski experience than skis. My friend / boot fitter / ski salesman put it this way: there's probably a half dozen to a dozen skis you could try and fall in love with, but a properly fit boot is much harder to come by and worth the investment."
skiing,3726yz,broff,1 point,Sun May 24 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"While it is certainly ideal to get fitted for boots properly and pay top dollar for whatever boot fits, it's not always feasible if you are on a budget.  The most affordable way to get into skiing is to go to your local ski swap.  Every city with skiing available nearby has one, and often several.  They usually happen in the fall (October or November) and portion of the sales go to the host, often ski patrol or ski teams.  It's a great way to find a huge selection of cheap used gear, especially boots.  Boots more than skis have terrible resale value, because of the emphasis on getting properly fitted.  Most people won't buy used boots.  So you can find tons of formerly $600 boots for $50, often enough they've only been worn a few times or never worn at all.    Sure it's not as great as getting fitted for a new boot, but there is usually a huge selection to choose from, so you should be able to find something that works reasonably well.  If you learn how to do a shell check you could just go around and look at the shells and then buy a brand new liner.  Aftermarket liners are better than stock liners anyways, so you could feasibly end up with a better fitting boot for considerably less cash going that route rather than paying top dollar at a ski store.  You could even use some of the money you saved from buying a used shell and put it towards some Sidas custom footbeds, boosterstraps, or some bootwork to get your shells fitting perfect."

My ski buddy/amateur ski racer friend knows skis inside and out from decades of ski racing as well as knowing the online sites and critics who test and write about new skis (and from other racers he talks with). He doesn't have issues buying skis that he wants from the reviews he's read, and from the information he hears from his racing friends. He's always happy with his purchases.   Story #2: I'm an expert skier who doesn't trust anything unless I've tried it. So when I buy new skis, I'll go through an entire season to demo different skis, even trying different lengths of the same ski until I feel comfortable about my purchase. Then I find the best deal around for the skis I like and buy them.  Hopefully others will chime in with their suggestions, too. Good luck!"

skiing,36rblm,troglodyte,12,Thu May 21 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"The media coverage around Amendment 64 has been skewed in the wrong direction. They [the media] are giving the impression that it’s OK to smoke in Colorado, and we’re here to say it’s not. The destruction of Leo’s is a result of that.   It's tough when the media is biased towards the truth, isn't it, Russ?  It's both legal and ""okay"" to smoke pot in Colorado. It's not legal at the ski areas specifically for two reasons: 1) it's illegal to consume marijuana in public and 2) it's illegal on national forest land. It's a bad idea because it can make it harder to ski safely, but that's not really a legality issue.  There's no need to accuse the media of bias when all you have to say is ""it's illegal here."" There's no media bias or conspiracy to get everyone smoking pot. The real problem is a remarkably poor campaign to explain the law and silly enforcement priorities (the enforcement of closing time is just bonkers-- you best be done your transaction by 7 on the dot!)."

How dare I! Worlds biggest killjoy! right here.  These regs exist for a good reason they're not arbitrary killjoy regs out there design to ruin your day.     Go smoke your bowl at home dude.    And seriously, as a SAR person: Go Smoke your bowl at home dude.  edit For the record - I'm against building the huts because they're against FS regs and we have enough people shitting all over our BLM, FS and NPS regs as it is. regs that exist for a reason.   I'm against smoking on the mountain because I put other people's right to not be blasted over by an out of control stoner (or drunk) ahead of your right to get stoned/drunk."
skiing,36rblm,snowboardinpa,2,Thu May 21 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry dude, maybe you just assume anyone in the ""pro hut"" camp is just some stoner shithead, but I'm not one of those types...I'm an attorney and a business owner, and I also used to work for a major ski patrol in CO under the Vail Resorts umbrella. There is no ""reg"" that I can think of that actually controls the building of huts on NF land, other than a couple that actually encourage it (with proper permitting, I will concede). People are free to go up and do whatever they want in the summer with the considerable dead fall that's available to them at this point. We did basically fuck-all to stop them.  When our patrol was tasked with managing these things in the summer, the question of whether or not to let one exist came down to a fairly subjective balance between structural integrity and location. If the thing were in danger of falling down, or it was attracting too many gapers who were getting hurt going to/from it, then we'd pull it apart. I know for a fact that Leo's was guilty of neither of those, and instead was a victim of an arbitrary PR decision by Vail Resorts, notwithstanding the opinion of the Forest Service. A couple national news articles about pot came out that featured it, that was all. Breck is easy to get to and therefor easy to report on, and the national media was ravenous at that time for weed-related stories, and Leo's was a high-profile hut where weed was sometimes smoked. Whatever, do the math.  My point is, assuming you have some fucking idea what you're on about (I kinda doubt it), you're still just a blowhard killjoy...nothing more. You're an un-fun pantywaste who's way too fucking uptight. Even if the huts were used EXCLUSIVELY weed smoking (they aren't), so fucking what? Nobody has or will ever accidentally burn down a forest during ski season by smoking weed. Also, news flash, people are always going to get high and go skiing...would you rather them do it at some neat shack in the woods, or on the lift next to a child?"

I haven't even been to a lot of the resorts around the corner up by Park City. Its very hard to beat because you can stay super cheap in Salt Lake and then have like ten resorts to choose from in easy driving distance.  I went to Taos a lot in college, and I like the terrain a lot, but seems like the snow there is increasingly spotty since its so far south."

PCMR/Canyons is bigger than Vail by acreage once they get the gondola up connecting them. Alta/Snowbird connect as well for additional ticket charges. Some of the other close pairs of mountains connect too I think.    Alta is basically hot-tub-time-machine into the 80's heyday of skiing. Prepare for the onesies.    Big Sky now with Moonlight Basin added in, massive acreage, bigger than Vail with 25% of the skiiers. The only line you'll find is the tram to the peak on a nice day. Very pretty mountain too. 60-75 minutes from Bozeman. If you are friends with a billionaire, ski Yellowstone club.  Sun Valley, Idaho: Very nice resort and the most snow making capability in the West. Great 3000' steep cruising runs and very picturesque.  A bit of a drive from the major airports.  Revelstoke BC. Steep, consistent, vertical like nothing else I've ever skied. Biggest lift served vertical in North America. Absolutely amazing on a powder day (and for 3-4 days afterwards)  Fun little town with ski bums from all over the world. Cheap for BC.  A pretty rough travel day though (3-4 hours drive from Kelowna).  It took us 20 hours from the East Coast but I'd go back anytime my group wants. Heli/Cat available from the resort. Stay in town though for more fun.  Whistler, the Vail of Canada. Endless acreage, great vertical and breathtakingly gorgeous, especially in Symphony or on the glacier but unfortunately crowded and very expensive. Hope for cold, because the bottom 1/3 of the mountain can be slushy or bare and its actually some nice skiing when its cold enough.   Red Mountain/Whitewater (bunch of other places I have not been) (southern interior BC) about the same mileage as DIA-Vail except from Spokane. Small towns, fun skiing, lots and lots of backcountry opportunities (500 people per day backcountry around Whitewater according to them)  Red has Cat skiing for reasonable prices iirc."

skiing,36s0vo,DoktorStrangelove,3,Thu May 21 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"You really gotta check the length is set correctly and same goes with the forward pressure. But really, short answer is go see a shop.

skiing,36s0vo,CowsGoMooh,3,Thu May 21 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"Along with what everyone else is saying about having them tested and forward pressure checked, it could be your boots. If your heal is worn down too much, it can cause the boot to not fit in the binding correctly. If the plastic on the bottom is worn down to flush or close to flush with the screws, it's time to replace your heal piece. Also, this time of year with all the slush, people tend to have shit built up on the bottom of their boot that can cause the same problem, so make sure the bottom of your boot is clear before stepping in the bindings."

skiing,36p1dn,AlrightJanice,2,Thu May 21 00:12:14 2015 UTC,"Read the article...  On a side note, snow adds up fast. Let's say a slide happens on a 400x30ft area (pretty small). Every inch of snow adds 120 cubic feet of snow to the slide. That means if the debris of the slide settles on a 40x30 area at the bottom, you can have 1 or more feet of snow on top of you for every inch of snow that slides. So only 4 inches of snow could bury you 4 ft under. Don't be fooled by a shallow slide, it can be very dangerous.  However, the problem here was mostly the fall, not getting buried. A 500 ft fall over rocks can kill you pretty easily.  The backcountry is no joke and this should prove it to you. Very experienced skiers die even in relatively ""safe"" conditions. Don't fool yourself into thinking ""it's only a few inches."""
skiing,36p1dn,what_are_you_saying,2,Thu May 21 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"Have you ever tried to walk on any surface that isn't level concrete? Read the article.  Wet loose slides tend to entrain A LOT of snow. Last season, a group of us got slid in the apron of a line that started as a point release from the rocky face lining the couloir. Very rapid warming was the primary cause, I'd guess roughly 15F in 10min. None of us were fully buried, but 2 of the 3 of us were carried. And this was in the apron - 40 degree slope roughly, and soft. Not hard to see how a slide of that size can knock someone off a much steeper, firmer slope."

I went, skiied till i was beat then grilled and had some brews at the base. if you arnt into slush and moguls dont go, but if you want to see the mogul gods out and have a blast in the bumps do it up. I wouldnt say its worth a 40$ lift ticket but I have a spring pass so.  TLDR; Moguls for days, Skylark is half grass (but super fun if youre up for the challenge), Superstar is fully covered and a dream to shred, bring a grill and some brews for tailgating."

Would you use your ski boots and bindings or affix a rubber makeshift boot like a real waterski?   Ski boots would get bogged and be an anchor.    Plus the angle of the boot would just feel awkward.  Water skiing lends itself to riding back in the saddle and the forward bend of ski boots would be weird.  I know you were able to ski across the pond fine but its a bit different when you need to lean back to counteract the forward pull of the boat.  As such, I'd want something with a serious rocker tip, but I don't know how much that would help.   Edit: what is fun as hell is attaching a water ski rope to a snowmobile and racing across a frozen lake!"
skiing,36eich,Budge-O-Matic,1 point,Mon May 18 21:58:24 2015 UTC,I would like to try this because I feel that a rockered snow ski would have a nicer flex or any at all that would make it a lot easier to do tricks. I've tried old trick water skis and they didn't feel at all right.

I've just skied by about 50ft away and still gotten tagged as having ridden a lift that I didn't ride all day. Other times the power is out or something and you get tagged 5 times in a whole day of skiing. The stats are fun, it's just lame that you have to babysit it if you want it to be even remotely accurate."

skiing,36b7so,Doug101,5,Mon May 18 13:46:07 2015 UTC,"This is pretty common in white out conditions. Motion sickness is caused by a difference between what your eyes see, and what your vestibular system is experiencing. In this case, your eyes have no point of reference to determine if you are moving, however your vestibular system is ""feeling"" motion.  Skiing close to anything that will give your eyes a point of reference will help. Lifts, trees, etc."
skiing,36b7so,difisi,2,Sun May 17 23:40:40 2015 UTC,"Just to add a bit onto the above, some types of topograpy and geological features lend themselves better to this kind of whiting out. If you've ever skied off Blackcomb glacier or the tram at Jackson when its snowing and windy, you'll know that the little posts set up to guide you down can be your best friend.  I've found that every once and a while I get this feeling and really benefit from stopping for a minute to survey my surroundings, reground myself in what is up and what is down, and then start heading for one of those points of reference. I've gotten this way in little VT resorts and big mountains out West, always the same feeling.  P.S. Ultra-jealous of your May pow."

They gave me the honor of the first run in a bowl full of fresh, untouched powder since I broke trail. I took a couple turns and.... promptly tipped over.   My brain just gave up on figuring out which way was up. The weightless feeling of knee deep powder and the lack of visual reference messes with you.

I think you're on the right track with Volkl if you're prioritizing pow and chop performance, Bridges might be a bit small for what you want though, I'd step up to the Mantra or Gotama instead depending on exactly how much pow you expect to ride.  The rocker profile on those skis really rides more like flat, the rocker is extremely subtle, carving them isn't much of a chore at all."

It is a great all mountain ski, the full rocker is pretty mild, but it really doesn't bite and grab an edge if your on some icy stuff.  It also isn't a great powder ski, it can ski in powder, but you have to be pretty aggressive to stay on top. I'll be cliche and recommend the Armada JJ.

I've wanted to demo these because it seems they are stiff enough to charge but skill playful in the pow and trees.  Is this what you are looking for?  I tend to look for the same type of ski so heres some other skis i've been wishing to demo:  icelantic nomad rkr  dps wailer 99  faty-pus M5  blizzard peacemaker  head collective  stockli stormrider 95   However, im sure your BASI instructors would give you better advice than reddit, as they have seen you ski.  Also, I have bought many skis without demoing to save money, and I kinda wished I had demoed.  its usually around 50$ to try 3 pairs for the day.  If you do that twice you will have tried enough skis to know the exact specs you like and even if you buy something other than what you demoed, you will be able to make a more educated guess about what would fit you best.  For 100ish dollars, I think it is worth it, but thats just me.  blistergearreview.com is a good resource for ski reviews."

skiing,360vp6,cyanicenine,7,Fri May 15 05:27:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely, according to these apps every 2nd person in here is doing downhill-racer speeds. Most of the time you won't even find a place where it's safe to go those speeds."
skiing,360vp6,Ausrufepunkt,2,Fri May 15 11:16:39 2015 UTC,"Early mornings when it's quiet in the Alps, if you go to a remote, steep run, like Orelle in Les Trois Valleés, 70 seems feasible. I've hit ~65mph there."

skiing,360vp6,Ausrufepunkt,1 point,Fri May 15 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that ""down hill racer speeds"" are done on a course... 70 miles per hour isn't all that difficult to attain on a steep open trail. I was very skeptical of the speeds at first so I had it checked with a gun and it was exactly on point... All I'm saying is that if it's obviously a glitch then so be it, but 70 mph is nothing ridiculous"
skiing,360vp6,noodlelaughter,1 point,Fri May 22 04:25:06 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that if it's obviously a glitch then so be it     It's not a ""glitch"" per se, it's just that the speed gets measured by gps and the accuracy for mountains isn't good, that's why most apps normalize it, some more than others    If you have such a tracking app try exporting the .gpx and look at it for example here Then you'll see just how inaccurate the whole thing is ""Parameter ändern"" means change parameters, you can set a bunch of different stuff ""Hglattlaen"" and ""Vglattlaen"" are the ones for normalizing it (higher number = less smoothing), ""Vglatt"" turns speed smoothing on and off    Esp. pay attention to lifts you took twice and compare the numbers, for example the ""lift station"" one run was 20m above where it was the last time (according to my gps)    And 71mph is close to what downhill racers do, they do it with super long skis, aero clothing and on a closed and prepared course. Not to mention that, as said, most of the time it's not even safe to go these speeds esp. because of piste condition"
skiing,360vp6,Ausrufepunkt,1 point,Fri May 22 11:12:47 2015 UTC,"My point was mainly that it would be harder to go faster on a course than an open trail.. I'm well aware of how they can be inaccurate, but in many cases they are accurate, and 71 miles per hour is perfectly reasonable. Long skis don't make you go faster, they just give you more control. Someone on an open trail could very likely hit 71 if they were moving... No they wouldn't have the control a down hill racer has, but it's totally doable"
skiing,360vp6,noodlelaughter,1 point,Sat May 23 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"It's doable but unlikely because most of the time it won't be safe to go those speeds, and for a gps to accurately reigster it you would need to go that speed for more than just a few seconds."
skiing,360vp6,Ausrufepunkt,1 point,Sat May 23 21:00:08 2015 UTC,"I dont know man, I ran my gps and used a gun together and it was spot on... Maybe it was a coincidence who knows. Even though the gps can be unreliable it still can be reasonably accurate and there's no reason it would have to be more than a few seconds to get a clear reading"

skiing,360vp6,Ausrufepunkt,1 point,Sun May 24 11:29:29 2015 UTC,I understand the inaccuracies.. All I was trying to say is that it's very possible to go 71 and also very possible that his gps read his speed accurately

skiing,360vp6,Ausrufepunkt,0,Sun May 24 16:22:33 2015 UTC,I always figured that those really high speeds are momentary measurements for most riders. Drop a decent rock or cornice and you're flying through that first turn. The apps don't say how long you're going 70mph.

skiing,360vp6,Ausrufepunkt,1 point,Fri May 15 23:15:28 2015 UTC,"You don't typically end up going that fast off a cornice or a drop unless you're also pointing it afterwards.  To hit 70 mph, you'd need three full seconds of freefall, which is about 140 feet of vertical drop."

So she did her jump, and if you had paused it the moment her skis hit the snow, you'd think everything was alright.

Queenstown definitely has more to do in downtime, it's pretty much a small city full of tourists from all over the world. Wanaka, less so, but more outdoors stuff, great scenery, and a more local atmosphere.  If you're staying in Qtown during August and want to head over to Wanaka for a week, your welcome to join me, I'll be flying in to Queenstown on the 22nd and driving over from there."
skiing,35ydkn,gonltruck,1 point,Thu May 14 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of skiing out of Wanaka a few years ago, mostly Treble Cone, which I was told was the ""most extreme"" skiing available there... It was pretty good overall, but doesn't really compare to the alps. It'd be 15 degrees C in town and eventually reach 0ish as you ascended the mountain to the base lodge. Then there was about 700m of vert to ski up there..  Nice enough snow and terrain, but nothing like the 1000s of meters in the Alps!  Wanaka's a fun town though, I liked it better than Queenstown personally... It gets sun in the winter! Queenstown is shady and colder. :)"
skiing,35ydkn,jobeus,1 point,Thu May 14 16:07:42 2015 UTC,It's much smaller compared to the alps (look at the piste maps). You can get a bus up the hill everyday.
skiing,35ydkn,moodorks,1 point,Thu May 14 17:09:00 2015 UTC,Hardest part is getting to the base of the mountain / access road. Once youre there youll have a lift within 5mins. But if you head to the pub every night youll T up a lift every day easy.
skiing,35ydkn,Measton42,1 point,Sat May 16 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to this one but here is my advice.  Queenstown is a tourist town, lots of shops, ski areas are close and easy to get to with dozens of buses making day trips to all the mountains. Wanaka, as previously stated, is less tourist town and much closer to the two better ski areas (in my opinion) Treble Cone and Cardrona.  There is also great skiing in the Cantebury  region; loads of uncrowned club mountains, heli skiing and then your regular old ski areas. The problem will be accessibility as there are few buses going to these mountains and I'm not sure about accommodation."
skiing,35ydkn,Stefaaan,1 point,Tue May 19 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply dude. I'm now more worried about the lack of terrain accessible without forking out serious money for heliskiing.  I'm used to Courchevel and by extension, Les Trois Vallees, France. It seems that when combining regular pistes with lift accessible backcountry, judging by the maps available, Trois Vallees is an order of magnitude larger than the NZ's southern resorts combined. I'm just worried that there won't be enough to fill three weeks to a month unless I'm heliskiing - although to be fair, it is something I've always wanted to try since it's illegal in the alps."
skiing,35ydkn,Stefaaan,1 point,Wed May 20 12:51:45 2015 UTC,There are a few heliskiing companies in Queenstown and one that i know of in Canterbury (google Methven heliskiing.) I was going to go heliskiing early last season but the amount of snow didn't justify the price. If you get there at a good time during the season it'd be well worth the money but you have to be fairly cynical when skiing in the southern hemisphere. August is usually the best month for skiing in Australia and New Zealand.  Terrain is an issue but if you're experienced in ski touring and you have the equipment there should be plenty to do regardless of where you are (it's even good fun in Australia.)
skiing,35yl2b,sruffian,3,Thu May 14 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"Removing material seems like a poor solution considering you have a narrow heel and the root cause is too much movement/friction.  Outside of getting entirely new boots you could try these.  They come in a variety of thicknesses depending on how much space you want to take up, very popular in hockey and derby where boot modification can't really be done."
skiing,35yl2b,cyanicenine,2,Thu May 14 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"I would not remove material.  The adage ""You can make a small boot bigger, but can't make a big boot smaller"" is relevant. Something you may try is shimming the heel and adding a front spoiler to the front of the liner low on the tongue. Basically trying to reduce volume of the heel pocket and simultaneously push your foot back into the pocket. Obviously, this changes the alignment of your foot in the shell, so whether or not this would help or cause more problems, I can't say.  I'm not sure what you have on your liners now, but you can also try experimenting with different types of foam and shapes. I assume you have c-pads on your boots now, full butterfly wraps will take up more volume (again, don't know what your issues are, just throwing ideas out there). The blue bootfitting foam that comes in sheets is much more dense than your typical c-pad or butterfly wrap and you can more easily cut exactly the shape you need.  The stock BD liners are still pretty awful imo, as in house liners often are. They did step it up from their first attempt, which was about as useful as sheets of cardboard shoved in the boot, but they still fall short of other common options like intuitions. A decent liner that suits your needs would certainly help things, but if the shell fit is too big, it won't fix it.  I've got similar issues with narrow, low volume, ill defined heel/ankles, and wide forefoot. I've also got a stupid high instep though that makes fitting into boots with a narrow heel (dynafit tlt5/6, mercury, vulcan, etc) impossible. Your instep looks average enough that you might be able to fit into one of these boots with a bit of work. Can't say for sure without seeing you/boots in person, but I would say it would be worth sticking your foot in one."
skiing,35yl2b,CaCoD,2,Thu May 14 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"I got pretty much the exact same issue with my relatively new Dynafit TLT5 this weekend, on the exact same spot on the right foot. Started to hurt after about 2 hours, at which point I added a blister plaster that I had brought, which helped tremendously, so I didn't actually get a visible blister. Obviously this doesn't fix the cause of the problem, but it alleviates most of the pain.  http://i.imgur.com/h5kp76t.jpg  It only happened to my right foot, and it seems like my right ankle slides up and down for every step (which rubs that area), which doesn't happen as much with my left foot. It only happens when I'm walking, not in ski mode. I might be able to tight the liners around the ankle, or add some foam to the inside of the shell near the ankle, and that might fix it, but I'm honestly not sure yet. The blister plaster did its job for now, I'm going to do a few more trips and see if it gets better.  The only modifications I've done is to heat up the shell and liner at a bootfitter to make it a bit roomy around the forefoot as it had some tight spots. Haven't done much around the ankle (besides the possible expansion of the liner/shell due to the heating)."
skiing,35yl2b,Amezis,1 point,Thu May 14 18:13:05 2015 UTC,"Blister pads are an option, as is medical tape or climbing tape, if there's even a difference. I suppose this goes without saying, but removing/drying the liners should help as well, if it's an option (in other words if you're not in a cold tent).  Beyond that, grimace and bear it... :)"
skiing,35yl2b,mbillie1,1 point,Thu May 14 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"What kind of socks do you wear? Make sure the fabric is smartwool or something like that which will wick away any moisture from your feet.   Right now? Heal your wound. The area in and around your blister looks raw and could get infected. Make sure you clean that area well and put antibiotic ointment on it.   Once your blister heals, to help it from forming again in the usual spot below your ankle, either use duct tape (no joke) or moleskin.   I'm a WFR and most of the injuries I treat on hikes are blister-related on feet, so that's why I carry duct tape, a ton of moleskin, Ibuprofen, and an extra pair of non-cotton socks.   Have a great time at Shasta!"
skiing,35yl2b,totosmaster,1 point,Fri May 15 00:38:43 2015 UTC,This used to happen to me! When I was skinning I didn't have my shell tight enough and it would start to rub in that spot. So annoying! Apparently the shells should be tighter than I thought.
skiing,35yl2b,embrasse-moi_bien,1 point,Fri May 15 05:18:33 2015 UTC,"I have had this problem.  Lots of that paint on new-skin and a moleskin pad will make it heal fast and will provide some protection if it happens during your shasta trip.  Also, I was hiking with my instep un-buckled.  when I buckled it back up, I had much less heel movement/ blister rub."
skiing,35yl2b,jesusman69,1 point,Fri May 15 15:05:35 2015 UTC,I've had the exact same problem. All I did was to keep the boot tighter to my foot when I'm touring.  But ever since I started getting blisters I always use some sort of sportstape and it works to prevent blisters.

skiing,35wsmi,Mangsii,5,Thu May 14 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"You'll want a hardboot (as opposed to soft boot) setup with 80ish mm wheels.  Hardboots soak landings if you plan on jumping at all, and are more supportive in general.  Larger wheels go faster but aren't as maneuverable and are harder to learn on because they put you farther off the ground (like being on stilts).  On the other end of the spectrum you can get tiny wheeled ""aggressive"" skates that have a block in the center so you can grind rails, but they will suck everywhere except the skate park.  I skate on Seba FR1's which I've been happy with for trail skating and doing easy tricks.  Skates are just like ski boots though,  you'll want to try them on first if you can.  If you find a good boot you can just screw in a different frame and wheel setup.    I find activities such as jogging and biking boring because of how easy they are, unless you are doing downhill or some extreme version of jogging that I'm not aware of.  Inline is difficult enough that it keeps your mind engaged and not just your body, you can even carve turns exactly like you would on skis when you get on mild slopes.  But be wary of moderate slopes, it takes very little angle to get going uncomfortably fast on skates."

With cycling you get the prolonged endurance build up with helps for spending hours on the mountain. Sure you can go run for hours but let's be honest, very few people can run on a regular basis for 2+ hours. With cycling it's easier to get out for 2 and 3 hour rides that build up the endurance in the legs."

skiing,35un3v,panderingPenguin,6,Wed May 13 17:47:19 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of advice in this thread about what skis to buy your beginner brother in law which sounds basically like skis they would buy themselves. I would say that even if you do but a higher end ski for him now, you're likely never going to be able to pick out a ski now that is exactly what he wants when he is good enough to actually use it to it's full potential. I would suggest buying boots and getting a pair of season rentals instead. Then when he's ready and actually knows what he wants you can get him a decent pair of skis."
skiing,35un3v,Rick-James-Bitch,4,Thu May 14 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't start him out on a mid-fat pow ski.  I think that all-mountain carvers with a bit of tip rocker are best for beginners, nothing above 85/90 mm underfoot.  With such a fat ski, it will likely hamper his ability to learn proper edge-to-edge motion and he'll probably end up smearing his turns without proper carving technique.  I credit my ability to carve skis above 115 mm underfoot to all the time I spent on 65-85mm carve/race skis.  Then, once I got the proper carving technique on the groomers in all types of conditions, I got off the groomers and moved up to 100mm underfoot skis.  I'd start him out with something like the Rossignol Experience 77 or the Rossignol Experience 84 if the 77s are too narrow.  You should probably try demoing them for at least a couple of days before you commit to them, just to make sure he likes them, but they go pretty cheap online!  Either way, I'd start out with a good pair of forgiving boots, and demo skis until you find the right pair.  It only takes a day or so to figure out if you found the right pair, but you save a lot of potential money wasted on the wrong ski!"

I know it's the time of the year for these companies to be selling their blemish skis, things like fucked up graphics, or minor aesthetic issues that don't affect rideability and often the skis still come with standard warranty.    Don't buy some goddamn K2's because it costs K2 $97 dollars to build a pair in a chinese sweatlodge and then they sell those skis for upwards of $600 stateside.

This ski will perform incredibly well on groomers, park, pow, bumps, trees, crud, ice and can even be used as a pretty good touring ski. I'm 5'8'' and ski a 186 jeffrey (back when they were 108 under foot). The kartel is essentially the jeffrey's newer counter part. I've also skied my friends kartels and they are very comparable; the kartels are a little easier to lay into turns though. However if he's under 6 foot I would go with something shorter than 186, thats a lot of ski for a beginner. Depending on height the 171 or 176 may be a better choice. Really cant say enough about this company. I have jumped off cliffs straight onto rocks and the skis show no sign of damage other than superficial scratches on the base. The build quality is just incredible. They will last him a lifetime both durability wise and skill wise.

You're really standing up for and supporting this guy? He's an asshole. He doesn't want to ski anywhere with an epic pass because he doesn't want to ski with potheads? What a joke. And what spliffmastafresh said is true. If he was there on a busy day, he's part of the crowd as you or I would be if we were there, too. To show up on an extremely busy day (after a snow storm on a Sunday when no other resorts are open) and complain about the crowd and act like you're not a part of it is psychotically self-righteous and delusional. Is everyone supposed to stay home so he can have the mountain to himself and he doesn't have to be around pot heads? Fuck this guy. spliffmastafresh was only giving him shit (and me as well) and rightfully so. And fuck you and everyone else too if you share his attitude."

This is what I'm responding to (along with what spliffmasta said in the linked thread above). The vast majority of people work 9-5 and ski weekends. There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with saying something like ""Oh man, fun day but the crowds were brutal"". I suppose spliffmasta's comment about riding weekends could be taken multiple ways, but I took it as ""fuck people who drive up from Denver to ski on the weekends"", based on the first comment I linked. Based on the downvotes I assume others did as well.  Spliffmasta seems to think he deserves to ski more than Front Rangers who commute on the weekends, and we called him out for it.   klif01 is absolutely part of the crowding problem as we all are. I have zero problems with Summit locals, but I do have a problem with Summit locals who say shit like ""STAY IN DENVER"".   It's funny because I think we're actually on the same page about this, but we have a different interpretation of what has been said above, primarily spliffmasta's first comment."
skiing,35jwt9,calmeche,-1,Tue May 12 07:24:47 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with skiing only on the weekends.  I was merely saying this dude was being a hypocrite complaining about the crowds while being a part of the problem.  Especially when you never ski A-Bay unless its the only place open. Ever been to A-Bay in the middle of winter?  Chances are you won't wait in a line all day.  That's why some A-Bay locals hate all the gapers skiing here in the spring/beginning of the season.  You didn't call me out on anything... cuz that shit is true!  STAY IN DENVER OR GO TO BRECK JERRY!!!!  Summit locals and A-Bay locals aren't the same thing man.  Downvotes commence...
skiing,35jwt9,klif01,2,Wed May 13 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"Here's the key: He never said he wasn't part of the problem. Read his comment below, carefully.   Would you not agree that A-Bay ""locals"" like yourself hating spring skiers and and telling them to stay in Denver are equally as guilty of complaining about crowds while also being a part of the problem? Who's the hypocrite now? Is this now a ""he started it"" thing, like an argument between two 8-year-olds?  Also, A-Basin is in Summit County...so I don't know what you're trying to say, unless you literally live at A Basin under a desk in the ticket office or some shit. If you're an A Basin ""local"", you're a Summit local. Unless you live somewhere outside of Summit County off the I-70 like Georgetown, where I would just consider you another I-70 commuter, causing traffic like everyone else.  And chill out with the all-caps, grandma.   Also, I think it's cute that you told me to stay in Denver or go to Breck. Serious burn. Maybe I'll spend the weekend in Denver, hit up some breweries, go out in LoDo, etc. Or maybe I'll go to ski Breckenridge, an internationally renowned ski destination. Life sucks. I think it's better spent being a jaded A-Bay ""local"" who hates people in Denver that enjoy both work and skiing."

I've been part of the crowd on many powder days over the last couple of years, even on a couple Mondays when I can get a long weekend from work. Sure the weekday had less people, but it was still crowded/tracked out quick. Complaining without presenting a solution is like pissing in the wind. That's why I added my solution for me to personally avoid/solve the problem by getting out of the resorts, some backcountry experience and a buddy to drag along. I also get to chose to avoid the pothead (yes I'm generalizing) crowd that seems to think they're above the law about smoking in public/national forest and consequentially are self righteous entitled pricks.

skiing,35jnr9,what_are_you_saying,3,Mon May 11 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"So here's the generic response I've written out before:    Keep the intro short and sweet. No more than 10-15 seconds, shorter is better, the internet has a short attention span. The more shots in sunlight the better. Unless the overcast footage is really good, the lighting is important, sunny looks better. If you use overcast footage (unfortunately pow days are rarely sunny) learn some color correction. This takes lots of practice but can make a huge difference. Keep the edit short. Usually 1 song and 2-5 minutes. The longer it is the less likely people are to watch it. Transition often. Keep each shot onscreen for 3-6 seconds and then switch to another shot (the exception would be an amazing continuous line). Start it off with a bang, people rarely give a video more than 5 seconds to impress them, so impress them early. Choose music wisely, know your audience. Stay away from overused songs but at the same time choose something most people can enjoy. (avoid hardcore rap, heavy metal, too sexual, too much dub, etc) Listen to several songs and choose something with solid beats (for transitions) and tempo changes (slow motion), something you could see in a ski movie. This will probably take the most time but match each clip carefully into the song. Don't become stuck in a particular order, move the clip until it fits perfectly into the song. Don't advertise for people who don't sponsor you. It's tacky, doesn't bring in more views, and it looks like you're trying too hard. Gets tons of footage, I usually will edit down 5+ hours of footage to get a <5 minute video. Face-shots, falls, and objects blocking the camera (i.e. hand, tree branch, etc.) make good transitions. Use the music to make the transition make sense. Don't overuse effects, straight cuts work better than people think. Slow motion is good but don't overuse it. Sometimes people just want to see real-time. People who watch your video want to see skiing/snowboarding, not your face, your beer, and the club you went to. B-roll is good but keep it limited. If you're shooting with a POV camera get as many angles as you can to mix it up a little. Light leaks seem to be growing in popularity but be aware when too much is too much. Every clip having this effect is way too much.   Technical:   If uploading, export H.264 codec as it works best with youtube-like sites. Bit-rate is as, if not more, important than resolution. I usually export my HD videos at 20-30Mbps. You should be able to find this setting in your export/render screen.   *Export at 30fps or less since (for now) most online video-players don't support higher and a smaller file will upload faster.  No longer true, youtube supports 60fps now if you want.     I'm sure I'm forgetting some stuff so I'll add to this list if it comes to me. Good luck and show us the results.  Most important:    Shred to shred, filming is secondary.       Here's the response specific to your video:  Overall, it looks good. Remember to keep that intro short and pull viewers in quickly. I also really recommend playing around with some color correcting. I'm by no means an expert editor but take a look at this video of mine that shows how even a little easy work on the flat shots can make a huge difference. However, since most of the shots were sunny it wasn't a big deal. What editing program do you use? Something like Premiere or FCP or something like GoPro Studio?  I also recommend you avoid the chest mount. I have found that it's really shaky and gives rough footage. I personally usually stick with a helmet mount (your neck makes a great gimbal) or a pole either in front or behind you, the shots are smoother and give you more interesting POVs. I also recommend filming in superview or in a 4:3 shot (like 1440p) and stretching it to 16:9. Then you can see your skis but still see forward since looking at the ground is not very entertaining for the viewer.  One of the best things you can do to make videos better is to work on your skiing. People are usually interested in seeing interesting lines and unique terrain. Also, powder is where the best skiing is, both for fun and for footage, obviously that's not always an option though. Being in the air makes for good footage but on camera, even the slightest loss of control really sticks out. I struggle with good posture in the air and staying tucked but it really pays off to work on it. Not only will your skiing improve a ton but it will look way better on camera.  Keep working on it, it takes practice. Just look at my channel and compare my early videos to my newer ones. Hope this helps."

But if you're just looking for mobility getting to the slopes in your boots, they might not be exactly what you're looking for. There are lots of dowhill boots that incorporate a walk function, and I'm guessing that is why you're asking about touring boots? The other thing to remember is that if you go for a touring boot, they're not all compatible with downhill bindings. This might clarify that a little for you;    Type of Binding Intended Uses Compatible boots    Alpine/Downhill (normal) Skiing at the resort etc. Alpine/Downhill (Normal), Hybrids and Some Touring (tech) Boots, depending on the model of boot/binding   Touring (frame) In-bounds & Ski touring Alpine/Downhill (Normal), Hybrids and Most Touring (tech) Boots, depending on the model of binding.   Touring (Tech) Ski touring (but can be used in the resort too) Touring (tech) Boots and Some Hybrids depending on the model of boot   Telemark All of the above.

skiing,35k0w0,Vag_Assasin,0,Mon May 11 07:57:59 2015 UTC,Just because youre touring often doesn't necessitate touring boots; I've survived plenty of lengthy tours in my alltracks
skiing,35k0w0,Squirrel_Whisperer,4,Wed May 13 01:08:53 2015 UTC,"The downside is lack of support.  When I try on touring boots with large ranges of motion I get excited because of how easy it would be to walk.  Then I lock them in and they feel like marshmallows.  You need to match up boots to skis as well.  I like stiff skis.  Actual stiff skis.  Soft boots won't work with them just like my boots won't work well with a softer ski.  There are boots out there that are alpine with a limited walk function.  They aren't really any lighter but give you the ability to stand upright when in walk mode.  Then you have boots that are feather light and give 60 degree range of motion but you cannot be aggressive in them.  If you are walking in bounds and not touring, I would go with the limited walk function.  I do a bit of hiking in my race boots, but I'm getting some Lange XT 130 next year for comfort.  They are getting a bit more range of motion and have a WTR (Walk To Ride) toe and heel to make it easier as well.  The XT 130 is probably about as stiff as the RX 110.  So take that into consideration.  A 130 means it is the stiffest for that model and isn't a comparison to other 130s."

A guy I work with can solve multiple problems in about the same time with his F1 than most people can with a modern beacon. He has 20 years of experience and is a machine tho.) It is very difficult to teach yourself analogue search technique. It's even harder to use in an actual avalanche without extensive training and practice.   A quick google shows the BCA Tracker DTS, which is a great, if somewhat outdated beacon available online for less than $200. I would stay away from the inexpensive Pieps freeride, which appears to be the cheapest on the market. It's worth it to buy new, invest in training, and practice. FWIW, the beacon proficiency test we use at work is the same as the AMGA test: in a 100mx100m test area, on a moderate slope, you have 7 minutes to probe three beacons buried to a depth in excess of 1m. Its much easier to pass with a Pieps DSP or Pulse Barryvox than an ancient analogue beacon."
skiing,35ftgg,amateur_acupuncture,2,Sun May 10 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"Buy a newer beacon.  You will not be able to rescue your friends with this beacon, you'll only be able to find their bodies.  It's honestly worth 20 bucks only to use a practice transmitter to search for with your Tracker or whatever."
skiing,35ftgg,throwaway2358,-2,Thu May 14 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should buy it.  $20 is a great deal for a spare beacon so you can practice with your real beacon."

skiing,357idl,DoctFaustus,21,Thu May 7 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Here's their write up, translated to English.  Daily weather conditions : A bit cloudy in the morning getting completely covered in the afternoon, no wind, low temperatures. Snow conditions: It snowed a lot the week before (more than 50 cm of powder accumulated), not so much wind during the last days, no positive temperatures. Types of terrain and snow encountered: The area is divided in 3 parts: the first is not very steep with some little fir trees, the second one is the steepest one and with no tree, the face goes steeper and steeper, at the end of this part there are some little cliffs (between 3 and 5 meters), the last part is almost flat (max 30°), opened with no slope failure, it’s where the avalanche happened. Dennis is the yellow and black rider who got caught by the avalanche. Colin is the orange and blue rider who did the rescue. At the top of the run Colin started first to test the snow, he made some jumped turns and small horizontal crossings to see if slabs would trigger ( the most probable would be a wind slab ), nothing happened. Later on the run the snow was deeper, lighter and wasn’t transformed. This is what happened to Dennis during the beginning of the avalanche and then under the snow: 1)  Dennis starts his run skiing fast in diagonal until he arrives above the cliffs. 2)  When he is above it, he tests the snow. 3)  Being confident in the snow he decides to jump the cliff below him. 4)  The landing is perfect and nothing seems to move. A few meters later cracks appear but he doesn’t see them. A few seconds later he notices a “snow plough” before him. At this moment he doesn’t understand that it’s the front end of the moving slab. 5)  Unfortunately the slab gets bigger and bigger where Dennis chose to make his turn. Riding on the main crack he fell. 6)  After the fall he stood up, back to the avalanche, and then got hit and buried by the avalanche. He will not see the surface again. This is what Colin experienced during the avalanche and the rescue. The numbers correspond to the time displayed by the stopwatch. 1)  Colin is protected between a cliff and a tree, he is watching Dennis riding. 2)  He sees some sluff going down then Dennis appears. 3)  After Dennis appears he sees a layer cracking 5 m before him. The crack becomes bigger and bigger and a new one appears above him. 0.00.0  : Dennis is burried, it’s the beginning of the 15 decisive minutes. He will not see him resurface. 0.00.0  - 0.10.58 : Colin keeps looking at the avalanche as it’s still moving and he asks the witnesses for help. 0.10.58 - 0.31.00 : Once the avalanche stops moving he takes his DVA and puts it in search mode. 0.32.00 - 0.55.00 : After hesitating on the itinerary to take in order to reach the avalanche he drops the cliff below him and gets to the avalanche. ( WRONG DECISION: HE SHOULD HAVE GO AROUND THE CLIFF NOT TO BE IN THE SAME SETTING AS DENNIS OR, IF HE JUMPED, HE HAD TO KEEP THE DVA IN SENDING MODE UNTIL HE WAS IN SECURITY). 1.00.00 - 2.48.00 : Arrival on the avalanche (he had a problem to put back his gloves, think to do it, so you don’t let your smell for the avalanche dogs, this is important). It’s the beginning of the search on skis. For the moment he doesn’t have any signal. 2.49.00-2.59.00 : The first signal is received ( SECOND MISTAKE: LEAVE AN OBJECT WHERE THE FIRST SIGNAL IS RECEIVED ), he follows it by skis. 2.59.00 - 3.19.00 : He takes off his skis at approximately 10 meters from Dennis according to the DVA and continues the search slower. 3.19.00 - 3.45.00 : While at 3 m from Dennis, Dennis feels Colin above him and starts to shout to be remarked, Colin hears him. He shouts back but Dennis doesn’t hear him. 3.45.00 - 4.05.00 : The cross research starts ( after a bit too much time, Colin being too focused on Dennis’ voice ) with the nearest signal being received. 4.05.00 - 4.43.00 : At this moement a witness arrives near Colin. While Colin was preparing the probe, the witness finds Dennis’ leg. The witnesses don’t have shovels so they help by digging with their hands. 5.02.00 - 5.40.00 : Colin stars to shovel. 5.40.00 - 6.04.00 : Dennis’ head is out of the snow, the respiratory tract are cleared and he answers Colin’s questions. He is conscious and breathes : end of the stopwatch. 4) The snowpatrol arrives at this moment and starts their security and information check… Info: Colin was shouting at Dennis during all the rescue, Dennis will tell us that he didn’t hear anything, even when Colin was above him. Estimated time From the moment he got buried until the moment his head was out of the snow and he was answering questions : about 6 minutes. Avalanche characteristics: about 40 meters wide at the top, around 60 m wide at the bottom, average slope 28°, around 200 m long, depth of the crack around 70/80 cm, started at the altitude of 2000m on a West exposed face, Dennis was found at a depth of 1m to 1.5m. We are sorry the images are not centered and don’t let you see the DVA and Dennis’s head when we took him out of the snow. We would like to thank the witnesses who reacted very well by calling the 112 and by helping Colin to dig; and the resorts’ snowpatrols (especially François Debergé and Sylvain Thibodaux) who arrived really fast and did their job really well. We hope that this explanatory video will be a constructive example for you to work on your research protocol and on how to react during such an event. Don’t hesitate to ask us questions and share your thoughts so the debate on avalanches and how to “avoid” them can move forward. Please share the video so a maximum of people may benefit. Also have a look and like/share Zapiks, Youtube, Facebook and Instagram pages of the ODOS project and of the Lucky Boy - Born to Ride crew."

skiing,357idl,aussieskier23,7,Thu May 7 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"When you consider the panic he would be in I think he did fine - traversed into the slide zone, did the proper zig zag pattern until he got a signal, went in to fine search and found his friend without probing.

skiing,357idl,iamda5h,8,Thu May 7 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Relax dude.. it's always easy to say something like this after seeing a video. The witnesses didn't have gear so they dig with their hands. Also you don't know where to dig exactly, even if you see part of the body you might not be able to identify in which position it is exactly and where to dig next. They found the head very quicky and freed his respiratory tract. All this while staying calm and not panic (and maybe waste digging energy somewhere else)."

It seems like this would have very limited scope of use compared to any weather station, snotel, measuring stick in the ground, etc. Avalanche terrain often is complex, with areas of drifting and scouring around terrain features (ie, inconsistent snowpack). I don't see how this would be accurate in predicting runoff or tell you anything a weather station at the head of the valley couldn't.  I don't think I need to say why this tool wouldn't be hugely useful in mid-winter snowpack analysis or avalanche forecasting either.

skiing,3522q9,buddhatokes710,5,Wed May 6 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"Before buying the bindings make sure you have the proper gear and training. Beacon, shovel, and probe at the minimum and an avalanche course. It is very expensive to be properly set up but nothing is too much when it comes to saving you or your friends life. Utah avalanche center is the resource for avalanche conditions during the season. Backcountry is serious business and it is really easy to get seriously hurt or killed. As a ski bum myself nothing bums me out more than when I get to work and hear of someone being buried in a slide. With the advance in AT equipment it has boomed quite recently and many people overlook how dangerous and serious it truly is. As for bindings I like the guardians. They served me well. The ride height may seem like an issue but you'll get used to anything. They are all going to sit you around the same height. The only thing that's really going to get you closer to the ski would be a dynafit setup. Good luck brother and maybe I'll see you out there one day. Just hopefully not with a camera in my hand and reporter in tow."

I would honestly just go with a frame binding if you're only going to be doing some backcountry and going out of the gates. I like Marker's line, though some have had issues with toe after a season or two.   If you're talking about doing almost exclusively backcountry or doing BC more often than not, you won't regret going Dynafit."

skiing,3522q9,urbanxa,1 point,Thu May 7 16:58:04 2015 UTC,You might also want to look at the freeride bindings from Dynafit. I spent two seasons on the beast 16 now and couldn't break it (so far).
skiing,3522q9,icantfindagoodlogin,1 point,Wed May 6 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"I've ridden with/on most of the bindings.  They all have their strengths and weaknesses.  If you huck then you want to go high DIN Guardian/Adrenalin/Duke or SI&I CAST.  If you are looking for longer tours with less weight per foot then Dynafit, Fritschi Vipers, and maybe the newer Marker Kingpin is a good decision.  From what I've seen, it doesn't really matter unless your looking for efficiency.  What's more important is that you have a good skinning technique that doesn't tire you out when you're skinning the steep stuff.  All that transition ideology is wonderful, but from my personal experience when I transition I like taking a small break and making sure my beacon works properly, eat a snack, talk about line choices, and prepare for the descent.    I ride with splitboarders, dynafit skimos, and huckers and we all have a good time on whatever we are riding.  Transitions are the least of my concerns most of the time.  ** Now that I read your original question, I'm confused at the phrasing, but I will try my best to interpret.   You don't want a traditional style binding, so that eliminates your original 3 options.  You're left with getting a sturdy boot (Tecnica Cochise, Dynafit Vulcans, Atomic Backland (120), Scarpa Maestrale RS) and a Dynafit style setup. Or I read your statement completely backwards and you're avoiding that setup I just mentioned.   Good luck."
skiing,3522q9,micro_cam,1 point,Thu May 7 13:44:16 2015 UTC,Ok so let's say I do get Dynafit bindings.  Where can I find boots that are compatible with both AT bindings and Normal bindings
skiing,3522q9,gonltruck,1 point,Wed May 6 19:05:19 2015 UTC,Another option that's compatible with both is the K2 pinnacle. But it'll all depend on your footshape. Ask your bootfitter if K2 Pinnacle is right for you.
skiing,3522q9,DeathB4Download,1 point,Wed May 6 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Marker and salmon make at bindings that work with at boots (they need adjustable toe height to account for the rockered at sole) too.  They make at boots with swapable soles (scarpa freedom, bd factor etc) but they are heavier then some of the stiff free ride oriented at boots like the maestrale rs or dynafit vulcan and khion. You could just get at boots and keep you're current alpine boots?  Dynafits are great and there are now tech bindings like the dynafit beast, marker kingpin, g3 ion and fritshi vipec that are providing more and more alpine like performance and release.  Lots of frame bindings seem burly but have issues with durablity in tour mode (ie fall over while skinning and you may torque the pivot and break the whole binding off the ski). Tech bindings can be broken but they aren't fragile."
skiing,3522q9,gonltruck,0,Thu May 7 03:58:16 2015 UTC,"You're looking for a WTR boot, say something like the Tecnica Cochise  See this line of the description:   Tecnica also equipped the Cochise with interchangeable sole technology, so you can swap in tech soles (sold seperately) for the included Techni-Grip rubber soles if you want to go for a full-on tech setup   That's what you're looking for.  Edit: Not endorsing that boot specifically, just showing an example of what you're looking for. They came to mind because my flatmate has a pair and enjoys them."

skiing,34xbpd,Poopyoo,1 point,Wed May 6 10:32:47 2015 UTC,"You're right.  The hang gliding dunes of NC are relatively coastal and had better steeps esp given a recent Hurricane shortly before I visited (but NOWHERE near the steepness of a real mountain).  They generally worked better than the rolling dunes of White Sands NM.   That said, White Sands is much more beautiful. IMO don't bring the skis and enjoy it for what its worth.   White Sands for the beauty, Kitty Hawk for kite flying or hang gliding if you have the $$$"

skiing,34yzfs,YodasTinyGreenPenis,1 point,Wed May 6 03:25:08 2015 UTC,It's not that way in the US  Green circle = easy   Blue Square = Moderate   Black Diamond = Difficult   Double Black Diamond = More difficult  Orange Slow signs are used near 'bunny hills' or trail mergers   The issue is there isn't a hard definition on what's easy or moderate or difficult and tend to be relative to other trails in that resort and may not really correlate to another resort.
skiing,34yzfs,DoctFaustus,0,Wed May 6 12:19:21 2015 UTC,"Actually blue does mean the run is easier than a diamond or dub diamond.  Idk where you went in Europe but where I've been, that's not how they do it. It's piste or off piste. That's it."
skiing,34yzfs,heskiis,1 point,Wed May 6 14:24:26 2015 UTC,It implies flatter than average for the resort but doesn't mean the are no steep parts. St.Anton or Lech would be a good example.

skiing,3507hm,Nawedy,6,Wed May 6 00:42:53 2015 UTC,Dude. Don't learn how to alpine ski in the backcountry. It's like base jumping. You can't just go out and do it. You gotta put in your time first. Are you out west? Is there avalanche danger? Either way you should look into real lessons and a level 1 avy course before you go out there ramboing lines out of bounds.
skiing,3507hm,windowlesspanelvan,2,Wed May 6 01:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to do anything crazy, don't worry. I will only go with experienced people, and I'm planning to take the course on avalanche safety (which I'm guessing is the equivalent to level 1 avy? We don't have those here) I'll also not go up mountains I could not have gone down with my cross country skis, at least not until I'm more confident. Which limits it to under 30º, so not as risky avalanche wise."
skiing,3507hm,windowlesspanelvan,1 point,Wed May 6 09:17:06 2015 UTC,"So good to hear. I shouldn't have judged your intentions. You sound like you're smart and cautious and serious about wanting to get into this. I wish you only the best.   Side note: Level 1 Avy courses are usually three day affairs, combining classroom time with teaching tours. But for now, any education you can take will help. Good luck and great skiing!"
skiing,3507hm,Sheldonconch,2,Wed May 6 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to listen to these people, but definitely heed their warning and be safe.  Basically the type of backcountry skiing you will be doing is a lot more like mountaineering than it is like any kind of in bounds skiing, and it sounds like you have some experience with that. Obviously you should have avalanche awareness and take a level 1 class. Read up on the warning signs online and stuff like that.  Out of bounds skiing is like in bounds skiing except no ropes and unmarked obstacles. It's not like the terrain changes or makes it automatically a bunch harder just because it is backcountry. Plus you said you aren't there for the adrenaline, so that gives you better odds than 95% of skiers out there.  So back to your question. I don't have a whole lot of info because I love powder skiing and skis that make powder skiing amazing, and I sacrifice the enjoyability on the way up for a better experience on the way down. Shoot for 80mm I guess under foot. I don't go below about 110 because it makes powder skiing better and gives larger ski for more stability.  The difference between the width in the front vs middle vs tail doesn't matter THAT much. It may help you with carving a turn, but you will be able to turn any ski. I would go with whatever is cheap and has a bit of a change in width. Old straight skis will be slightly more difficult to turn, but they'll be the cheapest for sure.  So your main concern on these dimensions in order of importance should be price, length, how many times have they been drilled, then how much do they weigh, and then difference in widths between middle and ends (sidecut), then camber, then width. I think.  You want a shortish ski for your size because you want it to be light and you want to be able to turn it easy. But if you go too short you will have less platform and be less stable like on ice skates (you can turn easy but not very stable).  I would go length of about 145(less stable)-170(easier to turn). Weight will be hard to determine on old skis, but the more lightweight the better for climbing. It is important to make sure that the skis have not been drilled more than 2 times. You will probably change the bindings, and most shops will not do it after the 3rd time. Just ask. Most people won't lie about it. Sidecut... it should have some? I guess.. but don't pay much extra for it. Camber is a tough one. Big deal for me. It changes skiing a lot. Reverse camber (rocker) means the tip (and sometimes the tail) curve up from the rest of the ski meaning they come up off the ground a bit. Regular camber means the middle of the ski bends up. You probably want regular camber or flat camber for better skinning ability. Revers camber makes turning a bit easier, but gives you a bit less edge, so less stability when you are on an edge. I would say regular camber. It's hard for me to say because some early rise helps you ski over crud and stay on top of powder and makes it so nice. Okay regular camber with some early rise. Width I already said.  Okay you will probably buy the randonee (I think alpine touring is the phrase used more now) bindings seperate. You should get fritsche freeride bindings. They are lightweight and easy to switch from touring mode to downhill mode. The only problem I had was when landing a large jump the ski would flex enough that they would pop into touring mode while I was skiing causing me to crash. You won't have this problem because you will have stiffer skis, they won't bend as much because you won't be landing large drops or jumps, and you're lighter. Should be good. They are cheap and lightweight. Marker Dukes and Barons are heavier and dynafits are more expensive.  You're eventually going to want a pair of alpine touring boots. The main difference is that they bend at the ankle so it is more comfortable hiking in them. Find a cheap pair that fits I guess?  This is a weird guide. Hope some of it helps. Good luck.  TL:DR Buy cheap skis 145-170 drilled twice or less and mount with fritschi freerides. Don't worry too much about the rest."
skiing,3507hm,dkriegs,1 point,Wed May 6 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"I understand that for now you want to stay away from avalanche terrain (>30 degrees) but something tells me your eventually going to want to get into the big leagues.  When that moment comes make sure you don't spare a necessary expense and know what you are doing.  My gear...  Beacon, Shovel, Probe, Airbag, Avalung, Avalanche Buoy  I have a pair of marker AT bindings on Rossi Super 7 skis, which I think is a great combination even for what you are doing.  Marker tour bindings are reasonably priced.  I got the F12 because they were lighter weight than the more common Marker Dukes and Barons.  You don't need to splurge on dynafits.  The super 7s are great on everything except maybe moguls, holds a great edge on piste and floats through powder off piste.  They are 115mm underfoot but more like 140 at the tip, in addition to being rocker/camber/rocker.    If you're 5'4"" you should probably ski something in the ball park of 160cm.  I would recommend eyebrow height for a powder ski, maybe bigger if you are used to skiing long skis or are of exceptional ability level."
skiing,3507hm,UnicornFritters,1 point,Fri May 8 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"What the other guy said. If you want to cook, you gotta cook scrambled eggs before you jump into beef wellington or some shit. Start skiing piste trails, work your way up and get legitimate experience under your belt for at least a season or two before you should even attempt backcountry, and when you do go up with someone experienced."
skiing,3507hm,skeerus,1 point,Wed May 6 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"Skiing in the backcountry is dangerous. The most important back country tools are your beacon, probe, and shovel. Furthermore, if you are skiing and your buddy gets caught in an avalanche, you need to have the ability to ski down to him and dig him out. Don't underestimate where avalanches can trigger. I have triggered small avalanches in less than 25 degree slopes in a few cases! I would recommend skiing in the safety of a resort and learning how to alpine ski before skiing backcountry."

skiing,34vo0c,grumpywasatchskier,2,Tue May 5 19:26:09 2015 UTC,You start by kiting a speedflying wing. Taking it out on a breezy day and practice snapping it up and controlling it above you. Then you go to a small hill and just do it. You don't get more than 30 ft up. It is a sport best learned through practice. Nobody can truly explain to you how the wind feels and the effect it will have on turning until you try it.

skiing,34phcl,senorski,6,Sun May 3 15:28:51 2015 UTC,I would love to ski it someday.  I have a couple questions for anyone who has done it. How long does the hike take?  Do you know how much vert you get to ski?  Can you drive to the base or do you hike to the base as well?  Looks like a lot of fun.
skiing,34phcl,GRRM_KILLS_ALL,3,Sun May 3 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Usually you park at Pinkham Notch visitors center and hike up using the Tuckerman's Ravine trail, it is about 2.5 miles to the Hermit Lake shelters but you ascend around 1,800 feet during this hike, I believe it took us around 2.5 hours or so.  We chose to stay a few days in these shelters, they are primitive shelters and cost around $10 per night per person.  You have to pack in and carry out everything, the only amenties avaiable at these shelters are composting toilets and a well for water.  From the hermit lake shelters you hike to the base of the bowl which is about 45 mins and you get to the Lunch Rocks, I forget the acutal distance of this hike.  Then once you are in the base of the bowl you can choose from many different route options, that hike usually takes about an hour to get to the top of the headwall of the bowl to begin your ski descent, I think Tuckerman's Ravine typically has about 600 ft vertical of skiing.  There are a few other trails nearby with more vertical like Hillmans Highway which is closer to 1,400 vertical feet.  To get back down from the shelters, if there is a lot of snow fall you can sometimes ski all the way back down to the car by taking the Sherburne trail."
skiing,34phcl,pcc25,5,Sun May 3 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't been since I moved out of NH to go west, some 8 years ago, but maybe I can help. It's a approximately little over an hour from Lake Winnepesauke, two hours from Manchester, three from Boston. The hike takes a few hours, but it's nothing unmanageable, really depends on your fitness. I want to say it took us 3-4 hours but I can't remember exactly. Skins make it faster. The skiable vert depends how much snowpack there is. It's not terribly far from the headwall to lunch rocks, but it's a pretty solid trip down hillman's and taking the sherburne down is a long trail. You hike up from the notch. This isn't a ski resort after all, it's backcountry. It just happens to have a volunteer hut up near the top. All in all it is a lot of fun. Best skiing I ever had out east no question."

Living near the creekside gondola will save you some money. its the gondola/area separate from the village that only accesses whistler and is about a 5 minute drive to the village. With the peak2peak gondola running though, access to blackcomb is just a 15 or so minute gondy ride. Also don't buy groceries in whistler if u can avoid it.

You didn't say that this particular device sucks and anyone who uses it is dumb because it doesn't work well.  You said that any device in this vein is designed for idiots who don't know how to carry their skis.

You implied that the currently accepted method of carrying skis is the only possible way that anyone will ever need to do it    What a ridiculous assertion. I went ski touring last weekend and used a backpack designed to carry skis so that I could use my arms and it worked wonderfully as intended. So no, that was not my implication.

Many of the approaches you normally skin were hiking only, and when you did hit snow it was mostly thin and icy. Occasionally still good skiing to be had, but nothing close to normal."

skiing,34oc99,neatopat,-3,Mon May 4 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"Just typical joey behavior to be in the backcountry without gear.   Yeah there are safe spots on Loveland Pass but that picture doesn't really give much info, sport. So I guess I assumed the worst. Sorry I crossed you."

Just because it's not controlled terrain on a resort doesn't mean it's slideable or even remotely dangerous. Get your head out of your ass.

skiing,34lqoo,oopoe,3,Sat May 2 07:35:15 2015 UTC,"I live in Chamonix and do it 10-15 times every season. It's a great experience, there are tons of variants for every level of skier but the classic run if very straightforward and not steep at all.  Do use a guide unless you are very experienced on glaciers. Snow can be anything from chest deep powder (I once couldn't get 135 underfoot skis to float!) to icy moguls, so optimal ski choice will depend on conditions. No need for skins or touring set up.  The ridge descent is easy and straightforward if equipped with ropes (as it should be if you go high season, February to April) but still very scary if you are not used to it.  Overall, definitely worth doing at least once in your life. The views alone are well worth the price."
skiing,34lqoo,nattfodd,1 point,Sun May 3 08:47:50 2015 UTC,"Done it quite a few times, mostly as a result of other runs off the Midi in Chamonix. As for skiing it's not great, but it's a pretty cool experience, especially now in spring when there are lakes on the glacier. But there's also the larger risk of crappy snowbridges and the speeding up glacier. If you don't have glacier skiing experience and knowledge you should use a guide because if shit hits the fan you won't be such a burden to the PGHM."
skiing,34lqoo,tae34,2,Sat May 2 10:26:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah we're intending to get a guide, and thinking either late February or early March time. We've done a few bits of off piste but nothing completely unpisted like this so we're taking it seriously."
skiing,34lqoo,blkdiamondskier,1 point,Sat May 2 12:40:01 2015 UTC,"I have done the Vallee Blanche once in April. It was awesome (basically a skiing religious experience). The actual skiing was not difficult, but I would recommend a guide so you do not fall into a crevasse. The hike right at the beginning (the arete) was pretty nerve-racking, because all you have between you and a 5000 ft. (1500m) drop is a small rope. Its definitely something I will remember for the rest of my life."

Just responding to the fact that they even mentioned his helmet, which leads me to believe he hit head first. I've seen my fair share of airlifts even when helmets were present. For example, low speed fall coming off a rail. Helmet took the impact, though the angle still caused a friend's brain to smash into his skull. Serious concussion and airlifted, but he was recovered a month later."

Not to mention the fact that you generally do replace a ski helmet after a single wreck unless it is a pretty beastly crash.

skiing,34ijcn,Sir_Joel43,3,Fri May 1 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"They're an interesting ride. Its a directional shape and mount location, but has an on snow feel of a much more center mounted ski. They are pretty easy going, feel fairly lively when just skittering around, but for some reason feel sorta dead when you really get on it and drive the ski. Overall, it very much feels like a park ski (lots of tail, not much tip, tons of low speed rebound/pop), but with a directional flex and rocker profile.  I personally am not really a fan, but I can see how others would have a pretty good time on the ski. And yes, sollys delam as a feature, but nothing that epoxy and clamps can't fix."

skiing,34ijcn,WEwtegq,1 point,Fri May 1 15:27:49 2015 UTC,"I have the Q98s and I LOVE them, but they also really just fit my style of skiing. They're really good in the trees and phenomenal in tight bump lines. They're good at laying carves in soft groomed snow, but if you're on a super-steep icy slope at high speed, they'll start to chatter a lot in the front end and get a little sketchy. That being said, the biggest limitation is that they're uni-directional and I love skiing backwards.   I have a fatter pair of twin-tip Icelantics for big-mountain/powder days and a pair of center mounted Shreditors as my jib ski.   The only thing missing from my quiver is a pair of straight-ahead charging skis."

skiing,34ijcn,WEwtegq,2,Mon May 4 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely worth a look. I have a pair of the Nomads and really like them. They're a bit heavy and you have to be strong/aggressive on them, but they're so stable and capable of virtually anything. You can drop a cliff and just keep skiing like nothing happened. They're just average on groomers, but with a touch of camber they're not bad at all.   I'd take a look and try to demo. They make a ski for virtually every situation."
skiing,34ijcn,DrFailsmith,1 point,Wed May 6 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"I had the predecessor, the rocker2 115, that was the year before they rebranded it as the ""Q"" line of skis. I absolutely loved the ski, as it was my first real powder tool. The stiffness, playfulness, and rocker is all there with plenty of everyday edge hold for groomer ripping. I thoroughly enjoyed them, but absolutely crushed out at least six spots along the edge over two seasons of hard skiing.  That being said, if you want a ski in that size range that is fully capable, naturally responsive, very durable, and just all around awesome, you'd better check out the Fat-ypus line of five point sidecut skis. The M5 is 106 underfoot and come in a rocker tip/tail or flat tail like the Salomon Q line does."

Every one of their skis that I own or have tried does everything you want it to without protest."

I don't believe they would of been able to ski anywhere near as good by the end of the week without the guidance of their instructor.  They're trained to actually teach people how to ski, using various methods and techniques as some people learn the art in different ways. If I were you, try and save as best you can and get those lessons. Or perhaps if you live near a snow dome/dry ski slope you can get some cheaper lessons there before you go."
skiing,34ge02,defmute,3,Fri May 1 09:05:15 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to say here; just because some of your friends may have decent experience, that doesn't mean they'll be able to teach the beginners how to ski, let alone ski well and with confidence."
skiing,34ge02,defmute,2,Fri May 1 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"Lessons are better but if you got no loot, skiing is fun either way.  I think a lot of resorts have rental/ticket/lesson packages that are reasonably priced- do some research and go to the mt. where you can get a good price."

Sometimes I forget there is skiing in places besides Colorado :) I really have no experience with skiing on the continent so I really don't know what a good price would be over there or even if the observation I offered is valid in Europe. In the states I would usually send beginners to a small resort that generally have packages (lift, lesson and rental) for less than $100 (£66) per person per day. One can easily spend 3 times as much at on of our premiere resorts."

skiing,34ge02,bunsen72,2,Mon May 4 18:40:22 2015 UTC,"80 for the lift pass + rental gear (for 1 week)    French ski resorts are in no way that pricy.   For Les 3 Vallées, which is the priciest ski area in France, the daily lift pass price at the season's peak is €58 (£43). If you take a week long pass, the daily price goes down by about €10.   Since there will be beginners in your group, buying a pass for the whole 3 Vallées area is pointless as it is really huge and you will not be able to enjoy all of it. If you're going to Val Thorens, the 7 days pass is at €262, making it €38 (£28) a day. See here, price chart in english.  Rental gear is usually about €15 a day, and the daily price also goes down if you rent all week.  Instruction price: depends of the school I guess. I picked the first one that came on the list of Val Thorens schools, and here is what I got. 6 full days of group lessons are €307 (£226). I advice taking only half days of lessons, because beginners tire very quickly unless they're athletic all-year-round."
skiing,34ge02,Lakebreak,2,Mon May 4 22:41:55 2015 UTC,"Our sneaky ski trip this year we were trying to book les deux alpes for the 1st  weekend of jan. Something screwed up on the website and apparently we booked Andorra instead only noticed this when I saw that we were flying into toulouse. Got onto the travel agents but there was no accommodation left in France. Gutted we ended up booking Soldeu in Andorra as they had snow (very slow start to the season this year).  Decided to go to ski school this year as there were only four of us and we are all different levels. This was my first time going to ski school in about 15 years. Got a package deal with crystal for €900 this covered everything flights, accommodation, half board, ski hire, lift pass and ski school. If you are comfortable on reds/black runs an extra €80 I'd highly recommend the ski elite class - extra days tuition or extra hour each day.  Can't recommend it highly enough, ski school is renowned here. Really enjoyed the class as everyone was a similar level so minimal faffing and actually learnt quite a lot. Was also impressed with the skiing. Was in pas de la casa (neighbouring town) about 20 years ago (1st ski trip) the town ain't pretty but really enjoyed the skiing there too.   Have skied in Andorra, Austria, France, Italy, Norway and Switzerland. Will definitely go back to Soldeu.  If you stick with Val Thorens don't forget to go to cafe Sneska at the top of the village."

skiing,34ge02,TheHairlessCat,1 point,Mon May 4 21:21:43 2015 UTC,"All depends on what you're looking for from price/accommodation/ski school to apres ski.  Picking the date is key, so is the number in the group. A point to note about ski school in Austria is that it can be pretty much all day long, great for learning not great for skiing with your mates.  Also some resorts have much more challenging skiing than others and can be very disconcerting for beginners.   Love being anywhere in the alps. If your group isn't too large you can decide on a date and then pick the venue a few weeks in advance based on conditions/cost. 2nd week in jan had the cheapest package deals this year.  3 valleys are great but can get quite busy though so there can be queuing. Pas de la Casa is cheap as is Soldeu. If longer ski school in Austria isn't problem then just avoid the harder resorts of St.Anton, Ischgl and Lech. Anywhere in Brixen im Thale. Had a great trip this year in Obergurgl it's more of a family resort though."

He probably posted this to his Facebook and showed everyone he knows with the ""look at me I'm so awesome and better and more extreme than you"" attitude.    This is why people get heckled and laughed at. They need to be cut down and put in their place. Someones wearing $1000 in new ski clothes they just bought and they're skiing brand new pow skis so they look awesome and can pose for pictures and show everyone how awesome and cool they are but they cross their skis and eat shit with people watching because they suck. They're an asshole and they should know.

Until I sold my bike this winter, I used to ride dh and row in the summer. Side note, rowing is quite possibly some of the best all round cross training IMO, including combined with skiing.   DH was just too expensive though. Between all the extra mileage on the car (in the summer I run dedicated summer tires that are pricey and wear quickly) and constant breaking of both me and bike parts, it just wasn't worth it. I was spending way more on that than skiing: I went through about $1k in just replacing broken/worn out parts alone last season.  Trail riding is also fun though. I wouldn't say its affordable, but bikes tend to get less broken all the time.. Also doesn't encourage pile driving trees and ragdolling through rock gardens to nearly the same degree."

Sure you can ride like a grandpa, but if your doing anything decent, just like in skiing, your going to fall sometimes. It's a very risky sport if your pushing your limits (downhill that is)."

Start on a hard tail bike. IE one that does not have a rear shock. (I'm pretty sure this is what you meant but hard tail and hard trail have drastically different meanings).  Always where a helmet.  Get comfortable on the bike on some easier semi flat trails. As you get better move to steeper trails and trails with more obstacles.

Not sure about the number, but I think it was 100k).

Binders get rebranded a lot.  The last time a small company really tried to push a binder they developed and produced it was Line (and those KNEE bindings (that I remember).  There is a lot more engineering that goes into a binding and it requires a lot of resources to really do it right.  That's why you'll see Tyrollia/atomic rebranded to a bunch of smaller botique ski brands like 4frnt.  Look rebranded to Rossi and dynastar to try and make a complete binder/ski set up, but the bindings took off and they are pretty popular too."

Where as with ski boot molds to make the shells, it cost millions to retool the molds to a new design. That's why most manufacturers try to get at least a few versions out of a boot before going to a new design.

As far as skiing is concerned, Kicking Horse and Revelstoke are both unreal, whereas I've found that Whistler can be pretty hit and miss between the weather and the flocks of visitors that pass through daily. Last but not least, Revy and Golden are both near Rogers Pass, arguably the most notable touring mecca in all of Canada. Honorable mentions could also go to Fernie, Nelson, and Rossland IMO."
skiing,34bxbu,iamOshawott,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"Could you go a little more in depth on whistler for me? How hit and miss is it? Do you think I would be disappointed spending an entire season there?   Right now it feels like I'm having to choose between great skiing and my preferred lifestyle (ie. the whistler vs revelstoke debate). I'm on the introverted side, and feel if I go to a secluded small ski town I'll just become a fuckin' recluse and only leave my house to work and ski. But moving to a town and having a shit winter scares me even more. I'd love any and all advice you could give me on this, thanks."
skiing,34bxbu,indiana_johns,1 point,Fri May 1 05:08:04 2015 UTC,"It's always a risk you know but your chance gets better if you go with the bigger resorts like Whistler, Sunshine Village and Banff. As for Whistler hit and miss mainly because we are still on the coast, we get wet snow and then we get fucked by Pineapple Express which leads to melting temperature during the day and freezing over night...HELLO ICE!!! If you want the fluffy stuffs, go to SunShine, Banff or any of the BC interior resorts like Big White, Revy, Kicking Horse, Fernie etc etc."
skiing,34bxbu,manonthecan2,1 point,Fri May 1 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's not like Revy is small. There's 3000 people there in the summer and the place blows up in the winter.   My advice would be to pick anywhere in the interior. And learn to ski back country. Revy, Kicking Horse, Fernie, Whitewater, you will be VERY stoked on any of these places. The interior has some of the best skiing in the world. If you want more night life check out Revy or Fernie probably. At the end of the day though you're there to ski so that shouldn't really matter that much."
skiing,34bxbu,electric_monk,1 point,Sat May 2 15:29:56 2015 UTC,Just saying Canada is very vague. What other factors do you want in the town. If you want great nightlife and awesome skiing but at a very expensive living price. Whistler is the place. If you only want to ski go to somewhere like Nelson or Golden.
skiing,34bxbu,electric_monk,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:02:40 2015 UTC,"Depends what type of skiing your after as well? fast sweeping downhill? black tree runs? offpiste steep? cross country on the side?  We spent 2.5 months touring around. Made it to 14 resorts.  For most reliable snow, we has most luck in Banff. Sunshine and Lake Louise are amazing. It is a little more touristy, and most of Calgary drives up on weekends. Oh Jasper was also great, but its a bit more isolated.  We also enjoyed smaller resorts - big white, panorama, sun peaks, but in terms of sleepy smaller towns, big white/kelowna is the best compromise of nice sleepy town and great snow.  4 times we drove through reve & golden, it was pissing down rain and barely freezing overnight. but that was unfortunate timing. I like the small town feel of reve though.  We toured south much through rossland, whitewater, fernie in february, and wasnt particularly good. Spend alot of time waiting for snow that didnt happen."

The terrain park is pretty pathetic compared to a lot of bigger areas in Colorado, but the with the addition of the Kachina Peak lift they have some of the best lift served terrain in North America."
skiing,34ak7v,mordwand,5,Wed Apr 29 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"Not from there but have been several times since I used to live not too far away.  They get a good amount of snow, and have a lot of hike-to terrain.  Definitely a great mountain."
skiing,34ak7v,lxmunch,4,Wed Apr 29 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"Was it UNM?  If so, there are a bunch of people that travel up there on weekends and breaks including me.  The terrain is awesome and you'll find everything from steep greens to hidden double blacks.  The last three winters have been a little below average excluding the dumb we had late February of this year.  If I had to criticize the mountain it would be the slow lifts and the short runs due to the steep terrain.  Let me know if you have any more questions."
