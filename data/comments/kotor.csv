BioWare = (UNFORTUNATELY) Working under EA, any new games coming from them are doubtful because of that (I'm very afraid of Battlefront. KotOR 3 from them would be a disaster, just a possibility). Plus, EA has the rights of Star Wars franchising at the moment. I wouldn't want to pay 3041413934â‚¬ to KotOR 3 just to play it on Origin, you know.  Obsidian = Working on their own things, expansions, some MMO's and other gaming stuff. There'd a problem with they wanting to make KotOR 3.   Things are pretty messed up as we can see. KotOR 3 should be a masterpiece, a game with 96-97 Metascore, a game with GotY award and such... It it weren't the franchising stuff, I almost want Bethesda to do a KotOR after Fallout 4 and TES 6."

kotor,3e5tg9,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:47:11 2015 UTC,"Most probably wouldn't. It was incompatible with TSLRCM, which means most people nowadays wouldn't have made use of it.  This day has ironically turned out to be one of the worst for KOTOR 2 in the past five years. New update potentially breaks several mods and makes savegames incompatible (haven't been able to test this yet), filefront goes down, the mod builds are fucked... it's been a hell of a strange day of highs and lows."
kotor,3e5tg9,Snigaroo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:51:43 2015 UTC,Ugh I KNOWWWW. It's so frustrating. The workshop would be starting from a much better spot if we still had access to filefront.   Also I wasn't aware the mod was RCM-incompatible so I guess that puts that to rest
kotor,3e5tg9,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:56:47 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of access to filefront is probably a good thing for the workshop, as strange as that might sound. More mods would probably be present on the workshop, true, but most mods on filefront were made by people 3 or more years ago. Some of the oldest were made right after the game released, in 2004. Those users aren't around anymore, and I can just see the workshop being flooded by their content simply claimed by new users. That would be a nightmare of people pointing fingers for stealing content, and would probably wind up being overwhelming for new players.  It's still terrible that filefront went down, though. A lot's been lost. But I was just thinking to myself: I finished the final update to my KOTOR 1 & 2 build two weeks ago. Even though I temporarily lost backups, it's looking like I'm going to get them back here from other users. I got those builds done in the absolute nick of time to preserve the best of what filefront had to offer. Even if we've lost a lot, at least some of the core content got saved."

Nobody expected this update to come through, and while it might be nice in some respects it could be really quite bad in others. TSLRCM has already updated to reach compatibility, but some older mods never may. We might lose a lot of great mods from the builds because of this, though I hope not."

When Revan attacked the Republic as a Sith, the Jedi Council exiled the Exile, so you were basically out of commission during that whole war."

Those Tombs are very glitchy, so it's also very common for to have that bug right there. So HK-47 was one of the messed up companions, and I'm not able to use the computers in Leviathan.

Something about the urban atmosphere makes it so much different than the rest of the areas in the game. Manaan comes close while the rest are all more like small little settlements and lots of natural areas.  Honestly, it'd be neat if someone made a mod that added a new character or set of characters on Taris who somehow make it off after the destruction. Or maybe a mod that reveals the Promised Land was actually an ancient Rakatan transport that got them past the Sith blockade. Maybe they've since scattered and only the newly created NPCs are found (because the mod wouldn't have voice actors to match the original voices of the original NPCs presumably).

According to Kreia, the Handmaiden eventually settles down to help rebuild the jedi order. She follows Atris's example and becomes a historian, teaching students about the exile.  Visas is much the same, although later she returns to Katarr to die, apparently ""seeing what she was supposed to see"".  You can only get Hanharr as a companion if you play a darkside character, so officially he plays a much smaller role. Spoiler  Your last question is difficult to answer. Originally, Obsidian's vision for the 3rd game was to have the Exile follow Revan into the Unknown Regions to join the battle against the true sith.  Officially, we got the mmo TOR, which acknowledges the existence of the exile but no other part of Kotor 2, and cannot seriously be entertained as a sequel."

If malachor is destroyed by remote and HK-47, Hanharr is supposed to throw you on to the ship before he dies.  Handmaiden and Visas has a catfight due to one lust for the male exile and see the other as an obstacle, if there is a large influence difference between them, but if they do not, depending on whether Malachor is destroyed or not, they can go back to the order and rebuild according to Kreia, or one of them stays on Malachor to point Jedi/Sith looking for Revan and exile in the right direction like Kreia does.  Where did the exile go? Kreia actually says Exile can do lots things at this point, follow Revan to unknown regions, help rebuild the galaxy and prepare for a true sith invasion, or if (s)he sees his(her) power as a danger, (s)he can become a hermit, basically, another adventure awaits like the ending of so many other RPG games."

People still bitch about games being broken, well guess what? they have a refund policy which nobody else can match at the moment, reddit was praising Steam for its refund policy, bitch please EA has had that for more than a year now."

They definitely give a fuck. It probably won't be bad, but EA does indeed fuck up every game at launch. Their servers are absolute shit at every launch for any game I've ever tried to play for like the last 5 years. I'm definitely not hating on EA for NO reason. My point is they rush games to be released at a certain time, and then it just so happens that the game barely works how it SHOULD on launch, and then takes about a month to patch. Not only that, but they release unfinished games to release the rest of the content as DLC. They're really not that good of a company."

I'm not saying EA is good, but you pretend like they're a lone shark in a sea of butterflies. Ubisoft's AC, FC & Watch_Dogs BS was waay worse than SimCity which was the worst shit EA has done lately and that was back in 2013.  EA do fuck up games at launch? How does that differ from Arkham Knight, Assassin's Creed Unity, Watch_Dogs?  Everything you just said apply to almost EVERY single AAA publisher, Activision release unfinished buggy games and wait a year to patch them after selling them as well, and they push pre-orders heavily. So does Ubisoft and they're even worse because Uplay is worse than Origin.  And Konami & Warner Bros does it well. Hell Konami is even ready to kill beloved gaming franchises, again NOT trying to praise EA. But start comparing them to other publishers please, EA are not the worst. They're just as bad as  Warner bros and Konami and Ubisoft are clearly the worst at the time.   What you describe is NOT only EA titles. The latest EA games I've played have been MUUUCH better at Launch than Arkham Knight and Assassin's Creed Unity was. Dragon Age: Inquisition was amazing in comparison at launch. So was Mass Effect 3 & 2. What problem did ME2 even have at launch?"

KOTOR is very similar to NWN, to the point it felt like a NWN with lightsabers,  but NWN also brought in a game editor, that allowed you to create your own campaign/module and allowed you to host those modules on your PC and your friends could join and play those modules via LAN or Online.

Keep in mind some of the biggest RPGs around that time were Planescape: Torment & Fallout games and the reason why some of these are unknown and some aren't is because Fallout managed to stay relevant while most of the early 2000 and late 1990s RPGs faded into video game history.

Especially if you are playing on the ""Difficult"" game difficulty, challenging the Handmaiden on the surface of Telos can prove to be quite the challenge. Their echani melee abilities can quite easily overwhelm the Exile. If you need to get an edge against them, the easiest way to do so is to literally knock them out of the ring!  Obviously this is not the way the game is meant to be played, but it is still worth some laughs!

I mean even though kotor takes place 3k years BBY, how much has changed in between? I mean as far as technologically, there was little difference in what they possessed. As for mastery of the force, I'd argue that many jedi and sith from the jedi civil war era had a greater knowledge of the force. For example, the sith of of that period had direct access to korriban and the treasure trove of dark side knowledge there. The jedi of that time period are arguably weaker seeing as how hesitant they are to strike out at a threat. Then comes the sith triumvirate from TSL along with the exile; Dart Sion is essentially unkillable in single combat, Darth Nihilus is a base expression of hunger and greed and can absorb the life force of entire planets at a time. Then there's the exile, a literal wound in the force. Who by the end of TSL has the power to form and project echoes into the force powerful enough to literally kill the force."
kotor,3de4y1,apothecary1796,7,Wed Jul 15 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Also Kreia refers to Revan as ""The heart of the force"", that's what she see's when she looks at him.

Guessing from the Revenge of the Sixth novelization where they explain how the Sith have evolved and the Jedi hadn't and that's why the Sith beat Jedi with ease, I'd imagine that the average Jedi was about the same as a prequel era Jedi, and the Sith are superior to the KOTOR Sixth grunt.

We don't have many time hoppers/ active artifacts/individuals so it's not really fair to judge.   Exar Kun made a mess of Yavin for Luke but he was also using the power of Kyp Duron for some of it.  Marka Ragnos got beaten by Kyle Katarn.  Darth Vader beat Celeste Morne but was too afraid of Karness Muur to attempt to use him vs Palpatine.  Cade Skywalker Popped Karness Muur  ect  Combat Knowledge: If the Jedi and Sith record things properly the Movie era duelists would have more knowledge as they'd have thousands of years of knowledge. Based on the number of times Jedi and Sith items have been destroyed I doubt they actually have good records of combat.  Experience:  A large % of the populous in the KOTOR era use swords and Jedi and Sith are more common.

Revan's best kills atm are Darth Nyrisis (sp) and Darth Malak.  He's got 4 personal in combat losses at the present (All added by SWTOR/Revan Book)  That's not terribly impressive. His wars aren't that great either. Mandalorians were outnumbered badly and doomed eventually from the start. His biggest victories against the Republic were backstabs. At the Star Forge the Republic wins the battle in space as long as Bastila is not doing battle meditation against them. Given sufficient time the Republic likely would win without you.  Unless you value experience the KOTOR era people don't necessarily come off that well.

Maybe what people dislike the most about it is that it doesn't address KOTOR 2 properly and it doesn't let you play as Revan or The Exile, but it does do a well job on expanding the universe in other ways, if anything Bioware was ambitious, maybe too much, the game released with more than 40 companions, and they are well made just like you would expect them from a game like Mass Effect or Dragon Age, they even brought in people that did voiceover from KOTOR 1 & 2 to do voiceover for the new companions, might be woth checking out at some point."
kotor,3d9bkv,AlphaLupi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"for sure, i dont doubt at all that bioware did everything they could do to make swtor work as both a proper followup to kotor and a successful mmo and i'm sure they did as good a job of it as possible. though i'll never play swtor you wont find me telling other people not to if they wanna play a good mmorpg, a good game set in the kotor universe, or just one of the rare star wars rpgs thats actually fun.   i think the thing is despite all that, for myself and i'm willing to bet for a lot of other kotor fans too, there are essentially two things that stop me from supporting swtor at all: swtor was the game that meant i'd never get to play kotor3, and swtor could never be considered a proper followup because its an mmo.   in all fairness i really loathe mmorpgs in general after spending a few years playing em, so maybe there are a lot of folks who love kotor and dont have the same hangups. but still i think the nature of mmos means i could never enjoy swtor as some kind of sequel to kotor, no matter how i felt about mmorpgs themselves. basically i think mmos are forced to construct a story around the game instead of having a game built around a story, just because the length of an mmo is indeterminate compared to a single player game with a definite beginning-middle-end.   maybe its a bit like the difference between a movie and a tv show - when you make a movie you're guaranteed enough time to finish whatever story it is youre telling, provided thats what you want to do. tv shows dont have that luxury - they have no idea if theyll run for 9 episodes or 9 years, if theyll never get to finish what they started or if theyll have to push beyond whatever they originally wanted to say. nothing wrong with either medium, but there are inherent differences to each that fundamentally change how you tell a story. i think its essentially the same with kotor/swtor - kotor 1 & 2 were like two great films that have so far followed your basic 3 act setup that we all know so well from the original star wars trilogy, but instead of making the last movie bioware made a show for network tv that introduces a lot of great stuff and characters but doesnt come close to resolving the story they started with the first two films.   as a side note i never really bothered to sit down and figure out why i feel as negatively towards swtor as i do, so this conversation has been a lotta fun for me. hope i dont come across as upset with you or dismissive of your points or anything."
kotor,3d9bkv,AlphaLupi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"I feel kinda bad for Bioware, they're good at making single player RPGs and somehow they got the idea that they could make an MMO, 9 years ago, when MMOs were the next big thing, a Star Wars MMO made by Bioware probably sounded like a great idea on paper, but by the time swtor released, MMOs were already on the decline, most of them going Free-to-Play like Elder Scroll Online, Wildstar and even SWTOR itself, if you look at the market now, no new big MMOs are coming out in the west like they did before, even Blizzard wised up and cancelled Titan before it turned into a money loss for them.  So Bioware is like in this uncomfortable position that they made a game of a genre that's not so popular anymore, and they're reconverting a lot of the stuff in the game to appeal to the ""Single Player RPG"" type of gamer, but in the process they're kinda alienating the playerbase that already have, like raiders and PVPers."
kotor,3d9bkv,Snigaroo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"yeah it was a little disheartening to see bioware jump into the mmo arena at all. hindsight is 20/20 and all that but even at the time it seemed obvious that mmorpgs werent gonna be the phenomenon/cash cow wow's sucess made it out to be.   even still, if bioware just decided to make an mmo that had nothing to do with kotor but required too much money and attention to make kotor 3 i wouldve been willing to try it. instead it just felt like bioware wanted to cash in on their star wars/kotor fanbase and sacrificed kotor to ensure swtor's success. it definitely sounds like theyve done everything possible to make the single player side of swtor as high quality as anything bioware puts its name on, and they likely fared much better at that than i realize.   in the end though i just cant forgive bioware enough to give swtor a try. even though theyve done a lot to make the game work as an mmo and a star wars rpg you couldnt really convince me that swtor was the way theyve always wanted to complete the kotor story, or that it was the best way to complete it, at least from an artistic/non financial perspective. in my eyes bioware sacrificed my favorite game series to grab dem WoW buxxx, which is a shame because swtor sounds like the only mmorpg in the market i would actually enjoy."
kotor,3d9bkv,ametalshard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"Well, my position is not popular but I think the MMO should be considered part of the trilogy, at least given how things are now. it's the only game that carried on with the story.  That doesn't mean you have to play it, especially if you lost confidence in Bioware, I would still recommend to check out a playthrough on youtube maybe, see what you think."
kotor,3d9bkv,Snigaroo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"yeah it was a little disheartening to see bioware jump into the mmo arena at all.   To be honest, with KotOR 2 in mind I have trouble imagining the series without an MMO. Especially with TSLRCM there are many hints that a huge war is coming. I doubt a single player game could do that war justice.  Unfortunately they added the time gap and made it a generic Star Wars MMO instead of a KotOR MMO. (I am often wondering how a real KotOR MMO could have been.)"
kotor,3d9bkv,Snigaroo,2,Wed Jul 15 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"Well, this is r/kotor. It's probably going to be the majority opinion here. A lot of us longtime die-hard KOTOR fans really don't like TOR and what it did to the series.  I've heard that Bioware has acknowledged that SW:TOR didn't really cut it as KOTOR 3, and that they're trying to make ""Knights of the Fallen Empire"" more SP in style, or something like that. If that's true, then that's all well and good, but it's about 10 years too late for that. They've already ruined most of the characters and storylines from the original characters that I doubt anyone here who originally passed on TOR is going to pick it up and give it another chance. There's just no point anymore."
kotor,3d9bkv,Snigaroo,42,Tue Jul 14 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"Screw trying to make it fit in with SW:TOR. I'd rather a KOTOR 3 just pretend like TOR doesn't even exist. Bioware didn't respect or care about the original games, and retconned the plot to fit their new storyline when they felt like it - why shouldn't KOTOR 3 do the same? Just continue straight from where KOTOR 2 left off and ignore all the garbage that TOR added.  But really, it's never going to happen. These posts are kinda fun but I feel like they come up every week."
kotor,3d9bkv,Ecko09,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"But KOTOR has always been Bioware story, Obsidian took over for the sequel and left the story in a cliffhanger, if anything Bioware aknowledged the whole ""True Sith in Unknown Space"" cliffhanger and expanded on that plot on SWTOR.  The Story on SWTOR is also very good, but all the MMO grind turned out to turn off a lot of KOTOR fans, so I understand why people don't like it.  And how do you know KOTOR 3 is not being developed as we speak? Big RPGs take around 6 years to make."
kotor,3d9bkv,Maaruin,26,Tue Jul 14 16:05:34 2015 UTC,"Jesus dude, you've got everything wrong in your head about this. You're mixing hope and naivete in dangerous amounts.  KOTOR has not always been BioWare's story. That's like saying that Fallout has always been Black Isle's story, when there's been four studios to work on it. KOTOR isn't a collaboration, but it can't be owned or claimed by a single studio; as much as BioWare did for it with the original, Obsidian did for it with the sequel. The only thing BioWare can claim is its creation, but just as with Fallout that doesn't mean that they automatically deserve (or possess) creative control.  As for BioWare respecting the plot... no. No, not at all. Have you actually played KOTOR 2? Have you actually read the Revan novel? They ignored 95% of KOTOR 2, and swept the rest under the rug when possible. They absolutely did not respect what Obsidian did with the plot, which is why I think they don't deserve creative control. They didn't try to understand the second game at all. What you claim they did--respecting the True Sith concept--they didn't do at all. The ""threat on the edge of perception"" concept was present even in KOTOR 1, and that's why BioWare used it at all; KOTOR 2 just borrowed the concept and expanded on it to create the True Sith plot. Indeed, BioWare wholly ignored KOTOR 2's conceptualization of the True Sith, and its argument that Revan had seen the threat on his own and decided to make a sacrifice to defeat it. Instead, now some immortal Sith Emperor corrupted Revan and Malak and made them Sith, which completely defeats KOTOR 2's entire message that Revan fell as a choice.  The story on SWTOR is very good, you say. Only if you like MMOs, and only if you like grinding to be given your story elements. And, even then, only if you like the kind of story they're telling you. I found most writing in the MMO to be poor, I found most voice acting to be similar, and I couldn't even begin to get immersed. This is if you're ignoring the basis for the plot in the first place--an immortal Sith Emperor and a Sith force which suddenly stops fighting the Republic for gameplay purposes is already confusing and immersion-breaking enough.  As for KOTOR 3 being developed currently, I'm so confident it's not happening that I would put money on it. For one thing, no, big RPGs don't take six years to make, and I've no idea where you pulled that figure from; it can be as low as 2 and as high as 8, but six isn't the norm. Three is closer to it.  And I do hope, though I would hazard to doubt, that you understand the canon restrictions which prevent a KOTOR 3 being made. KOTOR 1 and 2 aren't canon anymore, and neither is TOR. Even if all three were to be made canon, Disney is in charge now. Unlike Lucas, who was willing to overwrite some of his own plot in return for new content being produced, Disney created the Legends system in the first place so they could start over fresh and not create a new series of canon that would be winding and contradictory.  With that in mind, if TOR were to be made canon there wouldn't be a KOTOR 3. Disney won't allow their canon to be overwritten so shortly after they've come to control the IP, and probably never will at all. The only way a KOTOR 3 could ever possibly be made is if KOTOR 1 and 2 were remade and re-released as canon releases but TOR was not, leaving it in Legends and re-establishing KOTOR 1 and 2 canon. That is NOT likely.  This game isn't as popular as you think it is. Suits don't see KOTOR when they read about TOR profit margins, they see TOR. And when Disney sees TOR, they see Legends, not canon, and they have no reason to want to make the predecessor to their current cash cow into canon, either. You're expecting something will happen just 'cause you want it to, but it won't."
kotor,3d9bkv,Maaruin,6,Tue Jul 14 16:27:34 2015 UTC,You've summed it all up pretty well. It's too bad fans of the SWTOR and novel storyline will never be able to comprehend that none of the shit in those two ever had anything to do with the Kotor games. It's honestly blind-blowing how they try to retcon reality like there was actually any mention or hint of the Emperor.
kotor,3d9bkv,Ecko09,2,Wed Jul 15 00:43:51 2015 UTC,"What I meant with Kotor being Bioware story is that they created it and they are the ones that have control of it currently, I think Obsidian also did a great job and I did play Kotor 2 and I thought it was a good game.  I've taken my time going through old archived posts from 2004 to 2008 of what people thought of the ""True Sith"" and what most of the people familiar with the lore concluded with is that the True Sith were survivors of the Great Hyperspace War, the red skinned race native to Korriban, and even the some kotor fans came to the conclusion that if Revan was going up against an Empire on his own, that he would fail.  And even Kreia mentions repeateadly that ""a true Sith Empire lies elsewhere"" I don't understand why people are surprised that this Sith Empire turned out to have an Emperor, and that he was powerful.  According to many people, swtor is not a great MMO either, but at least I recognize that they did a great work to make it consistent not only with Kotor 1 & 2, but also with other material existing in the Old Republic era, such was the Golden Age of the Sith comics.  And regarding KOTOR 3 never being made, we simply don't know, but if Battlefront 3 is being made, I don't think KOTOR 3 is out of the table =P"
kotor,3d9bkv,ametalshard,11,Tue Jul 14 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"What I meant with Kotor being Bioware story is that they created it and they are the ones that have control of it currently   That's not the case either. KOTOR isn't an IP like Mass Effect or Dragon Age, it's a particular story set in an IP which Disney owns. They're the only ones making use of it currently, but that does not mean control. Technically Disney could give any other studio the go-ahead to produce another KOTOR game simultaneous to BioWare right now... though they won't.   I've taken my time going through old archived posts from 2004 to 2008 of what people thought of the ""True Sith"" and what most of the people familiar with the lore concluded with is that the True Sith were survivors of the Great Hyperspace War, the red skinned race native to Korriban, and even the some kotor fans came to the conclusion that if Revan was going up against an Empire on his own, that he would fail.   That... isn't relevant? Revan didn't go up against the Sith Empire on his own, because the Exile and several allies, probably including Atton and the droids, were supposed to be with him. BioWare killed her off and rewrote what the story was intended to be, according to Obsidian's ending.  Also it's very much worth noting that the Sith ""Empire"" is a construction of TOR--nothing was known about the True Sith from KOTOR 2 except for a few snippets, most of which I cover here.   And even Kreia mentions repeatedly that ""a true Sith Empire lies elsewhere"" I don't understand why people are surprised that this Sith Empire turned out to have an Emperor, and that he was powerful.   Because she says nothing about an Empire. We know the True Sith exist, but we know nothing about them. I'm not surprised they have an Empire, but I'm surprised they have an immortal Emperor, because the reason for that is plot-based and nothing else. It was a change made for plot convenience, to explain away why the True Sith didn't collapse, and it's utterly stupid like half the shit TOR does.   According to many people, swtor is not a great MMO either, but at least I recognize that they did a great work to make it consistent not only with Kotor 1 & 2, but also with other material existing in the Old Republic era, such was the Golden Age of the Sith comics.   Jesus Christ, do you actually believe this? Do you think they worked to make the game consistent with KOTOR 2?  Oh man, if so, you either need to replay KOTOR 2 or take off those rose-tinted glasses. They did next-to-nothing to ensure KOTOR 2's plot was carried over into the MMO. They literally killed or ignored characters to not have to deal with them. They dropped entire plot points and never spoke of them again. Even claiming that they worked hard to make the MMO work with KOTOR 2 is facetious at best and trolling at worst. SWTOR is a game based of the original KOTOR, and that's IT. They only included what of KOTOR 2 they absolutely had to, and that's a great deal of the reason why I hate the MMO.   And regarding KOTOR 3 never being made, we simply don't know, but if Battlefront 3 is being made, I don't think KOTOR 3 is out of the table =P   So says everyone who comes into the sub weekly to make a thread like this, and for the last two years they've been foiled in their hopes. Hope doesn't make the world go around, friend, money does. And it's more profitable to leave the MMO up than make a sequel.  You want a KOTOR 3? Don't play the MMO. Let it die, then start loudly demanding a KOTOR 3. You might get it then, but I doubt it."
kotor,3d9bkv,ametalshard,2,Tue Jul 14 17:25:41 2015 UTC,"Well, of course Bioware doesn't own the IP, but they are the only ones writing stories for the Old Republic era at the moment, could now Disney give control to someone else? Maybe, but who would make a great KOTOR RPG if not Bioware? I remind you that the lead writer for KOTOR 2 is no longer with Obsidian.  I'm not commenting on the novel because I didn't read it, but as far as the game is concerned, Bioware's concept of the True Sith that Obsidian set up in the Kotor 2 cliffhanger didn't contradict what Kreia said and managed to connect it well to old comics, like the ones about the Great Hyperspace War, and Kreia did say the Sith have an Empire.  Also, Sth Lords being able to preserve their spirit, posses people or seek immortality is not something crazy or new, it has been mentioned and/or explored in other Star Wars stories, so one Immortal Emperor existing in that era is not that crazy either (two is, but one no).  I don't deny that many plots from Kotor 2 were dropped (the game takes place 300 years after it, everyone in those plots must have died out) and that the game mostly is based of the original Kotor, since they brought in the writer of the original Kotor to collaborate with the story, and as far as I know Obsidian was not involved at all.  It would have been nice to see them bring in maybe Chris Avellone to contribute a bit, but it didn't happen.  Unlike Battlefront 3 I don't expect a KOTOR 3 anytime soon, but I do think something might come up when the story of SWTOR has run it's course."
kotor,3d9bkv,ametalshard,5,Tue Jul 14 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but who would make a great KOTOR RPG if not Bioware?   Let me count the ways:   Obsidian (even without Avellone, Sawyer is better than anyone at BioWare, and Avellone still does freelance game writing and would likely assist Sawyer as a freelance if the IP returned to Obsidian) CD Projekt Red (doesn't matter if they wouldn't take it, this is hypothetical, and I'm convinced they'd do better at this stage) Bethesda (better than BioWare, if not a good KOTOR RPG)   Obsidian would be my first choice still, obviously, and the other two would never happen, but I honestly believe any of the three could create a better KOTOR RPG. I even believe the open-world model of Bethesda would produce a better RPG than BioWare could at this phase using their traditional formula.  It's clear to me that you're a BioWare fan first and a KOTOR fan second. You won't find many people on this sub who agree with you in that. In my opinion, everything BioWare has made following ME2 has been lackluster at best and absolute irredeemable shit at worst. I don't trust them to make me an omelette at this point--DA:I was only a step in the right direction, and for all the effort they put into it it still had huge flaws.

And comment all you'd like on how Sith preserving their spirits has been established (it has and I'm not arguing that), the idea of a Sith preserving himself as a spirit or pseudo-spirit for thousands of years and not a single one of his advisors figuring it out and exploiting it in all that time is ludicrous.  It was a plot device, pure and simple. Just like Revan being held in stasis that whole time was, it was done wholly to build the story they wanted. Which happened to exclude anything interesting about the True Sith which KOTOR 2 hinted at, and completely retconned Revan's interactions with them as established in K2.   I don't deny that many plots from Kotor 2 were dropped (the game takes place 300 years after it, everyone in those plots must have died out) and that the game mostly is based of the original Kotor, since they brought in the writer of the original Kotor to collaborate with the story, and as far as I know Obsidian was not involved at all.   It's not about ""dropping"" plots at all, though they did do that. They straight retconned things that KOTOR 2 established: Revan now really falls to the Dark Side instead of doing it as a sacrifice; the Jedi Order is now reestablished by Juhani and Bastila, not the Exile's companions; Kreia was wrong about the Force; Malachor has no plot significance. Everything that the second game did was ignored by BioWare because it wasn't their product.  Even with what you've admitted about dropped plot points, though, you must admit that the game doesn't do any credit to KOTOR 2, and that BioWare did not put any effort, serious or otherwise, into meshing the plots of the original and the sequel into the MMO. They worked almost entirely with the plot of the original KOTOR and nothing else, and cannot be said to have done a ""great job"" making everything line up. They made half of it line up.  Just because BioWare was the one making the game doesn't mean they should have just dropped the entire story of the sequel. They did it to save time, money, and to keep fans from the original game focused on their product rather than on a product produced by Obsidian. It was an absolutely smart business decision, but from a storyline perspective it's disgusting and it's poisoned the MMO for me (and many others) permanently."

Did Revan really fall or he let himself fall as a sacrifice? Only Revan knows that (and people that really know him like Kreia) the people that lived 300 years after that don't know what his true intentions were or what he was thinking, they only know what the historic records say. I do say this, the Emperor instructed Revan to prepare everything for his return, and Revan went and did whatever the hell he wanted instead, so take that as you will.   the Jedi Order is now reestablished by Juhani and Bastila, not the Exile's companions; Kreia was wrong about the Force; Malachor has no plot significance   Who did or didn't reestablish the Jedi Order doesn't really play in the story of the game, not sure why that was changed or what source is there of this, as for Kreia's ideas on the Force and Malechor I'm not sure how that can be carried on since Kreia is killed and Malechor destroyed at the end of Kotor 2.

There is almost no mention of the things that happened in KOTOR 2, that's true, no mentions of the characters either...   except there are 2 characters, one very minor, and another very major that are named Marr (maybe descendants?). I mostly think it's because KOTOR 2 was Obsidian story and they didn't want to intrude on that, they wanted to tell their own story.  Much like in KOTOR 2 and even Neverwinter Nights 2, Obsidian wanted to tell their own story, with their own protagonist, companions and villains instead of continuing with what Bioware did, I don't think that what Bioware did should poison the relationship with fans of KOTOR2."

In KOTOR 2, it's established that Revan did not find the True Sith during the Mandalorian wars. He found Malachor, one of their outposts, and learned some things about them, but he never met them. He was afraid enough of them based off of Malachor, however, that he made a sacrifice, ""falling"" to the Dark Side as a choice in order to conquer the Republic and strengthen it enough to face the Sith threat. That's the interaction that TOR retcons by having Revan meet the Sith Emperor.  Any sort of argument that says ""oh, well we don't really know what he's thinking"" is just covering up BioWare's actions. They retconned it, plain and simple. If you have to interpret TOR in a twisted way to get it to be compatible with KOTOR 2, that's bad. BioWare made it so Revan met the Emperor, Revan really fell to the Dark Side, he wasn't principled, and he didn't have any plan for his conquest. He was just another Sith according to them, and by claiming that they shat all over all the good KOTOR 2 did for the series.   Much like in KOTOR 2 and even Neverwinter Nights 2, Obsidian wanted to tell their own story, with their own protagonist, companions and villains instead of continuing with what Bioware did, I don't think that what Bioware did should poison the relationship with fans of KOTOR2.   I disagree entirely. Obsidian made their own story, but they completely made it with the original in mind. They took their story and connected it back to the original, and set the stage for a grand trilogy where both games could link up in KOTOR 3 and conclude their stories together. BioWare was the one who prevented that from happening; BioWare was the one who ignored KOTOR 2. And you can bet they didn't do it to be respectful, they did it because it saved them money and kept their product focused.  If you think what they did shouldn't poison the relationship between them and KOTOR 2 fans, well... too late. Most of the comments in this thread seem to be reinforcing that."
kotor,3d9bkv,Maaruin,2,Tue Jul 14 19:18:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was a plot hole, I said it was a plot device. It was used by the writers because it was a convenient way to do the story they wanted even though it didn't make complete sense.   Weird, I thought you also called it a plot hole, anyway, the existance of an immortal emperor, in and of itself shouldn't be that much of a shocker since we established dark rituals to extend one's life already existed in the Star Wars universe.   In KOTOR 2, it's established that Revan did not find the True Sith during the Mandalorian wars. He found Malachor, one of their outposts, and learned some things about them, but he never met them. He was afraid enough of them based off of Malachor, however, that he made a sacrifice, ""falling"" to the Dark Side as a choice in order to conquer the Republic and strengthen it enough to face the Sith threat. That's the interaction that TOR retcons by having Revan meet the Sith Emperor. Any sort of argument that says ""oh, well we don't really know what he's thinking"" is just covering up BioWare's actions. They retconned it, plain and simple. If you have to interpret TOR in a twisted way to get it to be compatible with KOTOR 2, that's bad. BioWare made it so Revan met the Emperor, Revan really fell to the Dark Side, he wasn't principled, and he didn't have any plan for his conquest. He was just another Sith according to them, and by claiming that they shat all over all the good KOTOR 2 did for the series.   Right, Revan didn't learn about the Sith Empire in Malechor, but after he was done with his business in Malechor he found the clues of the Sith on another planet and actually ends up finding the empire and meeting the emperor.  Regarding the fall of Revan, again, anyone that plays swtor learns about the events of Kotor through historical records on the Jedi Archive, and even if when you end up crossing paths with Revan in during the story, you never get to ask him ""Was getting caught part of your plan?"" or something along those lines.  For most people in the swtor era he is seen as an historical figure, or a legend, some remember him as Jedi and others as Sith, some NPCs even mention that there are conflicting records regarding his sex (kinda like a nod to KOTOR2 where Revan's sex was ambiguous and the player is the one that determines it lol)  The things you brought up sound like very minor retcons, and while what Revan did in the past was very important for the plot, he is not that big of a character in vanilla swtor, he barely appears during the game and there is never a chance to talk to him and learn his motivations, in the same way that you talk to Kreia and what she knew of Revan died with her, I guess.  Maybe swtor greatest sin in this regard is that they didn't consult with anyone from Obsidian to at least get advice on how to integrate swtor with kotor2. If they had maybe brought in Avellone as advisor like they brough in Karpyshyn maybe they wouldn't have earned so much hate."

I think the problem is that they tried too much to make the True Sith like the Galactic Empire. They use Star Destroyers, have grey ships and structures, have Moffs and Officers that look like they travelled back in time, and, of course, have an Emperor.  The Sith Elements of SWTOR I like the most are those that aren't copied from the movies. Some Examples:  Sith Sorcerer Armor, Dark Temple, Dread Masters"

The lore reason is that this Empire was the creator of many of the designs that are later going to be copied by others, including Palpatine. (But this is mostly to justify the business reason)  The business reason (and the true reason) is that they wanted to use imagery from the original trilogy and the prequels so people would go ""oh look! Star Wars"" and play the game.  Even during interviews about the original KOTOR, they said that their first ideas were to make it look way more ancient, similar to what we see in the Golden Age of the Sith comics, but they realized it looked so different from Star Wars that it wasn't really going to draw fans in, and it might end up turning them off, for being too different."

I don't know if SWTOR would have worked if the similarities to the movies were only on KotOR level. But I do wish they had made it a real KotOR MMO.

The only possibility for another KotOR game I see in the SWTOR continuity is one that focuses on the Rebuilding of the Republic after KotOR II. Because we know in broad strokes what happens before SWTOR, the stakes can't be as high as they were in the previous games. You can't be the one who prevents the galaxy from falling to the Sith/being eaten by a Sith. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing, too many games already have a ""save the world story"". Instead, have this one focus on rebuilding and intrigue.  Light side and dark side could still influence the ending. If you play light side, you restore a stable system in a Republic that grants freedom and justice for all citizens. If you play dark side, you end up as a Sith infiltrator in a position of power, exploiting Republic worlds for your own gain. (Both endings fit with SWTOR reasonably well.)"

It's changed a bit over the years - there's an interview with Avellone and a couple guys from Obsidian where they talk a little bit about their ideas for a KOTOR 3, and so since then I've ran with their ideas. One of the things Avellone mentioned was that he intended KOTOR 3 to pick up with the Exile and have him/her travel into the Unknown Regions right into the heart of the True Sith. So I've always imagined KOTOR 3 starting off with you following in Revan's footsteps, finding the other hidden places that he stumbled upon in the Mandalorian wars that eventually led him to the real threat.  Also, I don't like SW:TOR's sith empire (surprise!). It's too much of a Galactic Empire knock-off to me, plus I've never been a fan of the visual design of the Sith where they are all red-skinned with black tattoos and spikey shoulders. It's just unimaginative and childish - like they're beating you over the head with the fact that they're so eeeeeevuuuulllll. This empire, or... civilization, should evoke this ancient powerful dynasty, not a bunch of cackling, mustache-twirling freaks with a bondage fetish. In the old Tales of the Jedi comics the Sith almost had an ancient Egyptian vibe to them (not that I particularly love the TotJ portrayal either, but there were some good things about it). Personally, I think the True Sith threat should be portrayed in such a way that makes you wonder if maybe they aren't destined to destroy the Republic and rule the galaxy, and maybe are even the better choice in the long run compared to the weak, crumbling Republic. That's a more interesting story to me.   I've also thought it would be interesting if, when you finally encounter the True Sith (whether you find them or they invade), Revan has become one of the lords/leaders/generals in this army. Since Revan's plan to strengthen the Republic against the invasion was essentially thwarted, and he struck out on his own to fight them, I always assumed that meant he would try to infiltrate their ranks and weaken them from within. So you as the player would be left wondering what his actual endgame is, if he's really ""fallen"" and trying to defeat the Republic, or if this is all part of a bigger plan for him.  Other than that, I always wanted to see what happened to Malak's Sith Empire. I'd love to see how it survived after Malak was defeated (and DS Revan abandoned it), much like the Imperial Remnant in the EU. It's certainly still around in some capacity during KotOR 2, but what happened after? Did other Sith wannabes try to claim the Empire for themselves? Is it under the leadership of remaining generals? Would they help you fight against the True Sith - which is likely a threat to both them and the Republic - or would they join in and welcome their new masters?  And then there's the Mandalorians, which are rebuilding strength and trying to make their mark in the galaxy again. What do they do? Do they go to war for the Republic, or True Sith, or turn their backs on the whole war and focus inward? There's lot's of possibilities for all these different factions and how they respond."

I'd love to hear the stories people in this sub have come up with to conclude the KotOR saga in our heads.   I don't really have complete stories, but I do have ideas. For some Kotor II companions.  Bao-Dur  He returned to Telos to testify against Czerka about their activities in the restoration zone. Later, he sought out one of the other rough G0-T0 droids and convinced it to work together.

She went to Ilum, where she relapsed to the dark side. Brianna followed her and brought her back to the light. (This works better if the Exile was male and romanced Vises. In that case Brianna had to deal with ""loosing him"" while they were all travelling together and could in turn help Visas after she lost him as well.) Visas returns to her homeworld where she ""sees what she was meant to see"".  Mandalore  Well, here we have a problem. Kreia says that Mandalore will fight for Revan again. So in my SWTOR headcanon he took a large Mandalorian force into the unknown regions where he raided Sith shipyards and worlds for the rest of his life. In my non-SWTOR headcanon the Sith attacked much earlier, perhaps 20 years after KotOR II and the Mandalorians fought on the Republic side.  Malachor and the Sith  This is Malachor V's theme. And here it appears again in SWTOR. Now add to that something Atris learns about Malachor.  The Dread Masters were either created by Malachor, or they created it.

Their Empire is weak and on the brink of civil war after many years of existing without an external threat with which to focus on. Revan and the Exile manipulate events, assassinate leaders, and essentially further destabilize the Empire from within (If Revan was Dark Side they assume control of one faction)        After it falls into civil war, Revan sends the Exile back to get Canderous and his Mandalorians clans; which he has been rebuilding since the end of Kotor 1.  Revan uses the clans to completely destroy the remaining sith; possibly sacrificing themselves in the process (if lightside), or adds the clans to their forces and returns to conquer the republic (if Dark Side).       My second idea is that Revan searches the unknown regions, but finds nothing more that the ruins of long since fallen empire. They return to the republic only to find that the true sith are working in the shadows of the government of the republic itself, a sort of shadow government, and are influencing senators and events across the galaxy to further destabilize the republic and weaken the Jedi."

kotor,3cr01s,nermid,9,Fri Jul 10 03:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know the games are easy and ultimately I'm not trying to make a full build for this role, I was just wondering the benefits to a seemingly kinda useless feat."
kotor,3cr01s,Smartypnt4,10,Fri Jul 10 03:04:15 2015 UTC,"I always assumed this was for a pure caster build, to give you a small boost to defense when you have to take feats. The attack bonus is sort of wasted in that case.  It's been a long time since I last looked at TSL's feats, but for a caster, I don't think there's many that are really useful. Quantitatively, I think a dual-wield build always comes out ahead for pure damage, so I don't think dueling is meant for melee build.  From an RP perspective, if you wanted to play as a traditional single saber Jedi, dueling may be worth taking, but only after you've taken all the other more useful feats.   Also, the dueling feat could help with a single blaster build, which sounds interesting. I've done dual blasters, which was fun but stacking dexterity quickly makes you nearly unhittable, as well as making it almost impossible for enemies to deflect your shots.  *edit: saber vs. saver... silly phone keyboard."
kotor,3cr01s,Smartypnt4,6,Fri Jul 10 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I pretty much agree with your ideas on the build. Even as a caster it would probably be more useful to take conditioning and toughness, and two sabers for double the crystals (are there force regen crystals in TSL? I forget).  I'll just stick to the armor traits, flurry, and passives before I grab dueling. Thanks for your input."
kotor,3cr01s,Smartypnt4,5,Fri Jul 10 03:50:48 2015 UTC,"You're right about the dual sabers for double crystals. There's various different crystals - several that are attribute point improvement, including WIS and CHA."

kotor,3cr01s,worldbuildingvsconte,2,Fri Jul 10 04:01:46 2015 UTC,I remember switching from a dual-bladed saber to two single sabers in KotOR 1 when I found the two color crystals that have stat boosts just because I wanted both bonuses.
kotor,3cr01s,Zerg-Lurker,5,Fri Jul 10 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"I go single saber with dueling and finesse saber feats, and go dex heavy.   I read some  wiki that claimed your character would be hard to hit and powerful too.  I don't dual wield often enough to compare the two styles fairly, but I like the build."
kotor,3cr01s,Animal31,2,Fri Jul 10 05:42:51 2015 UTC,"Dueling helps if you are doing a build around maxed defense.  The problem is it doesn't work for some of the boss fights even if you cheat a little to get all of the max defense items if you are playing on the higher difficulties.  You also may find that your attacking feat selection is more limited. With max defense you get hit around 1 in 20 attempts from trash if memory serves rightly. If you use a feat that drops your defense to a point you can be hit by something other than a lucky twenty you've doubled the damage you take.  I personally enjoyed the build but, you need to be sure to have another set of gear or lots of grenades and possibly an alternative set of gear if you are going to try a high defense build."

In KoTOR you're introduced to these events and you'll probably be lost without that. Of course there's the simple advancement in gameplay, part of why people have trouble going back to older games.

Unless your building a mainly force user, then it would be better for 2 sabers because you can have 4 crystals to buff your wisdom and charisma."
kotor,3ck4y2,TheMadMandalorian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:41:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes it just as effective for on-hit procs, but stat and damage bonuses don't double, so two sabers is still more effective overall even if one of them has less chance to hit. IIRC, using a balanced weapon in the offhand and having the dual weapon mastery feat eliminates the hit chance reduction entirely. Tbh I always go with damage/hit/stat bonuses over procs, anyway."

kotor,3cfv9u,bloodstainer,7,Tue Jul 7 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"That seems like it would work pretty well. The biggest problem is that the player going first is at an information disadvantage. Any time you draw 2-3 low cards while your opponent gets runner-runner high cards you're a huge favorite to win (assuming you've still got cards in hand; even so, you have an advantage).  Another approach is just to have a statistical advantage in your deck. The yellow cards are basically independent rolls of 1d10, rather than drawn from a deck. Knowing that, the mode of 3 cards is  16 and 17 (has two modes), the mode of 4 cards is 22, and the mode of 5 cards is 27 and 28 (has two modes). You'll have a slight edge if your deck contains a mix of mostly +2/-2 and +3/-3 cards. I think I did something like four 3s, three 2s, two 4s and a 5, or maybe it was a 3-3-2-2 distribution, I forget. It's generally better to have options than all 3s and 2s, but an ideal hand would probably be a 1/4/5, a 2, and two threes.  You're still at an information disadvantage, but because the mode of 5d10 is higher than 26, and -6 is the highest negative you can play, your strategy has, perhaps, worse odds (edit: of hitting a 19 or 20). It's way more complicated than that, though, so my strategy might not be best. I should have kept track of my win rate."

kotor,3cfv9u,BUTTERNUBS1995,2,Wed Jul 8 11:38:34 2015 UTC,"The ELI5 version:   Pazaak doesn't use a virtual deck. A virtual Pazaak deck might contain 5 of each number 1 through 10. Then, when a player drew a 10 on their first draw (a 5 in 50, or 10% chance), it would be less likely for them to draw another 10 (a 4 in 49, or about an 8% chance). So it doesn't work that way.  How does it work? Each draw is independent of the others, and you have an even chance of drawing any number 1 through 10. So you can simulate this by rolling a die. In fact, since the whole attribute, skill, and combat system in KotoR is based on a d20 system, it's probably more accurate to say that the game simulates drawing a card at random by rolling a die. It rolls a 10-sided die, and then displays the result as a card.  Anyway, that's our starting assumption. I haven't tested it, I just read it somewhere.  Given that, let's graph what it looks like to roll 10-sided dice! (or Xd10, where X is the number of dice we're rolling). That will simulate what our expected score is after drawing X cards in a set of Pazaak.  3d10  4d10  5d10  Now the longest bar is the mode, and that just means the most common value in a group of values. That's what we expect to see most often, and thus is the situation we should prepare for.  At this point, I should note that I'm over-simplifying, because after every roll, there's a chance the choose whether to roll again. So really, the actual problem space would look something more 3-dimensional, buuuut... this is the simple version.  Basically, if we're doing a weather forecast, the weather says it's gonna rain 16s, 17s, and 22s, with the next-most likely numbers being +/-1 from each of those.  So when building our deck, +/-3 cards are grand because they get us 19 or 20 from nearly all those numbers. 2s are decent, 4s and 1s are cool. 5s are sometimes okay.  It's also important to realized that it won't be exactly 16, 17, and 22 all the time. It just clusters around those numbers. So you don't want all +/-3 cards, so you'd rather have a variety. But a variety skewed towards 2s and 3s.  So just build your deck with a variety of cards, but make sure the most common number in your deck is 3, the next is 2, then 4, 1, and 5. I'd never put a six in my deck.  Then just play as normal; try to hit 20 if you can, but conserve cards."
kotor,3cfv9u,branewalker,2,Wed Jul 8 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"Mode (statistics):       The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data. The mode of a discrete probability distribution is the value x at which its probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled. The mode of a continuous probability distribution is the value x at which its probability density function has its maximum value, so, informally speaking, the mode is at the peak.  Like the statistical mean and median, the mode is a way of expressing, in a single number, important information about a random variable or a population. The numerical value of the mode is the same as that of the mean and median in a normal distribution, and it may be very different in highly skewed distributions.  The mode is not necessarily unique, since the probability mass function or probability density function may take the same maximum value at several points x1, x2, etc. The most extreme case occurs in uniform distributions, where all values occur equally frequently.

Personally the way I play Pazaak is to force the AI to bust, because if they bust it doesn't matter what your hand is obviously so therefore you don't have to worry about competing hands if your opponent throws up the white flag for the round. This strategy works best when your opponent rolls a higher card total in the first two rolls such as a 10 and a 5 (making a total of 15) rather than a 1 and a 6 for a total of (7).

If Bioware had made the second game, a lot of what made The Sith Lords special would have been lost in another black and white story. Obsidian was able to create a great grey character driven story that made the companions and antagonists so much more developed than the characters of the first game. I can't say how things were done, with the MMO, but with the Revan novel, it made things black and white to her story that was never meant to be that way. Though, the weirdest character decision I read in the book was the Sith Emperor, because of how underdeveloped he was. He was less developed than Squint Malek, who only gets a pass, because of the KotOR comics, where he got some character development. Anyways, I think I drifted off point. I think I was going to say that they didn't really mess up what we learned about Revan in KotOR 2 since, there was not a lot of information told to us about him during that time.

Just go look up ""The Entity"" from SW:TOR - everyone talks about how bad they butchered Revan and the Exile, but here's proof that whoever wrote this game really didn't get it, at all.  I've said it before, but I wouldn't have had a problem with the MMO existing if it had stayed separate from the first two games and not tried to trample over everything that they set up. So much wasted story potential all so Bioware could sell their new MMO as the real sequel."

Revan then ""died"" and was given a second chance at life.  KoTOR 2    Dark Character Story about the aftermath of War. According to Kreia, Mical, GO-TO, HK-47, T3-M4 Mandalore and a few other characters, Revan was always Revan. Revan was never Light or Dark. Revan was a powerful Jedi. Perhaps the greatest Grey Jedi to ever live. It was revealed that Revan had a plan from the moment he/she set out to attack the Republic. That plan involved keeping Malak out of the loop (which would lead to their distain) and systematically testing the Republic under the guise of Conqueror. He was preparing it for the War to come, until his plan was halted by a vengeful, power hungry Malak who doesnt know about the True Sith threat.

kotor,3c78e5,geo000dune12,35,Sun Jul 5 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"From what I recall, after Revan defeated the Mandalorians and left known space, Kreia was expelled from the Jedi Order because it was assumed that her teachings is what led Revan to war.  Kreia began trying to trace Revan's footsteps during the war, to figure out what exactly happened, and she stumbled across Malachor V and discovered the Trayus academy, and began studying it, while simultaneously, Revan returned to known space and launched the Jedi Civil War.  After the JCW, Kreia (now Darth Traya) found Nihilus and Sion and trained them in the techniques she learned at the Trayus academy, got overthrown, and then begins KotOR2."
kotor,3c78e5,Brukhar1,91,Sun Jul 5 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"Not exactly.  It's heavily implied that Kreia was one of the Jedi on the ground at Malachor in the final assault. We all know the theory that Kreia is really Arren Kae, and most know that Kae was known to be on Malachor during the final battle, and thought to have died there. When Kavar meets Kreia in the rebuilt Enclave, he says something along the lines of ""I thought you died in the War."" So whoever Kreia is, Kavar knew her, knew she fought in the war, and thought she died in it. Not many Jedi died outside Malachor.  So the implication is that Revan placed her on Malachor's surface purposefully, probably to ensure her death. Remember, Malachor was an intentional move by Revan, designed to kill all the Jedi that he couldn't completely dominate while simultaneously destroying the Mandalorians. Kreia was a threat for many reasons: she had more pure knowledge about the Force than Revan did, she wasn't as susceptible to falling to the Dark Side as the rest of the Jedi on Malachor were because she had already left the order, and if she was truly Arren Kae she was already emotionally attached to another man who would have held more of her attention than Revan, the Echani general Yusanis. So Revan decided to have her killed so he could lead the Sith without any struggle for power.  But then Kreia didn't die. Rather, when Malachor was undergoing upheaval, the Trayus academy broke through the surface and Kreia found refuge within it. At the same time that the death all around Malachor was corrupting her mind and finally breaking down her barrier between being a Gray and a Sith, Nihilus was formed in orbit. His ship was crashing into the surface, and the raw death of Malachor unlocked the force potential within the lowly soldier; he ripped a ship from orbit and sought the Trayus below. It's unclear where Sion came from or if Nihilus or Sion reached Kreia first, but the Triumvirate was likely created within days after the events of Malachor.  So then why was it silent for five years? Why didn't they join Revan or Malak?  The important thing to remember is that neither Kreia, Sion or Nihilus were very strong immediately following Malachor. Sion was already basking in his pain, but his body hadn't yet been mostly destroyed, and only that level of agony gave him the strength we saw in KOTOR 2. At this point Nihilus was also a human and not an entity, still full of hunger but able to communicate normally and not absolutely mastered by his starvation. Kreia, too, had much to learn from the Trayus during this time, and much to try teaching Sion and Nihilus.  And it's also important to remember that Kreia was not a Sith in the way Malak was; Revan yes, but not Malak. She didn't join Revan for the obvious reason that Revan considered her a threat and would have tried to kill her, but when Revan ""died"" the last principled Sith outside Malachor died with him. Kreia did not consider Malak or his ilk to be true Sith, just hedonists drunk on the Force. She considered her teachings to be the only way to follow the Sith ideology in a principled manner, and might even have considered herself to be the only existent continuation of the True Sith ideology. So, to her, it was not inconsistent for her band of Sith on Malachor (because remember, she was training more than Sion and Nihilus; the Sith assassins and a few Sith Lords, etc., were also in training at the time) to coexist with the ""Sith"" of Malak. One group (Malak's) was false, and hers was pure.  After the war ended her band of Sith began to strike, probably by design. The false Sith of Malak were dispersed or dead, and the true band could begin moving in a galaxy which was largely empty of Jedi. Although it's not wholly clear, Kreia was probably the one who orchestrated the attack on Katarr after Atris sold the Jedi there out. She pulled the strings of her group of Sith as they assassinated the Jedi across the galaxy.  For a couple years this went on, until there were no easy pickings left. Post-Katarr there were maybe 10 Jedi left total, excluding the Exile, and it become nigh-impossible for the Sith to find them. This is when the struggle for power began, as Sion and Nihilus believed they no longer needed Kreia to pull strings since the Jedi were effectively dead, but Kreia wasn't willing to give up hunting until they were all gone. Sion and Nihilus betrayed her (Sion possibly physically raped her, it's unclear), one of them cut her off from the Force, and they threw her out of Malachor.  This began her period of wandering, which is the least-discussed period of her life in the games. We know it occurred, because there was a significant gap of time between when she was cast down at Malachor and when she met the Exile at Peragus, but we know little about it. During the time she regained her connection to the Force, became a Gray again, found the Ebon Hawk and T3-M4, and managed to track down the Harbinger just after Sion had found it. She also determined her plan to destroy the Force during this period. I would estimate her wandering lasted anywhere from 2 1/2 years to 1 year, ending with her finding the Exile on the adrift Harbinger and the beginning of KOTOR 2."

Few Jedi died outside of Malachor, and she had to get there at some point. Since Kavar thought she had died in the wars, and since she found the Trayus and created the Triumvirate there, it's highly likely she was part of the ground combat team regardless."
kotor,3c78e5,Snigaroo,9,Sun Jul 5 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that she was definitely at Malachor. I'm inclined to believe, that maybe Kreia saying she was Revan's first and last teacher might be misleading from when Kavar says it about Arren Kae. It's possible that Kreia, being the Archivist, may not have been a fully sanctioned teacher of Revan, and that Arren Kae was, according to the Jedi order, his first teacher, and last. I speculate that Revan may have gained some knowledge, and from what we know, he had a hunger for it, from Kreia. Knowing what he did of Kreia(he was very insightful too, I don't doubt he had his suspicions as to Kreia's true nature), I think it's understandable as to why he would seek her out after the fact."
kotor,3c78e5,headpool182,9,Sun Jul 5 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"Kreia was Revan's formal teacher, we know that for a fact, and not just from Mical. Atris and Kavar both confirm that Kreia taught Revan. Mical, however, may be misinformed about Kae being his formal teacher, as Mical is the only source that Kae taught Revan at all.  Or it could just be that Kreia is Kae--we'll likely never know. I've been considering bothering Chris about this in an email now that he's left Obsidian and the game isn't even canon anymore, but I haven't bothered because I know he'll probably still refuse to discuss it."

kotor,3c78e5,bloodstainer,2,Mon Jul 6 12:18:39 2015 UTC,"She died at Malachor, according to Kavar, and according to Disciple she at least trained Revan at one stage of his journey. Not to mention she was Brianna's mother. She was relevant enough to the plot to get a very brief mention, and if she really was dead there was good reason why they didn't show her.  She could still be Kreia, of course, but it's not like her being mentioned is odd if she turns out not to be Kreia. She's tangentially involved in K2's plot as it is."
kotor,3c78e5,Snigaroo,2,Mon Jul 6 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"Then why even bring her up? How many Jedi died at Malachor? If she was unimportant to the story they wouldn't even have wasted screen time with her. Just because she was Brianna's mother doesn't mean jack shit, just being her mother isn't being relevant to the plot at all, especially if she's dead.  It makes no sense to talk about a dead character which doesn't interact with the plot unless the theory is true. If the theory is false, then it means they wasted screen time on a dead character with no other ties than being a relative to one of the side-characters. That's really not Obsidian's way of writing when it comes to named characters."
kotor,3c78e5,bloodstainer,2,Mon Jul 6 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't say she was unimportant to the story; quite the contrary. If she was Brianna's mother, one of Revan's teachers, and the lover of the Echani general Yusanis, who Revan killed during the course of the Jedi Civil War, then she was rather important indeed. But worthy of only a brief mention because she was only tangentially related to the game's main plot, which is what she got: mentioned once by Kreia, once by Brianna, and once by Mical. And Mical was the only one to mention her outside the context of her being Brianna's mother.  I don't see how you could think that her being Brianna's mother is unimportant, given that the vast majority of the time spent talking about Kae was in relation to whether or not Brianna wanted to follow her footsteps and become a Jedi. Kae was the deciding factor on whether Brianna became a Jedi or not."

And no, the Exile was the deciding factor whether Brianna became a Jedi or not.  Also, you don't even get Brianna if you play female so that would also make Kae completely irrelevant if she has no other connection than Brianna."

He was mentioned a grand total of one time; does that make him an unnecessarily introduced character?"

kotor,3c78e5,That_Guy_you_kn0w,12,Sun Jul 5 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"The comic is great, honestly. If you're referring to the ""Knights of the Old Republic"" comics, that is. Revan only makes a couple tiny cameos and he/she is basically a faceless person. It does spend a good amount of time with Jedi Malak, but most of it is actually centered on the adventures of a Jedi framed for murder, who is on the run from his own masters (accompanied by a ragtag crew). You get to see some pivotal moments in the Mandalorian wars, but most of it centers around the Jedi's own quest for the truth and so you only see bits and pieces of the war through their adventures.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the KotOR era. I didn't really expect much from a prequel series to the games, but it avoids a lot of the frequent pitfalls that prequels fall into - you know, where every backstory is needlessly revealed, and every minor character from the games is given a cameo and an unbelievable connection to every single event (although the few cameos in the comic are very well done).  For example, there's an amazing scene near the end of the series (very minor spoilers) where they sorta ""tease"" Sion's origin story. You're led to believe that one of the characters is turning into Sion, and they're revealing his backstory, but then it goes in a completely different direction. It's well written because it gives you a kind of potential origin for the Sith Lord, and offers an explanation of what could have created him, but ultimately kinda pulls a bait and switch and leaves the character to a different path, while still leaving Sion's actual origins a mystery, which I really like.  And TOR canon is shit, but to the best of my memory the comic has absolutely no connection with the MMO.  In fact, it's one of the few things in the Star Wars EU that references themes and ideas from KotOR 2, and I love it for that. It's purely based on the games and sorta bridges the gap between the Tales of the Jedi series and the KotOR games, rather than trying to tie in later events.  Seriously, it's worth a read. It's just a good story with likeable characters that isn't afraid of telling it's own story without trampling on stories we've already heard, and when it does make the connections to the games, it's really well done."

kotor,3c78e5,bloodstainer,6,Mon Jul 6 12:21:14 2015 UTC,Which source(s) tell of a significant gap of time between Kreia's betrayal and her meeting the Exile?
kotor,3c78e5,veryalias,13,Sun Jul 5 17:46:08 2015 UTC,"No direct sources, merely implication. A lot of this is implication, although when you string it together there's a lot of evidence in support of everything I've said.  The most significant evidence has to do with the actions of Sion and Nihilus. They cautiously tolerate each other at the beginning of the game, and both of them are hunting Jedi (but for different reasons). Both of them believe the Exile to be the last of the Jedi, and both of them are rather brazen in their attempts to eliminate her. I mean, hell, Sion attacks a Republic ship, deploys a practical legion of his assassins, and destroys an entire planet trying to get to her, and Nihilus sends his one and only apprentice to find her and bring her to him.  That's desperation. Both of them believe that the Exile is the last of the Jedi, and both think she's a threat. Sion wants to kill her so the Jedi will finally be eliminated and he can seize total control; Nihilus wants her because he's starving.  And Nihilus is the more compelling evidence here. When he consumed Katarr, he killed so many Jedi that he was largely sustained. But that was 4, maybe 3 years before the events of KOTOR 2 at best. The Nihilus we see in the game has lost all control, which implies he's been without a significant source of food for a long time, and therefore that Kreia has been gone for an extended duration.  Some of Kreia's dialogue also supports the assertion that a significant amount of time passed between her defeat and the finding of the Exile. For one, she was cut off from the Force when she was cast down in the Trayus, but has recovered her connection fully by the time she arrives at Peragus, and all visual evidence that she was ever Sith has also dissipated. Her returned connection to the Force, at least, implies that enough time had passed that whatever trauma Sion/Nihilus inflicted on her had dissipated enough for her to feel the Force again. And don't doubt that whatever they did to her was traumatic; even if Sion didn't rape her, there's a cut dialogue between Sion and Nihilus that TSLRCM doesn't restore (for what reason I'm not sure) where Sion tells Nihilus that Kreia is alive, and that he [Nihilus] didn't kill her as he had intended. So whatever they did to her was extreme, and she would have had to lie very low to make sure neither of them had noticed she was alive.  Moreover, she also had to have tracked down the Ebon Hawk and T3-M4 in this time, and to have gained the droid's trust. She clearly doesn't like T3, nor does she understand his beeps and whistles, but her mission and his were the same and she had to have convinced him to allow her to tag along at some point. T3 being the cautious and elusive droid that he is, it's likely that it took her quite a bit of time to find the Hawk in the first place.  And finally, just the way Kreia talks about it. ""I was cast out. Stripped of my power. Exiled."" She and the Exile share a lot in common: they were both ""betrayed"" by their own, they were both cut off from the Force, and they were both exiled. The Exile wandered, and Kreia claims that she saw the true nature of the Force only after she had lost it, which implies that she had some sort of revelatory experience in her wanderings following her exile. I think that she, like the Exile, did literally wander for a while after Malachor in order to come to terms with everything."
kotor,3c78e5,Snigaroo,7,Sun Jul 5 18:08:13 2015 UTC,I was also curious about the implication that Revan put Jedi he couldn't control on Malachor to wipe them out.  I was under the impression he embraced the Dark Side after wandering into the Unknown Regions post-Malachor.
kotor,3c78e5,veryalias,8,Sun Jul 5 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"KOTOR 1 canon, as well as TOR canon. Check out this segment of HK dialogue from KOTOR 2. The entire video is important, but the truly critical part begins at 3:40.  Malachor was an intentional move by Revan to mass-convert his armies--including the Jedi within them--to his cause by using the wanton slaughter to create an echo in the Force. This echo would kill those who could not turn away from it by deafening them to the Force, and those who did turn away from it would be ignoring the deaths of tens of thousands; this was incompatible with Jedi teachings, and so by turning away they would become loyal only to Revan.  Because the Mass Shadow Generator was used to accomplish this and the MSG caused incredible tectonic upheaval on the surface, anyone assigned there was essentially sent as a death sentence. So Revan sent those who were a threat to him or who did not fully support him there, according to HK."

It feels like there was no real catalyst for her to go from grey to dark again when she abandons the exile, except maybe disappointment at finally understanding him/her. I feel like she must have been planning the Trayus confrontation from the beginning. That begs the question - did she really become grey again, or was it an illusion? Mical sees through her briefly in TSLCRM, I think.  Or did she never stop being grey? The Trayus confrontation seems perfectly in line with her philosophies throughout the game. Even using Nihilus to wipe out the jedi on Katarr is similar, in a way.  Tempted to open the game again, use force sight, and see if she's gone from white to red in the Trayus Core. From memory in the TSLRCM Visas finally sees her as red at the Enclave, but I don't know if there's any lore basis for that.  Sorry this whole question is phrased really badly. So far we seem to have three phases of Kreia: Sith Triumvirate, Grey (Exile's Mentor), Trayus. Did her philosophy actually change at any point? Everything she did in all three phases still seems to fit together nicely. Or did she go from wanting supremacy to wanting an end to the force as she travelled in her exile?  Thanks in advance for any help - I have a lot of trouble keeping her straight in my head!"
kotor,3c78e5,-Arkennon,3,Mon Jul 6 09:04:49 2015 UTC,"It's a difficult concept, and I've asked myself the same question a couple times in the past. I call her a Grey during the events of K2 mostly because she physically appears Grey. Kreia isn't really clear about why she differentiates herself from this appearance at the end of the game, and since she doesn't have a visible alignment when traveling with the Exile we can only assume she's really a Grey or she'd be suppressing her Dark Side alignment somehow.  Grey is her alignment, though, not her ideology. The way I see it, Kreia doesn't really care about alignment, and she never really did after she was exiled. Prior to that she was truly a Sith in terms of ideology, and believed that alignment and allegiance was critical. After, though, she began to hate the Sith as much as she hated the Jedi and the Force itself, and it came down to purpose alone. When she traveled with the Exile she did so as a Grey, but behaved as a Sith when necessary (reviving Hanharr, Tobin, wiping Mical's mind, etc.). In other words, she did not let her ideology affect her alignment with the Force.  So why did she change back to being an overt Sith? I believe it was very much intentional, part of the plan that you point out she always had. I see KOTOR 2 as a giant challenge for the Exile fabricated by Kreia, something meant to test her against everything in the galaxy that could be brought to bear against her. If the Exile failed, then the galaxy would either be destroyed by Nihilus or by Kreia ending the Force; if the Exile succeeded, Kreia would have trained one as great as Revan and would be able to send her former pupil help in the Unknown Regions. Everything was planned out so that, no matter the eventuality, Kreia would win in some way.  To finalize this plan, however, Kreia had to force the Exile to face both Nihilus and Sion, the two forces in the galaxy which Kreia could not kill. Forcing the Exile to face Nihilus was easy, and she only needed Tobin. But Sion? For Sion, she needed to convince him that she had returned, just the same as before, and that she was in control again. Sion felt very deeply for the Exile, and without Kreia twisting his mind it's possible he would have refused to fight her.  You'll note that Kreia does not appear as Traya when she meets Atris, because that would have been counter-productive. Atris had fallen, but she was still fighting the admission that she was a Sith; if you speak with her at length, she will claim that the titles of Jedi and Sith mean nothing as they are now, and that the new Jedi Order should be a fusion of both ideologies. She's still trying to do mental gymnastics and think of herself as a Jedi; if Kreia had appeared to her as a Sith, Atris would have been terribly put off, to say the least. And so, as I see it, Kreia only re-dons the alignment of the Sith in order to control Sion and force him to fight the Exile.  As for why she appears red in the Enclave (because she does), I think that comes down to brief flashes of intent. Kreia knew she was going to kill those Jedi Masters, because that had been part of her plan all along: let the Exile gather them so she could take her revenge. Visas saw Kreia as she was walking around with an intent to murder, and so saw intent through her neutral alignment."

Maybe she had my favorite dialogues.  One of my main issues with KOTOR 2 was the way dialogues with your companions tended to be spaced out. You might have several conversations with one of them in a small span of time, but after that you could go hours and entire planets without getting any new dialogue options with them. It was awkward, and stifled the momentum that built up during conversations. I think the only one that this was circumvented with was Kreia, who seemed to always have something new to say after a planet, which is probably why people like her so much."

By following Xuul's method, the fullscreen bug can be mitigated while also providing increased widescreen options. Be warned, however, that this is a time-intensive process; one stage of this fix requires at least several hours of processing even on excellent PCs, although this process can be done without any user input (overnight is a good idea).  It should also be noted that the below method is only a partial fix, not a complete one.

It can happen to one game and not to another on the same PC, and if the bug is present it's also been known to cause general game instability. You might not have it on either KOTOR 1 or 2, or you might have it on both. Since you're presumably playing for the first time, however, I recommend following the instructions below.

Be warned, however, that this is a time-intensive process; one stage of this fix requires at least several hours of processing even on excellent PCs, although this process can be done without any user input (overnight is a good idea).  It should also be restated that this isn't a complete fix.

Masters: TSLRCM  __  Name: Visas Voiceover Tweak  Description: Replaces lower-quality in-game dialogue in the initial Ravager scene between Nihilus and Visas with versions from one of the game's pre-rendered cutscenes.  Masters: TSLRCM  __  Name: Sion's Arrival at Peragus  Description: Fixes Sion's low-quality intro cutscene by replacing it with an in-game version.  __  Name: Handmaiden for Females, Disciple for Males  Description: In the same vein as the Mira/Hanharr mod, this mod lets you choose between Handmaiden or Disciple regardless of gender.

Special Installation Instructions: When installing with TSLPatcher, do NOT use the version for High Level Force Powers; if you were planning on using HLFP, either remove HLFP (recommended) or DO NOT USE Improved AI. There is a compatibility issue when using HLFP and Improved AI together in this build.    Playing Widescreen  If you've ever had the fullscreen bug (game crashing when playing cutscenes + general instability), or if you just want support for widescreen resolutions above 1280x1024, it's highly recommended that you follow the instructions presented in the following videos. By following Xuul's method, the fullscreen bug can be mitigated while also providing increased widescreen options. Be warned, however, that this is a time-intensive process; one stage of this fix requires at least several hours of processing even on excellent PCs, although this process can be done without any user input (overnight is a good idea).  It should also be noted that the below method is only a partial fix, not a complete one. Your game may still crash sometimes when cutscenes play back-to-back, and you may still have startup trouble on occasion. Nevertheless, the widescreen patches will mitigate the effects of the fullscreen bug significantly.  KOTOR 2 Widescreen Patch  KOTOR 2 Movies Hack"

There is a compatibility issue when using HLFP and Improved AI together in this build.    Playing Widescreen  KOTOR 1 and 2 both share a bug which causes the game to crash when two movie cutscenes are played back-to-back while the game is in fullscreen mode; this bug is called the fullscreen bug. It can happen to one game and not to another on the same PC, and if the bug is present it's also been known to cause general game instability. You might not have it on either KOTOR 1 or 2, or you might have it on both. Since you're presumably playing for the first time, however, I recommend following the instructions below.  While there is no complete fix for the bug, it can be partially circumvented. By following Xuul's method as shown in the videos below, the fullscreen bug can be mitigated while simultaneously unlocking new widescreen options for the player. Be warned, however, that this is a time-intensive process; one stage of this fix requires at least several hours of processing even on excellent PCs, although this process can be done without any user input (overnight is a good idea).  It should also be restated that this isn't a complete fix. Your game still may crash when cutscenes are played back-to-back, though it will do so much less frequently, and you may still have some issues on startup on occasion. Nevertheless, your experience will be infinitely better using these mods.  KOTOR 2 Widescreen Patch  KOTOR 2 Movies Hack"

kotor,3c471m,frankieh,19,Sat Jul 4 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"It's the total opposite for me now; I can play TSL even after beating it two dozen times, but I couldn't even get past Dantooine in KOTOR when I tried to play it the other day.  The long and short of it is that they're two very different games. KOTOR 2 is lonely and depressing, a stark contrast to the kind of epic that the original tried to be. It leaves you feeling isolated and frankly uncomfortable, and if you're not ready for that kind of storytelling you're likely to be put off. But if you're prepared and willing to listen to a totally new take on Jedi and the Force, K2 has an incredibly compelling plot.  The only thing I can recommend aside from being open-minded is using TSLRCM, if you're not already. It fixes a bunch of bugs and adds in a lot of restored content that helps make KOTOR 2 more coherent, so you have to work less to see what the plot is trying to do. It doesn't change the tone of the game, but it makes it easier to understand."

They need to drop the enemies' average health to 1/3 of the current levels to make it reasonable -- as it is now, you can either run through the level as fast as possible while ignoring enemies, turn on god mode, or spent hours grinding through enemies that have ridiculous amounts of health.

kotor,3c471m,PM_ME_LEGAL_PAPERS,3,Wed Jul 8 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"The problem with KotOR 1 is that once you've played it through once (or maybe twice, LS and then DS), it just honestly doesn't have that much left to offer. I still love the first game, but it doesn't really offer a lot in the way of depth or subtlety. Try to play through the game as a neutral, or morally complex character, and it just... doesn't work.  I still love the first game for what it was, but you won't get anything new out of the game after your second playthrough. It doesn't offer you a lot of alternative paths, either in gameplay or in story. On the other hand, I almost always get something new out of TSL anytime I play it, just because there's so much there to begin with.  Plus, KotOR's big mid-game revelation (which the entire story hangs on) doesn't have the same impact once you've heard it a couple times. Once the surprise of the big ""twist"" is gone, the overall story doesn't have much weight to it, since it all hangs on that revelation. On the other hand, the rebuilt enclave scene in TSL still gives me goosebumps, because of what that scene means."

kotor,3bu21s,Snigaroo,3,Thu Jul 2 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, well that's different. Still, many mods don't just include changes in the override folder, many make other changes. TSLRCM modifies movies and modules, which is probably where the issue is; the game is probably trying to load a TSLRCM module with other non-TSLRCM files. Also, the override folder contains files which were modified by official Obsidian patches, which means you're essentially running the vanilla game without any updates.  If you try turning the override on now and running it when you've spent most of the game running without it, you're almost certain to crash. If you don't turn it back on, you're fucked because you're loading TSLRCM modules without TSLRCM files. So honestly I think you're just fucked."

Even if that weren't the case, nobody has yet finished even a full texture rework for either game.

kotor,3bnz05,Jackson3125,12,Tue Jun 30 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"Only idiots think Sentinel is a bad choice. There's almost no argument that it's the best all-around, especially because a lot of KOTOR 2's content is locked behind skill walls, unlike in KOTOR 1.  That said, I wouldn't build the way you did. Intelligence is highly important for a Sentinel build, because the Sentinel's strength lies in his skills. I would do 14 INT as a minimum. Also, I would try going above 14 in any but your main stat, as it costs additional points to level that high. It's best to spend points to get your stats higher through normal level-up progression.  I would recommend your stats look something like:  STR: 10  DEX: 16  CON: 14  INT: 14  WIS: 12  CHA: 10  Putting Charisma that high is an arguable decision (you could do it as low as 8), but having it at 10 makes using opposite-side force powers a bit more tolerable, and also helps with using persuade checks (which are pretty important in K2). Wisdom at 12 is sufficient for the early game because you won't have that many offensive force powers, and you can push it up to 14 in time for it to be useful via normal level-up stat bonuses. Because CON is more important than WIS in the early game, that's why I suggest CON start at 14 in place of WIS.  Also, play with the Restored Content Mod if you aren't already. It is an absolutely mandatory mod."

Kreia explains that Revan didn't fall to the dark side, but used it as a tool of conversion for his own empire, and GO-TO says he suspects that Revan did not create his own Sith empire to just conquer and rule over the ashes, but wanted to strengthen the galaxy, quite possibly against the true Sith empire, which makes sense if you consider that Revan went to fight them again when he regained his memories from his time as Darth Revan.

Bastila, for instance, is in hiding, as well as one of the minor characters from KotOR I whose name I can't remember. They could easily rebuild the order, but it would take some time.  However, the Dark Side Ending has Malachor V remain intact, leaving the echo between it and the Exile to grow until finally the Force can no longer be detected and manipulated by Jedi and Sith alike. So whether or not the Sith could even attempt to invade depends on how much they relied on the Force as opposed to interstellar technology. If they had a fleet, they could almost certainly attempt an invasion; however, I doubt that a massive and quite literal ""empire"" is what Chris Avellone intended for the True Sith to be.

But the universe doesn't really end, we just have bad people in charge.  2) the Republic gets bored after rebulding Telos (if Citadel Station was destroyed by a Dark Side Exile, then there is no Republic anymore and this scenario is moot) and decides to reform the Jedi Order to use as a secret police. They institute force sensitive testing and take young force sensitives away from their family. Eventually, the order of secret police Jedi becomes corrupt due to the crimes they commit and the lack of a code and takes over the Republic using their superior powers. In other words, the Republic makes the Sith. But some of the Jedi would see that what they are doing is wrong, and lead the way to the real Jedi Order.  3) Archaeologists like the Disciple dig through Jedi Ruins and archive knowledge. The main characters of future Star Wars games learn they are force sensitive, go to the library and the Jedi Order is resurrected in a very casual way. They end up learning about the force just in time to save everyone from scenario 1.  4) The dark side Jedi Exile ends the force as we know it, through the power of being a Malachor V black hole cipher thingy, and there can't be any Sith or Jedi anymore."
kotor,3b4nf2,TriskOuro,2,Sat Jun 27 05:40:31 2015 UTC,too bad the dark side endings are never canon
kotor,3b4nf2,TriskOuro,2,Fri Jun 26 18:10:09 2015 UTC,At least KotOR 2 had some different dialogue depending on whether you said Revan chose a LS or DS ending.
kotor,3b4nf2,veryalias,2,Sat Jun 27 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"They did, but it wasn't really right. If Revan was DS, he would have conquered the Republic with Bastila using the Infinite Fleet. But that doesn't happen."
kotor,3b4nf2,TriskOuro,2,Sat Jun 27 05:46:05 2015 UTC,"I believe they explain that this doesn't happen because Revan leaves for the unknown regions before he has a chance to do this.  Without his leadership, the remaining Sith turned on one another, resulting in the scattered factions you see in TSL, but not before wiping out most of the Jedi.  I presume the Star Forge was lost or destroyed in the chaos.  In fact, a canonical DS KotOR ending makes more sense to me given the state of the Jedi Order in TSL."
kotor,3b4nf2,veryalias,24,Sat Jun 27 13:39:06 2015 UTC,"I've said it before... my dream isn't necessarily for them to make KOTOR 3 but that'd be awesome if they did.  My dream is for them to make a brand new Star Wars RPG that plays virtually identical albeit with modern graphics and enhancements.  It'd be called Tales of the Jedi as a throwback to KOTOR (Knights of the Old Republic being a story arc in the Tales of the Jedi comic series) but also allows them to visit any time period they wish. Old Republic era, new Jedi during the Dark Times like Rebels, post-ROTJ, not long before the Prequels, whenever.  It doesn't lock them into a specific time period because the title is vague enough to be set whenever.  My only issue is that Bioware games' quality has gone down significantly. They're not poorly made but the decisions they've made haven't been good. Compare the simple, cookie cutter fetch side quests of Dragon Age Inquisition to the interesting, compelling, and intricate side quests of the KOTOR games. In KOTOR, you were even able to make decisions about the reward: accept it, persuade for a bigger reward, threaten for a bigger reward, insist they keep the reward, swap the reward, etc.  At each step along the way of a quest, you had choices and different ways to complete the quests. Plus there was a wide range of quests and the ways they were presented meant that even simple fetch quests felt like more, because they were. Think about it: murder mystery on Dantooine, bounty hunting on different planets, a murder trial on Manaan, a woman trying to sell a desert wraid plate but can't because she doesn't have a hunting license on Tatooine, swoop racing on different planets, the arena on Taris, the promised land on Taris, a Romeo and Juliet inspired quest on Dantooine (with a plethora of different outcomes based on how you finish the quest), and so on. Even outside of actual quests you had decisions and choices you could make -- whenever you need to pay a landing fee, you could pay up, persuade, Force persuade, or even threaten people.  In Dragon Age Inquisition on the other hand... virtually every single side quest, aside from the personal side quests from those in your party, played out the same: kill x amount of y and return for reward, collect x amount of y and return for reward. You had no say, no agency in what the reward was, how to finish the quest, etc. You just did it to get xp and finish the game.   I would rather not have a sequel or even spiritual successor if it means a bastardized version of the amazing systems of the first two. Even KOTOR 2 which was incomplete at least had the same, basic system of how quests and everything else worked. Because of that, playing KOTOR 2 with the restoration mods is amazing.  I'd much rather someone use the modding tools that Bethesda provides for Fallout 4 to craft a fan sequel/spiritual successor. Our ""home"" is the Ebon Hawk or some other ship. We get party members and can bring up to 3 with us. Make the dialogue choices and things work like KOTOR, make the karma system affect our appearance and work more like Light/Dark side than the typical FO karma system, and so on. It wouldn't be easy by a longshot. There'd be a lot to change to make everything feel like KOTOR. The only difference is that combat would be real time or use VATS and I'm not sure how possible it'd be to have the ability to switch characters /:  But the benefits would be that even though it's Fallout which is open world,  the mod could be smaller and have more intimate and intricate side quests (though FO and TES quests feel deeper than what was available I'm DAI), crafting would really allow us to customize the look and power of our lightsabers and blasters, etc.  As long as whoever makes the mod understood how KOTOR quests were set up, the mod would have a significant issue resolved. The quest set up really is the most crucial element I think and that's why DAI falls flat. Maybe the first DA game was more like KOTOR in regards to its quests."
kotor,3b4nf2,thehypotheticalnerd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"The first Dragon Age (probably the second as well, though I haven't played it) indeed was much better with quests. I'd actually say you may be (unintentionally) cherry picking the worst Bioware game for side quests. All of the mass effect games were also exceptional in this regard.  Honestly, compared to modern games I even think KOTOR is lacking with its side quests, great for the time but no longer amazing now.  I'll expand on this hopefully later (at work), but I still have faith in Bioware to do KOTOR justice."
kotor,3b4nf2,Apprentice57,10,Fri Jun 26 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"I want to see a KOTOR with a path progression like The Witcher 3. I played all the way through that game (took about 100 hours for my first playthrough) and I only got one ending. There are 36 different ending in The Witcher 3, and anything you do throughout the world will adjust other quests as you go on, including the main storyline.  Can you imagine a Star Wars game with that kind of non-linear storytelling? Bioware can do that kind of storytelling, but would anyone allow them to at this point?"
kotor,3b4nf2,halcyoncmdr,3,Fri Jun 26 00:17:12 2015 UTC,"The cool thing is that there could be a set of possible endings based on your decisions, right? But your alignment would alter the basic ending to reflect your karmic balance: light side or dark side. So the way in which your character and those they've influenced will actually result in that base ending changing based on being good or evil."
kotor,3b4nf2,thehypotheticalnerd,4,Fri Jun 26 00:22:36 2015 UTC,"If there's any team that could accomplish this with respect to the Star Wars (and KOTOR) legacy, it's Bioware."
kotor,3b4nf2,halcyoncmdr,7,Fri Jun 26 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Or Obsidian. If they're given enough time. They had amazing ideas for KOTOR 2 but just weren't given the time. They also made New Vegas which plays like an even better Fallout 3 and had deeper companions, more choices that alter the plot, etc. But the core gameplay was the same as FO3. I think they could also pull off a great KOTOR sequel/spiritual successor if they're actually given the time they need."
kotor,3b4nf2,thehypotheticalnerd,2,Fri Jun 26 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"I was going to say Obsidian, because I do enjoy their work immensely; but I don't feel they accomplish story at the same level as Bioware for instance. They have everything else down perfectly, but the story usually seems to be lacking a bit. Maybe it's just because I'm comparing KOTOR 2 vs KOTOR 1, and FO:NV vs FO3. Alpha Protocol I enjoyed but again the story just wasn't quite what I expected out of the game for instance.  It may be down to time, or that may just be one part of it."
kotor,3b4nf2,halcyoncmdr,2,Fri Jun 26 01:42:40 2015 UTC,"It is funny that you say that, because while playing through The Witcher 3 (not quite done yet) I found the structure of its open world to be much more similar to KOTOR 1/2 than games like Skyrim or Fallout.  Witcher 3 is divided into three regions that you have to explore to find traces of Ciri, kinda like the 4 planets you have to explore in each KOTOR to find the answers you're looking for.  In either game, to achieve your main quest in that region/planet, you have to do these other objectives and you also have the option of pursuing side quests.  Granted, this obsvervation isn't really relevant and this is pretty much as far as the comparison goes between the two games.    But also, can you imagine a Star Wars RPG with that kind of combat? Replace that steal and silver sword with a lightsaber / option to go duel and I'd be all set."
kotor,3b4nf2,enigmas343,4,Mon Jun 29 02:27:40 2015 UTC,"I love the KOTOR series, but I'm with you, the powers that be probably wouldn't want to step on SW:TOR's toes. But it doesn't really matter about the time period the RPG is set, I really just want a stellar (heh) Star Wars RPG."
kotor,3b4nf2,Ragefield,3,Fri Jun 26 00:13:48 2015 UTC,"While SWTOR wraps up Revan's involvment in the story, I don't believe it wraps up the fallout from his and the Exiles stories.  I would really like to see a KOTOR 3 deal with rebuilding the Jedi Order and Republic while another power tries to move in.  Maybe the Mandalorians who didn't take too kindly to Canderous and maybe a cameo from Bastila or one of her children.  But to be clear, despite how some people dislike Revan's story, I do not want them to change it.  Even in SWTOR he is powerful in his own unique ways.  I'd also be fine with a SWRPG that doesn't deal with that particular era any longer.  Distant future or any time between SWTOR and The prequels, hell maybe a SWRPG that takes place during the prequels so they can take advantage of the war, as long as it's a new and well told story."
kotor,3b4nf2,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,3,Fri Jun 26 09:46:13 2015 UTC,"Amazing I've not put too much thought into what I want. I think that more customisation options would be a lot of fun, and perhaps space travel similar to Mass Effect's. But apart from that I just wanna go in blind, like I did with 1 & 2.   Tattooine would need to make another appearance, perhaps with Dantooine after it's become more established after Malak's bombing. It would also be interesting if people spoke about the Jedi Civil War in the way that people irl talk about WW2: they rever the event, but it's a part of history. I only say that because in the first 2 games it was fresh in everyone's minds, but it would interesting to hear all these references or rumours to things that we experienced (e.g. ""I heard Revan travelled with a Wookie that was 10' tall!""), or hear exaggerations of the exploits of the first 2 crews. I just think it'd be fun.  I'm on the fence about the combat. On the one hand, it was really a huge part of the charm of the first game, but I don't know how well it would hold up compared to a lot of modern day RPGs. I would be happy if they changed it as long as they put thought into it and didn't just make it a hack n slash.  In terms of a story, I would feel more comfortable just jumping into whatever the developer comes up with. The first 2 had stories that were better than anything I can think up."

I really wish they made a kotor 3 with a combat system like dragon age: orgins, that would be my dream.  And no mmo stuff.  I want it to be focused on an awesome story, rather than a social world, where everyone is the main character."
kotor,3b4nf2,thesoulsalesman,2,Fri Jun 26 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"My ideal KOTOR 3 would wipe out the canon of SWTOR. It would be set 10-20 years after KOTOR 2 (light side ending canon, as per tradition). The Jedi Exile would have started a Jedi academy and begun the process of rebuilding the order, with the companions from KOTOR 2 being the new teachers of the Jedi order - Handmaiden, Bao-Dur, Atton, Visas, Mira.   You would play as a student of the new order. I haven't given a ton of thought to how the plot would go, but it would basically start off like this: Bao-Dur is overseeing the construction of a new branch of the Jedi Temple on Telos. You and several other students are being sent there, but your ship is mysteriously pulled out of hyperspace over an unknown planet and crash-lands on its surface.   Long story short, this planet is inhabited by the True Sith, and this is some of the first contact anyone has had with them in centuries. After doing combat with some Sith slaves and exploring the area, one of the Jedi initiates - who happens to have a knack for technology - manages to repair the minor damage that has been done to the ship.   You take off and head back home, and upon hearing your story the Exile decides to launch an expedition into these unknown regions and find out more about the True Sith, naming you as a part of the team.  I haven't given it much thought after that, since fantasizing about KOTOR 3 is essentially futile at this point, but that's the basic outline of the ideas I've had for it."
kotor,3b4nf2,whitefang999,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:02:37 2015 UTC,"I think there's going to be a lot of room for new games in the Episodes 7-9 time range. Probably after Ep. 9, to avoid mucking with the main plot line. I think SWTOR pretty much squashed any chance of a KOTOR 3 in the same story arc. But I'd be more than happy with a game that felt the same in a new story arc. Create an awesome Force user - attend Luke's Academy, visit planets shown to us in or changed by the new trilogy, become the biggest baddest/best Force user around. Similar gameplay, similar quality of story/side quest, but in a brand new era."
kotor,3b4nf2,TheMysteriousStrangr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"While I do bear a significant amount of nostalgia for the KotOR series, particularly the first one, I think it will be some time before there is enough financial incentive for EA/Disney/whoever to remake and/or continue the saga. From a speculative but entirely logical point of view, I'd say there is more of a chance for the KotOR series to be remade and continued than there isn't.  Consider that Star Wars isn't going away anytime soon. It is arguably the most well known of a handful of sagas that has not only withstood the test of time, but retains a large fanbase from four generations and continues to exponentially garner fans all over the world. 'Casual' and otherwise. With Disney now at the helm, that is unlikely to change within the foreseeable future.  KotOR was released in 2003 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, so much so that a near-instant (albeit flawed) sequel was warranted. Don't forget the prequel trilogy was in full steam around this time, further amassing attention to ""Star Wars"" media and lore. The point here is that anything with ""Star Wars"" and a decent marketing budget attached to it will sell, and sell well. With the new trilogy slated to be released over the next few years, the idea that interest in the saga will decrease is an unlikely one.  Though the older fans may have lost interest or simply denounced the new trilogy, it does not mean the 13-21 demographic doesn't exist anymore. In fact this can be said about most any remake or sequel that doesn't appease original fans, seeing as that has become a trend lately. But I digress, that conversation is for a different day.  It's 2015, all games and movies are a sequel/prequel/spin-off of an original IP. Doubtful? Take a look around, you may be unpleasantly surprised.  Many have said on here that the KotOR community is much smaller than we think (hope) it is. While this is true to an extent, it's reasonable to assume many, if not a majority, of KotOR fans are simply googling 'Kotor 3' and researching the topic. It's not unlikely to assume these same individuals contribute nothing to the 'community' but rather seek bits of information instead. There are undoubtedly those who have played the game and will never inquire past only the game. I never share my opinion on the internet, not only because it is often a practice in futility but because I don't care to go through the process of setting up an account (Reddit, to my delight, allows you to surpass this). This mentality is shared widely. There is a psychological term for this, but it escapes me at the moment. The point is, the KotOR name likely resonates with far more people than the 7k-odd subscribed fans.  Although, taking into account the potential 'new' fans in contrast to the original fans, we are likely the smaller group.  Star Wars isn't going away. The new trilogy could very well usher in another Star Wars renassiance, just as it did in the mid-80s, late-90s and early 00s. Disney wouldn't have bought the rights if there wasn't sufficient reason to do so. Seeing as remakes and sequels are more prominent than original IPs, I wouldn't expect KotOR to be left out of the mix when SW-branded games start gaining traction again. It's just going to be some time, likely around the release of Episode 7 in 2017, when SW media is regularly flowing across the screens of casual fans again, accumulating interest and establishing the necessary financial incentive.  On a personal note:  I played the original KotOR when I was 11 (2004), and just recently got back into it with the android release. I almost forgot how much I loved this game, and was amazed at the formidable community that is still active to this day. All of you are awesome, and have strengthened my already solid belief that the KotOR saga will be reborn. Revan (arguably one of the best SW characters ever) Bastila and Meetra also deserve a better end than they were given, in the books and TOR, IMO."

TSL really got me interested in that part of the timeline, with the whole gray area and politics and war and stuff, and it breathed a lot of life to the tales that Canderous/Mandalore told you of his days on the battlefield in the first game.    I haven't thought to extensively on what the player character's role would be like or what the arc of such a game's story would be but I think it would be interesting for a variety of reasons, not the list of which is the controversial history that prequels have in the Star Wars franchise as a whole.  It would definitely be an unanticipated spin.  Maybe a Jedi in the Order that has to make the decision to follow or not follow Revan and Malak to war?  It has to be somebody who has a deceptively large impact on the Galaxy and who has reason to be absent from the first two games.    Of course, the problem with this, is you might get something like The Force Unleashed with some rando who is cool but also kind of shoehorned in there with a cast of really interesting, but not convincing characters at that time and place in Star Wars History.  I just really want to learn more about the Mandalorian Wars, and I think KOTOR 3 would be a great way to do that.  Maybe the game could go even past the end of the war, enough to bear witness to Malak and Revans fall.  Are you trusted enough to venture into deep space with theme? How does your light/dark side alignment effect this? A lot of potentially interesting dynamics, just would have to be done gracefully."

You become involved in some conflict and you're recruited into the Jedi order. There you'd meet bastila and you'd learn the Jedi are struggling to rebuild. The Jedi would discover they're faced by some huge menace and you're crucial in stopping it. This menace could be some weapon or a secret that revan built, something bastila could sense and had worked years outside the order to defeat. now you have to work with her to destroy it, thus starting your adventure. Eventually you'd learn that bastila had - again - concealed something from the beginning and that your character is something more than you thought.

kotor,3b0e10,roarkous,3,Wed Jun 24 23:47:12 2015 UTC,Kotor 1 had war going on and thus feels alive and active. Kotor 2 is quite dark because everything is in shambles. The calm before the storm. I love too love the atmosphere of both games. Sometime gives me chills on kotor 2.
kotor,3b0e10,AlphaLupi,30,Wed Jul 1 04:30:51 2015 UTC,"There's so many examples of this ""feel"" throughout the game, but one that stands out for me is when you're leaving Peragus in the Ebon Hawk.  Hell, Peragus is itself one big exercise in atmosphere and mood, but I always liked the short sequence after you leave... when you've just barely escaped the Harbinger and Sion, and you're flying off in the Ebon Hawk towards Telos. Even after the huge explosion you just got away from, the game is still so dark and moody. It's just you and Atton and Kreia (and T3) in the ship, and it's just so... quiet. You can have a long discussion with Kreia, or banter with Atton, but the whole atmosphere is somber.  But yea, really, you could talk about atmosphere and mood throughout the entire game. The only part in KotOR 1 that really achieves that kind of atmosphere for me is right after you crash on Taris and you're with Carth in the apartment."

I reloaded to my previous save, right before leaving Manaan and triggering the Leviathan cutscene and left the ship with him in my party and every time i talk to him he just says ""They're waiting for you up ahead""...

Minor spoiler- you will have to use him a few times near the end of the game, so I would keep him properly equipped."

kotor,3atmsl,MichaelJ_Caboose,4,Tue Jun 23 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"You are correct that Halo has some very fleshed out charecters and I will agree that it to is a video game that should be remembered as one of the best. But that is just it, it should be remembered. Instead of ending it at Halo 3 with mystery over Master Chief and the beginning of human relations with aliens, they took it and ran it over with cheap plot line and action to make more money. It almost feels like taking a road trip to the Grand Canyon and right before seeing the canyon with excitement building up turning around and heading to Reno to enjoy the flashy lights. Perhaps I am too conservative in my video game enjoyment but there was a feeling behind Halo 1-3 but not after."
kotor,3atmsl,bluearch3r,4,Tue Jun 23 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know quite where you were going with that analogy, but I agree. Halo 1-3 had a feel to them that is hard to beat. I keep playing because I like the story anyway."
kotor,3atmsl,MichaelJ_Caboose,4,Tue Jun 23 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"I accept the analogy could be hard to follow, what I was trying to say was that Halo 1-3 builds up continually to the ending and then sort of just regresses. It goes from powerful meaning and irony of the single most heroic figure in the Halo universe saving the galaxy but not enjoying the fruits of his labor, of making the ultimate sacrifice to ensure others safety only to be left alone for the rest of his life, down to more video game machinations with flashy lights. That is what I meant. They built up a great story only to destroy the legacy it could have had due to consumer demand."

Sith Assassins with Lightsabers can make the Harbinger a bit more difficult, and it gives all Sith Assassins that you encounter after the fact lightsabers as well, so far as I'm aware. There aren't many you encounter after that didn't already have lightsabers, but it at least makes the Harbinger pretty damn difficult.  Improved AI makes enemies that are tougher a lot stronger (think boss-level enemies like the Jedi Masters, Hanharr or Mira, Sion or Nihilus, etc), but it also boosts the intelligence of your party's AI, which will usually make them much better compared to normal enemies. It really is pretty good for bosses, though. They're still usually pretty easy even with mediocre builds, but they're not the total pushovers they have the chance to be without it."

kotor,3afbew,BioStef_,7,Sat Jun 20 05:47:02 2015 UTC,"A third installment in the Knights of the Old Republic series is highly unlikely, and here's why:  1) Canon: Knights of the Old Republic is not considered Canon by the LucasFilm Story Group; it is part of the Legends universe. At this time, LucasFilm is not focusing on continuing Legends works, but rather on growing Canon works. A possible work around for this would be to ""simply"" make the entire Knights of the Old Republic series canon, but it's not that simple, as the Legends and Canon versions of Star Wars differ greatly. For example, if they were to make KotOR canon, they would need to remove Ajunta Pall's force spirit from Korriban; because in Canon, Sith can't become Force Spirits. Another example would be lightsabers. From everything we know about the Old Republic in Canon, the lightsaber blade had more of a bladed look to it instead of the cylinder-shape we know and love: see Darksaber and the statues on Ilum in The Clone Wars. The problem with changing this is that whomever made these ""remastered"" canon versions of Knights of the Old Republic would then get a lot of flak for ""ruining a perfect game"", even though the changes would be necessary for the series to exist in Canon.  Here's the thing about Legends, though. Bioware has been given the go-ahead to continue with their Legends works. So, technically speaking, they could make a Star Wars Legends: Knights of the Old Republic III, but they won't, and here's my reason why:  2) Star Wars the Old Republic: Bioware considers their MMO, Star Wars: The Old Republic, to be 8 Knights of the Old Republic games in one. Unless that game closes, Bioware will never make another Knights of the Old Republic game. That game is not closing any time soon, what with a recent cinematic trailer (meaning lots of money is being devoted into marketing, something that hasn't been done since release, meaning EA actually cares about it again) and a new large expansion on the horizon.  So, in my opinion, I don't think we'll see Knights of the Old Republic III for a long time, if ever."

Because as far as I recall everything you mentioned cannot be called canon if you only count episode 1-6 (But I haven't watched the animated stuff so I can't comment about that)  Force spirits are only shown twice, but it's not stated that Sith cannot do this  How a lightsaber blade looks is completely irrelevant, we have not have anyone state that they have to be in any specific way and the trailer for the new movie seems to support that you can do it in different ways considering the lightsaber looks like a cross and the beam seems ""unstable""  I don't think Kotor 3 will come anytime soon either, but if it does I'm assuming it will be completely separate from 1 & 2"

kotor,3a1yuv,A_bacon2012,3,Tue Jun 16 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"What game?   KotOR 1 or 2?   In any case, if you're planning on using yourself as an auxiliary unit I'd suggest stacking up on dexterity.   Strength is pretty much useless in the second game because lightsaber finesse is a thing you can do. While that's not something you can get in the first one, it's still a ridiculously good build to run.   Grab Scoundrel/Sentinel (KotOR 1), and you're immune to stuns, fears, and slows. Make sure you spec into disengage force powers such as force wave/force stun, and just run around smashing kids with master flurry while they're all stunned.   The second one can be done the exact same way, except instead it's sentinel/watchman. You're immuned to everything, with the added bonus of being able to use your massive dext as an alternative to strength, meaning you can evade everything, keep everyone constantly stunned with stupid force powers, and do tons of damage.   I don't like soloing the games because I like hearing the companions talk to each other/react to the environment, but there isn't one fight in the game that I couldn't do on my own (after Taris and Telos, respectively)   If this build interests you, I can give you a more description on what to do, but I'm not going to waste my time writing a guide if you already know what I'm talking about.   If it doesn't interest you and you want more of a meaty constitution character, then I'm not too sure.   I did try this once:   Str: 8   Dext: 8  Const: 16  Int: 8   Char: 16  Wis: 16  I never died and I had a lot of health/resistances, but I never evaded anything either. It was pretty fun though."
kotor,3a1yuv,GreatOdin,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"I believe KotOR automatically applied your DEX to your attack roll with lightsabers only if it was higher than your STR.

kotor,3a1yuv,veryalias,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:05:01 2015 UTC,"My dext build is +28/+26 hit chance with 10-44 dmg @ 18 str/28 dex.   My ooooooold str build off my X-box is +24/+22 hit chance with about 16-60 dmg @28 str/16 dex. It's a really shitty build from way back in the day, but it's all I have as a reference.   So I'd say that the damage difference is pretty large, but my dps on the dext character was way higher, as I didn't have to waste turns healing as often. I'd get hit probably 3/10 times, and master force speed + Master critical strike = 4 attacks, each with a chance of stunning the enemy. I usually just did plain attack, because the dps was high enough and I didn't need to always drop my defense by 4 each each time I attacked. I'd do an average of about 20 damage per hit, and I'd almost never miss (until I fought Malak, then I'd miss about 1-2 attacks each time. He's pretty much the exception to this rule, because he's fucking immuned to everything and has an insanely high hit rate. I still brought him down in ~5 turns). It's probably the most difficult build I've ever ran; a single mistake will bring you down because you're just so squishy. Force wave is your best friend in this case.  I wanted to see if I could solo the starforge on hard, and I did it absolutely no problem with this build. It was actually really fun."

kotor,3a1yuv,GreatOdin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:21:32 2015 UTC,"Well I find the difference between DS and LS is that LS is way better for force using jedi, and DS is way better for straight melee combat.   A lot of the end game items for LS give you +5 Wisdom and such, whereas a lot of the dark side items give you strength, or immunity to stuns/fears/critical hits, and the dark side crystals tend to give you more damage.   When you get to the specializations, I'd stay away from the Sith Lord; the full dark side alignment is totally useless. You get 50 force points, whereas with the Sith assassin, you get +3 dext (which is awesome, especially if you do the build I posted up there).    Kreia will constantly shit on you as well, and you'll lose a lot of influence with her if you keep doing things the dark way. Try to keep her out of your party as often as possible. She hates random cruelty more then she does random kindness. When you get into conversations with her on the ship, try to pick the sentences that are right, not necessarily good or dark.

We went a whole console generation with no Star Wars games that were really all that great. A bunch of Lego SW games and Force Unleashed 1 was only alright. It was sort of a mediocre hack n slash game with some excited and some equally frustrating moments. FU2 was a big FU it sounds like. I never bothered playing it but it looked only marginally nicer than the first game and sounds to have a wtf-story.  A whole console generation went by without any real SW games. Battlefront looks great. I loved Battlefront but Battlefront was no KOTOR. Problem is... have you played Dragon Age Inquisition? Oh GOD. What happened to Bioware? So like, the story is alright, the characters are interesting and fun, main quests still involve choices and decisions... but man oh man did the side quests suck shit. They were all fetch quests, go here and collect this, go here and kill that, okay thanks here's some XP. Seriously? What happened to the days of KOTOR where I could persuade the person to give me a better reward threaten them to give me a better eeward, just outright murder the person because I can, tell them to keep the reward because I didn't do it for one, etc. What happened to getting to do the quest in a variety of ways? Every side quest was a mini story unto itself. DAI abandoned this for a bunch of pointless filler. I can't tell you a single side quest apart from the single personal quest for each party member and that's because those were mini stories.  Seriously...in DAI, it's always bullshit like clearing an area or collecting x amount of whatever, returning to the quest giver, getting a pat on the back and being told good job. Wtf. Here's how I break down RPGs by Bioware and Bethesda. Bethesda crafts expansive world's to lose yourself in. You look at something and you're more or less guaranteed to be able to go there. Enter every building, explore. Discover. You don't have much of an impact on story though... you rarely make decisions that truly affect or alter anything going forward. An example of this is that Skyrim's biggest choice, Stormcloaks or Imperials happens near the beginning but once chosen... you progress through a linear path of quests with no real choices. The choice is more in how you tackle quests: stealthy, magic, or warrior.  Bioware games in the other hand aren't about getting lost in a world...it's about changing it. Every quest, big or small, will have different outcomes based on your input. You may not be able to enter every building but every building you can enter will have carefully crafted quests with intricate backstory and plot and in depth dialogue trees with a plethora of options.   DAI on the other hand has massive areas which, if combined, would make the size of a Bethesda style open world map but without ANY of the appeal of getting lost in the world (in a good way) and finding a new area around every corner. DAI on the other hand is soooo boring at times when you're wandering around these vast but sparse landscapes. While Skyrim would have fortresses and towns and farms and a bunch of people, DAI just felt empty.  But it also has nine of the redeeming characteristics of the intricate side quests of KOTOR. So it has none of the wonder of a breathing, lifelike world similar to actual open world RPGs by Bethesda nor any of the magic of well crafted, choice-driven side quests of older Bioware games. Now you may have fun with making choices in the companion quests and the main questline so you  could theoretically just enjoy that. Problem is, they force you to play a bare minimum of side quests periodically to gain power levels in order to access main quests. It's not too hard to raise but still. Blehhhh.  I just want Obsidian to make a spiritual successor to KOTOR that is set whenever but has the same gameplay of KOTOR/KOTOR 2 but with modern visuals. They could make subtle alterations but yeah."

kotor,39tufe,Titand120,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"Well if you're already playing k2 on a mac, I'm assuming you use either wineskin or crossover?  I tried wineskins, but I couldn't get it to work so I paid 60$ ish for crossover and it works nicely.    http://deadlystream.com/forum/topic/3104-guide-kotor-2-fully-functioning-on-mac-with-mods-and-fixes-tslrcm-widescreen-others/  This is what I used as a guideline. I kinda suck at computers and it was my first time modding a game so it was quite a lengthy adventure.  Lots of trial and error for me, but maybe you'll do better.    Since I purchased k2 for pc on steam, I used crossover to install steam for pc.  At first I thought, ""hey I have a mac so I should install the mac version of steam.""  Turns out I'm stupid and you need to install the pc version of steam, duh.    Then I opened up steam (using that fancy crossover program), select ""library"", right click on k2, select ""properties"", select ""local files"", then select ""browse local files"".  From there, you can browse stuff in your mac folders (like the mods you downloaded that are in the downloads folder)  and you can also browse stuff with the C:\ thingy so you can open up the .exe stuff in the right folders.    I kinda forgot how I exactly installed k2 itself though, the whole damn thing was a super long process for me and involved a lot of me clicking on shit without actually knowing what would happen :)  But I think installing the game itself wasn't too hard once I got the pc steam installed.  Hopefully someone who actually knows what they're talking about will come along and help you out, good luck!"

kotor,39s37r,Snigaroo,6,Sun Jun 14 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm much mistaken, you can. The method used by Xuul is only one of many, and unless I'm further mistaken he found a new version of his method which works with steam anyway. That's for KOTOR 1, though; I'm not sure if KOTOR 2 has a flawless widescreen version out yet.  Anyway, the only thing that would interfere with widescreen function on steam is the presence of the cutscene CTD bug, which is an unrelated issue and is also present in non-steam versions."

kotor,39gwq8,gabed-em,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:57:16 2015 UTC,"OK, I had to create an account just so that I could respond to you on this.  Like you I searched high and low and watched countless videos before I figured something out: The save editor will only see games saved as standard file save names.  Everything you have done is correct but what is missing is in the save folder add an additional folder called 000002 - Game1 (I put spaces after the 2 and the dash, capital G and no space after the e of game).  I was able to create a new game save on my android and then upload the save to my Google drive.  Download the files (there should be 5 of them if doing this from the android version) and place them into the KOTOR>saves>000002 - Game1 folder.  Right click on the kse_333.exe and run as an administrator (don't know if you actually have to do that, but I did) select the KOTOR file (not the sub files) as the save destination and if you are lucky like I was, it will work. If it doesn't, no idea what to tell you, sorry.  I hope that this works for you."

kotor,39gwq8,IrishMilan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:07:54 2015 UTC,Sorry one other thing.  I have noticed that version 3.3.2 does not work because it requires bif files and for some reason 3.3.5 just wont open and terminates.  I was able to get things to work with version 3.3.3.  Downside however is that the feats and features and classes do no show up.  I found an android save edit on YouTube and was able to change everything that I wanted for myself afterwards (i.e. name and character type).  The YouTube save already has the Jedi class enabled.  Kind of a big work around if you want to do it that way.  Or just give yourself a bunch of experience and wait until you are a Jedi to level up.
kotor,39ded5,israphial,-6,Thu Jun 11 00:37:50 2015 UTC,"I've had some luck with some mods by just putting the mod files in the android/data/com.aspyr.swkotor/files/override folder (you might have to create it). I've been looking for a way to get the Brotherhood of Shadow mod working on it, but no luck yet. However, for some of the texture and/or weapons mods, it should work just by sticking everything in the override folder.  And actually, my phone isn't rooted, so it should work even without root. I don't know if that helps or hurts modding KOTOR.  edit: I saw this link a while ago http://www.lucasforums.com/showthread.php?p=2857701, finally read it to the point where someone on Youtube has a place to go. I don't know how he did it, but it looks like he has a link on his video's page where you can get a bunch of mods for Android, including Brotherhood of Shadow.
