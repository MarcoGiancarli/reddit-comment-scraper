If the tooth is one of the big ones at the back, this goes double.  Or even triple.  You may ask why I needed two root canals on the same root... My dentist missed a side branch of the nerve near the end, and four years later that little bit of missed nerve got infected, and my god it was excruciating.  Never, never again.  BTW the endodontist was not much more expensive, if any, then my regular dentist.  The office visit was more, but not the procedure."

I luckily have good insurance each root canal about $200 after insurance.  Not cheap but my endodontist is a superstar.  It's really funny though because like ALL the endo docs in my area all work for this one office.  They have sites in like 5 cities.  It's like an endodontic syndicate or cartel or something.

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3djku4,jamauss,2,Fri Jul 17 07:02:34 2015 UTC,"Count yourself lucky your dentist admitted it was a tricky root canal. My dentist thought it was tricky but had a go anyway. He ended up breaking the titanium file in the canal.  I had to go see one of the top endodontists in London who trains other endodontists. Luckily for me I think he only takes tricky cases for the challenge, so didn't charge me a fortune. The way he removes a broken file is to drill a straight hole to where the broken file is, then he puts some super glue on the end of a cannula and glues it to the file. He then can untwist it and remove it. Unfortunately in my case drilling a straight hole to where the file is would have meant leaving a hole in the side of the root as it was so curved. So he recommended leaving it and hoping it was clean enough to get rid of the infection. He finished off the previous root canal that went wrong and let me watch it live on a massive screen which was cool. The abcess came back a year later where the broken file was, so it had to be removed.  In the end I had to see a surgeon who wanted to put me under general anesthetic to cut my gum open and cut the root off. I couldn't afford the hospital bill, so the doctor agreed to do it under local anesthetic. I have one stitch left in my gum to dissolve, then hopefully I'll be done almost 1.5 years after the broken file incident and about £1000 worse off."

They have no additional training and most dentists have only done a couple root canals during their schooling.  Most roots are curved and unless the GD (general dentist) knows how the files work and how far they can bend chances are they will break them off and the end of the root and you have to have the tooth taken out.  Molars tend to have three to four canals, I've seen as many as six in one tooth. Your GD doesn't have a microscope to see these additional canals.  Odds are they will miss them and you will have to have the root canal redone in the future.  Chances are your GD may use the wrong type of material and again you would have to have it retreated.    This is why it is so important to see a specialist. While it is a hassle because it's not a one stop shop, it's in the best interests for your health. There are too many things that can go wrong if your root canal (or any dental work for that matter) isn't done by a specialist.   Also that calcium build up that they called it, is a pupal stone, and they usually strangle the nerve causing it to die thus needing the root canal. Those can be easily removed with the proper tools.   TLDR version: don't let a dentist take advantage of you. See a specialist and save yourself the hassle. You will be better off in the long run and so will your teeth. :)"
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3djku4,_Springfield,3,Fri Jul 17 09:08:07 2015 UTC,"Literally everything you said is fear mongering speculation. You could have said ""endodontists have more training and do this day in and day out....etc"" but instead you threw the rest of our field under the bus. I don't disagree that endodontists can do a better job...but you make general dentists seem like incompetent retards despite the fact that they are capable of performing root canals...and according to the AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION it's within their scope of practice"
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3djku4,ExodusRex,-3,Fri Jul 17 02:50:00 2015 UTC,"Just because it is in their scope of practice doesn't mean they should be doing it. I'm pretty sure the ADA also says your GD could drill a hole in your jaw and place an implant but the question is, would you want him to? Why not go to someone who does it day in and out and have it done right the first time.   All of those things I say because I have seen them. I've been a dental assistant for almost 10 years and have been in various specialties. The worst thing in the world is to see a patient have to have a tooth pulled because someone didn't go to a specialtist."

I'd also have no problem referring one of my patients to a specialist when the case calls for it. But specialists study extra for the HARD cases, which, like it or not can still be handled by general dentists if they are confident they can perform it at the same level.  Your entire post condemns anyone who isn't a specialist.....and I'm telling you as a specialist that it's wrong to do so. General dentists are qualified to perform procedures as routine as root canals - and many do so beautifully.  It's wrong to say that general dentists will always miss canals, use the wrong filler, won't have a microscope and will have bad results. It's plain wrong. There are plenty of endodontists about whom I can say the same. The trick is not to say those things because it is immoral and unethical to unfairly condemn members of our own profession."

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,homsikpanda,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"I like to use dishsoap after doing particularly greasy minor things, tire change, printer toner change things like that where ive got grease on me and no heavy duty soap, dish soap works surprisingly well for removing grease and the like. And keeps my actual bar soap from developing a gross layer of grease that takes wasting half the bar to get off"
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,spank859,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:31:55 2015 UTC,What's gross about it? It's not good for hair because it strips oils out that hair needs but other than that it will get you clean
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,homsikpanda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:34:58 2015 UTC,"this is why i, unintentionally tend to have like 2-3 shampoo/body washes in my tub =/ coz i usually buy a new bottle when i notice my current bottle is almost empty and has like 1-2 showers left. so i buy a new one...and forget it in another room, and forget i bought it, and buy another new 1 =/"

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,Booyahhayoob,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:46:00 2015 UTC,That's why you put it in the shower before you get in.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,keks63,2,Thu Jul 16 03:25:32 2015 UTC,How do you do that? ;)
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,CT417,0,Thu Jul 16 07:07:34 2015 UTC,Every time.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,nanoakron,-1,Thu Jul 16 05:39:31 2015 UTC,How the hell do you spend 20 minutes in the shower?

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,homsikpanda,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:08:54 2015 UTC,how do you not spend 20 minutes in the shower? it's relaxing and gets you away from the wife/kids/work/doing pretty much everything except being warm and naked.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,nanoakron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:46:17 2015 UTC,I pay water bills and share a house with 3 other people who need the shower at the same time in the morning.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,homsikpanda,2,Thu Jul 16 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"remember when you used to be able to take a nice relaxing bath for like, an hour, while you listen to an audiobook or the radio or something, now add in a nice relaxing warm rain falling on your head, and you'll understand why people have 20 minute showers"
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,3dgmah,BristolPalinsFetus,-2,Thu Jul 16 18:38:15 2015 UTC,I have never once in my life been this excited over shampoo.
