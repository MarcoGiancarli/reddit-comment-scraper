Christianity,3e25wj,pilgrimboy,21,Tue Jul 21 11:21:21 2015 UTC,"Nice article. I like it. The scriptures are pretty clear that Christians should ""bear one another's burdens"" ... how do you do that if you don't know someone else has a burden?  A church that's functioning as it should, needs to have honesty between brethren when trials come.  I've seen a few churches do better jobs at this. Hopefully it's the type of thing that we can learn from and grow in, instead of just ""intellectually"" acknowledging it's a problem, and then going right on in the same thing we've been doing."

I'm guilty of this too, not riding a high horse here."

I think the way this is displayed in the film is that as people mature, their individual emotions have less complete control over their actions and instead it becomes a collaborative effort.   I think if you wanted to shoehorn a more blatant Christian allegory into it, you could say maybe that the Holy Spirit is the upgrade to the command center that happens in Riley at the end. Instead of just learning that change isn't all bad and sadness isn't a ""wrong"" emotion she could also accept Christ and his in-dwelling would give her a more powerful control over herself (the bigger, collaborative command center at the end, and which was shown in her parent's heads)  Also - on the subject of sadness and the church, I completely agree that sadness/sorrow is a misused and ignored tool that God gives us. It takes first recognizing how powerful sorrow can be, then understanding what we should be sorrowful for (our offense to God - not the worldly fallout), and finally asking Him to cause a heart change in which we feel more sorrow in our offense to him than we do when things simply don't go our way."

I find the idea that Christians shouldn't be troubled by the fallout of sin that we experience on Earth to be troublesome and borderline gnostic. Are you suggesting that we grieve that greed exists in the world while remaining stoic in the face of the 'worldly fallout' of extreme poverty? When Jesus wept at Lazarus' death don't you think part of the reason for that was that Lazarus actually died (remember that death is the final enemy that will be defeated when Christ comes again [1 Corinthians 20-28])? If Christians are unable recognize that people suffering is a cause for sadness then we risk being as out of touch as Joy was in Inside Out when attempting to comfort Bing Bong."

This seems to be an individualistic approach to sadness that I think misses one of the more interesting points of Inside Out, that sadness and other emotions play an important social role. As Christians, I think we often have too individualistic of a perspective of our faith. We focus to much on how do I get saved and not enough on the kingdom of God and the body of Christ. I think recognition of the social role of emotion can help to combat that individualistic impulse.   I'm not sure why/how you extrapolated this to mean that we should ignore suffering in the world, sorry if I was unclear.   In your original post you only listed our offense to God as being something we should be sorry about while specifically denying that we should not feel sorrow over the worldly fallout of sin.

I maybe am suffering from some form of confirmation bias, trying to put what I'm learning personally into everything I see :D  Especially in protestant-based sects/denoms there does seem to be a historical trend of seeing faith as a more individual pursuit. Thankfully I've seen a lot of ""non-denom"" churches trying to buck this trend and sincerely focusing on the importance of the church body as a bunch of sinners who can help each other. Inside Out definitely seems to acknowledge the importance of a humility in our sadness, that we can be open about it and it can lead to love/community/help."

Christianity,3e3021,seemedlikeagoodplan,3,Tue Jul 21 17:23:44 2015 UTC,"Oh. Yeah, that's a Baptist thing. I grew up Anglican, which teaches consubstantiation (the bread and wine are spiritually Christ, though they are still physically/chemically just bread and wine).

Real Presence (Calvinist/Reformed) - Jesus' body and blood are present in some real way when we gather together. Memorial (Zwinglian) - the bread and wine are symbols which remind us of the original body and blood.      I'm Zwinglian, although I am not anti-Real Presence - so take my summaries of the other positions with a grain of salt :)"

Some of the Reformed believe in transubstantiation, which means they believe that the bread and wine physically changes into the Body of Christ, or they believe that their is a spiritual presence, i.e. Jesus is somehow spiritually if not physically present. Almost all Baptists believe that it is only a symbol.  Other than that, they're both Protestants and both low church."

This also leads the CRC toward more engagement with culture and Baptists toward creating an alternate culture that is less corrupted by sin.

How are we supposed to be the light on a hill if we insist of only sharing our light with others who have light? How are we supposed to make disciples of all nations without going to those nations and walking with the people there? That idea just seems to be the opposite of what Christ was all about.

We're commanded to teach others about Christ and actually not be isolated, but we're not to be best buddies with sinners. Jesus was with the tax collectors and such because 1. they were actually searching for him, making them actually righteous instead of, like the Pharisees, righteous on paper, and 2. because he was teaching them to be like him.

And if a Christian that you're in community with is in unrepentant sin, yes, eventually you need to stop treating them like a Christian - the implication being that maybe they actually aren't one, and need to be shown that.  At no point does Jesus say here that when people have poor doctrine you have to get away from them.

Anti-slut-shaming is an interesting one, but I see how you get there. (I would counter that he told the woman caught in adultery to leave her life of sin, which today might get called ""slut shaming"", but I digress.) Anti-imperialist is debatable. He very clearly is a King, and isn't ashamed of that. His Kingdom does not look like the kingdoms of this world, and he is a very different sort of King. But he was given plenty of opportunities to rebel against Rome, and didn't; indeed, many of his followers were disappointed in him for not doing so.  But open-minded is one that I'd say isn't supportable. I don't think you ever see Jesus saying ""Now, this is what I think... but some other people think different and that's totally fine. Whatever works for you."" Jesus speaks the truth, and invites us to take it or leave it. Many people did both. He was not impressed by the things that regularly impress us, or impress religious leaders, to be sure. ""Man sees the outward appearance, but God sees the heart."" But this is the same Jesus who said that it is a narrow gate and a straight path that lead to life, and a broad gate and an easy path that lead to death. Not the most ""open-minded"" thing in the world to say."

Christianity,3e1rfx,alfonso_x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:59:18 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm so over the faith/works controversy. It's obvious to anyone who reads Jesus's teachings that both faith and works are necessary, but by themselves insufficient for salvation. On the one hand, you have the Pharisees who had works but not faith. On the other you had the rich young ruler (and arguably Judas) who had faith but not works (RYR lacked works, Judas had evil works).  Now, the counterargument is that the rich young ruler and Judas didn't have true faith. But then you're just defining faith as an attribute that contains works or gives rise to works, and then the whole dichotomy and controversy is just a quibble over terms. It is clear that Jesus demands certain behaviors and actions of those who will enter his kingdom or call themselves his disciples.   Whether that behavior springs from faith or is a discrete complement to it could be an interesting question, I suppose, but it's hardly worth leaving a church or community over."
Christianity,3e1rfx,superherowithnopower,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:07 2015 UTC,"That's why the whole idea that there is a faith/works dichotomy at all is a Protestant idea.  Traditional Christianity holds that both are necessary, and Protestantism came along and said, ""No! Faith alone!""  So, the controversy isn't over faith/works. It's over ""faith with works"" and ""faith alone."""
Christianity,3e1rfx,alfonso_x,6,Tue Jul 21 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"My point is that no one really believes in ""faith alone.""   If you press them with an example of someone who had faith but not works, they'll inevitably say something like ""that's not real faith,"" and at the very least they'll imply a nexus between faith and works."
Christianity,3e1rfx,superherowithnopower,4,Tue Jul 21 13:27:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, in most cases that's totally true."
Christianity,3e1rfx,yibanghwa,9,Tue Jul 21 13:35:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of it ends up as bad Protestant theology anyway - Luther was rather insistent that faith, if one truly did have faith, will be expressed through works."
Christianity,3e1rfx,adamthrash,7,Tue Jul 21 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"It's not even really that. The Cathodox definition of faith is ""belief + works (acting out the beliefs)"" and for whatever reason, the Protestant definition is ""intellectual and emotional assent to a claim such that one follows the teachings of the claim (which include actions)."" I mean, these are practically the same thing."
Christianity,3e1rfx,bunker_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:49 2015 UTC,"That dichotomy is also incorrect, since little in the bible implies this, and it makes no sense at any rate when you consider that Jesus implied leniency for people who don't understand what they did wrong, which automatically means faith. Making [having the right metaphysics] an absolute requirement is completely antithetical to the idea of works, since it is adding in something that is effectively random, unlike morality. While the importance of faith was emphasized, this was more or less placed among other works, not an absolute requirement. Early Christians tended to apply the idea of invincible ignorance very strictly, saying that anyone who knew of christianity probably knew it was true, and thus rejection was a severe vice, but this was more a case of them not understanding others' intentions. In the end, people are simply ingroup biased and so devolved shortly after the time of Jesus.  At any rate though, proper emphasis on works is better than just faith. Even so, the fact that most have an inappropariate idea of which to focus on is another problem."

Christianity,3e1rfx,bunker_man,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"The entire thing comes off (more realistically simply is) as an excuse for people to be self righteous. Sure they might look like they aren't any better than anyone else, and don't make real efforts to be moral save for some weird obscure obsessions, but as long as they believe in the correct metaphysics it inherently makes them better and more deserving people than people who clearly are more moral than them! Because as long as they insist that no one is meaningfully moral (which might contradict the bible, but who cares.) because of total depravity they can insist that those judgements don't matter. As long as they have faith its all they need!  The entire new testament is about humility, but the problem is that many people seem to think humility as a concept simply fails to apply to certain areas. A binary of worthiness based on a single easy to do thing which they're allowed to use to think they're now a binary ""saved"" person who fulfills all meaningful obligations is simply arrogance. Many of these people simply think that anything they define as religiously proper based on nothing they are allowed to be extremely arrogant about."

Now, people here may be more entrenched in a viewpoint that you don't share, and believe is counter to your idea of ""a good Christian"" but overall we're all in agreement about salvation. (I don't see this overwhelming salvation through works that you do, heck even in the LDS AMA many were claiming their sect is trending towards salvation by faith not works) Thus, starting from that baseline of the Gospel it's an amazing opportunity to evangelize within the faith, and also broaden your understanding of different backgrounds. If you are too discouraged to see this place as a ministry opportunity, you have a small view of God.  While I'm not going to start attending Catholic mass and still have issues with many things that sect has done/does, this sub has taught me that I was completely misunderstanding the sacrament of confession as the modern church sees it, and their view of Mary. This is what I like about this sub, we're able to broaden our understanding of all the different areas of ""the Church"" and it allows us to be that much more effective in leading people to the Gospel.

Christianity,3e1rfx,jscheel,3,Tue Jul 21 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think this may be more indicative of humans in general. Large swaths of believers find it more convenient to cherry-pick their beliefs than to study and trust in the scriptures. The thing is, this is nothing new. Peter and Paul are constantly exhorting churches to study the scriptures, to remember that all scripture is important, etc. Going back even further, it's difficult to count how many times the Jews substituted their own beliefs (usually influenced by the pagan world they were living in) for God's word.  I feel your frustration. I often have it as well. Best thing we can do is continue studying the Word, continue preaching the Word, and continue having open dialog with others to hopefully spread the Word.  Finally, you may want to subscribe to /r/TrueChristian. I can't guarantee you will agree with everything there, but it may help alleviate some of your frustration."
Christianity,3e1rfx,tadcalabash,8,Tue Jul 21 12:06:31 2015 UTC,"I find the assertion that people are ""cherry picking"" from the Bible to be a little patronizing, as if everyone who disagrees on a theological point is merely being lazy and selfish.

Christianity,3e1rfx,jscheel,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I can see your point that it may sound patronizing, and I apologize for coming across that way. I could have worded my thoughts better. My concern is that, even after careful study of the scriptures, we can often come up with theology that runs counter to other scripture that we choose to ignore for the sake of avoiding unpalatable concepts. A great example is given by OP: the existence of hell. It's certainly unpalatable to think that those who are not saved are doomed to an eternity in hell, but, that doesn't make it any less real, regardless of how rigorous our study may be to the contrary.  I'm guilty of falling into traditionalism and legalism myself. I did it with drinking. I was originally against any drinking because I was taught to study the scriptures that warned against drinking, totally ignoring obvious other scriptures such as Christ turning water into wine. It was easy to selectively quote scripture to re-affirm my existing beliefs, it took years of questioning my belief and studying from the other viewpoint to realize I was doing that. In no way do I want to come across as a Pharisee. Legalism is deadly, and is the cause of a lot of strife in the church. Instead, both sides need to come together and study the scriptures with an open mind and respect for the Word and the truth in it. Ultimately, we have to admit that there are many things we can freely disagree on, but that there are also many things the scriptures leave no room for disagreement on."
Christianity,3e1rfx,tadcalabash,5,Tue Jul 21 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. You're right, it's certainly appealing to look at some of the more troublesome viewpoints in the Bible and ignore them outright.   However, I think it's important to examine those views very closely and study how they fit into the greater biblical whole. Just trying to reconcile tough scripture doesn't mean you're watering it down, and taking a more hard line stance isn't a virtue in itself.   Christians are going to disagree on how to interpret the Bible. Heck, they're often going to disagree on how to even read the Bible as a starting point. We have to stop dismissing other Christians viewpoints as being ""unbiblical"" if we're ever going to share community.   As to the specific question about Hell, there are certainly great Biblical arguments (both modern and historical) against the eternal fire and brimstone view that is so prevalent. I'm on my phone so I can't find many resources to share though."

Christianity,3e1rfx,The_Sven,5,Tue Jul 21 15:40:44 2015 UTC,I don't know if homosexuality is a sin. The Bible says it is but I have a hard time reconciling that with my belief in an all-loving God. Why would he create a person that way only to tell them they are to live a life of celibacy and loneliness? I suffered years of severe depression almost to the point of suicide because I couldn't find a woman to love. [Genesis 1:18-20] makes it clear (in my interpretation) that man was not meant to live alone and [Mathew 19:12] tells me that celibacy should be a choice. I just can't come come to an agreement between what my conscience is telling me and what the Bible says. I can't just choose to ignore the voice in the back of my head. If I had that kind of power over my personality I'd be living a completely perfect life because I'd just program myself to be perfect at all times.  I said I don't know if homosexuality is a sin.

Christianity,3e1rfx,Jake0958,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"Brother I'm sorry to say this but you don't love us, we are called to love others as God loved us, God's love is not judgmental, you cannot truly love someone and be angry with them. Your argument is just riddled with errors, we can't be like this and expect people to come to Christ. If there are people on the edge that may be homosexual you may have steered them well clear of a potential relationship with God. How do you know what God thinks of these things? Also Christ calls us to love not just our neighbors but our ENEMIES, not just those who are likeminded. Your understanding of hell is questionable and you are certainly not the final judge that will be sending people to heaven/hell. Finally, do try to remember very different Christian denominations will be on this subreddit and sadly some may claim to be Christian and share messages when they are in fact not.  God bless you."
Christianity,3e1rfx,drharris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:46 2015 UTC,"God's love is not judgmental   I'd love to hear where this is in the Bible. God's judgmental love is all over the thing, from Genesis to Matthew to the very climax in Revelation. He just doesn't judge the same way we do."
Christianity,3e1xs9,CATHOLIC_EXTREMIST,2,Tue Jul 21 09:30:03 2015 UTC,"This Bishop is truly deserving of remembrance and imitation.  However, I get nervous when we hold up such people without equally acknowledging and confessing that the Church as a body in the Ukraine enthusiastically celebrated, supported, and joined in the holocaust against the Jews.  As it did through out the Balkans, and in Poland, and in France.  Yes, there were heroic saints that showed the Hebrews the love of Christ in their hour of need, but those saints were far and few between.  The Church in it's membership and leadership was overwhelmingly in support of Hitler and all his works. If we are not in humble confession of these facts, we make ourselves complicit after the fact."
Christianity,3e1xs9,corathus59,5,Tue Jul 21 13:37:13 2015 UTC,"I think its fair to say that there's nuance in how Christians responded to Nazism and both sides need to be examined. Your response lacks nuance. That the church enthusiastically celebrated Nazism in Poland? The church was actively suppressed in Poland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_persecution_of_the_Catholic_Church_in_Poland  ""Enthusiastically celebrated, supported and joined"" ""Few and far between"" ""overwhelmingly in support of Hitler and all his works"" lacks the perspective that Christians made up an overwhelming majority of the European population and Christians and the church reflected the broad diversity of all segment's of European society's reaction to Nazism, from support and collaboration to rejection and resistance."
Christianity,3e1xs9,tincanoffish87,0,Tue Jul 21 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"Oh it definitely came to persecution as well.  That is one of the great ironies.  In the opening months of the occupation in Poland the SS troops were repeatedly intervening to protect Jews from the Polish population.  Those who persecute the Jews almost always end up persecuted themselves, as we saw in Poland and the Ukraine and in France.  Sincerely, and without sarcasm, I truly believe the lack fo nuance is on the other side.  There is no doubt that all who truly loved Christ in those times ran afoul of the Nazis.  What needs to be faced by the church is how many of it's followers and how many in it's officialdom never tried to act like Christ.  The Church was riven with those who enthusiastically collaborated with the Nazis.  We should give as much cautionary focus to the Christians who were not ready when the test came as we do to the Saints who inspire us all."
Christianity,3e1xs9,corathus59,4,Tue Jul 21 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"I guess what bothers me in what you're saying is that you're kinda just hand waiving away all the numerous examples of Christian laity and clergy who helped Jews and resisted Nazism and basically saying its not worth talking about, per your first comment, and saying all that needs to be discussed in Christian collusion with Nazism. I'm saying both extremes existed, you're saying only one extreme is worth discussing. I'm not at all denying the collusion in what I said."
Christianity,3e1xs9,tincanoffish87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:03 2015 UTC,"Then you really should go back and read my words again, because that is not what I said at all.  I have been saying flat out that these saints did exist, are worthy of celebration, and should be imitated.  All Christians should be instructed in their example, because we will see evil days again before history ends.  I am also saying that we must not edit down our instruction to only these great saints.  Unfortunately, they were the tiny minority.  The vast majority of the faithful sold out across Europe.  They sold out in Germany giving themselves to Hitler's movement.  They sold out in the occupied countries enthusiastically joining the holocaust against the Jews.    In every occupied country, the bulk of the killings were done by local militia directed by the SS, and they were almost always fanatic right wing activists of the church.  The fact that evil always turned on them in the end in no way mitigates the horrors they inflicted on the Hebrews and other minorities.  Both sides of this story must be taught and kept alive in the imagination of believers.  What the saints did, and how we should imitate them should the evil days come again.  And we should equally confess that most Christians sold out, and embrace the warnings history imparts us on how people fall away during such times.  Consider our Holy Texts.  There are more references to the brothers and sisters that fell away and sold out in the New Testament than there are references to martyrs who stood their ground.  Doesn't that tell us something?"

If that won't do it for you, you might listen to John Paul's confession on the subject when he went to Israel.

Christianity,3e2yx6,elsuperj,2,Tue Jul 21 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"This isn't really ELI5 but whatever.  I've been thinking about this kind of thing for a while. It's the case that apocalyptism is extremely dopamine stimulative for many reasons -- self-validation, 'secret gnosis,' tensile entertainment -- but I've been increasingly wondering why it seems to ""infect"" some people way more than others.  Now, some people are just young and impressionable and excitable, and they get really jazzed and cage-staged about all manner of things.  The stranger pattern I've seen is when normal people, whom you know and love, slowly creep into apocalyptism as they age, whether it's Judgment Day imminence, or ""Muslims are about to attack,"" or ""This generation stinks; mine was the last good one"" or ""America is in a death spiral"" or whatever.   We know that certain media actually profit, commercially, by selling these stories as true. But that's a memetic disease; we'd hope our loved ones would have ""memetic immune systems"" to resist these diseases. And yet, as they age, they become less and less resistant.  Why?  This is just postulation, so don't buy into it right away, but it might warrant some pondering:   Meaning comes from form discrimination according to interests. For humans, one of the most powerful is novelty, but there are others. After you've seen enough trees that look the same, they start to become meaningless individually, and you start to care more about the forest they constitute, and one forest vs. another. In other words, tedium yields reduction, and you start seeking meaning (usually ""novelty"") on the next layer-of-abstraction ""upward.""   Now, imagine that there are three layers of abstraction:   The lowest is your Day Experience.  The next is your Life Experience.  The last is your Metanarrative Experience.   When you're a kid, each day is its own grand adventure. You don't even think about tomorrow; each hour could hold something absolutely brand new and mind-blowing. Each nap is a missed opportunity for new cool stuff.  As you become older, days start to reduce as novelty is a spent fuel. You start to care more about the new movie this weekend, the new video game coming soon, the trip you're taking next month, the next time you can hang out with your friends.  Eventually, these things run out, UNLESS you have extremely fluid means (mobility, lots of dynamic things accessible, enough money to take part, etc.). The less opportunity here, the quicker you run out of prospects (this can happen very early on, if your opportunities are limited, either financially and/or geographically and/or in terms of plausible career or expression prospects).  Further, as you age, various long-term plans come to a close. You had your kids. You took that bucket list trip. Your career has ended. Your 401k has unlocked.  There are some folks who never run out.    High mobility and environmental dynamism can stave-off existential exhaustion for a long time. Grandchildren. RV-ing. Big hobby projects. Certain patterns are so highly dopamine reactive that they can lock people into addiction loops that don't get ""spent."" Gambling is one of the big ones for the elderly.   However, if you start running out of Life Experience prospects at this level (which happens at different times, and at different rates, and to different degrees, from person to person and situation to situation), or if you become convinced of ""tree tedium"" early (like by cultish tribal infection), then you start seeking novelty in your Metanarrative Experience.  This is where you start being overly concerned about the ""world's story,"" especially in a way that validates you, vindicates you, and gives you a sense of agency.  This creates fertile ground for jingoism, nation-worship, apocalyptism, crusaderism, judgment of others, and terrorism."

Also, if you know anyone who has worked with/for this guy previously, maybe quietly reach out to them and see whether this was an unusual brain-snap, a time of stress you don't know about or whether he's one of those guys who churn through unhappy colleagues one at a time."
Christianity,3e0c5n,jugsmahone,20,Tue Jul 21 00:14:33 2015 UTC,"I think those are good ideas. I sent an email to my pastor, asking him for advice as to what to do, with the caveat that he should keep it confidential.

This is someone who will treat you with contempt no matter what you do to try and appease them. Normal people, even those of a somewhat brash and dismissive temperament, don't speak to others like this  Please, don't say Yes. Don't cancel anything. Say No, you're not available. What's the worst that can happen? If it's that you don't end up working with them, well that's almost certainly a good thing  Also might be worth getting opinion from other people who've worked with/for him in the past, see what he's like.

If this continues, though, I'd consider having a meeting with someone your boss reports to or maybe the pastor for advice. You deserve better than that kind of treatment.   EDIT: For the record, I re-read his email to you, and it makes my blood boil. I'd be furious if I were you.

Christianity,3e0c5n,The_Sven,8,Tue Jul 21 02:51:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe the new executive director is a tinpot dictator. Maybe he is insecure in his new job. Maybe he has a lousy email style - that's very common, and I'd be surprised if you haven't run into that already in your professional life enough times to recognize it. Maybe he was having a very bad day.  Whatever, you fell into the trap of working out hierarchy and etiquette in email, which is quite possibly the most impersonal form of communication that has ever been invented, and very probably the one most unforgiving of nuances. If you had said the last paragraph to his face - the one beginning with ""Okay"" and ending with ""the same courtesy that I address you"" - you'd have had a better chance of resolving the real and imagined conflicts with this guy.  That said, I hope you have some friends or allies there, and I suggest making an appointment with whoever the executive director reports to fairly quickly. If you can discreetly make fact-finding visits to co-workers who have had the dubious pleasure of meetings with this guy, do so. If he's a territory freak, it will show up in his approach to them. I'm really sorry that this type of thing happens in youth ministries, just as I'm sorry that my career in social work administration came to a very abrupt halt because of dealing with people like that."

This guy was hired just after me (my job is to work with youth, and he's the executive director) and we're the only staff of the organization so far. Hopefully he'll lighten up a bit.

Through the course of my work at this organization I intend to ensure that all of my correspondance with colleagues and clients remains respectful, polite and above all professional.  I expect nothing less from you, as do our clients, supporters and donors.  I would be glad to meet with you face to face to clear the air and ensure we get off to a good start together.  Please confirm that you have received and understood this message.  Yours faithfully, <your name>'  MOST IMPORTANTLY I would cc in the chairman/governor/whoever it is he reports to for accountability.

Christianity,3e0c5n,willadair,22,Tue Jul 21 03:58:12 2015 UTC,Keep it biblical. Follow the principles laid out in Matthew 18. Try to get away from impersonal methods of communication and talk face to face. E-mail often leaves a lot to be desired. I hope this works out!
Christianity,3e0c5n,angelfist,17,Tue Jul 21 01:22:07 2015 UTC,"But email leaves a paper trail. That can protect you later.  Furthermore, this is not an equal relationship. When dealing with a boss or supervisor, going with a witness will be perceived as hostile.

Christianity,3e0c5n,dolphins3,9,Tue Jul 21 05:35:32 2015 UTC,"This is actually really great advice. You need to talk to the guy face-to-face before making too many assumptions about what's going on. As, /u/StephanieRidiculous points out, email is not always a very clear form of communication. For all you know, he just misinterpreted your couple of emails as someone who was jerking him around and not wanting to comply with his simple request. He may have had an experience in the past and is reacting based on that experience.   I would have tried to clear the air with the guy before sending him a strong email back or bringing others into the mix. If things go sour after that, then is the time to involve others."

I agree about the email, though, now that I think of it.

Christianity,3e0c5n,WiseChoices,3,Tue Jul 21 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"The precedent should be set in person, where you can be sure you aren't being misunderstood either. Breathe grace. It is much easier to win someone over in person, where they can't draw untrue conclusions or dwell and fixate & they can see your genuine desire to reconcile and move forward in a positive direction. There is nothing at all wrong with ensuring you are being treated well. Pray for him. Offer to pray when you get to meet in person. Be sure that your heart desires Gods plan for you two, not for the satiation of your pride. (I'm not wagging a finger. I find it easier to reconcile when I remind myself of how God would have me interact with people. It helps me move away from feeling personally offended and toward living peaceably with all I'm able to.)"

In every job I've worked at, acting like that in a business communication would be actionable with HR.  And for everyone saying that ""oh, maybe he's just stressed/had a bad day"", that's true, but this isn't a social relationship, but a professional one, and has happened several times now. Personal stress isn't an adequate excuse for this kind of behavior. If he isn't mature enough to handle his personal issues and maintain a certain level of civility, he should have a job that involves directing others."
Christianity,3e0c5n,Agrona,7,Tue Jul 21 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, his response is not nice.  However, I can understand having a very much smaller amount of frustration when, after being asked for a schedule, you say ""my schedule is XYZ except for when I don't follow it, which happens regularly"".  Maybe it would be a good idea to setup a networked calendar (Google calendar, whatever calendar system the office uses, etc) that gives your real daily schedule, not the general schedule for meetings that you sometimes have to deviate from.  That does work much better at my job here at your friendly local MegaCorp."
Christianity,3e0c5n,rorrimlmirror,11,Tue Jul 21 00:08:44 2015 UTC,"I understand that, and it's what I've done with my other supervisor. However, this was an email that was supposed to only be about when we would meet; I didn't realize he was looking to get my full schedule.  And, given the nature of the work, I would expect that he should know I have to work strange hours sometimes to meet with parents, meet with other pastors in the area, etc."
Christianity,3e0c5n,CarbonPhoto,4,Tue Jul 21 00:25:17 2015 UTC,Sounds like he is a Power Hound and trying to make his mark.  Sad.  Setting good boundaries is a great start.  I would never send anyone my schedule.  That is so rude.  He doesn't own you.

Maybe he's just a no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point kind of guy. Maybe he doesn't deal well with vagaries, small talk, relationships, storytelling, etc. Or maybe he's coming off of a recent bad experience with someone like that. I'd suggest maybe a similar just-the-facts approach, without a lot of extra explanations, perspectives, etc. After composing an email to him, sit on it a little bit, then come back and edit it, stripping out any extra bits and streamlining it to make it crisp and to the point.  That said, I'd be bent out of shape by his note too. Since he didn't hire you, but rather came in after you, a softer touch would have been more appropriate, even if he is under any pressure to establish that he can perform right away, or whatever is motivating him."
Christianity,3e0c5n,flyingburritoman,6,Tue Jul 21 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but ""no nonsense"" and ""doesn't deal well with vagaries, relationships"" doesn't bode well for a career in youth ministry."

As other people have suggested, not only is it good practice but Biblical to approach the guy face-to-face to work it out, showing grace and love, and going into it giving him the benefit of the doubt. I'd say that's your best bet. You've clearly got sticking up for yourself handled, so that probably won't be an issue. Just have to figure out what his is!

Find out clearly what is the chain of command and what is the expected level of respect and professionalism.   The emails so far sound very patronizing, rude, unprofessional and overall out of place. This needs to be addressed at the very beginning. If nobody is going to control the way this person acts, better leave before you're to deep into the mess."

Christianity,3e0c5n,cessage,3,Tue Jul 21 06:49:05 2015 UTC,"This is sadly all to common in churches. My advice would be to go to the meeting and clearly state how you wish to be treated and that his previous tone was unacceptably condecending. If you can't come to an agreement then quit and communicate the reason to the people that appointed him. His attitude will destroy the morale of the team, and you'll be stuck between a rock and hard place and lose the love you had going into the job in the first place as you slowly harden, sour or burn out. Yes some might feel it seems rough or harsh or overreacting if you quit, but it is much better than being put through a meatgrinder and ending up resenting everything church-organization related."

And the second one makes it sound like you think people only live to be one year old. And the third one isn't really true. People aren't any worse than they ever were.

It's similar to how I have let my lawn become overgrown, but the overgrowth is God's superordinate responsibility and ordination, since he could have miraculously mowed it. Of course, I don't expect him to mow my lawn, nor do I blame him for staying his lawnmowing hand. But the superordinate responsibility and ordination remain."

I get the point of making the statue in the first place.  Political satire is often a very effective way to make a point.  Well done.     The statue’s first home in Detroit was to have been Bert’s Market Place, but owner Bert Dearing returned the Satanic Temple’s rental fee after he learned that the group was affiliated with satanists. “When I rented the place, I just thought it was a church,” he told ABC News. “I didn’t know about the unveiling of a statue. We weren’t aware they were into devil worshipping.”   So it must be a shadowy conspiracy!  It can't possibly be that this Bert Dearing fellow doesn't want his market place associated with Satan worship."

That's not something I would want to get involved in, but I am still critical of the notion of using satanism to put Christianity in it's place, so to speak. I am all for respecting other's beliefs when they are different from mine, but Satanists wish to exploit this openness to force Christians to either stop doing what they think is right (evangelizing) or force them to accept and keep mum about a ""religion"" that is either disingenuous or diametrically opposed to them. That's not a reasonable thing to do, and I think it's fair to call a spade a spade, and say ""either you're fakes and don't deserve any legal respect, or I am justified in considering you as evil."""
Christianity,3e1zox,Aclopolipse,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"At least we can both agree that the Satanists' methods are obnoxious.   But there seems to be some confusion here about why they're doing it.  The controversies surrounding the Satanic displays most often involve public land or public money.  In theory, the government treats all religions equally, but the problem is that many of the Christians in power who put Christian displays up did so with the express purpose of promoting Christianity, not promoting religious diversity and the openness to various belief systems.  What Satanists are exploiting is a lack of openness - they're counting on the fact that those powerful Christians would rather have a government that stays out of religion than one required to give equal support to Christianity and something heretical to Christianity."

The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions. One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone. The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forego your own.  Beliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world. We should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit our beliefs. People are fallible. If we make a mistake, we should do our best to rectify it and resolve any harm that may have been caused. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought.

My problem is that, whether they are genuine in their beliefs or not, I feel I should oppose it. If they are not genuine in their beliefs, a la FSM type atheism, I think that they air making a fair point in trying to promote secularism but they are going about it in an unnecessarily combative way. They will win some legal cases but I think they are burning bridges as far as getting christians to accept the positives of secularism and developing common ground.  If they are genuine in their beliefs in worshiping satan, they have created a religion based on refuting Christianity. While, as a citizen of a secular state I have to respect their place in it alongside everyone else, but as a Christian I feel that I must do what I can to demonstrate the immorality inherent in it, which is, in my view, distinct from any other religion.

If you do, my opinion is that there's something deeply wrong with your point of view.

I think you'll find that among gay marriage supporters a definition of ""marriage"" is held in common that does, in fact, include the union of same-sex couples.    The debate is/has been over what marriage is.  The state has its definition.  Fine.  But then so does the Church, and the Church (nor its members) ought not to be compelled to recognize as ""marriage"" what they do not and have never understood to be a marriage.  This ought to be recognized and protected under the freedom of religious expression which necessarily includes the free expression of one's personal convictions in actions and behaviors where those actions and behaviors do not cause or threaten immediate physical harm to other people.  As a Catholic, I could not in good conscious attend a civil ""marriage"" ceremony between two Catholics in which one or both of the participants were divorced.   If my participation in a wedding or other event which I believed to be immoral would in fact amount to, or could be reasonably construed as, my active and approving participation in said event, I would have no choice but to excuse myself and choose not to participate.  I would hope that a society founded on the principle of the freedom of conscience, and which has ever permitted special exemptions from generally applicable laws--such as exemptions for conscientious objections to combat or military service in the case where such service is generally compulsory--would recognize the importance and the value in permitting certain exemptions in the cases we've been discussing.

Imagine if my religious beliefs held that X race is subhuman, they aren't really 'people'. Therefore, I can still serve everyone equally, and deny service to X, because Xs don't qualify as part of 'everyone'.    But then so does the Church, and the Church (nor its members) ought not to be compelled to recognize as ""marriage"" what they do not and have never understood to be a marriage.    And nobody is asking them to. The state has not empowered bakeries to recognize marriages or not.

Is it just to take away someone's livelihood because they choose to behave according to the dictates of their conscience where no physical harm to another living being is either caused or intended?  Is it just to ask a sole proprietor to provide a service for a people or event that affirms something they regard as immoral?    Suppose a for-profit business that manufactures chemicals but whose owners personally believe the death penalty to be immoral are approached by a state government to provide the chemicals that will be used for lethal injections.  I'm not asking what the law says the business must do.  I'm asking what's just!  Is it just to require the owners of that business to violate their consciences by being complicit in an activity they regard as gravely immoral?  Surely you can't think it would be just for the state of Texas to threaten to close down a business and fine its owners for not providing the lethal cocktail of chemicals that would legally be used to put human beings to death when it violated the owners' conscience.

Now, I do agree that one has a right to follow one's conscience, of course. I do agree that one has a right to go about one's business without being forced to violate one's conscience. Within limits.   Let's look at some other examples. If my conscience tells me I cannot serve or even address unmarried women or women who are not my family, is it just for the state to make me? Can't I put up a 'no women' sign on my store?   Let's say that I am against war (I personally am). Is it just that the state makes me pay taxes that indirectly could fund warfare?   So, yes, I think that you do have a point, people should not be forced by the state to violate their conscience. However, this is not without limits. For example, women have a right to public accommodation, and this right is not superseded by a business owner's conscience. The same applies for gay people.   I think it is just for the state to tell the owner, ""Sorry bud, you signed up for a business licence, where you promised to serve the public equally, you can't say 'oh but no women'."" Something such as a public accommodation business is a contract between a business entity and the state, where the state allows the entity to operate, provided the entity complies with the state's rules.   This is a contract that both parties enter willingly. It is not forced on anyone.   So, my position is that the state cannot force a person to violate his/her conscience, but is free to oblige a business to comply with local laws and regulations, especially when these regulations deal with the civil rights of others. A public accommodation business is meant to accommodate the general public, if you sign up to do that, you need to accommodate the entirety of the general public, not just the ones you agree with."

But if they were in business to sell x, y, and z chemicals to the general public, they should have been willing to sell x-y-z chemicals to any customer regardless of the purpose to which those chemicals were going to be put.  It's exactly the same thing with a wedding cake, isn't it?  If a business is in business to sell wedding cakes to the general public, then according to you they have an obligation to sell their cakes to any customer regardless of the use their cakes will be put to, even if they regard that use as immoral.

And you can not say you are objecting to the event either, as there is no functional difference between a straight wedding and a gay wedding.   That's exactly what I was trying to say.  The fact that these bakeries refuse to even attempt to accommodate a homosexual customer is what makes it so discriminatory."
Christianity,3e29f1,Aclopolipse,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:29 2015 UTC,"But should the lesbian couple in my example be compelled by fear of civil penalties including the loss of their business and their livelihood to cater the pornographer's event?  What's your opinion?  Or should the gay couple be compelled through fear of incurring a fine they can't possibly pay to provide their services to a convention of conversion therapists when they believe (and perhaps the science really does back them up) that conversion therapy does palpable harm to people like them?  What do you think about that?  Or should a Catholic tailor who specializes in vestments and liturgical appoints be forced to provide vestments for a Black Mass during which a stolen consecrated host will be desecrated?  In the interest of freedom of conscience--a freedom we ought to hold dear--I would say ""no"", ""no"", and ""no"".  In fact I would insist upon it.  But are you really insisting that we don't have a right to the fruits of our labor, or to the labor itself, to dispose of it (sell it, give it away, whatever) as we see fit?  Are you saying that people have a right to appropriate it to themselves against the consent of those whose it is to give?"
Christianity,3e29f1,unsubinator,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"Neither pornographers nor conversion therapists are a protected class. But I would expect a business to be mature enough to go about their business respectfully so long as their customer's petition their services respectfully. If the customers are rude and disruptive to the business while at the same time attempting to render services from the business, then by all means refuse business to them. But if they are the model of normal customers, then render services to them, no matter if they happen to be pornographers, conversion therapists, or members of a different religion.   Or should a Catholic tailor who specializes in vestments and liturgical appoints be forced to provide vestments for a Black Mass during which a stolen consecrated host will be desecrated?   If it was definitely stolen, then the tailor should call the cops, because stealing is against the law.   In the interest of freedom of conscience--a freedom we ought to hold dear--I would say ""no"", ""no"", and ""no"". In fact I would insist upon it.   All freedoms have their limits. All things have their limits. There is no such thing as a freedom without limits, without stating the willfully obtuse, e.g. ""freedom to breath oxygen"".  Ideally, in a more emotionally mature world, the bounds of our limits of conscience would be larger, because people would be able to conduct their selves better in any conflict. But we don't live in that world. At least not yet.   And so laws, things more restrictive than personal emotional limitations, must substitute our own human insufficiency in maturation.   And lastly, there is the relation between Power and Responsibility. One has as much responsibility in a situation as they have power to affect that situation. Businesses, by virtue of being businesses, have more power than individual customers. Consequently, businesses have more responsibility in handling the situation. There is greater onus and expectation on the business' part than the customer's part due to the disparity in power.   If an adult gets in to a fight with a child, we protect the child and chastise the adult, because the adult inherently has more power than the child and thus has greater responsibility for the outcome of their interactions.    But are you really insisting that we don't have a right to the fruits of our labor, or to the labor itself, to dispose of it (sell it, give it away, whatever) as we see fit?    We haven't had that right since the Civil Rights movement. At least not in terms of businesses. If you're a private seller, like on Craigslist, then you can be as racist or sexist or whatever-ist as you want, because you are formally not a business. But once you formally become a business, you give up some autonomy in exchange for the benefits of being recognized as a business.   When you want to gain something, there's almost always something you have to lose in return. To gain an object, we usually have to spend money. To gain money, we usually have to expend time and effort. To gain the benefits of being a business, we have to subject ourselves to the laws governing businesses."

What is the moral principle you base this opinion on?   If it was definitely stolen, then the tailor should call the cops, because stealing is against the law.   Perhaps you don't really know what I meant.  I meant that at a Catholic Mass, someone went through the communion line under false pretenses and, rather than consume the host (which would still be a sacrilege if the communicant wasn't a Catholic in a state of grace) pocketed the host for use at a Black Mass.  I doubt the police would be very interested in the case of the stolen host.   personal emotional limitations   Equating convictions of conscience with ""emotional limitations"" just shows me that we're talking about different things.    Do you believe that exempting the Amish from military service is a good thing?  Or do you think that the civil government ought to be indifferent to private convictions of conscience and not allow any exemptions from generally applicable law?"
Christianity,3e29f1,unsubinator,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:58:09 2015 UTC,"I suppose... emotional development morality? Which isn't exactly a thing, at least not yet. But it's not too distantly analogous to Jesus' behavior. He served people independent of their creed and background. Sure at times he said ""Go and sin no more"", but He always left it at that, and left it to those He served to come to that statement on their own terms. He did not hinge His service on whether they managed that first. His service came first, and then his admonishment, and then He never followed up on His admonishment, never returning to inquire as to whether that person had managed to rectify their selves or not. He rendered His services, admonished them, then never bothered them again, in that order.  I suggested some time ago that caterers and the like do similarly. Render services, give a vocal admonishment, then leave the customer to their own devices. There is no law against giving vocal admonishments, no matter how it might hurt the feelings of the receiver. Unless the admonishment would be in the form of a threat, which is easy enough to avoid doing.  If the tailor was aware of this theft while understanding that the police won't do anything about it, then the tailor can simply state, ""I do not want to be party to theft, no matter how insignificant."" The act of stealing wafers is not a protected aspect of the religious faith of black mass attendees; they are perfectly capable of purchasing their own little wafers, consecrating it on their own time, and then defiling it on their own time. There's no point in time where a person can say ""stealing is a protected aspect of my religious faith"".  So the tailor is not at risk of being sued for discrimination because theft is not a protected aspect of any religion.  Convictions of conscience without the flexibility to find personal solutions that don't infringe on the rights of others is a stage 3 weakness. Convictions of conscience without the responsibility to accept the consequences of adhering to then is a stage 2 weakness. The types of anger emerging as a result of this situation seems to be Self-righteousness and Indignation, stage 3 and stage 2 types of anger respectively. This actually is a matter of emotional limitations.   I thought all people are exempt from military service? We have a volunteer army."
Christianity,3e29f1,Leuku,19,Tue Jul 21 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"The act of stealing wafers is not a protected aspect of the religious faith of black mass attendees; they are perfectly capable of purchasing their own little wafers, consecrating it on their own time, and then defiling it on their own time.   Black Mass attendees actually understand the thing they defile.  That's why they know they cannot consecrate it ""on their own time"".  If their priest went through the motions of consecrating the wafer it would remain as it was before--a wafer.  Thus, no act of sacrilege or defilement could take place.  They need to abscond with the consecrated host because they know (or believe) that the validly consecrated host is Jesus--body, blood, soul, and divinity.    Now, some people may play at Black Masses and not get this, but people who are really in touch with the demonic know better.  But since you're hung up on the theft of the host, let's omit the host and just say that the tailor knows the requested vestments will be used at a ceremony where the name of Jesus will be blasphemed.  I contend that the tailor has a right to refuse to sell his produce or his labor in this case as a matter of justice.  It can simply do no good to insist that ""the law requires x"".  If the law does require ""x"" then the law is an unjust law, according neither to human nature or common sense.  I used a different example in another comment...  Suppose a for-profit business that manufactures chemicals but whose owners personally believe the death penalty to be immoral are approached by a state government to provide the chemicals that will be used for lethal injections. I'm not asking what the law says the business must do. I'm asking what's just! Is it just to require the owners of that business to violate their consciences by being complicit in an activity they regard as gravely immoral? Surely you can't think it would be just for the state of Texas to threaten to close down a business and fine its owners for not providing the lethal cocktail of chemicals that would legally be used to put human beings to death when it violated the owners' conscience.   Convictions of conscience without the responsibility to accept the consequences of adhering to then is a stage 2 weakness.   Yes it is a weakness.  We must all be willing to suffer the consequences of standing up for our moral convictions.  But that isn't the point.  The point is that we all have an obligation to advocate for the just application of laws and that our laws themselves reflect justice as they protect the inalienable rights of human beings.  One does not have a right to goods and services provided by another unless those goods and services are necessary to fulfill some greater good, such as the preservation of life or bodily health (psychological health is too wishy-washy a subject and no one has an obligation to make sure everyone feels ""affirmed"").  But one does have a right to act according to their moral convictions and my point is that if we would truly live in a just society, that right ought to be protected by positive civil law.  Instead, the exercise of that right ought not to be punished by positive legislation.  When the early Christians were compelled to offer worship to the Emperor as if he were a god, many of them refused, knowing full well what consequences lay in store for them.  Many of them went willingly and even joyfully to their deaths.  But surely we can both agree that a more just society would not have required that penalty--or any penalty--of the Christians in the first place.  Under current law a lesbian couple could be penalized for refusing to provide their services to a pornographers convention.  I believe that penalizing them for acting in such an instance according to the dictates of their consciences would be an unjust application of the coercive power of the state.  Granted that if they really believe that pornography is a terrible crime against women then they should act as their moral convictions dictate in spite of the consequences.  All I'm saying is that they should fear no consequences from the state and it is an unjust law that would penalize them for so doing."

There is no ""typical"" argument at this point but it will almost certainly be based around the right to not attend the wedding for businesses where that is required to perform their duties ( or I assume based on the cases and appeals that are currently being developed). Individuals feel attending the service is supporting it which is against their beliefs. I stated in another comment, unless you are forced to take part in the ceremony or celebration I don't think it passes muster to be aplied in court."

What is less likely is that these are done to antagonize people for their beliefs.  I doubt the couples give much of a care as to why they're being denied service - they care that they're being denied service for who they are in a country where discrimination has supposedly been illegal for half a century.  Yes, some will fight all the way to the top to set a precedent against discrimination, but that can hardly be considered selfish."

Christianity,3e29f1,zimm3r16,7,Tue Jul 21 13:42:35 2015 UTC,Because you have the right to exercise your religion. This includes not supporting same sex marriage or causing scandal by being forced to make a cake for them. (People will undoubtedly ask where they got the cake. Learn it was you. Now you're Christian. Think it's ok to support same sex marriage. )  Also many catholic institutions are being forced to pay contraceptives and abortion.  If you want to have same sex marriage. Fine I don't care. But that doesn't mean everyone else has to follow along. Sadly it's turned from equal protection to forced acceptance.
Christianity,3e29f1,daLeechLord,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:03:38 2015 UTC,Actually the state doesn't care if you as a citizen accept it or not.   It cares that businesses don't discriminate against a segment of the population.
Christianity,3e29f1,zimm3r16,3,Tue Jul 21 13:24:31 2015 UTC,And that is crap. A person doesn't lose their right to practice their religion because they run a business.

That's a false dilemma and furthermore ignores the gay couple's rights completely.    But if it is the latter then there is NO RIGHT TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.    Your religious freedom has limits. Just like a man can't start beheading people in his town and say ""Oh my religious freedom allows it"".

Everyone is free to go right on indulging the black prejudice of their heart till their cows come home.  They just can't refuse service in public businesses.  That's all.  I'm old enough that I remember my family being refused service at the store and the cafeteria counter.  I remember how that felt.  How ugly and wounding it was to the soul.  The people who did that were very vocal that it was their sincere religious belief that caused them to discriminate.  They took angry exception to having their bigotry named for what it is as well.  Their rationalization was one big self deception then, and it is one big self deception now.  We are driving the young out of the pews with our false accusation and with the way we bear false witness against gays.

Sometimes people give that impression and new believers can become disillusioned when things ostensibly carry on status quo.  That being said, as a Christian it's important to find a church to plug into and join a community of other Christians. That's what Christ had intended for us. Reading the bible is all well and good, but it's only one piece of the pie."
Christianity,3e1l27,TheQuakerlyQuaker,2,Tue Jul 21 06:56:05 2015 UTC,"So much of this. Find a church willing to pour into you, we call that discipleship. You don't need to know our fancy terms yet, just show up and embrace those around you."
Christianity,3e1l27,sortofrelativelynew,12,Tue Jul 21 14:10:52 2015 UTC,"The first thing you need to know is that is always comes back to the Cross. It seems odd, but no matter how long you've been walking with Christ, you will always find yourself kneeling at the Cross. The Cross is not a one stop shop, where you exchange your sins and then move on happily into life, to do as you please. It's a place you come to every day, and where you surrender your life, dreams, hopes, fears, and sins.   Second, being a Christian is more about the relationship (super cliche, I know) than it is about what you do. However, when you live in communion with God, He will prompt you to do things that are crazy. Like, totally against the logic of the world crazy. And that's okay. That's called trusting God.   Three, your best friend is the Holy Spirit. When you surrender your life to God, the Holy Spirit will come and live inside of you. He will guide you, give you spiritual insights, and teach you to hear His voice. It's important to note that the Holy Spirit does not say anything He does not hear God the Father say. So, if you think the Holy Spirit is telling you to murder someone, then that's not God. Whatever the Holy Spirit tells you will line up with the Scripture.  Four. The Bible is where God tells you all the bits and pieces you need to know about how He sees you. So, take it all as you will, and seriously, please, wrestle over the theology, wrestle over the science, but ultimately, know your Bible. It's from the Bible that the Holy Spirit will speak to you the most. And it's in the Word that God will speak to you about your identity. This is huge! This is where your spirit will get confirmation of his deep, undying love for you. Where you will be reminded and taught of his grace for you that covers ALL of your sins.   Five. You will always be growing. You will never arrive. Luckily, the Bible says that God ""who began a good work in you, will bring it to completion."" (Phil. 1:6). So, even though you will never be perfect on earth, you will be redeemed fully.   Six. No church is perfect. Regardless of where you end up, there will always be sin (remember #5). So every church will have flaws. But it's up to you to be a fruitful member of the community. Get involved, find someone to disciple you, and volunteer. You will have frustrations and moments of wanting to give up on church, but I promise, if you stick it out, it's worth it. Having said that, listen to God's leading on the church. Just because most churches are good, God may want you to be at a specific church. So pay close attention to the Spirit. Often, it may just be that you ""feel"" at home. Sometimes, it may come down to your thoughts being consistently drawn back to a church.   Seven. Although denominations are great and all, there's not so much of a difference as Christians make. I would advise you to check out and talk to the pastors at several churches before settling on one. The minor differences are usually in style of worship (Presbyterian v charismatic), and you may end up in one or another based upon personal preference. That's totally okay. Please don't get caught up in debating the small points. Always remember that it comes back to the Cross, and as long as we all have that, then the small points are not as significant as others may think.  Okay, sorry for the long post. Please pm or comment here if you have more questions! I'd love to discuss this more with you."

Christianity,3e1l27,AslanComes,3,Tue Jul 21 07:32:42 2015 UTC,"You know its funny, but the gospel you probably want to start with is John... its different from the first two in that its not synoptic, meaning its structure, narrative, and what events it concentrates on are very different from the first three, but as someone just approaching Christianity, it tends to be the one that makes the most sense in a way...   Denominational arguments aside, this is the most basic Biblical definition of salvation: ""Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved.” Acts 16:31   If that sounds way to easy, you're pretty much right, but what it ultimately comes down to is that, confessing Jesus as your Lord and Savior before a gathering of witnesses and then being baptized... the manner of which is argued denominationally, if you're looking at Orthodox or Catholic, I actually don't recall what their adult process is, but most Protestant denominations go for full water immersion, with a wide range of choices... quite a few like to go the river route, I myself was baptized in a friend's hot tub... I actually am less in favor of this route, hot tubs are slippery and I almost took my pastor down with me...  Honestly I think the best tip I can give... if you have friends who are already Christians, just start asking them a bunch of questions... if they are open and honest and you like what you hear then that's a good sign. If they are nervous its probably that they see you as a ""witness opportunity"" and regardless of public perception, most Christians aren't prepared for it, so chances are high they'll screw it up... so be forgiving but there's no reason to let them off the hook either, if they don't know something give them a chance to find the answer. If they're outright dodgy and say things like ""well we're not supposed to question that"" then that's a bad sign, I would avoid that. I know of some churches that have made more atheists than Christians with that stupid policy.  That's the easy thing to do I think... find someone you already find agreeable. If you don't know one... I dunno, ask around. There are quiet Christians who don't talk about their faith all the time... honestly I find these people the type who will give you their most honest answer. It might not be ""theologically"" correct but if a persons impressions are all they have, the most important things will at least be generally remembered, and unless they're just not in the mood they ought to be totally open to answering any questions you have.  Hope this helps. :)"
Christianity,3e1l27,SirPribsy,2,Tue Jul 21 09:38:05 2015 UTC,Great responses here in the thread so I'll just share this - Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis was the book that helped me the most when I was an atheist to make sense of the logical basis for faith in Jesus.  The Reason for God by Tim Keller or Simply Christian by N. T. Wright are both slightly more modern takes on it if you find Lewis to be difficult for reasons of style.  Do try Lewis first though is my advice.  He was an atheist for many years before converting to Christianity and he writes with total honesty and integrity.
Christianity,3e1l27,2CoinsOfLittleValue,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:46 2015 UTC,"So a phrase I love about Christianity is ""You will never, in this life, arrive as a Christian"" Our struggles will be constant, while God is omnipotent (all powerful), he's also omniscient (all knowing) which implies his knowledge is beyond our comprehension. So while we know that God has the ability to heal us from temptation instantly, He does not promise that for us in our worldly lifetime, and He works on His own timing with a grand scheme for His good.  That being said, there's also a concept of ""progressive sanctification"" (link has a bunch of scripture references) with the disciplined pursuit of Him, the daily reminder of His sacrifice, and it's power in our lives, and the power of His Holy Spirit, we can continually trend better and better, temptations will become easier to resist (they won't go away in this life, He never promises that) and therefore we can turn to Him instead of acting out in sin.  Remember to read context when single verses are shared. Otherwise things out of context can become very damaging. If the context is more confusing, ask for help! (that being said, if you know the context supports the single verse, and your use of it, single verses are great for memorization, to pull out when a temptation seems too powerful!)  Finally, don't try to do it alone! You mentioned ""going to church"" in your post, but it's so much more than that. The church isn't just the building and the sermon, but all of the people around you. Don't let your pride (the biggest motivator for sin in our lives) get in the way of being vulnerable with people at church, we're all broken, we all have struggles with sin RIGHT NOW, and we're all seeking out godliness. Just as you know how much you need God, understand everyone else does. Every time you encounter a time of sin and come out on the other side, God is equipping you to show His eternal grace to the people around you. This is the key to Christian fellowship/brotherhood/community/whateverwordyouwanttouse"
Christianity,3e1l27,alecbgreen,2,Tue Jul 21 14:03:06 2015 UTC,"I would say prayer is a huge thing. It sounds cliche, I know, but it can help you build a relationship with God. Don't be afraid to pour out your feelings to him. Ask for him to help you find out the truth about him. Say prayers for wisdom. Say prayers of thanks. Don't feel like you have to follow a certain formula. Jesus set the example in the model prayer, yes, but there is no exact way to pray. Just speak to God about anything in a heartfelt way and he will hear."
Christianity,3e1l27,kjfriend,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"I'd like somebody to tell me the basics on how to be a Christian...    To be a Christian means to recognize Christ as God in the flesh, the Lord of heaven and Earth, our savior and great king. You are his; he bought you at a great price. Follow his commandments. Take up your cross, die to self, and follow Christ wherever he goes.   and be saved...   Romans 10:9 - ""That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.""  But please note, Matthew 7:21  """"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.""  Faith must not be dead. You must be active and participate. You were created for good works, which God prepared in advance for you to do.    and be happy.   The Holy Spirit is God's gift to his church and joy is a natural fruit of the spirit. Joy is a mixture of hope, faith, thankfulness, and a longing expectation for God to finish making everything right. Happiness is often material comfort, satisfied needs and the lack of conflict. Joy ≠ happiness.   So, tips. PRAY continually, throughout the day. Christ commands us to ""remain in him."" This is one way we do it.  FIND a church and immerse yourself in the local body of believers. Bear their burdens and share your joy and pain with them. Attend worship regularly. Christians are to be a body of priests.   READ scripture daily. Meditate on it, memorize it, eat it like real food. Let it work its way into your inmost parts. It will change you for the better.  Best wishes to you friend. Let us know how we can pray for you!"

You've taken the first step on your own, be cautious about going further with help from others.   Advice is fine, just take it with a grain of salt. Consecrate a solid relationship with a Priest or Pastor and talk spiritually when necessary. Otherwise, don't pressure yourself.  I realize you're excited and eager, but keep it in check.

Christianity,3dy5jb,Emperor_of_lce_Cream,71,Mon Jul 20 14:21:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Welcome to the family!  1. Does my salvation depend on baptism according to any Church doctrine? (I have a feeling Catholic and Orthodox Christians might think so).  Some church doctrines do say that.  Some don't.  All are pretty agreed that it is an important part of the process, however.  2. If yes to the above, and I am hit by a bus tomorrow, does that mean what I think it means?  The best example we can refer to is the thief on the cross, who believed in Jesus and was saved.  He was not baptized, but Jesus told him that he would be in heaven with him.  3. Where and how should I be baptised? I started going to church recently. I sing and pray and listen to the sermons. But I didn't see any kind of ""pool."" Am I supposed to ask the pastor? Where and how would it be done? In front of the church during the service?! Or would he arrange something during the week? Would I have to pay?  Some churches do sprinkling (there is a bowl of water, and the pastor dips his hand in it and places it on your head); others do a full-immersion baptism (where you are submersed in a pool or a lake).  I'm... well, I'm what you might call a ""double dipper"" - I was sprinkled as an infant (which Lutherans do), but when I gave my heart to Jesus, I was in a Baptist church, and they believed in full immersion; so that's what happened.  My personal views are this:  Spiritually speaking, I think they can be equivalent.  But the experience of being fully immersed was really awesome, and (for me, at least) it gave me a deeper awareness that the old was gone and the new has come, than a sprinkling would have.    There's something subtly powerful that happens when a person is baptized - not only in that person, but in everybody present.  It's kind of hard to explain in words."

It's a cool experience to be outside in nature for such an important milestone, if you're into that, and most traditions are happy to perform such a baptism."

So even if you don't see it, they may still have one.  Others still have them in nearby storage because they can be large.   But as others have mentioned, it's a technicality. Jesus and John used rivers, lakes, and fountains (Edit: have to check on this one), but few churches are located near such bodies of water. So don't sweat it too much if a full immersion baptism isn't easily available."

I read that Jesus was baptized in l the river and that the bible said we were to be baptized so when the church I was attending suggested I get baptized I agreed. I was dunked in the Atlantic Ocean and the experience was amazing.

Christianity,3dy5jb,brennandunn,6,Mon Jul 20 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"""washed completely from my sin and was a new creation""  That implies regenerative baptism, right?

The best response I've heard to this is basically: ""We know that Jesus can make exceptions, but it isn't the best policy to ignore what seems to be a commandment and hope for an exception.""   Some churches do sprinkling (there is a bowl of water, and the pastor dips his hand in it and places it on your head); others do a full-immersion baptism (where you are submersed in a pool or a lake).   IIRC, the Greek word for baptism used in the NT isn't some special religious word but simply means immersion (like, to thoroughly wash something you baptizo it in water). However, by the time King James commissioned an English translation, sprinkling was the common practice. So rather than translate directly to the English word ""immerse"", which could become divisive, they simply Anglicized the Greek work baptizo so that the conflict didn't arise. This is secondhand and I am not a Greek scholar nor a historian, so I could be wrong."

Christianity,3dy5jb,Barunna_Ulfrbani,35,Tue Jul 21 13:17:13 2015 UTC,"So I've been a Christian for a while, and I still haven't been baptized yet, mostly because I'm in college and my family is currently in a lot of transition right now. Not really any excuse though... Honestly I wish I had done it earlier.   So baptism isn't something that you /need/ to do for your salvation. It's not the water that cleanses you, it's Christ. No matter what, remember that.   Baptism is sort of like a graduation ceremony. It's something you do to demonstrate to the public that you have changed something in your life. Being baptized doesn't determine you being in Christ any more than participating in a commencement ceremony would determine whether you earned a degree.   But say your father paid for your degree completely, so that you paid nothing. You still graduate with a degree at the end, whether you are part of the ceremony or not. But if your father said ""hey... I really would like to see you walk on that stage."" It would make sense for you to say ""absolutely, whatever you want.""   That's where baptism falls into place, for us. God wants to see us do it, but it won't impact whether we are saved or not.   Does that help?  Edit:  I would like to add to this briefly, because I realize I have come off as potentially allowing for breaking His commands.   My ideas of baptism come directly from my home church. They are a  nondenominational church that has made a habit of consulting the bible for answers to questions like these, not necessarily tradition. This isn't something they take lightly either.   Baptism is important for us to take part in because God has commanded it. But it is not, to me, a way that humans achieve salvation. Instead, we are to approach it with obedience and reverence for his laws. (I admit, I haven't done that yet, and that's between me and the Lord.)   My response is not regarding the question of ""should I do it?"" But rather the question of ""why should I do it?""  I do not believe that it is necessary for our salvation. I believe in the power of Jesus, and of Jesus alone for us to be saved. To me, saying that we must do something to be saved is too similar to the argument that Paul faced in his letter to the Galatians. They were getting caught up in thinking that even though they had Jesus, they needed to also obey his commands or they would not receive grace. Those were lies, as Paul explained. The way to salvation is not ""Jesus plus other stuff you do and say and have."" The way to salvation is ""simple Jesus.""   I truly believe that baptism is important, and it does pain me that I haven't done it yet. Maybe this thread is supposed to give me the push I need to do that, I don't know.   But I do know that regardless of my baptism status, I belong to God, and I am saved by Jesus, and I feel his Holy Spirit working to clean me from the inside out, and that his actions are infinitely more important than mine.   I also know that when I obey his commands, I am to do so with love for him and with reverence for his work, not out of fear that I am not good enough for him. Truth is, I'm not good enough for him, and I never could be, but he has given me new life, and the freedom to obey his commands for the right reasons. He has made me good enough for him, and now I wear his armor to fight to be closer in relationship to him daily."

He is the emeritus professor of philosophy at Oxford and wrote two books which played a major role in my conversion: Is There A God? and Was Jesus God? (Very highly recommended). And then I read that in 1996 he converted from Anglicanism to Eastern Orthodoxy.  As for me, I live abroad and, the only English service is offered by a Presbyterian church. I'm very happy to have that, and enjoy the service, but if I did have a complete array of Christian Churches in my back yard I think I would definitely incline towards either a Catholic or Orthodox Church.  Electric guitars and drums kits are fine, and its good to celebrate and rejoice in salvation (the Gospel means ""good news"" after all!) but speaking for myself a little more solemnity and seriousness would be welcome too and more in keeping with the inner feelings I have when I reflect on the sacred mysteries of Christianity."

Churches have split over such issues, to be sure, and it's really unfortunate.

I don't know enough about Catholicism to tell you what they believe.  Protestants believe that it's something a person is called to do once they believe.  That's not universal though, I think Salvation Army denomination doesn't baptize at all.  I personally believe that baptism was given as a gift to us to allow us to have an outward symbol to reflect the inner change in us. If it's a bus or any other motorized vehicle you're fine.  But a hot air balloon... I can't say for sure.  :) Some denominations have different traditions around what they do.  I think it's nice that if you are part of a church community to understand what their traditions are and go with them, provided it doesn't conflict with your understanding of it.  I would talk to the pastor of the church and discuss it with them.  They likely have a tradition they like to follow.  In my church it's very open to what you want.  I was baptized by a friend of mine in a river.  Someone read a verse that was important to me.  If anyone charges you for a baptism, I would leave that community immediately.   I wouldn't get hung up with the Protestant title.  That's the origins of the denominations and the name stuck but it's not something they currently involved in.  Hope this was helpful."

Here's what I'd say to your questions (full disclosure: I'm a Lutheran pastor):   Salvation depends on faith, not baptism. But your faith - which sounds firm right now the way you're talking - will find some shaky spots in the future. They may not even be that far off. When you doubt your faith, you'll wind up doubting your salvation. If you get baptised, you don't have to keep looking at yourself to see whether you have enough faith, because you'll have the promise: ""This water symbolises baptism... which now saves you."" (1 Peter 3). That's when you realise how your salvation does depend on your baptism, which is certain (because once it's done, you can't undo it) instead of your faith - which is also certain, but doesn't seem so to you all the time. It doesn't. Do things in the church, together with the other Christians. God didn't mean for us to do this alone. Ask the pastor. He knows what to do. No pool, no problem.

Christianity,3dy5jb,davidjricardo,5,Tue Jul 21 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"But... I don't know what Anglican means. I can't be a Protestant because I have no ""protest' against Catholicism. I had to look up the spelling of Presbyterian.   Protestant is (now) an umbrella term meaning not-Catholic and not-Orthodox. If you're not Protestant, its because you're in one of those other groups. In some sense, if you don't recognize the Pope as the ultimate authority of the Church, then you're a Protestant (... or Orthodox).  Anglican comes from Anglo-, meaning English. It's the Church of England and their established churches around the world. They tend to have elements of Protestantism and Catholicism (but are still ultimately Protestant), and are identified by their Common Worship as described in the Book of Common Prayer (in the native language... unless, ironically, your language is English in which case most churches use Early Modern English. The Episcopal Church is an exception.)  Presbyterian is a particular type of ""Reformed"" church (as in, holding generally to the theology of Calvin and some of his contemporaries). There are lots of different churches. You don't have to decide right away.    Does my salvation depend on baptism according to any Church doctrine? (I have a feeling Catholic and Orthodox Christians might think so).    Paedobaptist (infant-baptising) churches tend to say yes: Baptism is God's adopting you into his Church. It is the means by ehich he gives us the grace to believe, have faith, and be saved. There are caveats, though. Baptism is the normative means for receiving God's grace, but God is by no means restricted to act only through it. Sometimes you get theologies like Baptism by blood or desire (for those who die wanting to be baptised), or innocence of the ignorant (for those that never hear the Gospel, e.g. infants) that develop to deal with this sort of thing.  Credobaptist (""Believer's Baptism"") churches tend to say no--baptism is something we do to show our belief to the world. Sort of like a wedding ring. We're saved by our faith/belief, and baptism shows that off.   2. If yes to the above, and I am hit by a bus tomorrow, does that mean what I think it means?   Nope. See all those caveats.   3. Where and how should I be baptised? I started going to church recently. I sing and pray and listen to the sermons. But I didn't see any kind of ""pool."" Am I supposed to ask the pastor? Where and how would it be done? In front of the church during the service?! Or would he arrange something during the week? Would I have to pay?    ""Pools"" are a very Baptist (the denomination) thing. Some churches just sprinkle you. Some will dunk you in a river (or lake or whatever).  Yes, ask the pastor. (Although most denominations hold that any Christian may baptise, having a spiritual leader do so is pretty normal outside of emergencies).  Yes, in front of everyone (it's a cause of celebration!)  No, you wouldn't have to pay. I guess people essentially tip for weddings. Maybe you'd do something similar if you want? I've never heard of it."
Christianity,3dy5jb,ravensfreak0624,5,Mon Jul 20 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"The Catholic and Orthodox doctrine is essentially that baptism does something for you, but God isn't necessarily bound to those means of grace. cf the good thief on the cross. So while you're bound to get baptized eventually, you won't necessarily not be saved if you get hit by a bus.  As for when and how: in the Orthodox Church, this is how it works, and in many places it works the same. You say you want to join the Church (that is what baptism does, it joins you to the Body of Christ), you take some time to learn about the faith and make sure you want to really do it - this maybe takes about a year - and then you are baptized by immersion in a service that takes about forty-five minutes. The Catholic answer is much the same, though they have a formal and standardized program of catechism for adults called RCIA. In some other denominations it is also roughly the same - you take some time learning the fundamentals of the faith, make sure you're ready, then you get baptized, though the details of how the baptism happens varies. In some denominations, however, people get baptized, like, maybe immediately or with little education beforehand. These tend to be related to the Baptists.  As for where to go to Church, that's a complicated question. I of course always recommend the Orthodox Church, but that may not be where you think you want to be. With that said, CS Lewis has some advice in Mere Christianity about this. I would also say that, in the West, I think it behooves all Christians to have some familiarity with Catholicism, given that half of all Christians in the world are Catholic, so one should at least know why one isn't one if one isn't one."
Christianity,3dy5jb,McVegetable,4,Mon Jul 20 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"Protestants say no. Salvation is granted ""by grace, through faith"" and that baptism is a physical representation of that. It is the faith behind the baptism that matters. You should probably get to a hospital as quickly as possible and be prepared for extensive physical therapy. Talk to your pastor. Not all churches baptize by immersion, so the fount is smaller and stored somewhere out of the way in between baptisms. Some churches traditionally baptize infants, but very few will refuse to baptize an adult. My church, for example, practices infant baptism, but our youth group has really taken off and brought in a lot of people who had never grown up in the church over the past few years, and we gladly baptize them. We just baptized my good friend, who is 16, yesterday :)   Also as far as ""prostesting"" the Catholic church, don't worry about it too much. 94 of EDIT: Many of Martin Luther's 95 theses have been corrected or are no longer disputed by the Catholic Church. The only thing that remains that Luther objected to is having a Pope, which really isn't a big deal to most Protestants. At this point it's more of just a traditional name than an actual protest."

Christianity,3dy5jb,elsynkala,4,Tue Jul 21 04:49:31 2015 UTC,"I have been a Christian (been saved by Christ) since I was in 4th grade. I have never been baptized.  Recently, my husband (who was also never baptized but had been a god follower himself since childhood) and I wanted to become a member of our church. They ""required"" every member to be baptized by immersion.  I/We struggled for a few months regarding this. I didn't want to belong ot a church that said in order to be saved you needed to be baptized. It does not say that in the bible. I did not LIKE the idea of being a member of a church who had that wrong. There were a lot of meetings regarding this. It ended up that it wasn't so much a belief of your personal savation was tied to baptism, but to be a part of the church in regards to being a member, you should be baptized.   How I eventually came to think of it was that you can be fully committed to another human being in your heart. You can be ""married"" to them without ever being married in real life. Speaking of matters of the heart purely, if you never got married but were fully committed, that doesn't take away from the relationship. However, the physical act of marrying someone is the outward expression of the meaning of the relationship. It is tangible.  This is how I came to view baptism. If I was never baptized, that doesn't mean I am not committed to Christ, that doesn't mean I am not saved (my belief). But by becoming baptized, the promise I made to the Lord was physical and tangible, and my closest friends and family could share in the expression of faith with me.  I say all of this because I felt there was mixed views on baptism with regard to salvation. If baptism was REQUIRED for salvation, I have a feeling Jesus wouldn't have beaten around the bush with baptism, and would have straight up said ""one needs to be baptized in order to be saved"". If you find yourself also having this struggle, I hope my experience can help!"
Christianity,3dy5jb,vksays,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"the marriage analogy is really a good one because you can be married in your heart and recognized by God before the state/civil authority recognizes it.  The marriage ceremony (or baptism, in this case) is just the outward proclamation of what has already happened in your heart."

I didn't see how becoming baptized would change me when I was already living my faith. It was more the principal of the church ""needing"" me to be baptized versus the church saying that's how I was saved. It became something other than just the expression and I didn't want to do it with my heart in the wrong place or for the wrong reasons"
Christianity,3dy5jb,Penisdenapoleon,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see Catholicism represented so I thought I'd throw in my two cents.   No, your salvation does not depend on a) being baptized or b) which Church doctrine does the baptizing.  To say so would be limiting the power of God's grace.  God can save whomever he wills.  That being said, baptism is an outward, visible sign of God's grace and is an important step towards salvation. I think you already referenced the ""baptism by desire"" doctrine.  The short answer is ""we don't know.""  God does not reject souls.  Souls reject him.  So I guess it depends on the state of your soul.  Receiving God's grace through baptism is sign of God's cleansing your soul. A Catholic church would be a great place! If you approach a priest there he will enroll you in their adult initiation classes.  Before you get baptized, we'll want you to meet with a priest, ask questions, learn a little more about Christianity.  They'll have great, much more thorough answers to your questions above as well as many others I'm sure you have."
Christianity,3dy5jb,McVegetable,3,Mon Jul 20 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"Does my salvation depend on baptism according to any Church doctrine? (I have a feeling Catholic and Orthodox Christians might think so).   You said you believe in the Nicene Creed, which says, ""I believe in one baptism for the remission of sins"" - so, yes, we believe it is necessary. But, we also believe that salvation isn't just a ""switch"" that turns on at baptism.    If yes to the above, and I am hit by a bus tomorrow, does that mean what I think it means?   Orthodox and Catholics believe in a ""baptism of blood/desire."" If you die with the intention of being baptized, then you are considered baptized.    Where and how should I be baptised? I started going to church recently. I sing and pray and listen to the sermons. But I didn't see any kind of ""pool."" Am I supposed to ask the pastor? Where and how would it be done? In front of the church during the service?! Or would he arrange something during the week? Would I have to pay?   This is all highly dependent on what kind of church it is. I strongly recommend talking to the priest/pastor. (S)He'd be more than happy to help you!"
Christianity,3dy5jb,VerseBot,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the fold!   The important word here is Doctrine. Many Doctrines came about through man-made ideas and beliefs, so remember that before blindly believing what you hear or see, as it is your responsibility to study the Word of God to seek the truth. One general guideline is if Jesus explicitly stated to do something or did it himself, you should have faith in his guidance and follow. He is the Shepard after all.  Many people will remember the Thief that was crucified alongside Jesus. Jesus pardoned the man after the thief stated:  ""... he was saying, ""Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!""  (43)And He said to him, ""Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.""   Many use this to show how a person may get to heaven without the process of Baptism. Just remember the he is quite literally bearing his cross as he calls out to the lord."
Christianity,3dy5jb,Mysterious_Drifter,3,Mon Jul 20 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the family that is Christianity.  I'll try to answer your questions from a Presbyterian perspective, but no promises that I'm absolutely correct.   Baptism is more of an outward symbol than the point when one is saved. It is meant to officially welcome one as a Christian and ""wash away"" your old sinful life and introduce your new one. Because it isn't seen as the moment you are saved, it is very possible for someone to never be baptized and still be saved. That said, it's very highly recommended to still be baptized. In the PC(USA), your baptism would be during a Sunday service, as not only would it be your official welcome into the church, but the sacrament of baptism is also a wonderful form of worship and thus appropriate for the Lord's Day.   As an aside, don't feel like you have to actively protest the RCC to become Protestant; we don't exactly go around picketing Masses.  I hope these answers help! God bless you. M"
Christianity,3dy5jb,1000Colours,5,Mon Jul 20 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, in an important way, baptism saves you. But caution, do not understand baptism as a ritual that men do to show God their obedience. It is a sacrament whereby God bestows his grace on you. God is the agent in baptism, not men. [Colossians 2:11-12] [Titus 3:5]. For more verses saying that baptism saves, check out [Mark 1:4] [Mark 16:16] [Acts 2:38] [Acts 22:16] [Romans 6:1-5] [1 Peter 3:21]. Also, some churches will tell you that there are two baptisms, one by water and one by Spirit, but this is in contradiction to [Ephesians 4:5].  It is nevertheless possible to be saved without baptism. Baptism is meant for our benefit, to give us an objective way of knowing that we are saved. God's grace is not limited by the sacraments. The sacraments are the normal way for us to receive God's grace, but there can be extraordinary ways too. Just do not have contempt for the sacraments or refuse them, or you're in a dangerous area. Talk to your pastor. Some people have the wrong notion that baptism is a ""public declaration"", so such people will require you to be baptized in front of the congregation. You may be able to ask to be baptized in private if you prefer. The pastor should offer it freely, otherwise it would be the sin of simony.    Hope this helps!  /u/versebot"

I don't believe you're shipped off to hell if you haven't been baptised yet still believe.  I was a Christian my whole life (still am) and I never got baptised, yet my faith was still strong, just like it is today. Truth is it didn't make a magical difference for me, but it somewhat felt like I was like renewing vows, it was a reminder of my faith.  My youth church kept having baptisms often and a lot of my friends kept going except I never was really drawn to it (despite wanting to get baptised for the first time) and things kept popping up every time they happened, but I took a missions trip a few years ago to the Solomon Islands and got baptised in a river in a village that was hours away from the city. I believe God intended for me to wait until it was someplace special. I still have a heart for that place and wish to do some work there in the future, as it's now very special to me and I believe that's a God thing.  It's not the same for everyone but this was just how it was for me. So I'd say pray about and just let it happen, don't force it. If it's important to you, by all means go ask your pastor, even get baptised this weekend! But if you get a feeling to wait then do that, because He's got something better planned.  I wish the best for you and hope you discover more about your faith and God!"

They don't make it a requirement for salvation, and I don't think any church should. Baptism should be something you do because you've given your life to Christ and are wanting to strengthen your relationship with him, not something required to be saved."

The first one is a spiritual baptism that happens when you accept Christ as your savior.  This cleans you from your sin.  The second baptism is not required for salvation.  The second one is in water with a group of people around and is a way of publicly proclaiming that you are in-fact a follower of Christ.

I am not really clear on what Presbyterianism is (!) and that means I am not really clear on whether I should be baptised in a Presbyterian church.

Presbyterianism is a branch of Christianity that first developed in Scotland during the protestant Reformation and was influenced by John Calvin and John Knox.  Historically, Presbyterians have emphasized the sovereignty of God over all things, the authority of Scripture, on the need for disciplined holiness in personal Christian life.  Presbyterian beliefs are summarized in the Westminster Confession of Faith.  As with all Christian traditions, there can be a  range of beliefs from one congregation or denomination to the next.  Presbyterians practice both infant and adult baptism, generally by sprinkling or pouring.  If you have never been baptised I am sure they would be happy to baptise you.

But if you read Acts 8:26-40, you'll see a guy who was so new to the faith, that five minutes earlier he had never even heard of Jesus. He's in a foreign country too, just like you. He's looking for someone to explain the complexities of the faith, just as you are. And when he just sees some water by the side of the road, he asks, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?”     And the answer to that is that not only is there nothing to stand in the way, but God sends someone to do it, then caps that off with a miracle. So, when you're done reading what all the Philips of Reddit have written to help you, if you're still feeling uncertain and afraid you're doing it wrong, just remember that God honored the baptism of someone who was in a similar situation to yours and included it in Scripture."

Salvation only depends on two things:  Romans 10:9-10   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.  I am hit by a bus tomorrow   See above. Your faith is what saves you. Busses are irrelevant.   Where and how should I be baptised...   Many larger churches will have a baptistry, e.g. a pool they can lower you into. If you can't see it, it may be sort of hidden behind the altar. If they don't have one, you can literally be baptized anywhere (pool, lake, bathtub, whatever) by any other baptized believer.  If they do have a baptistry, then yes, ask the pastor or someone on staff. They will likely want to talk to you to make sure you understand your decision. They could do it the day you ask (that's how I did mine) or you could choose to wait until all the family is present. You can choose to do it during a service, or afterward privately.   You do not have to pay. Churches are thrilled to do baptisms.   And finally, while lack of baptism will not lock you out of heaven necessarily, I highly, highly recommend it. It is a profound experience, and is a sign of our obedience to God and his commands."

If you don't see a baptistery,  it may simply be because it's hidden under a floor, or behind some curtain, or as other's have pointed out, some churches practice and accept sprinkling.   Ask the minister.  Some churches also don't have a baptistery, but they will have a day when they go to another church, or a swimming pool and perform the baptism.    I saw many at 'Church Camp', where they would use the swimming pool or lake swimming area.  We've also had people from other churches who wanted to be immersed, come to our church, and of course we were happy to provide the baptistery in Jesus' name.        While I've been baptized multiple times, it depends upon your feelings.   But when you are mature in your faith and  immersed, you will feel a difference."

Since you bring up Anglican I'm guessing, correct me if I'm wrong that you are in England. Anglicans do not have a very large presence here in the US. Protestant is the term given to any one who is not a Roman Catholic. Presbyterians believe it is God's job to do the saving and making you more like Christ, believe God invites you and your (future) children in to a covenant (agreement with promises from God), and believe in church leadership that helps your spiritual development. Source: I'm a Presbyterian that came from a ""DIY"" faith background.    But I believe everything in the Nicene Creed. Perhaps I am a ""Mere Christian"" as described by C. S. Lewis.   Awesome.

Denominations are like different rooms in one house. Getting in one is helpful to your spiritual development.    Does my salvation depend on baptism according to any Church doctrine?

In front of the church during the service?! Or would he arrange something during the week? Would I have to pay?    Since you are going to a church asks your Pastor. They are good folks to talk with. Your church may or may not have a baptistery. Some churches dunk you under the water, some churches throw water on you, some poor water on you. It depends on what type of church you go to.   I want to know: What's the deal with baptism?   Most importantly is not the form or symbol of baptism but what it means. Baptism means you are publicly identifying with Christ. lt means you are dying to living for yourself and wanting to be a disciple of Jesus. Go to your pastor and talk with him/her.

Baptism has always to me been explained thusly: Baptism is an outward confession and confirmation of your inner change. So in a way nothing extra necessarily ""happens"" as a result of your baptism save for Other brothers and sisters in Christ being there to support and witness. As well as you sort of grow up to maybe being more than just a ""mere"" Christian.  Many churches don't do baptisms on a super regular basis. So their pools are sometimes brought out for the ceremony. or kept covered.  Sometimes you sign up for a baptism day. rather than a baptism just here and now.  In my experience most protestant churches require immersion baptism in order to become a volunteer or member, or at least have one that they do.

I feel the most important thing you can do right now for your faith is to find a good Bible (cover to cover) believing/preaching church (home) and start getting some guidance there.  A place to set roots and grow spiritually.   Baptism (while not required to get to heaven) is a public profession of faith which is a very good thing to do.   You're saved by God's grace and believing in His son Jesus died on the cross for your sins.  If you're truly saved you will notice a change in your life... You may start to feel convicted about some of the things you used to do or hang out with some of the friends you used to hang out with. That's the Holy Spirit.  But not to worry once you ask Christ to come into you life and you follow Him you are saved and God's grace is sufficient!  Don't worry about that bus. Your local church will best answer this one for you.  Most churches have an altar call at the end of the sermon to give people the opportunity to get saved, rededicate their lives to Christ, become a member and profess their faith and schedule their baptism.  Our church has a baptism pool behind the pulpit and they do the baptisms right before each service starts (but they are scheduled usually a few weeks in advance).  If they are charging run! :)"
Christianity,3dy5jb,kevincook,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"Welcome Brother.  Please let me know if I can do anything for you or if you have any questions.  With that being said, you are asking a question shrouded in mystery.  When people were to say they know the true doctrine of baptism, close to all of them are wrong.    But you must define your term of 'salvation'; its actually 3 stages: Justification(which you have experienced), Sanctification, and Glorification - these are successively revealed.  Your Justification is not dependent on any outside or physical action - it comes by faith.  However baptism is a physical act that you can take part in that has a spiritual base that connects you to all believers in YHWH in history - Noah in the flood, Moses at the Red Sea, Joshua in the Jordan, these are all 'baptisms'; the last of which John the Baptist refers to directly(Matt 3:19).  Also, note Johns cryptic answer to the Pharisees question(John 1:25); he insinuates water baptism is a path to baptism by fire. So don't be fooled by the ignorant who say water baptism is only a physical expression of identifying with Messiah.  Its a ritual Jewish Mikvah, where in the name of Yahshua you declare yourself once and for all time - 1) physically dead to your physical body by going under, 2) being cleansed by Him while under(John 1:1, Eph 5:26), and 3) being raised with Him from death by coming up out of the water(Rom 6:8).    Okay - so much for Baptism 101.  On to answering your questions:  1) No.  I think you are using the term here 'justification'.  Example, the thief on the cross story.  Jesus gave the thief full access to paradise - justification is all that is needed for this which is a free gift and takes no action on our part whatsoever outside of faith.    2) You are going to heaven.  But please, this is only the beginning.  3) Read Act 8:26-40.  So here Philip, an OG disciple solders up to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve of Ethiopia: ""Whatch a reading there?""  The Treasurer indicates he has no idea - but its a prophecy from Isaiah relating to Messiah.  So Philip start there, and walks through the Scripture, which at that time were only the Old Testament.  After this summary, the Treasurer says: ""There is some water over there...What is stopping me from getting baptized?""  So we dont know what discourse happened there; but we can extrapolate a few things by the conclusions: 1) Baptism is logical for an active belief in Messiah, 2) Its embedded in the Tanakh(Jewish scriptures - essentially the Old Testament), 3) Is required for advancement in the Kingdom, 4) Lead of the Holy Spirit, 5) Just add water.  Blessings on you my Brother.  I do not identify with any 'religion' - most likely the closest would be Messianic Judaism because I believe it to be the closest to the original spiritual walk Yahshua Moshiach instituted.  PM me for additional studies on this an every other subject.  I came back to faith after falling away due to a lack of knowledge - now I have amassed a vast wealth of programs which you are more than welcome to."

They THEN went and became baptized as a public statement of their belief.  Saying baptism is required for salvation is unbiblical. If it is required, you are adding works to salvation, which is heresy (Ephesians 2:7-8.)  All examples of biblical baptism were immersion. There are no examples of infant baptism or sprinkling.

Christianity,3dy5jb,ldpreload,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"Baptism is less about making a public proclamation of your own faith, and more about affirming what Christ has already done for you 2000 years ago, entering into his death and resurrection. It is more than symbolic, but it there is a spiritual death and resurrection that occurs sacramentally (which simply means something spiritual actually happens in the physical event). The means (immersion vs sprinkling, child vs adult) is irrelevant - it's God's work, not man's.  You don't need to protest anything today. The word ""protestant"" was from the 16th century when those leaders protested against Catholic teaching, primarily being saved by works and actions instead of by grace through faith. The Catholic Church today affirms salvation by grace, but that salvation by grace is evident and manifested in works as a result."
Christianity,3dy5jb,BeTheDrum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"What sort of church have you been attending?   But... I don't know what Anglican means.   Anglican means that it's a church which is connected somehow to the Church of England (or is the Church of England). There is no real centralized Anglican body, but most Anglican Churches belong to the Anglican Communion, which is essentially a cooperative of churches which is headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Anglican Churches may also be called Episcopal as well (for example, the Episcopal Church in the United States in America, also known as the ProtestantECUSA or simply The Episcopal Church, and the Scottish Episcopal Church). They take an approach of ""via media"", which is sort of middle-of-the-road, and a generalization can be made that Anglicans are reformed Catholics, and not quite Protestant in the standard sense.   I can't be a Protestant because I have no ""protest' against Catholicism.   Hating Catholicism isn't necessarily a requirement for being Protestant. It just describes a collection of churches that split from Rome and departed from Catholic practices.  Anyway, it varies by denomination, but baptism is usually considered the initiation into Christianity. The theology I was always taught is that when you are baptized, you die to sin and death and are ""born again,"" as it were, in the body of Christ.   Whether baptism is necessary for salvation or not is up for debate, but it is the standard starting point for Christianity, and, in many churches, you need to at least be baptized to receive Communion, to receive the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony, etc.  Practices vary. When you are baptized, you will probably be asked to make a commitment to God of some sort, to renounce the devil, et cetera (when an infant is baptized, its parents generally make the commitment in its stead and pledge to raise the child in the church and teach them to love God to the best of their ability. Then, the child may later make a mature commitment to the church, known as Confirmation). Depending on the church, you may be fully immersed or may simply be sprinkled.  Anyway, if you think you'll be at that church for a bit, talk to the Pastor/Priest about baptism and s/he'll tell you how to proceed. You may be asked to do some preparation, but maybe not.   If yes to the above, and I am hit by a bus tomorrow, does that mean what I think it means?   Unclear. However, there are provisions for emergency baptism in some denominations. In Anglican churches, for example, usually any baptized Christian can perform a baptism in case of an emergency, although it is preferably done by a Priest. Usually, if the baptized survives whatever emergency required such a baptism, some sort of ceremony is done by the Priest of the parish at the earliest opportunity."

As far as I can tell it's a symbolic thing, a) of declaring your faith before the church and b) having a way of showing your sins being washed away, but not in the actual blood of Jesus because that would be a) impossible [I mean, 2000 years?] and b) disgusting."

This is because the whole reason for baptism to symbolize that you are dying (and burying your old way of life), and, raising up into a new life. Buried and raised anew. As Romans 6:4 says this is what baptism is about. Sprinking doesn't quantify that. Having said that, people who are honest in heart and are sprinkled are going to heaven, because they are living up to the best of their understanding. But the whole symbology of burial of the old and resurrection of the new is entirely embodied in baptism by immersion and not by sprinkling."

Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity.  1261 As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: ""Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,"" allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.  ...  1281 Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all those who, without knowing of the Church but acting under the inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, can be saved even if they have not been baptized (cf. LG 16).  ...  1284 In case of necessity, any person can baptize provided that he have the intention of doing that which the Church does and provided that he pours water on the candidate's head while saying: ""I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.""   (Purgatory is not for the unbaptized; it is for the baptized, so they may be purified.)"

Christianity,3dy5jb,PixlProphet,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Hell of a couple of questions. Right on, though, and good on you for asking. Welcome!    Does my salvation depend on baptism according to any Church doctrine?    Your salvation does, looks like.   Though theoretically possible to be granted salvation absent the physical baptism, baptism does create the effect of salvation. You cannot be saved without this effect. In the case of those not baptized, this is ""the baptism of fire"" --- as in the martyred --- and ""the baptism of desire"" --- as in those who, through no fault of their own, are not baptized. Think pre-Columbian Amerindians.   However, you are capable of being baptized and aware of the question and of explicit faith in Christ Jesus, apparently. So hop on down to a parish and get baptized.    If yes to the above, and I am hit by a bus tomorrow, does that mean what I think it means?   See ""Baptism of desire,"" above. Still, you should not delay the process. God cannot be deceived.    Where and how should I be baptised?    Call up your local Catholic parish. :) They should help you out. Try to find a local parish affiliated with the FSSP or the Institute of Christ the King. (Where, generally, are you located? What state or country, and what region?) Lacking these, go to a regular parish. Avoid the SSPX."
Christianity,3dy5jb,Acetaminotaur,0,Tue Jul 21 02:06:41 2015 UTC,DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR. Pray and ask God to put in your heart His desire for you and baptism.  Baptism is a symbol of being born again.  In John chapter 3 Jesus is talking to Nicodemus. About how to become a Christian. He reveals that you need to be born of the Spirit.  Well baptism is a symbol of being born of the Spirit.  Baptism is not necessary for salvation. It is only a symbol of being born in the Spirit.

But this man has done nothing wrong.”  42 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.[d]”  43 Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” Luke 23:39-43   The second criminal was penitent (it takes a very humble and contrite heart to think that your deeds deserve death) and he asks Christ for forgiveness (""Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom"").   Jesus replies ""Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise."" So the man has not been baptized, but he is repentant and so Jesus grants him entry into heaven.

Any example should be a post-Commission example; before the Commission, Jesus took no part in baptising people.   We know that, as John the Baptist said, He is the one who baptises with the Holy Spirit. The focus should be on the passages going into the details of how salvation was bought for us, and was given to us. I believe you don't have to be baptised to go to heaven, but if you actively refuse baptism, you're refusing, at the very least, to identify with Christ's death and resurrection.  The Apostles seem greatly moved when the Holy Spirit comes upon the gentiles at Cornelius's house: “Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?”. Baptism in water was then performed after their response. Had they all fallen dead in this interim time, would they be hellbound? Peter talks of not being able to withhold baptism, not as though their being filled with the Holy Spirit was insufficient for salvation, but in recognition of God's acceptance of the gentiles into His kingdom."

We thus find here many of the great heroes, thinkers, and creative minds of ancient Greece and Rome as well as such medieval non-Christians as Saladin, Sultan of Egypt in the late twelfth century, and the great Islamic philosophers Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Averroës (Ibn Rushd).

I'm just raising that it's not as given as the OP suggests that baptism can be waved away because the people before Jesus made it to Heaven.  Some set of them did by extraordinary measure, but that sure feels more like an exception than the rule.  It is at least possible that the majority of people born before Jesus have never made it to Heaven, and thus the issue is plausibly unsettled."

It's interesting in Acts 19 we see a group of ""disciples"" who seem to have believed in Jesus and repented but had not yet even heard of the baptism of the Holy spirit (which is what the churches who require it for salvation would claim to be offering. Unless the baptism of John would have been just good enough maybe?). Would one of these men be kept from heaven if they had died before that point despite having become a follower of Christ? I don't think so, but I think you should absolutely be doing it as soon as possible after your salvation. There will be believers in extenuating circumstances however, where it literally may not be possible before the die (think third world countries as well) and I dont believe it would be held against you for all eternity due to that passage.

I don't believe it's a coincidence that in the verse I reference earlier, Paul states that the purpose of receiving the ""blessing of Abraham"" is to receive the Spirit, or that God said to Abraham that He is his ""exceedingly great reward"" (Gen 15:1).

Christianity,3e0dpd,AClegg1,3,Tue Jul 21 07:20:28 2015 UTC,"He died before Christ made his New Covenant with mankind. Now, many see see it as more of a 'symbolic' baptism. My pastor says that after people are saved, they 'want' or 'feel' they should be baptized. What's so wrong with it? There are many other religions with many other requirements before they can even be accepted.  God only ask for you to accept Him into your/their life. I have no answer on Baptism being necessary. I'm not in a pastoral position and I'm not well-educated in the Bible like they and the like are."
Christianity,3e0dpd,Dying_Daily,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:59 2015 UTC,"though this discussion is interesting, it may be interesting to try to clarify some things.   the first things that needs to be clarified is this: What is baptism? the best description I have heard on this is simply this: Baptism is an outward sign of an inward change.  in essence by getting baptized a person is saying that they have accepted the salvation that Jesus' offers, and that they are now a child of God; granted eternal life by the blood of Christ.     An example of this idea of salvation before baptism can be found in Acts: 16:25-34. Where the Philippian jailer was saved and a while later was baptized.  Another example is the Ethiopian, again who was baptized once he believed, and even Paul was baptized only after his conversion.   there are even more verses to show that baptism occurs AFTER salvation. This shows that in order to be saved, you do not have to be baptized (some denominations reject this idea, why I do not know....but that is discussion for another time).   the next thing that needs to be clarified is simply this: what is salvation? According to dictionary's salvation is this:  noun 1. the act of saving or protecting from harm, risk, loss, destruction, etc. 2. the state of being saved or protected from harm, risk, etc. 3. a source, cause, or means of being saved or protected from harm, risk, etc. 4. Theology. deliverance from the power and penalty of sin; redemption  Though all of the definitions are correct, it is the fourth definition that interests us at this time: the deliverance from the power and penalty of sin.  Romans 6:23 says it perfectly ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.""  So salvation is simply the act of accepting the gift that has already been paid for by the death of Christ.   Aha I hear you cry, but this whole discussion is about the thief on the cross, and the fact that you do not have to be baptized to go to heaven.  Yes it is, but to understand what I am about to say, we needed to clarify those two points, now we know what baptism is and what salvation is, let us look at the thief on the cross.   Luke 23:39-43 says this:  One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”  40 But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? 41 We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”  42 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”  43 Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”  Now Jesus tells the thief in v43 that he will be with Jesus in heaven. How can this be when the thief has not been baptized.   Well we can say several things here, things like ""Jesus is God, he can do anything!"", or as some of the other people here have said, the salvation of the thief occurred before the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.   However, there is another way of looking at this; that is through the bible itself. There are verses that say beyond a shadow of a doubt that only belief in the saving grace of God is all that is required to go to heaven, the clearest of them is over in Galatians 3:6-9 which says:  6 just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” 7 Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “In you all the nations shall be blessed.” 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.""  Abraham was never baptized, yet he ascended to heaven, why? Simply because of his faith. He accepted the freely given grace of God, the forgiveness of his sins and this was accounted unto him as righteousness (or being in the state of salvation/being saved).   You can say that this was before the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, yet that argument is in it's self flawed, for it predisposes the eternal nature of Christ, as evidenced in John 1:1 [quote]In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.[/quote]  This verse shows that Jesus was around at the very start of creation, and that nothing was made unless it was through him. This shows that Jesus was not only alive 2000 years ago, but actually existed at both the beginning of time and at the end of time (to prove this requires a working knowledge of ancient languages, primarily Greek.)  Sorry to ramble on, I am almost done.  To recap, Jesus has existed eternally, and existed in the time of Abraham. Abraham was saved and given redemption not because of his actions (Abraham was a bad man, read up on him sometime). Because Abraham believed in God's grace and salvation, because in essence he believed in Jesus, Abraham's salvation was assured. it is this very same belief that saved the thief on the cross, this very same belief saves people each day who are killed for expressing this very faith before they can be baptized.  Baptism is in essence nothing more than an outward expression of an inward life changing event. It is in effect a call that tells the whole world ""the old me is dead, I am reborn to new life"".    I am a baptist, if you asked me if baptism is important I would say ""definitely, but only to show the world that you have already changed on the inside.""  Sorry this is so long, did not mean it to be."
Christianity,3e0dpd,Dying_Daily,2,Tue Jul 21 03:20:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think I disagree with you. But just like Abraham, the Thief on the crosswas not required to be baptized as he was an old covenant member. So pointing out that he wasn't baptized yet he was save is not relevant. Maybe find someone in Acts who is said to go to Paradise but not been baptized. That would be a proof text. Not the Thief."

So when Peter commands to repent and be baptized in Acts 2:38, this is what he's referring to. It's not a new practice invented by the Apostles, or even John the Baptist. It's 100% Jewish in concept and scope!  If you're interested in learning more, David Stern's Jewish New Testament Commentary is a great resource."
Christianity,3dy6db,throwaway9928737,18,Mon Jul 20 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a Jewish practice. If it weren't, John the Baptist going out and baptizing people with a baptism of repentance wouldn't have made any sense to anyone. But to say that Christian baptism is a 100% Jewish practice is to ignore that the biblical authors consistently frame the baptism of Jesus as qualitatively different than that of John. See [Acts 19:1-7] for an example of this.  /u/VerseBot"

I personally don't see any evidence for a break in that continuity until well into the 2nd century, once the church became primarily Gentile.  In the Jewish context, ""baptism"" (better interpreted as ""immersion"") is a solo event - nobody dunked you, you went in the water by yourself. A witness was there to make sure you went all the way in, but they didn't participate otherwise. On top of that, immersion wasn't a one-time event. Every time you went to the temple, you immersed yourself as a sign of repentance. Every time you wanted to repent and declare yourself clean before God, you immersed. It was something that could happen quite frequently.  In the context of this thread, immersion was definitely not something administered to children or infants."

If I cannot instill in my child a natural love for brocooli/Jesus, if I cannot convince her of her need for broccoli/Jesus through good sense and modelling, if I cannot allow her the joy of receiving broccoli/Christ unto herself happily and willingly, what good will it do for me or her to go through the rituals? It will only breed resentment and misunderstanding of the beauty and loveliness of broccoli/Christ. No, the broccoli/Christ is a privilege, a blessing. It/He should never be wasted on a screaming person who rejects it/Him.   I foster love between myself and her. I show her immense respect and hopefully demonstrate wisdom and patience. And based on her love and respect for me she comes to know how I love brocooli/Christ, and is then drawn to the curiosity and mystery of the vegetable/faith.   Also, shit is good with cheese."

Christianity,3dy6db,Prof_Acorn,2,Tue Jul 21 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"I do see your point, especially with such a striking picture, and I understand that this perspective is pretty core to the Mennonite (Anabaptist) tradition.  In Eastern Orthodoxy, we place a lot of weight to Christ's insistence of allowing Children to come to him (Matthew 19:14). Children are included in nearly every part of our practice as adults. They stay in the sanctuary during service, take the eucharist, get baptized and chrismated, kiss icons, and so forth. So to us, it would seem counter to our practice to exclude them from something.  But again, I do understand the anabaptist position, and on a side note do find the larger Mennonite tradition the most appealing of the protestant denominations I explored before converting to Orthodoxy."

I mean, it's excellent to participate together instead of being stuck in a small room for mom's or something in some churches, or feel like one has to placate and keep them absolutely silent. I have heard a story from this sub about a small child running up to touch the....incense...thing.... and was encouraged to participate together. That is a lovely tradition. :)   On a personal note, I had a friend who was baptised as a child who later died in his youth when he was un-churched. I know it's a lot to hope, but that is one instance where I hope I am wrong."

Christianity,3dy6db,Chocobean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"It works beautifully, with respect and love. My kid doesn't get away with anything: she can choose to go to bed happily (for example) or she can choose to give up something she has such as TV time tomorrow or desserts tomorrow AND have the baby gate up and stuck in the room awake.   Expectations are always explained ahead of time (thou shalt not...thou shalt...), warnings and reminders given for last chances along with pending consequence (a way out for every temptation). Sometimes she will choose consequences (free will). Then she will cry and suffer sadly, and we sympathise and suffer with her and offer chances to earn lost privileges back (redemption). But most of the time is spent reinforcing that we love her, that everything we do make sense and has her advantage in mind. We started when she was super small when the stakes were super low: losing your spoon is fine we'll get it back, throwing your spoon you lose it.  Mom and dad always win. We are brick walls. But we do so in a way that is predictable 100% of the time, lovingly, and consequences are never dealt out in the moment of anger.   It's funny that people think respecting a child's choice means indulging and being soft and anarchy, when it is the opposite. It's ""everything is permissible"" in certain contexts but not everything is beneficial. We try to teach the ability to make good choices, as opposed to blind obedience when someone's looking.   With regards to infant baptism, I don't belittle it to the status of a WWJD bracelet, like a lifestyle symbol adults pick to look cool and fit in. I think highly of baptism as a spiritual mystery. And thats why I think it's a disservice to offer it to someone who has no ability to receive it willingly.   When my child was 2, we coached our child to willingly accept a vaccine. She had no illusion that there will be pain. She was scared. But she also accepted that it will be good for her and that it is important. She was able to work through many emotions and received something good for her willingly. And while that experience took way way way longer than lying to your kids and bribing with a lollipop after, it was a long lasting positive choice she made that she is proud of and can reference when she needs to face tough choices thereafter.  Infant baptism churches think we take baptism too lightly. I rather think it's the other way around."

Enforcing broccoli over candy requires an ideology that holds that pure pleasure should be moderated by long term health. It's not just assumed as ""truth"" in culture, as is apparent by the prevalence of poor diets, diabetes and obesity, smoking, and so forth.  Some parents will pass down the ideology that healthy food is better than junk food, others with pass along the ideology of capitalism, some will pass down the ideology of reciprocal ethics, some will pass down the ideology of skepticism, or the ideology of egalitarianism, naturalism, and so forth. Many of these ideologies have practices that manifest the beliefs held.  Parents who pass on the ideology of a particular religion are no more ""forcing"" it upon the children as those who pass down the other hundred ideologies that structure society.

For my own hypothetical children, I will definitely introduce them to a variety of paradigms when they come of age, but I will also present them the ones I hold to and suggest that I raised them in those beliefs and practices because I found them most valuable and wanted to share them as they grew up.  I'm sure we can agree that whatever the child chooses once of age, he won't really believe it until it becomes his own anyway.

Christianity,3dy6db,Chocobean,3,Mon Jul 20 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"The disagreement comes from our different understandings of baptism.  To you, baptism is likely a symbol to represent a choice you made.  To the Eastern Orthodox, baptism is a mystery - a mystical sacrament of spiritual healing - it is medicine to us, not a symbol of choice. If we have medicine, why not share that with our children?  This is why we also include children in the eucharist. We don't believe it's a ""symbol that represents something chosen through free will"" - it's a mystical and spiritual element with ""real"" presence - not merely symbolic."
Christianity,3dy6db,LuluThePanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think of the lords supper or baptism as merely symbolic either. I think there's something genuinely divine that we don't understand. Maybe a kind of brand on our soul? Maybe  a ward against the devils? Enhanced communication between us and the Holy Spirit? Something. Something good.   However, from the Bible it is very clear that the Lord works with our obedience. That there's something He enjoys when we lean on Him and not our understanding. That Love your lord and God is first of the ten commandments, and ritualistic behaviour like baptism, sacraments and church going are not among them. When I make broccoli/church an option that my three year old chooses from pure joy, I have set her on the path that will lead her down toward Love. Her desire for yet one more Bible story is more valuable than pretending to be good at Sunday school and raising her hand answering ""Jesus"" like I did as a child.   So I get it. It's very important to me not as a mere symbol either. She chooses to identify as Christian right now and has accepted a baptism that I offered as a game.....I would be happy to take her to a church that does childhood baptism, and I hope our ""home"" one counts on the mysterious level a little, even if the co-burial was done with blankets instead of water.

He or she should make a conscious decision whether or not to join a religious group when he or she becomes an adult.   You know that kids do this as they age right? By the time a person is an adult they can choose to affirm or deny their parents values which includes religion. It is ridiculous for you or anyone else to want to deny parents the right to not raise their children according to their beliefs and instead follow your beliefs. It is the decision of children to accept it or reject it as they age."
Christianity,3dy6db,mlbontbs87,-11,Mon Jul 20 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"I was baptised. Why?  I now consider it to have been abusive, ridiculous and useless. I told my parents about how I felt and they said they were sorry. However they did it because it was tradition, everyone else did it, and they didn't want me to be a pagan.   Putting water on a baby or dipping them in it is no more abusive than a bath.    It is abusive because you are forcefully putting a religious label on them before they can have a say in it. It has nothing to do with the concept of a bath.   It is ridiculous for you or anyone else to want to deny parents the right to not raise their children according to their beliefs and instead follow your beliefs. It is the decision of children to accept it or reject it as they age.   It is also ridiculous to force beliefs on your children just because they are your beliefs. It should be the decision of the parents to present the different beliefs and talk with their children, and not brainwash them into believing that their beliefs are the best, the truth and are infallible.  When I will have children, I will wait until they grow up to explain and show them the different religions, traditions so that they can make a conscious and informed decision."
Christianity,3dy6db,PrettyPoltergeist,10,Mon Jul 20 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"It is abusive because you are forcefully putting a religious label on them before they can have a say in it. It has nothing to do with the concept of a bath.   Yes, but as you grew you chose to reject it. That label has no more meaning than a bath now. Why? Because to you if you really are a pagan then the Christian concept of baptism is really nothing more than a bit of water just like a bath.   It is also ridiculous to force beliefs on your children just because they are your beliefs.    They are your children and for nearly two decades they live with you. How can parents that love their children not share part of what makes up a large part of their identity? Also if they believe the central tenant of their faith is to make disciples of Jesus then how could they not want to start that process for children?   This is what Jesus said: ""Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (in Matthew 28:19-20).   Let's put it like this. Your parents believed that you are an eternal being. They believe that your eternal destiny is in part based on  their upbringing of you. It would be inconsistent if they did not baptize you. They are not forcing anything on you except that while you are under their care to be be part of their cultural identity. You can accept or reject it as you see fit. You did.   When I will have children, I will wait until they grow up to explain and show them the different religions, traditions so that they can make a conscious and informed decision.   You will be giving them your culture of non-belief. You will not be taking them to religious groups. So you will be giving them a default of no affiliation which as a parent is your tradition and thus will be theirs. But what if they turn six or seven and go to a church service with their grandparents and want to be become Christians and be baptized? Will you start carrying them? Will you make it easy for them to go? In likelihood, you wouldn't because you personally don't see a value in it. Again it comes down to your right as a parent for better or worse your children are effected by your values as a parent."
Christianity,3dy6db,ImprovingKodiak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"And others would say that it is wrong not to, because if the child dies before it is old enough to make the decision and be baptised, it's in a sticky situation theologically, depending on your denomination.  Baptism isn't like a life long subscription where the emails don't have an unsubscribe button. If a child is baptised as an infant, and they grow up to be an atheist or belonging to another religion, the baptism means nothing. It's just a bath with an audience. But if the child does grow up to be a Christian, it's not a problem."

Christianity,3e0flk,pinkunicorn53,5,Tue Jul 21 12:18:14 2015 UTC,"I'm an atheist.  I used to be a Christian.  When I was dating, I did meet this christian woman who took her religion very seriously.  We went on a few dates and got along very well.  She liked me.   I do respect women and wanted (and have now) a good, solid, monogamous relationship.   But I knew that ultimately, the kind of values she wanted, I didn't have.  I wasn't going to be the guy sitting around a prayer group all the time, or agonizing over sexual urges, or dancing in the isles with my arms raised.  I'd been there, and I feel like I'm freed from what I now think of as superstitions.  (but I do remember what it felt like to have those beliefs)  So I broke it off with this girl.  She was sad, but, I wasn't going to be ok with having a pure relationship for years while we waited to marry, and she was going to feel terrible if she gave in and we took things to the next level.  I didn't want to do that to either one of us, so, I broke it off early, as soon as I realized that one of us would likely get hurt or have to radically change our values.  She was sad but I felt like it was the respectful thing to do.   She seemed like a good person and I didn't want to drag things out for years, fall in love, and then have one or both of us really get hurt.  If you have strong faith and want to find someone similar, you're right to try to stick to your guns.  Please remember though, that faith tends to get stronger and weaker through life, so, you might meet someone who at some point has stronger faith than you, or weaker, and if you make a family commitment, I hope that you'll honor your promises to God even if it doesn't feel like you're equally yoked the entire time.  Best of luck in your search.  You'll find someone.   Just put yourself out there on dating sites and keep dating enough until you get the results you want.  If the guy you want is 1 out of 100, you might have to go on 200 dates to find him.   That's ok.  Have fun.  Dating can be a fun journey.   Just get it in your mind that whatever happens, you'll laugh and have a good time, and another life experience, and, before you know it, you'll be with a guy you want to keep."

It takes a long time to truly get to know someone and each time it gets harder to make that effort. Haven't given up yet though!
Christianity,3e0flk,PlayOrGetPlayed,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"I share the same with you OP. I love Jesus and I just make sure conversation never goes down the route where attraction can be initiated by any girls.   Recently have met a girl that is really smart and we have become great friends at work and although she claims to be a Christian she isnt really into it. I just can't enter a relationship like that unless she lived for relationship with our Father. But how great it is if your wife is also your best friend like this girl is...   Regardless I know the devil has thrown a lot of things that way that God is making me overcome. God has blessed me with good looks but it's funny because I'm waiting till marriage and I honestly don't care about looks of the opposite gender, I'm so into personality. The temptations still come but I don't play around in conversation which is always the most powerful tool of all. If you say no to flirty stuff and show clear disinterest for anything intimate it's great that people don't move in and try anything else. Most of all it saves you from deeper temptation.   I know God has a partner ready, it's best to just overcome every obstacle to get there."

The Christian guys I'm attracted to are married. The Christian guys who are available are unattractive to me. Past experience of dating non-Christians has made me determined to find a Christian man. However, it feels like searching for a needle in a haystack!  I recently read this book, written by a connection of mine, which inspired me and gave me hope: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-Out-There-Stories-Single-ebook/dp/B00UUZO30I (It says for single women over 30, but I'm also in my 20s)  At the same time, I've been pushing into trusting God more with my life and asking him to prepare the right guy for me.

As far as your thought, it sounds an awful lot like missionary dating, which is usually doomed to fail. I mean if he stumbled into a church one day and was compelled by the gospel message and decided to follow Christ, and some time later met and dated a Christian girl then that's one thing. But going to church to meet women and converting along the way doesn't sound very convincing.  If the shoe were on the other foot and a girl did that and we started talking, I'm not sure I would be interested in her because I would question whether her conversion was authentic or just a tactic."

Not saying this is definitely the problem, but something that is almost always valuable is to think about is what it is that is attractive to you about non Christians that you don't find as easily in Christians. Personally I've found it's pretty easy for cultural values to slip in unexamined in my preferences for romantic partners, and it's been a slow process of challenging those preferences and bringing them in line my values and what God wants for me.  One example is confidence, which is something a lot of people find attractive, but many Christians are actually working to suppress as a side effect of dealing with the sin of pride. Yes, it is possible to be confident and not prideful, but it's not something that comes naturally to people, and often we choose unwisely between having both or having neither."

Regardless, just cultivate good friendships with them, building it up where you can by relying on them for small things and being present to help them when you can; I've found this has alleviated my loneliness (obviously not completely), knowing that my friends of both genders care about me. This won't work if you go in looking for a romantic relationship though; essentially, to help alleviate the pains you're going through, rely on friends who care about you as friends, and enjoy that comradeship."

Such as she must start having baby by next year so she will have time to have a second baby before she gets too old. Telling her the Lord will provide a baby at a suitable time doesnt work.

But nobody argued that. What I was arguing is that the national furvor against gay people is more recent and not as deeply rooted as the ""We hate the federal government"" strand. That's at least as old as the Civil War, and probably older. The US has a serious boner for resisting institutional authority; wanting to ""fight the man"" is almost always seen as virtuous, or at the very least sane and rational, even if it really isn't (hippies, private militias, etc.)   LGBT people are murdered for who they are ALL THE TIME.   Not really, no. In 2014, somewhere between 20-25 GLBT people were killed in the US, and these were homicides not murders, so if a gay person was, for example, trying to steal money for drugs and got killed in the attempt, or run over by a drunk driver, they'd make that list. In contrast, 14,800 people were murdered (homicide rate would be much, much higher) in the US in 2013. If we assume (none of this is true, but it's convenient for math purposes) that all races and genders and income levels are murdered about equally, and that queer people were murdered in proportion to their demographic in the general population, we'd expect the number of queer people murdered to be, at a bare minimum, something like 444 (if 3% of the population is GLBT), which is at least 18 times higher than it is. Conclusion: GLBT people are not really murdered ""all the time,"" unless by extension, several demographics of people are being murdered ""all the time, and far more frequently than GLBT people."""

Christianity,3dyhx6,WaterPokemon,9,Tue Jul 21 02:35:52 2015 UTC,"The question was what verses were used in support for their position, not whether or now they were good reasons or not.  I think all references of homosexuality in the bible were referring to things that were homosexual in nature but also rape, or pederasty, or temple worship. So, naturally, if the only experience with homosexuality was in the context of worship, rape, and pederasty, you'd make a blanket statement against all of it.  It's a view of Scripture which is significantly different than thinking God hand wrote the bible. So that's an obvious difference."
Christianity,3dyhx6,wildgwest,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"So you admit it's different, yet happily lump those that oppose gay marriage with those who opposed interracial marriage. Hmmm.    rape, or pederasty, or temple worship.   You can only come to those conclusions by adding to the bible AND making assumptions based on secular history. Just because there was a lot of pederasty in those times doesn't mean there wasn't other types of homosexuality happening and it also doesn't mean that the scriptures are limited to that.   My favorite one is Romans 1:24-26. They say the context of this refers to pederasty. Too bad it mentions women with women too right?  Also, That scripture is referring to the time since the fall of man. Paul certainly didn't limit it to his day, but many try to make his words fit that. Jude affirms this kind of view in verse 7. Sodom and gomorra's sexual immorality certainly wasn't to do with the culture in christ's time.    It's a view of Scripture which is significantly different than thinking God hand wrote the bible.   If you don't consider it to be the infallible word of God, why screw with it to justify something it clearly doesn't? Your answer should be ""It's not %100 reliable"" as opposed to ""I'm going to change what this book says to suit me, even though it's not even the authority on the issue"". Why do that?"

Romans can be about temple worship too. Not all instances of anti homosexuality is talking about all the immoral cases I described.

The Apostolic Churches have never argued against nor prohibited interracial marriages (at least on a church wide level; there have been individual priests with prejudices). Russian and Greeks, at least on the aristocratic level, intermarried. You probably didn't see too many intermarrying peasants because of travel and geography, save for the borders. And yes, both are white, but you probably didn't see black/white marriages then because Africa is kind of far from Greece/Russia, and besides, the number of Orthodox Christians from those areas are scant. There are the Ethiopians, but they were thought to be heretical until the theological dialogues in the 20th century.  I don't see any evidence that the Apostolic Churches, as Churches themselves, at any rate (to say nothing of the opinions of individuals in the clergy), ever opposed interracial marriage, or for that matter, supported same sex marriage."

However, this is when it gets dicy between the beliefs held by ""the church"" vs ""people within the church"". I'm sure there were individual catholics and orthodox who were against interracial marriage, when there was no official stance by the church at large. So while there may not be an overarching ban, racism may have crept in regardless because of prevailing cultural attitudes.   My point was mostly ""those people who used the arguments in the past"", rather than specifically targeting certain denominations. The arguments made are almost identical, while the people making the arguments may be different."
Christianity,3dyhx6,wildgwest,10,Mon Jul 20 17:12:52 2015 UTC,"However, this is when it gets dicy between the beliefs held by ""the church"" vs ""people within the church"". I'm sure there were individual catholics and orthodox who were against interracial marriage, when there was no official stance by the church at large. So while there may not be an overarching ban, racism may have crept in regardless because of prevailing cultural attitudes.   Yes, as I said, I believe there were actually priests who denied marriages because of their own personal biases. I heard of a Greek priest that refused to do a marriage because the guy wasn't Greek. Never verified it but I wouldn't be surprised. But again, we're talking about a situation rather unique to America (not that banning interracial marriage is exclusive to America, but the arguments and the history of dealing with interracial marriage and then gay marriage). Lots of Churches were pro segregation in the 60s, and their arguments weren't too dissimilar. But the Orthodox Church clearly and explicitly condemned racism in 1872, not to say they condoned racism before that, but rather they were upholding the unchanging tradition in a new scenario, namely, nationalists trying to establish a Church exclusive to a particular ethnicity.  I'm just saying, this all only pertains to a particularly American context. There are similarities in some of the arguments, yes. Though it's tough for me to imagine people saying ""interracial relations are ok, it's just the sex that's the issue"". Whereas the gay marriage thing can come down to a question about the sex itself, there's no analogous argument anti-interracial marriage advocates could make. Without any tradition to stand on, it basically comes down to racism. While not affirming gay marriage certainly can be motivated by prejudice, I do not believe it is necessarily motivated by prejudice. At least in the context of Holy Matrimony. Civil marriages are a different story. And this post is primarily about Civil marriages, so I guess that's fine. But sometimes they're conflated or go hand in hand.  On the flip side, while many Protestant churches now ordain women, Apostolic Churches continue to not ordain women to the priesthood. Ordination to the diaconate and lower orders, on the other hand, has historical precedent and is being carried out by some members of the Oriental Orthodox. That's mostly another issue, in that it, as of present, lacks the legal component that same sex marriage does. But if you frame the question as ""Can genders be considered arbitrary with regards to these sacraments?"", then you have a thin parallel."

First, It was ordained for the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praise of his holy Name.    Secondly, It was ordained for a remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication; that such persons as have not the gift of continency might marry, and keep themselves undefiled members of Christ's body.    Thirdly, It was ordained for the mutual society, help, and comfort, that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity.

Only a small percentage of the population are constitutional scholars. A slightly larger number has the educational background to understand the ruling.   But we do have an innate sense of the fairness, of justice, and of equality; and people believe that the constitution stands for those same values. It's those values that drive our support for same sex marriage, as well as our compassion for our fellow humans, too long denied equality. We agree with the ruling because we believe the constitution is meant to ensure equality and fairness. We support same sex marriage because of our compassion.

Bans on race mixing are, in fact harder on them than they are on whites.  There's the obvious bit about the dating pool being arbitrarily restricted, but that's not what I'm most interested in.  During the time that race mixing was a topical issue, almost everyone in a position of wealth or power was white, and the average white person was much more well off than the average black person.  Because of this, a black person could reasonably expect that their financial well-being would improve if they married into a white family.  Removing that means that individual black folk have one less vector for social mobility (marriage) than white folk do.    Thinking about this reminds me of the absurd argument of ""there's no discrimination, nobody of any orientation is allowed to marry the same sex!"", when it's obvious that homosexuals are disadvantaged by the ban while heterosexuals are unaffected."

Christianity,3dyhx6,Tigerfluff23,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"As usual, there is a lot of confusion surrounding the Supreme Court cases. Like in other cases, there are two issues in play:    People can agree or disagree with the actual issue being debated. For example, people can agree or disagree that same sex marriage should be legal. People can agree or disagree with how the issue is resolved. For example, people can agree or disagree if the constitution speaks to the issue of same sex marriage.   Here's a less emotional example: Imagine a group of 10 students is in charge of deciding where the senior class will go on their end of the year field trip. 5 want to go to the beach. 5 want to go to an amusement park. After debating this for a few weeks, all 10 agree that progress is being made, and all 10 say that they are optimistic that they will come to an agreement (even though not all students will like the outcome). Then, during a meeting of the 10 students, the principal storms into the room says the debate is over and that the senior class is going to an amusement park.   So, given the above, there are 4 possible reactions:   like the destination, like the fact that the principal made the decision like the destination, dislike the fact that the principal made the decision dislike the destination, like the fact that the principal made the decision dislike the destination, dislike the fact that the principal made the decision   Make sense? So likewise, there are people who are in favor of same sex marriage but who don't think the supreme court's decision was correct. In general, people who think that the Supreme Court's decision was based on the Constitution are fans the of the idea of the ""living constitution"", while folks who disagree the legal nature of the decision oppose the idea of the ""living constitution"".   It seem that a lot of people are unaware of the above, as evident by the posters here who have already assumed that anyone who opposes the decision is anti-same sex marriage."

Christianity,3dyhx6,selorn,-3,Mon Jul 20 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then why does the 13th amendment exist? If equality is not up to a vote, then why did the people at that time decide that they needed to amend the constitution to outlaw slavery?   Why does the 15th amendment exist? Couldn't they give minorities the right to vote without changing the constitution? Or the 19th? Certainly by that time they could have read the constitution and decided that there was a theme of inclusion and just given women the right to vote? But they didn't, they went through the process of changing the constitution to allow it.    The constitution is NOT bound by the ideologies of its framers, but by its text   When you say that we are constrained by the text, there really isn't such a thing, as anyone will have their interpretation. It's like Conservative Christians saying they rely on only the Bible, when the reality is that they rely on their interpretation of the Bible. So we do rely on interpretations, that's a given, so the question is what kinds of interpretations should be used. Do we try to determine the original intent of the law? Or do we read it any way we wish, and put into it any meaning we choose? If we do the latter, then does it matter if the members of the Supreme Court know anything about law? Doesn't it just become another political position at that point? (speaking of that possibility, did you know that Justice Sotomayor stated that the constitution said nothing about same sex marriage before she she become a Supreme Court Justice and discovered that it did?)  By the way, there was also a recent decision on the ACA. It was decided that people on the federal exchange could indeed qualify for subsidies. The challenge was based on the a phrase in the law: ""established by the state"". Defenders who won the arguments based their position on the intent and purpose of the law. So in this case, the progressives didn't try to argue that the phrase could mean anything, they argued from a position of original intent."

The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. [26] So too the second and third, down to the seventh. [27] After them all, the woman died. [28] In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.” [29] But Jesus answered them, “You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. [30] For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. [31] And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: [32] ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.” [33] And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.    Romans 7:2 | English Standard Version (ESV)   [2] For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage.

So people did remarry quite a bit.  Maybe your brother's wife had 3 kids... and he died, so you marry her to help take care of the kids... then she dies birthing your second child... and you remarry.

Geez, I'm a nerd.

Their service was incredibly showy--- 20 minutes of performance music by a band, 20 minutes of a non-seminary educated worship leader talking, a short prayer and 20 more minutes of performance music by the band. We told them they didn't have to change much, they only had to include a confession and pardon and regularly celebrate the sacraments.

I know way to many new pastors who just feel like it is unnecessary to put a corporate prayer into the service. In my mind, the prayer of Confession/assurance of pardon is one of the most beautiful parts of the service. And a great reminder that all of us have fallen short."
