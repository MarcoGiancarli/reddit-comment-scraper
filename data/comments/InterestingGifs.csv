The tribe definitely was touristy, but my wife (who's Thai) wanted to see them, so we did that while out and about (it's very near the tiger place). I really love Chiang Mai though, and would love to go back. We'll be back in Thailand April 11th-28th, currently with a pretty open itinerary minus Khon Kaen during songkran, but I'm looking at Chiang Rai and Hua Hin as new places to visit during this trip, and bouncing around south Thailand.

If you haven't been for Songkran, it's a great time to visit the country. My first time in Thailand was to visit my now wife in 2012 - we became good pen pals over two years and I bit the bullet and flew out there to meet up with her and go backpacking throughout the country (and Hong Kong). We've since married last February and I'm excited to be back for Songkran. I've never seen so many smiling faces - it melts my heart.

After the day job and all of my other obligations I don't have the desire to fire up my Thai learning apps on my phone. Her dad passed away in September and he was the last person that could speak English decently well, so I'm scared of something happening to her and not being able to communicate with her family.   So are you currently in Chiang Mai? Have you made it up to Chiang Rai or Pai? If so, worth the trip? The temples at Rai look awesome, and I know Pai is on the Mae Hong Song loop, but that's about all I know about it (oh, and they have a natural water slide during the dry season). I, however, have zero hours on a motorcycle, so I'd a bit out of my element regarding taking the loop! Would need a lot of cheap Thai whiskey or all of that most delicious Thai beer (/s).   My wife is planning a day trip to Vientiane, Laos for us falang, so that'll be a new experience (I've never been to Laos, but I did see it from Chiang Khan:))"

InterestingGifs,2q0ci6,WileEPeyote,2,Fri Jan 2 21:22:31 2015 UTC,"Balisong blades are usually only sharp on one side, which faces the handle with the latch connected to it (called the bite handle). The most basic flip I can think of is where you hold the safe handle, flip it open so the bite handle rests on the back of your hand. Then you turn the safe handle in your hand and flip it closed. Blade open, looks way fancier than it is when done quickly. Repeat to close."

Yeah, this is the one I am used to - with the addition of spinning it so that it closes all the way. The next top comment down is the one I was thinking of."

Any time that you can use touch (on a virtual element, or the keyboard) instead of the mouse, you can usually work faster.  I sometimes use the Jump VNC Android app to make my Nexus 10 as the keyboard, and remote into my desktop computer.  Therefore, I have a tiny bit of experience with interacting with my desktop from a touch interface because of using a VNC program.  As you can imagine, interacting can be more difficult because the Nexus 10 screen size is relatively small, and I’m using touch to indirectly touch a desktop that has a non-touch UI.  However, when you are able to touch, it’s usually faster than using a mouse."

InterestingGifs,2et9v1,Steinrik,4,Thu Aug 28 16:06:03 2014 UTC,From Youtube comments:  INFORMATION COURTESY OF TOM SANDERS: This is an S-2E from VS-38 off Calif. coast in 1971 onboard USS Ticonderoga CVS-14. Aircraft had pilot and copilot hatches open when rogue wave came up over bow at end of catapult shot. AC was able to recover a few feet off the surface and fly back to San Diego. The﻿ inside of the AC was soaked with salt water and was later taken out of service. Pilot was LCDR Guy Wilcox. I was squadron LSO and observed launch from the LSO platform on the rear port side flight deck of ship. Tom Sanders  Add'l info added 4/23/08 aircraft ID'd as S2 Tracker. video was sent to me a couple years ago in an email - looked like a scary takeoff to me...but at least ultimately successful?

Those bubbles are not air from the combustion and expansion of the gunpowder, but rather VACUUM caused by the water rushing away from the path of the bullet so quickly that it rips itself apart. It's called cavitation.  So as the water creates those big vacuum pockets it slows down, reverses direction and slams back together. In fact, I would say that those look about as dangerous as the bullet itself! Cavitation destroys the alloy steel of ship propellers and is used to break thing like kidney stones.

InterestingGifs,269dav,Beau_Daniel,2,Fri May 23 05:35:15 2014 UTC,I have no idea for sure but it does look like Styrofoam. Here is the link to the actual video. Although they never say what they are levitating. Later in the video they do it with a clear liquid.   bonus info  A pharmaceutical company is researching this technology so that they can evaporate a solution with out touching it. When  a solution evaporates while touching a vessel it becomes crystalline. Most pharmaceuticals are in a crystallized structure and the body has a hard time breaking down/adsorbing the crystals because of the stability of the structure. An amorphous state (basically not in a crystal state) is easily adsorbed by the body and requires less of the drug to have a therapeutic benefit. The result of this is the reduction of side effects. source

Technically, because no melt occurs, friction welding is not actually a welding process in the traditional sense, but a forging technique. However, due to the similarities between these techniques and traditional welding, the term has become common. Friction welding is used with metals and thermoplastics in a wide variety of aviation and automotive applications.

An induction heater (for any process) consists of an electromagnet, through which a high-frequency alternating current (AC) is passed. Heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses in materials that have significant relative permeability. The frequency of AC used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.

Thus, it has parents with the same genus but of different species. It is distinct from the similar hybrid tigon. It is the largest of all known extant felines.    Ligers enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Ligers exist only in captivity because the habitats of the parental species do not overlap in the wild. Historically, when the Asiatic Lion was prolific, the territories of lions and tigers did overlap and there are legends of ligers existing in the wild. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons which tend to be about as large as a female tiger and is the cross between a male tiger and a lioness.

InterestingGifs,1zfgqm,morganational,1 point,Mon Mar 3 13:14:46 2014 UTC,"It's a milling cutter for metal, and it cuts... metal.  It's an engineering tool used for very precise cutting of metal surfaces - imagine a drill bit that can be used to cut metal from the side instead of from above - to cut a groove, for example."
InterestingGifs,1zfgqm,NotSureOfName,1 point,Mon Mar 3 19:56:07 2014 UTC,"It's an indexable end mill. Most end mills look kind of like a drill bit with a flat tip. If you've got a large plate of steel (what the end mill is cutting in the GIF) that you need to machine down to a certain thickness or flatness, this is the way to do it. If it's indexable, it means that instead of just being a drill bit, it's got little carbide inserts that can be easily changed out to give you a new cutting edge, instead of either a) sharpening the end mill like a drill bit, or b) buying a new one. It's more money up front, but saves cash in the long run. The inserts on this end mill are 8 sided, so when the cutting edges get worn, you take them loose and rotate them to give you a new cutting edge. Really cool stuff."

InterestingGifs,1z92eh,ky87,11,Sat Mar 1 10:35:30 2014 UTC,It's very good because it messes with the batters' timing and rhythm.  It's also called a change-up pitch...
InterestingGifs,1z92eh,WeAreWonderfulNow,5,Sat Mar 1 10:51:44 2014 UTC,"Changeup:       A changeup is a type of pitch in baseball. The changeup is the staple off-speed pitch, usually thrown to look like a fastball but arriving much slower to the plate. Its reduced speed coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter's timing. It is meant to be thrown the same as a fastball, but simply farther back in the hand, which makes it release from the hand slower but still retaining the look of a fastball. A changeup is generally thrown 8–15 miles per hour slower than a fastball. If thrown correctly, the changeup will confuse the batter because the human eye cannot discern that the ball is coming significantly slower until it is around 30 feet from the plate. [(http://en.wikipedia.org//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup#endnote_changeup4) For example, a batter swings at the ball as if it was a 90 mph fastball but it is coming at 75 mph which means he is swinging too early to hit the ball well, making the changeup very effective.

The delivery from the pitcher has very low velocity and usually catches the hitter off-guard. Its invention is attributed to Rip Sewell of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1940s. According to manager Frankie Frisch, the pitch was named by outfielder Maurice Van Robays. When asked what it meant, Van Robays replied, ""'Eephus ain't nothing, and that's a nothing pitch."" Although the origin is not known for certain, Eephus may come from the Hebrew word אפס (pronounced ""EFF-ess""), meaning ""nothing"".

Like /u/DingDongSeven says, it's a ""uniform motion to a non-uniform motion"" (constant turning speed on one gear, becomes variable speed on the other end). So, you can crank one gear, which may turn several others, of different sizes, which translate to different periods.  Then the targets pop up at different intervals, but when they pop up, they are also going at different speeds when they're visible (fast coming up and going down, slow as they are not shown)."

InterestingGifs,1nq44f,Bringlogic,1 point,Thu Nov 7 18:23:23 2013 UTC,The bottoms which sprouted show the area in the rectangle which has been lost. Im sure if you measured the area of the 'sprouted' bottoms would be equal to the area of the one square which was removed.

InterestingGifs,1nq44f,FriedGold9k,1 point,Sat Oct 5 06:21:53 2013 UTC,"Watch the whole gif. Watch it loop from the cut down 4x6 back to the full 4x6 bar.  You can also see when it loops back that it lost some height.  Now watch the row where the cut is made.  Basically, each of 4 single sections loses 1/4 of its height.  This is due to the loss of 1 single section."
