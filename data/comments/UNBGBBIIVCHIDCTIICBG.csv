UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3dwt3g,oxygenjoe,3,Mon Jul 20 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"They aren't really, though. It's the same question either way, which is ""do I determine the probability of the flip by looking at this from the perspective of the coin or from the perspective of Sleeping Beauty?""  From the coin's perspective, it has a 1/2 chance of coming up heads or tails no matter who's flipping it or who's being asked. From her perspective, she will be asked this question twice if it comes up tails and only once if it comes up heads, therefore if she is being asked the question, the coin has only one chance out of three to be heads.  Let's look at this another way - Let's say that  you're writing a software function that doesn't know anything about the outside world (no inputs), but you do know that half the time the function will be called only once and the other half it will be called twice (you don't know how this is decided, and anything written by the function to memory is cleared between calls). Given an arbitrary call to this function, what are the odds that the calling process needs to call it only once this time around? If you take the point of view of your function, you can predict that there will be no preceeding or succeeding calls only one third of the time. If you're taking the point of view of the process calling it (like if you're another programmer working on another part of the program), then any time it needs to call the function it has a 1/2 chance of needing to call two in a row."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3dwt3g,NotADamsel,0,Mon Jul 20 14:05:45 2015 UTC,the coin flip is ALWAYS 0.5  the question is a false dilemma. It asks if we can know what came before it based on what we've already done.  In statistical terms this doesn't exist the chance that we have taken a previous course can have zero impact on a future one.   Guessing the odds of what happened are a completely different problem and has zero impact from the coin. It's almost a red herring.  There are three possible outcomes with 2 possible deciding factors in each coin toss.

Yes, the answer to the first one is always going to be 1/2. The answer to the second one, as the lady said, could be either 1/2 or 1/3 depending on which way you look at it."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3dwt3g,NotADamsel,3,Mon Jul 20 22:14:24 2015 UTC,it's a post hoc assesment on statistics which you can't do.  It's contingent on how many flips you made so it's somewhere between 1 and infinity.  In which case if you're thinking about the probability distribution it will be solved via an infinite series NOT everyone following the video as you'll fall into the zeno's paradox fallacy.

In the jet being referenced above (the one from the photo, the T-38), there was a procedure right after climb out where we would turn the blower to full hot to basically evaporate/burn off all of the moisture in the system.  You get covered with water that comes out but it's very brief, couple seconds at most because the air coming out is REALLY freaking hot.  I'm sure you've seen the classic ""TURN THE HEAT OFF"" video, that pilot is pissed and yelling because what comes out the vent is like heat gun hot.  Anyways, if you didn't turn up the heat, the water would freeze later and you get pelted with little ice pellets in your mask, which is kind of funny."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3dgtjn,NCH_PANTHER,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:09:28 2015 UTC,"The problem is that 90% of your speech sounds don't happen through lip motions, it happens inside your mouth and throat. The details are lost because it's extremely difficult to portray internal mouth shapes while we're talking. Babies with hearing learn this by babbling, so through trial and error, learn which sounds are made by shaping your mouth in a very specific way.  It's also a big reason why teaching students to get great tone out of wind instruments can be challenging. There's not a good way to show what's happening inside your mouth while it's closed."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3da9wi,MadSaintAlice,-4,Wed Jul 15 06:59:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, so she spent almost 3 days with no food, and I'd like to make as little assumptions as possible, but 16 year old girls are not known as being the largest eaters. So the dehydration being a decision-making inhibitor, yes she followed a river down to a bridge, but she spent the first day at the site. So she's already dehydrated from the outset of her 2 day hike. How did she survive the night?   Her and her father credit her survival from watching Survivorman? I mean I can't be the only guy who thinks this sounds shaky since there is a total lack of evidence (they haven't even found the plane). Everyone is crediting her as a superhero, but when presented with a nigh impossible outcome, how is nobody calling foul-play? I'm not calling her a hero or a villain one way or the other, I just think that possibly a more thorough investigation has to be done, considering all the articles I see mention the TWO DEATHS as an aside. It's kind of creeping me out how positive and celebratory everyone is in the face of what is supposed to be a tragedy. It's like they're just writing that off. Maybe I'm missing some context?"
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3da9wi,MyNameIsDon,6,Wed Jul 15 08:06:50 2015 UTC,"A person does not need to eat or drink everyday. She likely was hungry by the time she got picked up, as well as thirsty. She followed a river, and I would bet that she might have taken a drink from it to avoid total dehydration.  One of the things mentioned in Survivorman is how to get out of the woods if lost, and that would be to find a river and go downstream, because eventually you will find a road.  I don't understand how you are reading foul-play, like she would kill her grandparents? My guess as to what happened: Grandpa had a heart attack and rolled the plane out of control. Grandma and Grandpa were both in the front seat, and may have gotten an engine to the body, crushing them. The girl was in the back, far enough to not have gotten crushed, and got out to cry, because now she is lost in the woods with two dead grandparents. She waited a day, felt she needed to go find help, and left the crash site."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3da9wi,CapturetheBomb,6,Wed Jul 15 08:28:38 2015 UTC,"People are incredibly resilient. Things like this happen fairly often, actually. They credit a survival TV show they watch because they are grasping for understanding. Maybe some of the things she learned on the show helped her, but at the end of the day she survived because of a combination of luck and the resilience of human beings.  It takes about a month to starve to death. For a healthy person, 3 days is shitty, but not life threatening. Water consumption is a lot more critical. 3 days without water is mortally dangerous, but a healthy person could potentially last about a week.  The only part of this that really comes close to defying any odds is that she survived the crash itself. It's not in any way ""nigh impossible.""  As for the reason everyone is celebrating her survival instead of mourning her loss is twofold:   They aren't. The people who lost two family members are almost certainly mourning. The news isn't focusing on it because the girl's survival is a much more interesting angle and people like a tale of survival. A few deaths in a small plane crash is a quick mention in local news. A heroic survival story where a writer gets to put his storytelling skills to work to make a somewhat unlikely survival into a miracle is much more appetizing. When a small plane crash happens like this, the worst is pretty much on everyone's mind. No one really expects survivors, except the grief stricken hopeful family. So it's not ""Well, the grandparents died but the girl is okay, so who cares."" It's ""Holy shit we thought they were all dead but the girl is alive, oh thank you thank you thank you.""   A more thorough investigation probably will be done, if they can find the plane. Now that she's back and can give them information, maybe they will. But as noted in the article, the area where the plane was lost is notoriously difficult to search. The sad fact is, a lot of small plane wrecks go unlocated, and at a certain point it becomes a waste of resources to keep looking.  Also, ask yourself what kind of foul play you expect here? We know they flew off in a plane, they have the flight records. They know the plane disappeared in bad weather. So what's the angle here?  How would foul play fit into the story? There was never a plane and the whole thing is to cover up a double murder? I assume the police are competent enough to determine if the grandfather was a pilot and had a plane, so that would have to be disposed of, and flight records would need to be forged... Doesn't make sense.  Did she crash the plane on purpose, then? Why? To kill herself and her grandparents? She couldn't possibly know she'd survive.  So, what then? Everyone survived and she killed her grandparents because... She always wanted to and now was the perfect opportunity? She went all ""Alive"" on them and ate them?  I'm not trying to be dismissive, I just really don't understand what you think happened. I really think you're chasing shadows here."

Or on the other end of the spectrum, walking in the middle of the day in a Desert without protection from the sun, or shelter and you will suffer sunburns that can cripple you.

If they are carrying it and it starts to flop around, anyone that gets near its mouth could quickly become seriously injured, and it easily has the muscle power and flexibility to get into the position to take off a hand or a chunk out of someone.  Even if they think it has become paralysed from not breathing, that's still a considerably larger risk if they are wrong than the tow method they used"

I'm a martial artist, and I've done some stage combat/choreographed fighting, and I basically had to retrain my entire body to do so.   I mean, consider it. You're basically forced to go from trying your ass off to put a serious hurt on a person, to doing literally everything in your power to not touch them but make it look real. And I mean sure, it's possible to be both a great martial artist and a stunt person. But don't make the mistake of thinking one translates well into the other.  A good example of it is XMA. Sure, you can do an X-out or a 540, but what do you do when someone gets you in a clinch or takes you to the ground? Apples and oranges."

You're right. She's amazingly good at what she does, but her competitive forms have looked nearly identical for the past couple decades. She does machine gun kicks, spins in circles doing them, holds up high side kicks, does a couple quick scorpion kicks, holds a slow scorpion kick, drop down into a split, does a kip-up, does an aerial cartwheel or two.   Here's a video of her back in 2001.  And here's one in 2014.  Not hating on her, she has become pretty successful doing what she's best at, so good for her. I prefer forms like these over what she does though."

I trained in jiu jitsu for 3 years, not a long time at all, but I definitely had basics down and could crush anyone at the gyms I'd show up at with equivalent experience. For reference, I am 6ft0in and weighed 210 pounds of nothing but muscle.  A 110lb 5ft3in Japanese guy with 15 years of experience made me look like a child every single time I parred up with him. Nothing I could do would give me any sort of an advantage. Just like you, I could lift him off the ground easily if I wanted, but it just didn't matter one bit. All of the techniques I tried were completely countered by him 100% of the time.  Now, if it were just an all out street fight things might be a little bit different, it's hard to say. Sometimes things go to the ground and sometimes they don't, but that is unrelated."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3clc4o,SirCunningLinguist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:50:58 2015 UTC,"The problem with BJJ to me, is that a lot of people who are focused primarily on sport BJJ get way too comfortable being on bottom. That's great for competition, or even MMA if you're exceptionally skilled, but it makes you way too vulnerable in a real fight. You see with her for example, she gets guys in a mounted triangle a couple times, and willingly gives up top position each time. With the guys she's rolling with that's fine, nobody is trying to hurt one another. But all it would take is one of them picking her up, walking her to the pavement, and slamming her on her head a few times. Even being much more skilled than them, she isn't skilled enough to prevent that.   If somebody was worried about self defense, I'd rather they put more effort into takedowns, passing guard, and sweeps rather than submissions from the bottom. Just my personal opinion."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3ccyp9,morelikebigpoor,31,Tue Jul 7 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"This is a girl climbing a rock facade in Victoria, B.C..  It's hard to tell the exact difficulty, but based on climbing similar facades, I would guess it was in the 5.10/V2 range; most people would be physically capable of doing this within their first year of climbing regularly; particularly fit or talented people within their first 6 months.  There are two additional factors here:  1) Protection.  I don't see a crash pad (a thick foam pad) below in case she falls, nor do I see a harness or rope.  I don't think she's high off the ground, but even a few feet to pavement can be pretty dangerous.  This definitely makes the climb more difficult at a mental level.  Especially given #2:  2) Facades suck to climb.  This could be the exception, but the problems with facades is that they're not climbing-grade rock.  They crumble easily and their easily eroded edges are often worn to a slope by the elements.  In addition, unlike a climbing route with a little traffic, this probably isn't climbed that often, so it probably has a lot of dust and grit on it.  Not good for friction.  In this picture, most of her weight is actually supported by her left leg.  Her right hand is holding a significant amount of weight--note the angle of her finger joints, which indicate she is in an open-hand crimp (a technique of locking the finger joints to increase friction on the finger tips) with a thumb pinch for lateral stability.  Her left hand is supporting little to no weight, which indicates that she is likely mid-movement, reaching for a new hold.  Once she gains this hold, she has two choices: reach further right to the edge of the column and begin using compression (at first between her right hand and left leg, then moving the left hand to the left edge for better opposition); or, move the right foot to the face of the pillar to off-weight the small and potentially traitorous cracks between the rocks.  With this width of a pillar, compression would be the more obvious approach (it is easiest to compress high-friction, vertically oriented holds that are 8-12"" short of your full wing span), but her body position (in particular her use of the far right crimp that places her hips in front of the column instead of beside it) leads me to believe that she will complete the ascent as a face climb.  I couldn't tell you why I just wrote all that.  Procrastination, I guess."

Is she just touching and turning knobs to make it look like she is doing something?   I've got maybe a grand total of 5-6 hours playing with similar equipment in the last decade, so I'm not any kind of expert either. That being said, it's not really difficult to tell what she's doing if you just watch her fingers and listen for changes/events in the sound that happen in parallel. She's going pretty nuts on the sampler for a minute, fucking with balance and pitch on her knobs some, and when you don't hear anything obvious, there's a good chance she's adjusting levels to even out something she can hear in her monitors. All in all, nothing she's doing is super impressive (or even a real improvement on the recording), IMO. If you ask me (nobody did), the whole craft really is a lot less entertaining to watch when you remove physical records (even if it's just serato). The amount of fiddling and live performance varies pretty wildly between artists without them, and some really big names have gotten to the top by basically pressing play on a laptop and going offstage for a smoke break. No amount of drum machine wizardry is really going to get past their bad example to change the popular conception of what DJs do, unfortunately. Anytime a subculture develops as insulated from the mainstream as EDM has in the past 20+ years, and then gains mainstream popularity, there's going to be a lot of silliness surrounding people doing things 'the way they've always been done' long after they stop making sense by people who weren't around in the days when those traditions meant something. People aren't ready to admit they really just like dancing around a lot of people without going to a scuzzy club, and they demand to be in the presence of an artist practicing his craft, so modern EDM DJs are just doing what they have to to meet that demand. In some cases, everyone involved looks a little ridiculous and pretentious."

I also think someone would be an idiot not to wear one, but that's their choice.  That being said, over 1.3 million Americans get traumatic brain injuries, most of which caused by simply falling. 52,000 a year are killed, with the leading cause in that category being motor vehicle accidents. I'm guessing the rate of serious pencil injuries is much lower.  With numbers like that, I think caution is warranted. Again, if someone wants to be an idiot it's their own business.

My whole point is that we are being hypocritical to an extreme.  What if a 64 million people have zero injuries n america from hitting their heads? that's still going to only be in the ~5% percentile risk category... with most of the them being teenagers and old people.  The whole idea that ALL possible precautions should be taken is daft... because we're asking people to cotton wool themselves against life.   Meh I don't care if people choose not to .

People survive miraculous crashes but we don't turn around and state 'WEAR NOTHING' because common sense says it was a fluke.  Just because it's sensible to wear leather doesn't mean me testing my new bike in a cul de sac at 15-20 mph is dangerous. That's just limiting you to be unable to perform basic tasks in life.  I could bump my car into a bollard at 20mph and be killed by the airbag exploding in my face.... do I now not drive a car unless i'm kitted out in armour?  I don't expect to win this but it clearly is a personal choice whether you view it as safe or not. I don't see evidence here that it is actively dangerous though.

As i said, i don't meant to tell people to not do dangerous things. But stupdid dangerous things is where my gripe is with. Like with the girls in the original post, wich makes these stunts without protection and in an seemingly normal space for normal traffic, wich would be much more dangerous for third partys.  Of course it is still dangerous, but i wouild argue that said danger is less likely to negatively impact others/make others suffer.  EDIT: It is not really about me liking what these stunts entail, but how carefull or careless they are performed towards the world around them. I like watching a capable athlete, but if said athlete is a selfcentered idiot endagering those around him, then i will have my personal gripes with it.  It is not like a disliked watching the girl doing what she did, just they way and where she did it, is what made me wary and critical."

I actually trained a bit in jiujutsu (just a semster) and it's the few martial arts that I know that actually teaches you good ground game (I wrestled a bit in HS and in tournament we had some dude kick everyones ass and lo and behold...jiujutsu background)  so yeah mad respect to jiujutsu actually, but in real life most people are gonna forget their training etc. My jiu jutsu teacher told me he only once ever got into a scrap, and in the moment he honestly forgot all his training (10 years as a teacher, and i've seen the fucker spar he's no joke and they don't hold back much even in demostrations) and didn't use any ""techniques"". So there's that for ya. And as the stupid old saying goes: you know karate? I know judo: judon't know I gotta knife, judon't know I gotta gun! Best thing is to not get into that type of situation"
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bxaed,zombieHunterq8,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:43:07 2015 UTC,"Traditional (Japanese) Ju Jitsu teaches takedowns, wrist and joint locks, pressure points and even bone break techniques.  It's extremely useful if you're a bar bouncer or a police officer.  You don't need a height, weight, or strength advantage which makes it much like other ""soft"" arts like aikido or judo.  It's almost all self-defense, and not meant for sparring or competition."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bxaed,bass_n_treble,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, i know a bit about it. in a real fight it may be useful, but only if you get lucky and are one of those that leads a life of steady training, or have a shitload of experience, like doing it while growing up.   Remember, in a lot of places people don't ""fight fair"". Where I live, you don't start a fight. You just don't, because the only fucker that's crazy enough to actually fight is almost guaranteed to have a weapon, be it a knife, brass knuckles, or a taser. Or his cousins. Or you may even beat his ass and end up having to deal with his family connections which get your ass not only thrown in jail, but possibly fired or have your professional life fucked with.   But, like I said before, yes, jiujutsu is one of the few legit martial arts that are effective in real combat."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bxaed,zombieHunterq8,10,Thu Jul 9 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"People don't forget their training in real life, it becomes the only thing they can do. No one I've ever trained with would corroborate with your instructor."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bxaed,midastouch42,3,Tue Jul 21 08:19:14 2015 UTC,"No one you've ever trained with probably got in a scrap AFTER their training. And people lie. The fact is people DO forget tons of training when shit becomes REAL, and not just in fights. Some things take a LONG time to become ""automatic"", and a lot of martial arts don't really equate to the real world, which is why people mainly focus on grapples to be competitive in events like UFC.   Even UFC is kinda...not lifelike though. In a real fight, if you find yourself at a disadvantage and on the ground, you're not really gonna go for a grapple, your gonna try to push the dude kicking your head in and get away from him so you can think a bit. Not everyone is able to think under pressure, no matter how much they're trained. Some people just can NOT function under pressure, which is why soldiers, for instance, get yelled at CONSTANTLY.   Don't get me wrong, some training has got to be better than NO training, but the way most people train doesn't prepare them for that minuscule possibility where they may actually need to defend themselves and get taken by surprise. On the other hand, if they're able to get mentally ready (aka not get jumped) they may be able to use something they learned.    Prime example: there was a video posted on reddit a few weeks ago using body cameras from two officers entering a restaurant and escorting some dude out that VERY QUICKLY escalated into a gunfight. The one officer lost her cool, while the other handled it well."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bxaed,zombieHunterq8,9,Tue Jul 21 08:40:23 2015 UTC,"While it is senseless to get in an anecdotal battle I will tell you what I think I know from great experience. I've been doing mma for over 13 years, and fought in the cage a lot. I can tell you firmly the way a trained fighter sees confrontation is not the way a normal person does, and going against one is a one way trip to an asswhooping. The people I've trained with are the hammer in a bar fight, not the nail. Granted it may be more clumsy and frantic than in the ring, but the winner is not in question. As for military guys being yelled at, it's not some stress management training, soldiers are just uncontrolled assholes.   Source; 13 yrs mma and 6 years infantry."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bxaed,midastouch42,6,Tue Jul 21 08:49:22 2015 UTC,"Bro i've seen a dude that does MMA get dropped with one hit from a guy that only did his mandatory service (Swede), and I know that dude was no joke in the ring, but that's not really my point.   You' train MMA which means you spar differently than a traditional martial artist. Like I said before: UFC-like events have pretty much proven that traditional martial arts training isn't very effective when it comes to any type of ""battle"" where grappling is gonna be involved at some point. Pretty much all fights end on the ground unless there's a huge mismatch anyway, so that basically means most real self defense situations.   As for the military, that's what I've heard, makes sense either way lol. I've taught English to military, did my own share of yelling.   I will have to disagree with the one way asswhooping thing tho bro, there's a thing in the brain which makes real different than simulated in fights. I'll spar with you any day any time, I won't fear for my life. I'll fucking go into the ring and face an MMA guy, I'll fucking do 30 seconds with a boxer even if the money was sweet enough. I've got no fear for my safety, pain is temporary, I'm not gonna die.   Now we walk into a bar and you point out even a small dude (and I'm NOT a small dude) and you tell me $1000 if you knock him out, I'm gonna say no. In real fights, it's different. For MOST people, it's different, training or no training. To put it another way, you can train in the military all you want shooting all types of guns and shit, mock battles, whatever. But unless you've actually been in war and seen some shit, you're not gonna be as good as the guy that's been in actual war. MMA is controlled, martial arts are controlled, real world...not controlled. I know it's not the same for everyone (confidence plays a huge role, mental agility does too) but for most people, in a real fight their gonna forget their shit.   But I don't think just talking about it is gonna settle this, I'm sure there's some kind of credible research on this type of shit. I'll have to google this.  edit: my bad, I'm really longwinded and I realize that  here's what a quick google search coughed up, and it's the only decent page that isn't trying to sell me something. I agree with most of the points made : http://martialartsvsfighting.tumblr.com/  If you strip down all that though, it comes down to mindset. In a real fight, you're mind is gonna be everywhere, you're not gonna be thinking too clearly. In a home invasion, you're probably gonna think about getting out of the house and calling the police, maybe not in that order. I mean unless you wanna gamble and see if you're MMA is good against a possible gun or knife. Or if you're boxing is good against multiple opponents. I'm not a trained fighter (some wrestling doesn't really count) but I am a decent fighter in the few fights I've been in, so I can't say I can comment on the mindset that comes with a lot of training, but I was the victim of a home invasion, and the intent wasn't robbery the intent was murder. Long story short my family managed to beat the guy and throw him out but he was back literally minutes later with his boys, but we managed to lock the door by then. I wasn't there for the initial fight, I just got home after he was thrown out. I'll tell you one thing: you do NOT think clearly. Even with a big thick door, you don't consider all possibilities. The only thing that stopped me from doing the ""smartest"" thing (grabbing a kitchen knife) was that I did not wanna live with murder. I was hoping the police would show up before the door was broken down, and if that door broke down it would have been me, my aging family, vs 6 guys my age.   But there weren't 6 guys actually. It was just dude's girlfriend and his two brothers. In the confusion I wasn't really processing information. In a real fight, if your boy grabs you to pull you off there's a big chance you'll take a swing at him. In the ring you don't swing at the ref when he pulls you off. In the real world, there's just more shit to process. MMA guys think they're tough, in a real fight I saw the guy get taken down in one punch. I've seen the same dude ringside take hit after hit no problem. You can NOT compare real fighting to competition...just can't.  I'm not saying MA or MMA is useless, not at all. My only point (cuz I know I'm longwinded as fuck) is that no matter what your skill level is, you can not count on it to function as well under real life or death circumstances. In a fight that isnt' life or death, most people's brains are gonna go into that fight or flight mode which treats it as such. Which brings me to the original point: girl kickin' ass in the gif isn't gonna be doing that shit to dude that steals her purse.   post edit: i'll kindly STFU now lol I talk too damn much"

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bigos,redconfetti,6,Tue Jun 30 01:32:53 2015 UTC,I think it's fine for people not to like the Packers very much.  We're all entitled to make mistakes in life.

You can see all the movement is coming from the arm where she should move her hips more. She's only able to do the move so fast because the sword isn't real steel, if it were the sword would move and she would follow it, where the opposite should be happening. I've trained martial arts sword forms for many years now and it was the first thing I noticed.  Also the camera they used to record this didn't have a very high framerate (which you can tell by the blur in the sword as it moves). Seeing her do this in real life might not baffle you as much as the video might. Now this. this is fast. This is so fast that at times you don't even see the sword move, it's just a flash. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6neXBwPIGoU - same principle applies though. Potato camera kinda messes up your perception of the speed of his movements."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,fineillmakeausername,172,Sun Jun 28 22:16:06 2015 UTC,Soooo... rugby players are tougher than soccer players? News to me.
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,therosesgrave,41,Sun Jun 28 23:00:59 2015 UTC,Acting injured in Rugby won't cause the standard knee-jerk reaction from the ref as it does in soccer.  With Rugby the game usually keeps playing unless the person is knocked out or visually fucked up. Most of the time everyone keeps going and a trainer will come on the field to check on the player.

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,shieldvexor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:49:41 2015 UTC,Rugby uses less safety equipment than football.  I don't get your point
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,theredvip3r,2,Mon Jul 6 08:11:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to say football is rougher than rugby but that it is rougher than basketball.  You bring up a fair point but I think that rugby wears less pads more because of the angles of attack in rugby and football (headfirst in football vs not so headfirst in rugby). I think football's padding allows for more dangerous play (not necessarily rougher though) because players don't fear injury as much.   However, I was more referencing the fact that football, rugby and hockey all require the usage of helmets of some form."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,shieldvexor,3,Mon Jul 6 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Ah sorry mate, im english  Football = soccer"
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,theredvip3r,5,Mon Jul 6 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"That and Rugby makes heavy use of the video ref, so players could never get away with that sort of thing even if they wanted to.   Footballers rely on the fact that the referee can only go on what they and the linesman see with their own eyes, so if you can make it look like something has happened, they have no way of verifying whether or not it did.   I'd be willing to bet that if football decided to adopt the video ref system (like pretty much every other sport already has) that this sort of behaviour would disappear. That and we wouldn't have to suffer tedious discussions about whether or not a goal was actually scored or a foul was actually committed."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,DrSphincter,-2,Wed Jul 1 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"It's not about being hurt. It's about the pace of the game and what's at stake. There's a lot going on on the pitch...the ref will often not call a genuine foul unless the player drops to the ground. This drop to the ground is to let the ref know that ""I'll take the foul"" and not play the advantage (big deal for keeping the 'flow' of the game alive). Professionally it is accepted that you sometimes go down to win the foul. Your coach and team will give you shit if you try to be a hero instead of winning the foul when it obviously is a foul. Unless youre Messi. Of course this also leads to a lot of fake dives. But point is its not about being hurt...it's a signal to the ref."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,beatlemaniac007,2,Fri Jul 3 20:05:30 2015 UTC,It's just the bad habit of pulling fouls all game. Here is a example if how bad it is.  My little cousin is six years old. When I played soccer with him and his brother for the first time. My six year old cousin would always fall when someone defends him or touch him.  I asked him why are you playing like that? No one gets to enjoy the game if you keep falling and acting injured.   He said I see the professional soccer players do it all the time when my dad watches soccer.  Jesus Christ this is what the pros are doing. He is right. Men FIFA hasn't been the same since that day.   Respect lost.

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,beatlemaniac007,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:01:50 2015 UTC,"You stop the sports for dives anyway, because you have to awards fouls etc.   Make it like tennis, only the captain can appeal calls, he can appeal any call he wants, but after three wrong appeals he can't make anymore."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,vbevan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"There's always huge debate on right/wrong calls. Even in post game analyses a lot of fouls are very ambiguous. It's hard to say one way or another a lot of times. Video replay wouldn't necessarily solve it anyway.  But mainly, if you watch you'll notice that yea sometimes people dive, but not enough to affect too much of the outcome (ofcourse you hear more of it and see them in highlights if they do affect it...but in general it's not a big deal). Basically the 'correctness' lost from no video replay isn't all that much and is worth less than the flow that would be lost by introducing pauses. In fact, it's funny when dives get punished...it's just part of the game. There's too much action throughout to worry about so few individual cases. It's like life...sometimes shit happens and you get screwed...you just gotta deal with it. And they do...the better generally usually wins."

I ran underneath a window unit air conditioner and sliced a straight line right across the top of my scalp - the strange thing about the top of your head is you have no nerve endings up there, so I had no idea I was even hurt until it suddenly felt like I was standing in the shower letting warm water run over my head.  The cut was probably less than an inch long but within 30 seconds, it had covered my entire head in blood, blood in my eyes, down my face, down my back, everywhere.  It was terrifying because it blinded me and all of my little kid friends were freaking out, though the laceration itself didn't even require stitches."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bfli1,pompousrompus,2,Mon Jun 29 12:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yep. Our son fell soon after he learned to stand on his own and hit his head on the coffee table. He had a 1/4"" cut above his eye, and it bled like crazy. We were dealing out and I called my mom who lived about 5 minutes away at the time to see if we needed to go to the ER. She came over, put a cold wet cloth on it and everything was fine. It was such a superficial cut that the hospital wouldn't have even stitched it. There was just a lot of blood and it looked awful.   Point of the story: if you get a facial laceration, try cleaning up the blood to get a real picture of how bad the cut is. It might not be as bad as it seems."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3bguh7,edifyingheresy,2,Mon Jun 29 22:49:22 2015 UTC,It's a compromise I guess. I wish people would just learn the difference between actual unique playing and straight up (mostly inferior) covers.   The girl who did a unique arrangement of Hotel California on the guitar was a worthwhile post. The girl playing a technically exact bass rendition over the rest of the RATM song is neither unique nor interesting.  To be honest you could probably just ban covers and get rid of 80% of the shit posts. Under the new rule things like the sign language lip sync vid I posted a while back that was well received would no longer be allowed. I think that's a shame.

They're each trying to surprise the other with a change in direction or speed while not getting surprised themselves.

It's madness I tell you! MADNESS!

You do many more things than just open and close your fingers with your upper arms. For example you need to bend your wrists and twist your arm, not to mention that you can move your fingers individually.  I admit I'm not an expert when it comes to prosthetics, but the best way to do that would probably be integrating with the nervous system because you only have a certain number of muscles in your arm.   That isn't to say that the video isn't impressive, it's just that we have a long way to go."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,3afwy7,SimonGn,5,Sat Jun 20 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"The particular ""stunts"" she did could just as easily be done by any hoon with the same amount of safety given the same conditions (wide open car park closed off to the public). The only difference is that she gets paid and has an insurance policy, but as far as actual skill goes, nothing she did in that video was so particular skillful that ONLY a ""professional stunt driver"" could do it. Now if she was doing actual stunts like driving the car two wheels and doing jumps and going through explosions, and fine control between obstacles on so on, now that would be impressive and a worthy job for a ""professional stunt driver""."

I think we only heard from a few vocal people about rule 3, which gave it the appearance of being split. I think before deciding what to do, you should poll people. Voluntary polls are not reliable, because only those who want to voice their opinions will do so, and people can create multiple accounts. IMO, the most reliable way to figure out whether or not the general user likes, dislikes, or is indifferent to the breaking of rule 3 is to randomly message subscribers and ask for their help. You could choose randomly from the comments section on sumbissions, or the OP himself. This, again, is not 100% reliable, because some people may not respond, and some people never post and therefore will not be in your pool of potential interviewees."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Lord_Meowington,5,Tue Jun 16 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"Enforcing them though.... Nobody likes reporting someone on a technicality. If say 10 users comment saying ""I call shenanigans"" then that gif/video can be called into question. But with the sub growing when does 10 become too few? And that would be difficult to moderate."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,pickpocket293,9,Mon Jun 15 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"I think mod discretion would be sufficient. If it seems like it doesn't belong, get rid of it.

I'm glad the post did it's job then :)  I like these suggestions a lot, especially the flair one. It's becoming increasingly apparent to me that rule #3, which stems from the ""However, I Do Concede That I Initially Clicked Because Girl."" part of our title is unnecessary. An argument could be made that that aspect of our title is satisfied by default seeing as a girl included in the post is expected on this sub. Seems like it should just be a 'there must be a female in your link' rule.  Thanks for your suggestions."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,blue_2501,4,Mon Jun 15 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the problem here is that users disagree on what the purpose of the sub should be.   Generally when a sub becomes flooded with contradicting content on a functional level, they make a different sub to split the traffic and make everybody happy. I actually kind of disagree with some of your assessments although I agree with others."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Strawberry_Chores,2,Mon Jun 15 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"shitpost[5]   This one is actually kinda hard.  It's more like Upvoted Not Because Girl, But Because It Is Very Funny – However, I Do Concede That I Initially Clicked Because Girl.  Although, the fun has more to do with the Girl part.   meh... shitpost? ehh... this is hard    Looks more like /r/cosplaygirls."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Dakrys,22,Mon Jun 15 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"would you prefer we enforce this rule ourselves or only with user input? If we enforced it ourselves we would only remove posts very clearly breaking rule #2.   I'd say enforce it for things that are clearly breaking rule #2 and let up/down votes speak for the rest.  For rule #3 I don't mind the thumbnails not obviously having a girl if I can imagine the same post in another sub with a clickbaity title. Rule #1 can stop that, and I agree that it should, but that doesn't mean the content shouldn't be shared.  But, these are just, like, my opinions, man."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Dakrys,20,Mon Jun 15 21:31:19 2015 UTC,"Woah this is still relatively fresh.   I'll be honest, I'm a pretty new subscriber. I feel like the posts linked are much better suited to a /r/girlsdoingcoolthings and wouldn't really have a place here. So we agree on that I suppose.  As far as the thumbnail thing goes, you're basing the rule off of However I Do Concede That I Initially Clicked Because Girl. Which is fair. But ""clicked"" could also be related to the title the previous poster put on the submission.   /r/UpvotedBecauseGirl and /r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG are always going to be interrelated, and I don't think that's a bad thing.   I always saw UPG as, ""This pretty girl is enhanced by the cool thing she's doing/wearing/etc"" where I saw this sub as, ""This cool thing is enhanced by the fact that it's being done by a pretty girl.""   The difference being that UPG is more focused on looks and somewhat less impressive feats, where we're looking for the coolest stuff done by somewhat attractive women that is shared on reddit.   I don't know how much of a piece of shit that makes me but that's how I was browsing this sub."

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Dakrys,5,Mon Jun 15 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"/r/UpvotedBecauseGirl has a much more negative viewpoint on the girl, in my opinion. It seems like they're trying to say that the post would never have been upvoted at all, except for the fact that it features a girl.  Which feels very dismissive of some excellent entertaining posts in there. Plus the comments are very focused on looks, as you say, and the people there seem to have more of an anti-women slant.  I like this sub because it feels like a good counterpoint. Basically 'stfu, haters from upvoted because girl, lots of women are doing awesome things.'   edit: even on their sidebar they link /r/shitpost so its basically a call-out sub for what they consider ""karma whoring""."

The reason the video came to someone's attention may be the girl even if it's not clear in the thumbnail, but it should be important than an objectively attractive woman is prominently featured right away in the clip, even if the thumbnail isn't clear.  Edit- in the examples list, I would say the rule should reject all but the first example."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Shiblon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:06:09 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, but think that the second example also belongs. Moderate to very attractive women visible in the thumbnail or first frame encourages me to wait for the image/gif to load, but I watch the whole thing and upvote when it's something awesome.   Speaking of awesome, what ever happened to the post where the chick shot a bow with her feet while doing a handstand?"

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,kiss-tits,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:25:46 2015 UTC,A very important thing here that can seperate this is it doesn't have to be the hot girl doing the cool thing. It can be the hot girl having the cool thing done to her (maybe).
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,blulizard,7,Mon Jun 15 20:26:23 2015 UTC,"You created this sub with a vision. I feel like you and I are on the same page with respect things that are upvoted because cool. I trust you to moderate more heavily with respect to rule 2. As for rule 3, sometimes I click because girl even if 'girl' is only mentioned in the title and not seen in the thumbnail. So I don't care about heavily moderating according to rule 3."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Ataraxist,8,Thu Jun 18 18:51:23 2015 UTC,Enforce them

Tough titties to OP, but they can karmawhore elsewhere. Let's just own up to one essential part of this: people aren't discovering content elsewhere to post here, they're x-posting here by nature of the sub. So, they should know exactly what they're getting into, and boohoo to them if they cry about it.   I think rule 3 should be enforced strictly as well.  Just go ahead and delete shitposts, I don't think anyone will care.   More enforcement will keep this subreddit fun."

That being said, I'd have nothing against you enforcing the guidelines a bit more strictly. You don't have to change the whole procedure from scratch, keep doing what you're doing (obviously redditors like it), just maybe if you happen to find one of those 50/50 ""should I delete or shouldn't I?"" kind of posts, klick the delete button a bit more often instead of letting it slip through.  This sub has really gotten big and you don't wanna end up with a third of the top posts also being in /r/upvotedbecausegirl and/or /r/girlsdoingcoolthings and your sub just being a mixture of the stuff you see everywhere else. Content often tends to get a little arbitrary as the userbase grows. (look at /r/pics for extreme example)  Oh, and good job you guys!"
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,paintanker,3,Mon Jun 15 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"I almost always usually click because reddit, watch because girl, and upvote because cool.  I rarely pay attention to the thumbnail, that just happens to be the subreddit's title."

Emphasis on ""I"". Just because the girl might not be obviously visible in the thumbnail to others doesn't mean that it wasn't visible to the person posting, and that's the bit that matters. As long as THEY saw a girl in the thumbnail and clicked because of it, it doesn't matter whether anyone else here did. I know that leaves the authenticity of posts in the hands of the poster's dishonesty or lack thereof, but I don't think there's anything that can be done about that."
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,Dumb_Dick_Sandwich,4,Mon Jun 15 20:35:15 2015 UTC,"I've had one of my comments removed because I made a comment about the girl's ginormous breasts, which I think was the reason that post was upvoted to begin with.

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,joshuarion,8,Mon Jun 15 17:50:19 2015 UTC,I think rules should be strictly enforced. It seems that the only way large subs keep their quality is by strict moderation.
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,matmatpenguin,5,Mon Jun 15 20:06:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like rule 3 gets broken a lot more, and that is disappointing, because, as you said, this sub isn't /r/GirlsDoingCoolThings.   If there isn't a girl clearly visible in the thumbnail, it doesn't belong in this sub. A lot of people will upvote it if it's cool, regardless of whether they clicked it initially because of the girl. Don't let this sub become a generic subreddit that caters to the masses - people can go to r/pics or r/gifs for that.

When you discussed rule 3 you linked 5 submissions that broke it and I will say that when those were submitted, each of them annoyed me because it didn't belong here...  Sure, they were cool to watch, but I enjoy bourbon and I enjoy beer, but /r/beer is not /r/bourbon... As such, it's in the title of the sub: ""...I Initially Clicked Because Girl"". If you didn't initially click because girl, it shouldn't be here, right?    Just my .02"

It would be pointless if you had permissions but didn't take the initiative to actually moderate. Sure, there will be those complaints tagged with [META] that'll complain about their posts being deleted, but to be honest, it would be better dealing with those than having shitposts everywhere. I mean, nuns? Just do what you think is right for your moderator duty. This is a really cool subreddit and I'd hate to see this go to crap.

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,39xhlx,SilkSk1,2,Mon Jun 15 20:56:01 2015 UTC,I agree with enforcing rule 2 but not rule 3.  The thing is you need not be able to see a girl in the thumbnail to be under the impression a girl will be in the image.   If the submission title mentions a girl then that's all the justification you need for the initial click.

Example #1 - Thumbnail is intriguing enough to open it, but you can't tell what it is.  Open it and it's a girl who's quite attractive, but the reason for voting for it is because of the dance that's going on.  Example #2 - This looks like girls in the thumbnail to me, but might not to someone else.  Likewise...  Example #3 - I couldn't tell what the hell this was until I opened it up, then it was clear it was a girl.  Example #4 - The girl is in the thumb, but she blends in with the car.  When you open it, she's in every frame of the image.  After all, it's not ""Upvoted because girl in thumbnail.""  That ties in to my feelings on #2, which is that if it'd be bland to see an average looking guy was doing it, it probably doesn't belong here.  If you can remove her attractiveness from the equation, and it's still really cool, I'd say it fits."

On top of that, the commenter you quoted is complaining about what they're wearing and that they're too old. He's not interested in the cool things, and is skirting Rule 1.
