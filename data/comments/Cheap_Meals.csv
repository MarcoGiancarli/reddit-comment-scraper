Cheap_Meals,3dnsai,blackdog917,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"Instead, you could make it with two slices of tomato and some pesto. Instant amazing, although pesto is a little more expensive."
Cheap_Meals,3dnsai,SilverAce88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:31:05 2015 UTC,"Not just good pesto, but great pesto can be made pretty cheaply with some forethought. You grow your own basil and oregano in a window box (you can put the window box on the window sill on the inside in the winter. And you can buy really good olive oil in 3 liter cans for a decent price, or else that's the splurge of the recipe. Good garlic is less than a dollar a head. Don't buy the 4 for a dollar netted tubes of chinese garlic- that is inferior to the USA, Italian or Sicilian garlic and doesn't save much.  Also, even in winter, the cheap 3 tomatoes to a celaphane covered sleave can be made sweet, tangy and delicious by cutting them up putting them on aluminum foil, and concentrating the juices and sugars under the broiler.  At this point you might as well make some pizza dough.  It will be better than most pizza you get at pizzerias and restaurants at a fraction of the cost, but will cost 4x more and take 4x more of your valuable time than the $0.32 ghetto pizzas of the article."
Cheap_Meals,3dn7vs,talentful,2,Fri Jul 17 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"Holy crap- that site clearly does not have enough pictures. Here's the gist of it (without 5 giant images):  Ingredients   2 cup mini sweet peppers (red color) 1 cup mini sweet peppers (orange color) 4 Thai red chili (or adjust to your spice tolerance) 1/4 cup of cherry tomatoes 1/2 of a Tofu Block 4 cloves of garlic 2 tsp salt 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil (divided into 2 equal parts) 1 tsp of basil, dried 1 tsp of oregano, dried 1/4 cup of cilantro (optional)   Instructions   Preheat oven to 400 degrees    Cut the mini sweet peppers into half and remove all seeds    Cut the cherry tomatoes into half    Place the tomatoes and peppers into a mixing bowl    Add garlic, salt and 1 portion of the oil to the mixing bowl    Mix well    Place the peppers and tomatoes in a baking sheet and spread them out evenly    Heat in the oven for about 20 minutes or until the outside of the peppers starts to char    Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes    Remove the charred skin from the peppers    Add them to a food processor    Add the remaining ingredients and blend well. Personally, I like to keep it at a rough consistency.    Use canning methods (such as this example given on the site) to store the sauce for a long time."

Cheap_Meals,3dn0f2,cabbagebrains,13,Fri Jul 17 16:22:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, I recommend pizza. Pizza is insanely cheap if you make it yourself. And you can make pizza with all kinds of leftovers like chicken and barbecue sauce. Pizza doesn't have to have a tomato sauce, I used to make pulled pork pizza, sliced potato and white sauce pizza etc. look for a simplified pizza crust recipe. Also maybe ""grandma pizza"" which is pressed flat in a tin tather than rolled out. Check Youtube for How To. I used to make instant pizzas in the toaster oven using baking soda instead of yeast.   Also, potatoes: baked, pan fried, mashed, baked french fries, etc. You can put stuff on them, gravy, sauce, salsa, cheese, sour cream, etc. Ground meat, sausage, sliced salami or bologna etc. I make Hassleback in the microwave then top with cottage cheese. You can even make noodles from potatoes: look up Chinese shredded potatoes and garlic.    Rice... can throw shredded cabbage from a bag and sausage and sliced onions and such in to boil with the rice. Top with soy sauce, gravy, teriyaki or hot sauce. Sprinkle with curry powder or chili powder or whatever. Stir in shredded cheese and a bit of milk to make a casserole.   Buy breakfast cereal only if it comes in a big bag. Or try oatmeal or brown rice with sugar for breakfast."

Cheap_Meals,3dn0f2,Wondeful,6,Mon Jul 20 19:51:22 2015 UTC,"If I'm trying to feed myself on a budget I go damn near vegetarian. Meat is the most expensive thing that I buy, so I get close to cutting it completely. Find out what day of the week the meat is on sale at your market and only shop on that day. For me, that is Thursday and a lot of meats are buy one get one free. Take it home and throw it straight into the freezer because if it's on sale it's going to go bad in 1-2 days.  Normally I keep in my pantry all the ingredients to make a pot of chili since it's mostly canned goods. If you have a couple cans of beans, some sort of diced/crushed/stewed tomato product, onion, chili powder, broth, cumin, garlic salt/powder, and whatever else you like in chili you can make one pot and feed on it the whole week. The only things you'll need that are not pantry-friendly are ground beef/turkey, sour cream, and cheese (both optional).  Otherwise here is my budget grocery list:   Sack of Onions Sack of potatoes A couple sweet potatoes (yams) if you like those Some type of green leafy vegetable (usually lettuce, this week was kale) Tomatoes Green bell peppers (cheaper and more versatile than the other colors) Frozen veggies - whatever kind you like Buy whatever fruits are on sale. Lately I have been living on blueberries and bananas because that is what has been cheap. EGGS. EAT LOTS OF EGGS. Buy whatever meat is on sale if you buy any at all Hopefully you have some sort of grain or pasta in your pantry that you can rely on. If not buy some - whatever you like. It comes in handy.   That's pretty much it. If you have a stocked pantry with basic things such as flour, spices, pasta, rice, etc. you can put together meals with just those things listed above + a few cheap things from the store."
Cheap_Meals,3dn0f2,meet-loaf,2,Fri Jul 17 20:42:05 2015 UTC,Oh. If you want to stretch meat: I don't eat meat for medical reasons but I make gravy by adding cornstarch (made into a paste with melted butter) and water to the pan whenever my wife finishes cooking meat for herself. This gravy gives a meat quality to the tofu and homemade paneer and other meat substitutes I have on rice.   Another good fake meat is the Magic Onion. You make a conical cut in the top of an onion and put butter and beef bullion in that and microwave it 3 minutes in a small bowl covered. When cut into large chunks and served on rice or noodles with vegetables it seems very much like there is meat there.

Cheap_Meals,3dn0f2,Megagreencolor,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but beans and rice can be a mother recipe to hundreds of variants based on what kinds of beans and rice what you include with them.   Spanish rice with pinto beans, chopped tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, and salt? Mexican beans and rice. Kidney beans, basmati rice, onion, garlic, ginger, masala, and salt? Indian beans and rice. Black beans, long-grain rice, onion, bell pepper, garlic, cumin, oregano, radishes, and a little pork? Cuban beans and rice. Red beans, white rice, bacon, onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, thyme, paprika, cayenne, and andouille sausage? Cajun/Creole beans and rice.   Because beans and rice together supply all essential amino acids, and because they're both common crops around the world, they're part of cuisine from all over the world, even from places you might not expect rice like Europe. Not only that, but they're highly neutral from a flavor perspective and are very good at absorbing flavors as they're cooked. Because beans (dry or canned) and rice are so inexpensive by volume, the few extra ingredients that you need to dress them up are suddenly much more affordable, whether it's vegetables, herbs, spices, or meats—or some combination of those.   Beans and rice are almost a n inside joke at /r/Cheap_Meals because it's such a perfect answer for people who only have a little to spend on food."

Cheap_Meals,3ckhq8,meet-loaf,3,Wed Jul 8 23:45:46 2015 UTC,"I think hot plate etc are too dangerous!  Rice cooker with automatic shut off is safer and people cook pancakes, bread, all sorts of things in them but better you just go with cold food untill you move out. Microwave is the safest and counter top models can be cheap esp. used ones and I have a Fasta Pasta I use to cook rice and pasta and potatoes in the microwave but really you should just wait for hot food untill you are somewhere safe I think.    Meanwhile seal everything food related in gallon ziploc freezer bags and wipe everything down with a spray cleaner that doesn't make bad fumes. Maybe a citrus cleaner or diluted vinegar. Again, I am so sorry about your situation."
Cheap_Meals,3ckhq8,ghostsarememories,4,Thu Jul 9 00:48:02 2015 UTC,"I can be a derp   Know your limits :)  If it's only for a few weeks (and in the summer), sandwiches, salads, fresh fruit  and breakfast cereal should keep you going. Dried fruit like raisins or banana chips or apricots make a good snack and can dress up breakfast cereal or yoghurt.  Sliced cheese and sliced salami (or other cured meats) keep in a fridge pretty well and are easy to make into sandwiches without utensils. Peanut butter and banana make a pretty good and pretty healthy sandwiches (in moderation). Peanut butter and cheese works too.  With boiling water you can make ramen. Add fresh herbs (cilantro/basil) and/or spring onions, sliced mushrooms, sliced peppers, siracha to dress it up. The herbs and veg don't need to be cooked. They could be eaten raw.  Also, instant soups work.  The big issue is food in your room. Maybe invest in a large plastic box with an airtight (aka pest-tight) lid to keep the non-refrigerated stuff contained."
Cheap_Meals,3ckhq8,omgitssarah,5,Thu Jul 9 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of chips and salsa, especially if you get the scoops kind and add a bit of shredded cheese. Sandwiches are good, but sometimes a pack of tortillas is cheaper than bread (corn tortillas can be 99cents for a huuuuge package), so you could make wraps. Oh! And tuna salad!"

Cheap_Meals,3ckhq8,meet-loaf,4,Wed Jul 8 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"Do you have a kettle? If you have an electric one, all you need is a place to plug it. It can be used for ramen, but also for some brands of instant rice that only need you to add boiling water, cover and wait a little. Also, couscous is made the same way. Then add beans (from a can, needs rinsing, though) and veggies, some spices and/or sauce (soy, terriyaki, honey garlic, salad dressing, etc.) And the leftovers are also good cold, for later. And you can buy precooked meat at the grocery and add that to your rice, couscous, ramen."
Cheap_Meals,3ckhq8,thelonebard,3,Thu Jul 9 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry about your situation.   Wraps are good. In addition to salad you can put tofu slices, tabouli, cashews and tahini in them. Excellent with Sriracha hot sauce. A roll up is a different sort of wrap. You place the tortilla flat and put a flat layer if swiss cheese or cream cheese and then a thin layer of cold cuts or salami and the roll it tight onto itself like rolling up a rug or towel and cut into pinwheel rounds.   Don't forget coleslaw and potato salad and pasta salad. Any of these actually tastes good with hard sausage and or swiss cheese chunks mixed in. You can also spike with mustard, salsa or hot sauce. I love cottage cheese but some people despise it. You can make cold pizza on a rice cracker but put the sauce or salsa on the cheese so the rice cake doesn't get soggy. Top with bits of salami cold cuts. My grocery store sells tomato-basil flavored rice cakes that rock with cream cheese.   Gorp or trail mix or mixed nuts. My bulk place sells broken pieces discounted.   A dessert I like is cream cheese and jam on a rice cake which is like a Danish or cheese cake. Big marshmallows are also a good treat. A gross but tasty desert is a flour tortilla spread with margarine and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar then rolled up and cut into rounds."

Cheap_Meals,3ckhq8,weightlossdream,3,Wed Jul 8 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"Go grab yourself a slow cooker and something that isn't fabric or paper to put it on. Last part might not be necessary, but you never know if the bottom will get hot.  You can make so many things, over on /r/slowcooking there's recipes for steaks, chicken, all sorts of stews and such, basically anything that doesn't specifically require frying can be done in a slow cooker. They're fairly easy to clean, one big dish plus eating dishes/utensils so it's not a big pain in the ass if at least the sink in their kitchen is usable, or the bathroom. Lower the quantities of things you need a bit and make enough for 2-3 servings rather than the traditional 100000 servings and store a few types of meal in your mini fridge in random plastic containers. You can generally find like 10-20 cheap containers at a grocery store or $2 shop for a couple bucks. Not having a microwave is extremely difficult though. We don't really have them here so I can't speak from experience, but aren't toaster ovens pretty cheap? Can you use one of those to reheat things? Wont be as easy as a microwave, but if you add a bit of additional moisture to non liquid based meals to prevent it drying out and then transfer it to a toasting? safe dish you can probably get away with it.  And if this is viable, the bonus is you only have to go to the store a couple days in a row. Go buy all your ingredients for 2-3 servings (Assuming you're only eating them at dinner.) and use them. Next day, do it again for a different thing, do it the day after and you now have 3 types of meal for a week without having to buy any more food to store."

You can boil and cook liquids up top, and if you take out the pitcher/pot you can use the metal warmer plate as a mini stove/hot plate which is perfect for toasting things like bread or tortillas. Wouldn't rely on it to fully cook proteins but can really turn things around.   Warning: Once you cook food with it, you are never using this thing for coffee again. On the bright side, you can easily find super cheap, use coffee makers at any goodwill/resale shop or online. Same for hot plates."

Cheap_Meals,3cigg8,Zequez,12,Wed Jul 8 10:17:23 2015 UTC,"When I was vegan for a few years I also developed vegan spice recipes for the various fake meat flavors through a lot of trial and error:  Chicken was a broth of onion, carrots, and celery with poultry spice.  Beef was cumin and basil and a bit of molasses.  Ham was liquid smoke or smoke salt with maple syrup or brown sugar and cloves.  Pork was sage and coriander.  Baloney or hot dog was soy sauce, coriander, nutmeg and brown sugar.  Sausage was smoked paprika, Italian spice blend, fennel and red pepper with a pinch of brown sugar.  My son loves a weird ""non-representational"" marinade I make with peanut butter and soy sauce with the ""beef"" spices but I don't always like dealing with the stickiness of it.  All of these seem helped by onion and garlic powder and being cooked in a pan with sesame oil after baking and refrigerating. Also I found vegan faux meat bullion which was more subtle than my mixes.  Finally, out of sheer perversity I tried making fake cheese. I marinated the slices in mirin, light miso, and nutritional yeast with a dash of wine vinegar and pinch of white sugar and salt. This I stored in the marinade without baking. Got better tasting over several days."

Cheap_Meals,3cigg8,Jingy_,2,Wed Jul 8 14:52:19 2015 UTC,I use this Adventist Mock Meatloaf recipe maker and my kids love the results. You could try tossing real meat into it:  http://www.veganlunchbox.com/loaf_studio.html  The texture is best if refrigerated overnight and served cold on a sandwhich or slightly heated and served with mashed potatoes.   For the carb component I recomend only the bread crumbs option or garbonzo bean flour not the other stuff. For the protein I recommend mashed firm tofu. And if you eat eggs add a one as a binder or use an egg substitute (one tablespoon of ground flax seed or chia seed dissolved in three tablespoon warm water and left a few minutes to gel). I use ketchup as a the liquid ingredient instead of broth and I toss in a spoonful of beef soup powder.

Flour tortillas are also a good source of dirt cheap calories that can pad your more flavorful ingredients.  You can wrap anything in a tortilla; even left over scrambled eggs.  Learn how to bake a whole chicken, then make soup from it."
Cheap_Meals,3ccsr3,eekozoid,2,Tue Jul 7 03:16:08 2015 UTC,"Try making an omelet. You can fold cooked onions or cold cuts or cheese or cream cheese or bottled salsa in it. Can actually be okay for lunch if there is melted cheese in it to hold it together.   You can try bulgur/tabbouleh which is wheat groats that you pour boiling water over and let sit covered a bit then add lemon juice or vinegar and chopped tomatoes onions and parsley. A good lunch. Can wrap with salad vegetables like lettuce and cucumber and red pepper in a tortilla with tahini or peanut butter. If you can't find bulgur you can use short grain brown rice which if you don't add the lemon and/or vinegar etc when re-heated with milk and butter is good for breakfast.   Rice you can boil in broth and add chopped or frozen vegetables and meat or sausage. You can melt shredded cheese with a splash of milk into this to form a stove-top ""casserole"". Rice and coleslaw and cashews and meat or tofu can be good in a rice paper wrap (see YouTube for how to use rice paper).  Another good lunch (or even breakfast) is potato salad or pasta salad. This can be mayonnaise based or done with bottled Italian salad dressing with a pinch of sugar or just lemon juice and grated parmigiana or asiago cheese. You can put chunks of sausage or cooked chicken in potato or pasta salad with chopped raw vegetables like yellow peppers, sliced carrots and/or tomatoes.   Also try Scottish style steel cut oats. Can be good even for dinner. See if you like homemade tuna salad, you can have this at work with crackers or rice cakes. You can try it with a bit of salsa or mustard mixed in. Rice cakes are hated by some but I like them with cream cheese and jam or peanut butler and jelly or salami slices and American cheese with a little mustard. Try rye bread or pumpernickel bread in place of white bread, keeps longer and is more flavorful. Good just spread with butter or margarine and topped with salami and/or sweet sandwich pickle slices.   Some people hate it but some people love it: cottage cheese. Growing up Jewish we had cottage cheese on toast with jam as a ""danish"" and cottage cheese with rice or egg noodles as lunch and just plain cottage cheese with season salt as a snack. My SO can't even watch me eat cottage cheese though but I love it.  If you feel daring try making a potato or spit-pea soup or corn chowder. Very cheap and filling and you can take it to work if you invest in a cheap soup thermos.   BTW when I was young in New York City I saved money by bringing coffee with milk and sugar to work in a thermos. That or jasmine tea which is the kind they serve at Chinese restaurants. My work lunch was plain yogurt with chunks of cantaloupe mixed in or the tabbouli.

And it keeps you full forever."

There are also recipes for homemade ranch seasoning and pretty much every other type of seasoning they sell pre-made at the store. I also use adobo seasoning, which probably does have a lot of sodium, but it's very tasty and very easy. I really like using it on my beans and rice."

Cheap_Meals,3agvo4,Squirelle,8,Mon Jun 22 07:32:05 2015 UTC,"I am making recommendations based on the assumption that you have 1) a crockpot/slow cooker and 2) a microwave rice cooker. If you don't have these things, you should get these things, because someone on the internet told you to get them. :)  I live off $35 a week, here in Virginian suburbia. General staples in my diet:   Rice with cilantro. I prefer brown rice, but white rice works too. Cilantro is cheap, plentiful and delicious. Black beans with frozen onions and peppers. There is a three pepper + onion frozen blend at Kroger that is perfect for this. Combine this with the cilantro rice and you have the fixings for veggie burritos (which is exactly what I do). Seasonal veggies. Right now, where I am, it's squash and zucchini. I cook it with a bit of olive oil and sliced onions. It is delicious. Tuna with sliced onion and celery. Add a little mayo, apply to sammiches. Savor the flavor.   All of these keep for a long time, so they can be cooked in big batches and carried throughout the week. They can also (mostly) be used as bases in other dishes. Feeling like chili one day? Cook up a little ground turkey, mix it with tomato sauce and add it to the beans.  For breakfast, I strongly suggest oatmeal. It is simple and delicious. Boil water, pour over oatmeal. Wait a minute. Add frozen fruit for extra sweetness."

Cheap_Meals,3agvo4,edddddddddd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"Find a sale on chicken stock (our local store sometimes has it 2/5 and it lasts forever)  Pick out two cans of beans (15 oz.) I usually go for navy or chickpeas and black beans. Some chicken. Rice if you want some starch, just remember it will expand so don't go over board with your measurements. Onions, celery, carrots, and any other veggie you might like in soup and make a big ole pot of it. Freeze what you don't use for up to a month. If it's just you you'll get several meals out of this one pot. If you got a Jimmy Johns anywhere near you they sell day old bread for .50-1.00 Cut up and toast in in the over for croutons in your soup."
Cheap_Meals,3agvo4,cmbyrd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:17:29 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a crock pot, buy one. Spend some time on some recipe sites, then spend some time in the store. What can you buy that you can turn into several different meals? For example: pot roast. Put that roast, salt and pepper, carrots, celery and potatoes in the crock pot before you leave for the day, you come home to delicious pot roast. With the leftovers, you can do delicious things like roast beef sammies (French dip!). Shred it up and you can make flautas (snacks), enchiladas, chili, omelets. Put on a creative shopping cap. If you're thinking prep, cook on Friday/Saturday night, prep and cook on Sunday and you have lunch and dinner for the week. Or you can be like me and leave the whole hunk in the fridge and carve off however much I need for whatever I want to do with it.   Another handy tool is the toaster oven. Buy some turkey patties/fish filets/steaks/chops, foil up the pan, put them in on bake/turbo/broil, however many minutes later and a bag of steam-in-microwave veg and you have dinner. It's faster and easier than using the regular oven."

Cheap_Meals,3a9xtl,HannasAnarion,2,Thu Jun 18 13:05:12 2015 UTC,"The answer is always dairy. Things that are spicy hot taste that way because they contain oils like capsiacin that stick to the oils that make up your cell walls. Water won't wash it away, because the oils are hydrophobic. You need to drink something that has lots more oils and fats in it, and milk is the perfect solution."
Cheap_Meals,3a9xtl,1YearWonder,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:23:28 2015 UTC,"In that case, it might be useful to also know (for future reference) that if you accidentally add a little too much salt to something, sometimes a little sugar can help. A lot of Asian cooking that calls for a lot of salty ingredients (cooking wine, soy sauce, black beans) often also calls for a little sugar. It helps to balance out the salt."

Cheap_Meals,3a1u6b,ctnomom,3,Tue Jun 16 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"I use between half and a whole onion and a few cloves of garlic per can of beans. I saute the veggies and then throw the beans on top, gives the flavors time to make friends. You get more flavor & richness the longer you cook the onions. If you let them get nice and golden-brown (without burning) it will add a lot of depth to your cooking. It's really amazing what onions can do for a dish if you treat them right.   If you like spicy, chop up a couple jalapeno, serrano, or habanero peppers and throw them in toward the end of the saute phase. Poblanos and anaheims are also good if you want to branch out from bell pepper, but they're a bit pricier. Chile peppers are pretty damn cheap, especially habaneros, since they weigh so little.  I also recommend mixing up your bean selection if you're eating beans so frequently. Red beans, pinto beans, and pink beans are all around the same price and variety is the spice of life--especially when you can't afford actual spices. That said, if you can swing some spices, a little cumin goes a long way, as does chili powder.   Goya sazon is the poor bean chef's best friend. It's a mix of cumin, chili pepper, black pepper, salt, and MSG and annatto for color. I may be missing an ingredient or two here, but it's ubiquitous in Latin American cooking and will instantly improve the quality of your bean dishes.  A bit of fresh cilantro adds an excellent splash of bright refreshing flavor, and if you're eating beans 10+ times a week, you won't have to worry about half the bunch going bad and getting thrown out. I think a bunch of cilantro only runs like 1.25.  Meat is an excellent, albeit more expensive, addition to bean dishes. I like to cook a sausage or two in the beans, then chop it up and mix it back in. A slice of bacon can add a lot of flavor, too.   Finally, you can use some fresh tomatos, tomato paste, or tomato sauce to give a bean dish a whole new vibe.  Edit: I'd also switch to olive oil over coconut oil. Coconut oil is expensive and pretty flavor-neutral, whereas olive oil will impart flavor to dishes.  Edit 2: Dried oregano is fantastic in beans!! I can't believe I forgot about him. You can also toss in like a half tsp of oregano into your rice while you steam it."
Cheap_Meals,3a1u6b,ToothlessDuke,3,Tue Jun 16 22:25:18 2015 UTC,"There's an Oregon restaurant chain that specializes pretty much in just bowls made with beans and rice, but the thing is that they put this amazing sauce on all of them (you can buy it in grocery stores, but it's stupid expensive). There are dups online, and seriously, it's way more than the sum of its parts and it is incredibly addictive. Here is a recipe. For the spendier stuff (i.e., almonds and nutritional yeast) I pick up just what little I need in bulk from a co-op/natural foods store and the cost ends up pretty negligible. It makes a lot and it keeps well, so that's a bonus. Apparently you can freeze it just fine, but I haven't tried it.   Here's the place's menu, which might give you an idea as to how versatile it can be. Seriously recommended, although you will need a food processor or blender."

Another delicious add in is a can of chopped green chilies. I say this everytime I post recipes, but growing your own herbs is cheap and fun. I also add some homegrown parsley and basil.

Cheap_Meals,38dni9,ChristophColombo,8,Wed Jun 3 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"On frozen chicken, it depends on your local stores, but it's generally more economical to get fresh chicken breasts/thighs.  You can freeze them just fine.  Around here, you can get boneless, skinless breasts (or thighs) for $1.99/lb.  Cheapest sale price I've seen on the frozen breasts was the same - $7.99 for a 4lb bag.  If you want really cheap meat, bone-in breasts and thighs are usually less than $1.50/lb and whole chickens are around $1.29/lb.  You can also get a 10 lb bag of leg quarters for around $8.  $20 for 5 days is easy though.  It doesn't sound like much when you think of it as $4/day, especially if you eat out, but when you're cooking for cheap, buying in bulk and making larger quantities are your friends.  A pot of pasta will cost you around $5 to make, and that generally feeds me for 5-6 dinners.  All you need is a pound of meat (~$2 if you go for chicken), jar of sauce (~$1.50), and a box of pasta ($1).  Cook your meat with some salt and pepper while you boil the water, then add the sauce and simmer while the pasta cooks.  If you have spices, throw some garlic, basil, oregano, and onion (or any combination of these) in with the meat to add some extra flavor - chicken alone is pretty bland.  That covers dinner for a week.  $15 left.  Lunch is sandwiches.  Lunch meat is around $4 for a pound, which should honestly be enough to get you through 8-9 days, but you can beef up your sandwiches a bit if you want.  Loaf of bread will be around $2, and hopefully you have some condiments.  If not, mustard is around $1.50.  $9 (or $7.50) left.  Breakfast is cereal.  You can go for oatmeal if you want super-cheap (~$3 and it'll last you a while)  or you can go for traditional cereal and milk, which will be a bit more (~$2 for store-brand cereal, ~$2 for milk, more like $3 if you're lactose intolerant like me and have to buy lactose free or soy/almond milk).  That'll still leave you with an extra $3-$6 to throw around.  Maybe get some other stuff to accompany the sandwiches (granola bars are great, and store brand is generally pretty cheap) or throw a bit of extra meat in your pasta."

Cheap_Meals,38dni9,druizr1,15,Wed Jun 3 17:57:34 2015 UTC,Buy a bag of frozen chicken breasts. Get some $1 canned veggies. You'll be under budget. You could even spring for a few fresh potatoes to do 2 veg meals.

Cheap_Meals,38dni9,gatchaman_ken,2,Thu Jun 4 03:26:26 2015 UTC,"Probably not the healthiest option, but here you go:    2-3 6 packs or ramen. The normal kind runs about $1.50 per 6 pack. You should have room in your budget for nicer stuff like the ones that aren't fried. Or just get the noodles and powdered bouillon seperately, which my work out cheaper. Eggs Lime juice. Whether a bottle of Real Lime or actual limes is cheaper depends on where you are and where you go. Down south actual limes may be cheaper. Spinach, 1-2 bags. If you can swing more veggies, go for it. Mushrooms are amazing for this, as are green onions. You could really use any leafy green for this. Kale might be good. Ham, bacon, or whatever else meat fits into your budget. Sriracha or crushed red pepper flakes or Korean red pepper paste or even curry powder if you're into spicy. I'm not too into spicy but I like to do this sometimes for variety.   And what you do with it is this: Regular ramen prepared as per the instructions is disgusting to me. But I like to use half the powder or less. Boil water, add noodles. Once soft, add egg(s) (I do one normally, 2 if I'm really hungry, and 3 if I'm starving) and let it keep boiling for 1-2 minutes, depending on how runny you like your eggs. If you're adding mushrooms put them in when you put in the egg. Other vegetables, depends on how cooked you want them. Pour all this into a bowl, then add lime juice. Spinach handfuls go on top, and chopped green onions too. If you want it richer, add a pat of butter. Then add your meat, which you should cook ahead of time - obviously this doesn't apply to sandwich meat, which is why I like ham or prosciutto for this.  Doing all this - reducing the sodium (this is pretty important since it allows for other flavors to shine), adding eggs/meat/veggies, and ideally using non-fried noodles - transforms a shitty unhealthy meal into something delicious and relatively nutritious. You get protein, B vitamins, iron and fat from the eggs and meat. Vitamin C from the lime. And all sorts of good stuff from the spinach/whatever leafy greens.  As stated, I HATE plain instant ramen. But by jazzing it up like this, I can eat it every day for pretty long stretches. Plus, you can make veggie omelets with the same ingredients. Or ditch the broth/veggies and just cook the noodles and top them with pasta sauce.   Also, it's a literal one pot meal that takes <10 minutes to make."

Make the cubes about 1-2cm big. Roast at 180c for about 30-40 mins until the edges are starting to brown and you can easily squash it with a fork or even spoon. Then mash 3/4 of the cubes and keep the other 1/4 in cubes.   Put 1/3 of the mashed squash into a risotto. A simple onion and pepper risotto will do. When the rice is cooked, stir the mashed squash in so it's evenly mixed in with the risotto. Then add the whole cubes and gently mix in so they don't break up. Stir for a minute or two, to make sure everything is hot.  Save the rest of the mashed squash for another day. Reheat it and add it to pasta along with some other veg. Wilted spinach, chilli and spring onion works.  That's two main meals for about £3-4. The mashed squash will keep, so you don't have to have them on consecutive days."

She's only ever had grandmas, so she's never heard mommy say she didn't like them. Thats actually what prompted me to reintroduce beans to her. I'm going to try some ""ranch style"" pinto beans with the tomatoes and onions and a little hot sauce (she likes a little spice). If that doesn't work, then I'll accept that she doesn't like them lol"

Cheap_Meals,37vwuy,tinktinkdotorg,7,Sun May 31 14:13:11 2015 UTC,"OK. Here are some staples that you can use for multiple meals:  Flour  Baking Soda  Salt  Eggs  Mayonnaise  Fat (Butter, Bacon Grease, Coconut Oil)  Spinach  Bacon or Sausage  Onion  Celery  Pepper  Chicken  Rice  Potatoes  Block Cheese  With these ingredients, you can make so many different meals that you should be fine for days or weeks. Add a few extras like garlic, mushrooms, tomatoes, bread (which you can make with main ingredients & yeast) and various vegetables; you can get very creative.  You can make tortillas, waffles, pancakes, bread, crepes, mashed potatoes, potato pancakes, spinach salad, egg salad, chicken salad, chicken soup, chicken noodle soup, chicken and rice (with sausage). I could go on and on. Not only that, but food banks give away so many of these ingredients (and more) that you can be set with no problem.   If you really want to get serious, learn the basics of gardening and start growing some of the staples. The fact that we have become a nation that is dependent upon others for our basic nutrition is really scary and is something that you have some control over! Good luck to you!"

Tortillas as so easy. Basically just bacon grease, water, flour and salt. Look up recipes online. You can also add spinach and they become wraps. Really good. Sautee any combination of onions, peppers, celery, garlic, carrots and mushrooms and add flour to make a roux for soup or just water or stock and throw in rice. After the rice cooks partway, add chicken and browned sausage. Bonus points for getting your broth by simmering down a chicken and picking off the meat. I always buy whole chicken or leg/thigh quarters on sale."

For now, baking spray or simply wipe down your baking sheet with the corner of a towel and dust with flour.   You will get baked on black crud. Wipe it off with a damp cloth. Soak if there are any lumps. Do not scrub. A well seasoned baking sheet is a disreputable-looking thing.   PS: biscuit crust pizza can be a glorious thing - and if you have the ingredients, damn near as quick as ordering it.   I should make some, now that I think of it.   * PS, it doesn't have to be sausage gravy. You could do a white sauce and whisk in frozen chopped spinach with, say siracha and it could be delicious. For that matter, sneaking some greens or some corn into sausage gravy isn't actually wrong. Some people will react as if you put beans in your chili but I have a simple rule for food and life. If it tastes good, I eat it."

The Publix brand of Cheerios and Chex type cereals work great for this.  Just stir in some butter, worchestershire sauce, soy sauce and some dry seasonings of your choice and bake at ~325F in a shallow greased pan stirring occasionally for about 60-90 minutes (should be mostly dry but maybe a little greasy...just don't let it burn!) then store in an air right container.

Some times I even pack them in the lunch too as a work snack.   Another thing I eat quite often is Oatmeal. I use water 99% of the time because I prefer it to milk. And it can be made a few ways. My personal favorite is 2 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp salt. Simple, sweet and salty, warm. It's also a good way to use up some vanilla extract (be careful how much to use... you want very little..) or pumpkin spice.

It dresses up and fancies up an average egg dinne.r   (2) Soups are such great platforms for an eater at the house. You can go sweet, spicy, savory, stew or light, or tomato or creamy. So many options and you aren't limited by much. In fact, you can go full veggie to avoid the meat.   (3) However, I seriously suggest investing in a slow cooker. If you hate handling raw meat, all you have to do with a slow cooker is throw it in the pot, throw seasoning and liquid and come back in a few hours. Then add some veggies if it's a roast or something. Then when it's finished, it's falling apart, shreddable and delicious dinner and it's not really involving touching of raw meat.   (4) Maybe look into casserole fundamentals. There could be some that you could adjust and make suited to your tastes.   (5) Lastly, why no potatoes? Omg. It's a legume?! Sorry.

Cheap_Meals,36ubfr,wolfmalfoy,3,Fri May 22 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, setting cheap meals aside for a minute, there's some preliminary research on your digestive microbes that might be of some interest to you. Clostridia, a common gut bacteria, helps to protect against food allergies. Research into the human digestive biome is in its infancy, but we may be hearing over the next few years that antihistamines are being replaced by custom probiotic foods.   It sounds like you can still eat quite a bit. As far as grains, you can eat rice, corn, and barley, which is more than enough to provide an inexpensive source of calories. You can eat any vegetable other than celery. You can eat any fruit but kiwi. You can still have plenty of nuts (though nuts can be expensive) like cashews, pecans, pine nuts, walnuts, and more. The list of stuff you can eat is way bigger than the list of stuff you can't.   For breakfast, maybe try a simple omelet or scramble. If you have a few bucks to spend, get some vegetables like bell pepper, mushrooms, and onions, all of which add a lot of flavor to eggs. Fry up the chopped vegetables in some butter over low heat until they're soft, then add the egg and cook to the desired consistency. Or combine some fruit with cottage cheese. Or have a fruit smoothie with a little milk, pomegranate juice, and frozen strawberries, blueberries and peach. Or make barley porridge, which you can eat just like oatmeal.   Lunches are pretty straightforward: salads. Those bags of salad can be great both because they go on sale constantly and because they can provide vegetables which can easily be dressed up. A basic bag salad with a little bit of chicken breast, cheese and dressing can be quite filling.   Dinners are simple: main course, side, salad. Man course is probably going to be meat, though it could just as easily be a vegetable, plus a simple side dish, anything from broccoli to hash browns to green beans to cream corn, and then a little more salad.   It's not mentioned as often as I'd like on /r/Cheap_Meals, but make friends with neighbors who grow foods, if you're lucky enough to have them. My neighbors and I all have food from our yards of one kind or another and not only does it keep costs down but it can produce really high quality foods. I promise the tomatoes from my backyard are better than any tomato from any supermarket; they're crimson from the skin to the core, juicy and sweet. My back neighbor has this amazing lemon tree. My other neighbor has fresh cherries. It takes surprisingly little effort to get a tree or plant going, and they can yield a ton of food. I always end up with a surplus from my garden, so my neighbors end up with free food.   As a fellow allergy-sufferer, don't let yourself get bogged down by what ultimately amounts to pretty small limitations. Have fun exploring the vast spectrum of food that you do have access to, because even with your allergies you'd need ten lifetimes to eat everything you're not allergic to."

Cheap_Meals,36thk6,protarchus,5,Fri May 22 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"Do you have a slow-cooker? If so, read on.   Have you ever tried beef shanks before? A lot of people avoid the shank cut because it can be a little tough and has a stronger beef flavor. The cut is from the upper leg of the cow and usually comes with a little bone which contains marrow. That's important. You may have heard ""low and slow"" before about cooking meat, and the relatively inexpensive (~$3.50/lb.) beef shank is perfect for this.   Here is the recipe. The genius of the recipe is that it's difficult to mess up. Slow-cooker recipes tend to be particularly forgiving for inexperienced chefs. As the article about the recipe indicates, Trader Joe's Two Buck Chuck is perfectly fine with this, and the wine gives the beef a real depth of flavor. This isn't going to be a cheap meal per se, it's certainly no rice and beans, but it will be a much cheaper version of an expensive meal. I'd guess you'll spend something like $7-8 on the beef, $2 on the wine, a buck on the garlic, a couple of bucks on the onions and celery, a few bucks on the broth, and I hope you have some oil, pepper, leaf of bay, and maybe even rosemary.   If you don't have a slow-cooker, let me know and I'll find something else.   Here is a recipe for simple mashed potatoes. I find that the fluffiness and buttery flavor and texture is perfect with the softened beef and strong flavor of the sauce. Russets are usually less than $1/lb. you probably already have salt, and butter and half and half will run a few bucks.   For the side, I'd honestly go with a simple salad bag with a budget vinaigrette. The beef is going to be pretty heavy, so you want to balance it. Get a smaller bag of mixed greens.   And have fun.

There's also a recipe for what you can do with leftovers of them in there that makes some great cheap tacos. Usually 3-4 florets as a side with a filling main dish fills me up. I'm pretty small so it might take more for other people, but every time I make them people rave about how delicious and filling they are. Best part is it doesn't take any real culinary skill it all!  (Most of the recipes in that cookbook are great, regardless!)"
Cheap_Meals,36thk6,xriion,3,Fri May 22 01:24:51 2015 UTC,While objectively I may not spend my extra $40 on one meal I completely get it. Sometimes a heart warming meal is exactly what the body and soul need to keep on keeping on. This isn't r/finances this is cheap meals! Some people are broke! I've had times in my life living hand to mouth. I clicked thinking I'd read some lovely posts instead I read this stuff.

Instead of thinking ""how can I help this person spend half that"" you know?  People also feel the need to know your entire financial history and stuff in order to help you. That's why I stopped responding. I have enough going on in life to worry about what a few people online say about me.   I will take what the helpful people have told me and use that in a way that can help."
Cheap_Meals,36thk6,jdepps113,7,Fri May 22 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"You can't normally even afford to eat enough, but now you're gonna blow 30 or 40 bucks on a single meal?  Unless your money troubles are over, you should make that money last.  If you're judicious you can get, say, a whole chicken, a bag of brown rice, some eggs, a gallon of milk, a lemon or two, and a few vegetables with $30 easily...enough to feed you both for a couple of days.  With $40 you could add butter and a couple more small things.  If normally you only get a small meal, I'd try and stretch that money out as far as possible by making this meal you're planning part of a larger strategy.  So I suggest roasting a chicken.  You wash it in cold water and take out the giblets from the inside (usually they're in a bag).  You put it in a roasting or cast iron pan.  I like to squeeze lemon, put salt and pepper on it, put small dabs of butter on it in various places.  Then put it in (preheated) oven at 350 F.  Start basting it periodically (take out and use spoon or baster to cover the skin of the bird with the liquid in the pan) after a half hour or forty minutes, repeat every 20 to 30 minutes.  It's done when you can stick a spoon inside the bird, rake across the top of the cavity (interior of the breastbone) and the juices on the spoon are no longer red.  Assuming a larger bird, which I recommend, of ~ 8 lbs, might take a couple hours.  Add to this meal some rice, which you can potentially refry in some of the drippings from the chicken after first boiling it up, and some steamed veggies."

When you eat frugally for so long, eating a nice home cooked meal until full is an amazing feeling! I eat one small meal a day. I'm not starving. Live it up,  OP! I get where your coming from."
Cheap_Meals,36thk6,HapGil,1 point,Sat May 23 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"Think courses. Start with a small appetizer, get 4 big button mushrooms, take the stem off and trim the end. Take the stems, a shallot, a little garlic powder(or clove if you have fresh), some bread crumbs and a bit of butter. Chop it all up and stuff it into the cap, bake at 350 for 15 minutes. Next serve a cup of soup, a light consume or a broth. Salad next. Look for a small one at the deli counter that has ingredients she likes. For the main course select your beef, go to a butcher if you can and talk to them about what you need. They will be able to offer you really good advice on the type of cut and how to prepare it as well as making sure that you get the most bang for your buck. For the side get a leek and a couple slices of bacon, cook the bacon and save the grease. Prepare the leak by cutting off the dark green part so you only have the whiter part. Slice the leek length wise from the base to the end, rotate 90 degrees and repeat the cut, you will now have the leek quatered but still attached to the root, rinse this well and shake loose excess water. Now cut the leek into sections about an inch long and fry it off in the bacon grease. It will reduce a lot as the water comes out. Toss the bacon in when it has started to cook down.  Make sure you get a loaf of bread or a couple of buns/rolls that you can toss in the oven to serve warm with the meal. You could mix some butter with garlic powder(or fresh crushed garlic), slice the bread butter it up, wrap it in tinfoil and toast it up for warm garlic bread. For desert look for an old fashioned bakery that makes a variety of little treats and buy a selection to allow her to choose her favourites. Also, if you have the cash perhaps get a large bottle of stout or lager to server with the meal or a bottle of wine if the budget allows. Good luck, bon appetite!"

Put leftovers in them and make an omelette. On the go? Do hard boiled and seal the deal with a little packet of salt you snagged from a fast food joint. Want to bump those up a notch try peeling them and then soaking them in soy sauce overnight, they're awesome.   Otherwise Spam is a good choice. Stay with me here, the rumors don't hold true. It's 90% pork shoulder and 10% ham. Best when pan fried in my opinion but cheap and should be a pantry staple of everyone. What about the preservatives you ask? You mean some sodium nitrate? The reason it has such a long shelf life is due to the fact that it's cooked inside the can. Mix it in with some eggs or pan fry it with some teryaki sauce and use it in the middle of a rice sandwich for some easy musubi."

Cheap_Meals,36gxsh,bikemuffin,2,Wed May 20 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"Wholegrain and cracked grain  porridges are good. I mean you don't get a huge amount of protein that way but if you can get wholegrains somewhere that they are priced more according to their actual cost to produce than according to what their hispter appeal is then you're golden on the price angle.  Canned tuna when it is on sale. It isn't hugely cheap but it has the advantage of being actual meat and being shelf stable and mixing easily with other foods.  If you see milk on sale in large quantities because the shop bought too much, then buy some and make homemade paneer. Saag paneeer is very yummy and full of nutrients.  My elderly greek neighbor used to collect garden snails and purge them then cook them. That's pretty damn cheap. As is fishing for whatever fish are common as muck in your local waterways. I could feed my family protein for almost nothing if I was willing to fish a couple of hours a day and feed them carp.  Home grown chicken and eggs can be pretty cheap but you have to have a bit of land and be ruthless about hens that have become too old to lay.   Check out the price of minced meats where you live. The price of them tends to be all over the place because it is very much a product of local economic forces, for example if you live in a state that produces lots of turkeys then there may be some times of the year when frozen breast roasts etc are being made that turkey mince comes right down in price."

Cheap_Meals,35k9fh,ocnarfsemaj,2,Mon May 11 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"One thing I do every so often is buy a big butternut squash. I cube it and roast it with garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and sage. It's done when you can mash it. Take it out of the oven and mash into a smooth paste. I then put it in a freezable tub. It's delicious with pasta or in a risotto or soup.   Another thing to do is make vegetable soups. Bags of potatoes, onions, leeks, carrot and celery are cheap. Chop them and boil them with some herbs and or stock and then blend them.  Veggie chilli con carne is cheap, healthy and uses up veg, you can even put a couple of spoonfuls of the butternut squash in! My version probably isn't very authentic but is healthy. In my recipe I've done proportions based on how much onion is used. But if you've only got one onion, but 3 peppers and a tub of mushrooms that need using up or to tins of beans etc, then it's not a disaster. If I use 1-2 onions, 1 pepper, 1-2 tin of beans, 1 tin of tomatoes and a few other odd bits such as a handful of lentils and a few mushrooms I can make 3-4 portions.You can make it with lean beef mince but I usually make it with quorn mince and/or mixed beans.   Dice onions and crush/finely chop 1-2 cloves of garlic per onion used. Fry in a little olive oil on a low heat. While onions are cooking dice and add bell peppers and/or leeks if you have them. I usually do about 1-2 pepper per onion used. Stir in, pepper, paprika, chilli, basil, oregano depending on how much you like these. fry for 5 mins. Add (quorn) mince if using it and/or lentils and cook for a couple of minutes. Stir a bit so the mince/lentils pick up all the flavours. Dice tomatoes (I usually add a couple, but 1-3 per onion used) and stir in with a cup of veg stock OR add a tin of chopped tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes, 15-20 if using meat. Add in chickpeas and/or kidney beans and/or mixed beans etc. You can even add a tin of baked beans! Don't add in any of the water unless the mixture is getting too dry. Also add in any other veg such as grated carrot,  mushrooms or sweet corn. Simmer for 10 minutes. In that time you can boil some rice or it can be served with tortilla wraps."

Using that as a baseline, you shouldn't pay more than ($3.50/0.73 lb)*0.80 lb = $3.84/lb for 80/20, $4.32/lb for 90/10, or $4.46/lb for 93/7, assuming your only concern is getting the most beef for the least price.

In my part of the world, a can of Goya brand costs $0.69 USD. Grab some of your reserved bacon fat (you are saving your bacon fat to use later, right?) and toss a healthy teaspoon into a heavy pan. Heat the bacon fat until it melts and add the entire contents of the can of beans. Using a potato masher, smash up the beans. Add a large pinch of salt and mix the beans around. Stir occasionally over medium heat until beans thicken. So, for about $0.80 you’ve got some delicious and healthy beans.

Maybe even cheaper if you can find those restaurant gallon sized cans.  That would leave you half the money for the rest of the vegetables, which I think should be plenty.  If you have some money leftover, you could spring for some parmesan and extra parsley for plating.      Jambalaya or fried rice might be good too, since they're like 98% rice."

Coffee with sugar and evaporated milk.  Lunch is either pizza or a wrap with rice, pinto beans, shredded cooked chicken, cabbage, carrot, onion, parmesan cheese, a splash of lemon juice and sazon. Iced tea, water, or lemonade to drink.  Dinner is a baked chicken leg quarter, basted with butter, soy sauce and sazon, served with a baked potato stuffed with sauteed cabbage, onions, crumbled bacon, and parmesan cheese. Tea or lemonade to drink.  A banana is your snack. If the bananas are starting to go overripe, slice them and freeze them. Puree them later with some instant coffee and a teaspoon of sugar for a coffee smoothie (or refreeze for coffee ""ice cream"").  EDIT: I really failed at math this time. 3 meals a day for 2 weeks is 42 meals, not 84. :) That just means it's that much easier to eat very well for 2 weeks with $70. You can substitute some of the veggies with broccoli, tomatoes, green peppers, spinach, fresh garlic, maybe even have one special seafood meal for two with blackened shrimp or poached salmon and an inexpensive white wine."
Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,jlking3,21,Sun Apr 26 14:54:39 2015 UTC,"Ten pounds of chicken for eight bucks? Where are you people shopping.  I get four chicken quarters for like ten dollars and that's nowhere near 5lb, let alone 10lb.  A lot of that pricing just does not seem realistic.. At least in Canada"
Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,Canarka,5,Sun Apr 26 15:41:41 2015 UTC,"Walmart in South Florida. You can get a 10 pound bag of chicken leg quarters (with maybe a single drumstick to make the weight more exact) for $7.99. It's a little messy, but I rinse each leg quarter and place one in a freezer bag with some oil, vinegar and sazon as a marinade.  Then I remove a bag from the freezer when I want chicken. Which, when it's convenient, is often. Bake for an hour or put on the grill or fried southern-style in a cast-iron skillet."
Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,jlking3,3,Sun Apr 26 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"I wish I could get that sort of pricing up here then. I'm trying to live on a student budget and there isnt a week that I don't spend $80-90. I don't get to eat that well, although it is pretty healthy. It is pretty much half of that food, even less."
Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,Canarka,4,Sun Apr 26 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Different places have different costs for food, so my budget and menus most likely don't reflect the prices elsewhere, but I hope they allow for a jumping off point. Part of what I try to do with my ""here we go"" shopping lists is getting things that go together really well, so I have many options for combining them in an attempt to make the meals seem less boring.  If you can get sazon completa locally, buy it. It's a seasoning that you'll literally use everywhere. If not, order it from Amazon. 6 ounces will last you a long long time, even though you're using it everywhere.  The US seems to prefer chicken breasts, which other countries tend not to use as much. This means that dark meat, such as thighs and legs, are cheaper because they're not in as much demand. I have always prefered dark meat, because it has more flavor than white meat does. But perhaps chicken breasts are cheaper there than leg quarters because of demand. Worth checking, I guess.  Another cheap source for chicken is to get chicken backs and chicken necks. You can usually pull enough meat from them to make a good chicken salad with mayo and celery and pickle relish, plus the bones make good chicken stock for cooking rice or making soup (or both).  The cheapest options for meals using store-bought foods are almost always:  1) oatmeal; 2) dried beans and rice; and 3) potatoes and cabbage.  Cabbage and carrots will always be the cheapest vegetables from the store, though growing some veggies of your own can be even cheaper. Zucchini and tomatoes are good choices for a garden, even if it's a balcony garden that uses 5-gallon buckets to grow the veggies. Herb gardens are also good cost-cutters: basil and chives are great choices there.  In South Florida, many homes have coconut, avocado and/or mango trees. Harvesting them (or getting some from a neighbor) adds flavor and nutrition for free. I never include them because they can be expensive elsewhere, but I've used harvested avocado instead of butter in cakes, and in place of shortening for pie crusts."

Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,sipjca,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:17:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in canada..  Some cheap food I recommend would be chicken casserole (I buy a pre cooked chicken but you can get 10 dollar chicken packs at walmart that have a good amount in them ) I use half the chicken for the casserole and the other half for sandwiches. That can feed me 3 days for $18. (Chicken, the soup, veggies and bread) or 20 if I want biscuits on top to make it more filling.   Breakfast oatmeal or banana pancakes. Mash up egg and banana and fry (very tasty !) and ripeness won't matter. A bunch of bananas and a dozen eggs is me than 5 dollars and that's 5 days worth of breakfasts.  Sometimes with a piece of toast.  Or, I'll buy a bi bag if Hashbrowns, dozen eggs and pack of sausage. $10. I fry them all up together (scrambled eggs) and that's 4-5 breakfasts.   Also, soups.  I make hamburger soup. Beef broth, ground beef, celery and carrots (or whatever you like) with a pinch of cayenne and Macaroni noodles. Can make enough for days. I do tend to buy cheese though because I'll bring it as a snack, toss it into soup (hamburger soup quickly becomes lasagna soup which is also good) but I always get large brick for 6 dollars   I also buy the nesfruta water squirt things when on sale for $2 because they taste very good and then it's All I drink. (They are actually very good. Better than any other brand IMO)   You can get a cheap roast also, and you can use it for sandwiches. Make pulled beef or regular sandwiches. Use half for stew. If you don't have a slow cooker wrap with some seasoning in Saran Wrap ten tin foil (leaving no Saran Wrap exposed ) and cook slowly in an oven. So tender even if the meat is cheaper.  And finally cutting up potatoes and carrots and roasting them is very tasty and filling.   And rice. Eat a lot of rice.  I don't have to eat cheaply but I find some of my favourite food is cheap."

Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,jlking3,8,Sun Apr 26 12:43:52 2015 UTC,"While you may not care about what you eat you do need to think about nutrition.  You need to include meats and proteins, veggies and diary products in your diet.   Long term eating just rice is going to make you sick and the money you save on food won't even begin to cover medical bills."
Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,Canyouhelpmeottawa,2,Sun Apr 26 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can get four 12-packs of Ramen noodles for about $9 from Walmart. That would be enough for one brick for every meal, every day, with 6 ramen packs left over.  But, not only is that not enough calories (380x3=1140 calories per day), but even if you ate double the amount of ramen to get the calories (buying 7 packs for about $16), it doesn't have enough nutrition. You may get enough iron for the day, and perhaps enough of some of the B vitamin complex to prevent some deficiency diseases, but with no vitamin A, C, D, or E, you're going to have a bad time. Scurvy happens relatively quickly as far as diseases go.  For only one day? Your body will cope with the nutrient loss if you just ate ramen for one day. But I'd predict that after 3 days of just ramen, you'd start to notice bad things happening."

Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,ocnarfsemaj,3,Sun Apr 26 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"You don't need meat, or even animal products to get good nutrition or to gain muscle.  Think about what elephants eat and how large they grow.  You definitely need protein, but rice and beans together provide all essential amino acids to form complete proteins in your body.  I'm not saying to go vegan, just that it wouldn't kill you if you cut out the chicken mentioned in an above post.  It may be good for your budget to use it sparingly and for flavor.  Beans, rice, and veggies make for a very healthy meal.  Dried beans are cheapest and are lower in sodium than canned.  I suggest buying frozen veggies since they're usually frozen at their peak of freshness, don't go bad, and are overall pretty darn cheap."

Cheap_Meals,33wx0y,Anotherbadsalmon,0,Sun Apr 26 22:00:21 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is to learn basic baking. 5lbs of bread flour costs $5 at my local grocery store (you can get it cheaper in bulk) and has 8360 calories; the only other place you'll beat that cost/calorie ratio is with vegetable oil.  Look into making your own pizza dough. You can make homemade mozzarella for cheap with whole milk (not ultra-pasteurized), rennet (dirt cheap, don't use Junket Rennet) and citric acid (dirt cheap).  I make my own pizza regularly. I also make my own hamburger buns, sourdough boule's, pasta, calzones, hot-pockets, naan bread (extremely easy), biscuits, flat-breads, bagels (require barley malt syrup), etc...  Dough is also very freezer hardy.  Learning to bake is the biggest money saver you can bring to your cooking experience. It's not worth being intimidated by; it's a bit messy the first few times you bake something (pro-tip: mix the flour and water with a long wooden spoon, not your hand; 90% of the mess is avoided), but other than that, follow the directions precisely and whatever you're making WILL be tasty. Baking is a science.  edit: Also, if you're going to be eating a very simple diet I recommend taking a multi-vitamin. Vitamins get a bad rap from a lot of people who don't know what they're talking about. There is an organization called the USP that is comprised of scientists who verify the nutrition content of various vitamins and supplements. Their seal of approval is coveted, and separates the wheat from the chaff.  This is 1.5 years worth of daily, USP-approved multi-vitamins for $17.  http://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Vitamins-Minerals-500-Count/dp/B002RL8FCU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1430070087&sr=8-2&keywords=usp+multivitamin  Information on the USP: http://www.usp.org/  Directory of USP-approved supplements: http://www.usp.org/usp-verification-services/usp-verified-dietary-supplements/verified-supplements  Job description of an actual open position with the USP right now (Scientist II/III): https://usp-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.jobinfo&jobid=342&company_id=16679&version=1&source=ONLINE&jobOwner=992414&aid=1   ""This is a hands-on, non-supervisory position in USP’s R&D Separation Laboratory.

A few foods to start you off:   Rice is an inexpensive starch Dry beans are cheap, good for you, and filling, but take some time for planning ahead; same with dry peas, dry lentils, and tofu Frozen vegetables won't spoil before you have time to eat them, retain the great majority of nutrients, and are cheap Apples and oranges are also inexpensive and have a long shelf life Depending on where you are in the country and the season, some fresh greens may be very... For example, New York grows a ton of cabbage, broccoli, and similar vegetables, so I can get that very cheap    More importantly, food components aren't terribly expensive, what's expensive are:   Buying meals that are ready to eat Eating out (This includes at work...best way around this is preparing packed lunches in bulk on Sundays then refrigerating them) Spoilage   This is a topic frequently discussed in /r/frugal, so may be worth re-asking there too.

Cheap_Meals,336i64,aideya,7,Mon Apr 20 07:18:49 2015 UTC,"Regarding Soylent: I eat it for lunch at work every day. Works great for me. It can leave you hungry if you're not used to smaller meals (it is meant to be the ideal 2000 calorie/day diet after all), but once you're used to it, it can be great. Easily flavorable. Not super cheap ($3 per meal lowest if you subscribe with them) so spendier than homemade (crock pots are the best, for the record, highly recommend) but way cheaper than what you've been cycling through so far.  Hope it helps."
Cheap_Meals,336i64,Piklikl,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:25:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! How long did it take you to get used to the taste? Would you recommend DIY or buying from them?
Cheap_Meals,336i64,aideya,3,Mon Apr 20 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"For me, it took less than a week. The second question is harder to answer. My boyfriend and I did DIY for 4-5 months before we finally got the initial shipment of official. I was struggling to bother at that point, I hated it sooooo much. Taste was great, but the texture (diy is pretty chunky) made me gag. My boyfriend loves the stuff.   When official showed up, I took to it immediately. Much better texture, flavor good, I was in heaven. So much better than the Taco Bell in my work's parking lot (ugh). My boyfriend however really didn't like official that much. Not a fan of the flavor and not a fan of the silty texture. He'll still drink it (great for road trip food), but week to week makes DIY. I'll never go back.  So long story short it's really a personal decision. Some facts to help your pro/con list: DIY is WAYYYYYY cheaper (his is like $0.85 per meal), but requires a large bulk order (hundreds of dollars) to start up since you have to buy the vitamin powders in bulk. Official is very powdery (made of finely ground oat flour and maltodextrin) and mostly flavorless whereas DIY is corn, oat or maltodextrin based and because home grinding isn't great can be chunkier. DIY is usually vanilla flavored because of the vitamin powder used in most common recipes."
Cheap_Meals,336i64,Piklikl,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Can you recommend any DIY Soylent recipes? Also, do you think the dry mix would get finer if you use a blender to mix the dry ingredients (or mix the fluid in with the dry mix using a blender)."
Cheap_Meals,336i64,ndguardian,3,Mon Apr 20 12:05:13 2015 UTC,"People Chow is still the most popular I THINK (I've been out of the diy scene for a while). The wonder of the official diy site is that it lets you save recipes and then tweak them to your satisfaction. For example the recipe we used has half of the corn flour (masa) and half oat flour for flavor as well as using half canola and half soybean oil. But doing that changes your vitamin ratios so you have to tweak it yourself to make sure it stays healthy for you.   That recipe also links easy places to get the ingredients but make sure you shop around. The vanilla vitamin powder can be ordered straight from GNC bogo half off on a pretty frequent basis if you're willing to commit to that much. We keep cost down by buying huge bulk orders of whey, getting our oats either in a local bulk store or from costco (here its 10lb for $8) and getting the masa locally (amazon has jacked pricing since diy made it popular).  Regarding a blender: it is my opinion that for DIY recipes you MUST use a blender. We used a food processor to make the masa even finer and we processed our own oats into flour. Since our processor didn't do what a commercial one could it stayed a little obvious once mixed. You can buy the oat flour pre-ground, and that may make the texture better but we've never tried as it is far more expensive than buying plain oats and grinding yourself. Boyfriend doesn't mind it at all though so it's just personal preference. once you've got the powders, then used a blender to mix it all up. It makes the texture far better, and the oil will emulsify as well. He usually blends a whole days' worth and then just shakes up the jug before he pours each meal.

I was just looking at the DIY Soylent site and I saw where you could create nutrient profiles, but did not quite see where you could build an actual recipe from there.  I appreciate that info here.

Buy: 1 x tray of Ground pork or beef 1 x Canned diced tomatoes or pasta sauce 1 x whole Green pepper  1 x whole onion 1 x box or 300g of mushrooms Cinnamon Cumin Ground Ginger Paprika Garlic power Salt  Pepper Olive oil  Optional: bacon, fresh basil and Rosemary, hard boiled eggs, cheese.   Cooking: 1. Combine all the spices together about 1-2 table spoons of each (don't have exact measurements) and coat all the ground meat with it. I find it easier to break apart the ground meat into chunks and rub the seasoning over it.    In a large pot/wok/anything brown the ground meat after it's been seasoned with some olive oil. Don't forget to stir.  Slice onion and remove skin Slice green pepper removing seeds Slice mushrooms if not pre-sliced.  After meat has browned add canned tomatoes including the liquid or pasta sauce and stir.  Add mushrooms, onion, and green pepper to the mix. Season with more pepper and salt to taste. Stir in all ingredients. Make sure everything gets covered in the sauce.  Let sit on medium heat covered until onions and peppers are soft. Perhaps about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally. the sauce or tomatoes should reduce down to a thicker consistency. The mixture should be bubbling gently.    Optional: Throw in fresh basil leaves and Rosemary springs about half way through cooking everything.  Pre cook the bacon and add in 10 mins before you finish cooking everything.  Serve finished product with 1-2 hard boiled eggs.  Serve with grated cheese.   Serve over rice or rice variant, mashed potatoes, or bed of greens.  Bring this with you in a thermos. Should be pretty hardy."
Cheap_Meals,336i64,zacsavage,1 point,Mon Apr 20 10:48:22 2015 UTC,"I have used this for lots of things like soup, casserole/slow cooked stews, spaghetti/pasta/rice/bean dishes, chowder, gumbo, chilli, and even scrambled eggs- works well and keeps food decently hot/warm, depending on what it is, for 5/6 hours. I've put it in a big pot of boiling water over a campfire to maintain or bring the temp up a bit with success too.  I recently bought this thermal stainless steel kit and have used it for leftover roast meats, whole meals (ie poached chicken breast, roast veg and mash), some fish dishes and even some desserts like pie, sticky date pudding and apple and berry crumble. Some of these smaller portions are put in smaller containers, then I fill the pot with boiling water and seal. You can also put different foods in containers within the big pot, meaning you don't need an all-in-one meal if you want some variety. It keeps hot for about 5ish hours, which might be long enough for you. (Not sure what the heating-pad-thingy is, but if it's big enough, the water bath option may be one for you to look at for reheating).  If you're looking for hearty, filling and nutritious meals, I'd recommend rice, bean and pulse-heavy meals with lots of veg. If slow cooking is your thing and you have the room in your freezer, get some big sealable bags, a few kgs of casserole meat, a few kgs of veggies, tins of tomato/beans, cups of pulses or rice, stock or bouillon cubes, herbs and spices and divvy it up amongst the bags and freeze. When you need a meal, take a frozen bag, pop the contents into the crock pot and your meal prep is done.  Hope some of that is helpful to you!"

Cheap_Meals,322dc6,moderndayathena,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:22:39 2015 UTC,Perhaps for breakfast you could try something like this http://thrivinghomeblog.com/2010/01/easy-breakfast-casserole-muffins/ - if you make a batch on a Sunday (for example) and then freeze them you can heat them up and have them for breakfast/morning tea as an extra filling thing to have :) As for dinners - do you have a slow cooker? I've found pre-preparing a bunch of meals to put in the freezer and then subsequently the slow cooker helps me to be more creative with meals & to try new things. Things like saucy chicken & beef dishes that you have over rice/pasta/cous cous are really good. Let me know if you're keen and i'll send you some recipes :)

Put the chicken in a pot of water. Bring to a rolling boil and discard the water. This gets rid of some of the oil.   Do what OP stated above except I use 1 part coconut milk 1 part soy sauce 1 part vinegar. Everything else is cooked the same way.  When it's almost done, mix some soy sauce and oil together in a bowl and baste each piece. I use thys. Toss it in the broiler for 4-5 minutes. It makes for some baller skin.  My 2 cents."

Cheap_Meals,2z5zjk,tsezell,9,Sun Mar 15 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"Here is an EXCELLENT, cheap, and basically effortless dish that, with minor variations, lends itself to many uses. Served with a couple eggs, it's a great breakfast or light lunch; it also serves a side dish with dinner (tonight I ordered in some cheap chinese food, but made this as a healthy side).  Get a bag of spinach at the supermarket. Heat some oil (cheap olive oil, or any kind of ""neutral"" oil) in a pot on medium-high. Chop up a couple fresh garlic cloves (to taste -- however much you like), throw 'em in, stir a bit. Once they've been sizzling for 20-30 seconds, add the spinach. All of it. Stir it up. The volume will reduce dramatically and quickly. Stir until it's all basically wilted. Lower the heat.  From here you can go one of two ways.  ""Greek"" -- add salt and pepper (to taste), and some FRESH lemon juice, maybe 1 tbsp. Ideally you started this one out with olive oil, but whatever.  ""Chinese"" -- add a tablespoon or so of soy sauce, some pepper (doesn't need salt), and optionally a teaspoon or so of rice vinegar if you've got it. If not, try regular vinegar, but I would start with only 1/2 teaspoon because the taste is somewhat harsher. Ideally you started this one out with ""neutral"" oil, but whatever.  Once you've added the seasonings (for both variants), stir thoroughly, then turn off the heat, and remove to a dish immediately. Spinach cooks really fast!  This is a good roundup of basic staples I like to always have on hand: cheap olive oil, some kind of neutral oil (vegetable, corn, canola), salt, pepper, fresh lemons, fresh garlic, soy sauce, some kind of vinegar."

I absolutely love it. Really good if you cut some potatoes up thin, toss them with olive oil and this seasoning then pan fry. delicious, good for carbs."
Cheap_Meals,2z5zjk,Sunstreaked,2,Mon Mar 16 07:45:56 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite lazy dinners is very similar to /u/gnosticus_IV's suggestion. There's a lot of customization opportunities in it (bacon or chicken breast or both, poached egg or cream sauce), so I end up having a variant of this about once a week.   Fry three-to-four straps of bacon (optional). Pan-fry a chicken breast in the leftover bacon grease, or in some cooking oil (optional). Set the meat aside.   Get a head of kale, some garlic, and a leek. Fry the garlic and leek first in the leftover bacon fat from the pan (if you decided to forgo bacon, just use some olive oil or something). After 30 seconds, throw in the kale so it can wilt.   While this is happening, make some pasta.   Here is where two routes diverge - you can either make a quick cream sauce OR poach an egg (cream sauce   and egg is too rich, in my experience).   For cream sauce (literally the easiest thing in the world): pour one cup of 10% cream over the kale/leeks/garlic, as well as two tablespoons of grated Parmesan. Turn up the heat and stir it around until the cream thickens into a sauce. Crumble the bacon/cut the chicken breast into pieces, stir it in. Stir in the pasta. Serve.   OR poach and egg and serve it on top of the kale/leek/garlic/bacon/chicken/pasta. Throw in a little bit of butter and Parmesan as you ""toss"" the ingredients together. Break the yolk of the egg over the food and stir it around. Eat."
Cheap_Meals,2z5zjk,lolalodge,2,Mon Mar 16 14:40:09 2015 UTC,"I would recommend investing in a spice rack.  You get 16 commonly used spices and herbs and most spices and herbs cost roughly $3 per jar (sometimes more) and a spice rack costs between $20-$30 so you're cutting your spice costs in half.  Some spice rack companies will also refill your spices and herbs free for like 5 years and it will usually say so on the box.  Also, this is something I would recommend to a beginner, get a spice rack where the labels are on the actual bottles, not the lids, it really sucks when you have mislabeled spices and herbs and you don't know them well enough to tell which is which.  Walmart sometimes has spice racks as does Target, but I would recommend Bed, Bath and Beyond, they tend to have better quality, plus they give out 20% off coupons like they're going out of style.  Also, for those coupons, even if they say they're expired, the store will still honor them, Bed, Bath and Beyond tends to be really good to their customers."

Open, mix, microwave for 2 minutes, and you are good to go. And they cost $2 a pop. I'll admit, they aren't super flavorful, but the pad thai is pretty solid and a little kick of hot sauce is second nature to me anyhow.  Side note, need more vitamans?

They are mostly ludicrous. If you can get 2.5 meals out of a can of soup, then good on you. If I ate half a can of soup for dinner, I'd be eating second-dinner within the hour. Serving sizes are mostly manipulated to manage the largest number on the label, so even if (after some math) the calories seem reasonable, make sure one can isn't 60% of your daily sodium intake.  There are single-serving, ready to eat meals that aren't as bad. Amy's Kitchen (canned and frozen) does alright, but I wouldn't ever call it cheap. Trader Joe's options (especially their frozen selections that may take a tiny bit of preparation) are similarly okay. You're still dealing with serving size deflation in both cases, as well as the occasional surprising amount of sugar or salt or whatever.  I don't think any of this is really a big problem if you're leaning on it occasionally to fill in the gaps on those nights you come home and can't even, or when you won't have the time to cook for a night or two.

If you want to be lazy on days you work, and if you're concerned about keeping it cheap, the ideal solution is to use canned goods, cheap cuts of meat, and/or fresh veggies (which are largely very inexpensive) to make big goddamn batches of things, then freeze single portions in quart bags. It's just as easy to defrost and heat a serving as it is to open a can and warm it up, assuming you have a microwave. With one day of work, you can potentially make several different meals, portion and freeze, and have a options for a few weeks. All at canned meal prices."

Cheap_Meals,2xx5zi,the_bearded_wonder,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:05:59 2015 UTC,What's a good price to get it for online? I've been buying 20 pound bags of dynasty jasmine rice for 35 dollars with shipping.
Cheap_Meals,2xx5zi,the_bearded_wonder,6,Thu Mar 5 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"I think the plastic tubs or jars idea should work. I would think maybe a Rubbermaid container or (sturdier yet) something like a 5 gallon bucket (with lid) would do it. We've also used the freezer to store flour, rice, and corn meal to keep the bugs out but you might not have that ability.  I seem to remember buying a 25 pound bag for about $10 not terribly long ago."
Cheap_Meals,2xx5zi,blackdog917,2,Wed Mar 4 21:38:12 2015 UTC,If you don't mind me asking where area are you from that you can get rice at that price?

Tortillas are cheap and plentiful and if you're really desperate you can grab some salsa from Del Taco, Taco Bell or Rubios if you don't want to spend the cash on salsa (you cheapskate).

Cheap_Meals,2wtvtz,Leagle_Egal,2,Mon Feb 23 16:50:33 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna copy and paste a recipe I posted a couple of days ago. It's one of my staples, it's cheap, and it us delicious. The recipe is written for a crock pot, but was originally meant for stovetop. If you want the stove variation just let me know.  This recipe is VERY customizable, so just use this as a base:  1 bag (1 lb) dried Pinto Beans  1-2 lb Pork shoulder (either whole or roughly cut into large cubes; it can also be other cuts of pork, as long as it's not super lean like chops or loin)  5 chopped up strips Bacon (optional - omit if the piece of pork you're using is particularly fatty, or if you've opted not to trim off the larger portions of fat, or if you're just trying to keep the calories down in general)  Salt (to taste)  1 Onion (diced)  Black Pepper (to taste)  Worcestershire Sauce (to taste)  Tabasco (to taste)  Vinegar (to taste - any vinegar will do, but cider vinegar is most flavorful)  Wash the beans in clean cold water, in a colander. There are occasionally rocks in there. Put beans in crockpot, cover with water by an inch. Add onions and pork, sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper and a couple shakes of worchestershire sauce. Turn heat on low and cover. Let simmer for 6-8 hours (6 if you cut the pork up into cubes, 8 if you just tossed it in whole).  The pork should be falling apart now and the beans nice and soft (ideally some have gone mushy while most still hold their shape). Remove the pork, and using two forks, shred it (when I do it, I usually cut up the pork rather than dumping it in whole, and I actually don't even need to use a fork to shred it - just some vigorous stirring). Dump it back in, stir, and season with as much tabasco, worchestershire, and salt as you want. Add vinegar to give it a bit of zing - usually just a tablespoon or two, less if you went heavy on the hot sauce.   Serve with sourdough or french bread.   I usually make this and end up freezing most of it for later. It makes a TON of food, and it's very very filling. Plus, leftovers are almost always better than the fresh batch because the beans have more time to soak in all the flavors.   I admit I may have made this recipe sound a lot more complicated than it is. I tried to give as much detail as possible. But I promise you it's dirt simple. Basically you just throw 3 things in the crock with some water and leave it alone."

Cheap_Meals,2vgp0l,cmbyrd,5,Tue Feb 10 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"Well yeah.  Cheap bacon is cheap...    All bacon is pretty heavy on the fat content, but better stuff will have wider strips of meat.  Having thick sliced help as well (as some of the fat stays intact rather than rendering out)  and center-cut is better as well (because that's where most of the meat is.)  Of course, both of those things wind up making it more expensive as well.    You could also try cooking your bacon less.  Most bacon is cured (like jerky) and therefore safe to eat as-is.  Uncured bacon is marked as such, so you don't have to guess which is which.  There is a lot of wiggle room while still keeping the satisfying crunch that we all love so much.  I, personally, consider bacon a luxury food - if I can't afford the good stuff I don't even bother."
Cheap_Meals,2vgp0l,prettybunnys,2,Wed Feb 11 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"Wait a second, so you're telling me I can nom on uncooked bacon as long as it is cured?"
Cheap_Meals,2vgp0l,cmbyrd,3,Wed Feb 11 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Cured = safe to eat,  yes.  That said, uncooked bacon is the most disappointing thing I can think of.  When I lived in Japan, I got up and went to McDonald's one morning for a breakfast sandwich, and found out that they didn't cook the bacon there - and the only word I can accurately use to describe it is 'flaccid'.

Cheap_Meals,2v95nk,SuperTallCraig,6,Mon Feb 9 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"Every time the knife scraped across the plate it was like nails down a chalkboard to me.   OP, take some of these suggestions. It doesn't take much money, time, or effort to really add some depth to your flavor. I would also recommend letting the onions and peppers get a little more brown. When your chicken is golden brown and delicious (GBD), take it out of the pan.   Put it in a bowl or on a plate and tent it with foil to keep it warm. Sauté the hell out of the peppers and onions. Then season them.   Some suggestions: carne asada seasoning, fajita seasoning, taco seasoning, Mrs. Dash of your choice, your own blend, etc. and a bit of salt and pepper. (Chicken should also receive a dash of S&P and a little of whatever seasoning you're using.)   Add chicken to the veggies and mix up, then proceed as usual. Top with some cilantro as long as you're not one of the people who taste soap when eating it.   A tip: Food can't brown properly in an overcrowded pan. Taking the chicken out before sautéing the veggies should help with that.   Hope this helps. :)"
Cheap_Meals,2v95nk,Autumnsprings,19,Mon Feb 9 18:59:36 2015 UTC,"Jesus, dude, you aren't even trying.    At least marinade the chicken overnight in oil, lime juice, chile powder, salt and pepper.  Use a cast iron pan or grill to get a good sear, then slice it.  Sauté the onions and peppers separately and add them on top, with some fresh cilantro.  Your pan is way too crowded, the meat has no flavor and no sear at all.  Cilantro and chile powder cost nothing."

Cheap_Meals,2uetoa,IamMoltar,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"Pancakes are awesome.  First advice, needs vanilla extract.  Also, the only box mix that IMHO is any good (simple) is Jiffy Mix. It's better than plain flour. Strangely enough it's also the cheapest.  Here's what I do for 8-10 cakes. Cut it in half for less but go heavy on the oil:   about 2 cups Jiffy 1 egg no more 2 tbsp canola oil (yes. maybe more. good. secret good.) 1 tsp melted butter dash vanilla enough milk until medium to thin gruel usually less than 1cup, mix in milk last and gradually until desired secret consistency (pretty thin for me). I use whole milk but 2% ok too   Mix together until most lumps gone, about 30 sec. Preheat large pan or griddle if you have it. Medium to medium high depends. Make 50/50 butter oil combo in microwave dish, not too hot just melted.  Spread on not too hot pan with brush. Rapidly ladle pancake mix in about 5-6 inch diameter(s). However many you can but underestimate; keep them separate. It's diabolically easy to accidentally over-ladle and 'join' them which is not a big problem but gets messy.  Cook until bubbles are popping and top is getting a 'skin'. No longer.  Flip and cook. Inspect to see done. Adjust heat as needed. The first round IMHO is never good. You need to go for adjustments and second round is much better.   With each round you should also brush some more oil and or butter (or 50/50) to the pan first.  Adjust to your taste. None will make a very 'dry' cake, and lots will make a very tasty cake IMHO.   Keep the heat a little lower than you think.   Enjoy!!"

Cheap_Meals,2u2eo8,dchurch0,4,Thu Jan 29 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"A good idea for chicken breast is to lay it on foil, season it and then make a little parcel (not too tight) and then put it in the oven for like 45mins at about 150C. You can also throw veggies in there like broccoli, beans, tomatoes, carrot slices. You could make a few packages, steam them all while preparing your carbs and then make 4 or 5 servings in about an hour ready for the week.   Seasonings are totally up to you, and a little goes a long way. Might need to invest in a few but they should keep you going a while. Getting a few new herbs and spices will spice up boring ingredients.  I usually try match them with the carbs - so asian style for rice, Mediterranean for pasta etc... Get a bunch of fresh herbs (like coriander, parsley, thyme..) to give ""boring meals"" a fresh kick. Fresh lemon or lime is good too.  It all depends what I have in the pantry or whats on special, but here are some seasoning ideas (I just make it up as I go along)  Asian style seasonings Ginger, soy, garlic, chilli, scallions, sriracha, hoisin, lemongrass, sesame oil, five-spice mix  Mediterranean seasonings lemons (wash and put a few slices under or on top of the chicken), oregano, thyme,  olive oil, salt and pepper.   Middle eastern Ras el hanout, chilli, cumin, coriander.  My snacking suggestions: Raw veggies (they give you something to chew on) like celery, carrot or cucumber. Make a low fat yoghurt dip by chopping some herbs and stirring them into yoghurt. Add some salt and pepper and lemon juice and let it sit for a few hours before dipping veggie sticks in it.  Some high cocoa (like 70-80%) chocolate will keep cravings at bay. One piece is usually all I eat. (be careful eating this late at night, it works as a stimulant)"
Cheap_Meals,2u2eo8,dabius,4,Thu Jan 29 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"Just about any kind of diet will work (be it low-carb; low calorie; glycemic index; etc) IF you stick to it.  Some might work better for your particular body than others, but over the course of a month you don't really have time to experiment and figure out which.    For many Americans, just stopping drinking calories (soda, sweet tea, beer, juices) is enough to lose a pretty significant amount of weight honestly.  The whole 3500 calories = 1 lb of fat is... inaccurate, but at least a decent starting point.  A 6-pack of Coca Cola a day ends up being 5880 calories a week, or 1.68 lbs.  Almost 7 lbs in a month, that's a fair mount of body fat.  If you want more than that, figure out which diet plan seems the most tolerable to you, and roll with it.  Personally, last time I did a weight loss challenge I started at ~145 lbs, and 6 weeks later was ~135, but had put on 10 lbs of muscle, so dropped ~20 lbs of fat in 6 weeks.  Used the slow-carb diet exactly as described in the book.  It was one I could stand because I still got to eat some legumes, so felt more full; and it had cheat days when I seriously would eat something like 10,000 calories in a day.  The day after I'd be up more than a bit, but by 3-4 days later, overall loss had occurred.   The muscle gain was from cycling and lifting (in order to be a better cyclist), both of which I had been doing before the diet, with far less success."
Cheap_Meals,2u2eo8,cmbyrd,3,Thu Jan 29 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"Well I eat breakfast items a lot.  I like to make giant spinach, cheese, tomato and egg omelets and cut and freeze them.

Cheap_Meals,2tvwsm,Kellbr08,2,Tue Jan 27 22:41:59 2015 UTC,"I went through a few months where I had oatmeal almost every day for breakfast before work. It's wicked easy. The night before, I mixed together all the ingredients in a microwave safe Tupperware (oats, milk, maple syrup, fruit, nuts etc depending on the flavor I wanted the next morning). Then I would wake up, start getting ready, and move the Tupperware straight from the fridge to the microwave (unscrew the top or you get a horrible horrible mess) for a few minutes. I would generally let it sit in the microwave as I was getting ready, so that by the time I was ready to eat; all the heat was evenly distributed."

Although if I have the time I prefer to make more of the original meal on purpose for the purpose of freezing into lots of portions so we have easy meals in the freezer for the next few weeks - I find that this way reduces the inevitable situation where we just never get round to using up whatever raw ingredients are in the fridge and they get thrown out."

Top it up with veg stock, add in your beans then cook it all until it's nearly all cooked.   Then snap in the spaghetti so it's just in 1-2 inch pieces and cook.   As you love spicy then add in a tsp of dried chills flakes.   Finish with grated parmesan which will melt into it. FULL of flavour and incredibly healthy."

Cheap_Meals,2sh017,SimplySusieVLOG,5,Thu Jan 15 02:18:12 2015 UTC,"Korean BBQ is expensive (if you go to good legitimate Korean BBQ restaurants).  Galbi is worth usually 29-38 dollars for one order.  Bulgogi is actually one of the cheaper ones but due to the quality of the meat. Don't use high quality meat on Bulgogi, it's a waste of money. The meat is heavily marinated and seasoned to compensate for the lower quality of meat and the way it is cooked makes you not need to have high quality meat.  If you want a good homemade Korean BBQ, go to Costco and buy meat there. You can get everything you need for decent/good quality at better prices. You can buy a pack of pork belly (Samgyupsal) that can feed a family of 4-5 about the same price as one or two orders at a Korean BBQ restaurant which would feed 1-2 people (but taking into account that we like to eat, it won't completely satisfy one person). Spicy porkbelly costs an extra 1-4 dollars for just gochujang paste added on so buying gochujang at a local market is alot cheaper and lasts longer."

Cheap_Meals,2sh017,aManPerson,1 point,Thu Jan 15 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"I have had success using sirloin.  It's not quite as tender and flavorful, but it is sufficient for my palate.  To me the key is slicing the beef as thinly as possible.  To do this, I will put the steak in the freezer long enough for it to form a structure on the outside, but not so long that it freezes through.  Then use a sharp knife to cut across the grain as thinly as your dexterity and tools will allow.  The sugar and acid from the pear and the salt from the soy sauce should help tenderize the tougher cut.  I like to marinade for at least 24 hours, and cook only what I need for a meal as it tastes best and has the best texture right after it's been cooked.  To make this cheap, buy the beef in value packs and make a double or triple recipe.  After marinating, I like to keep enough on hand to make meals during the week.  Then I will freeze the rest to have quick meals on hand for a future date.  To stretch this out even further, I will turn my bounty of bulgogi into a bibimbap (korean mixed rice with veggies).  For me this is a matter of stir frying/sauteeing whatever veggies I have on hand (usually spinach, carrots, zucchini and mushrooms), frying an egg and serving it over rice with a smattering of gochujang sauce.  It's probably not authentic, but it amortizes the cost of the meat across several meals."

If you want to make it go farther, mix rice and beans in with the meat. Put some chips in a pan, put the meat on the chips, a little bit of cheese, then broil in the oven to melt the cheese. Salsa on the side if you're feeling fancy. I've fed 7-10 people with two pounds of beef, a pepper and an onion, and a box of rice mix with some chips. About $15-20 US dollars.  You could also use all these things and instead of doing chips, make burgers with the meat, serve with rice and beans on the side."

It's literally hard to make something turn out bad. No need to worry about over or under-cooking, and pretty much any meat and sauce combo will turn out delicious after 6-8 hours on low. It's especially useful for cheap roasts because it breaks down the fat and tough connective tissue.  Check out /r/slowcooking for recipes. The sidebar has some good ones. I also like to make shredded buffalo chicken for sandwiches or pizza topping, pot roasts, or soups and stews. You can also do some unconventional stuff like desserts or even homemade yogurt.  It takes some of the stress out of preparing the main dish, so you can go all out with sides if you want."

You're presumably in the UK so a 6-litre slow cooker is what you're after - find a cheap one like this, and it's easy to cook for 8-10 people (aka leftovers for days). Smaller ones are also fine (I've cooked hams/chickens/pork shoulders in my 3.5l model) but it does become a tighter fit.  Easy recipes aplenty over at /r/slowcooking - salsa chicken with rice is stupid easy, and can be thrown together from frozen chopped veg (as cheap to buy frozen diced peppers in tesco as it is to buy fresh peppers), a pack of frozen chicken, a jar of salsa and some taco/jerk seasoning. Pulled pork with rice/in rolls is also great, and chilis/stews are a breeze.   My current favourite is a 'campfire stew' from slimming world, which is nearly as easy as salsa chicken but uses baked beans and a gammon joint instead to give a fantastic pork and bean stew."

As your topping with siracha points out, really does add a lot to the dish.    You can (and it is traditional to) cook the eggs by putting the bowel you're whisking them in over the boiling pot of water - effectively creating a double boiler - rather than microwaving them as well.  Would likely prevent any clumps that microwave would cause, as well as adapt the recipe for using only a single burner.  You also left out adding the butter to the hollandaise sauce, which I assume was only in the write up...as it was in the ingredients list.  Traditionally, only the butter fat is used (which requires clarifying it before use) but I find that whole butter works as well - just don't add any water to the egg yolks in the beginning."

Creme brulee isn't too crazy, but it's easy to mess up if you've never done it before.  Here's an appetizer that's pretty easy.  It's not crazy fancy (though you could fancy it up) but fresh baked bread with honey on top rarely fails to please.  30 Minute Rolls Yield: 12 large rolls  Ingredients   1 C plus 2 Tbsp warm water 1/3 C butter, softened (but not hot, if you melted it) 2 Tbsp active dry yeast 1/4 C sugar 1 1/2 tsp salt 1 egg 3 1/2 C bread flour (seems to work better but all purpose flour will also work) ~2 Tbsp butter, for roll tops ~2 Tbsp honey, for roll tops   Instructions  Heat oven to 400 degrees.  In your mixer bowl combine the water, butter, yeast and sugar and allow it to rest for 15 minutes. With a wooden spoon (or a dough hook, if you must), mix in the salt, egg and flour.  Knead until well incorporated and dough is soft and smooth. (Just a few minutes)  Form dough into ~12 balls and then place in a greased 9 x 13 pan (I actually use a cast-iron skillet, presentation is key, motherfuckers) and allow to rest for 10 minutes at room temperature or slightly higher.  In a microwave melt the 2 tablespoons of butter and mix with the honey.  Put rolls in the oven.  Bake for 10-12 minutes at 400 degrees or until golden brown.  Halfway through the bake, pull the rolls out (keep oven closed!) and brush the rolls with the honey/butter spread, then return to oven.  You really do want the rolls to be golden when they come out so that they are cooked through.  Serve with honey-and-comb (this can get expensive, but feels rather decadent), ricotta cheese or just butter.   Dessert   And here's an excellent Chocolate Mousse recipe.  A little more complicated, but still really easy.  Setting up a DIY double boiler is actually really easy.  It has to refrigerate for at least 8 hours, though!  Chocolate Mousse Serves 5-8, depending on the size of the servings.  Ingredients   4 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, diced 2 tablespoons espresso (liquid, not ground) or very strong coffee 1 cup cold heavy cream 3 large eggs, separated 1 tablespoon sugar   (Optional) Raspberries and extra whipped cream Method  1 Whip the cream to soft peaks, then refrigerate.  The colder the cream and the colder the bowl, the easier it is to whip.  2 Combine the chocolate, butter, and espresso in the top of a double boiler over hot, but not simmering, water, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool until the chocolate is just slightly warmer than body temperature. To test, dab some chocolate on your bottom lip. It should feel warm. If it is too cool, the mixture will seize when the other ingredients are added.  3 Once the melted chocolate has cooled slightly, whip the egg whites in a medium bowl until they are foamy and beginning to hold a shape. Sprinkle in the sugar and beat until soft peaks form.  4 When the chocolate has reached the proper temperature, stir in the yolks. Gently stir in about one-third of the whipped cream. Fold in half the whites just until incorporated, then fold in the remaining whites, and finally the remaining whipped cream.  5 Spoon or pipe the mousse into a serving bowl or individual dishes.  If you wish, layer in fresh raspberries and whipped cream. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours. (The mousse can be refrigerated for up to a day.)"

Cheap_Meals,2rqm4t,dchurch0,5,Thu Jan 8 15:37:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really have any ideas for a starter or dessert, but I do have a kick ass main dish to share with you. It's not super fancy, but it's really good and relatively inexpensive.  This is something that is always at hit with my wife. It has relatively few ingredients, but packs a lot of flavor, and is very easy to make. The recipe below is for one person. So double or triple everything if you're making dinner for your wife or your family, friends, etc.  For this recipe, I prefer using fresh chicken breast from the meat counter at your favorite grocery store or butcher.  Loaded Baked Chicken   1 Chicken Breast 2 strips of Bacon 2 Tbsp Ranch Dressing 1 oz Shredded Cheddar Cheese 1 Tbsp chopped Green Onion   First, set a skillet on the stove and let it heat up. Once it gets hot, cook your bacon nice and crispy, then remove it from the pan and set it aside on some paper towels. Once it is cooled down, crumble it into bacon bits and set it aside for later.  Take your chicken and pound it out nice and thin (1/4 to 1/2 inch thick) with a meat mallet, then season with salt and pepper, or any other spices you'd prefer.  Now throw the chicken in your hot pan and cook it in the leftover bacon grease. While it's cooking, turn on your broiler to get it hot. Low is fine.  Once the chicken is cooked, place it on a foil lined sheet pan. Then smother it with the ranch dressing. Once you have the ranch on, cover everything with the cheese. Finally, top it with your bacon bits.   Now throw the pan into the broiler and let it sit under the heat until the cheese melts and gets gooey. It should only take a few minutes.  Once the cheese is melted, pull it out and let it rest for a few minutes. Then garnish with the chopped green onion, and serve!  I like to make this and serve it with a side salad made with baby spinach and romaine, with some red onions, tomatoes, peppers, and maybe cucumber or other fresh veggies mixed in. You could also make some rice or potatoes to serve as a side if you want to add starch."

Cheap_Meals,2rqm4t,cmbyrd,2,Fri Jan 9 10:27:39 2015 UTC,"For a starter you can't go wrong with bacon and cream cheese stuffed mushrooms and/or cream cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped jalapenos. For a dessert you can do creme brulee/caramel (I'd recommend variations that use only egg yolk and cream as opposed to ones that use the whole egg or even milk). Personally, I prefer the Filipino custard leche flan, which is very similar to creme caramel, but I understand French stuff is more popular just for being French.    For the main, if you want to diverge from chicken, you can always do alternative poultry like quail, goose, duck, or squab, if you can find them, some in asian grocery stores. Personally I'd just brine for 24 hours, butterfly, and roast them after rubbing butter/olive oil and an herb/spice mix on the bird, but more elaborate preparations can be found online. That being said, I like chicken the most and it's the most popular bird for a reason.    If you want something other than poultry, you can make ricotta stuffed shells, with the optional ingredient of nutmeg and/or spinach in the ricotta, with maybe italian sausage mixed in with the tomato sauce or on the side. I think it's fairly easy, even if a bit time consuming."

Save the fat and chop/crush the bacon up finely -2 packages of mushrooms should be enough for the mix. Separate the stems and caps and brush off the dirt. Chop up the stems and fry in the bacon fat along with optional finely chopped garlic -Mix the fried stems, bacon, cream cheese, and as optional ingredients, black pepper and chopped chives. I just get chives from outside since they grow everywhere here. -Stuff the caps with the mix with a spoon and roll the cheese side in bread crumbs(also optional) -Bake at 350F until they ""look good,"" (browned on top and not burned, I'd guess 20-30 min). I've seen some people add wine/water/broth to the baking pan to keep the bottoms from burning or to keep the mushrooms moist, but I don't do this and just bake them on a plain, dry pan. edit: forgot to mention, the fried stems part is optional. Some people do it and some don't and toss the stems. I like both ways, but would fry the stems since I don't like waste, unless they were to be used for stock in another dish."

The brown crunchy in there is just Parmesan cheese melted on a silicone baking mat in the oven (you COULD do it on parchment paper, but I've got a couple of silpats laying around, so I use em).  400*F and about 4 minutes, good to go.  Pasta with chicken can go a number of ways - I'd suggest either an Alfredo sauce, with chicken breast strips, and broccoli; or a super easy rose sauce - add just a bit (maybe 1-2 oz per person) of ricotta to your red sauce and whisk it in.

Then build up layers like a lasagna with things like pan fried zucchini slices, portobello mushrooms, leftover chicken or perhaps italian sausage or hamburger, olives, ect (the basic recipe can be adapted with a lot of different combos of leftover proteins or veggies).  In addition to the bottom sauce layer, try to get another sauce layer in the middle and one on top (sprinkled with parmesan), then cover with a layer or grated mozzarella and bake in a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Then switch on the broiler and brown the mozzarella slightly (watch carefully this happens fast).   While the casserole is baking, you can get some garlic bread together to throw under the broiler after you pull the casserole out."

Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,Sondalsta,3,Mon Dec 15 17:51:27 2014 UTC,"Grains are a good way of getting bang for your buck.   Most people are fine with having oatmeal every morning, and that can be a frugal choice given that the price per serving comes in around $0.13. Because the majority of oatmeal is oats and water, it can help you to budget for different ingredients to include with it. It takes very little to make oatmeal delicious, maybe some bulk raisins or condensed milk or a chopped apple. You can keep it healthy by sticking with nuts and fruit, though for both of those you want to look for sales.   Lentils, like oats, are very cheap on their own, something like $0.12 per serving, and can easily be dressed up. I like the simple onion, celery, and carrot combination, maybe with some chicken stock you can get on sale.   Brown rice is another great grain, coming in at around $0.37 per serving, which can be eaten with an egg or cooked with mixed vegetables.   Moving on from grains, eggs generally run around $0.20 per egg (look for sales, a dozen eggs can get below $2.00), which means you can get a three egg omelet for like $0.60 that will supply you with a decent amount of protein.   Canned tuna and salmon have been converging lately, price wise, at around $0.75 per serving, and both have generous servings of both protein and healthy fats. I'm a big fan of tuna salad, which is a can of tuna with a little mayonnaise, some dill relish, chopped red onion, served on as much spinach as you can manage.   I've recently been really into canned pumpkin, which ends up around $0.75 per serving. I mostly make soups out of it by mixing it with a little broth/stock and some vegetables. It's perfect for colder months.   Baked sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods, and they generally only run about $0.55 each. I especially like them as a side to baked chicken thigh.   There are a whole host of green vegetables that you can get for relatively cheap. Spinach is my go-to, but you can go with kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts (sometimes), and romaine. Eating cheap doesn't mean skipping eating healthy, it's best to find a way to do both.   I'd avoid things like chips, sodas, and eating out. Preparing your own food helps to keep costs down and prevent you from eating empty calories."
Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,graphictruth,1 point,Mon Dec 15 22:51:57 2014 UTC,you gave me so many good ideas!!!
Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,suckish,3,Sat Jan 3 19:23:51 2015 UTC,Are you at your parents' house and do they have normal staples to start meals with?   Pasta? Beans? Condiments?
Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,bluepanda8,5,Mon Dec 15 04:05:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah. They don't have pasta, beans, and condiments, but they do have a lot of rice. (We're Asian btw)"
Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,tftpboot,2,Mon Dec 15 04:09:07 2014 UTC,"And a good rice cooker, I bet. Probably lots of great kitchen stuff. :)  So right away, Rice with Beans, (personally, I prefer black beans) Rice with Olives (canned black olives,) and of course - rice, plain.   Drain and rinse canned beans, with the olives, use the liquid as part of the water for the rice. (I bet you will find yourself making this for your parents as a side dish.)  Leftover rice (of any sort) is one of the most useful leftovers there are. Simplest is to mix a cup of leftover rice with a little margarine and a couple of eggs and some spice (siracha, salt and pepper) and form it into patties. Fry on a medium griddle until brown on either side.  If it's a good rice cooker, it makes soup. So get some potatoes, a bag of yellow onions, a bag of carrots, celery and some beef bones or stew meat. Make some stock to start with and then you have something to share with /r/ramen.  Once you've done that, dice up the potatoes, throw them in and walk away.   And at least once... Spam Musubi!"

Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,Dcm210,2,Mon Dec 15 14:50:22 2014 UTC,"Potatoes! Rice! Beans! Chicken! Eggs! DONT FUCKING DRINK SODA, DRINK WATER OR TEA  Spices Spice Spice!!!  Cheap Meats! The store should have things on sale, only buy those, but stay away from Cow based meats, they are super expensive now for whatever reason. Chicken breasts will go a long way.    If you need to feed yourself for a Month and have no experience cooking, learn the basics. For example, learning how to oven chicken breast with a simple seasoning of rice and pepper will prepare you to make more complex dishes (like baking a potato to eat with the chicken)  Once you know how to make basic things in the oven, move to the stove! Cook some veggies in water! Also finding things you like to eat and learning how to make them will make your life a million times easier. But please don't try to make something super complex when you're a novice and then get upset because it didn't come out the way it was when you had it at ""Super fancy restaurant""  Good luck!"
Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,Dcm210,2,Mon Dec 15 23:35:29 2014 UTC,"Make spaghetti sauce out of canned whole tomatoes and about half an onion.  Chop the onion, cook it down a bit in some oil.  Add the whole tomatoes and cook that down for about 30 minutes.  Mash up the tomatoes.  Add some butter at the end if you have it.  It's my daughter's favorite food and we're not on a budget.  Save the other half of the onion for something else.  Like lentils.  Lentils are cheap and unlike beans, they cook in less than an hour.  The recipe is on the label, usually.  Use leftover rice to make scrambled eggs.  Heat the rice up and add the eggs.  Drizzle any hot sauce.  Buy a big styrofoam tray of chicken thighs on sale.  Delicious roasted at 400 degrees with plain with salt and pepper.  Use soy sauce and sugar to make teriyaki sauce, cook in that.  Buy a small can of Mexican hot sauce (Ro-tell and el pato are two brands)  and dump over chicken and cook for a long time (40 minutes or more) until the chicken starts to fall apart.   Tortillas are cheaper than bread and they last a long time.  They taste much better heated, kinda pasty if eaten cold.    Roasted veg are delicious and can be cheap, depending where you live and the stores you have access to.    Roast at 400 degrees with a little oil and salt and pepper.  They can be added to eggs, lentils, rice. Baking potatoes are really filling and simple.  Same with sweet potatoes.    Some stores sell spices in bulk and you can buy small quantities.  Might be worth it to get 30 cents worth of Italian seasoning, etc."

Cheap_Meals,2pbaku,LakeWashington,1 point,Mon Dec 15 16:06:30 2014 UTC,"Chicken Leg Quarters are really cheap, you can get them in preseasoned packs of 4 and separate them before you freeze them so you can just take out one or two.  You can do this same thing with all different kinds of meat.  Honestly, my wife and I eat pretty damn well for an average of about $9 per meal, so that stands to reason that you could eat for $4 per meal or less.  And those are just good meals, like chicken fried steak, or just steak, we eat a lot of shrimp, etc.  If you go the beans and rice route a few days that'll cut your budget even further.  I would say that you should write down 10 things that you can cook 3 times during the month for dinner, and cook those.  The more you buy the cheaper it is, so buying 10 things you'll eat 3 times is going to be way cheaper than trying to buy 30 different meals or some shit.  And some of the recommendations here have like no variety or flavor.  Eat eggs or oatmeal for breakfast like others suggest or potato and egg tacos or a bunch of other cheap breakfast shit that there is and your leftovers, ramen, and sammiches for lunch."

Cheap_Meals,2oyk9g,9babydill,1 point,Fri Dec 12 00:52:06 2014 UTC,"Like a shop that sells spices, I'm pretty lucky because there is a shop that sells a whole load of spices in little bags that are about a fifth mof the price of the ones that come in jars, like the Schwartz ones if you have them where you are. Spicesofindia.co.UK do a selection of spices at cheap prices if you look through  I just did a search of cumin and paprika and both can be found for cheap. Delivery charge is 3.95 which is a bit steep but if you get 35 quid worth of spices then it is free - I'm only writing this bit because I think its no longer a cheap meal if the recipe requires you to travel to the next town over to get some cheap spices or something.  The liquid in the pan does look pretty greasy I agree with that but there is a lot of water in it too, and its the water that keeps the tempreture down which is why you need to get rid of it before the meat will brown properly.

Cheap_Meals,2o420w,slowmoballoon,2,Wed Dec 3 08:50:33 2014 UTC,"Oh dear god, no.   If you want to not be lonely, you need a pantry that is not sad.  Keep the ramen - but you might do better (and it will taste better) if you buy plain blocks of ramen and then build the broth from bullion or stock paste.   Eggs. Everyone else said eggs, I will repeat that. Egg salad, potato salad, chicken salad - all your classic side and sandwich salads are cheap and easy to make.   Keep the beer, too. But let us remember that better shopping permits either more or better beer.   Ditch the pre-sliced bologna. Ask the butcher if they will slice up a boneless ham for you if you buy one. Most places will. Portion and freeze most of it. And take a look to see what other meat in log form there is. My favorite place sells bologna, salami, pepparoni and summer sausage in foot long four inch logs. I generally go for the summer sausage. :)  (keep your freezer full, it will run cheaper. Ice cubes, if nothing else.) Every loaf I make - well, it has to be a damn fancy loaf to cost more than a dollar.  If you are really into sliced meats - well, a kitchen slicer is a good investment. Often found on Ebay or in thrift stores. I use mine to slice meats AND bread. See also bread machine. And yes, it makes damn tasty white sandwitch bread. I'm munching a slice dressed only in margarine right now, I have a new multigrain loaf in the machine.   A bread machine will make pizza dough. Get a pizza stone if you can, or just build it in a cast iron frying pan. put whatever the hell you want to eat. It's at home, nobody's going to yell at you for using condensed cream of mushroom soup as pizza sauce. (Goes really really well with roast beef and chedder toppings.   Got a microwave? If you have a microwave you can bake potatoes. Mine will bake two glorious fluffy russet potatoes in about 20 minutes. Slice, drench with butter salt and pepper, sprinkle with cheese and bacon bits and feel smug.   Crock pots are a great idea. So is sous' vide. If you turn feeding yourself into a hobby you will make it into something worth doing, as opposed to a chore - and you need to be amusing yourself somehow.  For a reward, here's how to make something deligious enough to compete with those totinos pizza rolls, in your oven.  YOu will need a couple of cookie sheets.  Grab a box of puff pastry from the frozen food aisle. Find something like a pirogi maker.   Put together a paste that includes all your favorite things. Cheese, crushed olives, say. siracha. whatever.  Baked mashed potato is a good binder. Put a teaspoon of it in each pocket, roll it closed and shove that in the oven. 375 ought to do it, keep checking. Make sure everything in the filling is already cooked and there won't be any problems with it killing you.   (all the leftover dough should be thrown in too on a separate sheet - they make delicious odd shaped cookies.)"

Some suggestions (as an older single mom with kiddos, but who doesn't have a tight shopping budget, but has maternal instincts for you kicking in):  Keep the beer.  Ditch the white bread and get wheat (yes, it's more expensive, but there are always store brands that are just as good and more budget friendly).  Keep the ramen, but ditch the seasoning pack when you make it.  It's beyond bad for you, and salt and pepper season it just as well.  Add generic brand frozen stir-fry veggies (buy a large bag. Scoop out approximately 1/4 cup for each ramen packet.  Throw in right as water boils.  Your noodles and veggies will be done at same time; so much healthier).  Buy rice, even if it's just white instant, but brown is better (and it's really not any more expensive than white).  Kudos on the large pack of chicken breasts!  Baked chicken breast on rice is a classic and healthy dish and easy to prepare.  Or, slice up a breast, use about a half cup of those frozen stir fry veggies and make a quick stir fry.  Add some rice as a side.  I see hamburger meat.  Buy some $1 generic wheat spaghetti noodles plus the generic brand $1 can of spaghetti sauce.  Voila!  Spaghetti to go with that french bread I see down there.  If you can't afford parmesan, no prob.  Buy a small block of cheddar.  It's generally the cheapest cheese there is (in my area, I'm sure it's different elsewhere because that's the way food in the U.S. works).  Yeah, it's not how it's supposed to be done, but it's good.  Or, you know, eat it without cheese.  Also good.  And, finally, as suggested somewhere else, crock pot.  Purchase one.  It will pay for itself in about 2-3 meals.  Splurge once a month on a small pot roast and some fresh carrots, potatoes and green beans (frozen instead of canned).  Cook it, portion it out, freeze it and you've got pot roast and veggies for several meals.  Also, a crock pot is a lazy cook's dream.  You can whip up what seems to be a labor intensive meal by just dumping it in the crock, setting it on low, walking away and coming back 2-3 hours later (or longer, depending) to an unbelievable meal.  There are tons and tons of single-man's despair options that are 100x better for you on a budget of $89/week.  And, the added bonus!  If you keep some of those above options on hand, when you do nab a chick you can easily impress her with your wonderful cooking skills and show her you're a savvy guy who knows how to take care of himself and that translates (to her) into you can take care of her, too!  No matter how independent, women love finding a man who respects her independence but can take care of her if she needs him to."

Sprinkle a generous amount of Cajun seasoning to taste. Salt if your Cajun seasoning doesn't already contain it, preferably sea salt (I use Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, no extra salt needed).  Heat in a fry pan with olive oil over medium heat until outside is crispy and inside is soft.  I don't remember the exact proportions off the top of my head, but a mix of chick peas, carrot, onion, garlic, potato, chicken (unless you want something vegetarian), and either chicken or vegetable broth can make a great (and easy) soup!"

You can cook a bunch of meat in the oven and stick it in the fridge, and then sear individual pieces when you want to eat them and they won't taste like leftovers.   I usually do it at 250 and flip the meat a few times because the baking sheet will heat the bottom more than the top.

Cheap_Meals,2lz5qp,Jaberkaty,14,Tue Nov 11 20:14:38 2014 UTC,"Ok OP, you are going to go next level on this. You also are gonna want a box or two of these.  Turkey  This is how you are going to make that turkey. Brown that shit on the hot plate. You might brine the turkey first. Figure out who makes doughnuts in your area, they get their glaze in a food safe bucket you can throw that turkey in with brine to refrigerate if you have to.   Dressing  You are gonna use grandma's recipe for dressing (ignoring the stuffing part):  Turkey Dressing ""Mollie Gordon"" Style    Bread 1 lb. per 5 lb. turkey  Sausage (smoked) 1 lb. per 15 lb. turkey  Celery- 1 stalk  Onion- 1 large  Parsley- 1 small bunch  Chicken Broth- 1 can  2 eggs    Dry bread in a large bowl for several days and break it up into small pieces. Cook the sausage, liver, heart, gizzard in water for 15 minutes (If the sausage has a casing peel it off after cooking)and chop it up in a food processor. Chop celery, onion, parsley. Mix all together adding broth from sausage etc, eggs, and can of chicken broth and seasoning. Clean turkey, stuff, and close with lances. (Or do as I do, place a spoonful in the bird and cook the rest in a large pan on the side, this is foodsafe.) Salt skin. Roast turkey for 4 hours, bast every 15 minutes after turkey browns, lay cloth over skin. Extra dressing should be roasted for one hour separate from turkey.   You might have to do it in 2-3 batches at 4 hours in the crockpot or so, but that shit will turn out stellar like that and it reheats amazing.   Mashed Potatoes   Peel, pressure cook, butter, heavy cream and mash that shit. Shouldn't be hard. Do this ahead of time, tie the liner and refrigerate. Microwave to serve.   Gravy   You can use a pan on the electric griddle to reduce the turkey juices. Add a corn starch slurry. Go!   Broccoli and Rice Stuff   Make this. It's stupid good and easy.   Pumpkin Pie   Make this. I made it when I bought pumpkin for mead making. It also is ultra yummy.   Rolls   You can knead these by hand and should. If you do not, I will consider you weak and less of a man/woman/inanimate object/cis-walrus."

You could do them spatchcocked if your toaster is really small.   I always do a mashed potato stuffing. Fry onions, and celery with summer savoury and sage in the griddle, then mix with boiled or microwaved potatoes and move to slowcooker to keep warm.   Squash turns out great in the microwave. Cut into cubes and microwave, covered, until soft. Then mash with butter and cinnamon.  I like a second, green veg for big dinners, too. Brussel sprouts are seasonally appropriate, and google says that they cook really well in a slowcooker. I think I'd try one of those recipes.  For dessert, always pumpkin pie.

Cheap_Meals,2kvky6,illiadria,2,Fri Oct 31 17:09:10 2014 UTC,"They definitely have to be cooked.  Soaking is optional, though it decreases the cooking time.  I don't have a pressure cooker so I can't speak to how the methods compare, but I prefer to do my beans in the crockpot vs. on the stove.  It takes longer, so it requires more planning ahead.  The big bonus for the crockpot for me is that you don't have to worry about keeping up with water evaporation...  Many times I've gotten busy with other things and ruined or almost ruined a pot of beans because they got two low and burned to the bottom.      I freeze the cooked beans in incriminates of 1.5 cups (the equivalent of one can of beans) with some of the cooking fluid added back to protect from freezer burn. Cool them completely, and put them in a ziptop freezer bag and freeze flat.   I used to use plastic containers, but freezing makes them super brittle and they ended up scattered in the depths of the deep freezer due to being harder to contain... I now have a bin in my deep freezer that I stand the flat frozen bags up in once they are frozen."

Cheap_Meals,2kvky6,stoph_link,2,Sat Nov 1 00:38:35 2014 UTC,"This woman doesn’t know her beans.  Old beans “work”.  They just take longer to do it.  I put aside several quart canning jars full of dried black beans during the great bird flu scare of 2006.  Last year I decided it was time to use them, and I found that 7 year old black beans take something like 45 minutes longer to cook than new black beans.  Anyway, I had more black beans than any normal person would want and I had at them.  Here’s a spicy black bean recipe that I came up with:  Refried Black Beans This yields about 2 ½ cups of refried beans.  1 cup dried black beans  3 cups of water  A tablespoon and a half of ground cumin  1 tablespoon and a half of chili powder  1 teaspoon oregano  Crushed red pepper to taste (I think I use around 1 tablespoon.)  A liberal dose of garlic powder, or maybe 4 or 5 diced cloves  Salt and soy sauce to taste  First, sort through the beans for small pebbles.  It’s gotten pretty unusual to find any in the last few years, but it still happens and a minute spent looking for stones beats the alternative method of finding them, which usually involves breaking a tooth.  Rinse the beans under cold water and salt lightly, like you are salting a piece of chicken.  But go easy on the salt because black beans love soy sauce… soy sauce and cumin.  Next, add the cumin, chili powder, and crushed red pepper and pour in the water.  It will take about five minutes to come to a boil in a covered pot.  Reduce to a slow simmer, and set a timer for 1 hour and 5 minutes.  When the timer goes off, check to make sure that you have enough water left, then restart the timer.  After the second time the timer goes off the beans should be far enough along for a taste test.  They will be spicier, but less salty than the finished product.  If I’m sure that they need more salt I add soy sauce.  Now is also the time to add the garlic and oregano.  The beans should be just barely covered with water.  If they’re not, add more water.  Reset the timer for 20 minutes and continue.  Turn the heat off after the timer goes off the third time, taste the beans, and let them sit in the covered pot for maybe another 20 minutes.  I mash them in an oiled cast iron pan over a flame.  A large spoon may not be the best tool for the job, but that’s what I use.   Adjust the heat as you go so that you cook the mixture down as you work it into a paste.  When almost all the beans are mashed, and the spoon leaves dry spots in the pan that don’t fill back in on their own, you’re done.  It takes me about ten minutes.  Total time is about 3 hours, with about 20 minutes of hands-on time.  I use these as a taco filling and as a base for a stir fry sauce.  For the sauce I mix the bean paste with just a little less water by volume.  For a single serving I use about ½ cup of beans and mix with a little less cold water by volume, and about a level teaspoon of cornstarch, and a fair amount of soy sauce.  My go to stir fry vegetables are onion, green pepper and green beans seasoned with garlic.  Serve this over a bed of rice, and the beans and rice make a nice, complete protein.  I haven’t used it as a dip, but I think it would make a good one.  For a dip I would add maybe some diced onion and a little acid from lime or lemon juice, or vinegar.  Edit:  About that rice…"

I mixed in the last crumbly bits with my rice, and that really worked well - helped to mellow out the flavors and really opened up the dish.  Thanks for sharing!

Cheap_Meals,2j7pde,mg392,2,Wed Oct 15 13:21:31 2014 UTC,"It's the student way of doing things, typically British. It's what I do and I haven't been a student for years. Always cook pasta the same way... Put pasta in pan, boil kettle, add hot water when boiled, turn on the hob haha. A lot of brits generally don't cook before they get to university, at which point they have to cook for themselves every day. At which point pragmatism is the order of the day [and pragmatism tends to define student cooking, even with those who know how to.]   At uni I would eat home made vegetarian pizzas [cost about £1.00 per pan-sized pizza], smaller than a large pizza but with a mozarella/cheddar stuffed crust, wholewheat flour base, generous amount of tomato-puréé, a mozarella top with onions/peppers/sun-dried tomatoes, with olive oil drizzled on top, crushed black pepper sprinkled and italian herbs also. It was to die for, and didn't cost a dime. Also stuffed you fit to burst. My only problem was that I often used too much dough for the base, so would quite often barely be able to get up the stairs. At times I'd use sliced meat [like parma ham, or pepperoni] on top. I'd probably go for a thin-crust now, mind. My student meals were always humongous, but never really wallet-busting. Most of my money went on smoking the ol' reliable - My dietary regime was defined more by smoking than food [even though I was never really without and did eat well.] In the morning I'd smoke a spliff on my doorstep with a fat cuppa, then after a short while amble off down the road to see my classmates and some Rasta friends. Cue more shenanigans and Reggae music. At home I'd spend most of my time mixing drum and bass.   The third year wasn't as great, since I moved to another area. I still smoked a lot, but my house-mates didn't, which made things quite awkward at times [even though they were friends and I did like them.] My best friends had either moved out of the City or abroad. My Rasta friends had moved to Manchester :< And though I'd often visit the little Rastafarian hub a few miles away from where I was living, it wasn't the same. Alas!  Maybe someday, I'll move out of the shithole where I'm currently living - and away from these trashy housemates [old foreign men who stink like shit and cook the devils own britches for dinner] - and into a place of my own. There I will live the life I left in the second year of university, with a few improvements thrown in. It wouldn't be too bad ;)"

One thing I've been enjoying with 'scrambled' eggs is to stir the whites in the pan until they're cooked how you like them, and then pop the yolks and cook 10-15 more seconds until they've just barely solidified. They never get the dry taste of the yolks over-cooking and the whites aren't goopy either. It's a little more work though!"
Cheap_Meals,2ikn5m,amdrag20,7,Tue Oct 7 16:35:47 2014 UTC,"Recipe is as follows and yields ~5, 1/2 cup servings and each serving comes out to about $.44 each!   3 small avocados (got 4 avocados for $1.50 at my farmer's market) 2 hard boiled eggs (dozen eggs for $1.50 as well, 1/2 dozen = $.75) 4 hard boiled egg whites 1 tsp mayo (on hand) some onion (however much you want) (I used a half of a sweet onion, cost was ~$.33) mustard, rosemary, salt and pepper to taste (all had on hand)   Directions  Peel your avocados and boiled eggs, combine with all the other ingredients and mash them up in a mixing bowl.   Each serving (not including your vehicle of delivery to your belly) comes out to about 200 calories! Super awesome!

Cheap_Meals,2ikn5m,Karukatoo,1 point,Tue Oct 7 20:16:33 2014 UTC,"They should give under a little pressure from your fingers, but not feel mushy. About the stems, there a little brown node at the top that you can easily take off. If underneath is brown it's too ripe. If green it's good (as long as it's not too hard.) If you can only find hard avocados put them in a brown paper bag for a day and don't refrigerate them, and then check them again. If still hard repeat another day, etc. Usually 3 days is the longest you'll have to wait. It's hard to explain how it should feel (I used to have to use avocados daily at my job so I got really good at knowing which ones were perfect) but basically you apply a little pressure with your fingers. It should give but that pressure shouldn't leave a mark. Mushier ones are usually brown in the middle. You can still eat them but they don't taste as good. If all brown they're not even worth it."

Cheap_Meals,2i8khj,umami2,11,Sat Oct 4 00:28:11 2014 UTC,"Wow, I just typed out how to do it. Hit backspace to delete something and I lost everything. I'm gunna give you a quick rundown.  If its 1 room and I have no kitchen then I need a minifridge and electric pressure cooker at bare minimum. ""/"" means I would buy one of the following. I would buy chicken quarters/smoked hamhocks, lentils/splitpea/rice/beans, cauliflour/broccoli/cabbage, frozen spinach/fresh kale. sweet potato/regular potato (I would prefer sweet potato for the beta carotene). Buying this stuff in bulk with a friend and swapping would be ideal.   Mixing and matching those would give me an optimal meal for dirt cheap. Plus I'm not always eating the same thing over and over. I might splurge and buy a bulb of garlic and a couple of onions if I had money left over.   The pressure cooker is a hotplate for searing and pan frying, but you can also make soups and stews or braises that take 20 minutes. The flavor is also better and it doesn't use a lot of electricity. Simple for someone who has no time, patience or talent for cooking.   You could make a ton of different recipes for that. All of it fresh, non processed, healthy. I know fruit is missing, but given all the leafy greens, cabbage, sweet potatoes there I don't think your body would miss it one bit.   Even if it isn't one hundred percent I just gave you a viable food plan that you could cook in a bathroom if you had to. And a month's grocery list comes out to less than some middle class people spend on one dinner for two at PF Changs.   Edit: I just realized that $3 a day is 93 bucks a month. You could easily buy everything in my grocery list all together. You can even buy fruit and a lot, lot more. I wouldn't buy stuff like sugar or bags of flower though. Again, I try to keep the processed foods and unessesary carbs to a bare minimum. I find that my body craves junk when I put junk into it."
Cheap_Meals,2i8khj,umami2,4,Sat Oct 4 02:17:17 2014 UTC,"I would say ""rice cooker"" - but that's because I haven't tried an electric pressure cooker. I make soups and stews with my fuzzy-logic unit, along with rice, the universal staple.   But I'm going to mention one more appliance that's worth grabbing - and often found in thrift stores. A small George Foreman style grill.  That allows you to grill meat - but it's also a great way to cook bannock, even if you don't have an oven. So there's your breads."
Cheap_Meals,2i8khj,DrTinyCat,4,Sat Oct 4 02:53:15 2014 UTC,"An electric pressure cooker has a ""browning"" feature that lets you sear meat just like a George Forman grill would.

A pressure cooker also does everything a rice cooker can do, but can cook a chicken quarter from raw to fall off the bone tender in 15 minutes. Potatoes take even less."

Cheap_Meals,2i8khj,RinaWithAK,2,Wed Oct 8 19:27:29 2014 UTC,"I actually spent about two months living on $21 a week ($3 a day), and got my budgeting down so perfectly that I was actually eating steaks for dinner for the last two weeks. The trick is to partition things into macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, sugars and lipids. I wish I still had the numbers that you actually need, but basically I would shop for each of these specifically starting with proteins, then sugars, then carbs. My lipids I got from buying cooking oil/butter, which lasts a long time in your pantry/fridge. In fact, I technically only bought butter once the whole time, and actually found an unopened cooking oil gallon (call me a cheater if you want). Proteins I got from a meat of some sort 5 days a week, then a can of beans for the other two days. Sugars I usually got from fruit. I would usually doing one piece per day, and found that this was always the hardest. Carbs I got from giant containers of oatmeal that would last two weeks, and a loaf of 99 cent bread that would last one week. Dairy was usually left out, but sometimes I would buy cheese and find a place for it in some meal. Vegetables were usually like fruit, one type and buy a bunch. The lesson I learned is that it's very easy, but you seriously limit your variety."
Cheap_Meals,2i8khj,cmbyrd,1 point,Mon Oct 20 06:16:16 2014 UTC,"It seriously depends on where you live, but you have the principle down and I still use the idea.  Buy in bulk whenever possible - like your oatmeal. I avoid buying bread; I bake.   And since I do, I don't end up settling for the sawdust and air shit.   Start simple - make this up every month. Keep it handy. (Me, I substitute canola or olive oil and drizzle it in while combining. Lots less work and it works just fine.)  This basic can be used to make anything from loaves to pancakes to waffles to cakes to a decent pizza crust. It all depends on the amount of water, whether you add eggs and whatever else.)  Expensive cuts of meat are expensive because you don't need to do much to them. Think of them as ""fast food."" Don't buy shredded cheese. Shred your own damn cheese. Same for slices.   The price drops if you are looking at something that needs to be cooked for several hours. If it's fatty, preserve the drippings. There's your dietary fat. It can go into your biscuits.  Learn to love leftovers. EG, if you are cooking rice, cook two or three meals worth. Now it's an ingredient.   The biggest lesson is that it's really not more expensive to feed two than one, particularly when you consider the time and effort required - cooking, shopping, energy usage, etc.  So I always suggest splitting food costs with a roomie."
Cheap_Meals,2i8khj,LoveEveryday,2,Tue Oct 21 16:43:02 2014 UTC,"I am unemployed and eating cheap, about $3 a day.  I get 1 cabbage, 2 carrots, an onion and a bag of corn. A bag of frozen corn is 99 cents if you get the cheapest bag. Carrots are super cheap. I get the cheapest onions. Anyways, I slice this shit up and store it in plastic containers. Oh - get a dozen eggs and some chorizo.  So, breakfast rolls around. I fill a bowl with all the ingredients except the chorizo and eggs. Heat a small amount of oil in my wok. Once the oil is hot, in go the veggies and a chunk of chorizo. Once that's cooked, one or two eggs. That's breakfast. Quick, easy, cheap. The most expensive part is the eggs, $2 for a dozen. Chorizo is about $1.50 for a package. That is $3.50 per week, minus the almost incidental cost of veggies.   Dinner is different. Spaghetti is easiest and cheapest, but freakin' sauce is still pricey ($2 per jar, which is 2 meals). You can add smoked sausage (6-8 pieces), and a package of sausage like kielbasa will last at least a couple days. I soemtimes get that stale parmesan that comes in the green cannisters, but that's pricey, too. Luckily it lasts a long time.  Sometimes I make tacos ... refried beans instead of meat, spicy rice and ya know I got onions on hand, so ... bam! Tacos.  Then's there's hot dogs! =9  Hot dogs ... I get the 99 cent package of dogs and the 99 cent package of buns. 99 cent cheese product. Mustard. That's 8 dogs, or four meals, for $3 (not including the mustard). You can pimp it up with chili (add corn, too). OR get sauerkraut. A plain dog plus mustard and kraut is pretty good. Two dogs is a decent meal. A can of chili goes a long way if you are just using it as toppings.   If you want a snack, popcorn is about 50 cents a bag ... and water is free where I am.   Here's my fav spicy rice recipe:   You cook up a bowl of rice, about two cups. Stir in a can of ""cream of chicken"" soup, staright out of the can, no water. Make an ""x"" on the mix with Sriracha hot sauce. Stir. It's spicy, yummy, filling. And cheap.  Oatmeal is super cheap. Pancakes are cheap. dairy is NOT cheap. Fake dairy can be cheap. Processed cheese product is close enough to cheese that I don't mind.   So, yeah.  I live in a studio. Not a fancy ""studio"", a small place that has no bedroom. just one big room, a bathroom and a kitchen."

Put two eggs in a round cereal or soup bowl, mix them up to break the yolks. Microwave for around 50 seconds. Throw a slice of cheddar cheese on top. Microwave for another 25 seconds or so. Then you end up with a perfectly round egg patty with melted cheese on it. I ate mine on a whole grain hamburger bun."
Cheap_Meals,2hm1pv,originalityescapesme,3,Sat Sep 27 16:20:56 2014 UTC,It's so easy make amazing microwave cheesy scrambled eggs. You just cook in several small intervals and keep stirring and mixing up the curd style chunks that form. It results in extremely creamy and cheesy eggs that you can spoon out onto toast if you want a sandwich. Beats the hell out of a rubbery puck.

Cheap_Meals,2hm1pv,Scarlet-Vixen,1 point,Sat Sep 27 21:25:58 2014 UTC,"It's almost identical to how I make microwave oatmeal. I let parts of it coagulate and become solid and then break up what has formed back into the rest of the liquidy bit and let it form up again, break, and repeat. I add a small dash of milk, butter and pepper initially but save cheese and salt for around the halfway point. You can keep adding cheese each time before microwaving again for a small amount of time. Every microwave is different, but the main goal is to firm up some of the eggs and then re-incorporate them only to firm it up again. You can also add a dash of cream or creme fraiche and chives if you're extra fancy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hs8dZuzIFs - This is a pretty funny video showing a similar process, but he cooks them initially for too long. You should really break it up and remix it while part of the eggs are still soupy. Also cheeeeeeese. Even plastic cheese works. I'd say cook for 30/45 seconds or so and mix and do it 2-3 more times. You can decide how creamy or firm you want the final product to be. I like it more on the creamy/soft side."

Always toss in a bay leaf or two and some garlic and a 1/2tsp of baking soda with enough fresh water to cover by an inch or so. Simmer and scoop off any foam then leave simmering for about 45min most beans and 1.5 hrs chickpeas.  Also I put the beans in mason jars in my fridge to soak at the beginning of the week.

If you enjoy viewing only a single dimension of things, you could make the argument that's healthy too.  On the other hand, in the real world, eating a high-fat diet means that most of your calories lack a great deal of nutritional density, and you're in all likelihood not doing anything great for your cholesterol levels.

If you're eating the extra calories to get all the things aside from fat that  your diet needs, you're not losing weight nearly as efficiently as you could be.  So also, less than ideal, especially if your reason for eating a ridiculous diet is to lose weight in the first place.  Or maybe you're spending a boat load of extra cash for multivitamins that are actually bioavailable, in order to make up for bad eating habits.

Cheap_Meals,2hcg9q,autowikibot,3,Wed Sep 24 23:40:01 2014 UTC,Gluten is protein
Cheap_Meals,2hcg9q,penguinv,2,Thu Sep 25 03:25:08 2014 UTC,"Gluten:       Gluten (from Latin gluten, ""glue"") is a protein composite found in wheat and related grains, including barley and rye. Gluten gives elasticity to dough, helping it rise and keep its shape and often gives the final product a chewy texture. Gluten is used in cosmetics, hair products, and other dermatological preparations.   Gluten is the composite of a gliadin and a glutenin, which is conjoined with starch in the endosperm of various grass-related grains. The prolamin and glutelin from wheat (gliadin, which is alcohol-soluble, and glutenin, which is only soluble in dilute acids or alkalis) constitute about 80% of the protein contained in wheat fruit. Being insoluble in water, they can be purified by washing away the associated starch. Worldwide, gluten is a source of protein, both in foods prepared directly from sources containing it, and as an additive to foods otherwise low in protein.  The fruit of most flowering plants have endosperms with stored protein to nourish embryonic plants during germination. True gluten, with gliadin and glutenin, is limited to certain members of the grass family. The stored proteins of maize and rice are sometimes called glutens, but their proteins differ from true gluten.    Image i - Sources of gluten. Clockwise from top: High-gluten wheat flour, European spelt, barley, rolled rye flakes.

It will be even better if, when it's done, you take it out and brown it up in a pan a little bit.  If you have any cabbage or lettuce, you could make a kind of cole slaw with the ranch dressing.  I like cole slaw on my bbq sandwiches.  You can do the same thing with the salsa for taco/burrito filling.  Or you could use the celery, carrots and onion, along with the chicken to make soup or chicken and dumplings if you have some flour baking soda (or is it baking powder? I forget which). You may be able to add a cream of soup, if you have any, to that as well."
Cheap_Meals,2hc3z7,BakerBitch,1 point,Wed Sep 24 17:11:33 2014 UTC,"I'd go for a fajita theme, myself. If you have a stovetop put the onions, bell pepper, and even carrot all very thinly sliced in a pan with some oil and saute an a medium heat until nicely coloured. Start with the hardest veggies, first. If you have any spices (cumin, chillies, etc) stir them in and get those flavours going. I've sauteed veg in a crockpot put on high when I didn't have a stovetop available. It just takes longer. You could grill the chicken with a bit of barbeque sauce. Then mix it all together and throw it in some tortillas with a bit of warmed cheese soup (obviously it will need to be heated and thinned to taste). Likewise, you could lifehack a recipe like this or this. I'm a great advocate of working with what you have and adapting recipes. Post pictures if it comes out nice! :)"

Living frugally for me is a challenge I undertake because it makes good financial sense. However, to attempt to apply for it because ""Uncle Sam is going to pick up my bill"" is terrible. SNAP is horribly underfunded, so unless you truly need it please do not apply for it as our funding is short and it can go to help a family. Even with the federal government helping out our states it is short.   Some tips, if you do need SNAP.  We evaluate it by household, so if you live with your girlfriend's parents, relative, friend, or something expect to have to appeal if you want to be approved. Having a written letter if you live in a shared household, but do not get food provided to you helps tremendously. Your household income is what is most important.  If you are having trouble making ends meet with heating, see if your state has a ""heat and eat"" program. Be aware, the Feds are changing this programs requirements so you might have to reapply later. However, there are reduced requirements for heating assistance if you are on SNAP.  You can qualify for many reduced rates for utilities by qualifying for SNAP. In my town (we eliminated county policies) the only proof you need is a photocopy of your driver's license, EBT card (SNAP is administered through EBT), and your utility bill."

I use mine to drive to the places where we get free food at. So yea he needs a better job where we can dump one of the cars and not have these bills anymore. He was in Training and Development and now he installs phones and modems for a small telecommunications company. They gave him a raise because they expected him to live off of 45,000 a year and be able to pay his own gas etc... but none of the places gave us stamps then either and we could not even pay the lights on time. Its a broken system. all they look at is one number we will never get them. So all we can afford is our bills and the cars and gas. We ate better when he had no job and we collected unemployment.

As for the SSI we will not receive anything to help all the copays that we have we were told that again we make too much money ( for everyone its about 4000.00 a year. In that category we end up paying just about 6% of his salary towards medical bills total so not enough to claim anything at tax time. So maybe medicaid might help with some of it but not all of it. We are hoping in time that all the effort that we are putting into the kids that they can all hold jobs and not need to be on SSI when they are adults. SSI suggested that we apply for them when they are teens so that it can help into adulthood. We are hoping that is not necessary as we never know when that might be cut.

You should be able to apply for independence through your financial aid office at school to be eligible for grants and I believe that would make you eligible for other types of financial assistance as well. Also, if you are university student, often the school provides legal counsel for free to students (as long as you aren't suing the university) and at the very least he/she would be able to tell you what steps to take to become independent.

Cheap_Meals,2gqer8,relig_study,2,Thu Sep 18 15:12:26 2014 UTC,"Awesome ideas! Just to add- you can make rice more flavorful by cooking it in homemade veggie broth instead of water.

Cheap_Meals,2gqer8,oldredder,1 point,Thu Sep 18 17:48:37 2014 UTC,"Use steak-rub spices & marinade on chicken or pork. Pour in some water to a baking-ware glass dish & bake. The meat will be more tender than just roasting but it's uncovered in the oven so it's not like it's a slow-cooker.  When I cook chicken I also then take off the skin after it's cooked and later re-cook it on top of fries in the oven so it's like super-crispy chips retaining the spice flavours from the first cooking. The skin that's been to moist from sitting in the liquid I usually just throw out. I cut the crispy skin to chip-size pieces before 2nd baking using kitchen-scissors. Almost any excess fat still on the skin just helps the fries cook, have better flavour & then the skin's lost it all so it is very crispy. Takes some practice to not overcook (burnt) or undercook (not crispy enough).  I pour all the liquid off into a pot, put it in the fridge. Once it's slowly solidified there's a layer of fat on top. I lift that off with a fork & dispose of it. I later use what's in the pot for cooking pasta or you can reduce it down to make gravy. Now it has chicken / pork flavour to it so it's really awesome.  Tried it with & without mushrooms, I'd say I prefer with mushrooms but not everyone likes mushrooms."
Cheap_Meals,2gqer8,ChristophColombo,1 point,Sat Oct 4 07:57:33 2014 UTC,"I almost never use the oven.  A couple of my staples (generally larger batches that can feed me for around a week):   Pasta.  Take some ground beef, brown it with onions, garlic, a little oregano and basil, then add sauce.  While doing this, cook your pasta.  Mix it all together when finished.  You can also sub italian sausage for the beef and skip the extra seasonings.  It's simple, but cheap and satisfying.  Makes 6 servings for $6 or less.   Fajitas.  Pound of chicken, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, onion, spicy peppers of your choice (I usually do a de-seeded poblano and a couple of serranos or jalapenos with seeds), salt, pepper, tabasco, lime juice, cumin, chili powder.  Slice the chicken thinly and season with salt and pepper.  Cook it in a bit of oil, then transfer to a bowl and add a couple tablespoons of lime juice.  Throw a little more oil in the pan and add your sliced up veggies.  Season with cumin and chili powder until it smells right.  Cook until the peppers just start to soften, adding little bits of water to make sure stuff doesn't stick.  Throw the meat back in with the lime juice and mix it all together.  Add a dash of tabasco for taste.  Serve with warm tortillas and rice.   Edit: Soups can be really easy.  I just made a pretty awesome potato-leek soup.  For a big pot (6-8 servings): 2 lbs of potatoes, 4 lbs of leeks, 2 cloves of garlic, 6 Tbsp butter, 6 cups chicken broth, thyme, salt and pepper.  Cut up the leeks (throw out the dark green tops) into 1/2"" slices and rinse them in a big bowl (leeks can pick up sand and dirt as they grow - you don't want that in your soup).  Melt 6 tbsp of butter in your pot and throw in the leeks and minced garlic.  Let them sit covered over medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes.  Cube your potatoes into bite-sized chunks and add them to the pot once the leeks are done sweating.  Also add your broth, 1/4 tsp dried thyme, and a bit of salt.  Let it cook for ~15-20 minutes, or until your potatoes are done.  Smash a few on the side of the pot to make sure and thicken the soup a bit.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve hot with crusty bread."

You can make chicken taco filling with that and some salsa. I like pace picante sauce - medium. Cook all day in the crock pot together and then brown in a pan. Or on the stove or in the oven. If there's another cut of meat for cheap, you can use that instead of chicken. Makes great filling for all sorts of mexican food (enchiladas, burritos, whatever)  Spaghetti can be really cheap, especially cooked without meat. Jar of spaghetti sauce and noodles. If you have a WinCo, check out their bulk section for pasta and other things.  Pizza is a great way to use up leftovers. Again, check the bulk section for bread flour and yeast, or the baking aisle.  Or maybe you have some already. Using up leftovers can get pretty boring, but if you have a little meat left, make a pizza with it. A little spaghetti sauce on the dough with some leftover meat and cheese and you've got a pizza.   Saving money is easier if you're willing to cook a little bit. Eggs can be a great bargain. Things like breakfast burritos can be made in bulk and then eaten for breakfast throughout the week. Adding potatoes to them makes them more filling."
Cheap_Meals,2gi6n9,scarbaby1313,4,Tue Sep 16 01:45:15 2014 UTC,"Ramen noodles. By a couple cases, eat them for lunch and dinner. You're young, you'll survive.   With the rest of the money, buy minute steak, its a cheap slice of steak you can grab. Then get bacon, because it makes life worth living in a horrifying ramen noodle wasteland. Then get whatever veggies you desire, I recommend broccoli, corn, maybe some onions.  Cook the bacon, then cook the steak and veggies in the bacon grease. Cook the ramen on the stovetop, IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. Way better than out of the microwave, cook for 20-30 seconds less than they tell you to, so the noodles have a little bit of bite instead of being limp and soggy. Chop up the steak and veggies and separate them into baggies for each meal. Take the noodles out of the broth, throw them in a skillet with a bit of soy sauce and olive oil, then toss in the steak and veggies, toss until delicious.  You might get sick of it after a few days so its best to change things up with some chopped up boneless skinless chicken breast and different veggies.   All in all, you're looking at around $60 being generous, which leaves $40 for two weekends worth of really cheap beer.   Cheers mate."

Cheese is a bonus, now you can make grilled cheese.  Pancake mix/syrup is cheap. A box of pancake mix can make quite a few panckes and/or waffles if waffle maker is available.  Spaghetti is also incredibly cheap, box of pasta, 2x jar of sauce, I like to add about 1 lb of ground beef or ground turkey, depending which is cheaper.  This will probably run about $5-10 depending but if you split the pasta box & beef, you should be able to make it twice, 1/2 box of pasta is quite a bit for two people.

It's the staple food down there.  Oil a frying pan.  Add chopped onions (1), peppers (1), garlic (5 or 6 cloves), and Habanero (1 or 1/2, depending on whether you like spicy or not).  Sprinkle with Cumin, Salt and Paprika.  When veggies are soft, put in 2 cans of black beans.  When beans are warm enough, you have two choices.  1) Eat it with white rice.  2) Put it in a blender. If you have one, definitely go with this. It creates a super savory and amazing black bean mush (more or less the consistency of refried beans).   You can put this on nachos (with cheese), in a quesadilla (also with cheese), in a burrito (with rice, cheese, lettuce and tomato), or with white rice, like was your original intention. You can save this mush in the fridge for up to 10 days, and its just as good when you heat it up so making it in bulk pays off."""

Cheap_Meals,2gcw6t,Gloppy_Sloop,1 point,Mon Sep 15 00:35:52 2014 UTC,"One of our favorite rice dishes is something I call ""Arroz non Pollo."" It's based on the original (Arroz con Pollo; recipe I found somewhere online long ago) in terms of flavors, but without the chicken. You could add beans, I guess, but we actually like it just fine as a hearty flavored rice dish. If you do add beans or chicken, then increase baking time by 10 mins.  1) Combine all the following and mix well:  a) 6 c. cooked rice; garlic salt and pepper;  b) 15 oz. chicken broth (use 2 t. or cubes of bouillon in about 2 c. water); c) 1 can green chili tomatoes (or seasonings plus 2 lg. chopped tomatoes);  d) 1 can (8 oz size) tomato sauce; e) 1 can any cream-of soup (10 oz size); f) 1 c. cheese sauce (can use Velveeta, cheap canned cheese, or even reconstitute from powdered cheese sauce, if you don't make your own); g) 1 T. dried minced onion (or 1/4 c. chopped fresh); h) 1 small can of chopped mushrooms (delicious; if you leave them out, definitely be sure to choose cream of mushroom soup for the option above).  2) Put in large casserole dish (9x13 or larger) and cover with foil. Bake at 325 for 45 minutes.  3) Uncover, add 1 c. shredded cheese on top, and bake 5 more minutes."

I will say it is more on the expensive side for Cheap Meals, because a pound of salmon filets (the cheap farmed kind) can be around $10/lb, and a bunch of asparagus can be $3-4. Most servings of fish I've seen are around 4 oz, so this can save you money if your recipe actually serves 4. It would be easy to bulk up the meal a bit with a side of rice, I am sure that lemon juice/parsley/garlic combo would be awesome drippings for some rice."

Cheap_Meals,2fwk1c,pineapplesRus,8,Tue Sep 9 13:15:52 2014 UTC,"Okay here's what I would do.  If your chicken breast is like, a big honkin' Pamela Anderson size breast, you'll want to cut it in half sideways, like it's a book. This will make it thinner and will give the breast more surface area for deliciousness. Cutting the chicken this way is called ""butterflying."" Once you've cut your breast in half, season it with either salt, pepper, and garlic powder (my go-to), or with your Goya stuff, which sounds okay.   Once you've got your chicken seasoned, get out your soup pot. I like to make mine in a big ol' enameled cast iron pot because it holds heat better, but that's not necessary. Heat up a little butter and a little olive oil in the bottom of the pot, and when the butter stops foaming, add the chicken and wait for it to get brown and yummy. It doesn't have to be cooked all the way through, just some good browning on the outside. Flip them over when they look like they're ready for it, brown the other side, then remove the chicken to a plate or something. You've got this! You're doing great!  Now, you're going to want to cut up your onion, carrots, bell pepper, and garlic. Mince the garlic and cut the other veggies into small pieces about the same size. Keep in mind you'll want all the bits to fit on a spoon when you're done.  At this point, I will usually add the veggies to the pot with all the chicken fat/butter/olive oil/brown bits on the bottom of the pan and cook them a bit. I add onion first, then garlic, then bell pepper, then carrot. I would also hit the veggies with a little salt and pepper too. Let the veggies develop a bit of color but don't burn them.  Once your veggies are a little softer, you're going to deglaze! Remove the veggies from the pot and drain out whatever fat's left - but don't wash the pot. Instead, take it back to the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Then, take a bit of your chicken broth (about a cup) and add it to the pot. Be careful, because it's gonna steam! Take a spatula and scrape all the browned bits off the bottom. That's flava, baby.  Add the rest of your broth and bring it to a boil. While that's happening, cube up your chicken breasts. You can add the veggies and chicken to your slow cooker, then cover it all with broth, and keep it in the slow cooker all day.  When you're ready to eat, you'll want to cook your noodles or rice separately, then add it to the bowl, then ladle the soup on top of it. This way, your noodles/rice don't suck up all your flavorful soup!  You can apply the same technique to just about any soup you want to make. Hope this helps!  TL;DR - Brown chicken, brown veggies, scrape the brown off the bottom, cook noodles/rice separately.  Edit: I forgot you had spinach. I would add the spinach right at the very end, right before you're ready to eat, as the spinach cooks in the blink of an eye."
Cheap_Meals,2fwk1c,person144,2,Tue Sep 9 14:41:50 2014 UTC,"there are a few things ive found which help take chicken X to the next level.   use multiple brands of chicken stock   they all should taste like chicken, but combining different ones help gives  a more rounded flavor   add gelatin to give it a nicer texture   if you had made your own stock using bones you'd already have plenty of this.  i normally buy boullion cubes and add some gelatin.  let sit for a few mins with room temp water, then put it in the microwave to heat it up until it's all liquid (about 20 seconds), then pour in your dish to combine.   use a ting amount of stinky things   like fish sauce.  it's a very disgusting smelling asian brown liquid, but when thinned out and some sugar added, it adds a deep intense flavor.  i recently bought some chicken stock from an asian market and it smells quite bad, but watered down (like it's supposed to be), it's very nice."

Cheap_Meals,2fqkm2,notaspookorgook,10,Sun Sep 7 18:39:36 2014 UTC,"The pizza is a good idea.    Rotisserie Chicken  So is a whole rotisserie chicken which you can eat by the piece or slice for sandwiches or to eat with crackers. A $5.00 chicken will last you a week.  You can take it cold to work, where you don't have a microwave.  Antipasto Plate  Bring a few packages of string cheese or your favorite hard cheese, crackers, sliced cured meats like salami which keep well, and assorted crackers and olives.  This can make satisfying antipasti or appetizer plates with just some beverages.  Totes to work very well.  Protein Breakfast  I'd also hard-boil eggs and bring yogurt, to consume some protein at breakfast (yogurt with some fruit, HB eggs and a few crackers).  Supplement with a box of your favorite granola bars.  Soup or Chili  A large pot of hearty soup, like bean soup or potato soup, will last in your fridge all week and can be microwaved.  Soup is a great breakfast.  Salad Bar Stockpile  Go to a good salad bar and bundle up all the ingredients for various salads, but don't combine them, and don't dress them.  You can get quite a few different plastic containers and put all lettuces in one, all salty toppings (like meats) in another, all wet toppings in one, all dry toppings or crunchy vegetables in one.  The extra containers don't weigh that much so its not really much of a factor in the ""price by the pound"" you may be paying if you go to a commercial salad bar.   By packing separately, this keeps the entire salad portion from wilting down too quickly, and, lets you build a salad during the week as you desire it. Bring your favorite dressing separately.  Breakfast Ham Biscuits  Bake a dozen cheap buttermilk biscuits.  From frozen if you don't bake yourself, or from a can if you like them (they are cheap).  Buy some good deli ham.  Slice the biscuits, insert ham in each one.  Wrap them up tightly -- they keep very well.  Bring mustard or condiments separately or get some packets from the hotel if they have them.  You can have ham biscuits each morning for breakfast, or for lunch.    Ham and Egg Biscuits  If you also made the hardboiled eggs, these are great sliced and added to the ham biscuit.  Makes a breakfast egg and ham biscuit without having to fry the egg.  Fried Chicken  Go to your favorite fried chicken vendor and buy extra value family sized portion. Who doesn't like cold fried chicken?  No one.  Baked Potato Bar  Bake several large potatoes at home, in advance.  Bring some canned chili, beans, or other ready-to-heat items.   Slice your cold potato in half, top with your chili, beans, cheese from your appetizer plate, or stew.   Or just top with some butter pats, salt and pepper.  Heat in the microwave.  Baked potato dinner.  Ghetto Pizza  Bring a package of sliced pepperoni, squeezable pizza sauce, mozz cheese, and use crackers or english muffins.  Assemble and nuke accordingly.  Heat Retaining Lunch Box  Do you have time to invest in a heat retaining lunch tote, like a Stanley lunch container or a Mr. Zojirushi Bento Box type thing?  If so, you can heat your soup, chili, baked potato stuff, and add to your lunch tote and take it to work, where you don't have the microwave.  Get a good lunch tote with cold packs you can keep in your hotel fridge, to keep your lunch at least cool while you're at work.  The savings from not going out to lunch will make up for the investment in a thermal lunch tote with cold packs."

Sometimes I'll mix it up and put a banana or a chunk of chocolate (bars 19p) in my porridge. I never buy meat from supermarket so I know that saves a lot of money. Markets are also a good money saver the fruit and veg stalls in between buildings. pastry/dough and bread I save money on as well because i'll buy a big sack of flour every so often and just mix a mug with water and you can make quite a range of things.

Almost all of my fresh produce comes from street vendors (you know they ones that call out ""tray of bananas £1)   I think 5 meals is fine!

Cheap_Meals,2fo045,Willravel,9,Sat Sep 6 21:09:57 2014 UTC,"Oatmeal absolutely can be a savory food staple. Instead of using milk or water, you can use broth as the liquid you absorb into the grain. Once you've got that, you can go in any number of directions. I find that savory oatmeal goes really well with spinach, mushrooms, cooked sweet onion, bell pepper, ginger, thyme, and basil.   One of my favorite ways to enjoy oatmeal that doesn't involve sweet flavors is warming up oats in homemade turkey stock (itself made from leftover turkey carcass), combined with button mushrooms, a clove of garlic and chopped onion, all sautéed, and some fresh thyme. Add a little salt and pepper and you're ready to go. If you want to go all out, include celery in the sauté, and toss in some butter and chopped sage. It tastes like Thanksgiving and practically nobody knows that the recipe exists.   One of the nice tricks to cheap meals that taste more expensive than they are is just having a few small herb plants in the kitchen window. All they need is a little water, and the occasional nutrients, and you save a bundle."

Cheap_Meals,2fkpcf,schecterjl,22,Fri Sep 5 19:10:25 2014 UTC,"How is it cheaper to buy individual slices of meat rather than a pound of lunch meat? Because it is actually more cost effective to get a loaf of bread (typically ~12 slices) for $3 at $0.25 a slice or $0.50 a sandwich, and to get a pound of meat and half pound of cheese. Each sandwich would be less than $2.50 if you don't include condiments.  Also, I have never considered asking the deli counter for free lettuce, is this something they will do? If so, you can also get free samples of meat and cheese while you are at it, and save money there too."

Cheap_Meals,2eugbi,hartekin,5,Thu Aug 28 21:25:00 2014 UTC,"First of all, this is a great idea. I love that there are people working to make dining on a budget easier. You should definitely look into cross listing this on /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and seeing what the folks there have to say about the nutritional content of the meals/if there is a way to specify low-carb, low-fat, etc.  A couple of ideas: I know this is a sample, but it seems like a lot of the ingredients on the shopping list are one-trick ponies. Is there a larger meal list that utilizes these ingredients? I'm curious what the intended size of this is; i.e. will it be online only, print, or both? Will there be a database style search for what you have and what you can make, a la Supercook.com?  Meats can get kind of pricey/I know a number of vegetarians. Would it be possible for you to include substitutes for certain things, e.g. beans for beef in a taco? I know that many novices wouldn't know what to sub in and out if they needed to change a meal for their or others' palates.  Besides those ideas, yours is awesome. I know how tight budgets can be and a resource to make it all happen is certainly appreciated. Will you be looking into some type of funding for this? Could you pair this with a YouTube cooking how-to and have support via Subbable or Patreon? It may go a long way to getting this thing off the ground and into more people's hands, especially younger folks (the stereotypical YouTube demographic)."

We don't make a big point of using the same ingredients throughout a single meal plan but we do from week to week, so the idea is you can freeze or save whatever you want.

My partner in this is Erin Chase, who runs 5dollardinners.com, and she has a pretty sizable following.

Cheap_Meals,2ena0g,Leebo,1 point,Tue Aug 26 20:03:52 2014 UTC,"well, it does depend on where you get it.  If you get it at a standard grocery store, it's really pricey, but at Trader Joe's it's about half the price (at least in my area) of my local grocery chains and at costco it is even more affordable, but you have to buy a quite a bit, but on the upside it's not just 1 huge lump of cheese, they do come in separate packaging and if stored properly, it lasts for a good while.    I have no idea how much it is at walmart or target or if they even sell it at those stores, I've never even attempted to look for it at those stores.  Whole foods is overpriced, definitely.   It all just kind of depends on where you are buying it.  You can get a good size of it for like 5 bucks, which is great if you are having a party and want to serve appetizers for a crowd that's more upscale or if you're someone like me who likes to make a lot of meals that are all about cheese.  What it mainly boils down to though, is where you buy the mozzarella.

Cheap_Meals,2en53e,SwoleLegs,2,Thu Sep 4 20:22:12 2014 UTC,"This is more a comment about portioning technique. The crock pot will make enough of anything that no matter HOW yummy it is (and it's hard to avoid yummy with a good crock pot recipe), you will become sick of it soon.   So buy some parchment paper and some ramekins - you know, small, oven safe bowls that are for making individual casseroles. Measure and cut your parchment so that it lines the bowl with enough left over to tie with a twist tie. Fill bowls. Freeze. Remove from bowls, tie and seal inside a marked freezer bag.   You now have a microwavable puck-of-goodness.   Most recipes are a LOT easier to make if you make lots - they are just simply more forgiving.   Btw, you can also cook in the ramekins. the paper is good up to 450 degrees, well into the ideal casserole range, so you can also use this technique to make a batch of tuna casseroles. Or a batch of tex-mex mac and cheese. (Mac and cheese with spicy sausage and salsa, hold the milk.)   If you have the room, making up a huge batch of potatos, portioning and freezing is a decent thought. It's great for lunch all by itself, and it's a great ingredient."

Next day microwave a piece of meatloaf until it can be broken up. Cook some instant rice. In another pan fry up some coarsely chopped onions, tomatoes and green peppers. Add this,some soy sauce and the meatloaf to the rice.   .  Next day microwave a piece of meatloaf until it can be broken up. Chop up a potato and fry in with some chopped onions. Add the meat loaf. Serve with canned vegetables and bagged salad.  .  To use the leftover meat loaf and veggies, take that left over spaghetti sauce and add it to equal parts of water along with all the left over meatloaf and veggies and the left over flavor pack from Ramon. This will make a wonderful vegetable soup. If you have any of that mac and cheese or Ramon left, add it too but don't over do it on the Mac and cheese. If you have that much, you have another meal. :)  .  Once you have the meatloaf, none of these meals should take more than 15 minutes prep time. You deserve a good meal once a day. Take time to do at least this much for yourself."

Cheap_Meals,2dwvzi,Moara7,11,Wed Aug 20 21:02:57 2014 UTC,"One of my absolute staple meals in college was steak, potatoes, and frozen veg. I would marinate individual steaks in ziplock baggies, then when I got home from school, I would pop it in the toaster oven for 5 min on broil each side, fill a bowl with frozen veg (corn or peas or broccoli), cover it with a plate, and put a potato on top. Microwave for 4 min, stirring and turning over then another 4 minutes or so depending on the size of the potato.  You could do up a series of chops in marinade for her to cook each night without a lot of prep: steak in red wine and montreal spice; pork in soy and ginger; salmon in dill cream sauce; etc.  Boneless chicken breast would work, too, but needs to be thawed first, and works better on a George forman grill.  Other than that, most stews freeze exceptionally well, and are good served on pasta, with bread or on rice (you can freeze this, too).

It's fine if it's in a stew, where it's been a long moist simmer, but a chop that you want caramel brown on the outside, and just-barely-cooked juicy on the inside does not reheat very well."
Cheap_Meals,2dwvzi,donac,2,Tue Aug 19 20:24:43 2014 UTC,Nice!  Is that broil the steak for 5 mins on each side or 5 mins in total (2.5 mins on each side)?  Does that make well-done?
Cheap_Meals,2dwvzi,PriceZombie,2,Tue Aug 19 16:04:52 2014 UTC,"TBH it's been a few years since I've done this. The timing depends on how thick your steak is, and how thawed out it is, but around 10 min total, should do it.  I was already a good enough cook that I could eyeball when it was half done and turn it. I think that if you put an  inch thick, softly frozen steak (not from a deep freeze) on broil, and turn it when the top is sizzling brown, it should at least be edible. I often had mine more well done than I liked, but I think that was because my steaks were too thin."

If you pursue this you could get some of the freezer slowcooker recipes (throw all ingredients in a bag and freeze).  A decent chef's knife, a wooden cutting board, EVOO, wooden spoon, Tupperware containers a spatula, a large bowl and a recipe book would be the ideal basic set up beyond pots and pans in my book  --optional would be a colander/strainer of some form, a peeler, a mandolin, a whisk, various sized mixing bowls, sheet pan, etc. Each is going to be mostly single purpose, but nice to have on hand for different types of prep.  Spices: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder are about all I think of when speaking of necessary. But if you have dishes you want to recommend/prepare you may get the spices necessary for those dishes so that she can recreate anything she likes.  As for recipes you could make and freeze some pot-stickers or pirogis with a bit of effort.  There are dozens of frozen breakfast burrito recipes out there that are quick and simple.  Steamed veggies served with Oyster Sauce is super awesome and easy and while best with fresh veggies (impossible to screw up baked veggies--just have her search veggie + baked since it's just toss in oil and bake at X temp for Y minutes) frozen could work also. TBSB or so of sauce per cup to cup and a half of veggies--I like to put it on hot veggies straight from the fridge to cool down veggies and make them ready to eat."

Cheap_Meals,2dwvzi,loose_impediment,1 point,Tue Aug 19 12:41:27 2014 UTC,"powder much, is it a good lazy substitute for actually onion?   Not exactly. It gives a bit of onion flavor, but mostly used in stews and soups--and top of garlic bread and other things like chex mix--where you want some onion flavor without wanting chunks of onion. If you've got some on hand take a 1/2 tsp and try it out... definitely not onion, but good on/in a lot of stuff according to my taste palate. Had some on Ramen last night... mmm.   May just be a force of habit for me rather than used that often by other people; it's the slight contradiction that I prefer onions in most dishes, but use onion powder sometimes even when an onion would be better (as in, feeling lazy).   I think granulated onions are closer to substitute... but onions are something I don't think can be substituted very easily. I don't know about others, but onions were where I got the most practical knife practice when starting cooking. Simple yet satisfying."

Grab the recipe off of allrecipies.com but use sourdough starter to replace one cup each of flour and water. be sure to add a quarter tsp of lemon juice too - that makes any loaf better. (One tsp/4 cups is what my flour sack said). I also use olive oil instead of shortning or margerine but they both work fine.  Anyway, mix it together, adding whatever fillers you like. Bannock is generally a filled bread.   don't over work it, just knead it, adjusting until it's neither sticky nor dry. It should feel a little lighter than a biscuit dough would.   Roll it into balls or logs and throw it into your george formeman or your pannini press. It will bake right in there in roughly 10 minutes. (depending on the appliance and power)  It won't hurt to brush the press with oil first.   Yield should be about six sandwich-sized pieces. It WILL be filling. And delicious. You will be envied."

You can make french toast in them.   You can cook scrambled eggs in them, although you end up with an odd egg-waffle.   Some cookie dough does very well in waffle irons.   You can flatten out canned biscuit dough for a waffle iron.   You can even use it somewhat like a foreman grill to make burgers, but make your meat patties thin, and be ready for a MESS since waffle irons don't have the grease drip catcher that a grill would have.

The bacon grease is easy enough to pour out of most waffle makers afterwards and you can save it if you want (I do) for scrambled eggs and such. The waffles will come out super easy in the future and the nice little savor of bacon grease makes syrup taste like nectar of the gods.

Recently decided I can't live off McD's so for the last month-month and a half I've been ringing lunch to work.   Breakfast I make either homemade oatmeal  1/2 cup rolled oats 3/4 cup milk  And then different ingredients  (1/2 cup frozen raspberries, 1/2 cut up banana) Or (1/2 dice apple, cinnamon to taste, 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce, 2 tbsp brown sugar) Mix ingredients, boil, then reduce and stir until most of liquid is absorbed and oats are cooked which is about 5 minutes.   You can kinda just out anything that you like. Little out of yogurt, strawberries, peanut butter, cherries, vanilla extract, cocoa powder. Just mix ingredients that you like or that go well together. The recipes above is for one serving and they fill me up pretty well for a few hours until lunch.   Lunch I've been bringing salad. Growing up I hated spinach but fresh spinach is 100x better than cooked spinach. I fill up a container with enough spinach that I think would fill me up 1-2 cups I guess. A few cut up strawberries (strawberries usually go bad quick for me so I also substitute most of a cup of mandarin orange slices from dole or whoever), slices almonds (or sunflower seeds), some reduced fat feta (tastes no different to me than regular feta especially when mixed with everything else) sliced cucumbers are good though I keep forgetting to buy them and some diced up onions. Then some type of dressing been using fat free sweet and sour dressing and a little bit of light vanilla yogurt.   Again just one of those things where what sounds pretty good. Replace the bits for a different type. Replace the fruit with something similar.... Etc.   I've also bought one of those rotisserie chickens for dinner and used the left overs to make chicken salad. Though it on some bread and it's tasty cold.   These work for me I'm not usually hungry until a reasonable time afterwards I usually have eat at 7 am, 12pm, and 5pm. Hopefully you like the ideas.

But that goat cheese, whoooooo so good.   I also make lunch burritos with chicken (usually but can use beef), veggies, cheese, salsa. Haven't worked my way up to freezing sour cream, not sure if that'll work.   These rock though, take them out of the freezer a couple days in advance to ensure fully thawed by meal time.

Cheap_Meals,2bfaav,syr_ark,5,Wed Jul 23 12:57:51 2014 UTC,"Rice and pasta are dirt cheap and a great way to stretch out other ingredients.  My go to technique is to make a whole bunch of rice, then cook some other shit in a pan and mix 'em together and combine it with a sauce that makes sense.  For example, if I do ground beef, onions, and peppers, I'll use salsa or some other sort of hot sauce.  For chicken, broccoli, snow peas, and asparagus I like to use teryiaki or soy.  It's easy to make a whole bunch at once and use it a couple times over the course of the week.  I have access to a microwave at work, so I like to heat it up before eating, but it's also perfectly tasty cold."

Cheap_Meals,2bfaav,AKBlackWizard,6,Tue Jul 22 20:31:59 2014 UTC,"I just cook everything together, and cook it for the time it takes for the meat to get done, which I find gives everything more flavor.

Cheap_Meals,2bfaav,dewprisms,4,Sun Aug 10 09:59:41 2014 UTC,"Cold salads are always good. Brown rice, canned corn, black beans, a couple spices, and chicken or ground beef go a long way, and they're good hot or cold. If I'm going cold, I usually put in a little italian dressing after its cooled. And it takes almost zero cooking skill, basically just brown the beef or chicken, boil rice, and heat everything up together. You can make a lot at one time for cheap, and it's pretty healthy, tasty, and filling. It's also nice to add salsa, lime juice, or green chilies if you want a little more tang to it. I can make enough for a week in an hour or less and separate it into tupperware, and it's very easy to just stick in your backpack or the office fridge. And while not as cheap, little cans of mandarin oranges are a healthy ""dessert"" if you have a sweet tooth, and also easy to carry around."

It stretches out so far and makes meals a lot more filling. I usually use a slow cooker and pair it with chicken, seasonings, kind of whatever is around, 3-4 times a week. Brown rice lasts fucking forever and will fill you up. I think it was about 5 bucks altogether and after 6 months I still have plenty. And it's relatively healthy. I'm not complaining. Also, look into local co-ops. They usually offer really sweet bulk deals on veggies and staples like oats and peanut butter and whatnot. I put in my order on wednesday, pick it up on sunday, and it's enough to last me a month, at a 55% discount. It took me way too long to learn about it. Great wholesome,local, organic food, and if you go with the big package deals it's a steal. As a college student, it seriously saved my health. I'd spend twice as much on chef boyardee and get fat otherwise. There are plenty of places out there, and while it takes effort to find them, it's so worth it. I spend half of what my friends do at wal-mart and get locally sourced veggies, meat, and poultry. It might not be available in all areas, but it's definitely worth a little google check."

Cheap_Meals,2b91vt,cmbyrd,1 point,Mon Jul 21 02:55:55 2014 UTC,"Great knife for the money  I outfitted the last restaurant I worked at with these, and have one at home as well.  They take a good edge pretty easily, and hold it reasonably well.  Not the best knife I have, but by far the best value knife I've ever used.   Ceramic Rod to take care of the knife.  This one is double sided, one side is coarse, other is fine.  For occasional touch ups, run the knife - spine first/blade trailing up and down the fine side.  I normally do 5x on one side, 5x on the other, 4x each side, 3x each side, 2x each side, 1x each side.  For more serious sharpening, start at 10 on the coarse side, then again on the fine side.  Cutting Board I like these, they don't warp like the thin flex ones, and the rubber on the ends does a good job keeping the thing still on your counter.  I dunno anything about it being anti-microbial, as I wash mine to take care of that sort of thing, but it's a more than serviceable board at a good price.    That leaves you $70 for whatever else.    If you're a poor college student, a slow cooker can be a wise investment.   I'd look for Wok as well.  You ought not to pay very much for a wok, and get one made of carbon steel, not cast iron IMO.  If your place has an electric stove it won't work very well to put a wok pan on it, so check out electric woks.  Rice cookers are also very versatile, and most people can't cook rice to save their life, so their 'intended' purpose is useful as well.  Don't feel like you've got to buy anything new either, yard sales, thrift shops etc can l and you rice cookers and slow cookers for next to nothing."

Cheap_Meals,2b91vt,MerryChoppins,1 point,Mon Jul 21 12:37:01 2014 UTC,I would suggest searching your local Dollar General for just about everything. My local one carries everything needed for super cheap. The only thing you should try to get from yardsells or thrift stores are things like the George foreman grill or toasters. Anything that doesn't plug into a wall should be fairly cheap at dollar general. Their food is cheap as well!
Cheap_Meals,2b91vt,darknessvisible,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:06:24 2014 UTC,What type of meals are you going to be making? Are you more likely to cook as needed or make a family sized batch of something? Think about the foods you want to prepare and start with those utensils and tools.  Where to find them? Garage sales and eBay are great. If you work and it's allowed post a notice or tell your coworkers that you're stocking your kitchen. I mentioned this to the staff in my department before I left for university and got at least half of what I needed.  Edit: Forgot to mention auctions. If you're in an area where auctions are held you can pick up a ton of stuff for practically nothing.
Cheap_Meals,2b91vt,oskymosky,1 point,Mon Jul 21 17:52:07 2014 UTC,"I'll echo the ""buy a slow cooker"" thing. You can get a cheapie on sale for $20 and it makes a ton of good food cheap. Pulled pork/chicken, lasagna, soup, etc.   For a knife, buy two cheap box store or thrift shop knifes that you can easily re-sharpen. Something full tang, forged and not stamped. Both should cost you $10-15. I would say a pairing knife and a chef's knife that is about the length of your forearm. You can buy a cheap sharpening stone and watch youtube and figure that stuff out.   Find a kitchen/restaraunt supply store or Sam's club/Costco (if you have access) and get some cheap plastic cutting boards. A full sheet and two half sheets is basically what I (who is about 20 years ahead of you) use and I just replace them as they get hard to clean (annually) and I can use the remnants for other things around the house. I think I paid $15 for all three last time. Also, while you are there, there are $2-3 rubbermaid silicone spatulas. Grab those things, they are ultra nice. Also, they should have cheap quarter and half sheet pans ($5-10). A half and two quarters serve me nicely. They pair perfectly with your cutting boards, the boards are just enough bigger to cover them in case you need to let something cool or sit out, you can freeze the sheet pans to cool something you are working on the cutting board, and you can do your ""layout"" for baking and then just transfer them over to the sheet pan, etc.   Watch craigslist for a cheap cast iron skillet (chinese is OK) and dutch oven. Flax seed oil is expensive and the current rage, but cheap crisco seasons it perfectly well. If you wait and watch, you can spend $20 on both and it is an incredibly useful tool. You might even get one cheap from an elderly acquaintance that can no longer lift it. I use mine to bake my own no knead bread ($.80 in flour = Loaf of bread), cook good steaks from the local discount grocer (who cuts their own meat and sells a $20 restaurant steak for $4), $.33 in Jiffy Cornbread mix with $.50 in other ingredients makes a huge pan of cornbread, chicken and burger both work well in it, you can fry in both of them. Once you understand it and get it super slick, you can even make eggs/tortas/fritatas. The only thing it's ""bad"" at is high acid for long periods. If you have it seasoned well, you can still throw together a tomato sauce in it and just clean it immediately. Essentially, if you are willing to put in the work on it, it is cheaper and lasts longer than non-stick. You can camp with it, you can put it on the grill, you can use an induction cooker with it, etc.   Spend $5 on box store (walmart) bar towels, they work absurdly well for everything from cleaning your kitchen to draining moisture from yogurt to make dip to draining water from frozen spinach for omettes to purging fresh produce to can or freeze. Similarly, you should spend $5-10 on a cheap wire strainer. It works as a combination of a colander, strainer, steeper, spider, etc. If you are close to a Wilton seller, one of the few things you should splurge on is a thick steel cookie/cake spatula. I use mine for cooking meat in the skillet, for transferring baked goods, for shaping dumplings, etc.   If you are close to a peer 1 imports or bed bath and beyond, both have $2 small ramekins. 4 of those will be workhorses in your kitchen. I use them for custards, serving dipping sauces, I use them as a base for baking and for roasting hams, etc.   If my house burned down tomorrow, this is where I would start over. If you google ""Watch good eats online"" and look for the first result not behind a paywall, Alton Brown will give you further guidance, he uses all of these tools regularly."

Cheap_Meals,2b4gcx,DeathRiderDoom,5,Sat Jul 19 10:13:36 2014 UTC,"Fellow Philadelphian here: where you shop depends on where you're going to be and whether or not you have a car.  When I moved here 2 years ago, I moved to Center City and didn't have a car. Thus,  most of my shopping was at Trader Joe's (owned by Aldi).  I would buy the majority of my groceries there once a week and get specialty stuff at Whole Foods. I would also get bread and dry goods (like dry beans, oats, etc) at WF because they're cheaper by weight there.   After I got a car,  I started taking weekly or bi-weekly trips to the burbs to get the bulk of my groceries. Aldi has stores all over, there's a few in the Northeast that I go to and another in Hatboro (or Abington? Southampton? I dunno these boundaries anymore,  it's somewhere in lower Montgomery County...). And Wegmans is also great if you know what parts of the store to check out.  Go towards the section that isn't nicely laid out, that's where you'll find kitchen staples at good discount prices. There's a Wegmans in King of Prussia, near the mall.   And depending where you are,  don't discount the ethnic food stores or the small Mom-and-Pop stores. The Italian Market is a good place to start, but Washington Ave in general has some great carnicerias and Asian grocery stores that can give you good cuts of meat for dirt cheap,  or spices that you can't find in any other stores.   Last thing: get a chest freezer and stock it when you find a good deal on perishable food items."

Yup, we have a car, but usually when i'm in Center city/South Philly/etc i'm by myself on the trains/walking. SO it's not the best time to shop (unless it's picking up one or two small items for my backpack.  We spent a lot of time around the Fox Chase/Burholme/Jenkintown/Ryers/Rhawnhurst areas, where there are plenty of Shopping Centers, supermarkets and options. I never saw Whole Foods or Aldi out there, though, but surely there are some independent ethnic grocers.   I'm not really familiar with Wegmans. They tend to have discount sections? This sounds like it has potential. I'll try do some searching for ethnic stores in the Northeast.  I'm definitely keen to find a good, cheap meat vendor in the northeast. As i've said, Path Mark had some good specials, but regular prices didn't seem that great.  Thanks heaps for your info :)"
Cheap_Meals,2b4gcx,HaggarShoes,3,Sun Jul 20 05:21:53 2014 UTC,"The produce has short legs on the shelf, but Aldis has probably the most consistently cheap foods both fresh and frozen. Quality of boxed/canned/frozen items is really quite good.  Target is, for fresh food things, usually more expensive to my mind. Sometimes they have good sales on packaged and frozen stuff, but I've only had good luck a couple times with produce/meat.  Depending on bulk preference, Costco/Sam's Club can be helpful for a wide variety of items, but you have to pay for a membership, which may take a while to pay for itself.  Most retailers will put out a weekly ad with notification of sales (if not check their website), and the Sunday edition of most papers will include many a manufacturer's coupon (good at any store)."

Cheap_Meals,2b4gcx,crazybouncyliz,3,Sat Jul 19 10:58:10 2014 UTC,"Avacados, weekly sales of random veggies and fruit, frozen pizza, chicken, you name it. Apart from big sales at other stores, Aldi is about as cheap as I've found in my neighborhood (not Philly) for just about everything. They only take cash or debit--no credit; and you should bring your own bags (and a quarter [refundable] for a cart)--not sure if that's the same everywhere.  The biggest problem is that they don't sell everything one needs. Beer subject to state laws regarding the sale of alcohol.  I assume your best bet is to take a day and visit all the grocers in your area (including Asian markets and 'ethnic' grocers) and get a ball park of what everything costs when not on sale; if you have the time to go to a variety of shops, and the knowledge of what to buy where, to fill a full grocery list it can save you some cash. Even single shopping trips are worthwhile--if I need general produce I go to Aldi's or the Asian Market; I shop around for chicken and have a general meat place that I peruse when needed--I have a baseline of 'it'll be significantly cheaper next week' for most non-impulse buys that I routinely eat."
Cheap_Meals,2b4gcx,crazybouncyliz,1 point,Sat Jul 19 11:18:11 2014 UTC,"In PA you have to get beer from a beer distributor, but that's fine.  Yeah i never got round to visiting the Aldis as there wasn't one in my part of the city. But we do have a car. I managed to shop at Shop Rite once, but couldn't discern the prices from Path Mark, really. Pretty familar with Path Mark the most, an Target.  I definitely need to investigate the Asian Supermarkets or other ethnic markets for certain products. South Street Italian Market in Philly has a good range of those types of places, but it's quite far from where i was living.  For meat i usually ended up with Frozen chickens, turkey bacon, and various pepperonis from Path Market. The specials were good, but not always the regular prices. Cheers for your input"
Cheap_Meals,2b4gcx,crazybouncyliz,2,Sat Jul 19 11:29:54 2014 UTC,"I've lived for nearly 10 years on a financial aid college student budget by shopping at Winco stores and Walmart supercenters. Try seeing if either of these are near you. Also, Safeway is consistently the most expensive place in town in the cities I have lived in. Check the weekly ads tho though that are mailed to you and shop those. Costco is also good for some things, but be mindful of package sizes and your family size. Most things are impractical for a person living alone or just 2 people living together.   A foodsaver or other vacuum packager is nice for buying bulk of meats and cheeses and storing them- I found these to be my biggest sources of wasted food until I got my foodsaver. Also, check if your town has weekly farmer's markets and/or (depending on size) an ethnic discount produce shop (middle eastern in my area). This is usually produce that only has a few days left on it but is very cheap.   Do you know what city/size of city you are moving to and what kind of domicile?"

One tip I can give you is to leave your credit/debit card at home except for when you need to go out and spend money, such as grocery shopping.   Another way to save is to learn how to make your favorite restaurant meals. Subway and Chipotle are pretty easy to mimic and are very cheap to make at home by comparison.  Pasta is very cheap to make at home and really easy and quick, plus you can put leftovers in the fridge for later.

You save so much money not eating out.  2) Buy non-perishable or a lot of frozen foods. Frozen foods last a lot longer.  3) You can pre-cook meals. AKA you can buy a bunch of meat, cook it on sunday, and make 5 meals, then boom, you have five dinners for the week for the price of $20 compared to $50-$80.  Or just eat from the dollar menu."

Eat lots of rice, beans, and lentils -- I don't do this, but I do eat a lot of mexican food, which is easy to make and cheap, so its a comparable strategy. Shop around for sales, use coupons -- the time investment in doing this isn't worth it.  I just go to Kroger. Drink lots of water -- It's all I drink aside from the occasional ginger ale or Sierra Mist (which I never buy as part of my groceries).   I will also add:   Don't eat a lot of meat.

A few tips I can think of:   Any site or app that makes it too easy to order food, get your credit card number off it and block the sites. Even a promise just to call it in might stall the process.  If you haven't already frozen (NOT CLOSED - trust me) your credit accounts, do. Like literally right into the freezer. Cash only when if ever you eat out. Remember some places requiring tipping.  Parties and venues, buy a bottle to keep at home and flask it. Some people think this is gauche. Screw some people.  Bulk buy, and bulk cook. I feel ya, it takes energy every day to fix meals three times a day. But if you set aside one day a week to make and freeze things, it's sort of jolly.  As someone else mentioned, a cheat day might work. I think a cheat luxury item that can be eaten for weeks is best, like a really excellent cheese or sausage.    Don't worry! You'll figure this out."

Cheap_Meals,2b2tpq,carbonx,3,Mon Jul 21 02:57:45 2014 UTC,"Shop your kitchen! Spending that much on food each month means you definitely have some things in the pantry and freezer that can make good healthy meals!  I used to go out and party a bunch and decided to stop for my budget and waistline. However what really helped me was buying at the liquor store and drinking at home with my boyfriend. If I'm not in the social and competitive binge drinking bars I used to frequent I only have a drink once or twice a week out on the porch looking at the sunset or stars.  Restaurants are killer cause they seem like such an easy solution and everything comes out tasty most of the time. I know that being out a job it's easy to want to get out of the house and go somewhere but my recommendation would be to go to the park or pool after lunch. That way you still can enjoy places that aren't home without the temptation of eating out.   Stay strong, you can do it! It might take a couple months but even if you can get it down to 325 a month that is a fourth of what your spending now and would be a good first goal."
Cheap_Meals,2b2tpq,vonmonologue,3,Sat Jul 19 01:10:30 2014 UTC,"Glad you came by! As other people have said, $150 per month is totally possible, but it will (as you guessed) require a lot of changes from your current habits. The biggest one is that you'll need to do your own cooking very nearly 100% of the time. This will probably pose a couple of challenges:  1) It takes planning. At the end of a long day, when you're exhausted and stressed, the last thing you'll want to do is chop vegetables and watch a pot boil. If there's no food ready to go in your fridge, it will be extremely tempting to stop at Subway.  You can solve this problem by batch-cooking several meals over the weekend when you're rested. Take a few servings out of the freezer at a time (a day or so in advance of when you plan on eating them), and you never have to cook on weeknights. Plus, if you batch cook a couple of different recipes at once, then you don't have to eat the same thing multiple days in a row.  2) It takes skill. Fortunately, learning to cook is awesome! There's a satisfying thrill in experimenting with new ideas and satisfying a basic human need artfully. And it feels so cool when you can go by the grocery store, get $30 worth of exactly the right things, and then whip together something amazing that lasts all week.  Check out frugal cooking blogs like Casual Kitchen (I especially like their list of ""Laughably Cheap"" recipes), and check out this monthly breakdown from WiseBread for ideas.  Remember that this is a skill that you can get really good at. Hitting your target budget does not mean you have to give up on enjoyable food. Always be looking for ways to improve your ability, and you'll learn to work miracles.  3) It takes equipment. Stocking your kitchen with necessary tools can be tricky if you don't have cash on hand to invest in it; what do you have already?  You can get pretty far without too much, fortunately. A large, quality chopping knife with cutting board, a sauce pan, a stock pot, and a wooden spoon (plus a setting of silverware and a couple of bowls) will get you through a great many recipes. When you have more breathing room, a skillet, a rice cooker, and a spatula come in handy.  4) It impacts your social life. If your go-to solution for hanging out with friends is going out for drinks every weekend, then switching to home cooking will cut you off from a significant source of social interaction.  Start looking around for things to do with your friends that don't cost $50 per outing, and then invite folks to another event before they decide which bar to go to. Again, this takes planning—you have to actively look for fun stuff to do well in advance—but it can be done. Never settle for a situation where you aren't having fun. Instead, get creative, and find something you can do with your friends that's inside your goal. Timeout.com is a great place to start looking.  Best of luck! Your goal is totally achievable, and getting there will probably take you to a lot of fun places. Just remember that if you ever feel like you have to choose between having a good time and meeting your goal, it's a false dichotomy. Don your Creativity Cap and look for Door #3."

Cheap_Meals,2asgcs,WillowWeeps2,2,Wed Aug 13 16:11:00 2014 UTC,"I know you don't want pasta bakes, but I made an amazing one the other day. Boil your pasta, adding frozen peas to the pot for the last 3 minutes. Drain everything. Put in a casserole dish. Then fry up a thinly sliced red onion in a good amount of olive oil. Then add garlic and chilli to taste. Also 1 teaspoon of brown sugar. Cook that up on a low heat for 15-20 minutes. You want to caramalize it. Add any of your favourite fresh or dried herbs. I like basil in this.Then stir in 2 cups of passata (tomato puree) and half a can of cream of mushroom soup. Stir all this well together. If it seems a bit thick add some more tomato puree and/or a little bit of cream. Stir this delicious onion gravy onto the peas and pasta. Taste for salt and pepper. Cover with your favourite hard cheese, I use mature cheddar. I also sprinkle on fresh breadcrumbs. I always use up all the ends of bread for this. They keep in the freezer for a couple of months. Never throw out another scrap of bread! Then bake at 180 degrees Celsius for about 25 or until golden and bubbly. And there you have my Creamy Onion and Pea pasta bake."

Add Parmesan until it gets thick (but don't overdo it). Use the water you reserved to bring creaminess to it; one TB at a time. Boil, drain & rinse pasta until cool. Toss pasta in a bowl with the following. Chopped roma tomato, thinly sliced sweet or red onion. From here there are several options. Olive oil, salkt, pepper, shredded white cheese and basil for a Caprese pasta salad. OR Black olives, Italian dressing and parmesan for something much more bold. OR a splash or rance and some chopped bacon for a better version of Suddenly Salad. Chili cheese mac . Not super original; but it works. Jambalaya pasta.

Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,MadChef26,8,Fri Jul 11 00:08:13 2014 UTC,"I don't know what kind of crazy people you associate with who put egg in their burgers... Egg is for meatballs and meatloaf, etc. A burger need only be pure meat with some salt and pepper on the surface for seasoning."
Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,MadChef26,1 point,Thu Jul 10 17:31:19 2014 UTC,"The oil can help prevent the meat from sticking to your hands, which might make it easier to form but that's usually only a problem with meat that is very finely ground, like a forcemeat. A course or medium grind for burger meat shouldn't stick to you.  Also, the oil can work against you. If the oil gets down inside the meat, it will actually prevent it from binding to itself."
Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,whocareswhatever,8,Thu Jul 10 17:32:30 2014 UTC,"What your making sounds more like meatballs or meatloaf. Hamburgers are just meat. Regardless of how you shape them, I'd use the broiler. Best way to get the grill effect indoors. put 'em on foil & flip once or twice. I can't give you timing because broilers can be unpredictable, just keep an eye on them & don't leave 'em super close to the heat source."

Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,jukeslywalka,3,Thu Jul 10 16:11:49 2014 UTC,I would make thinner patties and grill them (5 Guys style). Maybe put cheese between a few and pinch the sides together.

Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,auntiedawn,2,Thu Jul 10 12:24:17 2014 UTC,With a bum kitchen fan anything you try that would give you a good crust will probably set off your alarms. I would have said cast iron pan but you may get smoked out.
Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,cmbyrd,5,Thu Jul 10 14:38:46 2014 UTC,"I would make quarter pound patties and make them thin, as they will shrink a bit. Use just the beef and sprinkle the patties with seasoned salt on both sides.   Get your pan hot. This is important. I use a stainless steel pan and heat it on med-high. If you flick a few drops of water in the pan, you can tell if it's hot enough. If it sizzles, it's not hot enough. When the heat is right, the water will make little balls that will roll around on the pan.  I usually use 80/20 beef for burgers, so I don't oil the pan at all.   Now place your patties in the hot pan and don't touch them for two minutes. Let them sear. Flip and repeat for two minutes on the other side. Then turn heat to low and cover for five minutes for well done.   If you like a medium burger, you could do about three minutes instead.   This works for me every time. I made them last night for dinner and everyone loved them."
Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,cmbyrd,2,Thu Jul 10 16:50:26 2014 UTC,Preeeeeeety sure this will be what I do. Will report back upon completion of cooking.
Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,ghoti00,3,Thu Jul 10 19:07:37 2014 UTC,"Egg is fine if you have doubts about your ability to get them to cook without falling apart, I'd avoid breadcrumbs all together though - personally.  2.5 pounds of beef, I wouldn't use more than 1 smallish egg.  Maybe 1/2 a small onion, chopped fine, 2-3 toes of garlic, rubbed to a paste, just a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce, maybe a bit (1/4-1/2 cup) of brown sugar (will help forming the crust on the outside) a bit of salt (keep in mind the Worty is salty and you salted the garlic too, so go easy) and some black pepper.  As for the crust, as has been pointed out - if you've got a crummy vent fan, AND you're stuck with cooking inside you're kinda boned.  If your smoke alarm isn't wired to a monitoring station (and therefore won't call the fire department) I'd go ahead and blast em hard in a cast iron and just set the damn thing off.  If you can't do that, best bet is to cook em as high as you can without setting off the smoke alarm.  Put em in, don't touch em, don't lift em, don't poke at em, don't do anything to them.  Time how long til the tops start bleeding.  If you flip it right then, and then cook em again that long, you'll be about medium.  Wait about 40% of that time, flip em, and cook em on the second side for the same amount of time as the first and you'll be closer to well done.  Once you flip it, once again, don't touch it, don't poke it' don't look at it hard.  Just leave it the hell alone.  If you really wanna step up your burger game, you can always sous-vide and then deep fry the thing.  This is way less hard than it sounds, but will require a meat thermometer and an oil/candy thermometer, a pot of water, a pot of oil (I like a 2-3"" deep skillet, lots of surface area, and you don't have to work around high edges like if you used a stock pot.)    Put on a pretty good sized pot of water to get warm.  Figure out what temp you want your burgers, and get the water to stabilize at that temp so that it will stay there indefinitely without you having to turn up and down the stove constantly.  Here is a list of temps for meats.      For this method, I'd not work the meat any more than you ABSOLUTELY have to.  No egg, no onion or anything else in the meat.  Just meat.  Sprinkle the outside with some salt and pepper.  You want extra onion or garlic or whatever flavors, chop it up and put it in the bags with the meat - as they cook, they'll flavor the burgers.  Make your patties, put em in ziplock bags (one per bag.)    Seal up the bag all but the very corner, and slowly submerge the bag into water.  The pressure will squeeze the air out, keep going until the VERY last second zip up that last bit of seal the instant it hits water level.  Now put those in a pot of water that you've stabilized at the temp you want.  Because the water is the temp you want your burgers to be, 1) they can stay in there basically ""forever"" without overcooking, and 2) they will take quite some time to cook.  (As a note - the eggheads that study such things say you ought not to leave meat between 40*F and 140*F for more than 4 hours, so if you're cooking rare, pull em out before that time limit.  If you hit 4:01 you'll be fine, but I wouldn't go to 6:00...)    Once your burgers have had time to come up to the temp you want, put on a pain of oil to 5*-10*F before it's smoke point.  You need to be at least 350*F, but 400*F will work better, so buy your oil accordingly.  If there are no peanut allergies to worry about, that's what I recommend.  If you can't use peanut, a good refined canola is probably my second choice.  Get a slotted spoon (or better yet, spatula) that is made of metal.  If it doesn't have a big heat resistant rubber grip, use a hot pad or towel to hold it, and GENTLY put the burgers into the oil.  Don't want to splash yourself, and don't want to break em apart.  They're already cooked, so all you're looking for here is a nice crust on the thing.  30-45 seconds should be plenty.  Pull em out, and stick em on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess grease.  You've now got the best burger ever.  Especially if you're bold enough to cook em medium-rare.  Perfectly cooked, beautiful crust, and more or less smoke free, so a great match for your requirement of cooking inside with a shitty vent fan."

I thank you for your detailed post, though, because I've only recently become aware of sous vide and was wondering how it might be applied to burgers.  Huzzah to you!"
Cheap_Meals,2ab7az,weederstand,1 point,Thu Jul 10 19:07:01 2014 UTC,"That sounds amazing. Can I inject that intravenously? Second, I think sous vide might be out of my skill set   Not with that attitude you can't.  It's far easier than you think.  ""Sous Vide"" is a big scurry French word for ""toss some shit in a bag, toss the bag in some hot water, and fucking wait.""  Part of the reason it is becoming popular in restaurants is because it is so god damned easy.  Keep a couple of professional grade sous vide machines, one for MR, one for M, one for MW and you've just made most of your steaks take about 45 seconds from order coming in to ready to plate.  Ticket comes in, you grab a steak out of the water, open the package, and put grill marks on it.  20 seconds, flip, 20 seconds, plate.  Doing a MW filet on a grill is normally 12-15 minutes.  If you're cooking for a couple hundred people a night, that's HUGE.  People tend to be intimidated by cooking.  Nerdy types (which, sorry but you're on Reddit so... ) even more so, because we're used to pretty exact directions with stuff, or it won't work.  You can't just fudge a line of code and it comes out fine.  There is no such thing as ""close enough"" in a command line.  Cooking is different though, it's not a science, it's an art.  Van Gogh and Picasso did things quite differently, but both came out with great paintings.  Cooking you can do a bit of this, a dash of that, and as long as you were close, it will still be good.  My wife bakes, so we have digital scales accurate to 1/100th of a gram, and we've got measuring cups and such.  I think that the last time I used a measuring cup while I was cooking might have been in 2004.  If you can read a thermometer you can sous vide.  Put on a pot of water, put a thermometer in it.  Play with the heat level under the pot until you're losing as much heat through the sides of the pot, and the surface of the water as you're gaining from the heat source.  Now a tiny turn up or down will give you a slightly warmer, or slightly cooler pot of water.  Do that til you get the temp you want.  This is far easier than it sounds, you don't need to understand the thermal dynamics going on, just know that if your water is getting hotter and hotter and hotter, your heat is too high.  If it's cooling down, your heat isn't high enough.  Play with the knob till you find the right place.  (And because I'm apparently a child, I'm snickering now.)  Same thing with the pot of oil.  Stabilize the temp and you're good to go.  I actually have some scratch marks in my stove where those points are, so I can set stuff there with far less effort the second time.  Same pot, about the same amount of water, turn the stove to the same place.  Viola.  After that it really just is a waiting game.  You want burgers for lunch, better start em in the morning, cuz they're gonna need two hours in the water to get up to 145 or so.  The ziplock bag method works great if you're gonna make em and then cook em right then, and you only have a few to do.  If you're gonna store em, or you've got a bunch though, that can get old fast.  I've seen burgers done in ring molds (by which I mean an empty 2L of Sprite, cut on a bandsaw) to keep them from crushing and deforming around the edges when they're vacuum sealed as well.  That's right.  An empty 2L, a bandsaw, and you're good to go.  I was't joking about cooking not being rocket surgery.  Hack some shit together and you're ready man."

Cheap_Meals,2a2opa,jinntakk,2,Tue Jul 8 14:03:14 2014 UTC,"I second the chili idea. The one I make is very easy (canned tomato sauce, whole tomatoes, black beans, red kidney beans, spices, and sometimes veggie ground round) and costs about $10 for the ingredients and it makes about twelve one cup servings. Chili, casseroles and big batches of pasta dishes that can be frozen are generally more economical and you can freeze them so you don't have to cook as often.  Tons of stuff can be made in a crock pot, even some stuff you wouldn't expect, like bread! This is a good start (not all of these recipes are vegetarian but you can adapt them by replacing with tofu or cutting out the meat).  Generally, tofu products meant to imitate meat (like veggie burgers, veggie meatballs, etc.) are way overpriced. I'd avoid those and get your protein from stuff like lentils, beans, etc. Or make your own stuff using extra firm tofu (a block of this is $1 at my local Walmart). This is the ""meat""ball recipe I use. My two favourite veggie burgers are this black bean one and this spicy sweet potato one. PS: The site those are listed on, Budget Bytes, is a great resource.  I budget about $100 dollars a month for groceries for me and my boyfriend. Stock up on the basics (rice, dried beans, pasta, etc.) and than keep an eye on the flyers for sale items. I only buy produce that is on sale and I try to only buy things that I can use in multiple dishes. Things like milk and bread can be bought on sale and frozen for a later date. And check out websites that have printable/mail out coupons. I live in Canada, so there tends not to be a lot of grocery coupons, but I know in the US there are tons more. Just don't fall into the trap of buying something you wouldn't buy just because you have a coupon."

Since then (mostly on a recent trip to the US - where these instant noodles are far cheaper), i've decided to give things a go, but with the ramen (couldn't find egg noodles in Path Mark, or Target). So i';ve got a bunch of experience with this. I don't like the ramen seasoning either. To be honest, most combinations of spices and sauces are able to result in something decent. A few things i've used for seasong/sauce ingredients include:  Wing sauce hot sauce bbq sauces soy sauce kecap manis chinese catsap olive oil chicken or pork drippings honey mustard  with spices including: paprika cracked black pepper salt cayenne ground chillies chopped chillies chilli powder curry powder garam masala tumeric onion salt basil sweet basil thyme cardamom etc etc etc etc  I usually cook whatever vegetables (and often steak, beef, or chicken i've cooked already) in a pan with some combination of sauces and spices i have on hand, then add the drained noodles at the end, stir for a bit, and then serve.

Cheap_Meals,293q38,jmedk,3,Thu Jun 26 02:39:28 2014 UTC,"I lived in Japan for a few years, ate a LOT of ramen while I was there.  It's still a staple for me.  Learn where the good Asian markets are in your area.  Siracha is your friend.  Huy Fong Foods brand is the best of the Siracha sauces I think (tried a few other brands a couple months ago when the good stuff was hard to find - most of them are too oily.)  Eggs come in a close second.  Miso paste, Hoisin sauce both add a lot of flavor, and last ""forever"" in a fridge.  Buy whole chickens.  Learn how to break them down.  Google it will bring up lots of results, here's one that looks decent.  Link.  This doesn't have to be (and won't be at first) pretty, you'll get better at it with practice.  Breasts are breasts, and kinda whatever.  For ramen, you can cook them off however you'd like, and slice em thin.  For other meals, use em however you'd like.  Braise the legs (put em in a casserole dish, add water til about 1/2 way up the leg, put in oven @ 350 for an hour.  When they're done you should have a hard time pulling them out of the liquid because they're falling apart.)  Pull the meat off the bones (also save the braising liquid, it's tasty) and use it for all sorts of stuff.  Chicken Pot Pie, pasta, whatever you're making and need some cheap protein in.  Cooked leg meat, and breasts freeze just fine if you won't use them all within a week.   Boil the carcass to make broth or stock (depending on how good you are at taking off the meat in the first place).   Cook down your stock and braising liquid (can even mix em for fewer steps) to about 1/3 or 1/4 of what you started with, you've not got super concentrated stock that you just have to add water to to get back to where it was.  This lets you freeze it in MUCH smaller containers for the same amount of flavor.  I'm a big fan of cooking it down til a whole chicken worth will fit into a couple of ice cube trays.  Once they're frozen solid, pop them out and put em in a gallon size freezer bag.  Need stock?  Pot of water and a couple of ice cubes, viola!  Daikon radish can sometimes be found at 'regular' grocery stores, but I find it's cheaper at the Asian market. Cabbage is good, napa cabbage is better, and bok choy is awesome if you can find it cheap.  Onions are good, I tend to slice up a whole onion and keep it in a zip lock baggie.  Julienne (or if you're terrible at knife work, buy a julienne peeler) the daikon and into a baggie in your fridge.  Chop your cabbage into thin strips as well.  Ziplock baggies all around.  Bean sprouts are a delicious addition, but only last a couple of days before they start to get funky, so only buy em when you're gonna use em.    Boil your noodles in water flavored with miso or hoisin or soy sauce or stock.  Adds a lot right there, and you've essentially replaced the flavor package.  While they're cooking, I toss some veggies and/or cooked meat into the bottom of my bowl, squirt some Siracha in there as well.  Then hit it with about three or four more squirts of Siracha because I love that shit.  Once the noodles are done, pull them out of the water (don't have to get all of em, most is fine) and into the bowl on top of all the rest of the stuff.  Put the pot back on the stove, but turn the heat down to a simmer.  Crack an egg or two into the pot, and stir (slowly will give you bigger chunks of egg, whisk the shit out of it will give you almost an egg thickened broth with no chunks, which my wife likes).  It should only take 30 seconds or so to cook the egg, then dump the whole pot of water into your bowl of noodles and toppings.  The heat from the liquid will cook the veggies a bit (which is all you want anyways) and heat up any meat you've got in there.  Let it sit 30 seconds or so, give it a good stir to mix up the ingredients evenly, and go to town.  I have a pot that is my ramen pot.  I always use it to cook ramen, and I always use the same bowls (as they're ramen bowls...) to eat it out of.  That means I know exactly how much liquid to put into the pot to get a bowl of soup.  You'll figure it out pretty quickly if you have a similar system, so avoid running out of broth before your solids are covered, or having way too much liquid and having to waste some of it.  If you've chopped all your veggies, and cooked your meat and have them all in the fridge ready to go (I say zip lock bags, if you're on a budget Tupperware works as well, or empty salsa jars or whatever else you can use to store shit) making an Amazing bowl of ramen can take less than 10 minutes.  There are other sorts of things you can do with the noodles too.  If you're not in the mood for soup try making yakisoba instead.  All the same ingredients, but instead of adding the broth back in to the noodles you cook them, and then move to a saute pan.  Put in some fat (lard is traditional, and delicious, but I tend to have veggy oil around) and give your veggies/meat a quick toss to heat them through.  Add in the noodles, and toss it a couple of times to mix it.  Add in some soy sauce (careful at this point, soy sauce can burn easily) and let it cook for a few more minutes to develop flavors."

I make rogan josh fairly regularly and have been using the same curry powder bag for two years now. It was like 7.99  One word of advice is just to buy a bunch of this stuff one time and all you have to worry about in the future is your protein and rice.

I've heard this same thing from a number of friends (also orange juice). This is where you really need to start training the family.   No, milk does not pour for the faucet at 10 cents a gallon. If you drink it all, you don't get pancakes on Saturday. Find some small, cheap glasses and designate those as milk/juice glasses. I calculate out based on that; if you get 6oz glasses, that's 21 glasses of milk. Maybe you have 2 gallons, one for drinking, one for cooking. Either way, if they are drinking milk, juice, whatever other spendy items that quickly, the simply answer is to slow them down (or buy more, but that's not likely in the budget)."

One purpose of drying milk is to preserve it; milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated, due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its bulk for economy of transportation. Powdered milk and dairy products include such items as dry whole milk, nonfat dry milk, dry buttermilk, dry whey products and dry dairy blends.

Cheap_Meals,291d2z,t0talnonsense,17,Wed Jun 25 06:35:14 2014 UTC,"You can either buy a rice cooker that will steam rice (and can e used for a variety of other dishes, too, which is pretty neat!) or you can boil it. If you boil it make sure to fluff it up with a fork. You'll know when it's done. Another nice way is to cook it in chicken broth and throw sliced up veggies in. This can be lunch/breakfast or a dinner side. In Asian dishes, it's used to stretch food because it is filling, and also to soak up saucy foods. This is what makes it more delicious. I know you're sick of eggs, but throwing some scrambled eggs over rice or a soft oiled egg is always nice.      As for soup, to keep it very simple use chicken broth, toss your veggies in (similarly to the rice, doing a soup is good to use up extra vegetables as you can throw just about anything in), do meats first if you'd like something like that in it but brown it first, and noodles when the veggies are about halfway done. Any sort of udon/ramen/short pasta works well. If you want a thicker soup, you can use tomato paste (and to some extent tomato sauce) or use dried peas until they begin to break up as a thickener, but those are the only two easy ways I know. Add whatever spices you'd like to taste. Be wary of salt though!      As for basic spices, you have an alright cabinet going. It's not exactly a spice, but always having a lemon, garlic, and onion handy can make a drab meal into something wonderful. Garlic and onion come in powder and you can buy lemon juice in a bottle to keep/last longer though I like fresh lemon better and it generally lasts a couple weeks. Sprinkle any combination on meat, fish, veggies and it's excellent. Another handy thing to have is dehydrate basil. Also good for seasoning meats as well as any sort of pasta. Soy sauce can be used to fry veggies or marinate meats. That's as simple as ill leave it!       Next we'll talk about some simple sauces. If you melt butter and dribble in soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, it goes excellent over veggies and rice. You can also buy and water down hoisin sauce for veggies and meats. Rice will soak this up nicely, too. Soy sauce by itself isn't a very thick sauce, but can be thickened slightly when using corn starch. DO THIS ON LOW HEAT AND BE VERY CAREFUL. It doesn't need as much corn starch as you think! Similarly, you can simmer butter and slowly add flour till it browns, then add milk a little at a time till it begins to thicken, then. Little cream cheese, heavy whipping cream, and a little cheese of your choice for a cheese sauce. For pastas or veggies.      Simple recipes is a little difficult to do. Instead I'll start with some easy ingredients that don't go bad often.       Let's talk about potatoes. No, not the shitty brown ones. Try gold or something colorful or sweet potatoes (NOTE: I do NOT mean yams though they can work, too). Very versitile, can be baked, fried on the stovetop, stuffed, boiled, etc. Try something simple like hassle back potatoes (google it) if you don't want a lot of secondary ingredients, or throw into soups (also helps thicken. Forgot about this one! Make sure you do it early on.) good in roasts, too, or as a side dish.     Tomato sauce. Use as a soup base, pour over veggies as a sauce with a sprinkle of cheese, use to make pastas, use to flavor meats. Use to make pizzas. Etc. google recipes with it. There are a million. Simple veggies that are affordable such as carrots, squashes, asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli can be stir fried together in different combinations for a healthy side. Add a sauce if you want to put it over rice or pasta. Speaking of pasta....     Pasta can be served hot with a sauce, or cold with some veggies (think onions, chick peas, beans in general, peppers, broccoli) and then your favorite light salad dressing (think Italian, not ranch!).      Beans beans beans. If you don't like to rehydrate them, you can use canned or pick them up frozen. I like this better because it's less time consuming. Chick peas are a nice source of protein and can be tossed in salads and stir fried. Any bean can be tossed in a blender with tahini (you can find this in an international aisle I guess), lemon, and garlic and eaten with bread meat or veggies. This is hummus. It's delicious and can be done doZens of ways. You can also cook black eyes peas, black beans, or red beans in a pot of water, spice it and eat with rice. Good if you can throw a veggie in or some sausage.     Sausage! Kielbasa, ""fancy"" hot dogs (chicken, cheese, etc. please check ingredients first for healthfulness! Only use one of these per every 2 people in a dish if it's less than savory health wise, otherwise one per person) etc. combine with peppers and onions in stir fry for sandwiches or for eating with potatoes or over rice, can also be mixed with other veggies, but always good to have onions in this mix. Excellent stirred into beans.       Last dish I'll talk about is more about what you put it in. A casserole can be made with just about any ingredient and a can of tomato, chicken broth, or mushroom soup. Think about laying rice down and cooking it in mushroo soup with chicken breast over top. Or put pasta in the dish and bake it instead with veggies for some variety. Also all the veggies can be used to make side salads! Opt for romain or mixed greens.       Your kitchen is only as small as you think it is. I know it's hard to try new recipes at first, but everybody has to start somewhere. Don't be afraid to just go for it! Make sure you taste along the way, and 9 times out of 10 you'll end up with something fantastic.    NOTE: fresh veggies I listed here will generally last a week and a half. Like I said before, you can use frozen or canned if you need something to last longer or that's cheaper, of course fresh is always better, but it's not for everyone! Experiment and find out what works best for you and your kitchen. Happy eating :) hopefully this helps.      If anything is confusing feel free to ask questions. Did this from my phone so it might be difficult to understand. When you make the original meal, make enough for a couple after. Generally the leftovers will keep just fine for about five to six days after, as long as you properly heat it up!"
Cheap_Meals,291d2z,HDpants,2,Wed Jun 25 11:12:00 2014 UTC,Great post! And I just saw this link posted in another subreddit which has some recipes that use the advice you just mentioned. So I thought I would just put it here.

Cheap_Meals,291d2z,HDpants,7,Wed Jun 25 15:44:36 2014 UTC,"If you can buy a slow cooker, they are wonderful for making easy and cheap meals that have several meals' worth of leftovers. Rice cookers also make cooking rice super easy, plus you can use them as a slow cooker. They are both nice for set it and forget it type meals when you're super busy.   I like having these herbs and spices on hand to have some variety in seasoning: curry powder, paprika, chile powder, rosemary, ginger, basil, oregano, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It can get expensive to buy them all at once, but luckily you won't use them all together, so you can buy one or two every grocery trip over a few weeks to catch them all gradually and spread the cost out. Using different seasoning combinations can help add some variety to dishes you may make often, like stir fries or stews.   Improvising while cooking is all about not being afraid to make mistakes. Practicing on the aforementioned stir fries is the easiest and cheapest way (probably). You can use frozen vegetables and just kind of toss in whatever you want and see how it tastes. Make a small batch first (maybe from a recipe) and find something you like, then go nuts. You'll probably waste a little money at first, but the risk outweighs the rewards."
Cheap_Meals,291d2z,jmedk,3,Wed Jun 25 11:10:32 2014 UTC,"You can often find 10 lb bags of chicken leg quarters on sale.  Put the chicken in a large stock pot and cover chicken with cold water. Add several stalks of celery and several carrots. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30-45 minutes until chicken is done.   Take chicken out of the stock pot and let it cool off a bit before taking the meat off the bones.  Reserve the meat for chicken salad,  Chicken quesadillas, to put back in soup, for omelettes, etc. Return the bones to pot and continue to simmer for several hours. Strain liquid through a colander and discard bones and vegetables.  Chill liquid in fridge overnight. A layer of fat will congeal on top of broth, making it easy to scrape off and discard.    Now you have an excellent broth that you can add some of the chicken meat back to along with noodles for chicken noodle soup.  Or you can cook rice in this broth for more flavor.  Or you can cook most any vegetable inthe broth and then puree in a blender and then add a swirl of cream for a lovely soup.  I know it is still more chicken, but maybe this will give you a little variety. Google making stock for more complete directions."
Cheap_Meals,291d2z,upboats4u,3,Wed Jun 25 08:50:57 2014 UTC,"Rice. Add stuff to it, whatever you like the taste of, herbs and spices in the cooking water, veg etc once it is drained. Fry it with a couple of eggs (I just pour the *cooked! rice into a pan of beaten eggs cooking on low as soon as the bottom of the egg starts to cook, then stir it around until it doesnt look slimy anymore) YES! IMO rule number 1 is time=flavour. You can use stock cubes or make your own broth, personally I don't think anything more than water is necessary if you add enough random spices and shit that you like. I fry at least one fresh onion and always LOADS of fresh garlic in butter or coconut oil but that is according to taste really, wait till its glossy add salt, whatever spices or stock flavouring and cook until you have a nice kinda crust forming on the bottom of the pan, shove in a load of stuff that is on its way out (carrot, apple, tomato, beans, whatever you have in whatever combo you think you might enjoy) and stir it up a bit, then make sure your pan is pretty hot and pour in some boiled water from the kettle, I sometimes add a tin of chopped tomatoes and half as much water but be careful cos tomatoes can go bitter if they boil. You are ""de-glazing"" your pan, you wanna use a wooden spoon to dissolve that crust I was talking about into the water).  I usually put in enough water to cover the veg by about half an inch (more water for ""dry veg like potato, less for tomato etc). TASTE IT NOW and adjust the ratios of the spices you have used to your liking. This isn't the finished flavour but it will give you an idea, then leave it to simmer until the veg is soft enough to mash with a fork (but not toooo soft unless you don't want any chunks).  At this point I taste it again and consider the texture of the soup, if it is starting to look gloopy (or the flavour is overpowering) I add water until it is slightly more watery than I want it and then leave it to simmer until it reaches desired texture (time=flavour, I sometimes repeat this process a few times). If it is bland but good textured add more flavour and a tiny bit of water and simmer until it goes back to the right texture. Otherwise just leave it simmering until it is thick enough for you. Always taste it at regular intervals and add ingredients a little at a time. Not exactly perfect cooking but it works for me.  Way too many options depending on your tastes. Garlic and onion powders are really handy but using the real thing adds so much more to your food. Take a look at the ingredients listed on the spices you already have, they probably have quite a significant overlap and buying the individual spices will give you a chance to change the flavours up a bit more. If you like curry a medium curry powder is a good place to start and do the same thing with the ingredients in that using the labels as a guide of which spices mix well.    I meant this to be a short and simple reply to prevent overwhelming you, I think I failed, sorry! Mainly, don't be afriad to experiment."

Cheap_Meals,291d2z,snyezhniyi_chalovyek,2,Wed Jun 25 16:19:26 2014 UTC,"I'm going to tell you my basic chicken soup recipe. This makes a rather large pot, but bonus... you can freeze it!  One small bag of carrots (~6 carrots)  One bunch celery  Two yellow onions.  Two-three chicken breasts (buy a big container, freeze the rest individually)  Chicken boullion or chicken base (comes in a jar)  Very small pasta (pastene or something)  Kitchen staples: canola oil, salt, pepper, any other herbs/spices desired   Slice the carrots, and chop the celery and onions into bite-sized pieces  Toss the veggies into a large pot with enough oil to lightly coat. Cook them over medium heat for 5-10 minutes until the celery and onion are slightly translucent.  Cover the veggies with water and add chicken base/boullion. I like very hearty soups, so I don't add a lot of extra water here. Just enough to cover all of the veggies + a tiny bit extra to boil off. Go ahead and add in your base/boullion according to package instructions. Boil your vegetables for now.  In the meantime, cover the two chicken breasts (or thighs, any other cut of meat you want) with water in a different pan and boil until finished. Pull them out of the water when finished, chop them into pieces, and throw them into the veggie pot when the veggies are almost finished cooking.  Also in the meantime, cook your pasta. When it's done cooking, run it under cold water (stops it from overcooking and falling apart)   At this point, you have your soup.... veggies, chicken pieces, broth and your pasta, which is just covered in cold water. I never add my pasta to my soup to store, because it'll continue to soak up all the broth. But whenever you want a bowl... a scoop of pasta and a couple of scoops of soup, and there you have it, a very simple chicken soup recipe.  Here's a picture album/recipe I have of a different soup I also make. http://imgur.com/a/RKXOV"
Cheap_Meals,291d2z,snyezhniyi_chalovyek,2,Wed Jun 25 18:40:28 2014 UTC,"Soup is like Marxist theory. It's all about base and superstructure. The base is usually formed by classic mirapoix (celery, carrots, onions), the holy trinity (celery, peppers, onions), or for a mushroom broth, either of those + mushrooms. If you're not vegan, you can add chicken or beef to make a meat broth. This forms your broth base, and you can buy these prepackaged if you don't save your scraps or don't want to cook from scratch. Avoid bullion cubes unless you don't mind MSG and sodium. Sometimes, instead of meat, I put in brown lentils and let them cook into oblivion to distribute some protein and umami into the broth.  For the superstructure, you can experiment to your heart's desire or look up what ingredients go into a minestrone or barley soup or whatever you'd like to make. The key is to add things in according to the time they take to cook, so everything is done to your liking.  You can try to thicken a soup various ways. Adding barley or (IIRC) amaranth flour, as well as a cold water cornstarch solution. I don't artificially thicken my soups because I don't like the results. Maybe I suck at it.  Finally, you can ""finish"" the soup, when it's very close to being done, with some acid like red wine vinegar or some umami like soy sauce. Theoretically this balances out the taste profile. YMMV, just don't add too much unless it's hot and sour soup. This is also the time to adjust spicing to your liking.  I'm making a soup right now, actually. I'm defrosting my classic mirapoix base, which I made in one batch about a week ago. Once that reaches a boil, I'll add the superstructure. It's going to be a cabbage/lentil soup so I'll chiffonade (or just coarsely slice since I'm lazy) a head of red cabbage and dump that in. This will be followed by carrots that are at the limits of their freshness, since a soup is a great time to use up stuff. Lentils will go in last, and at that point I'll go through the first spicing iteration. I'm thinking cumin, fresh garlic, dill, and parsley. I might put in a pinch of cayenne or ground mustard if I'm feeling frisky. As it boils, I'll taste and re-spice it at random intervals.  The best way to develop a repertoire in soups is to read some recipes to know what ingredients go in which soup, and to experiment. They all have their cliche flavor profiles which won't vary much between recipes. Most vegetables go together well in a vegetable soup and I like to use up things before they spoil. I like to sneak in some canned kale or turnip greens for added nutrition and calcium, too.  That's ""Soup in a Nutshell."" Man am I bored today..."
Cheap_Meals,291d2z,LobsterManFightClub,1 point,Wed Jun 25 21:59:43 2014 UTC,"Oh, and two more things:   Don't cook the soup too long or add your spices in too early, or your flavors will become bland. If you're making a meat broth, you can sear or broil the meat on the bottom of the pot and then deglaze it with a liquid to get better flavor. You can also stir fry your mirepoix."
Cheap_Meals,291d2z,tomcam,1 point,Wed Jun 25 22:11:01 2014 UTC,"One recipe I use when we're getting low on cash is black eyed peas. It'll solve your crazy ingredient bean problem.  3-4 cans of black eyed peas (or dried if you prefer, just remember to soak them over night).  2 ham hocks (you can save the rest of them for split pea soup or more black eyed peas) salt pepper garlic cajun seasoning. It's not expensive and it'll last you a long time  optional - bay leaf.  rice ( to serve over)   Place your beans and spices into a large pot and fill the pot with water until it's about an inch over the inserted ingredients. Add the ham hocks and simmer on medium until the beans are soft and the hammocks start falling apart a bit. This usually takes me about 3 hours. But make sure to periodically check that you're not running out of water. The finish product should be thick.   Serve over rice. You can double the recipe if you want a lot of leftovers.   If you want to add bayleaf but you're worried about it going bad before you can use it up, place 1-2 bay leaves in each ice tray slot and fill it with water. When frozen pop them into a plastic bag. Then just add a cube to a recipe when you need it."

After 3 months you'll have a backlog of good ideas to lean on.  OK, I lied about just one thing. A second thing is to put every single one of your favorite recipes in an easily accessible place because, given how busy you are, you may actually forget some of your faves.

The folks at America's Test Kitchen describe their version, but not as simple and easy as what you made:     Traditionally, cowboys layered a mishmash of vegetables and meat (usually sausage) into a giant milk can and then cooked it over an open fire to feed the hungry masses. We opted for a Dutch oven instead but kept the basic technique: longer-cooking vegetables like potatoes and cabbage go on the bottom, closest to the heat, followed by more delicate onions and carrots. Green bell peppers are added halfway through the cooking time. Bratwurst was our sausage of choice, and we opted to brown it first to add flavor and create fond. Beer is the classic cooking liquid, and we enhance it with garlic, bay leaves, and thyme."

Cheap_Meals,28s31f,BitchesLove,2,Mon Jun 23 11:47:06 2014 UTC,You can buy the cheap chorizo with all the cheap meats and parts that are added to it at just about at any store here in Texas for about $3 or $4 a lb. You can also get the good stuff made fresh daily at certain stores for about 5.99 a lb too or on special for about 4.99 a lb if you're lucky.   I prefer to pan fry my potatoes when adding them to chorizo so that they have a better texture to them. I also like to add a can of refried beans to them as well.
Cheap_Meals,28ltgi,TheDrifterHermes,7,Fri Jun 20 01:49:41 2014 UTC,Beans and rice. May get some cheap sausage if they have it and use whatever seasoning you have to make a stew with the beans then pour over rice.
Cheap_Meals,28ltgi,kdar,7,Fri Jun 20 02:01:33 2014 UTC,"Cabbage is a good cheap bulk food. Can be cooked with a knife, a pot, a spoon and a little EVOO (or butter). <$.60 a pound and full of fiber. Delicious when sauteed.  Besides fried rice I like curry. I'll give you my fried rice recipe here. 1/2 the amount of dried rice as will fit in your pan (unless you want to cook multiple batches then make however much you want). I usually do one frozen bag mixed veggies (or whatever frozen veggie is on sale) per 4 cups cooked rice (2 cups dry). Cook rice the day before and store in fridge; you can place the frozen veggies on the rice after cooking so they are thawed and ready to cook fast. Heat a TBSP or Two of oil or butter (whatever you have on hand); if using fresh onions saute for a few minutes and then add garlic for about a minute or until fragrant; in a pinch get the $1 powdered onion and garlic powders you can find at most dollar stores--or buy small amounts for cheap from anywhere that sells it in 'bulk' (measure into baggie and buy by the pound). Dump rice and veggies (frozen or thawed) and stir occasionally until heated through/beginning to brown. For me, this is usually a $3-$5 recipe that produces 8 meals for myself. Add additional veggies such as cabbage or frozen broccoli to extend the servings by a good bit.  The curry:  A tub of curry paste (~$2-$3 from an Asian mart) + a can of coconut milk ($1.30 for small or $2.50 for big can) and add veggies. Cabbage is a good cheap bulk food, and I like to add a pound or two to any dish I want to make last much longer. Look for sales and find one or two bags of $1 frozen veggies of whatever you want; you really can't go wrong.  Recipe is stupid simple (At least how I make it). Measure enough curry paste to accommodate the amount of coconut milk you have (as indicated on the curry paste tub). Mix them together in a pot large enough to fit all the veggies you're going to add. Add raw meat/tofu and bring to a boil (you can get a frozen bag of peeled edamame for super cheap and add it in the frozen veggies for protein if you want). Add veggies (frozen or fresh) and let simmer (I like garlic, ginger, onions, broccoli, cabbage, and baby corn but you can literally use whatever), covered, for about 20 minutes or until veggies are tender and meat has been fully cooked. Serve over rice. A bit of chili oil (I like fried chili oil--super hot) can help with the meat come out a bit more moist (putting it in with the curry before adding the meat). Some items, like 'minced crab in spices' (<$1.75) will contain all the oil you need for a big pot of curry. This, to me, is good warm and cold. You can augment the flavor with Siracha, black bean and garlic sauce, or whatever stir-fry sauces you prefer. I typically add these in when reheating so I can vary the flavors with each meal.  With a big can of coconut milk and a heaping pile of cabbage/veggies I can usually eat this twice a day for a week. And beyond the initial $2.50 for curry, you only really need to buy a bag or so of frozen veggies and a can of coconut milk to make this come out great every single time."

You cook Ramen as normal, but just maybe 30 second before it is cooked all the way through, drain. Add veggies, cracked egg(s) , seasoning packet, and whatever else. Heat up some oil and throw it on and flip a few times until it is all toasty. Pretty filling and crazy cheap (~0.45 a serving. ) also add some cheap chicken or bacon parts (cheap in the deli.) Now that we have a shit ton more money, he still asks for this!   Another thing we did was buy a huge pack of corn tortillas ($6) and 2 lbs of ground beef ($6) and a taco seasoning packet, and we cooked up the beef and made little toquitos and froze them. Lasted us a few weeks and it was a cheap munchies thing if we were ""American hungry"" (as we call it when we aren't hungry but we are 2 hours away from being hungry so just to nip it in the bud)   We lived off super unhealthy cheap food while I was in college.

Cheap_Meals,28ltgi,zblaxberg,2,Fri Jun 20 02:06:17 2014 UTC,Thank you. Definitely gonna get the squash and canned salmon. Mom used to make salmon patties so I'm kind of familiar. Otherwise any tips on howbto specifically prepare the shoulder?
Cheap_Meals,28ltgi,cmbyrd,1 point,Fri Jun 20 02:39:52 2014 UTC,"Yea for the salmon I just get a can of fiesta corn (corn with red and green peppers), salt, pepper, old bay, an egg or two and either bread crumbs or you can get a box of generic brand chex cereal and mash it into a breadcrumb. I think I picked up the salmon for like $1.29 a can the other day.  As for the shoulder, it's pretty easy if you have a crockpot. I just get a bottle of whatever bbq sauce I want and pour half the bottle in with the pig. Cook for about 7-8 hours and just shred it with a fork, and cover it with the extra sauce. With an oven it might be a bit trickier but I'm gonna guess if you put it in for about 6-7 hours at like 300-350 that'll probably do it. Someone who is better at cooking might give you a better idea of temp and time though."

Put your oven around 200-225 if you're cooking it for that long.    Add some liquid to the pan as well, will help things along and keep the sauce from burning on the bottom.  When budget constraints aren't in play I'm a huge fan of pineapple juice for both the flavor and the bromelain (enzyme that makes meat fall apart).  In a pinch, water would work, but if is an opportunity to add flavor if you've got a brown ale in the fridge, or a can of coke, or some pineapple juice or...  Another 'nice to have, but do not go buy it for in this situation' is a couple shakes of liquid smoke.  If you've got it laying around, will make your braised pork taste more like slow BBQ'ed pork, which is nice, but even without you're in for a tasty treat."

I make a sweet potato, chickpea and carrot curry but you could put anything you want in. Meats, potato, beans. (I do add in a can of butterbeans or kidney beans to bulk out a lot of meals. Kidney beans are 80c a can at Coles I think)  Add garlic, ginger, chicken stock, curry powder and chilli. Cook it until the vegetables are tender/soft. Add in some coconut cream and serve over rice.  Kidney beans are actually a really good way of bulking out recipes. So if you decide to go the spaghetti route, you could buy half the meat, and splurge on a few things like capsicum, mushrooms, ham/bacon then add in a couple of cans of kidney beans. If you serve a side salad as well, you can use half of the capsicum/mushroom/ham in that too :)  Edit: You can get bags of salad leaves for $3 from Coles as well, which may be a good base for the side salad. Regular mince comes in 400g or 500g packs for $3 from there as well. The Leggos pasta sauces are usually fairly cheap but there is also usually something on special (Sometimes maybe 2 for $3.50 or something like that)  You may already have things in your cupboard/fridge like cheese, garlic, herbs - which may make the meal better. Carrots are always cheap (buy the bag, I think you get a kilo or something for under $2) You can also grate some and add it into your pasta sauce for more volume if needed as well :)  Someone did mention garlic bread being kind of unnecessary but when you're cooking for a lot of people, I do like having that kind of stuff there so everyone feels like they have had enough food (in case I have misjudged the portions!)"

The theory they use is that before farming was invented, we only ate starches in the form of tubers that you'd occasionally find foraging. The reason they use a primarily meat based diet is because that's supposedly how they would have eaten during the hunting/foraging days. But, the actual diet itself goes in two different directions. In one way, it seeks to mimic the diet of our ancestors. In the other way, it uses science and says ""stay in ketosis""."
Cheap_Meals,280bew,earldbjr,1 point,Fri Jun 13 20:48:43 2014 UTC,"I think paleo is very similar to keto (if not the same.) potatoes are high in carbohydrates and to stay in ketosis you have to be 65% protein 30% fat and 5% carbs (or less. ) along with staying at or below 1800 calories depending on your weight, height, activity level, etc.   Seems like a huge pain, but I've been on it for a few weeks or so and it is so damn easy. Tons of steak, chicken bacon, spinach, Ranch, butter, heavy cream, beef, cheese, coffee, tea, and a ton of other super super yummy things."

Personally I think the corn on the cob idea is spot on, though I would lean more toward veggie skewers than chicken veggie skewers.  If you make hot dogs and/or hamburgers on the grill, you are saving on charcoal or propane with the corn as well.  Then all you need are chips and a big vat of salsa and you are good.  Kroger has store brand salsa in my area for about $6 for a big 24 oz jug.  Just put it in a big bowl."

Get yourself some popcorn and pop it in the air popper.     Movie-style Popcorn: real melted butter and salt Sophisticated Popcorn: real melted butter, salt, and black pepper Taco Popcorn: real melted butter, salt, black pepper, cumin, and a dash of chili powder Smoky Hot-corn: real melted butter, salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper Crab Corn: real melted butter, old bay seasoning Go ahead and experiment! Ranch dressing mix, celery salt, cocoa powder, cinnamon, parmesan cheese... it's hard to ruin popcorn but easy to dress it up.   Air-popped popcorn tastes so much better than the butter-flavored microwave bagged stuff, and it's cheaper, and you rarely end up with stinky burned popcorn. You can make it quickly and in huge amounts, just about everybody likes it, it fits into most diets and doesn't set off a lot of allergy alerts, it's easy for people to fill up on, and it's just a great food for parties of any size and at any time of year. Everybody likes popcorn. I used to keep microwavable bags on hand as a snack for when unexpected guests stopped by, and then I discovered the air-popped popcorn and the pre-mixed popcorn seasonings, but it's so much tastier to just season the popcorn yourself, and real butter tastes way better than butter buds or other butter-flavored sprinkles (and the dampness of melted butter makes the seasonings stick more). Oh, and it helps me get rid of the seasonings I don't use that often (like cumin)."

Maybe some canned peaches and cheap vanilla ice cream for dessert?  Be aware that drinks can add up at parties.

You can make instant ""Minute"" rice in the coffeemaker that's usually provided in a hotel room, but instant rice is more expensive than regular rice.  Plain white rice is also super bland, and if you were going to tout any health benefits to rice over vending machine food, 1 serving of white rice has a very high glycemic index and glycemic load, higher even than 1 serving of Coca-Cola classic (89 for white rice, 63 for Coke), so by itself, it's worse than drinking Coke. (Brown rice is healthier, but more expensive and still bland.) Obtaining salt, pepper and other spices to make the rice palatable either means stealing from the fast food places or an additional purchase. And then there's the time and skill necessary to cook rice properly--non-instant rice is not something I would expect a novice cook to get right the very first time."

Cheap_Meals,27f50r,Refo1689,4,Fri Jun 6 12:23:28 2014 UTC,"I have experience in backpacking, and theres a few things I can probably help you with. First; carbs. You have an ok setup for things like small pasta, quinoa, that kind of thing. Potatoes will also be an awesome asset as you have a truck so you dont have to worry that theyre heavy, and you can do a lot of fun things with them. Potato skins are never bad, especially with bacon (it takes some practice but you can prepare them on the grill and they're AWESOME that way). Also if you'd like to go cheap with a camp stove, brown rice is one of the best. Healthy, takes a little more time to cook, but tasty with the cheapest of spices, and you'd be amazed how long a two pound bag lasts, for the grand total of like 3 bucks. Canned tuna also is pretty pedestrian and stores well, and has a whole lot of possibilities. If you go place to place, you can make salads and that kind of thing (even though you will need refrigeration for leftovers, but there are many easy ways to make it serving size). The grill will come in handy for things like chicken, but again it seems like serving size is the tough part. You can grill chicken for cheap and really enjoy it even if you just have it with barbecue sauce, corn and greens. BUT you'll have to preserve it. If you can get an AC/DC converter and a mini fridge, you'll be set. More than my food suggestions, I think acquiring refrigeration will make life a whole lot easier. Pickling in bulk is also something that can be time-intensive but something you may enjoy and has a big payoff to get those vegetables in, especially just to snack on. Just my thoughts."
Cheap_Meals,27f50r,username_00001,1 point,Fri Jun 6 02:36:03 2014 UTC,what kind of spices do you put in your rice?
Cheap_Meals,27f50r,kendall1983,2,Wed Jun 11 18:27:46 2014 UTC,"I'm going to assume you have no refrigeration. This limits you severely, because you can't buy in bulk, and are limited to small amounts of fresh vegetables and meats which you purchase just before preparation, and to canned and boxed items that either must be used all at once or can be rewrapped and stored at room temperature.  Foil wraps are always good.   You can use any meat, but fish works exceptionally well for this. Take a cleaned filet of a firm whitefish, tuna, or salmon and put on aluminum foil. Sprinkle some Badia brand sazon completa on it (this is a hispanic seasoning that makes everything it touches taste phenomenal). Add a small diced onion, 1/2 diced red or green pepper, and 2-3 discs of sliced lemon on top of the fish.. Wrap in two or three layers of aluminum foil and set on indirect heat in the bbq. The fish will steam in the water released from the onions and peppers. Check after 15 minutes, add 1 teaspoon of water and rewrap if more time is needed.  If you use ground beef, press into patties before putting on the foil. You can add jalapenos and substitute slices of orange for the lemon. Cooking time varies with the meat.  If you use chicken, boneless thighs are the meat I would choose. Pound to an even thickness before putting on the foil.  Serve with chips and homemade hummus. Drain a can of chickpeas, use a mortar and pestle (or a fork) to mash the chickpeas in a bowl until it at least becomes a chunky paste--you can keep mashing to make it smoother if you want. Stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, 1/3 of the remaining red pepper, diced up, and 1 tablespoon sazon completa, salt and pepper to taste. Corn or pita chips are good with this dip and while it tastes best if you refrigerate it, it tastes perfectly fine without any cooling."

Cheap_Meals,27f50r,mathew688,1 point,Fri Jun 6 09:24:12 2014 UTC,"A lot of people are talking about lack of refrigeration and how big of a problem it is for you, but I'm going to disagree here. People kept food cold long before we had refrigerators with iceboxes, which are basically the same thing as coolers.  I wouldn't suggest buying in HUGE amounts of bulk, but you can still make 2-3 meals worth per go and get yourself a large cooler. I have one that is a 3-day cooler, and it will hold a couple bags of ice. My recommendation would be cook whatever it is you're planning on cooking, put 1 bag of ice in the cooler, place whatever you want to keep cold into the cooler, and then place another bag of ice on top of it. The temperature of wherever you are really decides how long your icebags will last, but as long as you're not planning on storing your cooked food for more than 2 days, you should be fine with this method. Worked for me while living out of my own truck... I'd cook at a friend's house, package it all up, use the shower, and stash it in my cooler for the next couple days.  You can even use your dashboard for re-heating if you park strategically and are lucky enough to not have too much cloud cover. Place whatever it is you want hot on the dash, facing the path of the sun. Go do something for 2-3 hours. When you return, your food will be warm and ready to enjoy, unless it was cloudy/raining. Obviously not a means of actually cooking anything, but great if you want a hot meal without firing up the grill.  Don't forget to use resources like the fridge at wherever you work(assuming you're working). If you don't want to go with an actual cooler, pick up one of those over-sized lunch bags for your leftovers and put it in there."

Stir the whole thing together, season with sazon, and wrap in one flour tortilla. Enjoy with coffee, sugar and milk.  Lunch: Beans and rice (add some cabbage, carrot, dried onion, and sazon). OR a hard-boiled egg with Treet Slaw: Fry 2 ounces finely chopped Treet until crispy-brown, reserve fat. To 1 cup shredded cabbage, add 1 tablespoon shredded carrot, 1 tablespoon raisins, and the crispy Treet. Toss until blended together. To make the dressing, combine the reserved Treet fat and an equal amount of white vinegar, and 2 pinches of sazon. Toss and refrigerate. (Optional: put the beans and rice or the slaw into a tortilla and make a wrap.)  Dinner: Beans and Rice OR 2-egg omelet with diced Treet, cabbage, and raisins. Dessert is rice pudding (rice, sugar milk, egg, cinnamon and raisins) or cinnamon-toasted tortilla wedges (baste with margarine and bake with cinnamon sugar) or cinnamon coffee.  Remember that part of the variety is dictated by limited food resources. If you have an egg wrap for breakfast, a hard-boiled egg for lunch, and an omelet for dinner, you'll have used 1/2 your eggs for the whole week.  Depending on prices, you may have to alter from this menu. If tortilla wraps are too expensive where you are, maybe a loaf of white bread is 99 cents on sale. If Treet's not at your local Dollar Tree, see if there's another canned luncheon meat, or use turkey bacon instead. If you can find some ingredients cheaper, then consider getting a box of 80-100 tea bags and making iced tea to drink. (Or drink that if you don't like coffee). I usually purchase 5 pounds of white rice for $2.98 from Walmart, but 5 pounds is a lot for a week, and the extra dollar could go for other stuff.  If this is a weekly menu, then you'll save next time because you should still have margarine, vinegar, sazon and cinnamon left over. Then you can purchase bananas, canned tomatoes, potatoes and dried chopped onion to add to your menu items for more variety.  For just a little more money (about $4-5), get a whole pre-roasted chicken from the grocer instead of the two cans of Treet. Pull and shred all the meat from the bones, and refrigerate. Make a large pot of chicken stock from the bones and use that to cook the rice, and to make soup. (You may need to buy a small amount of vegetable oil in this case for the other recipes, as I use the Treet as a source of cooking fat, or you can use margarine for all your needs--I sometimes prefer the flavor of the seasoned animal fat from Treet instead of margarine.)"
Cheap_Meals,272zje,jlking3,4,Mon Jun 2 15:12:04 2014 UTC,"While I can't imagine eating highly processed canned meat daily is a great life plan, doing this for a few weeks when things are tight would surely keep you alive and feed. Great detail and thoroughness!"
Cheap_Meals,272zje,lovekeepsherintheair,3,Mon Jun 2 22:40:59 2014 UTC,"I agree with you there. In the past, I've used bacon as my go-to meat (again maybe not the healthiest), partly because I could reuse the fat that is rendered as I cook the bacon: it's loaded with flavor. Turkey bacon is still inexpensive, but wouldn't render as much fat. SPAM or Treet allow for the same rendering quality with a slightly different flavor.  If he could expand the budget to $30, I'd stick with bacon ($2.25 for 12 ounces at Deals, a Dollar-Tree-owned store) and get a 10 pound bag of refrigerated chicken leg quarters. That's more than a week's worth of chicken for one person. With the soy sauce he already has, he can do chicken fried rice, broiled chicken, chicken slaw salad (with a garlic-vinegar dressing), and add shredded chicken to beans and rice to make chicken soft tacos."

Cheap_Meals,272zje,jlking3,24,Mon Jun 2 20:26:54 2014 UTC,"Look for your proteins on sale.  That's where you'll be able to save the most.  Stuff that can only be sold for another day or two is usually deeply discounted.  Buy it then, and put it in your freezer if you're not gonna cook it within a couple of days.    You can sometimes find pork or cheap cuts of beef for under $1/lb.  If you end up with something ""tough"" like tri-tip, slice it as thin as you can across the grain.  (See Good Eats S07E07, at around the 12:50 mark if you're not familiar with why - Cliff's Notes: Makes it easier to chew.)  Check into dried beans, or lentils as well, for variety in your starch.  Depending on what seasonings you've got available, you can do a multitude of things.  I used to do a big pot of curry from time to time, would last all week.  Figure about 1lb potatoes, 1lb lb carrots, 2 lbs meat, one onion.  Sear and braise your meat, I like to saute the onions while I'm searing the meat, and leave them in the whole time.  While that's going chop all your potatoes and carrots.  Once the meat is tender, add potatoes, add carrots, cook those til they're 95% done - whatever that means for you.  Add curry seasoning, add hot sauce because curry that doesn't make you shit liquid fire isn't curry at all, and thicken.  Great because if you start off in a big pot like you'd use to boil pasta, you can do the whole dish in it.    Put it over rice is most traditional, but I've done it over just about any cheap filling starch you can think of.  About 4 oz of curry (part of the reason we made it so spicy, so you want more rice to dissipate the heat than curry) for lunch, with a big scoop of starch should be enough.  Maybe 6 or 8oz for dinner."

My additions are chicken thighs (I personally think dark meat is superior to bland white meat) which are likely the cheapest muscle of the chicken and constantly on sale.  Don't forget organ meats too - maybe not an everyday food but chicken and beef liver are cheaper than dirt. Just soak in a bit of milk to reduce bitterness, season well, and don't overcook to prevent toughness.  And dried beans can't be emphasized enough. As cheap as rice and much more nutritious and filling; use them both."

Cheap_Meals,26yxa9,robbiechopsticks,7,Sat May 31 17:42:31 2014 UTC,"Are there any kinds of dietary restrictions or preferences? Like is anyone lactose intolerant or Paleo or whatever?   Back when I was your age (just before WWI), my friends and I did much the same thing the week after high school graduation. We rented a little place just off the beach and screwed around for about a week. What we did for food, basically, was to buy basic ingredients in bulk and then prepare them different ways. I'll give you some examples:  Hamburger meat/ground chuck. We had barbecued/grilled hamburgers the first night, tacos the third night, and I think we had spaghetti in meat sauce the sixth night, all with the same big discount thing of ground chuck (70/30, so higher fat and more flavor). Be sure to wait until the very last minute to buy it, so you have a later expiration date, and be sure you seal the chuck you're not using airtight with as little air as possible, put it in the fridge, and cover the meat so there's no light.   Sandwiches and wraps work well for lunches if you're not into salads yet. Things like tuna (canned tuna, a little mayo, a little dill relish, a little chopped red onion) or Mediterranean (chicken, spinach, cucumber, parsley, a little olive oil, garlic, and tomato) are delicious, but simple and can be had on the cheap if you get the ingredients in bulk.   The same tomato you use for your sandwiches can be made into sauce or sliced and put on a grilled burger. Think about how to use basic ingredients in different combinations.   If you're super strapped for cash, rice and beans are your friend. Rice and beans together provide all basic amino acids your body requires, plus they're endlessly customizable. You can go salsa fresco, with chopped tomato, jalapeño, onion, garlic, bell pepper, oregano, salt, and pepper. You can go Japanese with green pepper, onion, carrots, broccoli, sesame oil, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, and soy sauce/shoyu. You can go Puerto Rican with adobo chilies, ham, garlic, saxon con azafran, and sofrito. You can go North African with merguez sausage, spinach, onion, garlic, cilantro, powdered cloves, ginger and nutmeg. The bulk of what you eat will simply be rice and beans, which are dirt cheap, but the little things you add here and there can make it anything you need it to be. There are even rice and beans desserts."

Another thing I do is to make pre-made meals and freeze them. For me, I usually just double up on something I'm making for dinner, and freeze half of the batch for vacation.   This works well for chili, spaghetti sauce, meatballs, lasagne, enchiladas, casseroles, BBQ, and more.   Use some of those dinner leftovers for lunches during the week. Another easy lunch is what we call ""big sub"". Make a deli sub on a big loaf of French or Italian bread (or 2), bake at 350 for 10 minutes or so until hot, cut up and serve.

Cheap_Meals,26xbct,t_maia,1 point,Sat May 31 15:11:50 2014 UTC,"The reason for the good quality of TJ store brands is that they are associated with German Aldi, who has perfectioned the store brand.   Aldi does not sell any brands at all, everything they have is store brand. They also make no secret that all their manufacturers are big name brands. They have acquired quite a reputation to buy and sell only the highest quality - because everything is housebrand, they can move production from one company to the other and they use this threat to get the quality they want.   Aldi really has the best ratio of quality to cost. In the early 1990s it used to be shameful to park your BMW in front of an Aldi, now the attitude is ""I buy only the best, thus I shop at Aldi."""

You'd just need to reduce the salt. Also, garlic, for sure! You could always add some spices, and go for an Indian taste (cumin, coriander, tumeric, cardamon) or an Italian flavour (oregano, basil, dash of balsamic or red wine), for example.

Instead of potatos (because they always sprouted on me within weeks) I would use frozen french fries. I called it ""burger and fries stew""  I'd also cook it in the slow cooker, because that's why I have it. Plus I can put the cooker on the porch if I didn't want to heat up the house.

The flavor of the meat fully comes through, since it's only cumin, salt & pepper. This recipe is also healthy as fuck. I think I stole it from a Weight Watchers magazine or something years ago.   Mexican beef over polenta:   1 pound(s) uncooked lean ground beef (or fatty beef, drained) 1 small uncooked onion(s), chopped 14 1/2 oz canned diced tomatoes, with chiles, drained, reserve 1 Tbsp of liquid 1 cup(s) canned yellow corn, drained, or frozen, thawed corn kernels 1 can black beans (optional, my addition, not part of original recipe) 10 medium olive(s), Kalamata, sliced (excellent, but can be skipped. $$$) 2 Tbsp canned jalapeno peppers, pickled, chopped (likewise optional) 3/4 tsp table salt, divided 1/4 tsp ground cumin 1/8 tsp black pepper 3/4 cup(s) polenta, quick-cooking (standard corn meal works too, but cooks slower) 3 cup(s) canned chicken broth salsa 1/3 cup shredded Mexican-style cheese 2 Tbsp cilantro, or scallion, fresh, chopped (optional, but cilantro highly recommended)   Instructions Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef and onion, stirring frequently, until meat is fully cooked, about 5 to 7 minutes; drain off any liquid. Stir in tomatoes and reserved liquid, corn, olives, jalapenos (if using), 1/4 teaspoon of salt, cumin and pepper; simmer 5 minutes to allow flavors to blend.  Meanwhile, in a small pot, combine cornmeal, broth and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt; stir well. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly, until cornmeal is thick, about 5 minutes.  Spoon polenta onto a large serving plate and top with beef mixture. Top with salsa, cheese and cilantro (or scallion). Divide into 6 portions and serve. Notes The polenta will still be soft after cooking but will firm up if allowed to stand for a few minutes before serving.   EDIT: Oh, and use low-sodium chicken broth. It has better flavor, and you can always add a little extra salt back in as needed."

Cheap_Meals,26oeza,Aaod,1 point,Thu May 29 04:23:09 2014 UTC,"I made this mock-Korean beef recipe with my SO on Friday, and it was so amazing we made it again on Sunday. It was super quick and easy, it didn't take many ingredients, and it reheats really well. The second time around we added broccoli, sliced red pepper, and carrots. We also threw in a couple of extra spices we had laying around (turmeric and yellow curry) to give it some more depth, but I'm sure it would taste fine without. It tastes exactly like what you get at those cheap ""Asian food"" places, but cheaper and better for you. The key is the sesame oil. I was able to find a 5oz bottle for $5 (which is kind of pricey, but you only need a tablespoon to really get the flavor for this recipe).  Recipe is as follows:  1 lb lean ground beef  1/2 cup brown sugar  1/4 cup soy sauce  1 Tablespoon sesame oil  3 cloves garlic, minced  1/4 teaspoon ground ginger  1/2 - 1 teaspoon crushed red peppers (depending on how spicy you like it)  salt and pepper  1 bunch green onions, diced  Rice, cooked  Directions:  Heat a large skillet over medium heat and brown hamburger with garlic in the sesame oil.

Corn on the cob (grilled is great too).  Roam through produce and see what's on sale too, veggie kababs can be cheap and yummy if you catch the right sale."
Cheap_Meals,26ngco,cmbyrd,4,Wed May 28 00:11:18 2014 UTC,Discount pork/beef might not be bad. BBQ in fact was made for this kind of lower-quality meat: if you cook ANYTHING low and slow with a bunch of seasoning its bound to taste good!

Cheap_Meals,26ngco,dicey,3,Wed May 28 00:44:56 2014 UTC,"Aside from the obvious chicken, you can find hamburger meat on sale, especially as the weather is getting warmer, for making hamburger patties. Buns tend to be super-cheap, I can regularly find them for $0.99 for a package. All hamburger meat really needs is maybe a bit of salt and pepper, as opposed to chicken which you might want to slather with barbecue sauce. You can serve them plain on the buns (which you can toast on the grill), or you can throw on mustard, ketchup (check the Dollar Stores), and maybe cheese.   For sides, it's all about watching for sales. Traditional grilled favorites are grilled corn on the cob, asparagus, or bella mushrooms, but those can be expensive so really watch for sales. My favorite side with grilled meats is baked potatoes or baked sweet potatoes. They take time, but they can be had on the cheap and they're really easy. Plus, you can always put a little oil on the skins and put them on the grill for a minute or two. Potato salad is another staple of a barbecue. On top of all that, those salad bags (again, watch for sales!) are really easy to dress up a little with some extra ingredients. Chop up some red onion, tomato, black olives, and pepperoncini, and you might actually get the kids to eat it."
Cheap_Meals,26ngco,Willravel,3,Wed May 28 01:36:06 2014 UTC,"For a side you can make foil packet veggies. Find what is in season, on sale, and/or normally bulky and cheap (squash, onions, potatoes, peppers, etc.) Chop it all up into even chunks, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic, seal up into packets and chuck on the grill.  Baked beans, potato salad, pasta salad, regular salad... all cheap sides to make in bulk.  For meat as others have said chicken will be your cheapest bet. You can buy whole roasters and cut them up or find pieces already done up and cheap, usually at .99/lb, especially dark meat. Check sales for BOGO deals and do the math to see how cheap it actually can be as well."

Especially when using ground meat which are the cheapest cut of meat.  Adding oatmeal or any other filler makes the meat less dense, which for me means a better final product."

Cheap_Meals,26kyua,eekozoid,3,Tue May 27 05:45:23 2014 UTC,Heat it up and slap it on a bun with something pickled.  Sour will balance out the flavor and cut the richness of the lard.
Cheap_Meals,26kyua,cmbyrd,2,Tue May 27 07:15:38 2014 UTC,"Rice and Beans would work pretty well.  A bit of pork in the beans adds flavor, ensures you get all of your amino acids.  Beans and rice fill you up, so you don't end up eating nearly as much of the pork.  The BBQ flavoring on the pork will fit in pretty well with the kinda Southwestern flavor of the dish.  If there is extra sauce in the package, I'd probably skip out on adding it, but I wouldn't worry about trying to rinse or scrape the sauce off either.  I would personally do something like this using the pork instead of bacon.  You could probably get away with using less than a full pound too.  I'd start with half pound, and go from there if you really want to stretch it you could go even less.    Remember, by skipping out on bacon, you're cutting salt, so make sure to check your seasoning at the end, and don't be scared to replace that salt content, putting the sauce over rice will mean it needs to flavor that too.  I'd likely add a bit of cumin and garlic as well.  Rice and beans can be really good, or can be bland as shit, and you'll only want to eat the former."

There are several different kinds but all are delicious and you can experiment with them until you find what you like in certain dishes.  Start by removing the seeds and stems from a few peppers.  Put them in a small saucepan and cover them with water.  Bring to a boil and then turn down the heat and simmer for about ten minutes.  Remove the peppers from the water.  (You can still save the water for other recipes that call for it if you want, it will impart a mild taste of chilis to whatever you make.)  Once the cooked dry peppers have cooled, blend them in a food processor with the other ingredients you typically use in salsa.  After I learned that this was one of the main uses of dry peppers, my salsas improved dramatically.  This is especially true if you use the salsa as a sauce instead of a dip (ie, if you slow cook meat in it or use it as a topping).  I hope that peaks your interest!"
Cheap_Meals,26e59q,tofketv,2,Thu Jun 5 22:41:54 2014 UTC,"Do you use the water you boiled with? If so, how much?"
Cheap_Meals,26e59q,BakerBitch,3,Sun May 25 13:13:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah! You can use as much or as little as you want depending on the consistency you want.  For a thick or chunky salsa to use a dip for tortilla chips, you wouldn't use any. For a thinner salsa to put on meat, tacos, etc. you would use some water to thin it and puree it more finely."
Cheap_Meals,26e59q,MadChef26,9,Sun May 25 18:04:28 2014 UTC,"White onions are great, but they lack some of the sweetness of red ones. So to make scrambled eggs I would caramelize them a lot longer than the red ones, to make them sweeter. Try to just cook them at low - medium heat for 10 - 15 (or longer, just be careful with the heat so it don't burn) minutes before adding the eggs and see if that helps.  Or you could just caramelize a lot of them in the slow cooker and freeze, and use that in the eggs (or anything else. It's great on burgers or in a french onion soup). To caramelize them just add 6 cut onions and some oil (half a cup or something), and stir to coat them. Then cook them on low for 10 - 14 hours. Might be wise to stir a few times toward the end, just to make sure nothing burns close to the outside. You can also remove the lid to evaporate some of the excess moisture.   Should last for a few months in the freezer.   French Onion Soup recipe:    You will need: * 1/2 cup dry sherry * 24 ounces of chicken broth *12 ounces of beef broth * 2 tablespoons soy sauce * Pepper * Some fresh thyme * Bay Leaves  Add the sherry and let the it cook off the alcohol 5-20 mins (depending on heat) Add all the other ingredients and simmer for 2 hours. Remove Bay leaves and thyme.  Then you need to make the bowls, crusty bread of your choice and gruyere cheese go on top of the cups of soup ( make sure they are oven safe) place on a baking sheet and bake for a few minutes under the broiler, until the tops turn golden."

Cheap_Meals,26e59q,Anna_Mosity,2,Sun May 25 01:00:34 2014 UTC,"Ooh! Caramelized onions!! Chop or slice the white onions and put them into a pot with just a little bit of oil (stir them around and coat them) and salt (the salt will help get the moisture out of the onions). Then, put the pot on medium-low heat and start cooking them down. Stir periodically to prevent sticking. Add some more salt if you want. The onions will turn into a mass of brown, stringy deliciousness. Add a little sugar as they're cooking, if you want. They might be sweet enough without it, or you might prefer to add more salt and pepper. The longer you cook them, the more they'll break down. If you cook them for ""too long,"" you can end up with a fantastic sweet onion spread-- also awesome! I usually caramelize 6-8 onions at a time and keep them in my fridge. They're good hot or cold, on sandwiches, on turkey TV dinners, atop mashed potatoes and steaks, in wraps and burritos... bring 'em to picnics and potlucks and make the burgers and hot dogs and boring mayo-based macaroni and potato and egg salads suddenly seem creative and gourmet.

Then add a whole onion, quartered then halved, saute. Then you want to throw in 2 tablespoons of red curry paste, let it get aromatic for about 10 seconds then add in a blender a can of light coconut milk with 1 tablespoon each of fish sauce and lime juice, toss a few cloves of garlic in there with cilantro and corn starch (about a tablespoon each) and give it a whir. Pour this into your chicken and veggies (you can also add red pepper, eggplant, zucchini, etc.) and bring it to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer for a minute and serve over rice.

Cheap_Meals,25z3l2,project1225,46,Mon May 19 21:36:18 2014 UTC,"We did this for our wedding reception, but rather than cornbread, be did baked potatoes (which the revelers then spooned chili over). Worked out great since we prepared it ourselves before hand, was super hearty, and was perfect for a crowd who was drinking heavily. I think we were out maybe only $150 for the ingredients and we fed about 100, with quite a few of those folks going for seconds.  Here's a tip. The ladle size should be inversely proportional to crowd size. We used a 1 oz. ladel. This is a clever way of regulating oversized proportions. Everyone was welcome to take as much as they wanted, but smaller spoons in the serving pot result in a lot less wasted food. It appears that when people have to spoon more, they get lazy and spoon only what they intend to eat.   Also another tip, if you make the chili in a large pot, have someone who will stir the chili constantly while it cooks. Burning chili in large pots is almost guaranteed without constant attention. If it does burn, DO NOT stir it up. Rather, leave the burnt matter on the bottom of the pot and scoop in about a half cup to a cup of peanut butter (depending on batch size, use your judgment). For some reason this removes the burnt flavor while not altering the flavor of the chili."

Cheap_Meals,25z3l2,lysandertoo,4,Tue May 20 00:17:53 2014 UTC,"Paella. You mentioned hardy yet vegetarian so you're going to need roasted vegetables, toasted and crispy rice. Umami like tomato(cheap), or seaweed or mushrooms(expensive). I like the idea of either chili or vegetable curry. If I were you id do three different meals. Paella, chili with jalapeno cornbread, and of course vegetable curry. I think that last one was a fantastic choice that I haven't seen done vegetarian before. I love curry though.  If you can you should try cutting sweet potatoes into fries, parboiling for 2 minutes. then coating with oil, and a blend of curry powder and potato starch. Bake at 425 and turn over after 14 minutes. Cook for another 14 minutes.   Serve those with kale chips. You could stuff 3 people with kale chips for about a buck. You have to watch them though if you're cooking them in an oven. Don't put them at the bottom rack. They're much easier and more forgiving in a dehydrator. Still though. I look around and only see main courses. No side dishes or snacks. Kale chips, and sauteed kale are simple as shit and delicious as fuck. Same with the curry oven roasted sweet potatoes.   For another side that is cheap but a little harder. Boil coliflour florets for 6 minutes. Shake dry and blend with butter, cream or at very least some kind of oil.   Lots of other things can be boiled or roasted then blended into a puree. Broccoli makes a fantastic soup (if blended hot). If you don't count water, salt or pepper we're talking 1 to 2 ingredient recipes here that take under 10 minutes to do. Cost about as much as goat shit but taste way better. They look amazeballs if you garnish them with vegitables and freshherbs of complimentary color. Get creative and have fun with it. But focus on your main 3 dishes, and throw in 4 or 5 purees along with the curry fries and kale chips.   Once you write out a grocery list for everything you'll see that many ingredients intertwine."

Cheap_Meals,25z3l2,snadypeepers,1 point,Tue May 20 17:48:15 2014 UTC,"This is my first draft so it might need touching up and such. It makes a lot of food on the cheap. I often make a batch and eat off of it for a week. I could also write a smaller, faster, easier version that I use for quick meals- it's pretty brotastic.  Basic:   Start with 1lb bag of dried black beans Two segments of garlic, pressed Two tablespoons of chilli powder dash of salt Cook in crock pot (preferred) until beans are soft but not 'mushy' Drain, rinse, drain well (Note I prefer to season before and after cooking) Re-season with a dash of salt, one section garlic (pressed) or two tablespoons of garlic powder (for milder flavor, less intense garlic), and three to four tablespoons of chilli powder  puree, mince, or leave mostly intact; one fist of cilantro- this really makes the dish add two or three cans of diced chillis and tomatos with liquid (1/2 for thicker yield, obviously). Usually comes in small-sh cans ~10 oz. If you're lucky, you'll find off-brands like Walmart's for <$0.70 but Herdez usually isn't much more, it should be found near the Velveeta/party 'cheese-like-foods' add one can of corn (in water), drained reheat and serve in crock pot with your choice of cheese sprinkled liberally on top. I usually use Walmart's mexican shredded cheese mix which is also their cheapest per ounce. I like the texture of corn chips and sometimes I have the 35% of the bag that's broken anyway to toss on there- taking care not to empty the high-salt-content dust onto my masterpiece. Keep this separate until serving, soggy chips are as worthless as arguing logic to a kluckster.   Options for basic recipe   You can use pinto beans (if you're a carpetbagging sissy) or a mixture of whatever beans you fancy. I prefer to keep it simple with black beans. Garlic segments can be left intact if preferred for cooking. I'm not a fan of taking a bite garlic husk so I always press mine. About two tablespoons of garlic powder may substitute per section of garlic and you probably won't hurt anyone's feelings. Costco organic salsa can be added to the final mix. WARNING: after trying Costco organic salsa, you'll likely be ruined to the more common Pace Picante/similar salsas- they simply can't compare. This stuff isn't cheap though, ~$3.30 per bottle last I checked and you have to buy them in pairs.     Fancy:   add the following to the basic recipe: one onion and two green/bell peppers, diced and sauteed in vegetable or olive oil, I usually use olive because it's handy and doesn't make too much difference IMO once veggies have been cooked to your satisfaction (I prefer mine well done), lower heat and add a bag of morning star farm immitation ground beef to defrost and season with... 2 teaspoons chilli powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder add to basic (before topping with cheese)"

Cheap_Meals,25fg9m,Mr_DNA,3,Tue May 13 20:47:12 2014 UTC,"This is quite interesting. I would think that commercial garlic powder would be heated above the required temperature (looks like 250 185 degrees F) to kill the bacteria, but I can't find that stated anywhere.  Quick note, the garlic has to be heated before being mixed and stored, not after. Heating kills bacteria that makes the botulism toxin, but I don't think it would do anything to the toxin that's already been formed. Same reason you can't buy a bulging can and just heat it up a lot to make it safe. Still has the botulinum toxin in it. According to the World Health Organization, heating to 185 degrees F for 5+ minutes will destroy the toxin, but not destroy the spores that create it. Acidic conditions will limit production of the toxin. Even if you heat up the food and destoy the toxin, the spores will still create more toxin.  Edit: I did a terrible job researching the first time. Thanks to /u/cmbyrd."

You can actually.  But being as the bulging can is going to be the same price as the undamaged one next to it, why would you?   The toxin is destroyed by heating to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for greater than 5 minutes.   The spores are more difficult to kill, but a healthy adult body will destroy them in the digestive tract - and it is the toxin that the spores produce that is dangerous, not the spores themselves."

Cheap_Meals,25fg9m,ghostofpennwast,1 point,Tue May 13 17:54:13 2014 UTC,"Muscovado:       Muscovado is a type of unrefined brown sugar with a strong molasses flavor.  Also known as ""Barbados sugar"", ""molasses sugar"" or ""moist sugar"", muscovado is very dark brown and slightly coarser and stickier than most brown sugars. Muscovado takes its flavor and color from its source, sugarcane juice. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably long shelf life. It is commonly used in baking recipes and making rum. Muscovado sugar can be used in most recipes where brown sugar is called for, by slightly reducing the liquid content of the recipe.   Muscovado sugar has 11 calories/ 4 grams (approx. 1 tsp). When produced under regulated conditions, it is nutritionally richer than other brown sugars or refined sugar, and retains most of the natural minerals inherent in sugarcane juice, as shown in this chart:   Mineral content of muscovado sugar (per 100 g):   Total mineral salts 740 mg max. Phosphorus (P) 3.9 mg max. Calcium (Ca) 85 mg max. Magnesium (Mg) 23 mg max. Potassium (K) 100 mg max. Iron (Fe) 1.3 mg max.   This unrefined sugar can be used in coffee and other beverages, and was one of the most prominent export commodities of the Philippines, especially from the Negros region from the 19th century until the late 1970s.  The production of muscovado sugar in the Philippines, Barbados, and elsewhere had experienced a long period of decline when large mills took over sugar production from small farmers with small mills until consumer interest in healthy and organic foods revived interest in muscovado sugar, creating a new market for muscovado sugar production from small mills.

Cheap_Meals,25dqoj,robmox,8,Mon May 12 20:49:44 2014 UTC,I am a huge fan of cold leftovers. Pasta? Add sauce and eat it cold. Chicken? Eat it cold with some BBQ sauce or on a sandwich. Veggies? Add a little cheese and you're good to go.

One that got brought up was crab in yellow curry being really good.  If I'm going to have crab, I'm not disturbing it with anything but butter.  But the imitation crab you can get at the grocery store?  I'm less sensitive about that.  Take a bag of frozen vegetables (preferably Asian-themed) and maybe some extra onion, a pack of fake crab (some bags are slightly bigger than others, I get the bigger one), yellow curry paste, and a big can of coconut milk.  Cook in a big pot, in that order of things.  Let simmer.  Eat over rice.  Repeat previous step."
Cheap_Meals,258zyo,spongebue,2,Sun May 11 07:08:09 2014 UTC,That's definitely bold. I don't know if I'd have thought to use faux crab in curry. You're bold. I like it.

Replace the meat in the curry with potatoes, and you've got a pretty satisfying, and inexpensive alternative.  As an added bonus, easy enough to drop the bullion cube, and it turns into a vegetarian dish.  Vegan as a matter of fact, if I'm not mistaken.  So you can feed all your hippy friends as well."
Cheap_Meals,258zyo,cdingo,1 point,Sun May 11 07:59:54 2014 UTC,The trade-off being you get little to no protein
Cheap_Meals,258zyo,cmbyrd,2,Sun May 11 20:03:40 2014 UTC,"Most Americans eat far more protein than their bodies really need anyway, skipping out on some for a meal or two isn't going to hurt.    6oz chicken breast - 51g protein, 51g protein average requirement.  If you've got any chicken breasts in your fridge, go get a scale and see how much you're really eating.  Underestimating portion sizes is  a pretty easy mistake.  I've worked in professional kitchens for 15 years, I know what a 6 oz chicken breast looks and feels like, but when I'm cooking at home I still have to make a conscious effort to control portion sizes.  Far easier to just toss the breast in a pan, and if it's 10 or 12 oz (which isn't uncommon) then whatever.  Aside from that, quinoa is a lower protein content than meat for sure, but is still a source of complete protein, so not like you're going without entirely.  You would be hard pressed to meet all of your protein requirements from it, but you can easily boost your intake (and get complete proteins, rather than partial) by using it instead of rice."
Cheap_Meals,258zyo,cdingo,2,Sun May 11 20:28:52 2014 UTC,I weigh and track everything I eat. I know how much protein I'm getting.  Just because you only need 50g of protein at the bare minimum doesn't mean you can't benefit from more of it -- especially anyone participating in physical activity or attempting to change their body comp -- which I can only assume many of the people here are attempting to do.  I think at this point we're just circlejerking over semantics. Sure it's a good idea from a financial and perhaps culinary standpoint  -- but suggesting someone use a carb in place of meat just isn't logical.

Cheap_Meals,247hmf,cmbyrd,5,Tue Apr 29 07:24:50 2014 UTC,"If you're making something like spanakopita (which would be my first guess for a spinach, cheese, and phyllo dish) you can use any sort of creamy cheese.  Cream cheese is actually a pretty decent fit for something that will have a hard time offending anyone."
Cheap_Meals,247hmf,cmbyrd,5,Mon Apr 28 21:55:41 2014 UTC,That's exactly what I wanted to make! And I love the cream cheese idea. Do you have any tips on how to cook it?
Cheap_Meals,247hmf,the_doughboy,11,Mon Apr 28 22:07:53 2014 UTC,"As a matter of fact... I do (=  It is nice, but not at all necessary to have some diced up shallots, onion, garlic, leeks, or other similar stuff sauteed up in the pan.  I'd pick one or two of those at most.  If you choose to add them, chop very fine (1/8"" cubes kind of small) and once they're almost done cooking, put your spinach in your saute pan, medium heat.  It will wilt, turn dark green, and leak water out.  Once all of it is wilted, dump the water down the drain.  Add in a bit of heavy cream, some creamy cheese, let it melt, mix every few minutes.  If you use cream cheese, I also tend to use a bit of Parmesan for some extra flavor.  Feta brings it's own kick to the party, as would goat, but if your base is bland, your food is bland.  At the end, I normally hit it with a squeeze of lemon, salt and pepper to taste.  Go a touch heavier on the salt than you think is needed, because the spinach needs to season the phyllo as well.  While you're getting a melted gooey delicious spinach dip, prepare your phyllo.  Sometimes you see spanakopita as individual 1-2 bite triangles or purses, sometimes as a casserole, whichever you prefer is fine.  Lay down a layer of dough, brush with melted butter (I'm assuming you're using unsalted butter to cook with.  If not, ignore my advice about the excess salt in the spinach from above.  Also, get unsalted butter), layer of dough, butter, etc.  3-4 is probably enough for bite sized appetizers, if you want to make a meal of it though I'd go 5-7 on the thin side.  If you're making little bite sized deals, go with less spinach than you think, they get thick pretty quickly.  If you're making a casserole, go with as much as you want, the dough on top will puff up some, but not a great amount, and it can support it's own weight, so just don't overfill your dish and it will be fine.  Bake it hot, your phyllo box will likely have instructions, don't skimp on the pre-heating, and if you've got a pizza stone (or a couple of bricks - no, I'm not joking, they retain heat wonderfully) to put in the bottom of the oven it will help stabilize the temperature when you have to open the door.  Brushing a bit of butter, or better yet egg wash, on the dough a couple of minutes before it's done will help get that delicious deep golden brown that everyone goes sploosh for."

I certainly wouldn't buy mine from a Kroger or Publix...  That said, I am also a giant food snob, Le Cordon Bleu trained, and have about 10 years of experience in the kinds of professional kitchens that are more prone to source locally or make their own fresh cheese than they are to buy pre-packaged stuff that might be a couple of months old (plus a few more years in bullshit restaurants when I was in high school and such).

I have cooked pasta in a microwave before, you either have to break the pasta straws in half to fit (they all have to be submerged in water or they will dry out and burn, turning dark brown) or you cook it slowly by heating the water to a boil, then folding the pasta in as it softens.

Pasta is what you're looking for, if you're looking to save money. If you're looking for the cheapest option, I'd do hamburger helper and shitty meat. If you're looking to come off as a good cook/fancy, I'd go the Asian aisle of your grocery store (or Asian foods restaurant) and get vegetable soba noodles ($2 worth is usually enough), peanut sauce ($4-6), broccoli, bell pepper, onion, and garlic.  If the second option, cook the onion and garlic in butter for 5 minutes, then add the bell pepper and broccoli for 5 more, then add the peanut sauce for 2 minutes, then toss in the (cooked) pasta. Stir and it's ready. As an added bonus, it can be served room temperature and still be delicious."

Cheap_Meals,23y3vs,theryanmoore,1 point,Fri Apr 25 15:08:34 2014 UTC,Legit. Was there a certain time each day that they got rid of them or did you just have to rifle through what they had?

It seems to me that people (including myself) have problems understanding what their own time is worth to them, and how much money can be saved by putting in a small amount of effort and timeliness.

Cheap_Meals,23y3vs,requiay,11,Sat Apr 26 07:39:23 2014 UTC,It's the ends of sandwich meat that they can't really cut nicely in the slicer.
Cheap_Meals,23y3vs,kennious,5,Fri Apr 25 13:32:44 2014 UTC,yeah. Also they throw in the extras from whenever they cut too much for a customer. That's probably what this tray was because it was a small amount of each meat and the cuts were pretty normal. You can usually tell when it's actual ends because the cuts are wonky.
Cheap_Meals,23y3vs,kennious,3,Fri Apr 25 13:38:54 2014 UTC,These are also great for homemade pizza; I usually stock up on them whenever I'm at the deli and freeze them for later.

Alternatively, you can add cayenne pepper, cumin, and coriander to taste.  Chopped parsley, garlic, and sesame seeds optional.   Steps:    Roughly chop onions, garlic, and parsley.  Rinse canned beans with water.  Combine all ingredients (except for the bread crumbs, flour, and flax seed) into a food processor or blender. I used a cheap blender and I had to frequently move the ingredients around with a spoon.  Once all garbanzo beans are sufficiently mashed, add the flaxseed and flour. Add a small amount of bread crumbs to absorb some of the moisture.  Role the mixture into balls and roll balls around in bread crumbs. Flatten balls into disc and attempt to coat the disc with bread crumbs some more.  Fry in 1/2 inch of oil over medium heat. Flip when bottom side is crispy. Set aside on paper lined plated. Serve with hummus, Greek yogurt, ranch sauce, salad dressing anything! For my dipping sauce, I combined Greek yogurt, Trader Joe's Goddess dressing, sea salt, and Harissa seasoning.

Cheap_Meals,222vb9,random_dent,2,Thu Apr 3 18:23:28 2014 UTC,"only one that ive used that called for butter AND heavy cream was giada de lorentes, or whatever her name is.  her recipe is basically butter, heavy cream, lemon zest, and some parm.  really it just makes you feel like you're eating butter and lemon.  i would not say thats desirable.  the best one ive made used heavy cream and cream cheese.  the cream cheese has some commercial thickeners that really help give it a good texture.  and the flavor is good too."
Cheap_Meals,222vb9,aManPerson,3,Thu Apr 3 19:20:32 2014 UTC,"The only alfredo recipe I ever used is passed down from my grandmother. It's butter, heavy cream and parmesan cheese. You can add other seasonings, but I usually don't beyond a bit of black pepper.  That's the only way I've really seen it done anywhere.  TIL some people make Alfredo without butter."
Cheap_Meals,222vb9,random_dent,1 point,Thu Apr 3 19:25:25 2014 UTC,"here's what i use (fuck, i was wrong, it does have butter in it):  INGREDIENTS   1 1/2cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Table salt 1/2teaspoon ground black pepper 9 ounces fresh fettuccine 1 1/2ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (about 3/4 cup) 1/8 teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg   INSTRUCTIONS   Bring 4 1/2 quarts water to rolling boil, covered, in large stockpot or Dutch oven. Using ladle or heatproof measuring cup, fill each individual serving bowl with about 1/2 cup boiling water; set bowls aside to warm. While water comes to boil, bring 1 cup heavy cream and butter to simmer in 3- to 4-quart saucepan over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer gently until mixture reduces to 2/3 cup, 12 to 15 minutes. Off heat, stir in remaining 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon salt and pasta to boiling water; cook pasta until just shy of al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta cooking water, then drain pasta. Meanwhile, return cream mixture to simmer over medium-high heat; reduce heat to low and add pasta, Parmesan, and nutmeg to cream mixture. Cook over low heat, tossing pasta with tongs to combine, until sauce coats pasta and pasta is just al dente and cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in reserved pasta cooking water; sauce may look rather thin but will gradually thicken as pasta is served and eaten. Working quickly, empty serving bowls of water; divide pasta among bowls, tossing pasta to coat well with sauce. Serve immediately.   NOTES  -add the zest of one lemon  -add a tablespoon of italian seasoning  -do save pasta water, about 3 cups, the heat from the noodles and sauce makes the pasta absorb the sauce, it becomes very dry and thick.  -as the sauce cooled, it clumped up.  i think it needs some starch to cling to.  the notes are my own observations/recomendations to try different next time.  i normally just microwave all the alfredo stuff in the microwave."
Cheap_Meals,222vb9,aManPerson,1 point,Thu Apr 3 19:42:13 2014 UTC,"simple recipe I came across in college, makes 6 servings of sauce  1 cup each: parmesean/milk/cream cheese/butter.

I recommend softening the cream cheese by leaving it out of the fridge for a bit before starting the sauce. Start with the cream cheese and butter, then add parmesean and milk until smooth."

Shallots - Works as stand in for onion and/or garlic, saving an ingredient on the packing list where I would otherwise have both, and delicious in it's own right. Butter - Delicious as whole butter, and can cook with it as an oil after you clarify.  Fat to balance the acid in food.  Solids are useful for sauces to boot. Wine - Acid to brighten sauces, balance flavors.  De-glaze pans.  Something to drink. Chicken - Dark meat?  Yep.  White meat?  Yeah.  Stock?  Sure thing. Eggs - What do you mean I can't count this as part of the chicken?  FINE!  Be that way.  Eggs are still worth bringing.  Hundreds of ways to use eggs in a kitchen. Lentils - Versatile starch.  Lentil burgers are better than bean burgers too, IMO, for when I get tired of eating chicken. Flour - Once again, primarily for it's many uses.  Flat bread, pasta, thickening agent, the list goes on.  Depending on where I was stranded, I might get some really good sourdough going on too. Tomato - As a veggie, as a salad, as a sauce.  Tomatoes go everywhere and do everything. Peas - Another veggie that does a lot.  Soups, salads, goes in pasta. Strawberries - Sometimes you need a treat.  Delicious on their own, cooked down they make pretty a pretty good sweet syrupy mess to put on bread in the morning, or make desert with.  This is my only real toss up.  Could be figs, could be oranges, some sort of sweet fruit is the only real requirement I could come up with.   I have left out seasonings, because they're seasonings not ingredients.  I'll assume salt at very least is available.  Same with water, fire, pans to cook with."

Cheap_Meals,20vo0m,deltalitprof,1 point,Fri Mar 21 02:17:17 2014 UTC,"I feel like a lot of the prices are misleading.   I never have to buy stuff at Kroger that isn't on sale for cheaper than the normal listed price.   I don't think I have ever paid more than $1 for Barilla spaghetti because it's on 'sale' so often.   Tyson isn't a brand I see at Kroger even in Arkansas where Tyson is based.    I see Sanderson Farms Chicken breasts on sale for 2.99 probably once a month, and their sales generally last a week, but I prefer thighs anyway and usually pick them up for $0.99-1.39.  I wouldn't buy packaged deli meat either.  It's measured by weight and seems to be a lot more watery than stuff from the deli counter.   If I can pick up some Private selection for 5.99-6.99 a lb I do just as good as the packaged stuff and it tastes a whole lot better.   Salad dressings Kroger likes to put on sale a lot.  I don't ever pay more than 2 dollars for one, and I don't like the Kroger brand dressings.   Also Kroger sends out Kroger specific coupons about once a month for things you already have a history of buying, and since things I buy are often on sale I can usually couple the coupon with a sale price.  Also with each booklet they usually send 2 free item coupons.  I usually end up with a free salad dressing or bag of cheese.   These are some reasons I tend to favor Kroger over Walmart.  I was a Walmart shopper for a couple years before realizing how much less I tend to spend at Kroger.  Additionally I don't have to deal with the rednecks at my local Walmart."

Also, not really stir fry.  You don't simmer stir fry.  Here's the beef stir fry recipe that I use:   1 lb round steak (or whatever cheap cut of beef I can find) 1 medium onion, sliced pick 2 veggies (I usually use carrots and broccoli or green beans; can be fresh or frozen); ~1/2 lb each  few cloves of garlic, minced 3 Tbsp cooking oil 1 Tbsp fresh ginger (~1 inch of ginger root, grated) 1 Tbsp soy sauce 1 Tbsp cooking sherry/apple juice   Sauce:   1/4 cup chicken broth 1/4 cup soy sauce 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar 2 tsp sesame oil 1 tsp sugar 1 tsp red pepper flakes   Glaze:   1 Tbsp cornstarch 1 Tbsp chicken broth   Slice the beef as thin as you can (helps if it's half-frozen), then set aside in a bowl.  Marinade in soy sauce and sherry/apple juice.  Cut up your veg and prep the garlic and ginger.  Make the sauce and glaze, and set them aside.  Heat your pan, then add 1 Tbsp oil.  Add half your beef and cook, stirring frequently, for a couple minutes until it browns a bit.  Remove, add more oil and do the other half.  You can do it all at once, but doing it half at a time lets you get it browned and keeps the pan hot.  Add a bit more oil and your onions.  Saute until glassy, then add your veg, garlic, and ginger.  Keep it on high heat and stir until your veggies start to soften slightly (no more than 5 minutes, usually).  If stuff starts sticking, add a bit of water (no more than a tbsp at a time).  It takes some practice to judge this, so don't be too bummed if you don't get nice, crispy veggies the first time.  Reduce heat and add your beef and sauce.  Stir for just a minute to get everything coated, then remove from heat and add your glaze.  That'll bind the sauce to the food.  Serve over rice.  You could probably substitute the sauce in the posted recipe (soy sauce, hot sauce, and honey) for the one that I use if you wanted."

Cheap_Meals,20lytx,zpkmook,14,Tue Mar 18 02:19:39 2014 UTC,Nutrition aspects should factor in this. Get whole wheat bread or just a more airy loaf (like real bakery bread) as this will have less calories and taste better. Baby carrots and any prepped veggies sounds like a decent snack and can go with the hummus too. Nut butters and bread could also work. Mixed nuts is also a good easy idea.  IDEA: Movie theaters should sell mixed nuts not covered in chocolate and sugar.

Also, why would you add the seasonings to the water to boil instead of adding them to the sauce to cook them in and get the actual flavor?  If you want to add water to get all the cheese sauce out, reserve some of the pasta water and use that- it will add extra flavor and a bit of thickness to the sauce.  You could also try to buy whole pepperoni stick chunks and cutting them into pieces instead of using pre-sliced to give you meatier chunks.  Making your own cheese sauce would also be marginally more expensive and taste a lot better."

I've also done it without freezing them and can't really say I find much of a difference in taste/texture when I freeze them and when I don't.  One thing that I find makes a big difference is adding a little cheese.  Even a small amount.  Without it, the eggs end up much drier.  The cheese, even if you can't taste it just makes it a nicer texture (IMO)."

Cheap_Meals,20a3at,fridgetarian,2,Fri Mar 14 00:48:52 2014 UTC,"Empanada:       An empanada (Spanish and Portuguese; also called pastel in Brazilian Portuguese and pate in Haitian Creole) is a stuffed bread or pastry baked or fried in many countries in Southern Europe, Latin America, the Southwestern United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The name comes from the Galician, Portuguese, and Spanish verb empanar, meaning to wrap or coat in bread.  Empanadas are made by folding dough or bread around stuffing, which usually consists of a variety of meat, cheese, huitlacoche, vegetables or fruits, among others.

Cheap_Meals,1zkdgw,vidproducer,1 point,Wed Mar 5 18:32:37 2014 UTC,"Season, sear, braise em.  Chill in fridge overnight.    Scrape fat off the braising liquid, what remains is good for making gravy - just add roux.  Pull out the legs, skin off, bones out (watch out for the second bone, it's tiny and easy to miss, but you don't want to eat it).  Break the meat into smallish chunks.  Portion into ziplock bags and freeze.  Bones are good for another go at making chicken stock.  Meat is ready to go whenever you want to make pasta with chicken, or pot pies, or soups, or whatever else you'd want small pieces of chicken in.  My personal favorite way to use em is to make potpie.  Use the braising liquid, roux to make the gravy.  Add in peas/carrots from a frozen bag.  Add in chicken meat.  Mix, season.   Galette dough isn't difficult to make, and is great on top, but something like a tube of biscuits works very nearly as well, and is much much easier.  Pie dough or puff pastry can work equally well.  I like to do mine in French Onion Soup crocks, and make them individually, but in a casserole dish works too.  Bake til the topping is cooked and flakey golden delicious."

Cheap_Meals,1zg4wk,UESC_Durandal,1 point,Tue Mar 4 07:37:44 2014 UTC,Yeah? That's pretty standard for my area. Just out of curiosity how much do you pay for those items?
Cheap_Meals,1zg4wk,UESC_Durandal,3,Tue Mar 4 06:59:21 2014 UTC,"I suppose it could be where you live, but that still seems pretty high. I'm in oregon, but the prices of items like this seem to be about what my friends in other states have found. What area are you in, out of curiosity?  English muffin - $0.99 - 1.99 depending on sales for 6-8 Eggs - $0.99 - 1.50 a dozen for large if I just buy them by the dozen.  Decent quality cheese (like tillamook / bandon) - ~ $2.50 - 3.00 / lb   That's just everyday prices. If there's a good sale or if I shop in bulk or if I find it at the discount grocery it will be far cheaper. When I see prices like you list I tend to assume that someone has just gone to the closest convenient grocery store and grabbed the first name brand they recognize off the shelf without checking the ads or planning ahead.  That said, anything that enlightens people to understand that those convenience favorites are easily cooked at home, often tasting better and being healthier, is a good thing!  There is a lot you could do to make that sandwich taste 200% better with almost no additional effort by just changing the preparation method:   Cook the egg in a pan. Microwaves are basically the worst way to cook eggs. You don't get the slow heat and butter infusion that a pan gives. If you want a puck shape (like micky dees) so it stays on the muffin / bagel / whatever... cut both ends off a shallow can (tuna, cat food, whatever) and clean it for use on the stove. You can get special egg shapes, but I just use a tuna can I've cleaned really well (careful taking it out, the edges can get hot). If you want the eggs scrambled, just fold them in the pan.  Cook the ham (and stay away from that slice of turkey). For the love of science, maillard is your friend. Brown = flavor.  Butter. Really... it's not that bad for you in moderate quantities and it's 100% flavor. Use a little butter in the pan with your eggs. Anyone that cooks eggs with oil or in the microwave without butter and wonders why they come out flavorless and off putting... it's the lack of cooked in butter. Eggs really ""like"" certain seasonings... butter, tarragon, paprika, black pepper, mustard... there's a reason why those are commonly used in egg dish preparation. Cook on low temp with butter, add some tarragon, salt, and pepper and you are suddenly dining in a fancy restaurant. Toast your bread products then lightly butter them (butter semi-optional... maybe). Toasting both builds flavor and relaxes the gluten strands to make the bread both crunch and tasty as well as less stale. Avoid anything labeled ""low fat"", ""reduced fat"", ""lite"", etc. It's inherently worse for you and less flavorful. That entire article smacks of the ""health"" fad diets of the 80's. People in the comments are counting calories and extolling egg whites as miracle food. Terrible. At least the author mentions about the health benefits of eggs.   When written out, that sounds like a lot more work, but in reality it would take the same amount of time. Most of the steps can be achieved directly in the pan at once if you use the range top and you will have much more control over the final product."

Cheap_Meals,1zg4wk,yiggity_yag,1 point,Tue Mar 4 14:01:15 2014 UTC,It takes like 2 minutes to cook an egg on both sides. You don't even need to scramble it and dirty a bowl. Just break the yolk when you're cooking the egg. It's easy to control the size of the egg patty by using a spatula to pull it back until it takes form. Have a bagel/english muffin in the toaster during this time. Throw egg on bagel and throw piece of cheese on top. Heat from bagel and egg will melt cheese. Throw a slice of ham on there too. It will warm from the heat.  Not trying to be an ass but does this really warrant a thread? Breakfast sandwiches are insanely easy to make.

Cheap_Meals,1z9xaz,graphictruth,2,Sun Mar 2 02:18:55 2014 UTC,"I'd julienne the beets (do you have the greens?) and the zucchini (courgette) - the courgette lengthwise, so it's essentially long noodles. If you have the greens, rinse well and cut into strips.  Now, toss the beets in a shallow pan with some vinegar and water. Balsamic if you have it but malt vinegar will work just fine. Leftover vinegar packets from chips, perhaps? Throw a bullion cube in there (beef, ideally) if you have it. You will want the beets to be just covered with liquid.  If you have the greens, toss some in, particularly the stems. But not too much and not for too long, so treat them as I say for the zuchinni. They can be a bit bitter.  Now, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and allow it to simmer uncovered until the liquid has been reduced by a third to a half. Toss in the zucchini strands and stir rapidly to coat them. Taste, spice with what you have and keep it on simmer, stirring, until the zucchini is softened.   Strain, reserving liquid. Return liquid to pan and reduce further while plating the veggies. Place plates in a warm oven while you continue the reduction - you want it a bit viscous. (you could cheat and add a bit of cornstarch if the flavor is intense enough that concentrating it more would seem like a bad thing.) If it's bitter, add sugar in tiny increments, stirring, until it tastes right.   While doing this, you could opt to toss in the cherry tomatoes or alternately, give them a quick roast over the burner. use tongs, a bbq skewer or a fork you do not love.    When the tomatoes are a bit wrinkly with signs of flame contact, plate them. Add reserved raw greens, if any, spoon sauce over the plate (s) as decoratively as you wish, and serve.

If you can support the abandonment of chemical fertilizers that might (and often do) have a negative effect on nature, I think you should do it."
Cheap_Meals,1z8ajc,lack_of_ideas,2,Sat Mar 1 15:32:34 2014 UTC,"For ethical treatment you have to find companies that expressly advertise ethical treatment.  Often you can buy humanely raised meat from local farms at the farmers market. You can ask the people working at other stalls if they know who raises humanely. You can also ask the farmers if you can visit their farm.   I try to buy more organic because I don't want to support Monsanto. Also because it's better for the ecosystems around the farms to not dump round up all over a field. Just reading about mono-cropping creeps me out. A field of tomatoes that all look the same with out any weeds or bugs? The earth and its organisms have had millions of years to figure out a system that works for them that includes weeds, bugs, and wild animals it's fucking presumptuous of us to think that we should change that."

Cheap_Meals,1ysjfc,Explorer21,4,Mon Feb 24 13:18:48 2014 UTC,"Pick up a wok, and try some stir-fry over rice. (You can do it in a skillet, too, just it's easier with a wok.) Stir fry is quick to make and incredibly versatile, and can make good use of the local produce. Avail yourself of some soy or hoisin or oyster sauce to flavor your foods. I was told that pork and fish are relatively easy to acquire, so you could probably do a lot of stuff with pork chops and ribs or braised fish. Tofu is pretty easy to dress up and eat (easy idea: briefly fry up some scallions, pour over warm cubed medium-firmness, drizzle with soy sauce).   Honestly, eating like the locals do is a good (and cheap) way to making the most of your money, but you'll have to get used to the local flavor."

And you've nailed it.   The hot plate is essentially an electric stove, so anything you could do one one of those, do on your hotplate.  Because cost is an issue, eat what is cheap locally rather than trying to make the Western dishes you are accustomed to.  One minor thing to note - I'm not 100% sure that it will translate, but when I was in Japan you could get a rice cooker for less than 5USD, and frequently closer to $2-3, at a thrift store.  May be worth checking around.  A rice cooker is insanely versatile with a little imagination.  On the porridge setting, it's essentially a slow cooker.  Use it as a steamer for veggies/dumplings, or to heat up soups, all sorts of things."

Cheap_Meals,1yjipi,chatatwork,3,Fri Feb 21 15:52:27 2014 UTC,"Caldo verde: NSFW ?      Caldo verde (pronounced: [ˈkaɫdu ˈveɾðɨ], Portuguese for ""green broth"") is a popular soup in Portuguese cuisine.   The basic traditional ingredients for caldo verde are potatoes, collard greens (although kale may be substituted), olive oil and salt. Additionally garlic or onion may be added. Some recipes add meat, such as ham hock, making it similar to Italo-American wedding soup. The soup is usually accompanied by slices of chouriço or linguiça (boiled separately with that water being discarded, the sausage added last minute to the soup), and with Portuguese broa cornbread for dipping.  In Portugal, caldo verde is typically consumed during Portuguese celebrations, such as weddings., birthdays, and popular celebrations, for example, the St. John party, in Porto. It is sometimes consumed before a main course meal or as a late supper.  Caldo verde originated from the Minho Province in northern Portugal.  Today, it is a traditional national favourite that has spread across the nation and abroad. References to the soup appear in many novels by Camilo Castelo Branco.

Cheap_Meals,1yjipi,randomnessish,2,Sat Mar 1 17:02:07 2014 UTC,"I would add that you want to add the kale LAST. the important part to remember is that meats cook slower than veggies, and greens cook nearly in a heartbeat. In your photo your kale looks a little overcooked to me - I'd say add the chorizo first and only add the kale after everything else is cooked. Stir it in in batches until it's all wilted, that way you'll still get some nice fresh texture and taste."
Cheap_Meals,1yjipi,NOREMAC84,2,Fri Feb 21 18:36:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, I do like my soup vegetables pretty soft and the kale does seem to take awhile to cook. The chorizo on the other hand doesn't take much time to cook when sliced up. But I imagine that less cooked kale retains the nutrients better!"
Cheap_Meals,1yjipi,randomnessish,2,Fri Feb 21 19:28:17 2014 UTC,"It's true, chorizo is pretty quick and root veggies like potatoes and turnips can be comparatively slow. It's just a question of knowing a general idea of when to throw them in, but even tough greens like kale can cook quickly.  And also a matter of taste, bc I like my greens still somewhat crunchy even!!  So totally the opposite haha.   ALSO I make a lot of soup (duh, it's cheap, nutritious, easy, and tasty as hell) and generally I sauté my onions in some olive oil at the bottom of the pot first before adding the stock to simmer. It gives them a really tasty flavor...but then again I've never added raw onions to anything, I always sauté them first, so who knows. But I feel like it negates the strong taste of raw onion."
Cheap_Meals,1yjipi,Whosawhatchit,2,Fri Feb 21 19:44:43 2014 UTC,"Everybody has their preferences!  As for the onions, I add it mostly because it's cheap and adds texture. At least with yellow or sweet onions, they don't add much to the flavor and it's certainly not strong (in this soup overall, the chorizo and kale perhaps overpower any onion flavor). I guess I never thought of sautéing the onions because that's just one more step."

Cheap_Meals,1xzapv,crazycoffin,9,Sun Feb 16 11:36:09 2014 UTC,"Finely chop mushrooms and brown them with butter and mix into the mince before using. Mushrooms are packed with umami and help increase savoriness. If you make a dish using tomato, like a meat sauce for pasta, simmer in some anchovy until it melts away. More umami and a depth of flavor. It won't taste fishy unless you use a ton. If you make chili, add a spoonful of cocoa powder. It adds complexity.  If you're just doing burgers, go crazy with spices! You could add cumin, chili powder, paprika, and cinnamon for an earthy flavor. Oregano, thyme, onion powder, granulated garlic, paprika, and black pepper would be a Cajun type of flavor. Basil, marjoram, oregano, and thyme for Italian.   Ground meat is a great palette for adding flavors. You can mix in some hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, add ketchup or tomato sauce, shredded cheese, taco seasoning, chili powders, or just use salt and pepper. In my experience, you just tend to have to use a lot since ground meat tends to suck up flavors."

A heaping tablespoon of mayo on a plate, with two large eggs and 24 twists of black pepper, beaten with a knife,to lift in and add air. Get the pan hot, add butter so it sizzles. Add chopped onion, any chopped onion, spring , red , sweet, play around. Pour the freshly whipped egg goo into the pan, rotate the pan for equal distribution, add cheese to half. Yup, just like the onion, any cheeze, cheddar, brie, provalone, what yo got. Moniter that puppy, while the egg still has some softnesss, fold the non cheese half over the cheeze half. Immediately toss in half an ounce of liquid, you can use water, I prefer whiskey. Slam a lid on the pan , it will puff up and infuse the omelette. Let that sucker steam for forty seconds. Yay !.

Cheap_Meals,1xpujc,AuntieAndie,12,Wed Feb 12 19:11:31 2014 UTC,"Bean and rice dishes are your least expensive option and aren't difficult to prepare. Get into the habit of soaking a cup of beans each night in three cups of water. You will have three cups of beans when they are done, enough for three meals. Use bulk nuts to add flavor and fats. Do you have a Winco grocery store in your area? I can give you a great many tips on prep, shopping, costs, etc."
Cheap_Meals,1xpujc,ablebodiedmango,4,Wed Feb 12 17:08:19 2014 UTC,"Mm, don't have Winco nearby, sorry. I live in NYC so doubt there are many go-to grocery stores nearby. Hell, even nearest Aldi requires 3 subway transfers."
Cheap_Meals,1xpujc,MNVapes,27,Wed Feb 12 17:21:40 2014 UTC,"NYC? shit, then you're in ethnic market heaven.  Go to Asian, Hispanic, and green grocer/farm market grocers for all your produce/meat/fish needs.  They're not prettied up and 'sanitary' looking as supermarkets, but their produce quality is as good or better (and much cheaper).  If you want some ingredients for Indian dishes and the like, you NEED to go to Jackson Heights in Queens.  It's worth the drive/subway ride.  There are blocks of subcontinent stores and the entire community is South Asian. It can also help if you're feeling homesick."
Cheap_Meals,1xpujc,NorthOfUptownChi,12,Wed Feb 12 20:00:13 2014 UTC,I would recommend checking out the Hispanic and Asian markets for fresh produce. They oftentimes have ridiculously low prices and sometimes the produce is much better than what the supermarkets are offering.  Learn to make and love burritos. They're dirt cheap and can be made in a variety of calorie dense ways.
Cheap_Meals,1xpujc,CivilDiscussions,2,Wed Feb 12 17:32:48 2014 UTC,"Get a friend who has a car to run you to Aldi and check it out and load up.  Checkout online grocery delivery, too.

I live in East Harlem, which is great for cheapo food - so going by my metric, try not to spend more than 90 cents for a can of beans or something, and like $8 for a five-pound bag of rice?  A good calorie-packer which is cheap is coconut rice with red beans - get a can of red beans (89 cents at my grocery store), a cup of white rice (I use jasmine), and a can of coconut milk ($1?).  Put to boil the cup of rice with one cup water, can of coconut milk, and beans.  Simmer on low until rice is fluffy.  Mix, and enjoy!  Rice and beans is so good and a GREAT way to pack on the pounds :)  Where are you from if you don't mind my asking?

Cheap_Meals,1xpujc,Sondalsta,5,Wed Feb 12 21:10:41 2014 UTC,"I don't know the grocery markets there very well. If it's like a lot of Chicago, you'll want to search out Indian, Asian, Mexican markets. They'll tend to have prices much cheaper than Whole Foods or similar. I know India is part of Asia but in my mind Asian groceries here means Chinese/Korean/Japanese. Indian stores tend to be separated out.  Also see if you're near ""DEAL$"" at all. That's Dollar Tree, so it will be a lot of $1 or just over $1 stuff, and you'll find a lot of stuff like flavored rices and sauces and stuff. Assuming it has the same mix of goods as Dollar Tree in Chicago.  Fake meat is the one thing I haven't really been able to find cheaply, if you eat lots of fake meat. Tofu you can usually get at Asian stores but Seitan and other stuff I end up breaking down and buying it at Whole Foods and grumbling about how much it costs."

Cheap_Meals,1xpujc,CivilDiscussions,3,Wed Feb 12 21:51:21 2014 UTC,"Pretty much the same, except I know where some of the specific supermarkets are in Minneapolis. Like, most of the Asian markets are on Eat Street in Minneapolis (Nicollet between Franklin and 28th). I used to shop at Hai Nguyen Market regularly.  Also, if I lived in Minneapolis now, I'd be shopping at the corner of Franklin Ave and 14th Ave regularly. You've got Aldi and Dollar Tree in one parking lot, and Family Dollar right behind them. The three of those together are where I do about 90% of my shopping nowadays. If you've never been to a Dollar Tree, you have to check it out. Everything is $1, most of it is a good value, and they have a lot of dry goods and even some frozen food. (Bag of frozen potstickers for $1? Yes, please.) Don't pay more than $1 for stuff like toothpaste and mouthwash and soap, IMHO."

They say if you go with a very specific idea of what you need you can usually do really well when it comes to cost and (according to them) it can be similar in price to Cub or Rainbow and cheaper than Target. I go to Lund's because it's close and I'm lazy but it can be much more expensive, although they have some really great BOGO deals, and $5 rotisserie chicken on Fridays that will last me an entire weekend. None of these things are going to be cheaper than the suggestion of just going to the ethnic markets though."

Dice up some onion, peppers, broccoli, snap peas, carrots, etc- basically any veggie you like- and some meat like chicken breast, or tofu if you like that sort of thing. Saute your meat/tofu in oil with garlic powder, salt, pepper, whatever seasoning you're in the mood for. Add veggies. sautee with seasonings, eat over rice or noodles. You can literally do this with any combo of meat/veg/seasoning/side. In the mood for asian? Add some ginger, a tiny bit of sesame oil, bok choy, and serve with soy sauce over rice. BOOM"

Cheap_Meals,1xorzt,tr0gdar,3,Wed Feb 12 08:50:32 2014 UTC,"Crab salad needs no recipe. The key is tasting it a lot. If you had to get one ingredient, I'd say some celery or shallots would go a long way in boosting the flavor and stretching out that crab a bit--8 oz of crab is not a lot for crab salad. Mix all your ingredients together sans seasonings (crab, pepper, mayo, etc) and then start adding things in. I'd start with Old Bay (classic), garlic powder, and lemon juice. Start with small quantities; you can always add more, but taking it out is a bit harder. Add shredded lettuce at the end and gently fold it in; you don't want to bruise it up a bunch with lots of mixing. Put Sriracha on the top of whatever you end up serving it in/on for an extra punch. I'd recommend some New England style hot dog buns (double thick buns used for lobster roll up there) brushed with a bit of melted butter and broiled until golden brown. Just fill that roll up with your crab salad and go to town. If you make it earlier than you plan on eating it, it only gets better with some time in the fridge. Good luck!"

The only exception is that it doesn't have as nice a texture if you thaw it and try to eat raw.

Cheap_Meals,1xee5y,jivanyatra,8,Sun Feb 9 02:52:55 2014 UTC,"Frozen is perfect for soups like Gordon Ramsay's super simple broccoli soup.   Boil some water in a pot with a lid. Honestly, you don't need that much. When it's rolling, add the broccoli and a decent amount of salt. Lid it up. You only need to boil it for a few minutes maximum. Frozen is parboiled and will cook in 3 min or so. You'll know it's done when a butter knife slides right through easy. If it smells like broccoli farts, you've over cooked it.   Take the broccoli out and put it in a blender while it's still hot. Add a bit of your broccoli stock. Salt and pepper to taste. Blend.   Serve in bowls. He recommends goat cheese, but I like a mix of cheddar and Jack. You could make the soup with hot chicken or vegetable stock in the blender instead of the water if you want something with more robustness. Sautéed garlic and onions in a tiny amount of butter would also work. But honestly, while it may benefit from that stuff, it doesn't need it."
Cheap_Meals,1xee5y,kswyo,6,Sun Feb 9 12:23:14 2014 UTC,I add it to pasta dishes. I say dishes loosely lol... we love it in our mac and cheese :) add it after the water boils and let the water start boiling again before you add pasta.  It's good steamed too.   Or in a vegetable soup with a cheese roux.   I've never switched the two so I don't know how frozen and fresh compare. I usually use fresh as a snack and frozen cooked into meals.   Good luck!

Cheap_Meals,1xee5y,aManPerson,2,Sun Feb 9 03:17:51 2014 UTC,"I chop it up and add it to a ton of stuff -- pasta, scrambled eggs, etc. It even adds some nutritional value and flavor to cheap stuff like generic macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles.   One of my favorite inexpensive, easy things to do, though, is make teriyaki chicken and broccoli:   Brine/marinate chicken (I use thighs because they're cheap and delicious) with a teriyaki marinade overnight. Season it up with whatever else you want (sriracha and garlic are mandatory in my house)  Bake chicken  Cook rice or noodles, your preference Throw broccoli in to cook with rice (I usually defrost it and just throw it in to keep it warm and let it get a little soft)  Shred up the chicken into bite size pieces and toss with the rice/broccoli. Add more teriyaki sauce to taste.    I calculated it once and I think it was ~$4-5 for 3 excessively huge servings plus plenty of leftovers."

Butterfly and pound thin a couple of chicken breasts, season w/salt & peppa, put a slice of swiss (or gouda or...whatever) on each, then a few pieces of broccoli. Roll the breasts up around the broccoli cheesiness so that no cheese is visible and secure with a toothpick. Dunk each in an egg wash, then bread crumbs, put them on a cookie sheet and bake 20-30min at 350. Delicioso   Super easy and somehow everyone seems overly impressed by it. I was making my cordon blue rollatini one day when I realized that the proscuitto was a little, erm, old. So I threw some leftover frozen broccoli on instead. I never thought it'd be such a hit...but it totally was!   You can vary the flavors a lot with different herbs in your breadcrumbs. I toast a few pieces of bread, quarter them and toss them in a food processor with salt, pepper, fresh parsley and a little freshly grated nutmeg of all things. It's pretty damned good and soo much cheaper than my cordon blue!"
Cheap_Meals,1xee5y,possibly_a_puppybear,1 point,Sun Feb 9 19:24:36 2014 UTC,"I usually cook up a good amount of white rice and eat that with chicken or whatever.  I make sure I have enough leftovers to refry it and make refried rice!  Scramble some eggs and set aside.  Next, put some oil in the pan and add garlic and onion (green or white, i prefer white since it'll cook down and wont get crunchy).  Add ginger too, if you've got it (buy a fresh root of ginger and it'll stay good for a while... I've heard of people chopping/grating it and freezing it in ziplocs too).  So you've got garlic, onion, (ginger) sizzling in the pan.  Add some more oil and your leftover rice (I think it's better if you use chilled rice as opposed to freshly cooked rice.  It might be a temperature thing?).  Cook this until the rice is hot.  Add some soy sauce at this point if you want a little bit of flavor to the rice (and upcoming veggies).  Lastly: Add some more oil (if needed) and add your broccoli & other frozen veggies (i also add frozen corn & peas too), but i preheat them in the microwave so they're not completely frozen.  Throw the veggies in and let them warm up.  Add in the scrambled eggs from earlier.  Keep on stove until heated, and you're done!  When I am prepping food for the future, I will typically save 2-3 cups of cooked rice for a day or two just to make fried rice.  I'll typically eat this rice all by itself.  Refrigerates well, and is fairly easy to do.  My description might be kind of weird to read through, but search up ""fried rice broccoli"" and you should be able to find something suitable."

Cheap_Meals,1x6k3b,kaylore,14,Thu Feb 6 17:58:02 2014 UTC,"You've started a wiki adventure on my computer.....  I found that migas is basically the formal name of the dish.  It originated in Spain and Portugal.  The Spanish version uses leftover bread instead of tortilla chips.  The Portuguese version uses wheat bread, corn bread, or potatoes.  There's an American Tex-Mex version that is similar to the OP's dish but with cheese, and a Mexico City version that's a garlic soup thickened with bread.  Every version has an crap-ton of variations depending on the local ingredients.    Miguitas has no English page but it's full name is Miguitas Norteñas, it's a dish specific to Mexico where it's also called migas with eggs.  It's also similar to the OP's dish, but does not usually include tomatoes or chilis.  So it sounds like the OP did indeed cook migas (although both miguitas and Tex-Mex migas call for cheese, and there is sadly a lack of it in the pictures)!  Looking at all of the variations of migas, it looks like this can be called migas as well, although miguitas is a real name specific to this preparation.  My first thought was miguitas was just a local diminutive naming of migas, but looks like that's not right.   This dish is similar to a personal favorite, Mexican chilaquiles, which the wiki page even says is often confused with Tex-Mex migas.  It's similar to the OP's dish but with salsa instead of eggs during cooking.  It's usually topped with eggs anyway, or shredded chicken or other meat. Tons of variations.  omnomnom.   All of this is also very similar to matzah brei, an Ashkenazi Jewish dish that uses matza cooked with egg.  It's topped or mixed with all sorts of things, some that make it savory like the above dishes and some you wouldn't expect, like apple sauce, preserves, or syrup to make it sweet.  Makes me think of a matza crepe casserole.  Then there's a gazpacho from Spain that uses torta de gazpacho, which is flat, round bread specifically for the gazpacho.  It's kind of cool because the bread resembles matza while the gazpacho resembles the Mexico City migas, although with a tomato soup instead of a garlic soup.   And now I have a ton of things I want to cook."

Cheap_Meals,1x5wpd,katcat69,14,Thu Feb 6 07:38:20 2014 UTC,"It all depends on your man-friend's taste, but one of my favorite (and relatively cheap) meals is a whole roasted chicken with potatoes. It sound's kind of intimidating, but with a sharp knife and some kitchen shears (totally worth the 5 bucks- super helpful tool in the kitchen), it's pretty easy and will make your house smell absolutely amazing. Throw in a small salad if you want a little bit of green too.  Here's what you'll need:   1 smallish to medium onion $.50 tops 1 3-4lb chicken- I can find these at my market for around a $1/lb, if you can only find larger birds, this recipe will still work but will take a little longer Fresh or dried thyme (fresh is nice, but optional.) Salt (preferably kosher) Pepper 1.5lbs of peeled smallish potatoes. I like yellow or gold potatoes- they're usually 2 bucks a bag. Peeling them is important for them to get crispy and absorb the juices! If you can only find larger potatoes, just make sure that when you cut them into segments that they're about the same size. A few tablespoons of melted butter or olive oil. I prefer butter here. A lemon $.30 tops   Tools:   A sharp knife Kitchen shears or heavy scissors (super helpful) An oven safe roasting pan or skillet- cast iron works great here but you can use anything that can hold the chicken comfortably.    Process:   Preheat your oven to 450. Yes, 450. This is how you're going to get an amazingly crispy skin. Slice your onion into relatively thin half moons; maybe 1/8th of an inch thick and separate the individual  segments. Place them in your roasting container and spread them out so they cover the bottom fairly evenly. Scatter your thyme over the onions. Note: If you have fresh thyme, don't bother taking it off of its branches, just clump it together in the center of the pile; you'll see why in a bit. Pat the chicken dry and lay it breast side down. Using your shears or scissors, cut along the backbone of the chicken and remove it. I would highly suggest putting it in a stock bag for soups later if you're into that kind of thing. This is the most daunting part of the cooking process- the crunching of the bones might freak you out a bit, but you can do it!  Once the spine is out, season the inside of the cavity generously with salt and pepper. Place the chicken breast side up on top of the onion bed (if you're using the fresh thyme, this is why you want the thyme stems centered!) and for good measure, dry the skin again. Season the outside with salt and pepper generously.  Nestle your potatoes around the chicken- things will be snug but it should fit. pour the melted butter over the potatoes only and season them with salt and pepper.  Roast this beautiful pan of things for about 30-40 minutes or until the juices from the thigh is around 165-170 ish. The juices will run clear. Turn your potatoes around a bit around 20 minutes in to the roasting process. What you'll be met with once its done is a pan filled with ambrosia. All of the onions will have melted into the chicken fat and juices and have created this amazing gravy for you to dip everything you serve with it.  Because of the juices at the bottom of the roasting pan, this next part can get a little bit messy, so sorry in advance.  Remove the potatoes from the pan to a separate dish- they should be done, but if they're not you can pop them back in the oven for a few minutes while you carve your bird. The way I carve my chickens is with the utmost brutality. A heavy and sharp knife are super helpful here- I just cut (see:smash) through the various bones at their joints and let people fend for themselves when it comes to picking bones out of their food. Breasts can be cut a little bit nicer though- try and remove the entirety of the breast meat in one go with the skin in tact- makes for great presentation and it can help eliminate waste. Once you've plated everything the way you want it to be plated, I highly recommend juicing half of a lemon over the meat. It cuts through the richness of the chicken fat and takes it to another level. This is a massively delicious meal but it can also be a bit richer than anticipated, so if you're looking for sexytime after the meal, I would highly suggest a simple desert of fruit and some home made meringue cookies (recipes are all over the internet and you can make them earlier in the day!)

Cheap_Meals,1x5wpd,jlking3,4,Thu Feb 6 15:16:20 2014 UTC,"Pasta is romantic isn't it? You could make the pasta fresh, but without a pastamachine there is quite a bit of work required (It's quite possible. Just mix 200 g flour, a pinch of salt and a couple of eggs and knead, and then get it thin. About 3 mm or thinner. Then roll it all up, and cut to desired thickness (6 cm or so is Fettuccine, and that's just perfect). Then it's just 3-4 minutes in boiling water until perfectly done.)   Even if you just buy pasta it's not expensive and there are a lot of easy, cheap and delicious sauces to go with it.  You could do a simple carbonara. All you do is whisk together an egg, a good bit of Parmesan, a small bit of cream (like a couple of tablespoons. This can be skipped, and it's not traditional. I just like it), and a good bit of pepper. Add some good bacon, cut into small cubes. Then after you drain the pasta put it in a bowl together with the sauce and mix it all together. The leftover heat from the pasta will cook the sauce.   Or you can do something with olive oil, seafood and garlic. Here is a recipe by Jamie Oliver, but there are a lot of other versions with mostly the same ingredients.   Ingredients  455g dried spaghetti sea salt & freshly ground black peper extra virgin olive oil 2 cloves of garlic, peeled & finely chopped 1-2 dried red chillies, crumbled 400g peeled raw prawns 1 small wineglass of white wine 2 heaped tablespoons of sun dried tomato puree or 6 sun dried  tomatoes blitzed in a blender zest & juice of 1 lemon 2 handfuls of rocket, roughly chopped     Method  Cook your spaghetti in a large pan of salted boiling water according to packet instructions. Meanwhile, heat 3 good glugs of olive oil in a large frying pan & toss in the garlic & chilli. As the garlic begins to colour, add the prawns & sauté them for a minute. Add the white wine & tomato puree & simmer for a couple of minutes. When the pasta is ready, drain & reserve a little of the cooking water. Toss the spaghetti with the sauce, squeeze in the lemon juice, add half the chopped rocket, adding a little of the reserved water if the sauce needs loosening a bit. Correct the seasoning & serve sprinkled with lemon zest & remaining rocket."

Cheap_Meals,1x41i1,61um1,3,Wed Feb 5 22:10:37 2014 UTC,"Question for me is, is it worth the difference in cost? I know processing and all that but how much of the nutrients are we losing here?"
Cheap_Meals,1x41i1,PetyrBaelish,5,Thu Feb 6 06:26:06 2014 UTC,"I was under the impression that it's not really more nutrients in the steel cut oats, but that they have a lower glycemic index."
Cheap_Meals,1x41i1,Geminii27,2,Thu Feb 6 12:29:08 2014 UTC,"Yup, steel cut oats do have a lower GI and they leave you feeling fuller faster (adding sugar counteracts this effect, though).  However, nutrients are lost when processing steel cut to rolled (see this link)."
Cheap_Meals,1x41i1,reggieyo,2,Thu Feb 6 14:22:08 2014 UTC,"Not much. You're comparing 1/2 cup of each, but a serving size of steel cut oats is 1/4 cup dry. (1/4 c. steel cut oats is 40 g. 1/2 c. is 40 g.) Comparing by weight/serving size seems much more fair to me than comparing by volume. Not to mention you're comparing different brands. Try comparing these Quaker steel cut oats to these Quaker old-fashioned oats. Very little difference in nutrition."

You're going to need a bit more to make it yummy, so buy some carrots, celery, onions, and maybe some bell pepper if it's on sale. You can use that other stuff for some good meals anyway. If you make one huge pot of beans and rice that should do for 2 meals for the 4 of you, so now you need 10 more dinners.   Get a roasting chicken. I can usually find them for about $.99/lb. Have roast chicken with potatoes and carrots for dinner one night. The next night make chicken fried rice. You'll need the a fore mentioned rice, some chicken from the roasting chicken, carrots, onion, maybe some frozen peas, egg and soy sauce. (If the chicken is scarce after the first night and you still want to make soup from the carcass, get some tofu for tofu fried rice. I can usually get a big block of tofu for $1-2 at the local Korean grocery store.)The next night make some chicken soup with the carcass, carrots, onions, and celery. Buy a box of elbow noodles for $.99 and you have chicken noodle soup. 7 more dinners to go.  Pasta and sauce are inexpensive. You can get a box of pasta for $.99, and a jar of sauce for $2. 6 more dinners needed.   Lentils are inexpensive. Make lentil tacos. Here's a recipe. In fact, there are a lot of great recipes on this site that are also cheap... http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/04/lentil-tacos/  Sorry, I wanted to write more, but I'm at work and no one can seam to just do their job, so I gotta go.

Just one note about the pasta sauce - instead of getting the $2 jar, get the $0.75 can of Hunt's tomato sauce. Then you can add tons of celery, onion, and carrot (you'll probably have some leftover from using them in the beans) and you can bulk out the sauce and save a little bit of money. I think the Hunt's tastes fine, just might need a teaspoon or two of added sugar to resemble the jar stuff."

Cheap_Meals,1wx73b,AuntieAndie,19,Tue Feb 4 22:36:27 2014 UTC,"A week or so ago I wrote out a list that almost exactly matches your budget for another redditor. If you have a Winco nearby these prices will be pretty accurate and you can find even lower prices on some items if you take the time to compare the bulk to the prepackaged. It can be less expensive to buy packaged when they are on sale. Always compare the price per ounce. Some items were actually cheaper on my shopping trip this week. I noticed they have dried black beans for $.60 a pound so I bought 5 pounds which will make 5 abundant dishes. But the ham had gone up by $.10 a pound, so I would buy a smaller ham and be more light in the servings.  And some things to look for: For bread type needs you can't beat the price of corn tortillas per serving if you buy the 80 count at $2.76--more versatile than bread.  The breakfast cereal price per ounce that you want to look for is $.13 an ounce or less. Oatmeal is always far below that price point at around $.03 an ounce and once prepared with water (which per batch is something like an additional 1/10 of 1 cent) that drops to around $.0075 per ounce. (And while it is more versatile not everyone in my family can stand it on a regular basis, probably true of most families.)  The original post was for one person for one month, which should translate to 4 people for ten days, more or less. If you need any pointers or have any questions, let me know. I am happy to lend my experience.

Dice or slice the breasts and store in freezer bags in 1/2 cup portions. Chunk the dark meat and store in 1/2 cup portions. Boil the bones and skin in a large pot with lots of water for at least 4 hours (longer makes a richer broth). Should be able to extract 8 quarts of well flavored broth.   The ham stays good because it is smoked. The one I buy is spiral sliced about 3/4th through. Cut off the slices and bag them. Cube and/or dice the un-sliced chunk. You can freeze it just fine as well. You can use the bone right away to flavor your beans and you can put it into the freezer to use up to two more times before it loses its potency. Beans don't freeze great so only make as much of those each time as you can happily eat within four days.   After this initial work you should be able to throw together LOTS of diverse meals all month long.

Cheap_Meals,1wx73b,erasmosis,1 point,Wed Feb 5 04:53:02 2014 UTC,"On a smoked product like ham or ham hocks the flavor is strong for a few uses. You will extract gelatin from the bones so the first time it is a decent amount, the second time tends to be even more and very little by the third use.   You can do this by roasting the chicken bones after removing the meat too but they tend to be just good for two slow simmers at most."

As said above, curtido is a 'lightly fermented' slaw. Really it's just pickled, but that's besides the point. Cabbage is cheap, you should already have carrots and bell peppers; buy a red onion if you can to really make it pop.   Push your dining further with some jackfruit BBQ. You can buy cans of jackfruit for about $1.25 each at most asian grocers and many health food stores. Get the young jackfruit in water--not the jackfruit in syrup.   Open the cans, drain the fluid, and toss 2-3 cans of the fruit into a slow cooker with 1-1.5 bottles of BBQ sauce and maybe some garlic/onion if you have extra. Leave it on low and BOOM--4 hours later, you've got delicious (and almost passable) BBQ--and it's vegan! Add on some of that curtido slaw too."
Cheap_Meals,1wx73b,erasmosis,12,Tue Feb 4 05:39:53 2014 UTC,"Pupusa:      A pupusa (Spanish pronunciation: [puˈpusa], from Pipil pupusaw) is a traditional Salvadoran dish made of a thick, handmade corn tortilla (made using masa de maíz, a maize flour dough used in Latin American cuisine) that is usually filled with a blend of the following:  The two most common pupusas are the pupusa de queso (cheese) and more popular pupusa revuelta with mixed ingredients of cheese, beans, and chicharrón. Pupusas are typically served with curtido (lightly fermented cabbage slaw with red chilies and vinegar) and a watery tomato salsa.  Pupusas are similar to the South American arepa. The main difference is the pupusa is made from nixtamal, whereas arepas are made from ordinary corn dough. Nixtamal is basically the same corn dough, but it has undergone a preparation process involving an alkaline solution before cooking, which contributes to the peeling of the grains, making valuable nutrients available. This process was developed in Mesoamerica around 1500–1200 BCE. Early Mesoamericans used quicklime or slaked lime and ashes as the alkaline solution. Dried nixtamal is now commercially available.

Cheap_Meals,1wx73b,esperanza_,12,Tue Feb 4 06:06:36 2014 UTC,"When things get tight, we stretch a chicken, there's a good guide here. Soup goes a long way, and if you already have flour on hand, no-knead bread really helps to finish off those meals nicely.   My daughter loves having breakfast for dinner, so pancakes with a banana on the side are a huge hit around here and super cheap if you keep the ingredients on hand.   Sites like BudgetBytes have given us great inspiration to cook down what we have in the panty. Off the top of my head, the Italian Wonderpot went over really well with my family and has adapted to different ingredients really well (I've used spinach, chard and kale in it, fresh and frozen and have skipped the feta and done parm or whatever we had on hand instead).  This naan recipe has also gone over well when I've made lentils for the family and can easily be stretched to use for two meals.   Good luck, it seems like an uphill task but if you spend it carefully, $75 can be stretched pretty reasonable. Take your time to read the ads and plan your shopping trip. Try to reserve $10-20 of that budget for next week for fresh produce/milk. If you have ethnic markets in your area, this might be the time to check them out. Also, if you have a super-Walmart in your area you can price match there and take advantage of the sales from multiple stores. The 99 cent only store in my area also has a really impressive grocery section.  My personal list would include carrots, celery, onions, about $10 in misc produce (bananas, apples, lettuce, whatever), frozen spinach, a bag of lentils, a bag of another bean that you don't have, rice (if you're low), maybe a box or two of pasta, pasta sauce, milk, butter, eggs, a raw whole chicken or a rotisserie if they're cheap in your area. By my estimates you should have about $20 left over, which, as I said above, I would save for next week and see what you need next week. We would have breakfast for dinner  (x2), spaghetti w a small salad (make croutons w leftover no-knead bread even, you could budget from the leftover $20 to add meat to this meal if you want), soup made from the chicken (x2), Italian Wonderpot (add beans to bulk it up), chicken and spinach alfredo, lentils with naan, black bean taco salad, baked potatoes topped with leftover chicken (if you have it, or budget from leftover $20 for a cheap steak or bacon), chana saag, lentil stew/soup, homemade ramen (full of veggies and an egg for protein) and one night of leftovers.   For lunches, I, personally would stick to PB&J on homemade bread, fruit, leftovers and side salads. Just an aside, I also make greek yogurt every week and it makes for a great snack/meal filler (and can be used in the naan). I usually eat it w a spoonful of jam or a drizzle of honey, super good! For snacks, oatmeal and peanut butter cookies always win over my family. I know what works for my family doesn't necessarily work for another person's family, but hope it helps a little bit. If you have it in your budget (or if you have the ingredients around the house), quesadillas or a homemade pizza are also a great way to change things up, but I know how fast cheese adds up (for the record, my family loved this quesadilla recipe, even my 'every dinner must have meat' boyfriend).  Good luck!"

Cheap_Meals,1wx73b,Jebusman89,2,Tue Feb 4 00:45:19 2014 UTC,"Haha aww, don't be afraid of cooking, it's easier than it looks. The no-knead bread is honestly the easiest way to start, just follow the directions step-by-step. The first time I made it I didn't have a dutch oven like the recipe called for, so I just used an oven safe (metal handle) pot in the oven and it worked just fine. As far as sandwich bread goes, I can see where the kneading and everything can be daunting, I would just use the no-knead bread tbh or I've seen this tutorial for turning that recipe into a traditional sandwich loaf, but I honestly haven't done it. Come on over to /r/breadit, it's a great community and they're always happy to give advice.   If you're feeling really daring, we made this bagel recipe last week for about $1 for a dozen and they came out better than store bought (that blog is also full of great budget meal ideas too)."

Get different types of root vegetables (carrots, celery, potatoes), dice and cook them with some canned tomatoes and a few italian style herbs (thyme, rosemary), add salt and black pepper (olive oil if you have - this is kinda expensive, but it'll do without) and serve it with a fried chicken drumstick. Very healthy and tasty, yet very cheap."

I also really enjoy this Mexican rice dish although I omit the jalapenos.  It makes a huge pot and I love to eat leftovers with black beans for lunch.  Really filling and tasty.   Another meal I love to make, that makes a lot, is Greek orzo salad.  It's just something I've kind of thrown together, so I don't have a real recipe, but I use 1 lb box of orzo (cooked), 1 English cucumber, some cherry or grape tomatoes, feta cheese and olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Season with some salt and oregano or thyme, whatever your taste buds like.  It makes a ton and it's another thing my husband loves for snacks. Cook some chicken with it and you can use it as a dinner meal.  Chili is a huge favorite in my house, and pretty damn cheap.  The most expensive part will be the meat, but I just use ground beef, two cans of beans, a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and seasonings.    I've used this recipe of tomato soup and instead of putting cream in it I used it as a pasta sauce.  It's really flavorful and makes a ton of sauce.  If you're up for it, homemade pasta is super simple and just takes flour and an egg.  Between the two it would probably be enough for dinner, plus lunches the next day.  Homemade pizza is also something that's not too hard and relatively inexpensive.   I realize most of these dishes will be dependent on meat prices and what you can get, but they're a starting point and something different than all the lentil and potato recipes I always see. I'm a huge proponent of making different things often and switching up my meal plan so if you want some more help or you get some groceries and want ideas of what to make just PM me!"

Cheap_Meals,1wx73b,RedAngel728,2,Tue Feb 4 01:51:29 2014 UTC,"Buying it cooked would be fine and you could use the rest for chicken salad or something. I myself just boil two chicken breasts in water for 20 minutes the night before. Then when I go to make the taquitos I just shred them with two forks. I'm not sure where you're from but here in NC Harris Teeter always has $1.99/lb chicken breasts when you use your customer rewards card. I know meat prices vary by location, but for me it's cheaper to buy the chicken breasts than it is precooked chicken.    Oh, and it only use flour. My husband and I don't like the taste of corn. The only difference is than instead of soaking the tortilla in chicken stock I just brush it on both sides sparingly. This gives it just enough moisture to not soak through but be workable."

(money was incredibly short due to unforeseen circumstances)   It was a lot less of a struggle than I expected and we did not have to eat the same food daily.   We got all our meat on sale, big packages of chicken and ground beef that I portioned up into freezer bags. I made lots of pasta and rice dishes -- a few bucks worth of hamburger, turkey, or shredded chicken + pasta/rice + veggies + sauce = full meal. You can go almost any direction you want: chicken fettuccine Alfredo with mixed veggies, beef and broccoli or stir fry, bbq, stroganoff, Mexican casserole, etc. Canned/frozen veggies are ready and cheap.   Snacks for the kids were easy -- portions of fruit, peanut butter, crackers, jello, noodles, occasionally I bought a cheap brownie mix.   The main way I saved money and made it work was policing the kitchen and being careful with portion size. No one went hungry, but I reduced food waste tremendously."

From there, you can supplement other foods. Think basics that can a lot of things. If you have an Aldi near you, go there for basics like noodles, spaghetti sauce, bread, eggs, milk. There are so many things that can be made cheaply. One thing my family loves is....boil noodles. In a pan, melt a little butter and oil, add garlic, salt and pepper. Mix in hot noodles. Break a few eggs and stir until eggs are cooked. Add parmesan cheese if you have it. So good. One day make spaghetti. Make 2 lbs. and 2 jars of sauce and you will have leftovers for the next day for lunches and dinner. Leftover spaghetti is delicious baked with a little bit of cheese on top. If you have leftover sauce, top bagels with it, add cheese and you have bagel pizzas."

It may not be an every day thing, but if you want to please your kids for a day or so, use that cheese man! Cheese Ramen is still my go-to comfort food from when I was a kid, and inexpensive as hell. Oddly enough, a lot of sodium, but good carbs/ fats/ proteins in cheese Ramen so... not the worst idea I dont think."

Stores like Whole Foods obviously charge more for the same foods, but even a big store like Target or Safeway will charge more than a lot of lower-end grocery stores like C-Town or Gristedes if you've ever been in NYC. Use boullion powder instead of canned stock for stews and soups - won't taste as good and has a ton of salt but lets you reuse chicken bones and scraps into a chicken soup.  If you have a crockpot tough pork cuts will also be cheap to make a stew from. Frozen veggies are also cheap. And don't be afraid of coupons.

When grocery store has a 2 for $5 for 8 oz. of sharp cheddar, I buy a couple.  I cube up or shred an an entire 8 oz package for the box of mac and cheese.  If you have an oven and casserole dish, follow the instructions, but undercook the macaroni a little.  Pour into a casserole dish, top with more shredded cheese and bake it until you get a nice golden cheese crust on top. As an alternative to sprinkling the cheese over the casserole mac and cheese, sprinkled bread crumbs and bake.  You get that really awesome crunchy texture with each bite. Use some non-traditional cheeses to add to the box.  I like sprinkling feta or some blue cheese crumbles."

And, as I said in another post, sodium is not as much of an issue for me, so I didn't even think about that. I'm sure you could substitute in a low sodium version. I know they have them. For me, my priority is getting veggies (because veggies) and red meat (I've got low iron)."
Cheap_Meals,1wcans,iamacarboncarbonbond,1 point,Wed Jan 29 02:09:44 2014 UTC,"Ah ok - yeah, generic is cheaper.  My qualm is just for people with normal, higher sodium levels.  V8/generic can be very high in sodium and, imo, low in taste.  Making it yourself with tomato chunks means you can tailor it to your taste buds and stay considerably well within your budget.  I will always have cumin, salt and pepper, sumac, bay leaves, garlic, etc in my pantry - no need to go out for extra ""unitaskers"", as Alton Brown would say.    And if you're worried about diced tomato, it isn't stew or chili-like, believe me!  With heat the tomatoes lose their texture and form.  If anything, having potatoes, meat, or anything else would make the stew thicker.  But if that's an issue, go with a 16-oz can of tomato puree, which will become a little thinned with the addition of broth but will have a similar consistency to your V8.  It will make it consistently tomatoey without the addition of chunks."
Cheap_Meals,1wcans,randomnessish,1 point,Wed Jan 29 02:40:45 2014 UTC,"I'll agree with you about the taste. But I kinda like that it's a more bland flavor, so that I can add onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, and paprika to my own taste.

Cheap_Meals,1wcans,iamacarboncarbonbond,1 point,Wed Jan 29 03:12:34 2014 UTC,"No sodium broth.  And bouillon cubes already have far less sodium than V8...you also can adjust by not adding any salt, or adding less.  You should pick up Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything, he has a really great section on soups - he teaches you the basics of how to ""build"" them from the broth up.

I drizzle on olive oil, Italian seasoning and garlic and roast in the oven 15 minutes at 350.  While it's roasting, I take the juice and add it to 4 cups chicken broth (I make my own by slow cooking a chicken but you can buy some), then bring that to a simmer.  take the tomatoes out of the oven and dump into the broth and blend it up to the texture you like!  Out of that, you end up with a great tomato soup, a whole cooked chicken, and then you can upgrade the tomato soup into vegetable soup if you please.  Total cost: Tomatoes: ~3.00 total Red pepper: ~1.00 Frozen veg: ~1.00 Spinach:~2.00 Chicken:~4.00 Beef: ~3.00  ~14.00 will yield at least 6 meals of soup (served with bread) and at least 4 meals of chicken.

Throw that in!!  Whatever is yummy!  -carbs carbs carbs carbs ALL THE CARBS: you got rice?  Yay!  No rice?  Throw in some pasta (you're poor, of course you have pasta).    -Protein is good.  Personally I'm a fan of lentils and chickpeas.  You can never go wrong.  -potatoes.  Potatoes for bulk, potatoes for tastiness, potatoes for some much-needed sustenance in your life.  Throw in a potato if you have a potato.  Dice it first, into whatever size you want but try to keep the dice the same size as your other veggies.  Also: it releases natural starches as it cooks in the broth, making your soup rich and creamy.  -SPICES.  Spices seriously make everything so much better! I use cumin, sumac, a bay leaf, coriander, curry powder...whatever is on hand.  They are they key to making your bland poor-person food taste amazing.  -Optional: heavy cream  First, I like to saute some garlic over low heat until fragrant (and brown any red meats/sausages at this stage).  At this stage, make a paste with the oil by stirring in your powdered spices - this cooks them a little (low heat!!!) and releases their flavor.  Then I dump in the broth (or, in my case, water and buillon/knorr cubes) and let it come to a boil.  When it's boiling, I lower the heat to a simmer and plop in any veggies and meat that aren't cooked.  Same with the pasta and rice (REMEMBER: add in an extra cup of water for pasta and rice, because they're going to absorb some of your broth and you want to stretch this sucker til payday).  If you want to, stir in your heavy cream for some extra oomf, you fatty.  Let bubble until everything that is cooked, is cooked.  If you have spinach or other greens, or frozen veggies, stir in last minute.    Eat, and think about your life choices.  I survived on $700 a month this way in an expensive European city.

First you make Roasted Carrots with Thyme (this can be used as a side dish too) 2lbs carrots, peeled and trimmed 3 Tbsp EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) 1/2 tsp dried thyme salt pepper  Preheat the oven to 400. Cut the carrots in half and then halve them lenthwise. In a large mixing bowl, toss the carrots with olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a 9x13 rimmed baking sheet (I also use a casserole dish and it works just fine) and roast until the carrots begin to brown, 45-50 minutes, flipping the carrots midway through the cooking time.  To continue to the Ginger Carrot Soup: 3 Tbsp EVOO 1 medium leek, white and light green parts only, coarsely chopped (I used one green onion finely chopped and it's also delish!) 1 Tbsp freshly grated ginger 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional if you like it hot or not) 2 lbs Roasted Carrots with Thyme 4 c veggie broth zest and juice of 1 lime salt pepper  Heat EVOO in large pot over medium heat. Add the leek (or green onion) and saute until softened, about 3-5 minutes. Add the ginger and crushed red pepper flakes, stirring to combine. Cook for one minute to meld the flavors. Add the carrots and broth, and bring the pot to a simmer over medium heat, 8-10 minutes. Cover the pot and simmer gently for 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool to lukewarm to avoid a hot liquid pureeing disaster! Puree it in small batches in a blender or food processor until smooth.

There is a risk of making it bitter with roasting or frying the chicken bones if all of the chicken meat is not completely removed (same goes for turkey). If the cooked chicken is roasted or fried until it is quite dry it can become bitter but if that happens, the answer is to actually fry it longer, until it is well browned and stringy, and the bitterness will be replaced with a strong roasted chicken flavor. :)"

Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,dewprisms,5,Sat Jan 25 01:20:23 2014 UTC,"You could try planning your meals a little better. It's a waste of money buying the lunch meat if it goes bad before you use it all. You could always freeze some of it, maybe even dice it up so you can put it into a rice or pasta dish for a little something extra when you're low on other things. It's one of the reasons that frozen vegetables are preferable to me - they won't go bad before I use them up so they're better value for money.   When our money was low, we'd buy sausages (cheapest meat where I live) but other than that - eat a lot of vegetable dishes. Canned beans and tomato is something I buy every week because they're cheap ways of bulking out recipes. We used to shop in the hour before closing time and there would often be marked down salads, meat & dairy during that time.   You could try powdered milk, or long life milk as well (or make a creamy soup?)"
Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,graphictruth,1 point,Fri Jan 24 06:11:42 2014 UTC,"I learned to be smarter about my lunch meat- I go to the deli counter and only order enough for 1 or 2 sandwiches so it won't go to waste. I need to buy more frequently, but if you're smart about what you buy, the price is usually the same or at least very close to the prepackaged prices."

Personally like all three, but if you have to pick just one case in a case lot sale, I usually go for the mushroom - it's the most versatile.  The simplest thing you can do with it:  Block of ramen noodles, (per person) crushed in the bag with a frying pan. Cover the bottom of the pan with about half an inch of water, toss in the crushed noodles and the flavor packets (to taste). When the noodles are soft, add up to one tablespoon condensed soup per serving, turn heat to low and stir rapidly. Turn into bowls and serve. Starchy naturally and artificially flavoured goodness.  Goes well with home-made biscuits."

Our local discount grocery store usually has 12-packs of Johnsonville Mild Italian sausages, cheap, so I generally buy a pack of those and turn them into either really thick & meaty spaghetti sauce, or the most delicious alfredo I've managed to come up with yet.  If you bulk out your meat & pasta with vegetables-- for example, to my alfredo I add broccoli, maybe some mushrooms; to tuna casserole, frozen peas-- it'll go way farther than if you don't. This is how we manage to eat the food we like in our house without going broke. We bulk everything out with as many inexpensive veggies as we can. Living in a farming community does make this easier. Also, I make creative, chunky sauces out of anything I can, and we eat those on pasta for as long as they last.  Oh, and lots of potatoes. They're versatile, filling, and they keep forever if you do it right."
Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,kittieslovelettuce,2,Fri Jan 24 17:41:59 2014 UTC,How do you keep your potatoes fresh? I have issues with this.
Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,curvy_lady_92,4,Fri Jan 24 18:51:42 2014 UTC,"I have a corner pantry, so I just put them on the bottom level (aka the floor) and keep the door closed so the cat doesn't get all up in my taters. It needs to be dim/dark and cool. Think about root cellars-- the closer you can get to those conditions, the better. Don't refrigerate, though. Also, you want them to be slightly ventilated, so a bag with holes in it (like most 5 or 10 lb. bags of potatoes tend to be) is preferable.  My sainted grandmother kept her potatoes in a heavy ceramic open-topped jar under the laundry sink. The material held a good chill and kept the potatoes nice and fresh. If I could duplicate those conditions in my home, you can bet I would. (If I could keep house half as well as that woman did, I would be so happy.) The idea is to minimize the light and heat they're exposed to."
Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,curvy_lady_92,2,Fri Jan 24 19:38:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I try keeping them in our pantry, but it must be the only warm part of our kitchen. They will go in the garage next time I get a bunch on sale."

Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,darknessvisible,5,Sun Jan 26 23:37:08 2014 UTC,"Potatoes are under-utilized in this thread!  If I'm down on my dollars, potatoes are on my big go-to stock up. I can pick up a 10 lb bag of potatoes for like, five dollars. You can bake, broil, mash, fry, or even make a soup out of them.  That being said, I recommend:   Butter- it will get you a long way for cooking, it enhances almost every food, and it even makes ramen noodles taste better. Bread- like you said, a loaf of cheap bread hardly goes bad. Sandwiches, toast, cheap garlic bread- all possibilities with some good ole white bread. Pasta- get the cheapest you can find (my store sells them at about a dollar a box on sale). Get different kinds! Even if all you eat is spaghetti, it will make you feel a little fancier and doesn't cost a whole lot. Butter also plays in here again- you can fry up noodles with butter, garlic, salt and pepper and it's a great quick meal/snack and is super cheap. (You can also do this if you made too much pasta the night before.) Potatoes- bake em, broil em, mash em, put em in a stew.. My favorite is fried potatoes and onions. With that in mind... Oil of some kind. Crisco works great, is a little more expensive, but you don't have to buy it often. Cheaper oil works alright. Eggs- I recommend the dozen and a half. Tomato sauce- stock up on some cheap tomato sauce! You can use it in a lot of things, and it is fairly cheap. Even if the sauce isn't that great, using some spices you already have can make it feel better. A bag of yellow onions- they tend to be cheaper and keep for a good while. They're sweeter than white onions and only cost 2-4 dollars. Milk- this is a little more expensive, but can be worth it. Buy a gallon, they're about 4 dollars, and you can make a ton of things with it, plus box dinners usually call for it (my guilty pleasure is tuna helper). French toast, fried meats, cereal; all of them require milk. Boneless, skinless chicken breast (the frozen bag)- this will run about 8 dollars, but you can use them for a whole lot of things. Thaw them out, put some tomato sauce (and a little parmesan), bake them at 350 for about 40 minutes, toast some bread, butter it and put some garlic on it and you have a meal!   These are ideas that have developed over time living as a poor college student, and before that, just a poor person (with less debt..). If you need ideas for meals, cheap ingredients, or otherwise, ask away!  BONUS: If you can spare a dollar, buy fresh garlic. It's really inexpensive and adds a depth of flavor to just about any dish."

Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,gothamguy212,3,Fri Jan 24 21:13:15 2014 UTC,"Well my friend, here is a fancy tip for you. If you buy the things I said (which you should), saute some garlic, a small onion, add tomato sauce and spices (I grow my own basil so I don't have to buy fresh), add them in, simmer till done.  Now that you have a ramped up tomato sauce- use it for spaghetti, chicken parmesan, manicotti (if you have the money for it- sub out cottage cheese for ricotta, works just fine), etc.  Tastes a LOT better than just the store-bought-canned-sadness that is canned tomato sauce."

Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,exzeroex,2,Fri Jan 24 21:32:21 2014 UTC,"One more tip: if you make fried potatoes, keep the heat on about medium and don't touch them. If you continually move them, they won't crisp up! (They make fantastic sandwiches, by the way!)"
Cheap_Meals,1vz4fh,FiyaFly,3,Fri Jan 24 21:38:32 2014 UTC,"If you have a local butcher (and freezer space), ask them if they sell chicken or turkey carcasses (whatever's left when they've taken off the breast, legs and thighs).  I got 5kg for £5 (UK) and they lasted for ages.  Basically I just kept the crock pot on low all the time (costs £1.50 a week), put in a carcass, two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, bay leaves, and a stock cube to get things going and enough water to cover everything.  Then when the carcass had been in there for a few hours, I'd take it out, strip off all the usable meat (of which there was loads on every carcass), put the bones and cartilage back into the crockpot and put the skin out in the back garden for the birds etc.  The carcasses do release a ton of fat from the skin, so you have to keep skimming that off from time to time and put it in a container in the fridge or freezer to use later instead of oil.  But basically you can either drink the bone broth as it is, or use it whenever you need chicken stock.  Keep topping it up with the same amount of water as stock you took out, and throw in another carcass every day and repeat the process.    The other useful staples to look into are bulk boxes of ramen noodles and 10kg bags of basmati rice from amazon - it's usually free delivery and generally cheaper even than the Asian supermarkets."

Cheap_Meals,1vyabz,sexybot,5,Fri Jan 24 00:50:35 2014 UTC,What everyone else said but I'd like to add that when you thaw solid cheese the moisture seems to come to the surface faster in storage. I don't know what the solution is but it causes it to spoil faster. With the shredded cheese it is great straight from the freezer because the starch they use to keep it separate keeps working in the freezer but if you thaw it the shreds become a sticky mass.

Check DAV Thrift Store and other similar thrift stores for good deal.  Check the stores close to higher-income areas, because you can sometimes find higher-end or nicer things.    One time I move to temporarily moved to another city and didn't bring any furniture with me.

Cheap_Meals,1vn26e,voiderest,1 point,Tue Jan 21 00:17:44 2014 UTC,"I like recipes that don't require a lot of ""active time"" - stuff that you just throw together and don't think about it again until it's time to eat.  For example, it takes about 15 minutes to throw split peas, chopped onions, celery, carrots, and potatoes in a slow cooker with some vegetable broth and spices. It cooks all day while you're at work or school, and you come home to delicious (and cheap) soup. Most slow cooker recipes are like this, I avoid anything that requires me to brown or saute before adding to the slow cooker. Ain't nobody got time for that.

Keep in mind that this is definitely comfort, cold weather type food.   The cheapest way to do it is buy in bulk and use a little at a time, but I don't know if you have a full sized fridge/freezer, so I'll provide both.   Ham (like you buy for Chirstmas), cooked and prepared, cut into strips. Or the deli equivalent. (chipped ham, chunked ham, etc) Beans. You can buy them dry and they'll keep forever. Soak overnight in a bowl, rinse and cook. (Or you can buy them in a can). I like Great Northern beans, but pretty much any will do. Garlic, alot of garlic. I buy garlic in a jar. Which a lot of people frown upon, but saves me time. I buy the big jar so I don't run out for months or even a year Frozen spinach. If you buy the big 32oz package you won't run out for a while. Or you can buy the 10z Birds eye to fit in a college fridge/freezer.    Put a little bit of water in with the spinach and steam in the microwave or in a pot on the stove (covered)... follow pkg instructions  Combine the rest of the ingredients. Microwave or heat on stove. The ham is already cooked so you don't have to worry about heating it to safety levels. And it's super salty, so you don't have to add salt to your mixture either.  Enjoy!  I made this a couple weeks ago for the first time to try and get rid of leftover Christmas Ham. OMG, it's so delicious. The perfect lunch food. Tasty, warm, comforting. High in protein and iron, it will fill you up too."

Cheap_Meals,1vn26e,Zyphamon,2,Mon Jan 20 23:09:10 2014 UTC,"Wraps are a good direction to head in if you don't have access to a means of cooking like a microwave, stovetop or oven. I had mostly wraps for lunch back when I was in college about a decade ago, and the variability of what you can put in wraps kept it more than a little interesting, while the wrap design made it convenient for eating on the go. The wraps themselves were usually smaller flour tortillas, but I'd opt for the spinach wraps when I could as they had more nutrients and flavor.   IIRC, I grouped my wrap recipes into meats, vegetables, and other.   For meats, I'd usually combine something like cold cuts or pieces of chicken, pork, beef, or turkey with cheap bagged salad mix (which I cleaned and kept in a salad spinner in a small dorm and later apartment fridge), mustard, and maybe some cheese. This alone provides a great deal of variability. One day I'd have leftover steak strips with three hearts salad mix (Romaine, green leaf, and butter lettuce hearts), a little cheddar, and some mustard. The tortilla gave me quick energy, the steak filled me up and gave me protein, the salad provided fiber and a whole host of nutrients, and the mustard was delicious because mustard is delicious. The next time, I might have chicken with Jack cheese and Dijon or turkey with sliced apple or ham and swiss.   For vegetables, it would basically be a garden salad in a wrap. I might have salad mix with a little chopped red onion, pepperocncini, tomato, black olives, and dressing. The next time I might have corn, green onions, and black beans with the salad mix. The idea is to give yourself something chock full of vegetables, but to let the salad mix to make up the bulk of it to save money on the better ingredients. If you're careful, you can have things like asparagus, broccoli, squash, green onions, avocado, bell pepper, and other more expensive produce without breaking the bank.   For other, I'd take something people normally don't eat in wraps and jam it in there, like chili, tuna/chicken salad, hummus, etc. This took a bit of experimenting, as some things don't work in wraps (like stew or ice cream), but can result in a wider variety of foods.   I'd alternate between these three things, so every three days I'd have a meat wrap, separated by a day of a vegetable wrap and an other wrap, which kept things from getting boring. I'd buy in bulk after planning out all my meals so I could keep costs down and never wonder what I was going to eat. And I only ate wraps I loved, so I'd always look forward to eating them and, more importantly, would stay motivated to prepare them."

Pour some pasta in a bowl, cover with water, and nuke it for about 10-12 minutes (you'll have to figure out the exact time for your microwave by feel).  Covering with saran wrap is helpful - keeps your water from boiling off.  You'll need to stop it a few times in the middle to keep it from boiling over and making a mess.  Drain, and mix with some sauce.  I just kept a jar of whatever was cheap in the fridge and poured it in cold.  The heat from the pasta was enough to bring it up to a comfortable eating temperature.

Sweet potatoes (not ""quick"" per se, but versatile).  Oh and broccoli lasts awhile, tofu for some other needs, whip up a sitr-fry once every 3 days and bam you're sort of satisfied with life. Fresh fruit, bananas, apples, whole pineapples when they are on sale, berries ONLY if they are on sale, even then they are fucking expensive for waht you get and they rot in a couple days if you forget about them. Better off buying frozen fruit bags WHEN THEY ARE ON SALE, buy like 6 of those suckers when they go half price every 3-4 months. Pay close attention to $/weight with each bag, usually all bransd will go on sale at the same time and the companies are super scummy with their bag weights to prices, don't count out the ""store"" brand, but it ISN'T always the best deal.  Canned vegetables when they go on sale, can be microwaved easily, peas, corn, beans, baby corn, beets, tomatoes.  Boiled eggs, or if you get one of those plastic egg poacher microwave things, put in 2 eggs, 2 tsp of water and 1.5 mins and bam insta poached eggs without loss of white.  I know you need more amino acids if you are sticking straight vegetarian but that's outside what I know.  Peanut butter, most other nut butters are quite frankly a rip-off price-wise regardless of benefits.   Any pastas when they go on sale are cheap as shit, and you can buy sauces super cheap when it goes on sale. Don't get into the insta-ramen spiral, it may be SLIGHTLY cheaper, but there is a metric fuck-ton of salt. (guilty pleasure still...)  As for recipe ideas, I used allthecooks, and Bigoven apps most often, but quite frankly there's tons of vegetarian/vegan websites and apps that are available. Just punch in a couple ingredients and voila.  PRE PLAN YOUR FUCKING MEALS, you can have chunks of certain meals made ahead of time so you only have to cook every third day or so. You save money (by reducing waste) and save time. And when it comes to ""fresh"" ingredients, especially greens, buying less is usually more since you probably won't finish them before they rot. So don't buy 3 heads of lettuce or kale or some shit just because it's on sale. Unless you like those things at EVERY meal for 3 days.  Last couple ranting things: -Make a damn list -Mostly stick to the damn list -Don't fucking shop if you're starving, shove a piece of bread or something in your mouth before you go or you will come back with a cart full of garbage. -Spend as much as you can afford on food, it's pretty much the basis of your health and happiness, appreciate your fucking body and spend a bit less at the bar and a bit more at the grocery store.  Oh and Nutella isn't fucking food, it's not real, it's fucking sugar and bullshit with 6 hazelnuts tossed in and a waste of money.  /rant, good luck!  NINJA EDIT: Other things  And get some fucking spices, and a couple staple sauces like soy sauce. Don't buy a shit-ton all at once, but as needed, there's plenty of guides to ""basic spice pantry"" that will get you started. Shit's expensive yo, so if you really don't like a particular spice then don't even bother. But even pre-ground will be good to go for a year or so. Normally I'd reccommend whole spices but having a communal kitchen doesn't lend itself well to spice storage. At the very least you could always brown your spices a moment before use, making the usually boring pre-ground spices back into their former selves.  Good luck again!"

Remember that the stem can be eaten too!  Edit: a general good saving tip when it comes to food is to plan and buy for about a week at a time. plan food that can use the leftovers from the day before (dish calls for ½ a kilo of carrots, but the least you could buy was 1 kilo? make something with carrots the day after!). this way you will use all of the food, and wont have to throw anything out. it makes the individual shopping trips more expensive but in the long run it's cheaper."

Cheap_Meals,1ve94o,CultureofInsanity,7,Fri Jan 17 08:44:05 2014 UTC,"I'm glad you asked! I'm a Pharmacology/Toxicology student and this is basically what my major is about. Prepare to learn about the liver, ShitOnYourMom.  To build on CultureofInsanity's comment, the liver a detoxification organ. There are proteins called Cytochrome P450 enzymes in high concentration there that interact with substances you take in. Some of these substances are deactivated to a form that's easier to get out of the body, others are activated to a more potent or reactive form. Really, the enzymes are just looking for a chemical group they recognize on what's coming through the liver and changing it. (Because things can also get activated, detoxification is not always the right word to use biotransformation accurately describes what the liver's P450 enzymes do for you.)  There are also different zones to the liver. Each one gets a different amount of blood flow and has different amounts of the P450 enzymes. So depending on the flow of the zone and what substances you take into your body (through food, inhalation, absorption through the skin), some nasty things could accumulate in there.  And all livers have the same function. Across different species, some of the specific types of P450 enzymes change. Some are the same as human P450 enzymes, too. That's one of the (several) reasons why, in clinical trials, a drug might cure a disease in mice or rats but be ineffective in humans - or why a chemical may be especially dangerous to some animals, but not others."

Cheap_Meals,1ve94o,CatullusSixteen,2,Fri Jan 17 10:19:19 2014 UTC,"""Filter"" isn't really an accurate term. Livers metabolize things. When you drink alcohol, the liver doesn't ""filter"" out the alcohol and just store it there. It metabolizes it into Acetaldehyde (which is actually more toxic than alcohol) and then into acetic acid. It doesn't just filter out the alcohol and store it in your liver, nor does it really do this for other ""toxins"". I'm sure some toxins wind up there eventually, but they also wind up in your muscles and fat and everywhere else.   As far as I know the biggest danger with eating liver is an overdose of vitamin A."

Or, depending on how much oil is in the pan, I sometimes just push all the meat to one side and tip up the pan so the oil runs away from the meat, and then just scoop out the oil with a spoon.  IMO, you never want to get rid of all the natural juices that come from cooked meats.  That's where a lot of the flavor is, and they also act as good binders for other ingredients like spices or starches."
Cheap_Meals,1vdqrq,hawps,3,Fri Jan 17 01:08:22 2014 UTC,"Honestly, it probably SEEMS more oily than it is because it has cooled and the grease gets that opaquish look and appears just generally unappetizing.  Once heated, you could either drain it or let it rest on a few paper towels very briefly, but I imagine that once it's heated it won't seem so oily.  Also, regarding heating: if you're set on microwaving or don't have any other options, then make it so.  Otherwise, I think you'd do much better to re-heat the meat in a skillet with just a couple tablespoons of water in the bottom just to distribute the heat initially.  The beans would do fine in the microwave, but to prevent uneven cooking I like the low-and-slow method.  Low power (50-70%) and short cooking cycles (30-45 seconds each), stirring in between.  Having said all that, I say: BURRITOS."
Cheap_Meals,1vdqrq,redbull188,2,Thu Jan 16 21:59:39 2014 UTC,"I would refry the beans - mash them or puree them in your blender with some onion, garlic and water, then fry them in a pan until the water has all cooked off and the beans pull away from the pan easily. Then give your oily beef a rinse in the colander to assist with the oiliness, toss it in the pan by itself, season with cumin, oregano, paprika, salt and pepper and cook until all the water cooks off again. Now you can enjoy some beef and bean tortillas - just add tortilla shells and optional salsa and/or cheese."
Cheap_Meals,1vdqrq,csartgirl14,2,Thu Jan 16 21:03:42 2014 UTC,Stuffed peppers are always good.  You would need a few other ingredients (maybe rice and diced tomatoes) but if you don't ever make that it'll give you some variety.

This is good because it allows you to use milk which is less expensive than heavy cream.)  Melt the butter in a pot big enough to hold all of the ingredients  Add the onions, cook until softened and translucent  Sprinkle the flour over the onions and stir (you've just made a roux!)  Turn the burner up to medium or medium - high heat  Add the salt, and sugar. Slowly add the milk into the pot, heat (but don't boil!) until slightly thickened.  Stir in the tomatoes.

If it's too much, you can take off nearly any of these ingredients and stick to just beans, sauce, and spice. If you're looking for extras, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and crackers are awesome with this.  The best thing is you can freeze the chili and eat it later.

Cheap_Meals,1uyoon,windershinwishes,1 point,Sun Jan 12 01:34:00 2014 UTC,"This is crazy delicious and cheap and I lived on it while I was in college: Buy a big can of V8 juice, a giant bag of frozen mixed veggies (the peas, corn and carrots blend, but really, anything works), two or three potatoes and a no salt herbal blend (the V8 already has a lot of salt in it) and if you're feeling flush, a round steak (this is an actual cut of meat) or a chuck roast (cheaper than the round steak). Dump the V8 in, then fill the can up again with water and dump that in, chop up the potatoes into bite size pieces. Slice up the meat if you've got it and toss that in, along with the herbal blend (I always used Mrs. Dash or sometimes Lipton vegetable soup mix dry envelopes, but they've since come out with other flavors. Obviously if you have a good herb and spice collection, use your own judgement but Mrs. Dash was a lot cheaper than trying to buy all those herbs separately). If you've got meat, cut it into bite-sized chunks and throw it in too. You can let that hang out on low for up to 12 hours on low, but it will be ready to eat in 6-8. About a half hour before you're ready to dig in, toss the frozen veggies in there. You could throw them in early, but they tend to turn to mush after a 10 hour hot tub soak, and that keeps them bright. This entire thing makes an enormous amount of food, is fairly healthy and probably costs about 20 cents a serving if you're doing the vegetarian version, maybe 50 cents a serving with meat."

Canned beans are easier, but dried are cheaper (not that canned beans are terribly expensive to begin with, but I've been a college student, I know that sometimes a few cents matters.)  Eggs really are a good idea, a bag of Doritos is much less/worse nutrition than a dozen eggs from the supermarket, for about the same price.

I was the Sous Chef at a place that did breakfast for about a year and a half, and learned that if you want fluffy, beat the ever-loving-shit out of them to incorporate air, and then cook them quickly (read this both ways, cook them shortly after whipping, and cook them at high heat in a large vessel for minimum cook time).  Normally spent about 30 seconds with a fork to mix up two eggs to about 1.3-1.5x their pre-whip volume, and they'd double or triple in the pan."

Cheap_Meals,1ulcf1,Thrifftee,2,Tue Jan 7 02:52:58 2014 UTC,"Haha Your boyfriend sounds like mine; every time I plan our meals for the week he suggests tacos.  You say he doesn't like chicken, but would he mind chicken in a soup?  One huge cost-saver for us is to purchase a whole chicken, roast it, and pick off it for a day or two.  Then boil down the bones into stock and make soup out of it with some veggies and noddles.  It's extremely cheap, and one roast chicken and some veggies goes a really long way for two people.  Any extra servings of soup I freeze to use for a later time if we start to get too sick of it.  If chicken is no good, then turkey is good.  I also make a ton of stews in my crock pot with beef cubes and veggies, which is also really cheap.  Why not make pizza?  Usually, per serving and depending on the ingredients it's cheaper than buying frozen pizzas.  Pizza dough is easy to make, and this way your boyfriend can customize what he wants.  And stir fries!  If your boyfriend doesn't like rice, there are tons of Asian noodles you can use instead.  Some cheap pieces of beef or pork, a small variety of vegetables, sauce, and you have a full meal plus tons of leftovers for the next day.  So cheap and easy, and again you can customize it however you want."
Cheap_Meals,1ulcf1,Moirainewaw,0,Tue Jan 7 03:24:13 2014 UTC,"I actually tried suggesting some chicken soup recently since it's getting cold and he refused :( Can you really just use turkey in place of chicken- like have everything else the same but with turkey? He may like that because he does like turkey lol. I'll have to run it by him. I did make beef stew and he loved it(forgot to mention that) and it's definitely really cheap though one problem I ran into was there were several pieces that were fatty. I used a chuck roast, is there a different meat I could use with less fat in it?  I've never really thought about making our own pizzas haha. Thanks for the suggestion! Should I just make the dough from scratch(im unsure of my ability to turn it into a circle) or is there pre made dough I could pick up?  Which noodles would you suggest? We tried rice noodles but he didn't like how one noodle was ""good"" to him but others were too hard lol so he wound up tossing them. Do you have any basic recipes for a stir fry as well?"
Cheap_Meals,1ulcf1,Moirainewaw,1 point,Tue Jan 7 04:39:21 2014 UTC,"Hell yea, we're just finishing off a turkey noodle soup with onions, carrots, celery, and parsley.  Simple, cheap, but oh so good.    For the beef stew, you can always cut off most of the fat.  If there's still a lot of fat you can't get before it's cooked, just refrigerate the stew once it's done and skim off the fat at the top when it hardens.  I find buying the pre-cut beef stew cubes usually means much less fat, but you might not get as good value as a whole roast.  I don't tend to need much meat in stews anyway, since I have so many veggies filling it up.  Most grocery stores should have some kind of frozen dough, though it might not be pizza dough.  If you're really into the cost-savings, I'd make it at home (plus it tastes much better).  The great thing about just cooking for yourself and your SO is that if it's not a perfect circle, nobody cares.  The trick is to stretch out the dough from the middle, not the edges.  If you stretch the edges, the dough can break, and then your pizza sauce will leak.  Something like this recipe for the pizza dough would be good, though I'm lazy and I just use regular flour.    For stir fries, I prefer something like egg noodles as it's more familiar to me (aka more similar to pasta).  I think your boyfriend would prefer something like that.  You can pick up a big pack of egg noodles at your grocery store for really cheap, and they're so easy to make.  As for recipes, it's all pretty open to what you have in the house.  I tend to use lots of veggies in mine (carrots, peppers, peas, onions, etc), and once everything is cooked I throw it all together with corn starch dissolved in some soy sauce.  If I want to go fancy, I might throw in some toasted sesame oil, or a little honey/sugar for a sweet and salty flavor.  Or you can just serve it plain if that's to your boyfriend's preference."

I just made diced chicken + salsa + beans over lettuce and it was pretty good (obviously you can replace the chicken with something else).  Spicy is easy to get around, just make things mildish and have him add his own spices.  I dated a very picky eater for a long time. The easiest thing for us to do was to keep our food budgets separate and cook for ourselves. When I broke up with him, I made a rule to not date any babies in the future. I would highly recommend this rule."

Cheap_Meals,1rtdvl,Kluetone,3,Thu Jan 9 21:45:26 2014 UTC,I've found tomato paste in a glass jar!  It's great and makes it so easy to just use a tablespoon at a time.  I bought it in an Italian grocery store.
Cheap_Meals,1rtdvl,starchildx,1 point,Sun Dec 1 14:38:47 2013 UTC,I always had problems with tomato paste going mouldy until I bought it in glass jars. If you store the glass jar upside down in your fridge it will last even longer. No idea on the science but an Italian Nonna told me thats the best way to store them and she was right!

The soup is sold in sachets of powder which can be poured into a mug or cup, which is then filled with near-boiling water and stirred.  In the United States and Canada the product is manufactured and marketed by Unilever's Lipton brand, and in Australia under the Continental brand. In the United Kingdom the product is sold as Batchelors Cup-a-Soup, a brand which is now owned by Premier Foods. In the Netherlands it's sold under the Unox brand. In South Africa it's sold under the Knorr brand.  Popular flavors include minestrone, chicken noodle, tomato soup and chicken and vegetable. Low-calorie versions also exist in the UK, under the name ""Slim-a-Soup"", and include slightly different flavours, such as Mediterranean tomato. 2007 saw the introduction of ""Cup-a-Soup Extra"", individual sachets of soup and pasta sold in a variety of flavours, including cheese and broccoli (with tagliatelle), chicken and mushroom (with pasta), minestrone, and Tangy Salsa Tomato.  wikipedia"

Cheap_Meals,1r97g1,jlking3,7,Sat Nov 23 04:38:51 2013 UTC,"Baked chicken leg quarters are a possibility. I don't know about prices in your location, but here, a 10 pound bag of chicken leg quarters is $8.99. One leg quarter per person, this will make about 3 dinners for 3. Just place on a perforated baking sheet, brush with regular (not lowfat) italian salad dressing. Bake at 375 degrees for 50 minutes. (edit: or until the juices run clear.) Brush some more dressing over the chicken whenever you remember to do so.  When you have 20 minutes left of baking time, cook 1 cup of rice according to package directions (you'll make about 2 cups of cooked rice, more than enough for 3 people). When the rice is done, add one can of drained mushroom stems and pieces, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley. Stir until everything's combined. (You can use minute rice if you want to save time, but regular rice tastes better.)  When there's about 10-15 minutes left in baking, steam 2 cups of broccoli or carrots until tender-crisp.  Serve. If you want to add buttered bread or rolls, go ahead.  Alternatively, you can make slaw with cabbage (very inexpensive) in a sweet vinegar dressing. Before preparing the chicken, chop cabbage until you have 2 cups of chopped cabbage. Chop up 1/4 cup of almonds or peanuts. Add 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and the nuts to the cabbage and stir. Add 1 teaspoon onion powder, and salt/pepper to taste. Stir until thoroughly combined and refrigerate. If you do this the day before, you get an even better flavor.  Easy dessert: take an 8 ounce container of generic cool-whip, thaw it completely. Add one small container of lime yogurt and one small container of lemon yogurt. stir until well mixed and pour into a graham cracker crust. Freeze. Serve frozen."

You can add onion&garlic, either dried or fresh. If fresh, cook them in the fat of the bacon.   Mix the egg & parmesan in a big bowl. Cook your meat, cut up small, add to bowl. Steam your veggies, cut up, add to bowl. Boil your pasta, add to bowl. Mix up.   Fancier version of recipe found at http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2012/05/pasta-carbonara/"

One additional, no-cost trick to kick fried rice up a notch is to leave the cooked rice in the fridge over night before frying. It hardens a little from losing moisture which helps to get it closer to the kind you would get in a restaurant (the other trick is super high heat which is essentially impossible to achieve at home without a hood vent)."

Cheap_Meals,1r05ph,spiffmana,5,Wed Nov 20 02:23:05 2013 UTC,"Get them 1) skin on, and 2) bone-in. Then peel off the skin and debone it yourself following these instructionsAt my neighborhood Latino grocer in NYC two large chicken breasts this way cost about $2-2.50. The boneless skinless kind are about $4.50. At Whole Foods I'd likely pay $9!  This is why you get the bone-in, skin-on kind - you can make chicken soup. here's my recipe after I use up two chicken breasts:   Chicken breast leftovers 2 cubes of chicken boullion (I like the Knorr brand) Half an onion celery stick 1-2 carrots, peeled 2 cloves of garlic 1 bay leaf salt as needed canola oil   Sear the chicken chunks in the pot you're going to make the soup in with oil. Don't worry about cooking evenly - you just want to brown them for flavor around most of the sides. Dice the onion, carrot, and celery until you have about a handful of each ingredient. Fry those in a separate pan with diced garlic to make your soup base.  Now add about 2 quarts of water, the boullion cubes, the fried vegetables, and the bay leaf to the chicken in the pot. Boil for 10-20 to get the essence out of the chicken bones and stuff, and you have a nice chicken soup! Salt to taste.  If you have white rice, add it when serving if you want chicken and rice soup. Also, if you had actual chicken meat lying around, I'd fry that with the bones and skin and chunks from before. I tallied up the costs and it cost me around $1.00 a bowl.  Bonus - Out of the skin, bones, and extra meat (I'm not too careful when deboning) you can make chicken soup.  You can even cut costs further if you like dark meat; a 12-pack of chicken thighs costs about $6.50 at my cheap grocer."

Cheap_Meals,1qpjgv,dewprisms,1 point,Fri Nov 15 21:49:16 2013 UTC,"I never understood why those are called tostadas when if you order one in a Mexican restaurant, it comes in a tortilla bowl and not those crap flat shells."
Cheap_Meals,1qpjgv,some1american,1 point,Thu Jan 9 21:44:05 2014 UTC,I've never had one come in a bowl at a Mexican restaurant.

Cheap_Meals,1qpjgv,tandroy,2,Fri Nov 15 21:43:02 2013 UTC,"You have to think that you likely don't use ALL of the ingredients at once. The salsa, cheese, tostadas, etc would typically not use the entire container. If you used other things like lettuce, sour cream, olives, jalapenos, etc, it would also not use the whole container.  That aside, you could get by even cheaper by buying a big pack of corn tortillas and making your OWN tostadas (which is why I find it hilarious that they said in the link that they were ""too expensive"" in Ohio, lol what).  For that recipe exactly the rough breakdown would be:   can of black beans - 1.00 (cheaper if you use dried!) can of refried beans - 1.00 orange pepper - 1.00 salsa - .50 cheese- .50 chicken - 1.00 guacamole - 2.00   So yeah, a bit more than $5 but a lot of that would be more than enough to make the meal twice."

I make healthy alfredo sauce, meat sauce etc. AMAZING. I know it is a veg but switching things up is always nice (spaghetti squash is also something I sub for pasta often, makes good chicken tetrazzini) I have also used a mandolin to slice zucchini in thin strips (vertically) and used them as a 'wrap' for ravioli. You can then put them in a dish, cover them with sauce and extra cheese and bake them.   Have you tried making Socca before?

Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,0masterdebater0,9,Sat Nov 23 18:42:06 2013 UTC,My girlfriend has celiacs
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,meliasaurus,1 point,Thu Nov 14 12:11:21 2013 UTC,If your girlfriend has celiacs make sure not to cross contaminate her kitchen with gluten foods. I live by myself. But I recently went to a lunch with friends. I some how ate some gluten and was sick for a week. My best guess is the knife from someone else's bread left crumbs in the cheese.  Once you're not eating gluten for a while you become more and more sensitive to it so after a while even crumbs can make you sick.
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,0masterdebater0,-2,Fri Nov 15 02:27:43 2013 UTC,"Again, sorry to not be productive food idea wise. I thought it was likely that someone in your ""family"" had gluten intolerance, it's just i know so many people that are on this gluten free fad I just had to say something."
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,molly9945,6,Tue Mar 4 17:39:54 2014 UTC,I have a family member who was diagnosed as celiac. Trust me when I say that the headache of eating gluten free - the expense and inconvenience - will eventually sway all the fad-seekers back to regular food.
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,ghostofpennwast,3,Fri Nov 15 21:17:22 2013 UTC,"My wife is Celiacs so I have ended up eating much less gluten than before. It feels a little easier on the digestive system. If you eat a healthy varied diet what is the harm in excluding gluten? Also the fad is coming in rather handy to spread the sale of GF bread, GF menus at restaurants greatly benefitting those who have true gluten-related health issues."
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,molly9945,6,Sat Nov 16 18:59:37 2013 UTC,"I agree with this. I wouldn't eat breads or anything still, mostly because I'm not into bread or processed sugars, but fruits are important. If you are gluten intolerant I suggest adding more meats into your diet as they are gluten free. Make pork fried rice, burgers without the buns. Stuff like that"

Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,bannana,6,Fri Nov 15 04:02:17 2013 UTC,"unless you have Celiac disease or a wheat allergy you should eat gluten,   This comment is pretty specific, you addressed people with celiac and wheat allergy while leaving out the vast number of people that also should not eat wheat and gluten in any form that are gluten sensitive (these people do get sick from gluten just in different ways than a celiac) . You simply do not know enough about this to comment, so maybe you shouldn't ."
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,MesaDixon,-1,Fri Nov 15 21:11:53 2013 UTC,gluten sensitivity is considered a wheat allergy...
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,PromisesPromise5,3,Fri Nov 15 22:31:09 2013 UTC,"Not exactly, you can have a wheat allergy while being able to consume gluten from rye or barely. People with a gluten sensitivity can't have anything with gluten at all. Many of the symptoms are the same though.    I did have a look at the wiki and to my surprise they have updated it since the last time I looked and the update is fairly comprehensive and has quite a bit of the information that should be there. This is in stark contrast to the last time I was there and it was essentially all wrong.  Fortunately it looks like the new research is creeping out into the world.    People that go on a GF diet are often doing it for other reasons than weight loss, it's very difficult to get a correct diagnosis for this since the tests only work about 50% of the time and regular GP's for the most part don't have a clue about any of this so really the only way to find out short of having a doctor that specializes in gluten related issues is to quit gluten for 3-6 months and see what happens. People that do need a GF diet will see results and in many cases will be pretty dramatic.  Often when someone is going GF they don't know why they just know they are sick and want to get better and for some this is definitely the way."
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,DBuckFactory,2,Sat Nov 16 03:14:55 2013 UTC,"All gluten may be created equal, but all foods containing it are not.  Some things I do okay with, others, not so much. I can tell the difference in the way I feel when I eat, say, whole wheat bread or Wheaties.  Acid reflux, stomach cramps difference.   Pay attention to how foods affect you, and eat accordingly. If you feel better when you don't eat gluten, don't eat it.  Just don't tell me about it."
Cheap_Meals,1qluqt,hooah212002,2,Sat Nov 16 03:35:20 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like most people (that I've seen, anyway) that are doing these sorts of diets are similar to the cross fit stereotype: Why would they do it if they couldn't tell everyone that they're doing it once every 5 minutes?"

I start by making a first batch with all the milk and half the rice, when the rice starts to breakdown and the mixture tickens, I add the second half of leftover cooked rice and stir a minimum before cooling down. That way you have whole grains of rice in a thick creamy rice slurry. A bit like tapioca pudding."

Cheap_Meals,1qcwmc,aManPerson,6,Mon Nov 11 07:32:49 2013 UTC,It sounds like the flour is being used as a thickening agent. Might I suggest adding the flour to the chicken and veg and cooking it for a minute or two before adding the liquid?   This sounds and looks fantastic.

Cheap_Meals,1q6z2p,chatatwork,4,Fri Nov 8 21:15:01 2013 UTC,"Whenever you're dealing with salmonella, you have to be careful and sensible.  The heat of a chicken when its center is cooked to 400F will kill the bacteria, but that's not the only concern for you when cooking chicken.  If raw chicken is allowed to sit for a length of time so that the bacteria produces toxins in the chicken, those toxins may not be neutralized once the meat is cooked.  If you cut or handle the raw chicken with these toxins in it, you may spread them to the cutting surface, to your knife, to your hands and body, and then to any other food that the cutting board, the knife, or your hands touch.  So when eating your cooked chicken, even if the salmonella organisms are dead, you may still be ingesting something that makes you ill.  Always handle meat with care when cooking and prepping."

Cheap_Meals,1q6z2p,jns12,1 point,Sat Nov 9 12:34:26 2013 UTC,"I like making chili. It's cheap, filling, and as long as you aren't a complete idiot it's foolproof (all you really need to do is chop and stir).   Start of with a pretty big pot on medium heat. Add a little oil (a tablespoon or so. Enough to cover the pan) Add some onions (chopped into pieces of some kind. Small-ish. Really doesn't matter much). Add a pinch of salt (a teaspoon or so). Let this sit for a few minutes, until it's shiny and almost translucent. If it's start turning brown turn down the heat.   Then add some meat. 400 grams or so of minced meat of some kind is nice. Or something else. You're going to cook it through no matter what it is. I wouldn't use sausages, but that's really the only thing. Then let it brown a little. Then add in a bouillon cube, some water (a few dl), a can of tomatoes, a can of beans of some kind (kidney, chili, brown beans, white beans.. mostly anything goes).   Then some spice (sweet chili sauce is nice, chili powder and cumin, oregano, pepper, garlic, fresh chilies, pizza spice.. Add about a tablespoon of anything (except for chili powder and chili sauce. Start of with a teaspoon of chili powder and then adjust to desired spice level, and a good splash of chili sauce) If you use a can of chili beans you can even get by with no spice).  Then let it sit for 15 - 20 minutes at a gentle boil. It depends on how thick you want it, if it starts to be to thick before 10 minutes are up, add some more water. Then just taste and adjust the spice (maybe add a little salt).   Serve with a salad, on tortillas, with tortilla chips, with bread.. Anything goes.   You brown two things (on low heat), and throw everything in and wait. As long as you stir a few times and don't turn the heat up to much it's almost impossible to destroy. And you can adjust the spice and ingredients to make a million variations (just be careful so you don't add too much spice) . And it freezes well, is filling and cheap.   A few variations, that's almost as simple: Don't add the beans, and serve it on pasta. Add more water and a few more greens (carrots, mushrooms, etc) and you have yourself a soup."

The most expensive thing is the sesame oil--but it is a must (and at 3 dollars a bottle it's not completely out of reach).  All you need: Pre-Cooked and chilled white rice.

Add 2/3 tablespoons of Sesame oil to a pan, then add a chopped up onion, the frozen peas and carrots--and just kinda let that cook for awhile.  Once they look cooked enough, dump in your chilled white rice (I never measure the cups of rice I use--normally I think I dump 3 cups in) (if you have chicken you add it now too).  Stir.  Add the soy sauce.   Now you cook that for a bit, then push what you can to the side, and on the newly empty side add two eggs (or more/less) and just scramble them up--once cooked stir through the dish.  Boom.

Oven baked chicken tenders  Ingredients:   Chicken tenders Spices of any kind   ­Optional Ingredients:   BBQ Sauce (substitutable with any sauce you like) Eggs   Cooking Directions:   Heat oven to 400°F (or 200°C). Sprinkle spices or seasoning into a Glass Baking Dish. Place tenders in dish and sprinkle spices on chicken. If you have chosen to use eggs: Break an egg into a small bowl, mix it with a fork until the consistency is the same for the entire mix. Brush egg mix on both sides of the chicken. If you have chosen to use sauce: Pour sauce over chicken (or brush with a fork), flip chicken and repeat for the other side. When oven is hot, place the baking dish into the middle of the oven. Leave in the oven for 14 minutes. Remove baking dish from oven, flip each chicken tender around and apply extra sauce (if you have chosen to use sauce). Place baking dish back into oven for another 14 minutes. Dinner is served. Cut into the middle of the biggest piece to ensure that meat inside is not raw. If it's raw, place back into oven for 5 minutes -- cut a different piece this time since the opening will have cooked for sure.   Depending on the size of your chicken tenders, your baking dish and how packed each tender is onto the plate, you may want to adjust the 14 minutes slightly. For few small tenders, 12 minutes each is usually enough. For thick, well-packed tenders, you should go with 15 minutes. If you have multiple baking dishes in there, you should increase the time by at least a minute on each side.  This recipe is pretty much fool-proof and you can experiment with it. The absolute minimum amount of work is literally:  Tenders on baking dish, season with whatever seasoning you have (hell, pepper if you have nothing -- or nothing at all!) put in the oven for 14 minutes, flip tenders, oven again for 14 and done!"

I honestly haven't heard much about cooking things other than rice in a rice cooker, but there are plenty of simple things you can make WITH rice.  Fried rice is always a good call, especially because it can make use of day old rice that you may not have finished off in your first go.  The ingredient list is very flexible but you generally want:   An onion Two eggs Garlic Day-Old Rice Oyster sauce (or some comparable flavoring substance) Sesame Seeds (if you want to get wild) Some type of meat if that's your thing (Spam works better than you'd think)   Just cook up everything but the rice and eggs in a skillet or Wok with some cooking oil and when everything's done to your satisfaction add in your rice.  Mix it all together for a few minutes until the rice has heated throughout then stir in as much oyster sauce as you want for flavor.  Make a space in the center for the eggs and add those, let them cook for a bit, and then mix it into the rice for long enough for the eggs to cook."

Cheap_Meals,1q0q7q,TXpatriate,2,Thu Nov 7 09:35:47 2013 UTC,"Don't get MinuteRice -- it's overpriced garbage Do get an actual bag of rice -- I dunno about brands but I get ""Rooster"" brand Do rinse your rice before cooking   How to rinse and cook rice:   Take the cooking bowl out of your rice cooker and put it in your sink Fill it with a couple cups of rice Fill it well over the top of the rice and scrub the rice with your hands, as though you were washing your hands with soap (do not use soap while washing your rice!!! do not scrub too hard to grind the rice!) White residue should be deposited into the water -- this is normal and desired as the rice is slightly dirty -- you should slowly pour the water out into the sink without pouring the rice down too Repeat the last two steps until the rice is reasonably rinsed (usually two or three repetitions) Fill it up with enough water to cover the rice plus one joint in your finger -- not enough water will cause it to burn(!) and it's hard to put too much water, so you can eyeball the rice:water ratio   Your rice cooker is not a crock pot. Cooking non-rice things in it too often may damage the rice cooker, especially since rice cookers are usually made in China so they're not built to last >5 years. I think it's fine to mix in some chicken bouillon to give it some extra flavour.  Rice will usually last a couple days in the cooker, and it's really easy to notice when and how the rice will spoil -- usually it will just harden and turn yellow."

Frozen bags of veggies in a steamer basket while you're cooking rice makes a great quick meal. If you don't have one then don't sweat it, most of the things you can put in a steamer basket can be microwaved (to the chagrin of some). Sriracha and soy sauce also go a long way in making a dish turn into a meal."

Example, not promotion. *I have an earlier generation of this steamer and have used it to death. It's easy to clean, doubles as a pair of colandars and is good for about 5 years of hard use. I use mine about three or four times a week, sometimes more than once a day. If you are planning on steaming chicken than you want something that WILL get it up to safe temperatures. They claim to be able to steam rice.   Technically true. Not in such a way that you would want to eat it. You can, however, make steamed pork buns."

I have something like this, which works great because I eat a lot of fresh steamed veggies (asparagus, brocolli, cauliflower, string beans, etc), and you can cook rice, or steam fish, etc. I highly recommend these things to people. Cleanup is a breeze, steaming preserves more of the nutrients, you don't use all the oils or butters like in a frying pan, etc.  A lot of south east asian cuisine is cooked on a steamer, this is because a lot of families only have a single cooking element, and you can stack the steamers on top of each other to cook everything at the same time."

Cheap_Meals,1q0q7q,ghostofpennwast,1 point,Sun Nov 10 04:16:43 2013 UTC,One trick that Reddit taught me is that rice freezes and reheats very well.

You can also toss some frozen chicken strips and frozen veggies in the bags of frozen rice to microwave a pretty decent little meal quickly.

Cheap_Meals,1q0q7q,Ibster,1 point,Thu Nov 7 03:27:16 2013 UTC,"This is my go to recipe when I get home late at night: (No real measurements because I've never measured anything. The closest I can get to a measurement is about 1/4 lbs of beef will go with about a cup of uncooked rice) You'll need a side pan for this, but with the timing they should be both finished around the same time. Start up your rice. Warm up your pan and throw in the ground beef. Season it with whatever dry spices you want (I usually just use seasoned salt, some pepper, some red pepper flakes, and garlic powder if my jar of pre-minced is out). Throw in some chopped onion (or whatever fresh veggies you have lying around, I sometimes mix it up with different kinds of sweet peppers) and cook until the onion is semi translucent. If you have the fresh garlic or canned/ frozen veggies now's the time to chuck that in. Depending on your mood you can add some beef broth and some corn starch (I like bistro gravy browning myself) to make a saucy one to pour over your rice. If you go without the gravy my little cousin likes to mix it all up and splashes it with ketchup and Sriracha sauce. It's easy to experiment with this one so go nuts."
Cheap_Meals,1q0q7q,Ravenna,1 point,Thu Nov 7 15:16:02 2013 UTC,"First let's talk basic staples. This is about eating well without breaking the bank, variety is important for me.  1 - Grab various SORTS of rice. Basmati Rice lives in my pantry as a staple, along with generic long-grain rice, which I buy in 20 Kilo bags. I also stock sushi rice because I like making sushi. This isn't about that, but it's another cool thing you can do with a rice-cooker.  2 - Canned Beans - not seasoned, just plain beans. Yes, you can also soak and cook from bulk. I would do that if rice and beans were something I prepared every day. I don't, it's only about twice a week. I MIGHT consider actually soaking and canning my own beans at some point, though.   I stock a variety, looking for sales.    black beans (my go-to)  red beans  mixed beans (usually for lazy chili, and hey, now you can do that too.)   3 - Black Olives! (sliced and whole)  4 - Red Lentils (you can substitute 1/4 cup red lentils for rice and proceed as normal)  5 - Salsa, Soy Sauce, Sweet Chili-Garlic Sauce, Sriracha Chili sauce, Balsamic Vinegars, big ol' jug of generic Salsa, at least one variety of Curry.  OK, now for that staple of SouthWestern Cuisine - Rice and Beans.  Make two cups of rice, according to directions. Drain and add one can of beans, your choice. Press button. Wait for it to go ""clunk,"" wait 5-10 minutes, stir. Season to taste in the bowl.  You want something with hamburger? Omit beans, add the lentils. (gives a slightly nutty flavour and a creamier texture) Proceed as normal, while browning hamburger (in worchestercshire, soy, balsamic or.. well, whatever you like.) When rice is done, fold in hamburger, season to completion, serve.  Vegan? Well, toss in tofu - brown it if you like, or just cube it and toss it in.  Want some veggies in there? Sure! one small yellow onion diced will play fine with two cups of rice being cooked, with or without the other things.  Did you see the Black Olives up there? This may be one of my favorites.  DRAIN and reserve the liquid!!! add the rice and the olives to the cooker. Use ALL the vinegar plus whatever amount of water you need. (I usually make one cup of rice (dry volume) to one can of olives, to get my preferred rice/olive ratio.   When done, add margerine/olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.   2AM WOW Raid Party Feeding when everything but the gas station is closed.   2 Cups Basmati or regular long-grain rice, according to directions.  1 can sliced olives, using liquid. 1 package teriayki beef jerkey, chopped or torn into small bits.   Add required liquid, including olive liquid. Cook and let it fully absorb liquid. Stir, adding 1/4 to 1/3 cup margerine. Portion into bowls, put salt, pepper and hot stuff on table."

Cheap_Meals,1q0q7q,samisalsa,1 point,Wed Nov 6 16:19:11 2013 UTC,It depends on the rice. Basmati rice and long grain rice require different ratios. I don't recall what the ratio is for glutionous rice - because I read the package every time. Same for brown rice. Read the directions.

Getting bread and making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches could last you a long time.   If you have eggs, mayo, cheese, (maybe optional butter, tomatoes and onions) you could also consider making quesadillas and egg sandwiches.  Egg sandwiches - hard boil eggs, peel and mash. Mix in butter(optional) and mayo(or miracle whip), salt and pepper. Place mixture between two slices of bread.  Quesadillas - you will need the tortillas to make this work, but they shouldn't be out of your budget. Optional is to butter them up first, place cheese, and optional tomatoes and onions. Cook in oven until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are starting to brown. Don't overcook, watch it it shouldn't take too long to cook at 300.  If you want, buy some potatoes and using stuff you already have you can make a ton more stuff. Mashed potatoes, baked potato, fried potatoes, home fries, etc."

Search around for more info. This is great because eggs can be easily cooked in the microwave, over easy, scrambled, and even poached. Perfect for sandwiches.  If you have a coffee maker in your room, you'd be surprised at just how much you can cook inside that.  Honestly, I'd do sandwiches and wraps with small portions of cheap deli cheese (and buy more every 2 or 3 days) and fresh veggies, mainly zucchini (because it's good raw or cooked in the microwave or boiled or whatever) and peppers. Lots of pickles if you can get your hands on them. Hummus is good. The bread and eggs may help you to feel more full and give you some decent protein and carbs. Hope this helps!"

In the U.S. (and maybe Canada?) but not Europe (I am told) the eggs are blast washed to get them really clean, but the process removes the original coating on the egg shell. In Europe where they don't blast wash the eggs, they are generally stored non-refrigerated.

Broccoli is great this way too.  If I have greek yogurt (buy the big, plain containers and use it for everything - (salad dressing, sour cream replacement, use it in a marinade for chicken, and of course mixing with jam or syrup to make your own flavored yogurt for work), I'll use that instead of milk to make the tuna-mac even creamier.

Throw it on a sandwich with toasted bread, some lettuce and onions-voila.  It's like magic.  It is an easy way to get variety for a minimal amount of effort.

Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,idoneeshatt,9,Sat Oct 26 23:13:38 2013 UTC,"If you do want meat, buy cheaper ground beef (73% lean) and brown it with onions, salt, cumin, and chili powder.  It's still going to bring up the overall cost of your burritos, but if you partition it and add plenty of extra ingredients, a pound can last you up to a week.  Cheap salsa: tomato, jalapeno, onion, cilantro, chili powder (if desired) and maybe a squeeze of lime.  Chop veggies to your desired level of fine-ness, mix all ingredients, and you have a pretty awesome homemade pico de gallo for around $1.  It's best if you let it sit for an hour or two before eating to let the flavors meld and it'll keep for around a week in the fridge if kept covered.  Cheese: buy a block and a cheese grater.  Cheese keeps for a long time - if it starts getting a little moldy, just shave off those bits and keep going.  It'll still taste the same and it won't hurt you at all.  I'd avoid the super-cheap cheese (i.e. Walmart-brand) because that tends to have a consistency closer to plastic and (according to my roommate) sucks all the flavor out of everything you put it on."
Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,ChristophColombo,1 point,Sun Oct 27 00:00:40 2013 UTC,Ground beef is great.  Chicken is cheaper where I live so that's what I use; I can rarely find ground beef below $3.50/lb and I can get chicken at ~$1.50/lb regularly.

It's still safe to eat the cheese, but you're supposed to cut at least 1/2"" off on every side of the mold and throw it away because the mold is not just what you see- it also has 'roots' or tendrils that go down into the food.

Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,DctrCat,3,Mon Nov 18 00:34:10 2013 UTC,"I just stumbled upon this subreddit and it could not have been at a better time.   You made my night.    What are the actual ingredients to making a super cheap burrito (I understand the canned black beans can be bought for dirt cheap), but I am more interested in the meat and cheese or salsa to add to it.   My favorite burrito is probably the breakfast burrito, simply because eggs are a nice combination of being nutritious with protein and relatively cheap (if you don't get the free-range, organic, anti-biotic free, etc. eggs). You can also get frozen potatoes O'Brien on sale and in bulk for really cheap. Cook up the potatoes in a little oil until they're brown, add the egg, and wrap it up, and you're eating burritos that average out to about $0.50 per as an entire meal. It was one of my go-to meals back in college.   If you're looking for a more traditional burrito, You should consider buying meat in bulk that you can cut up and freeze. Chicken can be easily frozen for up to 2 months, in my experience, meaning if you find a deal on a whole chicken, you can get it home, cut it up, freeze it, and defrost as you need for weeks. You can also boil the carcass with some left over vegetables (the ends of onions, carrots, and celery) to make really good stock, which can also be frozen.   If you've got one thigh worth of meat, that's easily enough for several burritos. Cook the chicken any way you'd like, combine with some canned black beans, and look for the small jar of salsa, which can usually be found for less than $3.00.   If you have the extra time, I also strongly suggest making your own tortillas. You can get a 64 oz. tub of lard at Walmart for $6. AP flour is dirt cheap, so is salt, and it requires very little baking soda. And, no offense to Mission, but they're so much better than store-bought that you'll probably never go back. They're cheaper, they're a little healthier (depending on your perspective on the science of animal fat), and they're absolutely delicious."
Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,Willravel,1 point,Sun Oct 27 02:38:32 2013 UTC,"fyi: the lard you can buy at normal grocery stores is stabilized using trans fats. go for the real stuff, or just use butter/coconut oil/olive oil."

Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,chingao327,2,Sun Oct 27 18:36:05 2013 UTC,"I came here to say this. I use this recipe often with rice, beans, eggs, cheese, salsa, and whatever veggies I have laying around. It usually makes around 15-20 for me, and I freeze 'em up for whenever I'm hungry and lazy (doesn't have to be just for breakfast!)"
Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,beanieb,2,Sun Oct 27 21:44:04 2013 UTC,"Cheapest burrito with meat in it, as far as I know:  Get cheapest chicken cuts you can. I can find whole chickens at some supermarkets near me (east coast USA) for $1-$1.50/lb.  Sometimes other cuts like leg quarters are cheapest.  Breast is always more expensive.  Some supermarkets always have cheaper chicken than others, even within close distance to each other.  Dried beans = cheap as hell.  Canned beans cost more but are still pretty cheap, and they're much easier because they're already prepared.  You can buy 2 lb bags of like store brand shredded cheese at stores near me for like $10 or less sometimes.  How I make burritos:  Presoak dried Pinto beans overnight.    Cook the beans.  ALWAYS BOIL dry beans for 15 mins or so before reducing heat so you don't get sick from lectin.  Cooking the beans can take a long time, taste them to see when they're soft enough.  (skip above steps if you bought canned beans).  Roast a chicken in oven.  Strip it from bones. (do above steps at same time--start beans first, they often take longer than you think)  Cook a big pot of rice on stove; hard to say how much, I always make too much rice by accident.  Drain cooked beans, add some oil and maybe chopped onion and salt, possibly a little water if the mash consistency is too thick, and you mash them up with the other stuff and fry the mash in a pan with a little oil to make refried beans.  Take a bunch of tortillas, make burrito with each one out of refried beans first (spread on tortilla), chicken, shredded cheese, rice and wrap it up.  Can warm in oven wrapped in foil or in microwave on plate.  I tend to eat my burritos on a plate and top them with sauce, rather than have the sauce inside like a Taco Bell style meal--but you can obviously put the condiments/sauces below inside the burrito when wrapping it up if you make them ahead of time:  I might make my own salsa too, canned diced tomatoes, onion, peppers, salt, other seasoning and boom you have some.  But if you can find cheap salsa you like this might not be necessary.  Guacamole is good as a topping too, of course.  I make it from avocado, tomato, salt, a little bit of chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, paprika. Instead of tomato, you can use other fruits.  I've gone with lemon juice, blueberries (mashed), even banana.  You'd be surprised how good these fruits are mashed up with mostly avocado and some onion.  Sour cream is cheap and available where you are, I'm sure.  You can make a shit ton of burritos for cheap using my method described above.  Imagining a 5 lb chicken and a pound bag of beans (usually like a $1.50 or so) you could probably make a dozen burritos without too much trouble, for a total cost of less than a buck apiece."

Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,mementosmentos,2,Sun Oct 27 00:57:06 2013 UTC,"Boil them now.  It's just to destroy the lectin.  It's a protein your body can't quite process, simmering heat doesn't break it down.  Boiling heat for long enough breaks it down.  Doesn't matter if you already finished them, just get them boiling again for 15 minutes and you're golden.  If not, it MIGHT make you sick.  Really depends.  If you get upset stomach or something, you'll know why.  I recommend just going through with the boiling if it's still possible."

Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,thistledownhair,2,Sun Oct 27 08:34:46 2013 UTC,I wash and then shred an unpeeled potato or two to my ground beef while it cooks. It helps stretch the meat.  You can also use a couple carrots this way. The shreds are so small that they cook while the meat simmers.
Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,Purpleotterbox6,1 point,Sun Oct 27 22:33:56 2013 UTC,"I do canned beans, TVP (textured vegetable protein, comes in a huge bag dehydrated for cheap from grocery) and bag of frozen mixed peppers/onion (like a dollar at the grocery and lasts for more than 1 round of burritos) spices and fry it up, tortillas and done. Vegan so no meat or cheese but with the right spices and textures you never notice no meat. Sometimes I spring for faux sour cream which is a good deal because it has no dairy and lasts muchhhhh longer in the fridge  Sometimes salsa and sriracha if I'm feeling spicy  Use a clean pan after you roll your burrito with the smallest spritz of oil on it on high and 'seal' your burrito closed with heat. About 20 seconds and flip. The crunchy outside is awesome"

Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,verossiraptors,1 point,Sun Oct 27 21:48:13 2013 UTC,"Here's a cheap and delicious recipe for meat that's perfect for burritos:  Pork Carnitas: First, get 4-5lb of the cheapest pork shoulder your grocery store offers. In my experience, this costs ~$5-6 and lasts for up to 2 weeks. Put this in a large pot with 3 cups of chicken broth or water, along with whatever other spices and flavorings you want to add. I've used paprika, oregano, and a quartered onion in the past.   Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Bring the water/broth to a boil on the stove over high heat, and spoon some of it over the meat. Then, transfer to the oven and let it cook for around 4 hours. If you're around and remember, you may want to spoon some of the liquid over the meat periodically--otherwise it's not a big deal.   Lastly, after 4 hours in the oven, the meat should be at the point where it falls apart easily. Transfer the meat and juices to a large stovetop pan on medium-high heat until most of the liquid is gone.   You can eat what you can/want right away, and save the rest for later. I usually put a few days' worth in the fridge and freeze the rest. Also, an important tip on reheating: don't just microwave your carnitas--they'll lose their moisture and turn out tough and bland. Take as much as you want to eat and put them in a pan on the stove along with a little bit of water, chicken broth, lime juice, or whatever else sounds good. Simmer the meat and liquid on medium heat until most of the liquid is gone, then serve.   Here's a tasty burrito recipe using these carnitas: Toss a clove or two of garlic (with the skin on) and ~1/4 of a small tomato (with the seeds removed) on the stove on high heat until they're partially blackened. When the heavenly aroma of roasting garlic fills your kitchen, take the garlic and tomato off the stove, and the skin off the garlic. Chop up your garlic and tomato along with cilantro, marinated jalapenos, and avocados (if money permits--1/4 of a large avocado should be sufficient for 1 burrito), and then toss your chopped veggies in the juice of 1/4 of a lime.   Next, heat a flour tortilla on the stove to the point where one side is browned and somewhat brittle but the other side is still soft and malleable--it may take some practice to get this bit right. At the same time, toss a bit of cheddar cheese (nothing too fancy) in with some black beans (from the can is fine) and heat them up--the microwave is okay for this. Finally, wrap your carnitas, beans+cheese, and veggies up in the tortilla with the crispy side out and enjoy!"
Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,verossiraptors,1 point,Sun Oct 27 22:38:15 2013 UTC,"I eat a lot of burrito type food. 60% of my food is some sort of burrito or burrito bowl. For meat, I always buy frozen chicken breast. You can get 2.5 pounds for about $7, cheaper than most ground beef. Also, better for you.  How to cook chicken for burritos and burrito bowls:  This recipe is absurdly easy. I used to get complicated, marinating the chicken and all that. That was a big mistake.  Ingredients: Thin sliced chicken breast (butterfly cut them if they are thick), lime juice (in a bottle is fine), olive oil, and Goya Adobo Seasoning.  Directions: Rub the chicken breast with olive oil, and then season it with the adobo seasoning. Put a pan on the burner on medium/high heat. Once it gets hot, splash lime juice into the pan and then immediately put your chicken in. You want it cooking in that lime juice.   You can use this exact same process for cooking steak, as well.   Definitely be using rice, particularly brown rice, to bulk up your burrito bowls.   For salsa: One standard can of diced tomatoes One small can of diced green chiles Some diced jalapenos (out a jar is fine). The amount is up to you depending on your ability to handle heat. Couple of tablespoons of lime juice Handful of cilantro.  However, I personally prefer Pico De Gallo to Salsa when it comes to burritos. Pico really freshens up the dish and makes it overall taste a lot better. Also super simple.  For Pico De Gallo: 5 vine-ripe tomatoes, diced (I choose vine-riped, you can choose something else). Half a white onion, diced 2-3 fresh jalapenos, diced very small Handful of cilantro, diced A good amount of lime juice"
Cheap_Meals,1pa6oa,fatman907,1 point,Wed Nov 13 03:28:49 2013 UTC,"Note, the pico de gallo recipe is a BULK recipe. As I mentioned, I eat a TON of beans and rice.

Cheap_Meals,1p3f9b,Esther82,7,Thu Oct 24 04:02:59 2013 UTC,"Water would be ok depending on what herbs/spices you have in there, but stock would be better. Stock cubes aren't expensive and they can really make a difference.   Also i will mix in about a tablespoon of flour mixed with water about half an hour before serving, this accounts for whatever liquid you have put in not reducing down and stops it being too watery for e.g. a stew.   Another good trick is to use up leftover wine rather than throwing it away. You'll want to leave the lid off and the temp on high for the last half hour though so it doesn't taste too boozy."

You could also substitute bacon and wine for nothing and milk, and it would still be delicious!  Cut up a few slices of bacon and fry it up in a stainless steel pan. Reserve the bacon bits, leaving the fat in the pan. If there's too much grease, soak some of it up with paper towel.  Throw in some chunks of chicken and cook thoroughly.  Deglaze with a splash of your favorite cheap white wine (Barefoot and Fish Eye top my list).  Dump in a bottle of Alfredo and add the bacon. Pour a little more wine in the bottle, cover and shake it up to get every last drop of creamy goodness, then dump in the pan.  Toss in some frozen spinach or maybe broccoli or some other green veg. Cook until the spinach wilts (or the other veggies are cooked through).  Take off heat and dump in your al dente linguine. Toss it all together and enjoy with the rest of your wine!

Swap the chicken for beef or sausage, white wine for red, maybe throw in some sautéd onions! Yum!  Plus every ingredient can be stored basically forever in the freezer or pantry, so it's a great go-to dinner.

Cheap_Meals,1ozb4t,DiffidentDissident,8,Tue Oct 22 20:24:15 2013 UTC,"I eat a metric fuckton of pasta and Alfredo sauce. You need to be careful, because it will make you fat, fast. (My poor husband.) Don't be afraid to thin that bottled Alfredo sauce a little bit with half-and-half or milk.   Typically I roast the chicken with garlic salt & pepper (and sometimes dill), then cut it into bite-sized pieces, then heat the sauce with the chicken in it. This helps to flavor the sauce. Then I add the pasta and cook it all together for a few minutes. This helps the sauce to absorb and the flavor to improve.  I also like to roast and cut up sweet/mild Italian sausage and throw it in with the pasta & sauce when I need a break from chicken. Try not to lose any of the juice when you cut up the sausage-- it makes the sauce taste so much better. Some grated parm will thicken it up and add flavor, but again: my cooking makes people fat, so use your own discretion.  Either of those, by the way, could be improved by throwing in a handful of baby spinach just before serving. Steamed broccoli (even if it was frozen in a bag first) goes incredibly well with both of these meats, because it holds so much sauce in the florets, although I tend to serve it more frequently with the chicken. Switching up the types of pasta helps, too. I like linguine, we eat a lot of egg noodles, but lately I've found that penne works incredibly well in those two recipes.  I eat these meals on the regular, on a tight budget. I hit up the local grocery outlet for all of it-- frozen chicken, frozen sausage, sauce, pasta, inexpensive dried seasonings, all in one place.   *Edited because I keep remembering things to add."
Cheap_Meals,1ozb4t,DiffidentDissident,7,Tue Oct 22 15:56:34 2013 UTC,"Get some loose hot sausage, not links. Cook it like ground beef. Until it's crispy.  Drain grease. Add to sauce.  Simmer sauce for a couple hours so that the sauce takes on some of the sausage flavor. Enjoy.  Pro Tip: Freeze the sausage first and do not thaw it out before cooking it.

Splash of oil in a skillet (as little as you can get away with), garlic, and sliced jalapeno peppers (works well with Anaheim if you want something less spicy). Saute them for a few minutes on high until the kitchen starts smelling like jalapeno. Reduce heat and slowly pour on the alfredo and let that cook through and the flavors mix. Then mix with your pasta (actually mix it, don't just pour it on top. Drain the pasta but save a little bit of the water. Mix the sauce into the pasta and pour a little bit of the water back in.

Doubly so if you're feeding someone else, as you get to say, ""I made the pasta from scratch,"" and then you're the coolest person who ever lived for the rest of the meal.  Super easy recipe: 1 cup white flour (bakers or durham makes the best, but not necessary) 1 egg 1 pinch salt 1 teaspoon of olive oil  Use your hands to mix this mess together in a bowl. Once it's mixed, add water, about a teaspoon at a time until it starts to form a solid mass. Put it on a flat surface and knead it until it becomes supple. Yes, supple. You'll know it when you see it.  Set it aside for one hour.  After an hour has passed, roll the mass out flat. A pasta machine is quickest, but you can use a rolling pin or a wine bottle for this. Make it as thin as possible before your elbows give out. Cut into desired shapes and dunk into boiling water with a teaspoon of olive oil.

Cheap_Meals,1ovzkz,Xelif,3,Mon Oct 21 07:13:11 2013 UTC,"I just made this and had a bowl. Here are some thoughts -  I'd put in a little bit more cumin - maybe closer to two teaspoons. Cooking by the recipe, the soup tastes... like boiled carrots, which isn't a bad thing (it's carrot soup after all!) but I personally like a bit more spice in my food. I put in 4 small cloves of garlic (probably equivalent to what the recipe calls for) and I feel like it could use even more!  The honey is completely and utterly unnecessary; carrots are sweet enough as it is!   It definitely needs some salt - I added a dash while the carrots were cooking, but I'd be tempted to go with a teaspoon or two; or you can just season to taste.  I don't have a foot processor so I had to mash the carrots by hand; they weren't quite soft enough after 30 minutes. It was also a bit watery for my taste at that point, so I let it simmer on low, uncovered, to further soften the carrots and evaporate the extra water. Without a food processor I ended up with something similar to, but definitely different from, the creamy soup in the picture.  You could probably toss in up to a half cup of yogurt.  Needs some umami. I seasoned with some cheap grated Parmesan and it really opened up the flavor.   Overall it's pretty decent - might be better if you actually have a food processor or blender!  Just thought I'd share. There seem to be some decent recipes on that site; one problem I noticed is that, while the site is ""broke-ass gourmet"", some of the recipes ask for distinctly non-""broke-ass"" kitchen implements."

Cheap_Meals,1ooji8,Kharmaticlism,5,Fri Oct 18 00:06:24 2013 UTC,"...I'm not trying to be insulting or demeaning with the following comment; just honest.  While cheap and possibly tasty, this recipe does not sound appetizing...which I see repetitively on this subreddit.  Something that I always hope for when I see new recipes is healthful, homemade food that also sounds easy and delicious.  I think that too many times people get wrapped up in the ""well, it would be even cheaper if you left out Prime Ingredients Number 1 and 2,"" even though the food is drastically reduced in nutrient value and flavor.  A challenge that all of us face is creating dishes that are nutritiously sound, but also budget friendly, and we get too wrapped up in the latter in r/Cheap_Meals.  I, too, am one of those people that eats Ramen (more times a week than I'd like to admit) to make ends meet.  It's hard to pass up lunch at $0.25 per meal, especially when all other bills are factored in...and is probably the biggest reason this recipe isn't something I'm going to attempt, since I'm eating those damned noodles several times a week already.  I commend you for cooking at home to decrease food costs, and also being aware of the nutritional value of the foods that you're eating.  I hope that both of us will be able to prepare better foods for ourselves in the future.  ...  As a side note...have you ever made ""Must-Go"" soup?"
Cheap_Meals,1ooji8,Kharmaticlism,1 point,Fri Oct 18 00:54:38 2013 UTC,"Don't knock it till you try it! I seriously enjoyed it. It's similar to Tomato Soup and Rice, or spaghetti. I understand it doesn't sound appealing, but maybe that's because it needs a fancy name like ""Must-Go"" instead of saying what it is right up front? ;) One of the reasons I decided to share this is its simplicity. It's just a couple of easy steps, anybody can make it, and it's certainly healthier than just eating ramen with seasoning, assuming your diet can afford the extra calories.

A thick stew is a good choice, since you can maybe pick up the cheapest meat on sale. A starchy spud like Russett potatoes will release at lot into the liquid, giving it an excellent consistency. You can add onions, carrots, etc. and serve it over rice.  You can even get bones from the butcher for free to start things off. There's still plenty of meat on them. Take it home, throw it in a pot, add some broth, throw in a potato. Baby, you got a stew goin'!"

I use this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Delicious-Ham-and-Potato-Soup/  I leave out the celery and sometimes I leave out the onion. I don't use those granules. At first I used broth but lately I have been using soup base and it turns out amazing. I also add in a bag of mixed veggies to beef it up. I do use more potatoes than they call for.

Season your chicken with some salt and pepper and Adobo if you have it.  Bake it.  Prepare the yellow rice per the package, but before closing lid to simmer, lay the leg quarters in with the rice.  When rice is done, you get that chicken flavor and the chicken has picked up some of the seasonings in the rice.  Another inexpensive option is chicken and dumplings.  1 quarts chicken broth.  1 8oz can cream of chicken soup.  1 can pre-made biscuit dough.  Bring broth to boil.  Add cream of chicken.  Add leg quarter.  When leg quarter is almost done, add the biscuit dough in chunks and let it go another 15 min or so.  This is like a 20 min recipe and done."

I season the shit out of the chicken and then boil it, then once it's done I remove it from heat and get rid of all the bones/skin, and tear the chicken into smallish pieces. Use the stock from the chicken instead of water, or mixed with water depending on how fat I want to be that night, to cook the rice in, and add the chicken to it as well. Then just cook the rice. You can also use more or less water than you normally would for rice, if you prefer it to be a soup."

Cheap_Meals,1nyt47,loose_impediment,1 point,Tue Oct 8 15:10:28 2013 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. Without the oil and frying, it's a healthier alternative to fried rice.  Have you thought about how the recipe might be further optimized? Coconut soup, because it contains coconut oil, is high in saturated fat.  1 cup (not 1 can) of Amy's Kitchen Coconut Soup, for instance, contains 11 g of saturated fat. 55% of RDA.  If you were to switch to say, vegetable stock and a few chopped mushrooms (or a small can of stems & Pieces) plus a little soybean, canola, corn, or olive oil, the recipe could be cheaper (canned coconut soup is pretty expensive), healthier, in terms of less saturated fat, and  taste pretty good. And it would stay ovovegetarian. For the cheap gourmands of the carnivorous persuasion, then the protein content and umami taste dimension can be augmented by using fish, chicken, or beef stock or even bouillon. By the way some of the coconut soup flavoring comes from seasoning with lemon grass, so of great interest to frugal cooks is the youtube video showing you how to Grow your own lemon grass in your kitchen for 44 cents. You really can't beat a little home-grown spice garden and subbing scratch cooking for prepared foods to make cheap meals a whole lot better than expensive meals."

Cheap_Meals,1nyt47,beware_of_hamsters,3,Wed Oct 9 00:06:31 2013 UTC,"I'd say this comes down to ones outlook on life. You could look at life and say, ""Life is short, I better eat perfectly so I can live longer and be healthier."" However, the next person is going to say, ""Life is short, I should do whatever the hell I want as long as I don't hurt anyone else."" Those two people are both right.   Don't try to understand why other people do something, just accept that what they did is what they choose to do."

Cheap_Meals,1nuxza,Apicalmeristem,3,Mon Oct 7 03:10:01 2013 UTC,I always use leftover carnitas.   My carnitas recipe:  2-3 lb pork butt (chuck roast is also yummy)  1 onion in sixths  1 can green chiles  Salt (about 2-3 tsp)  Pepper  2 tsp cumin  1 tsp coriander  2 Tbsp chile powder  3 cups chicken broth.   Chipotles peppers in adobo. Husband loves it spicy. I do 7 peppers for him. I prefer it at 5.   Dump it all in a Dutch oven. Cook until falling apart and most liquid is reduced.   Serve on tortillas. Also great in taquitos (tortillas rolled up and fried) or taco cups (wonton wrappers in muffin tins with meat and cheese. Bake 10 min)  I usually get 3 meals for us easily.   One is usually posole.   Leftover carnitas  Can green chiles  2 15? Oz cans hominy rinsed  1 tbsp chile powder  4 cups chicken broth.   Dump everything in. Summer for an hour. Yum!

Cheap_Meals,1n1lq0,doomrabbit,13,Tue Sep 24 18:53:05 2013 UTC,"I've never seen anyone use the fried rice method my Mother taught me, which is very easy and gives great results.  In a skillet gently heat some oil, add in finely diced onion (optional) then a measured amount of dry uncooked rice. Heat and stir until the rice turns opaque. Optionally continue a little longer until the rice develops a ""nutty"" smell and starts to brown. Then for each cup of rice you have used, pour in two cups of boiling water. Stand back as you do this as there will be lots of steam. Turn the pan down, cover and simmer for 12 mins. Add soy sauce, veggies as desired before it finishes and eggs at the end as in the OP.  This method of frying before boiling produces a very clean, non-sticky rice with separate grains and a delicious flavour that fried boiled rice doesn't have."

Apparently, TJ's plan in dropping <30 hr. a week workers was to put them on the state-run healthcare marketplaces that are set to launch under the Affordable Healthcare Act.   It's a bad move in the short term because the marketplaces are entirely untested and we're not sure how they will compare to TJ's previous healthcare coverage for part time employees, so this really isn't fair to TJ part time workers right now, however there's a logic to the move long-term. A lot of healthcare experts, economists, and both progressive and libertarian thinkers are concerned that the tying of healthcare insurance to employers is just another in a long series of systems put in place to prevent both fair competition (which would drive down costs) and to hide the true costs of healthcare (which balloons costs). If the marketplaces are successful, that's a meaningful milestone on the way to single-payer healthcare, something that benefits everyone who isn't in the healthcare insurance or pharmaceutical industry.   Since this is /r/cheap_meals, I don't want to get too far off topic, but this is an issue that interests me, and what Trader Joe's did is not black and white."

But 20 meals, portioned for 4 would make this really 80 individual meals.   I typically have a fresh juice for breakfast so 80 meals would last me well over a month. Plus left-overs. So basically, 1 1/2 to 2 months of food. I spend somewhere between $20 and $30 each week, so I would spend between $140-$200 in 1 1/2 to 2 months.

Make sure to put a lid on the pan (with a gap for steam) because that dressing splatters.

Cheap_Meals,1lz0ek,joker515,2,Sun Sep 8 21:17:08 2013 UTC,"Modified easy Mac: -Any kind of boxed Mac n cheese (works better with something that has Velveeta rather than powdered cheese). Obviously you could just get plain old Velveeta shells or you could shoot for something like Annie's if you're feeling fancy. -Some variant of tomato soup (I get a red pepper and tomato bisque that's really amazing) -Your favorite kind of shredded cheese -Whatever seasonings you prefer Cook the Mac n cheese as instructed on the box. Pour the soup into a separate pan and heat until it's hot, then turn it down to low. When you're done cooking the noodles rinse the starch off them with hot water (colander works best for this). Then begin adding everything. I usually start with the cheese from the box first, then add some soup to thin it out, then a ton of cheese to thicken it, then go back and forth between cheese and soup keeping the consistency nice until I feel it's cheesy enough. Add your seasonings and you have pizza flavored Mac n cheese. If you want to step it up a little, you can cook some cauliflower in a pan with some of the soup and seasonings and cheese while the noodles are cooking, then add that to the final result. I find it works best if you steam the cauliflower (or boil it in a pot) before adding it to the pan so it's not too hard and the consistency works well with the noodles."

I like the potato & cheddar ones. 1/2 head cabbage, shredded. 1/2 yellow onion, cut to leave long strips. 1/2 a firm apple, in small cubes, skin on for the color it adds. 1/2 a polish sausage, cut into slices. Johnsonville is good. Salt, fresh ground black pepper, and about 2 T of cider vinegar.   Heat a LARGE skillet with about 3 vegetable oil to medium high. Toss in the sausage and brown. Add the onions, fry until the onions are about half done stirring regularly. Next, toss in the apple, continue to fry for a about a minute, stir. Toss in the cabbage, mix well, and add the salt & pepper to taste. Allow to fry until the cabbage just begins to gain some translucency, then add in the vinegar and stir well. Cover, remove from heat.  Now, 2nd pan. Heat 2-3 t oil to medium, maybe medium high (I prefer canola / sunflower because they'll smoke less & won't stink up the joint so much). Place the pirogi in the pan, and fry them until they get nice & nutty brown on both sides.   Serve the pirogi with sour cream, and don't forget to give dad a beer if he wants one.   This meal will be less than $15 (not including Dad's beer) and will serve three--and you will likely have enough ingredients to double the batch if needed. Even better? It's almost impossible to screw up if you slice everything before you start the stove. You don't even need non-stick cookware, as the brown crusties from the fried sausage release themselves from the pan when the vinegar is added, giving the added flavor back to the cabbage."

Put the meat in a pot, fill the liquid to about half the height of the meat, get it up to a boil and then cover the pot and throw it in the oven at about 250 long enough to forget about it (at least 3-4 hours, it's almost impossible to over cook a braise).

It's super good, cheap, and incredibly filling.   Another option, is spring rolls. If there's an asian market near you, you can get rice paper wrappers for incredibly cheap (pack of 100 for $1.30). Again you can put anything you want in, but what I do is:  extra firm tofu (sometimes I fry it, but most times I just use it fresh), green onion, sliced ginger, cabbage (I get cole slaw mix for a dollar at Safeway), sweet chili sauce.

A large percentage of people on the Indian subcontinent are completely vegetarian, and many are also poor, so they have developed thousands of tasty (and cheap) vegetarian curries over the centuries.    I don't have a particular recipe recommendation, although this one by Nigella Lawson might be a good place to start if you haven't cooked curry before because she designs recipes to be as quick, easy and tasty as possible.  Most ""authentic"" Indian curries have quite a lot of spices that are probably not cupboard staples for most people, but remember that with curries you can edit out quite a lot of arcane ingredients and still come up with a palatable end result.  After a few tries you can usually just improvise something with the ingredients you have available and generally it will turn out OK.    Also remember that Quorn products, and TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein) can taste quite meat-like while still being fully vegetarian."

Add onions and saute until translucent. Add peppers. Saute for 2 mins. Add garlic and saute for 1-2 mins (be careful not to burn).  Throw in beans, tomatoes, and corn. Add S&P and oregano. (You can use different spices like cumin, chili powder, etc, too.) Heat thoroughly.  Serve over brown rice. I like to eat this with sriracha and a dollop of plain yogurt (cheaper and more nutritious than sour cream).   I also like to wrap this in big, whole grain tortillas and freeze. Makes a great lunch I can grab straight from the freezer and heat up at work.   For a change of pace, I like to replace the black beans with kidney beans and use cayenne pepper or creole seasoning instead of the oregano. I'm sure it would be great with vegetarian ""sausage"" tossed in; a vegetarian spin on Louisiana red beans and rice.

Getting the raw ones will cost you about a buck a pound which ends up being something like 3 pounds of beans after they're cooked. that's a lot considering how filling and hearty they are.  Just follow the instructions on the bag to cook em but generally they take 2-3 hours of simmering with lid slightly off after bringing them to a boil for a minute or so (like rice). you may need to add some water as it boils away if you're doing the whole bags worth. i just put salt in the water, my dad spices the water, you can experiment, there's no one way to do em.  after that use however much you need and store the rest in a tupperware in the water you cooked it in (which by now will have taken on the color of the bean). and cook em whenever you want, in salted water they'll last a long time.  they're versatile, cheap, and tasty. mash some up over low heat with oil. add a little salt and pepper,  garlic powder, and chille powder for an awesome bean dip that's good for dipping or putting on tacos/burritos. add some to otherwise un-filling salads to make them a meal. cook up some onions and tomatoes for a sauce and add beans for a pasta and bean dish.  and experiment!"

Cheap_Meals,1kri9a,frugal_masturbater,8,Tue Aug 20 22:19:27 2013 UTC,"This started as a reply to a request for cheap pasta things to do. I meant to just write a few sentences, then it became a whole big to-do so now I'm making it a little more visible...  A favorite of mine is making a really GOOD pasta sauce, and just vary the pasta you eat with it so it doesn't get boring.  This sauce accomplishes my goal nicely. It's wholesome, hearty and not very expensive to make. It's inspired by Bolognaise sauce, which originates from Bologna, Italy. As folks have pointed out, it is not a true Bolognaise, but it borrows on some of its principles.  This makes 4 servings for way under $10:     2 medium to large size yellow onions 6 medium size tomatoes (cheap, ugly ones) 1lb ground beef (I use the cheap 80/20) 1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste 3 cloves of garlic (some people like 4-5) 2 tsp oregano (some people like 3-4) 1/4 cup olive oil  Salt, Pepper, Sugar to taste      Cut up onions (I cut them to ~1 inch long, 1/8-1/4 wide pieces), fry in a little olive oil until translucent, add a little salt and pepper. Prepare tomatoes: Cut the stems out, cut top and bottom off, slice tomatoes and add to onions. Stir around good one time, then cover and simmer for ~15-18 minutes until tomatoes fall apart. You should have a slushy tomato/onion mix in the pan. While step 2 cooks, in separate pan fry up the meat without adding any oil or grease, use a fork to constantly mash down on the cooking meat so it separates into very small pieces. You really don't want clumps of meat or meatballs, just nice small pieces. Once it's all browned and step 2 has finished (tomatoes/onions are slushy), add meat to the tomatoes (I ladle it to cut the grease from the meat out.)  Take the 4 cloves of garlic and crush them with the broad side of chef's knife (put broad side centered on clove, then give it a good whack with your palm), then throw them into the tomato/meat mix.  Add the tomato paste and 3/4 cup of water to the mix, let it boil, then simmer to reduce the water. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup of water.  Add 2 tsp of oregano, a good amount of salt (I use about 2 tbsp, I think, depends on your taste), and some pepper to taste.  Let it boil again, then reduce it again until you have the desired consistency. It should not be soupy, it should have a consistency that when you put it on top of your pasta, it doesn't just run to the bottom. It should be closer to a paste. It's hard to say when it reduced enough, you still want to see liquid blubbering on top, but you don't want to see a whole layer of water either.   At the very end, add about a tsp of sugar (no more than that) and fish out any large garlic pieces you can spot, cut them up fine and throw them back in. Stir it again and simmer 1 more minute, done.  Top this with shredded mozarella, and you have a kick ass, healthy spaghetti sauce.  Don't use expensive, pretty tomatoes. My local market often sells ""ugly"" tomatoes for very cheap and I can get 6 of them for ~$1.50.   The oregano ""makes"" this sauce. Don't substitute it or skimp on it. Personally I find that 2 tsp is perfect for my taste but I have seen a lot of recipes for Bolognese that use more.  Similarly on the garlic, some folks like it stronger and it does taste good. I balance it against the comfort of my co-workers around me. 3 is a good balance for that.  Some people may be put off by having the tomato skin in the sauce. Personally I don't even notice it, the skin cooks to be very soft. For those bothered, there are methods to remove the skin before cutting up the tomatoes (I think if you toss them into hot water for a short amount of time, they peel easily.)  I'll post a few pictures when I get home after work."

Cheap_Meals,1karmo,GoChaca,7,Tue Aug 13 22:59:32 2013 UTC,"Depends. To be perfectly honest whatever is on sale. I prefer a New York Strip. OF course top o the line is filet Mingon. Top Sirloin goes on sale often and is amazing (do not over cook it)   A little salt is all you need. A truly great steak doesn't need seasonings. Cook on a steel grate and get that sucker hot! Skewer your favorite veggies and cook those as well.   Also, a steak cooks for at least 5 minutes after you take if off the grill so do not overdo it."

Cheap_Meals,1karmo,MurgleMcGurgle,12,Tue Aug 13 23:00:49 2013 UTC,"I would go to a place like Costco to buy a large amount at a cheaper price. You can ask the butcher what to get, or honestly you might as well just look at the packages and grab one with a lot in it. There are different types of steaks, but just pick the cheapest. If you guys are camping I don't think people will be picky about what kind of steak they're having."
Cheap_Meals,1karmo,5oclock_somewhere,8,Tue Aug 13 23:18:07 2013 UTC,Costco's meat never seems to be much cheaper than normal grocery stores unless it's on sale.
Cheap_Meals,1karmo,MurgleMcGurgle,2,Tue Aug 13 20:23:27 2013 UTC,Better quality meat for the same price or slightly cheaper.

If I was on a camping trip with someone that was raised vegetarian and does not necessarily enjoy steaks all that much I would not want to impose or depend on them to bring steaks that I will enjoy.
Cheap_Meals,1karmo,lady_cunninglinguist,16,Wed Aug 14 06:56:28 2013 UTC,"Sounds like you got the short-end of that list. Meat is the most expensive food item you can bring camping, especially for 20 people... You're probably looking at $40 worth of meat or more.  Just buy the cheapest because you're obviously not eating it haha so quality couldn't matter. It's their fault for letting someone who doesn't even eat meat buy their meat products."

Cheap_Meals,1karmo,qemqemqem,2,Wed Aug 14 03:27:46 2013 UTC,"Get some skirt steak and make fajitas. It is one of the cheapest cuts, and it will go a long way if you cook up some beans and rice to go with it. Also, some sliced onions, either raw, cooked or pickled, and maybe some cilantro. Otherwise you will be paying a good deal per pound, and cooking twenty individual steaks will be much more of a pain. Plus, this way you can actually enjoy your own food, just roll one up with everything but the meat. Expecting one person to pay for twenty peoples steaks is kinda nuts!"

Cheap_Meals,1karmo,harajukukei,1 point,Wed Aug 14 03:14:42 2013 UTC,"Thick cut Ribeye is the best cut known to mankind for the BBQ, but it's not cheap.   I would get something like a skirt steak, flap meat, or tritip. Tri-tip is the safe bet if you can get a decent price on it. It grills well over a campfire and is more forgiving to harsh cooking situations.   Does it have to be steak? There are a lot of fun camping recipes out there that are not steak. Hobo packs for example."
Cheap_Meals,1karmo,Zachary9,1 point,Wed Aug 14 06:57:02 2013 UTC,Skirt steak if you're cheap. Ribeye if you want to make people happy. Dry-aged ribeye if you want to make new friends.

Cheap_Meals,1k6njq,PhlegmsMcgee,3,Mon Aug 12 05:59:58 2013 UTC,It's prepackaged rice seasoning and thin pasta according to wiki. If you use just normal rice you make something like an abondiga which is also tasty and can be healthy.
Cheap_Meals,1k6njq,bentwhiskers,3,Mon Aug 12 06:22:18 2013 UTC,"I'm sure you could. Rice a roni is just rice, vermicelli and a seasoning packet (think ramen).

Cheap_Meals,1k64ks,frugal_masturbater,5,Wed Aug 14 18:23:40 2013 UTC,"Oh, I have another favorite of mine I make with leftover pasta:  Throw together various leftovers and fry them up with the pasta, add 2-3 eggs to it, salt and pepper to taste and mix it all up really well.   For instance:   Leftover spaghetti I cut into 2-3 inch long pieces.  Put 3 tbsp butter in a skillet, melt it on medium heat. Cut up some ham slices (aging lunch meat typically, or buy a small ham slice) into cubes. Put spaghetti and lunch meat into skillet, keep on medium heat. If you have some tomatoes to get rid of, cube them up. After spaghetti and ham have cooked for 2-3 minutes, add the tomato cubes and stir. Don't overcook the tomato, you want it a little firm, yet you want to smell the tomato aroma coming from the skillet. Beat 2-3 eggs depending on amount of spaghetti, add salt and pepper to the egg, add to skillet, keep medium heat. Stir constantly until the egg is not runny and sticking nicely to all the noodles. Don't let the egg get too dry! Serve immediately.   This can be made in under 10 minutes, tastes great and is cheap. Great way to get rid of leftovers. Even kids love this.

Cheap_Meals,1k64ks,frugal_masturbater,3,Wed Aug 14 08:27:53 2013 UTC,"A favorite of mine is making a really GOOD pasta sauce, and just vary the pasta you eat with it so it doesn't get boring.  This sauce accomplishes my goal nicely. It's wholesome, hearty and not very expensive to make. It's called Bolognaise as it originates from Bologna, Italy.  This makes 4 servings for way under $10:     2 medium to large size yellow onions 6 medium size tomatoes (cheap, ugly ones) 1lb ground beef (I use the cheap 80/20) 1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste 3 cloves of garlic (some people like 4-5) 2 tsp oregano (some people like 3-4) 1/4 cup olive oil  Salt, Pepper, Sugar to taste      Cut up onions (I cut them to ~1 inch long, 1/8-1/4 wide pieces), fry in a little olive oil until translucent, add a little salt and pepper. Prepare tomatoes: Cut the stems out, cut top and bottom off, slice tomatoes and add to onions. Stir around good one time, then cover and simmer for ~15-18 minutes until tomatoes fall apart. You should have a slushy tomato/onion mix in the pan. While step 2 cooks, in separate pan fry up the meat without adding any oil or grease, use a fork to constantly mash down on the cooking meat so it separates into very small pieces. You really don't want clumps of meat or meatballs, just nice small pieces. Once it's all browned and step 2 has finished (tomatoes/onions are slushy), add meat to the tomatoes (I ladle it to cut the grease from the meat out.)  Take the 4 cloves of garlic and crush them with the broad side of chef's knife (put broad side centered on clove, then give it a good whack with your palm), then throw them into the tomato/meat mix.  Add the tomato paste and 3/4 cup of water to the mix, let it boil, then simmer to reduce the water. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup of water.  Add 2 tsp of oregano, a good amount of salt (I use about 2 tbsp, I think, depends on your taste), and some pepper to taste.  Let it boil again, then reduce it again until you have the desired consistency. It should not be soupy, it should have a consistency that when you put it on top of your pasta, it doesn't just run to the bottom. It should be closer to a paste. It's hard to say when it reduced enough, you still want to see liquid blubbering on top, but you don't want to see a whole layer of water either.   At the very end, add about a tsp of sugar (no more than that) and fish out any large garlic pieces you can spot, cut them up fine and throw them back in. Stir it again and simmer 1 more minute, done.  Top this with shredded mozarella, and you have a kick ass, healthy spaghetti sauce.  Don't use expensive, pretty tomatoes. My local market often sells ""ugly"" tomatoes for very cheap and I can get 6 of them for ~$1.50.   The oregano ""makes"" this sauce. Don't substitute it or skimp on it. Personally I find that 2 tsp is perfect for my taste but I have seen a lot of recipes for Bolognese that use more.  Similarly on the garlic, some folks like it stronger and it does taste good. I balance it against the comfort of my co-workers around me. 3 is a good balance for that.  Some people may be put off by having the tomato skin in the sauce. Personally I don't even notice it, the skin cooks to be very soft. For those bothered, there are methods to remove the skin before cutting up the tomatoes (I think if you toss them into hot water for a short amount of time, they peel easily.)  I'll post a few pictures when I get home after work."

You could also add chicken or ground beef, or canned tuna for something shelf stable.  My food drawer at work might look something like this:  canned soup, a few flavors of knorr sides, small bottle of oil, jar of peanut butter, canned tuna or chicken, crackers.

Cheap_Meals,1jw89k,JustBreathe21,5,Thu Aug 8 17:07:37 2013 UTC,"Bananas are cheap, portable, and easy to find (though at coffee shops or places other than grocery stores a single banana can easily cost more than a whole bunch from a supermarket).  A can of soup (actual can, not an individual plastic serving bowl) is cheap and may have more nutrients than ramen or noodle cup. You'll need a microwave (or a pan and stove), a bowl or mug, and maybe a can opener.  Keeping a jar of peanut butter handy means you can turn an apple and/or some crackers and/or a singly-purchased bagel from the grocery bakery into a filling meal. Unlike hummus or cream cheese, you can store a partly-used PB jar in a desk drawer or backpack.  My grocery store recently started selling individual string cheese sticks in the dairy case, and many convenience stores do this too.  Yogurt is easily purchased by the single cup.  Food co-ops, natural food stores, and some regular grocery stores have bulk food bins where you can buy as much or as little as you like--most relevant to you might be nuts, trail mix, granola, dried fruit, etc. It might take a few tries to get a sense for how much a given volume of something will weigh/cost.  The prepared foods in the restaurant deli are probably going to be more expensive than the above, although as u/bannana says a prepared sandwich there is probably cheaper than a sub shop or non-dollar-menu fast food.  I understand about wanting true single-serve meals w/ no storage and little-to-no advance prep, so I hope my suggestions above fit your situation. That said, if you have the resources for refrigeration and/or a little storage and/or a little advance purchase/prep you will greatly expand your affordable menus (e.g., hard boiling eggs to keep in the fridge for portable eating, buying a 6-pack of yogurt might be cheaper per cup than individually, cooking a more-than-one serving bag of seasoned rice and beans will get you a few meals that could be divided into single-serving containers for at-work microwaving, etc). I understand there are lots of reasons for those options not being feasible, however. If you do have a small storage space and a microwave at work but no refrigeration, my work food stash staples included microwaveable soup, store brand instant oatmeal packets, granola bars or trail mix, peanut butter, crackers, occasional fruit, and a bowl and silverware. Hope this helps!"

Cheap_Meals,1jmxi1,arkanys,1 point,Mon Aug 5 20:24:54 2013 UTC,"The higher acid content is one of the reasons it's great for baking, along with its sour twang.  That same acidity also allows it to freeze more stably than regular milk, for longer storage. It can be handy to freeze into cubes of known volume to easily reheat as needed. (Most cubes are 1/8th of a cup.)  Also good to keep in mind that plain yogurt shares most of the characteristics of buttermilk if thinned. I wouldn't trust it in cake or other fragile baked goods, but it can make a mean pancake when you're out of buttermilk."

Cheap_Meals,1jftip,girls_have_wings,3,Wed Jul 31 20:36:01 2013 UTC,I was thinking about experimenting with steaming the greens for maybe a minute but they held so well after being washed that I didn't want to mess up a good meal.   It all depends on the quality of your green. Eight minutes is a little excessive but maybe a blanch would help with it. I like the crispy nature of it
Cheap_Meals,1jftip,Pfmohr2,1 point,Wed Jul 31 21:14:04 2013 UTC,"Collards tend to hold together pretty well, but 8 minutes might be pushing it.    I'd think a quick parboil might soften them up a bit without making them totally soggy, though."

Cheap_Meals,1jftip,floating_ice,1 point,Thu Aug 1 21:56:34 2013 UTC,"Allow me to stray from the discussion of the recipe for a moment, as this sentence of yours has me baffled:   Due to health safety, two different country produce cannot be sold in the same section.    As a European, I'm used to find produce from a wide variety of countries in the supermarket at any one time. Apples from Italy sittig neatly next to those from France, tomatoes from Spain and the Netherlands touching side by side, potatoes are priced with the note ""check label for origin"" and I might read Poland or Germany or any other country as origin. Same for onions. And plenty others.  As such, I'm a bit puzzled how your supermarkets manage to keep the different varieties apart. I understand there will typically much fewer produce from other countries as the US is large enough to produce most everything with its wide variety of climates - but if there are, for example, pineapples from Costa Rica (is this even a thing?) - would they be allowed next to melons from the US, just not next to other pineapples from a different origin? Or must they sit on a different shelf all by their lonesome? Are fruits or veggies from Mexico allowed to sit next to produce from Canada? You made me truly curious!"
Cheap_Meals,1jftip,floating_ice,1 point,Thu Aug 1 14:13:23 2013 UTC,"Let me try to  clear this up!  Different produce from other countries are allowed next to each other. The reason why tomatoes from mexico and tomatoes from Canada cannot be sold in the same ""bin"" is for pinpointing any food disease outbreaks from a certain country.   I'm assuming that Europe has somewhat of the same food standards throughout the continent . Mexico, canada, dominican republic etc do not.   If there is an enormous amount of the same produce from two different countries, it's not uncommon to see them somewhat close to each other but never next to each other."
Cheap_Meals,1jftip,terroristdactyl,2,Thu Aug 1 19:14:39 2013 UTC,"Ah, okay, that makes much more sense now.   There's no such rule (that I am aware of) in any of the countries I've visited. You'd even find produce from the southern atmosphere (out-of-season strawberries and the like) readily with very late or early local produce of the same kind, no problem. And while we certainly have recalls - I remember a case of high pesticide content for cucumbers last year that even made news -  I guess if any kind of transferable disease would be the problem, they'd just throw out the neighbouring produce as well. Well, hopefully they do :)  Thanks for taking the time to explain."

Also potatoes are rather a filling vegetable compared to others. Some may get filled others may not. My 4'11 stature definitely got filled.  So make it as a side dish or make it as a main that is the power of choice my friend. Others may have to wait till pay day to expand the food on their plates

Cheap_Meals,1jd1xe,lithaborn,2,Tue Jul 30 17:50:06 2013 UTC,"I've built up a good wide store of herbs and spices, thanks to a really cheap market stall nearby and a couple of chinese supermarkets which have sachets of many varieties of curry spices for less than 50p each.  My cupboards are bulging with all kinds of herbs, spices, packets, jars, sauces. It's easy, then, to enhance anything from basic and bland to something special - anything from a baked potato, an omelette or scrambled eggs to roast dinner with all the trimmings.  Buy chickens fresh and whole and butcher them down yourself. Each bird gives you two drums, two thighs, two wings and two breasts which can then be further cut down to the small, inner breast fillet and two outer pieces per breast, basically giving you 12 portions of meat out of one bird.  Learn to kick ass at chinese cooking. Practically everything I've learned to cook has been cheap, filling and wonderfully flavoursome.  An example: One of our favourites, melt in the mouth twice cooked pork.  A small pork roasting joint is maybe £3.50.  Marinate for a while (overnight, couple of hours, or just 20 minutes, up to you) in soy, five spice, honey, mirin, ginger, garlic marinade. Basically this is Hoisin, Chinese BBQ sauce.  Boil it for an hour in just enough water to cover, with a generous splash of soy sauce (£1.20/75cl bottle), some rough bashed fresh ginger (10p per inch, if that) and a couple of star anise (big bag £1, I'd say there's easily 100 in there, so generous overestimate of 1p per star).  Drain & dry, remove any outer layer of fat, then roast for 15 minutes with a glaze of honey & soy.  Serve with egg fried rice, chow mein noodles, chop suey, whatever you want. Absolutely divine and for a family of four, comes in at less than £1 a head."

Here, for example, is one of mine.  And here is a weird but awesome recipe for mac and cheese with carrots and orange juice. No, it doesn't make any sense. Yes, it is delicious."

Cut in half they can be served as a garnish on top of any green soup. (One of the easiest and cheapest ones is probably made with just frozen chopped spinach, stock and a splash of cream.) Make a curry sauce and serve over the eggs and some rice. Make an egg gratin (cover sliced boiled eggs with cream and top with cheese, then bake) -- if you don't mind the calories and fat, that is. Chop them up, add them to mashed potato and some spices or herbs, then fry them like patties. Make a rice/pasta salad or, why not a salad nicoise.  If they're not already boiled; make a shakshuka (a tomato sauce with eggs cooked inside), a bread omelet, eggs baked in peppers, salads with poached eggs...  There are hundreds of things you can do -- eggs are awesome and versatile! Good luck with the rest of the month."

The version I'm familiar with uses a tomato-based sauce with lots of cumin. Basically, you make the sauce, throw in the eggs, and heat through. Cut lengthwise slits in the egg to let the sauce soak in.  There are also dry boiled egg dishes. Stir fry some onions and spices until sweet and fragrant, and throw in the eggs -- again with the slits, and some salt and spices rubbed in. Fry till the outermost layer gets a little rubbery, but the inside is still tender.  Then there's egg biryani, but that's easy to search for."

Cheap_Meals,1j160k,PinkMonkeySlippers,17,Thu Jul 25 15:29:24 2013 UTC,"This is one of my favorite ""egg stretcher"" recipes. It's great for using the few eggs you have left, and cheap because you only need one egg per person.  Recipe:  1 egg per person Pinch of baking soda  For every two eggs you are using:  1 tablespoon butter or margarine 1 tablespoon white all-purpose flour 1 cup milk Salt and pepper to taste (I use 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper)  First, you need to hard boil the eggs. Put the desired number of eggs in a pot and cover with cold water, adding a pinch of baking soda. Bring to a boil uncovered, then as soon as you see it is boiling, cover and remove from the heat. Allow to sit for 15 minutes while you prepare the sauce.  For the sauce, melt the butter or margarine in a pot over medium heat. Quickly whisk in the flour. After a few seconds, whisk in all of the milk and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil for one full minute, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting and whisk in the salt and pepper.  Peel and chop the boiled eggs and add them to the sauce you've made, whisking it in thoroughly. The egg yolks will mostly dissolve into the sauce, giving it a nice golden color. Serve over toast, English muffins, biscuits...whatever!"

It's painful to see a decent recipe marred by the all too prevalent factory farmed, poorly fertilized, force-ripened tomato whose quality is typically so low that it amounts to what is perhaps the single worst degradation of quality of a common food item.

Cheap_Meals,1iygz5,Rose1982,1 point,Wed Jul 24 20:09:03 2013 UTC,"If you can get a bag of frozen veggies (£1 per 1kg in UK), some cooking bacon (84p per 500g) and an onion (£1 per 1.5kg) you can make a respectable stir fry on the very cheap. Fry the onion and bacon in oil till it's nice then add the veg and whatever spices you've got lying around (soy, chilli, garlic, oregano, pepper and thyme are all winners). Cook the ramen at the same time. When the veggies are done mix it all together and eat.  Should be less than £1 per large meal: 200g veg 20p, 2 packs of 12p flavourless ramen, 250g of onion 16p, 150g bacon 24p. ~84p for 800g of good food. If you want it even nicer you can mix in bell peppers, tomatoes, any cheap vegetable really.  One last thing, for the very best deals you should find where your local underprivileged minority shops.

While you are doing this, cook the noodles. Drain the noodles then pile it all in a pan and add siracha and a little extra chicken bullion and some garlic powder.  (note: you can add turkey or roast beef lunch meat instead of chicken)  broccoli and chicken with egg  bring water to a boil, add ramen. If you are using fresh broccoli, add it a few minutes before the noodles, if you are using frozen, add it a minute after the noodles(because the waters temperature will drop and the noodles will stop cooking). Then drain all the water. Add butter to the pan, and an egg (or two) and the chicken (precooked). Sautee until the egg is fully cooked.  Spinach, egg, and chicken. (for frozen spinach, use the frozen broccoli suggestions above)  For fresh, simply cook ramen until almost done, drain. Add butter to the pan, then the spinach, give it a few stirs then add chicken then egg then sautee until the egg is cooked.  After any of these are done, add siracha, soy sauce, chicken bullion, garlic powder or any other seasonings you enjoy to improve the taste."

If you cover it in a bit of the cooking liquid before you freeze and accept that when you defrost/reheat it it'll not be the same consistency as before, awesome - bit more like a stew, but should still be fine. Holds up pretty well in a fridge though - just change the carb (pasta, rice, couscous, potato) that you reheat it with, and it should be awesome."

Cheap_Meals,1iwj9j,racoonpeople,2,Tue Jul 23 22:42:24 2013 UTC,"Pork tenderloin is best as a roast, because cooking it another way tends to make it lose its juices. Wrap it in bacon or glaze it with apricot jam, slow cook it in applesauce with lots of cinnamon, a little nutmeg, some cloves, or a can of pineapple tidbits. Stuff it with wild rice and chopped dried apricots or currants. Stuff it with wild rice and asparagus.   You could also do it on the barbeque with honey mustard sauce, apricot or apple jam, or any BBQ sauce of your choice. Any way you cook that sucker, it'll be good.

Cheap_Meals,1hryf4,italianblue,3,Mon Jul 8 19:57:08 2013 UTC,"They do get mushy, but I always toast my burritos, so this is never a problem for me.  You could also just store the fixin's separately. I often keep a tub of beef'n'beans in the freezer. Hankering for a burrito, I would chip a chunk off, thaw in the microwave, plop onto fresh tortilla, top with cheese or whatever else, wrap'n'roll'n'bake, or eat right away.  If you must prepare them beforehand and due to time constraints can't wait around 20 minutes to fully toast one, pull the pre-made from the freezer, microwave until it starts to steam and sizzle (2-3 minutes?) then shove in the oven on broil (HI) for about 2 minutes. This would combine the best of both worlds and although your burrito wouldn't have a nice, gentle golden brown crisp to it, you'd never be able to tell it was ever a frozen mushy mess."

Cheap_Meals,1hc81u,becomingrain,10,Fri Oct 25 02:18:13 2013 UTC,"If you have a crock pot/slow cooker, you can yogurt with even less fuss, amazingly. These are great instructions, but for something that seems even more like magic try the following:  YOU WILL NEED  -- A crock pot/slow cooker  -- A heavy bath towel  -- Half a gallon (8 cups) of milk  -- 1/2 cup store-bought plain yogurt with live and active cultures  Note on milk: Apparently pasteurized and homogenized is fine, but UHT is not. Probably something to do with what high-temp pasteurization does to the milk proteins. Milk with a higher fat content (whole milk) is easier not to fuck up when you're doing things with heat, but you can make yogurt with any kind of milk.  Note on yogurt starter: Pick something you like, because every brand uses its own mix of cultures that impart slightly different flavors, and that's what your yogurt will taste like. I used my favorite Greek yogurt. Also, once you make your first batch, you can use that as a starter for subsequent batches instead of store-bought yogurt.  DIRECTIONS  1) Turn your crock pot on to low. Add the milk. Cover and cook for 2.5 hours.  2) Unplug the pot. Let it sit, covered, for 3 hours.   3) After 3 hours, use a clean measuring cup to scoop 2 cups of warm milk into a bowl. Whisk the 1/2  cup of store-bought yogurt into the milk in the bowl, then dump it back into the crock pot and stir to combine.   4) Replace the lid of the pot. Keep it unplugged and turned off. Wrap it up in the bath towel to insulate it.  5) Let it sit for about 8 hours. Pretty much overnight. Doesn't have to be exact. I think the last time I did this, I let it sit a few hours longer and nothing bad happened. (It gets slightly more sour the longer you leave it.)  And that's it. Unwrap the towel, remove the lid and-- yogurt!  (Recipe originally from this somewhat crazy slow-cooking blog: http://crockpot365.blogspot.com/2008/10/you-can-make-yogurt-in-your-crockpot.html)"

Cheap_Meals,1hc81u,confusedsoconfused,2,Fri Oct 25 02:22:15 2013 UTC,"let it sit in the fridge for a few days so that any antibiotics and hormones and shit in the milk has had time to calm down   Can you explain more about this? No other yoghurt recipe I've seen has this step, and I can't imagine what this ""calming down"" process might be or how it would affect yoghurt-making.  You missed a potential fuckup: you might want to remind people to keep the milk covered while it's cooling down. Otherwise it's just a nice, warm, inviting landing-spot for air-borne microbes. Of course, this makes the cooling down process take even longer, but life sucks in general.  If people want to try this out but are daunted by the pasteurisation  process, they could have a go using UHT milk (the stuff that's in cartons at room temperature rather than refrigerated). Where I live, this is nearly twice the price of fresh milk (ie. almost as much as yoghurt). Not a great cost-saving, but you can clean the equipment and then skip straight to step 7."
Cheap_Meals,1hc81u,manfly,1 point,Sun Jun 30 09:49:48 2013 UTC,"UHT is kind of caramelized-tasting. Not sure if would want. But the airborne microbes have a period of about ten minutes* to enter the milk after it's stopped being so warm that convection heat lifts them away, and air is much less dense than yogurt. My thoughts on that was that I just wanted to make it yogurts are going to out-compete the other microbes, not that they're going to be the only microbes there.  *figure pulled out of my ass"
Cheap_Meals,1hc81u,manfly,5,Fri Oct 25 02:26:24 2013 UTC,"If you want flavored yogurt, you can add some flavors to the milk after you've boiled it, before you add the yogurt. I usually sweeten it a little with some sugar.  Also, the milk-skin thing that forms over the milk as it cools is used in India to make a sort of clarified butter (called ghee). Not very difficult to make. Small warning - if you mix it into the milk instead of lifting it out, you may taste it in your yogurt later, which you may not like (personally I don't)."

Remove the bones, leaving as much meat behind as you can, then add wide egg noodles and cook until soft.  For two people, you now about 4 meals worth of food for about $10 (~$5 for the chicken, $2 for the celery, $2 for the carrots, and $1 for the onion). You can serve the breasts whole with some sides, slice them up and put it in a salad or pasta dish, etc. The thighs I usually just serve whole with a side (stuffing and frozen veg are cheap).

Cheap_Meals,1h251f,mathan1234,3,Tue Jun 25 21:10:38 2013 UTC,"I do that with pork too, you can usually find a pork butt or roast for pretty cheap, and I throw it in with whatever seasonings I have on hand, cayenne, kickin chicken, garlic, onion powder, pepper. Throw some water in it to get good juices, cook it till it falls apart, then pour it in a skillet, reduce the juices while cooking onions, tomatoes,bell pepper, and jalapeno. Makes it spicy, delicious and usually makes enough to last a couple days.   Once you're tired of that, roll the leftovers with some sour cream in some tortillas, pour on some enchilada sauce, and whatever cheese you've got."

They work well in the slow cooker and are unlikely to dry out. Plus they are cheap.   If you let it cook for the full 8 hours, you will just be able to pull the chicken bone right out of the thighs with no trouble. Then shred everything up."

Don't be intimidated by the ""Buy these spices, then these, and some of those!"" nature of it.

Cheap_Meals,1h251f,Insane_Drako,6,Thu Jun 27 16:14:52 2013 UTC,"I'd suggest to start stocking up on the basics; things like flour, soy sauce, chicken and beef stock, dried spices, vinegars (white, red wine, white wine, rice), tomato-based products (paste, sauce), garlic, ginger root (which can be stored in a freezer for a while) and slowly build it up. Those items usually are pretty affordable and can take a while to get through. We also like rice, and it's so easy to cook once you get the hang of it! (or just make a riz pilaf. So easy, so tasty)  Once that's done, you'll find cooking will be easier and recipes will become more accessible.   We also do our grocery shopping according to the weekly deals! And whatever is on special that week becomes what we cook. Taking risks and learning how to cook will be the biggest money saver you could ever get, and there are a lot of online resources for recipes, techniques, sharing tips, etc.  I hope this helps a bit! If you have a chance, have a look at Cooking Comically, The Pioneer Woman.

Roast em! Cut a mix of veggies to roughly the same size. Toss with oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook them for 20 min at 450. Stir fry! Cut a mix of veggies to roughly the same size. Just be sure to cook whatever protein you separately and add it to the end of cooking the veggies.   Roasting and Stir Fry's are so easy and you can prepare a lot of veggies quickly.   I usually roast broccoli, cauliflower, tomato, mushrooms, onions, peppers, asparagus, or potatoes(which have to be cooked longer).   For stir fry's I use a mix of all of the above and things like snow peas, bok choi, mini corns, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts."

Mix everything in a bowl to create a pancake like batter add more milk if batter is too thick. Pour batter into a skillet. Stir till it browns and crumbles. Eat with jelly or syrup. This recipe is traditionally served with creamed lettuce.  I also found an alternative recipe online:  2 cup flour  2 eggs  1/3 tablespoon baking powder  3/4 cup of milk  1 teaspoon of salt  I did more reading online and it sounds like Germans settlers in the Dakotas made this during the winter time when food was scarce."
Cheap_Meals,1h251f,MurgleMcGurgle,3,Wed Jun 26 17:22:01 2013 UTC,"If you have a slow cooker, then you're in luck. You can often get chicken or pork shoulder or beef roasts for quite cheap. You stick them in the slow cooker with spices and broth and 8 or so hours later you have a healthy delicious meal and leftovers for quite some time.  I recently made about 4lb's of chicken legs in a slow cooker. I put a thin sauce on them then cooked them on low for 8 hours. The chicken fell off the bone when it was done. Make that along with some rice and you have a hearty meal.  Another good one is beans and rice. Top comment in this thread provides one way of doing it, otherwise you can get preseasoned beans and then microwave them and put them on top of beans."

I tend to like things on the salty side and it was a bit much for me. Besides that one though buffalo sauce is a great one. Just mix some hot sauce and chicken broth for it to cook in. You could also use lemon sauce or even just lemons, lemon juice, and chicken broth.  You might even be able to do a thin peanut butter sauce but that could end up messy. I'd recommend going down the seasoning aisle and looking at all the McCormick packets the have."

Essentially you can throw meat and whatever kind of liquid/seasoning into them and 8 hours or so later you have a meal. You can also do noodles and potatoes and beans and all kinds of things in them but I haven't ventured much beyond meats."

Alton Brown's Lentil Soup  It's tasty and very healthy  I like to add frozen chopped spinach, and about halfway through cooking add some diced sweet potato or yams.  Try making your own marinara sauce (if you haven't already), using canned chopped tomatoes.  Once you've done that making chicken parmigiana is really easy.  Another italian dish that is delish and can often be made with what's in your freezer/pantry already is Pasta Carbonara (It means ""coalminer's"")  Here's Emeril's recipe for Carbonara  I included that as a starting point for the dish.  It calls for heavy cream, parmigiana-reggiano cheese, and pancetta or prosciutto, but...  Heavy cream can be left out or you can sub whole milk and some butter.  You can substitute pretty much any hard cheese for the reggiano.  Bacon, or any kind of sausage (fresh or cured, including salami and stuff) substitutes fine for the pancetta/prosciutto.  And I like to add some frozen peas to the mix.  Basically, if you've got bacon, an egg, some garlic, butter or oil, and some pasta, you can make the dish and it will be delicious."

What else can I buy until we get money in 5 days?  Edit: also forgot to add we have a pork shoulder, and a giant bag of [potatoes]   What you have can sustain you for 5 days already, actually. The pork can provide necessary proteins and fats, if you utilize all of it and split it evenly between the three of you, the rice and potatoes can provide starches, which means carbohydrates, meaning you have your macronutrients taken care of.   With the remaining money, you may want to get two things: beans and chicken. Beans, like rice, can be bought very cheap, in bulk, can be stored long-term, and just need water to be edible. Additionally, as veterans of /r/Cheap_Meals will testify, beans and rice are one of the best options for surviving especially financially lean times because not only are they cheap and easy to make, but they provide all essentially amino acids together. Chicken is a very inexpensive meat, which combined with your pork should keep your protein intake up, to balance out the carbs from the rice and beans.   What spices do you have? Do you have any kind of cooking oil like olive oil, lard, canola oil, butter or vegetable oil? With specifics, I could help you plan out specific, healthy, probably-delicious meals for all three of you.   Best of luck, and I think you've come to the right place."

By weight the chicken thighs (skin-on, boneless) were cheaper by a pretty wide margin. The thighs were something like $1.20/lb.

If you can get parsley (dried or fresh), that's a basic herb that can go a long way. (I hope you have salt and pepper!)  Soy sauce. Get a generic bottle.  2 dozen eggs will give you 3 days worth of 2-egg omelets per person (great way to deal with leftovers from the pork). The remaining 6 eggs can be used as ingredients for such things as pork fried rice.  Get a bag of black beans, a bag of onions, 2 heads of cabbage and 2 pounds of carrots for your veggies. 2-3 bunches of bananas will be the frugal fruit of choice. (If they start getting too ripe, peel, chop and freeze them, then puree with some peanut butter or chocolate syrup--see if the dollar store has some--and freeze again to make a mock ice cream that will appeal to every sweet tooth there.)  A jar of salsa and a block of cream cheese (or sour cream) stirred into prepared rice and beans can make an easy and very filling faux-Mexican ""fiesta rice."" The peanut butter (if you bought some) added to the beans and rice another day will make it mock-Vietnamese.  1 pound of sugar is pretty cheap if you don't have any. Use it for tea, coffee, and maybe a dessert or two.  Generic sugar-free Jell-o is very inexpensive and can be a decent dessert option. (Coffee with flavored creamer is another option. Walmart's Master Chef coffee is $2 for a small can, enough for several pots of coffee. Sugar, chocolate syrup and generic non-dairy creamer make a mocha.)  Get some cooking oil if you don't have any (the cheapest and smallest size will do for 5 days), and reserve any and all fat that renders from the pork shoulder for added flavor in other things you cook. Margarine may not be the healthiest spreadable fat, but it is the cheapest option unless there's a sale on lard.

That adds flavor and protein.  And/or buy a big bag of whatever kind of beans you like in cajun beans and rice (dry), cook up a big mess of that.  You should be able to get two or three pounds of beans for well under $5.  If you have enough money to buy a couple onions, a few carrots, and a couple stalks of celery, that is the backbone of really good soup."

You can chop or shred them for breakfast, and make soup, mashed potatoes or rotated potatoes for dinner. They don't need that much seasoning either.

Veggies are part of an optimal diet but when you're on a very tight budget and simply getting a full belly is the goal, they are probably an expense best spared.    I'd be looking at cheap meat (probably some kind of chicken), salt, oil, and dairy (with dairy being the one to drop if you can't afford all) for the next 5 days if I'm OP (since with rice, grits, potatoes they probably have starch covered), and if I don't have money for veggies going forward I'd start growing them."

Two dozen eggs, about $4 here. Grits and eggs or egg biscuits - alternating breakfast ideas, this should be covered.   Depending on where you live...I would get a 2 lb bag of carrots, 2 lbs of onion and a package of celery. This is about $6 here. When you make the pork roast, put carrots, celery, and potatoes under it in the pot. Put onion on top.  Save about a half pound of the pork, cut it up small and add carrots, potatoes, onions, celery, garlic, and rice to make soup. Two dinners down.  A bag of red kidney beans ($1 here) for beans and rice with diced celery and onion.  A gallon of milk (about $3 here) will help make potato soup (& pancakes). You can do a veggie stir fry.  If anything is on sale at your local store, get creative but you can spend another $6.  Chicken thighs are great with caramelized onion...if you happen to have curry powder, curried sliced onion and chicken thighs served alongside cumin carrots and fried chunks of potato would be fabulous and filling. If you have some extra in the end, get something green...a couple cans of green beans would be a great way to fill out the menu.  I realize I skipped lunches, I'm hoping for leftovers to fill some of the gap but you can always grab a package of ramen. Good luck!"

Essentially:   fry up a bunch of diced onion and garlic in some olive oil add tomato paste and canned diced tomato add a can or two of TUNA IN OLIVE OIL (important - do not substitute water pack) add a generous heap of capers add a generous swig of white wine add another swig of olive oil season with sea salt and pepper simmer for a long time enjoy on pasta.

Cheap_Meals,1giv1u,anomalyk,8,Mon Jun 17 18:43:55 2013 UTC,"I like ""salsa chicken."" Easy and tasty and requires essentially no prepwork.  You'll need:   Boneless skinless chicken breasts Taco seasoning (the powder in a packet kind) Salsa (I like Pace chunky salsa because it cooks down really well but any kind will do) Cheese Sour cream if you so desire   Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.   Cover all sides of your chicken breasts with taco seasoning.  Place them in a lightly greased baking dish. I usually go with four breasts in a standard 9x13 but it depends on how many you have to make.  Ladle however much salsa you want onto each chicken breast. I usually go overboard, because I love salsa.   Bake them for 25 - 30 mins.   WHen they're almost done, take them out and sprinkle them with however much cheese you want. Bake for an additional 3-5 mins.  Then you're done. I usually serve it with some rice and mexican style corn.   SO EASY and shockingly good considering everything is pre-made. Sometimes I fancy it up by adding a layer of black bean dip between the taco seasoning and the salsa, sometimes I'll top with guac and/or sour cream.. it all depends on what's on hand.  Good luck!"

Cheap_Meals,1g6lul,upward_bound,3,Wed Jun 12 18:15:46 2013 UTC,"Mexican rice is actually easy to make the regular way.  Heat 1-2 Tbsp of oil in pan.  Add 1 cup of rice, dice onion (1 small, or 1/2 medium) and brown for a few minutes.  Just make sure not to burn the rice.  This step is what makes the rice not stick.  Transfer the rice to either a pot or rice cooker.  Add liquid (this depends on what you normally do, but I would do 1.5 cups of liquid)  The liquid should be mostly water (2/3rds is a good start), some tomato sauce (1/3rd is a good start), and seasoning.  Seasoning can be bullion cubes (2), your own mixture, or something like Knorr tomate.  Anyway just cook the rice down (stove top: bring to boil, lower to simmer for 15 minutes covered.  Remove from heat and leave covered for at least 5 minutes:: Rice cooker: Push the button)  Once you've got this down (it's really easy, but after a few times you'll figure out how you like it (maybe more sauce and less water, maybe less sauce and more water, maybe added seasoning or garlic) you can experiment with adding other things to it.  Black beans, frozen corn, and left over vegetables all work well.  Edit: Long Grain Rice"

Cheap_Meals,1fuywg,Oafah,22,Fri Jun 7 13:29:52 2013 UTC,"Is it packed in oil or water?  Either way, mackerel's an oily fish (13g per serving! wow), so it'll probably be best to have it with lighter things. The obvious thing is on top of salad, but that's boring.    Tuna Salad  I like tuna salad because it's only a salad by name, and canned mackerel can be used like canned tuna. You can put it into sandwiches, pita wraps, on top of a real salad, etc. The way I always make tuna salad that incorporates cheap ingredients is to add chopped celery/broccoli, some raisins/craisins, and bread crumbs/torn up bread (helps soak up a lot of the water coming out of celery), and a binder (eggs, mayo, salad dressing - whatever).  I sometimes make ""salad wraps"" with either romaine or iceberg, where I spoon tuna salad into a lettuce ""bowl"" and eat it like just like that. You're getting a good amount of vegetables, protein, and slight amount of carbs in it, too. Excellently balanced, and very easy to make/store/bring.     Pasta Sauce  Alternatively, you can break it up and put it into a sauce for pasta. It's probably plenty salty/oily, so you can make your own red sauce from tomato paste (rather than buying whole jars of Newman's Own, or something). Cook your penne until almost ready, and then toss it into the sauce on heat for a few minutes before eating to really incorporate the flavor into the pasta. This freezes really well.  You can also make a kind of carbonara-style dish by flaking the fish, frying it a bit, and then sautee-ing it with some tomatoes, herbs, and olive oil in spaghetti.     Finally, it doesn't really fall into a category, but eggplant goes really well with rich oily foods like fish. It makes all ingredients taste richer, without adding more calories (it's a vegetable, afterall).   You can make ""deviled eggplant"" quarters/halves with scooped out eggplant, fish, and chopped black olives (also canned) tapenade-like filling, and then re-add it into the eggplant shell.  You can also bake the fish directly onto thick eggplant medallion slices. Since these two things cook at different rates, half-bake the eggplant first, then finish off by adding the fish in whole chunks and then finishing the baking process."

Cheap_Meals,1fuywg,crinberry,5,Fri Jun 7 15:42:29 2013 UTC,"Adding to the salad idea: I use canned sardines, but same concept for mackerel. I assemble a bowl of mixed spring greens (more vitamins/protein than just romaine), dump the can of sardines on top. Then here's the important part: add flavorful toppings with varying textures: garbanzo beans (or kidney beans) for more protein, canned corn or fresh raw corn cut right off the cob, thinly sliced red onion, chopped sweet peppers, diced cucumber, chopped scallions, chopped tomato, chopped carrots, craisins/raisins, any other crunchy veg. Squeeze a lemon over everything and lots of fresh ground pepper. Eat with some wheat toast. I like adding spicy pickled carrots or jalapenos too, because the acidity cuts/complements the richness of the fish."

It's probably not the same in Canada, but still check in the fresh section as well if you can- here in the UK they've got delicious smoked mackerel, and places like Sainsbury's and Tesco even have their ""basics range"" version that is still incredible.  That being said, the mackerel I haven't just picked at until its disappeared, I just toss onto a salad.  It's summer and time for salads. Greens, olives, tomatoes, white cheese, and mackerel do just fine for me. I'm not a fan of salad dressing, but I think the oil in/around mackerel could probably function as one if you're into that. Oh, also pumpkin seeds. The green ones. They go great with mackerel in salad.  Also, if you like mackerel, pick up some kippers if you happen across them for cheap."

Cheap_Meals,1ffh6h,aManPerson,7,Sat Jun 1 02:52:35 2013 UTC,"Yeah. But, oil could get into the eggs too if they are constantly submerged, turning the shell soft. It would be more benefical to just lightly coat the and leave them in the fridge. You could re coat them every week if your feeling fancy.  Also, a way to check if your eggs are bad or not is the buoyancy test. Submerge them in water, if they lay flat on the bottom they're good. If they float to the top they're no good. And if there's somewhere in between they are still good but will be going bad with the week."

I grow lettuce and enjoy it because of the fresh/convenience factor-- I always have lettuce on hand, and I don't have to plan carefully so it doesn't go bad (it stays in the ground until I need it, so I never have to worry about it going bad).  Also, I am just feeding one person (me, not a family), so if I only want a few leaves of lettuce that week, I don't have to buy a whole head and be like ""shit, gotta make some massive salads so this doesn't rot in my fridge"".  Also, if you want to make a dish that uses a massive amount of basil (like pesto-- you need several cups, not just a few sprigs), growing it is the way to go!"

Cheap_Meals,1fdcuy,soozafone,27,Thu May 30 23:41:00 2013 UTC,"It's an excellent way to add variety to salad.  You can also stir-fry some with a bit of sugar and some kind of bitter greens like rabe (broccoli works, too) and that makes it a good addition to some kind of starch (pasta, rice, potatoes).   Go southern with collard greens (turnip, spinach, kale, even lettuce) by boiling it with some salty meat.  Meat+cheese melts as sandwiches.   You can french-toast the bread, really grill it so it's crispy, and then dunk it in maple syrup for some kind of croque-monsieur.  Wrap it around half-cooked asparagus/string beans and grill (or pan-cook) it.  Finally, you can put the ham to a pot of boiling water."

Some recipes include a bit of flour (this makes them more squishy) but I prefer the simple, crunchier variety with some raisins and dark chocolate chips. Mmm.  Most basic recipe is: 120g oats, 40g sugar, 40g butter/margarine and and 4 tbsp of golden syrup.  Melt the butter in a pan Add the sugar and syrup.  Add the oats Smooth into a tin. Bake on medium for about 30 min or until it seems done. Let it cool, slice then enjoy.  I'm sure google will have something more interesting.

Just put the fruit cocktail with the cottage cheese in small containers (I like to reuse lidded yogurt cups), pour the boiled jello in, stir and let set in the fridge.   For about $1 a day (work 5 days a week) I have a great dessert that isn't too unhealthy, and I can vary the flavors pretty easily.

Cheap_Meals,1f0lx0,soupguy,13,Sat May 25 05:24:03 2013 UTC,"Ingredients  4 Medium Tomatoes (add one yellow tomato to add a splash of color in your dish)  1 loaf of Bread, or 1 French baguette  2 tbsp. Balsamic Vinegar  2 tbsp. Light Olive oil  8 Fresh Basil Leaves, chopped  1 Garlic Clove  1 pinch of Salt  1 pinch of Pepper  Instructions  First, preheat the oven to 300 Fahrenheit. While the oven is getting hot, chop your tomatoes into small little cubes and put them in a bowl.  To chop your basil, a useful tip is to put your basil leaves in a glass and use kitchen scissors to cut them in small tiny pieces- this way they don’t get all over your kitchen floor.  Mix the tomatoes with the fresh basil.  Add 2 tablespoons of light olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.  Add a thin layer of salt and pepper and mix the whole together.  Using a knife, slice your bread into ¼ - ½ thick slices. Line a baking sheet with foil and lay the slices about an inch apart.  Once the oven is preheated, turn it up to 350 Fahrenheit and place your bread inside. For a browner crust, lightly apply a layer of light olive oil to the bread prior to baking.  Once lightly browned, remove the bread from the oven and scoop the tomato mixture on top of each slice of bread.  Serve immediately in order to keep the delicious crispiness. Otherwise the bread can quickly turn into a soggy mess!  Just published on CollegeRecipes.com: http://collegerecipes.com/recipes/the-italian-bruschetta/"

Cheap_Meals,1ey2ni,dalidala,14,Fri May 24 02:23:23 2013 UTC,"More info: This is one of my all-time favorite meals, and it's super easy and fairly cheap. Right to left, it's potatoes and carrots, kielbasa, onion and cabbage. I add a clove of garlic, some salt and pepper, some olive oil, and some spice I got on sale that's lasted forever, but honestly any spices you like would probably work with it.  The batch in the first picture is two potatoes (I buy a bag for about $3, so about 50 cents), a few leaves of cabbage (about 20 cents), 4 carrots (about 40 cents), 3 cloves of garlic (maybe a quarter), half an onion (30 cents), and half a package of kielbasa (I buy mine for about $2, so $1). I grow my own chives (stupidly simple), so those were free.   Chop everything about the same size (start with the potatoes and carrots, since they'll take longer). The kielbasa is already cooked, so no need to worry about anything but heating it up. Toss the ingredients with spices and oil, then fold them up in foil and sit on a tray (you could put all the ingredients in one packet too, just chop the potatoes and carrots smaller). I put the oven at about 400 degrees F and it cooks for about 40 minutes to an hour (it just depends). Just watch it.  I garnish mine with tons of chives, and it has onion, and I use 3 cloves of garlic, AND the spices are garlic. Adjust to your tastes (you nancy boy).  TL;DR: A large serving costs me about 70 cents, but even in other areas of the country it shouldn't be more than a dollar or so."

Cheap_Meals,1ey2ni,pwnguin909,6,Fri May 24 13:28:58 2013 UTC,"Not trying to be that guy, but just for the sake of clarification, those look to be scallions and not chives.  Just want people who love good food to know what they are using.   Scallions are often called chives, but they are a bit different in terms of flavor, texture, and uses. As an added bonus chive flowers are delicious and purple.  Your post made me hungry and now I want kielbasa and I don't have any. Never a kielbasa around when you need one... ಠ_ಠ"
Cheap_Meals,1ey2ni,Smilotron,2,Fri May 24 18:56:53 2013 UTC,"Excellent idea! I'll be trying it this weekend. Kielbasa is a little more expensive here but still relatively cost-efficient, so I think this would make a great weekend dinner with some steamed brown rice. I might sub out the cabbage for seasonal squash. :)"

If your feeling like doing the work, use a peeler to shave carrot into it too, but honestly that Apple vinegar and mayo dressing makes plain cabbage taste gourmet. It's the kind of slaw that you can put on top of Buffalo chicken or pulled pork, in the sandwich, and it tastes better."

Boil water, pour over your oats in the thermos, seal. Take it to work. Oats will be ready to eat in ~25 min. YMMV with this method, depending on your preferences for oatmeal texture. If you like very well-cooked, mushy oats, this is not the method for you.

It's a good way to stock up on niceties not necessities. They also have a promotion where you buy the brand name and they give you their house brand free. They accept competitors coupons including target too. I wasn't a crazy coupon lady, but by watching the sales I never paid more than a quarter for what I bought.

As far as what to buy, obviously beans and rice and oats are going to be helpful, look for the cheapest in-season vegetables and fruit available in the area, and budget your food very specifically.   Depending on your weight, you'll need at least 1200 calories a day to maintain bodily functions, along with certain macronutrients and micronutrients. Make sure you get at least three 400 calorie meals per day, every day, along with plenty of water. Try not to be too active. Don't sit in front of a computer all day, but also don't run three miles a night and lift weights, because those burn calories you can't afford to spend. You can do all of that when you get back on your feet.   Look for services for people in need, because that's you now. Look for food banks, look into food stamps, look for neighborhoods that have fruit trees in their front yards, and maybe talk to people who work at markets that throw out old but still good food at the end of the day.

Frozen vegetables might also be cheap and will add some nutrients to what you eat. With the sauce, you could possibly freeze some of it in portion sizes, so you don't have to worry about it spoiling and it will give you some restraint in rationing.  I'm assuming that you would probably already have a little bit in your cupboard/freezer. You could sort stuff into what you should eat now and what can be saved for later. (For example, you should concentrate on eating anything fresh that you have first so it doesn't go to waste. Any canned goods can be eaten throughout the next 3 months.   Don't pass up any opportunity that someone gives you to eat for free. Do your parents ever invite you for dinner? Friends might invite you over for food and movies for example.

Ok, here's the thing-- you don't have to go out and buy stock. Animal-based stock is made by boiling down carcasses (bones and bits) left over from other cuts of meat. So the next time you have a roast chicken or something, don't throw out the bones! Throw em in a pot of water and simmer them for an hour or two. Let cool, strain the chunky bits out, and voila! The simplest stock. Just needs salt and spices of your choice.  For bonus points, add things like onion ends and carrot tops to the brew while it's boiling. Heck, you don't even NEED bones to make stock-- leftover veggie bits make a fine stock on their own."

Cook until beans are soft, add salt (a bit at a time, tasting as you go, until it's just right. You'll need a lot, but too much ruins everything. Write down how much you used and just chuck that amount in next time).  Get the cumin and oregano from some kind of ethnic store where you get like a pound for the same price as those tiny jars in the supermarket.  This will taste great, but can be embellished further.  I also use chili powder (this means different things in different countries: In the US it might be a mixture of cumin, ground hot pepper and oregano; here it's just the ground hot pepper). Thyme works instead of oregano and we have that growing out back so it's free. A can of tomatoes can do no harm, but don't add it until the beans are soft because the acid can keep them hard.  Especially in North America, it's popular to throw in any bits of pig you have: meat, fat, bones, bacon. I actually prefer not to, but whatever floats your boat.

Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,sirhelix,2,Thu May 16 15:34:04 2013 UTC,"I'm going to try asafetida next time I cook beans or lentils.  It's supposed to be popular in india and helps flavor and digestion.  Also, I've read recently, not to add any tomato product until the beans are done, as the acid keeps them from cooking completely in my chili."

Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,sirhelix,2,Thu May 16 21:06:02 2013 UTC,"salt and or boullion cubes/chicken stock.  a favorite recipe of mine is  black beans, red onion, cilantro, tomatoes.  after the beans are cooked, drain some liquid out and toss in the fresh veges.  the heat will wilt/lightly cook the veges.  great flavor.  you need some liquid still with the beans because as they cool they will suck liquid back up.  if you drain all the liquid out while they are still hot, the next day they will seem dry."

Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,peanutweewee,2,Fri May 17 02:49:07 2013 UTC,"Here is something I wrote a few years back that would apply to bean dishes also.   French:  Carrots, Onions, Leeks, Celery, Thyme and Bay leaves  Called Mirepoix: Saute in a bit of butter 3/4 cup carrots, 1/2 cup onions and 1/4 cup celery. 3/4 cup lean ham is often added. For seafood dishes, eliminate the ham and replace the carrot with leeks.   Italian: Onions, Carrots, Mushrooms, Celery, Basil, Parsley and Garlic  Saute in olive oil until browned 1 cup onions, 1/2 cup carrots, 1/4 cup mushrooms, 1/4 cup celery, herbs and 2 cloves garlic. Used with meats and basis for sauce. 4 cups pureed tomatoes is often added.  Spanish: Yellow Onion, Sweet Green Chile (like Anaheim), Garlic, Tomatoes and Paprika  Saute in a bit of olive oil until browned 1 cup onions, 1 chile, 1 clove garlic. Add 4 cups chopped tomatoes and 1 heaping Tablespoon paprika.  Mexican: Yellow Onion, Bell Peppers, Chiles, Garlic, Tomatoes  Saute in a bit of corn oil until browned and blistered, 1 cup onions, 1 cup bell peppers, 1 hot chile, 1 clove garlic. Separately broil 4 tomatoes until blackened. Place tomatoes in a brown paper bag and close it. Let the tomatoes sit for five minutes. Remove tomatoes from bag and peel off the skin. Crush the tomatoes and add to the sauteed vegetables. If making a sauce from the vegetables, puree. Often served with cilantro.  Cajun: Green Bell Peppers, Onions, Celery and Flour  Called the Trinity: Saute in a bit of butter 1 Bell Pepper, 1 onion and 2 stalks of celery. When the vegetables are browned add 2 Tablespoons of flour and allow it to brown lightly. Use for gumbo and with braised meats and vegetables.  As you can see, with just a handful of staple vegetables you will have the basis for several different cuisines. With each of these types of sofritos you can make them ahead of time in larger quantities and just measure out one cup of the sofrito into each freezer bag. Label it and date it. Then you will have handy, versatile starters to many recipes.  Keep the following vegetables on hand and you can always throw these together with a few spices:  carrots onions leeks celery mushrooms green chiles garlic tomatoes bell peppers"

Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,Big_Yellow_Joint,2,Thu May 16 12:43:00 2013 UTC,Salt!  It takes way more salt than you initially want to add. But do it. Insta-flavor.
Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,autovonbismarck,1 point,Thu May 16 12:14:53 2013 UTC,You don't want to over-salt though... Its better to make slightly under-salted beans and then add more salt to them  when I ladle a plate out.
Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,pwnguin909,2,Fri May 17 01:36:05 2013 UTC,"What I do is cook the beans without salt until about 5 minutes before they're done, then salt the water as if I was cooking pasta. If they still need more salt it can be added afterwards.  I don't often eat beans on their own anyway; they usually make their way into various sauces which are then adjusted for flavor."

Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,alizrien,1 point,Thu May 16 11:41:51 2013 UTC,"My best advice is to experiment with spices and look up a ton of recipes to get an idea of spice combinations. If you can get some cheap spices from the bulk isle section at the grocery store. What I use most to cook just about anything that is quick and easy includes: cumin 1 part, paprika 1 part, coriander .5 part, a dash a cinnamon with salt and pepper to taste."

Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,jdepps113,1 point,Thu May 16 13:12:27 2013 UTC,Cook them with salt pork. Be sure to remove the salt pork after cooking.
Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,jdepps113,1 point,Thu May 16 15:41:33 2013 UTC,"Depends on the use. If you're going for something Mexican or similar, you can add cumin, paprika, and/or chili powder. It's tasty with any or all of those. Also, red pepper flakes can be good! I also cook them with onions, garlic, and/or corn sometimes."
Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,dalidala,1 point,Thu May 16 16:00:33 2013 UTC,"This isn't really cheap but I feel I should add it. Whenever I make beans for a BBQ I fry bacon in the pot and when the fat starts to liquify I start add brown sugar and some onions. Once that's all browned and awesome I add the canned beans and chopped bratwurst, then mix it all up. I let it simmer for 45 minutes or so and it's good to go."
Cheap_Meals,1efxdc,lalaowai,1 point,Thu May 16 16:02:50 2013 UTC,"Chicken or beef stock (or bouillon cubes), kielbasa, ham, bacon, onions, garlic, brown sugar in chili, tomatoes, cajun seasoning, and a little bit of basil or oregano in the right stuff."

Add in some chopped onions, some bacon (you actually don't really want to chop it up, the texture is weird in the beans so I just fish it out afterwards and give it to the dog), a lot of garlic, Goya Sazon and Adobo seasoning, and maybe some extra cumin. Then let it cook until the flavors blend together, the onions are soft, and the sauce thickens up a bunch. They should end up very flavorful and incredibly good."

They are made in the same manner as beans in the crock pot, just make sure you soak them well and change the soaking water twice Then cook with a half onion and diced garlic to taste in the crockpot.  I also eat my crock pot beans with a few small cubes of cheese (monterey jack is the one I prefer). If you try the cheese, wait until your beans are bit cooler or else you will end up with a melted cheese soup."
