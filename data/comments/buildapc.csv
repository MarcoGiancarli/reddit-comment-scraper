buildapc,3e16h7,crushcastles23,2414,Tue Jul 21 04:05:37 2015 UTC,"I work in a shop that cleans hundreds of computers a week and I see and have to deal with a lot of anti viruses. This is the general consensus on the internal forums of popular AVs.  McAfee - Literally a virus. This is the most pre-installed anti virus software out there. Common problems with this AV include the inability to access the internet through browsers, decreases in performance, especially browser performance if the McAfee extension is installed, and Operating System file corruption.  Norton - An AV good at detecting viruses with everything going against it. Norton is pretty good at scanning and removing viruses. The pros stop there. When norton expires, it deactivates it's real time web protection which also stops your internet from working. I have seen it use more than 50% of system resources when scanning and can idle at 10%. The uninstaller rarely works on systems that have had norton on them for a while. Comes with a lot of its own adware like useless password managers and backup software. The backup software will often back up your computer to itself filling your HDD.  AVG - not very good at protecting you from viruses. Huge startup impact. Uses a fair amount of system resources. Often requires removal tool to get rid of it. Corrupts system files often. Never wants to update itself.  Avast - Has a good basic virus scanner. For some reason, more blue screen issues are caused by avast than any other anti virus. If you're having BSOD issues or issues with drivers or programs that are unexplained, it's usually avast.  Hitman Pro - This AV (scan and remove only) has an insane detection and removal record. If no other anti virus can fix your computer, and you really don't want to reformat, Hitman Pro is the scanner to go with.  Malware Bytes - Very good at finding and removing browser malware and less serious malware and infections. Very good at cleaning out infections like Search Protect and Trovi. No the best at getting rid of more serious infections. Warning, this will usually delete all of your internet cookies.   Trend Micro - Causes weird issues with program installs and drivers. Real time protection can disable internet access if it screws up. If this av is causing problems it usually has to be removed with a removal tool. Not the best detection rates.  Kaspersky - Updates take forever. Huge startup impact. Very good detection with virus scanner. Pretty heavyweight and uses a lot of system resources. Worst password protector/manager ever created bundled with basic software.  Webroot - Extremely lightweight with very good detection. Uses at most 3% of your computer's resources. Probably the only AV that doesn't seem to cause OS or internet issues. Does not pop up asking you to buy things, doesnt come with any stupid addons. Probably my favorite AV for people who want a third party AV. Good for gamers and power users.  Windows Defender - All you really need. Since hitting ""Yes"" to install ShopFromHome and Search Protect on that youtube download installer will bypass any anti virus, there's really no reason to spend money on a third party antivirus if you're smart enough to not click on these things in the first place.  Avira - Fairly light weight AV. Probably the best free AV out there if you don't mind xing out of the add every day. I usually install this on family computers if they're prone to getting infections.  Editing some common questions down here...  For Macs - I would go with something lightweight since Macboook airs and the new Macbook don't have the system resources of your typical windows computer.  Microsoft Security Essentials - See Windows defender as they are closely related.  Bitdefender - I haven't used this AV very much at all so I can't comment on it.  TL;DR: Free - Avira, google disable ad. Paid - Webroot all the way, especially for gamers and macs. Advanced Users can often get away with just Windows defender, maybe install and run mwb every 6-12 months."
buildapc,3e16h7,NOT_AN_APPLE,281,Tue Jul 21 06:31:11 2015 UTC,What is your experience with ESET NOD32?
buildapc,3e16h7,ChrysisX,90,Tue Jul 21 07:32:41 2015 UTC,ESET's great in my opinion. The guy I do part time work for sells it. Regularly tops detection rates (havnt checked in a while) and it's light weight with a good interface.
buildapc,3e16h7,SamSkellSkell,13,Tue Jul 21 08:18:42 2015 UTC,"Ran it at an enterprise level across about 6,000 workstations and had a pretty excellent experience. Coming from McAffee it cut our virus/malware tickets down by like 75%. The remaining were typically just nuisance software like ask toolbar that wasn't really malicious."
buildapc,3e16h7,Toribor,153,Tue Jul 21 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"I've only installed one on a business machine so I don't know if it's common for business AV, but being able to password protect the settings is great for stopping employees from fiddling."
buildapc,3e16h7,SamSkellSkell,20,Tue Jul 21 19:01:10 2015 UTC,"I've had a pretty good experience with NOD32. I used it for 3 years, and installed it for a few friends when they were having virus troubles. As far as I know it cleaned up pretty well, didn't impact performance very much and felt light weight (I didn't check exact values and I have pretty good specs so I can't be sure).  It definitely didn't have the same sluggish feel as McAfee and Norton."
buildapc,3e16h7,vanguard_DMR,5,Tue Jul 21 08:14:21 2015 UTC,"As an engineer that long ago sold NOD32 at a certain medium computer store, I wholeheartedly agree. THey have long been a great vendor. Aside from the recent (~2years) change in their renewal policy pricing they have been hands down the most effective solution I've seen to date."
buildapc,3e16h7,Rockshurtmyhead,39,Tue Jul 21 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"Their online scanner is really good too. I use it on every machine I service, even if it isn't getting ESET in the end. Just a quick and effective virus scan."
buildapc,3e16h7,SamSkellSkell,19,Tue Jul 21 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"It sounds weird, but from the way everybody is talking about ESET it sounds like OP doesn't know a ton about it because it does it's job effectively and the PCs rarely need to be taken in."
buildapc,3e16h7,GigaGrim,10,Tue Jul 21 17:04:55 2015 UTC,+1 for NOD32. Been using it for years now. Lightweight and does a good job.
buildapc,3e16h7,shadyjim,17,Tue Jul 21 12:29:12 2015 UTC,"Been using ESET NOD32 for ~8 years. It is the best I have seen, in my opinion. Lightweight, easy to use and great detection/removal rates. Always see it ranking high in AV comparisons. I have tried the generic free to use AV's like AVG, Avast. I used Norton for a bit. But ESET blows them out of the water. Combine that with Malwarebytes + CCleaner scans every week or so and you are golden. Occasionally I'll use Spybot too but I am not liking their new cluttered interface and resource hogging.   ESET + Malwarebytes + CCleaner is something everyone on Windows should be using regulary."
buildapc,3e16h7,alteck,18,Tue Jul 21 18:23:33 2015 UTC,Loyal ESET user here for the past ~10 years.  Won't use anything else.  Don't even notice it's there.
buildapc,3e16h7,trizzleatl,15,Tue Jul 21 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"I work in IT and ESET is generally considered one of the best, if not the best (depending on year) general AV solution. We love it and I highly recommend it!"
buildapc,3e16h7,AlverezYari,35,Tue Jul 21 14:26:47 2015 UTC,I love it!  I'm using it right now and it hasn't failed me once!  It also has a gaming mode where it uses less CPU etc.
buildapc,3e16h7,ankrotachi10,40,Tue Jul 21 11:09:33 2015 UTC,We don't sell it and I haven't seen it on many computers so I can't say much.
buildapc,3e16h7,NOT_AN_APPLE,30,Tue Jul 21 07:51:20 2015 UTC,"That's weird, I thought it was one of the most popular antiviruses."
buildapc,3e16h7,mrthbrd,5,Tue Jul 21 13:15:22 2015 UTC,I also do work similar to /u/Not_an_apple and I have to say that I love ESET not just for it's high detection rate but it has a mini built in training course you can take.  I put this on some friends and family machines and made them take the training course and I've received a lot less phone calls and questions asking to help clean their computer.
buildapc,3e16h7,justwantDota2,19,Tue Jul 21 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"I love my ESET, I wouldn't go with any other av"
buildapc,3e16h7,daten-shi,5,Tue Jul 21 18:31:23 2015 UTC,"My quick/first assumption; I would guess because it isn't highly commercialized and the popularity is amongst those most informed and know their way around pc hardware/software, those folks most likely are better at troubleshooting their own machines and less likely to take it into a place for them to do it for them."
buildapc,3e16h7,burtedwag,4,Tue Jul 21 14:14:36 2015 UTC,It's Google's own antivirus of choice for all its employees.
buildapc,3e16h7,ginsunuva,8,Tue Jul 21 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"Been using it almost forever now. It's amazing. Almost no false positives or negatives, lightweight but strong, constantly updating and occasionally is updated before other anti viruses."
buildapc,3e16h7,YoureDown,3,Tue Jul 21 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"I also use ESET and I love it, its easy on the resources and keeps my pc clean as a whistle"
buildapc,3e16h7,FunkyUnky,60,Tue Jul 21 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"It does well on my Antivirus Composite Score.  Last year it was 2nd best.  The year before that, it was best.  It's still good."
buildapc,3e16h7,LNMagic,37,Tue Jul 21 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"You can stop Avira's ad executable from running by chucking it in the blocked .exe list in gpedit. Google for more info.  I wouldn't install/keep running any antivirus, a properly configured firefox with ghostery/adblockedge/noscript and running malwarebytes whenever something feels wrong is a much much more effective way of deaing with any problems."
buildapc,3e16h7,ex0-,27,Tue Jul 21 07:51:39 2015 UTC,I didn't know that you could disable the ad. That's pretty handy.
buildapc,3e16h7,NOT_AN_APPLE,13,Tue Jul 21 07:56:34 2015 UTC,"Avira doesn't take much resources, you usually don't even recognise it's running. It's a nice addition to noscript. Not every virus comes through your browser.  The best AV still is the human brain. Don't klick the ""freemoney.exe"" in that .ru email."
buildapc,3e16h7,leave_it_blank,4,Tue Jul 21 08:23:25 2015 UTC,"Whew, I clicked on ""freemoney.msi"" from .cn. That's Canada, right? Bunch of good guys is what I hear."

buildapc,3e16h7,windrixx,15,Tue Jul 21 16:43:19 2015 UTC,+1 for webroot. Best AV I've ever used.
buildapc,3e16h7,ImaginaryHearts,17,Tue Jul 21 07:47:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I have been extremely impressed by Webroot. Super lightweight, but very reliable at blocking threats (in the almost 2 years I've been using it)"

buildapc,3e16h7,jusu,5,Tue Jul 21 17:44:15 2015 UTC,I use F-secure. One of their executives did a very good AMA some time ago and he seemed to really know his stuff.
buildapc,3e16h7,BaffledPlato,90,Tue Jul 21 18:18:52 2015 UTC,Must have been Mikko Hyppönen. He's on the game and in Reddit too.
buildapc,3e16h7,jusu,82,Tue Jul 21 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"You didn't mention one big player, Bitdefender. I have been using it for a few years now and it's pretty good. The premium software is quite resource intensive but also quite efficient. I have used premium but don't need it (Common Sense, I guess) so instead, I use Bitdefender free and this is also pretty good. It's light weight and not resource intensive. It catches malware pretty quick. Only problem I have with the free edition is that it crashes and quits when I play some AAA games. But I guess that's because of the RAM limitations of my system.   Overall, it's my go-to AV for new new Windows installs. This, alongside Malwarebytesis pretty much all any user would need."
buildapc,3e16h7,BITF14A508,32,Tue Jul 21 09:22:58 2015 UTC,"Bitdefender is a solid AV, but it has some shady practices that I am not a fan of.  First of all they advertise their products as ""yearly"" to try to get you to upgrade every year, even when you still have a valid license. The license can be upgraded to the new year for free, but it is not well advertised.  Secondly, and the most important thing. They don't have an easy way to end the subscription. The only way I could find to stop the $80 auto-subscribe fee is to submit a ticket to support, wait for their response, have them try to sell me on it, then respond and a day later or so they will end the auto-resubscribe. They wait until 7 days before you are automatically hit with the auto-resubscribe fee, and the process takes 2-3 days to unsubscribe. So if you delay at all you are at risk of the payment going through.  Unsubscribing should not be a ""support ticket"" issue."
buildapc,3e16h7,Dysalot,9,Tue Jul 21 13:22:12 2015 UTC,"I had a major issue with this.  I bought it for a year, and then at the end of the year I switched to another AV.  BT charged me again.  I told them to refund me.  They refused.  I told my bank to chargeback.  They refused.  Long story short it took me almost 6 weeks of fighting to get my money back.  BitDefender are criminals.  Fuck them."
buildapc,3e16h7,Jessie_James,5,Tue Jul 21 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"Just for future reference, use a credit card for these types of purchases. Your bank doesn't really care who takes your money, but with a credit card, the company is taking Visa's/MasterCard's/Discover's money so the credit card company will almost always instantly cancel the payment, not questions asked."
buildapc,3e16h7,Fap-0-matic,6,Tue Jul 21 16:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I did.  BT said I had agreed to their terms and conditions which prohibited chargebacks.  The bank said I was held to the agreement.  And on and on.  It was fucking ridiculous.  I was going to go down there and punch someone!  I used to work for several banks, too, I'm no stranger to how this shit works, and even I was tripped up.  Fuckers. never again.  And their software was shitty anyway."
buildapc,3e16h7,Jessie_James,21,Tue Jul 21 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"BT said I had agreed to their terms and conditions which prohibited chargebacks   That should be illegal, if it isn't already.  Or at least, unenforceable."
buildapc,3e16h7,Eckish,6,Tue Jul 21 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention it because i dont work with it often. I'm lucky if I see one computer a month with Bitdefender on it, so your evaluation would be better than mine."
buildapc,3e16h7,NOT_AN_APPLE,6,Tue Jul 21 09:28:12 2015 UTC,Hmm. Try it if you have time. Like on a virtual machine or something. Bitdefender and Kaspersky go head to head for the top spot. Don't ignore Bitdefender's solution that easily.
buildapc,3e16h7,BITF14A508,5,Tue Jul 21 09:35:48 2015 UTC,i've used plenty of antivirus suites and bitdefender paired with malwarebytes takes the cake

buildapc,3e16h7,wrighmb,5,Tue Jul 21 12:31:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bitdefender Free also hits the sweet spot in terms of being low-maintenance and light on resources - I run it without a hitch or any noticeable performance penalty on my system (which has 8 GB RAM, though).  It doesn't have any frills or even much in terms of settings, which is a bit annoying but also makes it a good ""antivirus for the parents"" candidate."
buildapc,3e16h7,WhatGravitas,30,Tue Jul 21 15:10:13 2015 UTC,"I got a year of Bitdefender Plus on sale for like $25. Seemed like a no brainer to me. All around seems like a very good piece of virus protection. All of its other tools are very good as well. I do a system cleanup with it once a month maybe and it usually clears up close to a gig of space. Paired with mailwarebytes free, i seem to have everything covered."

buildapc,3e16h7,okungnyo,26,Tue Jul 21 08:32:19 2015 UTC,"Webroot. Especially for gamers. It uses so little system resources, it could be doing a full scan in the background while you're maxing your system and you wont notice the difference. The best part about it is that you wont even notice it's there. It doesn't interrupt games, it doesn't tell you that your PC needs to be optimized, It doesn't do system tray notifications, it doesn't even add a desktop icon by default. $30 a year isn't too bad for their basic AV either."
buildapc,3e16h7,NOT_AN_APPLE,11,Tue Jul 21 08:39:43 2015 UTC,"If you have a checking account with Ally Bank (which is free), you can actually avoid the cost, as they give Webroot subscriptions for free to all account holders."

buildapc,3e16h7,Jesse36m3,18,Tue Jul 21 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect example of Reddit, OP knows quite a lot about AV and most of the people know very little so his message becomes accepted as truth.   After almost 20 years in the AV industry I can tell that the list is not bad, but it's nowhere near accurate. Especially the protection level estimates are not very accurate. http://www.av-comparatives.org and https://www.av-test.org/en/ are good starting points to form your own opinion.  If you'd like to get an invite to a beta group for an AV, mostly production quality, often better since we can fix bugs faster, drop me a PM. You can also go to beta.f-secure.com and apply directly, but it might take a while to get in unless you PM me."

This is all from a large amount of personal experience and i have never done detection rate tests myself, nor am I using any official study in my post. The trick seems to be to find an AV that doesn't break your computer with pretty good detection rates instead of installing an AV that will detect everything but cause inconvenience or crashes."
buildapc,3e16h7,NOT_AN_APPLE,6,Tue Jul 21 18:08:17 2015 UTC,It's an interesting list and many of the observations hit home. Nothing to be ashamed of and it's for sure useful to people.

From my experience it is a piece of crap.  It eats a lot of system resources and degrades system performance during scans to the point of staff just walks away from their machine for awhile.  In the years of use, it has never caught or clean a virus, especially browser related ones.  The current version is better now but that also has to do with our machines being more up to date in specs.  Still would not recommend."

buildapc,3e16h7,Ashton187,11,Tue Jul 21 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"I have recently updated my own Antivirus Composite Score.  The biggest reason I like this method is that it doesn't rely on a single personal opinion - it's all based upon tested results from multiple independent companies which do not accept advertising dollars.  Recommendations: The best AV packages this year are Kaspersky and BitDefender.  You can also do very well with ESET Nod32 and Avira.  These ratings are typically based upon Internet Security Suites, but I would recommend getting a simple Antivirus to avoid the performance penalty.  To protect against malware (here, it's different than a virus), I instead recommend getting Malwarebytes (scanning and removal), Sypbot S&D (only use it for browser immunization), and SpywareBlaster (browser immunization).  Finally, and this is important, BACK UP YOUR FILES SECURELY!  If you don't have at least two copies of a file, it doesn't exist.  Antivirus software cannot restore lost files.  Recovery software cannot restore files if they are written over.  If you need offsite backup, PC Magazine has a good summary of notable offers.  Personal Experience: I often see people recommend to only use Microsoft's own AV package, but the problem is that it gets consistently low scores.  I've often also seen the argument that it does better in real life, so with that in mind, let me relay a real-life experience.  At work, we had different computers that all had antivirus installed.  I use ESET, some use McAfee, some use Norton, and one guy used Microsoft Security Essentials.  This year, we've had two separate attacks on our computers involving ransomware (where every file that computer has access to becomes encrypted with a 2048-bit AES key, and demands that you pay somewhere around $500-700 to a bitcoin address - no thanks).  The two computers were running McAfee and MSE.  So... I heavily recommend against using MSE.  McAfee kinda goes without saying - it's long been pretty much rubbish.  And as for comments about common sense - it was my own Antivirus (ESET) that caught a problem someone else brought to the network.  Part of the reason antivirus is important is that it helps protect you from someone else's mistakes.  If I had not had that protection, I would have lost about 3 months' work of data that could not be replaced.  Yes, we have a central backup, but that was compromised."

buildapc,3e16h7,TheImmortalLS,7,Tue Jul 21 06:37:35 2015 UTC,"It's buried in all the replies, but people need to know about http://www.av-comparatives.org/   ...they do thorough, independent tests of all the major AV-products. They test them on several levels - ability to detect, ability to remove, false positives, real world tests, etc. They are funded by a mix of university donations and testing fees (each manufacturer pays to be included in the tests, they are not sponsored by any particular AV company).  You should use this site to form your own opinion. But to save some time, here's what I've found from having checked it out regularly for a while.  • The most popular AV programs, Symantec and McAfee, didn't used to do very well at detection. Though norton is ok at removal. A surprising trend lately is that mcafee has gotten better at this, though I still wouldn't recommend it (it's a bloated, tedious program)  • MSE, aka Windows Defender, has been recommended countless times on reddit because it doesn't nag you much, but it's actually very poor at detecting and removing viruses. In the latest reports, it's dead last out of 21 products tested. Over half the products tested catch 99%+ of viruses, microsoft is at a shitty 86% which means about 1 in 6 viruses will sneak past it, even if they're old viruses that all the other guys block.  • The products that have been consistently doing well for years are Avira, NOD32, and Kaspersky. The paid Kaspersky suite is very good. For free, Avira is the best option and only asks you to close a single nag box per day (asking you to upgrade). It's what I use.  • Under their old testing methodology, they would compare detection rates for very recent viruses (hundreds of thousands of them) appearing in the last month or two before the test. This resulted in a huge failure rate because lots of 0-day (brand new) viruses would sneak past all the products which didn't have updates for them yet. Typically the results showed that the very best products blocked about 60% of the viruses, and the shitty ones were closer to 40%. Later the site changed their tests to have a cutoff date, only testing the older stuff and not the brand-newest viruses. By doing this, the virus detection rates jumped to 99%+ for most products. But IMO the old method was more informative, showing that certain products had a 5 or 10% edge on detecting brand new viruses the software hadn't seen before. Anyway that this tells you is that there's always brand new viruses that are 50/50 to infect you even with a pretty good product, so be careful.   • Something else to keep in mind - while most viruses require you to do something stupid like click a risky download link or open an unknown attachment... a few exploits don't require you to do anything except visit a web page, and even legit sites can be compromised with a virus that infects all visitors. So don't think you're safe just because you never click on whatever.exe ... if you browse around warez and crack sites, you're asking for trouble."

BTW, I suspect that an adblocker is also a big factor in prevention, maybe even a bigger one than AV software.  That doesn't mean that I recommend these users to dump their AV software, because by getting infections, evidently they don't know their way around the internet enough to recognize these threats. If you are a power user however, and have enough experience and common sense to recognize threats, you can absolutely get away with not running AV software.  Malware doesn't come from nowhere, every infection on your computer is your own fault: your own fault by not unchecking that checkbox during the installation of some sketchy shareware, by clicking the malicious ad on Download.com instead of the real download link or by extracting and executing the attachment in that obvious spam email message.

The thing is, no antivirus will really protect you from the most common source of malware. If you're clicking lottery links and sketchy ads while downloading toolbars, plugins, pirated apps, and porn that are infested with malware, you're still going to get a virus. The best an AV can do in those situations is warn you after the fact as it fails to remove the virus.

buildapc,3e3dp3,TbagtheDbag,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't have to upgrade the PSU when upgrading to the i5. And if money is tight the non-modular PSU will work fine.

You really wont notice air flow restraints unless you are overclocking to the extreme and you'd probably need a larger GPU to run into those problems.  So for this build it's a vanity thing.

buildapc,3e39ho,partynextdoor,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"If you're concerned about cost, the two things I'd recommend having a long look at would be your Mobo and that 500GB SSD.  As far as I know, that's a pretty expensive board, even for a Z97. Look up it's feature list on the manufacturer's website and see if you really need all of them, otherwise you may want to opt for a cheaper Z97 from the same manufacturer or elsewhere.   That extra 250GB of SSD space would be something to evaluate as well, IIRC the difference between them is ~$100, so maybe consider downsizing for now and buying another 250 or a 500 later when they're all cheaper"
buildapc,3e3hrm,mongees,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"I recommend the fractal over any of the two. Better airflow.  Between the s340 and the h440, I'd stick to the s340. Even though the h440 has a little more premium look and feel, I don't think it justifies the price difference."
buildapc,3e3hrm,gmainardi,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  The S340 and H440 both have really restrictive intakes, even when you pack it full of fans it's still choking for air. I never recommend these cases for that reason."
buildapc,3e3hrm,swiftlysauce,3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:29 2015 UTC,I have the H440 and it looks amazing. Choking for air? Have you even used the case?

This is the first time I am hearing about this so I'm a little lost.   Skylake requires a new mobo on a new socket (LGA1151) with a new chipset (the Z170, for example), just like Intel's previous ""tocks"".  The improvements are a combination of changes on both the processor and to the chipset  It will likely be about the same price as previous Intel chips.     You can't use an old motherboard with a Skylake chip, and you can't use an old chip with a Skylake compatible motherboard. Intel probably could have allowed for longer compatibility if they wanted to (with some engineering changes), but their current set-up limits the backwards compatibility between motherboards and CPUs to about one generation at best.     Some of the changes are in how the CPU talks with the chipset (NVMe and M.2 support, DMI 3.0, PCIe lane set-up, etc.), some are in what connectors the motherboard will have (dropping VGA and adding USB Type-C), and some changes are only on the CPU themselves (faster iGPU, less power usage, hardware VP9 support, etc.), but realistically, you won't be getting one without the other. It's going to be kinda all or nothing. If you upgrade to a Skylake CPU, you will have to upgrade to a Skylake compatible motherboard as well."

Out of the box the i7-4790K already comes clocked at 4.0 GHz base and 4.4 GHz turbo giving it quite good single threaded performance without overclocking.  Perhaps the person above is referring to the fact that the i7-5820K has more L3 cache (15 vs. 8 MB) and potentially higher memory bandwidth due to DDR4 which could give it higher performance than the i7-4790K in some scenarios."

buildapc,3dzi6k,jdorje,6,Mon Jul 20 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"Because you are doing video editing and 3D modeling, the 5820k should get an appropriate boost from its additional 2 cores. Their lower clock speed will cancel out some of this advantage, but if you plan to overclock then it will end up beating the 4790k by a decent amount.  But be price will end up being somewhat higher than the 4790k, and potentially a lot. The processors are similar costs, but the 5820k motherboard and DDR4 RAM is going to cost more.  You need to analyze how much the parts are going to cost you considering the access you have to various stores, and how much RAM you actually need. DDR4 is more expensive so the more you need the bigger the price differential becomes.  Once you look through the actual prices of everything it should be easier to provide an estimate of performance per dollar.  For the record, DDR4 offers very little performance improvement but costs quite a bit more.  You do get the option to upgrade your DDR4 motherboard/CPU to higher performance RAM in the future, but for most applications this doesn't matter, barring some unexpected changes in how programs utilize memory."

If you went 4790k, you'd still be thinking about the 5820K.  The 4790k pro of ""Has a wider selection of mATX and mini-ITX sized motherboards for small form factor systems"" is not really a pro for mATX. There are 3 different X99 mATX boards (I am lumping all 3 ASRocks into the same board). And all of them are more than sufficient at providing you with whatever slot config you need. Anything beyond that is colors/aesthetics, on-board passive adapters.  I mean, what do you think is going to happen to all those enterprise LGA 2011-3 Xeons in a few years once datacenters start phasing them out? They're going to go on ebay, etc. Then they'll drop very low in price because there are less X99 motherboards being manufactured (that support 2011-3 xeons) than there are 2011-3 Xeons.

buildapc,3dzi6k,jmilone1,5,Mon Jul 20 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"The haswell voltage wall means you easily overclock to a certain level - say 4.6 ghz on the 4790k, 4.4 on the 4690k, 4.3 on the 5820k - and each multiplier after that becomes exponentially harder to reach.  The practical limit is around 4.8/4.6/4.5. There is a fair amount of variability between chips,  of course.   Your performance will scale linearly with clock speed,  until you hit another bottleneck.  In gaming for instance you are likely to be bottlenecked by either your gpu or your monitors refresh rate,  so most games wont see much benefit at all from higher clock (the few exceptions are still well worth overclocking for,  if you play them). In video editing you are usually cpu bottlenecked,  and higher clock means straight up faster rendering,  though of course that gives diminishing returns as your render times get smaller."

buildapc,3dzi6k,spacestation16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:01 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, maybe if you can breathe new life into your Lenovo by swapping out that 5400rpm HDD and give it a SSD.  If you overclock your CPU, I cannot make a decision because I am not one.  If you are not an overclocker, since you already have ordered a graphics card, maybe you can give Xeon E3-1231v3 some consideration - it is slightly slower than your Devil's Canyon, but it is a lot cheaper (about the price of i5-4690K but you got full i7 performance,) lasts a lot longer (all Xeons, even include this cheap one, underwent tests a lot more rigorous than all i5's and i7's, and have a longer guaranteed MTBF,) and since it is slightly slower and does not have integrated graphics, it consumes a lot less power and runs cooler. It have the highest performance to cost ratio in both the sense of one time cost and long term cost (maintainence, electricity bills etc.) You can redirect that $90 to a good SSD instead.  The 5820K can work in a dual socket Xeon E5-2600v3 MoBo, and can be a stepstone solution of your way of building the ultimate machine for simultaneous gaming and rendering (e.g. when you are streaming to Twitch) - start off with 5820K on such a dual socket motherboard, and when you have that second round of budget you can invest on two E5-2643v3 to bring the powerhouse to its maximum potential."

Apart from that, you can still use it like a completely normal CPU. Also, there are boards with which you can run 2 of them.  Overclocking won't be possible in a clean way, you only have the base clock to Play with (few MHz to win at most), maybe there are some boards that can run it at Turbo all the time, but I don't think so.

For every game you install that is already installed, it will attempt to verify the files (since it's already there). In the worst case though, it might just re-download your games anyway.

They are powerful enough in SLI, but they only have 3.5GB of effective VRAM.  I am not sure buying 2 for SLI and thinking of ""future proofing"" is a good idea. I've had 570's in SLI until recently (I've actually purchased the second one cheaply on ebay a few years ago), and I was constantly running into VRAM issues. You will probably have similar issues in 2 years or so (especially if you'll use a higher resolution than 1080p) if you go with this route."
buildapc,3e3cfo,CherryPlay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:05 2015 UTC,Hasn't something gone around saying soon you will be able to use both cards VRAM? And yeah I'm starting to lean towards just upgrading my card when the time comes.
buildapc,3e3cfo,jnxjnx,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:56 2015 UTC,"970s are SLI, AMD cards are crossfire but I get what you mean. Some games aren't optimized for SLI. So literally in some games the 2nd card wont do anything. I have a 970 myself and its been awesome at 1080p, IMHO I'd just get a stronger card down the road like a 980ti or the equivalent at the time."

Many People prefer wattage over Quality (e.g. better taking a shitty 800W one instead of a very good 500W one for an i5+970, even with heavy overclocks the good 500W one would be better).  The only consequences present for you are varying effiencies. At full load (that you'll never achieve with one Card), you'll have very slightly worse Efficiency than at about 50% load, maybe a few percent. At low relative loads (usually below 20% load), you'll lose a bit more Efficiency, so that might mean you'd have better Efficiency at idling with a lower wattage PSU. Generally, These differences are very tiny, and may add up to a Dollar a year, so I really wouldn't care about it."

Do the majority of people overclock it accidentally or is it on purpose with this? I'm new to the whole building a computer. Trying to learn.
buildapc,3e2ahq,thefinnachee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"No problem. Overclocking allows you to put the speed of the CPU higher (like from 3.3Ghz to 3.8Ghz for example). This will make the CPU perform slightly better on everything it does varying on the task. Before this used to be tedious and kind of difficult. Now most motherboards like the Z97 you just click a button through an app that comes with the motherboard and that's it! This will give you higher fps on games from 5-25 or more frames depending on the game and how high the speed of the CPU is set. The other main feature of Z97s is that it allows dual graphic cards to run real smooth because they were designed for crossfire/sli in mind. However, overclocking will give higher temps on the CPU so you will need the assistance of a cooler. The infamous Hyper 212+ EVO. It's 28$ and performs really well. You can also watercool but that's usually expensive."

buildapc,3e2j4u,jcav299,3,Tue Jul 21 13:37:21 2015 UTC,i7's are overkill for gaming. thus you can save money by not buying an i7 which hardly gives you more benefits. is this the answer you were looking for?

buildapc,3e2j4u,a_single_testicle,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:01 2015 UTC,"The differences between the two are largely multi-threaded performance.  This benefits the i7 for CPU intensive tasks like video rendering (and highly threaded benchmarks), but most games won't take advantage of anything more than your typical 4-core i5 provides.  Otherwise, the very newest i7s (Haswell-E/2011 V3) support additional PCIe lanes that can help with larger SLI setups and PCIe storage, but that's about it."

buildapc,3e2hr7,5yndron,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:13 2015 UTC,You can take a look inside your case - the only other limiting factor would be your case & whether it is big enough to support larger graphics cards.
buildapc,3e2hr7,Danilo_dk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:36 2015 UTC,If the motherboard has PCI-e 3.0 and the PSU is good enough and the case is big enough you should be able to get any GPU you want.

It will be easier than you think, just take your time, keep your workstation clean and enjoy it! It's very rewarding :)"
buildapc,3e1gui,LDYo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:23:40 2015 UTC,"On the same note, how important is it to do an out of the case build before actually doing the real thing? I am in the same position as OP :)"
buildapc,3e1gui,Buterfli,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"Of the 4 PC's I've built (which admittedly is a very small sample size) I've never done it, and it's never been a problem. I started to do it in my most recent build about a week ago, decided it was a pain in the ass, and quit halfway through. If you want to be incredibly thorough, you can do it, but odds are it won't make a difference."
buildapc,3e1gui,ImmortalScrub,5,Tue Jul 21 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say not very important. Only real benefit you get is somewhat easier troubleshooting as you don't need to work within constraints of your case. But then nobody seems to recommend tight, tiny cases to new builders so that's not much of an issue.  Some less convenient hardware combinations are actually hard to assemble once you put them into the case. In my current (rather compact) build for example it's outright impossible to remove heatsink while it's inside. Removing 2 closest sticks of RAM under it is extremely hard and requires removing the CPU fan, which thanks to awkward mounting mechanism is also super annoying. Some of my cable management choices dictate further limits."
buildapc,3e1gui,reddanit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"Check if you've got all the cables: - some motherboards are sold with no sata cables or just 1, - some monitors are sold with no video cable, - case fans that can't be plugged to the motherboard, only to the psu, and the psu needs an adapter for them - video card that needs 2 pcie power cables, but the psu only has 1, - etc.    Only a really small amount of thermal paste is needed. For optimal temperatures, replace the paste on the cpu every 3 years. The paste itself can only be stored 2 years: you'll have to buy new paste by then.  Special tools or special screws: no need, unless you're building with proprietary parts."
buildapc,3e1gui,clupean,3,Tue Jul 21 06:04:56 2015 UTC,"I will have to check for the case fans then as I didn't even notice that! Is there a certain amount of cooling (fans) I need for my pc?

buildapc,3e1gui,TheSiskoIsCoporeal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:15 2015 UTC,You should put one case fan in the front and one in the back. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE BLOWING THE CORRECT WAY. The front one blowing in and the back one blowing out.That should be it. In the future you can add another one to the front blowing in. It's nearly always better to have a positive air pressure inside.
buildapc,3e1gui,TheSiskoIsCoporeal,3,Tue Jul 21 06:15:58 2015 UTC,Yea I read that sentence somewhere. That just means more intake than exhaust correct? I have 2 (back and front) that are pre-installed so they should be correct beforehand
buildapc,3e1gui,TheSiskoIsCoporeal,4,Tue Jul 21 06:18:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, more intake than exhaust. Also check the pre-installed fans, I've had a friend who got an NZXT case with both facing in."
buildapc,3e1gui,Call3h,2,Tue Jul 21 06:22:58 2015 UTC,Run the 8-pin CPU power and plug it in JUST BEFORE securing the motherboard to the standoffs. That thing can be a bitch to plug in in many cases.

buildapc,3e1gui,Buterfli,5,Tue Jul 21 06:19:22 2015 UTC,I picked this tip up from watching some of LinusTechTips' build guides. I'd suggest watching one through before you build. They're only ~20min long and were very helpful for my first build.
buildapc,3e1gui,LDYo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:24:47 2015 UTC,"You only need to apply thermal paste if you'll be using an aftermarket air cooler like the 212 EVO. The stock cooler and most liquid coolers come with thermal paste preapplied.  For the GPU, you don't have to worry about thermal paste. The cooler is already installed.  I have no idea what you'd have to get for cable management. Zipties already come with your case, and sometimes your motherboard.  You will have to apply lots of force when closing the CPU socket. You'll also probably hear a nasty creaking noise. Don't worry, that's totally normal.  Don't forget installing your I/O shield before you install your motherboard. The I/O shield may have some metal tabs on it that get in the way of installing the motherboard. Just push those up and over the I/O sockets on your motherboard.  You don't really need to test anything before you build it. That part's completely optional, but if you feel more comfortable doing it, go right ahead.  Make sure you keep your workstation clean. You're gonna have tons of messy fliers, CDs with drivers, promo codes, stickers, etc. coming with your boxes. Don't let those get in the way of more essential stuff like screws and cables.  For the duration of your build, your motherboard manual is your new bible. Use it."
buildapc,3e1gui,RandomBritishGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 06:00:56 2015 UTC,"Also, some aftermarket coolers like the 212 EVO comes with a small tube of thermal paste. If you already bought a separate tube, it's not the end of the world but I guess you can save it for a couple years until you need to apply it again."
buildapc,3e1gui,dopescope1111,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:43 2015 UTC,You're not kidding about the force and noises that come with the CPU. I read about it beforehand so I was expecting some resistance and unsavory noises I just wasn't aware how much. The pressure you have to exert when lowering the lever is much more than you anticipate as a first time builder.  Just make sure it's seated right (arrow to arrow side and it has slipped through the notches) and it will be fine.

buildapc,3e1gui,Vecimen,3,Tue Jul 21 08:54:32 2015 UTC,"It's not like PC parts go bad unless used immediately so don't rush anything. If you aren't sure whether something should be done in particular way - sit down and think before you act, perhaps look again at some build log on youtube or look at relevant manual you have. If you have made a mistake - don't panic - just stop until you have figured what exactly you have done and whether there is any damage to mitigate.  It's not a contest of speed and triple checking stuff is common sense when dealing with expensive parts."

buildapc,3e1gui,Zantza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:15 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can offer (I started building PCs a couple of years ago so I'm by no means an expert) is to literally plan and 'map out' where everything is going to sit in your case - most relevant if you have a few case fans, a complicated CPU cooler, multiple hard drives etc. The amount of time saved doing this, rather than having to remove something because it doesn't fit or you can't quite get a cable where you want it because something is in the way, was very valuable to me."

buildapc,3e2gk2,TUBBB,2,Tue Jul 21 14:18:24 2015 UTC,When buying PSU cables you have to make sure it's compatible with your exact model of PSU!  Not all PSU's have the same pinout. The end of the cables that you plug into the motherboard is (almost) always the same but the end of the cable that plugs into the PSU itself may have a different layout. Using an incompatible cable could lead to very bad things.

If you ask me about the brands, I would suggest Gigabyte Ultra Durable series, as I have a few of those serving me for more than 5 years, and Lenovo, the maker of ThinkCenter, use Gigabyte Ultra Durable in their business-grade workstations.  You can invest all that money saved from getting the Xeon instead of i7, getting a H97 MoBo instead of Z97 or X99, and getting DDR3 memory instead of DDR4, into bumping your GPU up a notch - R9 Fury X or GTX Titan X, or getting (or bumping up capacity of) an SSD instead of spinning platters, or get yourself a few more terabytes of spinning platters storage, or maybe bump up the memory to 16GB. Or if you still want to invest that money in MoBo and push your system's durability to a maximum (10+ years of service maybe,) you can go and check out workstation grade C220 series and use ECC memory to reduce system crashes and further increase the system's durability.  Since Intel Sandy Bridge generation, the E3-1230 series (SNB E3-1230, IVB E3-1230v2, Haswell E3-1230v3 and this Haswell Refresh E3-1231v3) was always a miracle of its cost-performance ratio."

I know it stinks having a small capacity and then leaving a big chunk open. If you want the blazing performance, though, you have to leave 20% of the drive available. IMAGE BACKUPS. SSDs do last longer and are more relaible, however eventually it WILL die. When an SSD goes, you don't get the slow crashiness and freezing that a standard spinny gets. It just shuts off one day and doesn't turn back on. Recovering files requires taking the chips off the board and putting them in a new board. It's clean room work and starts at 500$ with most companies. if you have anything on there that's important, back it up! if you can hold off on an SSD purchase, I'd recommend waiting. prices are dropping like crazy!"

This is why every single person that uses a computer should have backups running. Always.   But, I also had your worry which is why I bought Intel 730's. They are built to run 24/7 at 70 GBs of writes per day. You can find SSDs that are more robust than others but you tend to pay a little more for them, but it's a nice peace of mind.  I completely lucked out with a messed up listing at Newegg that had 240 GB Intel 730's at $99. It was taken down the next day (this was 7 months ago, too... such crazy steal), but I got two of them and put them in RAID 0 (so... damn... fast) giving me a 480 GB screaming fast main drive, and I use the mechanical to perform backups which run every hour unless I'm in game.

buildapc,3dxilt,BrewingHeavyWeather,5,Tue Jul 21 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"Citation on that, please.  So long as you are buying the same level of hardware (ie: not comparing cheap SSDs to enthusiast/raid-level HDDs), the last couple generations have shown the opposite to be true.  For home/office use, the ""wear"" on SSDs is a virtual non-issue. Normal users simply don't produce enough writes over the life of a PC to have the SSD fail through storage wear. As they have no moving parts, there is no mechanical wear, either. It has electronic component wear, but so does the HDD, and the HDD will usually generate more heat (no idea on the funky m.2 SSD which seem to get inordinately hot).  So, what we're actually left to compare is the mechanical wear/failure of an HDD versus the firmware failure rate of SSDs. For my part, I'd much rather bet my money on the firmware, as that can often be fixed. If the spindle on an HDD fails... I'm out of luck.  While it's far from experimental evidence, even at the early days of SSD adoption in datacenters, my employer was seeing HDD failure rates (of drives installed at the same time) of about 1.5x that of SSDs. Of course, the SSDs were 2-3x as expensive at the time, so HDDs were still a cheaper option if we didn't need the performance of an SSD.  However, I still haven't seen any sort of truly scientific measurement of the failure rates of HDDs vs SSDs, and that's likely due to the fact that most datacenters are switching them out for better hardware faster than their actual failure rates."

buildapc,3e37ta,Oathbreakr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:49 2015 UTC,Yes in the future they will but I don't see it becoming necessary for a long time. People still use G3258 duo cores to play games on high settings and quadcores have been the norm for some time now. By the time you actually need 6 cores you'll be upgrading again from 1150 to whatever bizarre socket Intel comes up with. The $ per performance just isn't worth it right now.

buildapc,3e2e8n,mulholland,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:04 2015 UTC,Depends on the games to be honest
buildapc,3e2e8n,awesomecvl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:47 2015 UTC,Seeing as the 290x is on par with the 970 and is actually better at higher resolutions (1440p and above) I think it's a great deal. The only tradeoffs being that you won't get any fancy new features they add to the latest gen but you still have access to freesync and supersampling. Another thing to note is how hot the card runs. As someone with an original reference 290x I would advise to think about spending the extra $30-40 for a different cooler design if that's available because my card under full load sounds like a jet engine and I can easily hear it when I'm wearing semi large headphones (audio technica m50x) and I'm actually thinking of getting some kind of liquid cooling for it. But if you can live or overcome those problems I think it's a great deal
buildapc,3e2e8n,hazetoblack,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:03 2015 UTC,The 290x is identical feature-wise to the 390.
buildapc,3e2e8n,Exist50,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:52 2015 UTC,Other than the amount of vram
buildapc,3e2e8n,hobowithabazooka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"At the moment at least. But there's a chance AMD may introduce new features exclusively or atleast first for the 300 and fury series, but I agree it's not a big deal really."
buildapc,3e2e8n,hazetoblack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"The 390 is the same GPU as the 290. Anything one can support, the other can as well.  In fact, AMD already did exactly what you are describing. The release drivers for the 300 series offered some things (VSR and improved tessellation) that the 200 series lacked, but the latest drivers unified everything again. The divide was entirely artificial, and is now gone."
buildapc,3e2e8n,Exist50,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on which 290x and 390 you are comparing, but they will probably be pretty close to each other. Even if the 390 pulls ahead in some cases (I think it does) I don't think it is $80 worth of performance difference."
buildapc,3e2e8n,nikto11,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:06:44 2015 UTC,"The R9 390 has 8GB of VRAM, of course it's going to be better most of the time. Plus, you'll keep for a while longer meaning you can upgrade your resolution too where the extra memory will come in very handy.  Edit: clarity"
buildapc,3e2e8n,goldzatfig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:39 2015 UTC,At $250 yes they're worth it but a 290 but be better performance per dollar. The 290x is NOT better than a 390.
buildapc,3e2e8n,Skatrdie0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:38 2015 UTC,actually the 290X is better than a 390. It has more shader cores. Clock for clock it will be about 10% faster. Unless you can OC the 390 at least 10% faster (unlikely) a 290X will be better.   The difference in VRAM isn't going to ever make up for the difference in core count.
buildapc,3e2e8n,slapdashbr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"The 390 has faster vram, though, and core count doesn't scale linearly with performance."
buildapc,3e2e8n,Exist50,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:11 2015 UTC,"Core count scales almost perfectly 1:1 with performanxe, in fact, on a similar architecture, as you can see by looking at benchmarks.   You can almost always OC vram on a 290x to at least 1500mhz. If possible I'd suggest getting a model from msi or gigabyte, since they also make nvidia cards, they often use RAM rated for higher frequencies. My MSI 7950 vram OCs from 1250mhz to over 1800 and that's a three year old card.   Even if not, the memory bandwidth is not as impactful as the strength of the gpu on performance. Even at stock speeds (which means higher clocks on the 390) the 290x is going to slightly out-perform the 390, with OC the 290x will pull further ahead thanks to higher oc headroom."
buildapc,3e2e8n,slapdashbr,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"The vram clock speed (tested manually), for whatever reason, does seem to improve the performance, particularly at higher resolutions. Also,    Core count scales almost perfectly 1:1 with performanxe, in fact, on a similar architecture, as you can see by looking at benchmarks.   This isn't really true when you're comparing a cut down chip to a full one. For example, look at the Fury. http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/ASUS/R9_Fury_Strix/31.html  Despite having a 12.5% reduced core count in addition to a marginally lower GPU clock speed, it is always <10% worse than the Fury X. Maybe 3x4K or something would get you to 12.5%, but at any reasonable resolution, you will not see linear performance scaling."

If the thermal paste is dried it can somewhat glue the heatsink to the CPU. So if you take to much force to take off the heatsink while the CPU is fixed in the socket, it can happen that you pull out some pins slightly so they lose contact to the chip.

I did my best to not get any on the motherboard, but there was a couple VERY VERY tiny specs that ended up getting on there when I was pulling the cpu/cooler off.  I cleaned up the paste on the board to the best of my ability though.   I did not reapply any paste, I just left some paste on there because there had been so much, but cleaned up the sides of the cooler and cpu."
buildapc,3e27fe,Asataro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:14 2015 UTC,"Bent pins are not the only ""physical damage"" that can happen. like i said it can happen that you pull out some pins. even if they are not pulled out completely.  what did you use to clean the board? did you ground yourself before pulling out the CPU and checking it for bent pins? did you touch the pins?"
buildapc,3e27fe,Asataro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:18 2015 UTC,"For cleaning the paste, I tried to get something that was going to absorb more of it, so i used a clean microfiber towel (not wet or anything).  I did not ground myself :/ .  I did end up touching the pins, because it slipped in my hand when wiping off the excess thermal paste.  It sounds like i definitely screwed up the CPU :(."
buildapc,3e27fe,andrew28_reddit,2,Tue Jul 21 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"That's possible. My guess is you either damaged the pins or zapped the CPU because you did not ground yourself.  Some non conductive thermal paste on the mainboard would not destroy anything.  My next steps would be to clean everything with high percentage rubbing alcohol check the pins, check the socket. Then use new thermal paste and try it again.  I dont have many hopes for this CPU.  If you clean with alcohol, make sure the alcohol vaporizes completely and everything is dry.  Dont know if you can RMA something like that since i have no experience with that. Never had to deal with such problems on my build."

buildapc,3e2tsn,DonJimbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"You'd want to boot to the BIOS, grab the version number. Then when you boot to the PC, look up and see if there's a newer version of the BIOS on the manufacturer's site. If there is, you can run the update (follow their instructions to the letter), if there isn't, great, you're good.  Power won't be a problem, every modern PSU and motherboard combo are compatible."

buildapc,3e2t6z,Michelanvalo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:09 2015 UTC,The GTX 600 and 970 use the same PCI-E socket. So you can upgrade freely. That shouldn't change at all in the future. The Pentium G and i series processors currently use the same socket type so upgrading that too is fine. But if the socket type changes you'll need a new motherboard too.

You might have a bit, in a smaller build reference coolers tend to help, but the 290 reference are garbage so might not be good in this situation. Worst case you may need to look into better fans for the case to improve airflow.   2/3 IIRC there still isn't any major drawback to running on pci 2, maybe a few frames with higher end cards (which yours is). But you can't run multiple cards without drastic impact on performance. That said if you could get a pci 3 board it may be a good idea. Something like this board for an extra 20 would work. Is it worth it now, perhaps not but depending on how long you use the system it may be helpful.   4- Yes"

buildapc,3e2puh,Artisanpasta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:03 2015 UTC,"The 4690K is only $199 at Micro Center, plus it gives you a $30 discount on motherboards."
buildapc,3e2puh,Zoro775,0,Tue Jul 21 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"any of the haswell refresh i5s are good, whichever is cheapest. he's already said he won't overclock so there's no point in the 4690k unless as you point out it's actually cheaper than the 4690"
buildapc,3e2puh,goldzatfig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"Id say get the i7 cause even if you aren't going to Overclock, you will benefit from a 4Ghz Base clock with a 4.4Ghz Turbo. This will help with many CPU bound games as well."
buildapc,3e2puh,Artisanpasta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Xeon E3-1231v3. If you're not overclocking, like the idea of an i7 and have enough for both then meet in the middle and get that!  Pros:   Cheaper than an i7 Slightly lower TDP (-8w) 4 cores/ 8 threads Still fast at clock speeds of 3.4/3.8GHZ Work on any chipset that an i7 would work on. (H81 through to Z97)   Cons:   No integrated graphics processor (probably won't use it anyway) Lower clock speed by .6GHZ or more when turbo'd Can't be overclocked   Well worth it in my opinion."
