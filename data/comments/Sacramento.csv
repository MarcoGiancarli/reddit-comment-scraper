It can easily be done by a decent swimmer on a good day, but that's part of the problem. It's deceiving as fuck. The midtown side of the river is shallow and slow, you don't get any depth or real current until you're 3/4 way across. The swift side (where it actually gets deep and most of the current flows) is also full of submerged logs right up to the shore.  Luckily I've never seen anybody get into real trouble out there. But I've seen plenty of people overestimate their ability or underestimate the river. They end up 1/4 mile or more downstream and exhausted. It wouldn't take much for any of those poor souls to end up like this one.    RIP."

Me and my buddy did this hike 3 times last year and got some great pictures and video. Not too many people go there because it can be a little bit difficult to get to the beach and the trail is technically closed, but its well worth it. Don't click on the video link unless you want to spoil the views of your hike! Here is a video where me and my buddy had the entire beach and waterfall to ourselves.  edit - My favorite waterfall hike has to be Horsetail Falls. It's about an hour and a half away from Sacramento. Only do the Horsetail Falls hike if you are feeling adventurous because its not a trail. It's what you call a wilderness hike and you are supposed to sign the wilderness permit at the post near the trail head before you go. If you end up doing this hike, Just follow the water and when you don't know where to go next look for statues of balanced rocks. This is a really popular hike so I wouldn't worry about getting lost and its really hard to get lost anyways because you will pretty much always hear the water. When you get to the top of the waterfalls there will be a large pond and nice area to have a picnic. Hopefully you are not afraid of heights because this one has a few points that can be kind of scary. This hike has a lot of small scale bouldering to it.. so if you don't like to climb a few rocks here and there, this one probably isn't for you. But I highly recommend it."
Sacramento,3dswxe,SuntoryWhiskey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:20:41 2015 UTC,I really want to go to horsetail falls but all I read about is how bad the parking gets filled up quickly... Thinking of going on a weekday to avoid the crowds!

Sacramento,3dswxe,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sun Jul 19 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"Cataract falls trail at Mt Tamalpais is one of the best waterfall viewing places in Northern CA.  It's basically 3 miles of stairs following the creek up to the top with waterfalls all along the way. I don't know what the flow is like right now (I assume sad), but after a rain it's pretty awesome."

Sacramento,3drbdu,xilpaxim,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"They can still get you by signing into the contract without payment right there.  My favorite is when they sales person knows that you aren't going to buy and begins to insult you. That's always funny.  Also in regards to gift they offer to receive them you have to fulfill specific criteria like you'll have to stay for the pitch for x number of hours, you'll have to give them a certain amount of contact information. The goal for some of these sales is to wear a person down into buying. It's nuts and it's better to not deal with it at all."

Sacramento,3dpavs,raven3371,3,Sat Jul 18 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"North Natomas is generally nice (and definitely nicer than South Natomas, where I live..) with lots of businesses and such.   There's the American River bike trail that I like to bike on.  I go alone.. not a big fan of exercising with other people!  It's a nice walk and there's lots of random things to see - the river, interesting paths, hobos.. Have steam?  Play League?  PM me and we can play some. :)  Maybe shoot some archery in Rocklin/Shingle Springs? if you were here looking at your apartment, summer feels like that.  It's hot and it usually cools down by 8 or 9.  Sometimes it gets into the 3 digits and it's horrendous.  Happens every so often during the summer.  Winter is cold, but fine.  It does sometimes get below freezing, but usually hovers around 40ish at night.  I've had my windshield frost over.. but otherwise it's fine."

League of legends, WoW, hearthstone, steam games, etc. Send me a PM if you want to be friends on any of these games!  Winter is really nice and summer gets hot but the nights are nice.   When you move here and have nothing to do feel free to PM me and my boyfriend and I can show you some really good places to eat around Sac!"

I'd be happy to meet you when you get here if you want to grab a drink or see a movie or something. It seems less intimidating to meet with one person instead of a group. PM me if you want!"

Sacramento,3dpavs,GoatBrewGuild,4,Sat Jul 18 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"Generally nice? Yes. Somewhat desolate/isolated but not bad.  You can bike, kayak, hike, dirt bike, raft, run, whatever outdoor. In the winter you're an hour and a half from snowboarding, in the summer you're an hour and a half from SF (kinda-sorta beaches, nothing compared to SoCal beaches).  Meeting people is merely you having to step out of your comfort zone. Do something out of your norm.   Summers are hot. Winters are mild. Hell compared to LA weather, but hey! No smog!Less smog"
Sacramento,3dpavs,Wackamento,8,Sat Jul 18 04:13:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on where in LA.  Sac is only a bit warmer than the valleys of SoCal.    OP, the winters here are fine, in fact we have what some would call seasons.  There are more trees here than SoCal.  And the neighborhood you're going to live in is called Natomas.  It's perfect for suburbians.  You should move to midtown."
Sacramento,3dpavs,dadumk,2,Sat Jul 18 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"Here are a couple good links. If I understand correctly where you'll be, I'm not sure you'll technically be in city limits, but will be in county limits. And ya, that's a pretty decent area. We have some nice parks, rivers, recreational areas, plus (as many will prolly say), we're close to lots of things: mountains, reno, tahoe, SF. http://www.visitsacramento.com/ http://www.cityofsacramento.org/"
Sacramento,3dpavs,GoateeDude,2,Sat Jul 18 05:13:51 2015 UTC,"There is a lot really good looking hiking spots in auburn, not far of a drive. If you like to drink midtown has a nice set of bars."
Sacramento,3dpavs,Jak33,2,Sat Jul 18 05:23:35 2015 UTC,"Sacramento is a great place for people who love the outdoors. Easy access to the river, plenty of local trails to walk/run, and quick access to beautiful hiking in the Sierra Nevadas or the coast. As far as weather, our summers are hot, temperatures generally average somewhere around the mid 90's with a couple weeks worth of days reaching into the 100's. Winters are a bit chilly (especially compared to LA) but totally bearable, during the coldest weeks highs will be in the low 50's and overnight lows will dip below freezing but those temps don't tend to last too long. Winters here are also very nice compared to many other parts of the country because we almost never get snow in the valley, though the nearby mountains get plenty of it which is great for skiing and snowboarding."
Sacramento,3dpavs,AnAttractivePenguin,2,Sat Jul 18 07:09:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know North Sacramento too well, but I did work there for about two months and the surrounding areas seemed nice. I know there are some parts of Natomas that aren't great, but there seems to be a decent amount to do at least.  Plenty of outdoor things to do, if you drive up to the Rancho Cordova area you can rent kayaks which is nice. Lots of running and bike trails near the American River. If you're a runner there tends to be plenty of races (5ks, triathlons, etc). Sacramento is also close to day trips area such as Tahoe, Napa, Calaveras Big Trees, the ocean, etc. Join a meetup! Or if you are into games, my boyfriend likes to go hang out at places like Great Escape and he has met a lot of people that way. You and I are the same age, so feel free to hit me up if you ever want to hang out. My boyfriend and I are on a mission to check out all the awesome breweries Sac has to offer.  Summer is hot. Often 90s/100s, but usually there is a delta breeze which helps a little. Winter is mild, not much rain right now as I'm sure you know, and not very cold temperatures.   As someone who has moved a lot in her life and usually dislikes living in one area for more than a year, I have to say I really like Sacramento and can see myself continuing living here. Lots of new places popping up around town, and there are plenty of community happenings. Right now we have a solar cooking festival going on, next weekend is Sacratomato festival. Feel free to PM me for more ideas!  Edit: If you leave a yelp review once in awhile, you can attend unofficial yelp events. Yelp even more to become ""elite"" and you can attend yelp elite events which are free and awesome. Come on out, we're a friendly bunch of people :)"
Sacramento,3dpavs,daniswede,4,Sat Jul 18 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"My wife moved up here from so-cal. A few things to remember:   If you call I-5 ""the 5"" you'll be recognized as an outsider and probably eaten alive.  Hella is a thing, get used to it.  A lot of your neighboring cities have wildlife like turkey, deer, and chickens. So be a cautious driver. If you run over a chicken in fair oaks, the locals will put a bounty on you.  I know meeting people is difficult. Especially when you're new to a city. You'll be fine... Probably."

However, moving here from LA may require a big shift in your mindset. A lot of folks who come to my office from Southern California or the Bay Area don't give Sac enough of a shot and end up moving back pretty quickly. Sacramento is a great city, but it might as well be in a different state from coastal Southern California. I'll PM you later today when I have more time."

People in Sac kind of do their  own thing. There's a diverse amount of activities and they're all over town so there's plenty to explore. If you're near natomas, it's expanding so you have easy access to the freeways to go downtown. Locally you have the movie theatre and gyms with the American River Bike Trail.  Try going out to srcond saturday next month to get a small hint of what the community is like or go to the library in north or sac notomas when they have community events. People in your area are very nice, though like me a lot of people stay in their own house rather than go out.  Good location from traveling too, you're about 2 hours from San Francisco and about 2 hours from Lake Tahoe (both are gorgeous places to visit!!)"
