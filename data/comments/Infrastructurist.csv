Infrastructurist,3e5m5p,cracked_mud,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:26:24 2015 UTC,Why does something so simple have to be so controversial.
Infrastructurist,3e09k5,stefeyboy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple really. Tunnels have a pretty fixed cost per mile whether thy are carrying 15,000 people a day or 250,000 so the question is just how much are we spending per person? If our line is only going to carry 15,000 people then the cost is prohibitive, if it's 50,000+ then it starts to make a lot more sense."
Infrastructurist,3e09k5,cracked_mud,2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the short term the costs are fixed, but in the long term the costs can escalate quickly if it is not properly designed or maintained.  The recent DC Metro fire where someone died was related to water intrusion into the tunnels and maintenance issues.  In the case of Metro they chose to pump the water out, rather than fix the leaks."
Infrastructurist,3e09k5,red_tux,2,Tue Jul 21 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"We have a big ass tunnel in Portland. It was surely expensive but clearly not prohibitive.  Just looked it up and it was $184 million for a ~3 mile tunnel, fifth deepest subway station in the world. That seems totally doable if you are boring through the right kind of rock."
Infrastructurist,3dy6kr,stefeyboy,13,Mon Jul 20 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"I think that people forget how heavily subsidized roads are. Just because you need a private vehicle to use them (in most places), doesn't mean they don't cost the taxpayers money, too!"
Infrastructurist,3dy6kr,burlap_pterodactyl,6,Mon Jul 20 14:44:43 2015 UTC,That is a great point that never gets brought up to rebut the criticism that rail is not self-sustaining.
Infrastructurist,3dy6kr,MarshallGibsonLP,6,Mon Jul 20 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"It's great that people are starting to realize that gas taxes, tolls, and car registrations in their current form don't even come close to covering the cost of road infrastructure. Just because you pay something doesn't mean it doesn't also need subsidies.  The same applies to rail transit."
Infrastructurist,3dy6kr,DesertFlyer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"That's an argument for raising the gas tax, not for subsidizing rail. The market doesn't function correctly when subsidies are given. When we subsidize ALL modes of transport that just means even lower density suburbs because commuters aren't having the pay for the true cost of living so far from the urban core. People who make this into a debate between cars and trains are missing that the REAL debate is between suburban sprawl and intelligently planned cities."
Infrastructurist,3dx0n6,stefeyboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:41 2015 UTC,"Of course it does. Cities do not plan for catastrophic events. Well, many cities don't properly plan for growth either. City leaders don't want to spend the money and voters are notoriously short sighted."
Infrastructurist,3drcf4,stefeyboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"I want to learn more about the guy who recorded all the street names for the Los Angeles Metro Bus Fleet.  That voice actor is not the same as the one who records the train station announcements and is otherwise considered ""the voice of LA Metro."""
Infrastructurist,3dqfpu,stefeyboy,5,Sat Jul 18 13:20:43 2015 UTC,It'd be nice if they would talk about the name or number or designation of the bill so that one could reference it when speaking with ones senator.
Infrastructurist,3dqfpu,MashedPeas,4,Sat Jul 18 22:42:00 2015 UTC,"Damn, none of the onerous FRA bullshit that ruins passenger rail."
Infrastructurist,3dje30,stefeyboy,5,Thu Jul 16 19:17:52 2015 UTC,Larry Hogan is a fool who is ignoring the needs of one of the densest suburban regions in the entire nation. The region already has top 5 traffic problems. These lines are needed greatly.
Infrastructurist,3dje30,posam,5,Thu Jul 16 21:47:19 2015 UTC,Road widening is the dumbest and laziest resolution to congestion and efficient infrastructure.

Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,stefeyboy,2,Tue Jul 14 15:12:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why this isn't considered evidence that public agencies cannot properly manage their assets. If the public water companies did a good job, would we even be in this situation?"
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,ChaosMotor,2,Tue Jul 14 19:52:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, you are never going to be able to consistently elect people who know how to maintain complex infrastructure. The jack off lawyer that gets elected to city council is not going to understand that the million dollars in the budget for sewer maintenance actually needs to be there. He'll cut the budget and cut taxes to get re-elected. Down the road the city will have a crumbling sewer system."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,MoreAlphabetSoup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:03:06 2015 UTC,"Which is why its a good reason to have it privatized. But then the question becomes, if it starts crumbling under the private company, what happens?"
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,clear831,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:51:50 2015 UTC,What incentive does the private company have to let its sole source of revenue fall apart?
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,ChaosMotor,2,Wed Jul 15 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"The problem with privatizing utilities is that they're subject to strict price controls and other regulation. This reduces the incentive to innovate and invest capital into the system. Additionally, since they are privately owned public utilities, there are subject to x-inefficiencies.   Overall, there are compelling arguments for utilities to be public or private."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,vdersar1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"they're subject to strict price controls and other regulation. This reduces the incentive to innovate and invest capital into the system.   And yet this is an encumbrance created by the local government, which means it's not inherent.    Additionally, since they are privately owned public utilities, there are subject to x-inefficiencies   Just making an assertion does not validate the truth of that assertion.    Overall, there are compelling arguments for utilities to be public or private.   Yet the arguments are secondary to reality, and the reality is that publicly owned utilities are rife with mismanagement and malinvestment."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,ChaosMotor,2,Wed Jul 15 16:57:35 2015 UTC,"And yet this is an encumbrance created by the local government, which means it's not inherent.  Yet the arguments are secondary to reality, and the reality is that publicly owned utilities are rife with mismanagement and malinvestment.   Just making an assertion does not validate the truth of that assertion. I can play this game too.   Moving on, public and privately owned utilities are both susceptible to mismanagement and malinvestment - what matters most imo is the quality of the regulation governing them, the local political environment, and whether they are run independent of the local executive (governor, mayor, etc)."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,vdersar1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:16:19 2015 UTC,Just making an assertion does not validate the truth of that assertion. I can play this game too.   Which of my statements are not self-evident? Is it not self-evident that the government is the one who sets the encumbrances? Is it also not self-evident that the rife mismanagement and malinvestment by public agencies demonstrates that public agencies engage in mismanagement and malinvestment?   Are those statements not self-evident with the facts at hand?    public and privately owned utilities are both susceptible to mismanagement and malinvestment   Private utilities can FAIL when they suffer these conditions. Public utilities cannot. That is the major distinction - a poorly performing private utility will be taken over by new management; public won't.
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,ChaosMotor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:20:39 2015 UTC,The same argument most liberals have against capitalism. Profits and greed.
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,clear831,2,Wed Jul 15 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"...   You realize you can't profit if your source of revenue costs more to operate than people will pay, right?   Please present me an argument that is logical and consistent. ""Well but that's what liberals argue"" doesn't make it a good argument."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,ChaosMotor,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"I am all for privatization, my only concern is that when its 1 water company in the city they have a monopoly, they can control the prices (raise them at will) and neglect the services (services become poor). They dont have to necessarily let it fall apart, but it can get so bad that the quality is very poor.  This can also happen with public services and it does happen, look at the quality of the roads in most areas."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,clear831,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"my only concern is that when its 1 water company in the city they have a monopoly, they can control the prices (raise them at will) and neglect the services (services become poor).   Why do you think they would have a monopoly? My city has the public water service and two private water services. This seems to keep them all honest and constantly investing."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,ChaosMotor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"For smaller cities, under 250k, I dont see how you would have multiple options to choice from to get your water. Its like the power grid, its all connected."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,clear831,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"... my city has a population of 30K people sooooo...  Not trying to be rude but ""I don't understand how"" is not equivalent to ""that cannot be done""."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,ChaosMotor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:47:55 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I like it when cities place their utilities under city-owned corporations. The utilities are free to operate without interference as a business, but with the added protection from price-gouging. Plus, any profit that is made either goes back to the city or is reinvested in the system."
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,heimkev,0,Thu Jul 16 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"Good point. After all, Enron did a smashing job after California privatized its electricity utilities, right?"
Infrastructurist,3d9f1d,Reddiphiliac,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:53:48 2015 UTC,What an insane claim; Enron was only able to engage in its shenanigans because of its relationships with government agencies.
Infrastructurist,3ct0lv,stefeyboy,3,Fri Jul 10 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, I never knew how good we had it with Washington Union Station. Some of those stations are just pathetic.   I did not know that Penn Station used to actually look nice. Now the interior resembles a soviet weapons bunker."

Infrastructurist,3ct0lv,geeklantern,2,Sat Jul 11 13:43:12 2015 UTC,That was a pretty serious dig at Louisiana at the end. I feel burned.
Infrastructurist,3ct0lv,card797,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:00:53 2015 UTC,"I had a hunch Cleveland would be on the list. I only went there once in 2010, but it might have been 1972 walking in there. Oh, and it's only accessible by a sudden hairpin exit ramp from one direction on the shoreway."
Infrastructurist,3ct0lv,Oatybar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"Some of these don't look that bad to me, although a couple of them are horrible. Half the beauty of riding the train are the simple stations, which really don't need to be larger than a convenience store unless the station is a major hub."
Infrastructurist,3ctdeq,stefeyboy,2,Fri Jul 10 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"All the calls for more federal funding for transportation talk about maintenance, but when the money is doled out the majority is used for expansion. It's pretty hard to justify throwing money at the transportation system until the existing funding is being used more responsibly."
Infrastructurist,3csljg,stefeyboy,5,Fri Jul 10 13:04:06 2015 UTC,Another part of this problem is that the roads near many stations are not pedestrian-friendly. Some don't even have sidewalks that go past the parking lot!
Infrastructurist,3csljg,burlap_pterodactyl,2,Fri Jul 10 13:43:48 2015 UTC,Or a parking lot big enough to handle the local population driving to the station.
Infrastructurist,3csljg,red_tux,4,Fri Jul 10 14:21:44 2015 UTC,The whole point here is its more effective for ridership to have a community of people around the station than a community of cars.
Infrastructurist,3csljg,BBnet3000,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure about that. If you eliminate parking then you eliminate 90% of potential users. Building up the area is good too, but only if you retain the parking and just put it into multi story garages instead of surface lots."
Infrastructurist,3csljg,cracked_mud,5,Fri Jul 10 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"If you eliminate parking then you eliminate 90% of potential users.   Most of whom are going to take the car to their final destination for the cost of gas rather than switch vehicles and pay a fare. Transit-oriented development works, or so the academic literature says. That's not to say that there isn't a place for park and ride or that some of those TOD locations shouldn't have parking garages."
Infrastructurist,3csljg,BBnet3000,2,Fri Jul 10 16:29:07 2015 UTC,This is New Jersey we're talking about here. Traffic is ungodly and tolls are everywhere. Not to mention that sufficient parking doesn't even exist in NYC even if you wanted to drive in. Even going to Philadelphia by car is quite hard. I took the train last week and my sister drive. I paid $6 for the train and she paid $20 for parking. The fare is a fraction of parking and the time for an entire trip on NJT from the suburbs into NYC is less than the morning delays on any of the car tunnels.
Infrastructurist,3csljg,cracked_mud,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"Rush hour trips are not all trips, and even during rush hour a whole lot o' people drive from New Jersey into NYC via the bridge and 2 tunnels.  When I went to NYU I could always tell when there was a rainstorm coming from the west when you would see wet cars in the village with Jersey plates (presumably having come from the Holland tunnel)."
Infrastructurist,3csljg,BBnet3000,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Most of NJT is pointed at NYC, though. I know where my parents live the only practical train to Philly is Amtrak from Metropark."
Infrastructurist,3csljg,Eurynom0s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:40:54 2015 UTC,NYC is far less car friendly in every possible respect..
