footballdownload,374ils,GrabbingTheBrassRing,8,Sun May 24 20:21:47 2015 UTC,Totally true! We'll keep this in mind and try to be as spoiler-free as possible! :)
footballdownload,374ils,highlightsbot,5,Sun May 24 21:21:13 2015 UTC,"An example from today.  I can see already when I am clicking onto the full match video that it isn't going to end 3-3, and it's quite unlikely that there is more than one goal in the match. If one team had scored, I would basically know the result.  http://i.imgur.com/DGeo0Cr.png"
footballdownload,374ils,PrivateMajor,6,Sun May 24 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed, I basically have to squint my eyes when choosing links in here - which sort of defeats the purpose."
footballdownload,374ils,CompAcct,1 point,Sun May 24 21:06:43 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with the squinting - also find myself doing it once I click the links so that I won't get any video thumbnail spoilers or something silly.
footballdownload,374ils,highlightsbot,2,Mon May 25 05:36:13 2015 UTC,"You are right to a certain extent, but it also seems that you're reading too much into it. Example   If the highlights video is listed as being only 1 minute 30, and a goal is scored, you basically know that the match will end 1-0.   I can't agree completely with that. Yes sometimes it's true, but sometimes it's not. I've seen as much as 6 goals in 30 seconds video and 1 goal or no goals in 6 minutes video. So you can never really know. There is a huge variety of sources that we use apart from the highlights we make ourselves. Every one of them has it's own way of assembling their video.  Anyway, now that the season is almost over, we`ll have a lot of time to think about this and improve if possible, but meanwhile don't let the length of a given video draw you to conclusions and spoil the result for you."

However,   For NBA: We don't need a sub for NBA games thanks to www.NBAHD.com, which usually posts the games (spoiler-free) within three hours of their end, in HD quality. I don't work for them but goddamn is that an amazing site. There is also an r/nbastreams. You should also check out DavkaBT for full match NBA torrents.  NHL: You should check out r/NHLstreams. They don't always have a lot for full match downloads, but they're still useful. If you check the subreddit before during a game, there is a spoiler-free gamethread just for links to the games. They get deleted a little while after each game ends.   Also, always check out rojadirecta and go to the 'descarga partidos completos' forum. It's poorly organized but almost always has what you're looking for with NHL and NBA playoffs, not to mention lots of soccer.  @Harimau, make sure you are looking in the nbaSTREAMS subreddit and not just the general NBA gamethread. The stream subreddits, as a rule, don't contain spoilers."

footballdownload,352csp,Kevin--Flynn,5,Wed May 6 20:52:24 2015 UTC,"GOD DAMNIT, JUST AS I WROTE MY SCRIPT  Well, sharing it anyways.  $.get(location.href, function(response){      response = $(response);     response.find('.sitetable .usertext').each(function(i, e) {          if ( $(e).html().indexOf('http') !== -1 ) alert(""IT'S COMING HOME"")     });  });"
footballdownload,352csp,acoard,4,Wed May 6 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"THAT'S RAD! ..  php . but where would you 'run' this ? .. so I copy it, and then ?"
footballdownload,352csp,frompit,4,Wed May 6 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"This is JavaScript, so you could put it in your 'developer tools' in your browser.  In Chrome, easiest way to get there is right click on the page > Inspect Element.  You want to put this in the console, which is a live javascript terminal.  So click the 'Console' tab (it's on the grey bar at the top of the dev tools, the furthest right of the text tabs).  After that, just paste it in.  The code isn't 100% complete.  As I was testing it I got some positives and was like, ""oh great, code isn't working"", but it turns out it was, hah.  Anyways, all that's left is making sure it REPEATEDLY checks, because this only checks once.  Thankfully JavaScript makes this easy.  setInterval(function(){     $.get(location.href, function(response){          response = $(response);         response.find('.sitetable .usertext').each(function(i, e) {              if ( $(e).html().indexOf('http') !== -1 ) alert(""IT'S COMING HOME"")         });      }); }, 5000)   The setInterval part says ""call this part repeatedly"", the 5000 at the end is how frequently you want to call it in milliseconds.  As for the main logic, what it does is it downloads the current page and scans the reddit comments, seeing if any contain the phrase ""http"".  If they do, it sends an alert to the browser.  edit: screenshot"
footballdownload,352csp,acoard,2,Wed May 6 21:32:28 2015 UTC,"I just tried it. Yes it works obviously! It alerted me four times which i assume is because there are four links that are posted by highlightsbot.    Also, one may not refresh the page after pasting the code, yeah?   I thought it was php whenever I saw the dollar sign get function. I should have continued to read further and see the alert js function.   edit: grammar  either way, clean and cool work!"
footballdownload,352csp,frompit,2,Wed May 6 21:43:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right.  Not only will it give multiple alerts 'cause if finds duplicates, but also it never stops checking.  Another 5 seconds rolls around, another 4 alerts would come up.  But, it's just a quick script anyways.   Also, one may not refresh the page after pasting the code, yeah?   Correct, refreshing the page clears all the javascript.  The site's javascript will all run again because you just re-downloaded the site, but your javascript will be purged.     I thought it was php whenever I saw the dollar sign get function. I should have continued to read further and see the alert js function.   I was wondering why you said php! PHP uses the dollar sign everywhere.  Every variable has to start with a $.  So not a bad guess at all.  The other most popular use of the dollar sign is an incredibly popular JavaScript library called jQuery.  For convenience it takes the $, but you could replace the $ in my code with the phrase jQuery and it should still work.  Part of me wonders about creating a small chrome extension with this functionality.  Not as ham-fisted of course, but just a ""alert me once someone posts a link in this thread"" switch.  meh, I probably wouldn't even use it.  Just looking for an excuse to make a simple chrome extension.  Anyways, thanks man, now to watch the game!"

Makes it a bit of a pain if it takes a while to download or you have limited time. And also it's just nicer to watch all at once.   That being said I realize there are no better solutions.

The third link is either a link to ET if it exists, or a link to the 1st half again if there is no ET.  You can use a link anonymizer to hide the ET link and make it look different, or maybe just rickroll people with the third link for matches with no ET.  For me, I had the result of ET spoiled because someone posted a 'post-match' link which I thought was their way of hiding the fact that there was ET."

He didn't understand how big those names were because at that time he was only watching Premier League.  A lot of those Milan players were over 30 at the time of that final.    Dida was my idol when I first started watching soccer.  When he just broke down in the second half I died a bit inside.
