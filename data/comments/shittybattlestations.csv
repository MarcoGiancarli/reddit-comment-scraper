shittybattlestations,3dnj7p,lilpanda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"I moved, and my 2 year old liked to hang down on it and sorta bounce.  The back piece ripped out from the leg and hung there pulling down the main board and causing it to bend. The wood is cheap, so the screws ripped out fairly easy, but as long as you don't move it around too much after building it you should be ok. periodically check the screws as well cause I had a few get loose that made the whole desk wobbly, but that could have easily been from my son using it as a jungle gym. If you are looking for a cheap reliable desk, the one I just bought is only $45 and is very well built."

The chair especially. About 5 more minutes of work to throw out the most obvious trash (empty boxes, garbage bag, empty drinks). 5 more minutes to at least organized and stack the rest of the clutter. It would look and feel completely different, and maybe take two to four hours of work total. Considering how much time people spend trying to upgrade their in-game characters to be more efficient and have better equipment, this seems like a good use of time. It will actually help a person game more and game happier, in the long run. The clutter isn't actually that outrageous. It doesn't look like a person with severe hoarding tendencies.

Has an avago optical sensor. Is extremely light weight. It's my go to mouse for a lot of my games. Some other games might need more keys so i'll use a logitech g502 for it.

shittybattlestations,3d3v1w,Pyromaniacal13,21,Mon Jul 13 09:58:37 2015 UTC,"It started off as my dad's laptop, but HP being what they are, the cable connecting the screen to the mobo tore off after two years (basically taped onto the bottom of the screen, and once it tears off it can't be put back). I salvaged it and carried it around as my laptop for a while. Every time I needed to use it, I would ""borrow"" one of the screens at school and connect a VGA cable I carried around with me. Over time exposure to my clumsiness tore off most of the WiFi antennae (the white wire is what's left of them)  At one point, my desktop died, meaning I was stuck with this monster for about a month while I got a new rig. The laptop was hooked up to an old TV on one side, and my KB/Mouse/etc on the other. However, the computer only has one functional USB port. My keyboard (Das Keyboard S) has a hub attached to it, and two USB plugs, one for the keyboard and one for the hub. So I connected the hub to the one functional USB port and my keyboard to itself. I think it's the only time this arrangement has actually worked."

shittybattlestations,3cycvd,erix84,2,Sun Jul 12 01:13:55 2015 UTC,Velcro works great as well.   In our case we are installing the SSD's in a bunch of business dells. Many have the plastic 3.5 inch tray/condoms that go around the drive and we just use the double sided tape to keep the SSD from bouncing around. In the past we had a lot where the drives mounted from the bottom where many of your standard 3.5 to 2.5 adapters wouldn't have worked anyway.
shittybattlestations,3cycvd,ccosby,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:31:03 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't the Velcro, but the glue used to hold the strips to the respective parts. It will wear out eventually (especially if there's a bit of heat). Same issue with tape."

I can't be bothered to measure an unfurled paperclip but I'm going to assume it's not long enough for half-wave.  c/2.4*109 = 0.125  = 12.5cm wavelength. So 6.25cm for half-wave or 3.125cm for quarter.

I love watching them perform; it's the pinnacle of athleticism, art, and teamwork in my opinion. However, I had my reasons for not doing, namely 1) I never reached that level as a player and 2) I wasn't prepared to fork over a few thousand dollars to spend my summer riding buses for days ln end.

Are you seeking to actually reduce room temperature, or do you simply want the room to feel cooler for the person inside?  Also, if you're bringing air in, you need an exhaust.  If you're blowing air out, you need air intake.   If it's 30C inside and 28C outside and you're using it as exhaust with no air intake, you're not going to be accomplishing much of anything."

Un-gzip the tinycore.gz to the filesystem and create a new initrd with only the drivers you need for that laptop. That would lower the RAM requirement.

shittybattlestations,36d58y,Wildeone1,2,Mon May 18 21:40:38 2015 UTC,I have the exact same laptop (purchased May 2009) on the exact same stand to keep it cool. I have it propped up enough to fit a desk fan underneath pointed up into the intake. Also I cut out some of those plastic coverings on the fan to help it take in more air.   Also I am on my 3rd battery. At this point I don't even put the battery in the thing because it is plugged in all the time.
shittybattlestations,36d58y,grizelin,1 point,Mon May 18 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"I didn't buy it to be portable, though originally the battery lasted reasonably well especially for being used.  Now it lasts just long enough for me to move it from the desk to bed when I want it there and as a basic UPS for power fluctuations.  As a computer it's actually pretty nice even by today's standards.  I  went to 8GB of ram, I want to go to an SSD and maybe buy a mini-PCIe to PCIe adapter and try a large external video card on it just for laughs"
shittybattlestations,36d58y,grizelin,2,Mon May 18 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"Yes it holds up quite well. I still have 4GB of RAM, but I just replaced the HDD because it was getting quite full. I considered upgrading the RAM but I would have had to buy 2x4GB.  So I just built a new desktop instead. ;)"

Here's the kind of guy he is.  When I picked it up it was wrapped back in the original packaging, including all of the documentation and accessories.  There was also a little baggie including the original ram (because he'd upgraded) and the original hard drive (because he upgraded it to SSD).  Oh, and before he packaged it away he did a fresh install of the most current OS on both drives to make sure I had a clean start.  He's one of the few people I have no issues buying used stuff from..."

shittybattlestations,365896,BullyJack,10,Sat May 16 14:18:48 2015 UTC,choice or not by choice? can you please share us about your experience? I gots to know!
shittybattlestations,365896,kevinpilgrim,68,Sat May 16 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"Sure. I'm your stereotypical white trash guy, especially growing up. Parents beat on me, foster care (which was cool as fuck, not all foster parents are abusive) and was in jail and detention centers from ten years old on. Got emancipated at 15 and dropped out of high school at 17. That's the background that made me I guess better off at being homeless. I was on probation, lost my job at 18 which obviously fucked me out of my apartment. I'd traveled around a little before and was in violation of the terms of my probation so I went nomad. Walked around the area  hitch hiking checking out punk shows and getting fuckall drunk and fucked up. Generally I stayed close to my hometown and couched it with friends until a cop that had arrested me before saw me in town and took my ass to jail. I tried to run even but had no chance. I got into dumpster diving and salt of the earth living, went to soup kitchens, did random labor for food and cash, all sorts of weird shit. My hometown is desolate as fuck so work was scarce even for high school grads. I got out of jail after I turned 19, had nowhere to go so I joined a carnival. Whackamole was my job. Barking at people all day with whack it jokes. So fun. Traveled up and down the east coast. Got back and couldn't find work so I went nomad and lived all over my area. At one point I was camping in a state park on this huge hill full of pine trees with one spot that someone had grown grass after cutting down a few trees so it was this beautiful green camp spot near the big pond at the bottom of the hill. I'd wake up, eat, and go swim naked in the pond, get covered in good black mud which kept bugs off from the smell I guess. It was by choice at that point and I loved it most of the time. Being a hick helped since I know the woods well enough to not get caught up in the drugs and shit of urban homelessness. Not to say I didn't sleep outside in cities sometimes. Usually I had people to feed me or give me fresh socks or whatever. It was fun. And it made me tough. 2 years ago I was ""homeless"" for 3 months sleeping in my truck with my dog at jobsites (carpenter) because I finished out my lease at my one apartment and had paid for my next but it wasn't ready since it was a new build. So my gf went to her moms and I went wherever. It was fun as fuck unless I was short on gas. Then it gets stressful because you're looking at a tow fee if you can't move your vehicle and you have no address for the cops. But it was fun. I can be airdropped into almost any situation ass naked and probably survive. I can make fire with a bow and drill, know edible plants, know how to jump on trains, can speak almost anyone's cultural English (hope that makes sense) and I work with my hands for a living. I wouldn't trade it for a trust fund that's for sure. Feel free to ask more if you want."

shittybattlestations,35zr68,The7thOne,5,Fri May 15 07:33:35 2015 UTC,Not sure what you think is shitty about this. That laptop looks like the HP Beats Touch which has a fairly decent AMD quad core/radeon combo.   The controller is from a Neo-Geo X. If he has the other part of it then its not a bad way to play older Neo-Geo games. Looks like there is a Dreamcast up there as well. Really the only lower end piece of this is the Polaroid TV but it seems to work fine.
shittybattlestations,35zr68,Klankins,3,Thu May 14 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"My brother is the person who thought it was shitty, I even told him that it belonged on Average Battlestations.  That is the Beats Touch laptop. And yes, he does have a Neo Geo X, another controller for it, and the Mega Pack. He told me to not mention Neo Geo X because he didn't want to get laughed at by people (a lot of people hate the Neo Geo X.)"
shittybattlestations,35zr68,Klankins,3,Thu May 14 22:39:42 2015 UTC,I always thought the Neo-Geo X was a cool little system. It was just unfortunately priced and the library of games they made available was not big enough. They did a great job of making it look like the original. If only they had included an actual cart slot that interfaced with the little handheld (sort of like the Retron5 does) then it would have been an instant classic.
shittybattlestations,35zr68,MrScottyTay,1 point,Thu May 14 22:46:10 2015 UTC,wasn't the Neo Geo X awesome? why would he be laughed at for having that. that's an awesome system to own!

If this guy can run TF2 on much higher settings at 30FPS, you can run it at 60 on medium.  Edit: Also, run msconfig.exe and disable anything in the Startup tab that doesn't need to start when your computer does, this includes almost everything.

I ended up using Linux Mint for awhile, which I seemed to have decent gaming performance with. So that pretty much secured the idea that it was a driver issue with Windows 8, but there was no easy way to fix it, as uninstalling and reinstalling drivers only worked for a little while.  I ended up doing a fresh install of Windows 8, which seemed to fix most of my issues.  It actually runs everything surprisingly decent now."

shittybattlestations,35im29,GG_Shookup,3,Tue May 12 22:46:00 2015 UTC,You have no idea what the values of these pc's since no specs are list and a lot of play on TN panel monitors. Peripherals are all preference anyways. Someone could have pretty standard peripherals and a nice pc and be fine with it since it'll literally just preference. I have a friend who has a $1400 desktop and has a $10 keyboard because he likes it and if he spills a drink on it or something he can just replace it easily with a trip to walmart. All we see is the computer case in this here image so that tells us nothing about whats inside. It's perfectly normal to have a nice case but only have a $400-500 computer. Nothing is odd about this picture you're just making irrational assumptions. Also if you look at the second posted picture the computer near the window is a pretty ordinary looking laptop that you can't tell anything about it's specs because it's the outside.
shittybattlestations,35im29,argote,0,Mon May 11 01:13:55 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about these PCs in particular.
shittybattlestations,35im29,GG_Shookup,1 point,Mon May 11 01:33:11 2015 UTC,Then you should state your context. Also the TN panel reference makes 0 sence when lots of people with expensive machines use TN panel monitors for the faster response times.

shittybattlestations,359vpl,LumberCockSucker,9,Fri May 8 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"On consumer speakers and headphones they are generally tuned in some way shape or form, similar to how some people may turn up the bass or treble on their car stereo because they prefer that sound. However this is bad for audio production because if you mix on a set of speakers that have a large bass boost, when someone listens to your track on speakers without the same bass boost, the track will sound hollow and tinny. Using neutral and accurate speakers to mix ensures a consistent listening experience for the end user.  For the more advanced users: ""b-but muh dynamics!"""

I originally used it for my desktop, but it became difficult to take notes on a chapter and have a keyboard out. A simple conclusion to this was moving the keyboard away, but if I had to use the computer for something I had to plug it back in. This became quite the hassle, so I decided for now I'll just make a temporary battle station elsewhere while I can focus on work for now.  I was planning on using the rig im typing on for now as a desk for school, but it's not enough room for me to take notes and read the book. So I use part of my bed now to hold the keyboard.

I'm not sure that the thing qualifies as a TM under any interpretation. It certainly isn't Turing complete, which afaik would refer to an abstract model of the thing, if it could be applied at all. So even more mysterious is how would one legitimately apply these terms to (what I think is) just a kind of differential gauge.  Arguably, the human operator makes it hardware for our cognitive equivalent to a UTM. So my title was a damn lie. I'm sorry, Grandpa!"
shittybattlestations,3312b8,thepasttenseofdraw,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"Turing completeness:       In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine. The concept is named after English mathematician Alan Turing. A classic example is lambda calculus.  A closely related concept is that of Turing equivalence –  two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. Thus, a Turing-complete system is one that can simulate a Turing machine. According to the Church–Turing thesis, which conjectures that the Turing machines are the most powerful computing machines, for every real-world computer there exists a Turing machine that can simulate its computational aspects.  Universal Turing machines can simulate any Turing machine and by extension the computational aspects of any possible real-world computer.  To show that something is Turing complete, it is enough to show that it can be used to simulate some Turing complete system. For example, an imperative language is Turing complete if it has conditional branching (e.g., ""if"" and ""goto"" statements, or a ""branch if zero"" instruction. See OISC) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of memory locations (e.g., the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of variables). Since this is almost always the case, most (if not all) imperative languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.

I can not play any other way. But lately I have been watching a lot of YouTube channels on computer parts and peripherals and supposedly a mouse pad and mechanical keyboard and a good mouse make all the difference. I'm also told that cs:go  is way different on a monitor. My view distance is terrible and everyone is an any if they aren't standing in front of me
shittybattlestations,31r1rr,Kriss729,2,Tue Apr 7 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"I'm around 1000~ hours on CSGO, with a few hundred on previous iterations. Its become an expensive hobby, my latest hardware update was a $600~ 144hz monitor, prior to that a $200~ keyboard, and I've gone through a fair few mice looking for my perfect match. Granted I'm also studying in IT and spend a lot of time on my machines regardless, but I'd be lying if I said CSGO didn't directly influence some of my recent choices.  Obviously its just a game and you should play on whatever you want, although at some point if you want to play competitive at a reasonably higher level you will probably benefit from a desk with a decent keyboard, mouse, and monitor.  You should check out /r/globaloffensive. It can be a bit toxic at times, and there is quite a bit of lingo to pick up, but its a good place to start learning some more advanced techniques and discuss the pro scene. GL,HF!"

The character design and figure drawing were made by shinia, the dōjin painter, and the dubbing work by Minmin Yao.  At first, Hikaru Aizawa was one of Microsoft Taiwan's ""2010 Tech Days"" campaign plannings, but immediately after its launch it received a wide response from Taiwan and Japan, which made Microsoft Taiwan decide to propose the character settings of three elder sisters, Yu, Aoi, and Lei, one after another. Afterwards, Microsoft Taiwan continuously conducted a series of official campaigns, including related software, special wallpapers, webpage games, related activities and amateur parties.

shittybattlestations,30p9uj,InsidetheCentre,4,Sun Mar 29 16:18:45 2015 UTC,The keyboard for the Macbook Air is just temporary until my work PC is sent over (apparently it's a security risk to VPN in from an unsecured network but it's not a security risk to just send the entire PC over by mail and hook it up to said unsecured network...). The keyboard for the laptop is because it fits right over the laptop keyboard so I can use it when moving around. I also sometimes use it on my main PC for gaming as the form factor is better a lot of the time.

I only got it a couple weeks ago, and I am quite happy with it, particularly the clutched scroll wheel.  Within five minutes of first using the mouse I knew I could never go back to a non-clutched wheel.  I also love that you can plug it in and charge while you play off of any Micro-USB cord. If you're in the market for a wireless gaming mouse, this is the choice.  If you like wires, there's a logitech with the same clutch and other features, plus a cord, plus a custom weighting system. I think it's optical instead of laser, and I can't think of the number right now.  PS I only paid $70 CAD for mine brand new, so I suggest not spending the $99 USD Newegg wants right now."

I find myself trying to kill things in real time, because that just seems the more natural way to me, even though it's much harder. Even other games that do have some sort of time manipulation, you can't rely solely on it. Transistor is damn near unplayable without it though. When you're in the heat of battle, you don't wanna pause it to plan your moves out really carefully, you wanna just go go go! It feels chunky and not fluid the way it is. I think mainly I don't like the combination of those two things together."

I've been playing Dragon Age Inquisition and I don't think I've used the tactical camera, so when playing Transistor, I go real time too. But I've been forced to use the turn mechanic when the enemies got a bit harder. And I slowly learnt how to control and decide what to do. I didn't even know how to do it at first.

The trick here is you have to combine a couple of cracks after installing, then choose one computer to copy the folder from and overwrite the folders on everyone else's computer.

shittybattlestations,2z6ree,asheppard308,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean with the sub. I would have it on the ground, but my bed is right next to my desk and no room underneath, and a wall is opposite the left. By putting it up there I was saving foot room.  Thanks for the advice though.   Forza is such a good game. I've flogged some hours into it too over the years. Not so much online, just versing Ghosts or split screen really. I've never had this much joy out of any other racing games. Even the previous Forza and current games."
shittybattlestations,2z6ree,asheppard308,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:16:32 2015 UTC,I have no clue how many hours I played each Forza game since 2. Never played 5 or the Horizon series though. I would get home from school around 4:00pm and hop online with some buddies. Play until midnight. go to sleep and do it again the next day. every damn day. I did that for a long time. On the weekends I'd start playing around noon and play until I was falling asleep. I once stayed up about 48 hours doing some racing at Le Mans with a huge group of 50 people.   I used to use my subwoofer as a foot rest for a while. I got a bigger desk so now it sits out of reach though.
shittybattlestations,2z6ree,asheppard308,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:07:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is dedication. Sounds so fun though. I never really had a lot of people on XBL, I was more of a PS3 guy. But from what I did play online was brutally fun.   I would try the foot rest idea. But I'm around 6'4 and this desk is pretty tiny. If I have my feet flat on the floor, I only just have enough room to fin my arm down to scratch my leg. But I'll probably take your advice and make some room under my bed for it. I would like to use the space for storage."
shittybattlestations,2z6ree,asheppard308,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got a 360 cause that's what my step-dad played on. We played a lot of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 together.   putting the woofer under bed may work. but it also may not work. From what I've experienced it's better to have it centered compared to the speakers. but try it out and see how it goes! bass is omnidirectional. having it on the floor helps by also being able to feel the vibrations through your feet and legs. if that makes any sense. makes for a more immersive experience."
shittybattlestations,2z6ree,nonSexyMexican,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:59:03 2015 UTC,"That would have been good fun, I've not played a lot of the series but I did enjoy what I did play.  Well I was thinking it'd work quite well because it is a down facing sub. And that way when I'm listening to music, I can feel it through my bed better. It'll be as close to the desk as I can get it so I can still get full effect while PC gaming."

Add damn, 720P isn't bad though. I played at that res for years before upgrading to my previous BenQ monitor and a HD 7870 2GB (in the first PC I ever built a few years ago). The BenQ monitor I have now is the one up from the last.  For the first few days I was running just it, it was actually just yesterday when I posted the pics was when I decided to use the spare monitor I got with the DELL PC and a second display. And the card hasn't taken any noticeable performance hit at all.  As for YouTube in bed, I have my PS3 or PS4 and even a chromecast."
shittybattlestations,2z6ree,nbarrager,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:04:43 2015 UTC,Yeah. I got my gt 520 from the second hand pc place for $15. the whole computer cost me $117 after everything.

This with the folded over blanket mattress the 2 pillows used to prop yourself up, the giant lady bug pillow, and the lack of an actual mouse pad.

shittybattlestations,2y9drf,Hotglue89,5,Sun Mar 8 02:01:44 2015 UTC,"220v service is more efficient in several ways.  It suffers less loss overall, and it carries more energy per amp, meaning wires can be thinner, saving copper (which is expensive).  Insulation has to be thicker too, but that's much cheaper and easier.  Most of Europe uses 220v, it's slightly more dangerous in a few specific situations but generally the electrical system design compensates for it (for example, look at the over-engineered super-safe UK plug)."

The claims that the company makes about their products have been a topic of dispute amongst audiophiles (people who really care about sound quality) and professionals since the company started in 1978.

The world is filled with computer cases you could easily get for ten bucks or less, even just as a temporary one, but y'all insist on laying the parts out on the wrong side of an anti-static bag or in carboard. Smh. But shitty indeed."
shittybattlestations,2xi0rv,Kyzzz,9,Sat Feb 28 21:55:09 2015 UTC,Hmm... My Y50 has never had cooling issues.. I just replaced the thermal paste today because I didnt trust lenovo with their job...
shittybattlestations,2xi0rv,goldswimmerbj,3,Sun Mar 1 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"Doing repairs I've never seen a Lenovo with poorly applied thermal paste, I've seen Acer totally forget it though."
shittybattlestations,2xi0rv,liquidcooledpotato,3,Sun Mar 1 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"The thermal paste looked well done when I took it apart, I just felt that my aftermarket paste would do a better job, made like a 5C difference so Im happy."
shittybattlestations,2xi0rv,goldswimmerbj,2,Sun Mar 1 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"It's good to be prudent and make sure your thermal paste is doing an optimal job, but I'd imagine that 5C drop will go away once the paste solidifies a little after some use. Since it's still more liquid, its thermal conductivity is higher, after it dries it will probably go back to normal :)"
shittybattlestations,2xi0rv,liquidcooledpotato,2,Sun Mar 1 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm... interesting... I always thought that the paste had a short break in period, then worked best until it slowly dried out..."
shittybattlestations,2xi0rv,goldswimmerbj,2,Sun Mar 1 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just when it's wet it transfers heat slightly better. Like when you put a beer in the freezer and wrap a wet paper towel around it to make it get cold faster."
shittybattlestations,2xi0rv,liquidcooledpotato,2,Sun Mar 1 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"HP Omen? I doubt it, looks more ASUS-ish, but it looks similar."

It had a 500 watt version of your power supply. And I had the computer on its side, when I looked inside to make sure I had hooked up all of the fans correctly, there was one fan not spinning, and that was on the psu. It then, right then and there, proceeded to blow a capacitor and launch a spark high into my room, it landed on the white plastic (graduation party style) table that I had it sitting on. It then melted a bit of the table. And after that my room smelled like burnt plastic and electronics.   ;TLDR I had the same brand of power supply, and it exploded.  Stay Safe!"

It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.  The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations. In practice, almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away. Often the fast, volatile technologies (which lose data when powered off) are referred to as ""memory"", while slower permanent technologies are referred to as ""storage"", but these terms are often used interchangeably. In the Von Neumann architecture, the CPU consists of two main parts: control unit and arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory; the latter performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.    Image i - 1 GB of SDRAM mounted in a personal computer.

shittybattlestations,2w3jun,ruxahn,2,Mon Feb 16 21:28:52 2015 UTC,I'm not too confident in taking apart the laptop THAT much.  I did ask about the tower updates and it was just simply too obsolete. Literally. To be able to make it useful for photoshopping and the like required me to purchase a new MoBo and CPU set. Got no money for that so we just went ahead and made it useful in a different way.  I do have some artic silver I believe from when I tried to swap out some of the processor between one other old tower I had access to.

It is designed to use the expanded 64-bit memory address space provided by the x86-64 architecture.   The primary benefit of moving to 64-bit is the increase in the maximum allocatable random access memory (RAM). Windows XP 32-bit is limited to a total of 4 gigabytes. Although the theoretical memory limit of a 64-bit computer is about 16 exabytes (16 billion gigabytes), Windows XP x64 is limited to 128 GB of physical memory and 16 terabytes of virtual memory.  Windows XP Professional x64 Edition uses the same kernel and code tree as Windows Server 2003  and is serviced by the same service pack.  However, it includes client features of Windows XP such as System Restore, Windows Messenger, Fast User Switching, Welcome Screen, Security Center and games, which Windows Server 2003 does not have.  Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is not to be confused with Windows XP 64-bit Edition, as the latter was designed for Itanium architecture.   During the initial development phases, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was named Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for 64-Bit Extended Systems.

The only they have on modern high end monitors is refresh rate and response time, and unless you're gaming on a competitive level it doesn't matter.   Also you ruined that IBM keyboard."
shittybattlestations,2v542x,StarFscker,6,Sun Feb 8 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true.   First off, this monitor is from 1998, you shouldn't have to wait 15 years for modern technology to catch up to the old technology.   Second, modern IPS and PLS monitors do not match a crt in viewing angles, and crt still holds the crown on color quality.  Third, a CRT monitor at the resolution I have is usually less than 20 bucks, even in great condition. A PLS Monitor is the cheapest bang-for-the-buck 1440p monitor you can get, and it's about 300 dollars.  Fourth, you can't really get monitors at 4x3 resolutions nowadays, not with these resolutions.   Fifth, I like my keyboard. Go fuck yourself."

Third, 20 bucks for a 40 pound peace of shit that gives you eye strain and and headache from the flicker. No thank you, I'd rather pay $300 for a piece of modern tech that does everything that CRT does but better in most aspects.   Fourth. There's a reason 4:3 isn't a thing anymore it's because widescreen is superior.  Fifth, you need to calm the fuck down. It looks like you desinged the tackiest color scheme you could think of then just took each set of keys and dipped them into a vat of paint. You ruined that keyboard."

Now, it's tough to get any appreciation on /r/battlestations if your setup isn't minimalist, dimly lit, and facing a skyline. In short, they're pretty elitist and picky.  That leads into /r/averagebattlestations, which functions a bit like a catch-all for decent mainstream setups that aren't ""IKEA"" enough for the previously mentioned sub.   /r/shittybattlestations tends to get the further overflow. A strange mix of nice PCs in crappy conditions, low-specced PCs in average conditions, and genuinely shitty battlestations.  The problem is, where does one draw the line? Is a Core2Duo-era Dell with a 17"" monitor on a Walmart desk really shitty, or is it more average? Does an i7-4790k with dual GTX 980s and a 32"" monitor count as shitty if you're using it on a cardboard box? It's still a nice PC, but it the conditions aren't exactly ""average"".

However the house is a bit too full with me in it too (7 people in a 4 bed place), the pressure I guess exploded and I'm going to pack up my stuff stay at a hostel in the next few days while I work out what to do - so the battle station gets packed away, no more Skyrim :("

shittybattlestations,2ujgzw,unafragger,5,Mon Feb 2 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this goes here, sorry if not.  I thought it was interesting.  Got an R9-290x and hated that it was running stock 95c (wth?!). So I got a (hand-me-down) G10 (the red bracket) and x41 (the all-in-one 140mm radiator/fan/pump on the top of the case) from NZXT.  Once I got it, I realized that it wouldn’t fit inside the case with the Corsair H60 that was already in there and the motherboard plugs at the top were also hitting it.  SO, I ended up mounting the fans on the outside of the case with the radiators and such on the inside.  It’s definitely not the most elegant of layouts, but it gets the job done.  I also upgraded my 550W PSU to a 750 because it was really starting to max it out, and didn’t want to anger the wife too much by also buying a new case, so this is the solution.  Mind the cable management, it’s an Antec Three Hundred so no windows or anything, I didn’t bother too much with cable / hose management other than to try to make sure it wasn’t blocking airflow too hard.  The 290x improved from having to scale back the clock speed to ~860-940 MHz or so to stay around ~92-94c to now running at a solid 58c at the full 1,000 MHz.  I’ll probably play a bit with the clock settings on it to see if I can get a little more out of it, but honestly, I don’t want to see it go TOO far over 60c, as I feel like that’s plenty hot enough.  Unfortunately, there’s no heatsinks on the memory now, so that runs a little hotter, maybe around 72-75c after about an hour of gaming.  Sounds like that’s not too bad of a deal, though."

shittybattlestations,2u6zrs,Mr6507,10,Fri Jan 30 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"It's connected via EXP GDC Beast - an external PCI-Express port that uses Express Card (standard in business grade laptops) slot to communicate with the laptop.   It works fairly well for most games with the exception of a few that need high GPU-NB bandwidth (borderlands 2 and Witcher 2 suffer a lot for example). The problem is that the link is only PCI-E 2x1 whereas normally you have PCI-E 2x16.   There's also a way of connecting eGPU via Thunderbolt 2 which has four times the bandwidth (PCI-E 3x2) and therefore almost no performance loss whatsoever. It is however way pricier (triple for the adapter) and also it's almost impossible to find Thunderbolt 2 enabled laptops for less than 1k USD.  BTW: Can play: Borderlands 2 high: 60FPS (sometimes dips even to 20 due to bandwidth problems), Metro 2034 Mid: 40-65 FPS, Witcher 2 (mid/high): 40 FPS ... in FullHD on business grade laptop.

What we really need is to make Intel to allow (if not actively promote) certified Thunderbolt-PCIE x4 full 75W adapters.

Also if I'm doing something that requires going though the same forms over and over I'll use them to help automate.    At a former job part of it was data entry (receiving inventory) and setting/confirming delivery appointments with freight carriers. The system we used was terrible so I would have to tab over the same fields over and over or fill them in with the same thing each time so I had it set so I could just go down the G keys and enter data where it was actually needed, saved me a ton on time."

Attached to it is a iball speaker. Below the laptop is a cooling pad with 5 USB out ports for extra stuff as laptop has only 2. Also attached to the laptop via USB is a Qi charger for my Nexus 4. Below on the table the wireless INTEX mouse and keyboard combo.

Also when I built my desktop, the ethernet kept yanking it off my desk. So I wanted something to hold them down. Needless to say I actually think it looks fine.

The cheapest case on amazon is around $16, used one on eBay should be below $10 and I bet that if you ask around somebody will have some old case and give it to you for free so you could keep your components safe.

shittybattlestations,2rvcbj,JimmyRichards,2,Fri Jan 9 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't buy the monitor, it was from an office that was throwing them away. The mouse was good for a while but then the left click began to give me problems and I had to take it apart and fix the switch."
shittybattlestations,2rvcbj,voneiden,3,Fri Jan 9 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"Those OMRON switches are pretty crap in terms of longetivity. I've fixed the copper plate on my left mouse switch three times and right mouse twice. Currently both buttons work OK, but the right side is really trigger happy.  I'm used to it, but if anyone else is using the mouse they'll be right clicking all over the place.  Most if not all mice on the market use the same damn switch that wears out due to metal fatigue sooner or later."
shittybattlestations,2rvcbj,voneiden,2,Sun Jan 11 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"My switch is plastic, so it's even worse..."
shittybattlestations,2rvcbj,voneiden,2,Sun Jan 11 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"Oh? Inside the switch? I guess I could be mistaken but I'm pretty sure most mouse switches are more or less the same.  Typically outside looks like this and the inside looks like this.  Clicking issues tend to be caused by slowly occurring metal fatigue on the copper plate. It can be fixed (temporarily) by twisting the copper plate back into better shape. The main difficulty comes from the copper plate being really thin, it's easy to accidentally damage it.  Here are good instructions on how to do it.  But there is of course always the risk that the copper plate gets damaged in the attempt.  Edit: or if you have a soldering iron handy, a new pair of switches doesn't cost much"
shittybattlestations,2rvcbj,voneiden,2,Sun Jan 11 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean the little white button. That eroded so I had to press harder to make the click, and it didn't sound as ""strong"" as before. I had to take it apart and straighten the plastic with a hot needle. It kinda fixed it, but not really."
shittybattlestations,2rvcbj,skaterman665,2,Sun Jan 11 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"Clever idea though. Some sort of strong glue (epoxy?) could have worked too. Anyway I edited my previous reply to include a link to the components themselves, you can get a pair from China for $1.

shittybattlestations,2rn1pq,PM_ME_YOUR_FAV_COLOR,38,Wed Jan 7 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"A little backstory: My family has always been poor, and my dad wanted to get me a computer for Christmas, which for us, was an absolute luxury.   I have been working at a grocery store that had decent pay, reasonable hours etc.   All I wanted was to feed my PC gaming fantasy, I can't really play PC games at all, but I really want to. I finally saved up $2,400 for my new setup, multiple monitors, 970's/980's, all that good stuff!   So after I saved up all the money I needed for a gaming PC, I quit my job, not as crazy as like: ""YEEAH! FUCK YOU BOSS!"" Because he was actually really nice. (Were Canadian)  My big sister and brother are over seas in Serbia, finishing school to get a job as a plumber. It's been kind of lonely without them here, even if I get alot more extra time on the computer, I just want em here, it's sucks.   While making a call to them, I have to hang up before the long distance charges get above the average, so I say goodbye and hangup, or so I thought...  I wake up in the morning hearing the beeping on the phone, I run over to hang up and find out later my phone bill is $3000 extra over the average I pay.   I gave up all my money I saved up, sold my skateboard, and my phone just to pay off the bill. So no awesome gaming PC for me until I get a new job and save up for another couple months.  But hey: At least I cleaned it up a bit..."

In that beautiful and portable rig you have a Nvidia GEforce 610M which can play games at a crystal 720P 30fps 60% of the time, every time on a 1280 x 720 widescreen. Game not running well on the card? Don't worry! There's a backup! Just run the game with the Intel HD 4000 and you'll have the silky smooth 20fps 1024 x 768 retro experience!  In the bottom left you have a limited edition, one of its kind, Xbox Arcade console (these are no longer sold, it's a true collecters item.) It is modified with the ""no case"" mod as well as the ""no screws in the drive"" mod meaning you can take the disc out whenever you want! No restrictions on your experience! It's even connected to a network bridge in your premium rig because this Xbox is so rare it doesn't have a wireless card!  Underneath you have an external fan, custom assembled for this particular rig. What's that? You don't want to use the tv on the couch?  Don't worry we've got you covered! Just reach behind the screen and find the FN and F8 keys and the monitor will switch over to the desk where you will be upgraded to a hearty 1366 x 768 monitor with a pair of Audio Technica headphones and the famous Blue Snowball mic!  You have an annoying cat that sits on your keyboard? Don't worry! We've got you. The rig comes with a cat bed underneath! The only thing weeping and crying out for attention will be your housemates after the magazines catch fire and burn down your house!"

shittybattlestations,2puou4,cbmuser,1 point,Sat Dec 20 16:16:44 2014 UTC,"Well, Celsius uses the same scaling as Kelvin, the definition of zero is just wrong.  You can easily use Celsius for any calculations without worrying about conversion problems."
shittybattlestations,2puou4,LonelyNixon,0,Sat Dec 20 20:44:39 2014 UTC,Yea but the fact that 0 is the freezing point of water makes it an arbitrary unit.
shittybattlestations,2puou4,cbmuser,3,Sat Dec 20 21:09:55 2014 UTC,"Well, yes. But not as arbitrary as using the body's temperature to set the 100 degree point.  The freezing and boiling points are very easy to understand and reproduce while the defining points for Fahrenheit are not.  There is a reason why Celsius is used everywhere in the world but the US. It's just more practical."

shittybattlestations,2p0ffe,RagingTroll1235,0,Sun Dec 14 02:01:24 2014 UTC,Put linux on 'em then. Windows is a resource hog
shittybattlestations,2p0ffe,Purplegill10,4,Mon Dec 15 18:42:59 2014 UTC,The point of these machines is to run some very old Windows applications that interface with some older ports on the machines - Linux wouldn't make sense.

It is fairly close to real snow, that has been groomed, and you really don't notice a difference.   From the control room we can control the pressure in the pipes on the hill and what is system is charged, meaning what pipes have water.  The air system is kinda like one big compressor tank that has valves all over it.    The guns are controlled on the mountain by snowmakers.  They see valves based on the temperate controlling the water to air ratio.  We have several type of gun on the mountain but they all work on the same principal.  Water and are are mixed to cause nucleation of ice particles that then grow as more water sticks to it."

shittybattlestations,2nep5o,Thorisgodpoo,3,Wed Nov 26 02:35:56 2014 UTC,"Fun fact: Male cats can develop barbs on their penasia, to keep them  lodged in the females vaginas during reproduction. This can make reproduction very painful for the female cat. What I'm trying to say here is that the furniture designer should get fucked by an ambush of tigers.  Fun fact #2: A group of tigers in called an ambush or a streak. I assume that ambush is used more often in literature, because it's cooler. I don't really know, I'm not a tiger scientist.   Fun Fact III: The rule of three describes a psychological phenomenon where humans show a marked preference for things that consist of three parts. There are examples of this throughout human culture and  history in many subject areas, including entertainment (the popularity of movie, game, and book trilogies), religion (the popularity of  triple deities such as the Christian Trinity, the Wiccan Triple Goddess, and the Roman Fates: Nona, Decima, and Morta), and in this post (there are three fun facts, each with three sentances, and this explanation uses three examples of the rule of three in culture each of which has three more examples). Three is a pretty crazy number."

shittybattlestations,2ncmjv,-NegativeZero-,1 point,Tue Nov 25 20:43:45 2014 UTC,"Link-local address:       In a computer network, a link-local address is a network address that is valid only for communications within the network segment (link) or the broadcast domain that the host is connected to.  Link-local addresses are usually not guaranteed to be unique beyond a single network segment. Routers therefore do not forward packets with link-local addresses.  For protocols that have only link-local addresses, such as Ethernet, hardware addresses that the manufacturer delivers in network circuits are unique, consisting of a vendor identification and a serial identifier.

I looked at the different colors, to see which one I liked. I noticed that the formerly flat and even tops on all of the display models were curved about half as much as OP's. Every single one. I suppose it could be excused if they were sitting on the floor, because I know how shoppers are, but no, these were on a shelf that was about 4 feet in the air. Nobody could reach them. Those desks are so shitty they bend like that with literally nothing on them. That doesn't stop them from selling them. In fact, they sell like crazy. I haven't figured out why.

As long as the mobo is good and the CPU decent all you need to do is update the GPU every few years.

It is a double-wide version of PCI, running at up to four times the clock speed, but is otherwise similar in electrical implementation and uses the same protocol.   It has been replaced in modern designs by the similar-sounding PCI Express (officially abbreviated as PCIe),  with a completely different connector and a very different logical design, being a single narrow but fast serial connection instead of a number of slower connections in parallel.

I found I had to pit a plank of wood to support the middle of it, or it sags too much under the weight of my monitor and printer. Be careful pushing against the back with your feet because I made that mistake and now the screw is exposed. The desk is covered in some very cheap imitation wood covering. It peels VERY easily and if you let liquid sit on it for too long, it peels even faster. Mine is super shaky and doesn't feel very solid. I've had mine for about a year and a half. My brother has the same one, and his has even more problems. Treat it well and it should keep you good for a few years. I'm currently looking for a new one."

shittybattlestations,2mcja8,rambi2222,2,Sun Nov 16 02:17:54 2014 UTC,"Right, my bad. Although, they're sometimes called tabletop vice grips, but I'm too tired to get into semantics. Plus, I usually just call it a vice, not sure what I was thinking earlier.  Anyway, yeah same."
shittybattlestations,2mcja8,echocage,2,Sat Nov 15 08:13:07 2014 UTC,"It's there because I needed something better than a jenky setup of vice grips clamping a length of metal to the table and the PCB I'm working on strapped to the metal.

shittybattlestations,2lxon5,28gh,2,Tue Nov 11 12:46:04 2014 UTC,Fujitsu FKB 4700. It's a buckling spring keyboard using Fujitsu Peerless switches. Force-wise they're on par with Cherry MX Clears.

shittybattlestations,2lxon5,jizz_is_my_hair_gel,2,Tue Nov 11 16:45:05 2014 UTC,I thought netbooks were the latest thing? What am I supposed to use nowadays?
shittybattlestations,2lxon5,jizz_is_my_hair_gel,3,Wed Nov 12 00:15:06 2014 UTC,"People in ~2008-2010 had netbooks, when there was no other device between smartphone and full sized notebook available. Netbooks were these pretty cheap (200-500€) 7-10"" notebooks with often too small keyboards to painlessly type on, ridiculously slow Intel Atom CPUs, and 1-2 GB RAM. Often they where shipped running Windows XP or Windows 7 Starter (max. 3 simultaneously executed programs, one couldn't change the god damn wallpaper etc.), neither of them were contemporary operating systems. These netbooks also where usually as thick as regular sized (13-17"") notebooks. Probably the most popular netbooks were the Asus Eee PC series, but there also were others like the Dell Mini series.  When the iPad arrived in 2010 nobody wanted netbooks anymore but tablets (especially iPads because Android tablets back then were rather crappy). When people realized they couldn't do everything they used to do on their notebooks on a tablet the demand for a fast enough, very thin and light notebook was there, so companies started to build ultrabooks.  Ultrabooks are these quite expensive (≥900 €), pleasantly thin (because of the lack of an optical drive) 11-14"" laptops with decent CPU, oftenly a SSD by default, sometimes touchscreens and quite long battery life. People ('casual' users) nowadays usually buy Ultrabooks like Asus Zenbook, Apple MacBook Air, Lenovo etc. rather than fat and heavy 15"" notebooks."
shittybattlestations,2lxon5,ZaInT,1 point,Wed Nov 12 01:03:07 2014 UTC,"It's all I've got. It's a ASUS EeePC 1005HAB (stock 160GB 5400rpm, 1GB RAM, WinXP - currently 60GB SATAII SSD, 2GB RAM, Win7HP 32bit).  The 'board is actually a Fujitsu FKB 4700. Still a buckling spring keyboard, but uses stiff Fujitsu Peerless switches."
shittybattlestations,2lxon5,ZaInT,1 point,Wed Nov 12 00:46:24 2014 UTC,"Jeez, my sympathies. I had my ASUS Eee PC 901 (4 + 8 GB crappy mSATA SSD, 1 GB RAM, Win XP, 1024*600 pixel) pimped out (32 GB fast mSATA SSD, 2 GB RAM, Xubuntu). It was still a pain to use, especially the too small keyboard. Hope you can afford a more contemporary computer anytime soon."

Anyways I was about to say your battlestation wasn't bad then I saw the lack of beers and that you guys are 14-15 years old. I wouldn't really call it a shitty battlestation, but a shitty party. Honestly though you're going to miss these parties in 10 years when it was just you and your bros. In just a few years time everyone is going to get a girlfriend that's going to want to follow their boyfriend wherever they go and you'll never really get a chill boys night like this ever again.  Actually that's not 100% accurate because you will get nights like this where all the guys can hang out, but the criminal investigation that your girlfriend will put you through will make you regret even going there in the first place.

shittybattlestations,2l2bdf,benes_the_menace,6,Sun Nov 2 18:53:20 2014 UTC,"Not at all. Windows 8 is much faster performance wise, much more stable than Windows 7 (and that's saying a lot as Win7 is quite stable itself).  What you're talking about is the Metro UI (as it was once called). If you do not like it, you don't have to use it. Win8.1 lets you skirt it completely, and I find keyboard shortcuts to be much faster in looking for my programs on the Metro UI (better than start menu).  But if start menu is your thing, you can easily install a free start menu that works just as good.  If you ever have a chance to get Windows 8/8.1, do so and then make these changes. You'll gain considerable ""under the hood"" improvements, that really give that polished experience feeling."
shittybattlestations,2l2bdf,kingkhani,-1,Sun Nov 2 18:57:54 2014 UTC,"That sounds quite alright actually, as long as I can have the windows 7 look and win 8 speed im settled. :)"
shittybattlestations,2l2bdf,charlestucker3rd,1 point,Sun Nov 2 19:03:36 2014 UTC,"Windows 8 is amazing. It's simply a redesigned version of 7. It's much faster, and it can be modified to look exactly like 7. Also, chrome is lighter than IE, and supports better add-ons such as adblock or extended anti-virus protection. I, personally, enjoy how chrome looks, and where it puts the bookmarks bar. It's UI is very space-efficient."
shittybattlestations,2l2bdf,Lenfried,1 point,Sun Nov 2 19:31:07 2014 UTC,Chrome is great. I wish Firefox was as good looking and fast as Chrome is. I agree with Firefox philosophy more and do not care much for Chrome or Chromium.  For now I switch between Chrome and IE.

As a former college student who used to live in a shitty house that had four very small bedrooms, for which did not have enough room for a desk, I had to use a coffee table and sat on the floor to use my computer. Worst of all, the coffee table is not ""open""; it had doors underneath and I couldn't slide my legs underneath the coffee table.   I also had a huge ass Compaq desktop sitting on top of the coffee table and a 17"" CRT monitor. The coffee table was very thin and I basically sat the same way your dad did and after a month, I've developed a sore back, sore neck, fatigue and claustrophobia because of how tiny the bedroom was.   Never again!   The screen may cost more than your father's laptop but the hospital/doctor bill will when he start complaining about his neck and maybe his back and may need a chiropractor to fix his neck!

shittybattlestations,2jx0gk,Demache,18,Tue Oct 21 19:56:19 2014 UTC,"I kinda feel the same way about the 80s microcomputer era. Objectively better technology did away with the heady allure of tape storage, usefully large floppy disks, and tiny games yearning to feel big. On the other hand, I never had to type in a game from the back of a magazine, you never had to deal with Windows 95 and ME crashing whenever they goddamn well pleased, and future generations will put on their augmented-reality goggles and romanticize our flat screens and mouse-driven shooters.   And there are things about my past the past before me that I think we're worse for losing. I learned QBasic because it came installed as standard, and that led directly to my CS degree. The very low ceiling for visual quality meant anyone with a C64 could clone their favorite commercial games over a long weekend. There was a time when you could be online and not think of what do do next. It really felt like you'd seen all the internet that was new that day, in about an hour. Reddit is the latest tool for ensuring that's never possible again.  Here's the upside: living in the past is cheap. Go to a flea market or whatever and snag a tiny laptop that would've cost thousands of dollars fifteen years ago. Spend $20 on the machine, hours wondering how you'll get software on it, and days playing Doom in the correct aspect ratio. Bury it in all the kickass software from OldVersion.com. Wipe it and install Linux, then wonder why anyone ever installed Linux before Firefox came out. Attach a Palm Pilot and try to do anything useful with it. Get ass-deep in whatever turns your crank and never consider a moment enjoyed a moment wasted."
shittybattlestations,2jx0gk,glisp42,2,Tue Oct 21 20:24:37 2014 UTC,"At some point, I'm going to need to mess with my AST Ascentia again. I got it to the point that you could actually browse the web using Netscape 4.6 on Windows 95. Funny seeing a 486 with 16 MB browsing modern web sites.  But yeah, that's how I have to move files on and off it, since some files are just too big for floppies and I don't have any serial or paralell port cables. I'm just lucky I had a 16 bit PCMCIA ethernet card lying around since its faster anyway."
shittybattlestations,2jx0gk,Cronyx,2,Tue Oct 21 20:33:58 2014 UTC,"Ooh, nice. I recently snagged a Libretto 70 (Pentium 100, 32MB RAM) and neither the tiny laptop nor its dock comes with USB support. None of my other computers are old enough to have floppy drives or serial ports. The best solution I came up with was scrounging together parts for 2004-ish micro-ATX PC (secondhand, c.2007), booting Ubuntu from its CD drive, and shuffling split-RAR over the network. WinRAR installed fine on Windows 95, but little else did, and that is slow business for such a high failure rate. I need to get a network card like that so I can copy things in one step.  What's fucky is that most of the programs I tried installing were lying around in my backups folder from when I was on Windows 95 the first time!"
shittybattlestations,2jx0gk,warkface,3,Tue Oct 21 20:48:58 2014 UTC,"As someone who did, it was often immensely frustrating, but it had a magic that I don't feel is really there anymore. Maybe it's because I was a kid, but I really think it's because while technology still changes quickly, we pretty much plateaued in our demands.   A computer from 5 years ago is still perfectly adequate for almost anything today. But the difference from a Pentium 1 133 to a Pentium III 1000? Mind-blowing difference.  Similarly, the modern internet was basically just starting. I remember when I first got dial-up, being able to access anything was exciting and amazing. But then DSL hit, and being able to stream a video (at like 144p in Realplayer...with buffering from their slow server) was, again practically mindblowing. The dot-com bubble/start of ecommerce was similarly exciting, it's almost funny in retrospect how cautious I used to be about buying things online because no one really trusted it yet.  It's really hard to overstate how much things have changed in ~20 years. Travel is a great example. It's so easy and safe now now. In 1995, nothing was on the internet. Travel agent or many, many irritating phone calls. Get lost? You will be asking people for directions and hoping they can show you on the map where you are and where to go. And you don't have a cell phone. It was much more of an ordeal in every sense."
shittybattlestations,2jx0gk,Zanacross,3,Wed Oct 22 04:05:58 2014 UTC,"They were a pain in the ass to game on.  Part of the reason I think consoles got so popular is that they were simple: load disc, play game.  My first gaming computer (about 2000 or so) I never did get Descent 3 to work correctly.  Lots of time spent farting around downloading drivers and optimizing the game settings to get it to work.  Internet was slow (even if you had broadband which a lot of people didn't), networking machines together was kind of a pain and Windows was very unstable.  The words, ""This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down"" will be engraved in my memory forever.  Things hadn't been standardized to the degree that are today so some things didn't play well together.  There were some good things about the time (huge variety of games, lots and lots of experimentation) but for the most part I don't miss out.  That doesn't mean I didn't nearly crap myself the first time I saw the dancing baby though."
shittybattlestations,2jx0gk,xtrasneakygastro,3,Tue Oct 21 20:39:23 2014 UTC,"Oh lord, yeah. If it wasn't bluescreens then it was CTDs for no damn reason. And god help you if you tapped the Windows key in a fullscreen game! The gradual loss of software-rendering options made for a messy transition to ridiculously large graphics cards that didn't get along. Sometimes it was easier to drop back to DOS and run the game there.   There was a period from 1994 to about 2006 where consoles really were the cheap way to play good-looking games. Quake on PSX was wobbly and the controls were terrible, but for $300 vs. a $3000 Pentium, you could ignore that. The PS2 was like the second incarnation of the NES for its quantity and variety of bespoke software.   Things went sour with the PS3. Multiple launch models, all overpriced. OtherOS (RIP) trying to be a real computer. And game installation - the death knell for consoles as a platform. Consoles were cheap and simple because they ditched parts that PCs needed. You just stuck a game in and played. Now they're full PCs with clunky OSs. Literally, stock PC hardware, albeit with VRAM as system RAM. This won't end well for them in an era where fixing a botched installation of Skyrim on my ~$500 PC from 2011 means deleting the EXE and waiting two minutes for Steam to automatically fix things."

You can change it with ~10 minutes, an allen wrench, and a flat head.   I've never had to discharge the CRT to change the battery.  The back shell comes off and you're good to go.  EDIT: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3005 - guide.  DOUBLE EDIT: Don't buy the purple and black colored battery from RadioShack.  It works just fine but costs twice as much.

shittybattlestations,2jkktb,Propane,1 point,Thu Oct 23 11:37:35 2014 UTC,"It depends on person to person  All note series products have a great stylus that accurately writes what you want, and you will have a hard time differentiating between paper and phone.  The screen size is another preference. I personally use the note because I don't like carrying much around. So far though I've only had one other friend use the note 3 for note taking. The rest of my friends whom I convinced got the note tablets. I'm good with pinch zooming and taking notes and never feel that I don't have enough real estate. I can zoom all the way in and take legible notes.  It also depends on how you take notes. Do you write in letter format, but going top to bottom like a word document. Or do you add small textboxes on notes already provided (my lecture provides us with PPT slides). If the former than you might have difficult with the note 3 and having to adjust every time you write a sentence.  If you have any more questions just pm me"

(avoids mentioning baby sock and lack of pencil to do work with)  I thought it was solid until I saw this sub and noticed I was in worse condition than many posted here. Well the PS4 once worked and the PC can run BF3 at 15fps lowest settings.  Edit: The title was misspelled, sorry.inb4 I lose the certificate and the guitar is great at least.  Edit2: Wow my phone's 8megapixel camera felt the need to take the pic as badly as possible not to embarrass this setup.  Edit3: That is a 2GB USB in front of the PS."
shittybattlestations,2j0ick,ThoryanX9000,3,Sun Oct 12 08:33:11 2014 UTC,"What do you mean the PS4 got reset? Did you erase the files in safe mode? If so then use that laptop you have over there, head to the playstation or playstation network website, scroll to the bottom then download the latest update for the PS4. When that's done, drag that file to a USB stick, put your PS4 in safe mode again and then load up that firmware file and then your ps4 should be fully working again.  Now PSN isn't working so the problem probably is because you have UPnP or NAT disabled on your router. This is different for every router, but most likely your router code is 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1 , type that shit into your internet browser, type in your router's login information then enable UPnP and NAT. These options are usually found in the QoS (Quality of Service) settings or NAT settings. If UPnP is found in neither then check port forwarding since UPnP is basically an automatic form of port forwarding. Check if PSN is working and then your battle station should be far less shitty.   Also if you live in a dorm on college property with Internet provided by the college then you might be fucked for PSN because Cambridge might have blocked it. Try asking some other friends if they have the same problem and if not then to see your college's network administrator about it and they will help fix it for you.  And buy yourself a VGA cable and another one of those metal shelves you bought. You said your laptop is basically a desktop now so we might as well complete the transition by buying a keyboard and a VGA cable so you can hide the laptop out of sight and clean your desk up a bit. And now your shitty battle station should basically be fixed.  Only other thing you could do is head to an auto glass repair shop to fix the iPad. I've never done it before, but I've heard of a few people fixing it that. Anyways I'm tired as fucjinf and good night."

Nice keyboard, matte (non-reflective) high-res display, built-in optical drive, gigabit Ethernet, dual-link DVI-I, optical digital audio, USB, FireWire... it managed to have every interface you might want without cluttering the design or getting too thick.  Really my only complaint is that with all that width on the 17"", they should have included a numeric pad."
shittybattlestations,2iym71,Raptor007,2,Sat Oct 11 23:37:31 2014 UTC,"I love it. The only things it needs is a RAM boost, a Wireless card replacement, and a new Superdrive. The magnetic clamps that hold the lid down and only come out when needed are excellent. Gotta say, though, It was a pain in the ass to get it to really triple boot and not just have GRUB replace Windows' bootloader. Stupid hybrid MBR."
shittybattlestations,2iym71,machello,1 point,Sun Oct 12 00:28:13 2014 UTC,"Yeah I set up a triple-boot on my dad's MacBook with OSX/WinXP/Linux way back in the day and I remember it being a pain in the ass, but at least rEFIt (now rEFInd) made it easy to pick which OS to boot.  With Windows 7 or newer and a modern Linux kernel, I suspect you could go pure GPT and not have to fuss with hybrid MBR."
shittybattlestations,2iym71,satchmomo,2,Sun Oct 12 01:01:08 2014 UTC,"I tried, it wouldn't do it. This one specifically decided that any GPT modifications I would make were irrelevant. I ended up using rEFInd to load the bootloaders, but had to use the Hybrid MBR for full hardware support in Win7 (and because LOL MAC NOT BOOT DVDS WITH HYBRID BOOTLOADERS BECAUSE LOL). I was initially worried, because it booted a Live USB of Ubuntu right away, but the video was messed up so bad that I was afraid it would never work. Turns out it was because it was booting UEFI mode. Had to switch to macx64 version DVD to get it to even think of being stable. Then, rEFInd could only see the recovery HD, Mac OS, and Windows. Windows and Linux were stuck in their own land of WTF, with me having to boot windows, navigate GRUB, and hope it stuck. Had to manually edit the MBR to show the three OSes as Mac, Windows, and Linux, then had to reset the Windows bootloader to its pre-GRUB state. Ugh."

This may seem random but I just got one of those macbooks but am waiting on a charger to come in to get it up and running. What are the specs on yours and how does it hold up today?

I got 4 rolls of tape from Poundland (reduced to 75p because it was meant to be a 5 pack and one roll was missing) so it should be similar stuff to what the professionals use.

shittybattlestations,2iggtq,staticwarp,7,Tue Oct 7 01:41:07 2014 UTC,That's some smart thinking.  The cardboard might be a little hard pushed up against the wires so you should cushion it with some tissue paper

shittybattlestations,2hs36d,Im_100percent_human,7,Mon Sep 29 12:23:53 2014 UTC,You could at least do it properly and terminate it into an RJ45 jack. :-) You can get one at Home Depot for a couple of dollars.

shittybattlestations,2h97or,theinfiniti,1 point,Wed Sep 24 14:12:40 2014 UTC,"That DVD player was bought in 1999-2000 and was like $150-180 back then.  And that was basically the cheapest you could get a DVD for back then.  That this was a major POS.  If you hit pause and then resumed, playback with be stuttered unless you hit stop and play again.  On the remote these was a big red button in the top left corner.  Power button right?  Try mute.  You had to push the power button on the DVD player itself to turn it on."

The thing is, my school is a small private school that is so short-handed on janitorial staff that they ask for student volunteers to take out the trash from lunch. That particular day, they were short on volunteers so I said ""eh, why not."" When we took the trash out to the dumpster I looked into the dumpster, and lo and behold, there were roughly ten of these just sitting around at the bottom. If these were covered in trash, this might have been a different story, but the dumpster was practically empty except for these. So, then again I said ""eh, why not,"" and so now my home office has turned into a computer grave yard. I mean, practically all the parts still work, and I found a Sim City 4 disk 2, so at least I got that going for me, which is nice."

Other than that whenever we can find a house (it's hard when you only make $3600/mo and everyone wants 34% income to be rent or they just tell you to fuck off) I'll use it to handle the extra inputs my receiver doesn't have, such as the minidisc player and CD player as the receiver only has 2 tape and a single aux input, not near enough."

The 150gb WD raptor and 320gb WD scorpio laptop drive have probably never been cooler as both the main fans and PSU fans exhaust over them and they are cool to the touch.

Really, CPUs have become so powerful (and games aren't too reliant on them) that most any decent CPU will do. I want to upgrade the motherboard though for PCIe 3.0 since I'll probably splurge on a 290 or 295X2. And I'd like USB 3.0."
shittybattlestations,2gi5ri,ZaInT,1 point,Tue Sep 16 22:36:45 2014 UTC,"3.3 GHz? You got yourself a free 1100T! I wouldn't upgrade the motherboard though. There's no such thing as an AMD motherboard with PCI-e 3.0 in it, and even the newer cards wouldn't be bottlenecked by a 2.0 slot.  You can get USB 3.0 via an add-on card and I wouldn't go higher than a R9 290. Despite how well the processor has aged, it can't keep up with a card faster than that. Many games only use two cores, and that can keep a very fast graphics card waiting around. There are however, a number of games that use multiple cores, and that number is increasing rapidly. A 290 or GTX 770 and your CPU running Metro Last Light or Battlefield 4 would be spectacular."

Now take these containers and list them on your local online classified listings.  Selling a few dozen should net a little bit of cash which will be enough to buy some plastic pellets from a supplier, these are usually pretty cheap and you can get any colour you want too!  Next take your pellets and find a large shop with injection molding, tell them you have some plastic you want formed into a grated square shaped interlocking container.  Once you pay them a bit extra to make the mould and give them the pellets they will make you some of these fancy containers.  I hope this has been helpful, let me know how it works out!"

Playing pretty much any new-ish game will do it, though. Even the model with the dedicated graphics isn't meant for gaming really, more for stuff like CAD design.  What's happening is probably the game is maxing out your CPU, triggering it to go into Turbo Boost. The Turbo Boost on my 2.4GHz T410 overclocks to 2.9GHz, so it understandably starts having thermal issues while playing CPU-intensive games. Consider setting your max CPU performance to 99% in Power Options, that should force it to stay within the designed clock speed."

Planning on getting an unretarded case soon, will do it properly then.  The 295 has to be split apart to get to the good linty buildup.  I'm not sure if most double GPU cards are like that, but if so I don't think I'll be going that route again.  For most games it's around 60-80, but Skyrim and TES Online do some crazy things to it.

Instead of a parallel port you just plug the modules into your wall and the computer can control them by sending signals over the existing electrical wiring. It's actually pretty cool, and you can still buy the hardware today for relatively cheap."

shittybattlestations,2elvxw,kr1st0s,3,Tue Aug 26 14:08:17 2014 UTC,I have one running linux on a 80GB HDD and 1GB DDR RAM. Bought it way back in 2003/2004. Now it just holds media.
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,xanxer,2,Tue Aug 26 16:00:34 2014 UTC,What distro are you running?
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,dmyerty,2,Wed Aug 27 09:36:50 2014 UTC,DSL Damn Small Linux. It's very lightweight.
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,xanxer,3,Wed Aug 27 13:23:32 2014 UTC,Too lightweight. And it hasn't been maintained since 2008. DSL was my first distro.   Puppy Linux would be a safer bet.
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,dmyerty,1 point,Wed Aug 27 13:26:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I've been thinking about that or a stripped down Debian. But it's such an old machine, even after upgrading the proc and RAM, it get get kind of funky when running an intense process."
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,xanxer,1 point,Wed Aug 27 13:39:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah. It's still a good bet. DSL works on many, many old machines."
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,dmyerty,4,Wed Aug 27 14:41:51 2014 UTC,Nope. Dell Dimension 3000. Though you can also do it to a 2400 since it also is mATX.
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,Castmir,9,Tue Aug 26 16:43:51 2014 UTC,Did you actually have to mod the case to get that stuff to fit in?
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,beastgamer9136,3,Tue Aug 26 10:34:57 2014 UTC,"Nope, standard mATX board fits in there. Though take the top off real quick to cut a little hole to shove the extra cables up in there."
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,beastgamer9136,3,Tue Aug 26 16:40:56 2014 UTC,"So nope, but yes."
shittybattlestations,2elvxw,Alfred456654,3,Tue Aug 26 18:04:34 2014 UTC,I did for cable management. You don't have to make any modifications to it at all. You'll just have cables everywhere unless you shove them in the corner with zip ties.

shittybattlestations,2eh8l0,person66,-7,Sun Aug 24 22:52:06 2014 UTC,The right way would be to run multiple video cards using Nvidia's Scalable Link Interface.
shittybattlestations,2eh8l0,person66,20,Sun Aug 24 23:03:01 2014 UTC,"Why? My card has three ports and can display an image across all of them (not in games, maybe, but I hardly ever play games). Are you saying that if I want to run my three monitors correctly I need to stick 3 750Tis in there? Because that would be spending around £190 to do something I already do with one."
shittybattlestations,2eh8l0,Godnaut,9,Sun Aug 24 23:09:58 2014 UTC,"For games, running three monitors off one card's GPU and RAM is incredibly taxing, you're essentially dropping your frame rate by %66.  But for non gaming, it's fine."
shittybattlestations,2eh8l0,djpokeboy,13,Sun Aug 24 23:19:01 2014 UTC,"But that is only for games that use all three screens, if you are only using one then the performance drop would be practically nothing."

shittybattlestations,2eh8l0,djpokeboy,3,Mon Aug 25 01:12:33 2014 UTC,"No, you should be fine. Essentially you are just increasing your desktop resolution when you have multiple monitors, there's more stuff for the graphics card to render. This is only going to make a noticeable performance drop over a single screen if there is graphically intensive stuff going on on multiple screens at once. For everyday computing, which isn't graphically intensive, you wouldn't notice any difference at all. And if you are only gaming on one screen, and don't have stuff going on on the other screens, then again, there wont be any noticeable difference over a single screen setup.  Its only if you are running the game on multiple monitors, or watching a flash video or something on one monitor while gaming on another that you will actually start to see a performance drop."
shittybattlestations,2eh8l0,autowikibot,3,Mon Aug 25 01:54:42 2014 UTC,"Oh, good.

shittybattlestations,2eh8l0,November-Snow,2,Mon Aug 25 02:27:03 2014 UTC,"Scalable Link Interface:       Scalable Link Interface (SLI) is a brand name for a multi-GPU technology developed by NVIDIA for linking two or more video cards together to produce a single output. SLI is an algorithm of parallel processing for computer graphics, meant to increase the processing power available for graphics.  The acronym SLI was first used by 3dfx for Scan-Line Interleave, which was introduced to the consumer market in 1998 and used in the Voodoo2 line of video cards. After buying out 3dfx, NVIDIA acquired the technology but did not use it. NVIDIA later reintroduced the SLI name in 2004 and intended for it to be used in modern computer systems based on the PCI Express (PCIe) bus; however, the technology behind the name SLI has changed dramatically.
