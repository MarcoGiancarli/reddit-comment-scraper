He's already done Katarina, Diana, Shyvana, Ahri, and Irelia and he's about to release a couple more, I think.  I wonder if I'll ever have time to forma a gallery. Maybe this weekend? Maybe in four years? Maybe when TF2 gets ported to Source 2? Either way, here are a few highlights:  Classic: 1, League of Legends, Annie, Sona, Ashe, Janna, Leona, Leona  Popstar highlights   He's done more sets with Halloween, Christmas, and New Year's themes.

Anyways, other stuff you might Nestkeeper (deviantart, personal blog, pixiv) from: his bunny piece, his J4 holic,  his How to Train your Dragon series (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 10), or maybe his LoLvengers.  His gallery is mainly comprised of curvy people like Soraka, Soraka x Janna x Sona, Officer Vayne, Pharaoh Nidalee, Slaybelle Katarina, Ahri, Girl Twitch,  Girl Maokai, Leblanc, MF in this pairing, and Riven in this Bunny trio. Those are probably nsfw I guess.  He's also drawn a lot of yordles like Amumu, Pool Party Ziggs, Lulu, and LooLoo. He's drawn Tristana a lot though with Rocketeer Tristana, Tristana and  Rumble, Bamboo Cannon Tristana, and also Tristana with Poppy (there's a Pool Party Poppy so that's fun i guess.  Other stuff include Lux with a head laser, Silver Leona, Ezreal, Schoolgirl Riven, Top and Jungle relationships, Fizz with a girl, buff Vlad, SaiLoL Moon, Demacia team, innocent Jinx, and Frozen  stuff.  The rest of his gallery is kind of nsfw with huge boobs and whatever so go there if you want. idk. The NSFW league stuff is just  Female Vlad (probably NSFW), Poppy, and Bristle."

LoLFanArt,3ddyml,The-All-Tomato,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yay you just gave me the source of this Lulu sketch I found awhile back!  I dig the cute, bashful anime schoolgirl style, but I don't really understand the motivation of drawing characters to fit a trope that isn't true to their nature. I still enjoy it, so I'm not complaining, just musing. Also I wonder why the artist likes that jacket so much. Is it just because its cool, or does it have some sort of personal significance?"
LoLFanArt,3ddyml,ayyyyyyyyyyyyy-lmao,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"I guess it's kind of entertaining in a way seeing characters as more relatable or more normal. It is completely out of character but it's fun, kind of the same reason people read fan fiction"

Anyways,  I can't find all the tumblr rehosts I need to replace  You probably know dakun87 (deviantart, afreeca, naver) from her Popstar Ahris piece(with the accompanying Girl's Generation/SNSD/Ihavenoideawhatkpopis, classic, actual Popstar, and Firefox Or maybe you recognize her Summer Pool Party or Summer lulu or Star Guardian Lux or Facebook Header.  There's her turtleneck Annie too, if to want  Anyways, I kinda like her Angel Sona, her Soraka (half of her stained glass series with Zyra), or maybe even her Untitled thing.  She's drawn a Valentine's chocolate series with Sona (twice), Annie, Lux, and Ahri.  Speaking of Ahri, dakun87 has drawn her in a lot of stuff.  Another popular champion to draw would be Lulu. There's the Winter Wonder skin, a couple of Halloween drawings, and also just classic. There's also the Annie/Lulu grouping. Another sweet pairing (accompanied by the heartseeker duo)  The last common champion would be Sona with Silent Night and Guqin and Arcade and Wedding skins.  So before moving on here's the rest of her deviantart gallery:   Officer Caitlyn Jinx Katarina Blue Lux Janna TPA Ezreal Blackthorn Morgana Mafia Miss Fortune Bikini stuff Prom Queen Annie Nurse Akali Leona   So yeah, that's her deviantart gallery in one convenient place.  There's also her naver which is just random sketches of stuff (besides that one full colour portrait of Lissandra and the panty reveal plus notices for sketchbook sales and convention attendances. I didn't get some of the sketches and I kind of stopped at page 70, so yeah.  Ashe: Pose 1, Pose 2  Nami: Flask, Watercoloury  Caitlyn: Office, Pose 2  Sona: Black and White Arcade, Coloured Arcade  Ezreal: weird hand gesture, coloured hand gesture  Riven: Battle Bunny Butt, Battle Bunny upward view  short people: Annie, Lulu died, Veigar  I can't think of another category: ~~Baker Morgana, Kayle, Jinx, Lux butt pose.

You're going to have a lot of fun, transitioning from paper media is something that will take time as the techniques are obviously very different. Check out some YouTube stuff, lots of good tuts.  I think the biggest thing is just not being afraid to draw first and ask questions later. Learn to love the fact you have an undo key and layers."
