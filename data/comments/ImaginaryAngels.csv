ImaginaryAngels,1lj8sg,Aspel,3,Sun Sep 1 23:09:36 2013 UTC,Avacyn is armageddonproof.
ImaginaryAngels,1lj8sg,davvblack,1 point,Sun Sep 1 23:21:55 2013 UTC,"That's the point. You play Avacyn as your Commander, then play Armageddon."
ImaginaryAngels,1lj8sg,Aspel,3,Sun Sep 1 23:35:41 2013 UTC,Commander is designed around a premise of 'should be fun'.  Destroying everyone's lands but yours isn't fun :P
ImaginaryAngels,1lj8sg,davvblack,1 point,Mon Sep 2 00:03:58 2013 UTC,Should is the key word.  I've played far too many Commander games with people who's idea of fun means cloning Sylvan Primordial on turn six and blowing up everyone else's lands while ramping themselves.
