shittyandroidreviews,3apeb8,hammy78,11,Mon Jun 22 12:38:48 2015 UTC,"This app is has many issues.  For the entire period of time I have been using this app it has been bothering me with multiple prompts to update the app. I am a very busy man and I don't like change so when it prompts me for said update I tap on the ""update later"" button. I know most people like having updated apps but what if I don't like the new version? Finally I gave in and updated the app and of course as I thought the new version was filled with bugs and errors.  I was unable to promptly open my gallery and it causes my Samsung Galaxy s4 to crash and/or hang. Please promptly fix this app or restore my phone to the condition it was in before the update.  Thank you  -Yasmeen Javeed    There is not a direct translation but I did my best."

shittyandroidreviews,35zuqf,shadowhorseman1,0,Fri May 15 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"Well /r/androidmasterrace is a circlejerk so obviously it will mostly be hurr aplle is for idiots, with that said though, apple is massively overpriced mediocre products that really are no better than android. I agree the whole rivalry is stupid but it's only stupid because telling someone who uses apple that apple is bad is pointless because they just deny it and are idiots"
shittyandroidreviews,35zuqf,TeutorixAleria,3,Thu May 14 22:31:05 2015 UTC,Samsung devices are just as overpriced.   The problem is apple only sells flagship devices they don't do anything else so their margins are huge.   Every other large companies high end stuff is similar in price.
shittyandroidreviews,35zuqf,shadowhorseman1,2,Thu May 14 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely true, my point was more that IPhones are overpriced when the equivalent hardware on android isnt as expensive. But either way people prefer what they prefer there's no point in the rivalry imo"
shittyandroidreviews,35zuqf,TeutorixAleria,1 point,Fri May 15 18:38:47 2015 UTC,Thats not really the case the s6 edge is more expensive than the iPhone 6+.
shittyandroidreviews,35zuqf,shadowhorseman1,1 point,Fri May 15 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"but the S6 Edge has way better specs that the iPhone 6+. Granted most people don't care what the specs are and are more concerned with if it will do what they want it to do, but the iPhone 6+ and ios 8 only now have features and specs that android had in like 2012"
shittyandroidreviews,35zuqf,TeutorixAleria,2,Fri May 15 19:25:06 2015 UTC,Slightly more powerful for 200 extra dollars. Don't tell me flagship Android phones are better value than iPhones. That's just a lie.   I say this as someone who would never buy an iPhone.
shittyandroidreviews,35zuqf,shadowhorseman1,3,Fri May 15 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"No Flagshiup android phones are just as bad as Apple when it comes to being over priced because of the whole ""paying for the brand thing"", but from my experiences I much prefer the ability to change things about android with thing like rooting and co#ustom roms. I know you can do similar things with a jailbroken iPhone so I dunno the whole android vs. Apple thing just seems stupid to me like if you want an iPhone then get an iPhone and if you prefer android then use an android phone as long as you aren't being delusional about wether its better or worse or being an ass about it I don't care"

shittyandroidreviews,360eok,OfficerBribe,2,Fri May 15 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"Did you type in English or Disney? Review clearly states there's no connection when you search in Disney, English works just fine"
shittyandroidreviews,34x1uq,SuperiorAlpaca,4,Tue May 5 07:18:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, being a GL game it probably deserves the one star rating."
shittyandroidreviews,34x1uq,LCLaddict,5,Tue May 5 07:25:20 2015 UTC,Gameloft made really good JAVA games back in the day. Their Splinter Cell platformers were amazing.
shittyandroidreviews,34x1uq,OfficerBribe,2,Mon May 18 13:45:20 2015 UTC,"Didn't know someone liked their games. Played through them all because I couldn't play the proper games, what did you like about them? I still think they were pretty bad, the controls often felt unresponsive, the first levels were nothing more than a tutorial and you just didn't have a lot of freedom in general."
shittyandroidreviews,34x1uq,LCLaddict,5,Mon May 18 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"Their games seemed really advanced for phones at that time. In Splinter Cell you could aim, shoot out lights, had different weapons, could hide bodies, there were a lot of different scripted scenarios, animation was fluid. In a sense they were more like an interactive story than a game, but for 300kb, I couldn't wish more. Maybe I'm just nostalgic. I'm not saying Gameloft had the best games(Deep by Fishlabs was awesome and Doom RPG as well), but they always felt top notch for me. They still are in a sense, but all I see now, are just pretty graphics, haven't liked a single GL game now"
shittyandroidreviews,34x1uq,OfficerBribe,2,Tue May 19 06:28:19 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're talking about the first mobile Splinter Cell, then I know what you mean, it was also more challenging IIRC. Pandora Tomorrow was also fluid. But the following ones... Chaos Theory didn't have fluent animations, tried it on 3 different phones, it always felt really jerky. Double Agent wasn't quite as bad, but it wasn't much better. Being able to hide bodies was nice, but it wasn't really crucial, and being able to aim and shoot things didn't feel like a big deal IMO. Anyway, I really wish they would try to make some proper games instead of putting out CoD rip-offs."
shittyandroidreviews,34x1uq,LCLaddict,2,Tue May 19 07:29:43 2015 UTC,"At that time, we installed .jar instead of .apk file. Though now seems cannot find a way to simulate it on Android. Some really nice games works best on feature phone like EDGE."
