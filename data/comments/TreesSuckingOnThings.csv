TreesSuckingOnThings,3dwc20,godzilla1517,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:01:52 2015 UTC,How does this happen?
TreesSuckingOnThings,3dwc20,MundiMori,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:08 2015 UTC,Bucks she they're antlers every spring and to help with this they rub them on trees. Somehow the antler must have stayed up until the tree could grow around it.

TreesSuckingOnThings,3ctpj0,Silly_little_pet,7,Fri Jul 10 20:39:23 2015 UTC,Why is the wood darker where the gold ball is? Has it burned or something or is it just knots in the wood?
TreesSuckingOnThings,3ctpj0,imfuckingAMAzing,4,Fri Jul 10 23:05:31 2015 UTC,I think it's bark.
