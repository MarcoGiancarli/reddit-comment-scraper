You're pretending to be sexually interested in them to get what you want.  This will often leave guys feeling unfulfilled, foolish and potentially bitter.  I would liken it to a guy feigning romantic interest in a girl just to get laid."
AskMen,3e2vba,Locem,23,Tue Jul 21 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"I was going to say this. Some women will feign sexual interest to get what they want, and some guys will feign romantic interest to get what they want. Both actions are pretty disspicble, and it's not about ""all woman are evil bitches"" or ""all men are dogs"", but just that some people are assholes."
AskMen,3e2vba,ailish,5,Tue Jul 21 19:24:00 2015 UTC,"So if I flirt with an ugly girl, lead her on, use her for her money and then fuck off as soon as I've got what I want, your friend would say 'wow, what a good guy, helping that poor woman build up her confidence'? I doubt it, somehow.  Ultimately, your friend can act like this if she so chooses, but she's deluding herself if she believes that she isn't being manipulative or unkind. Guys need to be a bit more realistic and cynical about this sort of thing, but that doesn't mean that women aren't being unkind if they take advantage of men in this way."

There's usually an already-established friendship there, but it's not too uncommon for girls to flirt with strangers just out of being friendly. It's somewhat analogous to a guy joking around with someone. Some guys will joke with a stranger during a brief interaction on the street, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's some deeper meaning there.  But the keyword here is some. Different people, different personalities, different intentions."

AskMen,3e2vba,mashonem,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:59 2015 UTC,The difference is when you joke with someone your not implying chemistry on one side or trying to use that perceived chemistry to influence an outcome grossly in your favor on the misrepresented idea that the actions taken by the other person could lead to further chemistry between the two.     Bad example is bad
AskMen,3e2vba,CrazyPaws,16,Tue Jul 21 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"I wasn't replying to the thread, just to starbreakerauthor. Whereas the thread is about the specific scenario of girls intentionally flirting for personal gain, the comment I was replying to was about any flirting. Unless you're trying to say that any and all flirting is for personal gain, and it's simply not possible for flirting to be just for fun for both people?  But even then, joking can be a form of flirting, and more than one girl has mistaken innocent joking as being attention of a different sort."
AskMen,3e2vba,SJHillman,27,Tue Jul 21 17:46:22 2015 UTC,Not arguing that but if your going to use flirting as if its interchangeable with a joke then I would say its your responsibility to ensure no one gets the wrong message from it.  Flirting is a way to show interest in someone. one of many ways to show interest in someone but flirting says something the others don't that's why it has its own name.    As an example a girl may flirt with male friends in jest but not her brother this is because at its very core flirting speaks at the first steps of being with someone intimately ( marrage or sex your choice depending on beliefs )   So I will say again if a girl is flirting with you and has no intentions of exploring a relationship she's leveraging a social mechanism designed to help people pair up to get you to like them more.   The difference is she wants you to have her a higher option of her  instead of asking you to help her move or buying her dinner.  I'm not saying its done with ill intentions but at its very core it is deceitful even if its done unintentionally.     We could debate this for a long time and a lot of it is subjective but I think the general idea is there.

AskMen,3e2vba,buxom_eyeliner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:40 2015 UTC,"Men are so fucked in the head when it comes to women it's not even funny.  Once I was at a bar, a girl approached me and started flirting with me.  After a bit of flirting she asked me if I wanted a drink, and I remember explicitly thinking, ""wow, first she initiates and now she's offering to buy me a drink...this chick is too good to be true."" We walk to the bar and she says 'hold on a minute' and presses her side next to some guy and in her best damsel in distress voice she says ""can you buy me a drink?"" The guy said sure babe or something like that, ordered her a drink.  She took it and right in front of him handed it to me, didn't even say thank you.  I couldn't believe it, I'd heard of girls getting guys to buy them drinks and leaving but this I'd never seen.  I felt bad so I handed the guy the beer and said ""I'm sorry dude, I just met her"" and started to walk away.  The dude yelled at me as I started walking away, ""wow, you don't need to be such an asshole dude!""  Even after this girl blatantly fucked him over, the dude was ready to defend her honor.    Men have no shame, and will do whatever it takes to win over a cute girl.  Does this excuse the girls who do it? Not in the least, but when men make it so damn easy to take advantage of them I can't really sympathize with them."
AskMen,3e2vba,emphesym,17,Tue Jul 21 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting points. Even if it didn't bother me that people treat each other his way on principle, it would still bother me on a purely selfish level that women pull this garbage because it does lead to mind-fucking everyone up when it comes to dating, sex, etc., and that makes everything harder and weirder for everyone. It not such a surprise anymore at this point, but it use to really fucking baffle me that otherwise very cool guys would sometimes get suspicious or paranoid about random stuff seemingly out of the blue. Now I just tend to steer clear of most men with those sorts of scars and I honestly kind of hate myself for it in some instances because I feel terrible for some dudes, but it's exhausting and miserable to constantly be paying the emotional cost for what some other woman did.   I mean, to be fair all around (fair to whom? I don't know exactly), many women are unbelievably fucked in the head when it comes to men as well. In my more cynical moments it seems like the biggest predictor of success in a relationship is having compatible baggage. Not saying it's a positive dynamic, just that it makes things easier in a twisted way."
AskMen,3e2vba,emphesym,5,Tue Jul 21 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right.  I believe everyone has their own 'reality' based on seeing the world in a different way.  There is no use in me getting upset because someone views reality differently.  What would be the point in me arguing with the guy who got vamboozled out of $7.50.  It'll take a much larger event than a drunken debate with me to change his whole outlook on things.  I understand being upset, but there is just no use for it, it literally accomplishes nothing.  My only exception for getting angry about it is when people try to force their reality onto me.  Liberals try to do this with 'tolerance' and acceptance, conservatives do it with religion.  Two sides of the same coin."

AskMen,3e2vba,squirtyanus,12,Tue Jul 21 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"I don't like being manipulated or lied to.  When i was a kid, i was overweight and ugly. There was no chance any girl ever was going to show any interest in me. THe only time any girl ever did was when a girl would pretend to be flirting with me in exchange for  me doing her homework or something like that.  What happens when a person who is very highly aware of how unattractive he is only experiences the feeling of someone being attracted to him when that person is deliberately lying to them to try and get some kind of personal gain? It feels awful. You might think you've giving a guy some temporary boost of confidence but really you're just reinforcing whatever shitty self-esteem issues he may already be dealing with. If no one has ever registered any interest in me, and suddenly an attractive girl starts flirting with me, it's because she's lying and trying to manipulate me for some reason. That's the lesson i learned at an early age from this behavior.  So then i grew up, became more attractive, lost weight, became a better person, etc.....but because of that lying and manipulating I experienced as a younger guy, I have never been able to fully, 100% trust any woman who's ever shown an interest in me. I'm always trying to think of what she's trying to chisel out of me. It takes a long time for that cynicism and hard shell to dissipate enough for anyone to get through.  This is one huge reason why I prefer to be actual friends with a woman before i enter into any kind of romantic relationship with them. Because if they're not in a relationship with me solely because they actually like me for me, then it's like having to re-live a whole bunch of childhood/adolescent bullying and destroyed self-esteem all over again.  So - TL; DR: Anyone who would flirt with any other person to manipulate that person into doing something for them is a fucking asshole. Either flirt sincerely or don't fucking flirt at all."
AskMen,3e2vba,mashonem,10,Tue Jul 21 18:19:25 2015 UTC,"Its on the same level as  good looking guy lying about wanting a relationship just to keep a girl around for sex awhile.

Only flirted with me when she wanted help with her homework.  Openly denied it when I called her out.  Yeah, I don't talk to that manipulative butthole.  Flirt with a man to get him to buy you a drink, and then ditch him afterwards?  My wife's friend got her in the habit of doing this at bars downtown before we got married.

That's terrible and I believe it probably has an impact on a woman's ability to have and form healthy relationships in a way similar to how women who are sex workers are extremely likely to have their capacity for intimacy in romantic and sexual relationships affected negatively, only this would be more about emotional intimacy involving viewing one's lover as a partner as opposed to emotional intimacy involving sexual intimacy between lovers.  If it isn't just an indication of sociopathic tendencies and something fundamentally wrong with their capacity for empathy that precludes normal, healthy relationships.  It's also generally harmful to the confidence and emotional well-being of men who become entrapped by their feelings which will and can never be returned but are used against them.  I'm reasonably confident that girls like that and stories about them contribute to the problem of creating MRAs and twerpers and MGTOWers at least to some extent.     TL;DR: Your ""friend"" is a terrible person, unlikely to improve morally, and someone you'll have to watch out for trying to manipulate you and those around you.  Also probably not actually your friend.    Potential for manipulating your shared social networks and groups against you if she ever turns against you is strong."

AskMen,3e2vba,Gladium_Spiritus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's manipulative, but you can also blame the victim to some extent.   A radio show did a funny ""phone tap"" where a girl pranked her friend, who goes out to bars, takes off her wedding ring, and gets free drinks from guys. This friend lost her phone and the show called up saying it was one of the guys who bought her a drink and kinda made her admit she was a jerk."
AskMen,3e2vba,BlackMathNerd,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's the victims fault at some point, but I mean so is any scam.

What really hit home for me is knowing that its my friend thats doing it."
AskMen,3e2vba,anillop,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"I think the victim is responsible, but not at fault (in all such scenarios). It's why you can't legally punish some scams, because they're shady, but are valid. On the other hand, we shouldn't ""blame the victim,"" because it should never be considered the victim's fault for being naive or ill-informed and trusting a fellow human being. That's the rationale psychopaths employ for using people: ""I taught them to not trust others so easily, and that lesson comes with a price."""

AskMen,3e2vba,jetpack8,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"How people get their way is something that tells you a lot about that person, and it's something they typically learn very early. Lets list some forms this takes:   Flattery   Flirting Charm Ass-kissing  Intimidation   Presence (I'm bigger, stronger, better) Threats Extortion Intelligence (I have a better argument)  Deceipt   Lying Misleading  Service   Favors Help Gift debt  Friendliness   Appeal to loyalty Likability    Not a full list, but we can find ourselves in this list, and we see it more pronounced if we think of situations where the person has less power or lacks authority. In these situations, people feel compelled to manipulate or else just deal with not getting their way.  Flirting is a powerful tool, and it probably tells us that this girl has been given attention for being cute or showering affection on people. Typically, you'll see this in the baby of the family. The baby is considered the cutest by comparison to the older kids, so this is one advantage they have over size or age with their siblings.  So, back to the question. Is this bad? It's bad whenever personal gain comes at the cost of the person she is toying with. Do the guys feel deceived? Do they feel something has been promised in return? Do they believe she likes them when she actually cares nothing for them? If those things are true, and probably are, it's bad. The way she did it doesn't matter as much as caring about the other person as much as yourself."

Things like ""dammit car, if you had been going the speed limit we wouldn't have hit a red light!"" are said quite often.

But we don't know much about this medical condition. Like, can she just not do penetration at all? I can tell you from personal experience that 69 is some hot shit in it's own right and while I don't I pretend to know you or your problem if all you are looking for is validation that you aren't a douche for treating sex as a need than by all means feel free and clear.

She had had a really bad experience trying to have sex in high school, and even thinking about trying again made her have a panic attack. I remained calm and patient, and made it clear that I found her more important than sex, but matter-of-factly stated that sexual intimacy is important to me. She decided that she wanted to try, and became very determined to succeed (as did I). We worked VERY SLOWLY, going SLIGHTLY deeper each day until it started to feel painful for her, and then immediately stopping. Within a month, we were having the best sex of my life (and hers, obviously)."

AskMen,3e127d,taylor-in-progress,11,Tue Jul 21 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"I'm a trans guy (ftm) who used to suffer from vaginismus. Due to endometriosis, something happened during PIV intercourse that caused a large amount of deep, internal pain. After that, I couldn't have PIV without pain because I would clench up and nothing I could do would make the muscles relax. Alcohol helped a little, but not enough to let me be able to stand more than a few minutes of sex.   I got a kit containing about 5 dilators of different sizes. The smallest is about the size of a pinky and the largest was about the size of a slightly above average penis. I worked my way up through them. Mainly all you do is lie in bed, lube them up and insert them, leaving them in for a certain length of time. This is done each day until you are acme to move up to the next size. Even after that my partner and I had to start with quick sex sessions until we could work up towards me being able to handle it for longer. There is a definite psychological aspect too, getting rid of that fear that is going to hurt. I think the dilators can help with that too though.  I know it may not be a cure for everyone, and may be more difficult for someone who wasn't already doing penetration prior to the onset of the issue, but it really made a huge difference for me. I'm pretty sure I just wrote way too much, but hopefully this will help someone."

Also some forms of intersex will give a similarly non-functional or too-narrow to be penetrated, even by a single finger, vagina.

AskMen,3e127d,KittyHammer,15,Tue Jul 21 04:56:59 2015 UTC,medical condition....she can't orgasm...like a chore to her....decide which is because everyone of these problems is a different thing. does she have a heart condition or she just doesn't have a vagina?
AskMen,3e127d,merely_observing,12,Tue Jul 21 04:58:13 2015 UTC,"Man, that is a shitty situation. It's a lot like saying, what if you dated someone for a month or two, really dug each other and everything was great, and suddenly she got into a car accident and was now quadriplegic? Are you obligated to devote your life to her because of her bad situation?    Someone should not try to drag people into their sexless situation. There are people who are asexual. If she just wants companionship, I'd direct her to asexual communities. I'm sure there must be subreddits for that. She cannot expect you to forego your sexual needs because of her situation. You should not feel guilty. Imagine Robin Williams is hugging you and telling you, ""It's not your fault."""
AskMen,3e127d,KittyHammer,6,Tue Jul 21 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"Well, you're not together, so apparently there isn't even a breakup necessary to leave her.  Sucks that she can't have PIV sex, can't have or derives no pleasure from anal, and can't orgasm from either masturbation or oral sex despite ample sexploration and investigation of the full range of options and tools available to her, but it is what it is.  Like... she's probably going to be best served by looking into dating asexual dudes or non-monogamous relationships, but that's not really your responsibility or place to bring up with her.  Also, leaving now will hurt a whole lot less than leaving after you've formally established a relationship."
AskMen,3e127d,spotH3D,4,Tue Jul 21 04:01:09 2015 UTC,"I would end it before she gets more attached.  I'd rather look like an asshole because we are incompatible then stay with her only for me to resent myself then her which would increase my urge to cheat and break her heart.  Maybe she'll get lucky with asexuals, they don't care about the sexual part."
AskMen,3e127d,IFuckingLoveSpoons,3,Tue Jul 21 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe she'll get lucky with asexuals, they don't care about the sexual part.   She might not be happy with that either, if she's not asexual. Wanting sex but not being able to have it..."
AskMen,3e127d,proROKexpat,2,Tue Jul 21 11:42:57 2015 UTC,"In her case, she would have to make a compromise for herself. The alternative is dating people that want sex only to find out she's unable. Then a vicious cycle will continue."
AskMen,3e127d,myopinionisvalid,6,Tue Jul 21 14:46:08 2015 UTC,If that's the case she is fucked.  It's a tragedy.  OP still needs to run for the hills.
AskMen,3e127d,NoSexTemp,8,Tue Jul 21 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"What about other methods of sex? I mean that still might not be what you're looking for but sex isn't just penis in vagina shenanigans. I just think there's a world of difference between no PIV sex and no sex at all, and you could at least explore that before breaking up with her if you really do like her."
AskMen,3e127d,sirricharic,3,Tue Jul 21 04:57:54 2015 UTC,Do you really love her? Is she OK with you fucking other women? Cause thats what this is going come down to if she can't have sex.
AskMen,3e127d,Feroc,10,Tue Jul 21 05:04:00 2015 UTC,"My woman has a condition that makes her constantly hurt. She'll fight through the pain because she does still get pleasure from sex, but the last month it has gotten so bad that we can't do piv. We have been together for 17 months and she has a specialist trying to help her(Botox injection into her pelvic floor 2 weeks ago).  I love her too much to leave.  She even suggested we find someone for me to have sex with, but that's not the lifestyle for me. Our compromise is tons of 69. And she does cum from oral, but not easily. Her problem led to a breakdown and eventually breakup with her last guy. But she's 6 years younger than me and i love her and can't keep my hands off her. And there may be light at the end of the tunnel for us.... i don't know if I could stay if i could never make her cum."
AskMen,3e127d,sleeplessinanytown,5,Tue Jul 21 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, sorry I'm late to the party but I have some advice for you that comes from a more credible source than perhaps some others. I also made a temp for personal reasons.  I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 6 years - no breaks. We're a young couple, she's 21, I'm 22. We're both fit and fairly good looking. She cannot have penetrative sex, and I want to share my story with you in the hopes you'll find comfort or at least better prepared for any decision you make.  So context: Got together early in our lives, despite this I had still been a player and slept with 2 other girls prior to our relationship, she had not. After 3 months of seeing eachother we tried to get it on. It didn't work, I couldn't get in her at all, she was in a lot of pain, so we stopped. We repeated this over the next 6 months, the same thing happened again and again, so we just found other ways to make eachother cum (heavy foreplay).   This continued for over 5 and a half years. She's a shy and gentle being, this attacked her self-confidence, self-worth, and induced anxiety that I would leave her for a 'better girl' - this caused innumerable situations of pain, difficulty, mistrust and arguments.   Whilst we had found a sexual alternative that I had settled for (she got GREAT at blowjobs and deepthroats, is always willing to give them to me), I still felt myself changing for the worse, and she had noticed too. I was more sexually frustrated despite cumming 4 - 7 times a week. I would check out girls a lot, chat to them, accept flirts etc etc. Over time I got a bit bitter in all honesty - but it was because she hadn't done much to fix the situation, not even a diagnosis (inb4 ""what a bitch"", she struggled mentally a lot with this issue - it isn't just a physical one. She wanted a good ploughing, she really did).  Anyway, I had a chat with her. It was less of a chat, more of an argument/lecture. Said she needed to get seen, because we were on a timeline where if there wasn't sexual development and progression, I would be going. It was hard for her, but she got checked out, and she was diagnosed with something to do with over-sensitive nerves causing her muscles to tense upon attempted penetration. She got given numbing cream and training dildos all for free (thank the Queen for the NHS).   Whilst we are working at the situation still (it's been about 4 months since our talk), there's light at the end of the tunnel and we are finally making progress. It's still incredibly difficult, but it's progress none the less.   Yes I got mad about the sexual life that I could have had (I had a lot of offers throughout my University life). Yes I sometimes still ponder on the nights that could have been. But my girlfriend has a whole level of appreciation for me that is quite remarkable really.   Whilst I would not recommend staying in a penetration-less relationship for 6 years I want to assure you it can be done, and it can be fun. Sure penetration is better, but she may get there one day depending on her issue. But she does need to make sure she gets checked out, because a self-diagnosis is probably a mis-diagnosis. Even if you are to break up with her, please do encourage her to try and see a health professional - the mental blockade is really hard to overcome.   Finally if you do consider staying with her, here's what you may be in for:   Aforementioned consistent pornstar blowjobs/deepthroats. A development of sexually 'submissive' traits that stem from the female wanting to compensate (could be limited to my experience, but I don't think it is). Due to the slow progress and a really awkward talk, I am now allowed to sleep with other girls, no strings attached. She does not sleep with other guys. This girl will probably be loyal and kind beyond boundaries because of all you've given up for her (again, could be limited to my experience, but I think it's applicable to other girls in the same situation). The knowledge that she isn't gonna fuck another guy when out (not much, but something). The upper-hand in all arguments ""OP you didn't take the trash out like I asked for the third time!"" ""You didn't fuck me like I asked for the millionth time, lol rekt"" (This last one might be a bit insensitive, but it's horribly true with a pinch of salt). Countless more intricacies. Good and bad. If you do want to contact me OP then do, I would love to help you, can't guarantee a response because of temp account, but don't rush to a breakup because of what some of the senseless comments from frustrated cave dwelling wankers whom lack creativity and assume penetration is be all and end all. Tbh, you may even have a better sex life with her than you would another girl who's able, it's such a relative situation Breakup only if you fully understand and doubt your abilities to participate.   By the way, this is my longest reddit post ever and I delayed breakfast for it, despite being on a temp account. So I really hopes it helps someone."
AskMen,3e127d,gideon_zotero,2,Tue Jul 21 11:26:15 2015 UTC,I'd ask to get it from other girls.
AskMen,3e127d,Sykryk,3,Tue Jul 21 05:30:09 2015 UTC,"So she'll never be able to have sex? Like never ever?   Sorry, but that's nothing I could handle. Sex is an important part of a relationship for me and I don't think I could be happy in sexless relationship.  Yes, you will feel like an asshole, but dating a girl because you feel pity for her doesn't seem right either."
AskMen,3e127d,Halafax,2,Tue Jul 21 06:47:09 2015 UTC,"Does she enjoy the physical intimacy otherwise, like cuddling naked? Also, this is just a guess, but you two sound very young. Health insurance is an extraordinarily complicated business that's hard for even pros to figure out, so I'm just wondering if she is in fact correct about how it would cost given the new health care law. Maybe check on that?  Keep the above in mind, because it sounds like your options are:   1) Stay, and have no sex. (Then you'll likely end up leaving later, because sex is important to you and this is probably going to drive you nuts and create resentment later.)  2) Stay, and have sex that isn't enjoyable (oral).  3) Stay, and try out sex toys, weird positions, and whatnot so that both of you get something out of the physical intimacy? Like you could try positioning a fake vagina so that it simulates PIV for you and allows her to enjoy the skin contact, caressing, etc.  4) Leave now.  Of course, if surgery was affordable, all the above options would be weighted differently."
AskMen,3e127d,mybustersword,2,Tue Jul 21 06:47:55 2015 UTC,"Do not have a relationship out of pity.  First of all you are not me, so don't open this door if you don't know what you are doing. I would have a open relationship. You can experience sex, love and connexion by proxy. But you need to have a clear understanding of where her mind is at all time. She will want to sacrifice more than is healthy to keep you, sense that shit out and stop whatever you are doing even if you are 10 seconds from passing our from pleasure and be with her. If you can't make this shit work for both of you, don't do it, just cut all the possible emotional pain and walk away now, because it won't get easier."
AskMen,3e127d,polyfionicspree,2,Tue Jul 21 07:04:28 2015 UTC,"If a good sex life is important to you - you know what you have to do.  Sorry amigo, but that's a big thing for a lot of people (me included) and it's not something I could do.  Good luck!"
AskMen,3e127d,scarabic,2,Tue Jul 21 12:53:27 2015 UTC,"Everything in life is a weight.  You have to choose which burdens you want to carry.  Emotionally, it's easier to pick up a weight than it is to drop one.    You describe this girl as great, but consider the long term cost.  She isn't keen on oral, and you're painting yourself into a corner.    As heart rending as it is, this isn't your issue, and it's a bad one to pick up if you like sex.  She understands she has a problem, but doesn't seem keen on working around the issues (apathy for oral).  And honestly, there are plenty of people with low or no libidos that wouldn't even notice this issue.    I've been in a dead bedroom situation, and it's crushing.  I tried to bear it all with good grace, but my libido was the one part of me I couldn't kill to survive in my situation.  I got bitter, and stayed that way.  My anger at the constant rejection was very unhealthy for me."
AskMen,3e127d,JaronK,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:40 2015 UTC,"I dated a girl who couldn't have sex and it was a hard decision but we decided to stick it out. Everything was great as we still enjoyed each other with oral, some anal play, and trying new things. I learned a lot about intimacy and love. She was seeing a therapist for her issue and everything was amazing.  It wasn't perfect but we were trying.   The issue came when she stopped trying. I know this type of girl. I loved this type of girl. I wanted to be there for her and to be different and hell I was different. Her issues became too much and her depression and discomfort made her lose the edge. We talked alot and it was clear she needed to be back in therapy to deal with the issue but she at that moment, gave up and couldn't. After some time trying to support her, I stopped wanting to be the only one trying and I gave up too. We broke up almost two years ago and I wish she got help by now. I honestly was not bothered by our arrangements, it even felt special. When they stopped being special and fun for her is when it stopped working.   Sexual disorders are very very hard and take an emotional toll. You may need couples therapy or she needs a knowledgeable sex therapist (there ain't many!) to make it work. She needs to never give up nonmatter how strained it is. Support that and you'll reinvent what you thought sex together was"
AskMen,3e127d,GasStationCoffee,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"I could date someone like that, hypothetically. But I'm poly and have other partners to satisfy needs she can't meet.   In mono world? I couldn't do that.   And in either case if she feels like giving orgasms is a ""chore"" then dating would be impossible for me. She should look for someone that is asexual."
AskMen,3e127d,emphesym,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"You're only an asshole if you're the one who made her this way. You're not an asshole for looking after your own needs. Staying with someone out of pity when your needs are not met leads to resentment on your part and an even greater disappointment on her part when you do eventually leave. She will also suffer the guilt and shame of every moment you are with her that she can't meet your needs.   There are men who don't care to have active inter course all that much and she may be perfectly happy with one of them. It's really a debilitating handicap she has, and the cruel twist is that she looks perfectly healthy and normal so she keeps attracting regular guys. If she were simply in a wheelchair or something there would be some up-front filtering going on."

AskMen,3e127d,beetnemesis,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:03 2015 UTC,"We've done oral, but it's not much fun cause she isn't able to orgasm, so it pretty much feels like a chore for her.   In a normal relationship, I'd say don't feel like she has to orgasm, every time. If she wants one, she should let you know.  In this situation, I'm not 100% sure how that applies.  That said, her expressing her affection, physically, for you should NEVER be labeled as a chore. Y'all are having sex, regardless of how how she participates.  If you're okay with other forms of pleasure (anal? HJ? BJ?) and no kids (probably? need more info) then you could stay. If vaginal sex is deal-breaker important to you (it is to me, I like making babies) then you should go. Do you think she'd want you to stay if you didn't want to be there?"
AskMen,3e127d,Madlutian,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"for people suggesting anal - why? if she doesn't like oral and isn't into clit stimulation, I doubt anal would be fine for her, especially since a lot of girls need clit stimulation during anal"
AskMen,3e127d,The__Y,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think you need to make a decision for yourself also in this situation. A lot of people on here are going to say how you are a great person for contemplating this and that sex isn't all that is involved with a relationship. However, I want you to think about your sanity. This is a new relationship and you have the ability to choose if you want to continue with it.   Sex is very important in a relationship as you are aware. In a relationship where sex/intimacy isn't present starts to take it's toll. Even if the reasons are medical as is your case.   There is nothing wrong if you decide this is not something you want to continue. You are not an asshole if you feel that you and your partner are not compatible for any reason. This is your life also man. Just because someone who you just started dating has a very unfortunate problem does not mean that you have to take the problem on yourself. This is why you date people, to see if you are compatible on different levels. If the situation was that you were with this girl for a while and a medical issue arose, then I would say that you should stick with it and help her out anyway you can. As I said though this is only another trait of a person you just started dating that you have to decide if it is something you can handle in a relationship. Just the same as any other trait like personality, musical tastes, looks, etc. If you didn't want to date someone because you 2 didn't have any hobbies or many interests that were similar then you wouldn't continue dating them. You would also find no issue there at all because you 2 weren't compatible.   While her situation is very unfortunate, it does not mean that it is something you have to now make your situation. I also would highly advise against continuing to date her if you feel that it is big issue. Don't ""give it a shot"" and see where things go or see if it is something you can deal with because in the end you will only end up hurting her. You aren't an asshole for making a decision about the women you date and the traits they have or the situations they are in. It is not wrong to make a decision about dating someone or not dating someone due to something about them. You would be an asshole if you knew that it would be an issue yet still tried dating them. You then leave and this person knows it's for the reason they were fearing. You then just reinforced their negative feelings about their condition along with breaking up with them. That is more of an asshole move than deciding that you 2 are not compatible at the beginning when just starting to get to know each other. I personally know that for me the lack of intimacy/sex would be a problem. Again, you decide. If it's just no sex, can other forms of intimacy suit you? If it's nothing sexual, how important is sex to you in a relationship?"
AskMen,3e127d,FurtiveNeptune,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:16 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know. I mean, there's other stuff than PiV sex- oral, anal, hand stuff, whatever.  I'd actually post over on AskWomen. Make sure you actually NAME the condition, and see if anyone who has it over there has advice. If it's Vaginimus, I've definitely seen that mentioned over there once or twice."
AskMen,3e127d,dvaunr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've got a friend. If you'd like a girlfriend, you're going to need someone else. If you're going to feel like an asshole, then do that, but at least you'll be a happy asshole rather than a miserable one."

AskMen,3e127d,Coidzor,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"I dealt with something similar just under a year ago. The girl I was with could have sex, but she had to be incredibly drunk so as to not tense up (I forget the condition). Even then, she said that her ex would basically just force his way in (still consensual, just had a lot a trouble getting in). She didn't necessarily enjoy it but would still get horny and want sex.   Anyways, we didn't work out. There was just too much stress involved. Sex is an important part of a relationship, especially if the relationship is to last and produce a family. While that might not necessarily be discussed right now, that is something you need to realize you'd potentially be giving up if you stay with this girl.   You would not be an asshole for leaving."
AskMen,3e127d,Pointless_arguments,4,Tue Jul 21 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"we aren't really dating.   Okay   she broke down and started crying, because every other guy she has ever dated has left her because of her medical condition   Uh huh   We've done oral,   Oh.  I'm pretty sure she thinks you're dating. I'm not really sure what her medical condition is that makes it impossible for her to have sex. Especially considering we live in a day and age where a man can have surgery to remove his penis and end up with a vagina capable of intercourse.  Has she tried anal? It might get her closer to the experience of vaginal intercourse, and may be enough to satisfy her partner.  Personally I wouldn't say you're a huge asshole for not wanting a relationship with someone you can't be intimate with. You're possibly an asshole though for letting it get months down the line and engaging in enough oral for it to become a chore before you decided to explore your feelings on this issue.  If I were her I'd feel used."

This girl has a unique perspective on life because of her condition.  Besides, there are plenty of ways you both can be sexual without penis-in-vagina sex.

Many problems that lead to painful sex can be improved with therapy or surgery and if you can fix them that way there arebother options like sticking to anal, oral, manual sex and other forms of physical intimacy or an open relationship. Don't feel like you have to stay with her, but if you truly like her enough to want to be with her, it could be worth trying, but if she's not flexible, don't feel like you have to shoulder all of the difficulty that comes along with it."

If her sexual organs are abnormal it may be considered cosmetic and that may be why it isn't covered by insurance.  Also, if you live in the United States many cosmetic surgeons take care credit . It's a credit card used specifically for medical and dental procedures that are not often covered by insurance. Don't know if this is an option, but it may help her chances of getting the surgery sooner rather than later since she can make payments on it."

But you know what you're looking for in a relationship, and the fact is that she isn't able to give you that.   It will feel terrible, but the truth is that you aren't responsible for her happiness. She hopefully isn't deliberately trying to hold that over your head, because if she was it would be just wrong. I totally support the idea of being as sympathetic as possible, since she obviously has a lot to deal with in her life, but at the end of the day the person you need to remember to look after is you. And allowing yourself to be put in a situation that doesn't make you happy, even if nobody else is making you do it, would just be irresponsible to yourself."

AskMen,3e2p1d,Amoner,39,Tue Jul 21 14:27:19 2015 UTC,"I sort of half-met her at a party back in mid-2000. She was just one of many acquaintances that I heard the name of, made an association with her face (as she was cute and happened to agree with me in the midst of a random conversation), and didn't really think much about her beyond that.  A year later, she, a close friend of mine (her closest at the time), and several others went to a concert and we hung out enough for me to be crushing on her big time. But my friend informed me that she was just staying with her mother for the Summer and would be leaving to go back home (quite far away) in a couple days. So I just sort of assumed we'd never see each other again and didn't bother to find out if she was interested in anything.  Right before Memorial Day weekend in 2002, our mutual friend calls me up in the evening and asks if I want to come hang with the two of them, as she's back in town for the Summer again. I jump at the chance. I end up spending the night there, our mutual friend goes to bed, and we stay up all night on the couch just talking about stuff and I can't believe how cool this girl is. I didn't kiss her then, though I probably should have.  Either way, I can't get her out of my head all weekend while I'm at a festival, and my best friend mocks me the whole time, like I'm making a bigger deal of this girl than is merited by a single night of hanging out.  I get back home, call her up, and we end up hanging out again a couple more times with our mutual friend and her boyfriend, see a few movies, and don't really worry about it being a ""date"" or anything. Our first real date is that weekend, in early June, and it goes incredibly well. We end up seeing each other several days a week from then on, drop the l-bomb within maybe a week or two, and are boning pretty consistently in a little less than a month.  At this point, I hadn't really even begun to think about marriage or kids or anything like that, though she did jokingly bring up what our kids might look like on the first date. A few months in, she spends a week in the hospital for issues related to her then-ongoing depression/bipolar disorder. Somewhere in dealing with all that, I become certain that this is the woman I will marry.  I ended up proposing 5 months into our relationship, because I just couldn't keep my mouth shut (I'd planned on waiting until Christmas). She's into it, we pick a ring and a date, and we end up marrying just a few weeks past our first anniversary the next June.  It's been more than 12 years since, and I haven't regretted it for a moment."

I remember her best friend asking me about it at a bar on Thanksgiving and confiding that I had in fact purchased it.

I've had guys I've never seen come ask me for advice on how to do a certain lift, for a spot, or even for a form check."
AskMen,3e2c1t,DrDerpberg,15,Tue Jul 21 12:39:20 2015 UTC,I have a job now so I can take him to a shopping mall and he can pick out gym clothes for himself.
AskMen,3e2c1t,The_Cheeki_Breeki,10,Tue Jul 21 12:41:47 2015 UTC,Tell him not to worry about looking cool at the gym. Worry about getting huge. He'll make buddies at the gym just by being consistent and going at the same time daily.
AskMen,3e2c1t,theslowwonder,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:36 2015 UTC,"If you know what size he is you really can't go wrong with 3-4 pairs of basketball shorts and regular t-shirts. I don't know if he'd be embarrassed to shop with you or what.   Some guys like skintight Underarmor and stuff, but honestly as a skinny guy he'll probably want sleeves and a regular T-shirt. By the time he wants better he'll have worn out the shirts you got him anyway.   The best thing you could do as far as fitness goes is make sure he understands that he will progress faster using proper technique but lower weights than he will by adding weight as soon as he can to impress people and letting technique slide. He also needs to understand nutrition better, but that's more of a reading project for himself long-term. I highly recommend the /r/fitness FAQ."
AskMen,3e2c1t,moonlightracer,9,Tue Jul 21 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"Do you know any of those things? You're talking about TDEE, macros, workout gear, etc so I'm assuming you have some level understanding. Why do you need strangers on the Internet to tell you what to tell him when you can just tell him all of that yourself?   Maybe get him to check out /r/fitness or learn about fitness yourself and then offer to go with him?   Tbh this is something he's going to have to learn on his own."
AskMen,3e2c1t,travelphotomoto,5,Tue Jul 21 12:41:50 2015 UTC,I started weightlifting last year so I have a good grasp of what fitness entails however I haven't seen any changes in his diet. He still eats junk food and doesn't eat as much protein (my mom cooks meat all the time) as he's supposed to. So this is why I'm asking for advice on how to encourage him without being so pushy.
AskMen,3e2c1t,Halafax,6,Tue Jul 21 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your invaluable insight, everyone. I'll take him to a shopping mall but I promise not to force to pick out the clothes. I'll let him choose what he wants and I'll pay.  I'll also let him know about the sivreddit Gotness."
AskMen,3e2c1t,_balance_,5,Tue Jul 21 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"As a guy that was that age once, I never learned to try clothes on to see if I liked them. I would just look at everything and say I didn't like it. If you can teach him anything, encourage him to try on things he might be 50% about, then be honest about how things look on him and how well they fit. Very few 18 year-old guys understand this stuff, and he'll feel more confident in his choices even if he complains a little."
AskMen,3e2c1t,dermanus,8,Tue Jul 21 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"Do you have a male friend that you can ask?  Or do any of your sisters?  I know this is a tall order to ask from someone, but hopefully you have some good friends that will be willing to help out one or two days a week.  Your friend can do a lot of the advice giving and then you can support and help him at home."
AskMen,3e2c1t,DrWhoisOverRated,4,Tue Jul 21 13:44:36 2015 UTC,"Honest answer?  Encourage him to find a male role model or teacher at the gym. I'm getting the vibe that you henpeck the shit out of him, and he probably doesn't appreciate that."
AskMen,3e2c1t,slwrthnu,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"Without trying to plant seeds of doubt, this seems very odd.     Yesterday, he went to the gym to start exercising and when he came back home, I've noticed that he didn't have anything with him. To elaborate, I didn't see a duffel bag or even a water bottle. I asked him if he has any gym clothes with him to which he replied, ""no.""   Is it at least possible that he didn't go to the gym at all?    As to your actual question, I dunno.  I had mixed luck taking advice from my older sisters.  I have 3 older sisters, they often felt more like aunts than siblings (they're all close together age wise, I was an accident five years later).  Our parents divorced when I was 4, they got stuck raising me.    Some of the things that they were trying to fix just weren't issues for me.   Their concerns  were relevant to their situation, but often not mine.    If you want to bring something up, do it.  Keep your tone neutral, don't use phrases like ""you should"" or ""If I were you"".  Present the advice and let him figure out if it's appropriate.  Try not to dwell on appearances, he's got very different issues.    Once it's out, let it be.  Even if he expresses interest in something you have to say, don't ask about it again.  If he has further questions, he will ask you.    If he's serious about working out, link him to one of the fitness subs here.  He can soak in as much good/bad advice as he wants.  Or male fashion advice, or whatever."
AskMen,3e2c1t,blankedinmyblank,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is for him to know you love him and be comfortable with you. This is not really something you can force, but it'll hopefully get easier since he's getting older.  You can be his friend and nag, a little, too. I'm not sure what he or your relationship is really like, but 'forcing' him to come with you so you can take him shopping is something I've seen a lot from older siblings. Lightly teasing him and schooling him a bit is also really normal, I've seen it under the guise of how to be attractive to women a lot. ""Listen dummy, I'm older and have been through this and want to make it easier for you"" is fine in most cases."
AskMen,3e2c1t,Witeout88,2,Tue Jul 21 13:00:02 2015 UTC,"Mostly, just let him do it. I'm sure part of this is trying to separate himself and ""be his own man"".  When I started I great results with StrongLifts 5x5. It's a beginners program that emphasizes building up your whole body.  Nutrition matters too, but let the sources he finds teach him about that. If he feels like his big sister is moving in on 'his' thing he may be less willing to listen."
AskMen,3e2c1t,Isansa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:56 2015 UTC,"Do you have a boyfriend or close male friend that could talk to him?  He might be a little more receptive to the advice coming from a guy, especially if he really wants a father figure."
AskMen,3e2c1t,mrnobody999,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:59 2015 UTC,The best thing you can do is be his friend. Don't try to be his father figure but as his friend you can give him all the same advice and not come off as the nagging sister. Go out to dinner and just talk with him and give him advice through casual conversation. If you just give him advice without the friend component you will come off as nagging and he is less likely to take it.   I grew up with a shit father figure that was gone by the time I was your brothers age and a sister that was two and a half years older than I. The friendship is what got both of us through it.
AskMen,3e2c1t,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are focusing on the actual method of lifting or how to get him clothes, when you're really looking for advice on how to help him pursue these things.  Well, it looks like he's already interested in lifting, which is by and large the most difficult part. You'll see on r/fitness all the time, people wondering how to get someone to be interested in lifting.  So, since he's interested, I suppose you could strike up a conversation with him about lifting and discuss his excitement or desire to get bigger. I started off skinny as hell (5'8"" and 110) too. Tell him about this place, r/fitness, that has tons of info and get him to take a look at it. You described him as shy, so I'm going to go out on a leg here and assume he's introverted, maybe a little neurotic. Again, this is sorta me. If so, then he should spend a shit ton of time on r/fitness and learn everything he needs to know. Back when I started, I spent hours and hours reading about lifting and learned the basics so as to go about it properly.  Perhaps if you introduce him to r/fitness by way of his newfound interest, he will be able to get the knowledge he needs about lifting and gaining properly.  As for the shyness, I'm not sure there's much you can do about it. College alone changed me from a quiet person to a normal person, because there were so many people to meet, and everyone was outgoing, because everyone who shows up knows no one at all. They're all in the same boat, so shyness generally doesn't last too long.  As for the lifting in casual clothes, I'd just tell him that sweating and lifting in them looks weird and they'll get messed up. Buy him some clothes, or if he's game, take him to buy some."

I don't know what your relationship with your younger brother is like. Me and my older sister (just a year older) were always close-yet-adversarial, but I don't think I would pay any attention to her tips. I would probably, yep, view her as a nagging sister in this scenario. I would recommend maybe dragging him along to go shopping, and see if he might be down with you buying him some gear. Just be kinda subtle. Other than that - growing up and figuring things out can be an organic process. I'm sure he's capable enough to figure some things out on his own as well."

The most helpful thing for me was setting up scheduled times. This way he can't say ""I'll just go later"" and then never go. It also lets you plan working out into your day a lot easier.  Secondly, eating more is hugely important. High protein in particular, but one of the more fun benefits is that you can just eat more.   Oh and for me setting up the schedule with my roomate was really really helpful with consistency. It's just more fun to go with someone who has similar goals, and its a lot harder to justify missing a day to someone else."

He will make a lot of new friends where he can learn from. Fitness is far from ideal because you barely have contact with others.  Taking him out for a shopping spree is nice but make sure he chooses the clothing with some tips from you, instead of you picking out all the clothing and he just tries it.  Let him develop his self and advice him where necessary or when he asks for it.  He is lucky to have a caring sister like you just take him out to do fun stuff."

I suggested making a new friend or talking to some of the personal trainers/gym regulars but he refuses - I think it's because he's shy.   or because he is a guy, you know the thing about never asking for directions.   I don't want him to injure himself especially when he's new to weight lifting.   I know, it's great you want to look out for him, but fucking shit up and breaking a few things are what men do, that is how we carve a way trough life(it's not the smartest way I give you that but that is the only way to build caracter). The only reason you are so concerned and don't trust him is because he did not have a father to shield him from all the smothering.

AskMen,3e3f02,gotthelowdown,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"Didn't ask out that one girl. Never had instant chemistry with anyone else after that.   I think this Psychology Today article is relevant:  If Only... Gender Differences in Sexual Regret: Women regret sex without relationships. Men regret relationships without sex.   Excerpt:   The three biggest regrets of women were, in descending order: losing their virginity with the wrong partner, cheating on a partner, and letting relationships progress to sex too quickly. The three most common male regrets were: being too shy to indicate sexual attraction to someone, not being (sexually) adventurous enough in their youth, and not being adventurous enough during their single days.  . . . Women, according to this logic, have been evolutionarily programmed to regret (and thus stay away from) taking unnecessary risks (""Why did I sleep with this bum?""). Men, however, are programmed to regret missed fertilization opportunities (""Why didn’t I try to sleep with her?”)."
AskMen,3e3f02,timeqube,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the article was an interesting and surprisingly funny read.   What I found surprising was that apparently, ""over all, action is regretted more in the short term while in the long term, inaction regrets predominate.""   I believe that's because humans can't deal well with uncertainty (having read the article, maybe you're also familiar with what Kahneman wrote on that matter). It's comparatively easy to live with the unpleasant consequences of rejection, but the constant asking of ""what if"" after not having tried... that remains for quite some time. Which is exactly why I regret not having had the confidence to ask the girl out back then, despite her being obviously interested."

Then one day she hit me with ""do you want to be with me forever, because if not, then let me go."" so I did. And she wasn't happy about it. Called her Bluff and once again the verbal abuse started.

AskMen,3e13ih,gluten_free_asbestos,10,Tue Jul 21 12:19:48 2015 UTC,"One girl was cute and all, so I teased her and called her a ""brat"" in a cute fashion. She took too much of a liking to it I guess and would flirt with me and constantly call me one. Variety is the spice of life - don't reuse my little flirty insult a billion times on me. It got to the point where I'd cringe, and I'm a very level headed, tolerant person."
AskMen,3e13ih,clydex,8,Tue Jul 21 10:44:57 2015 UTC,"he told me he hated all seafood   I do too but that's because I'm allergic and could die.  As for the weirdest reason I lost interest in someone, I was talking to a girl that was into anime and I like some anime so I thought it'd be tolerable. She however would say things like, ""So kawaii"" or however it's spelled, and that annoyed me so much. One day I said, ""You're not Japanese, quit using those words throughout conversation. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not cool."" Yeah, she stopped talking to me after that one."
AskMen,3e13ih,Vaidurya,8,Tue Jul 21 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"She had the wrappers, bags and other detritus from at least a dozen McDonald's meals scattered all over the floor of her car.  Her car was a disgusting mess, smelled bad, and when I asked her about it, she off-handedly commented that she probably had McDonalds at least every other day, and sometimes more like once a day.  She was hot, cool, not over weight, but I couldn't get past the messy car and the regular McDonald's eating."
AskMen,3e13ih,DieRealeAdolfHitler,13,Tue Jul 21 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"I went to the liquor store with her to pick out a sixer. We stood at the cooler and I said ""just grab one that you like"". She got nervous, blushed a little, and was downright stumped as what to do. It was weird and really akward so I just said, ""I like everything, just pick one that you would like to drink tonight."" She became even more flustered. Now it was getting really weird, it had been several minutes. She began to inch towards me and just say, ""can't you just pick one?"" Super weird. So I said, ""I really like everything, I just want to get something you like."" She sort of started to tear up, ""Can you just pick one?"" So I finally gave in and grabbed one. The rest of the night I couldn't get it out of my mind. What on earth would cause her so much stress and fear about picking out a six pack of beer. I decided I didn't want to find out, that was our last date."
AskMen,3e13ih,ReallyBadAtSpelling,4,Tue Jul 21 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"A long time ago, this was me. I hate lagers (live in the US) and didn't discover ciders or wheat beers until I was 26.

AskMen,3e13ih,illyrianya,33,Tue Jul 21 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"When I saw a long, dark yellow stain on her underwear. When she talks about negative stuff and can't talk about good stuff when encouraged. When her breath smells like alcohol and cigarettes. When I see her always surrounded by thirsty men and had piercing eyes that gave me a vibe of a man-eater."
AskMen,3e13ih,missingherdearly,137,Tue Jul 21 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"Heads up, that yellow stain can be normal. Vaginal secretions are of a basic ph to help protect the vaginal environment, and over long periods of time, the discharge build up slowly bleaches the underwear. It's COMPLETELY normal over time.  Idk vaginas are messy."

AskMen,3e13ih,rdrptr,5,Tue Jul 21 07:56:24 2015 UTC,"She drank too much and loved taco bell. She wasn't an alcoholic or acted out of control, just drank more than I would like to. I'm more meat-heady and it just clashes with my lifestyle. It'd cause more problems then it's worth.   My current girlfriend hits the sauce, (she's dating me.. She has to.. Amirite?), but she's different about it, if that makes sense."
AskMen,3e13ih,SilentWest,4,Tue Jul 21 12:46:47 2015 UTC,She had a text message signature in 2015 like some kind of fuckin pilgrim
AskMen,3e13ih,Nick-Cage,4,Tue Jul 21 13:30:33 2015 UTC,"She was really passive. Never asked follow up questions when we first met. Every conversation was one-sided. When I asked her what she was up to it was always ""nothing"" (even if she had actually done something interesting). Never knew what she wanted to order at restaurants. Never offered input of any kind with date ideas and activities, she deferred to my opinion on everything.  It was literally like dating a robot. You wanna mean something more to a person?

AskMen,3e13ih,Nowhere_Man_Forever,3,Tue Jul 21 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"She was one of those girls that was all about wine and had a large glass every night. Whenever we went out ""Do you have any wine?""  Then whenever she had a glass in her hand she would accentuate all her words with the hand holding the glass and almost put on an act of being this hawty-tawty sophisticated woman who clearly wasn't understood or appreciated as she should be, kinda like she thought she was better than everyone. You know how some people pick up smoking to look cool? Yeah she was like that but with wine.  It doesn't make you look sophisticated or fancy, it makes you look like an alcoholic."
AskMen,3e13ih,LiamName101,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"The moment I realized I needed to break up my-then girlfriend was when we were at one of those exploratariums in CA, and she told me she was bored.   Bored.   At an exploratorium.   I knew right then this wasn't going to work."

I don't know, it's not like cumming is a better word, but it's what we're all used to, and just hearing it said in such plain terminology took me out of the mood because I was laughing so hard at her.  Now, if a girl is moaning, tensing up her legs, bucking her hips, and says, ""Oh God I'm cumming,"" there's nothing wrong with that.

She might be looking long term, she might not. It's too early for that; just focus on finding out if you're compatible (it sounds like you could be)."
AskMen,3e2j51,dermanus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:59 2015 UTC,We had been drinking about 3 US pints each (we are Canadian so we are use to bigger pints) and she kissed me.

She's still being cautious by meeting you there, but that's OK.    I think you should go have fun.  And, if it goes equally well, don't wait for her to make the move.  Invite her over."
AskMen,3e2j51,BoyNotToy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought of the cautious part.  I also offered to pay her drinks and apps on the first date but she didn't want me to.  Any small tips for tonight?  What to talk about, how to dress so on and so forth..."
AskMen,3e2j51,BoyNotToy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"Well, for what it's worth, I think you need up your game a little bit for this date.  You already let her know you're a great guy.  Now, let her now you're interested and exciting.  Dress up nice, maybe a little cologne.  Show her that you're trying to impress her.  I think you're already good at talking to her, so just do what comes naturally.  But, try to find a way to touch her hand or arm during dinner.  Offer to share a bite of your food.  Ask her what kind of men she usually dates.  Just turn the sexy up from 2 to 5.  The big move will be to invite her over.  If she declines that offer, that's OK, because she'll know you're interested.  She might counter her excuse with a mention of date three.  That would mean she'd be more open for a stop at your place after date three."
AskMen,3e2j51,Angerandhate,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:12 2015 UTC,Seems like you still got it. Like riding a bicycle. Just relax and be yourself.
AskMen,3e2j51,Sykryk,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:44 2015 UTC,"Just gonna say, based off whats posted, what I as a girl would like:   Kiss her at some point (when you have a private moment), make a clear move so she knows you're interested  Have something in mind to do after dinner, in case it goes well, don't wanna have to just part ways if the night is young. Can be as simple as having a cool place in mind for after-dinner coffee (or drinks), if the mood is right could always invite her back for the same at your place."
AskMen,3e2j51,myopinionisvalid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:32 2015 UTC,"She competes in a boat race and from the hints I got maybe she's saving all her physical energy for that race.  She was telling my how sore she was after practice last night.  I told her I was good at massages and offered her one.  She said ""Ill keep that in mind post-competition ;)"" Its this weekend.  Since you're a girl if you initiated the kiss last date would that mean you were more than serious?  Was told not to kiss her hello unless she does.  Is this accurate?"
AskMen,3e2j51,gideon_zotero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but try not to go in thinking ""nothing physical will happen"" because it might cause YOU to give off not-interested signals. Just stay balanced, it may happen, it may not, just feel it out as the night progresses.    Since you're a girl if you initiated the kiss last date would that mean you were more than serious? Was told not to kiss her hello unless she does. Is this accurate?   It would mean I was very into him and wanted to move thing along physically. It would mean I definitely want to see him again. Whether it means she's more serious is hard to say though, some girls only move forward physically with guys they want to be committed with, while some just know what they want physically and go for it.    Was told not to kiss her hello unless she does. Is this accurate?   As long as you make a move at some point, I don't think a hello kiss is necessary. Even with my boyfriend we don't kiss hello, it seems a bit much, but then maybe I'm conservative in that regard.  I think a cheek kiss would be appropriate - not so forward as direct kiss, but to convey more intimacy than just a hug or handshake."
AskMen,3e30mn,_ism_,17,Tue Jul 21 15:54:41 2015 UTC,Depends on what city I live in and what life stage I'm in.  In NYC or a similar public transit-enabled city? Sure.  In suburbia? Nope.

Basically it's like this, if you are still in a position where you have to question if her having a car is a deal-breaker, are you in a financially secured state to tackle another mound of stress onto your life? If you are well adjusted and wouldn't be burdened by someone less financially off, then sure, go for it.

The LA/Culver City area has decent enough public transportation that I would understand not having a car to take advantage of the buses.  It would also depend on whether or not she had her own place, I guess.  If she didn't have a car, but had her own apartment with a parking spot (that would hopefully be vacant as she doesn't have a car), I would date her so long as driving to her place took less than an hour.

My advice is not to demand a raise until you've secured an offer from another company, less you risk being jobless. Truth is, going to another job for a higher pay is just a lateral move for your career. Do what's best for you."

AskMen,3e34l1,Kim-Jung-Illmatic,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"I have never left a job I like for more money, but I'm pretty much in the opposite situation as you, so I will give my two cents regardless:  Finding a job that you genuinely enjoy doing, is hard. It seems like you're in a dream position, apart from the salary. You have to ask yourself this: do you think you can enjoy the other type of job? I'm not asking whether it will be as enjoyable as your current job. I'm asking if you think it will be enjoyable at all? Will it come close to your current position at the very least? If not, then maybe you should reconsider?  Money is great. I'm earning a fuck-ton right now working as full-time substitute for a big public company. Seeing as I do my job well and the fact that 2 or 3 people are quitting, I could definitely have asked for a proper full-time contract. But I wont.  My current job has nothing to do with what I studied(Computer Science). I never feel challenged or motivated by my work. I just show up, do my duties, usually without any challenges at all, and then I go home. I've only been around for about half a year, and I'm already starting to hate my job, even though it's actually not a bad place to be at all. The colleagues are nice, the commute is short and simple, the pressure is relatively low, the benefits(apart from the high salary) are great, and my bosses are decent people as well. But to me, it's just not worth it when I feel no purpose, have no motivation, don't like what I'm doing and never feel that my brain is being properly challenged.  I get that money is important. I'm a year younger than you and just got married myself, so I can totally get it. I guess it all comes down to two things:   Do you think you can enjoy a new position after your current job? What is important to you in a work place? I personally find it soul-crushing to merely ""go to work""."
AskMen,3e34l1,ballepung,3,Tue Jul 21 16:49:11 2015 UTC,I did the opposite.  I went from a very well paying job to one that I enjoyed for less money.  Totally worth it.

AskMen,3e34l1,Mr_Lovette,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"So, I make a lot, like 7 figures.   Here's some truths:  If you want to make more you need to move.    In moving you take a risk.  In that risk there is reward.  That said, the biggest impediment to moving for most people is inertia.  It's easier to do nothing and bitch about it rather than go through the trouble of doing your CV, doing phone interviews, interviewing and then moving to the new job.  Once at said new job you have to figure everything out all over again.    The best way to make more is to get the offer (it's proof that you are worth it and ammunition when going to HR for and exception pay increase) and then get the counter.  Me, I moved and it was worth it.  Then I moved again and it wasn't.  So, I moved again and it was really worth it.   The nature of the U.S. economy is changing rapidly -- when you entered the workforce (let's say in 2007) you entered and environment that was in active collapse.  Now that the markets have recovered people are retiring.  This is creating motion in the job market.  Seize that and use it to your advantage.  Also, remember a few other facts:  The more you make the more you can save for retirement.  You shed the inertia that prevents you from maximizing you income and being able to secure the future for your wife and your children (education's just going to keep getting more expensve).  Also look at that $7k deficit in terms of what it means to your 401k value over the next 30 years.  If you max out your 401k that can easily add up to serious money."

I was talking to my friends recently and one said he prefers 5'5-5'9 and one said a few inches shorter than him is the shortest he would go (he is 6')  I doubt my friends and AM posters actually care about height that much... in those threads, if we look at those guys girlfriends, I doubt they all hit the height requirements. height matters a lot less than other body things for guys."

If my girlfriend made no effort to stay healthy, be attractive to me and keep me sexually satisfied, I'd leave her. We're sharing our lives, so we ought to make sure we don't fuck up our lives and therefore our sweetheart's by being intentionally unhealthy, and we keep each other pleased and sexually satisfied, so I take good care of myself, she does, we agree on how we prefer to be shaven/groomed/not and clothes we both like, I keep her pussy wet, she keeps my cock hard, I try to be the most attractive I can to her, she does the same, and if I'm not feeling like it and she wants sex I offer to eat her pussy, while she does the same for me. Keeping each other's needs fulfilled is key to a successful relationship.  If you did heroin, which is very unhealthy, would it be ok if she asked you to quit? If you drove a bike at 100 Km/h through the city, which is quite dangerous and can get yourself hurt or in trouble, would it be ok if she asked you to drive more carefully? So why is it a problem to tell you that you're eating shit that's bad for you and that she wants you to be healthier and take good care of yourself?"

With the guy I'm currently seeing, it started off with him making comments about my weight. I used to be chubbier (albeit not chubby) and he saw an older, heavier picture of me and said ""Wow, I don't know why you decided to lose all your curves!"" He'd also make mock pained noises when I snuggled him because I was ""hurting"" him with my skinny body. (I'm not underweight, if it matters.)  I straight up told him if you don't like my body you don't have to come by anymore. He apologized, said he was just trying to help (??) and since then calls me beautiful all the time.

What women turn their nose up rather often about is that I have a hairy chest, legs and arms. Only slightly more than average. I just tell them it is a scratching post for my women. But over all, the women i've been with enjoy my body.  However, women have criticized me on things not body related.

There is no such thing as a perfect partner. the take away should not be ""I am not good anough"", but rather ""...and despite this, you're still here""  And to be clear I am not talking about thinking positive or any of that feel good mindgame, I am talking about allowing your partner to be a external beacon to guide you trough bettering yourself as a man or woman, not negesaraly for them, but for you."

AskMen,3e174x,psychicsword,9,Tue Jul 21 18:03:09 2015 UTC,Negotiation 101 is that you should never be the one who says the first number. For all you know they were about to offer you $5k on top of what you thought you were worth.   When I was looking for my last job I was making $76k and I started to ask for $80k. My recruiter knowing I wouldnt get an offer for less than $85k submitted my resume requesting at least that. I then got an offer for $90k and he talked it up to $93k. I would have missed out on a significant portion of that $13k/year if I had started with what I thought I deserved. While I am in the software business and we are mostly overpaid the same idea transfers elsewhere.

AskMen,3e174x,Frostatine,3,Tue Jul 21 11:38:25 2015 UTC,"""My salary requirements are determined by the level of work required. I can give you a ballpark range of x-y and negotiate a more solid number when I have a grasp on what the position entails.""  Advertised ranges of salary are only set in stone for headhunters and giant corporations that will be shitty to work for if you are even considering asking for me than the offer. I started 2$ an hour higher than the 'cap' listed for my position by holding off on giving a solid figure until after I had a great interview and near perfect technical exam to use as leverage. I negotiated this will 60 dollars to my name and no idea how I was going to feed myself if one of my two offers didn't pull through. So never be afraid to ask for more.  Also the whole ""Oh I have other offers I'm considering"" thing is just cheesy and should never come up unless it directly conflicts with a scheduled interview. HR people and company owners aren't stupid and acting aloof just isn't professional. Make it easier to hire you, don't pretend you're some prize they have to work for. This isn't dating after all."
AskMen,3e174x,MrGreggle,3,Tue Jul 21 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"If you say the first number always make it too high. If they say the first number they made it too low. These are starting points. Figure out your actual target and add to it.  The first one to give a number is at a disadvantage. If they ask you during the interview process or application process simply tell them something like ""I'm familiar with the market, and I know my skillset is in high demand. I'm expecting something competitive."" If you're forced to put a number in a box put your previous salary and state that you felt you were being underutilized and are looking for a fair market rate and a position where your limits are more likely to be tested and expanded.  Always use firm language. Don't ever say something like ""I was hoping for..."" Say ""I was expecting at least $x."" When you say something weak you're giving them permission to give you an excuse. If they know they lowballed you and you state an expectation then they will feel they need to win you back.  This is where you must be ready. Use a site like glassdoor and find out the salary range in your area for the job title you are pursuing. State something towards the high end and that what they offered is not competitive with what the market has to offer you.  They may try to come back with factors internal to the company. These are not valid excuses.  We don't have that much budgeted for the position -> How much they budget has nothing to do with you. If they want someone of your qualifications then they need to compete with what other employers offer.  Our other employees of similar position don't make that much -> Another internal factor. State that your compensation is tied to the market, not to them.  They don't believe that's the market rate -> Tell them you've researched it extensively and know what the rate is.  Being armed with knowledge is essential. Assuming them know more than you about the market and letting them correct you surrenders all the power. Trust your research, and even if they DO know more just continue act confident. Nobody has perfect definitive numbers.  They should come up from their number now unless they really can't go higher. Either way the correct response is to give a very thoughtful ""hmmm"". At this point you threaten THE strongest negotiation tactic: walking away. Ask them how soon they need an answer. They'll give you a date and you should thank them and begin to leave. Then, at the last second turn around and say something like:  ""I'm pretty far into the interview process at another company and I feel like it's going well. I'm meeting with the CTO/some higher up on [day within the timeframe they need an answer]. I am expecting an offer, but I really like your company and want to work here. If you can give me $x then I'll let them know I've gone with another offer and we can lock this up right now.""  If they accept then great. If not get back to them at the end of the timespan they gave you. There's a good chance you get a call with an improved offer if you let them stew in doubt for a while.  With these tactics you should hit somewhere between your goal number and the high number you opened with."

AskMen,3e3nir,Crayshack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think openness about one's desires is important.  Even if it is unlikely or impossible for the other person to fulfill your desires, it makes relationships run much smoother if you are open and honest in general.  For me personally, it would need to be something revealed at least to some extent before sexual contact begins in the first place.  I doubtful that I can have an enjoyable encounter without some sort of kink involved, so it would be important to me to reveal at least some of my kinks early on."
AskMen,3e3nir,AverageUnknown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. Several. Some of them aren't things that can be really acted out.  The simpler BDSM-related stuff I'd definitely disclose. The really weird, non-act-upon-able ones, probably not."

AskMen,3e3cfd,Locem,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"Good luck finding room to breathe, let alone get down on one knee in that crowd  It's cold, it's crowded, it's a bitch to get there and to get out of there.  You will be surrounded by a lot of drunk people.  To get a halfway decent spot you have to get there many hours in advance and you will have nowhere to go to the bathroom.  NYE in times square is notoriously one of the most miserable events in the city and actively avoided by most inhabitants of the area.  An alternative though would be to find parties from clubs/bars/venues in the area that overlook the ball dropping.  They usually sell tickets in advance for the event, and will be expensive.  More conducive and comfortable to hopefully propose though."
AskMen,3e3cfd,SnoopyFandango,7,Tue Jul 21 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"This is very true. We usually like to start the night off at McSorley's and get sauced with new friends, then go out to eat and a local restaurant (make reservations), and later find a small bar with a fun band."

It's packed with 1 million people, you have to get there hours in advance and stand in the cold. The ball drop is kinda boring in person, trust me I only wasted one NYE on it.   Plus honestly, unless you work in the office buildings, there is nothing of value in Times Square. Some electronic billboards, terrible chain restaurants and an asshole who calls himself Naked Cowboy."

Public proposals suggest a need to attract attention to yourself rather than expressing that intimacy and desire to be with someone in marriage.

But more so than that, idk if you've ever been to NYE in NYC but it's not that romantic of a setting. You're kept in fenced off areas for hours and you can't leave them without losing your spot. People wear diapers incase they need to go to the bathroom while they're waiting. You're probably going to be tired from standing for so long and hungry and thirsty. If you want to give her a nice, romantic speech then she probably won't be able to hear you that well either.   Idk. There are so many more preferable travel destinations that you could do it at."

Watch it!  The way its presented makes it look like a level-by-level video game.  2) The ""3D"" tagline.  Ironically, this is a movie that did 3D right and applied it in a way meaningful to the plot.  3) Reminding people of the 1995 Dredd.  This was kind of unavoidable, but I'm sure it had something to do with the box-office failure.  In reality it was gritty, well-written, and awesomely executed action movie.  I think its a modern classic."

Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor, and he's not the only one who's doing a terrific job, but none of that matters when it seemed to me that the writers stretched it out and had the characters do what the plot required of them instead of what I perceive as natural development. Walter and Skyler especially. Plus, I feel they did a cop-out with the son. Instead of having to write a teen and how he's affected by his fathers sickness, on top of his own disabilities, they turned him into a one-dimensional gimmicky caricature. Timmy from South Park had better writing than Walt Jr., no joke, at least I felt something when he had to set Gobbles free.  I was really disappointed, but watched the whole thing because everyone but the writers were doing a truly incredible job.  Oh, wow. Totally not the place for this. Sorry for the rant."

I JUST WANT MY FAMILY BACK"" but they clearly intended to give off that vibe to subvert your expectations. I won't go into any detail save to say that the movie is great.  Nightcrawlers trailer was shit. It put every explosion in the trailer and made it seem like a low budget action movie with fast cars. Jake Gyllenhal is so good in this movie. So much so that he's moving closer into DiCaprio territory in that I'm inclined to give anything he's in the benefit of the doubt and assume it's a great movie.  Rick and Morty is a show that surprised me. It looked stupid. I assumed it was gonna be a Tim and Eric can't enjoy it unless you're blazed for twenty hours of the day. It's a great show.

I was completely blown away by the quality of the movie.    Book: RA Salvatore's books.  Say what you will about the rest of his writing qualities, but I have never encountered another author even half as good as him at writing a fight. I've read quite a large number of books from famous authors to nobodies and... Again, the man is a genius for writing fights.    TV: Gilmore Girls.  I sat down to watch the first episode of this show with my mom (she introduced me to Buffy, so I wasn't exactly going into it with bottom tier expectations).

Returning home after being away and feeling displaced is a pretty common feeling, and she gets that very well and represents it in the novel almost too well. Then, you get this ""everyone in my life is racist but me"" theme that works too. I can't help but think the book's publication (no matter its backstory) is remarkably well-timed with race tensions in the south and between cops and people of color everywhere running high. How DO people who were once such upstanding allies for people of color become racist assholes? Well, they were always racist, and always had shit to deal with, and when threatened, they can lash out.   I don't think the way the book has been released is fair to Harper Lee and I don't think it's the sort of book that everyone in high school is going to be required to read, but it's not awful and I think people should give it a chance.

I was fully expecting it to be full of cringeworthy attempts at humour, but goddamn if it wasn't actually really dry and witty. I'm usually not super into Vampire movies, but this one was a nice departure from how they usually are.  Show: BoJack Horseman. The first half of season one was okay at best. Second half was strong. Second season is just incomparable. I've yet to see a show that does such a good job of making their main character a loveable asshole. BoJack is awful to himself and everyone around him, but you want him to succeed so bad. It's definitely more of a tragicomedy than straight comedy. Especially the episode with Charlotte in season two.  Book: House of Leaves. I don't scare easily. This book terrified me. It's unsettling on a deep level that leaves me unable to sleep whenever I get into it. It really conjures up this feeling of dread in my stomach. Then again it's very good at show, don't tell.

Since you've always been thin, I suspect that you've got a fast metabolism. You're going to have to eat, a lot. Add about 1000 calories if you want to put on weight. Weigh yourself monthly and see how it goes. If you're not gaining weight, eat more.   As for training, you can do bodyweight exercises, i.e. push-ups, squats etc. If you've got a little spare cash, a pull-up bar and a decent kettlebell are cheap investments that can pay off big time. Get a decent routine, train three times a week. Work out your whole body. Don't be an idiot and skip leg workouts, you're going to look like a tool otherwise."
AskMen,3e20yl,fishpondlifeguard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:32 2015 UTC,If you have room at home you can buy a second hand weight bench and weights off ebay.  There's always people selling them. Buy a good weight training book like this one that describes exercises for different body parts (there's heaps out there) or watch videos on YouTube.  Walking or running is good if you are interested in staying lean but being fit.  I hike a lot... which keeps me fit and my weight down. It totally depends what you are trying to achieve.  I personally am not interested in a lot of muscle. If you want to build a lot of muscle a gym will most likely be essential. Eating properly will also be important.

What did you do, and how did it work out for you?   I focused on showing her what a normal loving relationship is supposed to be like. I helped her create some emotional boundaries all while watching out for my own, because it's very easy to become codependent in cases like this and while it feels great in the moment you can not allow it to turn into another abusive relatioship, be it a emotional one.

I wasn't a doctor so all I could be was a supportive.  How did it work out?  Horribly.  1/10.  If I had a time machine I would go back and never get involved with her horribly.

AskMen,3e1skm,cassie-pants,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a guy, but I was previously in an abusive relationship (a much better relationship now), so I hope I can give some advice. My situation was more mental/emotional than physical, so some of this might not apply (I'm not sure what hers was).  I strongly encourage getting her to talk to a therapist regularly, if she isn't already. This is super important. If she's having PTSD symptoms more than once in a blue moon, it's important to talk to someone who is equipped to help. It's also easier to open up to an unbiased third party. You might want to speak with a counselor, too.   Try to be patient and not judgmental. Early on in my relationship, I worried that my boyfriend would ask me things like ""How did you get yourself into that situation? I would never let that happen to me!"" (He hasn't, he's awesome.) This is really hard to hear - it's not like my ex immediately cut me off from my friends and family on the first date. It just builds up gradually, and you don't see it coming. My boyfriend doesn't press me with questions, but is open to me talking about it if I want to.   I'm not sure if by ""occasionally"" you mean it's happened once or twice over an extended period of time, or her PTSD symptoms happen once a week. You might want to consider holding off on the relationship if she's not coping well right now, for the most part. I lost a lot of confidence and trust in myself, and was nowhere near ready for a relationship for months after my abusive one ended. I had to rebuild trust for me alone, and being in a relationship would have hindered that.   Hope this helps and it's okay to post even though I'm a girl. Good luck OP!

AskMen,3e1skm,raceAround126,0,Tue Jul 21 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"Short version: run away.  Long version:   Girls who have told me they had an abusive relationship usually cannot back it up. No police reports, told me within the first few hours of knowing me and really couldn't give specifics. They use it as a victim card to make you sympathize and let your guard down.  A couple of girls I've been with who later told me were far more believable simply as they had the body language to support it as well as the fact that they reported it to police. I would say these were fairly damaged though.  One such girl told me she had been a rape victim. Given I know how my cousin was after her ordeal, the body language was pretty much unmistakable as well as her intimacy issues. Over a few weeks, those came down and we took things nice and easy and slowly. It wasn't until she got super-needy that the psychological effects really started coming out. She would get major mood swings and paranoia. She knew we were not exclusive and I never hid it. It was when she got an unhealthy paranoia over me seeing my sister one weekend that I decided enough was enough.  So if she says she had an abusive relationship or what have you, regardless of whether it's true or not, I would not deal with. If it's true, just wait for the psychological effects to come out. If it's not true, that's pretty dangerous for you as you never know what the fuck she'll do later down the line if she's fine with lying about that."

AskMen,3e1egx,YurislovSkillet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:23 2015 UTC,"OK I love all kinds of sad songs but I think a lot of them are not easy to get into, but here's my short list anyway. Maybe someone will find something they'll like:  EELS- It's a Motherfucker a very short but perfect description of grief, can't link the preferred studio version though.  SPAIN-Easy Lover. dreamy and dramatic  SUN KIL MOON-Carry Me Ohio A perfect song to reminisce about past times and missed chances.  JEFF TWEEDY-At My Window Sad and Lonely A wonderfully honest folk approach to loneliness and missing somebody.  RYAN ADAMS-Come Pick Me Up Ryan Adams' discography is just great for sad times, this is just one example. I encourage to dive into his repertoire.  TOM WAITS-Take It With Me. A very raw and devastating song for troubled minds, best enjoyed while crying in the dark with a glass of whiskey.  WALKMEN-Many Rivers to Cross A cover version of a classic Jimmy Cliff Reggae/Gospel song. I think this version brings across the helplessness a lot better and, through powerful scream-singing, takes a dramatic and relinquishing turn as it progresses.  BRIGHT EYES-Land Locked Blues A simple and poetic scoring of depression. This used to wreck me a lot.  BON IVER-I Can't Make You Love Me. Bon Iver is a classic recommendation for sad times and break ups and this beautiful cover is no exception.  CHET BAKER- I'm a Fool to Want You. A Jazz piece for the more sophisticated melancholy times. Chet Baker is just great for the evening.  BONNIE ""PRINCE"" BILLY- I See a Darkness The lyrics in this are just incredible. Arguably it's more suitable to express a permanent depression rather than dealing with a concrete event, such as break-ups. It hits hard nontheless.  BECK-Guess I'm Doing Fine. Beck's album ""Sea Change"" is fantastic, highly recommend it.  CAT POWER- The Greatest. A song for the setting sun. Beautiful voice.  SONGS: OHIA-Lioness. To me, Jason Molina created the most depressing music out there. His solo act and 2 bands (Songs: Ohia, Magnolia Electric Corp.) hit like trucks. He drank himself to death in 2013 and his pain and suffering shines through in almost everything he wrote. another song  THE STREETS- Dry Your Eyes. Very visual and emotional spoken-word depiction of a break-up."

There is however flirty laugh and that may not even be voluntary, most often than not it isn't but that does not matter, your feelings are legitimate even if she just reacts to a naughty joke and she should account for them.  I just take it as disrespectfull. I am not smelling skirts around her, so I think a bit of restraint is reasonable.

AskMen,3e1n6b,Trueartiscan,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:03 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult one because the way dating/hooking up currently works is that the man goes up to the woman to seduce/impress her.  So in a relationship, the girl always has plausible deniability because the dude was coming onto her.  Conversely, 99% of the time, you're not going to have girls coming up to you to make you laugh and come onto you.  So obviously it's easy for men to not cheat or flirt, they have to go out of their way to do it (in general).  I've always had trouble with it, but what I do now is tell my SO if she doesn't want me to talk that way to other girls, than don't respond that way to men."

And yes, I know some girls have a issue with confrontation, but that is why am there for.

So obviously it's easy for men to not cheat or flirt, they have to go out of their way to do it (in general).   that is not always the case, especially when you have a hot parner, in a club enviroment you become a challenge and in your average club the ratio hot men to hot women is massively skewed   I've always had trouble with it,     a lot of guy do, we are discouraged to express emotional boundaries(like /u/Trueartiscan did) by accesations of insecurity. most men don't get it, you are a equal partner in the relationsip and your wishes matter just as much as hers. if she can't respect them, the same rule aplies as if you are not respecting her, it's a unhealty relationship and you should break up.   but what I do now is tell my SO if she doesn't want me to talk that way to other girls, than don't respond that way to men.   That only works if you are both flirts. That would work for me, because I love it. But a much better rule is mutual respect for the status of ""not being single"". Very few girls don't understand how to be in the : ""not in the mood"" mindset or in just dancing mode.

I never even disagreed with you.   Just being precise. The only difference between being playfull and flirty is the sexual tension which is offered up easily by guys.  I did not say you are wrong. I just think it's a passive way to define boundaries. She is not a child to use parables to teach her morality, you can and should have a open exchange. But you are basically letting her draw the line based on what would make her gealous, instead of telling her what your line is and asking her to respect it.  If it works for you, great. But my way opens up a comunication about boundaries not based on ones own estimations but based on the other's estimations. This enables a wide variety of adaptations of ones own behavior in relation to the other: from before bad habits to vacation plans. It creates a paradigm of understanding your partner and adapting to his/her wishes."
AskMen,3e1n6b,loadedtomcat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:50 2015 UTC,"instead of telling her what your line is and asking her to respect it.   Because girls are complacent in the interaction.  Thats why I brought up about how men do the brunt of the work in a pick up scenario.  She is standing there and just talking to a guy.  She has plausible deniability.  Even if you lay out what you want, she makes excuses such as 'he was just being nice' 'how was I supposed to know he was flirting'.  I need to lay it out in a way that she understands, me flirting with a girl the way that guy was with her makes it extremely clear.  The best rule in a relationship is the golden rule.  It's difficult to apply that when situations between genders vary a great deal in this."

His resume was fairly sparse, with very few job references listed. His degree was in mechanical engineering from some Polytechnical school. The job references were from Defense Contractors and, oddly enough, DARPA.   For those of you who don't know, DARPA stands for Defense Advance Research Projects Agency, and does a multitude of interesting R&D for the US Government. They hold yearly contests in fields like Robotics and the like.   During the interview, A had decided to begin asking those generic questions that people always ask in these things. The last question he asked was ""What about working at this place appeals to you?""

AskMen,3dze0o,maidmaz,37,Tue Jul 21 18:32:00 2015 UTC,"I had a bit of a weird epiphany when I was asked one of these cliche questions last year.  It was the beginning of August. Back in June, I was part of a group layoff at work. It was completely unexpected, but in my line of work it's a pretty normal thing to happen. The thought is that you get laid off, and then bounce back quickly at a competing place (and usually you get paid more).  I had only two months worth of savings left, because I was an idiot and didn't even fathom the concept of a safety net, and this meant that if you combine me theoretically getting hired and getting my first pay check, I could only sustain myself for about two more weeks.   I was interviewing like a mad man. I am normally pretty good at them, but the bigger problem that was happening was that in my career, I was in a weird limbo where the jobs I was applying for either paid less than they should for my experience, but I wasn't good enough to get the more senior positions. At the time, I didn't know how bad it was going to get, so I ignore all the offers that paid lower than my previous job.   Aiming for both job levels also meant that I was interviewing for double the normal amount of places, and at this point, I was burned out. It was 3PM, and this was my fourth interview of the day. I didn't have lunch (and was actually hoping a place might comp one so that I could save on expenses that day) and was bouncing around the hot city on the train in my interview suit.   So, the place I interviewed at was a reputable place. Definitely one of the top five places that I could end up working at in my field. The position wasn't a great one, and at this point I was only doing this interview more as a formality.   The questions were the typical ones; ones that I have basically memorized in my head since I've answered all of them at least a hundred times in the last month.   But then, came the cliche interview question:  Where do you see yourself in five years?  Now. I know what I'm supposed to answer to this. Bullshit like, Oh, I forsee myself working for this company, but hopefully at a more senior role. Maybe prepping myself to be a manager or a lead creative   But, I think just a fuse in my head burned out, and I didn't say what I said every other time. All I told them was  Happy.  The interviewer was confused. I mean, it's her job to interview people. So she threw me a bone. Happy? I'm sorry, could you clarify? Do you mean happy in the company? Happy working on [X] client?  I gathered my composure, realized what I said, and instead of trying to save face, told her what I was really feeling.  No. I do mean happy. I don't know what that means, or how I'll get there, but that's the only thing I've ever wanted. And... I don't think I'll get that if I'm here.  And I just left. Didn't explain myself (she sent me a courtesy email afterwards to her boss saying that there was some miscommunication and I could set up a follow up interview), I still had 30 minutes left to prove myself, but I just got up and left the building back to my apartment.  Now a year later, I'm happy that I had that mini breakdown. It gave me some real perspective on what type of life I wanted to live and that in order for me to be happy, I had to work harder and start aiming for my dream places to work, instead of whichever place would hire me so I could pay for my rent next month. I'm currently working my dream job and loving my life."
AskMen,3dze0o,Spockrocket,4,Mon Jul 20 22:13:05 2015 UTC,That's a great story.
AskMen,3dze0o,theirisnetwork,3,Tue Jul 21 02:54:25 2015 UTC,So... what happened in those following two weeks before you ran out of money?
AskMen,3dze0o,Spockrocket,58,Tue Jul 21 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"That was a Monday. After I went home and took a nap, I went and spent the next 48 hours pulling all nighters revising my portfolio.  When I had little breaks, I went and preemptively started applying for new places. This time, instead of places I'd consider ""safe"" (ones that I could easily secure), I went off the hinges and applied for my dream places. Companies that I've always wanted to work for since high school; places that before I never thought I could get into. Before I was applying for places like your local design studio. Now I was aiming for places like Google and Apple.   This obviously meant a lot of no's. In fact, Samsung went and sent me back a personalized denial email, asking me why I thought I was qualified for the position I was applying for.   But I kept going at it, and by Wednesday I secured a second interview with a place I'd be happy with. The only problem was that it was only a freelance position. Which is still nice, but I was hoping that I'd be able to have insurance.   The recruiter knew that I was in interview mode, so she was trying to expedite my process. They set up a final interview on Thursday for me. While this was happening though, my #1 choice got back to me.  It was a Hail Mary pass. This #1 place wasn't only my top choice, it's the top company that anyone wants to work for. Like, I knew my goals were high, but I absolutely did not expect them to even give me the time of day, let alone talk to me.  They told me that I'd start the interview process on Thursday with them, just after my final interview at the second place.   Normally, these things are a long, lumbering process. A phone call interview, followed by another one, followed by an in-person interview, maybe another one of those. It takes people a month, or maybe a year even.   My first interview with my #1 company lasted five minutes. They guy told me that they loved my work, and immediately wanted to do the second interview. That happened Friday morning. They loved me then, and then flew me out to San Francisco for my in person interview. I received my offer letter on the follow Wednesday, and one really awesome thing that happens with this job is that moving expenses included them sending me a month's worth of my salary for miscellaneous expenses, which alleviated a lot of my anxiety.   So something that should've taken upwards of a year I did in four days. It was crazy, and I was wondering how the hell is even happened.  Turns out, that outside of them seeing potential in me and liking my work already (when made the vetting process more streamlined) the head recruiter used to work alongside the recruiter at company #2 and they had a bit of rivalry. So the minute he knew that she was the other person trying to hire me, he expedited the process to have me interviewed and presented an offer before the other person even knew."

AskMen,3e0ihw,Scarecowy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"Married, never. Kids, no.   I honestly hate to say it but marriage is a bad deal for guys. It didn't used to be that way, but now the way divorce laws are written it is way too easy for your wife to leave due to ""irreconcilable differences"" take child support (if applicable) and alimony. The statistics for a first time marriage is 20% divorce rate (80% filed by women) and the statistics only get worse from there. The only way I'd consider it is with a prenup and a vasectomy, and it's seen as kind of a slap in the face to suggest a prenup. I simply can't see any good reason for a man to get married."
AskMen,3e0ihw,Byizo,0,Tue Jul 21 01:21:00 2015 UTC,I simply can't see any good reason for a man to get married.   Because they want to spend the rest of their life with the person they love and want a big party to celebrate it?
AskMen,3e0ihw,nickachu_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"Why can't I have lots of parties with someone I love without getting married? I can have a relationship with someone without getting married, I can love someone without getting married, and the financial risk is practically nil. As I stated you have a 1 in 5 chance of divorce even if it is the first time you and your spouse have been married. That is just too high for me. If they decide to stay we can have a great life together. If they decide to leave, I can get over them and move on without having to deal with a lengthy, costly divorce. Marriage is a big risk (and getting bigger) with no reward."

AskMen,3e0ihw,nickachu_,4,Tue Jul 21 01:33:57 2015 UTC,"American. It isn't as bad in most other countries as far as I understand. I believe it is worse in the UK. I understand how you feel about it. You want to find someone who will love you for your whole life and marry them. Maybe you will find that. You have a decent enough chance at it, but there is no way to tell at the outset whether or not things will go south at some point. Everyone who gets married knows it is going to last forever. They know they will be together until they die, except that a good percentage of them don't. For me it's just that the risk is too great, and relationships do not get any better simply because you get married."
AskMen,3e0ihw,Byizo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"De-facto relationships have a higher 'failure' rate than marriages and a long term de-facto relationship ending will still see lawyers involved and a division of assets and finances. In Australia this can only be worked around with a binding financial agreement made during the relationship, so pretty much a pre-nup. I'm not sure living de-facto (at least in Aus) minimises many of the risks."

However I did know a couple who had both their children in their early 40's, and both children turned out autistic on spastically incapable proportions.

Realistically, I'd like to be done with pregnancies by 35, marriage could be anytime after that including never.  My boyfriend's ideal was to be done with kids by 35, married before that, but he's realized like me it's not happening. He wants to be done with kids before 40 now; marriage I don't think he cares about the when but he doesn't imagine never.  We've got a 4 years difference so that works out well."

Obviously I'm biased as an F1 fan, but I think everyone who's seen it agree it's very very good, even (especially?) non-F1 fans. It helps that Ayrton is extremely charismatic, and that his rivalry with Alain Prost will go down as one of the most bitter in sporting history.  If you Google ""Senna full movie"", you may or may not find the movie on YouTube. If you've never heard of Ayrton I'd highly recommend watching it without researching him."

The Science of Sex Appeal - watch for free on the Discovery Channel website.  Description:   The elusive qualities of sex appeal are examined through the lens of science in this probing documentary, which reveals the evolution and function of every component of human attraction. In this study of the science behind ""chemistry,"" you'll learn how the subtlest sounds, sights and smells can affect sex appeal, and how genetic, hormonal and neurological factors create sparks between people.    Planet B-Boy - A personal rant of mine is that breakdancing movies are usually awful, besides the dance sequences.  As a fan of the form, this was the breakdancing film I've wanted for a long time.  Follows a bunch of b-boy teams around the world as they try to make it to a global competition.  Has a sports-movie storyline, just applied to breakdancing.   This American Life 220: Testosterone - Radio not film, but an eye-opening look at hormones, manhood and gender.  Description:   Stories of people getting more testosterone and coming to regret it. And of people losing it and coming to appreciate life without it. The pros and cons of the hormone of desire.    Sick Around the World - you can watch it for free on the PBS Frontline website.  Health care and public transportation are two of my pet issues, and this is one of the best treatments I've seen on the former topic.  Description:   In Sick Around the World, FRONTLINE teams up with veteran Washington Post foreign correspondent T.R. Reid to find out how five other capitalist democracies -- the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Taiwan and Switzerland -- deliver health care, and what the United States might learn from their successes and their failures.    This American Life 461: Take the Money and Run for Office - For an insight on the backroom dealings in politics.  Description:   For anyone who has ever heard the term ""Washington insider"" and felt outside — we are with you. So this week, we go inside the rooms where the deals get made, to the actual moment that the checks change hands — and we ask the people writing and receiving the checks what, exactly, is the money buying?     Brits Get Rich in China - Follows three English businessman as they try to make their fortune in the world's hottest economy: China. It felt more like a financial horror movie. The whole movie, I was convinced these guys were going to lose all their money.  Also captures the pitfalls of doing business in a foreign country where you don't know the culture.   Born Rich and The One Percent - Both documentaries are by Jamie Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson conglomerate.  The first film is uneven but a sincere effort.  The second is much more developed and professional.  What makes these stand out is how Jamie is a part of that circle, and enjoyed unprecedented access to wealthy people that most documentary filmmakers would not."

Personally though, I wouldn't listen to anything anyone says about it, just watch it for yourself and decide. Best watched alongside Hitler: The Untold Story. I'm sure you've all been taught the history lessons and 'know' everything there is to know about World War 2, but maybe you'll come out of this with a bit more knowledge.   Hellstorm and Hitler: A Film From Germany are also great films. I implore you to read into the Dresden Massacre and also take a look at some books such as: Mein Kampf, Germany Reborn, This Time The World, An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945 and First Into Nagasaki: The Censored Eyewitness Dispatches on Post-Atomic Japan and Its Prisoners of War."

No.    Is this unnecessary drama from a fwb that would ruin your vacation and you'd rather not know?    Yes it would ruin my vacation.    How would you feel if you found out afterward that your FWB had an abortion? What if the email had been sitting in your inbox before the abortion?    Highly annoyed, then pissed at myself for not using a condom and bad for putting her through this situation. It would be a wake-up call to stop fucking around on my end and to take better precautions. If the email was in my inbox before the abortion, I would wish she had a safe to time.    How do I fulfill my duty to tell him without creating a whole bunch of emotional drama?   Since you will inform him, it will create emotional drama. Just tell him after he comes back unless you want an emotional monkey on his back and he's helpless to assist you since he's backpacking in a another country."
AskMen,3e14sf,KittyHammer,3,Tue Jul 21 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"You've been ""together"" 2 months as FWBs... I vote don't tell him at all. Or tell him when he gets back. But he doesn't really get a say, in my opinion. What would you do if he found out right now and demanded you have the baby?"
AskMen,3e14sf,_ism_,2,Tue Jul 21 14:18:34 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I don't see anything positive about him knowing. OP may feel the need to tell him, just to get it off her chest, but that's really about her benefit."
AskMen,3e14sf,rightsidedown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult situation, so first off let me just say I hope you get through this ok.  As for informing, I would tell him, but this is something you would generally want to talk about face to face before doing anything.   Whether or not to mail him is tricky, since he can't do anything to help you. Personally I think that I would want to be informed asap (so through mail) but I would understand if you waited until I was back to tell me.  My biggest concern would probably be if you are ok, since the choice for having an abortion is already made. I'd want to know how it happened, no need to go into all the technical details. and yes, if possible have him call you, might be better.  I know I probably didn't help too much, you are the one who has to make the decision on how to do this. I think that getting the news will be hard on him regardless of when and how, so it is perhaps best if you email him what has happened, and discuss all the details when he gets back.  Again good luck with this all and I hope you have someone to support you during this"
AskMen,3e14sf,Borania,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:19:32 2015 UTC,"If you tell him, tell him when he gets back.  The fact that you got an abortion is going to head off any suspicion of deliberate contraceptive sabotage, so I don't think you really need to worry too much about going into technical details beyond mentioning that the IUD failed.   How much detail would you want to know?   How she's doing, whether she's going to be/is recovering from surgery.  How she feels about me, whether and how much I should reach out to her or give her space.   What would be your biggest concerns?   How does she feel about me?  Are we through?  Are we enemies now?  Do I leave her alone until she's ready to talk or do I make an effort to be there for her inasmuch as I can?   How would you feel if you found out afterward that your FWB had an abortion?   Terrible, because an unwanted pregnancy is hugely stressful and it's not exactly cheap to get an abortion.  Also, the process itself isn't exactly pleasant.   What if the email had been sitting in your inbox before the abortion?   Probably worse.  But eventually part of me would probably be glad I didn't find it so I didn't have it dragging me down while I was backpacking across Europe or whatever.      How do I fulfill my duty to tell him without creating a whole bunch of emotional drama? This has been the most stressful part of the whole situation for me    Let it go.  Focus on what's necessary and right for you and worry about getting in touch with him properly for after you're out of the woods.  If trying to contact him is too stressful right now, then take the time pressure off of yourself to contact him properly and ASAP."
AskMen,3e14sf,Coidzor,0,Tue Jul 21 10:21:29 2015 UTC,"FWB   Just have the abortion. Tell him, not tell him. Upto you, and it makes little to no difference."
AskMen,3e14sf,twwwy,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty unusual situation with him being completely out of contact like that.  If you are afraid of ruining his vacation and creating drama ect you could Email him now that you need to meet up when he gets back in town to talk about something.  Ideally phrase it so it doesn't sound like the ""we need to talk"" breakup conversation.  Also you should convey that things are alright, don't want him thinking you have a cancer diagnosis or something.  You seem like you guys have talked and are both not ready for kids.  Already having that talk and knowing what you know you already are confident he will be supportive.  It sounds like except for the inability to contact him and tell him beforehand you're in a pretty ideal situation as far as accidental pregnancies go.  If you're giving the whole story this sounds like a really cut and dry no drama situation.  IF YOU DO TELL HIM you are pregnant in an email of some sort, YOU MUST TELL HIM you are getting the abortion.  God forbid he gets an email telling him you are pregnant and he can't contact you back and is left wondering if you will keep the child.  Men can be just as scared of having kids as women.  If he doesn't know what is happening he gets to panic about what is going to happen (for 3 solid weeks), and possibly spend time coming to terms with having a child.  If he comes to terms and switches into ""I'm going to be a dad"" mode, coming home to find out it has been terminated would be absolutely devastating.  TLDR: Don't tell him you're pregnant without mentioning the abortion.  You can wait till he gets back and have a face to face for best results."

Multiple full knee reconstructions from congenital birth defects, club foot correction (which means I don't really have an ankle), one foot is a size 7 and the other is an 11. I walk pretty normally. I used to be really conscious about how different my body is and chose to wear pants most of the time.  These days, I rock the 7"" shorts (I'm a guy, so that's about 3/4 down the length of my femur). I love when people ask about it. I bike 100 miles a week, swim a mile every day, and play in an ultimate league on Sundays. Do my legs hurt sometimes? Yeah. Am I built to be a marathon runner? Nope. Have I EVER let my legs or defects change the lifestyle that I live? Not one bit.   I volunteer with kids who are in similar situations to me at that age. It's hard for a 7 year old to understand why he needs to learn to walk again, for the third time. It's hard for a kid to understand why she has to spend months learning what comes naturally to her peers. But every week I get to look them in the eye and tell them they can do anything they want with enough time and hard work.   I wouldn't change my legs for anything."

I totally respect guys (or people) like you who had to put in the work to change their mindsets and overcome the shitty hand life sometimes deals.  Sounds like you're killing it. I highly suggest making swimming a part of your workouts, considering your leg problems. It helps a lot with the one sidedness that lifting creates when you favor one side from previous injury.

AskMen,3dz6ft,gotthelowdown,5,Mon Jul 20 23:09:53 2015 UTC,"Getting people to like me.  It runs in my family. Generally speaking, we're very charismatic, funny, engaging people who typically end up being the center of attention.  Which is a great quality, but the big issue with this is that as my parents and family got older, this started turning into a black and white affair; either they assumed that everyone loved them, or even at the slightest bit of resistant or negativity they'd consider themselves failures and get really sad and take stuff really personal.  This didn't help that I first started off as being a dork, and didn't quite get the charismatic part down just yet. So basically, that meant that I turned into a neckbeard who yelled too much, craved attention (be it positive or negative) and was ""weird"" for the sake of being weird. Obviously, this led to me being bullied at a young age and not making worthwhile friendships.  But, when I went to high school, stuff started shifting slightly. I made some good, lasting friends and started letting my guard down. I was still a loud character, but I started learning timing and societal norms as to when it was okay and not okay to do it.   I then matured more once I got into college, and started learning in general to be happier and more confident in myself, which made it so that I didn't need anyone's outside validation to make myself feel better. It was at this point that I realized that for me, the real path to being happy and satisfied in my life was making sure to improve myself in areas I felt I needed (dressing better, learning to talk to girls, my studies), while at the same time coming to terms with the fact that certain qualities of me wouldn't change, and instead of treating this as a negative (me being loud, making inappropriate jokes, not being terribly professional), rolling with it and owning it.   Oddly enough, me not caring about people liking me actually made it so that even more people liked me. It wasn't necessarily the whole ""apathetic rebel"" but more that because I truly didn't care what people thought of me, it made me appear to be more confident and I was more welcoming and engaging to everyone.   Fast forward to me now at 25, and I've ended up being really satisfied and happy with myself. I am proud to say that since college, I have still remained a loud, abrasive dork who curses way more than you normally should, but I've learned to use it to my advantage and also know when it's appropriate to mellow down and be more chill."

I was too shy to go let them know myself.  This went on into my teens even. I never asked a girl out. I never was the one to become friends with others, they'd become friends with me in a sense.  I was just shy.  This then went on into my adult life. If I needed to get something done, I tried to find a way to get it done without having to come into contact with anyone.

When I did, it soon came to my realization that she was only interested in me as a friend. As a guy with virtually no self esteem back then, It hit me like a real good kick in the nuts and I just couldn't see why she turned me down. I started overthinking every move I made and every word I said and I just couldn't get to terms with her rejecting me. I never bothered her with it, but it really bothered me and kept me busy for quite a while. It also messed with my self esteem and my view on having romantic contact with girls. After about a year and a half of only talking myself down, not having the nerves to talk to women and turning them down on the odd occasion that I did manage to talk with them, I met a girl with whom I instantly hit it off and she became my girlfriend pretty soon. And just like that, all those problems disappeared. Now I'm not with her anymore, but that was a real gamechanger for me so I'm really grateful for that."

AskMen,3e2x4q,CardinalsFanatic,4,Tue Jul 21 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"Not a guy, but I dated a guy who LOVED them. He was the first guy that really gave any feedback at all about my blowjobs, and I was with him for awhile. I thought that teeth made them good because of that. (Note that by teeth, I mean very lightly dragging them up the shaft, never once did I bite or anything like that.)  He appears to be the exception. Nobody since has liked it AT. ALL. Found that out the hard way on the first guy after. Whoops."
AskMen,3e2x4q,rubberduck05,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it's more about a light grazing.  Not trying to dig in.  I've told girls I like it but they ever seem to believe me since all the other guys they've been with have beaten it into their heads that guys don't like that.
AskMen,3e2x4q,_ism_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"I've known a guy or two who liked the tooth-dragging. Which is good, because I can't avoid tooth contact perfectly the whole time every time! I guess I have a small mouth or something."
AskMen,3e2x4q,viceywicey,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"What?  You realize the purpose of teeth right?  You're putting your penis in a place designed to grind down big pieces of food, often times meat, into smaller pieces of food...  If she sneezes while her lips are wrapped around your member..."
AskMen,3e2x4q,Mr_Lovette,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"You know OP, I don't fear the glancing of teeth. Ex did it a few times and it never worried me. It actually felt kinda nice. It was a change from the softness.  I get you OP. Light touch of tooth isn't that bad. Even enjoyed if done right. The worry most people have is the jaw is extremely powerful and teeth don't have much feeling as far as how much pressure they are applying to a fleshy object. So the concern is there that she will actually bite and cause pain. Just needs to be trust and communication really."
AskMen,3e2x4q,empress-of-blandings,4,Tue Jul 21 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"OP, do you happen to be a bit bigger? I think some guys are of a certain size, where frequent teeth contact is inevitable, so as a sort of response to that they just kinda learn to accept or even enjoy it. That's my theory anyway!"
AskMen,3e2x4q,GltyUntlPrvnInncnt,3,Tue Jul 21 15:38:23 2015 UTC,I think you might be onto something here. Sounds very plausible.
AskMen,3e2x4q,Angerandhate,4,Tue Jul 21 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"Or the one blowing him makes him want to feel like hes bigger. ""OP your dick is so big scrape scrape scrape"" meanwhile she can fit a cueball in her mouth"
AskMen,3e2x4q,GltyUntlPrvnInncnt,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:37 2015 UTC,Well yeah that's also a possibility lol
AskMen,3e2x4q,VincentGrayson,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Nope, I can't say I see much appeal there. I have in the past wished for more ""aggressive"" blowjobs, but teeth needn't be a part of that."
AskMen,3e2x4q,umlaute,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:46 2015 UTC,"There has to be some misunderstanding here. Can't figure out what it is though.     By teeth you mean the hard, sharp and pointy things in the mouth, right? And by penis you mean the sensitive thing between your legs that gets hard? And toothy means her teeth make regular contact with your dick?"

AskMen,3dy7us,Funkfreed99,10,Mon Jul 20 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"I picked up the Wheel of Time series at an auction for ten bucks. Trying to gnaw through the first book.   I've mostly been reading guides and illustrated manuals lately. I guess my favorite this year is the Total Outdoorsman Manual published by Field & Stream. Fills a lot of little knowledge gaps I had, and has some recipes I'd like to try."
AskMen,3dy7us,MightyGamera,4,Mon Jul 20 14:46:07 2015 UTC,Upvote for the Wheel of Time. Greatest fantasy series I never finished. Was on the next to last book when I got my new job and became busy. Gotta get back to it :/
AskMen,3dy7us,pretty_sunflower,4,Mon Jul 20 14:55:59 2015 UTC,Just about to say this. It's pretty fast but you have to put it in perspective. It's fourteen books. It might get slow at times. But the first seven are pretty quick imo
AskMen,3dy7us,RampagingKoala,3,Mon Jul 20 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"And then 8,9,10 are slow. And then things pick up again with KoD. And it's a snowball from there."
AskMen,3dy7us,Konstiin,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"Once you get past the first 100 pages, it starts to really pick up.  The ending is amazing.  If it hasn't already annoyed you, you better just accept that there will be a lot of braid tugging and folding of arms under her breasts angrily from Nynaeve throughout the series."
AskMen,3dy7us,cawkstrangla,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the story is good though the character actions are driving me nuts already. I was raised on Tolkien so I don't mind three pages to describe a room or a leaf. I don't need a conversation being so hard to follow because everyone talking is constantly fidgeting."
AskMen,3dy7us,MightyGamera,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, the 'stage directions' are a little excessive in that manner. It does pick up the pace though. Easily my favourite fantasy series."
AskMen,3dy7us,Konstiin,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, Nyaeve's entire role in the first few books is to declare that men are morons and then commit an act of pure, weapons grade retardation."
AskMen,3dy7us,gg86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:13 2015 UTC,Total outdoorsman manual sounds cool. Good read for a total noob?
AskMen,3dy7us,Rookworst_zonder_r,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, it's a light bathroom/coffee table book. You won't learn anything groundbreaking but it's fun and introduces the reader to the basics of a lot of things. How to tie essential knots, sharpen a knife, use a canoe for shelter, etc.  By the end you'll likely be buying 550 cord and a good knife which are things I think every man should have on hand anyway.  I just chose it as my favorite because I learned practical knots from it that I always half-knew but this got me to get them down pat."
AskMen,3dy7us,MightyGamera,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"Very coincidentally I've recently been looking at going wild camping/hiking. Already have my eye on a reasonably cheap all-round knife ($80, but I'm lucky to find it for €80). Also been looking to buy some paracord, and things like tent/backpack etc.  Thanks for the tip! :)"
AskMen,3dy7us,Rookworst_zonder_r,6,Mon Jul 20 16:43:07 2015 UTC,You don't need to spend 80 on a good knife. I recently replaced my old wood-handled blade with this and I have to say I'm surprised by the quality for the price. Something like this plus a Leatherman and you're pretty much set for 90% of the little problems the world throws at you.  The only issue is carrying it. I'm close to just getting a leg sheath for under my pants but I don't want to be that guy with a leg sheath.  EDIT: The rule of thumb with anything EDC is stopping to ask yourself if you will cry if you lose it. The trick is to balance quality with replaceability.
AskMen,3dy7us,MightyGamera,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"Mhaha, yeah depending on what kind of knife I'll get (yours looks very hunt oriented? Maybe that doesn't matter) I'm thinking of webbing it through my Molle pack (for (wild)camping that is). Thanks for the tips man, I'll definitely be picking it up!"

AskMen,3dy7us,WodensBeard,4,Mon Jul 20 15:43:16 2015 UTC,Did you start from Colour of Magic? I've found the trouble to entry with Pratchett's books is simply how many of them he wrote over his lifetime. I finished the Nome trilogy back around march because I had a sudden burst of old memories concerning how I had the stop motion mini series of Truckers on VHS as a child. Yet starting on Discworld feels like a huge investment in time.
AskMen,3dy7us,i_heart_blondes,2,Mon Jul 20 16:28:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm going in publication order. A coworker started using that chart that says how the world connected. We can discuss the books until we're finished with them since they jump around so much.
AskMen,3dy7us,WodensBeard,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:27 2015 UTC,They're aren't in chronological order? That makes me mad.
AskMen,3dy7us,i_heart_blondes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"It's more like they jump around in publication order. There are series within the books and if you go in publication order you may read the first two books with a certain character, then the next couple with be about completely different people. Honestly I don't mind but I see why some people would.   The books are actually great and well worth the reads. Each book is just the right size for zipping through in a week."

It's a rich whimsical world of magic with hilarious characters and situations. Peek at spoilers, the beauty in the books is how they are written. You can get spoiled on something and still enjoy all the moments leading up to it.   It fast became one of my favorite book series. Mort and Equal Rites are two of my all time favorite books."

Currently I am working my way through A Song of Ice and Fire (halfway through Clash of Kings). Prior to that I had read The Martian (because the movie trailer looks incredible). Prior to that I read Childhood's End because I heard the ScyFy channel was making a miniseries of it.  I've probably read 2-3 books per month this year, but I think the book I've enjoyed the most has been The Disaster Artist - which is all about the making of The Room, the best worst movie you'll ever see. Absolutely fascinating read."

AskMen,3dy7us,RedStag00,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:16 2015 UTC,"I commute via train about 45 min each way, so I have a guaranteed reading timeslot of an hour and a half per weekday. Plus if I get particularly interested in a book I will end up reading some more in the evening. Also, I read everything off of my kindle or the kindle app on my phone, so while other people might enjoy ""wasting time"" with apps and games on their phone, I'm knocking out another chapter or two during any down time."

It's a little layman-level so I skip over some sections that just verbatim repeat what I've heard 100 times in lectures, but the connection between basic natural selection processes and disease theory that the authors weave is fascinating.   I am also thinking of taking out Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance from the library soon.

AskMen,3dy7us,Canadairy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"The establishment:  and how they get away with it - by Owen Jones.  I liked his earlier book called Chav: the demonisation of the working classes, so I thought I'd give this a go.  It's still in the early parts of it so haven't read enough to judge yet.  Up next after that I will read Naomi Klein's 'this changes everything: capitalism vs the climate' and Mary Roach's 'Bonk: the curious coupling of science and sex' because Mary Roach books are quite funny and informative.  Packing for mars and Stiff I can recommend.  The best thing I have read this years was Liu Cixin's ""the three body problem"".  A scifi book from China which jumped to a place on my all time favourite books.  There are planned sequels which excites me.  I also read The devil in the marshalsea by Antonia Hogson, which is a murder mystery set in a 19th century debtor's prison in London.  That was pretty cool and though you can figure it out quite early, it's still fun.  Oh and Lies my teacher told me by James Loewen which can't recommend highly enough.  I do not recommend Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven.  I thought the Ringworld dude could do no wrong but this was fucking awful, even accounting for it's time.  Took me too long to give up.  I thought a comet smashing into earth would make a great book but nah... not always"
AskMen,3dy7us,Lost_Afropick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"One of my problems with Owen and specifically his other Guardian articles is that he relates 'chav' to being an insult for the working class, when, actually coming from a poor working class background, chav is a word we used to describe the violent and dysfunctional meatheads we were plagued with.  Basically he seems to think chav means prole, we always meant it as the non-leftie equivalent of lumpenproletariat.   Part of my issue wth Graun leftism is that it refuses to acknowledge the existence of a class of people that don't want to work, will never work and that make life worse for all around them."

AskMen,3dy7us,nicebelt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"Currently working my way through ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" again. I read all the books in Dutch first, but now I'm reading through it a second time in English. That way you get a bit more of the authors feel. So far I think the Dutch translation is superb though. Some characters are a bit funnier in English (and some less in other aspects). It's quite interesting reading through everything again knowing what's going to happen. Some plots, visions and lore (Aldo read the small prequal books of ""Duncan and Egg"", quite a fun read) are a of more logical or interesting now. Can't wait for book 6 to come out.  I would name some other great books I've recently read, or have laying at home waiting to be read, but this thread is about current book (halfway book 4)  Edit - oh it's not actually about current book :D So... I read "" Animal Farm"" by George Orwell. It's only about 100 pages but it's a fun story nonetheless. Especially interesting once you find out what it's actually about (my book had explanations at the end etc).  I also read 1984 by George Orwell and man I haven't read anything as mind boggling as that in a long time. Considering when it was written, and it's so relevant today. Every now and then I see something on the news or hear something and it completely reminds me of the book. Must read IMO.  An other book I completed fell in love with without expecting it was ""Butcher's Crossing"" by John Edward Williams (also wrote ""Stoner"" which I liked, but not as much as this one). It's basically a wild west story about a guy who wants to go I to nature and be a man. I could really relate to him and the story, very educational as well in some parts.  At home I have a couple of books left to finish; Perfume (apparently Kurt Cobain's favourite book), Red Rising Star (Tom Clancy), and some others which I can't think of right now... Reading is fun! :DD  'nother edit; Also read ""Catcher in the Rye"". Quite a funny book, it made me laugh on several occasions. It got a little bit repetitive sometimes though, but I liked it non the less (just noticed I've been getting more in to the classics lately I guess)  Also read American Sniper (before I knew the film was coming). It was okay, a bit too religious & god bless 'murica for my European feels. He was straight and not bullshitting though, that's what I liked. Some very interesting aspects get told in the book. Prefer it very much to the film  One bullet away, the making of a marine officer. If you've ever watched the HBO series "" Generation Kill"", it's about Lt. Nate Fick. Very cool and interesting (and go watch Generation Kill if you haven't)"

Yes, because soul mates don't exist. Chemistry is created by what you do and how you act and react towards one another.  Hard talk: if girls don't like you that is not their fault. Some people really aren't that interesting, pleasent or atractive. Become a interesting dude, be polite, well manered and kind and work out to become someone she wants to see naked.   This is becoming even more the case with each passing year   you can't stare at life and wonder when will you get your turn. The same thing aplies in your career, finance or general happiness.

First off, I'd say walking down the street I have at least the base level of physical attraction to more women I see than those I just find straight up unattractive for whatever reason. So since I could at least begin to see myself getting into something based on initial looks alone with over half the women I see, I like those odds. In addition, enough positive reinforcement from women has lead me to believe I can be pretty desirable to at least a decent subset of women out there. Take those two together and I am fairly confident in being able to attract women I too find attractive and that I will continue to do so."

I coped with it by just trying to meet more girls, I never gave up on meeting new people. Sure, I had failed, and my self esteem had been hurt, but I knew if I gave up it'd only get worse. I'd hate to see what would've happened had I just quit altogether.  If a girl has a lot of guys competing for her attention, backing off is a good thing.

AskMen,3dw00s,Once_a_Fool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:22:49 2015 UTC,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ISRCO6A  I love these. I've tried the exofficio boxer briefs mentioned below but I think these are a little bit more roomier in the crotch area and stretchier in the thigh area. Also cheaper.  There's also a version that is shorter.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ISRCEY2
AskMen,3dw00s,whyyougottabesomean,26,Mon Jul 20 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel as well. I broke up with my last girlfriend in part because I knew she couldn't keep up with me at the gym (which is okay, we're doing separate things generally), but then knowing she didn't want to ski or snowboard, and that when summer came around she wouldn't be able to hike or bike at a pace that would be fun for me. I don't mind slowing down, or waiting at every mile on a bike ride but it would've required me to basically walk."
AskMen,3dw00s,Underoath2981,32,Mon Jul 20 08:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yep. My ex ran a lot, biked, rock climbed. For like the first few weeks. Then she stopped going rock climbing, didn't want to ride fast and didn't want to keep progress of her running. Turns out she lied about her marathon time too.  Moral of the story is, the girl acted a certain way to impress me but after a few weeks couldn't hold up, or rather didn't want to. I love being outside and if you don't or want to be a better athlete, then that's fine I just don't want to be with you."
AskMen,3dw00s,tuxedoburrito,13,Mon Jul 20 08:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah aah... My ex was really heavy, and I had just lost a bit of weight (went from over weight to bottom of normal weight). I figured I'd see if it was true where you could find anyone attractive for the personality. It wasn't, and I wasn't at a point where I wanted a relationship in general I realised."
AskMen,3dw00s,Underoath2981,28,Mon Jul 20 08:14:43 2015 UTC,"I would argue that you did find her unattractive BECAUSE of her personality.  Who you are on the inside is reflected by who you are on the outside. How you treat others and yourself. With the exception of medical disabilities or thyroid problems, being overweight has to do with discipline. Lack of discipline is unattractive. Lack of self respect and self worth is unattractive. Lack of someone who cares about their fitness, health, quality of life, attractiveness to their opposing gender and how they will affect themselves and those around them in elder age is unattractive. Those are all personality aspects and not even looking at the physical appearance of it.   I don't find physically overweight women attractive. Personality or physical body. And it isn't shallow. It's an opposing personality and worldview than what I hold dear to my heart."
AskMen,3dw00s,tuxedoburrito,6,Mon Jul 20 08:23:03 2015 UTC,I think you're very right. Dating her is what assured me I suppose.

AskMen,3dw00s,mashonem,16,Mon Jul 20 00:50:42 2015 UTC,"seconding what the other guy said. Weightlifting beats ""being active"" or ""working out"" (read: running) any day. It's actually quite fun, and I hate exercise."
AskMen,3dw00s,lasagnaman,11,Mon Jul 20 08:53:02 2015 UTC,"See I'm quite the opposite.  I find running 10 miles to be far more enjoyable than the mindless repetition of weight lifting.  I just cannot stay focused trying to lift, and then I've lost track of however many reps I am doing."
AskMen,3dw00s,Dementat_Deus,7,Mon Jul 20 11:58:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I lift more than I run because it aligns with my goals, but I enjoy running so much more.  I actually find running a lot more ""mindless"" and that's what I like about it.  You just start and you go, and you keep going.    Weightlifting has too much start and stop with rest periods and moving through 5+ exercises.  Too much frustration working with heavy loads and missed reps if your diet and sleep aren't perfectly dialed in.  If I start with squats or bench and for whatever reason they aren't going well, it's discouraging and tarnishes the rest of my workout.  It sucks when you aren't making progress on lifts or you have to deload.  It sucks when you kill yourself and still struggle to get gains.  And don't get me started on injuries.  Fuck if I haven't done something minorly wrong which forces me to work around an injury for the next month or two.  I like lifting well enough to do it on the regular (and basically structure my life around it...), but running certainly has a lot more appeal to me due to it's relative simplicity.  Progression is also a lot simpler and easier.  You ran this far/long yesterday, run a little further/longer today.  I also love the runner's high when you finish.  Lifting feels good too when you're done, but there's something unique about the exhaustion and feeling of accomplishment after a long run."
AskMen,3dw00s,bicameral_mind,3,Mon Jul 20 15:28:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, lifting weights is more repetitive than running? You lose track when you count to 10 compared to running 10 miles?  Not having a go at you, I'm just really surprised. I'm assuming you mean running outdoors because on a treadmill I'd fall asleep."
AskMen,3dw00s,ScepticalProphet,13,Tue Jul 21 03:06:44 2015 UTC,Weightlifting = 'working out' in my eyes. Running = 'being active'.  They both suck equally as far as I'm concerned

Honestly you should try like strong life 5x5 for a few weeks and see if you like it. It starts out pretty simple and do-able and you build up with a base. I love lifting but I never started until a few years ago. Builds confidence, characters, improves posture and you look better. Give it a shot for a few weeks and then make an assessment!"
AskMen,3dw00s,tuxedoburrito,17,Mon Jul 20 08:14:25 2015 UTC,"I have a love-hate relationship with lifting. I like the systematic approach. I like keeping logs to chart my progress, but actually lifting is so goddamn boring."
AskMen,3dw00s,kingcal,8,Mon Jul 20 11:21:48 2015 UTC,"Need someone to lift with. It's much more motivating. I had someone to lift with, and now I don't, and it is boring work now.

AskMen,3dw00s,Radcliffes_Asshole,6,Mon Jul 20 13:42:35 2015 UTC,No one really cares how little you lift. Chances are people are too busy worrying about themselves and their work out to be worrying about how little you lift. Just grab a buddy and lift with them. If they are actually a good friend they'll be there to make you better and not judge how little you lift.
AskMen,3dw00s,Blue-Purple,3,Mon Jul 20 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"Nah other people don't bother me, everyone starts somewhere. I just don't like lifting with w friend because switching all of the weights on and off is a pain."
AskMen,3dw00s,Radcliffes_Asshole,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"Nobody cares how much you can lift! I'd rather see someone lifting a small weight with good form than cheating on a lift to get a higher weight up. I can't lift all that much, but I stick with it.   Get a lady lifting partner. THAT is motivational and I feel like He-Man next to her."
AskMen,3dw00s,nate800,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:56 2015 UTC,"Nah I don't care about other people, everyone starts somewhere. It's just hard to lift with someone doing significantly more than you because you have to constantly switch the weights around."
AskMen,3dw00s,Radcliffes_Asshole,15,Mon Jul 20 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"Is it really that impossible to believe that someone is able to do something that is good for them without actually liking it? What else would ""working out"" entail? Nothing personal (this shit is about to get really ranty btw), but it gets pretty old when presumptuous people assume that you simply don't like being active because you haven't found the right activity, and it happens almost every time this type of post gets any traction.   ""Oh, you don't like being active? Have you tried hiking? Have you tried something outside of the gym? Have you tried lifting? Have you tried working out with a partner? I'm sure if you try WXYZ, you'll fall in love with being active too!"" I do/have done all of that shit already; I accept that none of it is enjoyable to me but I still do it because it's beneficial (and the alternative is even worse than a few  hours of discomfort a week).  Not trying to rant at you in particular, but this shit isn't new to me and I'm sick of people trying to make me love being active. If I could have the body I currently have by sitting at home and eating like shit all day, I wouldn't work out at all; but I can't, so I do."
AskMen,3dw00s,mashonem,4,Mon Jul 20 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"I totally relate! I live in a really outdoorsy city and am, simply, not into hiking or other 'outdoorsy' activities. I go to the gym, dance, lift a bit, and run (on my treadmill. in my garage. alone) because I like the way I look and feel when I do. I genuinely love to dance, but otherwise, fitness, for me, it's not fun. It's necessary. I'm a lazy fuck, and, like you, I'd sit around all weekend rather than get my ass to the gym to workout."

Second my fitness (working out and nutrition) is one of my passion in life, and it has ramification on most of the things I do, from dinning out (healthier foods, less alcohol), to entertainment that is more active, more outdoor and I don't mind if it involves walking.  Therefore dating a fit woman who also is careful about what she eats, quality of food and alcohol, and is keen on hikes/walks/runs is a lot easier than dating someone who is clueless about macros, drinks to excess just because, and is addicted to driving/taxis instead of enjoying the physicality of walking/running/hiking/biking/"

I do have a tendency to spin a little faster than she would, so occasionally she'll ask me to ""bop it up to the next gear'."
AskMen,3dw00s,reg-o-matic,6,Mon Jul 20 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"All I ask is that my SO has to be reasonably healthy, with the fitness that comes with that. She doesn't have to train as much as I do, but she has to be able to do stuff with me that involves physical exercise, and care about her body in a way that motivates her into physical exercise (Preferably not just to look nice).  It's not even just that I'm not attracted to fat people, it's just that I'm not attracted to people who aren't healthy and active, which just happens to include fat people, but also super thin people. If you could be fat and active at the same time I'm not sure I would have a problem with it."
AskMen,3dw00s,GrapeMousse,10,Mon Jul 20 09:08:45 2015 UTC,"It's important. I don't need someone super fit, but I generally do not find overweight people attractive -- not just from an aesthetic perspective. It's also a lifestyle thing. I want to be with someone who is not only going to be able to participate in a lot of activities, but who is also going to push me to stay fit. Barring real medical problems, people get fat and stay fat because they live sedentary lives and eat poorly. That puts me off more than the how they look.  I also worry about the baggage that comes with being overweight. I was overweight once. It was a part of my life when I had NONE of my shit together. I was insecure, lazy, and incapable of taking responsibility for the conditions of my life. When those things started to change, I started losing weight. It often seems to me that overweight people are train-wrecks in more ways than just physically. I'm 26 now and I don't really want to spend years of my life trying to help someone get over all her bullshit only to have her bail on me once she has some self-confidence (again)."
AskMen,3dw00s,thevoiceofzeke,8,Mon Jul 20 04:23:56 2015 UTC,"Weightlifter here. and yes, i want her to be fit. The why is a little ortodox maybe. I'm pretty childish and i like to behave childish with the person i love (good thing i proposed to one!). I like to wrestle, tossle around and stuff, this also goes when its down to sexy-times. Im 82kg with a 3 lift total of about 480kg. (high intermediate if you go by competative standards). My SO has even told me shes lucky shes strong as well cause i can be quite forceful in the bed, had it been an un-physically fit person i would most likely hurt them, which would break my heart.  Shes a weightlifter as well, but wants to tweak her program to add more cardio. But still keep on lifting the weights, sure shes not ""beach body super ripped model""-mode, but honestly i dont care about the whole 'ripped part' as long as she has the same hobby as i do and can keep up with me when it comes to the stuff we do (outside and inside the bedroom)  Could never in my wildest dreams imagine being with someone who didn't view their bodies like i view mine..

She was depressed but wouldn't do anything about it.  She couldn't spend much time with me and my siblings.  I know their sex life suffered for it.....

AskMen,3dw00s,tuxedoburrito,4,Mon Jul 20 08:09:13 2015 UTC,"Fit enough. It's hard to describe for me, but basically, if your health prevents you from running, walking up stairs easily, shopping at most major clothing stores, etc., you're not fit enough for me. I don't mind some extra chub (and in some cases it's actually preferred), but too much is too much. Just don't be fat please, it's not asking much."
AskMen,3dw00s,yourpants,4,Mon Jul 20 11:17:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not attracted to fat people as a general rule. Moderately thick is fine but beyond that just doesn't do it for me.  Thing is, a skinny woman with absolutely no interest in keeping fit is also a turn-off. She doesn't have to be a marathon runner or a world-class powerlifter, but it'd be nice if she liked coming to the gym with me. There's more...rhythm to it, if you will; I enjoy the whole routine of lifting, eating, showering, etc., and if she's more of a cardio person or calisthenics or what have you, it's still all great."

When I'm out with a girl, I've had more people get jealous than I can count, and the rest are accepting and supportive. They see two happy people having fun. They see a girl practically worshipping a happy confident guy. They see a guy and a girl that can't hardly wait to bang when they get home. People want to hang out with us because people want to hang out with happy confident people. As long as your girl supports your fitness goals, don't worry about it."

AskMen,3dw00s,itsmii,3,Mon Jul 20 02:48:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty active guy: I like backpacking, jiu jitsu, golf, weight lifting, etc. but I think it's more important to me that she have an interest in something fitness-y and the persistence to keep at it (Not the type to go to the gym for two weeks and quit). This is mainly so that we have some sort of common interest than it is my demands on her level of fitness.  This is within reason, of course. If she's so out of shape that she can't hike a few miles or play a round of golf without a cart that's too out of shape."

AskMen,3dw00s,madwilliamflint,3,Mon Jul 20 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"For me it's pretty important. Not because of the physical attraction (although that plays a role) but more so because when I'm not working my free time includes camping, canoeing, biking and swimming. So if she's into Netflix marathons on a regular basis then things probably won't work out."
AskMen,3dw00s,firesidefire,3,Mon Jul 20 11:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. Until roughly last winter, I was a lazy fuck who never went outside. Then I started running. Now I hike almost every weekend and run 3-5 miles a day. In addition, I also lift 4-5 days a week. I don't need my SO to be extremely athletic, but I want them to be at least somewhat active and into physical activity. A person's activity level is very telling."
AskMen,3dw00s,Life_of_Uncertainty,3,Mon Jul 20 12:45:36 2015 UTC,"I workout a lot, I have for about 6 years (25 now). I'm pretty much within range to do a physique comp at any time within 8-12 weeks prep. With that said, I find girls at that level extremely hot, but I in no way expect my gf of almost 4 years to do that.    Not to mention, she's like the complete opposite when it comes to exerting herself, it really strains the relationship since we don't so very much else. We don't party or drink all that often, and are in a new city. To her point, she did have a spinal fusion surgery in her preteen years that bothers her a bit. However she literally does not like physical work in any way, won't do cardio or even go to the gym, can't keep any kind of pace on a basic trail hike, doesn't keep up with PT, says her diet is ""good"" but she loves sweets and indulging. We are very much opposites on diet, discipline, and motivation when it comes to a healthy lifestyle but have many other compatible things. I've sort of learned the hard way that she doesn't respond well to any kind of friendly suggestions in that arena, so not quite sure it will ever change or how important it is to me.    She's not fat, but I do wish she tried a little harder. I have found that as my physique has peaked, I find her less attractive (hot?) but that may be a kind of natural thing with relationships that go on for some years.    Still trying to figure it all out, and I'm working to make the relationship work.  But I should note that while I'm answering OP's question honestly, it's not necessarily a deal breaker, but a nuance depending of a relationship. It's definitely affected sex life a little bit, but rather than being rash I am just looking to see how important it is to me, and if there's anything positive I can do to change it to some degree."

AskMen,3dw00s,aeteau,3,Mon Jul 20 15:35:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not a body builder or anything, but I do keep active and work out in some form at least 6 days a week and do trail/road races and I lift 2-4x/week depending on the season and keep a close eye on how much I eat, so by many peoples' standards I'm fit/athletic.  For me, I am just interested that my SO be able to join me in my kinetic lifestyle within a reasonably similar level. She doesn't need to come with me on my runs or to the gym (I see those as mostly individual activities anyway), but if I'm hiking, boating, going on a longer walk, or just being outside and active, I want someone to share those activities with. Luckily this is how things are currently with my wife, who is pretty close to my level of fitness, and if anything looks as, if not even more, fit than I am even if I have more strength/endurance (then again, those biological dimorphisms will do that to you).   As for ""fit"" aesthetics, I actually prefer a curvier, even chubbier look on average, but I am into a wide range of looks/sizes, and kind find someone who looks thin and fit very sexy as well. I guess you can say my absolute, if I had to pick just one look, as my favorite it would be the stereotypical ""softball girl"" look (strong, in shape, but also a little thicker overall). I'd say these days my wife has more of a ""runner's"" physique, which she rocks quite well, and is largely the result of her being active and fit herself."

But I view it just like any other lifestyle activities/hobbies, if she isn't as into fitness as me then it isn't something I'm going to force her to be into.   That being said, I'm naturally concerned about her well being so I would like to see her partake at least once or twice a week. If her weight/health started becoming an issue then I would have her workout with me sometimes."

If we are both into fitness the other person can serve as motivation in both eating healthy and keeping up with workout routines.  It is also easier to eat healthy when both people eat healthy.  I wouldn't put a lot of weight in this when looking for a relationship though.  As long as they are attractive to me and their fitness level is not limiting the activities we do i could care less.

AskMen,3dw00s,thesingingnerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:45:01 2015 UTC,When you start taking care of yourself and making responsible food choices you subconsciously judge over people who make poor choices because informing yourself is all you have been done extensively for the past few days/weeks. When you go to a restaurant and your friends order a soda and it's your turn to order you think a soda is too sugary therefor it's not good to order for myself. It's similiar when you have worked to improve your body image and make healthy food choices and then see someone with a weight problem. You just see how many effort you put into it and how little they do in comparism (making assumptions).  I don't believe that fit people often expect their SO to be as fit as them but to be relatively healthy or average. Atleast not extremely unappealing as it is with obesity (for most people). But it should also do if she isn't that fit but still rather slim. It's more about being healthy since that's what's naturally attractive.
AskMen,3dw00s,AdolfHitlerAMA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"I find my wife and I try to match each other in fitness. It's not a ""catch up to me"" but more of a ""damn, I better not get left behind"". When I was dating, I definitely wouldn't be attracted to women who weren't at least as fit as me. It spoke more to their lifestyle, which for me is a huge turn off if it looks like you just laze around and do nothing. Probably a staple of being a Colorado native. I'm a big gamer and love staying in with friends, but if it looks like you don't even go walking on a daily basis, I'm really not interested."

It doesn't stop the sweating, but it does wick away the moisture, making it easier to dry. Get yourself some baby power or Anti Monkey Butt Powder.

Two the extra dopamine and other assorted chemicals you get from it will help you be a little happier and more confident. Also find something to focus on outside of dating like your career, school, or a hobby. Just do something that makes you feel proud of yourself. Now that you've stopped beating yourself up start putting yourself in social situations you feel slightly uncomfortable(they don't have to be related to girls/dating) that you would like to be able to comfortably experience. Treat it like workout routine set weekly goals/ task don't beat yourself up if you feel uncomfortable but don't stop. Most psychologist will tell you the best way to get over a fear is exposure therapy like this. You will feel awkward there will be times when you wonder why the hell did I do that.

Social interaction with non friends would either be at concerts or public events. For the most part, I just do my hobbies and do my best to be carefree.  Sometimes it works. Most times I am still angry/depressed at myself, or at people in general."
AskMen,3dw7am,YOitzODELLE,46,Mon Jul 20 01:31:28 2015 UTC,"Previously had medium low self confidence (largely high school, early college).   I'm 25 now and would say my confidence is bordering on arrogant.  It all comes down to one realization that came to me very slowly over the intervening years.  ""If it doesn't work, stop doing it.""  It's often said that girls don't like low confidence, girls don't like mopey and sad, girls don't like moody.  So what did I do? I forced myself to appear like I'm a confident, happy, well-adjusted person.  It works much better at getting women's attention, and as a bonus, you'll actually start feeling more confident, happy, and well-adjusted. There are studies that prove this, but I'm too lazy to look for sources.  Now, this isn't the whole enchilada. The last bit, arguably the most important bit is to realize that most girls aren't interested in you, and that's not a bad thing.  Do you like burgers? zucchini? escargot? If you don't, does that mean it's a bad food? Does that mean it's worthless and that no one will ever enjoy eating it?  Of course not! It's the same with women, a lot will say no, so you say 'It was a pleasure meeting you, hope you have a good rest of the evening' and go along your way.  If all else fails, approach girls, asking for their number, whatever else, as practice. Strike up conversation with as many girls as possible, not to get their number or have sex, but just as practice for having easy free-flowing conversation with girls."

Strike up conversation with as many girls as possible, not to get their number or have sex, but just as practice for having easy free-flowing conversation with girls.   It's also a game of statistics. While you gain practice (and thus, confidence!) and learn what works for you and what not, you also use your chances. If the chance to get a girl's number is 10% (1) you have to talk to 10 girls on average to succeed once. If you ask 10 girls every month, you approxmately get one new contact per month. After a year that's 12 - but you will raise your chances, since you are now very well-practised, since you chatted up more than 100 girls and your % may rise to 30% (1) or whatever.   (1) these numbers are freshly pulled from my ass, not a real statistic, but if you are unpracticed I'd think it's a realistic one. I never ever ""got a girl's number"". I never wanted to. I want to make out or have sex - maybe get the number after that."

AskMen,3dw7am,karmapolice27,10,Mon Jul 20 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"There are a few stages I went through. In high school, I was pretty meek and introverted. Eventually I started getting some balls, then lost them after my first relationship ended. I started becoming a douchebag. It's pretty cringey the things I did and said when I think back on it, but I got laid a few times and was generally content.   After a while, I found a sense of humor and started taking myself and the people around me less seriously. Soon that devolved into not taking ANYTHING seriously and no one wants to be in a relationship with someone like that.  Slowly I transitioned into what I am now which is, ""an asshole, but you make up for it doing nice things."" (Quote from one of my female friends.) Find a balance. Go through the processes and stages just so you know what you DON'T want to be. I'm still learning things and that's a beautiful thing. Verbally, I'm a bit of a dick. By action, I'm a nice guy."
AskMen,3dw7am,mudra311,20,Mon Jul 20 02:23:13 2015 UTC,"I went through the same shit, man.  One thing, was that I found a goal more important than women. Something I wanted to do that if all women collectively decided they didn't want to touch me, but I accomplished these goals, I'd still say I lived well even if I lived weird. Having a direction independent of women is important for women to see.  I tried to figure out what my issues were. I was bullied daily as well. It built some complexes within me, but one of the things I thought was that I just wasn't quite good enough to land a girlfriend. So I set about making myself good enough. Good in my field, good to my friends, good to strangers without cause to be nasty, useful in pinch, quick to praise, and as slow to anger as I can stand, fierce defender of loved ones. I tried to eliminate all those big-time red flag dealbreakers.  I made sure to set my career up so that I could take care of myself, have a few extras, with some buffer. It didn't come easy, and there were tons of moments where I wondered if I could hack it. Not only that, during the process, people would speak of really respecting or even being impressed with my drive, but still be perfectly able to walk away. I thought ambition was super attractive. Go figure.  I then tried to figure out what it is I was doing wrong with women. Objectively, I am a better overall human being than some of these guys I knew of that were in relationships with women I'd love to be with. So what did they do right? I started dropping all assumptions of what I knew about women and trying the shit people told me to do. It became less about getting a girlfriend, and more about practice. Practice so that when my gal came along, I wasn't a total fucking mess. To cut a long story short, most of it was bullshit circle-jerk self-aggrandizing platitudes that simply sound good to people who can't articulate anything concrete about how this dating thing works with a gun to their heads, but when I found what I was missing (social cues, social skills, self-presentation, risk-taking, date-planning) I set about fixing that too.  Somewhere along the way where I was trying to get myself right, women started being more interested in me. I still can't tell when and who and why, but I do know that I can just try to take them out and if things get squirrelly I can walk away.  Nowadays, my issue is actually meeting too many women who seem at first like they'd be a good option. The trouble now is, which ones do I pursue knowing I'll have to leave the others alone?  For reference, I'm 32. My fortunes didn't really change in a big way until I was 26. I didn't hear the words, ""you're sexy"" until I was 24. The feedback on your looks and body isn't going to be there in verbal form consistently. Like most men, the proof of the pussy is in the eating."

Instead of focusing on meeting women, just focus on meeting ""people"" and be a genuinely friendly person to everyone that you come in contact with. This includes checkers at stores (also works for getting discounts if you ask, btw), retail people and just anyone. Make people feel special and relevant. It's amazing how fast you'll see results in how people treat you. Go to a bar by yourself? Engage with anyone, you will be amazed at how many interesting people that you'll meet along the way and of all different flavors. I talk to people now and they can't believe it when I tell them that I used to be very shy. It just takes practice. Soon you'll feel your confidence increase and that energy can be felt by others.   I'm 48 now and am getting way more attention that I ever did. In addition, taking care of yourself physically will do wonders for your self confidence as well. Good Luck"

I was really good friends with this girl for about 6 months, finally had the courage to ask her out. At first she said no because she didn't want to ruin our friendship, but one of our mutual friends talked her into giving me a shot. That relationship lasted 6 whole years and we experienced our first everything together. After we broke up though, I felt like I was back at square one.

Feel good about how you're looking. See your reflection in harsh lighting and how you have massive shadows accenting your pudge ""You're a fat fuck no one will find you attractive."" Read something funny on your phone during lunch, quietly giggle a bit but force yourself to stop because that chick way back when told you to stop smiling because you have a dumb looking smile and it bothered them so even if you can pass that off as someone being an asshole, it sticks with you because they just vocalized it, who else might silently think it? How would anyone be happy with you when your smile even repulses people. Close the tab because your enjoyment of the thread is ruined. Constantly correct how you walk because you might be leaning slightly off kilter and one of those people over there might think you're super weird 'cause you can't walk normally, even though the adjustment was from normal to awkward but still normal.  It's not constant, but it's a lot of little niggling things that creep up every now and then. I can't even work up the courage to ask anyone out because I've been either laughed at, or rejected fundamentally because they were apparently taken or are actually lesbians. The lesbian thing would have been easier if they weren't dating some random guy a month later. Could have at least told me the truth...  I like to pretend I don't want a relationship at all anymore, and most days I even believe it. But I don't. I live with family, but in the future when I eventually move out, I see a lot of lonely shitty dinners alone before I go to sleep alone so I can wake up alone the next day and drive to work alone while being unable to use the commuter lane because I'm alone. Then add 30-40 years later and I'll get to die in a hospital with maybe my brother and whatever family he musters to visit me beforehand. But that will be beyond me. Relationships, love, sex, children, family. Those are things that happen to other people. I can watch others experience this from the outside, like one would a TV show, but it's not something that is realistic for me. At least I have a near zero libido now, this shit would be insufferable if I were sexually frustrated on top of all that.  Yeah, I've already tried therapy.

Saying ""hi, my name is whatever the fuck, I'm new in town"" can get you far. A friend or a lover for the night, you never know and learned I shouldn't care about which you get, just be grateful you got one.   Became a dad at 25 then ended up a single dad at 27.

So honestly, I didn't/couldn't deal with it. I was too shy to make any kind of move. I got lucky that one girl pursued me and wanted to be with me when I was 24.

Add to that depression, social anxiety and ADHD.   3 years ago I realised, I deserve to be happy (so does everyone else). So I started making happiness my priority. I started making sure I slept well, ate well, and exercised (super important in helping with confidence). Then, I started focusing on what makes me happy, I started to read self-help books geared towards making me better in the areas that I wish to be better at, and turned my hobby and interest (drugs and psychology/neuroscience) into my purpose (I am studying to be a psychiatrist, to research psychedelics and do psychedelic therapy, specifically geared towards anxiety and depression). So now I have happiness as a priority (requires a lot of reminding and persistence, as it is easy to get sucker punched by depression), I have a ""purpose"" that involves things I'm interested in, and I'm constantly improving along with searching/finding hobbies, interests, etc that I enjoy.   When you make your happiness a priority, when you make YOU a priority you realise that is what everyone else is doing. Everyone is living their own lives and that's really cool when you think about it. The most important thing to remember is that you're you, and there is no one else out there exactly like you. Some people won't like you, some people will and some won't really give a fuck. Also, when you're happy, you have this energy which is felt by others, especially women, in my opinion. It's a win if you ask me. If you're happy, that happiness spreads to others which in turn rubs off on you!  I'm a lot better with women than I was, because I don't care as much if things go south. If things don't work out it's simply incompatibility, and there are an abundant number of women out there I am compatible with. At the end of the day I want a women who makes me happy, makes me laugh, and is fun to be around. If her personality doesn't fit mine then, it's simply a ""waste"" of my time and hers.

The momentum of confidence comes with price of you (well at least for me personally) being so drunk that none wants to hang around and chat with you in that condition. Best way to get confidence would be just by listing few things that are wrong in your life and trying to fix them. And exercise. Getting muscles can really help along the way but dont let it go in your head too much. And it shouldnt only be about the size of the muscles but interval or core muscle training.

To this day, I can not look in the mirror without a heavy feeling of self disgust and hatred.  However, this is nowadays. Before, it affected me heavily in my social life. I did not go out much, had little friends and had no luck with the ladies. So to change all that, I put myself in the deep end and travelled by myself for four months in South America.  I was alone, independent and a new person. I could be anyone I want to be. More importantly, I had an opportunity to try and learn to talk. Learn to understand body language.   Fast forward, I'm doing better with the ladies. Had a few relationships, one night stands and made friends; I even attempted to ask a few out!

My peak confidence (and luck with women) was when I was going to the gym regularly, which I'm trying to do now again. Being in a  situation that is your comfort zone also helps, such as 1-on-1, small outings, or a full blown party.  Certainly fake it till you make it until you believe it yourself. If you have friends (and also since have slept with women previously), there are qualities you possess that others enjoy. Place yourself in situations that you are better than many of the people around you, or embrace the uncertainly in a place where no one knows what they are doing.

It will require your own self discovery for it to happen.  First things first -  SEX MUST, AND I MEAN HAS TO BE, THE VERY LAST THING ON YOUR MIND. If you're going out looking for numbers, dates, or sex, it becomes pretty apparent pretty quickly and more often than not is a turn off. Go out and begin to enjoy good conversation and leave it at that. Over time you'll begin to see when and if someone's interested, and if you are as well then go for it. You don't want someone to feel like a product for your consumption as part of a first impression.   I got married very young to my third girlfriend ever, and was never the most popular kid in school. The confidence didn't develop until around 25, after I was in the swings of divorce.   For me it was completely external; I had what I thought to be a rather attractive girl approach me and basically ask me out. I was dumbfounded. Over time I started noticing this more and more with individuals and it began to boost my self esteem for the first time in my life to a level it had never been.   I adopted a sort of 'fuck it'  mentality and began to act as if rejection didn't even cross my mind. Over time my finesse in public conversation grew, and my confidence continued to grow with it. Before too long it went (in my mind)  a little too far and I found myself acting more cocky than confident and began to keep myself in check.   As for luck with the ladies, I'm not really interested in being on the market right now, but I can say with a fair amount of certainty that if you're respectful, confident, and not terrible looking then you won't have any problem with just about any girl. They're not 'notches on the belt'  for me, but I can say I've gone way out of my league (at least in my mind) and even ended up somehow holding on to an absolute bombshell for 2 years or so. Things get better. Fake it till you make it!"
AskMen,3dw7am,nappydj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:16:08 2015 UTC,"You don't deal with it, you just keep trying until it gets better. Approaching women is something that takes practice, and while you do need to take that step to give it a try, it's not the same as truly getting over any social problems.   You get over it when you've been successful with an approach and you have that validation, not the other way around.  It's the same with a situation like lacking social skills in general. You can't get therapy and ""get over it"" and then be fine. It's an ongoing process.  You're over it when you realise that you're not struggling anymore."

I had no interesting or unique things about me, and I didn't like that about myself either. I used to only play video games and occasionally work out... So how can you expect someone to find you interesting if you don't think that about yourself?  solution  Started climbing, brazilian jiu-jitsu, lifted weights, got my own apartment, started getting interested in interior decorating and art, started drawing and I started writing my own journal just so I can find worth in the days that go by. Oh, and I cook every one of my meals.  What I earned wasn't just that women found me interesting... I got confidence from wrestling with grown men trying to strangle me from BJJ, I got muscular and lean from climbing and lifting weights, I got secure in myself from having my own apartment, and I got sensitive and loving from being interested in art, drawing and thankful for my days from writing my journal. And I can cook the shit out of a stew, and fed girls are happy girls.  So be the kind of person that people, not just women find interesting."

Intimate Connections - a cognitive behavioral therapy approach to  loneliness and learning to meet/connect with people.  First it teaches you how to be happy on your own and then it helps you learn to connect with people.  I credit most of my luck with women to this book."

AskMen,3dw7am,FaceofStamos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"This seems to come up in one form or another once a week. Stop trying. Let me explain because no one seems to understand what that means.  What does that mean? Self confidence comes from being good at something - but you are trying to be good at women - which is a recipe for disaster. You'll either fail at it and take a hit to your self confidence - or you'll succeed, become a sleazeball pickup artist and ... well? There's a reason I qualified that with 'sleazeball.' So when people say 'stop trying' - they mean stop trying to get laid, or get female attention, or whatever polite term you'd like to use. No judgement here, just stop looking at your love life as a challenge to overcome.  So what do you do instead? Get a hobby that you can succeed at and feel good about, and get good at it. Preferably something that gets you out of the house and talking to people. Join a gym class and see it through to the bitter end, take up basketball, get involved in your local D&D scene, take writing classes, start organizing poker games... whatever you want as long as you feel like you've accomplished something.   So what happens next? Will you be known as the D&D god and women will throw themselves at your feet? Obviously not. What will happen is, if you do it right, you will feel good about yourself. When you feel good about yourself, you will start attracting people who want to be around you. And when people want to be around you, eventually you will realize that some of them are interested in having closer relationships with you. Relationships will happen naturally and life will be good.  So stop trying to make attractive women want to hang out and start trying to be the kind of person everyone wants to hang out with.   And yes, although this wasnt planned on my part, this is exactly how I overcame my extremely similiar problems."

Work on improving yourself mentally and physically.  Think of it like a graph with two lines. One line starts at the top and works its way down over time. This is the amount of fucks you give about being rejected decreasing. The other line is personal improvement as it goes up over time. Eventually you'll get to the point where the lines cross and your self improvement will be above your amount of fucks of being rejected. Women will mistake this for confidence and paired with your newly acquired social skills and improved looks you be amazed at how many women see you as a catch.  I didn't really hit that point until right after my 21st birthday and in the <2 years since then I've relationships short and not so short with about 30 women.   You also have to stop putting the pussy on a pedestal. You can't act like finding a woman will suddenly fix all your problems and fulfill all your desires. YOU have to do that. The mopey-dopey attitude you have right now will keep you from happiness. You have to get the mindset of ""I don't need a woman to make myself be happy.""

AskMen,3dw7am,soitcause,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:39:50 2015 UTC,"Fake your confidence through body language and you will naturally feel more confident! Learn to accept your flaws and love yourself.  Now for a story: in elementary I was super introverted and was bullied constantly. When I hit middleschool I had literally no social skills. I used to do sports, so I was pretty fit so I looked decent as far as the girls said (I'm 19 and my mom still chooses my clothes for me).  I used to walk funny, as in slightly hunched, shoulders before my chest and always looking to the ground. I haven't had a single friend until that point.  After two years I started getting comfortable to break out of my shell but I still didn't initiate conversations, ever. It helped I was good at math and physics, since it supplied a small amount of interactions at least...  At high school one day my friend told me that I ""walk so fucking weird"". He told me to straighten my back, and pull my shoulders back (essentially puffing my chest).  It took me a year and a half of constantly paying attention to my body language, but I assure you it worked. People started complimenting me on my looks, said I was more confident, were more cooperative when I needed help and listened closer when I explained things. I once even surprised myself when I stood up for another classmate of mine when a teacher did something wrong.  I used to freak out when the pizza man/lady answered the phone or when a kid approached me on the street to ask for the time!  I still have terrible stage freight but it's WIP :)  Ladies? I'm into guys so I dunno :p. I pretend not to notice any advances and neutralize sexual tension with being stupidly silly.  SUCH A LONG FUCKING POST.  Edit: I forgot to mention: get your priorities straight: getting a girlfriend or just casual sex is fine and dandy but you should focus on bettering yourself and your life, people dig people who self improve :)  TL;DR: Play hard to get. Don't try to impress anyone it your own, and ""the one"" will make sure you know about them :) (most of the time it's their body language around you)."

The truth is that equality is a two way street where you gotta give some to get some.   You don't get equality by talking about how unfair life is to you. You get it by taking responsibility for your own actions and leading by example. If you can't even treat others equal yourself, how can you possible expect others to treat you equal?  If you, as a woman, still think and expect men to do most of the job during dating as well as pay for the date? Do you expect men to approach you and won't do it yourself? You have no right to claim that you want equality and no right to expect anyone to treat you as an equal.  If you, as a man, are not disgusted by women being harrassed and catcalled in the streets, then nope, still not equality.  If a woman thinks that it's not ok for a man to hit a woman, even if she instigated? Not equality.   If you automatically expect a female IT technician to be less competent in computers or technology than a male counterpart? Once again: Not equality.  If a certain female CEO displays incompetence and you blame it on her being a woman? Not equality.  If you defend said female CEO solely because she is a woman? Not equality.  If you can watch a man get mutilated and maimed on a TV show and don't care, but get offended when you see the same happen to a woman? Not equality.  If you think it's worse for a woman to sleep around than a man? Not equality.  If you take male rape less seriously than female (Or vice versa): Not equality.  If you think it's wrong to profile your gender in a negative way, while simultaneously profiling the other one negatively: Not equality.    Equality means that you will get screwed over in pretty much 50% of the current gender issues. If you are not prepared to get screwed over and put up with the losing some of your privilege, then you have no right demanding equality for anyone else because you're not even willing to treat others in an equal manner to begin with."

However, I think there exist inherent differences in gender that are hard to rectify via equality.  A big (the biggest IMO) is that men crave sex at a much higher rate than women do, generally speaking, so the average man has a much higher sex drive than the average woman.  For this reason, dudes are going to generally go out of their way to please women in order to gain favor with them.

AskMen,3e0p80,benruns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"Talk to someone. Find a psychiatrist, therapist. Just someone non partial, who doesn't know you and go through things with them. Your upbringing, your anger, thought processes.   Obviously a lot of your anger is directed towards your mother, and I suspect there is some towards your father too. There seems to be a lot of damage done to you while growing up to your expectations of self and your role not only as a man but as a person. I'm really sorry for everything you've been through there's not much any of us armchair shrinks can help you with so my best advice is see someone to help you work through your anger and to ultimately get over it because it's what will hold you back in all areas of your life."

You don't have to commit, you can actually hate it and enjoy how much something sucked. Go see some live music, try weird food, tip a busker and let yourself be entertained for a few minutes, see a burlesque show, rent a cabin by the lake for a long weekend, go sailing, buy a piece of real art by a local artist (prints don't count), give yourself a new nickname every day, wear some wild n wacky socks, eat kid's cereal for dinner, spout out as many curse words as you can in 3 minutes, and of course, find yourself a good therapist because your past is heavy and it's clear that you are ready to let go of that baggage.

In retrospect though, every single time I felt like that I was already in the process of changing without even realising it. You are probably too, it's just that it takes time and happens so slowly you don't notice. It took me years to become less boring and inhibited as a person.  For me, alcohol help a lot though. Wasn't partying like crazy or anything, but it helped me not be so introverted and reserved.

I've never been one to add much salt to my food, occasional beer, but generally good healthy food. Just had a vasectomy two weeks ago, prior to that eating with a 1000-1500 calorie deficit while exercising a lot.  Normally treadmill 5 days a week, either uphill walk or 5K run. I'm overweight, but not obese, working on losing another 20 lbs over the next six months.  I keep rigorous logging with FitBit regarding food, exercise, heart rate, etc. Duration of Medication? - I've been on the medication since last Thursday evening.  I also bought a blood pressure monitor to take daily readings. Side Effects? - I was told the ACE inhibitor I'm on has a low chance of swelling my legs, or a dry cough.  I've not experienced either of those issues, or any other perceptible side effects that were listed. Feel Different? - I feel less tense, like something that HAD been preventing my back/neck/shoulders from relaxing has been removed.  My blood pressure has dropped down to pre-hypertension now (138/88 last average of three readings)."

AskMen,3dwjkx,magicjelly12,104,Mon Jul 20 03:09:11 2015 UTC,"Till we both decide to have sex. If we do it then we do it. The amount of dates doesn't matter. If the girl isn't comfortable with it then I'll just keep my pants on. It really isn't that hard to wait and I'd rather her be 100% into it than feel like she got pressured into it. Shockingly, sex isn't the top priority in all aspects of relationships."
AskMen,3dwjkx,Colonel_Saunders,13,Mon Jul 20 04:07:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. Waiting for sex bothered me a lot less than I thought it would. In my opinion, if you are emotionally invested enough in the girl it shouldn't feel like a burden."
AskMen,3dwjkx,daddycool32,-5,Mon Jul 20 09:39:42 2015 UTC,"This is ^ if you happen to meet a gentleman, which sorry is not of the norm.   I don't know if asking this question will help what answer you're looking for.   It really depends on the intention of the guy - I can easily have sex the first time we meet, but does would he want to bang or see me again? Doubt it. UNLESS YOU'RE LUCKY or living outside of North America.   You can even wait until the third time you see him, but he can still disappear on you or surprisingly say, ""I'm not looking for a relationship"".   Or you act like the cool cat, not say anything at all, then when you ask - it's like you're the ""CRAZY"" one asking where this situation is going?  I assure you, I'm not trying to drown you in my insecurity, it's just has been like this in my experience until I started dating for 5 years - while we were seeing each other, I had to actually ask him, ""Shall we go back to being friends or is there something here?""  Why am I deemed psychotic if I'm asking what the situation is between us and why is it such a big deal to communicate?  Fuck, I hate this nonsense of dating and don't even get me started on Tinder. No one should be going on there expecting relationships - I do know a few people who have met their s/o and im really happy but surprised at the same time.   Oh ""the cliche"" is that you're suppose to wait 6 months to sleep with someone if you like them, I would rather not wait that long to find out he sucks in bed. TYVM."
AskMen,3dwjkx,craw,16,Mon Jul 20 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"If I really like her and she's not super shy about sex I'd probably give it till the 3rd to 5th  date before attempting, that's assuming she hasn't tried to yet if she's game for the first why not? I can typically be pretty patient"

I didn't say people date(-d) non-exclusively, exclusively. It's that that is the norm, and very common on the scene.  And the point of saying that is to show the contrast between what's actually going-on and someone saying 'I want a r'ship and an infinite length of dating before moving on to sex'.   Sure; MANY people date exclusively; and I bet many of them don't have sex before marriage even. But, if you're discussing the young-people actually dating crowd of today: those concepts aren't as popular today, as they were before."

Maybe you won't be compatible with some people -- but so what?  Some people have boned on the first date, others waited a few weeks. In my adult life, I don't think I've had any relationship go more than a month or two without both of us wanting to hop into bed."
AskMen,3dwjkx,Delehal,3,Mon Jul 20 03:17:40 2015 UTC,"In my adult life   I think this is key. At least in my experience, it seems that age is a big factor in how long people wait. When I was young and relatively new to sex, I needed a lot more time to feel comfortable.  I'm curious how old some of these posters are (particularly the ones who put that they'll wait a really long time)."

Not everyone is as sexually confident as me and everyone always has their own hang ups, so if it takes them a while to feel comfortable having sex I wouldn't ever have a problem waitting. It makes for a great topic too, it's interesting to ask questions and listen to girl's talk about their sexual hang ups."

AskMen,3dwjkx,Djeter998,4,Mon Jul 20 14:27:38 2015 UTC,It's a great filter to ring people through. You wanna see a guy's true colors? Just deny him sex and watch how he behaves.
AskMen,3dwjkx,JerfFoo,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"This is true. Every single guy I ever dated was VERY cautious about that stuff. My last ex was like, ""are you SURE it's okay now?"" because he didn't want me to do anything I was uncomfortable with."
AskMen,3dwjkx,Djeter998,2,Mon Jul 20 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"That's pretty extreme, but you do have to watch for some people who will consent to something but actually be really uncomfortable with it. If you're into some heavy/kinky/BDSM-stuff, it's worth it to check in on how someone else is doing if you're doing something new. After your familiar with each other or if you're just doing fairly vanilla stuff, reading body language is usually enough."
AskMen,3dwjkx,JerfFoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:48 2015 UTC,It was because I had literally just told him a few days prior that I wanted to wait. lol. Changed my mind.
AskMen,3dwjkx,Djeter998,2,Mon Jul 20 16:19:43 2015 UTC,It's a good feeling to know someone is actually considerate of you and won't shun you just because you won't sleep with him/her.
AskMen,3dwjkx,JerfFoo,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:40 2015 UTC,"It really is, and it's not gender-specific. I dated a guy a few years ago who was embarrassed to tell me that he was a virgin. Needless to say, we took it slow and I respected him."

AskMen,3dwjkx,justsomegraphemes,7,Mon Jul 20 04:41:34 2015 UTC,"Well, ideally she'd want to have sex with me at basically the same point where I wanted to seriously have sex with her rather than just as a reaction to how she looked.  If I really like her and she really likes me, then I wouldn't feel it necessary to go on even a single date for any arbitrary reason of appropriateness.  Getting to that level of mutual interest requires a fair bit of contact for most people, though, hence going on dates and seeing one another, but I've certainly had relationships, especially when I was younger, where I'd felt out someone enough to know that I was interest and what sort of interest I had."

AskMen,3dwjkx,Meatros,8,Mon Jul 20 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"consider it is appropriate before having sex?    apropiate, wtf are we victorians? Nothing before the wedding night my dear sir, otherwise she is a harlot.   If you think this girl has a potential to be serious.   Fuck, there is no potential, that is bullshit. Most first dates are bullshit, you only really figure out who that person actually is later on. Would you buy a house just based on the neighbourhood it's in, never actually seeing it on the inside?  Regarding sex, it all depends on the chemistry. If you can't keep your hands of one another and fuck on the first date that is a better signal than having 5 perfectly proper dates that would bore your grandmother.  The cliche is that you line up a person based on 20 minutes of contact, sterile, awkward defensive contact. Take it one day at a time. Sex, no sex, whatever floats your boat at the time. Do not maintain the relationship based on what you imagine the relationship could turn in to.(this goes for everyone regardless of gender or orientation)"
AskMen,3dwjkx,gideon_zotero,7,Mon Jul 20 04:52:31 2015 UTC,"Damn, guys! I'm surprised how many responses are 'one date' or the like. If I really like her, I would want to at least wait a little bit. I think it makes it more fun that way because you've gotten to know them first. So I would say, I'm not going to make any moves until around the fourth date. Sex on the first, even second/third date just sounds 'cheap' to me. That's if I really like them. Otherwise, all bets are off."
AskMen,3dwjkx,justsomegraphemes,0,Mon Jul 20 04:35:26 2015 UTC,Meh don't have time to waste. Either you have a sex positive attitude like me or we're both just wasting our time.

AskMen,3dwjkx,KittyHammer,2,Mon Jul 20 12:35:00 2015 UTC,"Although I have had sex on a first date before, normally I wouldn't expect anything like that until the 3rd or 4th.  If we've not slept together on (or before) the 6th date, I'd start to wonder what's up."
AskMen,3dwjkx,h2g2_researcher,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"Preferably no more than four or five dates. I agree with DrossSA below. Typically the success stories have come about after 3 dates. All of the other women I've dated over five times without sex, it usually stalls and never happens. We part ways feeling like we wasted our time.  If sex doesn't happen by then, chances are kissing hasn't either in my experience. This makes for a very underwhelming dating experience. Though I did once date a recent divorcee for 6 months without sex. All we ever did was make out."
AskMen,3dwjkx,tbone5803,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:12 2015 UTC,By third date.
AskMen,3dwjkx,Warpfrenzy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"It just depends man.  If we kiss and other stuff but she isn't ready 100% after a month, there might be a reason for that. You gotta talk to her.  It shouldn't be expected with someone who's relatively a complete stranger to you. That is way more emotional/intimate for most women. I sort of had it happen weird with me and my current partner. We had been texting for a while after meeting online. She was on vacation with her dad so couldn't meet. Then when we eventually met, we spent all day together and it ended with sex. Which was incidentally losing my virginity lol.  Although things are on the rocks right now. I can feel it. I think there's probably a correlation between having sex too early and it ending potentially serious relationships. But it might also not matter at all. It's all about context and personal circumstances. IE: if you spend every other day together, it should lead to sex relatively soon I would think. Like a week or two."
AskMen,3dwjkx,MCMXChris,3,Mon Jul 20 04:57:34 2015 UTC,"At the least, 15 or so. But possibly more (possibly less). Until we're both comfortable. And yes I know that probably makes my options smaller.   Yes I'm weird. Or well okay my circumstances are exceptional."

AskMen,3dwjkx,DrThundercockMD,3,Mon Jul 20 03:14:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on the girl and where I meet her.

So, if you're on a dating site, you have all the preliminary talking you have to pass, often for a long time before you even get to the first date, then you have to do well there, then you have to decide where the right time is to start putting out the flirty lines to see if they get a good response, then you have to decide when it's good to go in for the kiss, with each step bringing potential disaster...it's so unpleasant that I get tired just thinking about it.  So, because that sucks so bad, I started being more blunt about what I wanted, and going for women who are more obviously into finding sexual partners. In a way I sometimes wish for something else, but not sure how to make that work."

I think it's a really important thing for parents to realize that their children are very realistically their prisoners in the eyes of the law. Children didn't get any choices for who their parents are, and they're not allowed to leave their parents' custody without their parents' consent until they're pretty old. So if you are holding someone prisoner who doesn't feel like they had a choice in their imprisonment, and then treat them like crap, you better expect them to not turn into the kind of person you want them to be. /u/i_heart_blondes has it exactly right."

AskMen,3dwwl2,Kaitly,9,Mon Jul 20 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"My step mom used to look through my phone when I was a teenager. In my house it was guilty until proven innocent. I was a good kid. Didn't date until I was allowed at 16. I was always home 30 minutes before curfew. I didn't go out on weeknights. My grades were great. Never drank or smoked. She said she had to check my messages before I deleted them to make room for more. She had my social media passwords. It was totally an invasion of privacy. The pastor at church had a sermon about checking in for your children's safety and she took it too far. I ended up putting my phone in my pillow case at night so I wouldn't wake up to her going through it. Even though I had nothing to hide. I told my friends not to send me anything personal, ""vulgar,"" or anything that could get me in trouble. It made me paranoid. I started calling my friends instead of texting them. I checked my back pack and eventually car for recording devices (she had some for her job and other things i honestly dont want to get into). Sometimes I still feel like someone is going to read through my messages and I've been out if the house for 4 years. She admits she wasn't the best behaved teenager, so she didn't trust us to be good. She had been in our lives since I was in elementary, so she had to know me and my siblings were really great and well behaved kids. I felt there was no merit to being a good kid. No matter how I acted, I was still untrusted and wasn't rewarded my privacy. I didn't feel I had a voice to dispute it.  Eventually I did speak up (more like exploded). Of course exploding never did any good. It only solidified her idea that I was too immature to be responsible with privacy. One day we are about to explode and I tried something different. I calmly stated that I ""knew that she felt she was protecting me"" and other bullshit she had been feeding me for years, but that I was in fact a good, smart kid and I knew how to keep out of danger. She reluctantly backed off a bit.   Just to conclude: it was most definitely a bad thing. I felt violated. I couldn't even talk to my friends about it without worrying. I can't tell you how many times I Googled if it was possible to pull up text conversations online. I am extremely paranoid. I have since calmed down a bit, and she has calmed down a lot. My brothers have text privacy but not social media.  They don't use it a lot though. It matured me since the other half wasn't being so mature. I learned how to argue effectively. Too much anxiety was formed here. It caused a major strain in our relationship and I haven't fully recovered. A lot of shit was messed up in our house hold... nothing physical, all mental.

Technology isn't just phones. Children do not belong inside of social networks. Every single social network agrees too - they all have age limits.

Yeah, if the kid's texting at the dinner table, tell them to put their phone away because it's impolite. As I said before, it doesn't matter how many people share your opinion.

If they are they know they're not supposed to and they're not going to tell you. Sure many kids aren't even going to get into any of that but the possible disastrous outcome justifies keeping an eye on their online/phone activity.   I'm not suggesting searching their room like a prison shake down. I'm saying that the internet and phones are a way for kids to get into a lot of trouble with much less effort than ever before.

Communication is communication), snooping is generally not something isolated to a single phone; it typically comes with a whole host of other intrusive, overbearing behaviors. Plus a 2000 study by Stattin and Kerr in Child Development has the following interesting text:   In one study of parental involvement and school performance, parent-child agreement and parent-child discussion predicted higher grade-point averages and achievement test scores, but measures of surveillance did not (Otto & Atkinson, 1997). In fact, parental monitoring of school work predicted lower, not higher, grades and test scores. In other words, communication was linked to good performance; surveillance was linked to bad performance. Further, in an intervention study that attempted to reduce adolescents' substance use, parents were trained and encouraged to exert more active efforts to control their children's associations with drug- and alcohol-using peers and their access to alcohol (Cohen & Rice, 1995). The intervention had no effect on adolescents' substance use. Nonetheless, parental knowledge of the child's whereabouts, good parent-child rapport, and a respectful parent-child relationship were all associated with less substance use. Again, parent-child communication was beneficial; surveillance and control were not."

If you want your child to come to you when those topics become relevant in their life, you have to make them feel like they can trust you. Snooping through their stuff is an excellent way of having your kid never tell you anything, for fear that you will judge them or that there will be consequences for asking questions.  OP should do their kid a solid and trust them to make good choices, but be there for them when they make bad ones."

If I wasn't comfortable talking about puberty I never would have talked to my Dad. My Dad was open about that stuff and it made it 1,000 times easier to ask him questions.  When I was about 15 he was looking through the browser history because he was trying to find a webpage he visited the day before that had an article about the ISS (he works for a ""space company"" and I'll leave it at that). He found that I had been searching some questionable things and he sat me down and said ""son I wasn't snooping but I found some sites you visited, I know that that stuff is going to be part of you growing up but please just make sure you're safe.

AskMen,3dwwl2,fillingtheland,5,Mon Jul 20 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a right to privacy. I think parents have no right to go through their children's stuff, and that it's a horrible thing to do to a child.  Here's what it comes down to. Parents usually want to do that because they are concerned about something their child might be doing. Well if they care at all about their child's mental well-being then violating their privacy isn't the solution to that problem, and will actually cause damage to the child and their relationship with the parent. The real question the parent should be asking is, ""what do I do that makes my child feel like they can't talk to me about this stuff openly?"" or ""why do I not trust that my child will be honest with me if I ask them about this, and what do I need to change about my relationship with my child so they will feel comfortable being honest with me?""  It's not always easy to convince a parent to change their perspective on something like this, but I think something you could bring up is this: violating your sister's privacy will only make your sister distrust your mom even more. You sister will then hide even more from her, because she doesn't want her privacy violated. That will only make it harder for your mom to know what is happening in your sister's life, and every time your mom violates your sister's privacy it will get worse. If your mom wants your sister to be open with her, she needs to show your sister that it's safe to tell her things, and that your mom will respect your sister's choices even if your mom doesn't always agree with them.  I think it would also be a good idea to reassure your sister that she has a right to privacy; she isn't wrong to want some things to be private. And if she needs to she is right to pursue ways to keep things private in her life."

For example my mom would ALWAYS ask me if girls liked me, so often that I would just tell her a maybe and not tell her. She would ask and then try and set me up on dates, so I ended up hiding stuff from her.   A good way for a parent to get rid of the trust their child has for them is to show that they don't trust their child.  I read a post awhile back about a girl who found out her mother had been reading her diary for years. How embarrassing. If you don't give them a space to have a private like they are going to force you to accommodate whether you know or not.

That said, once I have taught them how to be safe, where on the Web not to go and what not to do,  I see no reason to stand over their shoulder watching 24/7, any more than I would follow my kid borrowing the car to go to the river for the day with her friends.

It's very true that not actively looking would drastically reduce the number of people you meet. But I think they interpret things like self improvement as 'not looking'.   So if you're going to the gym, taking a couple fun classes, learning to dance salsa, etc etc they might say you'll meet people with similar interests or goals. There's some merit in self improvement being more useful, to a point, than more effort searching.  Of course, they're forgetting something about ""not looking"" and ""stop caring so much"".

AskMen,3dtxdk,salami_inferno,117,Sun Jul 19 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of my women friends think that male gender performativity is something we can just abandon with no real consequences, so they remind us: ""Hey, it's OK for men to cry, and share your emotions, and feel vulnerable- just do it!"". It can be hard to get across to them that even if a lot of us are more than willing to do all that, there are consequences for doing so. I've spent different times of my life either fitting into the male gender role or abandoning it, and I can tell you that the level of respect we get from men and women alike is very different.   I don't know why my women friends don't understand this- if it's because for them, being a 'tomboy' comes with what seems like fewer consequences than a man being un-manly, or if they think that because of male privilege, we can do whatever we want to regarding gender without social consequence.   But yeah- every time I do something a bit macho, a lot of my women friends are like, ""Why are you being so macho? Ugh, insecure much?"". This happened recently, when I was discussing some new jobs I'm applying for because I'm really poor right now and desperate for higher-paid work. The jobs I'm pursuing right now are a river tow boat deckhand, a bouncer, an automobile recycling production worker, a lumber yard worker, and a construction laborer. My longer-term career tajectory is forestry, and my background is agricultural labor. So, I have background in very dangerous work, my aim in the future is in very dangerous work, and all my current job options are in very dangerous work. Someone was pointing this out, and I just sort of took a flippant, black-humorous approach to it. Some of my women friends started taking me to task for being so macho. It's hard to explain: ""Yeah, actually I have to have a nonchalant attitude about the possibility of being killed on the job, because if I don't, then I might get fired, not get hired, or just lose the respect of everyone I work with and everyone else I know"".    Actually, it's a similar deal with applying for public assistance. I really, really need it- and I've gone the past two years being eligible for it (working in Americorps and then just being poor while working at a charity) without applying for it. I'm eligible for food assistance, housing assistance, and probably even disability payments. I know that if I take it, though, then people will think I'm dependent, and that's not OK for a relatively able-bodied young man to be. If I'm on the dole, then when I apply for a job I might get turned down just for being a 'moocher'. So, it's a little odd for people to say ""It's OK to cry! It's OK to be vulnerable!"" when in reality masculinity can be such a straight jacket that it's hardly OK to advocate for your own safety on the job or to ask for assistance when you need it.   Edit: I GOT THE DECKHAND JOB! Holy crap, I'm so happy right now."

Basically her observation is that catcalling is predominantly perpetrated by poor working class men (with a not insignificant racial component). And the majority of the online commentary on catcalling is by relatively privileged white educated women (although I doubt this group is receiving the majority of the catcalling).  So there's this weird tension between privileged white women going online in their air conditioned offices or posh coffee shops, and telling the world how uncomfortable and oppressed they have been by these men toiling out on road crews. Women are not wrong at all to hate it, but the article writing and discussions they have about it are almost performance art, since chances are the men who are catcalling will never see these articles and will never change their behaviour because of them."

There is a somewhat analogous situation with regard to the heterosexual seduction procedure in our Politically Correct times: the two sets, the set of PC behaviour and the set of seduction, do not actually intersect anywhere; that is, there is no seduction which is not in a way an ""incorrect"" intrusion or harassment — at some point, one has to expose oneself and ""make a pass."" So does this mean that every seduction is incorrect harassment through and through? No, and that is the catch: when you make a pass, you expose yourself to the Other (the potential partner), and she decides retroactively, by her reaction, whether what you have just done was harassment or a successful act of seduction — and there is no way to tell in advance what her reaction will be. This is why assertive women often despise ""weak"" men — because they fear to expose themselves, to take the necessary risk. And perhaps this is even more true in our PC times: are not PC prohibitions rules which, in one way or another, are to be violated in the seduction process? Is not the seducer’s art to accomplish this violation properly — so that afterwards, by its acceptance, its harassing aspect will be retroactively cancelled?"

So girls win the social game, and guys win the war.

AskMen,3dtxdk,brycedriesenga,37,Mon Jul 20 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yep. Rape is about power, not sex.   Power is often one component, absolutely, but I don't think we can really dismiss the sexual aspect entirely like that."
AskMen,3dtxdk,dakru,24,Sun Jul 19 17:37:54 2015 UTC,How many rapes are committed by asexuals?
AskMen,3dtxdk,cypher197,12,Sun Jul 19 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"Out of genuine curiosity, what evidence is there of this? Like any statistical analysis or interviews with rapists?  Only reason I ask is because I want to say I've read that there is a strong correlation between rapists and childhood abuse victims, and that incidents of rape are much rarer in cultures with legal prostitution (although I can easily see how that information could just be due to sex workers being ignored in that statistic). I've heard that it's about power, but I've never heard any sort of explanation as to why anyone thinks that. And in any case if we're going to prevent rape we need to understand what factors contribute to it."
AskMen,3dtxdk,HalfysReddit,46,Sun Jul 19 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"I hate hearing this justification because it makes it seem like a 'oh boys will be boys' excuse. It has very little to do with horny and a lot to do with control and power. It makes all men potential perpetrators, instead of saying that people who have power and control issues are potential rapists."
AskMen,3dtxdk,AlyssaXIII,21,Sun Jul 19 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"The most important thing about rape is that most cases will be perpetrated by repeated offenders. Telling people this lie about it being about lust makes them more likely to forgive ""because he could have not helped it"". All men know rape is wrong, inclusive the ones doing it, and that's why they do it."
AskMen,3dtxdk,minimim,77,Sun Jul 19 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"My sister seems to think men aren't taught properly that raping is bad, so that if they're raised that rape is unacceptable that they wont do it...  I'm pretty sure 90% of the time rapists are just sick fucks and 100% of the time they know that it's unacceptable. It's not like you can be like ""didn't you know!? Rape is bad!"" And they'll be like ""oh... I was never told that I can't put my penis forcefully in a girl without permission.  I'm so glad you let me know"".   It's like telling a smoker that smoking is bad for you. They know. You're not providing them with any new information."
AskMen,3dtxdk,takingbackalison,36,Sun Jul 19 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Rapist, no raping!  ""Aw, man."""
AskMen,3dtxdk,zerefin,23,Sun Jul 19 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"I think the pivotal point in conversations like this are how we're defining ""rape."" In my experience, when men talk about ""rape"" they're talking about attacking a woman and pinning her down. When women talk about rape they're often talking about being drugged, or taken advantage of when they're blackout drunk, or being coerced--often it's date rape or even domestic rape. There was a study someone posted once (that of course I can't find) that said concluded that many male rapists didn't know they were rapists. There was even a thread on /r/legaladvice recently where a guy was panicked because a girl accused him of rape, meanwhile all of the comments were telling them that he did rape her--she clearly only had sex with him because she felt trapped and scared that he would get violent.    This is why consent laws have gotten so crazy lately."
AskMen,3dtxdk,fruitjerky,15,Sun Jul 19 23:59:02 2015 UTC,It's like saying all criminals didn't know what they were doing is wrong. It's ridiculous.
AskMen,3dtxdk,Nick-Cage,5,Mon Jul 20 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"and 100% of the time they know that it's unacceptable.   I honestly don't think that it's 100% of the times. Popular culture in movies and stuff like that usually portrays rape as really violent and in ""stranger in a bush"" kind of situation, while most of the stuff that's not the case. I read a study some months ago which had questions regarding sexual assault and forcing the other person to do things against their will. The study had 19% admitting that they had not respected, while 7% admitted that they had raped a person. I honestly think that rape is so demonized that some people think that their milder ways of doing it aren't rape, even though they actually are."
AskMen,3dtxdk,Tuosma,49,Sun Jul 19 23:46:03 2015 UTC,"I work in psychiatry. I notice that people who have legitimate personality disorders as the ones whos opinions are completely out of wack from reality, but those people also learn to hide their personality disorder well enough to get by. I wonder how much of the extremists of any social movement are just personality disorder people who need to be on medication"
AskMen,3dtxdk,iliketurtlesdurr,25,Mon Jul 20 09:36:37 2015 UTC,I wonder how much of the extremists of any social movement are just personality disorder people who need to be on medication   As someone who used to be on the far left side of politics and activism:  All of them.  It is a verifiable zoo of disorders.
AskMen,3dtxdk,Hoodwink,21,Sun Jul 19 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Many women think they understand men, but they really really don't.  It's still socially acceptable for them to act that way, though.  (IME, bi/pan women are less clueless, but YMMV.)"
AskMen,3dtxdk,cypher197,172,Sun Jul 19 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I kinda got into it with my ex the other day because of her behavior. She thinks its okay for her to date 4 guys at once when none of them know about each other. She uses them for dates, and get them to buy her things, and she sees no problem with it. She claims that she's using the charms that God gave her. She says that they're ""courting"" her, and its an old school way of dating. She's a very good looking girl, but she's pretty mentally unstable.   So she comes back to our hometown (where I live, she's away at school) and tries to pull the same shit with me again. Talk about all the good times we had (dated for two years, happiest I've ever been, honestly), and tries to get back with me. Then she gets mad at me when I blow her off. Now I'm a jerk for not responding to her advances even though she's outright admitted to using the guys she dates when she's away at school. There's so much more to this story that I don't feel completely okay with sharing. I want to be there for her, and be a good friend, but she wants to act as if we never dated, and for the most part we can both see through each other's crap.   I spent two years spending money and time on her, and she expects me to play the same game as the guys at school. Part of me wants to find out who they are and let them know what she's doing. I understand playing the field but according to one of her friends, at least 3 of the 4 guys think that they're boyfriend/girlfriend. Its screwed up from someone that's a STEM major that constantly whines about how she doesn't get the same opportunity as the men. I don't even know what to think.  Honestly if this were two months ago I wouldn't even care, but I've been laid up with a neck injury and now all I can really do is stew on my thoughts and answer the phone whenever someone calls."
AskMen,3dtxdk,JustHadaGusgasm,96,Sun Jul 19 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"She thinks its okay for her to date 4 guys at once when none of them know about each other.   I had a close friend that was doing this with three guys, though there was one that she actually liked and wanted to be with. But she liked the attention and presents from all of them. Two were guys she had met online, but one of the guys was a very old friend of hers (and a new friend of mine). When the old friend finally told her he thought he might have feelings for her, she did the whole, ""Oh, I'm just not sure I'm ready for a relationship right now, but maybe eventually"" to try to keep him on the hook, even though he wasn't the one she wanted to be exclusive with. I became really disgusted with her, this was a guy who had been there for her for years. The least she could do is be honest and let him know that she didn't have feelings for him and/or had feelings for someone else instead of stringing him along.   Long story short, he and I have been dating for the past two years and neither one of us talk to her anymore. And I'm 99% sure she actually did become exclusive with that other guy."
AskMen,3dtxdk,Petyr_Baelish,36,Sun Jul 19 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Long story short, he and I have been dating for the past two years and neither one of us talk to her anymore. And I'm 99% sure she actually did become exclusive with that other guy.   The hilarious part is when she gets mad at you for this after retroactively deciding that he was The One and that You Stole Him From Her. HOW DARE YOU. After all, you're happy together, so that means you stole her happiness!"
AskMen,3dtxdk,POGtastic,26,Sun Jul 19 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"That is EXACTLY what happened lol. It was a little distressing at the time, but we both realized that we don't need people who are going to act like that in our lives. We're getting way too old for that shit."
AskMen,3dtxdk,Petyr_Baelish,33,Sun Jul 19 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"This is her to a T. She loves the attention, and until recently she wasn't getting the amount that she wanted. But she wants me back, just not as a boyfriend, and I'm not playing that game. I'm just waiting for someone that wants me and only me to come along. According to her that's an unrealistic point of view."

She uses them for dates, and get them to buy her things, and she sees no problem with it.   Many women I know have an understanding of dating and marriage: ""He gets to have sex with me; he buys me things!""  That's called (legalized) prostitution, but they never see it that way.  These are the same women that bring almost nothing to the table, save for their bodies."
AskMen,3dtxdk,65049854072165154789,98,Mon Jul 20 06:16:03 2015 UTC,"Orange is the New Black.  I tried to enjoy it, I really did. Watched the entire first season with my girlfriend. Spent the entire time just getting pissed off at the protagonist and how she was such a dumbshit creating all of these minor problems for herself and then falling apart all over the place. As far as I can tell the show is primarily about just how incompetent and ignorant the protagonist is."
AskMen,3dtxdk,HalfysReddit,53,Sun Jul 19 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"Piper Champan is not a protagonist in the typical sense of the word, at least in that you're not supposed to identify with or even like her*. She is an anti-hero, like Walter White or Tony Soprano. A deeply flawed, psychologically damaged, occasionally violent criminal who often does wrong, who you're not supposed to identify with, and who happens to be the main character.  NGL, I binged the first season. I also got through a handful of seasons of Weeds until I just couldn't take it any more (that show was written into a corner by the middle of the second season. I felt like I could tell that Jenji Kohan had listened to the focus groups and market research, responded to the shortcomings of the writing on Weeds, and really stepped up her game with OITNB.  Also I want more Netflix original series to exist, so I feel slightly obligated to watch as many as I can at least once."
AskMen,3dtxdk,giraffe_taxi,12,Sun Jul 19 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't anyone likes Piper. She's got her head up her ass, that's the point of her character. I actually really enjoy OITNB.  I couldn't stand Weeds though. Drove me bonkers."
AskMen,3dtxdk,raspberrywafer,7,Sun Jul 19 21:35:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, Weeds. With its initial premise, it could have been as amazing as Breaking Bad. Buuut... SPOILER ALERT   ...paying attention to the dramatic details lost me after they killed a DEA agent and basically nothing came of it.  However I did enjoy some elements --mainly the the comic relief-- enough to power through a few more seasons. Kevin Nealon was on SNL when I was in high school, which means I'll pretty much watch him in anything."
AskMen,3dtxdk,giraffe_taxi,14,Sun Jul 19 22:52:03 2015 UTC,She's not interesting enough to be a Walter White or Tony Soprano.
AskMen,3dtxdk,0-90195,6,Sun Jul 19 23:10:58 2015 UTC,"I guess the difference between her and Tony/Walt is that the ladder characters are instantly likeable despite their obvious flaws whereas Piper just comes off as an incompetent dispshit from he get go.  It's probably just because her character is poorly written,  but still."
AskMen,3dtxdk,Nutzillaa,6,Mon Jul 20 02:48:49 2015 UTC,"A million times this. The first season was 'meh', but it gets REAL dumb in the second."
AskMen,3dtxdk,AManAlone,259,Mon Jul 20 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"Probably cheating. My recent ex, few of her friends and a few other girls tried to justify making out with one another as ""kissing grandma"" and not cheating, but considered me looking at another girl grounds for infidelity. I just fail to understand the reasoning behind this. Insecurity maybe??  In saying this my ex was cheating on me."
AskMen,3dtxdk,artilleryboy,152,Sun Jul 19 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Insecurity maybe??   No, dude. She was straight up cheating on you, like you said at the start. She just wanted to have a cute little name on it so that its not the same as the two timing eye-rape (/s) that you do anytime you happen to glance at a pretty lady."
AskMen,3dtxdk,thekarateguy,35,Sun Jul 19 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with eye rape as long as its just looking. We both frequently check out good looking people with the understanding that there are a lot of attractive people in the world, that does not mean we are ""cheating""."

I would be insane to believe that once we are in a relationship we will never find another person to be attractive ever again.  That's just not how that works.  What's not okay, however, is for him to gawk at a pretty girl when out with me.  If I'm talking to him and he's practically drooling at the mouth over some chick that walked by, it's not okay.  Glancing?  Sure.  Have at it.  At the end of the day, he comes home with me."

AskMen,3dtxdk,666lumberjack,9,Sun Jul 19 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"A narcissist I knew made up newer and newer definitions for cheating so she could continue to be the perpetual victim.  One of my favorites is when she went on a high and mighty tirade on one of her exes for cheating on her.  They had been broken up for almost a year, but the fact he was on a date with another woman was cheating because he ""didn't allow our relationship to naturally dissolve; he didn't give us a chance to heal!""  She dumped him because he was not circumcised.  Two dates in.  After knowing him for all of 1 month.  Ahem."

She also has taken up the cause for random ""comic book feminism"" issues, despite having never read a comic book in her life.  A: Despite having been in 3 relationships in the time I've known her, and having no less than 4 other dudes (that I know of) be interested in her, believes she has it as rough as men who have been single for 10+ years."
AskMen,3dtxdk,cubemstr,176,Sun Jul 19 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"I love game of thrones because it's written so equally! There are so many badass female characters. Isn't there that quote from George r r Martin where he's asked how he writes females so well, and he says something along the lines of ""I just imagine them as people and write their characters from there""?"
AskMen,3dtxdk,Moolemon,178,Sun Jul 19 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. People who claim GoT is sexist aren't paying attention. Shitty things happen equally to everyone on that show. The violence women face tends to be more sexual than the men, but the awfulness is pretty evenly distributed.  There's a certain strain of person who sees anything bad happening to a woman as sexism. I haven't yet found a response to them that they accept."
AskMen,3dtxdk,dermanus,20,Sun Jul 19 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly. Because of the world/time it's set in, the different genders have different kinds of problems launched at them. This doesn't stop either gender fighting through their problems they're faced with. Yes rape happens to some of the women, that's because the world they live in isn't paradise.  If you compare it to a show like the 'big bang theory' (easy example), every woman in that show seems to be just there for the male scientists to date. Any woman that's introduced is either a family member, or a love interest. I end up liking the guys more just because they're made into more interesting characters. I think GoT is the only show I like where my favourite characters are equally split by gender. I really love it. GoT shows that people can be gentle or badass, it doesn't depend on their gender."
AskMen,3dtxdk,Moolemon,96,Sun Jul 19 15:13:07 2015 UTC,I think the accusations come from the amount of sexual violence towards women that wasn't in the novels. It's just kind of a strange choice by the writers  Edit: Not just Sansa. There are other scenes like the one where Jaime rapes Cercei when in the book it was consensual.
AskMen,3dtxdk,ChapstickConnoisseur,46,Sun Jul 19 18:17:38 2015 UTC,I dunno about that. There was some truly awful stuff in the book that was not in the show.
AskMen,3dtxdk,792155002,24,Sun Jul 19 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"but then, it seems strange and unnecessary to also reverse that with the addition of sexual violence that wasn't"
AskMen,3dtxdk,MusicIsPower,11,Sun Jul 19 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"The difference it's that in the books, sexual violence happens to common females with saddening regularity, as is to be expected in a war torn medieval era and not brave feminist Sansa.  I've never seen anyone complain that Jayne Poole was raped by dogs or forced to work as a whore in brothels. Neither cu they care about the girl that was gang raped by a mob in Kings Landing.  Sexual violence is rife in Westeros, both in the books and show."

A woman can fuck around with other women, determine she didn't like it and few people will bat an eye. If a DUDE does that, he's gay for LIFE. You may as well just stamp it on his forehead..

Why am I repressed for not being into guys?   It's not like I'm just being held back from boning other dudes by my own fear of being called 'gay', either- I've been active in LGBT rights politics since I was in middle school, and been attacked for 'being gay' more than once.

OK, then if that's the case, stop framing this like women are paid less for the same work.

For my ex sex was great and exciting at first, then it became like fucking the couch and I stopped caring whether or not she actually got off or was satisfied.  Of course, I am also an asshole and got into the relationship knowing I really wasn't all that attracted to her. oops"

But I have to put time, effort, and energy to get ready to go somewhere like The Melting Pot or Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.   I'm not sure this works. It sounds to me like I'm hungover on the couch in my boxers and Fogo de Chao just offered to set up shop in my living room. I have a hard time imagining the scenario in which I turn this down.  Nevertheless, Fogo isn't open 24/7, but McDonald's is."

My gf is pretty cool, I could slip it in whenever I want while in private, even while she is sleeping(given that green light on day 1). It was when she was laying on her front with her ass exposed and I wanted to pound it that I realized it wasn't really worth the effort; Gotta lube up, focus a shit-ton because it's tough for me to cum to her pussy(death grip and not used to moving half my body vs. one arm to cum) and then afterward I'm sticky as hell and gotta clean up. I'll fuck her the first time I see her, which is once a week/10 days, but I can't be bothered to go through the trouble a few hours after again. I'd rather just jerk off while looking at her body."

I love those lazy weekends when we go at it 3 or 4 times in one day. It would suck if you literally couldn't be bothered to have sex with me because you'd rather just jerk it to avoid clean up.

AskMen,3dx20o,AlkanKorsakov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:06:51 2015 UTC,The main thing is that it's difficult for me to cum. Two days ago I spent the night. Fucked and came after a lot of patience. Then I woke her up with my dick and I tried as hard as I could but I just couldn't get off(25 min of trying). It was pretty frustrating to just not be able to find that orgasm link to latch on to and finish. The cleanup afterward doesn't make it seem worth the frustration of not cumming. I happily clean up if I do manage to finish because I still have a nice feeling as I'm wiping off and I can relax and watch netflix with her.
AskMen,3dx20o,vhmPook,2,Mon Jul 20 07:02:12 2015 UTC,Are you working on your death grip issue at all?
AskMen,3dx20o,ajdeemo,2,Mon Jul 20 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I bought a fleshlight to use my hand less. Curiously I cum to that much more easily(as fast as my hand if I want), more easily than I'd want if it was the real thing. I've improved a bit, I actually get properly hard now unlike before. Blowjobs are still very far from being successful, and handjobs feel really nice but take a lot to focus on the nice feeling and by the time I get close her arms get tired."
AskMen,3dx20o,mattmorg55,4,Mon Jul 20 07:08:26 2015 UTC,That's good that you're working on it. Death grip seems to be a huge issue for a lot of guys who grew up with internet porn and I don't think a lot of them even realize it.

AskMen,3dx20o,pan_glob,3,Mon Jul 20 06:47:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're being extremely accommodating and he isn't trying at all. Given that his libido is on the low side, it seems to me that he should at least let you participate somehow when he wants to watch porn and jerk off. I have to agree with other posters who have said it sounds like sexual incompatibility.   However, if this could end up being a life-long relationship and everything else is great, maybe you should consider this among other factors.   I'm curious as to whether this seemingly selfish behavior on his part manifests itself in non-sexual areas of your relationship?"

My girlfriend has a high sex drive and hates the thought of me getting myself off. You basically have to give up porn unless you watch a little right before she gets home. If you are pushing this then you have to up your initiation game. It starts feeling like we are a chore if we are like ""baby, i need to get off"".  Everyone is different, but i think about fucking as soon as i wake up next to her. And it doesn't go away until i get some action. If you reach for his dick very early and get rid of that first one he might be able to hold off until later in the day when he would hopefully initiate some real sex with you."

If I don't initiate at all, we won't do anything for over a week and he'll finally ""initiate"", which is basically him just asking me if we can have sex.

AskMen,3dx20o,Meatros,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:36 2015 UTC,I would still want to masturbate. Sometimes I just want to spend time with myself and whack off to porn that is completely different than anything I'd ever actually do IRL.
AskMen,3dx20o,PrintError,5,Tue Jul 21 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"I will never, ever give it up.  I do it every night before bed to help me sleep.  To clear another ""myth"", yes, an orgasm DOES make men tired.  I do it especially when I can't sleep well.  It's like urinating.  If you're worried about him thinking of other girls...   He might be, and he probably is.  I do it myself for variety.  But he may not be like that.  Anyway, I usually take about five minutes to do it just to ""get it over with"".  Sex I have to put A LOT more effort and performance into because I want to please my partner as well.  But if it's 1:00am and I need to wake up for work tomorrow I'll just masturbate to quiet my mind and sleep.  I am also one of those men who do it right before doing something I may later regret -- for example, I visited a girl from OKCupid but she does every drug under the sun, including heroine, and she probably has an STI or two from her previous sexual exploits.  So i would masturbate before seeing her so I wouldn't feel any stupid urges later on when I was with her.  I like masturbation more than sex.  I can make it go as fast or slow as I please.  I can do a full stop without losing sexual momentum with my partner.  I can get up to get a drink or take a break.  I can make it last hours if I'm single and have time to kill.  I can do it in five minutes if I need to get it out of the way for the above reasons."

I wouldn't really want to trouble her sometimes for a quickly rubbed out wank and sometimes I just need my me time.  Doesn't really have an impact on my sex life in relationships though, since I'm usually not having as much sex with my partner as I would like except for the occasional week where either my sex life has kicked into overdrive or my sex drive has taken a vacation.  It sounds like you feel like you're in competition with your boyfriend's masturbatory habits for feeling sexually fulfilled.  Apparently with good reason because he can't must up any sexual energy for days after orgasming once.  You're probably either in territory where maybe couple's counseling might help, since as you mentioned, some kind of sexual attention even if it's not fucking you should be manageable for him, but there's a very real possibility that the only resolution is to split up and find someone you mesh with better sexually.   I used to masturbate twice daily before I started dating him, now I hold off as long as I can for the chance to be with him before taking care of myself.   Isn't that just making you more crazy and frustrated than you would be if you were masturbating daily in addition to fucking him?   I'm just trying to see if I'm crazy to think it's possible to just be sexual with your SO.   I don't think that's what's making you crazy or is all that crazy, even if I don't really think it's possible.  I think it's the sexual incompatibility that's not really been addressed that's driving you crazy and just won't go away without being directly addressed, if it even can go away without just having your relationship cease to be."

I constantly think about sex and just want to share that with him. I can go a long time between orgasms without missing it. When I masturbate, it takes so much longer for me to cum when we do have sex and it's not nearly as intense.   I just wish sex drives didn't fluctuate so much. Like many other couples, we fucked like rabbits when we first got together and I made the mistake of moving to another state to be with him too soon.
