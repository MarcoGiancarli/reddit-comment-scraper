The doctor said that they are slightly more effective than the type in your link and easier to dial in the precise recommended traction force, but that the inflatable types work also and which type to recommend ultimately comes down to the patient's personal preference.   The doctor also said that these are by far the best type for home use, but expensive and not covered by my insurance plan.

WTFgaragesale,32zy64,HamShanky,41,Wed Apr 22 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"I popped out to hit some sales during my lunch hour, since the first real wave of the new season had begun. The highlight of the afternoon was this strange, desperate sort of estate sale, clearing the belongings of someone who-- for reasons likely tragic but not disclosed to me-- completely gave up on life sometime around 1980.  The sale was essentially ""Go into this dilapidated house, and anything you can root out from the piles of junk foot-deep on the floor is for sale."" The people running the sale had the defeated air of having given up under inhuman odds. Magazines upon magazines from the '70s and '80s were six inches deep on the upstairs floor, half-broken TVs were littered about, the house was dark, dismal, piled with crap, and mustiness pervaded everything. (The home of one of those ""hoarding"" sorts, I'd suspect, or someone who'd suffered an injury that put them out of commission for the last 35+ years.) There was nothing obvious that indicated the situation, but a feeling of sadness... and spore proliferation... hung in the air.  All doors were thrown open in careless defeat, dangerously so, I might add. The rickety, junk-filled second floor (with open holes in the floor to the main storey) competed with the damp, dark, basement (with a staircase that may have not been anchored to anything) for which was less inviting to both cheer and personal safety.  Although there was an overriding musty odor, the piles of paper-upon-paper upstairs did allow a sort of natural protection from the elements, and I ended up with some well-preserved Commodore Computers brochures, and a '75-'76 phone book that was in middling shape (but phone books are my ""thing"", so I picked it up anyway.)  The basement was mostly a wash-- rust and mold had taken most everything-- but there was a pantry shelf in the basement, on which I don't think there was a single item made later than 1990. (Most, like this Thousand Island dressing, were from the 1970s or 1980s.) It was a fascinating museum of mid-century grocery packaging, and I felt a bit like Indiana Jones uncovering the Ark of the... Guy who Never Went Grocery Shopping for 35 Years.  Some items had fallen entirely to the effects of rust and bacteria, others just looked like a haven for tetanus and strange disease. Cans were bloated, decayed, and exploded, but among them was this, a near-pristine glass bottle of Thousand Island dressing, looking almost like it had come off right the shelf, but marked BETTER WHEN PURCHASED BY ""MAR 08 78"". Being as I am, I couldn't let a specimen of such perfection go to waste, so I am now the proud owner of a bottle of salad dressing older than I am.  Bonus: I just remembered that I snapped a shot of the Museum of Mid-Century Foodstuffs. Unfortunately, I cut off the interesting bottom shelf, but here's what I've got: http://imgur.com/REhIjAo"

They turned on their own country to maintain that right making them traitors.  After losing the war, they maintain a society hating people of these freed slaves hence racism. Regardless of what any southern American or Caucasian American may want to say the Confederate flag is a symbol of racism you can ask any historian on the face of planet earth that knows anything about American history, including American scholars themselves."

WTFgaragesale,2ie8qb,grillo7,3,Thu Jan 1 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"I'm almost done with a bachelor's in history and I don't entirely agree. This isn't because you're technically wrong, but because historical study doesn't include calling factions ""traitors"" or ultimately laying down the law on the racism of a flag.  The ""confederate flag"" was not an actual unifying flag but the flag of one of the South's navies. Each state actually had their own flag. One of many reasons that high school level US history is mostly worthless.  Now as for whether people idolizing the flag nowadays are doing it for racist reasons, I'm not sure. Maybe. It seems that way. But the issue of whether a flag is racist is not of interest to any historian."

The metaphor in the anecdote represents a popular notion of the myth that Earth is actually flat and is supported on the back of a World Turtle, which itself is propped up by a chain of larger and larger turtles. Questioning what the final turtle might be standing on, the anecdote humorously concludes that it is ""turtles all the way down"".  The phrase was used by Stephen Hawking in 1988, but has been commonly known since at least the early 20th century. A comparable metaphor describing the circular cause and consequence for the same problem is the ""chicken and egg problem"". The same problem in epistemology is known as the Münchhausen trilemma.

It's been a few years, but I vaguely recall a maneuver involving placing the diaper on top if the kid was about to urinate, and it's darn easy to tell if it's about to happen.   palming one of those tepees onto said son the second it happens   Oh, I think the idea is that you place the teepee on your infant every single time, just in case... which really just gets in the way because you'd have to remove it to clean. I think these products are sold primarily to new parents who don't know what they need, so they buy everything. And people who don't have kids buy them for baby showers."

In hindsight from our second child, I know that our first child was a saint... good sleeper, early talker, fast learner, loved following rules, didn't taste inanimate objects, didn't get into cupboards, etc.  The second child... no words until age 2, got into everything, pulled a door half off its hinges making a brute force assault on the babyproofing device, broke a kitchen cupboard seeing how far back he could extend the door, destroyed his crib (stripped the wood screws pushing it apart), climbed everything, and so forth. He's six now. When we show him toddler photos of his sister, he sees all sorts of toys and things he doesn't remember having, and the common refrain is, ""Oh you broke that,"" or ""You almost killed yourself using it in a way you weren't supposed too, so we had to get rid of it."" (Like, one of those plastic kitchens with the oven/fridge/etc. built into one tall unit... he'd climb to the top, wobble it and ride it to the floor.)"
