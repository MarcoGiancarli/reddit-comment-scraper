I can't affirm this, because I've only put the pillow on the outside of the house.       I've had him visit me twice to use the pillow, and both were with valuable crisps. He uses the pillow a lot less than turning up for food, that is for sure. In my game, he's come as often as 3 times in a day to eat! As to when he will choose the pillow above food, is anybody's guess."
nekoatsume,3dqlb5,timecity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"I believe I read that Manzoku-san will not come inside.  I know for me, he only comes when I put premium food outside.  Oh, and when he comes take the picture before you refill the bowl.  As soon as you refill, he will disappear!"
nekoatsume,3dqlb5,asdjfweaiv,4,Sat Jul 18 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"Manzoku-san eats food only from the outside. I am sorry if I'm telling you something you know already, but there is no need to refill the bowl when Manzoku-san is eating. He will go away on his own when he is finished ""eating"" (it can take some time, up to one hour or more even). The bowl looks empty but that's deceptive. If you take away the bowl before he has finished eating (i.e. replace it immediately when he comes), he will not be generous with the fish he gives you. If you leave him alone to eat, he will usually give you large amounts of sardines in return.      TL;DR - don't change the food until Manzoku-san leaves the game on his own."
nekoatsume,3dqlb5,timecity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:34:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you!  I knew he only came outside, but I did not know about leaving him alone.  I was trying to figure out why he sometimes only gave me a few fish, and other times a lot.  =)"

I will definitely have to buy this item."

nekoatsume,3dojz6,nmrk,2,Sat Jul 18 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"Oops, I accidentally deleted my comment, I put some effort into it so I will post it again.    As far as anyone can tell, the backgrounds have no effect on how many cats appear. They all have the same number of spots for toys, just in different places.  I could make some educated guesses about how the game is programmed, but that would take away a lot of the magic. I think we can all see that different toys and food have different levels of attractiveness to the cats, but if the background has any properties like that, it is so small as to be unobservable.   I think the backgrounds are mostly aesthetic choices. Like for example, in the Japanese garden (the one with the arched bridge over the water) there is a tokonoma (a little alcove in the wall) with a scroll hanging over a vase. The background's vase matches the color and design of the tsubo. I think they are supposed to be Bizen Ware.     In reply to your new comment, the half-house definitely gets fewer cats than the full, expanded house."
nekoatsume,3dojz6,CrazyNekoObasan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:28:56 2015 UTC,"When I started off (1/2 the yard), I maxed out at 8, but generally I agree that I had on average 3-5 cats.  I noticed, though, that once I expanded, the cats got a lot snootier about the food.  When I only had 1/2 the yard, the cats came frequently with the high-quality crisps.  Once I expanded, though, the cats only came with the same level of frequency when I left wet cat food (the cheapest one).  I guess cats also suffer from the same lifestyle-inflation we do.  :-)"

nekoatsume,3djluf,Scarlet-Spades,6,Thu Jul 16 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"In cats, coat color is on the X chromosome. Female cats have two X chromosomes and only one is active in each cell. X-chromosome inactivation happens randomly during fetal development. For this reason calico and tortoiseshell cats are almost always female since one X chromosome had the red gene and the other had the black gene. In rare cases, you can have a calico/tortoiseshell male with XXY chromosomes, but they are usually infertile.  However, it isn't true that red/orange/cream cats can generally be assumed to be male. For example, females can be red if they inherited two X chromosomes with a red gene (one from each parent). It isn't extremely rare like calico males.  In-game, I named my calico cat Barr B (for Barr body, the name of an inactivated X-chromosome) :3"
nekoatsume,3djluf,pseudomoanass,5,Fri Jul 17 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification! I found this explanation online as well:  ""Dee: Well, it’s not that orange female cats are rare, it is simply that an orange cat is more likely to be a male. For a female cat to be orange, she must inherit two orange genes — one from her mother (orange, calico, or tortoiseshell) and one from her father (who must be orange). A male cat needs only one orange gene, which he gets from his mother (orange, calico, or tortoiseshell). This is because the gene that codes for orange fur is on the X chromosome, and like humans, females have two Xs and males are XY. Genes on the X chromosome are said to be sex-linked."""
nekoatsume,3djluf,Ziggo001,4,Fri Jul 17 02:11:33 2015 UTC,"Red female cats are not rare, simply uncommon. A source I found says 25% of red (or red and white) cats are female. When you breed a male red cat and female calico/tortie (very common colours), the chance that a kitten from their litter is both female and red is 33%. Cream is an alternate version of the ""red gene"" and works in the same way afaik. The chance of a male calico/tortie being born from these parents is less than 0,001%"

nekoatsume,3dik8u,Ritinya,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:56 2015 UTC,Different toys fit the aesthetic of different houses. For example the modern house goes well with objects that are primarily glass/gold/red/white/black. The Japanese garden goes well with wooden/brown/greeb/blue/grey objects etc

Tap the first option that says あいことば入力 to get the reward immediately.  If you're on Android, you need to enter the code (the Japanese characters) in あいことば入力 before you get your fish. You can either type it using a Japanese keyboard or copy-paste it from the reddit posts. Here are some other input methods.  Have fun!"

nekoatsume,3dcue0,tiniest-nyan,4,Wed Jul 15 07:17:44 2015 UTC,"I agree about prioritizing maximum cats per space. But I'm not so sure game encourages delayed gratification... I'm pretty ADDey, and I went with a buy more/get more strategy, which also worked well. I think the game is open to different play strategies maybe?  Anyway, my favorite items for getting sardines were the cardboard house with the red roof, the kotatsu, the cat tower EX, and the fat tan cushion that holds too cats but takes up only one space. Most of those cost gold sardines if I remember right, but seemed worth it to me in terms of investment.   .......  I made a post asking about the best gold sardine-yielding toys, and one of the commenters linked to their excellent pic of what toys worked best for them. I found that very helpful.   Here's the link: http://i.imgur.com/wwrgQ6H.jpg"
nekoatsume,3dcue0,perfect-parfait,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:05:59 2015 UTC,"I also notice that the yarn ball gets gold fish relatively frequently, along with the cardboard house. But I agree that the best ways to get gold are premium food (anything but the default) and maximizing cats."
nekoatsume,3dcue0,ilanarama,0,Wed Jul 15 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Ha ha ha.  The game encourages prioritization of savings and purchases, but it certainly also encourages OCD behavior.  I have to consciously stop myself from checking every 5 minutes.  ;-)"
nekoatsume,3dcue0,CrazyNekoObasan,6,Thu Jul 16 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"Although the toys you buy with gold fish definitely get better returns than the cheaper toys, there's no guarantee that you'll get more gold fish.  You are dealing with finicky cats, after all.  IMHO, I think when starting out, buying toys that attract more cats than the spot allows is more important.  For example, the Athletic Tower will take up 2 spots but can hold a maximum of 5 cats, thereby increasing your return on investment.  I think you're on the right track by prioritizing your savings for the expansion because, again, you're increasing the area where cats can congregate.  It's a great game since it encourages delayed gratification."
nekoatsume,3dcue0,CrazyNekoObasan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:22:14 2015 UTC,"The Athletic Tower is a special case, it can fit a lot of cats, AND it is the only item that will attract Yamaneko-san, the Mountain Cat. You should prioritize density of cats (like the Tower's 5 possible cats in a large item that would fit two items that attract only two cats). But attracting rare cats is a long term goal."
nekoatsume,3dcue0,nmrk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:39:18 2015 UTC,"I found that you get more sardines when putting gold sardine items, but the best way to have more golden sardines is to put sashimi food I think."
