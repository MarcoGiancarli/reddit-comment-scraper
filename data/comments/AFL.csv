At first I thought he was being a bit pessimistic but he raised some interesting points. Basically, he said due to the demand of AFL players today, their bodies wouldn't be up to the challenge of 400 games compared to the expectations required of players in his hay day.  It's weird to think that he may actually be the fourth and final player to reach the 400 club. :/  Here is the article for anyone who is interested: http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-07-20/boomer-says-400-milestone-wont-happen-again  Edit: Spelling."

Given how well we've recruited recently, if we can actually keep the players, that sets us up for a decade of getting not so smashed by the Suns.

AFL,3e27v8,TrjnRabbit,2,Tue Jul 21 12:06:28 2015 UTC,I don't think a pre first round pick is an option any more. More likely to be 20 I'd think.
AFL,3e27v8,lordofthedries,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia; the greatest source there is    Under current AFL rules, enacted from the 2012 season onwards, a club can receive a priority draft pick at the discretion of the AFL Commission. The Commission has flagged that a formula which will assist with determining whether or not a team receives a priority draft pick, and at which round in the draft that pick will be taken, is yet to be established, but that it will take into account quantitative measures, including a club’s premiership points over a period of years (with greater weight to recent seasons), its percentage over a period of years as another indication of on-field competitiveness (with greater weight to recent seasons), any finals appearances in recent seasons, any premierships in recent seasons and club injury rates in each relevant season.[1]   So you're probably right in saying they don't do pre pick 1 however given how much we've shit the bed lately you never know.   Something going against us is that we traded two high level picks and a young player for dank memes (D Beams)."
AFL,3e27v8,Jivlain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"I'd very much like that.  We've made finals once since the '04 Grand Final loss. That was in '09 before Voss went on his recruiting spree that caused some serious long term problems for our list. Since then, we've been consistently poor but have not been able to properly rebuild for a few reasons.  First of all, the expansion clubs. They got all of the prime picks from around that time and were sitting down the bottom of the ladder, giving no established clubs a chance at bottoming out and rebuilding.  Secondly, the go home factor. I've never understood it but it clearly exists.   Now we've hit this season and things were promising. People were expecting us to be knocking on the door of the top 8. We had a strong core group of players, kids who were developing nicely and had some games under their belt thanks to the on-going injuries to key players in the last few years and some great recruits during last year's trade period.  Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked when the injury problems kept popping up. On top of that, the game plan wasn't working quite right and our spine had more holes in it than the guy from Robocop (NSFW).  The Lions should be better than they are. Most of the problems the club suffers cannot be fixed with priority picks but it would help undo some of the damage we've suffered over the last 5+ years.   I can definitely see why we shouldn't get one. It'd still be nice to have."

AFL,3e0o23,Vinnie_Vegas,7,Tue Jul 21 04:22:34 2015 UTC,"That's a different argument and I think the jury is out anyway. Tippett is currently a uniquely high quality exponent of this role and there's basically no other market to compare him to.  What would Hale be worth if he was 5 years younger and kicked double the goals he does? What would Ryder be worth if he kicked double? Factoring in the extra value provided in drawing defenders and freeing up a midfield or utility spot? What will Dixon be offered as a far less proven but promising ruck fwd? The answer the admittedly thin market would appear to be giving us is ""about what Tippett is making"".  Besides, Tippett was brought in as a forward, could still be used as such, but the Swans have decided to use him this way instead."

AFL,3e0o23,4nyonbthhytnhklnr,5,Tue Jul 21 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"Roughead, but not this year. This year he's more of a rover-forward.   Ryder, but in shoddy form.   Kreuzer, patchy fitness (and in the most recent memorable year of his, was primarily a ruckman).   Clarke for Fremantle, up and down.   Sinclair for West Coast, similar, I think ultimately he's more of a forward. That's really in a world where Darling is elsewhere and he can somehow not get in Kennedy's way.   Jenkins is not a bad ruck when he gets a crack.   Brown of North Melbourne.   I think this is a specialist position that everyone in the league desperately wants. Everyone's first ruck needs a second fiddle (good enough to ruck if the first goes down), and a forward good enough to punish the '3rd tall' defender, and/or pull away the opposition first tall defenders or their ruckman from being a floating spare man.   This is like picking an allrounder in a cricket XI. If you get it right, it makes everything awesome. If you get it wrong, they're just a passenger.   Go on, find a 'best ever Australian XI' without Keith Miller."
AFL,3e0o23,Jawdan,4,Tue Jul 21 02:37:20 2015 UTC,I think Hawthorn get the balance from McEvoy and Hale really well now  Both are capable of doing at worst an average ruck job and can contribute up to 4-5 goals on top off their usual forward trio output

Scott Lycett is the other one who can do it, and NicNat could do it if he weren't being used predominantly in the ruck. 2013 model Tom Bellchambers and 2012 Jarryd Roughhead also figure in."
AFL,3e0o23,NonsenseIncoming,14,Tue Jul 21 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"Among us Crows supporters comparisons are constantly made between Tippett and Josh Jenkins for obvious, saline-induced reasons, and in recent times the consensus seems to be that Jenkins is narrowly better, or at least better value. The simple fact remains though that Tippett is, and probably always will be a better Ruckman than JJ. Which really opens up options for Sydney that the Crows don't have. Now I love Josh Jenkins, and to be honest I think he's a better kick than Tippett (have a look at some of his shots in the showdown then honestly tell me if Kurt could have made those) but we also have to look at some of his Ruck work in the showdown after Jacobs went down with an eye injury in the 4th quarter. He was beaten quite comprehensively, thankfully it didn't cost us the game as we were able to hold on, but it easily could have. Tippett's ability to Ruck competently really can't be overlooked and should absolutely be factored in when assessing him as a player. Does that make him worth $1m a season? You'd need to ask Sydney about that, but it looks to me like they're getting what they paid for. They just need him to sort out his injuries, if he can."
AFL,3e0o23,Codyfucksticks,4,Tue Jul 21 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"One other factor to consider is Pyke isn't a great ruckman and doesn't cost much. That sorta increases Tippett's value to us. Tippett is nominally the ""second"" ruck but with Pyke he's not notably worse and with Nankervis or Derickx he's probably more effective. (Although Nanka should come on nicely)"
AFL,3e0o23,bashfulfax,6,Tue Jul 21 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"He has been playing in the ruck a lot more this year where honestly I think he is wasted.  He is a great contested mark and kick for goal, which is shown when he has played as an outright forward in the last few seasons. The problem the Swans seem to have is they have too many big players and really lack mobility which showed on Saturday night."
AFL,3e0o23,Codyfucksticks,15,Tue Jul 21 03:02:27 2015 UTC,Kurt Tippet is the best statistically in an ineffectual dual-position role where his biggest competition is someone like Ryder. It's a jack of all trades master of none situation.  Average big forward+below average ruckman = worth 1 million a year?
AFL,3e0o23,NonsenseIncoming,7,Tue Jul 21 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"I'm still confident Ryder will be better value over the course of his contract than Tippett, albeit they play pretty different roles."
AFL,3e0o23,4nyonbthhytnhklnr,2,Tue Jul 21 02:03:12 2015 UTC,"Ryder is also a different player. Tippett is a short-leading, contested marking giant who isn't a bad ruck. Ryder is a kind of loping horizontal long leading aerobic half forward, or cheeky full forward, who is good enough to be first ruck. I think at his best Tippett is standing and fighting, bullying full backs while the high ball comes down to him, or going on short leads from the goal square. Ryder is basically far too good (and fit) as a leading CHF for most ruckmen to get near him, but I think most of the better CHB's read the ball better than him, and many are clever/strong enough to outbody him if he wants to stand and contest."
AFL,3e0o23,NonsenseIncoming,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:19 2015 UTC,"It's a different type of opportunity cost too. Port went all in with draft picks but probably isn't under cap pressure, Sydney just needed to manage the cap (until 2016) and didn't lose any draft resources."
AFL,3e0o23,4nyonbthhytnhklnr,2,Tue Jul 21 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah good point.  You have to weigh Tippett's effectiveness against Mumford and/or Malceski.  Harder to say for Port, but I think we'd love another first round midfielder developing in the SANFL because our fringe players have been uniformly pretty awful this year."
AFL,3e0o23,NonsenseIncoming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:35 2015 UTC,"You guys just need him to pretend he's playing Adelaide evry week. Seems to come out of his shell.  I think he'll come good in time, question will be about how much of a forward he is vs ruck."
AFL,3e0o23,NonsenseIncoming,7,Tue Jul 21 04:59:32 2015 UTC,"He was worth his contract when he was kicking 5-6 goals a game in 2013 when we first got him.   He's an elite big forward, not an average one. Now he's just in a situation where he's forced to ruck for 50% of the game and has to create space for Franklin.  Ruck-forward is hardly an ineffectual position role. Guys like Natainui, Ryder and Hale have excelled in those positions with BOG games."
AFL,3e0o23,4nyonbthhytnhklnr,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"He's an average big forward in output based on spending fairly limited gametime up there. When he spent all his time up there in the previous two years he averaged 2.65 goals per game which is pretty elite output.  And he's also an at-least average genuine ruckman for another big chunk of the game, where otherwise those ruck minutes would have to be filled by someone else. He's improved Sydney's hitout differentials back to 5th in the league feom 17th last year.   His level of forward effectiveness is -currently- pretty uniquely combined with ruck quality in one player, which frees up spots in the team for other purposes. And allows flexibility for him to either play more forward ir more ruck depending on injuries and matchups."
AFL,3e0o23,NonsenseIncoming,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:57 2015 UTC,"His goal output is always going to be inflated as he draws second best big defender almost 100% of the time. Clearly his inclusion makes Sydney's forward line hard to lineup against, but he woiuldn't fare anywhere near as well against elite defenders.   He's paid far too much money. I don't buy into the tradebait argument of late, but the idea of him deserving of one of the highest pay brackets in the league is laughable."
AFL,3e0o23,4nyonbthhytnhklnr,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:31 2015 UTC,"but he woiuldn't fare anywhere near as well against elite defenders.    That's just a lie, he was the pretty much the best forward in 2013 playing solo bar Cloke. That alone was proof he was worth a high pay-bracket   What's happened since then has been out of his hands, nothing revolves around him anymore, he's been forced to play a support role."
AFL,3e0o23,GoCrows,8,Tue Jul 21 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"a lie?  Ok, here's a prime example of stats out of context leading you down the garden path. He averaged 2.9 goals per game in 2013. must be great yeah? He only played 13 games for the season. 50% of his goals came from three big bags that year. two of which were against bottom of the ladder sides with no KPD while being fed by the league's best midfield.  Look behind the numbers, the sample size is nothing to draw any conclusion from. He's a handy forward, can cause some problems. Elite? LOL"

Sydney's mids have been at delivering the ball inside 50 well and the structure in the forward 50 is in a horrible place atm.

AFL,3e0o23,flap_jacket,5,Tue Jul 21 05:24:59 2015 UTC,"With Pyke injured/out of form, Nankervis and Naismith young, and Derrickx... Derrickx, Tippet's versatility has been really important. Yes, it's sacrificed his forward game, and no, on output alone he isn't justifying the price we paid, but having someone that can carry the ruck while we need it, then play as a genuine, permanent full forward when we don't, is pretty valuable.  And if we weren't burning the footy every time we went inside 50, his output would be a lot better."

Ball is a better shape, travels in the air better (Burley's tend to have the habit of soft footys of floating a little bit in the breeze), and I feel you can be more precise with a Sherrin than a Burley."

When people cry, they cry on average at a rate of 0.0012ml/min. Lets say that when you cry, you cry for on average of 4 minutes, making the average cry .0048ml worth or tears  .24ml per member / .0048ml = 200 crys.  If you said that Hawthorn supporters will cry with joy once per day, that is 200 days.  3 October 2015 + 200 days = 20 April 2016.  tl;dr - We will can cry with joy for the entire off season, collect our tears in the premiership cups, and it will only be about round 4 or 5 of the 2016 season before we run out of back to back to back premiership cups and realize you started the season without us."

AFL,3e1dmm,Bergasms,16,Tue Jul 21 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"Optimistic: Our poor performances are now good enough to beat sides. Our key players have all committed to good length contracts, meaning the cream is locked away for a while. The club itself is doing very well off field. Dimma is delivering constant improvement as a coach. Our playing group is just getting into the start of the age bracket where you tend to start going deep into september.

Wines: Port wouldn't do the trade because he is a future captain, loves the club, and (as much as KPFs are at a premium) is simply too important to our future.  Boak: I don't think you should ever trade a captain unless there are extreme (Griffen esque) circumstances.  I also don't think you should trade away an established player as good as Boak when your list should be in finals contention for a young key forward with half a good season on the board.    Gray: probably the most likely, but again, he is worth more to port than to Melbourne because of our respective stages of development.

Our team is one of the youngest in the comp with our two oldest players 2-3 years away from retiring and we are still performing at the top level. Bright future  Pessimistic:  Young squad also means inexperienced come finals time which will hamstring us. Hopefully the guys can use their experiences in 2011/12 to good use.  We still have goalkicking yips were we go quarters at a time without converting kicks into goals.  Our top 4 draft picks last year were all Victorian, I'm really hoping they begin to feel at home here and don't become the 'Victorian boys' of the club and feel isolated.

AFL,3e1dmm,Skwisgaars,4,Tue Jul 21 07:09:30 2015 UTC,"Optimism:  -Fantastic lot of rookies picked up this season in Saad, Glenn, Downie and Brooksby.  -Added experience and leadership experience for Tom Lynch  -Touk Miller has shown himself to be fantastic player that is very likely to be Gold Coast's captain after Lynch puts up the boots  -Gary Ablett's not dead yet  -Greater exposure of the list through injuries allows for greater training of depth players and allows delistables to be identified  -Our list will be cleansed of Josh Hall, Timmy Sumner, and Daniel Gorringe in one year.  Our reserves side won a game this year! Remember when the Gold Coast Reserves were winless for an entire freaking year? Well, we have won not one, but five games this year.  -The draw will be soft as butter in 2015.  Pessimism:  -The club culture is so damn bad. Oh God is it bad.  -Oh god the injuries. We'd be lucky if the players out for the season don't re-injure themselves in 2016. Now Swallow and Prestia are going to have the lingering threat of serious knee injuries to hang over them for the rest of their careers.  -O'Meara may never be the same again. His injury is super serious, and no player has ever bounced back from a ruptured patella tendon before.  -The jury is still out on Rodney Eade. Personally, I've actually liked what he's done and he's done a lot to expose exactly why McKenna was fired and trying to fix Bluey's mistakes. The man who is tasked with fixing our club culture is a man who's greatest flaw over his coaching career is being bad at matters of culture.  -Potentially no Charlie Dixon  -Our fitness is pretty garbage, even for our age range. Hopefully Justin Cordy can fix this and Rocket can take the gang to a military base over the preseason again.  -Malceski spudding it up for two more years and clogging the salary cap before he can leave, at which point we have to give this guy a coaching job as part of the contract.  -Our ruck situation isn't great. Smith hasn't developed well, and Nicholls will take a long time to develop  -We don't have much in the way of outside class apart from Gary Ablett. The midfield kicks worse than anyone else, and generally focuses on contested ball use, which leads to us being dead last for uncontested possessions.  -With Fish Matera's performances this year drawing parallels with a gutted barramundi bleeding out on a jetty, there is a hole in the small forward position. Perhaps Jarrod Garlett can fill this, but that would come at the cost of much-needed outside speed in the midfield.  -Rory Thompson may never live up to his 2013 form. In 2013, Thompson was a fast and tall defender that was considered the Suns' best player outside of Gary Ablett and finished fourth in the club champion award. Then he injured his hip and hasn't been the same since. His speed is gone, and may never come back.  That's all I can think of, but undoubtedly there are more that I haven't thought of."
AFL,3e1dmm,Statisticc,3,Tue Jul 21 11:43:21 2015 UTC,"Solid core group with a number of them re-signing recently with the opvious notable exception.  Looks like we're around the mark but from an optimistic standpoint, SLoane has played very little and B.Crouch not at all this year. The inclusion of both of those fulltime adds significant depth to our mid, along with a hopeful return to form from Smith who has been disappointing since his concussions.  Lever appears to be developing nicely and I think the his combination with talia is going to be frustrating forwards for many years to come.  Forward line will hopefully start to gel a little more. Walker and Betts are legit stars, and Knight has had a great start to his career and hopefully plays out the rest of the year.  As far as the negatives. Firstly, the Dangerfield situation. This will be resolved one way or another. the club will just have to move on or on the flipside be able to put all the gossip to bed for good.  The most pertinent concern, Head Coach. Way too early to know what will pan out here. Campo might get it, maybe Worsfold will be convinced or could just be someone external out of left field. Can only hope that the new coach gels with the playing side and offground staff as well as Walshy clearly did in such a short space of time."
AFL,3e1dmm,aditrs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:02:00 2015 UTC,"I think Adelaide have dealt with injuries very well this year and the depth is increasing.

AFL,3e1dmm,JawsIsReal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:36 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd post it here, as opposed to make yet another thread. Bickley just confirmed on the radio that Dangerfield has NOT signed a contract and is still undecided.  I think he's gone. The message has changed dramatically over the last 12 months. It used to be that he was weighing club success and that would be his defining criteria. As it's become more and more apparent that Geelong are ending an era and going to need to rebuild, that comment has disappeared from the Dangerfield camp. All about weighing up his love for AFC and desire to be with his family.  See ya Danger, I reckon"
AFL,3e1dmm,raynosity,3,Tue Jul 21 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"Optimistic: Got a few years left with a relatively a grade team (key defenders not withstanding, although we have some young guns waiting).  Also our development of young talent and forgotten players has been lauded for a while now.   We're pretty well suited for immediate success and covered ourselves so we should still be top 8 contenders once we really start to rebuild.  Pessimistic: No really strong replacement for Pyke and Richards, however we have some good talent in the neafl that could be great for us in a few years, although if those few years miss what's left of buddy's prime we may miss our chance to be as dominant as everybody though we would be after we got buddy."

AFL,3e1dmm,bitchdantkillmyvibe,3,Tue Jul 21 08:56:05 2015 UTC,"The Good:   A midfield that bats deep and is getting deeper - we have Fyfe, Mundy, Hill, Neale and Barlow at the top, then Pearces C and D, Mzungu, Suban, de Boer, Sheridan and Crozier, to be joined soon by newbies Weller, Blakely and Langdon who have been super consistent in their first year at Peel.  Sandilands is  signed on for two more seasons and isn't getting any shorter, while Griffin playing well and contracted also for the next two buys a bit more time for Clarke to improve (though I'd say he was close to where we need him to be at the start of the year). Alex Pearce, who answers the question 'who will take over when McPharlin goes?'. Ross has talked about him possibly being used up forward and in the ruck in the future, and while we shouldn't speculate too much on these things, it'll be good to finally have some new key position flexibility.   The Bad:   Young KPF's still have big question marks over their heads and 24-26 year-old KPF's from other clubs don't seem to want to come live in Perth and wear purple. We're also probably one quality KPD short to be sustainable. I know they're working very hard on this, but we do need to find a way to consistently score 100+. This is the 2nd year Ross has tweaked his game plan to achieve this, and he's had some success early in the season, but until I see it I'm afraid I can't believe it. We've shown we'll be fine without McPharlin and can score without Pav, but without Sandilands we're pretty screwed. Clarke still goes missing far too often to take over first ruck duties and only has a couple of years to do so."

I don't think Amon, Ah Chee or Neade will ever be premiership level players; No young key forwards with runs on the board; Off field - the excitement around the club in 2013-14 was so much that it will be hard to maintain that momentum - the media and AFL fans will be quick to turn negative if it doesn't look like the club is moving in the right direction."
AFL,3e1dmm,alittlebitfancy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:33:24 2015 UTC,"On your last point - I kinda hope they do. That's always what's helped spur Port on in the past, being the underdogs, having no one believe in them and having to fight against the odds. They started this season the media darlings and as a guaranteed top four team, and I think it was something none of the team were used to and really fucked with them mentally. The media and AFL fans turning on us again will probably provide some familiarity, lol, and most importantly, take some of the pressure to perform off of us."

Outside of his own form, the team has clearly struggled to develop a new structure that gets the best out of him - Lobbe in particular is in awful form at the moment.

We did reasonably well with Fremantle the previous week and we haven't got truly thrashed since the Sydney game.

AFL,3dzpqv,yeahnahteambalance,33,Mon Jul 20 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"My local amateur football club has been struggling for some time now; a small club in a saturated market we are located between three A grade clubs who we lose players to regularly. Last year we struggled for numbers and drive and coaches all year, and we only won two games for the year. We were relegated but were saved because the team just above us folded, keeping us in the league.  In the off season we hired a former AFL listed player and A grade coach to coach us through the next three years. He brought down players, personell, and a toughness which would hopefully see us through the season.  The start of the season was great with a life member of the club coming down and coaching ressies and helping us through a tough time.  With that being said it was still a tough time. League were losing close ones and only managing to win at home, but for pure football purposes it was a great step up from the year before.  Injuries came at the worst time. We lost our club captain, our CHF, a FF, and a whole bunch of our best kicks. Ressies boys were upgraded and it depleted the ressies squad.  It got so bad that some of the guns the league coach brought to the club pissed off back to Lake Grace. Our reserves coach had all but given up with only one win to his name. He wondered why his short kick to down the flanks plan did not work in C3 reserves footy.  It all came to a head with a trip up to the Swan Valley last week. The reserves had 14 players; playing in the forward line we had six inside 50s for 3/4s. Every time I fought and brought the ball to ground but numbers won out and they rebounded.  I begged the coach to put me down back to give the defence a rest; they were broken men. Covering my man down there you'd look up and see 3 or 4 loose green shirts in their forward 50. It was a slaughter and we lost by 200 points.  League were not doing much better, and from a good start to the year now the talk is about relegation.  On Thursday our reserves coach left without warning. He handed the whiteboard to my best mate and pissed off.  When Saturday came round I was so incredibly angry. We were playing a team that smashed us earlier in the season, that were a bunch of dirty pricks and I was angry for the boys that our coach had left is behind.  The talk was of the new coach and his game plan. It wasn't fancy, it was to isolate the former WAFL colts player up forward and let him kick a bag. Kick long, not short, and use the guts, not the wing.  We flew out of the gates, with a quick clearance that went to our FF, he protected the ball drop with his body and took a one handed grab to put us ahead. get around him  I had made the conscious effort to be all voice all day. I am not a great player by any means, but I could be a voice, that's something everyone has and it's something the team had struggles with.  We are down by a goal at quarter time but there is something electric in this group, something that I have never seen before. Boys were buying in, boys were grubbing jumpers, and everyone was grinning.  A contest up ahead of me, I lost the ball in the air and I lumber forward to make up space; I am not a quick man but I have gained a few knots now and I make the decision to split the pack. I completely run over the ball and look like an idiot, but there is a whistle: ""FREE KICK, 60!"" Everyone looks stunned, including me as I remember that's my number, ""YES 60!""  50 out on an angle I forget the team thing, fuck it, I'm going goals. I slot these in training after all.   It leaves my boot, the torp that doesn't spin, laces pointing at the sun, it drops suddenly Ping gathers and spins, he handballs into traffic where Belly snaps and goals.  We are down by ten at the break. I'm the rooms we are bouyed y the fact that we couldn't get the ball out of our defence for 10 mins, but only had one kicked on us.  Same gameplan, just need to give full a 20 mins, our talk is disappearing late in quarters.  The ball flys inside 50, top of the square, I've lose my man, lolwut. Pinga flies and I stay down knowing how good he is in the air. The ball comes to ground and I'm screaming, ""Hands, HANDS, PING, PING, HANDS!"" The rest is a blur but I've somehow kicked my first goal in footy and have acted like a right goose, I let my opponent know about it and basked in the glory when he got dragged to the bench.  They are getting shitty now, they gift is a goal with a 50; they are more interested in fighting and arguing than playing.  Down by ten at 3/4 time out heads have never been higher. I should probably spend some time talking about our FF, he's kicked 5 already and some of them are gems. Playing Pagan's paddock he's monstered his man all day, and kicked a goal from over his shoulder on the goal line. He sucks down a dart at the break.  It's a shoot out in the last, but we kicked the first three and have the advantage. We concede a cheap goal to bring us behind once more and I'm giving it the big Allan Jeans trying to rev up the midfield group. I look like the biggest tool, but I don't mind.   We get a 50 from the middle for a deliberate trip, and another for mouthing off. We have a free goal, and we are milking the clock. We make sure the ball is put onto the road, and our appointed boundary rider casually jogs after the ball.  Our coach is bellowing now, ""SAM, GAV, BACK! THIRTY SECONDS!!""  We aren't needed as the midfield group lock it down until the siren sounds. I am almost crying it was such a huge win, these guys put 30 goals on us last time. Our coach is sprinting to the middle with his whiteboard trailing behind him like a kite, and I've been drenched in beers when we've sung the song. I've never heard a louder team song.  League lost, but who gives a fuck?"

They didn't and yelled at each other jokingly while lifting weights, really loud. Not properly either. I found it really rude and absolutely infuriating. The space is there for other people to work out in, respect that space and the people who choose to work out. If you're going to have a conversation, there's three, four, five... Like ten other spaces for you to do that. Leave the gym and fuck around somewhere else.  I was livid. I don't get livid and I didn't feel I should be at that time because it is a public space, but its like; if I was someone else in that res gymnasium that asked the same thing they would; because they don't respect me for whatever reason they basically thought I was being a right cunt. If it happens again I'm going to snap. And its not gonna be pretty.   Ellen Pao was on their side the entire time, by the way. That's fucking hilarious.   I'm sick of being poor."
