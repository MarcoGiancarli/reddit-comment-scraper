One is indeed elitist and isolationist but they are absolutely tiny and not even TB listens to them - once again because they are tiny. You can see this by comparing the number of views TB's videos have vs crazy TB fans (oddly enough, TB's fringe is smaller than most other fandoms, maybe because ""crazies"" prefer shorter videos?).  The 2nd fanbase is absolutely enormous and it's just normal people who don't care about being in TB fanbase - they just watch his videos because they are good videos. I think most of these people really respect that TB gives very clear and logical explanations for what he says in his reviews.     As to TB being 'deeply beholden' to anyone. That's pretty funny considering he shits on every game that he thinks deserves to be shat on.

ShitGhaziSays,3dt3cq,Dwavenhobble,2,Mon Jul 20 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"Crash course.  Ghazi was founded by a number of SJW types from other subs coming together so the SRS network and I believe a few from anarchism and Atheismplus.   In the early days many anti GG people were mods including Zoe and Alex Lifschitz. Many were also mods in the IRC chat where they used their actual names.   Ghazi most likely was made as a way to have an anti GG subreddit and hold onto gamergate as a subreddit by having it link through.  In the early days many anti GG people would post there including Wu.  From their own chatroom many seem to be in highschool and be quite serious outcasts because they were weird beyond simply being a bit quirky and cool, plus very interested in social justice. I remember somewhere here I posted a capture from their IRC about someone wanting to wear skirts like the other girls and so realising they'd have to shave their legs. The dilemma brought up was that shaving them would be against feminist principals because it would be conforming and supporting a society that shames natural hair growth on a woman. Ghazi came up with a compromise. Take pictures of her hairy legs and then make a skirt out of said pictures to wear......... I wish I were joking as this was praised as a good workable answer.  Over it's history Ghazi has managed to go after a number of people to an extent that they've had to show up on Ghazi to essentially talk them down from their mouth foaming mob level. Examples include Miracle of Sound, Nerd Cubed and Peanut Butter Gamer. Most likely half the reason this TB is evil thing has gone this far is that TB refused to engage with the idiots thus making them feel less important.  It's my speculation that a great number of Ghazi are still undergoing psychological development through the stage where illusory superiority is common, or the stage often talked of as ""they are on stage with the whole world watching"". This would actually be fitting if as what I saw suggests most are still in highschool.  One of the last and oddly still most regular posters is Kim Crawley a journalist who wrote a huge hitpiece against Gamergate that was rife with errors (Far more and far worse than most other hit pieces). She got called into the managers office and fired for the piece because of fears over advertisers. Kim claimed GG had contacted advertisers and put pressure on. The reality was there had been no GG email campaign against her publication because it was quite a small one. It's speculated the real reason she was fired was her piece was an example of horrible journalism on a site which really seemed to have some ok or even good journalism on it's other articles. Kim claimed GG forced her out cause she was female and then set up a patreon asking for help to make rent.  The biggest turning point really was when Kathrine Cross (PhD candidate, researcher and Feminist Frequency Treasurer ) said there needed to be a stand against Toxic Activism citing Ghazi as just such a place. This sent Ghazi into a weird confused position which was further compounded when Ghazi targeted Wu after she and Brad Wardell had coffee together. This prompted Wu to claim Ghazi was just such a Toxic activism place.  These events prompted a change in Ghazi where they cherry picked less low rated comments from GG to claim represented all GG and shifted more to talking about general social justice topics in generalised geek culture. Ghazi also changed their subreddit to seem less like it was made by a bunch of Highschool outcasts but outcasts who worshipped he cool kids like their entourage. Before this change Ghazi had Saint Anita up and stuff about Anita and Josh Prom King and Queen of our hearts, or some such crap.  Sine the new Ghazi trying to appease people they idolised oddly the people haven't come back. Kim Crawley is still about sometimes and I believe Randi is still in the IRC quite regularly but that's mostly it. Arthur Chu did his ""I'm done with reddit"" post there after months of nothing.   More recently Wu upset them by calling Ghazi out over going dark and supporting the reddit revolt to out Ellen Pao. This didn't go down well as Ghazi can't handle criticism themselves (despite claiming GG are the ones who are trying to defend gaming from criticism) so Ghazi mass downvoted Wu and either they removed her as a mod or she left of her own accord.  In it's time (before it changed styles) Ghazi was visited by Admin twice the first time to make them aware of brigading allegations against them, the second time to tell them in no uncertain terms if evidence of them mass brigading kept showing up they'd be banned. This lead to the NP / archived post rule on Ghazi. According to someone I've been in contact with in the past. Ghazi have been mass spamming the admin with reports to try and have KIA shut down, if what I hear is right many of the admin are rather tired of them."

When people started buying into corporate buzzwords hook line and sinker.  Not to sound like an old man but back in my day we could careless about the framerate of something. Hell I don't know how many times you'd get an NES slowing down on you.  Really I just find this whole framerate thing insane. I could careless what the framerate is I want to know about the gameplay.   First of all, framerate affects gameplay. It turns out that seeing twice as many frames per second makes things smoother and you can react better. I remember I had to lower the resolution of Doom because in fullscreen it was unplayable with how choppy it looked.   Second of all, NES games ran at 60 fps. Sure they they slowed down when there were too many objects on screen, but it's been 30 years, games should improve, not go backwards.   And last, the corporate buzzword is resolution. AAA developers prefer the resolution war because it looks prettier on screenshots. It's the consumer who is pushing for better framerate because they are sacrificing it in favor of resolution. The buzzword hook line and sinker is ""30 fps is better because it looks more cinematic""."
ShitGhaziSays,3djtkv,henrykazuka,4,Thu Jul 16 23:12:57 2015 UTC,That 'corporate buzzword' line killed me.

Please note that the following are just my opinion and I don't want to speak for either side. Just want to give my perspective.    KIA does that too - e.g. adopting the sealion   Adopting a sealion was an example of embracing a joke in my opinion. No one in GG did it to make any sort of point. It was just the GG way of acknowledging a joke made against us, and embracing it.    using SJ lingo (e.g. arguing that Tim Schafer was ""erasing minorities"" when joking about NotYourShield at GDC).   I think his mocking of #Notyourshield was indicative of the SJW opinion that they speak for everyone of the category they associate with, whether women, transgender, ethnic minority, etc. There are people in those categories that disagree with the SJW movement.    The claim is unsubstantiated.    (talking about my claim that ghazi's aren't gamers)  There are gamers in the Ghazi movement. But I think evidence indicates that gamers are more pro GG than anti. And more aGG are non-gamers, than pro GG are non gamers.    Many games fail, despite having appeal.   It just seems, quite a few games that cater solely to the SJW crowd have failed recently.

It's not massive, but it's not insignificant either.   Again, this is just my opinion, but the ""GamerGate recommends"" is kinda terrible. Totalbiscuit has been firmly proGG, and he is no. 1 curator by a long way. I know that isn't definitive, but it is at the very least somewhat indicative of how hardcore gamers swing, in my opinion.    Almost all of GG are gamers, but some very prominent figures of it (Milo, CH Sommers) aren't, oddly enough.   There are prominent members of both sides who have capitalised on the money available from the controversy.   Whether GG wants to admit it or not, I firmly believe it had been equally about censorship as ethics in games journalism, from the start. The explosion point was the /r/gaming thread that was nuked. I also think aGG seems to be as pro-censorship as GG is anti-censorship. And neither side seems to care how far that goes. Neither side is perfect.

Another thing kinda related to the 'who is and isn't a gamer' discussion. I always hear it said that gamergate is set to make sure that 'gaming remains a boys club'. I'm willing to say ghazi isn't gamers because I've been gaming since the 90s and women gamers have always been common. The only ones I saw claim differently in game were kids and idiots. How are we trying to keep something a boys club when it hasn't been for at least 2 decades that I can personally attest to? So either you're ignorant of how it actually is, or dishonest.

ShitGhaziSays,3d333a,YM_Industries,6,Mon Jul 13 04:30:30 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite example was when they linked to a post in the ""satire"" category, with ""satire"" in the URL, tagged as ""satire"", and with several people talking about how it was satire in the comments . . . but apparently weren't sure if it was satire or not."
ShitGhaziSays,3d333a,ZorbaTHut,5,Mon Jul 13 08:25:44 2015 UTC,"That feeling when you see a ghazi post and you have no idea if they are just joking or if they are in fact actually that stupid.     Satire would require them to have a sense of humor and some perspective.     It's not just the mod, although [-2], there's at least 1 other person who thinks that it's real survey - https://archive.is/WWMix"
ShitGhaziSays,3d333a,princess_y_fronts,3,Mon Jul 13 06:04:26 2015 UTC,It's an open online survey promoted in a place that would give us the results we wanted.  Of course we're serious.
ShitGhaziSays,3d333a,SpawnPointGuard,2,Mon Jul 13 21:28:44 2015 UTC,I think it's interesting that the results weren't too strange for them to immediately realize it's satire (since the satire tags apparently weren't enough).

They're not the first to call it the daily heil, they're not the last, and it's far from only an anti-GG thing - I'm very pro-gamergate and have used the term."

ShitGhaziSays,3d1lnk,AntonioOfVenice,7,Sun Jul 12 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"That whole thread is amazing.  I love how they always go on about people falsely saying they want to limit free speech (or ""freeze peach"" as they hilariously call it) when it's clear that's exactly what they want to do.  And of course the one guy who thinks this is a bad idea, he's the fanatic.  Amazing."
ShitGhaziSays,3d1lnk,DepravedMutant,3,Sun Jul 12 20:00:42 2015 UTC,/u/EvanHarper is a massive fanatic for daring to point out that not having free speech allows suppression of ideas like Russia on LGBT.
ShitGhaziSays,3d1lnk,Okymyo,3,Mon Jul 13 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"TIL they deleted my follow up where I said J.S. Mill defended my ""fanaticism"" well enough and I'm not itching to debate the point with ""some edgelord Internet communist.""  Seriously, the prevalence of ultra-leftism on Ghazi skews that whole place's perspective sometimes. I'm not sure what the relationship is supposed to be between ""don't harass women on the internet"" and ""communism totally works guys"" but it's worrisome.  I can't post here without noting that y'all are gross reactionary nerds, though. So there's that.  Edit: Oh, and I forgot to mention, so many people on that sub have some idiotic superiority complex about perceived ""European"" values and will start lecturing you about being a know-nothing American when you oppose censorship. Here's a fun one for you (don't post in there shitlords! mods dislike me enough already!)"
ShitGhaziSays,3d1lnk,EvanHarper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:53:29 2015 UTC,"(You put an extra d in that link, by the way, ""redddit"")  Because what you have around Ghazi aren't people with the ""don't harass people on the internet"" ideology, but rather people with rather skewed and specific views on the world. As I see it, quite a few would fall under the ""tumblr feminist"" stereotype, and that encompasses way more than just ""don't harass women"" (because Ghazi in general is okay with doxxing provided it's against Gamergate or Harper's debt collectors, which says a lot in my opinion).  And on philosophy:  I never read anything about Stuart Mill on free speech, but having read some of what he said on utilitarianism, wouldn't it be a bit contradictory? If the masses were ""okay"" with the censorship (neo-nazi, for example), wouldn't the benefits of the many outweigh the losses for the few? On the other hand, if it were government censorship, then it'd be the benefits for the few outweighing those for the masses, meaning it'd be against utilitarianism. Meaning censorship would be partially compatible.  How does he mix his views on utilitarianism with those on free speech? They seem partially contradictory, unless you bring in something like how knowledge is always good, even if of negative ideas, meaning that censorship even when done against the few would have a negative outcome for the masses."
ShitGhaziSays,3d1lnk,Okymyo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't see how they were justified in deleting that, even by their own rules.  What I love is the idea that the government is run by evil capitalists who despise women and minorities and also, could we maybe give these people the power to decide what can and cannot be said?  In what possible scenario does that play out well for anyone?"
ShitGhaziSays,3d1lnk,DepravedMutant,3,Mon Jul 13 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like, here in Canada we have a constant campaign to menace pro-Palestinian activists with ""hate crimes"" charges, and the national government gives it at least rhetorical support, and yet one of the guys leading the charge himself once went on a blistering televised racist rant against ""gypsies"" and prosecutors wouldn't touch it.  Or you have the even more egregious cases where German police have gone after antifa on the grounds that crossed-out swasitkas, or drawings of swastikas being dumped into garbage cans, are Nazi symbols subject to prosecution.  Only the little guys will ever get hate-speech prosecuted."
