DCcomics,3dysuc,12Minus6_Cloud,184,Mon Jul 20 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"There are some great quotes in there:  ""He's not Superman because he has the power to take over the world. He's Superman because he won't."""
DCcomics,3dysuc,Crash_Recovery,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Idk man that kind of logic is like, he's such a great guy because he doesn't beat the shit out of me. Like I totally agree it's a big deal to have all that power and not use it for malicious purposes but I don't clap and thank my father for not hitting me when he's angry, it's just assumed."

DCcomics,3dysuc,PhantomMs1,9,Mon Jul 20 20:37:43 2015 UTC,"Let me just put it this way. Picture for instance there are 3 different Clark Kents that discovered their powers. One Clark Kent goes out and conquers the world. One Clark Kent sits at home and neither conquers the world nor saves it's people. The third Clark Kent is the Superman we know and love that goes out does good for the world. The quote says what makes superman superman is that he doesn't take over the world. That would mean that we still consider the Clark Kent that sits on his couch all day and never uses his powers as ""Superman"" because he didn't go out and conquer the world. I think what makes Superman Superman is more than that. Not taking over the planet is a shining example of his character but it isn't what makes him have a big heart. That comes from his desire and will to save the planet and it's people over and over and over again. That is what I believe makes him Superman."
DCcomics,3dysuc,Cragnog,28,Mon Jul 20 20:59:25 2015 UTC,"The context of the quote is that he is choosing to help, and the manner in which he does so. He could achieve better results by taking over the world and forcing people to be good since that's easily within his ability, but instead he elects to lead by example because he greatly values the concept of free will.  It's also a line towards Lex's mentality, that there's this big strong alien who deigns to walk amongst the mortals. One of the overarching clashes of ideologies between the two is that Superman sees the people of Earth as equals and Lex sees the unattainable epitome of the ubermensch."
DCcomics,3dysuc,Helmet_Icicle,5,Mon Jul 20 21:31:42 2015 UTC,I think the entire passage implies that our Superman is who he is because he doesn't impose his will on us AND because he helps. The line that you're debating is a nice piece of rhetoric but it isn't the thesis of the passage.
DCcomics,3dysuc,undercarriageaciddip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:14 2015 UTC,I understand that it isn't assumed and I am grateful that I grew up in a house without that sort of abuse but I cannot agree with thanking someone for NOT abusing me. Abuse is incredibly harmful and comes in a lot of different forms. The idea of what makes a good person is really abstract and subjective but I would say at least that because someone isn't hurting someone else this doesn't make them good I think that would make them neutral but I'm not sure what steps after this would take them from being a neutral person to a good person.
DCcomics,3dysuc,Cragnog,5,Mon Jul 20 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"If you had the power to change the world, even if it would ultimately be for the greater good, would you do it? He could force peace on earth and eliminate all those who'd do harm on others but he understands that's not how it works. He knows we need to figure it out for ourselves. He'll intervene in a crisis or if a super villain comes around but he won't force humanity to change even if he'd be completely justified to do so."
DCcomics,3dysuc,dylanbob5,96,Mon Jul 20 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"I see the quote being more about the ""power"" and not about the ""take over the world"" part.  He's not Superman because he has great power, it's what he chooses to do (or not do) with it that makes him admirable."
DCcomics,3dysuc,slowphoton,63,Tue Jul 21 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"I like to think that even if Clark Kent had been born a regular guy he still would have found a way to become a hero - a doctor, a cop, a firefighter.  It is not the powers that make him a hero, it is his heart."
DCcomics,3dysuc,shadowman99,20,Mon Jul 20 19:06:25 2015 UTC,The real heroes are Jonathan and Martha Kent. Clark has a good heart but Ma and Pa Kent really saw to it that the good in him always won.
DCcomics,3dysuc,dangerwolf1,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"That's the interpretation I've always had. With some exceptions, Jonathan and Martha are the ones who give Clark his sense of right and wrong, they're the ones who instill in him a moral compass of sorts.  Deep down he really is just a good natured farm boy from Kansas.    I believe that he was always going to be a hero, but it's not because of his powers.  It's because of Jonathan and Martha Kent."
DCcomics,3dysuc,tunnel-snakes-rule,16,Mon Jul 20 22:59:00 2015 UTC,Until the shift to horrible parenting in MoS and the upcoming BvS. It rankles me that the writers of those movies got Clark's parents ass-backwards in their beliefs and moral stances.
DCcomics,3dysuc,MrStealYourDanish,21,Mon Jul 20 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge comic book reader, can you give me an example of how their morals are backwards? The only thing I can think of is Mrs. Kent's line in the BvS trailer: ""You don't owe this world a thing"" speech. In MoS they seemed like good people."
DCcomics,3dysuc,Venexus,4,Tue Jul 21 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"Even the ""You don't owe this world a thing."" line to me isn't even that bad.  People seem to completely forget that she prefaces that sentence by telling him to be their hero, their monument etc. She's incredibly proud of him.  But she's also trying to take pressure off of him, because he's her son. Also because he literally saved the entire human population in the first film. All 7+ billion people in the world would not be alive without him, so she wants him to know he's already done more than enough, especially when he spent his youth getting bullied and picked on for essentially being a pacifist."
DCcomics,3dysuc,whatudontlikefalafel,2,Tue Jul 21 07:35:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like her entire exchange ""people hate what they don't understand... you don't owe these people anything"" is a dig at people like me who didn't care for Man of Steel.  Like it's suggesting that the only possible reason people could dislike it was because they don't understand it.  It's such an arrogant assumption, but it's entirely possible I'm reading too much into it.  Onto your question, in Man of Steel Jonathan and Martha spend the whole film telling Clark to hide his powers, basically to be ashamed of who he is, to stay in the superhero closet.  Arguably they're doing it because ""the world isn't ready"" but they should be instilling Clark with the desire to use his powers for good, not to be scared of them.  When a scared kid asked you whether you should have saved a bus full of kids the correct answer is not ""I don't know, maybe.""  Then there's the whole tornado thing.  I think we can chalk this up to dodgy writing but really, Clark could have prevented Jonathan's death, instead he watches him die. Clark let his own father die because he didn't want to risk people seeing him use his powers.  I found that very jarring.  Like I mention below, Jonathan's death is supposed to teach Clark a lesson that even though he has the powers of a God there are certain things he can't do.  There are limits to his powers. It's a humbling lesson and an important one for his character.  In Man of Steel it seems like it's all about hiding his powers or not bothering to use them for good. I understand in this particular universe Clark's desire to be a hero has basically be hard coded into his DNA, but by doing that they're taking away the most important aspects of Jonathan and Martha.  Now they're just scared, weak humans.  I don't know if I'd say their morals are backwards, but they certainly don't exist as a means of giving Clark a moral centre.  You can't argue that he's a hero because of them.  He's a hero despite them."
DCcomics,3dysuc,tunnel-snakes-rule,6,Tue Jul 21 02:58:37 2015 UTC,"In MoS young Clark asks Kevin Costner whether or not he should have let the children on the school bus drown. Costner replies ""maybe"". That's pretty shitty.  Later, when Clark's dad commits suicide by tornado, he waves his son off so that he can die...in full view of his family, doubtless to compound the horror. People argue that Clark couldn't possibly have saved his father and not revealed that he is proto-Superman. To which I answer: Superboy.  There might be more, but these scenes stood out the most to me. Any child raised/ reared by parents with such attitudes would have probably grown up to be a psychopath, much less the greatest of all superheroes.  In the comics and in the Christopher Reeves movies, Ma and Pa Kent are portrayed as stolid working-class farmers with a ""must do all we can to help"" attitude. THEY are the reason that the Man of Tomorrow is a paragon of virtue and heroism as an adult."
DCcomics,3dysuc,MrStealYourDanish,5,Tue Jul 21 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"That tornado scene always irked the hell out of me. Know how it would have really worked out?  Clark runs into the storm, grabs his dad, hunkers down to wait out the wind, and then stands and says ""Holy crap, we got lucky! Because people surviving tornadoes is totally not unheard of!"" It's not like anyone would have been able to actually see Clark fighting off the wind in all that, y'know, wind."
DCcomics,3dysuc,BattleStag17,11,Tue Jul 21 01:56:49 2015 UTC,Then Clark finds out his dad was unlucky and get struck by a piece of wood or something.
DCcomics,3dysuc,HassanJamal,3,Tue Jul 21 02:19:46 2015 UTC,"That's the thing that irks me most about that whole scene.  Traditionally Jonathan's death (by heart attack) is supposed to teach Clark that even though he has the powers of a God, there are simply some things he cannot stop.  It's a really important lesson and helps ground him as a person.  I'm still not entirely sure what the lesson is in Man of Steel, and the fact that I'm not at all sure either means I'm stupid or the film makers failed in delivering that message.  Edit: To the guys downvoting me, if you could let me know why that'd be great.  If my point's wrong or invalid, let me know....  Of course now I'm in positives, so I sound like a maniac ranting about downvotes that don't exist.  Ah well."
DCcomics,3dysuc,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:01 2015 UTC,"Seems more like it failed, like really badly. I think they were going for something similar to that heart attack you mentioned, Clark cant save everyone lesson, but Zack/the writer/WB exec probably decided to go for more of an actiony way of showing that message instead of a simple plain old heart attack."
DCcomics,3dysuc,HassanJamal,34,Tue Jul 21 03:12:02 2015 UTC,"I once met a guy who woke up one morning to find his bed across the street because there was a tornado that night and he hadn't even woken up. His brothers were both hospitalized. Jon and Clark surviving a tornado is totally viable, and despite any other complaints I might have about it, How Man of Steel Should Have Ended hit the nail on the head with ""Clark, go get your father; he's being an idiot"".  The other thing that really bothers me about that scene is that hiding under a highway overpass is a terrible idea, you should throw yourself into a ditch and hope for the best, not throw yourself into an impending wind tunnel and hope for the best.  I mean, man. I liked Man of Steel overall, but that scene was just not very smart."
DCcomics,3dysuc,Adekis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"Until the shift to horrible everything in MoS and BvS... did Clark smile once in the trailer for BvS? The answer is no. It really just looks like Sad & Angry V Sadder & Angrier. Like, I understand there's some bad shit going on but that's not a justification. If anything, that should make him fight that much harder to keep a reassuring smile and thay sense of ""hey...everything is going to be fine.""  Yawn.  I want the real Superman going up against this Batman. FYI, Batfleck is fine. That looks and feels like Batman. But he should be going up against basically his opposite. Not a really sad alien."
DCcomics,3dysuc,thehypotheticalnerd,12,Tue Jul 21 05:03:01 2015 UTC,"The answer is no. It really just looks like Sad & Angry V Sadder & Angrier   Holy crap it's 6 minutes total of footage between the two trailers with barely any Superman (he was only in the first trailer for like 5 seconds during the ""Do you bleed?"" scene) out of whats probably going to be a 3 hour long film. And out of those 6 minutes, Superman is in it for like 45 seconds, and his face is hardly visible during any of it. But do you know what we do see during that time? Him being Clark at the Daily Planet. Him visiting his mother in Kansas. Him saving people. Him inspiring people.   But god forbid he's not smiling."

DCcomics,3dysuc,shadowman99,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, we don't think in those terms regarding journalists. Look at House of Cards, where the journalists are impotent douchebags because they adhere to old ways of doing things in a world where it doesn't work. Look at Netflix's DareDevil, where even heroic journalists are impotent because they can't report on actual news because they're scrambling to keep up with the same new media beating them to a pulp in House of Cards. It's not the same perspective, but it reveals the same truth: journalism is either sensationalist crap, it's manipulated by powerful people for their own corrupt ends, or it's powerless. That's how we see journalism these days.  That corrupt or weak figure is not the kind of journalist Siegel had in mind when he wrote Superman's secret identity as a reporter, nor is it the kind Lois Lane and Clark Kent are meant to be. I almost find myself thinking that like Sherlock Holmes fighting Nazis, those two are going to find themselves in a world they don't fit in, until slowly, Superman begins to find himself increasingly set in the twentieth century where he began.  Of course, writers are also doing their best to keep Kent's journalism relevant, investigative and heroic, but when he's already turned to a failed blogging venture and Lois Lane became the head of a televised news station, well. I'm not sure how much longer the Planet can hold out."

DCcomics,3dysuc,BilbroDimebaggins,30,Mon Jul 20 17:54:51 2015 UTC,"People seem to look at Superman nowadays as being too obvious and just a big blue boyscout. That's what he wants people to think. On the inside he's flawed, conflicted, and isolated. He's much deeper than people give him credit for. Batman may let his problems haunt and define him, Superman leads by example and knows he has to be the better man."
DCcomics,3dysuc,dylanbob5,19,Mon Jul 20 21:52:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not like he's a paragon of virtue and is never tempted to use his powers for the wrong reasons or for his own benefit. He conquers those urges and most people never see his internal struggles, but that doesn't mean that they don't exist.   Plus, there are times when he's brutally reminded that for all his powers, there are still jobs that are too big for one man, super or otherwise. There's a collection with art by Alex Ross that has a bunch of vignettes for DC's biggest heroes and the Superman one has always resonated with me as it shows him understanding that it's his power to inspire others that truly makes him a hero. One man hitting stuff really hard is great when you need someone to kick giant space monster ass, but problems like world hunger, disease, and war are just too big for anyone to handle alone. But together, we stand a chance and that's what Superman is about, inspiring others to be more than they thought they could and come together to truly solve the world's problems."

It's missing the forest for the trees when you're at a distance, same as happens with Captain America usually.

While I was saying things like, Batman is a sociopath, he does hold his fellow man in high regard but he'll always push the limits that Superman wouldn't. I mean the guy enlists 9 year old ""Soldiers"" to beat the fuck outta grown men.  Superman represents every single person that in one point in their life felt like they wore a face, or had a different persona. Someone who felt alienated from a group because they felt different. It doesn't matter what the reasoning was, if you picked up a book and saw the way Lex treated Supes, you might be able to relate it to a situation in your life so easily.  Granted, right now he's SuperJerk, and we haven't seen the old Clark in a while IMO. I'd love to see the bond of friendship form between him in Bats in BvS."
DCcomics,3dysuc,bobby_corwin,3,Tue Jul 21 06:14:04 2015 UTC,This is also a good summary about Superman by Max Landis. People find him to be a bit douchey but he's always spot-on in his analysis of the character.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw_GlYve_Lg
DCcomics,3dysuc,Yabba_Dabba_Doofus,7,Mon Jul 20 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"I think he was right about a lot of things, but I think his main argument, that Superman v. Zod should have taken place elsewhere, misses some of the story telling aspects of the movie itself.    There's no denying that destroying Metropolis has some far reaching consequences, w/r/t SvB: DoJ, that he wouldn't have known about when filming this, but he also ignores the fact that Zod was planning to raze Metropolis to start New Krypton.  Even if Superman takes Zod away from there, the damage was already done.  The city is well and truly destroyed after Zod sets his plan in motion; Superman just doesn't do anything to try and stop the bleeding, because he's battling the virus instead of the symptoms.  This is also the reason, in my opinion, that killing Zod was the only logical conclusion for the movie to reach.  There just hasn't been enough world-building done to effectively convince an audience that ""Hey, he could have just kept Zod in some sort of jail, instead of killing him.""  People don't want to see Superman kill, because it goes against the tenets, not only of Superman himself, but of superheroes in general, in an extremely drastic way.  But this movie called for that digression.  We're watching Superman be born here.  Young, a bit reckless, completely new, not only to the extent of his powers, but how common people will come to rely on them.  That fear for his power is multiplied simply because of who he is and what he can do.  People watch Zod destroy the city, then they watch Superman kill Zod.  That instills a fear of Superman in people, because how do you stop someone who can, not only kill someone who can destroy a city, but can destroy a city himself?    All of that was a long rant to basically say, I think Max Landis is right, regarding the big picture, but I think using Man of Steel as an example is a poor choice, because it ignores certain aspects of the story that are necessary to build and shape the character into who we know he is."
DCcomics,3dysuc,bobby_corwin,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree about Zod. It wasn't like Superman didn't try and take the fight elsewhere. He flew them up to space and Zod brought them right back down. He made it very clear that he wanted to kill everything Superman ever loved so logically he kept the fight in a populated area. People have to keep in mind that Zod is highly trained and Clark isn't. Zod knows how to hit where it hurts and Clark doesn't necessarily have the skill to stop him. Made a lot of sense to me how that all went down.   But yeah, I like how Landis can explain Superman so plainly. He's writing a mini-series for DC that I think comes out later this year. Can't wait!"
DCcomics,3dysuc,theserpentsmiles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"When someone comes from a major city's suburb and they move far away they typically just say they are from that major city. And it makes sense, because they  might as well be. That same sort of generalization kind of happens with Superman. Anyone not near his power level is kind of the same. And he values Nightwing, or Robin, or any ""peak human"" so why would he not value a normal human?    Either way, pretty cool."

DCcomics,3dysuc,infamous-spaceman,3,Mon Jul 20 17:58:20 2015 UTC,I think he was the first character we really think of as a Superhero. The shadow shares more with the pulp-crime genre than the Superhero genre.

DCcomics,3dysuc,kingzilch,4,Mon Jul 20 21:01:59 2015 UTC,"Zorro also started in pulp novels.  That's part of the difference, that before comic books existed (or at least before they became popular), those types of stories were mostly told in prose form, in cheaply-published magazines or novels.    There is a lot of overlap there, especially when you look at how Doc Savage hung out in his ""Fortress Of Solitude,"" or how The Shadow's love interest was named Margo Lane."

But Superman codified the idea. It's only in looking backwards that we see that archetype was pre-existent. Superman was the one who brought it together as a distinct concept."
DCcomics,3dysuc,kingzilch,3,Mon Jul 20 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"I guess that's as good a definition as any, at least at the start of the genre.  Comic book superheroes were kind of an evolution from pulp magazine heroes."

DCcomics,3dysuc,Ugly_Muse,-6,Tue Jul 21 09:41:12 2015 UTC,"I don't like the bit about Batman and the mask.  Batman has to wear a mask because he's not a ""God"" and he wants to protect those around him. It's also a symbol for the everyman that can take a stand without recognition. Yes he has money, which helps loads, but the point remains. It's not to protect himself in any way (though it can, literally). And Kal also pretends to be Clark, so what the hell?  I also have an issue with Superman's powers. He's Cartman from South Park when they did the fun with weapons episode. ""I am Bullrog and I have lots and lots of powers."" Superman doesn't have a power that can save him or the people around him? Time to give Superman that power.  Having said all that, I generally like Superman. I just don't get why people always compare him to Batman when they're two different people (one of which a God, for all intents and purposes) working different angles. You shouldn't justify your character by comparing them to another.  EDIT: You downvote it even says, ""This is NOT a disagree button. Only downvote if off-topic or does not contribute to discussion."" My comment fell under neither of those categories. This is how conversation dies and you end up surrounded with only people who agree with you."

It usually has little to do with the actual story.  Hal being dumb is actually mostly out-of-context panels from the last twenty or so issues of Gardner Fox's run on Green Lantern in the 60's. He had a tendency to reuse the plot point of Hal being mind-controlled or influenced by outside forces. One issue had a guy whose willpower was so strong he could use Hal's ring just by being in the same general area as him. This was when Green Lanterns were significantly more powerful and could do things like pass through walls, read minds and memories, and teleport people between planets, so it was probably an attempt to make the Lanterns more vulnerable so they didn't have to constantly rely on yellow objects to make threats."

DCcomics,3dz48c,MrManicMarty,6,Mon Jul 20 22:45:48 2015 UTC,Without seeing the comic in question I'd assume it's out of context and he's being affected by some outside force.
DCcomics,3dz48c,Aleator77,3,Tue Jul 21 03:53:03 2015 UTC,"Comics in that time were meant to have a lot of humor alongside the action. For example, a good percentage of Silver Age Superman and Flash books end with the hero looking at the ""camera"", saying a pun, and winking. Just because they were light-hearted doesn't mean they were bad though. A lot of the stories from the Silver Age are actually really great. The Flash show on CW draws heavily from Flash's Silver Age roots."
DCcomics,3dz48c,EricandtheLegion,4,Tue Jul 21 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"Fair enough then, didn't think they were bad or anything (They did sell well enough to last 60+ fucking years, JESUS CHRIST!)"

DCcomics,3dzugt,vivvav,29,Tue Jul 21 15:54:43 2015 UTC,I'd say it has a decent chance since Geoff likes the character and he's had quite a hand in shaping the tv show

DCcomics,3dzugt,TheGreenSpeedster,14,Tue Jul 21 03:06:26 2015 UTC,Don't blame the movies. There's absolutely no way Arrow or Flash could do the effects for GL.
DCcomics,3dzugt,Jangwin,6,Mon Jul 20 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"They could manage a low-key, DCAU-style GL for an episode or two, probably. There's just no way they could do him as his own show."
DCcomics,3dzugt,AWorldW-OShrimp,13,Tue Jul 21 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to be GL though, we could just get good ol' Hal"
DCcomics,3dzugt,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Mon Jul 20 22:06:44 2015 UTC,"Hal, according to some easter eggs on The Flash, has been missing. so he probsbly is a GL already"
DCcomics,3dzugt,LolliManLetsPlays,10,Mon Jul 20 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is the only way to do this wold be use him in the Flashbacks and say he was the pilot that Oliver to pilot a plane. In the present according to The Flash it seems like Hal is already on Oa and has the ring, so if he appears then it would seem weird if they acknowledged that he became a Green Lantern."
DCcomics,3dzugt,noxnsol,3,Tue Jul 21 01:39:56 2015 UTC,I feel like introducing Hal but never having him be GL would be worse than not having him on the show at all.
DCcomics,3dzugt,Capn_C,16,Mon Jul 20 22:33:28 2015 UTC,I disagree. We'd still get to see his interaction with Ollie and Barry which would be the most interesting part of him being on either show
DCcomics,3dzugt,TheMurderCapitalist,7,Mon Jul 20 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the untapped potential would ruin it for me. Every time he'd appear on screen I'd ponder over how much better his interactions could be if he was a hero as well."
DCcomics,3dzugt,Capn_C,6,Mon Jul 20 22:46:59 2015 UTC,Have you been watching Flash?
DCcomics,3dzugt,YoureASoldierBodie,2,Mon Jul 20 22:12:38 2015 UTC,"The special effects required for Barry's powers are nothing compared to what is needed to do the ring constructs. The CW has a relatively low budget, and although Barry's powers generally look fine, the effects can be quite bad at times, like with Golden Glider's and Captain Cold's guns or Firestorm's fire. (To me, anyway. I don't know how much other people notice it.)"
DCcomics,3dzugt,Jangwin,3,Mon Jul 20 23:03:45 2015 UTC,"Producers and showrunners tend to use a lot of misdirection, so there is still a chance of a Hal Jordan appearance in season 4, especially since Supergirl, another Guggenheim show, is actively acknowledging Superman, on the other hand season there could just be a bunch more easter eggs"

DCcomics,3dzugt,Exile28,3,Tue Jul 21 00:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but WB/DC are the stupidest when it comes to what characters they are allowed & not allowed to use in their show.  They made them write-off Deadshot, Waller, the SC and ARGUS from Arrow because of the upcoming movie for no good reason other than their usual ""it's too confusing for the audience"" excuse. What are they planning to do once the JL movie is coming out? cancel the Flash?  As for Supergirl, they're acknowledging him (and even showing his back), but this is just to give some background, it's a safe bet that we'll never actually see Superman in it.  They teased Coast City a lot this season (and even acknowledged Hal's existence when they talked about the Ferris pilot that disappeared), but there was a lot of references to Blüdhaven during the first two seasons of Arrow, and it never led to anything either."
DCcomics,3dzugt,WormholeMaster,3,Mon Jul 20 22:06:27 2015 UTC,Blüdhaven was referenced in season 3 too.

DCcomics,3dzugt,zamrya,2,Tue Jul 21 09:20:58 2015 UTC,Did he? I was really hoping they would tie the upcoming Titans show to Arrow/Flash and have Roy be part of the Titans. Its just a stupid dream but it would be awesome to have Arsenal and Nightwing in Titans.
DCcomics,3dzugt,danjr321,3,Tue Jul 21 15:26:54 2015 UTC,I mean can't they just use Hal Jordan in name and not have him as Green Lantern? Kinda like Flashpoint where he was just a pilot.
