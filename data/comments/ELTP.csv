ELTP,3ddyc2,Mpuddi,6,Wed Jul 15 18:33:21 2015 UTC,It is. The error was that tags had negative instead of positive weight. So in the first stats you were rewarded for you shitty tagpro collecting skills (and consequent few tags). :P
ELTP,3ddyc2,Mpuddi,3,Wed Jul 15 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"I knew it! So this is all a conspiracy trying to stop me from getting good stats by preventing me from getting tagpro's. This evidently shows a fatal flaw in the way stats are currently collected and I hereby demand that a new stat be introduced in place of ""tags without returns per 10 minutes"" and that it shall show ""tags without returns per tagpro"" this would obviously be a much better stat which will demonstrate what sets apart the good tagpro usages from the great tagpro usages and therefore ultimately what sets apart the good tagpro players from the great tagpro players as how you use your tagpro defines how good you are as a player which is why the tagpro game is named after the tagpro powerup.   I obviously say all that in jest but I'm kinda curious as to what the tags without returns per tagpro stats look like lol."

ELTP,3da8g8,Rojas101,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"This is great stuff, far more digestible than the gasp stats for me!  I was wondering, is there a way to statistically look at which partnerships are most effective, at both ends of the field? I guess you just add up the two players scores?  Also, I was wondering what would be your take on this.  I'm pegged at as prevent defender in the stats [i love that you can identify playstyles in the stats!] and i see how that would appear. Yet I would say I am all about letting enemies grab, and containing whilst my partner gets the return, does that make any sense? So as a partnership the majority of our play is grab defence."
ELTP,3da8g8,Rojas101,2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks. ""Pair stats"" is certainly a very interesting idea, I might play around with it."
ELTP,3da8g8,Rojas101,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:56:15 2015 UTC,"Oh there was something else I thought of, that i wanted to run by you.  So defenders have prevent and returns, right?  But offensive defence [a terrible term that needs renaming] is only measured in returns.  There is no current measure of someones ""offense prevent"" [Thats what im calling it until someone gets a better name for it.] Could there be?   like time spent in proximity to enemy flag whilst your own flag is out of base?  Coz at the moment since offence prevent isnt measured it just looks like the o is being lazy [stats wise] when infact they are being responsible as the last line of defence. See what i mean?"
ELTP,3da8g8,Kiekebanus,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"Take a look at a timeline for any of the games at tagpro.eu - that's my input. So the thing that I can measure is the opposing team's prevent but that, of course, is not player specific.   Another thing, is that actually a useful measure? It tells us that you were standing close to the enemy flag, and if you weren't chasing, that's of course what you were doing (apart from some special circumstances). So, what would the measure actually tell you?"
ELTP,3da8g8,bsa86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"fair enough, just an idea.  In terms of what it shows, it would differentiate between who is actively playing prevent offence, and who is simply incompetent at getting successful grabs when their own flag is home. no worries tho, your current work is great :)"
ELTP,3da8g8,Kiekebanus,2,Wed Jul 15 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"For that purpose, we can calculate the number of successful grabs in the time your flag is in base. That's a good idea, thanks."
ELTP,3da8g8,randomj1234,2,Wed Jul 15 21:15:48 2015 UTC,What about a stat for returns that result in a cap within a certain amount of seconds?
ELTP,3da8g8,nextwargames,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"Great idea, I'll add that. How many seconds do you suggest?"
ELTP,3da8g8,JBaayBaay,2,Wed Jul 15 14:55:09 2015 UTC,"My personal suggestion would be ~3 seconds, but in a similar vein (and you may already have this) but prevent that results in a cap would be a useful stat to track."
ELTP,3da8g8,nextwargames,2,Wed Jul 15 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"Another good idea. Perhaps again three seconds, so that we don't count too much of a regular prevent. Actually, we could also turn this around into an attacking stat as well: number of ""unchallenged caps"" - where no prevent was needed in the seconds before the cap."
ELTP,3da8g8,gnais,2,Wed Jul 15 21:01:24 2015 UTC,I would say like 3-5 seconds. Wouldn't go higher than that.

ELTP,3d6fpd,Balka42,11,Mon Jul 13 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"I would like to report a bug to Lucky in which I appear to be getting a significantly lower probability of getting the Tagpro powerup compared to the Juke Juice or Rolling Bomb powerup. I believe this bug can be seen in the ""Support W1-W4"" tab in which it can be seen that I have the second highest Rolling Bombs per 10 minutes at 2.51 per 10 minutes and am first in the Juke Juices per 10 minutes also at 2.51 per 10 minutes. However, I am 41st in the Tagpros per 10 minutes at 1.09 per 10 minutes. Clearly there is some sort of malfunction here or some bribes have gone on. Either way I would appreciate it if the Tagpro developers could look into this dire matter and hopefully have it resolved in the coming weeks.   On a more serious tone, thanks for the interesting stats. I don't tend to read too much into stats, and I don't think 4 weeks is a long enough time to be able to take much away from it so I'll find it more interesting at the end of the season, but it's still fun to look at and desperately search if I'm first in anything. I'm still sad about the fact that I've gotten so few tagpros compared to the other pups though :( I'm gonna blame anything that goes wrong for me on that from now on."

This shouldn't be in a preview or review at all, that's way too uncalled for.   If anyone legit thinks that they can just do the fucking stats themselves."
ELTP,3d1vze,notasgoodasyoudthink,9,Mon Jul 13 05:42:55 2015 UTC,"He's clearly kidding, everyone knows how much work you do with stats. If all the previews are super serious then it makes them incredibly stale."
ELTP,3d1vze,Sunny2323,-2,Mon Jul 13 13:04:15 2015 UTC,There's a difference between being super serious and insulting someone though.
ELTP,3d1vze,notasgoodasyoudthink,4,Mon Jul 13 13:35:50 2015 UTC,"I dont think he's insulting you at all. He's not saying anything about you or your character, it's literally just a comment about the fact you do all the stats."

ELTP,3d1vze,Sunny2323,4,Mon Jul 13 14:24:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should have my input in this.  I stand by gnais. He's a fantastic contributor to ETPN and highly reliable. I think he's right to take a less serious approach to previews, like he said, they'd get stale.  I don't think anyone seriously doubts how much work you put in, hence why gnais assumed it was ok to joke about. It isn't a straight up insult, it's a joke about something you're known for. Similar to how Panda said that I wouldn't be reliable this season as I'd be busy writing how much ETPN I'd done. Of course he's not serious.  You say it's invalidating your efforts, but isn't that exactly what you're doing to gnais' efforts and I'd say mine as well. Gnais has volunteered his own time and effort to put together half of the minors preview this week. Before this season we didn't even have minors previews and yet this season we've been pretty consistent with getting out decent previews.   You can't please everyone, but, personally, as head of ETPN, I stand by gnais as one of my most valued and best writers. I'm sorry you got offended, but honestly, that's on you, not us."

It was intended for a light chuckle and then would probably be forgotten by the end of the post. I know you've got offended but you really have misread it. It's a joke, no one questions your effort or that you fully deserved your gasp that week.

ELTP,3d1vze,Sunny2323,3,Mon Jul 13 14:17:41 2015 UTC,"I get where your coming from, but I don't think the comments here are helpful at all. You or Gnais could have said ""Sorry, it was a joke, I didn't think you'd take it in this way, no offence meant"". Instead, there's several paragraphs and a bullet-pointed list here saying ""just get over it"", which doesn't make anything better.  If you're making a joke at someone's expense and they don't find it funny, that's not to be received well. That happens sometimes with that kind of humour, but now you guys are overreacting as well."

I might sound harsh, but I am in the exact position you were when you wrote it. The fact you can think I am serious about this really bothers me. A lot. Just few reminders :      This post. Could I fucking make it more clear in any way ? We are both involved a lot in the comunity. I know what it means to produce content every week. I know you do it for free. I know you don't do it to show you are better than anyone, but because you want to make ELTP a better place. I've never said anything bad at you, and I never complained about the GASP, I even offered you my help to run it ! How could you think I am complaining about the way you run the GASP ? I try to make previews a bit funnnier than just saying ""their O is experienced, its good on this map, but they are facing a very talented team, blablablabla"" This would be boring. This is my way to do it. Now, if anyone feels offended about anything I wrote : don't. SARCASM, S-A-R-C-A-S-M. if you think it has anything to do with jealousy : it doesnt. I don't care at all about my personal GASP (ex : I am missing 2 caps in last week which basically killed my stats, I never complained).Also, I am the first one to joke about myself for being bad. Just read the next two words in that preview : ""Reality now"". It means it wasn't real, get it ?   I hope I am stupid and don't get the humor in your post, leading to my overreaction. I really hope it's just that."

In essence, each player starts in his own cluster and the number of clusters is then being reduced until only one cluster remains.

There are different measures of distance you can use, for instance simple Euclidean distance."

(d/dz) (z-1) = 1. The constant function d(z)=1 evaluates to one, so the value of the second integral is 1/1 = 1. That tells me 0+1 = 1 is the sum of the two contour integrals.

With RBC's captain orb reportedly disappearing from both mumble and reddit, his team may be lacking the organisation it needs to start putting points on the board. Holdham Capletic have had a slow start to the season, however with neb returning imperious may look to rotate his O partner, whilst on defence he continues to divide minutes evenly between 3 very capable players. On the defensive GeoKoala, Rolling BC may have the edge on imperious' offence as veteran offensive player FLICK YOLI returns, however RBC currently have the least successful offence in the league. Expect a low scoring game.

This is a good standard of evidence to use if you have the power to:  Issue warrants  Compel testimony  Seize property and records    You do not have this power, nor should you. Beyond a reasonable doubt is a standard to be used when an authority seeks to take away a guaranteed right. Playing organized Tagpro in a league is not a right, it's a privilege, and can be revoked by the authorities that administer the league.    Preponderance of evidence:   A requirement that more then 50% of the evidence points to something. This is the burden of proof in a civil trial. For example: At the end of civil case A v. B, 51% of the evidence favors A. Thus, A has a preponderance of the evidence, A has met their burden of proof, and A will win the case.   Without the tools to investigate accusations with some basis in fact you have to make a judgement call with the information you have. You've been entrusted by the players to run a fun and fair league, and cheating scripts run afoul of the fairness.   I'd encourage you to continue the investigation, gets all the info you can, the vote as a group with 51% being the standard of proof required.

ELTP,3cfys3,imperious-,5,Wed Jul 8 17:52:28 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to see this at the end of the season, it's too early to draw the conclusion in your title. I think the current trend is because 2/3 maps played were velocity and wormy, IMO the two maps for which pups matter least. Two reasons: it's quite easy to grab / escape / cap on both those maps without pups. Also, both maps usually have huge amounts of hold time, and if both flags are out pup effectiveness is diminished (e.g. from our games there were so many times when either team had multiple tagpros but couldn't work a cap due to flags just staying out). With geo/monarch/smirk etc in the mix I think we'll see a more expected trend"
ELTP,3cfys3,kutrebar,2,Wed Jul 8 14:00:25 2015 UTC,"Hrm, while is true that there's a lot of holding, a tagpro in wormy is a killer being such a small map and being so easy to clear the entire base with it"

ELTP,3ccptu,ZumgApanda,2,Tue Jul 7 00:26:30 2015 UTC,I am really enjoying the reaction/discussion threads that MLTP is putting up after each week and think that would be a great addition to this sub without cluttering the sub with too much stuff.

The only replays you see here are from good players juking/nubstepping other good players, often in matchs. Or big mistakes from good players. For exemple, the only clip available in th sub right now is the one from Berlin_ball, and it's a good clip. This is the kind of stuff I want to see. I also agree on the discussion thread."
ELTP,3ccptu,ZumgApanda,2,Tue Jul 7 07:45:01 2015 UTC,I actually like it this way. We have lots of hype pre-season (you're welcome lads) but I like the sub to be clean for information and what not in the season. Just how I like it though.

ELTP,3c8jfy,Sir_Grapefruit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:35:48 2015 UTC,Does that mean that the majors teams are not going to play on the Round 1 map at all (Command Center)?
ELTP,3c8jfy,Sir_Grapefruit,2,Sun Jul 5 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"Yes it does mean that, there's no other way to do it really"

ELTP,3c5tr6,Baka-san,4,Sun Jul 5 10:21:07 2015 UTC,If this gif wasn't so low fps you could probably relate as to why I thought he was trying to snipe me and why I thought hiding just below the spikes was best to delay for a few more seconds but alas the mindgames are too stronk :P  Edit: Wtf double post. Weird mobile reddit website..

ELTP,3c5tue,L__McL,3,Sun Jul 5 02:33:10 2015 UTC,Sweet write up again! Cool seeing reviews of my own matches. Worth the wait!   And you have nothing to be sorry for. These write ups are top notch and done voluntarily! I'm not sure how you find the time.
ELTP,3c5tue,BlueHobo,2,Sun Jul 5 12:41:28 2015 UTC,with everyone's favourite dolphin scoring the first cap of the game in less than 30 seconds.  MVB: Ballkenende. His performance in the first half set FKP up for victory early on. Eeeeee.   Atypop pls
