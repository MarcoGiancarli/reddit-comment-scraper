farming,3e1qja,Commando_Joe,9,Tue Jul 21 07:49:36 2015 UTC,"Skip the goats. A dozen chickens will lay ~10 eggs a day, you can sell the surplus to neighbors to pay their feed bill. It takes a considerable number of layers to make a profit when you account for personal consumption and feeding them to laying age.  Goats are terrible. Do a set of 25 cornish broilers every spring and you'll have a years worth of poultry in the freezer.  Buy a quarter share of beef for the freezer while you're at it, much cheaper than grocery store and again not something you can make profitable at your scale. Raise 2 feeder pigs a year, you'll eat half of one, you can sell the other 3 halves for a profit, this one is scalable because pigs are great composers, they reach market weight quickly during the warm season, and pigs like companionship, so 2 is better than 1. Goats are the worst Plant veggies but don't plant anything that grows in abundance around you. My area is famous for corn and apples, by shopping seasonally and preserving I can get these items much cheaper than growing them. Greens and cherry tomatoes are a good start, squash is easy and versatile, and anything that spoils is chicken/hog feed. For proteins don't forget rabbits and tilapia, both have excellent feed conversions, and take up very little space. If you want to be a farmer, get a job on a farm and make sure it's what you want. If you're in it for the food, join a CSA, and get a chest freezer for your bulk meat purchases. Learn to can basic things, and enjoy your summer."

farming,3e1qja,masseyfarmer8690,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:22 2015 UTC,Why are goats bad?
farming,3e1qja,unoriginalusername10,10,Tue Jul 21 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"They're a pain in the ass. They are escape artists, they smell (a buck during breeding season pisses on his head to attract the does), they get into everything, they're actually picky eaters (they just like to taste stuff like hair, shoe laces and hoodie strings), they're nosy as all get out, they scream (they sound just like a terrified woman) and never shut up. They can also get bored, so you have to have things for them to play with or else you're going to have issues.  You can't breed polled goats together, so you either have horned goats which can be dangerous, or worry about dehorning and all the different methods to do so. A horned goat usually knows how to use the horns, and they can gouge, flip, bash and smash against any person or other goat.   Buck kids are also fertile after 3 months, so you have to have space to keep them separate once they're weaned or else invest in some way of sterilizing them like a Burdizzo or what we call little green cheerios (which is just an elastic around the part which cuts off circulation and the part you don't want falls off.) My parents use the cheerios to tail dock lambs, but you can use them to castrate buck kids as well. We call them cheerios cause the rings are the same size as cheerios.   If you don't remove the bucks, you're going to end up kidding (when the babies are born, I'm not just trying to be funny) in the middle of winter. A goat kid is ~7lbs. when its born. So in the dead of a Quebec winter, you're going to get hypothermic kids, and frost bitten ears and teats on the Momma's. Plus, goats are multiparous which adds extra work during a time when snow and ice already add extra work. And if the goat kids don't get up quick enough and find milk, the Momma gets bored and goes and finds something to eat. Plus, you don't want to freeze your ass off outside anymore then you have to. And goat kids in the house are cute. Until they start pissing everywhere and climbing on you and your furniture, which is about 5 minutes after they get warm.   I like cows. Can you tell?!"
farming,3e1qja,mybestfriendisacow,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"You're totally wrong about the goats. My girlfriend's mother has three and they are BY NO MEANS a hassle. They're very well-behaved and although curious, they aren't trouble. Any animal can be an ""escape artist"" if they want it badly enough. A goat I like a less-intelligent dog. I think the problem people have is they want the animals (like goats) but don't want to spend time bonding with them. My girl's mom is out there every night for a few hours just spending time. I mean hell, people have tropical birds as pets. Basically, any animal is a problem if you just keep them in a pen. You just have to put time into them."
farming,3e1qja,iCuntUnderstandYou,2,Wed Jul 22 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"My parents have on average 125 sheep, 15 beef cows, and 150 goats on farm right now. They started with one lamb and one goat kid twenty years ago. My Mom spends on average 3 hours per set of chores, twice daily. The actual time spent working is half that. That time can be extended to all day when she's got babies hitting the ground. She'll sit in the pens and let the sheep and goats crawl all over her. She watches them for illness, issues and cause she loves them. She keeps her goats as pets, the sheep as the money makers and the cows to have beef in her and her children's (me and my sibilings) freezers. My Mom has also watched a buck run around and around his pen, and it was able to garner enough speed to run across and up the walls and out over the 6 foot walls (not fence) that made his pen.   I've worked with one goat in a pen and up to 125 goats in one barn. We've had 8 goat kids in the house at one point in January, two winters ago to prevent hypothermia in -40C weather. I've seen goat kids wandering around with inch long ears cause the rest got frost bitten hard enough they fell off, not cause they were the Lamancha breed. I've been sitting in the house 400 yards away from the barn and heard a doe scream while in labour and though a woman was dying up at the barn. I've been chewed on, climbed on, run over, run into, and bitten by goats. I've watched a buck piss on his head during breeding season and then try to stick his head through the fence to get a pet. We had three buck kids in a barn with about 50 head of sheep a few years back. The three kids got out every day without fail, regardless of shutting the gate or not behind you. None of the sheep in that barn ever did. I've never had the same amount of frustrations with cows or even sheep as I have with goats. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been pissed at a cow (twice being kicked, once being stepped on hard enough to make me cry, that's it.)   Also, bonding with animals when you have such a large number can be bad. It means that you're not going to cull them when its appropriate, so you'll waste more money, feed and time on them. Then when they do leave, it hurts so damn much. Its often easier to not bond past a certain extent cause they won't actually be around all that long. Every farmer has their favourite animal(s) though, but mostly its about production, like ""She throws awesome calves/kids/lambs every spring, but she looks like a wreck!"" or ""She dropped 42 kilos of milk this morning."""

They eat anything close enough for them to reach or get to once they get out (mine were escape artists.) They have to be fed twice a day and not too much at a time because they won't stop. If you want milk they have to be milked everyday to keep them from going dry and while the milk is good it takes work to get a goat to sit still and you don't get much milk. Other than that they are cute, intelligent, and so fun to watch play together. Still not ever getting another goat. Chickens are WAY easier and I feel like I get way more out of it for what I put in compared to the goats."

Depending on what the farm is like, I would recommend leasing at least the lands and spend a few seasons as an apprentice on a well run farm, ask a lot of questions, learn what you can. When you feel like you are ready you will also have the added money from the lease to invest back into the farm."

If he is already farming, get his input to what you are trying to do from a business perspective. During that conversation if it can fit in naturally then I would bring up the idea you have for that piece of property.   Here is the thing he may give you some insight during the first or second conversation. If that piece of land comes up in the conversation lay out your plan. You may find that you can steer toward the I need more land, you need.........That is what you have to find out. Maybe he wants a new tractor and you can buy that land he is not using and he can put that money toward the tractor.   Two key points: There is a history - make sure he understands that will not be repeated.

Not sure they'd be able to but something to check on just to be sure and give ease of mind
farming,3dshdz,KosherNazi,5,Sun Jul 19 00:52:55 2015 UTC,"Hey OP.  Dirt contractor here.    Other posters here have given good enough advice.  I will describe our process for clearing and grubbing from a professional standpoint.    It sounds like you have some fairly sizable trees and stumps you are dealing with.  Whatever you do, do not start sawing trees down and leaving the stumps.  This only makes it more difficult for the real problem solver (a guy in a cat) to do his job.  When there is a full tree, an operator can use the leverage of the tree itself to push the stump out.  Stumps by themselves are a pain and take extra time to remove.  Don't even give that stump grinder a thought.  This deal is out of his league.  I would highly recommend looking for a professional contractor with late model machinery that has experience in land development.  What they will want to do is bring in an excavator (324E ex.) for digging out the stumps and carrying the trees to the pile, and a cat of some kind, in our case we use a 963C for cleanup and extra muscle.  You can expect to spend somewhere between four and five thousand dollars a day with this kind of setup.  If possible to dig a hole, I would recommend digging a few so you could carry the trees to them and in a few months (or a year)  you could proceed burning the pile.  This helps to not have a messy spot littered with sticks and other leftover debris from the pile.  We develop acres and acres like this, most of which is farmed.  I know it is a lot of money, but from the sounds of it you're missing out on some valuable acres and in a few years the cost of the project will have been recouped by adding value to your land and the extra grazing you will gain.  Id be happy to answer any other questions you might have, good luck."
farming,3dshdz,jozzie2000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"Wow.  How much land can that setup clear in a day?  The woodland is a big mix of trees, most between 30-40 years old, although there are a few old timers mixed in, probably 80-100 years.  Some wet areas, lots of rock.  I don't think $5k/day would ever be affordable for them, especially since they aren't actually putting the land into production.  I appreciate the insight into how the pros do it, though!"
farming,3dshdz,jozzie2000,5,Sun Jul 19 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"How much land can that setup clear in a day?   It depends.  Like I said, depending on how many stumps there are, how far the trees need to be carried, how dense the trees are.  Two guys that know what they are doing can get a lot done in a day.   The woodland is a big mix of trees, most between 30-40 years old, although there are a few old timers mixed in, probably 80-100 years. Some wet areas, lots of rock.  I don't think $5k/day would ever be affordable for them,  they aren't actually putting the land into production.   Well, obvious game changer here.  You're going to just have to decide what kind of a job you want to do.  Putting myself in that position, I make it a 5 year project.  Find a local guy with a backhoe that could come out for a day every year until it is done.  Don't get out your chain saws and start cutting and end up with a half assed project.  It's easy for me to sit here on the internet, having dozers and backhoes at my disposal, not having to write the check, to tell you how you need to do it.  It's just that  I've just seen guys tie into things and end up with deals that aren't very good because they bit off more than they could chew, and ended up spending more money to fix it in the end than what it would have initially cost to do it right to begin with.    Call around, get some estimates.  Talking doesn't cost you anything."
farming,3dshdz,ba55fr33k,2,Sun Jul 19 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"excavator is the way to go. a good operator can get a lot done in a day, they usually cost about 100$ an hour around here so im not sure where 5grand comes from, maybe for a team. anyway if they have a truck ready to haul away stumps as the excavater digs em out the land will get clear fast  i really cant imagine the backbreaking labour our grandparents went through to clear land..utmost respect but im.glad we have machines now"
farming,3dshdz,cattle_man,2,Sun Jul 19 20:07:04 2015 UTC,Its actually easier if the trees are really old (>50 years or so) to just do most of the work with a big dozer(125-150 Hp at least). Trying to cut all the trees and then grind out stumps is much more work than just dozing it. Soil quality won't be great since you'll displace a lot of topsoil in the process but New England soil should be deep enough that you'll be fine in the long run. Hope that helps.
farming,3dshdz,Canadairy,2,Sun Jul 19 03:43:42 2015 UTC,"Excavator to knock it back, dig out stumps, and bury anything you don't want. Bulldozer to level. Sprinkle some pasture mix on so it's not all weeds. Rotary mower will keep things cut down. You might see if anyone has tractor mounted hedge trimmer (not sure what they're called exactly). Around here they use them to keep trees from encroaching on the side roads."
farming,3dshdz,bruceki,3,Sun Jul 19 03:40:51 2015 UTC,"I'll second canadairy:  rent a big excavator and pluck the trees out by the roots.   You might be able to get rid of the trees as saw logs or pulp logs if you find a contractor to take 'em.  Otherwise you can stack them by the road and see if people will come and cut firewood out of them.  Failing all else just let 'em rot, or, if you have a way to control a fire and it's ok in that area, burn the brush pile.    I don't know how deep your soil is.  Be careful about using a bulldozer because you'll fill the low areas with good soil and leave rocky ledges or hardpan, and it'll be hard to grow stuff there.    rock walls in new england are just a place to put the stones.    Hogs are great at removing vegetation, and they increase in value as you use them.  If you stock at 10 hogs per acre you'll have bare ground in a month or two, and if you leave the hogs there they'll take out most of the small trees, too.  Train them to an electric fence, and just move the fence to where you want them to work.  they'll cheerfully do the job for you.    train them to an electric fence:  Build a hard-fenced enclosure and inside that put whatever you want to use as y our electric line.  Let them bounce around in there for a week or two, and then use the same electric fence to make a bigger area.  The absolutely last thing you want a pig to learn is that a hard run means freedom.  This training is crucial for your peaceful enjoyment of your farm.  Otherwise you'll have porcine visitors on your front porch and in your garden and down the road."

You could offer a really cheap multiple year lease and include specific rules on how & what is done with the land to protect your interests.  Done right you may even be able to make a little money.

Sometimes you can't make a profit if you buy the equipment. Sometimes you can't afford to pay someone and have to do it yourself.    Can you stay fit and physically active by farming? More than likely. Can you work your ass to the bone from dawn to dusk? Yes you can. Especially if you are running a start up farm/orchard/ag business on a shoestring budget. We work our asses off here and every year we bet a little better equipment and and take a little of the physical workload off.

On a more general level, it depends on what tech you can afford to buy. For myself, milking in a tie stall barn is physically more work than a robot barn. The tie stall is a lot cheaper though. We spent $20 000 putting in a track and getting new milkers, with the result that I saved 2 hours a day and didn't have to carry the milkers around.   I certainly know guys that are working themselves to death, but I also know guys in the same sector that are only in shape if you consider 'round' to be a shape. All depends on what you can afford."
farming,3drrzr,ExorIMADreamer,4,Sun Jul 19 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, /u/koBacon , I don't have experience with citrus, but I do have it with pomegranates and know other fruit growers in California. And orchard farmers in general.  The truth is, orchard farming, depending on what it is, is way easier than row cropping (which I do also) or dairy farming. If you're going fresh market, with most of the fruit in California does, it can require quite a bit of hand labor work. Specifically, pruining and harvest. And sometimes things like rolling out mylar to increase the color of your fruit, which is happening a lot in the Valley now. but things like nut crops, like almonds and pistachios, are farm less intense and have more that can be done mechanically.   Where do you plan on farming? If it's CA, I suggest checking out the UC Davis cost studies for info on not just economic but also labor specifics. Other universities through the US have similar resources available for free.   And thanks /u/Canadairy for the shout out :)"

farming,3dnpbb,frozensalad,5,Fri Jul 17 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"OK, not trying to pop your dreams, so don't take this that way.  Do you know how much land costs? Do you know what kind of farming you want to do and the capital costs of that (grain farming requires much more land than orchards, stock farming generally requires barns, they all have different sorts of equipment needed.) The reason I ask is that you need a job that will help you acquire enough capital to buy/rent land and machinery. Part time work won't get you there. My advice is to look into a career that pays moderately well (accounting, plumber/electrician, etc) that you can do in a rural area. You can hire on as part time work on local farms to gain experience and connections.   As far as dealing with your parents goes, maybe take a look at the census data. You can point out that the average sales (gross, not net) is over $180 000 and that the estimated average value of land and buildings is over a million, even with a huge number of farms selling less than $2500. You'll be entering an industry where you have the potential for huge growth."
farming,3dnpbb,Canadairy,2,Fri Jul 17 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"You're right on all counts, I would emphasize that there are huge barriers to entry to most modern farming operations. Is your dream to own the enterprise or is it to do the work?  There are plenty of people that learned the ropes and have a well paying manager position on large farms.  On the other hand if you end up with a spouse that works full time and you save up instead of spend through your 20s you can put a pretty good down payment on some land and buildings."

Not everyone is cut out to be a farmer, your parents obviously aren't. If you're doing it for the money, you're doing it wrong. This is a lifestyle.  But anyway, I second going to college for Ag. If this is what you really want to do, then do it. But if you want variety there's nothing wrong with getting certified for welding, plumbing or electrical things like Canadairy mentioned. Being a mechanic would be a useful skill on a farm. But you NEED a job to supplement your farming. Do not try to find a way around that, you need one in this day and age. I know of a dozen jobs here in Missouri that allow you to live and work a farm, but basically pay for the necessities of surviving. Also, you need to think about land and think about it hard, this is probably the  biggest investment you'll make financially. You need to figure out where and what kind of farming you want to do. Plan, plan and plan some more. Then save, save and save some more. The one thing I'd recommend you focus on... Stay as far away from debt as possible. You will have to take out loans undoubtedly, but make sure you know how the hell to pay it off before you even think about borrowing a cent.  This is completely unrelated, but have you considered the military?

A lot of the criticism we receive here is from dunning-kruger morons who ignore science when it suits their purpose. They ignore logic when it suits their purpose. You cant reason with these people, because they will simply ignore it and continue to attack you. The only discourse option left is to attack them personally, which is at its best is an attack on their failure to ascribe to logic on any level, and at its worst is the equivalent of screaming at a brick wall.

farming,3dip7j,drak0bsidian,7,Thu Jul 16 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"OK, lets put these numbers into context according to this census data there are ~2.1 million farms in the US. Of those, 788 310 have less than $2500 in sales. An additional 803 494 have less than $50 000 in sales. Not profits, sales. Right off the bat, ~3/4s of farms (1 591 804) in the US don't have enough sales, let alone profits, to provide one person with a decent living. So saying that there are 95000 fewer farmers doesn't tell us much. If those all came out of the smallest category (and looking at the data above you can see that they mostly did.), then it doesn't really matter - their impact was fairly negligible to begin with.   Beyond that, these numbers are always about principle operators. The principle operator is the person who's name is on the farm. So my dad (54) counts, but I (28) do not. There are plenty of farms in the mid and large size range where dad or grandma is the principle operator but much of the work is done by guys like me. If you're not counting the people that are already there to take over the business, then the numbers of future farmers will look terrible.   Finally, you don't need a degree to be a farmer. Ag school is useful, but not actually necessary. What you need is capital. Going in to debt to get a degree to pursue a field that doesn't require a degree is, frankly, dumb. If people want to farm they should put their degree to use earning money they can use as capital investment.   I really need to start saving these for the next dumb ass article like this."

What's driving the consolidation of farms isn't the aging of the farmer, it's the market forces that make bigger farms more viable and the capital requirements of owning land.  Some of those younger farmers will end up owning the land, and most will not, and that's how it works with most businesses.

farming,3djbxl,bruceki,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"your disc won't get very much depth in hard clay; it'll remove the weeds and scratch the surface, but not much else.  I'd consider plowing it and then discing it, and then planting a cover crop of some sort, with the intention of discing it back into the soil in the planting season next year.  As far as building organic matter, i'd think about some sort of carbon and some sort of nitrogen.  manure and wood chips are both usually cheap.  Spread them on the soil, then plow it in and mix it up with your disc.    You don't want to lose too much to erosion.  When rain falls on clay it runs off.   a cover crop prevents that, provides more organic material, and in the case of something like legumes provides more nitrogen for your final crop."

farming,3djbxl,not_whiney,2,Wed Jul 22 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"You can bring in manure/compost/wood chips to give you a boost of organic matter. Bring in a course gravel/sand mix and spread it about 2-3 inches and till all of it in. It will give you some thing to mix and break the clay.   Liming the soil can also help with the clay. So what your soil sample says about your calcium and if you can lime it, do so. Also magnesium if high can cause the sticky soil thing and make it hold water on the surface. I had pretty good results in VA with just like added to clay. It took a couple years but finally broke it up some.   There are products out there called soil conditioners that also are supposed to help break up and get water flowing through the soil. Have not used but have seen a lot of people that say they worked. Again it may take a couple years but don't give up. Treat, wait, sample, treat again.  I would also take your soil sample to the extension service and ask their opinion. They can generally tell you what works for that area since it is likely you are not the first and only farmer with that soil.  Book by Neal Kinsey, ""Hands On Agronomy"" gives a lot of info on soil and soil fertility balancing.  Edit: something else to think about. Get a local farmer with a bigger machine if needed to bust through any compaction. A once and done with a heavier but more powerful machine to break it up and do the first tilling may make sense and then you can just use a smaller set up once the heavy work is done. Little bit of money up front, but it saves time and wear and tear on a smaller, lighter machine."
farming,3djbxl,llsmithll,2,Thu Jul 16 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"When you add aggregates like sand to a heavy clay soil you will make a compacted, concrete-hard soil."
farming,3djbxl,not_whiney,2,Fri Jul 17 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"Not really. It is all grain size. Clays are small grains and sand is larger up to gravel. If you add a good bit of larger grain size in the mix it can break up some of the clay grains. The amount of ""sticky"" you have is driven as much by the chemistry of the soil as grain size. Having other grain sizes in the soil with a good amount of organic gives the clay something else to mix with besides itself.   The real key here is that you have to ADD sand and gravel. Not sprinkle a little on. I am not talking about getting 4 bags of playsand and spreading it over a whole field. You need to add like 4-6 inches of sand gravel and another couple of compost/manure and till it all in to a depth of about 12 inches. The problem most of the time is that people are adding only a small amount of sand/gravel. If you amend and it is still to clay sticky, then add some more. The point is that the best soil is a good spread of large to small particle size in the mix. Clay is all too small particles, just like straight sand is all too big of particles. If you can get the clay broken up and a big dollup of sand incorporated you get the mix you want. Then it can percolate water through and still retain the exchange properties of the clay particles."

I can tell you a little about farming whats considered 'clay' soil in NE like Erie and Mardin but I can't tell you anything about the real clay they have in the south.... When we come into fallow ground we generally mow closely, plow (carefully) with disk coulters in mid july, wait at least 3 weeks for the first disking. If it was plowed well without stretching the sod and most of the plant matter is fully turned you may be able to use a field cultivator, which is preferable from a compaction standpoint which will be important on heavy soil. The most important rule is not to work the soil when it is plastic. No smearing or sheen from the plow, no soil sticking to shovels on FC. Speaking of plows, I've yet to seen a small scale veg guy in my area who bothers to maintain a scoured plow, and for breaking heavy sod having your plow scouring will save you... well i can't even put a cost on it. 10 passes with the disk will not remedy a really poorly plowed field, and the best way to ensure a poor plowing job is going into heavy soil with a rusty plow. Even if you stop and clean the plow every 20 feet, it won't be shiny before you plow a couple acres. If you have a neighbor with a sand hill or gravel pit (dry and abrasive) go plow that for a while, not just until the plow is shiny but until you can't even see the shadows of where the rust was. You want the glint to blind passing cars. Doing this will pay dividends in your heavy soil. Grease the moldboard it after if it's going to sit for more than a week. If you need the soil early, plant a winterkilling cover crop like oats, if later then you can try something you have to kill yourself like rye, or if you want to do something fun and spend money put a tap-rooted brassica in with some fertilizer. If you have the land base you will do yourself a huge favor dedicating 1 out of 3 years for soil-improving cover crops like buckwheat or Sudangrass, and if you can include a cover crop that maintains living roots though the winter. Having that early-season biological activity primed by an established plant, in my opinion, will really change how these soils function physically in the spring, in regards to allowing more soil respiration and the earlier stimulation of pore-forming macrobiota. It can make all the difference on these soils that really aren't appropriate for continuous tillage. We do organic grains, much of it on class 3 soils and some of it in rotation with a neighboring veg guy, if your interested I can talk about this all day. Sorry for the... massive opinion unload..."

farming,3djbxl,Sovereign_Curtis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"raised beds are great, and the plastic mulch will take alot of weed pressure off. I don't know what compost is to you, but Bang-for the buck, (I don't know where your OM is) I would be inclined to go with composted layer hen manure rather than municipal/household compost for fertility in cash crops; and use rotation and cover crops to manage soil OM and tilth. Compost is good but can be expensive for the components depending on what kind you get, and more OM doesn't automatically improve soil functioning. Too much young carbon too fast leaves you with a fungal dominant soil, some of your heavy feeders will do better with more bacterial nutrient cycling. Your clay probably has great CEC already, so if you add OM for tilth just make sure you add enough fertility so the plants are able to find it. Don't forget your tomatoes and peppers and beans love them some Ca, maybe get a bag of oystershells and add it to your starter fertilizer."
farming,3dh788,cruisefever,13,Thu Jul 16 06:25:53 2015 UTC,This is probably more common than most people think. I have seen it several times. Working with family can suck when there is no clear defining of roles. The bad news it probably never get better. Maybe you can work out a split out of your own and have a separate and smaller operation
farming,3dh788,Pumpkin_Pie,2,Thu Jul 16 13:24:48 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a good idea, and I have asked a couple of times about buying out a smaller part of the farm.  However, it's either fallen on deaf ears, or I was told that we need to try and make the whole farm work first.  I had also looked into buying a farm in Saskatchewan and moving our house there, but there's the matter of talking FCC out of that much money.  Also, the idea didn't sit well with wifey, which pretty much ended it right there."
farming,3dh788,Wheatking01,12,Fri Jul 17 05:59:01 2015 UTC,"First of all contact  Elaine Froese, she's a farm family coach in Manitoba and travels all of western Canada dealing with type of situation.  http://www.elainefroese.com/   At the very least get her book, or go to a conference where she is speaking.  Honeslty though I would look at getting a job in town,  it wot get any better with your brother, and sometimes a 9-5 job can be easier to plan with the kids and daycare etc....  1500 acres has to be borderline for supporting two families, let alone 3, anyways.  Perhaps they will give you the 2 acres, power, etc.... for a little extra help during harvest and seeding."
farming,3dh788,Milkhouse,2,Thu Jul 16 12:17:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, small world--I knew Elaine Froese when I was a kid.  Can't remember how I knew her, but I do.  Thanks for the advise, I will have a look at her website and see if I can find her book somewhere."
farming,3dh788,Thebaby1423,20,Fri Jul 17 03:34:28 2015 UTC,"You're in a tough spot, no one is going to argue that. You're going to have to really take a step back and consider the entire situation. What kind of hours to Dad and big brother work? Are they working 10-4:30? Your family considerations aside, those aren't full time job hours for most businesses, let alone a farm.   Are you a full partner is the operation, or a minority stockholder? If Dad owns the majority and is slowly transitioning assets to the next generation, older brother might have the kind of drive he is looking for. Are you there at the meetings when decisions are made? If you don't have the time to be part of the process (ie they meet early in the morning or after work is finished for the day), you might simply be a signature. If you don't make the effort to get involved in the decision process, you can't blame them for making decisions without you.   It's hard for me to believe that the job takes all three when one is standing over the shoulder of another. I work with my two brothers on a small dairy farm (we milk 85 cows), and none of us have the time to stand and supervise the others. Do we yell at each other when we think there is a better/more efficient/cheaper way to do things? YES! We can fight like brothers, that's the family in family farm. But we also have each other's back when needed. How often do you cover the workload for your brother or father? If the answer is your kids and wife don't leave you the time to do it, you might be just an employee of the farm, and not a full partner.   I really don't want to sound hard on you, but from what you wrote, your dad and brother have given you a sweet job. You might have to put up with the BS to keep the job."
farming,3dh788,Milkhouse,7,Thu Jul 16 09:13:16 2015 UTC,"you might be just an employee of the farm, and not a full partner.   Even if he is just considered an employee on the farm, there is no need for them to not be treating him as an equal. The paragraph about his brother driving 10 miles just to supervise him is ridiculous. They should sit down and have a conversation about their situation regardless of him just being an employee."
farming,3dh788,Milkhouse,4,Thu Jul 16 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe big brother really needed that seed, but knows OP likes to gossip with the secretary. I'm sure there is simply too much we don't know about this family dynamic.   We are all speculating based on our own experiences. As I know farming, working 10-4:30 wouldn't make that individual an equal unless they were providing some substantial assets to the operation. OP is not.   In my business, we process and market all of our milk through our own chain of dairy stores. We have a lot of employees, and they are not equals. They punch in, do their job, and punch out. The ones willing to come in early or stay late should the task require are the ones treated as equals. When your paycheck depends on more than just doing your time, you know the difference."
farming,3dh788,hurlyburt,2,Thu Jul 16 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Good point about the gossiping, I know where you're coming from.  In that situation, however, the truck showed up late and staring quietly at the receptionist while waiting would have been really creepy."
farming,3dh788,Octavia9,3,Fri Jul 17 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should have added some background here--we had all moved on from farming, the land was rented out, and the the equipment was all parked.  Then we had a kid and my parents suggested we move halfway across the country to go farming.    No sooner than we went for it than my brother shows up, supposedly to help me out.  By the fall, Dad says we have to learn to get along and start farming together.  That was 3 years ago.    I don't own any assets, but I do have my name on the registration for the company and on the bank account.  And yeah, I might only be an employee, but Dad keeps talking as if we're all a happy farming family--he even scolded me for asking to borrow ""his"" tractor, not ""our"" tractor."
farming,3dh788,Octavia9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"You have a young company, but really need to talk about how things are going to run with the other partners in this venture. First, does the company own the business assets? If so, you have assets. Often LLCs with carry buyout insurance in a member wants to leave the operation. This may be enough to cancel the debt you owe your parents.   Second, if you want to stay on with the company, I hope you realize that you really need your brother and father. Your kids and wife situation create this need. A farmer who works 10-4:30 is not going to be in business very long, especially covering 1500 acres. You either need to find the time to be more involved, or accept the situation as it is - your brother and father doing most of the work and making the decisions.   If the company is simply a work agreement and dad still owns all of the land and equipment, you and your brother are essentially his employees and will have to accept how he chooses to operate. Talk with him and let him know your frustrations."
farming,3dh788,Thebaby1423,9,Fri Jul 17 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"Take the job in town. Your brother clearly cares very deeply about the farm, so if it gets to the point where the farm is failing without you, he will more than likely ask you back, which puts you in the drivers seat on your way to earning more respect."
farming,3dh788,singdawg,5,Thu Jul 16 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to gently suggest you take a really hard look at wether or not you are pulling your weight.  When everyone is against you it's best to ask why.  I think your wife needs to step up if you two want to get ahead in this life.  Two preschoolers isn't that much.  I say that as a woman juggling two plus kids in school, a toddler, while pregnant and running our on farm sales and CSA.  My husband works 50 hours a week off farm and until dark on the farm when he gets home. Work hard, do more than you are asked, be reliable, and your family will notice.  It may take awhile but it will happen.  The flip side is take a job for someone else.  They won't understand or care about your family though."
farming,3dh788,greenknight,2,Thu Jul 16 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified that I don't always start at 10 am--lately it's been around 9, and that's only three days a week when we have a space at the local daycare.  I still usually start before Bro does, and during seeding and harvest Dad has to drag me out of the tractor/combine, kicking and screaming, because he knows I have to go home and put the kids to bed.  I'd love to put in a few more hours and get this farm up to its full potential, but I can't do that at the expense of my family.  As for my wife, her mental illness is at a point where the noise generated by the kids is enough to send her on a downward spiral.  The brain is like any other organ--it can have problems and malfunctions, and we have to live the best we can with them.  In this case, living the best we can means I have to take an extended role in raising our two adorable hellions.  After all, they're the reason we came back to farming, so why would I put this farm ahead of them?"
farming,3dh788,DjSlugger,2,Fri Jul 17 05:20:54 2015 UTC,"I was raised that the farm and specifically in our case the cows come first.  They put food on the table and a roof overhead and everything else will be OK if the farm is doing well. If you don't find away to work it out with your family, understand that a outside job won't care at all about your family issues. My husband would be fired tomorrow for keeping the hours you do even if I was dying of cancer. Private companies can afford and don't care about your personal life.  Your family is going to be more understanding, but be sure you are not taking advantage of it."
farming,3dh788,wowcheckered,4,Fri Jul 17 06:02:57 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling. On our farm it is just my uncle being a jackass and my dad is actually respectful. But it is still tough.  I'd say you should go to one of the family meetings, even if it is out of your way and sit down with both of them. Tell them that you don't like the way you are being treated and you demand more respect from them. Tell them that this ""looking over your shoulder"" nonsense needs to stop and you wanted to be treated like an equal. If they can't do that, then walk away. If they aren't going to show you the respect you deserve then take the job in town. It is hard enough raising two kids (not that I would know), let alone being treated that way. But that is just my 2 cents."
farming,3dh788,Canadairy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:21:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know when these meetings they have are.  He lives in their basement, so he's there all the time to talk with them.  You're right that I should be demanding some respect from Bro, but knowing him the way I do, he'll just ignore me and keep treating me this way.  Then again, it wouldn't be the first time I was wrong...."
farming,3dh788,Thebaby1423,2,Fri Jul 17 04:07:11 2015 UTC,why dont you just start to treat him like he treats you?
farming,3dh788,Gilbertd13,6,Fri Jul 17 15:37:58 2015 UTC,"First off.  Don't sign anything you don't have a hand in.  You could be saddled with a shit ton of liability you aren't getting anything from. You need to be honest and upfront with your brother about your interest in the farm and your requirement that you be involved with business decisions.  Lastly, if you want to farm, realize how lucky you are.  Some of us would kill to be in your position. I'm never going to own a farm, and that's the only thing I want to do."
farming,3dh788,Thebaby1423,5,Thu Jul 16 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"I can relate to you on many levels since I really had a rocky work relationship with my dad starting my teen years when we had the dairy. Always had yelling issues, never physical but for along while the emotional pain did hit me hard for a few years.  It took me 10 years to get a backbone to speak up to my dad to confront the issue to say hey why are you treating me like a piece of shit, can we fix this or not? We worked out minor details, I have been a fruit loop in past cases so he wasn't unreasonable when I looked back at the times we had our squabbles. It felt like a huge amount of weight off my shoulders at the end of it.  In your case it's only a matter of time that you will reach your breaking point if you continue to just ""take"" the bullshit if you don't sort out a point of understanding with your brother & dad. Everyone here is giving sound advice & good suggestions which I hope you read them all but don't take it straight from their perspectives, you have to put it in yours & ask yourself in which ways best how would this improve relations, how to get more proper trust, and how you would approach them."
farming,3dh788,Gilbertd13,3,Thu Jul 16 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"Have you done anything to earn your brother's distrust? Is there anything you can do to address related issues?  Is there anything you can do to carve out very specific jobs that they will trust you to execute 100% effectively?  Can you ""over-deliver"" on jobs so that they begin to trust you more over time?  It sounds like you're taking a lot of personal ownership over your two kids, which is great. How can you use that same energy with farm tasks to go above & beyond the call of duty?"

And to be honest, I think Dad gives me a lot more credit now than he ever did, especially when it comes to repairing machinery.  Bro, on the other hand, just shrugs off anything I do, and seems to take great delight in putting down anything I say.  We are actually at a point where I try not to say anything to him anymore, as even commenting on the weather (ex--""Gee, it's a nice morning"") will result in a lecture about how it's actually a terrible morning.

I don't know how hot it is where you are, but corn requires 160 to 220 lbs of nitrogen, doesn't it? How much was in your starter or applied before seeding? I don't know much about sweetcorn, so just asking."
farming,3dftg2,Thornaxe,5,Thu Jul 16 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"Nitrogen application rates would be a really interesting piece of information to have from a commercial sweet corn grower. A lot of us know rates (in our area at least, and vaguely other places) for grain production, but removing sweet corn would tend to take less from the soil. The flip side is that the plant probably sucks at N uptake, so over fertilization would likely occur, much like truck crops."

farming,3dahdv,Grrizzzly,3,Wed Jul 15 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, so this is going to be tricky. I'm going to make some assumptions to get my final estimate for the total cost to get that full set-up. Mainly, I'm going to use used prices and extrapolate to new... Dicey, I know.  The carts are Kemper Uni-trans carts, probably the 18000. An 18-year old one is selling for $21,000 in Germany.. New? We'll estimate $35,000. Based on US prices of used carts, that is probably a decent number. So we've got 5 x $35,000 = $175,000 in cart cost.  The harvester is a Claas 980. A Claas 980 with 900 hours on it lists at $350,000.  We'll say a new one is $375,000. Running total: $550,000.  The custom head is... priceless. As in, there is no price tag since it isn't a commercial product. However, the Kemper 475 IS a product, although only 7.5 meters in working width. New Kemper 475s are for sale at $110,000. We will bump that up the same amount as the jump from the price of smaller Kemper heads. So $130,000 for the head. Running total: 680,000.  Now the tractors. This is the hardest part because there is never a clear shot of the tractor model numbers. My best guess is that the John Deere is of the 6- or 7R series and greater than 190hp, so a 6190 at minimum. They actually look a little heavier than that, but the camera didn't spend much time on the tractors, unfortunately. A 6190 is selling for $157,000 in Idaho. Bump that up for a new tractor, and we're talking a cool $170,000. Extrapolate for 5 tractors (I know, there's a Claas, New Holland, and I think Fendt in the mix, but for pricing I'll just call them all the 6190) and you get 5 x $170,000 = $850,000 for tractors.   Full total: $1,530,000."
farming,3dahdv,Thornaxe,2,Wed Jul 15 09:31:49 2015 UTC,"forage harvesters work hard, and their value deteriorates faster than you estimated. I'd figure that a new one would be ~half a million. That said, i'm being a little pedantic."

farming,3dahdv,Thornaxe,3,Tue Jul 14 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"combine=/=forage harvester.  Combines harvest only the grain by separating it from the rest of the plant via basically shaking the dried plant (harvested at the end season once its more or less dead) until the grain separates and is collected. The rest of the plant is spat out the back of the machine.  Forage harvesters take the whole plant, it can be at any maturity, and shove it through a cutterhead that chops the whole thing into bits less than an inch long.  This stuff is ""forage,"" and is stored mostly in piles which have been compacted to remove all oxygen.  It is then left to ferment into ""silage"" (the term comes from the old upright silos in which it used to be stored, or ""ensiled."" Nowadays most farms use bunker silos or piles.)  The fermented silage is not for human consumption, it's fed to cattle."
farming,3dahdv,sbharnish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:13:23 2015 UTC,"In good silage its wildly overkill, no forage harvester has anywhere near the power to process all the forage that monstrosity would feed it.

There's only so fast you can drive with a smaller header until problems start creeping up....like ditches."
farming,3dahdv,sterlingarcher97,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:15:07 2015 UTC,The other advantage is in small fields and point rows.

The largest CLAAS combine has an hp of 540 (the Lexion 780) and the S690 John Deere has an hp of 543, narrowly beating it. I failed to find your 590R combine on the internet besides in ads, and because the 780 is its successor, I assume that this new Lexion has a larger engine than it."

My aim is to reduce each sortie time 45-55 minutes to 25-35. The 10 to 15 minutes we waste behind each sortie is from coming back to farm and slow loading. (my field is in one piece btw.)

If you can't make it work on paper, you won't be able to make it work in soil.    So start with 500 vegetable starts.  Lets figure that it takes you 5 seconds per start to fill the soil, tamp it, poke the hole for the seed and put the seed in and bury it.  So you'd need 2500 seconds to do that, or about 4 hours.    the pots cost money.  the soil costs money.  the seeds cost money.  you'll lose some of them, some won't germinate, some won't be pretty enough to sell, so figure in at least 10% loss.    you'll need a place to grow the plants; a greenhouse.  a potting table.  A shovel and a wheelbarrow.  you may need lights or a heat pad.    Most of the time with vegetables you start two seeds and thin to one, so you'e got that to do at some point; another couple of hours.    you'll have to find a market for the plants; that means calling stores or vegetable stands or putting out signs or buyng advertising space or however it is you reach your customers.  figure 5 to 10 hours for that.  Growing is easy; selling is hard.    So now you're up to, what, 20 to 30 hours of labor but you have 450 vege starts to sell.  at $15/hour for your labor, you're at $450 labor costs.  your materials cost you, what, $50?  so for your 450 plants your cost is $1.11 each.  Whats a start retail for in your area?  $2?  but you've got to have someone stand there and hand the plants to the customer if you go retail, or deliver them to the retailer if you go wholesale.  more labor costs.  fuel.  have to have a way to rransport -- pickup or trailer...  so your breakeven goes to $1.25 or $1.50   at $2 retail you'll make $250 profit, but you want $500 profit, so you now have to raise 1,000 plants to get there.  that's how you start figuring this stuff out.  starts are a seasonal thing, so there's going to be months when there's no market, and other months that are busy, so you might find yourself raising 6,000 or 10,000 starts.  now do you have enough greenhouse space?  how about hours in the day?   gonna quit the day job?"

farming,3d0zqy,not_whiney,3,Sun Jul 12 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on the restaurants in your area. call them and talk to people.   I have seen specialty garlic do very well. Also heirloom tomatoes.   The reality is that restaurants have to market. They need their product to sell. So anything ""special"" may work for them. Depending on the area, just local may be enough to get you a good relationship set up. Locally grown greens can be a big seller. Especially if you can season extend and get them greens out of normal season.   The trick here is not Invent a niche or go with the next ""Super Food."" You want to make money for 20 years, sell a crop that will be wanted tomorrow and 20 years form tomorrow.   2 examples. Guy grows 20 varieties of Garlic. he has contracts to grow special types and sell to restaurants.  The contract says he has to deliver garlic every week in x quantity or he pays a fine to the restaurant. Otherwise they have to by a minimum of x pounds at X price every week. He is doing well and makes a good steady business. But these are all very special and pain in the ass to grow and there is a risk there.   Another guy I know does hydroponics and high tunnel plants. He supplies tomatoes to a few restaurants year around. They market there products as fresh, vine ripened, local. It is their story for the customer. It sets them apart form other restaurants. Other wise they are just tomatoes. But he gets a god price by only doing business with a few places and they get to differentiate themselves.  It will depend on your specific market. Greens can be very profitable so can certain fruits. Strawberries can be a big winner if youcan supply year around. Fresh strawberry short cake in February? From a local grower? Wow."

If you want a quick buck organic salad mixes can be a good way to go and the more types of seasonal greens you offer the more you can charge.  Also if you're into putting the time in on a value added product, pickled cucumbers, peppers, beets, and other veggies can be pretty lucrative assuming your area isn't already saturated with people pickling stuff. If you grow the veggies yourself you can end up being able to charge a pretty decent mark up at the end, and most states don't require pickling to be done in a commercial kitchen as long as you follow certain rules.  EDIT: I forgot you had mentioned selling direct to restaurants but I thought I might give a little advice specifically on that front since it's something I've done a fair bit. Selling to restaurants is harder than it seems. A lot of restaurants either aren't aware or don't care about buying local food, so sometimes you'll be in the position of trying to convince people of that before you can even convince them to buy your product. If you are successful in selling your product you'll most likely either end up with lots of small sales to many restaurants, or one to two restaurants buying everything. Both of these options have their ups and downs. If you work with a lot of restaurants you're more likely to have times where none of them want anything and vice-versa (where they all want too much at the same time). They're also not gonna generally be understanding if you tell them something like ""sorry I sold everything to that other place already"" and you can lose customers over night unless your relationships with them are extremely good. If you're selling to just one or two restaurants it's easier to have steadier sales but you end up with the ""all your eggs in one basket"", and the restaurant industry is a very volatile business so even very stable seeming restaurants sometimes go belly up very quickly, or even if they don't close they might suddenly drastically reduce in volume.  None of this is to discourage you, just want you to know that selling direct to restaurants isn't always simple; depending on your area you might find that doing a farmer's market once or twice a week is actually less work and better money!"

I live in an area that's pretty new to the whole buying local/organic thing, but we've developed a relationship with a few restaurants and caterers and try to accommodate them; for example one of our clients asked if we could grow a specific type of cabbage for her.  In general, our salad mix is one of our top sellers, both at markets and wholesale accounts. We also grew spinach and baby kale in our greenhouses through the winter and they sold well too (people were amazed to see fresh greens in the middle of January in Pennsylvania). So if you're already familiar with growing lettuce, I would definitely stick with that and maybe some other greens, and don't expand too much into other veggies unless you know you can sell them."

For local restaraunts mushrooms would make you quite a lot too. Since you have the space and the access to greenhouses, mushrooms would be totally possible. You can always stick to the basics though and grow basil, Rosemary, oregano and mints."

I think you would need an extensive and well developed network of customers to sell enough mint to make the same amount of profit as you would selling salad greens and staple veg in a farmers market."
farming,3cztav,CochinBrahmaLover,5,Sun Jul 12 07:23:49 2015 UTC,"Some of these are close but not all correct... Normally for square bales we like to sale them straight out of the field. If we cut 1000 bales and not sale any out of the field we have to spend another day moving those bales from the field to the barn. There is more work, time and cost moving the bales. That cost is passes on to the consumer and that why its more expensive out of the barn. No one who sells reputable hay will leave it in the field to get rained on or a heavy dew. The hay is just as good, if not better out of the field. Depending on the farmer they may have a accumulator and be able to load you with a tractor as well."
farming,3cztav,L_DUB_U,8,Sun Jul 12 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"Where I live you can buy hay 'Standing', 'In the field', 'In the barn' or 'Delivered'. Standing means you have to harvest the hay yourself, in the field means you have to pick up the hay. The other two are self explanatory. Occasionally people sell hay or straw 'In the windrow', meaning it is ready to be baled but you must bale it yourself."
farming,3cztav,price101,4,Sun Jul 12 10:59:14 2015 UTC,How would one sell standing hay? I just bought a house with about 15 acres of what I've been told is quality hay.  How can I assess what a fair sale price is?
farming,3cztav,-o-o-o-o-0-o-o-o-o-,2,Sun Jul 12 15:21:29 2015 UTC,Talk to a few local farmers who have hay to try and get a fair assessment of local prices. If you only talk to dairy farmers they might try and under value you since they're likely the ones buying it :P

farming,3cztav,not_whiney,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:48:24 2015 UTC,mid west here. I think I know now. Its more in the barn because the farmer has already through the work of loading the bales on a wagon/trailer then unloading them in the barn. Or he will sell them for a discount of the buyer wants to do all the work.
farming,3cztav,Thornaxe,2,Sun Jul 12 08:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ok so it's literally ""you pay more if I put them here convently"" nothing else.  That makes sense, but I wasn't sure."
farming,3cztav,Glarosaurus-rex,2,Sun Jul 12 09:02:10 2015 UTC,"Not just ""conveniently"". If you buy straw or hay right after cut, it is convenience.  However, for instance in the Midwest right now, hay or straw in the field (baled, windrowed, or however) is WAAAAAY different than what was cut, baled, and stored under cover. When we are getting an inch of rain every 2 or three days..... We had one or two short periods of sunny, dry days.  I actually expect to see additional barn fires this late summer and early fall when it finally get swarm and dry. Also I would bet there will be some additional vet calls as well since a significant amount of hay has gone up wetter than it should be. I feel sorry for those out west having to buy hay out of the Midwest sight unseen. I am guessing many will be getting lower quality than they are paying for."
farming,3cztav,Grrizzzly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"When the seller says ""in the field"" he may be selling hay he hasnt baled yet, or has yet to even cut. Could be a situation where you buy X bales and he knows he doesnt have to pick those up, and calls you to come get them when the baler is still warm.  Not saying that's the case, but that's how I'd do it if i was trying to sell hay like that.  I baled up small squares of wheat straw a couple years ago and couldnt GIVE them away while they were in the field. Dad and I got a little carried away with a new (to us) small square baler."
farming,3cztav,Grrizzzly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"So I'm just guessing, I had no idea when I read your title but just reading the context of when it might be used I just got the picture of someone saying there's $11 worth of hay still not harvested (out in the field) and $12 worth all packed up in the barn ready to be sold or used. So as long as nothing happens to the crop then that should be an extra $11 in the bank account when they sell it (but it's not for certain)"

farming,3cztav,nefariousmango,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:49:48 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you for sure, but I know if I were selling hay, I would charge more for hay I had baled and stored inside than I would for hay delivered as I baled it.

farming,3cztav,dixie_cup,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:02:55 2015 UTC,"Now I'm nervous. It is possible the lower price is for a buyer to come and bale the hay themselves. I don't know enough about small bales to say what the cost per bale would be, maybe $1... honestly, it could go either way."

farming,3cxomb,tcpip4lyfe,12,Sun Jul 12 00:53:38 2015 UTC,"Hello, I have lived on a farm my entire life. I have another post on this subreddit with a backstory you can read if you like. My childhood was pretty good. It definitely wasn't boring for me, because I loved farming, loved the outdoors. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have a place to go and wander around, hunt, fish or something. There was always a little cedar forest that I went to when things weren't going well. And even though my family life wasn't the best and most of my family members had problems (alcoholism, domestic abuse, cheating, even schitzophrenia) I look back on my childhood with almost nothing but happiness. I guess I can attribute that to living on a farm. Starfox mentioned being lonely and boring but in my experience, I disagree. I don't need a big city to be happy. The closest town many miles away had less than 10 people in it. The next biggest town had about 100 with an antique store and a pop machine. Every once in a while, I needed a trip into town with my girlfriend to see a movie or eat a meal and definitely internet for relaxing. But the farm life was the life for me.   Probably one of the most memorable stories I can think of is when I was about 15 years old. For as long as I could remember, I had worked in the fields in fescue season, and then worked for everyone I could find. I wouldn't ever get paid working for my parents, they could't afford it. But I still worked as much as I could and eventually purchased a bottle calf, and another and another and so on. When I was 15, I had about ten thousand worth of cattle. I was going to buy my first vehicle with a few thousand and continue saving as well as farming with the rest. One day, I got home from school and went to check on my cows, but all of them were gone. Turns out, my dad sold them all and used the money to pay loans and debts. I don't remember being angry about it. I worked extra hard the next season and managed to make $1,000 in a year to buy a bucket of bolts car. The only times I remember being angry were the many times I couldn't do something out in the fields or had to check cattle by foot in the subzero temperatures. All because I didn't have a truck that I could work with, but would have had one if I still had MY money that I worked for. But it taught me lessons that my friends would never experience. And that's aside from the lessons like how to drive a manual, how to drive and fix a tractor and combine, how to bottlefeed calves, how to doctor calves.. hah  It definitely takes a certain type of person to do this work. Aside from the hard work, range of knowledge and everything, the money is unstable and you never know how a year is going to be. You could be on top of the world with an amazing year and up to your neck in debt the next. Unfortunately most of my childhood was spent in the latter portion of that. Although that was really discouraging, it also taught me how to live simply and enjoy the natural, beautiful things in life. Figuring this out changed my life. I don't think you have truly lived until you have been able to sit back and enjoy peace and freedom. To me, peace was living here, doing what I love without worry of the world around me. Just my family and my cattle. I grew up in my dream and I plan on living this dream till the day I die."

It was more like being a short adult from a very young age.  Tons of responsibility, but I wanted it, if that makes sense.  It was being part of a team and having real world things to think about and real consequences to fucking up.  I also understood at a young age that if I slacked off or went away, someone else should have to work harder to pick up my slack. My friends talked about stupid tv shows, celebrities, and clothes.  I stressed over pedigrees, milk futures, and corn hybrids. There was some fun and it was a good way to grow up."
farming,3cxomb,Octavia9,3,Sun Jul 12 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't find it boring at all.  My friends were also farm kids and we somehow managed to all get together and goof around in the summers.  We played a lot of baseball and June and July we had a hay and straw crew together and we'd go around putting up hay and stray for other farmers.  It was very hard work and very hot but it was so great.  You are out with your buds earning money and there were some great stories.    I got to spend a lot of time with Dad working.  I cherish those times as I get older.  When my Grandpa was still alive those days were really special.  My Grandpa and Dad had this thing where if I was with one and the other was around and we goofed something up you would never tell the other about your mistake.  It was funny.  The end of the day we always made 10 minutes or so to gather in the shop, my Dad, Grandpa, uncle, me and any hired help we had and we'd all lean on the truck or a tractor drink a soda or beer and just shoot the breeze.  Those were some of the truly happiest times of my life.    Then there were dates.  Farms are amazing for dates, especially if you are dating a girl from in town.  You take them out and lay in the grass and show them the stars.  There are plenty of places to sneak off and well you know.  Girls dig farm boys too.   My family was pretty poor in the 90s because we got flooded and lost everything.  However those years after that when I was really growing up (I was in my mid teens) I see a positive despite us being poor.  It was hard, there were a lot of hard times and a lot of hard work, but family and friends were always there to help pull us through and I just look back at my life growing up a farmboy as really positive."

I got to drive huge tractors to rake or tedder hay, helped with a huge milking operation, and cleaned up property for the horse farm owner who held riding clinics with Olympic champions as the guest. I was driving tractors and hay equipment at age 12!  Although I didn't live there, one key component about being on a farm is the early hours. You gotta get up early to get a jump on the day. Every day, weekends included.

The class-action suit is open to farmers whether or not they used the Syngenta seed, since they still lost money due to lower market prices.  Will I be compensated fairly? No idea. But the lawyers are offering to work on contingency. Was it enough to matter? The lawyers are (predictably) claiming it's the primary reason we went from $7 corn to $4 corn.

farming,3cwh2q,Sojali,7,Sat Jul 11 10:44:35 2015 UTC,"My wife and I are moving into our 4th year of running a CSA in Michigan. We are fortunate to have a land grant university in the area that runs its own CSA, and publishes lots of information to help you get started(planting guides, etc). Below are a few things I've learned along the way.  1) Start with up front research and planning. Try to estimate what you will be harvesting every month. From there you can figure out how much space you need for planting, when you should be starting sets / direct seeding, etc. Talk to other people in the area who are growing similar crops, or even doing a CSA. If the market is similar to ours they are happy to help out new farmers, because the demand for fresh local produce is much greater than the supply.  2) Don't underestimate the weed pressure of small scale organic farming. Poly tunnels are great for season extension, but they have the same effect on weeds as well.  For instance where I live we get a lot of chickweed in the spring. Unfortunately our hoop houses create a spring like environment from October through May. Best advice here is to cultivate twice a week with a stirrup hoe, or collinear hoe. I can cultivate a 34'x96'(approx 10m x 30m) hoop house in 2-4 hours if I do it 1-2 times a week. Once the weeds get out of hand it takes 2 hours to do a single bed.  3) Make sure you have the right tools. In order of importance *hoes - Collinear, stirrup, and a good hand hoe(http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-5504-hand-hoe.aspx) *a file to keep them sharp *a good precision roller planter i.e.(http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-9515-jang-jp-1-seeder-without-roller.aspx) *a good salad mix planter (http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-6613-six-row-seeder.aspx)  4) Don't get too big too quick. so far our best year was our first year. We had 10 customers, and 1 large hoop house. The second year we grew to 25 customers, but we were not prepared for it. It was a very rough learning curve.  5) Get to know other local farmers. Farmers are typically happy to help others out. My neighborhood farmers give me manure, help me plow, give me rotten hay for compost, plant my pasture and sell me straw for mulch. In return I help them out when they need an extra farm hand, or pay them a fair price for their time and fuel.  As you gain more experience, you will learn what works and what doesn't work. You will find when you need bigger tools etc.  For instance I recently started using an antique tractor with a single row cultivator. It has saved me hours of work this year.  TLDR -  Start slow, with a good plan and schedule. Get to know your neighbors. Start with some simple tools, and grow slowly so you have time to learn."
farming,3cwh2q,mikejoconnor,2,Sat Jul 11 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely fantastic advice. I shall take it all on board.  Thank you so much for taking the time to write it all, and I read it all, re-read, then read bits out to the other half who works in an office for far to many hours and is completely jealous that I will be outdoors most days.  Breaking my back, yes, but I will be outdoors doing what I love doing the most!  I have no expectations of customers for the first year, none at all. My only concern is what to do with all my produce at the end of year one. I can assume that the local hostels and homeless shelters can only take so much food by donation, and even then most places do not accept fresh foods.  I have wanted to get a hoops house as apposed to poly tunnels. I think the poly's will be too warm... never even thought about weeds in there! I shall certainly rethink that.  Oooh, I like them 'seeders'. not seen them before, I was trying to work out how to plant so many seeds all at once, though I did consider starting EVERYTHING in a greenhouse/poly/hoop house. I need to look at that again then. It is perhaps for the best that I am not allowed on my field for sowing till next year.  I am doing this through the local government, Agricultural department, and they seem to want to give me a LOT of help, but at the moment language is a huge barrier as I do not speak Swedish. I am on a course, but it's slow going. Their English is not great and we lose a lot in translation.  Again, THANK YOU! Huge, massive help!"
farming,3cwh2q,Sinner37,2,Sat Jul 11 18:09:04 2015 UTC,"Just want to start by saying I have no actual help for you on the CSA side, just the actual gardening/growing side.  I am on 5 acres and was tired of buying fertilizer, renting backhoe/tilling services so I started out on a mission as my health went down to create a small farmstead that required less and less amount of physical work from me.  After months and months of research I found a method I wanted to try and we converted a couple acres over to it.  This is basically a run down of that method with videos at the end that helped me.  1) Do NOT till/plow your land!  All you are doing is killing the beneficial microbes and mitochondria that live there already!  You are putting yourself two steps back when you do this.  Instead you want to create an environment where those things thrive.  A)  Use cardboard or paper.  I used on 2 acres, 2 sheets of local newspaper I got free from a place that collected old paper.  Lay it down flat against the ground and wet it.  (this will be used to kill the weeds and grass under it, while earthworms seem to love to eat this stuff like crazy)  B) Add 3 inches of compost.  It can be more or less depending, my soil was complete ashy loam mixed with rock.  I couldn't get a shovel down in it without completely breaking my back so I did 4 inches.  A family member in California who is going through massive drought issues followed my lead, he had great soil to begin with so he only used an inch.  C) Cover it.  We use any sort of wood-chip here, they say Cedar is bad because of oils in the tree, but I've gotten full loads of Cedar and its fine.  They say don't put it right up to the tree trunk in your orchard, I did it, its been fine and the growth has been outstanding.  I am not sure what types of trees you have there, but really as long as you keep all of the mix in the chipper, including pine needles, cones, leaves and chop it under 2 inch size at least (varying size works the best) you will be alright.  We have used hay, grass clippings, etc but always come back to the chips.  Before everyone and their aunt in this sub tell you why wood-chips can't be used due to nitrogen leaching, actually read the facts:  http://www.fluvannamg.org/2010/03/winter-garden-gifts-21/  D)  If you are doing this during the summer, and rain is non existent in your area you might want to dust the top also with an inch or so of compost and water once in a while to keep it semi wet util wet season starts.  This does a few things.  It never takes away from the ""skin"" of the earth.  It only adds.  Your nutrient levels year after year will continue to climb.  You won't have to keep adding synthetic nutrients year after year and watching your crops get smaller and smaller.  The wood chips retain moisture so you do not have a need to water nearly as much.  In WA State where I get rain all the time then get none for 3 months, I usually never water during the dry season because the wood chips have retained enough moisture and the constant cover prevents it from drying out.  They are an insulator allowing you to keep root vegetables in the ground without them dying all winter long.  You can pick your beats and carrots well after growing season has ended and the sugars will be drawn out from the cold making them super sweet.  Lastly, the wood-chips are the prime environment for mitochondria and over time break down into the blackest, most aerated soil you could imagine.  Because there is so much moisture from the wood chips the plants you grow will be FILLED with water.  This also helps with pests as they drown when they bite into the fiber they are after.  Pest control has never been easier for me.  Now, to your question about what to do with the extra greens.  Get Chickens.  Don't feed them grains after their initial starter power food they get as babies.  Just give them all the weeds, clippings, and extra un-claimed food you get from the garden.  They will compost the greens by eating and pooping, and they mix your compost pile by kicking it up when they walk around.  When you need more compost, go into the chicken pen, grab a sifter screen and a wheel barrel and sift the soil into barrel and distribute in garden area.  Weeding in this method will be easy.  They pull out with no force needed, no digging required.  Just turn and pull and the complete weed root system comes with it.  I use 4 tools total.  A Rake: I just got one that was wood handle from local feed store.  A good pair of pruners I use these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023RYT0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01    I have a small orchard also of apples so I use a pruning saw, this one has been great: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BQZLBW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01  And a cart.  I got this one because it hooks up to my 4 wheeler:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0C683K?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00  I also don't grow anything that isn't in season so I don't need to use hoophouses anymore.  I got tired of trying to maintain the humidity, and tempatures.  I live in Zone 8a though so your weather might require different growing environments. (I haven't filled in my other 3 acres with this method yet, started on 2 to see how it worked)  The movie that inspired me (Lots of God Talk, so if you aren't Religious you will have to listen to the advice he is giving you and deal with the Religion in between but its worth it.)  http://www.backtoedenfilm.com/  He doesn't sell the video, he offers free tours on his farm to show you it in action and he will, if you write him and give him a phone number call you and answer any questions you have.  He is in PST -8 so remember that if you do ever contact him.  I haven't had to yet as on youtube there are a plethora of awesome do's and don'ts that help you through the process.  Again, none of this is for sale and none of these channels are mine.  I have never talked to Paul, or any of the youtube channels I'm going to link you, just took their ideas and ran with it and so far I have never been happier.  L2Survive has the greatest amount of videos related to the subject of the garden as he seems to do tours @ Pauls every year:  https://www.youtube.com/user/L2Survive/videos  Appalachia's Homestead has great info on Chickens:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXyRtDXzptYN56-UxNhYAbQ  And here is a general Youtube search for back to eden gardens:  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=back+to+eden+garden  I wish you the best, we started this because we are doing the same thing in a different way.  We are just donating the majority of crops we don't eat to local food banks.  We called them up and gave them what we have, what will be available at what times, and when they can pick it up.  I deal with NONE of the transporting of produce right now.  If families want to come and pick up a box of food they just have to come pick it out themselves.  We ask for a 5 dollar donation for a box of food, but if they don't have it we don't require payment, its a donation.  Most of the materials we needed to start were free.  Wood chips, Compost, Paper all gotten locally by calling other farmers who raised cattle, Arborists who run local tree cutting services and just asking neighbors and businesses for old cardboard and paper.  All the info Mike gave you is great, although I don't use seed planters I just take a rake, string and seeds and just pull about half an inch of soil back down the line, drop a seed in at whatever spacing is required and pull the dirt back over - (You will need way more spacing than recommended if you use back to Eden gardening, everything will be huge)  Anyway, regardless of how you decide to implement the actual grow plan, using Eden or some other method, I wish you the best.  The more people getting back to growing good good the better off this planet will be.  I doubt at first this method of growing would be good for anyone on larger farms (1000+ acres) but for us smaller farmers its a perfect system."
farming,3cwh2q,Sinner37,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"I already incorporate all these methods as I have been a grower for as many years as I can remember. It is in my blood, my parents grow, as did their parents before them and many relatives grow and run  market stalls.  The ploughing is not down to me but the council who are leasing me the field. Once they have done it, it will not be done again, not by me anyway. Cardboard and mulch is the only way I do it! :)   Plenty of rain here, and snow... lots and lots and LOTs of snow!  Thank you so much for all your advice, it is very much appreciated and there is a lot of information here for me to go through. THank you!"
farming,3cwh2q,Sinner37,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:59:54 2015 UTC,"Hi again, so I went back and re-read everything you said and thought I should comment again.  Getting chickens is definitely something I will be looking at doing, when I have worked out how to look after them in the Winter. Here in Sweden the Winter is long, cold and snowy! As I will not live close to the field, I might not be able to get there every day if it has been a heavy snowfall the night before so I need to work out what to do before committing to chickens.  I have read and watched some videos on the Eden gardening, and whilst I am not religious in any shape or form and do not believe in a higher being, I am fascinated by the whole process.   Letting nature do all the work for me certainly looks good, but honestly, if it is too good to be true, it usually is. Although, I am more than happy to try this in part of my field for certain crops as an experiment to see how they fair against crops done in the usual way.  If successful, I will be more than happy to extend this type of 'gardening' to the rest of my field. At the moment though, I have had my 'brain erased' by schooling and trained as an RHS Horticulturist, so I shall be using those skills in the first couple of years.  But, again, I am very interested in ALL methods used to bring back the highest yield, organically of course."
farming,3cwh2q,Sinner37,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:21:02 2015 UTC,"Anytime.  I am not a religious fellow either, but watch videos on Paul's garden.  No one can argue with the method if they actually look into it.  I tried to argue it then I actually shut up and tried it, now I am converting all 5 acres.  The only ones down-voting are the ones who have never actually tried this method."
farming,3cwh2q,Sinner37,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I am definitely going to try it. Anything is worth doing if you have not done it before and others have had great success.  Obviously there are other factors that will come into it, like soil, location, seeds, but as I said, I am more than happy to give it a go. If it works, I will 'spread' the technique! :D  I just wish I could get onto my damn field before the New Year. I could be doing so much in preparation for next years sowing."

It is a tool like any other can be used recklessly or beneficially.  Just like a chainsaw can be used to clearcut or manage a woodlot sustainably."
farming,3cwh2q,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,0,Sun Jul 12 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Uh, yes it does destroy beneficial microbes and bacteria.  And if you stopped reading at Mitochondria you need to brush up on your bene bio's and garden amendments.  Who in their right mind who knows anything about soil would stop reading advice because they talk about ""mitochondria""?  Someone who doesn't understand soil.  Not only does it help with nutrient uptake for your crops, it can help with soil erosion which we have a huge problem with in Zone 8a in parts of WA.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21766870  http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/target_tillage_to_protect_the_soil  There are instances where one might want to till but even the two outlined here the problem is solved by mulching wood chip beds.  The truth is there people just have to read and be open, unfortunately as most farmers know, other farmers can be stubborn."

farming,3cu6an,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,10,Sat Jul 11 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"Of course. My family has been farming the land around my town for generations. The cabin was built by my grandfather and a few of his friends. I've lived here all my life until my parents got divorced when I was 15. My mom moved to the suburbs in a nearby town while my dad and I stayed to work the farm. My dad eventually tried to make amends with my mom and moved to the suburbs to live with her. I was sort of back and forth between the farm and where my parents lived. Eventually, my mom decided that she was staying in the suburbs and my dad decided he was going to live with her. So now i'm 18 and my dad has essentially given the farm to me, he told me that I can live there as long as I want to and do whatever I want with the land and the cattle. I live alone and manage the summer fescue harvest and cow-calf operation. The land and house aren't mine legally but i'm the only one living here and actually taking care of everything."

I worked construction for thirty years and it kind of broke me down. I am now retired and living quietly in with the wife in our small little home. We do have 40 acres on a river of brush that the Grand kids just love to run riot on so that's great . To much work to get back into shape to farm so we just hunt and fish which has it's own rewards. Best of luck and keep me up to date on your headway.

You could check with a local high school/vocational school, or community college. Our high school auto shop would rebuild engines (no warranty though) if you were willing to wait, risk the rebuild by high schoolers, and bought the parts. maybe you could work a deal and get it rebuilt for under a grand.  Another choice is finding a donor engine that fits and doing just a swap.   Another choice is to do what you said, see if you can get it sold ""as is"" to someone who can work an engine or needs the parts off it.

I grew up on a farm with fields similar to what you're describing and I feel your pain  If you are looking for a more detailed/mathematical explanation I would look at how engineers program the tool paths on CNC machines.  I'm guessing that's what they use to program all the huge GPS planters.  When I was in engineering school I was amazed at the similarities between field work and how engineers program CNC milling machines to calculate the most efficient tool paths.  I don't know of any materials available on the web that explain this in a usable way but I will attest that it works.  I've saved a noticeable amount of time doing field work on our farm using my knowledge of designing tool paths.  I hope that helps!

You may have some small corners of the field that are difficult to reach so you will really need to plan out your path well. Use flags or markers to indicate where to begin your straight rows in necessary.  If there are two possible orientations for your rows choose the one on the N-S axis.

I would really like to hear your experience with this crop, there is a seedman in Fruitvale that carries it."
farming,3coien,lajaw,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"I used a modified corn planter.  Seed spacing was 6 feet x 36 inches.  Planted into disked soil that the previous growing season had grown sorghum-sudan as a plow-down.  There was some trash, but in south AL, the trash doesn't last too long.  Never had trouble with it being slow to start unless it doesn't rain or you plant into too dry soil.  Use a packer on/behind the planter for good soil contact.  I really don't see how you could use a broadcaster for seeding though.  The seed is pretty big.  It doesn't have to have support as it will climb itself, sort of like poison ivy does after a few years, but it'll do it in a couple of months.  The  only reason you'd need support would be to make seed harvest easier. How many acres are you planting?

I guess maybe my statement has more to do with using dry fertilizer in a starter application. As in applied with the planter in a combined pass. Thats basically unheard of anywhere around me. Everyone prefers to pay a premium for the privilege of rotting their planters with liquid starter."
farming,3clutq,silverleafnightshade,0,Fri Jul 10 01:57:30 2015 UTC,"The planted isn't applying the fertilizer in this case either.  It's just incorporating it.  Besides, all starter fertilizers primarily contain orthophosphate which isn't available in a pure dry form.  Dry is primarily polyphosphate.    Not all crops respond to starter fertilizers and not all crops can handle very much fertilizer in furrow without burning the seed.  Not everyone in the US farms the way the farmers in your area farm.  Here in the Texas Panhandle we don't put starter in furrow with the cotton seed because it doesn't work.  We do band apply herbicide with the planter and apply starter in furrow to peanuts.  We've had any damage whatsoever from doing either of those things.  The reason there's more companies making liquid injection equipment is because you have more options, plus anhydrous has its own special application needs.  The amount of equipment made to do something is not indicative of how widely it's used.  And yes, most dry fertilizer is surface applied.    I still think you don't know what you're talking about.  It's really easy to strip till in dry fertilizer ahead of the planter, including attaching the strip till rig to the planter and pulling it with the same tractor."
farming,3clutq,Thornaxe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"1) dry phosphate is polyphosphate because the step necessary to convert it to orthophosphate takes energy (aka cost). This is done for liquid phosphorus preparations because the freight costs would be even worse without doing so. Technically there is an orthophosphate preparation of dry phosphorus, its numbers are 15-75-0 or thereabouts. It's practically unheard of because the freight savings are outweighed by the conversion costs from 11-52-0.  2) You're correct that not all crops respond to starter fertilizer. However you seem to imply that starter fertilizer is only put on in furrow. The proper way to apply is in a 2x2"" band away from the seed, thus basically eliminating seed burn. However, a lot of people want to avoid the mechanism cost of doing this, so they opt for in furrow options they are told are ""just as good"" or ""good enough"" by someone selling the product.  You're saying putting a strip till machine in front of the planter is easy? By easy i assume you mean without downsides? That's a terrible idea, although i'm sure theres idiots out there doing it. If you're tilling up that seed bed right in front of the planter with a shank, you're never going to get the soil settled down properly and you'll have seeds falling down in voids and ending up planted 4"" deeper than you wanted them to. Unless maybe strip till in your area is done without a shank, at that point you've basically described aggressive trash whippers on a planter.  Yes the amount of machinery available for a particular application most certainly is indicative of the market. There's not much cotton machinery for sale where i live...because there's no cotton. Lots of used planters available with liquid fertilizer on them, basically none with dry starter. Liquid starter is king for reasons that make no sense to me."

farming,3clutq,muupeerd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:55:42 2015 UTC,"As far as I know it does depend on the farmer. Usually though, a few weeks after planting they will raise the bed slightly more by covering it with some 5 cm of more soil from in the between the hills. This gets rid of a lot of weeds.  Occasionally herbicides but mechanical ways such as a good rotation, mechanized hoeing between the hills and manual hoeing is done. This can be done because the Netherlands is a big producer & exporter of planting tubers so the potatoes are carefully watched and diseased plants removed. After a while the whole field will be covered and no weeds will be able to successfully grow anymore due to the competition."
farming,3clutq,81zedd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:27:46 2015 UTC,"Is it typical to plant whole potatoes there? It looks in the video like they are.  I believe all the potato guys around me, cut there seed potatoes and treat with an inoculent? before planting."
farming,3clutq,muupeerd,2,Thu Jul 9 14:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, whole potatoes costs a little more then big cut potatoes but produces higher yields with lower less diseases.   The system and regulation for growing seed potatoes are very harsh and contributes to the quality."

The long and short is that most corn fed cattle are also fed hay or haylage, as well as other protein sources. Corn is high energy-low protein feed, which causes animals to deposit more fat. Because venison is naturally very lean, I'd wager that venison from deer that eat some corn is probably better. This is only an educated guess, however."

Most sheep will get panicky already if they're upside down, and if you're grabbing their feet, you're grabbing the bit they're most likely to flail in your face.  There are plenty of predators that will start right in on them for dinner while they're still alive in that position, so I can't blame them for their nervousness.  It wouldn't be too unusual if she's been cast (upside down) for a bit to take a few minutes to get back on her feet steady.  Depending on the breed and how long she's been upside down, you might even need to help keep her propped laying right side up for a few until she can get her feet under her.  If she's been upside down long enough to start to bloat, she may even still be at risk after she's back upright on her feet - if she's bloating and can't clear enough of the gas out, she may just make it out of sight and end up right back down.  If you know the farmer, let him know she's been down if you can - he might need to keep an extra eye on her for a bit.  Source: was just righting one of mine and treating bloat Sunday night.

One of the most dangerous spots is to be in between a cow and her calf.  While it's never a good idea to trust a bull, they (and particularly the meat breeds) tend to be pretty docile if you're not outright harassing them.  Sounds like you handled it ok - them walking towards you and mooing when you left, probably just meant they were disappointed that they didn't get what they were expecting (ie. different pasture, treats)."

farming,3cf1x3,rednuck,4,Tue Jul 7 16:00:31 2015 UTC,"Many farmers (myself included - we raise dairy goats) will remove the horns when the animals are very young (ie. within several weeks of birth).  Without the horns, they're less of a danger to one another (when they're fighting) or to people (when they're being handled).  Some species are naturally polled, meaning they're born without horns."

Am I correct that this is a little late to be doing an assessment for them so essentially we have to do this in the fall after harvest and its less likely we'll find them if its cold?

The timing for scount and making decisions for the planting season is absurd; especially for the first couple years.  Basically, how I see it: Next spring, scout for the following year seed buying decision. Now, I have no idea if Ont Gov. will be mandating when the scouting needs to be done; there is so much still up in the air."

If my understanding is correct, next year all of us will plant and hope that the 50% of our crops that weren't treated neonics have an ok yield.  If they are less then we have to submit test results confirming we need them after the damage has already been done to the 2016 crop in preparation for 2017.

farming,3bxr82,Canadairy,2,Fri Jul 3 07:10:32 2015 UTC,"How about the fact that Fonterra owns plants in other countries and is pushing to have dairy products from there labeled as Product of New Zealand? That you can't really ship milk unless you own shares in Fonterra? It controls, what, 94%, 96% of New Zealand's market? You guys aren't making your money off milk, you're making it off Fonterra's payouts."
farming,3bxr82,wainui,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:47:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know that you really addressed the point I was attempting to make. I wanted to show how selective the article was in using NZ agriculture when it suited them but made the completely inaccurate statement that all other developed countries provide subsidies and trade protection for agriculture when in fact NZ has not done since the 1980's. I don't believe that this point has anything to do with Fonterra at all. As a matter of interest I Fonterra collects around 88% of total (bovine) milk solids produced in NZ and this is currently falling (not different enough from your comment to make a difference, I just like numbers). As to your other points, COOL labelling is a political issue for the countries in question. I can only guess that they wish to label things this way because the want to leverage off our reputation in some markets for food quality and safety. You can ship milk if you don't own shares. I supply milk to another company called synlait, Westland (another cooperative is active locally), Tatua is another cooperative up north, Miraka is a company owned by indigenous tribes + many more local niche processors. There are areas in which Fonterra is the only option however these are small. I'm sorry but I don't understand what you mean by your last statement. We own Fonterra, it's a wholly supplier owned cooperative. It doesn't recieve subsidies and yes we make our profit from the money they pay us. That's the idea of a cooperative. Of course we make many off their payouts, thats the whole idea of owning the processor you supply. Without them then we would end up like farmers in the UK, getting paid below the most minimum of production costs simply so that supermarkets can go to war with each other using milk as a loss leader."
farming,3bxr82,dairyguy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:50:50 2015 UTC,Exactly. I hate when people think the New Zealand dairy market is superior. Fonterra owns you. They control the market. It's no different than the milk marketing board controlling the milk market. The same result occurs however we are too close to the US to profit from such a deal like New Zealand since the US milk would flow north and flood all the Canadian producers out.
farming,3bxr82,wainui,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:29:53 2015 UTC,"G'day dairyguy. I'd just like to say that as someone who has come to dairy from sheep farming here the arrogance of many within the NZ dairy sector is staggering. I do not think that the NZ style of dairying should be flogged around the world as some are attempting to do and I think I'm really lucky to have been taught in a system that has taken all its inspiration from you guys in fact. Canadian genetics rock my world and grass is only as good as the person managing it. Your comments touch upon some very complex issues and I know that I will not even get close to outlining all of the opinions that I hold here but I would like to give a brief rebuttal. Fonterra is the greatest pillar of strength in our agricultural economy. Without a national cooperative that is mandated to take our milk if we want them to then we would be wholly vulnerable to overseas owned processors that would have no incentive to pay us what our milk is worth. As it currently stands all non-cooperative processors in NZ have to closely match Fonterras payout otherwise they would have no supply obviously. And with Fonterra being a cooperative this generally means a good return for us. The competition that these other companies provide is also essential however and has stimulated a great amount of innovation from Fonterra as they have greatly fallen behind in the market of value added products. All in all I think we've got a great mix in our markets here that epitomises the benefits of free market capitalism. As to your last comment about US milk flowing north mate, have a look into some economic theory, I'm not gonna be the one to give you the hard word, but if you can't compete then you need to get better rather than imposing a cost upon consumers. Believe me we went through this with meat in the 80's and it was the greatest thing our country has ever done (Rogernomic's if you're interested). It has been the single greatest catalyst behind our dairy boom. Fonterra is nothing in comparison"
farming,3bxr82,dairyguy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:04:41 2015 UTC,"After re-reading my comment I realize the part about US milk it might be overstated. There are many Canadian cooperatives, especially in Ontario and Quebec, that would be able to hold their own against US competition. Gay Lea is one that is quite good here in Ontario. They are aggressively buying processors in order to increase their capacity to handle all their members milk so they can handle all of it in the event that the milk board is abolished. Personally I think that is something that will happen in the next 10 - 20 years with increasing pressure from international trade talks and agreements. Regardless of the system it would be hard to compete against the US due to the sheer volume of milk they produce. I can see quality being a potential roadblock but may only block some milk from being imported as the US SCC limit is 750,000 while Canada's is 400,000. If only we could graze our cows all year round we could lower our costs and compete that way too. :p"
farming,3bw2g9,Canadairy,3,Thu Jul 2 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"First to scientifically write about it more or less. Since there were domesticated sheep, oxen, cattle, pigs, and chickens at this point, there had been systematic breeding before this time. It just was not put in terms based on evolutionary theory or significantly science based.   Goats, sheep, and cattle had been bred for such traits as wool quality, milk production, strength, etc before this. Probably with less science behind it,but it was done bone the less."

farming,3bw2g9,not_whiney,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, important in modern agriculture. But we like to have a point in time, a person with a face, a specific document to point to and say, ""This! This is the starting point."" But in reality there is no real one person, place, or time that is modern agriculture. And even when you say agriculture, do you refer to crop science, livestock, forestry, etc?  There is a continuous improvement and change in agriculture. There some inflection points in it at certain times. But the fact that people were breeding and improving livestock by breeding the best, biggest bulls to the best milk producing and or biggest, best heifers for a long time before he wrote down what he was doing. One of the major changes in animal husbandry was the advent of faster, more reliable travel. Much of the time attempts to bring stock to cross breed in areas was simply prevented by the fact that it took so long to get there many animals got eaten on the way.   To tell you the truth while taking a bunch of ag classes and looking at a bunch of farm startups, example farms, etc one of the clear differences between productive, successful farms and not is how well they record keep and how well they use those records for future planning.

QED"
farming,3bqyky,crackerhonkey,4,Wed Jul 1 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"They're looking at replacement rates.  If 95,000 quit farming but only 1,220 start farming in that same period, then that's a net loss.    You aren't seeing land owners beating down your door because people are farming ever larger amounts of land and because you live in the wrong place.  Lots of land in my area is going unfarmed because of a combination of last year's drastic cotton price drop putting people out of business, reticent lenders not willing to let farmers farm to much new land, and the uncertainty in the cotton market this year.  I'm personally farming twice as much land as last year.  You can't look out your window and assume that's how it is everywhere in the country.  Trying to QED such a self-centered worldview is ridiculous.    There is a growing farmer shortage and I suspect land prices will be falling over the next 10 years as a result.  And GMOs are basically going to be the only way to maintain production levels.  That and I bet a lot more major companies are going to be taking over production practices.  Americans in general don't like manual labor.  You'll notice that no feminist groups are pushing hard to get women into agriculture."
farming,3bqyky,arachis_hypogaea,3,Wed Jul 1 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"but 95,000 to the 1,220 is a poor comparison because it doesnt count any farmer under 35 who isn't the 'principle operator' of his operation.  so what about the many families whose ~75 yr old principle is retiring, the ~50 yr old son is taking over and the ~25 yr old son is returning to the farm.  No loss of farmer there, but according to their calculation it would be.  In a high-capital, low cash-flow game like ag, its generally not possible for a young guy to get the financing he needs to farm some of his own so he works as a hired man; still farming.  I've been lucky enough to be one of those 1220 guys but my situation is farm from typical.  and as others have also pointed out, I dont think that land is sitting vacant because of lack of farmers, its the dollars and cents.  If established farmers aren't moving in to those areas because it's not profitable, then it certainly isn't a good idea to push for policy to help guys with no equity and/or limited experience into those situations.  Bad for lenders to lend to a crappy business model and bad for the borrower cause he has the debt and the crappy business model."
farming,3bqyky,crackerhonkey,3,Thu Jul 2 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"My anecdotal view out my window is in the Southern Tier of New York.  There is land available all over the place here.  At $41/acre per year tax burden there is an enormous overhead to become a large producer.  I am desensitized now, at 34 years old, but in the past decade there had been times where a half hour drive in any direction would almost bring me to tears.  So many farms have gone vacant.   Now the barns are starting to fall in...everywhere.    One neighbor to the West lets me farm 35 acres for free.  My neighbor to the south wanted me to farm his land for free (149 acres).  I did for two years but simple could not afford to cover that much land with my equipment and seed costs.  (2008 fuel costs too).   On my road, that is eight miles long, there used to be ten farms scattered the entire length.  Now I am the only active farm on this entire road. There is only one other piece of farm land getting worked by a large producer.  I miss my neighbors.  I miss the gossip and knowing that I am not the only one trying to farm Steuben County soil.  Our area raised a lot of kids and sent them out into the military and workforce.    There is plenty of land.  We need people.  I need community."

That land isn't fallow because of a lack of farmers, its fallow because it's marginal land in an era of small profit margins. You say yourself that even when use of land was offered to you free, it wasn't worth doing. How do you think new farmers would be able to do better when they'd have to pay for land one way or another? New farmers would go the same way as the old ones did: bankrupt, sold out because they were sick of working for fuckall, or their kids would leave because there wasn't enough fuckall to support two families.   The only way that land will be worth farming and attract new farmers is a) food costs skyrocket - I'm talking like 30% of household income, not the 9-11% it is currently, or b) an Amish community sells their expensive land some where else and moves there so that Jacob, Peter, Paul, Luke, Matthew, and John can all have their own farm."

It's like that all over the state but for some reason sadder down there, driving down the road and every 1000 yards seeing a once-viable dairy farm that supported a family and probably 7 or 8 kids with maybe 25 milkers. The problem is the industry moved to a kind of dairying that doesn't work on those soils, now we need at least 200 cows, freestall, corn silage, alfalfa, and lots of road traffic. The shitty part is that landscape is where we really should be dairying, because it grows grass sustainably and wouldn't need much tillage and we could set aside more arable acres for row crops in other parts of the state, has a nice climate for cows living outside, lots of natural water. It looks like so many of the historically famous dairy regions of europe, and I hope that's the long-term salvation of some of the farms down there, they can start making niche products that pay for the expense of farming the less productive land, because it's not more resource-consuming, its just that they are competing against flatlanders who can burn up more diesel faster and make more milk cheaper. The area needs to attract young, idealistic entreprenuers that don't know too much about how farming is done. They are out there, and the southern tier is on their map because it's beautiful, close to markets, and land is cheap (er, rent is cheap comparatively)."

But my main point:  Mendocino County, California and Jackson County, Oregon have a ban on GMO crops. North Dakota and Montana have a ban on GE Wheat. Boulder, Colorado a city has a ban on GE crops also.  Look. I agree that the Anti-GMO people are nuts. I've been accused of being a Monsanto shill more than once on reddit.

By popular vote the island wanted to ban GMOs. Two large GMO test fields & labs are on the island (Dow and Monsanto). Banning GMOs would mean losing their business, as well as jobs they provided.  The judge rules it invalid. This is obviously going to be declared by the anti-GMO crowd that there was evidence of pressure from Monsanto and Dow.  The question is... if Monsanto and Dow weren't on the island - would the judge have made that same decision?  Hawaii is a great site for GMO testing since they can grow year-round. An AMA recently by a Monsanto scientist said they can grow a lot of seed in a small area of land that they can't do anywhere else in America.

Your farm runs the program. You have set work days/times and set market days. Groups sign-up and as part of the fundraising (aka working the market) they also participate in an education program (aka working on the farm).

farming,3bnfab,rednuck,5,Tue Jun 30 19:46:31 2015 UTC,The biggest issue I have with A&W as a Canadian Beef Farmer is that they import a lot of their product from Australia and South America rather then pull supply locally. The second issue I have is that they think organic makes a superior product rather then investing in a personal relationship with farmers that produce beef in their ideals rather then just thinking because a product is organic is cleaner then conventional beef. There is fair more hormones in cabbage then there is in beef even with hormones used in production improperly (using hormones too close to slaughter date)

farming,3bl3o0,sbharnish,2,Tue Jun 30 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"I was raised Catholic now agnostic and honestly  Mennonites are so confusing to me.  Catholics have one church, one set of rules.  You guys have new rules every 1/2 mile.  Especially the old order one near us.  I just don't get most of the rules either.  I mean why would God care if my pants have a zipper? A couple weeks ago I saw an Amish guy chopping haylage with a horse and gas motor powered chopper.  Is a gas motor ok as long as they work in horse?  I'm prob too much of a rebel and would have been shunned."
farming,3bl3o0,Octavia9,2,Wed Jul 1 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question goes back to the roots of the Anabaptist movement.  Both the Catholic and Reformed churches in 16th century Switzerland/Germany/Holland were highly integrated with civil government.  When the ""radical reformers"" started baptizing adults and refusing to baptize their infant children they were subject to being tortured, drowned, or burned at the stake until they repented. Even in places that weren't as extreme they were still subject to having their land confiscated and given to the Catholic/Reformed church.  This started an deep institutional distrust of both civil government and centralized church structure.  My ancestors saw the writing on the wall and migrated to the wild frontier just west of Philadelphia where they found fertile farmland in 1709.  Other groups went to Russia, Mexico, Belize, Uraguay, Paraguay, etc. Wherever they moved they tended to form colonies rather than try to integrate into the local societies.  They tend to keep their original language, often only becoming bilingual in the last few generations.  The Mennonites in OP's article had to move multiple times.  The colony mentality meant that they came up with rules in order to keep up their religious beliefs.  You might think of them as walls that repress the population by keeping them stuck in their society, but they would characterize them as fences that give them freedom to live comfortably without any danger of straying.  There are no gray areas to cause controversy if everyone agrees what is right and wrong.   In the large, North American settlements whenever change came along congregations tended to split and form new groups since there was no central authority keeping everything in line.  It's a model that works well with high birth rates and low losses by defection. The congregation where I attend started in 1756, but because of divisions every generation or so has spawned a few distinct offshoots.  We dropped German in the late 1800s, in the 50s a group left that still dresses in plain clothes, in the 70s the hippies went out and formed their own churches elsewhere.   Right now my variety of mennonite has no formal or informal restrictions on dress/technology/farming practices/etc.  Hopefully we stand out for our generosity, compassion, kindness, etc. instead of the length of our beards or the design of our buggies.  I'd be interested in the /u/MennoniteDan take on all of this."

farming,3b8zur,sprocket,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:12:49 2015 UTC,Looks best suited to a small scale operation since there are more pieces that cover a shorter distance than standard irrigation piping. You would probably be doing more lugging per inch of water because this k-line covers a small area.  If irrigation pipes are simply too heavy for you it would be a good idea to change to a different system but the k-line isn't necessarily the right one unless it makes economical sense.

farming,3b5239,CassieJK,6,Fri Jun 26 01:03:36 2015 UTC,< 2 truckloads.
farming,3b5239,shashybaws,4,Fri Jun 26 04:40:49 2015 UTC,"This is actually an easy question to answer on at least one level. A truckload of milk is worth what someone will pay for it. How much is that? Well, we got paid $17.35 per every hundred pounds of milk we shipped last month (a hundredweight, or 100 pounds, is the standard unit for bulk milk). Most states place an 80,000 pound limit on a loaded milk truck (trailer, tractor, and milk). A truckload is generally somewhere between 7,000-8,000 gallons, which works out to 60,000 - 68,000 pounds of milk. Multiply that out and you have a range from $10,440 to $11,936.   Some years see a much stronger milk price (last year it was over $25 per hundredweight for a bit), so the value of a load can rise and fall.  Now, that is one way of looking at the value. Another way would be to assess how much is cost the farmer to make. That is a nigh-impossible question to answer well, since farms vary in design so much. Most farms have a sense of where that cost is, but it can vary a lot, along with the profitability of the individual farms."
farming,3b5239,Grrizzzly,2,Fri Jun 26 08:39:49 2015 UTC,"Depends on the size of the truck, the composition of the milk, and what the current price is. Loaded, I think the truck that picks up my milk will hold ~$22 000 worth."
farming,3b5239,Canadairy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"market price * weight of milk.    As a rough approximation, milk is about 8lbs per gallon  organic milk is selling for 38/cwt ($38 per 100lbs, roughly $3/gallon) in this area to the coop  No idea what the truck holds.  3000 gallons?  10000?"

I'm guessing it's gonna take a while longer than 3 profitable years to recoup the fixed costs.

""Using Cover Crops Profitably"" is the best thing I've come across for understanding how to make cover crops work, but it's also basically a textbook.  The book above and ""Building Soils for Better Crops"" have drastically changed how I view farming.  I'm in the process of changing my entire operation because of those 2 publications, both of which are available for free download.  I'm just having difficulty finding relevant information for making no till with cover crops work in my county.  Nobody really invests much time or money into us because we aren't growing corn or soybeans and we don't get much rainfall."

If i lived in Illinois i'd be planting cover crops in my soybean stubs before the combine was out of the field. However, where i'm at they really struggle. I cant reliably recover the moisture that they use. The ""experts"" say i can, but they arent from here. They're either from somewhere with more rainfall, or somewhere with less heat (and therefore less arid)."

We usually catch enough moisture to germinate the seed before a freeze.  I've also noticed some benefits that may balance the water usage.  All of our cotton in cover crops have received no static damage from blowing sand, provided we let the cover grow enough to still be standing tall after termination.    I'm going to experiment with covers a little more on my better irrigated land before I try anything on dryland.  There may also be reduced evaporation, but I'm checking that out with soil moisture probes this year.  We'll see.  People who get 50"" of rain a year and/or have cool summers don't really understand how little margin for error there is in arid environments.

Specifically, we tell those people we're okay with taking some they are free to take some.  Some random idjit driving down the highway isn't going to be privy to an arrangement made between two parties they're unfamiliar with.  So, maybe it's stealing and maybe it's not.

Buy your farm then, but don't quit your day job - most farmers work a full-time town job and farm in addition to that.    If you save $500 a month starting at age 20, and assuming a return of 6%/year (average for the stock market)... well, you figure it out.  Use this link:    http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/roi-calculator.aspx  Looks like $270k to spend on a farm in 20 years, assuming zero dollars now and an investment of $500 a month, adjusted for inflation."

Everyone loses, the public that they are trying to ""protect"" and even the companies that are supporting these laws get hurt financially in the long run.

Some kind of pricing guidelines would be nice. Many businesses have a maximum they're willing to pay for produce so it would be useful for producers to know what they can get for their produce by using your app. Some sort of mileage radius would be useful as well since many local growers can't afford to deliver produce to destinations hours away. As was said already the ability to add photos, social network tie-ins, invoice and tracking would be huge too.  From a business owner perspective (I'm speculating here - I don't own a store or restaurant) I think they would want to know when they could expect things to be in season and what kind of quantities they could expect. They'd also want to know what prices producers are asking for their produce.   You should look into the ""food hub"" programs that are growing in popularity.

farming,3aeomc,muupeerd,11,Tue Jun 23 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"Today's corn cultivars are F1 hybrids made by crossing 2 pure parental lines. The F1 has hybrid vigor or also called the heterosis effect. It basically means the hybrid combines characteristics of the parental lines in a way that make the hybrids yield more or be stronger, or overall increase agricultural value (1+1=3). Now creating a hybrid from 2 pure parental lines creates a hybrid that is identical, which means every seed is pretty much identical. Which is nice since all plants react the same way, are ready for harvest the same time, need water the same time, react to pests the same way (good and bad). However, if you take seeds from these hybrids and sow them the plants are not identical and since parental lines often are weak and have different characteristics very weird combinations of characteristics can come out which usually reduces the yield and agricultural value a lot.    That's the genetic side, now seed technology wise. Seeds produced by seed companies are produced in such a way that the seeds are disease free, contain lots of sugars/oil=energy. The seeds often also are sorted by size removing weaker or too big ones that help sowing and uniform emergence of the sprouts. The seeds are sorted by removing ''death'' seeds or seeds that are not fertile. The seeds are also stored in a way that are optimal for the seeds. And the companies test the seeds and will only sell seeds that have a 95% chance of sprouting (getting 100% is nearly impossible). The seed companies also often prime seeds which basically is letting the seeds sprout in such a way that they will only begin the process of forming a little sprout within the seed, this greatly reduces the time you can store the seed, however will increase the sprouting time by a week or more after sowing and will also increase uniformity of the sprouting a lot."

Size like that becomes a liability rather than a benefit. As machinery has gotten so massive, the structure and flexibility requirements have skyrocketed. A dozen 2 row planters would be drastically simpler than one 24 row one. Furthermore, if a robot tractor the size of an ATV went haywire and drove off into a ravine, it's a LOT easier to recover than if a 600+ hp machine drives itself into a river with a million dollars in machinery behind it."
farming,3act2l,Thornaxe,2,Fri Jun 19 03:16:48 2015 UTC,I doubt many farmers feel that way since prairies dominated by control traffic farming whether they realize it or not. 100 foot drill fits well into program of many guys though 90 foot prefered since you can run all your machines on the same trams. There's a lot of farmers I know would prefer 120 foot drill since they they have a 120 foot sprayer and 40 foot headers.
farming,3act2l,SgtRelyk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:39:52 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. A fleet of tiny machinery doesnt make your dick look bigger the way a massive machine does. Farmers are very conscious of the appearance of their dicks.  Controlled traffic farming was created to limit the compaction of massive machinery was it not? It isnt used in my area, so i'm legitimately asking this. The idea is to sacrifice a small area of the field to decreased yields b/c of equipment traffic, while sparing the rest of the field.  With the elimination of much of the structure (and therefore weight) of massive machinery, could smaller robotic equipment reduce or potentially eliminate the advantage of a control traffic farming setup?"
farming,3act2l,Thornaxe,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"Yes thats the idea of controlled traffic farming is to sacrifice the smaller part for the greater good, and with a piece of seeding equipment totalling hundreds of thousands pounds (70-80 for tractor, 110-130 for cart, 40-50 for toolbar, plus liquid and anhydrous towed behind that) with another 60 thousand of sprayer per pass and 60 thousand for a combine and grain cart (70-80 for tractor and 90-110 for cart).  Robotic farming may replace controlled traffic farming, but I have my doubts since you'll pretty much have to be an engineer to work and fix the robots (as in interstellar lol). Unless they make it modular based (like cx6 smart seeder) then I don't see it becoming mainstream and I don't really want to give up the keys to my tractors even though their driven by military satellites.

farming,3abob7,MennoniteDan,2,Thu Jun 18 20:09:36 2015 UTC,"Aside from GMO herbicide resistant traits (glyphosate and liberty) and a few others like clearfield wheat, most all of our selective herbicides are dependant on the crop growing faster than the weeds. This allows the crop to metabolize the chemical poisons better than the weeds, so the crop flourishes while the weeds die. Aggressive usage (i'm not gonna necessarily say overuse) of chemicals has selected for weeds that grow better, faster, and can metabolize more chemicals........sound like our (farmers) problem pigweeds to anyone else?"
farming,3abob7,Thornaxe,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"What?  You aren't seriously saying that humans drastically altered the genome of Palmer Amaranth in just a few decades, are you?  Seriously?  Not only is that not how most selective herbicides work, Palmer Amaranth has been one of the fastest growing, most broadly adaptive plants for centuries.  Ancient cultures used to cultivate Palmer and other Amaranth species for food in part because it was fast growing and broadly adaptive.  If farmers had managed to drastically alter the genome that fast, out would be international news.  Adaptation never makes changes that big that fast.  When you finally understand that Palmer had glyphosate resistance before the invention of glyphosate, you might finally come to understand why Palmer is a problem weed.    Palmer's ability to adapt quickly is based on the fact that it creates a relatively high number of mutations per generation.  That's not something you can select for through herbicide use.  Which is separate from these researchers discovered.  If you had bothered to read the article, you'd already know that."
farming,3abob7,arachis_hypogaea,3,Fri Jun 19 05:05:13 2015 UTC,"Where did i say farmers altered the genome of Palmer?  Many of our selective herbicides DO depend on the crop metabolizing them (atrazine for example), or require the crop to ""grow out"" of the damage applied (Aim, Cadet). These herbicides still work quite well on many weeds, but pigweeds (Palmer, w/e) are now ""growing out"" of the herbicides just like the crops are.  While you're right that glyphosate tolerant individual plants existed prior to our usage of glyphosate, there are also other mechanisms of chemical tolerance than mutation spawned immunity. Partially controlled weeds at the edge of a field provide ample opportunity for plants that can survive small chemical dosages better to reproduce better and alter the next generation's genetics.   I read the fucking article, douchebag. Get off your high horse. Their conclusions were that Palmer can break down Callisto better at higher temperatures. Whatever enzyme Palmer has to do it is functioning better at higher temperatures."
farming,3abob7,Thornaxe,-2,Fri Jun 19 07:02:29 2015 UTC,"""Many"" and ""most"" have 2 different meanings.  Your first comment said ""most"", but now it's ""many""?  Which is it?  The primary method of resistance development in Palmer Amaranth is mutation spawned immunity.  Survival because of non-lethal doses of chemical rarely introduces immunity into successive generations.  If it did impart resistance on a regular basis, we would have glyphosate resistant Russian Thistle throughout the southwest.  We don't.  If you read the article, then why would your rant about Palmer resistance development be relevant at all?  The American southeast is the only place with rapid resistance development to a multitude of chemicals because they overused each chemical.  Everywhere else resistance development has progressed slowly because of sound agronomic practices and a strong IPM program.  There was never a situation in which Palmer wasn't going to develop resistance to some chemical or another.  Monsanto knew Palmer resistance would develop before they released Roundup Ready soybeans.  They just expected it would take longer.  And it did take longer everywhere but the southeast."
farming,3abob7,arachis_hypogaea,3,Fri Jun 19 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"I dont think you can honestly say that other regions have sound agronomic practices and strong IPM programs. All the no-till guys in my area use glyphosate at least 4-6 times per year depending on the crop. There are still a few guys around using it exclusively (no tank mixes) and their fields are showing it.  That said, my original comment was somewhat off topic, and more a comment about pigweeds in general being able to overcome chemical better than they used to. Many, most or few, i have personally seen selective chemicals (atrazine, aim and cadet among them) that work progressively poorer as the years go by. Just as there are mutated palmer with the ability to withstand glyphosate, are there not mutated palmer with higher growth rates or higher enzyme levels to detoxify these chemicals? These individual plants are more likely to survive a spray application (particularly a partial dose) and the next generations would likely share their toughness and growth rates.  Is that not a fair assumption?"

farming,3a7div,lesspub,4,Wed Jun 17 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"The terminal velocity of rainfall is ~28mph IIRC from college. The act of these droplets slamming onto bare soil will collapse pores at the surface of the soil. Having anything above the soil to absorb the impact (crops, crop residue, weeds, etc.) prevents the soil structure from being destroyed. When the soil pores stay open, they will soak away more water. That's the principle.  That said, no-till or conservation tillage DOES cause more crop residue to wash away during a significant rainfall event. If a farmer disks the crap out of his fields several things happen: 1) some of the residue is buried, which prevents it from washing away. 2)The residue rots faster, meaning theres less of it in the long run. 3) What residue is left is generally smaller in nature, meaning it wont bind up as badly when going through culverts/tubes/bridges.  There will be more crop residue clogging drains as farmers adopt more conservation practices (no-till or minimum tillage). There is also more crop residue out in fields than there was 30 years ago because average productivity has gone up significantly since then. The tonnage of stover on an acre of corn is directly linked to the grain production.  That said, theres some truth to what that board commissioner is saying, but honestly IMO he's simply trying to pass the buck on responsibility."
farming,3a7div,Thornaxe,2,Thu Jun 18 02:29:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know many farmers who strictly follow a no-till philosophy, but I always thought part of the idea behind it was that it didn't wash as much stuff into the drains."
farming,3a7div,Everyday_Im_Stedelen,4,Wed Jun 17 20:54:51 2015 UTC,I think the idea is that with no till the residue stays on top so when you get a big goose drowner it runs off and clogs things up.  However if you did some tillage the residue gets incorporated into the soil and doesn't run off.  You of course still get soil erosion.   There isn't one perfect tillage system.  Everyone  needs to remember that and use what works best for their specific field conditions.
farming,3a7div,ExorIMADreamer,3,Wed Jun 17 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much it.  Every fall/winter/spring, I need to clear all the catch basins that are near the path of water flow off my corn ground. The loose stover will (read: does) completely block off the inlet and end up backflooding the area. Or, even worse, start eroding around the basin and create a massive eroded area."
farming,3a7div,MennoniteDan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:09:05 2015 UTC,"That's not the idea with no till at all.  The idea is that the residue makes the soil more porous, which increases infiltration and decreases runoff.  People run no till on more than just corn acres in the Midwest.  The benefits are universal, not crop specific."
farming,3a7div,arachis_hypogaea,3,Thu Jun 18 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"The soil is more porous and stays in place; but surface residue is surface residue no matter what the crop. It's the same idea behind the explanation for phos loading of the great lakes (Erie, to be specific). Nutrients are being surface applied in no-till fields, spring rains move those granular nutrients around (typically to waterways, which eventually make their way to the lake).  Get a big/fast/heavy rain, or sudden snow melt, the stuff on the surface is gonna flow."
farming,3a7div,MennoniteDan,-1,Thu Jun 18 11:25:47 2015 UTC,"Nutrients are being surface applied in fields with every kind of tillage, not just no till.    I've run no till in cotton and the residue doesn't move unless it's a huge rain right after stalk shredding.  Mulch till milo stalks don't move no matter how big the rain is.  No till residue in cover crops doesn't move either.  You do realize there are farmers who grow things other than corn on corn on corn, right?"
farming,3a7div,arachis_hypogaea,2,Fri Jun 19 05:42:22 2015 UTC,"You do realize there are farmers who grow things other than corn on corn on corn, right?    Huh? No there aren't! ./eyeroll   What an absurd statement/assumption. For what it matters: I grow a rotation of corn:soy:wheat:veg:repeat and corn:soy:wheat:alfalfa/corn.  That means, at worst, I have fields that haven't seen corn for three years: and I still have residue at my catch basins. Or, I pressume since you grow cotton and milo, you haven't had to deal with 2-3' of snow melting; during a light spring rain with the ground still frozen, and the amount of soil/material that can move (no matter the tillage system).  Yes, nutrients are being surface applied in pretty much ever tillage system. The difference being that tilled soils get less surface runoff/draining of those surface applied fertilizers. In no till systems, P quickly builds up in the top 1/4-1/2"" of the soil structure. Due to the greater number of macropores, the P (disolved/total) follows those pathways to the underlying tile systems (many of witch drain to open ditches and waterways).  Tilled systems, while having a greater potential for different erosion patterns, don't suffer as greatly from the tile off loading as no/min/conservation-till systems.  On a macro scale, all of this could apply to stover management as well.   Although, I wholeheartedly agree with cover crops helping (if not completely alleviating) surface/stover runoff issues."
farming,3a7div,MennoniteDan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:29:28 2015 UTC,"Seems like the consensus is that cover crops help with the problem, but is there also an argument here for leaving stalks standing too rather than processing them to help avoid residue washing into catch basins?"

farming,3a7div,Huggable_E-bear,3,Fri Jun 26 02:04:59 2015 UTC,That was my understanding too. With conventional tillage you see more erosion — tilled soil getting washed away. How much residue really gets washed away by the rain?
farming,3a7div,arachis_hypogaea,-1,Wed Jun 17 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"It depends on when a big rain hits.  If you get a small(er) rain or even snow during the winter, it helps to kind of join the residue with the soil.  Then the residue helps increase the soil porosity and soil moisture storage capacity.  Not a lot of people, even in this sub, seem to understand how no till should work.  Which is a shame.  There's several free ebooks that are practically textbooks for improving soil through conservation tillage, including no till.  There's not really any excuse for not knowing how no till works, what this year being the USDA's year of soil."

Those are ORAL dosages, and chemicals can act way differently when absorbed through the skin (particularly thin skinned areas usually covered by clothing) or mucosal membranes (mouth, nose, lungs). The toxicity of dermal or mucosal absorption are rarely studied and mostly unknown for pesticides. For a somewhat related example, some drugs can be given orally, via injection (shot) or IV, and the dosages for the 3 methods vary wildly.

Now that we have a sprayer with a larger tank, I never go over 8 gal/A with glyphosate alone.  If she lives somewhere that soybeans can be a profitable crop, then she has no justification for 15-20 gal/A rates with glyphosate.  Irrigation isn't the only way agriculture is sucking up water.  Not to mention all the wasted time and extra carbon spewed into the air running rates that high.  And she seems unaware that nearly all pesticides and fertilizers are in carriers when purchased.  It is required by law that all pesticides and fertilizers have the percentage of active ingredient somewhere on the container.

Whole Foods is having people pay to fill out a questionnaire to get a sticker.   Yes, there's a niche for a market of Certified Organic produce that comes in a biodegradable container and run by people who treat their workers fairly... but in my opinion, the Whole Foods Market® Responsibly Grown is not the answer. This is just a gimmick so they can make you to buy Organic from them."

Of course, I'm sure Costco's Responsibly Grown products cost more than even certified organic, but that caters well to Costco's generally middle and upper class customers.  Yet again, no mention of how poor people are supposed to afford this stuff.  Just a general air of condemnation for anyone who won't pay for ethical raised, sustainably grown, fair trade food.

Some family farms are organized as corporations for legal and tax reasons though that skews the numbers and people's views of who is farming out here in the real world."
farming,39wnhc,D_Farmer,24,Mon Jun 15 12:26:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, corporations are buying more land.  Except, it's corporations formed by family operations.  Owning land as an individual exposes you to liability.  Forming a corporation to own the land and equipment limits liability and opens up some bankruptcy options.  It also helps with inheritance when only 1 child farms but the others are inheriting part of the estate.  There's other reasons corporations were formed, but those reasons have slowly gone away.  In the US, we used to have Direct Payments.  These were basically payments the government paid to farmers just for farming.  However, there were limits.  A single entity could only receive so much and a single farmer could only receive payments as part of up to 3 entities.  So, lots of corporations were formed simply to maximize direct payments.  But the 3 entity rule went away in the early 2000's.  So, farmers have been consolidating farmland into fewer corporations.  Direct payments are gone now anyway.  But, the USDA now limits payments to only those materially involved in the farming operation.  This further encourages the formation of corporations as non-involved persons can receive payments in the form of dividends.  The idea that a corporation can be a family owned farming business is basically a foreign concept to people who know nothing about farming.  So, statistics are skewed both out of ignorance and to serve agendas."

farming,39wnhc,kofclubs,5,Mon Jun 15 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Family owned corporations are a very big part of farming, in my experience. Incorperating had many benefits. One thing as mentioned was liability, it took liability from an individual and placed it on an entity that could be structured to save the assets of an individual. The other big plus was inheriting the farm. After a few generations the old farm that might have been a section was now a few acres which made factory workers out of farmers. They did not have enough land to make a living. The misconception that is now common is that every corporation is Monsanto needs to be looked at more closely."
farming,39wnhc,cocuke,8,Mon Jun 15 23:54:11 2015 UTC,"Nebraska here.  Back when corn was at $8/bu, the land buying was getting pretty crazy.  Not sure what it officially topped out at, or if it has went down at all from that number, but $10k/acre for good irrigated ground was pretty much standard.  We had three large entities move in during that time.  One is a vertically integrated, basically factory farm entity.  These guys are heavy hitters.  Came in and bought up everything with a ""maybe its for sale"" sign on it.   Completely renovated three big ass farms, new buildings, re finished and constructed new feed lots, the whole 9 yards.  Brought mainly a group of mexicans in that they rotate in and out.    The other mainly farmground entity came in and bought what the first guy didn't.  Heavy oil and cattle feeding background.  Has been a lot better of an entity to get along with than the first guy.  Last group is the oil tycoon/daddy was a Texas senator pasture guy.  Money is no issue to these people.  Have been great to work with other than the fact that they have bought some of the best pasture in the state and do not at all use it to what it is capable of.  They just don't care.  If anything came up for sale close to them you had better just forget about it because they will own it.  Its been good and bad.  I don't like hiw they have pushed the little guys out and made it impossible to get a bid in.  However they have spent some money renovating these big ranches and farms and its nice to see that way.  All in all, i wish they never would have come.  Nobody will ever be able to afford to buy what they have built other than a similar sized or even bigger entity than they are."

It's probably not that inaccurate of a conclusion, and it's not a problem since they don't have any harmful effects on humans compared to their non-GM counterparts.  If someone wants to avoid GM ingredients, they can look for the non-GMO label. That's what people who want organic food do, that's what people who want vegetarian/vegan food do, that's what people who want kosher/halal food do.

I have to disagree with the efficiency part in particular. Usage of pesticides (particularly herbicides and insecticides) hasnt made my job as a farmer more efficient (as in fewer hours spent working) it has made my gross outputs MUCH higher. You mentioned that a little bit of pollution might be ok if it's feeding a lot of people effectively. I believe chemicals are a good example of this. Yes there are some potential risks from them. Glyphosate probably causes cancer, somewhat. However, that european commission that labeled glyphosate as a probable carcinogen also says being a hairdresser, consuming alcohol and working the night shift probably cause cancer.  The only way i could have my fields as clean without chemicals as i do with them is to employ a shitload of hand labor. AKA, returning farming to its agrarian roots. Unfortunately there isnt enough profit in agrarian farming to support the standard of living that we have in the industrialized world. Some people would like to force farming back to an agrarian setting, but they fail to see how it cannot function as such.  2)You're right about monoculture risk, but i dont think you know enough about the risk management that goes into seed production in the big commodity crops. There are literally armies of corn breeders because good genetics are valuable. The same can be said for our other big crops. I'm more familiar with wheat than other commodity crops and wheat is a particularly good example to discuss since it's yield potential is heavily affected by disease even on a good year. Wheat breeders spend a lot of time and effort having a number of wheat varieties available with varying disease resistances. They also have germ banks with wild ""cousins"" of wheat that can be used to breed in resistances to a specific disease if the need arises. With major commodity crops, there can be an industry dedicated to managing and combating the risk of crop failure due to disease. With a minor crop like bananas, there just isnt enough drive/profit to warrant a solution. Or at least there wasnt prior to banana production getting decimated by a disease that apparently doesnt affect many banana varieties/species. I know very little about banana physiology/reproduction but i bet someone will crossbreed a new variety of banana with good resistance to that fungus.  Your reference to the irish potato famine is quite on point. There were a lot of negative outcomes of that famine. A famine that was created by not necessarily a dependance on one crop for feeding a nation, but on one variety of crop. As it was once explained to me, the entire nation of potato farmers had come to plant one variety of potatoes. This variety was tasty, but had a very thin skin and was therefore susceptible to the potato blight that decimated its production (compare a yukon gold potato to a russet baking potato to understand what i mean). Unfortunately, by the time the potato blight became widespread, potato varieties with a hardier skin that was less susceptible to the blight were unavailable because no one had planted them. I would argue the same point as above, that in a modern ag setting, a major commodity has a safety net of breeding/genetics to prevent such a catastrophe.  3) Your concern about consolidation within the industry is warranted, but i think it is necessary on some level. In order to develop new products or chemicals, there is a massive amount of capital necessary, therefore you just arent going to see a startup company doing that. The same can be said for many industries including big pharma and big oil. It's just the nature of the industry.  4)The focus on short term profits to the potential detriment of long term gain is an issue that Wall Street has yet to grasp. This issue is probably going to get worse before it gets better, and I dont know that it plagues ag any worse than any other industry."

Are you familiar with the practice?
farming,39nutw,Emergency_Ward,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"Mulesing is very common in Australia, as one of the few effective ways to keep super-wrinkly Merino from suffering horribly with flystrike.  I personally do not agree with the practice, which is 100% seperate from shearing.  If she is against mulesing, fine, I feel she has a point, but that is not shearing."
farming,39nutw,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"Mulesing:       Mulesing involves the removal of strips of wool-bearing skin from around the breech (buttocks) of a sheep to prevent flystrike (myiasis).  The wool around the buttocks can retain feces and urine, so tissue that regrows in the place of the removed skin is less likely to attract flies. Mulesing is a common practice in Australia as a way to reduce the incidence of flystrike, particularly on highly wrinkled Merino sheep.  Mulesing is considered by some to be a skilled surgical task  although it may be performed by unskilled persons.

farming,39nutw,Thornaxe,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, so basically they remove enough skin to take the hair follicles with it? Scar tissue (lacking hair follicles) then replaces the skin. This scar tissues doesnt accumulate poop into giant dingleberries then i assume.  Sounds like a fairly harsh practice, but one that has a basis in both economics and animal welfare. Sick/dead animals arent very well off, not to mention their impact on the bottom line.  Sounds somewhat like docking (read: cutting off) the tails of sheep so they dont accumulate a giant ball of poop on it."
farming,39nutw,Emergency_Ward,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mulesing is related to docking in that they are both poop management practices.  Flystrike is horrific and disgusting, the maggots basically just start eating the sheep while it is walking around living life.  Given a choice between the two, mulesing wins hands down.  My point is that I would hope we could maybe find a third option for controlling the insects that would work for large scale producers that currently use mulesing so heavily."
farming,39nutw,Thornaxe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:57:30 2015 UTC,"Flystrike sounds like it would be an issue regardless of herd size. Is mulesing used more commonly with larger producers b/c they cant/dont have the oversight of individual sheep that smaller producers do?  Also, ecologically speaking, the alternatives for controlling flies would (in my mind) be more aggressive use of insecticides. This raises a whole new set of potential problems, and poses a consequence that environmentally conscious people have to remember."

I have extremely tame cows that lose their shit when i run them through a chute to vaccinate them. However, once i'm done and they bolt out of the chute they appear to hold no ill will towards me.

farming,39new8,not_whiney,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:44:56 2015 UTC,"You can answer this question from the bottom up, or the top down.    Bottom up:    it depends on what sort of cattle operation you'd like to run.  One book that I found helpful was  http://www.amazon.com/Grass-Fed-Cattle-Produce-Market-Natural/dp/1580176054/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1434298632&sr=1-1&keywords=raising+cattle+on+grass which talks about the various aspects ofa  cattle operation centering on grass, which is usually the lowest cost way to bring cattle to market.    Another reference I found useful was  http://www.agmanager.info/livestock/budgets/production/beef/Cow-calf_EnterpriseAnalysis(Jun2009)--Revised(Jan2010).pdf but it does not reflect the high (record) prices of cows right now.    If you are buying cattle this year you will be paying dearly for each head; I have never seen prices this high in my lifetime.    I would look at both of those references, and talk to your local sources (other farmers running cows, or ag extension agent) and then based on all of that sit down and answer the following questions:    How many head can this acreage support during the growing season? How much forage will I have to put up for the non-growing season Do I need to build or buy infrastructure - fencing, squeeze chute, stock trailer, ATV, troughs, water, tractor, GATES, etc. Will I need additional manpower during some parts of the season (haying, calving, sale days) where will it come from, and how expensive will it be? how much will it cost me to get the number of cows indicated, and where will i buy them?  If you are just starting with a critter, auctions aren't a great choice for that critter.  you're usually better off finding someone you trust to buy from. It's easier to raise the cows than to sell them.  whats your plan for marketing the beef, and what does that market pay the most for?  if you're cow-calf, for instance, what time of year is the market usually highest, and what weight do people in your area like to buy at?   If you're consumer-direct, how do you reach those consumers and who answers the calls from retail customers?    It's always worth sitting down and doing a spreadsheet that describes your business financially before you spend even a single dollar.    Top down:    What income level do you want to achieve to make your life possible? what's the net margin per unit of production (cow, calf, beef, whatever) Divide the two to get the number of units you need to produce, and add 10% to that production number to give you a margin of error.  Cows die. Then figure out what you need to do to carry that number of cows (see bottom up, above) then refigure your production based on what you find, and you'll have a picture of what you'll need to do."

Reducing the number of people living the Western-style life is an inherently good thing, resource-wise.  I agree that education for women and access to birth control is highly necessary, but I don't see those things developing fast enough to have much of an impact yet.

farming,39ko9o,AnthAmbassador,0,Fri Jun 12 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"I won't even read this. I'm too familiar with the arguments and the data to bother.  Industrial farming, in some ways, has drastically lower footprints due to economies of scale. This is inarguable.  What this argument completely misses is that it is due to our infrastructure that small scale agriculture has a big footprint. You're trying to put a round peg in square hole essentially, and the round peg isn't the right fit. Small scale ag should have nearly zero footprint, and that's the way it was until steam engines changed everything, and we've never gone back.  If you try to do a hybrid of small scale and large scale, and you send your produce to market at a farmers market, or a few fancy stores, you're going to run afoul of a lack of economies of scale.  The problem is not small scale ag, the problem is the entire organization and scale of our population, our cities, our transportation infrastructure. Child labor laws, minimum wage laws, labor and industry, insurance and taxes also play into this in a big way.  It's essentially not a fair comparison.  What we need to do is to create a sense of where ag can happen, and then make a map based on ag potential. Then make a map of transportation potential, especially of rail and river transit, which have enormously smaller impacts on the environment compared to roads and small vehicles.  We need to overlay those maps, and plan our urban centers based on creating a base of consumption, and major services for the ag potential area, in a location that not only links the area to major transit options, but also serves as a hub for light rail local transit, which creates a wagon wheel pattern, with a major urban center at the hub, and minor urban centers spread out so that no part of the ag potential zone is unreasonably far away from an urban center.  Well we don't need to do this, and in some cases canals will be the more reasonable option for connecting the hinterlands to the urban centers. We should do this if we want to create a lower impact society, as it's the most direct route.  If we want to create an actually low impact society, we need to do all these things and we need to reduce population, and while we do it, we need to embrace the economies of scale that currently work in industrial agriculture, to get the most out of what we've developed while we dismantle it, because the transition is not possible without leaning on industrial production.  Wall of text!  edit: missed this point in my ramble: This may sound, or look familiar in some cases, because before cars, this developed naturally due to logistical limits. In some cases, like Chicago being on a river that meets a lake, the urban centers are still there (though most of it's direct hinterlands have been ruined by suburbs). In some cases urban centers were abandoned when transit systems evolved, like Cairo Il.  edit2: I read the article anyways, and just as I expected, it was a very detailed explanation of why intensive industrial production is absolutely necessary to avoid massive starvation, especially as the population grows. Great article, but I hate the thought that we just need to accept 9 billion people on this planet. We already have far too many."
farming,39ko9o,LibertyLizard,2,Fri Jun 12 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"The point of the article was more about the high land use cost of older styles of agriculture. And this is undoubtedly true. Look at the deforestation of the US and Europe: virtually all trees were cut down before the invention of the steam engine.  While what you say is true in terms of things like water use, fertilizer and pesticide runoff, and fossil fuel use, the biggest ecological cost of agriculture is and always has been habitat destruction. I'm not entirely convinced by his argument, since I don't see much evidence that things have slowed down with the advent of industrial ag, but it is an interesting argument. I think the problem there remains to be solved."
farming,39ko9o,AnthAmbassador,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"Well a lot of the deforestation of Europe had to do with firewood and charcoal being the primary sources of fuel, not just with the space needed to run ag, though that obviously played into it."
farming,39ko9o,Thornaxe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"He does bring up the point where land that was once used as marginal farmground in northeastern US has gone back to forests, that's an example of ecological destruction being reversed (somewhat, it's not virgin forest obviously).  You're probably right that things havent slowed down with the advent of industrial ag, however we (agriculture) have been providing an ever increasing supply of calories/nutrition to an ever increasing population. I would assert that the ratio of our land impact to our production has improved drastically since the beginning of industrial agriculture."
farming,39ko9o,LibertyLizard,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that secondary forest in the US has regrown at the cost of primary forest in places like Brazil and Indonesia. Not really an optimal trade.  You are probably right about that, but I wonder what the ultimate result is if all we can do is slow things down by being more efficient. Increased efficiency is part of the solution, but we also need to tackle the problem head on."

farming,39ko9o,AnthAmbassador,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you're talking about... clearly, which is unfortunate. Can you give me an example of a zero impact or positive impact road system?  I can give you an example of an ecologically net positive water system, which requires no high impact technologies, and the great thing is, that the technology is already there. It's called a boat with a stick. BAM. Now you can get agricultural goods from place A to place B, and have zero impact. It's easy, it's cheap, it's good for the environment, and it's fool proof.  Now you give me a counter argument, about how we could do something with roads or something else that requires no fossil fuels, no metal, and no electricity. I'll be sitting here waiting.  edit: that was more rude than it needed to be... but I stand by my points. I don't think it's possible to carry our civilization into the future as it operates currently for another 100 years. It might be 20 years or 50 years or closer to 100 before things start failing in a major way, but failure seems like an inevitability with the way we waste valuable ecological spaces, and my thought process is that if we don't find a way to have a VERY light impact in our methods of living, we are dooming some future generation to a horrible holocaust of civilization's failure. This is morally unacceptable to me.   You can say that pushing a boat around with a stick is no way to live, but it's really exactly that. It's a way to live, that can continue for millions of years. You can even combine some luxury into the system, and have major canals that have a ski-lift-like rope and pulley system that is powered by wind and solar, which allows you to hitch your boat up, and skip the polling and rowing. This is a perfect example of something that is actually low impact. Fish can live in the canals, as can other species forming a complete ecosystem. The water can be aerated too, so that it prevents stagnation, water can be filtered through garden beds, so that plants that will be consumed will take nutrients out of the water and keep it clear by starving out algae. It's a system that can really work if people invest in it's maintenance, and it can work forever, and it's easy, it's enjoyable, and it's functional as a method or transit. You can't really say this about roads.  Sure roads are fast, and seem convenient, but that's because our society is crafted around cars and trucks, and so they fit into our model. That creates a certain unreasonable need to over consume and over impact the world, because only ways of living that involve over use of resources and the degradation of the ecology seem feasible. Ultimately, I think that people would be happier on the canal system, and they would be healthier too, so long as there were a few less people. I think it's crazy to make a bunch of unhappy people when we could have many happy people instead, as long as we were willing to live within the constraints of the ecology, which is something that we'll be forced to do eventually anyways."

farming,39ko9o,AnthAmbassador,-1,Sat Jun 13 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not designing your village, not sure where you got that idea.  If you look back, I make it quite explicit that in SOME cases, light rail is going to be a more expensive and higher impact system than a canal system. I don't really think that you're making a point here, other than that you're not interested in taking my points seriously.  Not that I need to make this point, but where you have a canal in the summer, you have a frozen sled way in the winter.  Is some disruption possible, of course. When you plan around long term sustainability and low ecological impact, you make some sacrifices. You don't get rid of all of the bad things without giving up some convenience."

Not sure about this, don't really know if it's nature or nuture, but I'm often thinking about things over centuries, instead of just in the here and now.  I think when things start failing, people will start realizing that the current model is not great, and that we need to plan more. The sad thing is that the longer we wait, the harder the transition will be, the more expensive, and the more likely that population decrease will be through war, famine and pestilence and not through civil and gradual reductions."

The risks from drinking raw milk are low, but still there.  What gets farmers like /u/Canadairy and I up in arms is when raw milk proponents completely ignore that actual outbreaks do happen. In April '15 there we outbreaks in PA (in my county) NY and WA of Salmonella and Listeria.  It's not common, but completely preventable and gives Dairy an undeserved reputation for being unsafe.  I drink raw milk every day, but I still understand how contagious disease works don't advocate for sales to the general public."

farming,39ojj4,sbharnish,6,Sat Jun 13 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"I know I won't be about to convince you to not sell raw milk. But what I will do is encourage you to invest in really, really good testing equipment.  We started selling our raw milk into the Seattle area. People were crazy for it. We were about your same size, milking 4 cows. We tested every batch that we bottled. I was (yes, was) a huge raw milk advocate. Things were looking amazing for my future as a young, up and coming farmer to take over our micro dairy as I got older.  We got a phone call that a kid was in the hospital and they tested his stool sample and linked ecoli to our milk in their fridge. ""How could that be?"" We thought, ""we test every batch!"" We got another call. Another kid is in the hospital. Oh my, this isn't a freak thing, now there are multiple cases. 3 children were hospitalized and multiple people were sickened, thank God no one had lasting damage or died. We had no idea how it happened to this day. We did exactly what that article said to do. We were a super clean set-up.  We never got sick. We were farmers and have great immune systems. But the smaller the population of farmers gets, the more people have no immune system to bacteria that will be in raw products. All it takes is one bad test, or one tired day when you miss something.  According to the United States Centers for Disease Control between 1998 and 2011 79% of the dairy related outbreaks were due to raw milk or cheese products.[40] They report 148 outbreaks, 2,384 illnesses (284 requiring hospitalizations) as well as 2 deaths due to raw milk or cheese products during the same time period.  Be very very careful.  P.S. after we got sued and were forced into bankruptcy, I've been working hard to rebuild for the last 8 years and we are finally seeing our lives turn around. We still farm and milk and pasteurize and process our own milk. We don't do anything with raw milk."

I manage rangeland in the SW, and there is such great divide in the local, state, and national conversations about how what land is used and by whom. Creating a nation-wide policy on 'giving land' to potential and actualized farmers will only benefit one region at a time, based (IMO) on the percentage of public land that state or region has, and what traditional uses of that land (private or public) is: are the private lots by and large developed into suburbs? Or are they management 10-acre plots? Is the public land traditionally mined, timbered, ranched, or 'protected'?"

But I agree with you on the inevitable ""one size fits all none"" outcome. I'm still torn on the argument over transferring federal public land to the states, but all in all I believe (and have found, though conversations with my ranchers and others) that with more steward (that is, ""user"") participation in the deliberations over land use, the lands wouldn't have to switch hands but the management would change drastically. Likewise, if the community could offer parcels of arable land to local farm operations, this issue of a lack of land - and a dearth of farmers - could be at least positively addressed for a time."
farming,39aopp,I_pet_pigs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"If we don't need fuel corn, then why are people growing it?   All gasoline needs a stabilizer.  It used to be lead.  Now it's a chemical made by 1 single company in England.  They pretty much got to charge whatever they wanted for awhile.  Ethanol works as a stabilizer in gasoline.  It can be used to replace the stabilizer made by a monopoly power in England.  That's why some gas pumps tell you the gasoline has a small amount of ethanol.  Ethanol helps break the power of an international monopoly and slightly lowers the price of gasoline.  We're also now able to make ethanol out of corn and sorghum stubble.  These few facilities turn the cellulose into ethanol.  Which means we can use a part of the plant that must be grown but usually isn't worth much after.  So it's not just ""fuel corn"", like that's a specific variety anyway.  It's a step towards energy independence.  And it's not like any alternatives are made from totally sustainable, infinite in supply, completely ecological friendly sources anyway.  ""Fuel corn"" might not be the best use for public land, but it's hardly unneeded."

I'm 28, but I wouldn't count in that statistic because my dad's (age 54) name is on the license.   This isn't a new thing. The majority of farmers were at one point waiting for dad to hand off. The difference is that health care has improved a lot. Guys that would have had heart attacks in their 60's have surgery instead and farm on another 10-20 years. And they can do that because we have machinery that allows them too. It's not bad riding around in a climate controlled tractor cab compared to open tractors or horses.

Maybe throw some natural vegetation or grow fodder out in that aviary? It's seriously not that hard.

The notion that saved seed is ""better"" for a farm than repurchasing ignores all of these things and just assumes that the average farmer would be able to reproduce the same quality seed for replanting as a seed supplier could provide - which is probably not true at all - and would put all the risk of planting on the farmer regardless.  It also completely takes away the proven benefits of hybrid seed, which is asinine.  It's similar to buying a retreaded tire, only in this case you'd be retreading it yourself.

What a shame. Those plant breeding doctoral students sure are gonna be upset when they find out that they're useless.   All jokes aside, this isn't true. First off, you as a farmer do not have access to the same germplasm a breeder does to find those ""sweet spot"" genes which provide desirable traits. It takes years making crosses and inbreeding to find exactly what you want. A typical farmer does not have the time nor the expertise to do this. It takes a PhD to properly and scientifically breed plants, please look it up. Farmers can't easily make the hybrids, farmers can't easily make the crosses - and if they do, they'll be no where near as productive as a cultivar developed by a plant breeder for a company. I challenge you to compete some worksheets concerning scientific plant breeding so you actually understand what it takes. I'll make them for you and send them your way.   Second, you don't exactly have a microclimate unless you're growing in... a microclimate, such as a greenhouse. A 500-acre field may have tiny, insignificant climate differences, such topography affecting wind, but overall it's going to have the same climate as the zone it is in.

farming,395qcy,ba55fr33k,-9,Thu Jun 11 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"concerns about g.m.foods are valid  the agricorp interests have recently begun an anti-science campaign to block any naysayers by comparing them with climate change deniers (which is really ironic considering people like me, who understood climate change and campaigned to change policy, were jeered by the very same type of dogmatic corporate shills)  science is not static, neither is farming. we are always studying and learning. in science and in farming, if you don't adapt & keep working at problems, you don't survive  by claiming that the 1980's technology that went into 1990's g.m. crops and the hokey approval process is totally safe based on self-reported data is blatantly unscientific and flys in the face of modern knowledge  when g.m. foods were first developed we were mimicking a process from nature where bacteria & viruses sometimes pick up bits of host d.n.a then transfer it to the next host infected. that process in nature didn't end in 1996  weeds growing alongside roundup ready crops have now been found to have incorporated the gene responsible for roundup ready. Alberta Agriculture research has already shown that the bt-toxin gene, which codes for the toxin protein giving plants some insecticidal property, transferrs quite quickly into adjacent feilds. they tested canola feilds and several hundred meters into non-gm crops they found around 4 seeds per square meter of canola which had picked up the bt-toxin gene from neighbouring feilds... in ONE season  farmers know that just 4 seeds per square meter this year means A LOT more next year  don't turn off the science quite yet. anyone who calls the winner early in nature and sits back usually ends up disappointed"

farming,393pqt,optimisticfarmish,3,Tue Jun 9 01:11:12 2015 UTC,"For what its worth, I had not heard of French-intensive gardening until I read this post, so take my advice with a grain of salt.  I have been running a small produce farm for three years. French-intensive does not sound scaleable. We currently have 9000sqft of hoophouses, and 3 acres of outdoor ""garden"". There is no way we could maintain that following the french-intensive method.  If you really want to have great soil, with great drainage, focus on intensive cover cropping for 1-2 years, and make sure you have some tillage radish(reduce soil compaction) and sudan grass(increase biomass) in the mix.  Also make sure you build a relationship with a good soil lab."
farming,393pqt,mikejoconnor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:10:50 2015 UTC,Kind of hard to comment on your system without more information... I also have never heard of french intensive method until now and I think it's probably not an exceedingly profitable way to farm.  As soon as you till your bed you reset the weeds. If you plant your seeds as soon as you till the weeds and your crop will germinate around the same time. If you plant transplants after you till then your crop will have a head start on the weeds and should be easier to control the weeds without hurting your crop.
farming,393pqt,yaharon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:07:31 2015 UTC,"I think Mikejoconnor's comment is good advice, especially if you're looking at growing produce as a predominate source of income.  The most important thing I've learned in the small farming industry is that labor is the limiting factor.  If you want to increase your output focus on finding the most efficient way to accomplish the long list of tasks that end with customer's money in your pocket.    I think any system that has multiple crops taking up the same bed is going to bog you down when it comes time for weed control.  If you're that limited by space I would look for more.    Yaharon's comment about getting a jump on the weeds with plugs is spot on, particularly because you're still pretty new and weeds can be an extreme challenge for even veteran growers.  That being said, starts are cheap to make when you use small plugs (like 128+).  It takes very little potting soil per plant.  There is of course plants that need to be direct seeded, that can also be very cheap (use an Earthway seeder I think there less than $100). One thing that's really important with market gardening is to get your perennial weeds all the way dead before you plant, and have good tilthy beds to work with.  And always get your weeds young, just as they start peeking through the dirt.  One more trick: make your planting bed, wait for the weeds to start popping up then hoe the top 3/4"" and then plant.  Your first round of weeds just got killed. Good luck!"
farming,393pqt,EagleTalons,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if double digging is integral to this method or not, but I think cover cropping is a far more practical way of adding organic matter.  It just takes more time and it doesn't distribute nutrients as deep.    I started market gardening on 3000sqft, doing 6000 this year.  This does not include pathways.  I started everything in trays early inside then outside to coldframes.  I intercrop everything based on how things grow in my soil and climate.  Someone could write a book about it but it would only generally apply outside that specific climate region(E. Coleman, et. al.)  I really can't believe what I spend on Pro-Mix, trays, containers and electricity.  I have 100sqft under coldframes.  I'm considering purchasing a 10x22 ft greenhouse because I want to add another 100x100ft section that is currently fallow. I want to build capital for season extension hoops and subsurface drainage but for now my spring transplants go in a little later and a little bigger.  After getting drainage installed, I'm hopeful my yields will be ""off the charts"", but this won't be true for most people.    http://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm I got lucky.
