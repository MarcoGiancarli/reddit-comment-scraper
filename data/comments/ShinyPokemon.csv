ShinyPokemon,3dwena,PyroThePsycho,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:22 2015 UTC,What Gen is your Unown from? The I & V thing only applies to Gen II.
ShinyPokemon,3dwena,KangasKid18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:39 2015 UTC,"On top of that, both the form and the shininess are defined by IVs, so really the odds of finding a shiny Unown are the same 1/8192 as any other."

ShinyPokemon,3dwena,Crimzonlogic,2,Mon Jul 20 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"I've bred plenty of pokemon by Masuda method with shiny charm in X. I could say that I've had good luck and gotten some within a hundred or so eggs, but I've also gotten plenty only after 1000 or more eggs, so I think my luck with breeding is about average. Having a lot of them might sound like luck, but I've put literally hundreds of hours into hatching eggs so that's why I have a lot. My in-game time counter maxed out at 999 hours at the beginning of the year and it's still going without even recording further play time. The vast vast vast majority of that time is egg-hatching for shinies.(I am kinda obsessed, I know...).  My luck with wild random encounters, however, has been great through the years. Aside from the gen 5 games in which I found zero, I've found multiple shinies each gen without trying to hunt them(None in gen 1, obviously). The only shiny that I ever failed to catch was a Safari Zone Rhyhorn in Fire Red. A week later the RNG gods made it up to me by showing me a shiny Nidorino in the Safari Zone, and I caught it. In my original Silver version, I found two shiny Zubat. What are the odds of that? I got a blue Ponyta in Pearl, which had to be my favorite shiny prior to gen 6's breeding bounty. I found plenty of other random ones but I think those are the most notable ones before I started breeding.  The most lucky catch was a 4IV protean frogadier in the Friend Safari. FS pokemon are guaranteed to have two flawless IVs off the bat, but what are the freaking odds of getting a shiny with four flawless stats and its hidden ability? Insane! That was astounding luck! His nature could have been better, but it's not one that hinders his attacking stats so even that is pretty good about it. His missing IVs are in defense, so his attacks are pretty much unhindered in battle, though none of his offensive stats are boosted by the nature. I can use this greninja in wi-fi battles! To have an almost-competitive wild-caught shiny is absolutely astonishing. Here's a picture. I recently reset its evs and will ev train it properly soonish: http://imgur.com/a/KvKzP  So overall I've had some pretty darn good luck with shinies. I am proud of my army of digital sparklemons."
ShinyPokemon,3dwena,Mollyneonfox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:28:58 2015 UTC,Congratulations on all the shinies! Thats incredibly lucky. Especially with the Frogadier!    You also got it on my birthday :D
ShinyPokemon,3dwena,STUNT1990,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:56 2015 UTC,I found a shiny with pokerus on friend safari. Asuming the rate for shinies on FS is 1/512 and for pokerus the same as always (3/65536) that makes a 1/11184811 chance.. sadly not the shiny I was missing haha

ShinyPokemon,3dwena,AgentHotShot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"My rarest shiny catch is probably a 4IV Munna from the Friend Safari. It's a 1/512 chance for shininess, and the chance of two randomly-generated perfect IVs beyond the two guaranteed ones is 1/322, or 1/1024. That's an overall odds of 1/512 * 1/1024 = 1/524,288.  My first and only 100% random shiny (okay, with Shiny Charm, but still just random in the grass) was a Spinda on Route 113 in Alpha Sapphire, which technically has a 1/683 * 1/4,294,967,295 spot patterns = 1/2,933,462,662,485 chance of being identical to any other Spinda, but that's kind of cheating. :P"

ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,norminthedorm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:55:04 2015 UTC,"Yikes. You did hatch one in the end, though? D:"
ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:56:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I finally hatched one. Totally worth it.
ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,norminthedorm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"The longest I kept track was a noibat, which took a little over 1100.(I loosely keep track, so I don't have exact numbers) I bred many, many mawile and lost count, and that may or may not have been more than the noibat. I gave up on the mawile, it was taking so long...  My current goal is ponyta. I bred at least 600 of them months ago before taking an extended break from breeding shinies. Before trying for that ponyta, I hatched about 800 eevee with no shiny. I don't remember what, but I bred something else before the eevee with no shiny. Now I'm back to shiny breeding months later and trying again with ponyta and I'm at about 400, so I think this one will break my personal record for longest shiny breed...And it has, if you count the eevees. Bummer. I was hoping to get a running start after having a long shiny drought. The drought continues. :( Last year starting in March, it was my goal to hatch at least one shiny each month. Until December I made that goal and sometimes got two or three a month. This drought really killed my enthusiasm for shiny breeding.  Edit: all of these were with shiny charm  But I have hatched a lot of really good shinies, so I shouldn't complain."
ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:56:01 2015 UTC,I've had over 4K of hatched eggs before until I got a shiny.
ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,Onihige,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:33:10 2015 UTC,"My longest was just about 1050, I think, with a shiny charm.   Second longest (which was my most recent one with Solosis) was just over 900, but those two have far outstripped the others by far; the third longest was only at 670-ish. So not too bad--definitely not as bad as some other people's, but still frustrating.   Good luck with your MM! You can do it!"
ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,capering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:57:50 2015 UTC,solosis was easily my fastest hatch! i bred one for my boyfriend's cousin and got one within 20 eggs. gotta love when that happens.
ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,bmmbooshoot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:02:52 2015 UTC,"omg haha, I'm jealous, that's some incredible luck! I've gotten a few MMs around there (Mawile and Snorunt were 23 and 19 respectively, I think) but my more recent ones have all been pretty long D:"
ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,capering,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:08:49 2015 UTC,"Longest without shiny charm was my little pink chimchar at 2.4k eggs. Longest one with the charm recently, 1.6 k for my bulbasaur..though my dragalgae is sneaking up to 1k as we speak, so we may have a new winner soon! lol  Goodluck with your hunt =)"

ShinyPokemon,3dtbti,Blastonite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:15:30 2015 UTC,Longest to date is 2681 for Totodile. But 2k+ then a 1k+ for 2 shinies make me frustrated.

I got incredibly lucky with her - she took just under 300 eggs, hatched female and with six IVs. She's now a glorious Sylveon and I love her very much.  But seriously, I'm at over 800 eggs for a Vulpix. It's gonna hatch flash fire male and I am going to cry, I can sense it."

I probably would have stopped at just growlithe, but the masuda method odds gave me the encouragement and determination to breed all of my favorites. It still took hundreds of hours of game time to hatch them, but I don't regret it. Most of them are even competitively viable!
