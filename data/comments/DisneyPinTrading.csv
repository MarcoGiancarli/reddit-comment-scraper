DisneyPinTrading,3e5cn2,NaptimeMVP,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"It's real. I've never seen a fake of this and the colors look good. I think there are only like a few pin on pins that have been faked, this not being one. Very nice pin!!!! And for the record, hot topic pins have the Disney logo and are considered official. You can trade them at the parks."

DisneyPinTrading,3e5cn2,laurenk1964,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:34:43 2015 UTC,Yup! No problem. I do know the kh hot topic pins are pretty expensive though. Good luck collecting! :)

It may be a scrapper, I don't really see anything obvious with it, but it feels a little light weight to me. If you are interested in it though, I will just give it to you. I have had it for a while and never really cared for it :) Mickey tsum tsum is a go for trade, but my husband said he wants to keep the wall e. Are there any others you like?"

If you don't like any other pins, we can just trade that one's we talked about so far, just let me know :)  I think I also have one figment standing in front of the epcot ball, of you don't have that one yet."

DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,cromwell18,5,Sat Jul 18 23:05:38 2015 UTC,You wouldn't be the first person to buy counterfeit merchandise just because you don't want to pay full price for the real thing. As long as you're not bringing them to the park and trading them (which you obviously aren't) I don't have a problem with it. Though supporting counterfeiters is obviously a grey area.
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,NaptimeMVP,0,Sat Jul 18 23:15:08 2015 UTC,I'm not supporting counterfeiters per say. I think the seller might genuinely think they are real and had them trading to them by someone pesky.  Edit:  Also it wasn't that I didn't want to pay full price for them I just like them and so made the purchase.
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,masuabie,4,Sat Jul 18 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"If you bought them on Ebay, I'm sure they knew. They almost always know."
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,NaptimeMVP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:34:47 2015 UTC,No need to justify yourself to me. I bought a counterfeit LE Jessica Rabbit wearing my DLR costume just because I really wanted it and knew I'd never get my hands on a real one!
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,KeeBlaydMastr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:08:51 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what pin is that?"
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,NaptimeMVP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:56 2015 UTC,WDI has done a few sets where she's in cast member costumes. It's in this set but I want all of them!
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,KeeBlaydMastr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:42:32 2015 UTC,Very nice so far!
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,phantomdancer42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:40:40 2015 UTC,Which one of those is your DLR costume? I might have an extra...
DisneyPinTrading,3ds65a,purpledrive1,3,Sun Jul 19 09:29:28 2015 UTC,"I would say the only bad thing about it is you're supporting people who know they're selling counterfeit pins. I know they don't sell for much, but there will always be that uninformed person who's going to buy one and take it to the park or try to sell it, and it's never a good experience to be caught with a fake item."

But certainly if that falls through I'd be more than willing to give your pins a look over! Just a fair warning, I don't have the Soda Fountain card-back to go with it.

DisneyPinTrading,3dphvs,MeishkaD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:16:26 2015 UTC,Very true
DisneyPinTrading,3dphvs,NaptimeMVP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"I imagine the only real issue is scrappers, as they're just plain fake versions of a pin that should be authentic, and, as such, I don't see why fantasy/bootleg pins should be a problem at all.    I just don't know if people will really be able to identify which pins are licensed and which aren't, as Disney has licensed many people over the years to make pins outside of the official Pin Trading hobby. A lot of people already have trouble identifying scrappers; identifying fantasy vs. licensed pins would probably over complicate things. Of course it's up to /u/RickSebastian; just throwing in my two cents."
DisneyPinTrading,3dphvs,laur2d2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:59:32 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. I guess a good indicator that people should be aware of is the copyright stamp on the back. Most fantasy pins don't have one. I have yet to see one with it. Unfortunately I've seen some on eBay trying to hide the fact that it's a fantasy pin in the description, so I see you're point."
DisneyPinTrading,3dphvs,laur2d2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:14:03 2015 UTC,What is a fantasy pin?

I live about an hour away from Hollywood and I only make the trip if one of the pins is something me or my family/friends collect. As you're allowed to get two, I will always trade the second one.

Other than that, it's fair game to sell a pin or two if you line up by yourself or with friends. The money covers parking, gas money, and you make a little extra to get whatever you want."

DisneyPinTrading,3dn0cf,Kronk-Rules4128,2,Fri Jul 17 16:49:29 2015 UTC,I think the main things you need to watch for on Amazon is large lots of pins for under a dollar a pin. Selled sets are just regular resellers I believe.
DisneyPinTrading,3dn0cf,MeishkaD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:20 2015 UTC,I've had several bad experiences with Amazon and buying pins. The prices are too high compared to eBay. I would never purchase pins from Amazon again. Some pins that are worth $25 go for $65 on Amazon. They don't protect the buyer like eBay either. I'd personally avoid Amazon at all costs.

DisneyPinTrading,3dfqmi,Kalinn,2,Thu Jul 16 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"Nice video, but another question.   When you're trading with a CM are you allowed to look at the back of the pin before you trade for it, or do you have to just look at it on their lanyard?"

DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,Meindl33089,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:53 2015 UTC,What is a park pack?
DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,Lollybrubs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:53:12 2015 UTC,"Basically at the start of every month, the Disney Store site sells Park Packs which essentially comes with three random pins; one Limited Edition, and two Open Edition.  EDIT: Ah, my mistake. The first Thursday of each month."
DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,Apocalyptoad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:35:14 2015 UTC,Nice! Wish I had ordered this months!!
DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,cromwell18,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:44:53 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm crazy (or have questionable taste) cause I have actually like and plan on keeping all the pins from the May-July packs.
DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,diabretic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:07:03 2015 UTC,"Son of a bitch! After the letdown of the June pack, I opted not to get this one. And two out of three of this one are one's I would LOVE."
DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,Oroschwanz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:44:43 2015 UTC,How do you guys sign up to get or purchase the park pack? I tried this month but it just said sorry like how it is currently
DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,herroyerrow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:02:51 2015 UTC,"the only luck I've had is ordering on the first Thursday. Any other time afterwards it's sold out. I ordered the July one on the day it was released and even still, it takes two weeks to get, mine is due to arrive at my house this Thursday"
DisneyPinTrading,3d6o63,MrMovieMoney,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:06:53 2015 UTC,"I usually go online right after I wake up on the first Thursday of the month, usually around 7 AM Eastern time. I have all three!"

DisneyPinTrading,3d6y5b,hannah-christine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:16:01 2015 UTC,I do not! I would LOVE to trade for it if you see anything you like. :)
DisneyPinTrading,3d6y5b,hannah-christine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:30:21 2015 UTC,"I'll order her right now. It'll be a couple weeks until she comes in. Could you set aside the Prince Eric pin for now? He's not part of my main collection but I like him. Perhaps if you get any incredible new pins in the next two weeks, I'll choose something else instead, but he's my main choice for now :)"

I have quite a few more, just don't have time to upload pictures of them all, I have to leave for work in a minute.  I also really like your partners statue in front of the castle. Let me know if you see anything you're willing to trade for that out of these pins. Otherwise, I don't get off work until about 1:30am eastern time, so i can send you pictures of my other pins then (:  edit: I just realized my picture came out in really poor quality because of iphone. Let me know if you have any questions about those pins."
