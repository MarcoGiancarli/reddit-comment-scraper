Believe it or not, there are still people in the world who appreciate and use printed maps.  Not only do they contain tons of information that would require calling breweries to find, their batteries don't die, and they can be works of art.  If you don't like print maps, don't use them."

Charlotte,3e3ry1,mary-o-e,14,Tue Jul 21 20:59:52 2015 UTC,I cut the cord years ago so I have no clue what you're talking about.
Charlotte,3e3ry1,mary-o-e,-7,Tue Jul 21 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"""Cut the cord"" usually means you've given up cable. Fox is a network station you should be able to pick up over the air."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,one800higgins,8,Tue Jul 21 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"My bad. How would one say ""I stopped watching TV stations period""? I cut the cord and ... donated the rabbit ears to Goodwill?"

Charlotte,3e3ry1,caller-number-four,-15,Tue Jul 21 22:05:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you just got rid of your TV. Okey doke. Thanks for playing."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,brandon7s,4,Tue Jul 21 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, cutting the cord usually means something closer to only using your TV as a display for your internet-enabled devices, and never bothering with the channel buttons on your remote ever again.  It's a conscious decision to replace those channel buttons with URLs.  Most people probably don't realize that they can still watch local channels via wall coax, and hardly any of them would care at all even if they did know."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,caller-number-four,-4,Tue Jul 21 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"Technically, you're not ""cutting the cord"" if you still have internet.  You are the first person I have encountered that considers OTA to not be part of the cord yanking movement."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,MinusTheFire,3,Tue Jul 21 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"What? Cutting the Cord is,  as far as I've ever heard,  referring to a lack of cable/satellite TV. Internet is pretty much a requirement for ""cutting the cord"",  unless you want to use redbox as your only source of entertainment."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,caller-number-four,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"As I noted to MinusTheFire, I was taking issue with the aspect of OTA not being included in the cord cutting debate.  Typically, it is implied that OTA is used for locals/network programming.  The hard core folks actaully do sever the cable and use all wireless for their needs."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,Badtz,4,Wed Jul 22 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"Well, you're the first person I've come across that includes internet in the list of cords-to-be-cut, so at least we're both meeting new people.  I mean, I'll be the first to admit that maybe I've missed something along the way, but I thought the point of the movement was based on getting rid of the cable bill as you can find almost any show you'd want to watch via an online streaming service.  I can see the more hardcore anti-""big media"" crowd going all-in, but I'd lose my mind without internet while I haven't missed having cable television even once."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,caller-number-four,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:51:00 2015 UTC,"I was taking issue with the OTA aspect.  Generally speaking ""cutting the cord"" does refer to no longer using a traditional cable company or satellie provider.  However, it is implied that one would still use OTA for locals/network programming and a mish-mosh of internet services to get your entertainment.  Truely hard core cable cutters completely disconnect and use all wireless services.  To me, it is a shell game.  You're still beholden to your cable company for internet services.  But now you're introducing content providers in the mix.  It'd be great if you could get rid of the middle man all together (ie your cable company).  It seems a better term would be IPTV transition.  That's what it really is.  But the term isn't as sexy as cord cutting.  Make no mistake about it, as the transition continues, cable companies will begin raising their internet access rates and as content providers get more popular (see: Netflix) prices are going to rise.  And before you know it, bam, you're back to where you were.  Except it will be this sexy IP cord cutting thing.  Maybe we'll get lucky in this market thanks to competition and won't see as dramatic of a price increase.  BTW - in this quarter's earnings confernece call, Netflix hinted that they'd be raising prices later this year.  http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Netflix-CEO-Price-Hikes-are-Coming-134492  At the end of the day whatever works for you is great."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,mas1234,3,Wed Jul 22 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"I actually liked the newscast when it first started. It was innovative and different, but it did look very amateurish for a long time. I think if things had been a little more polished, then it might have worked a little better. I really respect them for attempting to do something really new with the format.   Unfortunately, WJZY was always going to be facing an uphill climb towards being successful in Charlotte. This market has too many sources for local news.. WSOC, WBTV, WCNC, WCCB, News 14, and now WJZY. With more people using the internet for news and less tuning in to local TV, it just seems like 6 nightly newscasts is overkill."
Charlotte,3e3ry1,NCSooner,3,Tue Jul 21 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"I am glad they are axing the experiment.  Because the journalists had to be journalists, photog, producer and editor it lended itself to amatuer hour.  If they want to do something different they should cover news no one else is doing.  Sometimes you can learn more about what is going on in this country by watching BBC or Al Jezera (sp?)."

Charlotte,3e3ry1,gertrudeblythe,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"Let me give a few reasons:  When I first moved to Charlotte, I tried to subscribe to just the Sunday paper (it was almost a decade ago and I just wanted the ads).  They told me no - I had to get the whole week, or Friday-Sunday for about $.25 less than the whole week.  I told them no.  About a year ago, they started throwing some ""local"" mini paper on my lawn all the time, and I had to call and bitch to get them to stop throwing my litter on the lawn.  They were doing the paywall thing. I don't remember if they still are or not."

Charlotte,3e3hkh,JebediahMorningstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"I went to the Yo! Sushi in London-Heathrow. It had the wow-factor, but the sushi was just very mediocre. If you can imagine it; it was three chefs putting out the most popular items on the menu on the conveyor belt that took about 10-15 min to travel all around.  The belt went around the entire restaurant, which is about the size of a small apartment. And the meals were served in clear, plastic domes that were being used as tupperware.   Traditionally, sushi is enjoyed fresh from the sushi bar. So the idea of sushi that travels on a conveyor belt for that long isn't all that appetizing.   Here! is an example."

Charlotte,3e0few,BashAtTheBeach96,3,Tue Jul 21 01:21:03 2015 UTC,Smithfield's is (too) slowly making it's way west in NC. I was talking to the manager of a one a couple weeks ago and he was estimating they would make it to Charlotte in a couple years.   Smithfield's has incredible customer service and their employees display a level of kindness you just don't regularly encounter in Charlotte fast food restaurants. I'm really curious what will happen on their personnel front if they attempt to open a franchise here.
Charlotte,3e0few,hatervision,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:41 2015 UTC,100% agree about their customer service.  The only thing even close to it is Chick-Fil-A.  I stop at the one off 74 in Laurinburg every time I go to Wilmington.  In college I took my buddy from Long Island there and the customer service left him in shock.  He was just used to asshole New Yorkers and fast food workers in the University area.

It probably won't be in the neighborhood you would want to live in, but I love it. I will look up the address tomorrow; my phone is dead and downstairs and I am lazy and sleepy. Also the lime green restaurant on this street was really cool and good food. Lighter type food like lunch not dinner and pretty inexpensive."

Including one was over the salad dressing."

Charlotte,3e0k9g,frankblibster,8,Tue Jul 21 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"Hey there /u/frankblibster , and welcome to Charlotte! Please take this answer in a positive way. There's a thousand young professionals who would love to be on non-profit boards for networking reasons (just look at who is on the board of FFTC, McColl Center, YMCA, United Way, it's a who's who of leaders). I recently joined a local 501(c)(3) board and am very excited about the opportunity to work with leaders in my field (banking). My advice: forget that whole angle. What you need to do is volunteer, and be the best. Find a cause you support and help fundraise. Find out when events are taking place and offer to help set up and clean up. Be a smiling, hard working asset. Eventually someone will ask you about your skills. Maybe you are a marketer by trade, or an accountant. Now you have a chance to offer help in more of an administrative/governance manner. But it might take years to be asked to serve on anything substantial. If you're really serious about helping out the community, which I'm positive you are, it really shouldn't matter. Hope that helps"

Charlotte,3dy761,sayantsi2,5,Mon Jul 20 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"Park on the light rail line and ride it in or get a monthly parking pass in a lot close to your new office.  Many lots have Apps you get on your phone such as ParkMobile or Passport.  Depending on the hours you are working there are varying options. If you are a 3rd shift worker, you can find free parking, as long as there are no big events going on uptown that day. I am a stagehand. I usually work early in the morning and again, late at night. I tend to pay $5 to park in the day time and park for free at night. Best of luck with the new job."

Charlotte,3dy761,NoyzMaker,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"Check with your work about parking or CATS discounts first. Some workplaces can get monthly passes up to 50% off.  Your best bet is to adjust your commute time and ride the light rail. Depending on where you are coming from it should take no more than about 30 minutes to get in to Uptown. During ""peak"" hours the trains show up every 10 minutes so you are rarely waiting very long.  You will probably average $100 for a parking spot like you want and that is going to be a fight because of the demand due to removal of a lot of parking spaces with the park, stadium, etc."
Charlotte,3dy761,utkevdawg,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:21 2015 UTC,Thanks I can def check about any discounts.  I don't mind the longer commute time if it means I can do something else like read and email.

Charlotte,3dy4p6,mikemil50,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"Ok so Google Fi is a prepaid service so my first bill is $74.35 which is: Fi Basics $20.00 Data 3gig for $30.00 Device payment through google $20.79 Taxes $3.56    So any data that i do not use that i have paid for will be credited back on my next bill, connecting to all wifi hotspots using VPN and checking all apps to make sure they are only downloading across wifi and not data. I think i am on target to use around 1.5Gig so i will get $15.00 credit applied to my next bill. My Typical usage was around 30-40gig on TMobile so it has been quite the game to get my data use down."
Charlotte,3dy4p6,belgorm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. For whatever reason, my work computer won't let me access their information. Are there higher data plans? How's the reception?"
Charlotte,3dy4p6,mikemil50,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"You pay for what you use, so if i went over my 3gig plan and used 3.5 gig then a $5.00 charge would be added to my bill. Eat less charged less, eat more charged more.    The coverage map is a combination of TMobile and Sprint so i am covered most of the places i visit and you can make calls over Wifi, so i am covered for other areas with no data signals."

Charlotte,3dy4p6,nexusheli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"I'm on Virgin Mobile (MVNO that operates on Sprint) and my SO is on Sprint directly.  We never have problems in Charlotte - we almost always have at least 3g and there is 4g coverage through a lot of the city.  On drives to Knoxville and PA we hit a couple dead spots in rural or mountainous areas, but generally for a 4 to 8 hour drive we're rarely without coverage for more than a few miles.    Adding the ability to glom on to WiFi and TMo networks I would bet fixes a lot of that except in the most remote areas.  I have an invite and have considered switching over myself since I don't use a lot of mobile data and it would save me significant money, but the initial outlay for the Nexus 6 is a little hard to swallow, since I didn't manage to grab one for $400 during the Prime Day sale..."

Charlotte,3dv0j4,LiveBeef,5,Mon Jul 20 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"93.3 has become to me what 106.5 was in my earlier years. They hit on a good mix of classic alternative rock (basically 90s grunge and alt)  through modern rock.  I really feel like 106.5 has been going through a perpetual identity crisis for the past few years. Their repeated changes in morning hosts and their specialized programming, like NASCAR for example, always seem to give me the opinion that they don't really know what they want to be.   Often if 93.3 doesn't have something I want to listen to, I switch to 90.7 WFAE these days. I prefer talk radio over listening to music I don't enjoy."
Charlotte,3dv0j4,mbp231,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:36 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Especially when they played AC/DC's new album nonstop a couple years back. They're an odd mix of playing the same five <1yr old songs nonstop (""new rock"", I suppose) and picking 20 or so songs that they played nonstop ten years ago to space it out."

Charlotte,3dv0j4,hambone931,2,Sun Jul 19 23:40:49 2015 UTC,"88.7 plays a huge variety of music, lots of college rock type music.    I haven't listened in a while, but they tend to do celtic & or bluegrass during early morning-lunch hour on the weekends."
Charlotte,3dv0j4,palmerd21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"Funny, I checked them out over the weekend, it was some incredibly bluegrass stuff.  Real hillbillies, not Alison Krauss.

Charlotte,3dv0j4,CrownTownLibrarian,2,Mon Jul 20 00:47:23 2015 UTC,"106.5 plays NASCAR? Really?? I'm surprised it's not on 99.7, or one of the country stations just because it seems the audience would fit the demographic better...  As for me, I rarely listen to music radio anymore because it seems so monotonous. I MIGHT tune into 106.5 or 99.7 occasionally, but if I'm in a spot where I can pick up 93.3, Ill listen to that.

Charlotte,3dqphs,appoaf,29,Sat Jul 18 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"I was on It with my boys. We rode it from Presbyterian to the end and went back on for the return trip. When we got back to Presbyterian, it seemed like the conductor couldn't open the doors and we started to roll back away from the platform. No big deal, but we continued to go and go down the incline that is Elizabeth. We went through one green light but didn't make the light at Kings Drive and hit the car. The trolley eventually stopped by the 277 overpass between McDowell and Kings Drive. Everyone on the trolley was fine and I think the officers said the people in the car were ok too. It made my butt pucker and I felt bad for the trolley driver who was doing everything he could to stop it."
Charlotte,3dqphs,bacaorr,7,Sat Jul 18 16:21:49 2015 UTC,So the brakes went out and it lost power? I find it fairly odd that there isn't some sort of failsafe for situations like this.
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,7,Sat Jul 18 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"I used to work at Charlotte Trolley.  When these modern trolley cars shared the Blue line with the Lynx cars, they did have a fail safe that kicked in if they got too close to the car ahead.  The trolley would automatically throw on emergency brakes to slow down.  I was on it when it happened once."
Charlotte,3dqphs,CandyFiend,4,Sat Jul 18 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"The system you're talking about (ATP, automatic train protection) isn't used while the trolley is operating on the gold line tracks.  Only while it's on the blue line."
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:44:15 2015 UTC,I wonder why they aren't using it.  Any idea?
Charlotte,3dqphs,CandyFiend,3,Sun Jul 19 11:28:57 2015 UTC,"The ATP system wouldn't detect a car on the tracks or anything like that.  It just detects other railed vehicles on the same stretch of track.  It also sets the max speed the vehicle can go by picking up signals from antennas in the tracks.  There are no antennas on the gold line tracks, just the blue line.  Thus it operates in streetcar mode with a max speed of 25MPH.  ATP doesn't do anything in streetcar mode other than set that max speed and waste space."
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:47:59 2015 UTC,Because there aren't any trains on the road?
Charlotte,3dqphs,nexusheli,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:14:57 2015 UTC,Pretty much.
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,4,Sun Jul 19 13:48:28 2015 UTC,"There are three brakes on the streetcars.  The main (pneumatic) brakes, the parking brake (the one operated by that wheel up front) and the track brakes (big electromagnets that latch on to the rails).  To stop the streetcar, pulling the brake handle to the right should have activated the pneumatic brakes.  The operator should have hit the red button (E-Stop) when that didn't work, activating the track brakes (which have a direct connection to the batteries).  When that didn't work, the operator probably panicked and didn't think of using the parking brakes (which just manually operate the brakes that the pneumatics normally operate)."
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have some knowledge on the subject. Are the electric motors freewheel when de-energized? I would think that if they were dyno motors, it would at the very least slow it down to a crawl with the power/throttle cut off."
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,3,Sun Jul 19 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"I spent a lot of time unfucking them.  There is not dynamic braking on the streetcars like there is on the LRVs.  They pretty much freewheel, theoretically you could bump them a phase and put a load across it to have electric braking.  They were never designed with regenerative / resistive braking in mind, so they don't have the capability to dump it into a resistor bank or into the caternary."
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,3,Sun Jul 19 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the brakes went out but the conductor couldn't stop. The a/c was on, so there was power at least to that. I wondered why an emergency brake wasn't used."
Charlotte,3dqphs,bacaorr,4,Sat Jul 18 23:57:53 2015 UTC,Which tells me the operator either didn't hit the E-Stop or that the E-Stop switch didn't work.  The E-Stop cuts power to everything else when it drops the track brakes (big electromagnets that get their power directly from the batteries)
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,3,Sun Jul 19 02:52:35 2015 UTC,Fuckin' YIKES.   You will definitely never catch me riding that modern relic after this.
Charlotte,3dqphs,onearmmanny,6,Sat Jul 18 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you'll want to avoid driving your car until everyone figures this thing out."
Charlotte,3dqphs,Johopo,3,Sun Jul 19 00:43:15 2015 UTC,"They're generally pretty safe but like any rail vehicle can't stop on a dime.  However this reeks of operator stupidity to me.  Due to a complete lack of competence and communication within CATS the voltages on the gold line and blue line caternary are different.  The system put in the streetcars to account for that fuckery abuse the compressor that provides pressure for the pneumatic brakes.  Not to worry though, when that compressor gives way there's a failsafe that's supposed to stop the trolley when the supply pressure gets too low."
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"Pneumatic brakes require positive pressure to release. If there's no pressure, the brakes should be engaged.   Edit: *Should require."
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,4,Sun Jul 19 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"The brakes on the trolleys are pressure applied.  That's just how they're designed.  I haven't worked on any other pneumatic braking system so I don't know if it's unusual or not.  Unrelated, but the LRVs have pressure-released hydraulic braking on the front and rear trucks and pressure-applied hydraulics on the center truck."
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:13:37 2015 UTC,That's really interesting. I'm more or less referring to how the brakes work on an 18 wheeler. It's a safety feature (there may or may not be other additiinal benefits to this) to make the vehicle stop in the event of a tank/compressor failure vs. needing that pressure to actually apply the brake.
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"The streetcars have a pressure sensor that's supposed to trip the brakes when the supply pressure gets low.  Fun fact:  the air horn and the brakes use the same tank.  Hopefully an operator would stop pulling the horn when the low pressure switch trips, but there's nothing stopping them from depleting the whole tank."
Charlotte,3dqphs,_ti,2,Sun Jul 19 04:51:11 2015 UTC,"That's fucking hilarious. The scene in Austin Powers where he runs over the guy on the steam roller comes to mind. I can see the conductor laying on the horn, brakes failing, saying ""move"" when he could just let off and hit the brake."
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,2,Sun Jul 19 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  I honestly would pay to watch whatever happened today, because if it actually went like what the top comment says it must have been hilarious.  Sounds like the whole thing could have been stopped by either the track or parking brakes."

Charlotte,3dqphs,rugger62,-4,Mon Jul 20 13:02:00 2015 UTC,"the city bus or light rail. they never run into cars.   You expect a bus to have accidents, it works like any other vehicle on the road, and they all have accidents.  The light rail literally cannot have an accident with a car like this unless a car is physically on the tracks (which they should never be).  And except in cases of a faulty crossing warning (which is extremely rare) accidents at crossings are always the automobile driver's fault.  You're such a big fan of this thing that you make a sarcastic comment on every thread about it; are you riding it?  What makes it so great?"
Charlotte,3dqphs,nexusheli,6,Sun Jul 19 12:10:56 2015 UTC,"haven't rode it yet, no. i have plans to though. i just happen to live on the other side of uptown and haven't been that way in the last few days.   why am i such a fan? because you know how people move to Charlotte, then immedietly start talking shit about Charlotte because its not a ""real city?"" this is the type of thing that makes a city a ""real city."" these projects attract new people and businesses. connecting the neighborhoods is a good thing. one of the main things people, particularly young people, complain about in Charlotte when moving here is that it isn't walkable unless your uptown. well guess what? this helps that, a lot. Now Elizabeth is connected to uptown too. you could get on the streetcar, take it to the light rail, and go to freaking Pineville. that beats the shit out of driving down south/77 to 485.   and i will always compare it to the light rail, because people were so against it, and now its very successful, and Southend is something completely different then it was before (and i bet a lot of those people that were against it now use it) you don't think that will happen around the street car? why not? do you remember Southend before, or were you not here or not old enough to remember what Southend was in 2000? do you think those houses West Blvd were going for $300K+ in 2000? why do you think they are now?   Elizabeth is already a desirable neighborhood, and now its connected to uptown. we'll see what happens, but i bet you a pack of Fruit Stripe Gum that its going to be pretty successful and it will have an over all positive impact on the area."
Charlotte,3dqphs,onnoj817,3,Sun Jul 19 16:50:12 2015 UTC,This is spot on. People that don't directly benefit are going to complain. I'm on the Elizabeth side and I will use this instead of Uber to get uptown (I refuse to park uptown) for events and the like. 277 is like a virtual wall and this is effectively tearing down that wall.
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,3,Sun Jul 19 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"well that's the way it always is. i mean, people in Steele Creek will probably never use this thing, or see it being used, because they live in Steele Creek...why would they? they will just assume its an empty car running back and forth.   i bet they had a whole lot of support for widening 485 though, whereas i didn't care either way."

Charlotte,3dqphs,BeardedThor,4,Sat Jul 18 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"A good rule of thumb is to not suddenly brake in front of anyone. I think the emphasis is being placed on this due to the fact that if you suddenly stop in front of a car and get hit, the damage would likely be minimal at the same speed that trolley runs. The damage would be far more significant if that trolley hit you in the same circumstance. It admittedly stops slower than your typical car but it's no different than saying not to suddenly brake in front of an semi."
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,2,Sun Jul 19 04:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, but I didn't get the impression that they meant the tires screeching kind of sudden stop but more of the ""oh I forgot my turn"" kind of stop."
Charlotte,3dqphs,BeardedThor,2,Sun Jul 19 05:13:29 2015 UTC,"Even still, almost missing a turn and braking abruptly (read: undredictably) has the same implication on the road as doing it in front of a city bus."
Charlotte,3dqphs,Robotpharm,2,Sun Jul 19 05:22:53 2015 UTC,"So, if someone breaks in front of you and you are in front of the trolley, you are just screwed then?   That is troubling."

Charlotte,3dqphs,BeardedThor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying its a good idea, but the city's idea is definitely targeting a different demographic than a bus route would.  Then there's a small factor to the value in the neighborhood it operates in will appear to be more upscale than ""just"" having a nearby bus route.

Charlotte,3dn88x,boisetoise,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:38:20 2015 UTC,"Their whole pricing scheme is just weird. The monthly passes don't offer any incentive. They're only worthwhile, last I checked, if you ride transit 7 days per week. For example if I ride the LYNX from my apartment to uptown (regardless of distance) it's $2.20 one way, $4.40 round trip. The price of the monthly pass is more expensive than simply buying a round trip ticket each day Monday through Friday. Say one of those days I took the car to run an errand after work--now my monthly pass is even less economical. IIRC the bus is priced similarly."

Charlotte,3dn88x,tunaman808,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"That must be new. AFAIK, happy hours were banned the time I lived in Georgia (1971-2002). That's why 10¢ wings became a big thing: it was illegal to offer drink specials at specific times (e.g you could have ""$2 Tequila Tuesdays"", but you couldn't have ""$2 tequila from 5-7PM""). So bars started offering cheap food during what should have been happy hour. Which was great if you didn't actually drink: a bar near my house used to have ridiculous food specials, like $2 pub burgers & fries and $8.99 prime rib dinners."
Charlotte,3dn88x,NoyzMaker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:37 2015 UTC,Odd. We ran happy hour drink specials at the bar I worked at from 98 to 01. Maybe it was a county based restriction or we just didn't follow the law.
Charlotte,3dn88x,tunaman808,2,Sun Jul 19 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"Could be the latter. Georgia law required bars wanting to be open on Sunday to make 51% of their money on food. I don't recall that ever being enforced, ever, unless the bar owner was already in trouble for something else, like serving minors or not paying taxes. And there were several convenience stores near Georgia Tech that would sell beer any time - day or night, even Sunday - back in the 90s... as long as you looked like a (white) college student, or they knew you.

Harris Teeter is like the Kohl's of grocery stores: everything is ""regularly priced"" at $69.95, but it's always on sale for $24.99 to $32.99, which is still too damn much. Publix has always said that shopping there ""is a pleasure"", not ""shopping here is cheap"". Since Bi-Lo emerged from bankruptcy, they've had Harris Teeter prices and Food Lion selection. And Food Lion may be cheap, but most of their stores reek of 1978.  This is why my GF and I mostly shop at Aldi. Pork chops, chicken breasts and ground beef are regularly $2/pound less than my local Walmart or Bi-Lo. If I had to guess, I'd say we save at least 40% shopping there over the other chains. Of course, the selection there ain't great: if you need lemongrass, you've gone to the wrong store. But for everyday staples, their prices can't be beat."

Get some real hands on learning experience with undergraduate research opportunities.   The bar for entry is not even that high. Are you a B student?  Perfect!  Free money folks, courtesy of the National Science Foundation.     There's no excuse not to check it out if you need to figure out how to pay for college.   Over $11,000 for two years! It's not a loan. It's a grant that you don't have to pay back."

Charlotte,3di4yz,GlaringPlatypus,2,Thu Jul 16 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"Any student who enrolls at Gaston to complete an Associate in Science degree is eligible. The program is geared towards students who want to major in a science like biology, chemistry, physics,etc...or who want to major in psychology, engineering, computer science, math, etc...  We have several students who are premed and pre-vet. This scholarship does not apply to students who want to major in the arts/humanities or want to go into nursing (since it is not a transfer program).

Am I correct in saying that, if he is able to take the class, i.e. has met the prerequisites, but has not yet taken the class, then he is eligible for the scholarship?"

Charlotte,3dj7md,nexusheli,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:12 2015 UTC,Our APC (Annual Pest Control) contract is $445 for a whole year (unless your house is a little bigger then it increases accordingly) and that comes with unlimited reservices. Which means that as many times as you need us throughout the year we'll come back to spray at no charge after the initial treatment.   Edit: we also offer One Time sprays for inside & outside as well as outside only at $200 and $140 respectively. Those come with the option to upgrade to the APC within 30 days and just pay the difference.
Charlotte,3dj7md,catinahat1,2,Sun Jul 19 20:20:51 2015 UTC,Call a bee keeper - if you can't find one directly call 311 for animal control and see if they can direct you to the right place.

If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer. The Matthews Art Guild is typically a smaller group of people, a more quiet environment, where you can focus on your own work. The Charlotte Art League is a little different, it's a larger space, with better lighting, and there are a ton of talented artists at the Charlotte Art League. The environment seems a little more relaxed and positive. I have absolutely no artistic talent but from a models perspective the group at CAL is great and classes there are always a good time."

We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.   It's racist BS, Not honoring the dead kids, but this confederate pride movement of the 1950s-70s championed by segregationists to try and change the cause of the war into something ""noble"". Worst part is many people who were educated here actually believe it was a noble struggle for rights (unrelated to slavery) despite every other paragraph in the primary sources ""Declaration of Causes"" containing the words slavery, or statements as explicit as ""The prohibition of slavery in the Territories is the cardinal principle of this organization.""   These 50 year old monuments aren't some historical treasure, just the last fits of people angry at their contemporary civil rights movement, Brown V Board, etc, not honoring their great great granduncle who died at 17."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,aywwts4,21,Thu Jul 16 12:36:04 2015 UTC,"I have lived both in the North and the South; I don't consider myself a ""southerner"" and have no particular love for the Confederacy or what it stood for. However, like it or not, this is a part of the history of our area. I don't agree that we should do away with monuments commemorating a time in history that may offensive to some. Removing these monuments is not going to erase history; a quarter million confederate soldiers lost their lives in the Civil War; and while the cause they were fighting for is inarguably wrong by today's standards, they were Americans who thought they were doing the right thing for their state. If we're going to start whitewashing history, we may as well remove the Vietnam Memorial and only commemorate soldiers who died fighting popular wars."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,brathe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with commemorating the dead no matter what the war was about, Vietnam, American Indian War, Civil War, etc, if that memorial was commissioned in the 1800s with a inaccurate description of the cause, fine. But it wasn't, it was a 1977 memorial purposefully conflating honoring the dead with the nobility of the cause. It's using those dead to further a political narrative in the 50's-70's I object to, not honoring the dead kids.  I guess I'm 100% arguing with the ""Confederate Memorial Association of 1977"" and the larger resurgence of Southern Pride narrative resurrected during Strom Thurmond's segregationist ""Dixiecrats"" Not anything that happened in the 1800's, the past is full of garbage and crap, we don't lionize it in the 1960s and defend it now.   Put it this way, This monument was put up shortly after the Greenboro massacre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_massacre where the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party killed 5 and were aqquitted by an all white jury. Not a neutral time to raise monuments to the civil war."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,aywwts4,2,Thu Jul 16 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"The monument isn't honoring the cause, its honoring the dead. I personally don't think the cause should be commemorated, but the soldiers who lost their lives should be given the proper respect."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,brathe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"It specifically honors the cause. ""Nobly for the cause of independence and constitutional self-government"".  I don't disagree that the soldiers deserve respect."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,aywwts4,5,Thu Jul 16 17:05:50 2015 UTC,"No. If you put that into the context of the entire paragraph, it is [honoring those who] struggled nobly for the cause of independence and constitutional self-government  The full text - so people can decide for themselves what it is saying:  Mecklenburg County remembers with honor her gallant sons who fought in the armies of the confederate states. With the other brave soldiers of the south, they struggled nobly for the cause of independance and constitutional self-government. Their heroic deeds will be forever honored by patriotic men and women."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,brathe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:14:11 2015 UTC,"Even if it has a negative context of ""This will show those race mixers!"" (which is entirely possible, but I am not saying it is), it still deserves to stay there as a reminder of our troubling and not so distant past."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,Codeshark,0,Fri Jul 17 02:39:17 2015 UTC,"I actually like the idea of honoring Dr. King alongside of this monument it can highlight that even in 1977 we were still stinging from 1865.  We are still trying to overcome, but we need to keep the past in mind, I think."
Charlotte,3dh3y4,Codeshark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:36:38 2015 UTC,"http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html     My favorite, most explicit paragraph, but it's mostly a disgusting indefensible read.

I'm not sure where you're pulling that quote from, but in the link there is no Declaration of Causes for North Carolina.    IMO, defacing these monuments doesn't do anything to improve race relations. Why not try and get them taken down? There's no doubt that this is a very checkered part of American history. When facts are reintroduced to new people (kids), they can make their own decisions on what needs to be done. Maybe some people feel better because they are getting out some anger, but as  Yoda said, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering.    The fact is that there are confederate monuments throughout NC and especially in the Charlotte area. Hell, it was the last capital of the confederacy.     tl;dr - creating more conflict is counter-productive to improving race relations."

Charlotte,3dh3y4,cpetrosky,4,Thu Jul 16 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"So ""if being black isn't the issue"" then why does this make it hard not to be racist?"
Charlotte,3dh3y4,CaptainZeep,2,Fri Jul 17 15:16:32 2015 UTC,while my response was intended as a fun poke to lighten the mood it doesn't always work out in writing. It also sadly highlights how using these two words together have become synonymous with being black. With the recent white woman identifying herself as black we can only hope the ghetto mentality is properly assigned to the actions of people and not their appearance but I don't expect that will happen in my lifetime

Charlotte,3ddy5n,rmarti78,26,Wed Jul 15 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"Just to chime in, anyone that lived here when the light rail was going in can remember people fought it tooth and nail, kicking and screaming. They said it was a waste of resources, and that all it would do is transport Mexicans up and down south boulevard. Now it's packed every day, and people live it.  Now, to all you new folks, before that light rail went in, southend was hardly a fraction of what it is now. the biggest reason Southend is what it is, is because of that light rail.  Now, the streetcar may or may not have that same effect, but to all the naysayers, your singing the same song that the light rail opposers were singing 12 years ago.  Yall want to get mad about some waste of money bullshit, let's talk about toll lanes."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,onnoj817,7,Wed Jul 15 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Sure it's a gamble, but a good portion was paid by the fed and it may lead to growth in other corridors.  I know people that made the same complaints you mentioned about the lightrail, now they use it themselves to commute to work."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,HashRunner,6,Wed Jul 15 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"I think the question is that (and I was happy for light rail before I even moved here) the light rail is fast, not dependent on traffic, and out of the way of roads.  Having never lived in a city with a streetcar I understand the questions regarding it...or rather why the funds weren't applied to additional light rail which I can see relieving congestion much more.  Not saying I'm firmly anti-streetcar or that you're wrong, just that I understand the questions surrounding it much moreso than questions surrounding the light rail."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,hispeedzintarwebz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"I think a light rail would have been impossible for the given area. I personally plan to use it to go Uptown more often (because parking kind of sucks there).   Also, we should hang out sometime soon."

Charlotte,3ddy5n,hispeedzintarwebz,-4,Fri Jul 17 16:45:13 2015 UTC,the lightrail still doesn't make sense though.  having one line that extends through a very limited part of the city isn't that helpful.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,phoenixcolt,10,Wed Jul 15 22:38:15 2015 UTC,they are building a second line now. they had to start somewhere.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,onnoj817,4,Wed Jul 15 23:01:06 2015 UTC,let's see if it gets put up a little quicker than the first part...
Charlotte,3ddy5n,phoenixcolt,5,Thu Jul 16 00:22:47 2015 UTC,Completely disagree. Light rail is a godsend anytime Charlotte has a major event going on and gets a good number riding it even when there's not. It's clean and runs well...I'd say the light rail is one of the biggest successes in recent Charlotte history.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,phoenixcolt,-4,Wed Jul 15 23:30:03 2015 UTC,the major events are pretty much the only time it's full and then it gets so packed it makes nyc subway rides seem spacious because there's only one train. Then it takes at least half an hour to get to stops that take 10-15 minutes to drive.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,CrownTownLibrarian,7,Thu Jul 16 00:24:31 2015 UTC,That's not true. That train is full most mornings.

Charlotte,3ddy5n,Codeshark,0,Thu Jul 16 06:21:52 2015 UTC,"There are major events in uptown Charlotte all the time though. On Panthers gamedays, I love parking at the 485 station and riding down. No traffic worries, no worrying about finding a parking spot and having to pay outrageous prices, and people are having a good time. Kids love it too.  You're trading a little bit of time for savings on parking fees, gas money, and you're clearing the roads in and around uptown a little. I think it's an easy choice."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,jcornelius84,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:50:55 2015 UTC,"Right, I can walk to the street car stop and go to Uptown. It probably takes more time, but I get to leave my car at home which is a huge plus."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,melk8381,9,Fri Jul 17 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"I thought this article about the street car by the Charlotte Observer was very informative.    In the article, it mentions how the city of Charlotte estimates a possible revenue (fares, advertisement, taxes, etc.)  of roughly about five million dollars annually.  Considering that 25 million dollars was granted by the federal government, Charlotte could make profit in about three years if everything goes to plan.  Not to mention what the street car may do for tourism, I believe it adds to the appeal of visiting Charlotte if you ask me."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NinerNational,17,Wed Jul 15 18:12:38 2015 UTC,$25m was covered by the Fed Gov. For whatever that is worth.   Second phase will continue out and down Central Ave which will definitely make it more appealing.   It's obviously brand new and will take a little adjustment time both for cars and the streetcar itself (top speed should pick up a little bit).
Charlotte,3ddy5n,nexusheli,12,Wed Jul 15 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. Phase II would go from JCSU to Sunnyside Ave. Phase III would take it down Central, but that is decades away, if it happens at all."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,Johopo,4,Wed Jul 15 17:36:52 2015 UTC,Second phase will continue out and down Central Ave which will definitely make it more appealing.    IF the second phase happens - I wouldn't hold my breath.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,thebuiltclt,7,Wed Jul 15 16:59:56 2015 UTC,Here's a brief discussion of the streetcar in /r/urbanplanning .  It might give you all some insight on what the streetcar can do outside of transportation.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,_ti,6,Wed Jul 15 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"As when the Blue Line opened, it will take a little time for drivers to learn how to interact with the line. While it seems very ingrained now, there were a lot of kinks worked out after the Blue Line opened. We've lived for decades where roads are for fast cars only, and adjusting to include transit/walkers/bikers is going to take time. (I wish the streetcar had signal priority control for a more efficient schedule, not sure if that's planned for the future or not)  And though Phase I is short, Uptown/CPCC/Novant is a hugely important connection that sees major transit ridership already. I'm more excited about the future phases going toward Plaza Midwood/Eastland and west past Johnson C Smith (where there is huge unrealized potential). The next phase would also bring modern streetcars that are not entirely unlike the light rail cars, just smaller.  In any event, I think it's a valuable piece and investment in the ""big picture"" of building a transit system to be proud of."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,thebuiltclt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:29 2015 UTC,The streetcars do have signal priority control.  The black boxes RTV'd to the windows are the IR emitters.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,_ti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:17 2015 UTC,"Based on observation and my ride on it today, it's not being used. Or if it is in use, it's making changes too subtle to spot."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,thebuiltclt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  I know that the emitters work and send out something, but I don't know if they were coded properly.  Never actually tested them.  Plus the operator actually has to turn them on, they aren't automatic.  Might be operator error."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,nexusheli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm interested in. What was your purpose in using it today? Was it just the novelty of it or were you actually using it to get to somewhere you needed to go?   People I see it being useful for: CPCC students, a very small number of Charlotte residents that live within easy walking distance, and...I don't know, maybe Hornets players that need treatment at Novant?"
Charlotte,3ddy5n,carter1984,2,Wed Jul 15 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"I used it to get lunch up on Elizabeth. In the past I have also used the gold rush to get to my Dr at Novant.   In it's current form, I would expect the bulk of users to be CPCC students, which is a significant number. That said, there's a pretty solid number of Elizabeth/Myers Park area commuters that used the Gold Rush, and I would expect that number to transfer to the streetcar.  There's no doubt the current usage will be limited, but it does enable some significant new dense development along Elizabeth Ave. And it opens the door to the next phases, which is when I think the streetcar will really start to shine.  this is not a paid endorsement"
Charlotte,3ddy5n,Codeshark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"As when the Blue Line opened, it will take a little time for drivers to learn how to interact with the line.   There is almost no interaction - it's all crossing just like any other train track, and there are still people that are too stupid to stop for freight trains, so what makes you think a light rail would be any different?  The street car is in the street + plus people are stupid = many many accidents waiting to happen."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,ryanman,3,Wed Jul 15 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"I for one, will personally dig being able to NOT pay exorbitant parking fees when I go to see the Hornets. I plan on parking near CPCC and taking the streetcar."

Charlotte,3ddy5n,ryanman,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:54:48 2015 UTC,The old mayor's contractor buddies.   How much of this cash could have gone towards the university expansion to ACTUALLY stimulate the economy? It's ludicrous.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NinerNational,7,Wed Jul 15 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"None because the city doesn't fund the university...unless you mean the Blue Line Extension. It was already funded and didn't need the additional money. If the city gave the additional 12 million they actually spent to the BLE, it would have been enough to build about 1/10 of a mile more.  Also, 25 million was given to the city specifically for streetcar. That money wouldn't have been available if the streetcar wasn't being built."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,ryanman,-2,Wed Jul 15 17:36:08 2015 UTC,"What part of my comment insinuated that the money should have gone to the university?  But yes none of the money on this shitty city trolley should have been spent at all. It should have been funneled into either the new line or the expansion to the university area, if it were going to be spent at all."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NinerNational,2,Wed Jul 15 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"How much of this cash could have gone towards the university expansion   university expansion is an ambiguous phrase, especially since the university is expanding so much. I thought you might have meant the Blue Line Extension, which is why I pointed that out to avoid confusion for anyone else.  Anyway, it comes from different pools of money. The BLE is funded by CATS, the state, and the federal government.  The streetcar was funded by the federal government and city taxes, not CATS fares or the 1/2 cent transit tax.  The paltry $12 million from the city would have accomplished virtually nothing on the blue line extension. You are talking about $12 million for a project with a budget of over 1 billion.  The land on Elizabeth avenue is about to blow up with development, starting with a 20 floor apartment building announced a couple days before the streetcar started service. Increased tax revenues from property that is going to be worth tens of millions (hundreds of millions when you account for the whole area) more will easily cover the operating costs."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,ryanman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"This may just be a difference of opinion, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that a one mile trolley (that also serves the purpose of further crippling vehicle traffic) will result in 10s/100s of millions of dollars of extra tax revenue. The numbers simply do not compute."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,ninerdawg,6,Wed Jul 15 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"No, the property values will rise 10s/100s of millions. The tax rate is a small percentage of that. 1.3% in Charlotte.  A single 20 story building with 20k square feet of retail (like what has already been announced), is going to very likely be worth 100+ million on the open market. Tax appraised value will be at least half that.  The BoA corporate center has a tax appraised value of $230,500,000.  A better comparison would be the Catalyst, which has a tax value of $61,810,000. They paid $836,000 in property taxes last year.  Currently, the plot of land on Elizabeth with the 20 story high rise mixed use development has a tax value of $652,000. Assuming the completed project had a tax assessed value of even just 1/2 of the Catalyst, you'd be looking at a property tax bill of over $400,000 annually....nearly as much as the property's total assessed value today. And that's just ONE project.  Streetcar will cost roughly 1.5 million per year to operate. Doesn't take much development to recoup that cost.  This is why I get tired of seeing people bitch about ""wasteful"" rail project. Sure the streetcar is virtually useless as a mode of transportation in my opinion, but the $$$$$ value that it adds in the form of development is a net positive to the city."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NCSooner,3,Wed Jul 15 19:28:22 2015 UTC,Ah kk I see what you're saying now
Charlotte,3ddy5n,ninerdawg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:01:07 2015 UTC,But that project is not being built because of the streetcar. It is simply not correct to attribute the increase in the tax base due to the building of the project as being revenue from the streetcar project.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NCSooner,3,Wed Jul 15 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"The density of development allowed by zoning increases near fixed transit lines. So while the development on Elizabeth may be a bad example, the city expects to see increased tax revenues from taller buildings with more units that will be developed along the streetcar routes (I believe there's a study on Portland's streetcar that mentions this). To Niner's point, there are many developers who are acquiring/holding land along the proposed routes because of the streetcar and the increased investment it will spur along the way as there is less risk in developing projects near fixed lines of transportation."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NinerNational,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"So then by your own argument it is the increase in density that is increasing the value, not the streetcar. If they granted the same density to other parts of the city presumably those parts would have increased development and property values too.  The developers are buying the land because they can get around what would otherwise be poor zoning. They are not buying it because of the streetcar (in contrast they are buying/did buy land to be on the light rail because of the light rail.)  My point is that in the original post ninernational argued that all of the increase in property taxes was due to the streetcar. That is simply not true. The streetcar may have some positive marginal affect, but it is not responsible for all of the increase."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,locolarue,3,Thu Jul 16 14:04:50 2015 UTC,"So then by your own argument it is the increase in density that is increasing the value, not the streetcar   I'm saying that the streetcar allows for the higher density development along its route because the surrounding land can be rezoned as TOD (Transit Oriented Development). ""These zoning districts are meant to create high density transit supportive development around transit stations, typically the area within one-half (1/2) mile walking distance from the transit station, which represents a 10-minute walk.""   As a result, developers are prospecting knowing that if the streetcar is approved/built they can apply for TOD zoning and build a much larger development.  Hopefully that clarifies the point I was making about the implications of development along the streetcar."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NinerNational,2,Thu Jul 16 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"Clay Grubb has been hoarding that land for years because of the promise of street car being built there.  Would it have gotten developed eventually anyway? Sure, but that kind of scale and retail would be a lot less likely.   Streetcar gives this neighborhood promise of being  more than just a medical office and cpcc district."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,locolarue,-2,Thu Jul 16 02:44:06 2015 UTC,virtually useless as a mode of transportation in my opinion...value that it adds in the form of development    I think you need to reread that sentence. Pretty sure it doesn't make sense.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NinerNational,2,Thu Jul 16 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"Sure the streetcar is virtually useless as a mode of transportation in my opinion, but the $$$$$ value that it adds in the form of development is a net positive to the city.   This is the full sentence:  ""Sure the streetcar is virtually useless as a mode of transportation in my opinion, but the $$$$$ value that it adds in the form of development is a net positive to the city.""  How doesn't that make sense?"
Charlotte,3ddy5n,rugger62,0,Thu Jul 16 13:13:04 2015 UTC,"Ooookaaaay.   The development is predicated on there being more people in the area, either living, working, or traveling, in order to make business ventures exposed to more people and thus, more successful...but if the streetcar is useless as a form of transportation, why exactly is there going to be more people in the area? Who is going to invest in such projects or plan for such projects to be built in the first place if it's ""virtually useless""?"
Charlotte,3ddy5n,ryanman,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:07 2015 UTC,"All I meant was it does little to improve the transit situation in the city. It directly impacts that people that will live next to it, but its actual impact to traffic and transportation to the greater Charlotte area is virtually nothing. It doesn't do anything from a transportation perspective that a bus cannot already do.  Despite that, it (and the plan for future expansion), makes the Elizabeth Ave. corridor extremely attractive for mixed use development. Development always follows inner city rail infrastructure and the streetcar will be no different."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,rugger62,2,Thu Jul 16 15:45:02 2015 UTC,The entire 2nd sentence. The federal gvmt paid $25 million for Phase 1 and Charlotte paid $12. I think it's $25 million each for Phase 2 which is what City Council is fighting about right now.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,hatervision,0,Thu Jul 16 14:02:31 2015 UTC,But I did not mean the money should have gone to the university. I meant the rail expansion in that direction.  Finally all this quibbling about where the money came  from is fucking asinine. Who gives a shit if it was federal money? It was still an enormous amount of cash emptied into a tiny expansion that does NOTHING to help commuters or connect the outer portions of the city.  Its okay if you disagree but please don't misconstrue my argument. In my opinion a single dollar being spent on a mile long rail that has the added bonus of hurting intracity vehicle traffic is too much.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,CharMeckSchools,2,Thu Jul 16 14:35:36 2015 UTC,"This was Anthony Foxx's baby and part of the reason why he's the transportation secretary now. I think once the entire line is complete, we'll actually see the benefits of connections between areas to the East & West of Uptown."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,hatervision,-3,Thu Jul 16 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"God forbid they should put more money into CMS school system.  This streetcar is just a novelty for people to occasionally ride while on a date or something, but it's not something I picture a lot of people using on a daily basis."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,nexusheli,3,Wed Jul 15 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"We tend to stop and think that, ultimately, these are decisions that our elected officials make as a direct reflection of the desires of the community that puts them in office.

Charlotte,3ddy5n,thebuiltclt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:23 2015 UTC,The construction in the CPCC Elizabeth area was the start of the whole building process.  It was never pulled out because it had not been put into operation yet.  This street car line is the one that goes from the hospital to 7th street right down Elizabeth which is the same one I think you are talking about.   That was just the first portion of track that was put down.
Charlotte,3ddy5n,NinerNational,-2,Wed Jul 15 18:55:42 2015 UTC,Just looked at the map. The tracks along CPCC campus (from hawthorn hospital all the way to King) Was done long long time ago and it had a street car running on it +6 years ago. I know that because I used to go there and I saw it on the tracks. I thought the whole project was scraped since they stopped having street cars on there.   Idk maybe I am missing something..
Charlotte,3ddy5n,SomethingNew71,5,Thu Jul 16 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you were there in 1935, when a trolley line went up Elizabeth, then south down Queens Rd and north up to 7th street.   (dashed lines are original trolley routes: http://gis.mecklenburgcountync.gov/historicweb/middle.asp?imagename=Charlotte_Official_Map_of_Charlotte_1935.jpg)"
Charlotte,3ddy5n,jon1045,3,Thu Jul 16 03:26:31 2015 UTC,"The tracks were put in back in 2006 because they were already doing improvements to the road anyway and they didn't want to dig the road up a second time in a decade.  What you saw were diesel buses that looked like trolley's. The streetcar today requires an electric cantenary  overhead and that wasn't installed over any portion of the track until 2015.  These trolleys were running in SouthEnd back in like 2006 though, on the light rail tracks, so it is possible you are confusing it with that as well. A trolley line was established in the late 90s or early 2000s in Charlotte by the historic commission and that ran from SouthEnd to 9th street until it was forced off the tracks by light rail."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,rugger62,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yes you see the that they were done earlier than the rest of the track because high fiber power conduit was placed under Elizabeth by Duke energy.  Duke Energy worked an agreement with the city and they did their construction in tandem on that portion of the line.  However I worked at CPCC for 9 years, from the start of the construction on Elizabeth until the end of that portion.  They never operated the line before they finished the entire project. in the last few months.  The power lines over the rail were not installed on the tracks above Elizabeth until recently much less trucking out a trolley to run down the 1000ft of line from the hospital to CPCC since there was no connection to the rest of the light rail."
Charlotte,3ddy5n,jon1045,0,Thu Jul 16 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"Toll lanes. Somebody is getting rich off that fiasco and the rest of us are getting it railroaded down our throats. No one wants it, it does not make sense, and it will make traffic worse."

Some places to consider:   Madison Park - 15-20 minutes from uptown, houses range from about 275 - 350 (outliers on both ends).  Houses are generally all built in the 60s.  Newly remodeled homes will be closer to the 350 mark.  Sq. ftage will run about 1600-2200.  Schools are not a selling point here Quail Hollow Estates - 15-20 minutes from uptown.  Established neighborhood, homes built in the 80s, a lot of brick homes.  Decent school system.  You can get 2200-3000 sq. ft. for $315 - $350k.  The larger ones will be less remodeled if they are within your price point.  This is where we actually ended up buying Plaza Midwood - Close to uptown.  Houses are closer together, smaller yards.  Homes are typically taller than they are wide.  Prices can be well above $350 here. Elizabeth - Close to uptown.  Homes here are creeping above the $350k price range, but you can still find some smaller older homes in your price range. Park South Station - 15 minutes or so from uptown.  New construction, decent size, not a lot of yard.  Houses are on top of each other, but that's not a bad thing for everyone.  Homes are built by Pulte which I've heard is a decent construction company.  I'm sure googling there name will bring up plenty of horror stories, though, just like every other developer.   There are tons of areas, but those are just some to get you started.  Once you get below pineville-matthews, you might struggle to get to uptown in under 30 minutes during rush hour.  The trade-off is you'll have a lot of options and variety.    I just went through the house hunting process, so feel free to PM if you have any questions.."
Charlotte,3dcua5,ShadowRex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:44 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the great recommendations! We're still trying to figure out how much trade off we're willing to make for commute vs home options.    EDIT: I just looked up the Quail Hollow location and we actually go to church at Forest Hill which is right on Park Road as well.
Charlotte,3dcua5,nexusheli,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:59:31 2015 UTC,"With $350k to work with you can literally live just about anywhere within 15 miles of uptown.  $300k will get you quite a bit for your money in the Steele Creek area or even further south to Tega Cay, Fort Mill, or Lake Wylie and save the property tax.  Consider also Ballantyne and south, towards Waxhaw, or even in Myer's Park and the surrounding area near South Park mall.  Any of these areas will meet your other requirements."
Charlotte,3dcua5,ShadowRex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:06:02 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks for your suggestions. I looked a little in Myer's Park but for the size we're looking for (3-4 Bed, 2+ bath) the prices were a little out of our range."
Charlotte,3dcua5,nexusheli,0,Wed Jul 15 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as you can tell MP is a little higher-dollar, but if you're not looking to buy right away just keep your eyes open and you might find a deal."
Charlotte,3dcua5,ShadowRex,2,Wed Jul 15 18:00:25 2015 UTC,My biggest concern for some of the farther areas is the commute. I've heard horror stories about rush hour traffic...
Charlotte,3dcua5,nexusheli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"It just depends on where you are vs where you need to be - if you work a normal 9 to 5 in the uptown area, then your 15 mile commute from Waxhaw will take you closer to 45mins in traffic.  If you have a semi-flexible schedule you can get around it pretty easily.  For a while I worked in Steele Creek and lived in Ballantyne - 13mi door to door would take me 15 minutes when I worked 6a to 3p, but when I went to 9a to 5:30p my commute home shot up to 40 minutes because I was fighting all the traffic that was also headed to Ballantyne from uptown.  That said, anything on the south to southwest side will let you get to the Lynx station in Pineville pretty easily, then you can ride that the 20~25min uptown if that's where you're working."
Charlotte,3dcua5,ShadowRex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm working in uptown, usually 8-5 but could probably do 7:30-4:30. I've heard if coming from Fort Mill to just drive to the Lynx and then take that in."

Charlotte,3dcua5,TyGO28,2,Wed Jul 15 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"Cheap is relative, do you have a specific range in mind?  For chains, there is always Jimmy John's, Panera, Salsarita's, Qdoba, and others.  Outside of that, KO Sushi has some decent sushi takeout for an affordable price.  My personal favorite is little village grill on Trade (can be a bit of a walk depending where you are in uptown), they have excellent gyros and french fries!"
Charlotte,3dcua5,tschn012,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I was thinking somewhere around like the $10 and below maybe $12 and below.

Charlotte,3ddgmu,w0rkac,6,Wed Jul 15 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"whoever signed the title last needs to send it into the DMV and have it properly transferred to their name.  Once they recieve a clean title in their name, it can then be signed over to you.  Phil had no legal right to sell the vehicle, and Mick is in all sorts of violation for not transferring the title and will probably have to pay some fees.  If they wont play ball and correct the situation or give your money back, you'll have to take them to court.  You wont get a title from SC any other way.   Always check the title before exchanging money."

I also have to throw the White Water Center out there. It was a blast. There are tons of local breweries, and I know for sure that the Olde Mecklenburg Brewery does free tours at 2, 3, and 4 PM on the weekends (along with having an amazing beirgarten - an indoor and outdoor restaurant and bar with all their brews on tap). Muddy River Distillery is also a great local rum distillery that does samples (tour isn't free, but the rum is great). Epicenter is good for tons of stuff to do in one place - shopping, eating, movies, getting hammered. I hope you guys have fun!"

Charlotte,3dblda,IGuessIamYouThen,7,Wed Jul 15 00:47:27 2015 UTC,"Hey OP.  If you want to make your experience memorable, I'd plan on renting a car.  I don't think there is much in downtown Charlotte that would really wow you.  That said, there is a whole lot close by that you would enjoy.  If I were in your shoes, I'd consider the following:   Lunch in the Noda Neighborhood.  Noda is a somewhat trendy neighborhood here in Charlotte.  Grab a bite and a local beer, then spend a couple hours exploring the local shopping.  Cabo Fish Taco seems to be a popular restaurant there. Dinner at Alexander Michaels in the Historic Fourth Ward.  The title says it all, this is a somewhat historic part of town.  Alexander Michaels is a quaint restaurant in a truly charming neighborhood.  You can take an inexpensive carriage ride, then have dinner.  Make sure to spend some time walking the neighborhood.  You could even take a ghost tour if that's your thing. If you have a little extra cash to spend, you could have dinner at the McNish House, also in the Fourth Ward.  They were voted the most romantic restaurant in Charlotte.  This place is expensive though.  They ran a Groupon for awhile, it might still be running. Plan a day hike to Stone Mountain.  (The one in NC). This is about 90 minutes from downtown Charlotte.  The hike is beautiful, and there is a waterfall you can swim in.  Kings Mountain is good too...but I'm a sucker for waterfalls. Spend a day/night in Asheville.   Asheville, is a couple hours outside of the city, but absolutely worth the drive.  I have only been there once when I drove through, but I plan to spend a long weekend there.  You will find a plethora of outdoor activities, beautiful views, and an awesome trendy town that reminds me of Northern Minnesota. (Minus the snow) I  feel compelled to recommend Biltmore although I have not made it there yet.  Biltmore is the largest privately owned residence in the whole country.  As I understand it, you could kill a whole day there.  I believe it is somewhere near Asheville, so you could plan those two days together. Charlotte has a semi pro baseball team.  I believe they are a feeder team to the White Sox.   The stadium is downtown, and it's new.  You can get standing room tickets for $8.  The beer is right around the $10 mark, but if you like baseball you'll like the stadium.  Im certain somebody will recommend the White Water Center.  Charlotte is home to a world class white water rafting training facility.  Interestingly, they have chosen to build a bar overlooking the rapids.  You can raft, paddle board, or kayak in the water.  They also have a zip line course (I think) and some pretty awesome mountain biking trails.    Otherwise you can just go grab a beer, listen to some live music, and watch the shenanigans.   If you are staying downtown and you just want to go out and get shitfaced, Epicentre is a sort of outdoor/indoor entertainment/drinking place.  I don't think you will find it memorable, but it is certainly unique by design.    Questions?  Edit:  I should note that I have only been here for like 8 months, so I'm still learning about the place."

Charlotte,3d8nuh,rugger62,2,Tue Jul 14 12:55:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that I'm opposed to this sort of idea, because Ill admit that my incite into this is foggy, but my initial thoughts are that it seems borderline cult-ish. At the very least a sort of throwback to hippie communes. It seems to me that a private community like this would inevitably develop a sort of hierarchy within the walls. I guess it's just not something that I see myself being a part of. My main questions (after reading the site, because I was not able to listen to the broadcast) would be: Are the living quarters purchased or are they leased like an apartment? Can you break the lease easily? If it's private purchase, how strict/smooth are real estate laws in this sort of setting? Is there a sort of HOA? Are the residents free to invite ""outsiders"" over to the private community for gatherings as guests, or are there strict rules? Maybe I'm overthinking all of this, but it's just what comes to mind, without trying to be insensitive to what is, quite possibly, a wonderful idea for the right demographic. I'm more in hopes of tiny houses becoming a thing, providing the zoning laws can be figured out with relative ease."
Charlotte,3d8nuh,Charliemander,2,Tue Jul 14 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"You do find more liberal hippie types doing it, but it's certainly not a cult. Everyone who buys in gets to participate in decision making and governance. Just think of it as a subdivision with potlucks. You should check out the national website for detailed info, but here's what I know. I'm a member of the Charlotte group.   most communities have individual houses that are purchased. The owners can choose to rent out the house if they want. Leasing rules would be established by the community.  standard real estate laws would apply since each house is privately owned. Most places do have a community house for gatherings; that is probably owned by the LLC or through shares. The steering committee would be like the HOA. Charlotte's structure is that the owners are the members of the committee. It would be a private community just like a subdivision is private. Maybe not everyone can use the pool, but owners can invite whoever they want over. I will tell you my experience with Asheville's community is that people are very welcoming. And they've never asked me to drink Kool-aid :)"

I take my car there twice a week and it totally pays off. Vacuum cleaners available for free."
Charlotte,3dam6n,tallpilot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:19:36 2015 UTC,Is it a touch less car wash? And a do-it-yourself? Or is it like Autobell and you send your car through?
Charlotte,3dam6n,rustyshakelford,2,Wed Jul 15 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"Its like Autobell, but u sit inside of the car while washing it. Their machine uses soft clothes (if you refer as touchless the ones some gas stations have it, in which only water is sprayed, but no clothes it is not touchless)... The vacuum part is self service. They have a bunch of bug and water repellent which makes a difference when it rains. I find the service convenient and most times i only need the car washed outside anyways, I got the monthly pass which is roughly the same as 2 car washes at Autobell. The only inconvenience is location, depending where you live. Its about a 4 minute drive from 277 towards the airport. I don't find it bad.

Charlotte,3d6xuw,interwebbing,5,Tue Jul 14 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"Seriously. You can get a huge hotdog and soda at Costco for like $2.50. If you're in between homes/on-the-go, that's not bad. Plus free samples, and you don't have to hold a membership for any of this.  They probably don't live on the streets. I met students at CPCC who live in Noda/Davidson in group homes, and I don't doubt they panhandled for food sometimes."

When I go out to eat with my family, anything that doesn't get eaten, I put in a box and if we pass someone on the side of the road, I give it to them. I'd rather give food than beer money. If they are scamming people, fine, I didn't give them money. But if they are really hungry and trying to get money to eat, I just helped someone out. Everyone goes through rough times, the news network doesn't need to be a dick to them at a time like this."

Therfore I feel it is best for him and her if I find him a new home! He does well with dogs and he loves kids! He does fine with my other cat it's just the one he doesn't get along with.

Charlotte,3d5c24,Littlesoldierboy,3,Mon Jul 13 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"Long post incoming, I'll try to keep it brief. I 100% believe that if you have the determination and discipline, you can reach your goals wasting minimal money on trainers and supplements if you do your research thoroughly.   I started on my fitness journey 4 years ago with 0 knowledge and having been overweight my whole life. Through continuous research and multiple imbalances/injuries, I have made so many gains as well as lifestyle changes for the better.   The misconception of a personal trainer is that they will make your training better and easier. That is more of the case when you are lazy to the point where you can't muster the motivation to do it yourself. To be a certified personal trainer all you need to do is pass the CPT, it's a quick test and costs like $300. Their knowledge is basic, and they do not get paid much, so the level of attention is nothing spectacular. A workout routine and measuring your progress is not worth a personal trainer.  Here's a quick outline for what you can start reading on and will help determine your steps to reach your goals.  -Training Goals (Strength, Muscle Building, Fat Loss)  These are the 3 main types of general training, to reach each goal you should tailor your workout exercises, sets and repetitions to hit a goal. You can try to hit 2 goals at once, but if you don't primarily focus on one goal, you are not optimizing your training.   -Diet (Nutrition and Supplementation) Abs are made in the kitchen, and you cannot target fatloss to just one area. When you lose fat it trims off a layer on the entire body, the abdomen area just happens to store the most fat so it is the last to go and more stubborn to go. Macro's are the way one builds their diets.   When you research the different training programs and diet needed and gain a good fundamental understanding, you are able to find ways to optimize your training and diet to reach your goals faster. Here’s my 2 min crash course to understanding why those athletes and bodybuilders weigh there food. Calories are broken into 3 categories – Protein, Fats, and Carbohydrates. 1 gram of Protein and Carbohydrate is 4 calories, and 1 gram of Fat is 9 calories. Now it takes into account of the source of calories, which is how people break it down to focus on their needs.  Ie For my goals I chose to use a 60/20/20 macro. That means 60% of my calories come from protein, 20% from carbs and 20% from fat. I use this generally when I am cutting fat. I up the carbs when I am looking to gain muscle. From there I choose my target calories and then build a food schedule from there. With the knowledge I have, even though charts indicate my maintenance is ~2400 calories, through my own trials I found that it is lower, which increased my fat loss when I adjusted by lowering my daily intake from 2000 to 1800.   Bodybuilding.com and bodybuilding.com/forums can answer 95% of any questions. If you have any questions or topics just type in topic +bodybuilding.com and there will most definitely be a thread and discussion on the topic. (ie ""Muscle Building Diet bodybuilding.com"")  Tell yourself you can do it and get it done. Don't use any excuses, and don't rely on a personal trainer to do the work. There are hundreds of free programs to follow online and between youtube and bodybuilding.com you have all the free information you need.   Good luck and feel free to PM me with any questions."

Charlotte,3d1d8u,adoneran,2,Mon Jul 13 11:53:54 2015 UTC,TWC Maxx set to roll out soon.  Standard internet which is around 30-35 a month will be 50x5 which is more than enough for your basic streaming and downloading.  50x5 is equivalent to their current highest tier service.  I'm not sure on HD antenna since I get local stuff for free since TWC is too lazy to shut off local channels at my apartment complex.
Charlotte,3d1d8u,phoenixcolt,2,Sun Jul 12 19:20:59 2015 UTC,Those channels are going away without the DTA eventually.
Charlotte,3d1d8u,Baidoku,2,Sun Jul 12 19:30:23 2015 UTC,yup but for now they're free. I'll get an antenna when they go away but not before then

Charlotte,3d1d8u,Jherden,2,Thu Jul 16 21:35:00 2015 UTC,"Since Maxx is coming out, do you recommend buying a lower speed internet level (since it will be upgraded) or going ahead and getting 50x5?"
Charlotte,3d1d8u,phoenixcolt,2,Mon Jul 13 12:46:32 2015 UTC,"It depends on your needs really.  Streaming on Netflix would be just fine (albeit occasionally slow) on the ""basic"" subscription which is currently 3x1 and will upgraded to 10x1.  You can see the chart of upgrades here.  If you're doing more than that (anything gaming related or downloading large files) I would recommend at least standard.  I'm currently on Turbo (20x2) and play a lot of games online.  The actual playing is fine but the downloading can be a bitch.  I never have any problems streaming Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. and I rarely get my advertised speed anyway.  I'll be downgrading to standard when Maxx rolls out because my modem can't handle anything more than 50x5 anyway."

While I'm single, I do have a big aquarium that needs frequent water changes.  My last bill was $60 because I spent some water trying to keep it from completely dying.  Where they will get you is on sewer and on impervious area of your building.  The water charge on my bill is like, $2.98.  But with the sewer, daily availability rate and impervious area fees, it shoots it to nearly $40.  My neighbor has her parents with her now and they're around $50 for 3 people."

No gear is necessary to show up, although if you decide to get into it seriously most people will want to purchase their own equipment as finances permit.

Charlotte,3cyfpn,NinerNational,2,Sun Jul 12 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"Well, there's always the malls: the one in Pineville you visited, South Park, Concord Mills, and Northlake.  Probably not what you're looking for though.  There are some decent shopping centers that might be able to hold your interest for an hour or so.  Park Road Shopping Center comes to mind.  From there, you can walk on the Little Sugar Creek Greenway to Freedom Park if you want to kill some more time.  Another place you can try is the Metropolitan development close to Uptown.  Actually, that's also on the greenway.  Neither one of those places are probably as large as you're looking for, though."

If true, uptown may finally be getting some real retail in a few years. This is along Stonewall and Tryon, so paired with Tryon Place a d the development further down Stonewall with a Whole Foods and other retail, there may be a good retail stroll district in the future."

Yea. That's walkable. Lol. We are a city that doesn't support small square footages. Property managers love large and faux long leases over small entrepreneurs. So. You have a driving shopping city.

Parking lot fills up when even moderately busy. People aren't pleasant to deal with when they've spent the previous 15 minutes circling the parking lot.  Actual butcher shop floorspace is too small already for our # of employees, and we need at least 2 more.  Pay is already below market averages, and is completely unrelated to department performance.  Grass-fed seeking customers are a huge time suck. They ask stupid questions, don't believe your answers anyway, and obliviously seek validation of their lifestyle while actual customers rot in line behind them and I dodge my irritated overworked coworkers.  It's a shit show. Today, what I feared already started happening.  Your absurd assumption of my desires and immediate hostility are a perfect illustration of the mentality that makes y'all so hard to deal with.

Charlotte,3cpma7,Keeps_Forgetting_P,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:08:38 2015 UTC,"If they build more parking, parking passes will increase in cost more. Parking decks are expensive and can run over $10,000 per parking spot to construct. If they sold parking spots 1:1 for supply and demand it would take them 20 years to pay off a deck.  Instead it is based on average number of students on campus. This often results in insufficient parking during peak usage, especially during exams.  I just ways lived close enough to campus to walk so I didn't have to deal with it. I walked over a mile to class each way because I'd rather do that than drive around a parking deck for 10 minutes while a line of cars follows someone to their car so they can take their spot.  Unc charlotte has a bad problem with students living less than a mile from school and wanting to drive. I don't understand it."
Charlotte,3cpma7,NinerNational,2,Sun Jul 12 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"Right now uncc also has a problem with accepting more students then they have the proper facilities to accomodate. While parking is one example of this, there are plenty of other issues which are reaching critical mass. If they don't start updating equipment and facilities to match the dramatic increase in enrollment, student's quality of education will soon begin to suffer.   Yes a 1:1 student to parking spot ratio is not a possibility, but they are so far off the mark its not even funny. I've driven around for 45 minutes to an hour before just trying to find a parking spot. That is ludacris especially when I'm paying $450 a year for the parking I can't find. They are able to dump rediculous amounts of money into building a football stadium in order to bring more students to the school but they don't have enough money to build parking lots/decks so they can..... I don't know actually get to there classes. UNCC is notoriously a commuter school; They know that a very significant portion of there student population drives to school everyday, but in 20 years they haven't been able to gain any ground on the issue (They're own flyers state exactly that)? How about this one, the faculty/staff have there own parking lots, but they have to pay the same $450 dollars a year to gain access to commuter parking + another $100 in order to use the faculty parking lots. As a result the faculty lots sit practically empty and the professors park in commuter parking, leaving even less space for the rest of us. If they really wanted to try and fix the problem they would either stop charging for faculty parking or turn the faculty parking into commuter parking. Instead they have people driving around endlessly right next to an empty factulty parking lot. What sense does any of this make? Again I say they bring it on themselves."

It also lets the local economy handle the construction of permanent residences, which seems to be better for the overall development of the country.

Charlotte,3cp8j6,violetfield,2,Thu Jul 9 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"The lockers over at Fury are the cheapest in the park (I'm fairly sure anyways at $1/hour and a minimum of 2 hours) and you'll have to use one to ride if you have ANYTHING that you can't/don't want to take on the ride. This includes flip flops, backpacks, etc. You have to buy a locker unless you've got someone who isn't riding who can hold your stuff. There is nowhere to put this kind of stuff in the ride station.   Season pass perks: most everywhere you go, you can get 10% off your purchase when you show your pass. If you guys don't have souvenir cups yet, it's worth it to buy the 4 pack at the park to get the discounted cup rate. If you have time, buy cups online if you want less than 4. Cheapest way to get drinks, unless you just want water, which is free everywhere! Harmony Hall has the best water cups because they're full size. Harmony Hall is probably the best place to eat overall aside from Wings. Both really nice, air conditioned, generally well-kept places. Harmony Hall really does have something for everyone in terms of food. Big portions, too. Two of your kids could almost definitely share one thing of their baked pasta.   There are a couple of fun little musical shows that your family might enjoy at the Carowinds Theatre (I think this is like a 50's themed show) and inside Harmony Hall (if you like country music). They are cheesy, but entertaining as far as free theme park musicals go."

Charlotte,3cjo2u,caller-number-four,0,Wed Jul 8 15:31:17 2015 UTC,8 downstream is capable of 343 Mbps which is over the max speed of the new plans. This is probably why they selected 300 Mbps because anything higher would force TWC to upgrade even more rented modems.
Charlotte,3cjo2u,Abyssul,5,Wed Jul 8 15:25:52 2015 UTC,8 downstream channel capabile modems will be limited to 100/10.  You have to have a 16 channel modem for 200/20 or 300/20.

Charlotte,3cjo2u,Abyssul,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"This is what TWC is doing in other markets.  It is their specification on how they're running their network.

Charlotte,3cjo2u,SerpentDrago,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:39:36 2015 UTC,Cool thanks.  I guess I need to have TWC upgrade my modem when the MAXX upgrade rolls out since I only have 8 downstream channels.

Charlotte,3cjo2u,CardMechanic,3,Thu Jul 9 00:42:25 2015 UTC,Any time you call a carrier deny any use of a router and tell them you are hardwired in. Saves a lot of hassle.
Charlotte,3cjo2u,Tin_Whiskers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"I was unclear; I DO have a Wireless N router, but the issue is with their cable ""modem"", the nice little black unit I've had for years.

Sometimes that'll do for a few MINUTES.  I'm... starting to become annoyed."
Charlotte,3cjo2u,DJTet,2,Thu Jul 9 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you tell the carrier you have a router they will try their best to blame it on that though: even if the problem is obviously their modem.  It sounds like your router is losing its uplink authentication. Have you noticed any pattern on when it happens?  It could honestly be anything from a bad modem to a card going bad at the CO. Regardless, they should see the disconnects and it should be enough to warrant a line tech."

Charlotte,3cjo2u,timag,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:56:34 2015 UTC,"Everyone in the ""Charlotte"" service area will get upgraded to the MAXX services, but it depends on what service level you have - the top two tiers (which go to 200 and 300Mbps down) require 16 channels, all the others will get away with 8.  If you're getting 50/5 right now you'll get upgraded to 300 and require the 16 channel modem to take advantage."

Very convenient, indeed. I did wonder at the time if they have something that recognizes MAC addresses that aren't their own leased equipment and messes with them to prompt the customer to pay the Time Warner Tax.

My situation was really odd - hard-wired I was getting poor speeds for a bit, then when things started to stabilized I realized my WiFi hadn't come around - swapped out my router (time for a new one anyway) and it still wasn't any better.  Did some googling and it turned out an automatic windows driver update actually caused my WiFi card to have issues (common on my laptop) and a simple driver rollback got me back to full speed."

Charlotte,3cjr8o,slashp,3,Wed Jul 8 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"I found this law journal article which explains more about the three-tier system and why the state says it was implemented in the first place.  FTA:   In creating the laws regulating the relations between brewers and wholesalers, the North Carolina legislature has stated that the laws are necessary to, among other things, “(1) Maintain stability and healthy competition in the  malt beverage industry in this State. (2) Promote and maintain a sound, stable and viable three-tier system of distribution of malt beverages to the public.”   So, their reasoning is: foster competition and grow the beer industry. You'll see elsewhere in the law journal article that the state issues permits to each step in the tier (brewer, wholesaler, and retailer), so I'm sure money is more of a motivator than anything. The law article is long but informative and interesting.   Also, FTA:   The time has come for all states, not just North Carolina, to move on  from  the  post-Prohibition laws strangling the brewing industry. In repealing the three-tier structure and moving toward a market centered approach, North Carolina can establish itself as a leader in moving toward market competitiveness and make itself a friend  to  brewers and consumers alike, thus truly accomplishing the legislature’s stated goal of using the  craft brewing  industry to create jobs and provide a tourism draw into the state."

The navigator mistakenly pulled the emergency release pin which resulted in the bomb falling out of the plane. Although the bomb was not armed with the trigger (a removable capsule of fissionable material which was securely stored in a containment area on board the plane), it nevertheless contained a high-explosive detonator. The resulting explosion created a crater estimated to be 75 feet (23 m) wide and 25–35 feet (7.6–10.7 m) deep. It destroyed a local playhouse, near the residence of Walter Gregg, and leveled nearby trees. Nobody was killed by the blast but several people in Gregg's family were injured.

Charlotte,3cixpw,dirtywindows,2,Thu Jul 9 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Depends where in Gastonia. There's Freeman's Pub which is downtown, and there's tavern 24 in the plaza with the target and dicks. Those are about the only two I know of that are decent."
Charlotte,3cixpw,CrownTownLibrarian,2,Wed Jul 8 15:13:33 2015 UTC,Stay away from places like the frontier club and most of the bars on the west side. trust me.

What neighborhoods would you recommend to a young family on eiter the north or west sides of charlotte?
Charlotte,3cixpw,Johopo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:00:49 2015 UTC,What sort of things are you looking for?  Good schools?  Easy access to the city center?  Vibrant culture?
Charlotte,3cixpw,LalliJay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:58:19 2015 UTC,"Good schools, a kind of small town feel, access to the city isn't a main priority.  My husband is looking to work in huntersville and I should be working from home."
Charlotte,3cixpw,Johopo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't see any reason you guys shouldn't look at living in Huntersville.  The schools have a good reputation and the area is overall very nice (rich).  77 is a mess during rush hour, but I guess that wouldn't really be a issue for yall.  Plus, you're close to the lake.  Now, if the small town feel is really important to you, then maybe you should also look at Davidson, a little north of Huntersville.  It tends to be more liberal and artsy than the other suburbs, thanks to the college."
Charlotte,3cixpw,954gooner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"Also from South Florida. I'm trying to find an area as similar to Cooper City as possible, maybe a little more rural.

They have events all the time. Like Science on the Rocks. Art museums, take your pick. If you want low key art things, look around the NoDa area.  The NC Music Factory is a good music spot and they have a lot of little restaurants too.   I hope you guys have a great time!!"

We're starting to look for places to live, but have no idea which part of town we'll settle on.  I've applied for a few positions east of Uptown, so it would make sense to look near Concord, but I've read mixed things on this sub.   We're real excited to drink all your beer!"
Charlotte,3cixpw,Kittycat-banana,2,Thu Jul 9 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, if you are looking around Concord, I would look into moving to Harrisburg. Its right beside Concord and on the Charlotte/Mecklinburg border. They also have highly rated schools (if that will matter to you). Its also still really close to everything without the city vibe, if thats what you like."
Charlotte,3cixpw,marcnerd,2,Thu Jul 9 01:19:42 2015 UTC,Thank you! The schools will (hopefully) be an issue at some point.  Right now we're looking for a dog-friendly rental for max 12 months. And work. :)
Charlotte,3cixpw,elToribio,2,Thu Jul 9 02:03:08 2015 UTC,Dog friendly rentals are much easier to come by than in Boston. You should have an easy time finding something.

We're just looking for any info at this point, since neither one of us has been here. Thanks in advance!"
Charlotte,3cixpw,Johopo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"You can't really go wrong anywhere near Quail Hollow.  Generally speaking anything between I-77 and Independence boulevard will safe and a little more upscale.  Charlotte has a decent number of dog parks. Davie Park is probably the the closest one to Quail Hollow.  There's also a nice greenway near there where you can walk your dog on a leash.  If you want to get a more general idea about the character of the neighborhoods, I think there's a map on the sidebar which has some short descriptions."

I am currently in a mid-size city in Southwestern VA and will be driving down next Thursday to do final interviews and a tour of the office with whom I will be working. It's all happening VERY quickly so I'm in the process of gathering as much information as I can.   I'm looking at a few apartments; Ridge at Highland Creek, Fairways at Piper Glen, and Century Parkside. Has anyone heard good or bad things about these places? I google mapped them to make sure that they're in a decent driving distance from the office, but beyond that, I don't know much else.   This is the first major move I've done, so I really don't know what to expect. Any tips from those who have done this? Things I should know about the area? What do you guys do for fun?"
Charlotte,3cixpw,Johopo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"Looking at those complexes on the maps, you're looking at all sides of town.  Remember that Charlotte is a pretty big city in terms of land mass, and traffic can get pretty bad here.  You might save yourself some commuter's grief if you limit your search to a smaller area.  In terms of the specific complexes, I can't help you much.  Your best bet is to repost this next Wednesday, or to use one of the apartment rating sites and try to filter out all the noise there.  In terms of fun stuff, Charlotte's got a lot.  There's also some nice parks and greenways, and the city has really good disc golf courses."

The area that Novant is in (Elizabeth) is a great place to live but it is somewhat expensive.  You're also not too far from some trendy area of Charlotte (South End, Plaza Midwood) and some upscale areas (Myers Park, Dilworth).  There are plenty of other perfectly satisfactory neighborhoods nearby, they just don't have anything particularly special that makes them jump out.  This thread gets to be pretty dead once you get past Wednesday, so it might be a good idea to repost your question next week to see if anyone knows of good short term places."

Charlotte,3cjo5c,G_O_B_Bluth,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:53:51 2015 UTC,Hey! Certainly not against adoption but I would like a puppy and it has to be a pug. I've wanted one for years and I can see on there alone that pug pups for adoption aren't very frequent. I'll see again closer to the time :)
Charlotte,3cjo5c,UberPrioritizer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:06:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry this is late but I just saw your post, hopefully you see my reply.   There is an amazing pug rescue that services a few of the surrounding states but has a very large presence in Charlotte called the Mid Atlantic Pug Rescue. They're great people and provide a great service.   If you check out their website and Facebook page they list a number of available dogs, however they often adopt out pugs without listing them due to how many responses they would get for more ""in demand"" dogs like puppies. Instead these dogs go directly to people who have an application on file with them. The best thing you can do is fill out an adoption application now and list that you want a puppy, they will contact you directly when they have one that needs adopting as opposed to putting it up on their social media. My wife and I adopted a 6 month old pug from them just a week after putting our application in.   I highly suggest putting an application in now so that they have time to find you a good match before you move. There's so many dogs that news homes that it's almost silly to go to a breeder over adoption. Also, the price is much more reasonable... the puppy I rescued was originally purchased from a breeder for $2000! Needless to say, the adoption fee was significantly less."

Charlotte,3cd2cx,CardMechanic,5,Mon Jul 6 23:36:52 2015 UTC,I don't think they intend on tearing it down until the end of the season.  As for getting the wood I would guess you could either a) watch the dumpsters or b) call the front office and start asking for contacts.  Better to put your request in now than wait until they start tearing down.
Charlotte,3cd2cx,nexusheli,3,Mon Jul 6 23:44:01 2015 UTC,"Sent them an email when they first announced as I make furniture pieces from reclaimed wood. Haven't heard back yet, would recommend calling at the end of the month once they're ready to start the teardown"
Charlotte,3cd2cx,worldofjay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:04:58 2015 UTC,"Sent them an email    Yeah, that won't get you anywhere, you're going to have to call and harass them over and over - a big commercial operation like that is going to see an email about getting junk from something they're tearing down and if it didn't automatically get caught up in a spam filter it's going straight in the trash can of the intern that sees it."
Charlotte,3cd2cx,nexusheli,4,Tue Jul 7 15:46:26 2015 UTC,Last day of operation is July 26th. I would suggest calling the call center to see if they're going to give away/sell the boards. Their phone number is 803-548-5300. Good luck!

Also, I'd LOVE to have a piece of wood from the demo, and would be very interested in getting a pen from you if you do end up making some... Roughly, what kind of prices do those types of things sell for?"
Charlotte,3cd2cx,Charliemander,5,Tue Jul 7 00:35:49 2015 UTC,It would mostly depend on what it costs me to get it....
Charlotte,3cd2cx,Charliemander,2,Tue Jul 7 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically, lets say that they just say ""sure, come and grab a beam or two... or three or four..."" and the cost of materials is basically free, and all you put into it is gas money to pick it up..."
Charlotte,3cd2cx,that___dude,5,Tue Jul 7 01:04:41 2015 UTC,Probably $20-$30 depending on the hardware I used. Pen kits are around $8 plus my time in completing one.

If they're interested in craft beer you can check out any of the breweries - most serve food as well. Activities - the Whitewater center is great and unique. Partying - depends on your style. Epicenter, music factory, NoDa, Plaza Midwood, University, or Montford. All have food places and bars.   Like I said, depends on where you live and what your preference is.

Just speculation on my part but there really weren't many that I remember with the groundshaking boom, if any. Still a nice show though. Just wish they centralized it a bit more for maximum visibility from all directions of uptown."
Charlotte,3c6ia6,gustavvonkittymush,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:48:16 2015 UTC,It's a great spot. Probably another 5-10 people set up with tripods beside me. And then a ton of people just watching. They are definitely limited with the size of fireworks they can let off at this location because of the fallout. Thankfully the show lasted a bit longer then I thought it would.

Charlotte,3c7ggp,gruntledcurmudgeon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, the traders needed to be able to stand up and see across the room without obstruction.

Charlotte,3c06k3,ktwynn,17,Fri Jul 3 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"You could hit 7th St Market where you can get, arguably, the city's best coffee (Not Just Coffee) in addition to sushi, crepes, Pure Pizza (which i think is still there, though for pizza it's not especially cheap), kickass grilled cheeses at the cheese shop whose name escapes me right now, or a few other options. Also, parking is validated in the deck, big plus.  If you like hot dogs, Green's is the spot, right near the baseball field. Mert's has good soul food at not too crazy prices, I also hear good thing's about Lola's but have yet to go myself. Personally I'm not a fan of King's Kitchen, even though their premise is a great idea. I know I'm missing other stuff, good luck!"

It's tilted to the left, and she feels like she's gonna roll off in the floor. Wouldn't shut up about it. I think ok, my mattress is old, I'll run out and get a new one.   Got the new mattress and box springs, and still a no-go. I can feel an obvious difference in a positive way, and she's still all ""my back hurts! It's this bed! I can't sleep here!"" Blah blah blah. At this point I thought she just doesn't like the bed frame. It was iron, powder coated black, and kinda gothic. Not really her speed. She's trolling me in effort to get something more ""couple"" friendly. The argument starts again one morning, and in a fit I bust out the tape measure.   Lo and behold, the bed is off... By 3/16"" from left to right. 3/16. I couldn't believe it. I mean, that's some serious Princess and the Pea shit. She laughed hysterically, all ""I told you!"" And shit. So, long story short, I spent countless hours, and thousands of dollars on yet another mattress. This time a Temperpedic (the new bed and box springs? Yeah-had to 86 those, because after a week ""it sags to the middle"". Ugh).  That's why my mattress is on the floor."

Very few blemishes, but mind you it is a used piece.   $10,000. Price is firm! OK, I suck at negotiating. I'll drop the price to FREE, if...   1) You bring enough muscle (two very strong people? Plus me, a mediumly strong man?) to get this piece down my stairs and out to your truck.  2) You and your muscle-people help me move a few other pieces for about 30 minutes to 1 hour max. Perhaps stairs, perhaps not. I got a lot of moving to do. House came with a lot of furniture (divorce, dude just wanted out) and we're just now figuring out what to keep and where.   OPTIONAL: It may behoove us to disassemble the top/sides/bottom first, btw. I probably have the tools necessary, but if you're into carpentry or handiwork, you might bring your tools or come check it out first. This isn't an easy task.

Charlotte,3bs5ap,lykedoctor,3,Wed Jul 1 23:48:00 2015 UTC,"While I'd love to see some variety, when I look at any other town or city, they have a LOT of buildings that look very similar.  I think it's just a product of the decade we live in.  It's ""the style"".  Just how when you drive through Madison Park or many other houses in Charlotte...  All the houses built in the 60s look exactly the same.  If reddit existed then, we'd all be complaining about that too.    Chicago, LA, New York and others are all guilty of it too.

I'm not a fan of the brick selection personally, but it is using much higher quality materials than all the buildings using brick for the first 1-2 floors and hardiplank the rest of the way up.  Solis right at Kenilworth and Morehead looks like crap for sure though.  Keep in mind, color can always be changed. Quarterside in Uptown used to look really bland too.

Charlotte,3bs5ap,rustyshakelford,10,Wed Jul 1 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"Can they actually put some god damn retail on the ground floor?!? How many ""luxury"" apartment buildings have gone up with NOTHING but parking on the ground floor. Even the new Publix offered a few retail outlets and what appeared—a fucking bank and a supercuts.  I can't even name a single coffee shop in the South End other than Nova Bakery. How about some restaurants because there are only a handful in the South End."
Charlotte,3bs5ap,lykedoctor,6,Wed Jul 1 19:51:17 2015 UTC,The ground floor will consist of 2 retail spaces (presumably for restaurants) with one along Camden (approx. 4300 sqft) and one at the corner of Camden & Worthington (approx. 2700 sqft).
Charlotte,3bs5ap,NoyzMaker,4,Wed Jul 1 19:57:33 2015 UTC,sweet... two shops for 25 floors!
Charlotte,3bs5ap,lykedoctor,2,Wed Jul 1 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"just because it is 25 floors doesn't mean it has a footprint that can support tons of shops. I don't know the dimensions of the building, but looking at the rendering, the amount of land it covers looks to be substantially smaller than many of the massive full block 4-6 floor apartments that have been built.  Unfortunately, building retail into buildings is a big risk for developers, so they just roll that additional expense into apartment rent prices to cover themselves. If you do that and price yourself above the other buildings in the area, you're going to make it more difficult to rent your units.  New retail is always going to be exceptionally expensive, so you're likely going to end up with things like large chains. You're not going to get a small locally owned coffee shop to open up in a place with $25/square foot rental prices.  I don't disagree with your point about places needing retail in the bottom, but EVERY building doesn't need it. We simply don't have the density to support block after block of retail space. Creating retail corridors is important and Camden seems to be becoming that for SouthEnd. Virtually that whole street is going to be lined with retail in the future."
Charlotte,3bs5ap,NinerNational,-3,Thu Jul 2 14:04:29 2015 UTC,Seems you noticed a market deficiency. Why don't you open one of the businesses that you mentioned instead of whining about it.
Charlotte,3bs5ap,Jay_Mac,7,Wed Jul 1 21:58:54 2015 UTC,How can I open something when there is no available commercial real estate below these new builds to do so? That's what I'm complaining about. The only development I can give props to is the building on East. Blvd and Kenilworth.
Charlotte,3bs5ap,lykedoctor,2,Wed Jul 1 22:56:38 2015 UTC,How are they going to address overcrowding on the light rail? All these complexes popping up along the blue line make it impossible to get on at most stops in Southend during commuter hours.

Charlotte,3brbwh,thebuiltclt,2,Wed Jul 1 15:36:36 2015 UTC,You could toss a rock and it'll land on a non-profit that would love to have a professional treasurer on board. Do you have any other passions/interests that might narrow the field? Arts? Homeless causes? Education? LGBT? Etc... (i'm not aware of any particular non-prof that provides pro bono finance/accounting services)
Charlotte,3brbwh,CrownTownLibrarian,3,Wed Jul 1 15:27:04 2015 UTC,You could always contact the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Library foundation and offer your services.
