OttawaSenators,3e2k2f,Funkativity,4,Tue Jul 21 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind (for everyone reading) that the player sets a number as high as they can realistically justify through comparables, stats, situation, etc.. Likewise the team does the same but with a low number. And let's not forget that we pay Colin Greening more money than this, so Chiasson/his agent likely have that in their argument.  This is done because the arbitrator usually chooses a number very close to the middle, so each party wants to drive the final price up/down - as is typical of all negotiations. However I certainly agree that Chiasson's price is way farther from the mark than the team's offer, and that the two are unusually far apart (proportionally) in their pricepoints."

OttawaSenators,3e2k2f,Jaycorr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"I could be mistaken, but I believe whatever the arbitrator awards for a value we HAVE to pay it (and likewise Chiasson HAS to accept it). I know there's a special case for when the awarded contract exceeds $3.8M where the team is allowed to walk away from the offer/player, but otherwise we're stuck. Sufficed to say, it sounds as though we're unable to simply ""let him walk"" like on July 1st.  Where I'm doubting my understanding is from yesterday's case with Craig Smith (NSH). They went to arbitration, were given a verdict, then they agreed to a separate 5 year extension immediately after. So there might be some provision that says if both parties agree to something then the arbitration ruling can be avoided, but again I'm uncertain."
OttawaSenators,3e2k2f,Omega613,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"We could always offer the contract then waive him after he signs, I'm sure a team like Buffalo would pick him up.  But I'm sure we could trade him for a third rounder, maybe even a second depending on the team he goes to."
OttawaSenators,3e2k2f,Jaycorr,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah a sign and trade is do-able, so long as he's on board and knows it's happening (so we don't have a Hossa issue again). However we shouldn't be so desperate to get rid of him unless his salary award ends up being way too high (>>$1.5M?). He's not great, and certainly didn't meet our fan-imposed expectations, but he's hardly our worst bottom-6 player and our depth at RW beyond Stone and Ryan is fairly limited."
OttawaSenators,3e2k2f,Omega613,6,Tue Jul 21 19:17:26 2015 UTC,shouldn't he be putting in some goals to justify?  what's his reasoning for 2.45?

OttawaSenators,3e2k2f,HollenFaust,6,Tue Jul 21 15:13:24 2015 UTC,"2.475 million is very close to to Zibanejad's salary, which is almost laughable.   Of course, I guess it's also very close to Greening, too, but it's not like it's a secret that the team regrets that contract."
OttawaSenators,3e2k2f,DawnaBard,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"Given that the contract will likely be 1 year, the AAV will equal the actual value. It's worth noting that Zbad is making $2.0M in real salary next season, while Stone is making $2.25M. Even though Chiasson's requested number is intentionally/artificially high, I think the team has some good recent signings to counter with to drive that down.  And it only just occurred to me, but Chiasson may not be able to use Greening as a comparable if I've understood everything correctly. Here's a summary of arbitration from the Score which states under inadmissable evidence for the hearing:   Any contract signed by an unrestricted free agent   Going by generalfanager, Greening signed his last contract as a UFA, meaning he couldn't be used as a comparable. However, if memory serves, he signed his extension before hitting free agency, so maybe that counting as signed as an RFA? (In the same sense that Chris Wideman never became a UFA because he signed prior to July 1st, which has certain subtle effects on his current/future contract status). I'm unsure though on those finer details."

I don't want to give up on him this early given that he has very limited NHL experience... but even if the club accepts a higher contract on a very short term to see what he could do with more stability in one city and more training/experience, I'd be concerned about what he's going to ask for the following contract given that he/his agent already holds quite a bloated valuation."

We can sign Boyes for what Legwand was making, not like we'd need to clear cap space or roster space. I agree that he could be useful on our roster, but I also see how management might want the 3rd-line role he'd be given to go to younger players who may be able to compare points-wise while also developing a bit along the way. His shootout prowess would also be a little bit less important given how many games will likely end in OT with the new rules in place for this season."
OttawaSenators,3e083g,Omega613,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:30 2015 UTC,Maybe an invitation to training camp? See how he stacks up against the prospects? I fell like he can either prove his worth or a prospect will legitimately earn a spot on the team instead of being given one because no one else is there.
OttawaSenators,3e083g,Donvito613,3,Tue Jul 21 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"and we can move 1-2 of our bottom 6 guys.    I think this (from your original post) is the answer to your question. If you include Wideman (not waiver exempt), Chiasson (unsigned RFA), and Hoffman (unsigned RFA), we already have 23 players on our roster (the maximum allowed) without even giving Prince/Puempel a spot. He can't even compete for a spot against a prospect when we don't even have space for them. How do you plan on just moving one or two guys for Boyes? Heck, even if we manage to make those moves, adding someone like Boyes just starts our roster logjam all over again.  Murray has been try to move Greening for months/years without success. There are also genuinely good and inexpensive bottom-6 players still available through free agency (eg. Fehr, Santorelli, etc.), yet they remain unsigned. It would seem like most teams are set for the time being on depth players (at least until training camps wrap up, giving more time to evaluate), and any that aren't would surely prefer to pick up a ""free"" player from the free agent pool than someone (likely overpaid) from us that with cost them assets (and our player likely would not be any better than some current UFAs).  The only other option we have to make way for Boyes realistically without making trades is by waiving Colin Greening to the AHL. But that free roster spot will deservedly be awarded to one of our AHL standouts. Don't get me wrong, I think Boyes (or Santorelli, or Bergenheim) would be a good addition to our bottom-6 in place of one of several players, but there are logistic blockades which prevent this."

Most of your presence in this sub - from the context of your username to the comments - are almost entirely not conducive to positive discussion.

Using your Cowen example, I would say something along the lines of ""I don't think Cowen is a very good player, and here's why [insert evidence, such as plays/photos/stats]"". That provides an opportunity for others to chime in and confirm or rebut my argument, which opens discussion through insightfulness or humour. The way you carry yourself here leads me to believe your equivalent would be ""Cowen sucks, fuck that mouth-breather!"" - or similar. No one really wants to talk to you when that's the entirety of your contribution, which makes me wonder why you bother to post it on Reddit in first place.  Being negative is no problem really. In fact, this is probably the best place to talk about those feelings for the team since you'll find others who either sympathize or can help convince you otherwise. But being needlessly blunt and an all-around jerk with your comments is not healthy, constructive, interesting, humorous, or fun (for anyone, yourself included, or so I'm choosing to believe).

OttawaSenators,3dnwk0,KrazyCooter,2,Sat Jul 18 03:10:54 2015 UTC,Pretty much any of the top-4 in Bingo would likely suffice as a Gryba replacement/upgrade.
OttawaSenators,3dnwk0,PaddleDown,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"None of the top 4 in Bingo are that tall or lumbering.  Sdao is about as ""Gryba"" as it gets and he is lucky to be a top 7 AHL D-man currently."
OttawaSenators,3dnwk0,KrazyCooter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:47:43 2015 UTC,"The NHL is moving away from tall and lumbering and toward skill and agility. We have enough tough, solid defencemen now in Methot and Boro, and a less offensive Ceci. We'd do well to not replace Gryba with another big, slow player but move toward adding some mobility on our back pairing with a player like Wideman."
OttawaSenators,3dnwk0,PaddleDown,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:24 2015 UTC,Wideman is the correct answer.
OttawaSenators,3dnwk0,PaddleDown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"I've been following FA signings pretty closely, so I knew... but he's a depth player and not really a significant signing at the NHL level, so I doubt you're the only one it's news to."

OttawaSenators,3dnwk0,Omega613,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect us to sign anyone to take a spot on the NHL roster (an expectation that seems pretty apparent given that so many FAs have already been signed) as the team is really taking a (smart) wait-and-see approach with pretty much the entire roster. Our defence wasn't perfect last year but it's incredibly young and has a lot of room to grow, and I think that's the organization's hope."
OttawaSenators,3dnwk0,KrazyCooter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:16:13 2015 UTC,I know but i can hope right?
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,TheKandyCinema,8,Fri Jul 17 08:46:38 2015 UTC,"Realistically? No, no one. We're near our budget limit and we have 23 players on the roster (incl. Wideman), meaning any player we bring in means one more has to go out.  And sure, that sounds fine, but good luck moving someone (expendable) out the door. Murray's been trying for months/years to trade Greening without success. Smith or Chiasson are moveable, but they're probably the best of the bunch of players we might want to move (and thus much lower priority). Neil and Phillips are tricky, but if you were going to move one or either of them, trade deadline is really the only viable time. Right now everyone has a healthy roster of players who are going to be given a chance to start the season on their respective team. Until the pre-season/season starts and players fail/get injured, the market has dried up for depth talent. If anyone was truly in need, then players like Santorelli, Stempniak, or Fehr likely wouldn't be unsigned.   That all said, if somehow we could move some bodies, there's still not a lot on that list which entices me. I know some people like Ehrhoff, and a couple years ago I would agree. But he's now 33 and dealing with injuries/concussion problems on top of the natural age decline. I want nothing to do with that, especially if the deal is any longer than 1 year. It wouldn't shock me if one of Wideman, Claesson, or Wikstrand could step in and perform not dissimilarity to current-day Ehrhoff, but with fewer injuries and a fraction of the price. No doubt they won't be good as him in his prime, but that's not what we're comparing them too.  Otherwise, if we dealt two of Smith, Chiasson, and Greening (for example) somehow for picks (ie. not roster players), I would be interested to take a gamble on a 1 or 2 year contract for ~$1.5M with Santorelli. He's basically Eric Condra, but has scored at an average 29 point pace throughout his career. That production should help to satiate Murray and/or those who are uninterested in the deeper metrics, as ~25-30 points is excellent for a 4th liner, and decent for a 3rd liner. Plus he plays C/RW (right hand shot), so he shouldn't in theory block Prince/Puempel.  Another former Leaf on that list which interests me is Franson. He's an above average dman, 2nd line quality, good stats and point totals, and he's about 27. At 6'5"", he won't get pushed around too much or too easily either (although he's not overly physical himself). He is a right hand shot, so he would likely either push Ceci down the lineup (which would probably help him develop more naturally), or make a helluva 3rd pair with someone like Boro. The big red flag for me is his potential asking price, both term and dollars. The fact that he's still unsigned, and past allegations with the Leafs, leads me to think he wants a big contract. I've heard a ballpark of $5Mx5y from some social media peoples - which may or may not be credible, but unsurprising either way. If he would sign for 2-3 years at $4.0-$4.5M, I would be very interested, depending again on who we could move out the door to make roster/financial space. I know we want to make room for various D prospects, but for most of them, their upside is becoming as good as Franson, with all the risk along the way. Why take the gamble if you don't need to? But again, there are so many if's and but's here that I don't honestly think it's ""realistic""."
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,Omega613,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"I would love Franson, he would be a great 2nd pairing and would make our 3rd pairing solid as hell. No idea how we get him and really, we throwing away all the rest of our young D then because barring some major development changes, I'm sure it'd be ek65/methort, weir/Franson, boro/Ceci for quite some time. What the hell do we do with claesson, Wideman, cowen, phillips, etc? Though if we could ship all them off I'd do it in a heartbeat for a Franson."

OttawaSenators,3dlt91,HollenFaust,2,Tue Jul 21 14:03:52 2015 UTC,I mainly agree but a guy like Ehrhoff or Volchenkov could improve the team.
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,BusinessCasualty,10,Fri Jul 17 12:50:41 2015 UTC,I have fond memories of Volchenkov... But we have no place for him with Methot playing that role ten times better.

OttawaSenators,3dlt91,SteveDougson,2,Fri Jul 17 14:22:14 2015 UTC,I think Volchenkov's role is more comparable to Anderson's or Hammond's
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,BradMarshTheAllstar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:21 2015 UTC,I love the A Train but Volchenkov is a shadow of the player he was.   He's got a lot of hard miles on his body and the Sens got the best years of his hockey career.
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,PaddleDown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:36:13 2015 UTC,"The only player I can think of as making some degree of sense may be Brad Boyes, but I have to think that there's a reason he isn't signed yet since he'd carry a pretty cap-friendly salary and can pot 35-40 points a season playing 2nd-3rd line minutes. That said, I'd still rather put out own prospects into that role and let them develop around the youth movement currently going on. I'm completely okay with the patience Murray and Co. are showing."
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,JumpedAShark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"Ehrhoff is the only one I would really consider, since I think he'd be a good steadying top-4 defenseman for a couple years. Unfortunately, he's likely to be too expensive and our budget (there's that word again) doesn't really allow for big free agent spending.   There's also a good chance he's looking for a long-term deal, and I'm not in the mood for that."
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,bfraser1994,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:42:42 2015 UTC,"If they could upgrade the D, that'd be swell, but we've got some pieces to do that internally. I REALLY want to see them add is Mike Santorelli. I think he'd be really nice with Pager and Curty, and it gives them another option for a center, who I'm pretty sure can play the wing if needed. Decent possession player, a little more offense than Erik Condra, and they could get him for pretty cheap. I think he'd be the perfect addition to the Sens."
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,benches48,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"Bring back Volchenkov! hahaha, just kidding. Realistically, we don't need anymore Free Agents, as much as I want Franson to wear the Red jersey"
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,mike-kt,0,Sun Jul 19 20:22:27 2015 UTC,"Priority for me would be improving defence. How fun would it be to have Franson and Erhoff as the 2nd pairing, with Wier and Ceci the 3rd. That would cost some cash though.   For the forwards, I'd love the Sens to grab Boyes, Tlusty and Goc if they could all be had for around $4m total on short deals. The Sens could move out Michalek, Neil and Smith for draft picks to make room. It would save them some cash and really improve the bottom 6.  Trading those three and Cowen frees up over $10m...  Maybe this could free up the cash for Franson? He's a great player and maybe his price has come down now that nothing's happened in a while?  Also I think Semin is a great player, it would be fun to have him in the bottom 6 against lower competition. What about Berginheim, Santorelli or Shepperd? So many options.    It's crazy to look at who's still available, there are a lot of good hockey players there who could play bottom 6 minutes for not a lot of money. This is why I think it's crazy to draft prospects with the dream of them playing in the bottom 6, there are tons of bottom 6 players available every summer, swing for the fences and grab skilled players."
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,hnryv,2,Fri Jul 17 14:19:59 2015 UTC,This year i want to see ceci and wier playing 20+ minutes a game. Those two need ice time  and i think they could be a great second pair in a year or two if they can get the ice time this season.
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,mike-kt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:33:13 2015 UTC,"I think Weir is great now, Ceci needs time and I think Weir is the only player available to shelter him.   I'm not sold on the idea that moving from 15 to 20 minutes a night is going bring much improvement in their game. I'm comfortable with them playing on the 2nd pairing, but wouldn't it be great to have two additional good defenders on the team? Hard to say no to."
OttawaSenators,3dlt91,hnryv,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:26 2015 UTC,I said it before i think our D is set. I'm not trying to tell you that it couldn't be made better by bringing in someone else but I am comfortable that given time these guys can me a top 5ish D core

Unless the Chris's retire and we can dump some bad contracts, we're likely going to be seeing some of these promising young players shipped out next season."
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,MichelangeBro,7,Wed Jul 15 13:37:39 2015 UTC,"My view is that you have to have those young guys fighting for spots with vets. Though I would agree right now there's more of a log jam than healthy competition in the bottom 6, young guys shouldn't just be able to walk onto the team. They should have to work and prove they belong there, above veterans whose skill set is known."
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,mike-kt,7,Wed Jul 15 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"I hope it's an honest system where the best players play. I don't see the Sens dumping vets to Bingo to make room if it's needed. It would be cool, but I don't see it happening."
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,kenata88,2,Wed Jul 15 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you, I was really happy when under Cameron things started to look like a meritocracy. They probably won't dump the Chrises to bingo, they'll take 2 of the 23 roster spots sitting in the press box if they're playing poorly. There's still room to manuever with the inevitability of injuries and other roster spots outside the starting lineup. But when you look at teams like Edmonton where guys that just got drafted are starting off the bat, bad things start to happen."
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,DigolasZooks,2,Wed Jul 15 14:34:52 2015 UTC,"If Lazar starts the season off taking a step back I can see the team sending him down to Bingo for a month or two to get some playing time like they did with Zibanijad a while back. Not that I think this happens but it would be good for his development to get first line minutes in the AHL for at least a few months, and it open up a bottom 6 roster spot. Also depending on how things go with Hoffman and Chiasson there may be 1 more move happening before the season kicks off."
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,umbraviscus,3,Wed Jul 15 14:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is an interesting thought. The kid's got a great attitude so the being sent down part hopefully won't hurt him too much, if it were to happen, and would open up a roster spot - but the question is for who. Personally I like him here on the 3rd/4th line, he looked much much more comfortable with the puck come the end of the year, and he's got a style of play that works real well with Pageau."
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,DigolasZooks,2,Wed Jul 15 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"True, I wouldn't want to see Lazar sent down because even though he's not going to be playing with Condra anymore, I think he, Pageau and possibly Prince or Puempel would form a really solid rookie line. If he struggles, however, then it would be the right choice"
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,umbraviscus,2,Wed Jul 15 15:19:35 2015 UTC,I doubt Prince will start the season in Ottawa. That'd be cool though. We'll have to see.

OttawaSenators,3ddodk,NoVJ,2,Sat Jul 18 00:21:42 2015 UTC,I'd expect him to be excited about it. He knows he's going to the NHL. But now he gets 1st line minutes. And then maybe when he makes the push for the NHL again he'll be more than ready. Not that he wasn't. I just mean he'll be more like Mike Fisher.

OttawaSenators,3ddodk,Jthedude17,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:17 2015 UTC,It was unfair in my opinion because Prince played really well in the first game against Carolina and then barely saw any ice time in the next against MTL(?) then got sent down. While Puempel who didn't play as well as Prince in his debut got an extended call up right after Prince got sent down and played until he got injured.
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,TweetPoster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to come around on the slow build of this team. I wanted them to make a bigger move this off season but I'll be happy that they at least didn't destroy the direction.           This signing is kind of refreshing that Ottawa will take a Detroit-model approach in really developing in the minors for years, and make guys earn an NHL spot. It may have frustrated Prince in the past, but if he does get an NHL spot he'll be a much more mature player, and a very very motivated player to leave the A.      Think of Pageau and all of his determination in 2 years of being cut, he's suddenly on a go-to any situation 3rd line that the coaches love."
OttawaSenators,3ddodk,skiwithpete,2,Wed Jul 15 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"What scares me is like a Stephane Da Costa/Derek Grant situation. Guys who can probably crack the lineup, but aren't able to due to too many players on the roster. Eventually they leave and we aren't able to see them succeed on the big Sens. Robinson, Puempel, Prince, Wideman, and maybe Claesson need too see at least 20 games each this year, in my opinion. Unfortionately, I don't feel that we'll be able to do that"

OttawaSenators,3ddodk,JumpedAShark,-4,Wed Jul 15 15:28:41 2015 UTC,2-way contract means he doesn't need to clear waivers and can be just assigned to Bingo.  I'm pretty sure ELC (Entry-Level Contracts) are also safe from waivers so Lazar doesn't need to clear either if he is sent down.  Anyone without a two-way contract has to clear so Mark Stone and Zibanejad who previously were on their ELCs didn't need to clear waivers last year but do this year because of their new one-way deals

OttawaSenators,3d9sxj,Clintown,2,Wed Jul 15 01:58:40 2015 UTC,"Roman historian (and Sens fan) here from the UK - can confirm the Roman's did wear full face shields in a way - sources tend to confirm that some were seen wearing them but extensive research suggests they were almost never worn in battle and would have most likely been used for ceremonial occassions, and even then only by particularly skilled Equites (horsemen) and higher ranking officers. For what it's worth, saying ""Romans never did/didn't do x"" is intensely problematic as the period in question spans 1000+ years and covers a vast amount of land geographically. We tend to think of 'Romans' as being based in Italy and fighting like gladiators, but their spread, and with it a variey of fighting/clothing/military styles, was extremely diverse. So, to complete my overly precise reply, some members of the Roman fighting forces did wear full face shields, the majority did not. However, in terms of the Sens it's worth remembering that only the very best of the best, the most skilled and decorated fighters got to wear them so... pretty good visualisation for a logo!"

OttawaSenators,3d9sxj,Jomowi,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Roman Senators were often also military generals as well,  so the armour is not uncommon (ex.  Julius Caesar was a senator when he conquered Gaul) . As to the lion,  I'm stumped,  Rome was founded by boys raised by a wolf."

IMHO, despite whatever flaws people may find in it, the ""grand-daddy"" will always be our identity. What have the 3d profiles tried to capture? The essence of the original logo. In an underwhelming way, ""many"" would agree.  The Heritage jerseys are obviously dynamite, but is the ""O"" really a strong enough image to hang an entire brand on?

OttawaSenators,3d9sxj,Omega613,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"if it makes you feel any better, dated sports paraphernalia is way cooler than contemporary. shows you've been following the team and whatnot"
OttawaSenators,3d9sxj,Omega613,0,Tue Jul 14 23:49:17 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I'm not totally sold on the 3D logo as being perfect or ideal, but it's a huge improvement on the 90's/early 2000's logo. That old logo is amateurish and silly. If not for nostalgia, I bet if they introduced that logo now for the first time, it would be mocked and laughed at in much the same way as the recent 25th anniversary.  Ideally, I think the concept of a sharp 2D logo has the potential of much more staying power than at least the current 3D logo, but the old iterations do not fit the bill."
OttawaSenators,3d9sxj,Omega613,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:59:36 2015 UTC,"Nice design, I like how a lot of existing elements are simplified and that's a great direction. I think it's important to do the same on your newly added face mask, the more you can simplify the better. There is something pleasing about focusing on the helmet (plus it's associated imagery) and completely doing away with the man inside.  Obviously you've done away with most outlines in favour of several ""floating"" blocks. From a minimalism standpoint, it's beautiful, but logistically a nightmare. For instance you had to make compromises to put it on a red back ground, and it doesn't look nearly as sharp on a white background as on black. Hanging that as a sign on the CTC or embedded in the ice, it would likely not jive too well.   If the colours themselves are dark/bold enough and if the ""floating blocks of colour"" are close enough (or touching), then you might be able to get away with an optional white/black outline instead. I've always had it in the back of my mind that a logo with similar design cues to the NFL's  New England Patriots would be great for the Sens. It's beautifully simple, but with the dual purpose imagery (American flag + a soldier) it can still be interesting. Overall really unique and all around excellent. Your logo already seems to trend that direction as-is, maybe you can use that as some inspiration?  I already kind of like the base red jersey you have. I'd like to imagine the Sens getting to a point where they have the two heritage jerseys as the Home/Away, and a red jersey as an alternate. So purely out of personal preference, I would love to see a red jersey pushed more, and thus a corresponding adaptable logo to match."
OttawaSenators,3d9sxj,njoy_,2,Tue Jul 14 18:43:13 2015 UTC,"I have some outlined/blocked in versions (mostly in a disc-like shape), but none that I'm super happy with. Then again, all of this is still early sketches. For example I wasn't happy with the finnicky lines in the mask, so I simplified it."
OttawaSenators,3d9sxj,Clintown,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"Nice, big improvement in that regard already. Have you tried making the lines on the face mask and helmet of uniform width? Likewise with the negative space separating the the helmet and head crest - try finding some mid-ground width that looks good for all of them. That consistency might tie things together a little bit tighter. It's sort of like drawing something with outlines - if some strokes are thick bold marker and other parts are thin pencil lines, the overall effect suffers.  And try a blocked in version which simply follows the shape of your centurion, rather than a disc. You could perhaps match the ""width"" of the outer outline with the width of your above lines, or from another spot such as the max width (of negative space) between the two cape strokes."

OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Butthisistheinternet,2,Tue Jul 14 18:51:11 2015 UTC,Tyler Johnson would probably be the closest..
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Starky_D,11,Wed Jul 15 07:46:25 2015 UTC,This has me so fucking nervous. We can't afford to be on poor terms with the Hoff.
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,bbmello,5,Tue Jul 14 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"Arbitration is pretty common. They will figure it out I'm sure. I think he knows it's just the business, and there are no hard feelings there."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Akoustyk,3,Tue Jul 14 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"This is kind of triggering my hesitation with all this new statistical analysis. The mass abundance of new measures for players allows you to illustrate any point you wish to get across.     Of course, Hoffman lead the team in goals while being benched and demoted to the 4th line on multiple occasions. Any of his stats per 60 minutes will grossly over inflate his value on the team.     Watching the league play and saying Hoffman belongs in the conversations with the Pacioretty/Stamkos/Perry/Nash of this league is crazy, those are stars in this league. (Well Pacioretty is just okay, Ryan's better ;))  Hoffman has an amazing shot, no question. He's also shown that he's very skilled on the rush when he starts in his own end and comes right through the neutral zone with speed.    He also can be caught flat footed in his own end, and will go a whole game without any of his patented rushes through the neutral zone. I hope Hoffman will become a guy that will compare to those names, but no where has he shown the season to season (or even game to game) consistency demonstrated by top of the league guys.      Glad he's RFA, glad he had a great rookie season as a 26 year old, but show us what you're going to bring to Ottawa for ages 26-30 and I'll gladly support you getting paid."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Tue Jul 14 20:20:01 2015 UTC,Advanced stats are like arseholes. Sometimes they're useful but most times they're shitty
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Fuckwildbros,10,Tue Jul 14 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Give him one year on the cheap.  If he can do it again, break the bank.  We've been burned so many times.  We need to know it wasn't a fluke."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Ubuhio,12,Tue Jul 14 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"We don't get to choose if it'll be on the cheap or not, that's the whole point of arbitration. We only get to choose the term. I'm not scared of being burned. He's no Greening or Gonchar. He has a great shot and is one of the fastest players in the league. If he falters next year, coaching will probably be the cause. They'll choose one year term so the cap hit doesn't matter as much."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,ClapBomb,3,Tue Jul 14 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"Colin Greening had 40 something points in 60 games in the AHL, came in and played 1st line minutes in Ottawa getting 20 goals. 6'3'' 210 pounds and one of the fastest skaters on the team (was in the NHL fastest skater comp as a rookie remember). He played amazing on the 3rd line when the pesky sens fucked up the habs. And he was paid 2.65mill  which was understandable at the time, but an overpayment now and that's the issue.      You can't say Hoffman isn't worth 4.5mill now, but will he still be worth that in 2 seasons? Or will it be an overpayment in Hoffman's future?  Without a time machine you'd like to have the professionals in Ottawa make a prediction with a larger sample size.     It's impossible to say Hoffman isn't the next Greening, any player can be overpaid and become the next Greening."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"That stats showed that Spezza was dragging Greening around by the scruff of his neck all year that year, and any knowledgeable fan knew that 2.65 mill was a poor investment.  Hoffman actually improved the play of everyone he played with even when he was stuck with complete scrubs on the 4th line.   Yes, you CAN say Hoffman is not the next Greening."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Chili_Palmer,2,Wed Jul 15 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"He's going to get a one year contract from arbitration. If he does well this year that's 2 successful seasons to base a contract on. If he sucks this year, he's not getting a huge deal. The team isn't committing to him long term right now so all this talk of busts is useless."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,ClapBomb,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"I'd agree, but stoner got paid why not the hoff?"
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Ubuhio,11,Tue Jul 14 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"Stone played in multiple areas of the ice and had a variety of skills and assets.  Hoff is a one trick pony.  He's a sniper.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great trick, but it was noticeably absent in the 2nd half.  Now you could argue that that was because he dropped down the depth chart.  This is a good argument.  However, if you're going to make this argument you need to note that Michalek took Hoff's spot AND Michaleks production picked up exactly where Hoffs left off.  Hoff, like Michalek and Heatley before him, is only as good as his linemates.  You need to be very careful to not overpay a player like that."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,kenata88,10,Tue Jul 14 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"There is so much more heart in Stones game, we all saw him play with 1 hand in the playoffs and still be a force. He led the league in take-aways, and is a great passer. He's effective even when he's not scoring, Hoffman on the other hand is not effective when he's not lighting it up, and that's putting it lightly"
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,MichelangeBro,2,Tue Jul 14 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"As I sit here in class at 6pm (got here at 8am) I know that I am too tired.

OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"see, I agree about Stone having those extra assets (mainly his mind for the game and his ability to steal pucks for a joke), but for you to comment on an article that specifically showed that Hoffman is not useless when not scoring, saying exactly that (""and that's putting it lightly"") is drivel, and I don't understand how some people can confidently spout nonsense like that without even reading articles where people have analysed the very same thing they shoot their mouth off about!"
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Akoustyk,7,Wed Jul 15 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"If you gave me a choice between hoffman and michalek, I would pick hoffman. He has tremendous speed and will learn a bit. Michalek is a good player, but he very rarely impresses me in any aspect against his peers. He also never disappoints with poor choices, which is good, but when hoffman plays, I watch him book up the ice, and see that his speed is definitely an asset.   There's no way I would let him walk. Arbitration, sure. I would try to pay as little for him as possible. That's the business. But I would never let him walk. Not at this point."

OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Ralph212,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"He's in good company on those charts, I don't think he deserves to be paid like some of them though."

Difference is, those guys are all paid between 6-9 million per season, and Hoff is looking for like, 4? 4.5 maybe?   How anyone can think that is such a bad deal for a guy who can compare to those guys even a little bit is beyond me."
OttawaSenators,3d9hy9,Chili_Palmer,3,Wed Jul 15 03:05:26 2015 UTC,For gods sakes just PAY THE MAN!!!

OttawaSenators,3d941d,Ubuhio,26,Tue Jul 14 13:43:32 2015 UTC,It's already Turris and Ryan since the Chris' are oft healthy scratches
OttawaSenators,3d941d,On_Letting_Go,12,Tue Jul 14 13:52:48 2015 UTC,I hope Turris and Ryan are alternates to start the season
OttawaSenators,3d941d,mike-kt,11,Tue Jul 14 14:49:37 2015 UTC,We know Bobby Ryan wants a leadership position on the team and Turris is just awesome so A's for the both of them!
OttawaSenators,3d941d,SINZAR,7,Tue Jul 14 13:52:55 2015 UTC,"Ryan may have had his struggles last season but he's a core piece of this team and his honesty and candidness with the media and fans helps make him an excellent case for a permanent ""A"". Realistically, a lot of the job of captains and alternates today is community relations, and Ryan excels in that department. I'd expect Turris to receive the other ""A"", although MacArthur is also a possibility."
OttawaSenators,3d941d,PaddleDown,4,Tue Jul 14 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping/expecting a bounce back year for Ryan. He'll have a good cold streak where people question his salary, but with good health I'm looking for the Ryan/Karlsson connection to be established.     Karl leads the rush and carries deep while Ryan gets himself open for that shot."
OttawaSenators,3d941d,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Tue Jul 14 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Ryan, definitely, should have an A. It really can't be overstated how great he is talking to the media. Even through his slump, he was super open with them, never made excuses for himself, and was able to poke fun at himself. That's hugely admirable, especially with how serious so many players take the game.  I've never thought about MacArthur, but that honestly makes a ton of sense. That shot in the Pittsburgh game where he pulled off his glove and starts coaching alongside Cameron shows just how much of a veteran, team player he is.   That being said, as much as I love MacArthur, I still think that we should give the second A to our One Turris God."
OttawaSenators,3d941d,MichelangeBro,4,Tue Jul 14 22:12:55 2015 UTC,I think Methot would be a good choice also.

OttawaSenators,3d941d,DawnaBard,3,Wed Jul 15 01:32:45 2015 UTC,"As others have said, Turris and Ryan almost certainly, and deservedly so. If they're ever injured, next in line should (hopefully) be MacArthur, Stone, and Methot - possibly in that order. All 3 have shown on-ice and (in our limited insight to it-) off-ice leadership capabilities.  Given his past experience and well-spoken+positive mannerisms, it actually wouldn't surprise me if Lazar is not far back on that list (and rising) as well. He's young, obviously, but young players in leaderships positions doesn't seem to be much of an abnormality in the NHL these days."
OttawaSenators,3d941d,Omega613,4,Tue Jul 14 18:57:34 2015 UTC,Turris because his backhand in NHL 15 is deadly.
OttawaSenators,3d941d,InCauda,3,Tue Jul 14 19:52:41 2015 UTC,"Obviously Turris, no one questions that. I love Bobby, but I think I'd rather it go to MacArthur. He just is such a leader and strikes me as an old guy who really can teach. In that comeback win against Pittsburgh in April, Clark can be seen standing on the bench beside Dave Cameron explaining what they're gonna do. I'm happy with Bobby having an A, but I think Clark really deserves one too."
OttawaSenators,3d941d,Jthedude17,3,Tue Jul 14 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"In order ... Ryan, Turris, Methot."

OttawaSenators,3d49dq,flatliner6,27,Mon Jul 13 12:02:29 2015 UTC,Just want to add... these two guys deserve a ton of respect. They spent their entire careers with the Senators and have played a major role in the success the team has had over the years. They will always remain faces of the franchise. Hopefully once they retire they will stay with the team in some kind of player development role.
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,nlansing,12,Mon Jul 13 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"I love Phillips and Neil to death, the fact is Phillips had off season back surgery and has 1 year left on his contract, it's basically guaranteed he retires next off season unless he doesn't get to play at all this year and calls it early. Very likely he stays on the team in a teaching role for many years down the road. Neil on the other hand still has some value on the ice, he grinds it out and can park himself in front of the net like no one else. The issue people have with Neil is Maclean was giving him too many prime minutes, he's more than serviceable in a 4th line role but giving him as many minutes as he was getting was hurting the team. That's my opinion though"
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,kenata88,3,Mon Jul 13 16:34:08 2015 UTC,"I wondered what the hate for Neil was when I started watching again this year. That explains it perfectly, thanks."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,EskimoNorth,11,Mon Jul 13 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"Glad you picked the Sens over the Habs. :)  No need to be sorry for asking a question. Neil and Phillips are basically Ottawa heroes and legends for their commitment to the organization but age slowed them down and most of us want them to retire or remain healthy scratches so our younger players get a chance! Or to have them shipped off to a cup contender team.  Welcome aboard and enjoy the ride, it'll be fun but frustrating."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,SeveredSurvival,22,Mon Jul 13 16:46:50 2015 UTC,Tl;dr summary  Sens fans want them off the active roster and the money to be used on other players. Great character players but not viable.  Best case would be for both to retire and help with player development.
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,njoy_,26,Mon Jul 13 12:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, I deeply want Neil to retire and work for the team.  Phillips should travel North America and bring back the best beer recipies and brewers. That's how he can give back. Please help me petition Big Rig to create a 'Fifth Saison: It's more than just hockey' beer."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,mike-kt,3,Mon Jul 13 15:08:01 2015 UTC,Some Sens fans.
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,BradMarshTheAllstar,8,Mon Jul 13 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"Neither are going to contribute much to a winning team.  Neil will be fine as an occasional 4th line guy who draws into the lineup against teams who still employ ""rats"": Brad Marchand, Matt Cooke, and the like. Sens fans love whining and moaning about his salary and spot on the roster, but the bottom line is if you are worried about an 8-minute a night 4th line specialist being the catalyst between winning and losing games, you're looking in the wrong spot. He'll play out the calendar year, and depending on how we look in February might be shopped at the trade deadline. It's his call, though - I doubt we trade him if he wants to stay.   As for Phillips, I'd be surprised if he suits up for more than 20 games this year with his bad back. He had surgery in the offseason, but he's at the point where he's a much likelier candidate for a spot on LTIR (Long-Term Injury Reserve, a sort of ""reserve spot"" for players whose injuries will kepp them out of the lineup for long stretches of the season) than he is for a spot on the roster. His back is wrecked, and there are a litany of other nagging things that have piled up on his ""health ledger"". He's at the tail end of a significantly good career, but it's definitely the end. Like Neil, he probably won't be a massive difference maker in games due to what I imagine will be a low number of minutes played, even if he does return.   Both guys are finishing up their contracts this year, and will almost assuredly retire at the end of the year. I could possibly see Neil trying to stay in the league with a different team next year because he loves the game, but it doesn't look like it'll be with the Senators."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,ultrafil,9,Mon Jul 13 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"This isn't going to be a popular opinion here, but I'm fine with these guys as occasional substitutes for another year.  I still think there's value to them as players as long as they're not overplayed.    One of the biggest problems for Phillips last year was that MacLean played him with Erik Karlsson, and he also played Neil in far too many crucial situations.  Cameron and injuries corrected that.  They looked terrible in those bigger roles but I think they can play a few solid minutes every second game or so and they do bring a lot of experience to a very young team.  Beyond this year, though, I suspect they'll get in to coaching."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,BottledBarf,2,Mon Jul 13 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"They absolutely can play a role in limited minutes, but there are two issues: they get paid way too much to play so little; and, those few minutes would be beneficial to a younger player's development."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,as_hagi,2,Mon Jul 13 15:00:59 2015 UTC,they get paid way too much to play so little   There's not really much to be done about that when they're on contract.
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,chars709,5,Mon Jul 13 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks both for the understanding and answers. Some people have not given me any time for questions being a new fan from England. That said, LOTS of people have been great and welcoming.  This was kind of the answer I expected but definitely wanted to get an answer from a fan who knows what they are talking about, haha. If the sens could replace them both with younger upgrades, they could go deep in the playoffs with a little luck?"
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,NotYourAssistant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:09:13 2015 UTC,"Probably not this season - it was a fun ride at the end of the season into the playoffs last season, but there is no denying this team is rebuilding and making the playoffs is really not the goal this season."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,warrendunlop,6,Mon Jul 13 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure I totally agree. I haven't heard management use that term for at least a couple years. I think Murray and others feel this is a competing team.  There are a couple of needs — another top 6 forward, another solid D-man — but they are shaping up nicely and could make a good go of it."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,mike-kt,2,Mon Jul 13 14:31:46 2015 UTC,Sens had 7 forwards in the top 180 in points/60 last year. Why would they need another top 6 forward?
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,NotYourAssistant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"Last season's playoff berth was a complete fluke - fun to watch, but they were in the McDavid lottery before they went on the run. Not much has changed over last season - Cameron is a great coach, but it's not like they're going to run a full season of Hamburgler craziness. They could make the playoffs - any team can, but they're still a year or two away from completing the rebuild."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,Ynnad00,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:24:02 2015 UTC,Of course they won't go on a late season surge. They won't a tanking team in the midseason either.
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,BradMarshTheAllstar,2,Wed Jul 15 22:24:52 2015 UTC,"making the playoffs is really not the goal this season.   I dunno, if they don't dig themselves a hole early like last year they're a realistic playoff bubble team imho."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,Funkativity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:23:08 2015 UTC,What is their goal this season then? Is it just getting experience and making the team gel? Are they just starting/in the middle or nearly finish rebuilding? Thanks :)
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,mike-kt,2,Mon Jul 13 13:20:47 2015 UTC,i'd say we're in the middle of the rebuild..last step is shedding these bad contracts/older players.  we'd probably be looking at another run of 1-2 series in the playoffs... but there's been in arms race in the east during the last month of trading and free agency.. so we've become a bit worse in comparison and are still a dark horse to make the playoffs next year sadly
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,Akoustyk,3,Mon Jul 13 13:56:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply :) Nice to know what to expect as they move forward. When they shed these bad contracts and with a year or two experience, and a few nice additions during those few years, maybe the dark horse can get its hooves on the cup ;)"
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,infinitygoof,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:02:28 2015 UTC,"I think they will challenge for a playoff spot, but so much of hockey depends on the goalies, and goalie performance is hard to predict."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,Lampadaire_Lorignale,0,Mon Jul 13 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"Neil is a great 4th liner. Philips is a sound defenseman, but always has been slow, and always has been a defensive defenseman, scoring very few goals. And he is getting slower now.   Neil is good at what he does. Has always been a physical player that would grind on other teams like kind of a pest, and fight if he has to to get the team and fans pumped up, knows to go to the net, and has some good hockey sense. But he has always been a grinder, never a goal scorer or really offensive play making typed player.   But I always thoguht he was one of the best in the league at the sort of role he plays.   If you replace him, we won't be a contender, he's just sort of a low level guy. The small pieces matter, but he is a strong version of those small pieces.   Sens are not ready to really push far this year. I would expect them to make the playoffs, but not go too deep, but anything can happen in the playoffs also.   Anderson in nets needs to learn to stay in nets, and not make high risk poke checks. All the sens recently learned to make smart plays, rather than high risk ones, but Andy has not learned that yet imo.   A lot of our players are very young. They learned a lot last year. They have little playoff experience. I'd say give it a couple years, and the sens could be a very strong team. They have some good young talent right now. I think they have a good coach, and their spirit, and mental toughness seems to be where it should be now. At the beginning of the year last year, they didn't play so well, luckily for them they still won a lot of games, but they played poorly the whole first half of the season. So, this year, they should fare a lot better, and I think will make the playoffs for sure barring injuries or something like that."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,matty323,2,Tue Jul 14 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"No need to be sorry! Thanks for choosing the best (and most frustrating team). Phillips and Neil are not playing well. Both are basically replacement level players at this point.   Phillips still has good hockey sense and reads the play fairly well but his speed has left him completely and he really can't keep up.   Neil is a fourth liner at best now. He can fight and get in front of the net a bit but has very little else to offer the team right now.   Both of them are probably great leaders in locker room and command a great amount of respect from the younger guys. Neil, for example has been known to rough up guys in practice who get a bit to big for their britches and seems to get props for it from both the teams and the fans. But the reality is both spots on the roster would be better taken up by guys coming up to get some experience or by signing some younger ""veterans"" with more upside."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,InTURRISting,2,Mon Jul 13 12:30:35 2015 UTC,"They are both below replacement level players. Phillips is probably the best D-man in the league at pointing at the 2nd man while defending 2 on 1's (though a better skill would be ACTUALLY defending the 2 on 1). Neil is seen as a good locker room guy but the number of times he has fought teammates in practice makes me think that is maybe not entirely accurate. They were both pissed when Karlsson got the 'C' and now their presence just kinda hangs over the team. Ideally, they'd both be shamed into retirement so they can continue to provide the people of Ottawa with tasty beverages at their respective bars/brewpubs. I appreciate what they have brought to the team over the years, but they can't provide even decent NHL minutes anymore."
OttawaSenators,3d49dq,peskysens,3,Mon Jul 13 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"Conacher, Spezza, Cowen, Emery, Arvedson, Havlat, Who else has neil punched on this team?"
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,Dk_krypton,8,Mon Jul 13 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"His advanced stats are actually pretty favourable when it comes to Corsi (http://imgur.com/mxosdZ2). So with that being said, I think it's fair to say he's certainly a better player than what we saw this past season. Some bad puck luck definitely didn't help (lowest PDO on the team last year with 961). Obviously the biggest issue with him is his contract, $2.65 for a fourth liner on a budget team just doesn't work. If his contract was closer to $1.00-$1.25, I don't think  fans would have as big a problem with him. He's still a capable NHL player."
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,sensforlife11,5,Mon Jul 13 03:41:41 2015 UTC,"This is a solid summation. Although as a strike against his possession metrics, our good friend @InnefectiveMath produced this chart (the middle one, primarily). He started strong, and faded bug time throughout the season. His numbers from this season are also probably inflated due to small sample size.  On the opposite side of things, our team last season (under Cameron) was trending more and more towards one built around speed - both in deployed player talents and how it's used thanks to the coaching systems. Colin Greening, for all his faults, is (/was?) actually one of the faster skaters in the league. So perhaps with a full dev camp, coaching from Cameron, and potentially some better linemates than Smith/Neil/Legwand, Greening could be a decent player in our bottom-6. Overpaid, but maybe decent.  I'd still part ways with him if given a good opportunity, but if he's staying then I'm not offended by giving him a proper chance on the team early in the season rather than waiving him immediately after training camp to play in the AHL again."
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,Omega613,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"I think Greening could be carried if we had a better 4th line. More important could be his mindeset and how he plays with the puck. I'm of the opinion that he dumps the puck in a lot or passes it away, yet I think he's effective at carrying the puck. I don't have any numbers to support this though, zone entry data isn't very complete.   MannyElk cancelled his blue line events tracking project for this year, but he did write this somewhat-related article a couple years ago for 6thSens http://the6thsens.com/2014-articles/on-the-energy-line-and-understanding-player-usage.html  Looks like GSN was pretty bad at entering the zone; perhaps a prince-Lazar-Greening line could encourage Greening to carry the puck more, and playing with skilled linemates will help.  Obviously I'd like Neil to retire and Smith to be benched or traded, we'll see what happens."
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,mike-kt,2,Mon Jul 13 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"Forgive me, but I dont get the hate on Smith... and pls, dont throw advanced stats at me... the guy plays, hard."
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"There are thousands of professional hockey players in the world who can play hard but don't have the skills for the NHL, playing hard isn't the be all and end all.   I don't think Smith is a terrible player, I think the Sens have sufficient depth that they can afford to have Smith as a 13th forward. I'd rather have Smith play than Neil or Greening, but we're having a conversation about how Greening can fit in the lineup.   Stats just explain the results that players have, what's the problem in looking at their results?"
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,mike-kt,3,Mon Jul 13 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"I did read somewhere that he was going to ""make it hard for Cameron, not to play him"".    that's what Murray said he expected from him when asked whether he'd be bought out or traded.  the main problem with Greening (besides his contract) is that his ceiling is now lower than the current skill level of many of our prospects.  he could be a serviceable 4th liner on another team.. unfortunately his contract makes that very unlikely."
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,Funkativity,2,Mon Jul 13 14:20:05 2015 UTC,he does try...
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,wokshappenin,-3,Mon Jul 13 03:23:15 2015 UTC,"My honest biggest fear is Greening has a killer season. And somehow Ottawa is delusional enough to sign him again to a similar contract.  That being said, if he can put together a good season, and play well for Ottawa I am not against giving him a 1 year cheap contract to stick around."
OttawaSenators,3d31tm,peskysens,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"He still has 2 years left, don't even worry about it."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,sensforlife11,5,Sun Jul 12 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"All this crap about Condra leaving and how bad a decision it was not to match the offer yada yada, is nonsense. He was marginal at best and the 4th line should be the least of our worries. And Mike Green as insurance for Karlsson? Are you mad?   This team needs to develop talent, stop signing players in the twilight and cut bait with Phillips. If we could add a 2 way centre capable of playing Turris minutes that would be great. It would be greater if Zibby turned out to be that guy. BMGM is staying the course and that is the best decision he could have made."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mackinder,2,Sun Jul 12 15:22:00 2015 UTC,"Did you not watch the playoff run? The Pageau-Condra-Lazar line was one of our best, (and it was our third line, not fourth) and Condra was a huge part of that. Our team was significantly better with him on the team (especially on the PK) and this idea that he was ""marginal at best"" is total revisionist BS. We were singing his praises during the season, and now people wanna dismiss him because Murray doesn't see his value."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,JumpedAShark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"Condra's been great for years. Not signing him for peanuts was a mistake. It's Phillips, Neil, Greening, Cowen, Smith and Michalek who are taking roster spots from equal or better prospects.   Clear out Phillips, Neil, Greening and Cowen from the lineup and the Sens can go out and get any UFA or trade from teams in a cap crunch. Instead we lose of the most useful forwards on the team in Condra. I'm not sad about losing Condra as much as I'm frustrated with the decisions and direction of this team's managment.  Losing Condra is the 25th Anniversary patched announced by the Spartan of bad decisions."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mike-kt,0,Mon Jul 13 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly he was a healthy scratch in the first half of the season. He played good in the playoffs and near the end of season but it wasn't enough to get us past the Habs because he plays in the bottom six. He top six is where we need help, not the bottom. This team has lots of good players who can play that role. We lack consistency in offence from the top 6. Maybe you only started watching when the team went on the end of season run."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mackinder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly he was a healthy scratch in the first half of the season.   That was because Paul Maclean was making a lot of poor personnel choices. Stone, Hoffman and Wiercioch were scratches too at various times. That wasn't an indictment of Condra's abilities, and was one of the main reasons why Maclean was fired.   He top six is where we need help, not the bottom.   The bottom-6 doesn't need help (or should I say, didn't) partly because he was in it. Now it's just Pageau, Lazar, and a bunch of other guys.   Maybe you only started watching when the team went on the end of season run.   Seriously?"
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,JumpedAShark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:48:03 2015 UTC,Turris is a 2 way centre capable of playing Turris minutes
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mike-kt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"Right. We need another 2 way centre who can play in the top 6.  Did you think I was unaware that Kyle Turris played for the Sens, that he played Kyle Turris minutes or that he was a 2 way centre?  We're not gonna get a #1 centre through free agency so we either draft one or trade for one. I'm pretty sure BMGM has high hopes they Zibby can be that guy."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mackinder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sold we need another centre more than we need another good Defenceman to play with Weir. I wouldn't put the priority at Centre. If Zibby plays with Hoffman and Ryan, I don't see a problem."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mike-kt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"My guess is Hoffman is on the block. He won't get first line minutes until he plays a two-way game. Zibby played well at centre but needs to take a big step forward if he is going to be a first line centre. I like his game and some nights he is really hard to play against, but other nights he isn't and consistency is what he needs.   Bobby Ryan needs a playmaker to centre his line. Not sure they have anyone creative  enough to play with him, at least no one that's the calibre needed to play 82 games over 20 minutes a night. I think that BMGM forecasts an all out competition to fill the 4th line with hungry young players looking to play balls out nightly. They likely will swap a lot of players in and out of the lineup until they get a combination that works. And if it stops working, they will change it quick. I'm basing this on the amount of 2way deals I see. Expect Neil and Smith to be a scratch about half the time. The other lines are looking like...  Michalek - Zibanejad - Ryan MacArthur - Turris - Stone Hoffman - Lazar - Pageau  I think Chiasson is on a short leash as well. Michalek has proven that he isn't durable enough to be play 82 so there will likely be a lot of juggling again. If the sens can move him and Phillips they will.  I wonder how many games Nick Paul will get with the big club. He looks like the kind of player that could play in the top 6 in the relatively near future. The future again looks bright but I still think that this team is 2-3 years from being a legitimate Cup contender."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mackinder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"How can we know that Hoffman can't play a two-way game? I think he should be a lock to play on the 2nd line.   As for Zibby, how do we know he's not consistent and if he is (or will become consistent), how long will it take for him to prove it? How many games or seasons will he have to be consistent for?   Ryan had a bad shooting percentage at the end of the season and in the playoffs - If he shots went in at the same rate they usually do, are you asking the same questions about him? Why put Michalek with zibby and ryan instead of Hoffman? Hoffman was great with them last year and they were better too.   How will the Sens be better in 2-3 years? Ryan, MacArthur, Andy and Michalek will all be that much older and further from their peak. 2 or 3 of the prospects really have to work out well to keep feeding cheap talent. It's doable but not a given. I think their chances are as good now as they'll be in a few years."
OttawaSenators,3cz48s,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:28:59 2015 UTC,"Article is filled with hypocrisy. You defend Condra and his lack of production, then you go on to say Greening must return to scoring 20 goals for him to be worth his contract, you then say it doesn't matter that Condra was blocking prospects, then at the end of the article you say as a budget team the Sens need to gamble on their prospects and make room for them.   And of course they're low balling Hoffman. Any team would."

OttawaSenators,3cz48s,JumpedAShark,2,Mon Jul 13 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"My point about gambling on prospects is for the top six, where you should take a chance on a player on an ELC being able to fit in instead of Michalek at $4 million. Team wasn't even willing to gamble on Zibanejad being ready to take on the 2C and that's how we ended up with a $3 million Legwand.  I'll leave this chart here for Condra: https://twitter.com/MimicoHero/status/616303816095477760  In the grand scheme of things, losing Condra isn't the biggest deal, but combined with some of the other decisions the organization has made and they all add up."

One stop was Ypres, and there they have the Menin Gate, meant to commemorate the First World War.   Since sometime around the 1920s, they have held a ceremony there every single day. Every. Single. Day. Excluding the Nazi occupation, of course. I guess the school contacted the organizers and got us a spot, so I volunteered to go. There were some Scots and Kiwis there as well with us doing the ceremony for their schools, you just walk up and lay a wreath.  Very touching experience though, and my teacher liked the idea of wearing the Canadian capital's sports team. Good representation of Canada. I mainly wanted to do it though to spite the Maple Leafs fan that was my history teacher though haha"

OttawaSenators,3crew3,detroyer,6,Fri Jul 10 05:05:00 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, but this game was the lowest of lows, and the highest of highs. Even if it wasn't the only thing that everyone was talking about, we all knew the situation: even if we won, we still had our work cut out for us; but lose, and it was all but over.  Knowing that and watching Crosby score in the first ten seconds was one of the biggest gut-punches I've ever felt in my sports fandom. And it only got worse, as we went into the first intermission down 3-0. It was such a devastating turn of events after the previous month of feeling like there wasn't a team in the league we couldn't beat.  And I can remember, someone in the Game Day Thread threw out a statistic which said something along the lines of ""The Senators are the only team to overcome a 3-0 deficit this season, and they've done it three times"" or something like that. Suddenly, it felt possible.  But then, in his trademark style, JG Pageau puts us on the board with a shorty. There's no way it's happening, right?  And then Stone scores. 3-2.  Final two minutes of the game. We need to score to tie. The net is empty. My stomach feels seconds from evacuation. Faceoff in their zone. It's back to Hoffman. And with his wicked-slick snapshot, it's in the back of the net. Tied up with just over a minute left.  Go into overtime on the Powerplay after a Pittsburgh too-many-men penalty in the last 30 seconds of regulation, but they're unable to capitalize.  Crosby's racing for the stretch pass, but it's broken up by Karlsson and Methot. Turris ends up with it. Karlsson jumps into the rush, takes the Turris pass. He centers it to none other than Mark Stone.  He controls it, he fires it, he scores. After going down 3-0 in the first period, the hottest rookie in the league wins us the game.  Fuck, every time I hear Chris Cuthbert's ""Karlsson across. Stone! SCOOORES!"" I get choked up.  This fucking game, man."
OttawaSenators,3crew3,MichelangeBro,5,Fri Jul 10 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"We almost did the exact same thing in Game 6 v. Montreal. The pressure we had in the last 2 minutes was immense, but I'm still pissed at the refs that they prematurely blew the whistle."

One of them lined it up and gave it a boot, drop-kick style. In a true test of his accuracy and distance, the Cup landed on target, in the canal. That established, the boys went on their merry way, and the Cup stayed in the Canal until the next day when sober heads prevailed and Lord Stanley's mug was rescued.

Stanley sent the following message to the victory celebration held on March 18, 1892, at Ottawa's Russell Hotel for the three-time champion Ottawa Hockey Club:   I have for some time been thinking that it would be a good thing if there were a challenge cup which should be held from year to year by the champion hockey team in the Dominion [of Canada].  There does not appear to be any such outward sign of a championship at present, and considering the general interest which matches now elicit, and the importance of having the game played fairly and under rules generally recognized, I am willing to give a cup which shall be held from year to year by the winning team.  I am not quite certain that the present regulations governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, and it would be worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from."

And in case anyone didn't know, SilverSevenSens is holding a small competition for fanmade logo submissions, so if you have some concepts then send 'em on over. I'm sure a few high caliber logos like this one will be spotlighted in a couple weeks. I think we all agree that the ""real"" logo is atrocious, and there's no way the Sens don't already know the public consensus. So I recommend keeping a close eye on the competition and tweeting/emailing/etc. your favourite(s) repeatedly at the Sens in hopes that they swallow their pride and either try again or use a fanmade submission ;)"
OttawaSenators,3cm7x3,Omega613,2,Thu Jul 9 15:58:15 2015 UTC,i'm going to assume 95% of the fanmade logos would be unusable due to some restrictions the sens had.   for example this logo would look like shit on the ice from more than 10' away due to the use of white lines and very light beige.

My hope is that amongst the finalists on Silver Seven (or elsewhere through social media), regardless of the voted 'winner', there's a small chance that the Sens will see one or two that would translate well to all intended uses for the logo (marketing material, jersey patch, ice logo, etc.). It's doubtful they go back on the current design due to reasons of pride/logistics/legality/etc., but we can only hope and try. If they do like one of the proposed designs, I'm sure they can work with the creator to tweak it where/if needed."

Turris really showed his hands this year in ways I hadn't really seen him before, and this was his best for sure. To have this be the winning OT goal really makes this goal even better.  2- Bobby Ryan insanity  One of the best goal's I have seen while watching a game. Ryan made me remember why we traded for him and signed him after this goal. Couldn't believe my eyes. Too bad we still lost that game.  3- Hamburglury  I love both this and the Hamburgled saves, but to have this be against Kessel and the leafs just makes this so perfect.  PS.

Stone's steal and dish to MacArthur.  I distinctly remember jumping up from my couch and screaming in joy at that steal.  The goal nearly killed me."
OttawaSenators,3clzb4,InTURRISting,2,Thu Jul 9 11:40:40 2015 UTC,"While I don't think it's the best play of the year, Hammy's save on Staal needs an honourable mention just for the look on Staal's face.  Also, watching this made me miss Senators hockey so much. I love this team.  edit: That Stone OT winner against Pittsburgh makes me tear up. What a fucking game that was."

OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Jukkster,40,Tue Jul 7 12:33:46 2015 UTC,"Last Edit: Since this comment is at the top, I'll use the opportunity to inform people about SilverSevenSens' competition for fan made logos. If you have any ideas or are thinking about finding a favourite to repeatedly tweet/etc. at the Sens, then check it out (especially after the 19th when they post the submissions!).  I had a go. Still could use some tweaks, it's a bit rushed in the sense that I haven't spent time making finer edits, but I think it shows my idea well enough. Picture it more as a detailed draft more than a finished product. Better? Thoughts? In case anyone was curious, it's directly influenced by this fanmade design for the 20th anniversary (which went unused, to my knowledge). I'm not as happy with my design as I am with the one I'm referencing, but wanted to make sure I took it in a very different direction.  Edit: Made an alternate with slightly more pronounced depth effect and softer shading.. Not my finest work, but it's all that has sprung to mind for me so far.  Edit2: If they're reeeaaally keen on incorporating the metal look/textures/gradients in a literal way, then here's another version which attempts to do so (in a more tasteful manner?).  Edit3: Redone it from scratch with a more distinct style/direction in mind, rather than a cobbled together concept sketch. Still making tweaks, but I'm keeping it under wraps for the upcoming SilverSeven competition ;)"
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,7,Tue Jul 7 19:44:10 2015 UTC,Much bigger fan. I'd say the team logo needs a little more prominence but more subtle than the Wrestlemania logo.
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,6,Tue Jul 7 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for better or worse, I definitely prioritized by own wordmark logo over the 'real' one, but my reasoning is twofold: Firstly, there's so much debate over which of the team's main logos are ""best"" (the O, the 3D centurion, or either of the two 2D centurions) that minimizing their focus seemed a good neutral course to take. Secondly, I'm imagining this more in the context of the jersey patch than the marketing/poster format, and for that situation I'm more inclined to mostly do away with a miniaturized version of what already sits on the jersey's front side to avoid the visual redundancy.  I did want it slightly larger (~150%?) but it made it was tough to make it play nicely with the ""XXV"". I haven't yet tried aking it overlap/cut out part of the central X, but that's part of the ""tweaks"" I would play with given more time. I might have a go a little later with that and a few other things though."
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Ubuhio,3,Tue Jul 7 20:36:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's a lot of differing opinions but use one would probably be best (which admittedly you did).
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,2,Tue Jul 7 21:07:12 2015 UTC,Wait... that wordmark at the top of the sub isn't an official asset?  You designed that?
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Valentine96,3,Tue Jul 7 22:56:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, was messing around with some stuff to give our lovely mods a few more custom assets to play with to spruce up this subreddit. Wasn't a big fan of our team's primary existing wordmark, and wanted something a bit more... ""heritage"" inspired rather than modern looking. Same idea behind the ""wood"" background with the 'O' (although the ""O"" itself was just traced from existing assets, of course)."
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,6,Tue Jul 7 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"Can you upload your psd file?  I kinda wanna fiddle with your thing.  No biggie if it's a pain the the lower body.    Upon my proofread of this comment, I wish to change nothing."
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Valentine96,7,Wed Jul 8 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"I kinda wanna fiddle with your thing.   ಠ_ಠ  Very forward of you!  But on topic... I don't use photoshop, I use GIMP, so my files are .xcf format. No idea how nicely those play with Photoshop. But I've also done a rush job with my layer naming/organization so it's not exactly in a... ""user firendly"" state :P"
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,3,Wed Jul 8 00:36:14 2015 UTC,My PSD files usually just include the following:  Layer 1  Layer 1 1  Layer 1 1 (copy)  and so on.
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,mcchubby,3,Wed Jul 8 02:55:31 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah! Mine usually start off nice and organized with a few folders to categorize everything. It's all lovely for the first ~20-25 layers, but then the ""duplicate layer"" tool gets used too often, things get moved, deleted, changed, made invisible, etc.. After a short time it's just chaotic and unless I'm doing work for someone or if I know I will be revisiting this some time from now, then I seldom bother to go back and fix it all."
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,6,Wed Jul 8 03:02:54 2015 UTC,"This is solid. Hit up the Sens, way better than current"
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,mcchubby,3,Tue Jul 7 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"Kind of you to say, but I seldom feel comfortable approaching people for personal gain in such a public manner. I tend to leave that to others - if they feel strongly enough about something I've done that it's worth bringing to someone else's attention through some social/private platform, then it seems validated. If not, then chances are it isn't good enough to warrant anyone's time in the first place. If I had a more private channel for communication like an email address, then I might consider it, but that's rarely made available and (depending on who I'm speaking with) it might come across as rude to essentially say ""hey, that logo you did sucked, but here's one that might be more palatable with the public"" (or equivalent)."
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,2,Tue Jul 7 22:50:40 2015 UTC,"So basically, I'm going to tweet this at the Sens, and say hey, your logo sucks.  This is better."
OttawaSenators,3cf3my,mcchubby,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:51:00 2015 UTC,"Ha, you're more than welcome to, though I suggest waiting a short while. The Sens should know pretty clearly that their design has not been well received, now it's just a matter of pressuring them to see if they concede and try again (doubtful, but certainly possible!). But silversevensens.com is hosting a small 'competition' of sorts to find a better fanmade equivalent. Might I recommend holding off on twitter/etc.-ing them until that wraps up in a couple weeks? That way you'll have a better look at some likely solid designs, all of which would have a better chance of impressing the Sens' media staff that the draft(s) I posted above. I even have a much more refined version nearly finished that I'm keeping hidden for/until the competition, so if it's among the finalists you'll see it on silverseven soon ;)"

OttawaSenators,3cf3my,Omega613,2,Wed Jul 8 13:45:43 2015 UTC,We should use this one instead of the official one for the 17/18 season.

OttawaSenators,3cf3my,broomlad,10,Tue Jul 7 15:24:35 2015 UTC,Actually it IS better (at least in my opinion) but that's because the design choice works better with the flat logo vs the 3D logo.

He was a physical force who played well positionally and didn't make too many mistakes.  After the Lars Eller hit (completely clean IMO) he has never been the same player. He even admitted as much in an interview after the trade was announced. He seems to be over-thinking playing physically, which is his biggest asset.  If he's not being aggressive, he's not a terrible player, but really just doesn't bring much else to the table. He isn't super fast, doesn't make an amazing first pass, isn't great at defending with his stick. I'm not saying he's bad at any of these things per se, they're just not strengths.  For your sake I hope he plays with a little less hesitation and he could be a very useful player IMO, especially in the Western Conference."
OttawaSenators,3cc6qc,devin27,2,Mon Jul 6 20:06:33 2015 UTC,"Bad luck for Eller and I'm happy he recovered, but that was a clean hit. Habs fans call the police whenever their players get injured, so Player Safety suspended Gryba based on the blood."

I distinclty remember the game against the Oilers, the night before we made the trade for Hemsky, where he took a really stupid retaliation penalty that cost us the game. If he's insulated as the #5 guy I think he will do alright."
OttawaSenators,3cc6qc,Grizwald,4,Mon Jul 6 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"Hemsky also cost us that game with 2 goals I think... I wonder if we had have traded for him a few days earlier, if that season would have been different. :("

OttawaSenators,3cc6qc,Grizwald,3,Tue Jul 7 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"He is a serviceable NHL defenseman but seems lacking in certain areas. He is big but fails to use his body well, especially because he isn't the strongest skater. Since he can't separate guys from the puck cleanly, either with his stick or his body, he isn't a great modern NHL defender. He isn't the worst at moving the puck, but again not up to the standards of a good NHL defenseman.  Basically there is a disturbingly high correlation between his presence on the ice and Ottawa spending lots of EV time in their defensive zone. He seems like a good teammate but I'm not sad to see him go, especially if it leaves a spot for Wideman."
OttawaSenators,3cc6qc,InnocentGun,2,Mon Jul 6 23:07:43 2015 UTC,"Something that hasn't been mentioned here is his ability to clear the front of the net.

Used to be more aggressive before he killed Lars Eller and felt bad about it.  Does his job, some times makes mistakes. Fills a role and has a cheap cap hit. Ottawa wasn't trading him just for the sake of getting rid of him, they have a defender who won the AHL defenseman of the year last season who they needed to make room for. But don't expect Shea Weber or anything. There's a reason he went for only a 3rd. Serviceable guy who is cheaper than the equivalent UFA would cost. (assuming there was actually a UFA like him out there this season.)"

However, ever since he absolutely murdered Eller with that clean hit (suicide pass btw), he wasn't the same.  Honestly? Enjoy him. He's a great guy. Unlike Cowen, he doesn't take pointless and bad penalties (seriously, they should have traded Cowen instead). Good luck with McJesus by the way. Maybe the Oilers will crack the play-offs this year."

Thats why I am opposed to trading Hoffman and just keep him instead of making a bad trade and see where he goes. Just a short term contract 1-2 years and if he has proven him self with consistent 25+ goal seasons by the end of that contract and he still wants out, I would be happy with trading him as his value would've increased tremendously."
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,SkullCrusherXP,16,Mon Jul 6 16:54:51 2015 UTC,"I get this feeling Hoffman isn't too happy with the organization. He doesn't seem to enjoy his time here as much as other players. On top of that, the coaching seem to be fixated on his defensive flaws and give him 0 PP time. GMBM himself seems not to be too high on him.   I think those are all exaggerations"
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,Funkativity,10,Mon Jul 6 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, there is literally no reason to indicate he isn't happy with the organization. Loads of players go to arbitration and it has nothing to do with how happy they are."
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,CaptainKarlsson,6,Mon Jul 6 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY!   This sub has been completely ridiculous about the Hoffman arbitration thing since he filed.   TONS of good players file and then see success with the same team, it's just a safe play for a player to make when he and the team aren't seeing eye to eye on negotiations.   Zuccarello, Brassard, PK Subban all filed for arbitration last season - I doubt any of those teams now wish they had traded those players.   What's happening here is simple - Murray is trying to give Hoffman a multi year deal that he hopes will look like a bargain, similar to the Turris/Karlsson deals, or else give him a modest amount for one season.   Hoffman wants to earn it, so I'm guessing he is looking for a one year deal in the 4 million range to prove he is worth a long term contract at good money. Arbitration will almost definitely give him that, so he has nothing to lose by filing, except apparently the faith of thousands of overreacting sens fans."
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"The only knock on arbitration that even GMBM has said is that sometimes things are said that may hurt feelings. As long as everyone involved is professional and nothing is brought to the rink in 3 months (and there's no indication it will) then there really isn't a problem at all.    It's a regular part of the NHL contract process and its getting more and more popular.    Lastly, anyone else notice how Hoffman must hate Ottawa and doesn't want to be here because of arbitration, but Chiasson has none of this same negative speculation?"
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"I suspect it's just because people still share the same view that Murray seems to share, which is that Hoffman still hasn't proved anything.   they view him as both a) disposable, and b) somehow valuable enough to net some kind of huge return.   He can't be both, guys. If he's not worth 4.5 million a year, he's not worth a top 4 defenseman."
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:11:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. Yes his role was limited in the playoffs but I don't understand how that correlates with him being unhappy. More or less just a rookie guy being insulated in his first playoff series.
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,Grizwald,6,Mon Jul 6 21:27:53 2015 UTC,Guy who was drafted over age in round 5 and given the opportunity to develop should have no reason to not like it in Ottawa.
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,canuck_11,7,Mon Jul 6 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"Fair warning, I'm about to go on a bit of a rant...   I get this feeling Hoffman isn't too happy with the organization.   What's that based on? Honestly. He has a very demure way of speaking in interviews, but that certainly doesn't signal that he's depressed with his surroundings. Is it because he filed for arbitration? The Sens have been among the most active teams in dealing with arbitration filings. Silver Seven posted an article today on that very subject, and the Sens have had 14 players file for player-elected arbitration since the 05-06 lockout. That's more than one a year on average for something that that only occurs 20-25 times per year across the whole league.  Not a single one of these cases went to arbitration after being filed. One (Havlat in '06) was traded due to salary cap constraints (ended up signing a 3 year $6m/yr contract with Chicago, more than we could accomodate) and the other 13 were all settled before the hearing. Also, the majority of key players here were loyal and happy in Ottawa for the most part, including Neil, Kelly (twice), Vermette (twice), and Condra. All of which had fine careers as part of this team. Arbitration means nothing, it's all part of the process and a player trying to get fair compensation for their job. And in context, it's been a very busy summer for management with so many RFAs to juggle. Murray & Co. said a while back that Hoffman and Chiasson would be signed later than the other Pageau/Zbad/Stone due to their arbitration situation which ensured a contract would be done with them before training camp (thus avoiding any holdouts).  On top of that, because this is a tiresome debate, I'm going to be lazy and quote myself from elsewhere:   ... I've seen some people taking a side (for some reason?) on this thing despite us knowing nothing about what's happening behind closed doors. I've seen some saying ""Hoffman is asking for too much money, trade him!!"", and other's saying ""this team is low balling him because of the budget, I hate Melnyk!!"", or some equivalent. In reality, we know nothing about what either party is asking for, and disputes could just as easily be over term or bonuses rather than the annual average. We also know little about Hoff's positive or negative attributes off the ice. So chill out! :P   /rant  Now, on to the topic at hand, because I'm genuinely not opposed to trading Hoffman if the return is appropriate. As fans of our team, there's a very good chance that our valuation of Hoffman (and other Sens players) is inflated simply because we know more about them than other fanbases, and similarly that our valuation of other teams' players are based more on reputation than actual merit. Furthermore, I'm guessing that your ""idea"" of bringing this up is directly/indirectly fueled by a certain Twitter conversation that's based on hearsay and 2nd/3rd-hand information (I heard from a friend who heard from a friend who...). There might be some accuracy to it or then again it could be a case of ""broken telephone"".  But on the note of Fowler vs. Shattenkirk, I'm pretty confident that Fowler is very overrated. Shattenkirk's reputation as a very good player is seemingly close to right though. Fowler is a couple years younger, but has had plenty of experience and isn't likely to have a surge in development large enough to catch Shattenkirk (also worth noting that both have 2/3 years left on contract, after which both are UFAs). If given the choice between the two, I'd take Shattenkirk in a heartbeat - even though it likely means Ceci goes to the third pairing or someone plays on their off-side.   But... I don't know that St.Louis (or Anaheim, for that matter) would be overly interested in a Hoffman/Cowen package. Such a package would almost certainly lead to our trade partner taking back more in salary cap hits that they they give up or can accommodate. Anaheim could probably swing it, but they have several key players left to sign this season (incl. Silfverberg, Hagelin, and some depth forwards) and a load more next year (incl. Kesler, Lindholm, Depres, Vatanen, Gibson, etc.). St. Louis on the other hand are only about $10M below the cap with Tarasenko yet to sign and some depth forwards, plus 5+ key UFAs/RFAs in need of an extension before next year (eg. Backes, Brouwer, Schwartz, etc..). On top of that, both teams have 7 dmen already signed, plus 2 or more top-6 LWers, so their desire for Hoffman isn't likely favourable to us getting a good return. And, by contrast, we're not exactly swimming in top-6 forwards, so losing Hoffman would require a pretty sizable return in spite of your vote of confidence for Michalek taking his position. Additionally, why would either of those teams be interested in trading Fowler/Shattenkirk? Anaheim has some good Dmen, but many are even younger/less experienced than Fowler, meanwhile St.Louis' defensive depth really drops off after Pietrangelo/Shattenkirk/Bouwmeester, so losing one of those top-3 would hurt them more than it would help.  In general, I'm A-ok with making a trade if it makes sense, and we as fans have fun with these fantasy trade ideas. But they have to make sense for both sides (in most cases), and from my above rant I think it's important to not throw Hoffman under the bus so hastily while we know so little."
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,Omega613,3,Mon Jul 6 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"As fans of our team, there's a very good chance that our valuation of Hoffman (and other Sens players) is inflated    I've said it before, the entire team's value is inflated for most Sens fans.  I think Hoffman though because of his campaign last year could be a good trade target - a chance for Ottawa to sell high on him.  We won't get a crazy good return but I think it's silly to expect a repeat performance this season from Hoffman.  I may be remembering wrong but Hoffman's production slowed quite a bit near the end of the season, even during that crazy run."
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,broomlad,2,Mon Jul 6 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because Mika and Ryan looked like they had nerve damage in their legs, and for some reason Cameron decided it was Hoff he should move down the lineup."

OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,thesoulofwit,6,Mon Jul 6 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"The reason is that Hoff, Cowan and a 2nd aren't going to get you Shattenkirk.  Hoff has one decent year, Cowan is a hard sell at this point in his career, and the second would at least have to be a first, even if the quality of the first two pieces were improved."
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,BashfulDragon,3,Mon Jul 6 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"People in this sub are ridiculously overvaluing Hoffman - he had one season of 25+ Goals. That does not suddenly make him the main piece in a trade for a franchise defenseman. If a trade of Hoffman, Cowen and a 2nd Rder for Shattenkirk was placed to Dougie Armstrong, he would laugh in GMBMs face.   You know how hard it is to acquire a franchise defenseman? Calgary just paid two 1st Rounders & one 2nd rounder for a player who isn't even guaranteed to be worth that much, but might be in a few years. If you want to trade for a franchise defenseman in is prime who has already gone through the development DHamilton has (and you're serious about it), that's going to look more like Ceci/Wier, Stone + 1st Rounder. And There's no way in high hell I'd ever pay that"
OttawaSenators,3cbfqe,BigRiggety,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, Calgary paid two second rounders and one first rounder.

OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Hoxtilicious,8,Sun Jul 5 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"To me, he sounds a lot like Stone (2-way guy, PP or PK, creates lots of turnovers, etc.) but with better skating and athleticism. Anyone else agree?"
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Mattpersico98,12,Sun Jul 5 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"I can only dream of getting another player like Stone on the team in the near future.

Also, another player that dropped a couple of spots due to getting mono in his draft year ; Logan Couture"
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Mattpersico98,6,Sun Jul 5 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Although I don't really like Logan Couture, having a player like him would be great. Colin White keeps on becoming more appealing and he seems like he will be a solid nhl player"

OttawaSenators,3c7op7,shallowcreek,3,Mon Jul 6 05:46:18 2015 UTC,"that part does sound like stone, but what sets him apart is his elite puck handling and hockey sense. This article definitely got me more excited about white then I was though."
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,MelvinFinklethorpe,6,Mon Jul 6 01:51:17 2015 UTC,"Winning this award 2 of the last 3 years is a testament to the scouting staff. Clearly there's still some proving to be done from Lazar, Larkin, and White but its comforting.  I had no idea what to think of White but there have been a few articles that have come out that have been really assuring. Especially since we passed on Konecny...twice. I totally was on that media hype train about him."
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Chili_Palmer,2,Sun Jul 5 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"White sounds like exactly the type of player you need to win.   And unlike Lazar, it sounds like he has some serious offensive upside, something Lazar hadn't really shown in junior.   By taking White, Murray is trying to find another Toews, Kopitar, Bergeron type of guy who can win the puck control battle against the most talented players in the league."
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Omega613,12,Sun Jul 5 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"And unlike Lazar, it sounds like he has some serious offensive upside, something Lazar hadn't really shown in junior.   Really? I've heard the opposite where Lazar is projected to have the slightly higher offensive upside (largely on account of a great shot and greater propensity to ""go to the net""), and White is projeccted to have the slightly higher defensive upside.  And you say Lazar didn't show offense in junior - um, sure he did? He played three seasons with increasing point totals of 31, 61, and finally 76 points in 58 games the year after being drafted. In particular he was quite a goal scorer where over half his point totals were goals (20, 38, 41 goals in the above years). Add to that his 3G/7P in 7 games and 5G/9P in the World Juniors, being good enough to be a top-6 centre for the team in spite of some very talented competition for the role. Not saying he was a superstar point leader by any stretch, but those are impressive numbers, especially for a mid-1st rounder. White didn't exactly show a whole extra level of offense."
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Chili_Palmer,2,Sun Jul 5 22:21:21 2015 UTC,"Guys, I know we all love Lazar, but scoring 76pts in 58G as a 19 year old first round pick in the CHL is not impressive in the least. (for the record, he scored LESS than a point per game the year after being drafted.) The only reason we all allowed ourselves to think he'd be a serious point producer is those international performances. I think he's more Chris Kelly than Jonny Toews.   As a comparison, Mark Stone had well over 100 his last two junior seasons in the WHL.  White went a point per game in the USDP battling through Mono and a wrist injury. I think we'll see a lot more offense out of him at the NHL level. The first scouting report I read started with ""a prolific scoring threat, White is reknowned for his ability to break up a scoring chance at one end and score the big goal""   Nobody has ever referred to Lazar as a prolific scoring threat, ever.   Basically, you just listed a bunch of unimpressive numbers to argue in favor of Lazar, while ignoring that White's numbers are probably actually more impressive based on the conditions under which he achieved them."
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,walahiguy,2,Mon Jul 6 10:52:07 2015 UTC,Lol he has way more upside than Chris Kelly. Tim Murray said he will score 30 goals one day in the NHL.   You're selling Lazar short. He has a pretty good amount of skill and an excellent shot and goal scoring ability
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,canuck_11,8,Mon Jul 6 11:34:22 2015 UTC,Lazar put up some decent numbers in junior.
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,canuck_11,9,Sun Jul 5 20:34:20 2015 UTC,Wow. Reading this made me really excited we got Colin. We will have to keep an eye on him in NCAA next season.

OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Akoustyk,0,Fri Jul 10 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"Idk much about white, so, I'll wait and see in order to build an opinion of him, but    Colin White is a prospect who I believe will achieve a level of success comparable to some of the under-appreciated prospects from recent drafts like Larkin and Lazar. In short, Colin White is a winner and the team that drafts him will be very happy.   Is not the sort of thing that somebody I would trust for advice would say.   I mean, if they said something like ""Alfredsson"" then I'd be impressed. But The guys he mentioned aren't in any way proven at all, and not really such a high bar that he set there. If white never becomes as valuable a player as Lazar has been to date, then I would be very surprised.   Lazar might turn out to be a lot better going forward, but he's not really a top player to use for a comparison. He plays on our third line. And it doesn't make any sense to try and demonstrate how great a prospect might become by comparing him to another prospect.   I give this article as much credit as I would if it were just some comment written by some random guy on reddit."
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Akoustyk,5,Mon Jul 6 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"So if he had compared White to a better player you would've given him more credit?  Lazar and Larkin both were named ""Mr. Under-Appreciated"" by the website in years before. The title seems to be in place just there to demonstrate how excellent certain players picked mid-first round can be.  Larkin was picked at 16, Lazar at 17 and White at 18. All players who look very promising, who were underappreciated in their draft class. This isn't an end-all be-all comparison as if White will never surpass Lazar or Larkin as his comparables. It's just a single paragraph in an incredibly fleshed out, well informed article about the type of player Colin White is, and who he could very possibly become.   That one paragraph also just so happens to be one of the only opinion based thing that the author added into the entire write-up.   Anyways you shouldn't nit-pick so much. I'm pretty sure these guys write hockey articles for a living, and, judging by the amount of info in their post, they definitely do. I would at least give them a bit of credit."
OttawaSenators,3c7op7,Akoustyk,-3,Mon Jul 6 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"So if he had compared White to a better player you would've given him more credit?   Sure, it depends on what player obviously, also. But ya, I don't know white that much, so I might listen to someone and think they might be on to something, and wait to know for myself for sure.   But if he tells me ""what a great pick! he might turn out as good as Lazar!"" I'll be like, ""uuuh, ok, whatever you say guy.""   Lazar and Larkin both were named ""Mr. Under-Appreciated"" by the website in years before. The title seems to be in place just there to demonstrate how excellent certain players picked mid-first round can be.   Obviously, as stated in the article, but referencing Lazar to demonstrate their great track record, doesn't make sense.  It's like a guy makes some picks as to who will win the stanley early in the season and then near the deadline, references his early pick, to give credit to his next one, when its not even playoffs yet.    Larkin was picked at 16, Lazar at 17 and White at 18. All players who look very promising, who were underappreciated in their draft class. This isn't an end-all be-all comparison as if White will never surpass Lazar or Larkin as his comparables. It's just a single paragraph in an incredibly fleshed out, well informed article about the type of player Colin White is, and who he could very possibly become.   Of course, but ""looks promising"" and ""has the record and history that undeniably demonstrates they are very valuable players"" is not the same thing. Players have had big swings, have gone from 50 goals a season to 25 in the blink of an eye.   A prospect is a prospect. I will care who you called under appreciated in previous years, when I look at it, and see how now, it is obvious that they actually were under appreciated.    I'm pretty sure these guys write hockey articles for a living, and, judging by the amount of info in their post, they definitely do. I would at least give them a bit of credit.   I don't care. They write articles. They wrote down a lot of stats. It doesn't mean they actually know what they are talking about. A lot of people just copy whatever else they hear in the industry and stuff like that.   There are a lot of people in the showbusiness that do it for a living and that I would not listen to for information. But there are also some guys that really know what they are talking about.   Even with drafting. Everybody that drafts drafts for a living. Some guys make better picks than others, and sometimes they all kind of suck, like with alfredsson getting picked 133rd overall in the sixth round of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. This is just some guy writing for some website. And with his comparison, he lost all credibility for me.   You can still listen to him if you want to. For me, it's just some guy's opinion, and I could find a million guys with different opinions. I'll wait and see, so I can judge for myself what I think."
OttawaSenators,3c8cxu,Mattpersico98,27,Sun Jul 5 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Contracts don't always get rewarded simply based on production, or even how ""good"" a player is (more often than not a player is over/underpaid, rather than paid what they're truly worth - which is also subjective). Player/team ambitions, experience, budget/cap space, role, draft pedigree, position, off-ice contributions, agent negotiations abilities, etc.etc.etc. also all play a HUGE role in determining a player salary.  With Kadri, there are a lot of differences that you're ignoring in terms of ability and situation that make him tough to compare with Hoff. But if you're really looking for a comparable then the best I've encountered is Anders Lee. They have similar experience/path to the NHL, similar NHL/AHL production, same age/draft year/late round picks, close underlying stats, team role, etc...:   Basic Stats Bombay Charts Hero Charts   For anyone that's not precisely sure what those charts show, just note the relative similarity in shape/form/etc.. Know also that the sample size is reasonable for both players having both played a full season, but some movement (plus or minus) wouldn't be surprising in the future.  Anders Lee was just awarded a contract of $3.75M/yr over 4 years. Hoffman, based on evidence above, is a slightly better player (defensively in particular, based on the Hero charts, but also a little less offense), but they're both awfully close and this team wouldn't put too much weight on the more advanced metrics. On the other hand any bridge/arbitration deal (for 1 year) won't likely be eating into his UFA years. So from that give-and-take, I would expect a 1 year deal that's in the same ballpark as Lee, meaning $3.5M-$4.0M (give or take a small amount). But again, often contracts truly aren't ""fair"" or representative of a player's true abilities, so who knows what the deal is.   And while we're on the subject, I've seen some people taking a side (for some reason?) on this thing despite knowing nothing about what's happening behind closed doors. I've seen some saying ""Hoffman is asking for too much money!!"", and other's saying ""this team is low balling him because of the budget, I hate Melnyk!!"", or some equivalent. In reality, we know nothing about what either party is asking for, and disputes could just as easily be over term or bonuses rather than the annual average. We also know little about Hoff's positive or negative attributes off the ice. So chill out! :P"

I have no issue with Hoffman trying to make big while he can... you never know how long your career is going to last, and if we lose him because he demands too much that sucks, but I'm not going to forever hate him for it, it makes sense.   Taking a contract negotiation to arbitration can damage relationships and is tough - your team is saying why you aren't worth what you think you're worth while also trying to retain you - but will help set the price is a somewhat more objective way and help both sides come to an agreement. While we have room now to re-sign Hoffman, even with Melnyk's internal budget the team has to consider whether the team can do the contract Hoffman wants if he wants long-term. Depending on what our team does, we have several players in 2016 that will need raises in Ceci and Wiercioch (assuming Neil and Phillips are gone), in 2017 in Lazar, Smith, Pageau, Michalek, and Zibanejad (assuming Greening and Cowen will be gone, possibly Michalek and Smith), in 2018 in Anderson, Hammond, Borowiecki, Turris, Stone (assuming one of the goaltenders and Boro may be gone), and then in 2019 in a mega-contract for Karlsson and another raise for Methot (granted I doubt Hoffman would have this long of a contract). The team can't just flip $3-4.5M/season for any lengthy period of time without considering the future, and that's what this is all about, internal budget or not."

Moulson is the closest comparable as a guy who had one big NHL season after an AHL career, him and the Islanders settled for 3.5 under a smaller cap.  -If I were to guess, Hoffman gets around 4."

OttawaSenators,3c3sgb,Curtis_Lazar,4,Sun Jul 5 04:37:11 2015 UTC,When they first drafted him I wasn't really sure about the pick. But know I seem to be liking him more and more everyday
OttawaSenators,3c3sgb,Omega613,-1,Sat Jul 4 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"""Could give McDavid a run for his money in the skating category""  Hate to say it but this sounds like BS. McDavid is already one of the fastest skaters of all time at 18 years old. If White was close to him in terms of skating ability, he would have been a top 10 pick no problem, and I would've heard about his speed much more.  I'm sure he's quick, but not that quick. And don't worry, I am very ready for Patrice Bergeron Lite to prove me wrong."
OttawaSenators,3c3sgb,Akoustyk,5,Sat Jul 4 16:08:41 2015 UTC,"I believe when they say ""skating"", they're being more broad than simply straight-line speed.  Colin White is incredibly agile, so I presume they mean ""skating"" in the sense of the whole package: speed, cornering, skating backwards, acceleration, etc.etc.etc.. I'm sure McDavid would be first in one category (eg. Speed), but fifth in another - and likewise with several other players excelling in particular areas. But White's fitness and agility could give him 2nd or 3rd across the board, or something similar, making him an all around tremendous skater. Now I say all that from speculation and trying to justify the given claims, I can't pretend to know much/anything about White or how he compares to others in the draft. But the best 'proof' of this is probably based on the combine results, in which Colin White placed 1st in agility testing from both sides (<-#4 in the link given). That's a big accomplishment, especially looking at his competition."
OttawaSenators,3c3sgb,lavjames,3,Sun Jul 5 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"I would rather agility, and sort of puck vision and hockey sense over speed. Speed can be worked on and trained. Hockey sense, cannot, and agility, is often also a mental sort of thing. as it shows the brain is well suited for working out how to move to best get certain results.   Speed can just be the gym. I'm pretty sure though, McDavids best skill must be of the sort of hockey sense. I don't know him, and never watched him play, nor heard people talk specifically about him in any sort of detail, but if he went number one, with so much fanfare, he must be very skilled in the uncoachables."

OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,lSerbial,9,Sat Jul 4 20:38:00 2015 UTC,Except Condra had tremendous value in possession stats.  He made the third line one of the best and the players around him better.   Chaisson makes players much worse.
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,vashnevskaya,8,Sun Jul 5 07:14:21 2015 UTC,Loved him for the first 20 games or so. Then he disappeared.
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,TrulyMagnificient,2,Sat Jul 4 21:01:49 2015 UTC,I feel like him having the pressure of being a Spezza replacement got to him after those 20 games.
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,TheKandyCinema,9,Sun Jul 5 13:47:32 2015 UTC,6'3 but doesn't play that big yet. Took a lot of dumb penalties last year. Would really like to see him find his game. I am not sure what he thinks his value is but it isn't much yet.
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,canuck_11,5,Sat Jul 4 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"Not overly worried about it. He has limited experience and had limited impact on his team's success, and thus the effects of arbitration will be minimal compared to other players. They'll still be able to sign him cheap, and likely will to at least save some face on the Spezza deal but (more likely, since really a franchise doesn't care about purely saving face) to see what he could develop into. Everyone hated on him because of his lack of production, but it was only his second full season, in a new city, with new expectations."
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,PaddleDown,3,Sun Jul 5 03:43:51 2015 UTC,Apparently you can't buyout anyone below a 2.75 million cap hit in the second window... And Greening's is... 2.65

OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,Funkativity,0,Sun Jul 5 10:44:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think either side ever wants to go to arbitration if for nothing other than the sake of their relationship. That said, I don't think I was being pessimistic about the arbitration process in this case... we're quite likely to come out of it with a signing that both can agree to. Hoffman, on the other hand, I'm not too sure."
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,PaddleDown,2,Sun Jul 5 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"I like him, and I think this is an opportunity to possibly sign him as a 3rd/4th line salary that could be adding depth scoring in a couple seasons.    He isn't spectacular with foot speed, but when he goes to the net he has good hands to jam in anything loose. He needs to fill out a lot more, and use his size more. I am concerned with the PIMs though, untimely lazy penalties were a thing for a while and he was ripped away from the top 6 almost immediately."
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Sun Jul 5 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"I know the kid's young, but.. Is there any aspect of his game which anyone likes? (Besides size)  Greening is at least more effective on the forecheck..."
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,OfficialGreenkid,8,Sun Jul 5 17:35:51 2015 UTC,I like his ability to go in front of the net. He deserves a chance to see what he can do next year. Lots of sophomores slump.   He still outproduced Condra last year.
OttawaSenators,3c4dcs,walahiguy,2,Sat Jul 4 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like a big part of the issue is that people don't realize how little experience he really has. He was never projected to be a solid top-6 forward, but at the same time this is his 2nd team in his 2nd NHL season, and we have to give him somewhat of an opportunity to find his place before concluding on our judgement of him. He can at the very least be a cheaper and more sensible alternative to Greening and forecheck like mad. He had good drive but just didn't click, it's worth seeing what he might be able to do with a short contract."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,CookingInTheKitchen,10,Sat Jul 4 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming he's asking for a 27-goal scorer's contract and the Sens want to see him prove he can do it again first. If that's the case, flip him because I really don't know if he can."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,tenders11,11,Sat Jul 4 13:53:15 2015 UTC,I get the feeling he doesn't want to be a Senator.  Maybe it's the way Cameron treated him?  With arbitration we're almost guaranteed that he'll be a Senator come pre-season.  After that?  Who knows.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,Ubuhio,2,Sat Jul 4 15:17:55 2015 UTC,I get the same impression :(
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,TheTiniestPirate,2,Sat Jul 4 20:55:04 2015 UTC,The beauty is they have another year to work through their issues. This is a good thing for both parties.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,TheDarkDub,10,Sun Jul 5 09:04:31 2015 UTC,I hope he's not asking for more than Stone is getting; I don't quite think he deserves that. But I also hope the Sens' offer isn't insulting. He doesn't deserve that either. I hope we get to keep him.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,DawnaBard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:21:55 2015 UTC,2 yrs AAV 1.5 seems fair to me. Around what Palmieri is getting with the Devils is a decent deal.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,kenata88,2,Sun Jul 5 06:54:28 2015 UTC,"He'll get, and deserves way more than that based on his rookie production.   I would be surpised if he gets less than 2.5 a season."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,CatoDarpa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:07:35 2015 UTC,Barely stay in the lineup??? lol what season did you watch. He played 79 games (and none in the AHL).   He spent maybe 10 games on the 4th line when his production slowed (at the end of the season) and he still got power play time. But that was more Cameron than anything. He was never not going to be on the team. and he will absolutely be a top 6 next season.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,CatoDarpa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"You literally have no idea what your talking about. Seriously.   Hoff played in the top six for 80% of the season. He moved down to the 4th line during the final stretch when his production tapered. Neil and Smith Were not injured for the whole season, they were healthy scratches for the vast majority of it. Puemple wasnt even playing on the team until the injuries started, he was never going to replace Hoffman.... And he is absolutely more valuable than Condra, he was our leading scorer.  Im convinced you didnt actually watch any hockey this year. So Im not responding any longer"
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,CatoDarpa,13,Sun Jul 5 21:15:36 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, it's a good thing he made the first move. While the Arbiter may award Hoffman a contract higher than we'd like to pay, we get to set term (1 year!). And if the Arbiter awards over $3.8M, then we can walk away if we want.   And if he makes a stink about it all after arbitration, then we can trade him away on a pretty reasonable contract.   Exactly how I expected this to go. No need to worry whatsoever."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,relapsingoncemore,2,Sun Jul 5 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"The player almost always files the movement, not the team, since the team can only take a player to arbitration once over the course of his career... so if arbitration was going to happen, it was pretty much a guarantee that Hoffman's camp was going to make the move."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,PaddleDown,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"I'd much prefer we got him for longer term. As a team that can't spend to the cap, the Sens have to take risks in order to have a shot at playoff success. One way of doing this is to rely on rookie players continuing their production in further seasons."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,whereverjustice,2,Sat Jul 4 14:06:05 2015 UTC,"Only problem there is that we'd pay for UFA years in the contract. Better to punt his contract issues for a year, when he'd still be RFA (two years remaining), and we have a number of contracts come off the books, so the internal budget isn't as much of a concern.   As far as I can see, a 1 year works in everyones favour (except maybe Hoffman if he wants to make it to UFA and leave the team), in that it we don't have to commit long-term right now, and Hoffman has an opportunity to prove himself and potentially sign a sizable contract we couldn't afford to sign him to right now."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,relapsingoncemore,3,Sun Jul 5 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"A big part of arbitration decisions are experience and past production. Hoffman doesn't have a lot of experience and while his production was excellent and a major factor in team success, it was only for one year rather than a string of years. Do I expect him to get a significant raise? Sure. Do I expect it to be as ridiculous as it might be as a UFA signing? No. He might still want more than we (or most other teams) would be willing to offer with such a small sample size, but time will tell."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,PaddleDown,13,Sat Jul 4 18:26:53 2015 UTC,"I've been hearing rumblings that he's asking for and wants more than what we can afford or even want to spend.  I'm wondering if we can flip him for a top 4 D or a top 6 F, IF push comes to shove. I heard St. Louis likes Hoffman... Shattenkirk or Pietrangelo could be cool."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,Ubuhio,23,Sat Jul 4 18:36:09 2015 UTC,I think you might be as guilty of overvaluing the Hoff as the man himself.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,WrathfulNarwhal,5,Sun Jul 5 03:49:29 2015 UTC,Obviously we would have to package something together. There's no way we get a top 4 D for a rookie. I'm just thinking of what our options could be and what GMBM can get on the trade market.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,ftardontherun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:37:29 2015 UTC,Both Shatty and Pietrangelo are top 2 elite defensemen. And Right handed.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,BigRiggety,3,Sat Jul 4 13:54:53 2015 UTC,Pietrangelo   It'll take Hoff + Stone + 2016 1st to get that done.
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,Ubuhio,4,Sat Jul 4 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"Soooo a one-time 25+ Goal scorer for a franchise defenseman?? I don't think St Louis would pull the trigger on that unless it was something like Hoff, Cowen, 2016 1st Rder, 2017 1st rder. And that's probably not even close to enough"
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,qubat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'd be ok with Hoff/Cowen and picks.  Two firsts seems a bit high after that.  Both Hoff and Cowen have potential high ceilings.  Maybe package Hoff and Cowen as ""like two firsts"" and then give them some later round picks"
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,Frailled,3,Sat Jul 4 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"Hoffman and Cowen do not come close to the value of Shattenkirk or Pietrangelo. Even with picks that deal would never happen, not least of all because St. Louis is still in win-now mode last I checked."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,devin27,-1,Sat Jul 4 14:17:17 2015 UTC,Well if we can Value Hoff as a first rounder all we need to give is two second rounders. That's the going price for a franchise defenseman

Hoffman will really be good to have with the new 3 on 3 overtime as well.  Great speed and a wicked shot - hopefully he stays, even if it's just a one year deal."
OttawaSenators,3c3ns9,lSerbial,5,Mon Jul 6 22:33:13 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a 1 year deal at all. Prove to us he can do what he did last season again.

Nick Paul is dominant and isn't even playing full speed. Puempel is a level above the rest. Ryan Dzingel is the next best forward. Real skilled and smart player. Buddy Robinson is fast, huge and close to competing for an NHL roster spot. All the goalies have been great especially O'Connor. Joel Daccord was very surprising. Athletic and looked like a much higher draft pick. He is going to face a lot of pucks over the next few seasons in USHL and college.

Also, the classic post penalty shift was Condra/Pageau/Lazar with Methot/Karlsson on the point for the momentum off of the kill.

OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,FixedTheNewelPost,21,Fri Jul 3 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"The direction is that the team is good enough to make the playoffs as is, is very young, and has a solid core. The FA market was shitty this year, and a lot of prospects are coming up that need playing time. Playoffs now, legit contender in 2-3 years as core + prospects grow together."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,RichMilk,5,Fri Jul 3 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"The issue is the team is realistically NOT good enough to make the playoffs. We are at BEST a bubble team in a division that hasn't gotten a lot easier. And in a Conference that has gotten a HELL of a lot harder. Wildcard spots are going to be a premium with the moves the Pens, Caps, Blue Jackets and Philly have made.   Remember we only made the post season because of a lights out once in a career run from an unknown goalie. This isn't going to happen again. And in all reality as the NHL has shown us every time rookies regress before they hit their prime.   As for the goalie scenario OP was talking about, we have Andy left for 2 years and then we are in the twilight zone. Hammond isn't going to be an elite goalie. O'Connor is a wild card and we have potential prospects but no proven's in the barn. We are going to be in a tough spot in 2-3 years.   TLDR: We are not a playoff team, and we are no where near a contender in 2-3 years when our goalie situation goes to hell."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,2,Fri Jul 3 14:07:21 2015 UTC,"I think we are definitely a playoff team and if Cameron had been around all year we wouldn't have needed the miracle run. As for the goalies, a lot can change in two years but either a prospect will step up or the team will find one in free agency or by trade. Lots of good goalies moved around this year."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,RichMilk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:22:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, I think the goaltending situation will now become a move in the future.     To me, It's difficult to say Ottawa is a playoff team. Ottawa will be in the mix between Boston/Florida/Detroit for that 3rd division spot, or maybe wildcard. NYI/NYR/PIT/WSH/CBJ will all be in the mix as well so the wildcard may be more difficult than Ottawa thinks. Of course this ignores all injuries/hot streaks/actual results and just looks at the league on paper.  If there really are no moves out there then fine, but I've always thought Ottawa will make the right moves when the time is right. I'm just seeing that window of opportunity start to open and instead of taking the leap Ottawa is on the sideline counting pennies."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,0,Fri Jul 3 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that if Cameron was at the helm all year it would have been a different season. But I am not convinced that means we would have been a lock for the post season.   Also every one is screaming for us to move guys like Prince or Puempel into the line up. We are already an incredibly in-experienced team. Adding more is going to potentially hurt us more than help, and also hinder the growth of theses players as they will be in lesser roles and ice time. Ottawa honestly needs a guy like Oshie or whatnot to fill the top6. Or better yet a guy like Oduya to help secure that blue line.  BUT to me the honest to god time to move for Ottawa will be in the next 2 seasons when Greening, Neil and Phillips come off the books. Ottawa HAS to use that cash to do something to really solidify the team.   As for the goalie scenario yes, we can make moves for one, but that just comes back to why did we move Lehner if that is the case? Because it can potentially cost us the same as we paid. BUT again I liked the Lehner move.   All my 2 pennies"
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,0,Fri Jul 3 14:32:36 2015 UTC,Ottawa has no need for a guy like Oshie. We have plenty of guys like him. We are already a playoff team and adding a guy like Puempel will make our scoring even more dangerous. This team is closer to cup contention then you think. We are going to be Tampa this year or next.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,2,Fri Jul 3 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"We have plenty? Really? Who? We have a couple guys comparable but saying Oshie wouldn't be an asset is foolish.   Puempel has not proven a thing in the NHL. Thinking we will be the next Tampa is optimistic, love it. Hope it's true. But no scout has ever reported our prospects even in the realm of what Tampa acquired.    I get it, you are a die hard, blinders on Sens fan. That is awesome. Keep going we need ppl like you."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,2,Fri Jul 3 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"Oshie is a right winger. He is not better than Ryan or stone, so it wouldn't make any sense to acquire him. He hasn't really done anything in a while in the league. He is on the decline.   Tampas prospects weren't that great as prospects. Kucherov didn't do anything in the NHL before this year. They sucked for a long time unlike us. We have lots of good underrated prospects and we have the best drafting and development team in the league. I couldn't care as what guys like the hockey news say about our prospects. Nick Paul is going to be a great addition to our team, and Matt Puempel looks like a sure fire NHL top six. We just added a great D in Chabot and a top forward prospect in Colin White. We have one of the best D not playing in the NHL in Mikael Wikstrand. We always find players after the first round.   This team will be loaded for a long time. I don't think it's optimistic that we will be the next Tampa. I think it's realistic. I might even say we will finish higher than them this season."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,SINZAR,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:52:33 2015 UTC,"Your argument comes down to a matter of perspective. Yes we were very lucky that Hammond played like he did and we made it into the playoffs. However how many leads were blown and lead to losses? How many times did the Sens score only to have a soft goal let in (damnit Lehner) and blow the momentum? I viewed the team last year as a young, talented team that was under-performing as opposed to how you seem to view them which as an untalented team who over-performed."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"Are you serious? We just made the playoffs and will be better this year, while most teams in our division got a lot worse."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"Again. We made the playoffs because of a ""Not going to happen again"" super performance from a goalie who was unknown.   No we didn't get better. We stayed basically the same. And as the NHL has shown with nearly every rookie every, they regress.   And no most teams didn't get worse. Toronto was never a threat, and they still aren't. Detroit, Buffalo, Tampa and Florida all are going to be a lot better. And our conference got INSANELY better over all. The wildcard spots will not be easily obtained."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Chiefboss22,2,Fri Jul 3 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"But our run of being bad early in the season won't happen again either, with guys like Stone and Hoffman having emerged, a healthy Methot, and no more MacLean.  The factors that made us successful are still present and all of our important players are expected to progress, not regress  Also, in terms of Detroit getting better, they all just got a year older. Datsyuk may not even start the season.  You think signing Brad Richards and Mike Green make them a lot better? Talk about rookies regressing, how about guys whos best season was 6 years ago?"
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"Very true.   Realistically it's all who knows. Can Stone and Hoff keep it up? When nearly every rookie ever regresses for a season or two.   Ottawa is a good team, and has a bright future, and I am excited to see where it goes. I just wish they added a little something more to help them along ;)"
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Chiefboss22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:53:14 2015 UTC,"You're right that they will regress, probably. Especially Hoffman who I think was riding pretty high SH%.  I think it'll be enough, but yeah, there are no real locks for the playoffs.   I bet Montreal struggles to make it more than we do. Price is great, but for him to play another season at that level is just unlikely, and their team is nothing without him."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:01:42 2015 UTC,I have been crazy surprised with the lack of changes in MTL.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,2,Fri Jul 3 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"Disagree... Hammond played stellar and helped, but the whole god damn team played with such determination... it wasnt just the goalies super performance."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,0,Fri Jul 3 15:53:28 2015 UTC,"Ok yes, the team played well around him. But c'mon it was mostly the goalie. There is a reason he was the talk of the NHL for that last month, was in every spotlight and highlight."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,3,Fri Jul 3 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Disagree. We are clearly a better team then we showed the first half of year. We barely had any rookies in the lineup last year so I don't know what you're talking. To me we are an absolute lock for the playoffs especially in our division. Hammond was not the reason we made the playoffs. We have great depth at all positions, a Norris trophy winning dman, and a top 10 goalie. All the pieces needed to make the playoffs and go on a run."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,0,Fri Jul 3 14:41:29 2015 UTC,alright you are impossible. please keep the hype and blinders going.

OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:56:10 2015 UTC,lol sure thing. you are cool man.   I am glad there are blinded trolls like you on the internet.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,0,Fri Jul 3 14:59:02 2015 UTC,It's pretty much impossible for Tampa to be a lot better. What has Florida done? Detroit? All they added was a one dimensional dman and their centres and not getting any younger. We are better than them no question
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:42:48 2015 UTC,"It's as possible for Tampa to be as much better as Ottawa. They are as young if not younger.   Florida acquired players like Jager (joke all you want, dude is legit) and they will have an older Ekblad who is going to be pushing for that Norris in no time.   Again it's obvious you are a very blinded Sens fan. And I love it."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,0,Fri Jul 3 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry but your argument for Florida is bullshit. Somehow they will magically get a lot better but we won't, even though we were already the playoff team? Florida added nothing either, but apparently they will get better an we won't. Wow.   You're being a negative nancy for the sake of being a negative Nancy."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:55:49 2015 UTC,I never said a lot. Said they would get better.   Keep being a blind fan for the sake of being a blind fan.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,RichMilk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"Why would our rookies regress but Ekblad will get better? Ottawa will be battling for a playoff spot, obviously, like every other team is, but looking at the depth chart (assuming RFAs get signed), what spots can realistically be improved? Maybe 3rd line LW and 3rd pair RD? So we take a chance on $4milx5 for Beleskey and pay Oduya or something? Why when we have prospects coming up who could conceivably play better with less financial commitment. Everybody earned their spots (or pressbox seats) with their play last year."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,0,Fri Jul 3 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"rookies generally regress, and yea its a catch 22. Ekbald however is one of those insane generational players. He may regress as well it's very possible, BUT we have a roster heavy filled with rookies right now.   People keep saying we have people who can play better than these uff's but it's not true. We don't have an Oshie in Bingo. Sorry to say.  But yes Ottawa is in a good place not a terrible place. I just wanted to see them lock down one more part to help it all along.  The blue line is especially where we need something, we are gambling on Boro, Cowen, Weir and Ceci being good next year which is a risk. Cecil and Weir are going to be good D down the road, but adding a guy like Oduya is always a good move.   We are however locked down by some bad contracts and that is how it is."

OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,mike-kt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"Ok but who's the goalie when that core and prospects have grown? I think that's OP's point - if they were planning on winning in 3 years, why keep Anderson?"
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,RichMilk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:35:39 2015 UTC,O'Connor or another prospect and if they all suck then re-sign Andy for a couple more and if he sucks trade or sign one.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,2,Fri Jul 3 14:16:55 2015 UTC,I don't think people realize how good Oconnor is as a prospect. No different than Lehner.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Chili_Palmer,11,Fri Jul 3 14:39:18 2015 UTC,"Let me break it down for you:  Lehner trade:   -Murray is banking on Andy being good for another 4 years or so  -Lehner is concussed and still an unknown at this point, the mental side of it may still stay in the way of him being a high end goalie ever.   -We got a first rounder and a salary dump. Good deal, we don't need Lehner and have plenty of time to find another goalie of the future (there have been lots of good starting goaltenders moved in the last 5 seasons, so it's no rush. the position is not at a premium right now)  Free Agency  -Who the fuck did you want? literally every free agent deal was a shitty player at a shitty price.  -Trades? You think Kessel or Hamilton would've been traded in-division? No. Saad and Hagelin costed a TON from those teams, and while they'll be good, I don't see how either one is worth an A level prospect plus another great asset.  -Oshie sure, I would have liked him, but hey - maybe St Louis valued Brouwer types really highly and our offer didn't make the cut. It happens.   Budget  This I can't even address, because at no point in your rambling, incoherent response did you say anything that could be considered a rational thought.   Look, I get it, you loved Lehner - but get over it, he has shown very little since his Calder cup win, and absolutely ZERO consistency - which is the name of the game for goaltenders. Lots of guys have hot streaks of 20 games then go cold for 40, look at Hammond, Scrivens, Reimer, Pavelec - it's the guys who do it consistently for 82 games plus playoffs that are the real Gems, and that's what Craig is.   I'm sure Murray is trying to acquire his top 6/top 4, but the fact is that he won't want to trade anything off the roster except the guys nobody wants. People are going to ask for Stone, Hoffman, Zibby, or Lazar, not Greening, Smith, Neil, or Cowen. So you wait it out.   What you don't get is that we already have a great core in place.   Karlsson, Methot, Ceci, Weircioch on defense  Turris, Stone, Ryan, Zibby, Lazar, Hoffman, Pageau up front.   These guys will be here for a while, and most of them will get quite a bit better from here on out.  Now, what do you do once you have a full NHL roster? You look for quantity for quality trades, like we did with Ryan - unfortunately, looks like none were there.   But by keeping your farm constantly stocked, and ours is fucking stocked right now, you are able to swap out guys like aging Michaleks and Macarthurs for better young players:  Puempel, Prince, Paul, Lindberg, White, Gagne, Chlapik, Ahl, Chabot, Wikstrand, Englund, Claesson, and Harpur all look like they have a shot at being great NHLers at this point.  Not many teams have that kind of talent in the pipeline.  So stop whining, our window is not now, and the entire team was built around a window starting in another season or two. Your only point seems to be that trading Lehner doesn't fit with that, which might be true, but maybe Lehner wasn't fitting in here and we already know that he was having a hard time dealing with not being starter. So fuck him.   TL;DR - Acting like the team has no direction because of a simple goalie trade of a guy who hasn't played more than 20 good NHL games in 3 years is a ridiculous overreaction."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,BottledBarf,3,Fri Jul 3 12:04:39 2015 UTC,"Can't agree more.  Do we have to dump on this young, rising, well-stocked team because they traded their third-string goalie and a fourth-line winger?  Look at how well management has drafted and have some faith that they know what they're doing."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,-2,Fri Jul 3 13:58:06 2015 UTC,"I think you have missed the bigger point.   Yes our core is ""ok"" but lets compare it to actual contending teams. We are FAAAAAR behind the curve.   I think the realistic thought for Sens fans should be we need to be ok with just being a playoff team. And make that our goal.   Let's be honest. I mean really honest. Do the Sens have the depth to beat a team like Chicago, Caps, LA, Tampa etc? No. we really don't.   I loved the Lehner trade, we got a good return. But pretending Andy is going to be solid for another 4 years is a little much. Especially when he is already flakey as is.   We are unfortunately stuck with some bad contracts, and to me the REAL showcase will be when Greening, Neil, Phillips all come off the books if BMGM And Melly are willing to put that cash towards really stocking the team.   As always with this time of year, fans just want to see their team do something positive, snag a good addition, make a move for that good available player. And Ottawa hasn't done that. Which is fine, but ppl need to stop pretending it's because we are a playoff team already. It's especially frustrating when you see teams making seemingly great pickups that you wish your team did.   TL;DR - Fans are going to be touchy right now, they want additions and changes but it will all simmer down in a few weeks."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Chili_Palmer,3,Fri Jul 3 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point, not me - this team isn't MEANT to contend yet.   We have the depth to contend with anybody, what we're missing is the top-end skill. We don't have a Toews, a Stamkos, or a Kopitar.   If we keep developing depth, eventually you hope to be able to move two solid prospects, a Lazar and a first rounder or some similar package for an elite top line forward to make a push for a cup.   teams do it all the time - LA was just like us now before making the Richards/Carter deals, Boston was just like us before landing Chara, Anaheim in 2007 before landing Pronger/Neidermayer.   You just need to make sure your team is ready before you pull that trigger for a solid elite veteran, and we're not yet. Fans have to understand that."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,2,Fri Jul 3 15:10:18 2015 UTC,Then I agree with you 100% :)
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,0,Fri Jul 3 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"No we aren't, compare our lineup to tampas. Tell me the big differences once our guys fully mature"
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,0,Fri Jul 3 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"Really?   Tampa: Stamkos & Johnson and most importantly Bishop are better than Ottawas comparable. guys like Kucherov and Palat are also better but potentially on par with our top line guys.  BUT I will say that there is obviously an unknown with the NHL, maybe one of our unknown like Prince turns into the next Stamkos who knows. But it's very doubtful. Again, Ottawa can make the moves to improve but as it stands right now we are not that true contender."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,2,Fri Jul 3 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"Bishop is not a better goalie than Anderson. The point is this Tampa team was not considered a contender going into the year. Johnson, palat, kucherov? We have turris, stone, Ryan, zibanejad, MacArthur. We have Karlsson who is better than any forward or D they have. We don't need a stamkos to contend and neither did Tampa really."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,-2,Fri Jul 3 14:44:26 2015 UTC,"Bishop is a better goalie, please stop pretending Anderson is this legendary goalie.   Karlsson is our Stamkos in my books they negate one another if you will in the comparable.   But lets not forget. Who was in the finals? Tampa. Who wasn't. Ottawa."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,3,Fri Jul 3 14:49:15 2015 UTC,He's not the better goalie and has never been. Anderson is top five in the league in save percentage since being acquired by Ottawa. Anyone who knows anything about goalies will tell you who the better goalie is technically. Bishop just so happens to end up on a great team. Not because of him.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,-2,Fri Jul 3 14:53:47 2015 UTC,"yes sure. ok.   Price, Henrik, Raask, Varly, Holtby, Rinne, Bobrov, Quick all easily better than Anderson. In a heartbeat.   And then guys like Crawford who are multi cup winning goalies. But some don't think they are great.   Anderson MAY sneak into the top 10 possibly."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,BottledBarf,3,Fri Jul 3 14:55:31 2015 UTC,"Stay the course.  Our players are only getting better.  We have the league's best defenceman and defence is the most important position.  The players around EK will be one year better.  Goaltending is not weaker.  Given the way Lehner's played the last couple of years, Anderson/Hammond is a far stronger combination.  And as the trade market proved, NHL goalies are not really that difficult to find anymore, unless you think Lehner's going to turn into the next Price or Rask, which he isn't.  Those two were way further along at 23 than Lehner is.  I don't think there's any negative message to Anderson either.  They chose him over Lehner and it was pretty clear for a long time that he was their guy.  Anderson's probably got at least three (and who knows, maybe five) good seasons left in him.  That's an eternity in sports."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"The main issue is the goaltending is getting older, and will get weaker. Right around the time our players are in the prime age he is going to be gone. And then we are left with Hammond/O'Connor."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,BottledBarf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:14:24 2015 UTC,"Unless they make a trade, sign a free agent or draft someone in the next five years.  There were plenty of good goalies available this summer."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, but that comes back to why did we trade Lehner then? Realistically if we want to get a goalie of the same calibre it will cost similar. BUT that doesn't mean we didn't make the right choice. I like the Lehner trade, we got a good return. But it may cost us the same down the road just to fill a role that Lehner could easily have been in at that time.  my 2 pennies."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,BottledBarf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean that's the risk.  They had to ditch someone.  I'm just not sure Lehner's potential is that high at this point.  I'm inclined to trust Murray and the staff when it comes to evaluating their own talent though."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"for sure, who knows. Lehner could be a flop. He could also be an incredibly dominate Goalie. BUT as you say we had to move someone, and we got the best return I think we could hve."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,walahiguy,3,Fri Jul 3 14:46:56 2015 UTC,"This became a shitshow of ""disagree = downvotes"". Not the most productive discussion we've had here.    It's good to see were all passionate I guess??? (Glass half-full and all that...)"
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Chiefboss22,2,Fri Jul 3 23:29:12 2015 UTC,How did goaltending get weaker? We dumped Lehner for a 1st and have lots of depth after Anderson.
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,OfficialGreenkid,2,Fri Jul 3 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, we are looking to be a playoff team immediately.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't look to the future as well.  Trading Lehner improves the future outlook of the team with no expense to the present (Anderson+Hammond) and potentially no expense to the future (O'Connor vs. Lehner two years from now is not a clear loss).  You asked, how old will Bobby Ryan be by the time Prince (or Puempel, or Paul, or any 2015 picks) are able to contribute scoring depth? Well, he is 28 now. You don't think any of those guys will contribute in the next 5 years? Teuvo Terevainen is 20 years old and played a role on the Hawks. Did you predict 23YO Mark Stone or 25YO Mike Hoffman breaking out this year? Puempel and Prince are 22.  TL:DR All management decisions do not need to be made with the same specific goal in mind. Good management should aim for success now AND success later."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Ass_Stephens,2,Fri Jul 3 15:46:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say the ""message to Andy"" would be...""we love everything we've seen OUTSIDE the kitchen. Please keep it up."""
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,4,Fri Jul 3 21:29:43 2015 UTC,Disappointed? What moves would you have made? Trade a 7th for Stamkos?

OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"Haha, while I appreciate the tongue-in-cheek reply, that wasn't the point of this post. I wanted to create discussion about the direction of this team. Just as any other fan, I want to see Ottawa taking steps to start entering the top 10 teams in the league, and I haven't seen that through the most recent transactions.    Unfortunately I'm not a GM so I don't know who all was out there, but do you really want to give up a 7th rounder with THAT kind of potential for a guy that only plays like 13 minutes a game? ;)"
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you on the Andy thing. I feel like he'll play out this season, but we'll deal him next year when the goalie market is similar to this year. I don't think it's fair for him to play into his retirement making decent playoff runs, but not real chances at the cup.   Also I get what you're saying about us not making many moves on players, but we just have to be patient until we feel it's our year to make a really good cup run. I'm glad we didn't pick up any free agents and I know players being traded are like eye candy and I could make up a reason why we should have got Oshie or Saad or anyone being traded, but we don't need them. Look at this team the same way you would look at the Flames. The flames are pretty much us in the West. Once we get our defense thriving the same way theirs is, we'll be a solid cup contender. Also try not to look past our players so much and underestimate them. I'm guilty of this too, but we have 6 or 7 fantastic players, and arguably the best defenseman in the league. I sometimes forget about our awesome roster when comparing us to other teams, but you just have to remember, our version of a superstar forward is at our blue line."
OttawaSenators,3bxvcs,peskysens,0,Fri Jul 3 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"ITT: People who have no idea what value was available in the UFA this year. Hilarious that every one believes that there was zero upgrades that Ottawa could have pursued.   I personal am ok with the Lehner trade, simply because as it came out he was not meshing with out system. It wasn't going to get better in Ottawa, and we got a decent return. Fine, that is done and over.   But thinking that Williams, Green, Sekera, Oshie, Oduya to name a few of the people who were available wouldn't have improved this team is laughable."

Buddy Robinson, Shane Prince, Matt Puempel, Nick Paul are all players looking to crack the bottom of the lineup in the next three years. Ottawa frustrated Pageau for two full seasons by creating a bloated bottom 6 in front of him, and are avoiding that this time.

OttawaSenators,3bvoag,smlamont,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:02:42 2015 UTC,Legwand was a 2 year deal...
OttawaSenators,3bvoag,Omega613,7,Mon Jul 6 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"Long post exploring other options with Condra:  Everyone likes to assume that Condra, as a bottom-6 player, must in turn be a ""replaceable"" asset. Technically speaking, yes, we do have other players who could play in his position, and perhaps even some who could bring more offense. However, I don't think credit is being given to the fact that good AND cheap bottom-6 players are actually quite rare and much tougher to replace. You don't often get ""good"" and ""cheap"" together in the bottom-6, outside of entry-level contracts and some bridge deals (eg. Pageau). Most players in the $1.0m-$1.5M range aren't very good, but they'll play their assigned role for 8-10 minutes a game to give better players a rest. On the flip side, most ""good"" bottom-6 players are actually fringe/full top-6 guys who are pushed down the depth chart, but consequently carry a much higher cap hit (eg. Michalek). Most team's have 4-6 decent/good top-6 players, and most only have 1-2 good and cheap bottom-6 players (including ELCs). That makes players like Condra rarer than the fabled top-6 guys, even if their trade value is lower. So here's where I have a problem with this...  I think we all know and accept that {Condra > Greening} in nearly every measurable NHL way, and virtually the same can be said with Neil/Smith compared to Condra too. But I know Neil carries certain 'political' weights, so we'll leave him out of this conversation.  Condra wasn't re-signed because (according to Murray) not doing so opens the door for prospects in Bingo. It was left unsaid, but I'm sure needing to pay another player doesn't help the balance book either, especially when he will inevitably push a more expensive forwand (Greening/Smith/Neil) out of the lineup. But back to the roster space...that's great and I'm on board with that concept since Prince needs a full time spot as soon as this season, and Puempel (plus Robinson/others) likely by next year.  Out of Smith, Greening, and Condra, the latter was the most convenient to call a casualty from a logistic standpoint since his contract already expired. All these guys are firmly bottom-6 players of varying abilities, close in age, and positionally we can shuffle our other players around to fill any holes with relative ease (since so many play multiple positions). But let's say we took the opportunity to match Tampa's offer and Condra $3.75M over 3 years at $1.25Maav, we would have to move one of Greening or Smith out in order to match Murray's advantage of having 1 fewer body on the roster - so let's explore a few scenario's on that train of thought.  I maintain that trading Smith would not be challenging at all - he's a gritty depth centreman with some scoring upside, good age, and most of all his contract isn't crippling at all. Most teams would love him given the opportunity, and it wouldn't shock me if we got at least a 3rd rounder for him (but worst case a 4th/5th, like what we got for Gryba). Just because many of us are low on him doesn't mean he's useless, undesirable, or not a good player (quite the contrary, on all 3 points in fact). He has 2 years left on contract at a $1.8875M aav, and the total amount owed to him in actual salary is $4.35M. That's already more than the amount owed to Condra in his 3 year deal, which is an important point with us being a budget team. So we could have re-signed Condra AND traded Smith with the same total value but with a lower cap hit AND got a mid/late pick (or equivalent). Would most people not prefer that?  As for the other option... Greening is trickier, since we know Murray has been trying hard to trade him with no success. Colin has certainly struggled, but he's a career average possession player with size and genuinely decent scoring potential (with a half-decent centreman, at least). A new start could well re-kindle his point production to at least the ~20+ point capability he showed while away from Spezza. But presumably no one want to bite on his $2.65M/yr cap hit, and since the real value is increasing that makes it unappealing to other budget teams struggling to reach the floor that could accommodate his cap hit (eg. Arizona). Behind the scenes, Greening is owed $2.75M next year and $3.2M the year after for a total owed value of $5.95M. Murray has, for some reason, decided to rule out retaining salary or a buyout. However...  If we bought Greening out now, he would be owed $991,666/yr for 4 years, for a total value slightly below $4M. I understand how that might be unappealing to our team, but it is still less that the $6M we're going to have to pay him if we keep him. That said, we could have bought out Greening, re-signed Condra and saved $500K next year and almost $1M next year compared to our current situation. Ultimately we would pay an extra $1.77M in the long term compared to losing Condra and keeping Greening, but that might be worthwhile since the ""losses"" would come in years 3 and 4 when playoff contention (and thus playoff $$$'s) seems much more likely as our current core matures. But yes, this option would be tougher to convince management/ownership of, I'll readily admit.  As a third option, the other taboo idea is retaining salary on Greening. Let's say we want the total payout in retained salary PLUS Condra's contract to be less than or equal to $5.95M (which again, is how much we currently owe by keeping Greening and losing Condra). Rounding to the nearest 50K, assuming I didn't make a math error, if we retained a cap hit of $950K/yr of Greening's contract we would be on the line for $985K this season and $1.15M next year (in real dollars), which on top of Condra's $3.75M (over 3 years) would require us to pay out $5.88M - which to repeat myself is LESS than we're going to be paying Greening over the next two seasons AND we keep Condra/jettison Greening. Most importantly, retaining that amount of salary brings Greening's cap hit to a far more reasonable $1.70M. This is hardly a guarantee, but I think finding a home for him and his contract at that value is far FAR more reasonable. In doing so we would likely get back a late round pick or decent AHL player to help out in Bingo too.  And to add to all three above arguments, Condra's contract would be extremely easy to move if he was ever struggling or we just had better prospects needing space. Committing to Condra for 3 years would never have really been an issue for blocking our (potentially superior) prospects since another team would gladly take him  the cap hit is super low, and he adeptly plays a desirable role.  Sufficed to say, I don't agree with Murray's reasoning and I think there are numerous better options which would have helped this team be better, while still clearing 1 roster spot AND potentially helping out financially. It's too late now and it hardly ruins this team's chances of being good as the move on, but management's mishandling of this situation and the inability to realize Condra's (subtle) upside/value is disheartening and worrying."

Murray said yesterday that contract negotiations will continue with both, but that he's expecting it to go to arbitration. Presumably that means both sides are far apart on the figures. That's not surprising since Murray doesn't (yet?) feel confident in Hoffman being a top-6 guy, but he did play in that position all season and did very well (and by all statistical measures, he's a second-line forward at worst with small space to grow as he adapts to the NHL)."

OttawaSenators,3bxooi,Ubuhio,13,Fri Jul 3 00:34:23 2015 UTC,"We had too many contracts.

OttawaSenators,3bxooi,Omega613,7,Fri Jul 3 00:56:33 2015 UTC,"This is definitely the biggest reason. And to compound things even further, Wideman is effectively on the NHL roster to start the year. When we signed him, he was automatically assigned to the big team, and in order to play in Bingo he would have to pass through waivers. He won the Eddie Shore award last season (AHL Norris equivalent) and only has a $600K cap hit. Sufficed to say, it's very unlikely that he would make it through waivers unclaimed, so we're at 8 defensemen and 23 players total (which is the max).  It's plausible that Greening can be waived again to the AHL to free up 1 roster spot, but there's a contract glut however you look at it."

OttawaSenators,3bxooi,PaddleDown,2,Fri Jul 3 07:46:23 2015 UTC,"What's going on? Our team is improving is what's going on. How so? For starters, Gryba isn't a ""fairly good"" talent; he's a #6 defenceman on some teams but likely wouldn't even crack the roster of a lot of others.   Condra is a decent defensive player but would never get more than 3rd-line minutes and we have a lot of young, talented players with a lot more upside pushing for time (e.g. Puempel, Prince). Money was fine, and while the difference between 2 and 3 years doesn't seem like a big issue, it would hold back our overall development and stall us from making a real assessment of our prospects' abilities at the NHL level. We know Condra's ceiling, and it's replaceable.  Lehner was a great talent, but we needed to move a goaltender. We have two possible good talents coming up in Hogberg and O'Connor and Anderson and Hammond will be able to reliable stop pucks for this time for the foreseeable future. We got another 1st-rounder out of the deal to help build our future.  Along with Lehner we lose Legwand who was more serviceable toward the season's end but was a bloated contract for a veteran on the severe downswing of his career. By moving his contract we make space for a younger player and clear a decent amount of fairly useless cap commitment.  I don't want to see a ""real trade"" where a ""real trade"" isn't necessary. Murray's approach is patient, and sometimes patient is boring. I'm glad he hasn't made any signings or trades out of left field where they aren't needed. He's built our prospect pool, cleared space, and left it open for our youth to take over and has roster space for a trade if needed. Nothing wrong with that."

I would argue there's a short list of Sens players who might have had more pure talent than Alfredsson ... that list would include Jason Spezza, in my opinion.  Also ... there were a couple of other supremely talented players were simply fell flat because of personality and dedication issues ... I'm looking at you Yashin and Kovalev.

He doesn't have to surround himself with great players to be great, he makes everyone around him great. Not only that but he is the most misunderstood player in the league. He does it all, steals pucks, scores goals, creates plays out of nothing, throws open ice hits, limits chances in his own end (one of the best at keeping players to the outside) yet people will still tell you that he's nothing but a liability. He was downright dominant in the MTL series and it's a shame that other players on our team couldn't elevate themselves to give Karl some more games to play. Like seriously, that game 3 was one of the best performances from a d-man I've ever seen. He still gets no respect from opposing fans somehow (see: everyone's reaction to him winning his well deserved Norris) and it's just mind boggling to me. I've said it before but I'd be really interested to see how the opinion of him would change if he was a 6'3"" Canadian defenseman, because I think people would unanimously agree that he's the best. There aren't many players worth buying a ticket to see live but Karl is undoubtedly one of them, and he's only just entering his prime. Lucky us :)"

I know a lot of people don't think the Sens are an elite team. Yet it they can stay healthy and click, they'll make it far. This year was huge for the team. They knew the Habs won because they didn't play to their potential and let the series get away from them.   The Sens will win a Cup with Erik."

OttawaSenators,3buoq8,PaddleDown,3,Thu Jul 2 12:08:49 2015 UTC,"If you go to the Sens website and watch on of Murray's recent interviews (notably one from yesterday, I'm on mobile atm so tough to link) he says that negotiations with Hoffman and Chiasson are ongoing but ""likely to go to arbitration."". That sounds like proof enough for me that they've both already filed for the process."
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,Omega613,2,Thu Jul 2 14:41:38 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I'm travelling a lot at the moment and don't have the time to screen through a lot of the interviews I'd normally watch/listen to... but even if it's likely, it doesn't mean the window has officially closed."
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,PaddleDown,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:33:47 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, as an update, it turns out July 5th is the deadline for players to file for arbitration - I had incorrectly assumed that it coincided with the June30th/July 1st timeline like most free agency things.  So I must apologize, I jumped the gun a bit. Murray absolutely did say he expects them to be arbitration-bound, but you're right in noting it's not (publicly) official yet. Interestingly, I've also heard (but can't verify) that players can't be traded between filing for arbitration and their hearing near the end of the month. This means that if the Sens have any interest in trading either Hoffman or Chiasson, then they have to do so before ~July 5th (or whenever arbitration is filed) or after the arbitration hearing around a month from now. I'm interested to see if any moves are made!"
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,Omega613,2,Fri Jul 3 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that you wouldn't be able to trade a player during the arbitration process. I don't think the team has too much to fear from arbitration in either Hoffman's or Chiasson's case because of their limited NHL experience and track record. They'll both get raises, Hoffman more-so, but it likely won't be far off from what either party was bargaining toward anyways. Because of that I realistically expect the team to match for both players if they follow through with the arbitration process, as opposed to if these were players filing for arbitration with more experience and a more direct influence in their team's success (just a note, I think Hoffman's influence on the team's success is fairly evident, I'm directing that factor more toward Chiasson)."
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,PaddleDown,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:06:52 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Well it would be unlikely the ducks would even give him that offer sheet anyway. Our management is similar in that we rarely make big flashy moves like this and would prefer to draft and re-sign our homegrown talent.
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,west49ur,9,Thu Jul 2 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly doubt they would match. I wouldn't want them too, as great as Hoffman is for our team, he's not worth 4.5 million over 4 years. I would gladly take the 1st and 3rd if we are speaking hypotheticals. I am still attached to Silfverberg so lets do a reddit trade, straight up"
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,captainduck2,4,Thu Jul 2 13:14:55 2015 UTC,Gotta love those reddit trades.
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,Eazy-Eid,5,Thu Jul 2 14:30:24 2015 UTC,Not sure but why did the Ducks ditch their old unis? So much better than those new ones.
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,Chili_Palmer,3,Thu Jul 2 09:22:02 2015 UTC,Most of us feel that way to some extent. I actually prefer our new colors but the old logo was way better. I think the sens 3rd jersey is one of the best right now.
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,BottledBarf,3,Thu Jul 2 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"IIRC, it had to do with Disney selling the team. I believe they owned the logo and the likeness of the jerseys, which prompted the change. Although the Ducks currently use the old logo as shoulder patches, so perhaps things have changed, or they worked something out with Disney. Regardless, I love the old look, and if they ever went back to it, I'd buy a Ducks jersey immediately. I'd even go for something like this, with new colors but old logo."
OttawaSenators,3buoq8,canuck_11,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the sens would match, but I'm honestly not certain about that.

OttawaSenators,3brzhl,Funkativity,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"GMBM has openly said he's looking for places to send Greening.   just a few hours ago in his press conference he confirmed that there are no buyouts or trades for Greening and that's he's expecting him to ""make it hard on the coach not to play him"""
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,On_Letting_Go,25,Wed Jul 1 23:39:23 2015 UTC,Seriously everyone calm the fuck down.  A bottom 6 player does not make or break a team.  We will be fine.  (more in reference to the sens fans over at /r/hockey flipping shit over losing him)
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,Omega613,8,Wed Jul 1 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"I like him, but I think he's replaceable over a certain value. Not sure if 1.25M was enough to have him walk over, but 3 years is a long time with young guys gunning for roster spots."
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,CAPTAIN_ALLCAPS,12,Wed Jul 1 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"We'll definitely be fine, but having an excellent possession-driving bottom-6 player who earns such a small about is a rarity these days, and that's especially valuable to a budget team.   Not signing him also likely means that the team plays players who are far worse than he is. It doesn't make or break our team, but it makes it worse and we've got little else than player development making our team better than last season. I'm the first one to preach patience with the Sens current roster, but good AND cheap bottom-6 players aren't nearly as ""replaceable"" as some seem to think."

If we can't work out 1.25 for a great bottom6 how can we work out a good players contract. Ottawa is restricted by a shit cap and we are now showing it.
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,dvanha,7,Wed Jul 1 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"I love the mentality of this sub sometimes.  We sign Ryan, Mac, Meth, Stone, Zbad - all significantly better players than Condra.  Now we don't sign Condra and you're screaming internal cap and budget.  Did you ever stop to think that maybe Condra would prefer going to a team like Tampa who are one or two pieces away from a Stanley Cup?  Condra is a serviceable 3rd/4th liner.  He is not elite, and we will not miss him even remotely as much as people here think we will."

OttawaSenators,3brzhl,Omega613,2,Wed Jul 1 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think people are so upset about Condra as you're right, he is very replaceable.  People are upset, I think, that Ottawa has done nothing but sign players for bingo when the team desperately needs a top 6 forward. They traded Lehner who could have been packaged to get that forward for a draft pick. Draft day got us two amazing prospects who will be good soon but the team needs forwards now. The Sens are going to be a very good team in 3 or 4 years but they need  good forwards now who can provide veteran leadership to the young players so they develop to their full potential. The Sens just haven't done that yet and now Condra leaving is just a reminder of how Ottawa really isn't doing much to help have a decent season this year. Since a trade for a forward is unlikely I think now focus needs to shift to signing Hoffman and Chiasson."
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,walahiguy,3,Wed Jul 1 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"the team desperately needs a top 6 forward.    We really don't though. Under Cameron our goal-scoring was excellent. Over that period of ~55 games we put up 164 goals, which only trails Dallas and NYR (at 177 and 172, resp.). That's 2.9 goals-for-per-60 (rounded), which lands us at 6th most in the NHL. (All stats from war-on-ice).  Keep in mind this period includes Ryan's slump (and that of his linemates). We're already a top-10 offensive team even if the ""star power"" isn't exactly there in the top-6. Another year of development for key point-producers like Stone, Hoffman, and Zibanejad will only help. Our top-6 is woefully underrated."

OttawaSenators,3brzhl,umbraviscus,-1,Wed Jul 1 18:18:12 2015 UTC,Yes he is replaceable but that isn't the big issue here. Our internal cap has yet again forced a player out. Players as good as he was on the PK and the bottom lines are not easy to find. And no this isn't good for Prince and Puempel because they are not situated for those roles. If anything it hinders their chances and growth on this team.   If Ottawa can't work out a 1.25aav deal how the hell are we going to work out Hoffman or Chiasson.
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,peskysens,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"Only issue I have with this is Hoffman and Chiasson aren't guys that GMBM has ever had anything negative to say about contract wise. He's said he'd love to keep Condra on the team if he can start putting the puck in the net more but he's expendable. Hoffman and Chiasson are worth more than 1.25 and honestly, while Condra is a penalty killing specialist and played well on that 3rd line, we can't afford to keep him on for another 3 years. Not that we don't have the money to pay him, we don't have the time to keep him on the roster. He's late 20's (which isn't so bad, I guess) but lets face it, he's a plug and he's not going to improve anymore. Sure, maybe putting Prince or Puempel in that role isn't going to be good for them but the thing is they don't have to play the exact same game as Condra. Other guys that made Ottawa's PK memorable last season: Methot, Pageau, Borocop (when he played), Turris, Michalek, point I'm making is there are lots of guys who can play the PK. 3rd line left wing? We have Macarthur, Michalek, Hoffman, Greening, Prince, Puempel, and Condra. Who do you drop? The oldest one, with the least production, and the least appetizing contract. Either Greening or Condra. Macarther and Michalek are older, but they produce more and their contracts don't look as pluggy long-term. Just my 2 cents. Or dollar, I wrote a lot."
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,umbraviscus,0,Wed Jul 1 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"Hey man you wrote a lot but it's a good thing :)   To me this is a sign of our owner tightening up. I honestly would not be surprised to see Hoffman go to arbitration, we won't offer him a proper contract. It's going to be a negative thing.   But yes we have lots of depth. Sadly it's all sort of lacklustre depth. And I think rushing Prince or Puempel into the NHL to play on a bottom line is going to hinder them more than help.   Who knows we will see. I'm not happy Ottawa has yet to address our main issue on the blue line."
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,walahiguy,2,Wed Jul 1 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think our blue line struggles are going to be that struggle-y. We already have Erik '2 time Norris trophy winner' Karlsson (apparently that's what he goes by these days) and Marc Methot to fill the first line, and we all know how good they mix. Then you have the man the myth the legend Wiercioch really coming into his own at the end of last season, and a good training camp should get him fit for the second line. I'm not sure if I'm ready to see Ceci play that line but if we can find somebody to fit in there with Wiercioch we should be golden. After that we have a fair few players who should be ready to play, and we only really need 2. There's Cowen, Phillips, Borocop, Wideman, etcetc... But it would be nice to get some of these contracts signed."

OttawaSenators,3brzhl,JumpedAShark,4,Wed Jul 1 17:54:29 2015 UTC,It honestly seems like it's term. He wanted 3+ and Ottawa wouldn't budge past 2. Who knows.
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Wed Jul 1 17:59:27 2015 UTC,Brennan just tweeted that Sens offered him $1M AAV (a paycut for him) for 2 years.
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,peskysens,8,Wed Jul 1 18:01:38 2015 UTC,Is there anywhere that says that's the case? He just got an offer from the team in the finals. Who wouldn't wanna go there?
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,iPoop20,3,Wed Jul 1 18:47:43 2015 UTC,Most reports say Ottawa wasn't willing to do the term. So yes.  I also doubt he just left because. I'm not saying he isn't going to a better situation. Just that Ottawa dropped the ball.
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,umbraviscus,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:56:32 2015 UTC,We have to consider #TheMelnykFactor.  Cue the downvotes... :)
OttawaSenators,3brzhl,iPoop20,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:59:40 2015 UTC,Not sure why people downvote. We have an internal money struggle with Melnyk for seemingly no reason.

Very good AHL stats, should really help out in Bingo (who's roster is finally looking a lot less bare-bones). Given that D.Grant is now a UFA, I wonder if he's decided to move on and O'Dell is in essence his replacement?  If injuries get really bad at any point in the year he might also make a decent C/RW callup too."

He is 25 years old, 6', 190lbs, and is from Ottawa.  A former 2nd round pick, on paper, he has the makings of an NHL center.  With some time under Luke Richardson, there's every reason to think O'Dell could see some NHL games next year and could surprise.    Think of how AHL guys like Pageau and Hammond (and ripe and ready Chris Wideman) grew out of Ottawa's AHL development system."

OttawaSenators,3bsaye,ShittyForeplay,7,Wed Jul 1 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"Why? In Bingo we already have:  Claesson, Sdao, Harpur, Mullen, Rutkowski, and Lepine, with both Tansey and Wikstrand (rumoured) as possible additions and Wideman as a longshot if he crashes in the NHL and (consequently) passes waivers. It just doesn't even seem worthwhile from and AHL depth perspective. I guess we could push Sdao back to the ECHL, but why even bother with Kostka is that's what it takes to make space for him? Not a terrible move, but perhaps pointless.  Edit: Noticed he's a right-handed D, which probably explains it.  Edit2: I'm off my game today, commenting before doing any research, I can only apologize. I thought he was a terrible defensemen, turns out he's pretty alright actually. @MannyElk on twitter posted his Bombay chart and some statistically comparable players. No doubt that's far too flattering and heavily influenced by small sample sizes (only 70 NHL games), but he's likely a good addition in Bingo - especially when defense (not offence) dashed the baby Sens' playoff hopes last season."

He may have wanted to move on from the Sens, so unlikely we could've done much short of offering a 1-way deal, which would be pointless given our roster situation.

Binghamton) on the PK FAR too often, and we're paying him $175K and $200K per year (!!!). At that rate, just try to re-sign one of Kramer or Thompson, or find some better equivalent. Fourth line AHL grinders seriously can't be that hard to come by, can they?

OttawaSenators,3brrt8,sgtenders,-8,Wed Jul 1 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"Green, Frolik, Sekera, Sharp, Belresky are all players far better than the majority of Ottawa players in their equivalent roles. All of which were available (some still are) for prices/returns Ottawa could have afforded.   Saying Ottawa should have done nothing is silly."
OttawaSenators,3brrt8,Omega613,9,Wed Jul 1 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"Green is past his prime and declining fast, likewise with Sharp, and neither fit the timeline of the rest of our roster (Sharp also isn't a FA, he's a trade candidate). Beleskey is massively overrated and Clarkson 2.0 at $5Mx5yrs (as is his rumoured asking price). Frolik I can kind of understand, but is over valued for what he brings due to time spent on Chicago's 2013 cup run - just signed with CGY for $4.3M/yr which is on the high side for a career high ~40 point player. Besides, where would you fit him in our lineup that we don't have a similar (and much cheaper) option?  Sekera was the most enticing free agent I've seen from the Sens perspective, and he didn't come cheap for EDM ($5.5M x 6). I would likely have done that if given the opportunity, but what makes you think Ottawa wouldn't have to offer even more in order to facilitate that signing? Afterall, we don't have the lustre of having just drafted Connor McDavid.  The free agent crop is pretty bad this year, a lot of the big names were re-signed at various points during the season (eg. Methot, Ryan, MacArthur from our own team alone). If we don't make any big, stupid commitments this off-season then next year we have a few bad contracts coming off the books and another year of development/assessment for our big young players. That opens a VERY good opportunity to go out and land a big FA which meets the needs of our team (eg. a Sekera equivalent next season).  Free agency isn't always stupid, but at times it can be. And anyone we sign today means we also have to then find a way to push a body out the door. All in all, it's not as simple as ""just sign someone!"" :/"
OttawaSenators,3brrt8,Omega613,2,Wed Jul 1 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"I always love your posts. You are a solid, and researched commenter. Always appreciate your feedback.  However as with anything I don't always agree. I think Green had an off year and still can offer a hell of a performance to the team that gives him the shot. No I don't want to see him signed for 6x6AAV or anything, but paired with Weir or Ceci I believe he will be an exceptional addition. Especially when compared to a Phillips/Boro/Cowen.  To me Belesky will get overpaid, but I believe is is the kid of winger we need instead of Chiasson.   Regardless, while this FA is basically at an end, nearly. I think Ottawa has/had a chance to improve themselves here and didn't. We are hoping to much on our youth when the team is already incredibly young. We don't need a Prince to come up, we have Hoffman, Stone, Lazar, Pageau already as out youth. Some of which will probably see a decline this year as it usually is with rookies. Ottawa needs players who are good and in that Ryan/Mac age range who have years of prime ahead and can work with the youth."
OttawaSenators,3brrt8,CAPTAIN_ALLCAPS,4,Wed Jul 1 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"However as with anything I don't always agree.   You better not, that's boring ;)   I think Ottawa has/had a chance to improve themselves here and didn't.   Here's the sticking point for me. I wholeheartedly agree that we could find an upgrade somewhere in our lineup, and Green example you posted is certainly one with which I concur. However... it's my opinion that between our salary/roster issues, developmental status, and a shallow UFA crop, when have a better opportunity next year. By not spending that money this off season, we free up more salary/roster space to make a bigger splash next year. Right now, the best we could likely muster is some equivalent to Legwand.  But like I said above, it's not just about us wanting to sign player x/y/z. They also have to want to sign here, either due to the roster, future outlook, or big $$$. For all we know Murray approached Sekera with an offer, but Edmonton outbid us and/or he didn't want to play here (or not for anything less than Bobby Ryan money). We'll likely never hear one way or another though. It's just not that simple, sadly. We have a glut of bad contracts already, and an internal budget to comply with - those are just facts we have to deal with. Again though, with a few $mil off the books next season and no huge names to re-sign internally, we may at least be able to offer the ""big $$$"" incentive to a free agent who can improve our team greatly, instead of medium dollars to a mid-range gamble who will moderately improve our team this year.   No I don't want to see [Green] signed for 6x6AAV or anything   Exactly, nor do I. But that's likely the ballpark figure he wants, unless he takes a steep discount to sign with a contender (aka not for us). That's the same with most notable free agents, we're competing with 15+ other teams all driving up the price. Where do think we can pull that money from?"
OttawaSenators,3brrt8,CAPTAIN_ALLCAPS,2,Wed Jul 1 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"Belesky scored more than 9 goals once, on the top line, and he's reportedly asking for around $5m and a bit of term.

OttawaSenators,3brrt8,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"Right, but the key part here is the part where you think Ottawa is the team that should overpay him. Beleskey at a small contract, short term would be cool - maybe he'd even qualify as the 'top line player' Murray's always been interested in and let Cameron play around with LW assignments, giving insurance for a Hoffman regression or MacArthur injury or something - but so would a blowjob from the Queen. Unfortunately, neither is going to happen by the end of the day.   Beleskey's goal totals are 11, 3, 4, 8, 9, 22 (admittedly, he's never played more than 70 games in a season. On the other hand, he's never played more than 70 games in a season which is a  warning sign). His highest point total for a year in the NHL is 32. Even if he's suddenly figured out how to be a decent goal scorer what's your aim, as someone arguing for him to come to Ottawa? 12, 15?  Beleskey isn't going to sign for less than $4m, 3 or 4 years and if it's the Sens paying that we're going to be sitting here on this subreddit this time next year asking who he can be packaged with to get his deal off the table."

As for our forwards, yes we have youth who needs a shot, but we don't have youth who are going to make any big splashes for us. At least none of them have shown that they will.

Hopefully 4 top 6 forwards on the roster for the first time in a while!
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,umbraviscus,2,Wed Jul 1 18:01:19 2015 UTC,It's weird that free agency is about to open and outside of keeping Condra I feel like we're all set.
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,halsed,2,Tue Jun 30 23:25:19 2015 UTC,"Looking at that lineup's average age:    Forwards average age: 25.08 years old. 30 year old Michalek and MacArthur are the seasoned vets.    Defence average age: 25.00 years old. 30 year old Methot is 5 years older than his next closest teammates, Wideman, Boroweicki and Karlsson at 25.    Average age in goal: 30.50 years old. Anderson is 4 years older than anyone else on the team, and Hammond at 27 is still above average age for this roster.      Barring absolutely no changes to get younger(unlikely), this roster is typically considered 2 years away from it's ""prime"" age of ~27 years old.     Speaking of two years from now, goaltenders in general start to see their steepest decline in save percentage at ~36, Anderson is currently 34. Therefore, in about 2 years Ottawa will be discussing goaltending again, just as Lehner is starting to enter his prime. Everyone will be ripping into Ottawa on how they ""lost"" another goaltending trade.    (IMHO Ottawa didn't 'lose' the Lehner trade, I'm not thrilled he's gone, but its more of a ""they did what they had to do"" where Ottawa cashed in rather well)    EDIT: Source on goaltending performance with age: http://nhlnumbers.com/2012/12/10/another-look-at-how-goalies-age-can-we-correct-for-bias"
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,FixedTheNewelPost,4,Wed Jul 1 00:20:35 2015 UTC,Anderson will be the exception the that since he hasn't played a lot of hockey in his career
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,walahiguy,3,Wed Jul 1 01:03:39 2015 UTC,"It's a really good point to make - lets look at a couple active NHL goalies around Andersons age and their professional GP:    Goalie YOB GP    Anderson 1981 406   Lundqvist 1982 620   Miller 1980 604    As a further comparison, here's some stats for younger goalies than Andy:    Goalie YOB GP    Fleury 1984 595   Ward 1984 512   Lehtonen 1983 510   Price 1987 435   Quick 1986 407    It's kind of nuts to think about it: He's at least 2.4-2.6 full seasons worth of games behind Goalies his age, and well behind guys much younger than he is.

OttawaSenators,3boq8h,teletraan1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:56:07 2015 UTC,"Nah, if you start having 3 lines of appropriately producing LW's you put Hoffman on the line with Pageau and Lazar.

OttawaSenators,3boq8h,jamishthegreat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:51:08 2015 UTC,there is no team.
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,Omega613,4,Wed Jul 1 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume Condra is not on the roster for argument's sake, even though a decent chance exists that we re-sign him in the next 24-48 hours. Similarly, I guess we should assume no one is moved or brought in.  Also, and this is more of a question really, when Prince is re-signed I have this sneaking suspicion that he's not waiver exempt and that in re-signing he is automatically assigned to Ottawa's main roster. If that's the case, we would have to waive him to Bingo and there's a good chance that he's lost to another team. If I'm mistaken please correct me and tell me why (or where in the CBA) since this is certainly a worry.  Also, if Greening isn't traded somehow, I'm electing to believe he's waived to the AHL again either immediately or shortly after the season starts (thus doesn't occupy roster spot, but does eat up salary).  With all that said, here's my preferred roster based on all current assessments:    LW C RW    MacArthur Turris Stone   Hoffman Zibanejad Ryan   Prince Pageau Lazar   Michalek Smith Chiasson   - - Neil      LD RD    Methot Karlsson   Wiercioch Ceci   Borowiecki Wideman   Cowen -   Phillips -      G    Anderson   Hammond    That's all 23 available roster spots accounted for (13F, 8D, 2G). Cowen and Boro could be interchanged based on performance, and Wideman keeps that spot unless he's clearly struggling (but a good puck mover should in theory complement the physical stay-at-home style of any one of Boro/Cowen/Phillips). The bottom 6 could also be easily shuffled to try Lazar out at center:    LW C RW    Prince Pageau Michalek   Smith Lazar Chiasson    ... or something similar. Milo is on his off-wing, but he's versatile enough to adapt and hasn't looked bad there in short stints in the past.  Now if we re-sign Condra, and if I'm right about Prince's waiver situation, and if no other bodies are shipped out before the season starts... it wouldn't surprise me to see Lazar sent down to Bingo for just this season. Pretty sure he's waiver exempt, and the situation would be similar to that of Pageau - despite being a capable NHL player (at least in a depth position), it would offer better developmental opportunities and it would be necessary in order to abide with the short-term log jam of contracts. We all know Lazar would be mature enough to understand the reasoning and he would be competitive enough to really prove himself in the AHL. It wouldn't be popular with your average Sens fan, but it may be necessary and/or advantageous to him long-term development."
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,Boonedoggle,2,Tue Jun 30 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"Now that we know Condra's gone, this is looking pretty good. I'm still think that Prince could be an upgrade over Condra as a 3rd liner, despite what most people here seem to think."
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,Omega613,2,Wed Jul 1 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"Offensively, almost certain. Defensively, that's debateable and/or to-be-determined. Although if he's put with Pageau and Lazar/Milo, he'll get a lot of two way support at least. Still pretty damn unhappy about the Condra situation (more as an indictment of the Sens' ability to realize the subtle positive plays Condra/etc. add to our team, and/or where others detract from our team), but it's certainly not a make or break move by itself."
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,Boonedoggle,2,Wed Jul 1 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that roster will put up pretty good results next year. The only thing I'd really like to do before opening day is to convince someone that Cowen is worth prospects and/or picks, but that's probably a pipe dream..  Other than that I think we are set, I pray that we don't get another version of Corvo/Legwand"
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,Omega613,2,Wed Jul 1 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"On that note, I'm really unsure what's up with the Cowen situation. Murray has pushed and pushed the fact that he thinks ""Cowen is going to be a really good Dman in this league!"". Obviously, many fans don't see that happening, but that's irrelevant.  However it's almost like Murray is pushing it so much that it sounds like a sales pitch (which wouldn't be the first time he's done exactly that). But at the same time, we know Murray likes his big, physical players so all that tire-pumping might be genuine and/or in an effort to given Cowen some confidence.   But if the former, I would like to be a fly on the wall to know what Murray is asking in a trade. Surely teams have inquired, since big young dmen with his draft pedigree have value in this league (deserved or not, in Cowen's case). For me, a projected high second rounder would easily do it since Cowen and Boro seem to have similar on-ice capabilities - except that Boro is better at knowing his role (stay-at-home D, nothing fancy, punch a few faces), is a proven leader off-ice (was captain in Bingo), and costs about a third as much (salary will likely always stay low given loyalty to city)."
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,Boonedoggle,2,Wed Jul 1 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting point.. I would guess that either Murray has overly high trade expectations, or still thinks Cowen will be useful as a Senator.  No matter how bad we think he has been in Ottawa, I don't buy that there is nobody in the league who would be interested (at a fair price, at least) in a young 6'5 defenceman who was a top 10 draft selection."

OttawaSenators,3boq8h,MooseFlyer,2,Wed Jul 1 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"Only problem with your assessment is you talk about boro and Cowen being interchangeable, but they play different sides. Which means (somewhat unfortunately, I think) that it'll be Wideman that goes in and out for Cowen."
OttawaSenators,3boq8h,Omega613,2,Fri Jul 3 00:35:17 2015 UTC,"Nope, Boro and Cowen are both left handed defensemen and that's where they've played the large majority of their time in the NHL. Meanwhile Wideman is right handed. Gryba was rarely subbed out last season for that very reason, since Karlsson and Ceci are our only other right-handed defensemen in the NHL.  There was a short span last season that Boro was put on the third line on the right and could likely do the same again if called upon, but otherwise he and Cowen are both LD. I've linked their profiles above so you can verify if you wish, but I've spent more time than I care to admit to memorizing player handedness and positions played in the past. I am unsure though if Phillips has played on the right in his career though, so he may (unfortunately) be a RD candidate if that's the case."

OttawaSenators,3bmodl,Ubuhio,9,Tue Jun 30 13:41:04 2015 UTC,"I think 3 years is a bit much for Condra, as much as I like him."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,broomlad,6,Tue Jun 30 13:56:32 2015 UTC,"I think 3 years is fine in theory, but I do have an issue with it. That term would take him to the same contract year as a lot of our other key players, including Lazar, Michalek, Pageau, Greening, Smith, Zibanejad, and Cowen. I can see some of Michalek, Greening, Smith, and Cowen being gone by that point, but Lazar, Pageau, and Zibanejad will likely be due for raises if they progress as expected.  That said, I'm fine with him being on our roster for that long, and if he does well he could always be moved after 2 seasons if necessary... he's enough of a defensive player that teams would be interested in acquiring him, especially if he continues to improve (slightly perhaps) over the next couple of seasons."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,PaddleDown,2,Tue Jun 30 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the only way I'd be fine with a 3-year deal, if the long-term plan is to flip him after 2 seasons.  That would be OK for asset management I think."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,broomlad,2,Tue Jun 30 17:43:09 2015 UTC,"A player like Condra is likely not going to regress in 3 years, I'd be fine with it. His numbers have been consistent throughout his career, and I can only recall a small stretch of games where he ever played poorly."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,AutoMasta,2,Wed Jul 1 01:16:18 2015 UTC,Why?  Do you think he's going to regress?  If what we've seen the last couple of seasons is what we get I have no issue locking him up for a few years.  He has what we need.
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,Ubuhio,4,Tue Jun 30 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll necessarily regress (I don't think he can get much lower than where he is), but why lock up a player like Condra long-term when you can get what he brings at any point?  It's not like he's a top-6 forward.  I'd say two years max; you don't want him taking up a roster spot in the future because of a contract.  I doubt he'd get a NMC, so it's possible a three-year contract wouldn't be a problem down the road.  I don't know - given the priorities the team faces, I don't think Condra getting a ""long-term"" deal is one of them."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,broomlad,3,Tue Jun 30 14:14:35 2015 UTC,"-3 years is not ""long term""  -this notion that he's easily replaceable is silly, he's got a specific skill set that is hard to find in such high quality in the bottom 6 range."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,Funkativity,16,Tue Jun 30 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"he's got a specific skill set that is hard to find    A very particular set of skills; skills he's acquired over a medium-length career. Skills that make him a nightmare for people like opposing teams powerplays. If you let my penalty expire without a goal, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for points, I will not pursue your net. But if you don't, I will look for points, I will find your net, and I will... miss probably."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,dr042,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:20:35 2015 UTC,That's why I put it in quotes.  I'm not going to disagree that Condra should be re-signed; I just think that it should be max 2 years.  You don't think the Senators will be able to replace him with a cheaper / more controllable option in 2 years within the system?
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,broomlad,3,Tue Jun 30 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"I think you're undervaluing how good a possession player and pker he is. If we can snag him for 3 years on the cheap then do so, in my opinion. There'll always be a place for us to send him if we need the roster spot as long as his contract is good."
OttawaSenators,3bmodl,TrulyMagnificient,3,Tue Jun 30 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"And I think you're over-valuing him.  I guess it's all a moot point, since all we know is that he's looking for a 3-year term - nothing about dollars.  I'll wait and see what happens at this point."

OttawaSenators,3bmxjc,walahiguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:51:27 2015 UTC,He could sign an AHL only contract but any NHL team at anytime could give him a two-way deal which is what he wants.  Soooooo if Ottawa wanted him around for just in case then a 2-way is what they needed
OttawaSenators,3bmxjc,KrazyCooter,-1,Wed Jul 1 14:30:49 2015 UTC,"I can understand giving Wideman such a large. AHL salary, but this seems odd. Anyone know about his chances making the NHL roster?"

OttawaSenators,3bnfrs,broomlad,2,Tue Jun 30 17:01:30 2015 UTC,They're buying him out I thought - so potentially he could be signed for a lot less.
OttawaSenators,3bnfrs,On_Letting_Go,14,Tue Jun 30 17:21:41 2015 UTC,No  Just no
OttawaSenators,3bnfrs,mike-kt,6,Tue Jun 30 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"I would totally consider it at any amount below $3m (assuming the Sens were able to clear out Smith and Neil for starters).  Look up his Hero table, it's pretty positive.  Semin had a bad year last year, but is that an outlier or just who he is now? Over the past several years he's had really good shot generation, but the point generation hasn't been there. I'd totally be in favour of getting those shot generation skills in the lineup.  I think people see a european offensive player who doesn't get a ton of points and think nothing is going on there, or that he's 'Lazy'. Considering the amount of shots that are generated when he's on the ice, I would default to saying he's working pretty hard out there. His corsi against isn't as strong, but it looks to be better than average."
OttawaSenators,3bnfrs,iJaysus,3,Tue Jun 30 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is pretty accurate - not a bad player, as many would have you think. Great shot generation, good skilled forward that was way overpaid (not his fault) and had a bad year on a bad team. 3M would be reasonable, any front office with half a clue what they're doing will probably sign him for just above that figure short term, and will get a great deal. I see PIT as a possible destination"
OttawaSenators,3bnfrs,tornfightstrap,2,Tue Jun 30 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"Those who don't learn from history something something.  He had a bad rep, so Carolina opted to sign him to a 1 year prove me deal, he was amazing in that year, got his big contract, and now he stinks."
OttawaSenators,3bnfrs,PaddleDown,2,Tue Jun 30 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"The suggestions floating around here the past couple days are a bit ridiculous. We do not want, do not need, and should have no interest in a Hodgson or a Semin. They're overpriced for what they offer - even if they accept a discounted contract given the buyout dollars - and would take a spot from a young player with a much higher ceiling who needs icetime to develop. Let other teams take the risk and hurt their prospects' development, we don't have a need for a player like Semin."

I was getting worried that we hadn't heard anything on this subject regarding Prince (not that we would just let him go intentionally). Just good to have confirmation.  Any word on Derek Grant? Last I knew he was set to become a UFA (group IV?). He's not a high priority target, but a good and productive player to keep for Bingo and/or for injury call-ups (could likely make a good 4C/LW in the NHL too if there was roster space)."
OttawaSenators,3bk557,Omega613,5,Mon Jun 29 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"I really like Grant, he looked just fine in his short time in Ottawa (I think 2013/2014?). I hope they keep him around, he'd be a great 4th line centre."

OttawaSenators,3bk557,trendygrub,9,Mon Jun 29 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"Qualifying offers are just for RFAs. You have to give them a set minimum offer (based on their previous contract) to retain their negotiating rights, essentially. It doesn't matter whether they accept or not, it's all just part of the process. This just means that the above 4 players (all RFAs) can't just go sign with another team if they wanted. The only time you generally don't extend a qualifying offer is if you have no intention of keeping that person as part of the organization.  Condra is a UFA, so whether or not we give him an offer doesn't affect his ability to sign with another team. However, the good news on that front is this, followed shortly by this.   (I don't know if that's quite what you were asking, but otherwise it might help clarify for someone else.)"

OttawaSenators,3bic3j,iJaysus,15,Mon Jun 29 13:40:36 2015 UTC,Thaaaaaaaaank jebus.
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,MooseFlyer,9,Mon Jun 29 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"I think I'm more excited about Wideman than any other potential rookie.  The idea of him on the third pairing could really solidify our defence, maybe give some insurance to Cowen.  Putting 25+ longtime pros into the lineup is part of what has made the Red Wings so consistent."
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,BottledBarf,10,Mon Jun 29 13:55:10 2015 UTC,"All good signs this weekend.  A nice mix of some stable, dependable pics and some high upside project picks that could flourish.  Dumped some dead-weight, cleared the crease log-jam and signed stone, wideman and zibby.  Not too shabby a weekend!"
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,DrunkenMidget,6,Mon Jun 29 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with a defence corps that looks like this:   Karlsson - Methot Wiercioch - Ceci Borowiecki - Wideman Phillips   I like the toughness and team-first mentality that Boro brings to the team and he certainly isn't a liability like Gryba was. Having a mobile partner will let him perform even better in a sort of Karlsson/Methot-lite kind of pairing. Phillips is still serviceable as a 5/6 guy but I do prefer Boro and Wideman over him in basically every way. I also don't hate on Cowen as much as some and I do think he can play in the league given some injury-free consistent play time, but he's being quickly left behind by the development of our other players and he's likely best served with a fresh start somewhere else."
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,PaddleDown,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"I think we need to switch Cowen and Phillips here, and have the bottom-3 rotate so each gets 60-some games. Phillips might get 10 or 15, but have ""injuries"" that keep him away from the lineup. Hopefully he retires as a lifer next summer"
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,Jthedude17,2,Tue Jun 30 00:51:39 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with having Cowen in there as well... even if it means we end up trading him. Best case, he rebounds and has a place on this team. Second best case he plays well enough to up his value and we can move him at the deadline, let Wideman get constant games the rest of the season, and have Phillips retire as a lifer as you say. Worst case, he plays like shit and we can still likely trade him but for fewer returns."
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,PaddleDown,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on what Phillips wants. I don't care at all about any return value for Phillips, I just want to clear up our defensive log jam. I'd rather he retire than be remembered as getting traded at the end of his career"
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,Jthedude17,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I meant I'm fine with having Cowen in there even if it meant we were giving him playing time in order to find a suitor for him, not Phillips. I think Phillips would rather retire than get traded at the end of his career as well to be honest. It's a shame to have everyone dump on him as he clearly slows down and ignore all he's done for this franchise and how much of a staple he's been in our community for such a long time... it's not a situation where he's refusing to leave, he only has a limited no-movement clause (can name 10 teams to not be traded to) and if the organization wanted to move him they could likely do so. I'd love for him to play out his contract and remain a Senator, but honestly I'd love it more if he played the contract out and was able to muster another season to two elsewhere and have a shot at a Cup before coming back to town for retirement."
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,PaddleDown,13,Tue Jun 30 01:57:07 2015 UTC,I hope Wideman is given a legitimate shot to make the team out of training camp.  He's guaranteed better than Phillips and has a lot more offensive upside than Cowen.  Good signing.
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,nachochease,2,Mon Jun 29 13:58:54 2015 UTC,Phillips is no longer an NHL player. He's just gonna pick up his paycheque and then retire at the end of the year. I don't see him playing more than 30 games.

OttawaSenators,3bic3j,kenata88,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:53:22 2015 UTC,I know Cowen handles the puck like a hand grenade but I wonder if he put the work in if he could have a Burns' type switch to forward. He has decent top speed for a big guy but acceleration and pivoting seem to be an issue which is less important as a winger. I like Cowen but I agree there doesn't seem to be a place for him on D.
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,RichMilk,3,Mon Jun 29 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"he'd be even lower on the depth chart as a forward, not even top 15"

OttawaSenators,3bic3j,Fuzzumz,2,Wed Jul 1 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"Couple of things:   If Wideman is sent down to bingo he'll have to clear waivers first - and he'd almost certainly be claimed by another team.  This means if the Sens call him up he'll stay with the big club. Apparently the reason this deal got done is that Wideman's agent said he wouldn't re-sign with the Sens unless they traded a defenseman - hence Gryba was sent packing to make space. Murray has said he expects Wideman to ""play a number of games"" in the NHL this season."
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:20:48 2015 UTC,It is a two-way contract though so he doesn't need to go through waivers.
OttawaSenators,3bic3j,BigRiggety,3,Mon Jun 29 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"i don't think that's right: the two-way part only distinguishes how he's paid (one rate when he's in the NHL, another for the AHL); whether he has to clear waivers comes down to how old he is and when he signed his first contract. he signed at 22, and three seasons have gone by, so whatever exemptions he had have expired."

OttawaSenators,3bj2r0,jamishthegreat,8,Mon Jun 29 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I can get behind ""Operation Re-sign Erik Condra""... but I could get behind ""Operation Re-sign Erik Condra for $2.25M/Year or Less"". Condra is better than a typical grinder/checker, but not as versatile as defensive and faceoff specialists like Kelly or Gaustad... so I can realistically see a salary between $2-3M given salary inflation. Whether he's worth the full $3M to Ottawa is something I'm not sure about at this juncture."
OttawaSenators,3bj2r0,PaddleDown,0,Mon Jun 29 17:38:35 2015 UTC,I'd be ecstatic if we could re-sign him with something like the Greening contract. Besides can you imagine the Lazar-Pageau-Condra line for an entire season!?  foams at the mouth
OttawaSenators,3bj2r0,relapsingoncemore,5,Mon Jun 29 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"To put that into perspective, Greening makes $1.4 M more this year than Condra did last year. $2.65M/per is a little high, IMO. I'd be fine around the 2M range, but anything more he's welcome to try and get on the market. We already have 1 Greening contract, don't need another. Now if we just got rid of Greening, Condra can have that money...."
OttawaSenators,3bj2r0,mike-kt,2,Mon Jun 29 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"Condra is worth so much more than many of the depth players on the team.   There are lots of ways to find the 600k you seem to be stuck over. I'd start by trading away Greening, Cowen, Smith, Neil, Phillips or Boro. Dump any one of those players and you'll clear up the necessary space. None of those players is going to bring as much positive impact as Condra brings (and most are tradable).  I don't know what will happen, but I'll be sad if he doesn't come back because the team is anchored to the status quo"
OttawaSenators,3bj2r0,relapsingoncemore,5,Mon Jun 29 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"For this to work, one of a few things would need to happen:   Greening starts the year clearing Waivers (or getting picked up, ha!) in Bingo Chiasson takes someone elses offer sheet (but he's probably arbitration bound) Neil sees the writing on the wall and goes to a Team that's needs his depth Management feels Lazar is best off playing in Bingo next year (which, as much as the kids capable of playing NHL minutes, might not be a terrible idea - I know this can be a controversial opinion)   Otherwise, I think, in a couple of days, Condy is hitting FA and we'll end up playing him at some point in the year.   Would love to keep him, want nothing more, but we're one or two forwards too many as is (if we want to give the kids a look) and need to trade some contracts."

OttawaSenators,3bkb9z,On_Letting_Go,2,Tue Jun 30 03:40:17 2015 UTC,"He seems like a project, but has a high ceiling. The immediate issue is skating ability in an ever faster league.    Stone put in the work with Ottawa's conditioning guys to overcome his skating issues so it's possible with Hodgson too. You also have Stoner continuing to work his ass off to show how that effort pays off. If any team can turn him around I think Ottawa can do it, but it's still a risk Murray may be unwilling to take."
OttawaSenators,3bkb9z,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"He definitely seems like a project and I'd argue our own prospects have a higher ceiling and more room to grow given their ages. Would  be overpaying for an under-performing, high-risk asset that would take a spot that should be given to a younger prospect from Bingo after being freed up by the Buffalo deal."
OttawaSenators,3bkb9z,PaddleDown,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"Only way I would take him is on a two-way $550k deal.  We just don't have the room up front to allow him a roster spot, he wouldn't be able to crack our top 6 and he isn't suited for a spot in the bottom 6.  LW  Hoffman  MacArthur  Michalek  Prince  Greening  C  Turris  Zibanejad  Pageau  Smith  RW  Ryan  Stone  Lazar  Neil  Chiasson  He is a downgrade to most of the roster and doesn't fit in the places where we would be playing him in.  I would take him over Greening and Chiasson, that's about it for what we have currently."
OttawaSenators,3bkb9z,AskMeIfImAHuman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:50:43 2015 UTC,By all accounts he was so bad he stood out even on a terrible team.  No thanks.
OttawaSenators,3bkb9z,ftardontherun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:57:00 2015 UTC,talking as a vancouver fan... he is  virus in the dressing room! please dear lord dont do it
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Grizwald,21,Mon Jun 29 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"Not completely shocked. Ottawa doesn't want to overpay because they know that, realistically, he's replaceable... and Condra isn't an idiot. Generally when you go to free agency you're almost always set to make more since there can be a bidding war for even more mediocre players, and he's performed well all season in a penalty kill role. In a weak UFA class this year Condra likely has a chance to cash out as big as he might ever be able to given that he's likely a 3rd/4th-line player on any given team, especially with the attention that the Sens got nearing the end of the year with their big run. Can't blame Ottawa, can't blame Condra."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,PaddleDown,11,Mon Jun 29 14:57:53 2015 UTC,Get outta here with your logic and reason
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,valleygoat,4,Mon Jun 29 15:04:36 2015 UTC,You'd think a goat would appreciate such logic and reason.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,PaddleDown,11,Mon Jun 29 15:16:13 2015 UTC,"I'd be sad if he leaves but we have so much young talent, it's hard to be too disappointed. I'd love to see Buddy Robinson given a chance to start."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,JackTheLab,10,Mon Jun 29 15:29:10 2015 UTC,The issue is Neil will get his ice time instead.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,peskysens,2,Mon Jun 29 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"Probably (and unfortunately), but Chiasson isn't a sure thing and I think Robinson could make a play for 4th line if given the opportunity."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,JackTheLab,2,Mon Jun 29 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree 100%. I pray that Chiasson turns it around this year, we really need him to honestly for the sake of that trade lol"
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,peskysens,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"His underlying numbers weren't all that bad, and he did have hot streaks during the year. I think with better linemates and some patience he could be a decent player."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,jamishthegreat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:42:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. He got shuffled between the kid line and the Legwand ball and chain. Give him some some minutes to develop some chemistry with Lazar/JG+Hoff/Prince and he'll do fine. Besides I think the real gem of that trade is going to be Nick Paul after he's sat in Bingo for a few years.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,6,Tue Jun 30 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"Sucks because he is a fan fav. He is a good player who gives his all, and had some chemistry with Lazar. But fact is he is a bottom6 guy who isn't worth a lot. If he is looking for more than 2Mil Ottawa won't pay it, and in all honesty they shouldn't. I just really hope this isn't going to turn into more ice time for Neil."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,peskysens,2,Mon Jun 29 15:44:40 2015 UTC,You can bet on that.   Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Neil still has upside on the 4th and this might urge management to consider keeping Hoffman.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Lemondish,0,Mon Jun 29 17:06:30 2015 UTC,Neil still has upside on the 4th   wut
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,AutoMasta,2,Mon Jun 29 18:13:09 2015 UTC,Term is an issue as well I'm guessing. In all honestly he is a serviceable player that can and will be replaced in the coming years via our prospects. Sens probably don't want to do a long term deal and with his age I'm sure he's looking for some term.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Conpod,4,Mon Jun 29 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"What exactly is happening right now? Condra kinda wants to sign but would like more money? Doesn't want to play here? He's a pretty mediocre player so I don't see why he'd be giving us trouble, he's a nice fit on the team."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Ubuhio,12,Mon Jun 29 14:54:37 2015 UTC,He's probably been offered a pretty mediocre contract.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Conpod,3,Mon Jun 29 14:56:43 2015 UTC,Haha good point

OttawaSenators,3bigzu,MelvinFinklethorpe,4,Mon Jun 29 15:31:40 2015 UTC,Condra grew on me this season but honestly I don't want to overpay for him.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Stinky-pickle,4,Mon Jun 29 15:51:52 2015 UTC,He was by far my favourite player last season. I really hope we can lock him us.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Grambo92,9,Mon Jun 29 15:21:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, but if he wants too much money then slide Prince into the line-up."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,jamishthegreat,4,Mon Jun 29 15:27:46 2015 UTC,Or Robinson.
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,twist2002,2,Mon Jun 29 16:04:17 2015 UTC,FUCK ALL THOSE GUYS I WANT CONDRA

OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Grambo92,4,Mon Jun 29 19:38:28 2015 UTC,Robinson is a penalty killer and one of the best according to Richardson

OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Hoxtilicious,2,Mon Jun 29 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"How is this a mistake on Ottawa's part?   Condra wants to see how much money he can make on the open market, nothing the Sens can do about that."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,AutoMasta,-1,Mon Jun 29 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's because Ottawa has told him that there isn't any space on the team for him, which there should be, if they evaluated their players properly. Condra is a perfect 4th line player. He's a hell of a lot better than Smith and Neil, that's for sure."
OttawaSenators,3bigzu,Hoxtilicious,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:54:04 2015 UTC,"How can you be sure about that? You don't know anything about the inner workings of the organization, or what the players and management have discussed. Especially when considering recent events.

OttawaSenators,3bigzu,AutoMasta,0,Tue Jun 30 01:23:12 2015 UTC,It's a big mistake because Condra is an important player to this team. I just hope management sees that. I guess they learned nothing from that magical run we went on.
OttawaSenators,3bgij4,smashbros13,6,Mon Jun 29 00:51:35 2015 UTC,good defensive coach for the young guys. Will be interesting to see what he does with our young D men.
OttawaSenators,3bgij4,Grizwald,6,Mon Jun 29 01:26:03 2015 UTC,Will be interesting to see what he can do with Cowen. Maybe he's the guy who will turn him into a top 4 D
OttawaSenators,3bgij4,shining_,2,Mon Jun 29 02:15:44 2015 UTC,Colorado had no shortage of defensive problems but who knows if that was a personnel problem or a coaching problem. Guess we'll find out next season.
OttawaSenators,3bgij4,Grizwald,2,Mon Jun 29 05:45:20 2015 UTC,I think that was because of their lack of D and Roy's run and gun style of coaching. Tourigny was a great defensive coach in junior.
OttawaSenators,3bgij4,AskMeIfImAHuman,2,Mon Jun 29 12:22:49 2015 UTC,"From Avs defenseman Jan Hejda   I’m pretty happy to have Andre as a coach, yet at the same time, I am sad, because I feel like it came too late, I’m 36, and if he coached me 10 years ago, I would be a better player."

OttawaSenators,3bgij4,MichelangeBro,4,Mon Jun 29 13:30:22 2015 UTC,"I suppose this is Reeder's replacement? If the way the team talked about him is any indication, Andre has some big shoes to fill."
OttawaSenators,3bdn7m,canuck_11,13,Sun Jun 28 05:49:22 2015 UTC,Leave it to the Ottawa Sun to not even know that Legwand plays center and not wing.
OttawaSenators,3bdn7m,kenata88,23,Sun Jun 28 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day we traded our backup goalie for a first round pick and dumped Legwand's 3 million dollar salary to boot.  MAYBE Lehner develops into an NHL starter, but I've seen more bad games from him than good, and he's going to a team with an awfully bad defense.  At this point there's zero evidence to suggest that he's suddenly going to become an elite goaltender.  I think the Bishop trade has everyone thinking the worst."
OttawaSenators,3bdn7m,nachochease,14,Sun Jun 28 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"The bishop trade was bad, because the player we got in return was a liability. However, having watched bishop play all playoffs I think you'll find that he isn't an elite goalie. He's good, maybe really good. But I would take anderson over bishop any day.   That said, the return on that trade did not work out at all"

While he does need to work on the consistency, there was more Maclean could've done to help develop him."
OttawaSenators,3bdn7m,JumpedAShark,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:59:11 2015 UTC,The concussion was what really sealed the deal for him. Chalk it up to bad luck that he went down at the exact same time. I wish him the best of luck in Buffalo.

OttawaSenators,3bdn7m,ProblemOfficer,7,Sun Jun 28 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"There will be a day where Ottawa goes into Buffalo and can't solve Robin Lehner. He's a good goalie with a good future. It'll be super easy to just jump on that loss and say ""Oh my god, FUCK BRYAN MURRAY!!"" and regret this trade forever.    The other side of that is you can say this team used an asset to get rid of a big contract, and to re-stock the prospects pool to make the future of this organization better.     One is easier to see, and more black-and-white than the other."
OttawaSenators,3bdn7m,FixedTheNewelPost,4,Sun Jun 28 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great trade. Buffalo gets an older winger to mentor and provide a stop-gap on the side and a potential #1 goaltender, we pick up a player touted as a Bergeron-type player and shed enough salary ($5.225M + Gryba's $1.25M) to let us potentially make a splash in FA if desired or trade for that top-six forward Murray has spoken about, as well as re-sign Condra.  We can afford to spend if needed, as before the next round of contracts after 2015-16 we can still move Greening (demote or buy out) to clear space, Phillips will either retire or move on, and Neil will likely retire or move on. That leaves us with RFAs in Ceci (likely won't cash out big, the contract afterwards might be another story), and Wiercioch."
OttawaSenators,3bdn7m,PaddleDown,12,Sun Jun 28 16:19:39 2015 UTC,When does Buffalo first come to Ottawa.  Lehner deserves a standing O his first game here.  Then we should chase him

The former Senators' goalie will get to see his old pals on opening night, when the club visits the divisional-rival Buffalo Sabres at the First Niagara Center in the season opener on Oct. 8.  ""It's going to be fun,"" said Lehner. ""The guy's know my buttons and they're going to try to push them. I'm excited."""

I'd rather him as my 6/7 than Gryba. Both are serviceable in depth roles, but Phillips has an edge in experience. He'll be retired soon and open up another spot for a younger player, and if nothing else I'm sure Cameron wouldn't be opposed to having him split time with Cowen or (if another d-man is moved) a younger call-up."
OttawaSenators,3bbb3c,PaddleDown,4,Sat Jun 27 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"Probably because you skate faster than Phillips does now. And because when Philips and Neil were off the ice, the team stared to win."

OttawaSenators,3bbb3c,nwj781,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:36:27 2015 UTC,"I have doubts Wideman will re-sign with us unless we move another defenseman beforehand, since he's NHL-ready by most standards. Phillips will likely retire or move on (thinking retire) after next season and open up a permanent spot, but even then that would only leave a #7 spot open and I wouldn't blame him for cashing in elsewhere. I haven't given up on Cowen and would be interested to see him play a full season injury and (mostly) scratch-free, but I'd rather keep our other 5 D over him (I like Boro - he's serviceable, a great teammate, is fairly responsible, and will never be an expensive contract) if push comes to shove."

He's got to really improve his hockey IQ in order to be effective, and I just don't see how that's going to happen.   He's got 3 RFA years left, then he's a UFA. Are the Sens ever going to get enough value out of the rest of his RFA years to justify the cost? I'm very doubtful. What if he gets good later? bring him back as a UFA."
OttawaSenators,3bbb3c,iPoop20,2,Tue Jun 30 13:19:45 2015 UTC,"Best news of the week. I truly though t he was an absolute liability every time he was on the ice, and provided no benefits for our team"

OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,blvckhippy,29,Sat Jun 27 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"Easily the best goalie deal so far, not close. Cap dump + 1st rounder in a deep draft is a pretty damn good trade"
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,shining_,19,Sat Jun 27 15:58:35 2015 UTC,This gives me hope that GMBM will be able to find a creative solution to the Colin Greening conundrum.
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,SeveredSurvival,18,Sat Jun 27 16:27:43 2015 UTC,The goalie deals have been awful. Lehner and Legwand for a pick in this deep draft is great.
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,peskysens,13,Sat Jun 27 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"We got the better return because Lehners age and because of his contract. both other goalies have 1 year, so they are unknowns. This is the biggest factor in the return."
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,Eazy-Eid,13,Sat Jun 27 16:33:51 2015 UTC,"While the Lack deal was pretty bad for VAN, both Lack and Talbot only have a year left on their contracts. Not a fair comparison to Lehner.  That being said, I'm still very happy with the return we got."
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,iPoop20,7,Sat Jun 27 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with what we got. However, when we look back at this trade in 4-5+ years, it may have been a mistake. We got a better return not only because of Lehner's contract compared to Talbot/Lack, but also because (at least in my opinion) Lehner has a higher potential upside compared to the other two.   The keyword there is 'potential' - there's no guarantee that Lehner will become a star, but it's possible. We could end up coming out ahead on this trade quite easily. But I think that for now, it's far too early for us to say we 'won' the goalie deals this summer."
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,BaconoftheGods,3,Sat Jun 27 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"when people bring up the idea that in 4-5 year we may regret this trade becuase lehner could be a star, i just think about what if the first rounder we got for him becomes a star and Hogberg makes his way into the Nhl and becomes a top goalie in 4-5 years"
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,iPoop20,3,Sun Jun 28 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"That's also true, though that's a big 'if' :)   My point was just that we can't say we 'won' the goalie trades this summer. We won't know if we won that trade for quite a while."
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,Omega613,3,Sun Jun 28 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"Perhaps also worth noting: if Lehner becomes a star for Buffalo some day, there's no guarantee he becomes the same player for us had we kept him. Between team mates, coaching, environment, playing time, etc., there are too many factors to guarantee he would follow the same development curve. So even if he succeeds and (perhaps) White falters, it might still have be a good trade for us due to the free roster/cap space and then we don't have a failed goalie on our roster that we waited too long to develop/trade."
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,BaconoftheGods,7,Mon Jun 29 14:15:19 2015 UTC,"""#ReleasetheLehner"" makes so much more sense now."
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,Cmikhow,4,Sat Jun 27 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"As a Sabres fan let me chime in here.  We were going to draft a goalie at 21 anyways. For us we flipped that pick for a goalie much further along in his development that has a real chance of being a top 10 'tender in the league.  He's younger then the other goalies traded, he's 6'5 and GMTM loves big goalies, has a very high ceiling. Legwand while a cap dump could actually pan out for us as another mentor for our youngins alongisde Gionta.  Lastly, we are a divisional rival. We had to overpay a bit considering (I heard) Edmonton was offering 33 for Lehner. So sending Lehner to us is a big risk for you guys because if he hits his potential he will terrorize the send 6 times a year.  We need tending immediately and the way most of us fans see it is we shored up the best possible option for us and accelerated our rebuild (talbot and lack are older and would be in their early 30s when/if we are a serious contender. While Lehner will be hitting his prime as a goaltender)  It may seem like we got fleeced but I think both teams got what they needed. And as we see it Lehner is less of a risk then drafting a goaltender at 21, not to mention we'll have to wait much longer before he would be in his prime."
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,qenia,2,Sun Jun 28 19:07:43 2015 UTC,Good points. I hope Lehner does really well with you!
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,Cmikhow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:17:50 2015 UTC,Me too! Being a Sabres fan has been torture the last few years
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,Omega613,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"Just a note: most Sens fans don't think you were 'fleeced' in this deal (many suspect it's the reverse, just that the Lack/Talbot deals made us feel a bit better). That's just three-quarters of /r/hockey who looked at Lehner's stat line from last year and decided he must be terrible. When you roll in the history, draft pedigree, actual visible performanves, etc., its easy to realize his potential. And moreso, that that potential isn't far off his current level, unlike most prospects/young players that are sold on their upside.   The trade made a tonne of sense for you guys (as you noted), and relative to the market we got a good return. It's going to be hard both cheering for Lehner, and against him :p"
OttawaSenators,3bb8e7,Cmikhow,2,Mon Jun 29 14:26:24 2015 UTC,"Really good point! That's also really nice to hear! As you said a lot of fair weather fans and r/hockey have perpetuated that sentiment, good to hear from the fans who've actually watched Lehner develop."

Yeah he's got great offensive upside, but we already have the top scoring defenseman in the league.  I doubt he re-signs here, there's no room on the roster for him."
OttawaSenators,3bbne0,nachochease,6,Sun Jun 28 13:59:49 2015 UTC,EK does great defensively with his size. If Wideman can be half as good eventually then he's going to be perfect to go on the 2nd pairing. Imagine having the real EK&Methot on 1st line then the same thing on the 2nd but just not quite as good.
OttawaSenators,3bbne0,mandm4s,3,Sun Jun 28 14:24:08 2015 UTC,No room on the roster? If we put him in the lineup on starting day he'd probably challenge for time on the second pairing.

I'm not convinced I agree with him about Cowen or Greening, but I respect his commitment to those players from management's perspective. As long as the players who are playing earn their spots I'm not 100% against giving Cowen another season."
OttawaSenators,3bc2ta,zdelusion,3,Sat Jun 27 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"Really Cowen needs to be as reliable as Gryba and this team would be in a better position. Lower cap, marginally younger, greater potential and less bulky roster.   It is a little bit interesting that the GM is now forcing the coaches hand a bit more for the development of a 23 year old, Bryan made it too easy for Cowen to not see icetime last season.    The Greening thing... yeah, yikes. I mean Bryan isn't wrong, you want wingers with size and speed but Greening does not play with size nor speed these past seasons."

We was ranked ~8-9th on the Euro skaters list, which is pretty good, I figured he would be taken in the 3rd.  Then again, it might just be because our success with Swedes in recent years has made me irrationally excited to draft players coming out of Sweden. Perhaps worth noting too that Chabot grew up in Sweden ;) (<-Unconfirmed)"

OttawaSenators,3bbleo,BaconoftheGods,10,Sat Jun 27 18:04:26 2015 UTC,Neil is still serviceable as a 4th liner and Phillips as a bottom pairing.  Both bring experience to a very young team.  Both men are UFA at the end of next year.  I expect Phillips retires and Neil tests the market.
OttawaSenators,3bbleo,Ubuhio,10,Sat Jun 27 18:13:06 2015 UTC,I pray that the Sens don't go with the loyalty move and offer Neil a new contract (and Philips if we refuses to retire).

OttawaSenators,3b9c0j,Commandant1,9,Sat Jun 27 01:08:41 2015 UTC,Sounds like a much better Cowen
OttawaSenators,3b9c0j,relapsingoncemore,13,Sat Jun 27 01:16:06 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Wiercioch but with the ability to skate.
OttawaSenators,3b9c0j,JumpedAShark,5,Sat Jun 27 01:39:59 2015 UTC,Ability to skate saves Cody Ceci on a nightly basis as he works on developing his game in this league.    They've been working on Cowen's mobility for 4 years through all his injuries and to have a prospect where that isn't an issue is a huge relief. League is getting faster and faster.
OttawaSenators,3b9c0j,FixedTheNewelPost,8,Sat Jun 27 02:14:34 2015 UTC,Yep his top thing is his skating. Something Cowen can't do.

Hoping for a big year from him next season on a young team with lots of potential in 1-2 years. Strong skater with potential to be a good offensive d-man, but needs to bulk up and continue working on his defensive game.. He should continue to improve if he puts in the effort. Will likely take on a leadership role soon."

OttawaSenators,3b9dvb,FixedTheNewelPost,10,Sat Jun 27 05:52:22 2015 UTC,"I'm loving this pick. Sure there were higher guys ranked by the media, but I love the idea within the organization: Exceptional Two-way play.    If you're looking for a top-heavy exceptional skill roster (Chicago) you need top 3 draft picks and draft absolute superstars. Ottawa isn't in that position.    They are however aware that drafting Curtis Lazar, with exceptional two-way play allows you to get a guy into your lineup quickly as you can trust them in the bottom 6. Asking a #16-#25 overall pick to crack the top 6 of a roster within 3 years you need to be damn lucky.    They've taken luck out of the equation and offered the organization a better chance of seeing these players on the ice sooner. From the NHL level they can start pushing up into the top 6.    They've also seen first hand how taking size and grit in Cowen, and Wiercioch's mobility issues can be difficult in a league getting faster each season. Cowen has been working on being injury free and mobile for 4 summers now. Whereas a guy like Ceci may not be exceptional yet, but he has the pure skating ability to hold his own in the NHL and get the reps to be a consistent NHLer, from there he pushes his way up the lineup.      Very impressed tonight Ottawa. I look forward to their development."
OttawaSenators,3b9dvb,Boonedoggle,3,Sat Jun 27 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"Do you think either of them could see any games, even in pre-season? I'd like to get a feel for how they play, even if it doesn't amount to anything quite yet"

By then we're looking at a Nick Paul - Colin White - Curtis Lazar 3rd line? Sign me up for that kinda depth!  Phillips has one more year, Gryba has at least a year, but there will be a minimum 6 guys under contract for 3 more seasons until Boroweicki's is over.

OttawaSenators,3b9dvb,Ramher,7,Sat Jun 27 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"Hard to get a gauge on this guy when he was plagued with mono all last season. I heard some people way prior to the draft saying he was a top 10 talent, I guess at this point only time will tell."
OttawaSenators,3b9dvb,Conpod,3,Sat Jun 27 01:32:19 2015 UTC,A lot of people say White is better than Konecny. I know Konecny is a local guy but I trust the Sens and their scouting staff 100%.

OttawaSenators,3b9dvb,dvanha,2,Sat Jun 27 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"If he pans out, he can be the 2nd greatest White in Sens history behind Todd White."

OttawaSenators,3b9e4f,Boonedoggle,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:28:23 2015 UTC,Like how he scores in different ways. Can pick his spot off the rush( low blocker hard to stop) and he goes to the net and can finish in close. I know it's just 3 games of highlights but it is against top competition on the national level. And he can play in his own zone too.

OttawaSenators,3b9e4f,Mattpersico98,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"Not a lot to go off, but what I got from that, is that he's got a decent wrister and can finish. He'll go into a scoring position in order to finish. A bit like heatley used to do.   What I didn't see in those goals, really, was him creating plays. It was often his other teammates that created the space and got him the puck. All he had to do was be in a scoring position. Again, similarly to how heatley used to play with spezza.  Bit like you said, it was few highlights, and appeared to be all goals. Maybe he had a bunch of nice assists that didn't make the highlights because it was goals highlights.  But we still didn't see him dangle and really create the opportunity for himself to score.   We'll see. It's funny, I was hoping for better than 21st but in other threads I was saying if I were Murray I'd move lehner for a pick on a center. Hopefully it works out."

OttawaSenators,3b9d3a,Boonedoggle,0,Sat Jun 27 01:18:50 2015 UTC,"Not much to go on, looks like he has offensive vision/talent and needed to learn responsibility and accepted that and worked on it, which is good. The defensive part of the game can be taught.   He skates well apparently which is cool also, so sens look like they could be a quick team for the next while to come.   He looks like a big guy, and sounds like he could be a sort of tier 2 karlsson for us.  Hard to tell from that video, but it sounded that way to me."
OttawaSenators,3b9d3a,Akoustyk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:30:23 2015 UTC,"He reminds me a little of Ekman-Larsson. About the same size, skates well and great in the offensive zone. Even if he doesn't turn out quite as good it looks like he could be a solid player in the future."
OttawaSenators,3b9d3a,ClapBomb,0,Sat Jun 27 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"If he becomes even half the player Karlsson is, and the rest of our young defence prospects continue to develop, the Sens should be basically set on D for the rest of the decade (at the very least)."
OttawaSenators,3b8qps,FixedTheNewelPost,5,Fri Jun 26 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"To be honest, no one knows if Hammond's an NHL goalie. Goalies get really hot at random, and 21 games in the NHL is nothing"
OttawaSenators,3b8qps,go_sens,3,Sat Jun 27 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"That's my thought too, but there was no way they were going to trade Hammond.  Realistically, only Lehner could go.  If they traded Anderson, you'd end up with two unproven goalies going into next season, and there was no way that was going to happen unless something spectacular came up for Anderson.  All things considered, they've done the best of the situation and, frankly, way more than I expected.  Potentially, this draft could turn out to be great and sow the seeds for a brighter future."

If a highly ranked player falls I'd love to move up. But this is a fairly deep draft so having two 1st round picks is fine by me, especially when not all picks pan out. Today was a good day so I'm fine with whatever. We have incredible scouts and a phenomenal GM so I have the utmost faith in their decisions."

Free Agency usually sucks now. The good players get re-signed, any acceptable players left to FA get outrageous contracts. Our best bet is finding another ""hidden gem"" (i.e. MacArthur), but it's not a huge need."
OttawaSenators,3b9jso,awsomecanadian,2,Sat Jun 27 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see the Sens get one of Vincent Dunn or Bittner in the 2nd round. We definitely need to sign an FA defenceman, may need to dump some more contracts in order to do so."
OttawaSenators,3b9jso,immaperson,3,Sat Jun 27 02:45:25 2015 UTC,So we can have 2 Vince Dunn's?

OttawaSenators,3b9jso,AjentJ,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:27:06 2015 UTC,I think the big thing is for us to jettison bodies. I think we should save our money to sign our own guys and do what we can to get rid of bodies like Neil and Cowen to make room for the guys we've developed like Puempel and Claesson.
OttawaSenators,3b9jso,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Send Greening somewhere, retain 1 mill maximum.    Murray said a few times today the reason a contract needed to be shipped out with a goaltender was to comply with the ""budget"". Stupid friggen B-word we all hate. It is what it is.    Because of this I expect Ottawa to be quiet on free agents. Anyone that will make a serious impact would definitely break the B-word. It'll be interesting to see if Ottawa lets Condra go for a bottom 6 free agent, or re-sign Condra with his asking price.    Would it really be that bad to let Condra go and sign a bottom 6 free agent with similar play style but more offensive potential?    I know, I know we all love Condra. But if his asking price is ~2 mill what could Ottawa get on the market for ~3 mill? We signed MacArthur at 3.25 mill for 2 years to start."
OttawaSenators,3b9jso,BigRiggety,3,Sat Jun 27 08:54:12 2015 UTC,"Condra isn't worth 2 mil, and it would be a mistake to sign someone to the 3rd line for that much. If he can accept 1.75 or maybe 1.8 AAV, then it's worth it. Part of what made him so valuable was the chemistry he, Pageau and Lazar played with.   If we can keep that 3rd line together and keep the cost under 3.5 mil, then I think we're set. Really hoping Condra stays though"

OttawaSenators,3b74bm,blvckhippy,-4,Fri Jun 26 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"I'd settle for boedker and a d-prospect in the minors.   After 2, drafted players will need a few years before they can be everyday NHL players. With Anderson's window closing, I'd like it if we made a run in the next couple years."
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,T-ohm-y,5,Fri Jun 26 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"You would trade Hoffman, the 18th and the 21st for Boedker?"
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,blvckhippy,-1,Fri Jun 26 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"And a prospect. If Gormley or Samuelsson weren't included, I would mind a package of boedker and Dahlbeck/Melindy.   The second rounders are in the 40s so I doubt the skill level drop off is that significant."
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,T-ohm-y,3,Fri Jun 26 18:29:34 2015 UTC,Just for clarification  Hoffman+18th+21st for Boedker+Dahlbeck  Is what your proposing?
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,blvckhippy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"Am I crazy? Probably. I just think the bottom half of the draft, in the first round at least, isn't special. You could easily draft a couple quality players in the second round.  I know including Hoffman seems to be much but look at his stats to end the season, he scored 4 goals in the final 22 games, averaging around 16 mins a night. His ice time continued to trend downwards and he was relatively non-existent. Even when Stone was injured and his ice time increased he failed to do anything productive on the ice. Sure, the team wasn't great either but he was given an opportunity and wasted it.  Think about it, our magical run to the playoffs and Hoffman wasn't a major contributor. My fear is that he gets an expensive contract off the misleading 27 goals he scored that handcuffs us in the future.  Basically, I don't believe in Hoffman. His not a top-6 forward and he doesn't fit into this lineup.  Boedker is on a decent contract, going into a contract year, maybe he becomes Michalek replacement, good defensively with the ability to score 20 goals. Signs a long term deal for 3-3.5 and fills out our top-9. Don't underestimate his ability to jump into the top-6 if his game is going.  If he signed a deal comparable to Zbad's my feelings would be different. Again, I maybe crazy."
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,Jthedude17,2,Fri Jun 26 18:56:59 2015 UTC,Yeah dude that's honestly a horrible deal. No offense intended
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,T-ohm-y,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"Have to agree with you, Arizona would probably be more than happy to do a Hoffman for Boedker trade, no need to tack on two firsts for an average prospect."
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,Akoustyk,0,Fri Jun 26 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I liked Hoffman the first game I watched him skate, which was one of the first games, and I would have put him with Bobby Ryan right away, but paulrus had him on the 3rd or 4th.   Then he played real great. I think he will be good for us going forward. I think there is still a limit to how much we can pay him since he is such a rookie. So, we should be fine there.   There is no way I would trade Hoffman at this point though. I mean, I would for the right price, but that wasn't it.   For the 1st pick overall though, yes, ok."
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,Iamok2,4,Sat Jun 27 03:39:39 2015 UTC,I'd rather package 18+2nd and see how high we can go.
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,MelvinFinklethorpe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:18:26 2015 UTC,I'd try to move the 21st personally. But the 18 is probably more tempting.
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,PaddleDown,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Realistically, in this draft, probably not a lot higher. Teams would want both 1sts or one of the 1sts and multiple others. I'm also okay with just not trading either pick and grabbing two prospects."

OttawaSenators,3b74bm,bwong023,4,Fri Jun 26 14:40:29 2015 UTC,I really hope this does not happen. We can probably get a decent forward and defense prospect to fill some gaps which imo is better than one prospect.
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,ClapBomb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:06:32 2015 UTC,I personally think that we have enough prospects to warrant going for quality and not quantity. We have AHL players ready to play and we can't make it work. I would trade 2 B level prospects for one A level prospect anytime.
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,bwong023,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:42:54 2015 UTC,Good point but also would it cost too much to trade up? Just trading the 2 picks in itself may get us around #10 and throwing Hoffman in the deal like a lot of suggestions say would be expensive.
OttawaSenators,3b74bm,ClapBomb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:13:48 2015 UTC,I would trade both if the returning pick was below 10 but not higher than that. I think Hoffman would only make it worth it if it's a top 5 pick.

OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,Teratic,32,Fri Jun 26 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm the only one around here that is actually reasonably excited about this.  I worry because of the obvious points. Sending a high ceiling goalie within the division is shitty. However, I've had issues with Lehner's attitude (which could improve as time goes on), and he hasn't shown the development I would have hoped (which is in big part because of the playing time given to him).  I don't see him blossoming like bishop has, and I still feel like Anderson can carry this team for at least a season or 2 more. It's sketchy, but I'm confident he can do it, especially with Hammond and O'Connor in the fold as well to develop.  I think dropping Legwand's contract here is a really big deal. It's going to give GMBM some more room to maneuver. If you think about it as getting the 21st overall pick in a deep draft, and having a significantly improved shot at signing Hoffman and Condra, I'd say I'm pretty happy.  We'll see how this pans out, but I don't think this is as bad a trade as people are thinking. It's a shitton better than the Bishop trade, but I know you can't use that as the measuring stick...  edit: We all seem to be forgetting about Lehner's concussion. It was pretty bad. I expect he can recover, but it's a factor we shouldn't just neglect."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,X0bi1e,8,Fri Jun 26 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that the worst case scenario looks like this:  Hammond's run was a fluke and he regresses to the worst goalie in the league.  Anderson gets injured, again, and misses half the season.  O'Connor, who only had one good season with a stacked BU team in front of him, slowly collapses like a flan in a cupboard.  Lehner wins the Vezina, Norris, Hart, Stanley, Memorial, and Calder all in the same year, consumes the life essence of Phil Kessel's soft shitty body, breathes that essence into Alfie who joins him on the Sabres and begins a 100 year reign of Buffalo breaking our hearts.  This is where I feel the issue lies. This fanbase knows that the worst case scenario is likely to happen when it involves GMBM being forced to make big trades."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,Lemondish,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"Yes that's the worst case scenario, but you can't go forward expecting that's what will happen. It's also almost impossible to make forward progress without taking some sort of risk.  I just think we've been conditioned to react this way based on the whole Bishop thing. But you can't let that stop you from taking risks going forward (and this is a big risk). However, the return on this trade is quite good, much better than what we got for Bishop, which may yet work out based on how that 2nd rounder is panning out.  Look at it from another perspective too. Before Yzerman traded for Bishop, he took a stab with Lindback. They don't all turn into Vezina candidates, and I have a gut feel that Lehner will be a good starter, but not the end all and be all ppl are building him up to be."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,X0bi1e,4,Fri Jun 26 15:51:50 2015 UTC,He's 23. His development hasn't even truly started yet. Look at Carey Price. This deal sucks
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,BigRiggety,3,Fri Jun 26 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"it's a shit move brought on by a fluke finish last year. by the time the team is actually good enough to contend anderson will be retiring / 35+ and going downhill. so we'll have hammond (probably be gone, 2 year contract) who is questionable at best. and then 2 guys who have never played a second in the NHL.  so in a few years the sens will probably be relying on someone with less experience than lehner has now or shopping for a #1."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,twist2002,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Hammond is unproven (sorry, but a 1/4 season miracle run isn't enough for my faith), Andy is going to be nearing the end of his stellar effectiveness in prob 3-4 years, which leaves us with an O'Conner who will be the same age that Lehner is now by the time we need to him to replace Andy. Like, wut?  We're just going to have to go through all of this again once Andy is gone and (if) Hammond doesn't continue posting extra-terrestrial stats. This makes us worse in the long run...so GMBM better be ready to get some serious talent NOW"
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,BigRiggety,3,Fri Jun 26 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"I've been against trading Lehner (and signing Hammond) but we are where we are, now.  I think it's useless to get upset about the trade - it's happened, maybe it'll burn us down the road, or maybe it won't.  I think right now, it's not going to hurt us to trade him within the division.  Buffalo is not a team that's going to challenge Ottawa.  Lehner will give them some more wins and keep them from finishing at the bottom, but they're not going to be in the playoffs.    I think the positive sides of this trade are definitely losing Legwand's contract, and the draft pick.  In other threads I've seen that the Sens intend to move up in the draft, so arming ourselves with 2 1st round picks can't hurt.  Plus, I think it's the right move to move Hoffman while his value is high.  Others won't like it, but I'm not sure he's going to have as big a season this year."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,broomlad,2,Fri Jun 26 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"Buffalo is not a team that's going to challenge Ottawa.   Not next year, but getting Eichel and Lehner could certainly help them significantly a couple years down the road and for years after."

OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,JumpedAShark,2,Fri Jun 26 15:09:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.  However, once Hammond was signed that kind of sealed the deal on the direction the team is heading.  Unfortunately."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,broomlad,15,Fri Jun 26 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good trade but only because the team put themselves in that position. I really like Lehner, but the Sens have a chance to win now (if they fix the D) so why not keep Andy and go for it.  Also I don't care about trading within the division. Take the best return. Now a divisional rival has one less 1st round pick in a good draft, not the worst thing."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,mike-kt,4,Fri Jun 26 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"I've made some other points here, but these are all very much spot on. Trading a high-ceiling goalie within the division is rough, but you're right for sure.  I don't think we would have gotten this kind of return (and dump Legwand) from a team outside the division."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,X0bi1e,3,Fri Jun 26 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"exactly this. I'm going to miss Lehner too but, we have Hammond and O'Connor to get experience while Anderson plays his last years."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,Ramher,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:18:57 2015 UTC,the Sens have a chance to win now   What makes you say that? It took us going on a miraculous run to barely make the playoffs. We've never reached the playoffs higher than second-last seed in the last four years. Our team isn't  improved enough to jump ahead 10-15 wins and contend for a Cup any time soon.
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,JumpedAShark,3,Fri Jun 26 15:01:11 2015 UTC,Everyone (including Sens management) is putting too much stock into last year's results.  It at least gives me some optimism that they're being cautious with Hoffman.

OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,mike-kt,14,Fri Jun 26 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"Look, losing Lehner sucks. But he has as much chance of being an average goalie as he does being an elite goalie. The fact we can solve the goalie scenario + drop a big contract and still land a 1st round pick is a pretty decent scenario.   Last week we were expecting at MOST a 2nd for either goalie and no contract dump. So I feel this is a much better return. Did I want Lehner to go? No. but we all knew it was the most probable.  Let's not forget that the market is saturated with goalies and will be for a while. When Andy is aged out and if Hammond, O'Connor or otuer other prospect goalies don't pan out there is going to be lots of room for Ottawa to make a move to attain a goalie again."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,peskysens,9,Fri Jun 26 14:19:22 2015 UTC,I sense that many Sens fan are not happy about this. My sense is that this will be a great trade for you guys. I don't think Lehner is Bishop (was never sold on Lehners skills and attitude) and you can get a good prospect at 21.
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,sex_panther_by_odeon,6,Fri Jun 26 14:07:27 2015 UTC,I agree with the attitude part.  That's one thing that's always bugged the hell out of me about Lehner.

Apart from the other points I've made in this thread, I don't think we would have gotten this kind of return elsewhere.  I'm also looking at what's not part of this trade; i.e. what it allows us to do. Dropping Legwand not only removes a player who didn't perform/has a logical spot on the team, but it frees up $$. I'd be really happy with this if it meant we were able to sign Condra and/or Hoffman. Might even give GMBM the room to try something FA wise, but I'm not all that excited at the currently FA's that are available."

Dumps salary that can go to retaining players we want, frees room in our crease, lets go a player that didnt quite fit. Also, Lehner's concussion was a concern.  Downside to being inside our division is not ideal, but better Buffalo than Toronto.  Edit: Plus who knows, maybe the day isnt done yet for trades."

You're also dropping Legwand, who really doesn't have a spot on the team (no more Leggy on PP1!) and it opens up the $$ to sign Condra/Hoffman. I think on the whole it improves our team short and possibly long term. I was never totally sold on Lehner, but I can't really say which way I would have gone between trading him or Andy."

While I understand the motive behind the move, and I'm sorta happy about the first round pick, this is the exact situation that's gonna light a serious fire under Lehner's ass. After years of being told he'd be the starter relatively soon, only for us to keep committing to Andy, now he's been traded to a division rival because we don't believe in him.  He's gonna wanna kick our ass for years."

OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,SINZAR,2,Fri Jun 26 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"Here we go again! Another big move by our team and people comment more with their emotions than with their head. GMBM made the right move in the situation that developed and there is no guarantee that Lehner will amount to anything more than he already is, which is an inconsistent goalie. I'll go ahead and make a prediction for the year to come: Anderson will have an off year, Lehner will do ok and the fans will scream about how bad of a trade it was. Hammond will prove he wasn't a fluke and that he's more capable of being a backup than Lehner was."
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,bbmello,4,Fri Jun 26 19:24:39 2015 UTC,I wish Lehner all the best but holy hell is it going to be nerve wracking when we play against him. He has so much potential. I really hope we made the right decision here.
OttawaSenators,3b6wlx,JackTheLab,2,Fri Jun 26 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"If we're going to trade Lehner then it's a good deal (with Legwand), but we shouldn't trade him.

I was always a fan, but its a business so I understand.  As for Legwand, the only thing I am going to miss are the jokes my friends and I would make about his boozing."

He could easily haunt us down the road.   THAT said.. I'm glad we seem to be rolling with Andy. Many fans doom him to irrelevancy after the next season or two, but.. The next three seasons are the peak of EK65's career, and I see no reason why Andy will drop off as quickly as many would indicate.  What a couple of days!"

Given a decent team in front of him, and consistent starts with little threat of losing that role, he'd be solid.    Right up until he has a bad night and lets in a few softies.  Or somebody bumps him a little too hard.  He's got a temper, and he's young enough that it gets the better of him.

He will much more than likely be the starter for us, cant imagine Murray making this move only to sign someone else in FA in a few weeks to start him over Lehner. If he can come in and be decent to solid starter, then I will be ok with this trade. Do you think Ottawa has any plans with the pick? Or will they just use it to draft someone"
OttawaSenators,3b73c5,BradMarshTheAllstar,3,Fri Jun 26 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"Most likely they'll pair it with our #18 pick and move up.  Personally, I think Lehner has a high ceiling and needed more minutes in net to develop to where we projected him to be.  I think he'll be a great asset for the Sabres moving forward and will be at least a decent NHL starter after a while (as long as he stays healthy)."
OttawaSenators,3b73c5,nlansing,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe you guys will be in play to move up to #3 with your 2 1st's, that would be exciting!   Lehner will certainly get minutes with us, if thats what he needed then hes coming to the right place. No way GMTM makes this move only to start some FA signing. Chad Johnson is the only goalie on our NHL roster currently, so he doesnt have a Craig Anderson blocking him here.   Here's to hoping both sides get the best of this deal!"

OttawaSenators,3b73c5,mike-kt,6,Fri Jun 26 14:41:26 2015 UTC,"He hasn't developed like everybody hoped he would in Ottawa   People who think this, don't have a clue what to hope for in a 23 year old goaltender.  The dude won 30 games in 86 appearances, totally acceptable for a G as young as he is.  Tough to say if he will ever become the goalie we hoped for, but he's totally on par with his peer group."

That can be a good thing, but there's a difference between being a leader and wanting to win, and being an intimidating, unapproachable player when you don't.    I've read that OTT's dressing room is very laid back and casual.   My over-extended point is: He's a gamble."

Kane was a locker room problem also, but he's been nothing short of a great guy since he's been here (granted, he has played 0 hockey for us yet, but still) so hopefully when Lehner arrives we can curve any negative intensity into a positive.

OttawaSenators,3b73c5,PaddleDown,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think we traded him because of injury issues... the only serious problem he's had is this concussion and it's not likely to be a recurring issue given the position he plays. I think it was the right trade to make since we've clearly been stockpiling goaltending youth, but it was more of a ""protect the present, protect the future"" kind of deal, rather than ""gamble the present, protect the future"" by moving Andy."
OttawaSenators,3b73c5,InCauda,4,Fri Jun 26 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"He's better than whoever that pick will be, I'm a huge Lehner fan and you guys will soon appreciate how good of a deal this is for you guys."

We have 3 goaltenders beyond him who may be NHL capable now (Hammond) or in the future (O'Connor/Hogberg) and could draft or sign a couple more if needed before the Anderson era ends.

OttawaSenators,3b728j,Iphikratous3,3,Fri Jun 26 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's top 5, but there is a reason every scout has him top 10. He's the most likely player apart not named McDavid, Eichel, and maybe Hanifin to be able to step onto an nhl team and be able to contribute. Getzlaf was never a crazy producer in the WHL, but had a style that carried to the nhl better. Crouse is a comparable situation. (Not saying he'll turn into a getzlaf...)"
OttawaSenators,3b728j,Iphikratous3,2,Fri Jun 26 15:52:42 2015 UTC,I just feel with the depth of this draft taking a risk on Crouse could mean losing out on another highly skilled player.
OttawaSenators,3b728j,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,2,Fri Jun 26 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"That's a risk you take. Crouse is basically a lock for the NHL with projections of Lucic or better. That means 60 point seasons. Or take a guy with maybe more high end skill, but riskier to make the show. Its a balancing act, and I'm not sure I want Crouse, but I don't think I'd be too upset as long as we still had another first rounder to take a higher risk/reward player."

OttawaSenators,3b728j,BaconoftheGods,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"After that Hamilton trade, I'm questioning my ability to estimate player values, however...   I don't think that's enough for Arizona (not that it wouldn't be valuable to a different team). They have a number of good prospects and young players to start their rebuild (Gormley, Domi, Duclair, etc.), but in their whole system they largely lack the truly high end talent and star potential (OEL excluded, of course). Our picks in the 1st round are pretty late, such that the talent available is unlikely to exceed 2nd line/pairing potential (with rare exception based on development and/or high risk players), and picks are always a gamble as to whether they even reach the nhl. Someone like Strome could be their franchise #1C (a position of little depth for them) without relying on luck or surprise development curves. That's valuable for that team not only for on ice success/production, but also for putting butts in seats. It's similar logic why we gave up what we did for Ryan - except in this case the picks we would give Arizona have no guarantee to even pan out as well as the prospects sent to Anaheim.   One of the rare theoretical trades I've seen proposed that could actually be mutually beneficial is something centered around Couture + the 9th overall for the 3rd overall. Couture is a young, proven, high end forward talent (something SJS has in relative excess) and at the 9th Arizona could still pick up someone important like provorov, werenski, barzal, etc..   I think that's the sort of trade it would take to get it done, and I'm not sure we're in the position to make an equivalent offer. Then again, Hamilton... :p"

I think the ideal scenario would be to package Cowen and a first to move up a couple of spots to land Konecny if he's available.  If the Sens could move up to around the 12-13 spot Konecny would probably be available, and we'd still have our other first rounder.  Easier said than done though."

In terms of trading for pics vs players.  We're already over our roster size, so we need to shed players as much as much as we need to plan for our future.  If we're smart this year, we're trying to dump salary, open up some of our positional log-jams, and as always, trying to add assets to the prospect pool.  If we want an NHL ready player to come on, we need a few to drop off."
OttawaSenators,3b89yj,PaddleDown,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"I'm just in disbelief that Murray thinks a fwd is what we need, and not a defenseman. Yes, we have too many defense, but 4/8 of them aren't even NHL calibre. Cowen, Gryba, Borowiecki and Phillips."
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,homicidal_penguin,9,Fri Jun 26 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"I could see them moving up to 10-15ish, and taking Konecny. 18th is iffy if he'll make it that far.  I doubt we could get much higher by packaging the two first rounders in a trade, but we could entice a team with a player or second rounder and maybe get within the top-10?"
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,JumpedAShark,7,Fri Jun 26 14:27:08 2015 UTC,"I know the Konecny thing is wishful thinking. Whatever happens, I have a ton of faith in GMBM. I just really hope Condra and Hoffman get resigned now that there's an extra 4 million (I think?) In cap space."
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Omega613,5,Fri Jun 26 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"Legwand and Lehner combined for $5.225M in cap space, but more importantly $5.525M in real salary.  I'm guessing the the ~$66M mark (give or take a mil) that we were at yesterday was near our budget, so the space we cleared today likely coincides with the amount of room available. If Hoff comes in close to Stone's salary ~$3.5M (lesser player but older), then there's 2mil for Condra and Chiasson.  That's not quite enough, but if we want to sign Condra it means we also need to move another player for the roster spot (or just waive Greening again, but ignore that for now), which the cheapest realistic option is probably Gryba at $1.25M. That gives ~$3M for both players, which sounds about right. Both likely deserve in the $1.5M ballpark.  Can't be too displeased with that I reckon!"
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,mike-kt,3,Fri Jun 26 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, clearing a bit of cap and resigning 3 of the free agents has really relaxed my outlook.   I'd still really like them to deal Cowen and Gryba to free up space on defence."
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Omega613,2,Fri Jun 26 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Same, although I would say only deal Gryba if we also re-sign Wideman, otherwise we're just opening a spot for Phillips to play :/"
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,mike-kt,3,Fri Jun 26 19:05:47 2015 UTC,Yay for Wideman. I think he would resign if he saw a way to get in the lineup.   Claesson isn't a bad option either (though I'd rather AHL defenceman of the year)
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Boonedoggle,2,Fri Jun 26 19:10:37 2015 UTC,Do you think we could convince someone to take Gryba for any sort of return? Or would it be a pure cap dump?
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Omega613,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:05:42 2015 UTC,"I truly think Gryba has decent value. He skates well, has size, (a nice beard), and can play a #6D role very respectably. He's also a right hand D, which are tougher to come by. But he really needs a puck moving partner to maximize his effectiveness, in my opinion.   But what makes him so valuable is his minimal cap hit ($1.25m). It's a bit specific, but you can imagine a team like Chicago would really have appreciated him on the bottom pairing during the playoffs when injuries damaged their depth - the trick is finding a team in a similar boat this coming season, likely someone near the cap but still needing serviceable roster players to play roles.   I don't think he's immensely valuable - certainly no 2nd/1st rounders coming back. But it wouldn't shock me to see us recoup the pick/value we used to draft him. So a 3rd or 4th rounder would seem fair in my mind (or a couple lower picks, or perhaps a mid tier prospect that would start in bingo next season). But like I've said a couple times already this evening, after that Hamilton trade in questioning my value for players and/or that of some nhl GMs :p"
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Omega613,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't care if Chiasson doesn't re-sign, I just want Condra (and Hoffman of course).I think a deal coming in around 1.75-2 AAV for 2 or 3 years would be a fair deal for Condra"
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Grambo92,2,Fri Jun 26 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"Whether we care or not, Chiasson will get re-signed so that's why I'm accounting for him. He's been given a qualifying offer, so it's not as if he'll be walking.   I do agree that Chiasson has underwhelmed and Condra should be a higher priority. But in fairness to Chia, he was better than portrayed and for ~$1.25M-$1.5M we could do a lot worse for 4th line RWs. He was also saddled with playing beside Legwand & co., which wasn't exactly giving him much opportunity in the bottom-6 to succeed in that role. On top of that, our organizational depth at that position is pretty poor right now and letting NHL-caliber RFAs just walk for free is a pretty poor practice.  Then again, Condra is technically a RW and would probably do well in that spot. If he's re-signed, I could see our bottom-6 looking something like:   Michalek - Pageau - Condra Smith - Lazar - Chiasson Greening - Neil (<-Press box, and/or waive Greening to AHL)   Where a couple more roster moves might make space to give Prince/Puempel a shot at the 4th line LW next season. We could do a whole lot worse, that's for sure, so I wouldn't be too upset rolling out of camp with that lineup."
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,JumpedAShark,2,Fri Jun 26 18:05:12 2015 UTC,I would day picks in this draft are more valuable than current players on our roster.

OttawaSenators,3b72b6,blundermine,2,Fri Jun 26 14:39:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like 15-20 is skirting the ""role-player"" selections and risky picks, whereas 5-10 have very legitimate shots to be top-6/top-4 players."
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Grambo92,3,Fri Jun 26 14:55:34 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe.  Karlsson was a 15th pick though so you never know.
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,00antho,6,Fri Jun 26 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"Lets knock on the door of NJ(6), SJ(9) and COL(10) for their pick.  Three teams in need of a d-man(men).   I would propose we start with cowen(picked 9th overall in '09). Lets package him with our now 2 first rounders and see who bites.   I wouldn't give up on Ceci yet. I believe his ceiling his higher and his hockey I.Q is much greater than Cowens.   I don't want to pop bubbles but the deals possibly in place for ARI(3rd overall) has been Lucic OR Doug Hamilton. I don't think we have the pieces but hey, miracles have happened.   Thoughts and comments are welcomed."
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,dvanha,2,Fri Jun 26 14:49:14 2015 UTC,Getting AZ's 3rd pick would cost us both first round picks plus a second line forward or 2nd line defenseman...at least! Miracles can happen!

OttawaSenators,3b72b6,BootsToYourDome,2,Fri Jun 26 16:53:52 2015 UTC,Ya when you look at where some of the stars were picked you tend to think those draft picks are more valuable than they actually are. Just because Giroux was picked 22nd doesn't mean everyone picked there has his skill level. Every team can go through their history and kick themselves for passing up a future star. Taking Bryan Lee before Kopitar is the big one I always think about.

OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Omega613,3,Fri Jun 26 15:51:35 2015 UTC,The difference between 21st and 16th is not worth a 2nd and Cowen most likely. Unless Cowen has negative value
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,Jarretl9,3,Fri Jun 26 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Unless someone that the Sens are really keen on has fallen significantly to 16th, I'm not convinced the talent gap is too huge. If that situation arises though, I would imagine we either move our two 2nds for that pick, or the 21st and 48th (for example). But chances are good that one of Konecny, Svechnikov, Merkeley, Roy, etc. will be available at our 18 anyway, and another crop of worthwhile players like Ek, Boeser, Kylington, Zboril, Chabot, etc. will be on the board at 21 too. I don't think the addition of Cowen is necessary (he's overpaid, but still surely has value based on size/potential)."
OttawaSenators,3b72b6,CaptainBalkan,3,Fri Jun 26 17:13:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking just to get Cowen's salary off our books. I panicked and threw in the 2nd rounder so people wouldn't say I was trading garbage for gold

OttawaSenators,3b55l2,tornfightstrap,3,Fri Jun 26 02:22:25 2015 UTC,Karlsson was not considered elite in his scouting reports though

Scouting lists vary a lot, but I'd be surprised to hear about a team having Kylington in their top 5.  I'm guessing Karlsson went where he did because of size (or lack of).  The Ducks were going to take him at their original spot, which I think might have been 12. They traded back one spot ahead of Ottawa, thinking Karlsson would fall to them. They were right, Karlsson was going to fall to them.....until Ottawa traded up and took him at 15."

But his skill was considered elite.   Compare their stats from both the J20s, SEL, and international tournies, and you can see that he has nowhere near the offensive ability EK does. (but who does, really?)  I think he'd be a good pick, but calling someone the next Karlsson is like calling Ryan Nugent Hopkins the next Crosby - there's clearly a big step down there."

OttawaSenators,3b55l2,AskMeIfImAHuman,2,Fri Jun 26 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"I would not be happy to see us take Kylington with the 18th pick.   He has dropped off dramatically since the start of the season, which is very concerning. He was expected to go in the top 10 in the preseason rankings, but now there are scouts who don't even have him in their top 60. He is an extremely talented player, and has potential to be similar to Keith Yandle, but his hockey sense is brutal.  As of right now, he seems to play the game at the same speed as Ceci which is a huge positive, but he thinks at a similar speed to Gryba and Cowen, which is not a good thing at all. I would not be opposed to taking him with the 42nd, if he's still available, but he is already looking like a prime bust candidate if taken in the first round. Much better defenseman available at that point in the draft, such as Zboril, Chabot, Juulsen. He's not even the best Swedish defenseman available in that range after Carlsson and Larsson.  As someone who follows the draft more than the NHL, Kylington is not a first round pick. I fully expect him to be like Brian Lee.  Most accurate thing I've read about him: ""One of the best set of tools in the draft, but doesn't have the toolbox to carry them in."""

OttawaSenators,3b55l2,Relapse69,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"Some of them will probably be taken when we pick, but players I like in no order:   Travis Konecny. The kid is an engine that never stops, could play either wing or centre. He's like Pageau with a lot more offensive upside. Evgeny Svechnikov: Pretty much the typical power winger, could play in the NHL next year. Think of Pacioretty with less speed. Joel Eriksson Ek: Big, strong, and powerful, the guy is a horse that can play tough minutes. Think of a slightly less skilled Zibanejad. Jakub Zboril: A nasty two way defenseman who can play in all three zones, has potential to be a top pair but I see him being an elite #3. Think of Niklas Hjalmarsson with a mean streak. Gabriel Carlsson: Very technically sound defenseman, very good in the defensive zone, and can make a smart first pass out of the zone. I see a lot of Alex Edler in him. Nick Merkley: I would be thrilled with this pick as he is one of my favourites in the draft, explosive playmaker who has top line potential. I could easily see him becoming a Nick Backstrom like player. Colin White: Wouldn't be too thrilled with this pick, but he may end up being the BPA. Very similar to Curtis Lazar, in that he won't generate a ton of offence, but he could be one of our better defensive forwards in his rookie season. Thomas Chabot: He could be a dark horse for on of the top defenseman to come out of this draft. He also plays like Edler, but I don't think he will quite reach his ceiling. Denis Gurianov: Could be this years Tarosenko, speedy, skilled, and smart. He is a killer in the offensive zone but could improve in the defensive zone. I see him as a more offensive Chris Kreider.   There's also quite a few guys I'm hoping we could snag in the 2nd and later rounds."

OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,NotYourAssistant,20,Thu Jun 25 14:23:28 2015 UTC,and you draft Toews by being a really shitty team for years. Not really a fair comparison.

OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,NotYourAssistant,8,Thu Jun 25 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"Towes is a generational talent, not fair to compare. Turris and Zibby aren't even near their prime yet, and can easily compare to Brown/Kopitar in a year or two."
OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,TheDarkDub,-7,Thu Jun 25 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"They are not Toews though. It's not really smart to brag that we don't have any centers that other teams aren't offering top center dollars for, is the point.   Whether you drafted them or not.   But I'm good with this contract, I think it is a good contract, I hope we get a better top center also."
OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,Akoustyk,2,Thu Jun 25 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"It's not like the Sens don't have one of the best players in the world on their team anyways...   I do believe good centres are important, and I believe the two we have fit the bill. Turris has improved vastly every year he has been here. Zibby as well, and he's only 21. Elite they are not, but solid second teir they are. And looking at other teams, they are pretty good."
OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,TheDarkDub,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"Well, the point is not to be ""pretty good"" it's to ""win the stanley cup"". So, I'd rather if Turris was our second line center.   I don't think we have a stanley cup team as it stands right now. I don't think if we keep the current roster and simply let them develop, that we will have a stanley cup team either.   i believe we will have to lose some players and get some new ones. Our top line center is a place I could see improvement. I like Turris, and zibanejad is alright, but nothing incredibly special, in my view.   So, we'll see. I like a lot of the players on our team, but the goal is to build a winning team, that doesn't mean having a team that has no players that have giant faults that fans hate them for, it means building a team which all together, is greater than the others.   Like Vermette was an ok player, I didn't hate him, he can be on a team that wins a stanley cup, but in order to be on that team, he can't be on your top line.   Look at our top 6. None of them are shit. They are all pretty good, but if we are to win a stanley cup, I think we need a better top 6 than that. So, who you want to giveup? mcarthur? Stone? Ryan? Turris? zibanejad? Hoffman?   I like a lot of those players. I like Turris on my team a lot, but what i'd like to do, is keep him, and get an elite center on my top line. I would like to keep a lot of these pieces, but bump them down and drop a player from the bottom. Ideally, obviously.   But if this is not a stanley cup team, you will have to get rid of SOMEBODY."
OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,Akoustyk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:38:02 2015 UTC,You aren't getting an elite centre. And a team can win the Cup with gradual improvement over time. Look at Sedin. He won the Hart and then went to the SCF at 31.
OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,TheDarkDub,-3,Thu Jun 25 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"Uh, why not? We could get an elite center. The sedins were always franchise players."

OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,freisenburger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"You're right that Ottawa won't be seeing a Stanley Cup anytime soon. That isn't what this organization has built at this time.     The next phase of this is just to enter the top half of the league consistently, right now Ottawa is a bubble team at best.  While there are unproven forwards with potential, unproven defencemen with potential, and a mid-music game of musical chairs in goal we can be happy about saving cap on effective top 6 talent."

If that's our ""budget"" now I'd expect Ottawa to spend to the cap when the time is right. Murray has always insisted Eugene has never said no when asking him about paying for a free agent. Kovalev and Gonchar were signed as the team was heading in a downhill direction and Eugene approved of those.

OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,Boonedoggle,4,Thu Jun 25 13:35:48 2015 UTC,Keep in mind a goalie is likely coming off the books as well. Should be able to squeeze both and sign the draft class with a few mill left over.
OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this is something a lot of people seem to be forgetting. Furthermore, if you include Hoff/Chiasson/Condra, we would have 26 players signed (15F, 8D, 3G), so by necessity more than just a goalie will be off the books to meet the 23-man roster limit. Let's say Condra, Gryba, and Lehner are each made expendable this summer (just as lowest cost contracts at each position that are realistic to move), that's a minimum of ~$4.5M in space for Hoff and Chiasson (and if Condra is re-signed, then it's likely in place of Chiasson's money or another more expensive traded player like Legwand/etc.).  And that doesn't include the possiblity of Wideman or Grant, which if given 1-way deals would almost certainly be cheaper than the equivalent players they would replace.  Really not worried about our cap (league/internal), just need to find a way to move a couple bodies, and if we have to sell low on guys like Smith or Gryba I won't be too heartbroken (both a acceptable depth guys, but easily replaceable)."
OttawaSenators,3b2fh2,Omega613,3,Thu Jun 25 14:54:21 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't pay more than 3.5 for Hoff and 2 for Condra, so hopefully both will be back for well under 6.5!"

OttawaSenators,3b2fny,nachochease,3,Thu Jun 25 14:36:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, but we only saw one year out of him at the same time, and he only REALLY kicked ass toward the last half of the season. So, if I was Murray, there is no way I would give him a longer contract for that kind of money.   So, I think it is a good deal, I would give him that now, and we'll wait 3 years. Perhaps he will be worth more, perhaps less, or perhaps the same.   So, I like it, especially with the rfa in there."
OttawaSenators,3b2fny,Akoustyk,5,Thu Jun 25 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think Stone's the real deal;  he was better than a point per game in the second half and his number of takeaways was incredible.  Three years is alright though, especially at those numbers."
OttawaSenators,3b2fny,nachochease,2,Thu Jun 25 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. He was only really good at the end. It could of been the rush of playoff push, who knows. So many players in the league have had short career highs, I wouldn't trust any young talent for more than 3 years for sure, then we can make a longer term decision.  Excellent deal by Bryan."
OttawaSenators,3b2fny,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Thu Jun 25 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Stone has also battled many injuries in his young career, its a prefect timeline to see if these injuries lowered the ceiling on his long term development."

OttawaSenators,3b2fny,PaddleDown,2,Thu Jun 25 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"For his age, Lehner is showing potential to be elite. Someone on either /r/hockey or this sub posted a list of top save percentages in history for goalies at his age, and he was like, sixth on the list.  If we get Lehner traded, the our long term options are not anything we should be confident in -- they could pan out, but that doesn't mean they will."

Anderson is the better goaltender and likely will be through the next few years, but I'm not going to lose too much sleep if we move Lehner since we have the depth to either trade for an established goaltender or bank on one of our 3 guys in waiting to produce for us. I'm not really disagreeing with you on Lehner's talent, just on the fact that I'm confident in our team and our depth to fill the gap should Lehner in fact depart."

OttawaSenators,3b46zo,czekhthis,10,Thu Jun 25 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"Hoffman is one of those guys that I'd like to sign for two years at about 1.5 million and 2 million (first and second year, respectively.) Once he proves he's the real deal after two years, we can throw money at him"
OttawaSenators,3b46zo,Jthedude17,9,Thu Jun 25 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"A few things to know about the Hoffman contract.  -The Senators won't offer him a two year deal because then he'll become a UFA at the end of the deal, and they'll lose his exclusive rights on July 1st after the second year expires. Stone, Pageau, and Zibanejad all signed 2-3 year deals, and all will remain RFAs at the end of their deals.  -Hoffman has arbitration rights. Neither Stone, Pageau, or Zibanejad had arbitration rights. This means, he isn't likely to accept anything below 4 million (a guess) since if you look at comparable numbers, he is likely to get 3-4 in arbitration.  -Hoffman has until July 5th to take Ottawa to arbitration. Hoffman can sign an offer sheet with another team any time between July 1st and July 5th. So he is likely to wait until the last minute to go to arbitration in case other teams are interested in giving him what he wants via offer sheet.  -If Hoffman takes Ottawa to arbitration, they can elect to extend him to a 1 or 2 year deal at the amount set. Ottawa is likely to choose a one year deal if Hoffman takes them to arbitration, BUT the big thing is that what ever salary Hoffman is awarded (4 million as an example) will be the amount Ottawa has to qualify him at when they attempt to extend him next off season after the one year deal expires. Meaning, if he gets 4 million at arbitration, and has a bad year, Ottawa still has to pay him at least 4 million per on his next deal, whether it be one year long or 8 years long.  -Ottawa isn't likely to take Hoffman to arbitration. The only reason they might do it is if they are fearful of offer sheets and want to protect him from one. Players taken to arbitration cannot sign offer sheets. That is partially the reason why Colorado took O'Reilly to arbitration last season. The reason Ottawa isn't likely to take Hoffman to arbitration is that the person being taken to arbitration gets to select the term. Meaning, if Hoffman elects to go to arbitration, Ottawa selects the term (1 or 2 years), if Ottawa takes Hoffman to arbitration, Hoffman selects the term (1 or 2 years). Hoffman could select a two year term and Ottawa would lose his rights as a UFA in two years.  The three most likely scenarios are:   -Hoffman takes Ottawa to arbitration, Ottawa choose to take the deal on a 1 year term. Hoffman is still a restricted free agent next off season, but must be qualified at the salary he was awarded in arbitration. Meaning, if Ottawa wants to extend him beyond that year, he has to be paid at least that amount.  -Ottawa trades Hoffman's rights tomorrow  -Hoffman signs an offer sheet after July 1st, Ottawa possibly doesn't match and accepts compensation that probably starts with a first round pick."
OttawaSenators,3b46zo,tornfightstrap,3,Fri Jun 26 04:57:57 2015 UTC,"That would be nice, but that's never going to happen. I'm sure his camp is likely looking for something in the realm of $3-4mil per season, to be negotiated down to around $3mil give or take. The team would likely want to buy some UFA years, which might also be at issue."
OttawaSenators,3b46zo,PaddleDown,3,Thu Jun 25 21:16:31 2015 UTC,"exactly. He scored 26 goals. He's 25. He's not taking a prove it contract, he's too old I think. I'd do 3 million in a heart beat"
OttawaSenators,3b46zo,shallowcreek,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:19:25 2015 UTC,"I think at 3 mill per, we could probably buy some UFA years.   I mean, as much as I've long been Hoffman's biggest fan, and I know he is a good player, who is he really to turn down a 4 year, 12 million dollar deal?  If he plays well during that span, he can cash in at the age of 29 (pretty common UFA age) - if he doesn't, well, at least he made 12 million."
OttawaSenators,3b46zo,Chili_Palmer,2,Fri Jun 26 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting note. At this point, we only have $4.6M in cap space. I wonder if GMBM is feeling pressure on RFA signings and is waiting until we can move a goalie and one of Greening or Legwand before signing Hoff or Condra. I just hope Hoffman doesn't opt for an oilers offer sheet while GMBM figures everything out.   EDIT: www.generalfanager.com/teams/ottawa-senators sorry im on mobile no shortlink."
OttawaSenators,3b46zo,tornfightstrap,3,Thu Jun 25 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"We have more than 4.6 million in cap space. Robin Lehner or Craig Anderson are more than likely moved by the time I finish this post (ok, maybe not that soon). That adds between 2.2-4.2 million in cap space.  Worst case scenario, that is about 7 million. Chiasson has arbitration rights, so being liberal, he's probably a 2 million dollar player. That leaves 5 left, which should more than cover what Hoffman would be awarded in arbitration.  Condra doesn't matter in this context. From what Murray has said about the Condra situation, they want to keep him, but he will only being re-signed if Ottawa moves some of their dead weight (Legwand, Neil, Greening). The instant one of those three gets moved, that roster spot and salary likely gets devoted to Condra."

OttawaSenators,3b46zo,Hemlock94,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:01:18 2015 UTC,I don't believe he can get an offer sheet if he files for arbitration.
OttawaSenators,3b46zo,tornfightstrap,2,Thu Jun 25 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure the deadline for arbitration is July 5th. If his strategy is to file, he'll wait until the last minute to do so in order to leave himself open to offer sheets.  If the Senators elect to take him to arbitration, he cannot sign an offer sheet, but they aren't likely to do this because then Hoffman gets to choose the term, and he'd probably choose two years in order to become a UFA at the end of the deal.  If a team is sold on Hoffman, he's a very attractive offer sheet because the Senators might not be sold on him, and might be forced to accept compensation in order to avoid a long term deal that they feel might tie their hands. Who knows, maybe they match. But a team like Anaheim who has 4 million left over from Belesky walking could offer Hoffman anything up to 5.4 million and only have to give Ottawa a 1st (which most likely would be late in the round) and a third.   Would Ottawa match a 5x5 deal on Hoffman? I think the term rather than the salary might scare them off."

I'd rather trade him than risk an offer sheet, and we'd be selling pretty high on him right now (granted it'd be better if he already had a deal)."

Last year I got a game in January and a game in April.   Edit. I'm so spoiled. I grew up in Atlantic Canada dreaming of getting to go to NHL games. Now I'm sad because I might have to drive a few hours to New York or DC or Pittsburgh instead of 1 hour to Philly. The horror. I'll be ok.

OttawaSenators,3b0dlc,braken,9,Thu Jun 25 13:03:47 2015 UTC,"According to Brent Wallace, voting was:   Erik Karlsson 964  Drew Doughty 889  P.K. Subban 801   Doughty had 53 1st place votes, Karlsson 44. PK with 24.  No offense to Doughty, but I'm shocked he did as well as he did. Excellent and elite player, but offensively underwhelming by award standards with 46 points, which was 14th(!) among blueliners. Yes, he's also good defensively, but he plays for a stacked and defensive/risk-averse team, plus being partnered with a league leader in possession (Muzzin) is a big advantage (no offense to Methot). I have a sneaking suspicion that if EK and Doughty were traded today the perception of their defensive games would switch."
OttawaSenators,3b0dlc,Omega613,3,Wed Jun 24 23:42:58 2015 UTC,"I would have voted in the order their vote counts came in (although if non finalists were included, Subban would have been lower).

OttawaSenators,3b4m4t,FixedTheNewelPost,4,Thu Jun 25 22:52:59 2015 UTC,Not worried at all.
OttawaSenators,3b4m4t,canuck_11,3,Thu Jun 25 22:54:09 2015 UTC,"Worried? Hell no. We need to sign Condra (1.5-2mil), Hoffman (2.75-3mil), and Chiasson (1.25-1.5mil). I'd be surprised if we let Chiasson go after just one season (the team did trade for him as part of the deal for a reason), and Condra should not be difficult to re-sign realistically.   I can see Hoffman being traded. We can reassign Greening to Bingo (nobody picked him up free on waivers, so I doubt anyone will trade for him) to clear his cap space, we will be moving a goaltender for a pick and/or prospects who won't take up as much room, and we likely can trade Legwand if we're willing to accept a poor return (which we should do, and promote a cheaper, younger player). I can also see Gryba or Smith being moved fairly readily if a decent deal comes along (relative to their value). We have plenty of time to clear out some space and some pretty obvious ways to do it, so no, not worried whatsoever at this point."

I don't think we'll go over the cap this year, and next year the only people to re-sign is Ceci and Weircioch. As long as the organization does the right things, we'll be fine"
OttawaSenators,3b4m4t,jamishthegreat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"The team has been transparent that they won't be active in the free agent market.  Murray wanted a top 6 forward in a goalie trade, which might have been intended as a package. Cap would go out and come in.  Condra isn't being re-signed unless guys get moved out. If Legwand, and Neil are still Senators, there just isn't any room for him.  There's more than enough money to pay Hoffman, even if he elects to take the team to arbitration.  Zibanejad, Stone, and Pageau's contracts are backloaded, meaning, they make 5 million combined this season. The team has 15-20 million in unneeded contracts coming off the books over the next two seasons, so even if they fail to move guys out, they'll be fine. All the bad contracts are 1-2 years in length. This is a transitional period for the Senators salary."
OttawaSenators,3b4m4t,tornfightstrap,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:23:07 2015 UTC,"The cap isn't an issue (league or internal). There are too many players on the roster, so one way or another we will be ok.   Hoffman and Chiasson, if a deal isn't reached during July (when management finally has time to have proper contract talks with them) are headed to arbitration. That means neither can be offer-sheeted, nor can they holdout through training camp. A deal will be reached with both, no concerns there (although avoiding arbitration is always a preference). Also, now with Stone's contract as a comparable/ceiling for Hoffman and Pageau as a ballpark (likely on the low end) for Chiasson makes me confident enough in the eventual dollar values too.  If we include Hoffman and Chiasson, we have 25 players signed to likely play in the NHL (14F, 8D, 3G). By necessity, some players will have to be traded or waived (2 at minimum). If push comes to shove, I believe Lazar is waiver exempt and who cares if Greening gets waived, meanwhile a guy like Gryba or Smith would be easy enough to move in a hurry as they have value and are only good contracts. Murray seems to be actively shopping less desirable guys like Greening and Legwand from what we've heard, as well as Lehner or Andy. So all-in-all, roster space will be clear to meet the 23 man limit, but if it drags on late into summer it might just mean we have to take a lesser deal (eg. a 5th rounder instead of the desired 3rd rounder or something). Again, no worries or concerns, just nail biting and hope that the return for higher ceiling players (notably the goalie) is palatable.  You mention cap constraints, but we're at ~$66M for next season, which is about $5M below the league cap. I suspect $65M-$66M is also the ballpark figure for the internal budget Murray needs to consider (based on nothing but gut feeling and being told it was going up from last season's budget). So how are we going to sign Hoffman, Chiasson, and others? Well, the players heading out should make a sizable gap - and to reiterate, players WILL be moved one way or another because of the 23 man roster. Let's say, just as a semi-realistic example, Lehner ($2.3M) + Smith ($1.9M) + Gryba ($1.25M) are shipped out over the next month or so. Those are all pretty light contracts and cumulatively give us ~$4.5M back is cap space. If any one of those are replaced by Legwand ($3M), $Greening ($2.65M), Cowen ($3.1M), etc. then that even better - especially since some of those deals have higher dollar values than cap hits so it further benefits our team budget. But let's say Hoff gets in the neighbourhood of $3.25M/yr and Chiasson gets $1.25M - both realistic values when considering our recent RFA signings and their respective roles/abilities. That aligns nicely with the ~$4.5M (at minimum) we're almost certain to free up from the traded players.  The only area for concern to me is that I've thus far ignored Erik Condra, Chris Wideman, and Derek Grant - all of which (or at least some combo of two) I think we would be wise to retain. All these guys should be pretty cheap (<=$1.5M, maybe up to $1.75M for Condra?), but limited roster space rears it's ugly head again and I'm uncertain how the latter two feels about playing in the AHL any longer (or if they would subsequently pass through waivers unclaimed). Condra also strikes me as under-appreciated my Murray & Co., but at least we know the coaching staff has been vying for him to be re-signed. But I guess worst case scenario losing any/all these guys wouldn't ruin our season/franchise (it's not like Parise leaving NJ as a free agent, for example), it would just be questionable asset management and very unfortunate as they're all good pro hockey players.  So on the whole, really not worried about team in terms of contract and roster management. Like really, REALLY not worried. There a billion questions and possibilities that we can debate, but overall things will sort themselves out either adequately or excellently, depending on a few impending decisions."
OttawaSenators,3b4m4t,Omega613,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm less worried about being able to sign everyone and more worried about being able to bring in someone that can help out on the 2nd pairing or someone to provide a little boost to the top 6.  After signing Condra and Hoffman I feel like we're out of room unless we move more than one of Greening/Cowen/Legwand/Andy.  Also, what happens to Greenings cap hit if we buy him out?"
OttawaSenators,3b4m4t,Omega613,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:04:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see some concern in that regard. But looking at our top-6 and top-4, there's definitely room for improvement but they could also both be much, much worse. There really aren't any holes, just that we could use an upgrade here or there (either via an acquired player or through sudden developmental strides). You're probably right in saying that we don't have the room this season to make that type of acquisition, but then again the free agent and trade market this year hasn't been particularly good.  After we've cleared a few contracts this offseason, most of the remaining ""bad""/replaceable contracts that we couldn't deal will expire next summer (Neil, Phillips, Gryba, Legwand, etc.). If anything that's our best opportunity to go acquire a big name boost to our offense or defense, and it also gives us an extra year to re-evaluate (or further evaluate) notable new/promoted players like Hoff, Stone, Page, Chiasson, Wier, Ceci, Cowen(?), etc...  Per your original question, I'm not worried about having cap/roster space for a big acquisition right now since I'm not sure that it's a priority/possibility.   As for Greening, buying him out would mean that we would have to pay 2/3rds of his remaining salary (and cap hit) over double the duration. So I think it ends up something like $1M a year for 4 years, which would probably be worth it if literally no one will take him. However there are 1 or 2 very small ""windows"" in which you can waive and then buyout a player, and I think one of them is right now (until July 1st?). Since Greening is not presently on unconditional waivers right now, I believe that says the team isn't buying him out and I'm unsure when the next window opens (it might just be once a year in late June)."

OttawaSenators,3b4m4t,PaddleDown,0,Fri Jun 26 03:24:54 2015 UTC,"The only player we would legitimately need to buy out would be Greening, since we attempted to waive him but nobody picked him up. Legwand, Cowen, Gryba, Smith, Lehner/Anderson, and Hoffman all have enough value to warrant some sort of trade return - even if it's just 'future considerations' (likely at least a later-round pick for Legwand/Gryba), which would avoid having to keep part of their salaries on the books."

OttawaSenators,3az9ij,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,9,Wed Jun 24 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"Ottawa would be fine. Maybe expecting an expansion draft sooner rather than later is part of Murray's motivation for trading Lehner or Anderson right now?  Last expansion draft, teams could protect 9 forwards, 5 defensemen, and 1 goalie. Players with less than 49 NHL games are exempt.  If it happens after this season....  F: Turris, Mac, Stone, Ryan, Hoffman, Zibanejad, Pageau, Lazar, Puempel Exposed F: Chiasson, Michalek, Smith, Greening (Condra, Neil, and Legwand's contracts would have expired by this time)  D: Karlsson, Methot, Cowen, Wiercioch, Ceci Exposed D: Boro, Wideman (If re-signed) (Gryba and Phillips would be UFAs)  Protected Goalie: Anderson Unprotected Goalie: Hammond  In that scenario, depending on the deal he signs this summer an expansion team probably takes Chiasson. Michalek is the best player available, but he'd only have a year left on his deal. Boro would be a darkhorse. Hammond might be chosen, but it is hard to imagine that there won't be a Talbot type of situation where another team has a good young goalie exposed.  Teams can usually only lose one player. You can also send draft picks or other assets to an expansion team as a concession for not choosing a player. IE, team wants to take Hammond, Ottawa sends them a 5th round pick to the expansion team if they agree not to take Hammond."
OttawaSenators,3az9ij,tornfightstrap,5,Wed Jun 24 19:19:11 2015 UTC,Why would we keep Cowen over Wideman?

Have you listened to Bryan Murray's interviews/press conferences at all since the seasons end? It is very transparent where the team is with Cowen.   They'd be very careful about trading him because of how they feel about his potential, I highly highly doubt they'd give him away for free in an expansion draft.  Wideman hasn't proved anything at an NHL level. If Wideman comes in next year and outplays Cowen, then there is a discussion to be had about who to protect."

OttawaSenators,3awgp7,Omega613,5,Wed Jun 24 06:15:04 2015 UTC,"Believe so. At least according to Wikipedia:   After the 2010–11 season, Sörensen signed a two year deal with Skellefteå AIK. Sörensen played the majority of the 2011–12 hockey season with Borås HC in the Swedish tier two league HockeyAllsvenskan, on loan. The Ottawa Senators did not sign Sörensen by the 1 June 2012 deadline, leaving him free to sign with any NHL team in the future. Sörensen returned to Djurgården for the 2012–13 hockey season in early May 2012, signing on for one year.   Basically, we didn't give him an ELC from my understanding. I have no clue why, perhaps someone who has some insight into that can share."

OttawaSenators,3awoce,FoolishTurkey,29,Wed Jun 24 02:40:37 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm gonna put this out there.  For those in favour of trading Lehner (including Murray, as I presume), realize that we would be trading a 23-year old highly-touted goalie who won the AHL MVP award at 19 (three goalies in history have done that, including Patrick Roy and Carey Price), has a .914 save percentage in 86 NHL games (significantly better than most goalies can boast at that age), and has a laundry list of highlight-reel saves. Now remember that you are trading him when his value is at its absolute lowest and he's coming off a significant concussion, all the while the market is saturated with goalies teams are trying to trade, and Lehner is low on that totem pole. And for those thinking that O'Connor is a suitable replacement as ""goalie of the future,"" I ask where that assessment comes from? Lehner had plenty of scouting before being drafted and has pro experience in which he's performed admirably. O'Connor had one good year of college behind a stacked BU team.  Trading Lehner right now for the sake of trading a goalie is a mistake. Especially if the return sounds as disappointing as they're making it sound."
OttawaSenators,3awoce,JumpedAShark,6,Wed Jun 24 04:30:13 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. If we come out of this with Anderson, Hammond, and whatever peanuts we got out of Lehner, I will have very little confidence in the future of our goalie situation. I love Hammond and I am glad that he's staying with us, and Anderson has been amazing with us, but we need Lehner to develop into the player we all know he can be.  Anderson is getting old, and Hammond isn't far behind him. If we cut out Lehner, who else do we have? Driedger and O'Connor? Is anyone confident in that?  Ugh, I don't know. When it became apparent that we would be dealing one of our goalies, I was so excited to see what we could get. Now it just seems like a hassle not worth having, and a very dangerous move for our future."

OttawaSenators,3awoce,NotHallucinatingOwls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:04:38 2015 UTC,Do you propose that they should trade Anderson instead?  It's seemed painfully obvious to me from the beginning that they should have traded Hammond.  Keep Anderson around for the time being to remain competitive.  Shed him when Lehner takes over as starter.  O'Connor or anybody else then as backup.
OttawaSenators,3awoce,JumpedAShark,12,Wed Jun 24 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"In the current situation, I would trade Andy. Lehner's value is at his absolute lowest and it's an awful time to trade him. Plus, as a Lehner fanboy I still believe he's going to be really good. I really like Andy, but we're not contending for a Cup any time soon and he's not getting any younger. Let Lehner grow with the team, even if it means a year or two of hardship.  Not re-signing Hammond would've been my first choice though. I know it would seem harsh, but giving out these cheap but extended one-way contracts based on short sample sizes is becoming a problem for us (see: Borowiecki extension). Hammond was a great story, but the rest of his career is one of a middling AHL-calibre goalie. Now we're gonna lose a player who has a legitimate chance to become a long-term starter because management prefers the cheaper alternative."
OttawaSenators,3awoce,NotHallucinatingOwls,-2,Wed Jun 24 04:42:40 2015 UTC,The sens already have a starter who will start for another 6 years or more. By then Oconnor will be ready or whoever else they have. Goalies come and goalies go...Lehner will not sit on the bench

What are you talking about, he's 34 - Anderson will not be starting caliber by age 37, mark my words, and we'll be watching Ben Bishop and Robin Lehner tearing it up for other franchises because some lousy redhead with a catchy nickname played a stretch of 25 good games once."

OttawaSenators,3awoce,Funkativity,3,Wed Jun 24 13:32:57 2015 UTC,He doesn't have the track record of Lehner. Good goalies are marked by their consistency   Lehner's track record is pretty far from being consistent.   This isn't turning on Hammond   calling him 'lousy' is.   doesn't deserve unending love and money   his contract is very reasonable and there' nothing wrong with loving players on your team that did a good job.
OttawaSenators,3awoce,mike-kt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"His reasonable contract is forcing the team to trade one of their very good goalies. I think there's a huge risk there.   I don't mind the fans loving their players to no end, but the team has to be much more businesslike about this. Replaceable players shouldn't be signed for 3 years if it can be avoided. Look at the log jam on the team now. Plenty of depth players filling the roster and cap while blocking prospects."
OttawaSenators,3awoce,Chili_Palmer,2,Wed Jun 24 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"Replaceable players shouldn't be signed for 3 years if it can be avoided.    This is the money phrase. We're going to lose Condra and Lehner this offseason, and possibly (hopefully not) Weircioch, who will all go on to see tons of success elsewhere.   Why? Because we handed out generous one-way, multi-year deals to Greening, Boroweicki, Hammond, Neil, Phillips, Legwand, etc in recent years, all without really knowing at the time if we even needed those players.  Hammond will not be in the NHL in two years, Lehner will probably be starting for whoever we trade him to, and we'll be looking for another goaltender after Craig retires/declines."

I'm grateful, really, I am - but when the choice is between the guy you've been planning on making your franchise tender and developing for years, and a guy who has historically been unworthy of AHL starter, let alone NHL starter, you don't change the plan because one guy had a heater of 25 games."

Hammond is well suited as a backup.. Lehner is not, his development is stalled(and probably regressing) as long as he's not viewed as the starter.  even without Hammond in the picture, Lehner/Anderson just doesn't work and this year proved that.  Anderson is too expensive to leave him as a backup, and Lehner got his chance to compete for the starter role and proved he isn't ready.  If Lehner goes to a team that's earlier in the rebuild process, there's less pressure and he can finally develop properly as a starter."
OttawaSenators,3awoce,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"It is the choice. The team is under no obligation to move a guy with a future just because he's not the starter.   Saying this year proved that is ridiculous. McLean botched the situation early on, and then Lehner spent the second half injured.

Not only have I heard this specifically about Lehner and Anderson BOTH (and no I'm not giving you sources because why the fuck would I out my source of what little reliable insider information I have).  I have heard Andy travels alone and does not have the respect of the room.  It's obvious and you see this on the ice when the going gets rough in a way that does not happen on other teams.  Andy visibly gets upset with his team on the ice which is a big NONO.   Soft in practice.  Same with Lehner.   He is a hot head with a terrible work ethic.   That's a bad combo, if you are going to be aloof, you had better at least work hard.   It is also obvious when the going gets rough, and I think this comes from him being exposed by our nightmare defensive play.    I can see why but he is unprofessional and that's not going to make you any friends in the room.  This is also why you saw them really come together around Hammond.  That didn't just happen because of Hammond.   He united that team."
OttawaSenators,3awoce,mike-kt,2,Wed Jun 24 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that it's very possible this is the case. My attitude would be that what the team thinks of Lehner or Andy is not so important I would reduce the level of talent in the net.   The team was much better when Cameron came in, when Karlsson got a partner not named Boro or Phillips and when the lineup was optimized. Hammond played really well for about half of his starts and good enough for the other half. He also got really lucky at times.  The team was improving before Hammond came in, and then he was spectacular and got them a few extra wins. I think the coaching change was much more important than Hammond starting."
OttawaSenators,3awoce,InTURRISting,2,Wed Jun 24 15:10:24 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with the coaching/methot point.   I've been saying that for months.... but as a goalie, I completely disagree that a goalie's relationship with the team is not important.   It's critical.  edit: example, I played for a year with a team that I didn't personally gel with.  It was the absolute worst.  They treated me like garbage on and off the ice when I made a mistake.  When I was attacked by an opposing player and defended myself, no one came to help.   In fact I was given shit for taking a penalty.   The whole experience It destroyed my confidence and that sort of thing is a two way street.   I changed teams, and I didn't become a better goalie overnight.   I built a rapport with my Defensemen and team, and we won some championships.   When we make mistakes we try extra hard to cover, we protect each other, they skate back extra hard when I'm all alone.  Personal relationships on the ice, even for professionals is absolutely key.  Dischord is the enemy."
OttawaSenators,3awoce,Funkativity,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"if you look back to player comments when Hammond took over, you can tell they're trying really hard to not throw Lehner under the bus publicly... but every time they talk about how poised Hammond is, it's obvious they're stopping themselves for adding ""..as opposed to what we had before"".  after the stick breaking incident and the few previous meltdowns Lehner had.. it was pretty clear the team wasn't happy about his behaviour and attempts to embarrass them."

Maybe all these things have failed, but if they've all failed why is it Lehner who has to go and not the piles of people hired to keep him on track?

OttawaSenators,3au57w,PaddleDown,2,Tue Jun 23 16:54:10 2015 UTC,I don't think he led the whole league throughout that period of time... I might be wrong though. I think he was the top-scoring rookie and in the top 5 overall.
OttawaSenators,3au57w,MichelangeBro,3,Tue Jun 23 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"Correct, here are the top-5 from Jan 1st to the end:    Name Games Goals Assists Points    Jamie Benn 46 24 31 55   John Tavares 45 23 31 54   Alex Ovechkin 45 36 15 51   Mark Stone 46 18 29 47   Sidney Crosby 43 17 29 46    Not bad company to have! And just for interest, I checked out the comparison to fellow Calder finalists (plus fringe Calder finalists Hoff,Forsberg, and Kilngberg):    Name Games Goals Assists Points    Mark Stone 46 18 29 47   Johnny Gaudreau 42 12 21 33   Mike Hoffman 46 16 14 30   John Klingberg 46 7 22 29   Filip Forsberg 46 12 16 28   Aaron Ekbad 46 7 12 19    Of course that's selecting data to fit our own personal agenda of making Stone look great, but it's not unfair to say that the latter half of the season is most important and puts players under more pressure to perform/fail (especially for a bunch of players of teams vying for wildcard/playoff spots)."
OttawaSenators,3au57w,Omega613,2,Tue Jun 23 20:19:54 2015 UTC,"It's definitely cherry-picking stats, but holy fuck. Just look how much further ahead he was.  Overall though, he was tied for top in points, tied for second in goals (behind our own Hoffman), just behind Gaudreau in assists, and first in +/- by 5. Sure, the Jan 1st thing is cherry picked, but he has stats to still back himself up."
OttawaSenators,3au57w,MichelangeBro,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's cherry picking so much as Stone getting a chance to actually showcase his abilities during the second half. I threw his TOI stats into Excel to get a quick average, and prior to the coaching change Stone's TOI average was 14:20. After Cameron took over, his average TOI for the remainder of the season went up nearly 4 minutes per game to 18:13. I can't think it's entirely a coincidence that his points-per-game also increased from 0.44/game to 0.96/game with increased opportunity. Compare that to Gaudreau's season average TOI of 17:43 or Forsberg's 17:20, and it's pretty impressive. It did even out somewhat once Stone picked up near the last quarter as far as averages go, but he didn't have as much of an opportunity to run with it (whether he or the team was ready to is debatable, but not really my point) early on."

OttawaSenators,3an6me,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,10,Sun Jun 21 21:38:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I like the gamble. I immediately look at the latest offer sheet that wasn't matched, Dustin Penner in Edmonton after a ~ 50 point season with Anaheim, who were having cap issues (Saad had 52 points this season).    Penner was offered 4.25mill X 5years and Anaheim couldn't match. As a modern day equivalent, that was 8.44% of the cap at the time, and by todays cap that means offering Brandon Saad 6.16mill X 5 years. As for compensation, this also means Ottawa gives up a first, a second, and a third round pick.    I'm not saying Bryan Murray is Kevin Lowe retarded... but to blow a teams socks off so that they cannot match takes quite the risk.  There's something to be said about offer sheeting a team with the side benefit of handcuffing a team, like if Ottawa offered Dougie Hamilton in Boston.    This isn't really an option for Ottawa, since youth on the blueline isn't what Ottawa needs at all. However, with Boston only having 6.8 mill of cap space, offer Hamilton 5.75 mill X 5 years and Boston would really need to consider matching. Makes their extensions of Lucic/Eriksson that much more difficult. This would do everything to kill the relationship between Boston/Ottawa though, again another risk."
OttawaSenators,3an6me,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"I'd offer sheet Douggie in a heartbeat. No point in avoiding burning inter-divisional bridges.

OttawaSenators,3an6me,struckbyarhthmstick,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:46:51 2015 UTC,I'd stick to the max of a 1st and a 3rd (somewhere around $5.5m I think) compensation for an offer sheet.  I'm sure the Hawks would match but be forced to deal something else. Yost's suggestion of also going after Krueger makes a lot of sense. Force the Hawks to use their space on Saad then get Krueger for $3.2m at the cost of a 2nd.

OttawaSenators,3an6me,Hemlock94,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:00:09 2015 UTC,So true. Can't forward an offer sheet until the team's own RFAs are under contract. Sens are as at risk of an offer sheet as many other teams.
OttawaSenators,3an6me,mike-kt,6,Wed Jun 24 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I've really never watched Saad very closely, but how good is he honestly? Unsurprisingly I see a lot of Chicago fans rave about him like he's the second coming of Sharp or someone like that, which everyone does about their own young players (us included). But his point totals, for starters, don't exactly pop off the sheet (~0.6ppg for the past 3 seasons), particularly when you account for the fact that he's playing for a stacked team usually with linemates like Hossa and/or Toews. At even strength he has a CF% of ~%53.9, which sounds good but it's slightly negative relative to his team (-0.13%) and he has very favourable zone starts starting in the attacking end over 57% of the time. I know he's 22 and likely to improve (and credit to his statistical consistency over the past 2.5 seasons he's been in the league), plus he plays both PP and PK time, but again he really doesn't... ""stand out"" to me. Good player, but maybe not worth all the hassle and hype?  In order to (successfully) offer sheet him, we would have to outprice Chicago and encourage him to want to sign elsewhere (he recently stated he would be willing to take less than market value just to stay with the team). That means our offer would have to be pretty substantial. Throwing out a random number here, but I'm guessing $4M+/yr wouldn't be a stretch, which also means he'll likely expect at least than later down the line making him an expensive long term asset and increasing the draft pick compensation we would have to forfeit.  I'm just not sold on offer sheeting him under the premise of actually acquiring him - whether that's from the Sens perspective or most other teams. You could try to offer sheet him in an attempt to (further) screw over Chicago's cap management when they inevitably match, but you just don't see GMs doing that to one another."
OttawaSenators,3an6me,Omega613,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"They'd match any offer sheet, so sort of a moot idea... we'd also be giving up too much. All they do is drive the price up; if a player is good enough to receive an offer sheet, they're generally good enough for their team to match it. I wouldn't be surprised if Saad's salary is somewhere between $3.75-4.25 mil AAV, which would cost Ottawa a 1st and a 3rd in compensation... but Chicago would match that in a heartbeat."
OttawaSenators,3an6me,PaddleDown,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:07:26 2015 UTC,"Would I love it? Yes.  Will it happen? No.  Saad is going to be a Hawk, he has already stated he will take a cut to stay in Chicago, they will have him locked up before the 1st."

Subban is just a watered down offensively, more physical defensively version of Karlsson and Doughty fails to provide offense that both of these two provide.

I hate to sit and rag on Edmonton, and I totally disagree with the whole ""Edmonton ruins first overall picks"" circle jerk that everyone joins on, but I honestly think that if Yakupov wants to become a solid first/second line winger, he needs to get out of the shit-show that is the current Edmonton Oilers. With MacArthur on the first line and Michalek gone within 2-3 years, he and Hoffman can push each other to get better and take the 2LW spot.   I really would like to trade Anderson, because I really do believe in Lehner, and Anderson has high value and will soon start to get worse from age. I'm not really sure exactly how they'd play with the value on each side, but Andy + Greening + 48 for Yakupov + Edmonton's third rounder ( 94?) might be somewhat fair. I'm not great at trade values.

I really want to focus on Cowen & Lehner, since they're more likely to get traded. Leggy, eh, maybe, but not on the scale as these two.  Cowen to the Flames for a 2nd Round and maybe a potential Bottom 6 Forward prospect/member [Calgary got outhit during the Ducks-Flames series, so the physicality Cowen brings would be incredibly valuable as well as the fact he can skate and is young. So there's room for improvement]  Lehner to either Edmonton (Prospect + 2nd Round Pick in return) [Oilers lack solid goal tending. They went through what? 3 goalies this past season? Lehner, if he is willing to, could possibly fill in the position of starter and improve. Since out of the 4 goalies we have, he has suffered the most, it would be more of a fresh start for him.] or San Jose (thinking maybe a Bottom 6 Forward like Marleau, if SJ's willing to toss him. If not, just a couple of prospects or bottom 6's if they have any) [With Niemi not having his best season, that added with his age, SJ has shown interest in the Sens' goalie surplus. Therefore, if GMBM is willing to, he could manipulate this desire for a young and hopeful goalie to the point where we could strip SJ of some of its ""decent"" players or picks.]  There's probably more realistic trades, but I think these are ones that could happen."

Probably have to be something like Hoffman, Cowen and then a conditional 3rd and if O'Reilly resigns then it becomes a 2nd"
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,Hemlock94,0,Fri Jun 19 19:29:54 2015 UTC,"Would not trade Hoffman straight up for Ryan O'Reilly, one of the most overrated players out there.   Hoffman at 2-3 mill > O'Reilly at the 6 mill he is asking for.  I mean, why the fuck does everyone think he's a star? Because he got one absurd offer from a stupid GM that the avalanche decided to match? (they shouldn't have)   He's been in the league for 6 full seasons, and had a career high of 64 points. He scored 28 goals that one year, and followed it up by scoring a whopping total of 17, playing with the likes of Landeskog, Tanguay, Iginla, and MacKinnon.  He's basically Jordan Staal 2.0, I wouldn't touch him with a 10ft pole at his asking price. You think Carolina is happy they're paying J Staal 6 milly per season for a decade? Hell no. Regret city.   Shit, he's no better than Turris, and Zibby will probably be better by this coming season too. You wanna pay him 6 million to play 3rd line and score 40 points? * shudder *  Fuck Ryan O'Reilly, I hope the leafs sell the farm for him and it looks as bad as Clarkson did."
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,Chili_Palmer,4,Sat Jun 20 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"How in the world is O'Reilly overrated? He's a phenomenal two-way player that can play center or the wing. I'd happily give Hoffman and a pick for him, and if we could pawn Cowen off on them then even better."
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,Hemlock94,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:20:14 2015 UTC,"See, that word Phenomenal you used? That's how he's overrated. He doesn't deserve a word like that.   Check out my reply to my own comment above for why I don't think he's anything special."
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,CookingInTheKitchen,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"""Phenomenal two-way player"" is what I said. Ottawa has been building their team around these kind of guys. Zibanejad, Turris, MacArthur, Lazar and they all play a 200 foot game and O'Reilly fits a lot better into that than Hoffman does. When Hoffman isn't scoring he isn't contributing much else. If O'Reilly isn't scoring at least he isn't a defensive liability and he can kill penalties. Also, it's not like he's putting bad numbers. Even in a terrible year for Colorado he was a good possession player and had the same amount of points as Duchene."
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:28:23 2015 UTC,Don't need another centre right now anyway. His asking price is too high for us too

OttawaSenators,3afk9p,Chili_Palmer,5,Sat Jun 20 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"Man, you can't just throw out the raw possession numbers and call it a fair comparison. ROR plays for Colorado, Bergeron and Fisher both play for teams with much better team possession numbers. If you look at relative corsi and fenwick for last season:    Player RelCorsi RelFenwick    Patrice Bergeron 9.6 9.8   Ryan O'reilly 4.7 4.4   Kyle Turris 1.1 0.8   Mika Zibanejad 0.2 0.8   Mike Fisher -0.6 0.4    Yes, Bergeron is in another league with godlike possession stats, but ROR also puts up great numbers relative to his team. He also puts up better relative possession numbers than our top two centres.   Also, you highlighted the shots column in your post instead of corsi. If you had highlighted the right columns, it would have shown a similar relationship of Bergeron > ROR > Fisher.  TL;DR: ROR is not Bergeron, but he is still a great driver of possession on a shitty team."
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,browntown152,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"Well put, you've swung me the other way on this one.   Still hesitant to trade a good young scorer for him and pay him his sky high asking price, but at least you've validated why a lot of folks see his worth higher than I do."
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Stats aside, I think it's more in line with the teams current direction to continue to develop our young centres (Zibby, Lazar, Pageau) than to go out and break the bank on a player like ROR. If they do end up making a move I think it is more realistic to see a top 6 winger or top 4 D coming back our way."
OttawaSenators,3afk9p,Iphikratous3,0,Sat Jun 20 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Especially with two high potential guys developing in Paul and Lindberg. If we brought in a centerman, I want him to be surefire top line, and to get that we'd have to send away some big pieces, like Zibby/Hoffman/Paul/1st."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,marriedtoacanadian,18,Thu Jun 18 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"It's a 1-way contract, with an AAV of $900K. $700K next year, $1.1M the year after."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,lafonh,14,Thu Jun 18 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome value. I was expecting $1.25m-1.5m, this is less than some ELCs even, and the term is low risk while giving us time to evaluate talent for a longer extension if desired beyond the two years."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Omega613,11,Thu Jun 18 19:16:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. Considering his underlying numbers (especially compared alongside his line mates) it's better than a steal.

OttawaSenators,3abbth,TweetPoster,6,Thu Jun 18 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"Fuck ya. Glad to see him get locked up for 2 years. A little surprised at the AAV, but I'm sure he was willing to take a bit of a discount just to have a guaranteed spot"
OttawaSenators,3abbth,relapsingoncemore,6,Thu Jun 18 19:09:33 2015 UTC,"Excellent!   So, that leaves: Hoff, Z-bad, Condra, Stoner, and Chiasson with roughly 8.5-mil to work with? Obviously, it depends on the internal budget, what the cap-floor/ceiling is, and if we clear players like Legwand, Greening and/or the extra goalie situation for 2015-16 season."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,mralexjt,2,Thu Jun 18 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"That seems kind of scary to me, especially if Stone ends up winning the Calder. I have a bad feeling that we won't be able to offload as many bad contracts as we might need in order to keep all these guys."

OttawaSenators,3abbth,Akoustyk,0,Thu Jun 18 21:30:14 2015 UTC,What do you mean? The fact that it's back-loaded (although it seems silly to use that term for a two year contract)?
OttawaSenators,3abbth,MooseFlyer,0,Thu Jun 18 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"Ya, I'm not sure what the reasoning was there. maybe personal finances, but the sens i think should be well under the cap this year. There is a reason, I just don't exactly know what it is."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Akoustyk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:01:54 2015 UTC,"The reasoning is pretty obvious.  Virtually every player on the Sens' roster is getting a raise next year in real dollars, so while their cap number might seem somewhat modest their payroll is actually quite a bit higher."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Nutzillaa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:24:41 2015 UTC,I don't see why that makes it obvious. Why would make next year cost even more than this year if you don't have to?
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Akoustyk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:00:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, because next year a several veteran players will retire or won't be re-signed (ie. Phillips, Legwand).  It makes sense to pay Pageau less while those guys are still on the books in order to keep costs down.  Once those guys leave the Sens can give him a raise without having to increase the payroll."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Nutzillaa,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:05:59 2015 UTC,That makes sense.
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Akoustyk,0,Fri Jun 19 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"Doesn't affect the cap.   You said AAV, but that's not the right term. That's the average annual value, which is the average of the two seasons, so $900K. You're referring to the salary each year. Which doesn't affect the cap - the cap hit is the AAV, not the salary."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,MooseFlyer,-1,Thu Jun 18 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. So, for some reason, Senators Organization won't actually give Pageau as much money on the first year as thge second year, which may have to do with club finances, but it's still curious to me. Thanks for clarifying that though."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Akoustyk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"it's pretty common, young players get back loaded contracts, older players get front loaded ones."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Funkativity,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:12:23 2015 UTC,"Usually it is for longer term contracts for strong players though.  I think usually the front loaded contracts on old players is so if the club cuts them loose early, then the player gets the bigger chunk of change  first and club doesn't have so much left to pay a retired player on the books.   But a strong younger player will get a back loaded one, so that if they get an injury, or something happens, the club will be able to make greater savings in a buyout situation. If it was front loaded, then the club would have already paid them most of their contract.   That was always my understating. This one though I'm confused about.  It's like maybe they are gearing him up to be moved to another club at trade deadline next year? One with a little extra money, but less cap?  Or to buy him out after one year? Idk, seems odd to me."
OttawaSenators,3abbth,Akoustyk,0,Fri Jun 19 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it's a little odd."
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,TheKandyCinema,18,Fri Jun 19 04:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think the difference between your thinking and Bryan Murray's thinking is you think the team is still in ""rebuild mode"" and Bryan Murray thinks the team is in ""ready to compete mode"".  It sounds like Bryan Murray's thinking is as follows ...   Craig Anderson is an established #1 goalie and he's the Senators best shot at success over the next two or three years. Andrew Hammond has demonstrated he can be a reliable backup. Matt O'Connor is the goalie of the future who can take over in two or three years when Anderson is done.   That makes Robin Lehner a tradable asset who can be used to acquire a valuable top six forward."
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,whitejag,3,Fri Jun 19 12:36:42 2015 UTC,The problem with trading Lehner is I have a feeling he's going to be good somewhere else and we'll have a retired Anderson. Worst case scenario is that O'Connor ends up being a bust.   Sorry for all the pessimism but I gotta be realistic. I do think Ottawa is a low seed playoff team though.
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,whitejag,4,Fri Jun 19 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I also think that's why we have to get what Murray is looking for in return, a young forward long term potential to be an impact top six forward.  Ideally you want to see a kind of Methot for Foligno deal where both teams get what they need."
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,NotHallucinatingOwls,0,Fri Jun 19 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"Well right now it looks like Oconnor has just as much upside as Lenner. So Oconnor could bust but so could Lehner. Whoever is traded between Andy and Lehner, you don't worry about what they will do on another team"
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,JumpedAShark,5,Sat Jun 20 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"It's weird, I've heard conflicting reports about how much value we can get from him right now compared to Andy. Some people think Lehner would net us more in a trade because he's young and has a lot of upside, while others think Andy has more because of Lehner's recent struggles and concussion (and other factors).  The main benefit I'm guessing most people see is that we'll get some sort of return on a goalie who is ""unproven."" While I have my own thoughts about how he'll end up, Lehner is still a question mark, and I know a lot of people think we should sell him while he's still got some stock left.  Beyond that, it's mostly a case of freeing up the logjam in the net and running with Andy as our undisputed #1."
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,PaddleDown,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:02:52 2015 UTC,"I think the general consensus is that both could fetch fairly equal values, but the teams interested will differ. Teams like Buffalo would have an eye toward Lehner whereas a San Jose might want Anderson. I would tend to give Lehner an edge in value, but a lot of the teams that would be interested in Lehner might also not have that ready-made top 6F the team is looking for (except Edmonton maybe)."
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,Omega613,9,Fri Jun 19 14:30:46 2015 UTC,"I'm in the ""keep Lehner"" camp, but to answer your question as closely as I can:   Lehner may not pan out to be a good goalie, but right now his prospect status leaves than as a complete unknown. All that is known is that he possesses many great tools which lend themselves to typical high-end goalie characteristics. That means he has a good trade value (despite some recent struggles). So if we trade him and he doesn't pan out, then we've likely made away with a good return for a failed prospect. It could very well be a ""sell high"" situation on Lehner, since continued struggles would rapidly degrade his value from here on out. a) If he is traded and does pan out, then we have no guarantee that he would have developed the same way for our team for various circumstantial reasons (coaching staff, team mates, role, ice time, injuries, etc.). Here's where Bishop can be a good example because he seems to have worked out well in Tampa thus far. But if we kept him there's a good chance he would've played behind Lehner or Andy, giving him less ice time. We're also seeing Bishop dealing with some injuries (2-3 in the past year, iirc), which may have been better or worse with us. Point is, prospects (especially goalies) have volatile development arcs and there's no reason kicking yourself too much about their potential/eventual success elsewhere since there's little guarantee the same success would be had if the player was retained. The Bishop return wasn't great, but that's entirely hindsight (at the time we were largely proclaimed ""winners"" or having done very well).  b) If he is traded and does pan out, then good for him and his new team. We have goalie depth right now and the return might bring back assets which meet more pressing needs for us. We would have Andy short term with a cheap and potentially solid backup in Hammond, plus between Driedger, O'Connor, and Hogberg you have to imagine at least one of them pans out to being an NHL caliber goalie in a few years (of what skill level remains to be determined). Ultimately the return for Lehner might give us 10+ years of another player at a different postition with a potentially larger impact - whether you're gambling on Lehner reaching his potential or another player/pick it's a risk either way. We don't see or hear a lot of what happens behind the scenes, nor do most of us have the experience necessary to fully evaluate a player. If the coaching staff have concerns that (for example) Lehner's concussion is an issue, or that he's plateau'd developmentally, then his likelihood to reach the peak we want him to achieve his seriously damaged. The gamble might ultimately be too risky for a budget team like ourselves to bet on, so whether or not he's trade and works out for another team is irrelevant. We perhaps can't afford to take the risk, so we get a decent return now and cross our fingers for better or worse."
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,BradMarshTheAllstar,5,Fri Jun 19 05:24:19 2015 UTC,there's no reason kicking yourself too much about their potential/eventual success elsewhere    And half the hockey blogosphere disappears in a puff of logic!  (Not disagreeing with ya btw)
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,PaddleDown,3,Fri Jun 19 11:37:22 2015 UTC,"I think we've gone over this a lot already, but my 2c are that Anderson would allow us to keep competitive while our youth develops in a positive, winning environment. Hammond will be able to stop-gap after Andy gets a bit older. O'Connor and/or Hogberg will be able to fill in the youth gap that will be left by Lehner's departure. I know Lehner has a lot of upside and he's done well for his age, but there are no guarantees that he'll ever be an elite goaltender... just as there are no guarantees with O'Connor, or Hogberg, or any other young netminder. The thinking would be that Lehner will fetch more because of his age, and that we have the depth in net to stomach his departure, whereas when Bishop left it really didn't appear that the organization had any legitimate goaltender prospects in the pipeline."
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,peskysens,3,Fri Jun 19 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"The benefits? Honestly, unless there is some GM out there willing to hand over something good. Not really much...   BUT I think Murray somehow believes Ottawa is a cup ready team. Where as the reality is we are a middle of the pack team, that with a lucky streak could be a mid playoff push team. But we don't have the experience/depth to take it all. IMO  I am more nervous about this years draft/pre-season than ever before for this team. I feel that we are REALLY going to regret moving Lehner (if he is the one to go) in a season or two when we are left with an aged out Anderson, and Hammond to take his place. Then again there are always goalies available ;)"
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,NotHallucinatingOwls,2,Fri Jun 19 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you. I don't really agree with how GMBM thinks we're a cup caliber team because of our do or die run at the end.   Honestly, if we get the assets we need from Lehner that we can be a playoff team then it would be a good trade. But we are just a team of rookies. Waiting 2-3 years will definitely pay off with trading Anderson."

OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,NotHallucinatingOwls,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"If you free up Lehner or Andy, we sure could.  We're looking to unload a goalie for a top 6 fwd or draft are we not?"
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,3thoughts,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, Patrick Sharp is the last person I want on the Sens. Sharp has been a fantastic player, but he's gonna start to go downhill within the next year or two. We don't need an aging star, we need solid young players that can push us to the playoffs"
OttawaSenators,3ad9rj,lucastimmons,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:57:17 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing on Lehner that I have heard in recent weeks...players and management do not like him. Players do not respect him, think he's lazy and not committed to working out or developing as a player, and he thinks he's entitled to the job without putting in the work. He had these issues a few years ago and seemed to right the ship, but has tailed off recently. If they don't have Anderson they would most likely keep him...I thought Andy would be traded but I'm hearing Lehner is more likely the guy now because of the locker room problems. Funny thing is management also didn't like Anderson the past couple of years for not toughing it out when coming back from injury, ie taking too long to come back. So there's reason either could move"
OttawaSenators,3aaxos,Lanhdanan,5,Thu Jun 18 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"Like it, and happy the term is fairly short. Our recent track record with retaining coaches (and/or have them continue to succeed for us) has been poor, so this seems like a good term length all things considered. I wasn't a fan of Cameron when we hired him, but I grew to like him more and more.   Normally I wouldn't particularly care, but after the big Babcock extension I am now curious what the dollar value is."

OttawaSenators,3aaxos,Valentine96,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:58:48 2015 UTC,Seriously what's going on here?
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,Ramher,5,Thu Jun 18 20:03:37 2015 UTC,I think this means he's not getting his top 6 he wanted.
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,sex_panther_by_odeon,4,Thu Jun 18 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"It appears to be a buyer's market leading up to the draft. I hope we keep the trio then. I don't understand the urgency. If we're not getting a good draft pick or the top six we want, what is the rush? Teams are bound to need a reliable goalie when the season starts."
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,czekhthis,5,Thu Jun 18 21:12:59 2015 UTC,The problem is that Talbot is also being shopped and he is more proven than Lehner.
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,sex_panther_by_odeon,3,Thu Jun 18 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"If Talbot gets traded first then the season starts, won't the teams who didn't get him become a little more desperate and willing to give up more to get a goalie?"
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,Jarretl9,2,Thu Jun 18 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"Hopefully. If we have to wait until after Talbot gets dealt to get a better deal, I'd rather wait, instead of making some ugly blockbuster move to get greening and legwand out.   EDIT: but then again I guess we'd have to do something before July 1st to keep Condra."
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,czekhthis,2,Thu Jun 18 21:26:20 2015 UTC,Now Vancouver has also announced that they are willing to trade a goalie. The goalie market is getting less and less valuable.
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,sex_panther_by_odeon,2,Fri Jun 19 10:22:30 2015 UTC,"True, but I think while Ottawa is leaning more toward moving Lehner they're open to trading either him or Anderson... and while /u/Jarretl9 may be correct in surmising that the other teams interested in a young goaltender might feel the heat to make a trade of be left behind, it could also open the door up for an Anderson trade as the teams interested in him wouldn't be the same as those interested in a Talbot or Lehner."
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,PaddleDown,2,Fri Jun 19 14:32:58 2015 UTC,But Lack is also available. So that will complicate Anderson's deal
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,sex_panther_by_odeon,2,Fri Jun 19 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much it would impact Anderson's trade market, given that teams who would want Anderson are looking for a veteran goaltender with proven numbers in both the regular season and post-season. Looking at the numbers...  Eddie Lack   REG: 82GP (34-30-15), .917SV, 2.43GAA POST: 4GP (1-3), .886SV, 3.03GAA   Craig Anderson   REG: 406GP (182-148-2[T]-75), .915SV, 2.52GAA REG SENS: 193GP (95-65-40), .925SV, 2.41GAA POST: 27GP (12-14), .933SV, 2.35GAA   Robin Lehner   REG: 86GP (30-36-15), .914SV, .288GAA POST: 2GP (0-2), .920SV, .243GAA   From these numbers, I'd probably conclude a few things:   Lack's trade would likely impact the Lehner market, not the Anderson market. They have similar NHL experience, with Lack having an edge in numbers and both having next to no real post-season experience. Lehner is younger by several years, so would be a better fit for a team further off (e.g. Buffalo, Arizona, Edmonton) as they can develop around him and let him run with a starter's role regardless of short-term consequences. Lack is more of a wildcard, but teams looking to win the very near (1-3 year) future likely wouldn't take a gamble on him unless better options have been taken off the table. When Anderson has had a decent team in front of him, his numbers have taken a jump. That said, the Sens have had a fairly mediocre roster save a couple plays during Anderson's tenure, and his numbers have still been superior for the past 5 seasons. Anderson has the kind of post-season and high-pressure record of success and numbers improvement that a team in the market for a veteran netminder might look for. Lack has decent numbers in his limited NHL experience during the regular season, but would be a gamble if you're looking for a goaltender with experience to take into the post-season (which would be those who'd want an older Anderson, and not likely to be in the market for Lack)."
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,PaddleDown,2,Fri Jun 19 16:16:27 2015 UTC,"Anderson is the odd man out here. Bigger contract, and much older.   Being stuck with 3 is not a good idea. Take your picks and go."
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,TheDarkDub,5,Thu Jun 18 23:24:25 2015 UTC,Sigh Should've just bought out Greening...
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,xBarDown,3,Thu Jun 18 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"All these articles I've been reading concerning the Sens and their trade desires makes me think that the Ottawa PR dept is desperate (due to management pressures) to get the message out there. I doubt there is a fan in the NHL with a pulse that doesn't know what the Sens have, what they want and when."
OttawaSenators,3abnhe,Lanhdanan,3,Thu Jun 18 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"This is making me nervous. Trade Anderson for an asset and then buy out Greening. Legwand will just have to be a 4th liner and Neil + Phillips will be healthy scratches. If we put those guys in the trade, we're getting less of a return."

OttawaSenators,3a8l23,uhoh_spaghetti_0,15,Thu Jun 18 02:11:12 2015 UTC,"I'd love to keep him over Greening or Legwand, and happily give him a bit of a reasonable raise as well. Neither of those guys will be easy to move though. Condra isn't as irreplaceable as some seem to imagine, but he's been excellent in his role and hope they find a way to get something done."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,PaddleDown,7,Thu Jun 18 03:45:18 2015 UTC,I know Ottawa isn't in the business of buying out players but with Greening we may have no choice. I feel a little bad for the guy but thus is the nature of the biz.
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,MelvinFinklethorpe,-7,Thu Jun 18 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Murray has done a hell of a job mismanaging this team.  Our RFA/Condra problem wouldn't be an issue had he held off on Michalek, Legwand and a several other veteran players who were demanding big bucks despite being in the twilight of their respective careers."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,Nutzillaa,5,Thu Jun 18 06:26:31 2015 UTC,"while you may be overstating, Michalek has nothing to do with this logjam.  GMBM could have done better but had to play the cards he was dealt.  TBH Condra really came in to his own this year with Pageau and Lazar, and who could predict that?"
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,InTURRISting,6,Thu Jun 18 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"Condra had been great for years; his play this year should not have been a surprise.   http://www.hockeybuzz.com/blog/Travis-Yost/The-Cheap-Driver/134/61177  No idea why Nutzilla is downvoted so hard, he makes a really good point. I was upset about the Legwand, Phillips and Michalek signings at the time because they were unnecessary"
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,mike-kt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:01:04 2015 UTC,Condra is great but underperformed in the offense dept.
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,InTURRISting,5,Thu Jun 18 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"For forwards with greater than 500 minutes, Condra was 212th in points/60min scoring with 1.41 P/60  Top 90 forwards between 3.00 and 1.86 P/60 spots 91-180 between 1.84 - 1.52 P/60 spots 181-270 between 1.52 - 1.20      If you consider these three blocks of players as 1st line, 2nd line and 3rd line players, Condra is right in the middle of those 3rd line players. Condra is a 3rd line winger and produces like a 3rd line winger. I want him to stay."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,mike-kt,3,Thu Jun 18 17:41:12 2015 UTC,No body with sense wants him to leave.   His performance last season was huge for him.
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,InTURRISting,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"It was huge, he's just been that good for several years"
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,mike-kt,5,Fri Jun 19 12:00:55 2015 UTC,"If anything I feel like Michalek is one of our best anti-logjam tools. He can honestly fit well on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd lines. He might be an expensive 3rd liner, but he can play that role fine. It's the players like Greening and Legwand who cause the jam."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,zdelusion,4,Thu Jun 18 15:48:59 2015 UTC,This is my assessment as well.  He is a great utility player and is always working the corners.  We need that on every line
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,InTURRISting,3,Thu Jun 18 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"There are more expensive, far less productive 4th liners, so I'm alright even if he has to slide up and down from 1 to 3."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,PaddleDown,3,Thu Jun 18 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"Considering Condra hadn't been given an opportunity under MacLean, Pageau started in the minors, and Lazar was slated for junior... I'd say nobody could've predicted that. Except /u/Nutzillaa of course."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,PaddleDown,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"See, part of being a good GM is having the ability to project how young players will develop over long and short periods of time.  Pageau only started in the minors because Murray signed David Legwand to a contract, effectively eliminating Pageau's roster spot.  Murray even went on record saying that Pageau was and should be playing in the NHL but due to roster restrictions he had to be sent down.  That's awful management.  Murray decided to sign a guy who was 5x more expensive than Pageau even though he should have had an inkling based on Pageau's playoff performances against Montreal and the scouting reports coming out of Bingo, but NOPE, gotta get that veteran leadership in the locker room!    Lazar really has nothing to do with this.  Condra was a valuable asset to this team long before he started playing with Pageau and Lazar.  He was an excellent penalty killer under Paul MacLean and anyone who watched the team with any sort of regularity knew he was a semi-important piece.  It was only once he started getting more third-line minutes that the casual fan started to take notice of his importance to the group."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,Nutzillaa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"He absolutely does, imo.  An aging winger with knee issues who's several years passed his prime on a $4 million deal for three years?  He's a shadow of his former self and we'll be lucky to get even one 15-goal season in the next few years and there's no chance another team will take a flyer on him with his current production and injury history.  Admittedly, he played OK down the stretch with Turris before getting hurt but just OK isn't good enough, especially when we've got younger, cheaper options in the AHL who are looking for an opportunity to play in the N.  I disagree about Condra just coming into his own this year.  He was an excellent penalty killer under Paul MacLean who had issues scoring which isn't too far off of what he was this year in the second half under Cameron.  I think fans began to take notice once he started getting more third line minutes but in no way has he experienced some sort of massive transformation in his game a la Patrick Wiercioch.  Contra obviously isn't a guy who can't be replaced but it would be nice to have him around at like 1.9ish and this mess Murray has gotten us into will almost surely make sure that that doesn't happen."
OttawaSenators,3a8l23,Nutzillaa,8,Thu Jun 18 21:45:33 2015 UTC,Looks like the HYPE LINE is still in business boys!

OttawaSenators,3a6829,Ramher,12,Wed Jun 17 15:30:52 2015 UTC,"Trigger warning: Don't read TSN comment section.   I really hate how people think they could just manage an NHL team and GM's are stupid. There's literally nothing easier than watching trades happen and then saying 6 months later ""Here's what I would have done""... No one cares what you would have done, that's in the past and it doesn't matter. They have to take risks and make tough decisions and they can't tell the future. Ugh. /end rant.   Ok so in my opinion I want to see Andy traded. It'll be tough to let him go but we're gonna get more value and he'll have a shot at winning something with his time left. This team has to develop still. If you take a look back at our 06/07 roster, we had a stacked team, and then some. Similar to the Hawks, that's what you need to win a cup. I'm sure Andy/Hammond would get us more wins next season, but if we can't make a realistic cup run there's no point. We have to keep Lehner and give it time. We have a ridiculous amount of rookies developing and hopefully our draft pick from this year helps us out with another solid t6 forward or t4 D. Time and developing is what we need. As always, at least we're not the leafs."
OttawaSenators,3a6829,Conpod,6,Wed Jun 17 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"I just fear that Lehner has yet to show that he can be a number 1 goalie.

OttawaSenators,3a6829,sex_panther_by_odeon,9,Wed Jun 17 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"doesn't really matter, if lehner isn't a #1 goalie we'd be shopping in a few years anyways. i'd rather find out lehner can't hack it while the team is a bottom 15 team (bottom 5 until the giant fluke run at the end of the seaosn) then piss away some good years with bad goaltending."
OttawaSenators,3a6829,twist2002,4,Wed Jun 17 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"I fear that our defense has never been even close to good enough to actually have a number 1 goalie.

OttawaSenators,3a6829,Valentine96,2,Wed Jun 17 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you. Anderson will bring in more value and Lehner fits with our age group of the team. Lehner will develop better as a #1 he's been fighting for and Anderson will help a competing team. Even so with Anderson going to a competing team, we could get a draft pick teams like St. Louis don't care about."
OttawaSenators,3a6829,TheKandyCinema,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"They've said the asking price for both is the same, so if you're right they'll indeed trade andy. Also, St Louis doesn't have a 1st."

OttawaSenators,3a6829,shining_,3,Wed Jun 17 17:37:31 2015 UTC,This. I would rather they go to camp with a 3 headed monster then give up Lehner or Andy for a bag of pucks. We need a package deal and I'm not sure other teams will accept that. Gotta move that dead weight on the back end and shed some cap space. Get Greening off the books for sure. I can live with the others.
OttawaSenators,3a6829,CookingInTheKitchen,6,Wed Jun 17 17:43:21 2015 UTC,Burns is on a NTC and Anderson and Lehner aren't worth the amount that he is.

Typically teams are more willing to give up draft picks right before the draft, since they're more certain of what they're giving up. I believe Murray said himself that whatever offers he gets these few weeks would likely be the best.   The worst case is wait too long and the goalie market dries up as everyone looks elsewhere."

OttawaSenators,3a40wt,SkullCrusherXP,10,Wed Jun 17 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"nope, they should all spend at least one full year in Bingo.  The only reason Lazar skipped from Junior to the NHL was because he was too young to play in the AHL and another year in the CHL would've been a total waste of his development time."
OttawaSenators,3a40wt,Funkativity,8,Wed Jun 17 02:22:15 2015 UTC,"Paul is actually only ~4 months older than Lindberg, both are 2013 draftees, so the age difference is negligible and both will start next year as 20 year olds.  I would say very unlikely we see him in Ottawa for any significant stretch of time next year, unless there are some major injuries like the 2012/13 shortened season. But with Puempel, Prince, Grant, and Robinson all being good prospects due for NHL playing time (and Lazar if he's in the AHL next season due to our NHL contract glut more than anything.) and all likely ahead of Paul on the depth chart - it seems doubtful. Especially when you look at the positional depth for Paul to compete against (who's a LW/C, to my knowledge): Hoffman LW/C, MacArthur LW, Michalek LW, Condra RW/LW, Smith C/LW, Grant C/LW, Prince LW/C, Puempel LW. If anything we're thinner on depth RW (Lindberg is a RW/C), since after Stone/Ryan we have Condra (RW/LW), Neil (RW), Chiasson (RW), Lazar (C/RW), Robinson (RW), Schneider (RW/LW), many of which are players who may be gone within the next ~12-13 months (Condra, Neil, Chiasson, Schenider), or are presumed to be less skilled than Lindberg (Neil, Schnieder, Robinson, possibly Chiasson development pending). In other words we have options with quantity on both wings, but the quality is a bit higher at LW than RW.  Also bear in mind that expectations for both Paul and Lindberg need to be tempered. Both have had great success in the OHL, but we don't even know yet how their respective skill sets will translate to a pro level in the AHL, let alone the NHL. Excellent prospects and I hope for nothing but the best with both of 'em, but they're not proven pro hockey players and even if they could conceivably keep up in the NHL it's probably best developmentally for them both to play 1-2 seasons in the AHL first while getting top-6 minutes even night against similar quality players."
OttawaSenators,3a40wt,Omega613,3,Wed Jun 17 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"Are we likely to see Cole Schneider ever get NHL time? Based on his stats I'd say he's pretty good in the AHL, but I never hear of him much and I don't think he was ever drafted, just a free agent signing."
OttawaSenators,3a40wt,Jthedude17,2,Wed Jun 17 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"That's a damn good question. From what I know, he's a pretty good AHLer, and would transition reasonably well to the nhl in a budget bottom-6 role. He's also one of our very few non-NHLers with RW experience. But I'm just not sure that I see any space for him with our team logistically, and by the time there is a spot at RW (eg. some combo of Neil retires, Condra leaves, Chiasson traded, etc.) I reckon Lindberg will be knocking while being younger with more upside.   So yeah, really unsure but I'm doubting it the more I think about it. He could get nhl time with another team or remain a solid AHL lifer. Not dissimilar with Grant I feel, although in my opinion he could conceivably outplay Smith/Legwand/Lazar in the short term for that 4C spot as early as next season so long as the 23 man roster limit isn't an issue by then (and provided he doesn't leave as a UFA this summer)."

And if we want to push to the next step where we can make the post season without having to rely on some sort of phenomenon, I really don't believe another youth in a bottom6 role is going to help us.   Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful issue to have when you have potential talent waiting to come up, but I would much prefer he play at least 1 year in Bingo and get some experience there and maybe get a call up if there is an injury (knock on wood this doesn't happen) or for a fun trial."

OttawaSenators,3a1kdz,On_Letting_Go,8,Tue Jun 16 17:17:22 2015 UTC,Entry-level contracts are given to players under the age of 25 and vary in length depending on the player's age. The entry-level contract is usually the first professional contract that a player under 25 signs when beginning his NHL career.
OttawaSenators,3a1kdz,Conpod,2,Tue Jun 16 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"Got it. I think I knew the first part, but I was confused when the article said he would go through development camp. Is this going to be a Pageau sorta thing where he gets called up a couple times and has to prove himself?"
OttawaSenators,3a1kdz,On_Letting_Go,5,Tue Jun 16 17:30:11 2015 UTC,"Basically once a guy like this has signed an ELC it's up to the coaching staff to determine where he plays.

On top of this, maybe sign Erhoff or Martin as Pittsburgh has already said they won't be back next year. And on top of that, deal lehner and cowen for a top six forward (eberle/Yakupov)? If all of this happened I would probably be the happiest guy on the planet. Will all of this happen, probably not, but this would be the best possible situation in my opinion."

OttawaSenators,39umgt,Ubuhio,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:02:11 2015 UTC,"Assuming Wideman re-signs with us, which may be contingent on us clearing out some defence depth in front of him and showing him he has a realistic opportunity to make the team in the near future. Given his performance the past couple seasons he's going to have opportunities in a lot of organizations for a two-way contract and a first-resort call-up player."
OttawaSenators,39umgt,PaddleDown,3,Mon Jun 15 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"There's a huge list of players that need to be re-signed.    I think it'll be difficult to re-sign Condra, I feel like his ask will be higher than Ottawa's willing to go. I'm honestly 50/50 on Condra, the deciding factor for me would be his salary.   A lot of the ""bad"" contracts will be difficult to get rid of, Michalek, Legwand, Greening, Neil and Phillips all have No Move/No Trade Clauses.     The nice thing is 3 of these contracts will fall off the books next season, and a playoff team may try to grab a cheap rental player. The cap situation will be less bloated just as Ottawa needs to step up into a being a better team in the league.     A big name acquisition now would do a lot to ensure Ottawa is a top half team in the next few years just as the cap situation is freeing up."
OttawaSenators,39umgt,FixedTheNewelPost,4,Mon Jun 15 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"Don't bring in any new forwards. Trade away the useless ones and use the minor league guys who are ready to make an impact (Prince, Puempel, Grant) for depth/bottom-6/call-ups.  I wish we could drop Borocop and Gryba, as much as I enjoy their physical play. We have AHL D-men (mainly Wideman and also Claesson) ready to get into the lineup some. I'm okay bringing an experienced (think 25-32 years old, not 33-36) D man on a short term deal who can steady the blue line and help mentor the young guys (either by trade via a goalie or a free agent.)  Trade one of Anderson or Lehner. I'm personally on the ""trade Anderson"" boat because his value has never been higher, he will start to get worse within a few years, and Lehner wasn't too bad this year when he had the undisputed starting job for a little bit. He just needs to be trusted more. Hammond can also cover his ass. I'm okay with Lehner and Hammond splitting the games 50/50. Lehner will still be getting more games and adapting to a bigger workload. Hammond already got used to being relied on so this won't be asking as much of him.   At the draft, unless there is a good forward who drops down, we need to take a D man I feel. Just a clear-cut first rounder who will be a definite, very good NHL'er for years to come. Use the second rounders on at least one forward who can still be a future NHL'er. Defence is a more ""fix-now"" situation (yes I understand that a defenceman will take a couple years, but it still isn't a long time to wait). Thomas Chabot is a guy that we might look at.  We don't really need to alter the forwards, just trim the dead weight and let them play. If a good forward is brought in through a goalie trade, great, but our forwards are good right now. Our blue line isn't fantastic, but if we bring in an NHL D man through a trade (my preference, as opposed to a forward) it helps a lot. I'd like to get at least Wideman 10-20 games, depending on the schedule and injuries.   With goalies, we should do fairly well no matter which one we trade. I have faith in Hammond, and no, we might not be as good next year with Lehner as opposed to Anderson, but I think it'll be the right move in the long run."

Maybe Wideman and Claesson won't be given anything on a silver platter, but at least show them the road to the NHL is open if they can play their way into it. Right now, no matter how good they are is there really a way for them to make it to the big team?"
OttawaSenators,39umgt,mike-kt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:09:01 2015 UTC,"If we don't clear out a couple defencemen I don't see Wideman re-signing with us when he will have ample opportunities with a number of other clubs. While he would likely still get a two-way contract, he'd be a lot closer to a call-up and legitimate icetime elsewhere (if we don't move some guys). Phillips will be done after this contract is over, and I'd be shocked if all of Gryba/Cowen/Boro remain here... although none of them have a lot of value on the market. I'd gather Boro would likely net the most return. I'd be fine with bringing in an older guy for #3/4 to play alongside Wiercioch if it were a short contract, but we at least with a trade we could relieve the logjam a bit."
OttawaSenators,39umgt,PaddleDown,5,Mon Jun 15 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"Of all the potential players available for trade, I really, really want us to pursue Brent Burns.  I know the Sharks need a goalie, and depth, both of which we can provide.  I know the odds of this happening are slim, but I think the wookie would look good in black and red."
OttawaSenators,39umgt,Butthisistheinternet,5,Mon Jun 15 01:09:51 2015 UTC,Brent Burns is not even remotely close to being available.
OttawaSenators,39umgt,Funkativity,2,Mon Jun 15 02:04:06 2015 UTC,"As happy as this would make me, I'm not sure we could temp Burnsey to Ottawa.   But good lord this would absolutely be a hell of a move if we could pull it off."
OttawaSenators,39umgt,Butthisistheinternet,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"Obviously it's a pipe dream, but Murray made it clear that he's looking to acquire top players in exchange for volume on our end in return."
OttawaSenators,39umgt,peskysens,2,Mon Jun 15 17:05:12 2015 UTC,there isn't much chance Ottawa can get Burns. It would take far to much to pry him out of SJ. It would need to be a deal like Anderson/Lehner + Weircoich + Hoffman or something absurd.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,TheKandyCinema,35,Sun Jun 14 08:13:42 2015 UTC,"Every ""solution"" the author supplies is terrible. Those concepts are all disgusting."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Alpostrophe,16,Sun Jun 14 12:33:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, aside from the Avalanche one - that one looks fine imo.

OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Omega613,2,Sun Jun 14 16:19:19 2015 UTC,Dat shade of brown doe
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,heisenberg1215,2,Tue Jun 16 03:38:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I definitely disagree with what the author has provided for any of the teams. But I've looked at two lists and the Sens were 3rd place on both. I just decided to pick one to get a different debate going on here.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,BottledBarf,0,Sun Jun 14 19:12:14 2015 UTC,The Canucks one is particularly hysterical.  It looks like something the Charleston Chiefs would have worn in 1995.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,hoopopotamus,18,Mon Jun 15 15:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I'm not wild about their suggestion, either.  The O jerseys are the best we've ever had.  The 3/4 view Senator needs to go. But the one they offer looks like a Canes jersey"
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Mcgyvr,11,Sun Jun 14 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'm all in favour of the heritage home and away, and then a 90s rework third jersey."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,eyemuhpierut,8,Sun Jun 14 11:48:51 2015 UTC,"If they go with heritage home and away, the third should be a reworking of their 92-93 road jersey with the updated 2D logo. I love that jersey."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,peck37,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:09:59 2015 UTC,I think that would be the best jersey set-up... The heritage jerseys are very nice and work very well as full time home and away.  and then bring back the 2D Logo in an alternate!
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,safewinter,2,Sun Jun 14 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"https://johnnynovak.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dafront.jpg  I think this would be a great third jersey. It's a re-do of the 92-93 eyemuhpierut was talking about. However, the new logo should be added."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,theloverobot,10,Sun Jun 14 23:44:48 2015 UTC,Our home and away jerseys are very bland and uninspiring. I love our alternate jersey though. I rock that shit all the time.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,OfficialGreenkid,10,Sun Jun 14 12:47:51 2015 UTC,"If there was a change back the 2D, which I wouldn't be opposed too, I'd also like to see the home jersey revert back to black instead of red. Honestly I've never like the 3D head, but I think most of us agree that the best decision would be just to push the heritage jerseys through full time."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,theloverobot,2,Sun Jun 14 10:35:02 2015 UTC,"I think the 2d logo and black/white with red stripes should come back as our primary set, and the heritage should remain a 3rd. If only because I've never been a fan of the ""O"" logo on it's own. It works on the jersey, but as far as being a brandmark it just doesn't carry any weight.  Plus, those black 90's jerseys looked badass, regardless of anything else"

OttawaSenators,39sdz3,InnocentGun,7,Tue Jun 16 00:58:25 2015 UTC,Author seems to have a thing for waist stripes
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Fortehlulz33,2,Sun Jun 14 12:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yes I'm not sure how I feel about them. They do harken back to the ""good old days"" of regular playoff appearances and the occasional President's Trophy, but the current style of uniforms is definitely trending towards a cleaner look. Too much piping and/or detail is not a good thing. Broad stripes or simple patterns tend to work well - look at how enduring the Original Six designs are (let's ignore that terrible stretch of Statue of Liberty Rangers unis). Funny angles, weird piping, and patterns aren't ""classic"" or ""clean"", but I could get back on board with the gold wreath pattern since it is not overly complex. Plus I like the red better than the old black alternate."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,InnocentGun,2,Sun Jun 14 13:30:51 2015 UTC,waist striped are ultimately better because they just look good. It's a way of separating the pants and sweater. I never liked the monochrome look without waist stripes.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,pyjamalovingbanana,2,Sun Jun 14 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"I agree it is necessary in cases where the team wears pants that are the same colour as the jersey. Ottawa's choice of black shorts with white or red jerseys isn't as bad, but they did go with a band on the throwback."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,eyemuhpierut,14,Sun Jun 14 14:37:08 2015 UTC,I personally agree. I'd like to go vintage and either give an homage to the 2006 Sens or the 1910 Sens.   I'd love to see our current alternate jersey be our home jersey and the Heritage Classic jersey be the away. I honestly just love those jerseys so much.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Jarretl9,7,Sun Jun 14 08:14:38 2015 UTC,"current alternate jersey be our home jersey and the Heritage Classic jersey be the away   Agree fully, that would be fantastic to see"
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Chili_Palmer,4,Sun Jun 14 11:12:32 2015 UTC,"I think that kit is as iconic as it gets. It's fashionable enough to look great outside of the arena, while still looking classic and sinister inside. I don't know why the team hasn't done this yet."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Chili_Palmer,2,Sun Jun 14 16:01:33 2015 UTC,The only issue I have would be the 'O' becoming our primary logo. I would like a modified Sens logo on the vintage jerseys.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Vickshow,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the logo isn't in the best state right now. The 3D logo to me is pretty childish and something just as simple as an ""O"" would be quite clean and professional."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,i-am-the-walrus789,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"I agree the 3D logo sucks, but with the 2D logo we could finally stop changing them, because that would be a great jersey forever."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,MooseFlyer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:25:32 2015 UTC,I agree. Either the redone or the old one would also be great and I would have no complaints.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,benches48,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I think our best possible Jersey would be the two heritage jerseys, with the 2D senators logo of old instead of the plain letter O."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,ibanez-guy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:25:01 2015 UTC,This has been suggested ever since the heritage jersey was unveiled. I think our best hope of it happening is if they move arenas. They are talking about moving downtown so if they have to make a new arena why not rebrand the team and get new home/away jerseys at the same time.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Conpod,9,Sun Jun 14 17:34:02 2015 UTC,Am I the only one around here who loves our current logo and Jersey?
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,JHewitt87,2,Sun Jun 14 14:53:01 2015 UTC,I think the logo is a bit childish but I would be unaffected if it changed. I don't really like the bland Edge jerseys though.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,broomlad,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I love the current one! And I honestly never liked the O jersey. That ""O"" represents in no way the ""Senators"". We can't make that our primary jersey, cause then we lose our identity. We're the ""Senators"", not the ""Ottawas"", god dammit! You want a jersey and logo that's nice and also intimidating for the other team. The old 3d logo was the best in my opinion. Plus it lets our fans dress up as badass Spartan warriors."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Xavier26,2,Wed Jun 17 06:53:14 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like Roman Centurions represent the Senators all that well either.   And I'm fine with the identity being based around Ottawa, not the Senators, because, frankly, it's a bit of a silly name.   The only logo that would really work well with a senator identity would be something involving the parliament buildings."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,thirty7inarow,8,Wed Jun 17 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"Fuck that Sens concept jersey looks terrible. I like the jerseys right now. But if we had to change it, bring back more heritage jerseys and just modify them a tiny bit."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,antonio106,3,Sun Jun 14 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"I don't like the solutions... I think our 3rd should become are mains.  Is it a perfect solution?  No, but I don't know if there is one.  I'm a big believer that a logo should be something basic, not something busy.  I really liked when the Lightnign switched to their current one.  It's stripped down, an I like it.  That's why I really like the idea of using the 'O' logo.  It's stripped down and simplified."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,moosk,3,Sun Jun 14 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"I used to hate the old 2D looking senator (our main one from the alfie era), and now that it's gone, I love it and want it back. I think that's what this is. There's nothing really wrong with our current jerseys, people just like to complain and want new things all the time. Our heritage jerseys are the best one's we've had in a while and I wouldn't mind a combination of the Senator and the 'O' in our next jersey."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,otherwiser,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:47:07 2015 UTC,Same here. Maybe just because it was 12 or so years old until the rebrand.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Chili_Palmer,2,Mon Jun 15 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know why they seem to be phasing out the use of the heritage jerseys? Is this to make them more of a commodity, so they can sell them with a higher price tag?"
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,epwnym,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"I don't feel that they're phasing them out.  I feel like the move to put these on Thursdays only this year was good - you know going into a game what jersey your team is wearing, if you're worried about that kind of thing.    Also reminds me of what some MLB teams are doing - wearing a throwback jersey on Sundays (like what the Blue Jays should be doing now, and what they used to do on Fridays)."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,tornfightstrap,2,Mon Jun 15 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"The main sweaters could use a bit of trim - black and gold, or even a band of the alternate colours. The alternate O sweater is perfect, don't change a thing.   As for the others - Vancouver's is fine, I really like the current ones. A V with Johnny Canuck could work as a third."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Chili_Palmer,2,Sun Jun 14 19:57:57 2015 UTC,"I'll just say it- the Ottawa Senators shouldn't wear red. We're a black-first team.  A red third is fine, but we need a black home.  The solution is to use our heritage jerjays for home and road, and maybe get something like our old red jersey as our alternate.  It was cool and unique, and worth seeing a handful of times a year.  We do desperately need to get rid of the generic Reebok crap we have now, though."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Jabbs95,3,Mon Jun 15 13:23:30 2015 UTC,Both the Sabres and Sens benefit from the 2D throwback. Bring back the circular saw!
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,heisenberg1215,2,Sun Jun 14 16:11:28 2015 UTC,The 'faux-3d' logo is absolutely awful. I'd be on board w/ the concept they created.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,heisenberg1215,2,Sun Jun 14 11:55:02 2015 UTC,"I fully agree we have one of the worst jerseys in the league. But I absolutely despise the new 2D logo. It feels like an AHL version of the iconic (at least to me) original Sens logo.   My vision:  Bring the original 2D logo back- perhaps with minor colour tweaks- and put it on a black third jersey (which becomes our 'heritage third', looking like the 1992 Sens). Make a red heritage O jersey that becomes our home, and a white (fully white not cream) heritage O as our away.  Shoulder patches: on new black third, stay the same as the current one, the bilingual shields with the team name. On the home and away, switch to the original 2D logo.  Bam! Instantly one of the best looking teams in the league, just in time for Erik and the gang's prime and a shot at the Cup."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,SexyOmlet,2,Sun Jun 14 23:00:22 2015 UTC,I think it would just be easier to keep the Alternate and the Heritage Classic but I agree with everything else.
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,BigRiggety,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"Disagree, the new 2D logo is far superior."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,krisk1759,2,Mon Jun 15 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely need to bring back a 2D logo. I hate the faux 3D one with a passion.  Current home and away are definitely bland. Not ugly, just forgettable. Our retro alternate is fantastic, but I'd like to keep it as the alternate and just use it more.  Oddly enough, in the that weird third sens concept, there is a germ of something interesting. What's there is definitely not right, but it's sort of on the right path.  /me fires up Illustrator"
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Ubuhio,3,Sun Jun 14 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"The Senators need a new home and away set since they've had the same design since 2007, and it isn't exactly a classic.  I'm in the minority in that I like the Senators home and away edge template. A lot of the Edge templates looked bad, but especially compared to the previous ""swoosh"" home jerseys the Edge template that the Senators and Penguins used looked slick and stylish when it first came out.  One thing to consider, the Senators have branded the team as ""United In Red"". Meaning, as much as a lot of fans would like a 90's black throwback as the main jersey, it isn't likely to happen.  My favourite idea has been to take the updated 2-D logo, and place it on a template similar to the Heritage third template. Red for home, white (not cream or vintage) for away, and keep the current black O jersey as the third.  Similar to this, but with the same striping as the Heritage: http://i.imgur.com/tlaJOAX.png  Here's an example showing that a red Heritage would actually look good, slap the updated circular 2D logo on here instead of the O: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-piBGQZ2iGHY/UGpRto59tUI/AAAAAAAAArg/3Cjh5Bm9r1w/s1600/OttawaSens2.0-JustinCox.png  Then, bring back the 90's home/away for Stadium games."
OttawaSenators,39sdz3,Stinky-pickle,0,Sun Jun 14 17:59:06 2015 UTC,"YES! that first link is exactly what would look great. Has a classic look, incorporates elements of the old silver seven stripes and the 90's senators logo."

It was very well-written and kept me interested.  I'm sure there are several sites with great Senators content that I haven't come across; however, I'm glad that you shared this one for me to see, otherwise I probably would never have known you existed.

However, it isn't because I'm avoiding it, it's just because I never really think about going to new websites.   My go-to's are Twitter, here, and /r/hockey for anything Sens-related because it's what I'm use to and never really thought of looking elsewhere for new -- up to the minute -- content. If those web-sites happen to reference a third-party website that is discussing Sens news, I'll click on the link and read it most of the time. For whatever reason, I tend to stick with what I'm use to with the aforementioned go-to websites, and lose my interest in the other websites.   Huh, I just noticed I follow 6th Sens and SensNation on Twitter, but not SilverSeven, that could be why I haven't frequented them. Actually, I need more Sens content in my life, been spending too much time with Ian Mendes, Yost, Dreger, Wallace (not that there's anything wrong with that), and Garrioch (...).   Woah, wall of text for such a simple question, haha sorry about that. You must recommend Silver Seven then, do you? I'll have to check them out, thank you!"
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,infinitygoof,2,Sun Jun 14 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"I liked the wall of text, its cool! Silver Seven has been my go to ever since Travis Yost went to TSN. Their features are good and their game recaps are outstanding even if you watched the game."

Boro on the other hand I haven't quite seen enough of him to form a full opinion"
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,kenata88,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:12:44 2015 UTC,Almost makes me wonder what would have happened had Wideman/Claesson got their call-ups prior to Gryba/Boro...
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,mike-kt,4,Sun Jun 14 16:03:15 2015 UTC,Ceci was one of our best defenseman and should not have been on Binghamton. I think he learned a lot playing in Ottawa this year.
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,Funkativity,2,Sun Jun 14 16:47:32 2015 UTC,"He had some rough stretches but who didn't this season. Weirchioch had an aweful start but ended up being a top D-man who played for Canada, even karlsson had a rough start to the year and got nominated for the Norris. What I'm saying is the whole team had a bad stretch and I guess Ceci took a lot of heat because he's the youngest of the bunch and the only one who can get sent to Bingo without having to clear waivers."
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,TheKandyCinema,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"If you look at Ceci's numbers it really looks like he was getting carried by Weircioch. Away from PW he had a pretty rough season.   Because he's decent with Weircioch, it's not a terrible situation. The problem comes when EK, Methot or Weir inevitably gets injured and who can play more minutes without being very exposed? I'm not confident in anyone outside the top 3."
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,GilmerInSpace,2,Sun Jun 14 16:08:35 2015 UTC,"I really like Ceci, but I do think fans have made him out to be a lot better than he actually has been. I think it was a case of him getting way too much responsibility too early in his career. Should probably have been on the third pairing this season in the NHL, but obviously couldn't do that because it would mean one of 62/74 on the second pairing. I still believe another year in Bingo would have done wonders with him."
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,kenata88,2,Mon Jun 15 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"For Lazar.. I think his fate is somewhat tied to Condra: if Condra gets re-signed, you keep the 22-44-27 line together.. it's too much of a useful tool for the team.  if Condra isn't back and we have to reconfigure the whole bottom 6 anyway, then might as well give Curtis a shot at top line duty in Bingo, then maybe pull him back up after 20 games(or whenever they're ready to cycle one of the Bingo guys like Prince/Puempel back down)"
OttawaSenators,39rpnf,mike-kt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"I could see them potentially starting him as the fourth line C if they can get rid of Legwand/Smith, but at the same time wouldn't surprise me if they opt to start him in the AHL."

OttawaSenators,39hddi,mike-kt,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:57:54 2015 UTC,Seems likely that both him and Wideman might see some time with the big club if Phillips isn't playing and Cowen gets offloaded (one way or the other)

With the Eddie Shore under his name, Ottawa will most likely give him a chance. If they're certain they won't give Wideman a chance, they'll let him walk and he'll excel with another team as a top 6."
OttawaSenators,39hddi,TheKandyCinema,7,Sun Jun 14 08:20:40 2015 UTC,"He could be a beast, Went +37 with bingo in 2013-2014 . A Phillips replacement if I've ever seen one."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,jpmad,23,Thu Jun 11 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Not sure about Matt Hoffman, but Mike Hoffman will probably be expensive if available at all"
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,On_Letting_Go,14,Thu Jun 11 17:17:13 2015 UTC,Matt Hoffman and Tony Hawk for Dave Mirra and Travis Pastrana. Do we have a deal?
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,nwj781,4,Thu Jun 11 18:43:05 2015 UTC,Damnit! Set myself up for that one.
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,nwj781,5,Thu Jun 11 19:15:08 2015 UTC,I think we're getting the better end of the deal. Tony Hawk's stock went way down after they banned doing the 900 during penalty shots.
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,Omega613,9,Thu Jun 11 19:23:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly the pieces you've offered probably wouldn't get it done for us. They have plenty of value for other teams, but unlikely to the Sens in my opinion. Keep in mind we're a budget team, so cost controlled assets (RFAs, especially talent we've developed ourselves) are very important to us. Also don't forget Hoffman was our leading scorer with 27 goals, we would need to replace that in some capacity and we don't have any NHL ready prospects who we would expect to manage that next season (Shane Prince is our best NHL-ready offensive prospect, and I would be surprised if he plays and scores more than 27 points next year, nevermind goals). We're not a team with a lot of star power at forward, so we score by committee and rely on every contributor, making someone like Hoffman even tougher to part with unless it's for an immediate side/up-grade. Our roster is also overloaded with players (including RFAs, I think we have 25 or 26 players signed next season) so we're going to be looking to do more of a quantity for quality deal or draft picks for some of the lower value pieces.  Kunitz we really couldn't afford ($$$) relative to his production, and we're already paying 8 NHL dmen (we need a solid 2nd pairing quality guy, not a bottom-pairing, aging Lovejoy who warms the press box alongside Phillips). Meanwhile Bennett, Dumoulin, and Harrington fall into the young prospect/project category, and frankly we have a wealth of those that are already tough to find roster spots for. Sutter is the only name on your list that makes some sense for the Sens, and realistically he would be a clear downgrade from Hoffman.  Hornqvist, Perron, and Maatta are the only semi-realistic targets I see on your roster that would make sense for the Sens right now - and at the same time trading any one of those guys doesn't make sense for the Pens. So honestly I'm not sure a Sens/Pens trade for Hoffman makes much sense right now, despite the fun rhymes :P"
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,Omega613,5,Thu Jun 11 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"Let me start with saying awesome and informative write-up!   Perron is a possibility and I think that GMJR would pull the trigger on a Hoff for Perron trade, not Horny though. He might even throw in Scuderi with cap retained. Scuds is notorious for taking young D-man under his wing. Horny just fits too perfect on the team and many Pens fans already see Maatta as a future hall of famer, so either of those are a no go.  As far as Dumoulin and Harrington, they're not as much of a project as you may think.  Both of these guys could easily jump into the top-4 on most teams in the league. They're ready it's just that they've got Letang, Maatta, Pouliot (future Letang), and Cole (future Niskanen) in front of them."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,Grambo92,3,Thu Jun 11 18:36:13 2015 UTC,"Dumoulin and Harrington, they're not as much of a project as you may think   I certainly don't mean it as a slight to any of them, all I mean is that we don't have the space for a near-ready top-4 guy. Our top pair is Karl-Methot, no confusion or questions there really. Our current 2nd pair is Wiercioch (24 years old, Left-hand) and Ceci (21 years old, our main ""future"" top-4 guy and an Ottawa native, right-hand). Wiercioch is woefully underrated, especially by our team, but drives possession hard and puts up points - looking more and more like he's solidified a top-4 spot especially after the invite to Canada's world championship team where he had a solid outing (for his age and depth position on that team). Ceci is a bit young and inexperienced, but management has made it clear that he's our #3-#5 guy and will be given time a space (and a roster spot) to grow. Very much our golden boy on the back end after Karlsson.  Basically, the only way one of those two is (easily) displaced is if we get a well-established middle pairing caliber D that will likely bounce between the bottom-two pairs with Wier/Ceci based on performance/role/etc.. Chances are Harrington/Dumoulin aren't better than Wier right now (and it's a gamble if they ever will be because prospects are like that), and they won't be as well loved as Ceci so they're likely to be relegated to a bottom pair position (for which we already have too many suitors) or be demoted to the AHL for now. Either way, they're really not helping us much in the present or near future, and if we're giving up a cost-controlled proven goal-scorer like Hoffman then we're not improving our team for next season (which seems to be a priority for Murray, understandably, since we've been on a rebuild path since 2011). From what you described, our situations on the blueline depth chart are very similar in result.  But a deal centered around Perron/Hoffman genuinely could conceivably happen, although I don't know where each team might have to add/subtract to finalize a deal like that (and don't want to speculate because I don't know how valued each player is by each respective org.). I think the Sens would however wish to speak to Perron in advance to ensure that there's a reasonable chance that he's willing to re-sign with the Sens given that he's a UFA after next season."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,skiwithpete,3,Thu Jun 11 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much the Pens want to offer. I believe the Sens would match any offer sheet for our younger guns.   I can see Hoff pulling in a similar contract as Cowen, that starts with a 3 and goes up over the next few years."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,Akoustyk,4,Thu Jun 11 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"We don't have Hoffman available, but can I interest you in some other players?  We have Alex Chiasson.  He's young and fast, and we traded Spezza to get him.  He kinda underperformed last year, but like you said about Bennett, probably just in the wrong situations.  Or there's David Legwand.  A proven leader on other teams.  He's not young, but he's got grit.  And, he played on the top line for Nashville for years before he came here.  There's Colin Greening.  He's probably good.  Bryan Murray is paying him lots of money.  But most of us haven't seen him play.  He spent a lot of time in the press box - so he's well rested - and when he is on the ice, he does a lot of standing around.  LMK, k?  Cuz if not we have a couple of defensemen you can have might want to trade for."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,Funkativity,0,Thu Jun 11 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"Pens are insanely stacked defensively. Ray Shero made sure of that. We've got several phenoms back there so PIT is definitely not in the market for  that. Chiasson is a possibility. I'd be curious to do more research into him.  Edit: Not sure about him, it's a role of the dice. He's trending in the right direction but his past is a little subpar in terms of  what the ""win now"" Pens are looking for. Think we're more likely to go with last year's first round pick K. Kapanen before someone as risky as Chiasson."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,Funkativity,2,Thu Jun 11 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"I would not trade hoffman for any of those players. Malkin and Crosby would both be overkill, idk, I can't think of a player that isn't a superstar, that I'd trade hoffman for. Unless maybe a first round draft pick, depending on where the penguins sit. Not that hoffman is a superstar, but he is a great young player with some potential, and the sens are a young team right now, so, I wouldn't mess with one of our best pieces, which is a young player, on a young team, trying to grow to be a contender.   You should look more to a team like toronto, or something like that. Idk, a team that has some older players, and wants to rebuild. If you want a really strong young player, then what you want to do is find a team that needs something you have right now, and then trade that for a first rounder. But, I don't think you'd want to giveup any of your 1st rounder typed players."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,mike-kt,2,Thu Jun 11 18:26:55 2015 UTC,"probably Lovejoy+Harrington and 2nd round pick next year, with one of our bad contracts going back your way."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,Jaycorr,2,Thu Jun 11 20:19:18 2015 UTC,"I would take that! Doesn't sound like any of your fanmates would agree though. Which ""bad contract"" would you have in mind?"

OttawaSenators,39gvp0,zdelusion,2,Fri Jun 12 18:35:16 2015 UTC,the only way I see hoff going anywhere is if he is packaged with one of our goalies to get a legit top six forward....I don't think any of the players you listed would get it done for Ottawa.
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,mike-kt,2,Thu Jun 11 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"Crosby, Malkin, and a first rounder! (/s)  In seriousness, I'd rather Sens management didn't entertain the idea of trading some of our younger guys who did so well last year unless they make completely unrealistic contract demands."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,thelawnmower_man,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"It would probably take a pretty decent offer. Hoff had 27 goals last year and that doesn't come cheap ever. We'd probably mostly be interested in a package deal where we trade Hoff+one of our 3-4th liners and a pick for top line/top 4 talent.   He's got low ice time because he's a mixed bag of skills. But, he's got an absolutely wicked shot. If he gets scoring chances he tends to put them away. He had a bit of a cold streak at the end of the regular season and spent some time on the 4th line just because we had so many players who were on a roll. He looked ok in the playoffs though."
OttawaSenators,39gvp0,thelawnmower_man,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"Our current trade chips are:   Beau Bennett (Top-6 FWD, who's been continuously put in situations to fail. Has unreal Hockey IQ, Dan Bylsma fucked up his development, needs change of scenery) Chris Kunitz (Aging, probably not Top-6 anymore, but he's borderline and would upgrade any 3rd line in the league) Brandon Sutter (Top PIT trade chip, 3C who loves shorthanded goals, could be 2nd line presence with the right kind of wingers) Brian Dumoulin (Top-4 Defensive Prospect, Big, Skilled, he and his linemate allowed only 4 even strength goals in the AHL last season) Scott Harrington (Top-4 Defensive Prospect, invisible in a good way. Ridiculously reliable and smart, mostly stay-at-home type) Ben Lovejoy (Top-4 Defensemen from Anaheim that didn't work out in PIT)"

OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,6,Thu Jun 11 13:42:32 2015 UTC,I really hate all this talk of trading the Hoff.
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,matty323,9,Thu Jun 11 12:25:11 2015 UTC,I do and don't. If we trade him simply to drop a bad contract then I am not happy. If we trade him for a legit top4 pick and dropping a bad contract I'm happy.
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,peskysens,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:30:52 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.  Gun to my head and I have to pick Hoff or Stone it's an easy choice and we're going to have to give up SOMETHING to get a decent top4/top6.
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,6,Thu Jun 11 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"Yup.   Would I love to keep Hoff? Of course. But if it's for the better good, then we are going to have to move an asset. And I would rather keep Zibby/Lazar/Stone/Ceci etc and move Hoff.   I wouldn't want to move Hoff it meant getting another forward unless it was an obvious upgrade right now, but would rather them move him for a D man to help out"
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,peskysens,2,Thu Jun 11 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"If we move Hoff for a d-man, our problem is just switched from missing a top-4 dman to missing a top 6 winger"
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,shining_,2,Thu Jun 11 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"This is going to be controversial but Hoffman isn't a top 6 on any other playoff team.  He was only top 6 on our team because we didn't have anyone else.  Did he take it and run with it? Yes.  But, he and Hammond are in the same boat.  They played exceptional last season, but we still don't know if it's a streak or a trend.  Honestly, you could say the same for Stone."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:27:55 2015 UTC,What about Hoffman's game do you expect to regress? Shooting percentage? That makes sense. Shot generation and CF%? Much less likely to significantly decline.   Hoff is a good player.
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,mike-kt,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:55:36 2015 UTC,I'm not saying he isn't a good player and I don't want to get rid of him.  I would just be more comfortable if he or stone had the ability to move either of them down to the 3rd line without forcing them to play on a line that prevents them from succeeding.
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to say you would like him to have the ability to play on the 3rd line without seeing a drop in production? Your sentence is hard to understand.   If that is what you mean, it's an unrealistic goal for most players. Reducing the quality of teammates and the amount of icetime will negatively affect production."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,mike-kt,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:02:25 2015 UTC,I guess you're right.  It's a chicken/egg argument.  I guess his small sample size and end of year drop off make me skeptical that he's going to get 50pts again next season.  I just like having our bases covered.
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:53:56 2015 UTC,"I think we have far more forward depth to work with. Puempel/Prince. Pages u can move up. If we can't move Legwand he will need a slot.   But we have maybe 1 D we can bring up who may potentially be of that calibre in Weidman.   I also believe there are more forwards available via other ways (Sharp for a pick, Williams in ufa etc) than there are D.   It's going to be interesting one way or another."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,peskysens,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:29:59 2015 UTC,"I would not do that. I believe hoffman IS a top 4 top 6, player. If we trade him, we will regret it. The team is young. I would rather draft some strong talent, than trade for someone decent who is getting older and will only serve for a short while."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Akoustyk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"Listen, I felt the same when I heard we gave up Silfverberg for Bobby Ryan.  I, too, was overvaluing our prospects based on a small sample size. My friend put my mind at ease.  He explained it to me this way: ""What you have done is gotten Bobby Ryan for a player that could very well be the next Bobby Ryan.""  Hoffman could be very good one day but, best case scenario, that's still probably a fiddy/fiddy chance."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,2,Thu Jun 11 21:38:10 2015 UTC,Silverberg had an amazing playoff and a pretty good season (his development was halted by the Cowen slash that broke his wrist). He is very well on his way to be the player he was projected to be. (And Silfverberg is 1 year younger than Hoffman)
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,sex_panther_by_odeon,0,Fri Jun 12 01:41:59 2015 UTC,"For one, Bobby Ryan, has not yet turned out to be as advertised, so that really was not a good example on your part, and two, I know what hoffman is like, he has actually made a bigger difference for the sens than bobby ryan did. I like hoffman the first second I saw him on the ice at the start of last season.   It's not what he might become, it is what he is. He is a rookie, who are you gonna trade him for that's worth it? Not just worth it, but that will have as many years in him?   I just don't like to give up hoffman. I don't think it is prudent. I think it would be a bad decision. I mean, obviously, for the right player, but the right player is hard to find. Once teams get the right player, they don't really want to give them up.   Look at the blackhawks. They had a great core of young guys, and that took them a long way. We don't quite have that strong of a core right now, but the way you build an amazing team is to draft amazing and hold on to those young good guys and build a kickass team around them.   We could do that. It's always a gamble every trade you make, unless you get really someone special. I mean, spezza is a great center. But he was not doing well on our team, so it is not even a sure thing a lot of the time, case and point as well, like I said, Bobby Ryan. Bobby Ryan wasn't some offensive force to be reckoned with. You're still talking about what you think he will end up being, which is still prospecting.   You can think Hoffman has a 50/50 chance of being a good player or being a poor one if you want to, I don't think that's the case. I think he will be a great player to have on any fast young team. Or any team that could use some speed.   There is no way I would ever give him up for anything less than a really strong forward and a first rounder. But nobody would give that up for him. Nobody wants to give away a good player in their prime.   Right now, forward-wise, for me, the ones that I don't think would be possible to get a deal I would deal them at, would be mcarthur, Turris, Hoffman, Karlsson, obviously, and stone. I wouldn't move bobby ryan necessarily either, for a few reasons, but I am not comfortable with that contract, and I worry that it will come back to haunt us. But I don't think it was necessarily a poor signing.   Everyone else, I think a deal could be made. But to me, dealing hoffman, would be like dealing sharp or kane in their rookie year. I wouldn't do it."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Akoustyk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"Listen, I'm not saying ""omfg he's going to regress get rid of him"".  I just foresee us needing to make a trade to make happen what we need to.  I feel like people still seem to think that you can fleece any GM you want just like it's NHL15.  If we want something good in a trade we're going to have to pay for it.  Any team that knows anything about Ottawa would follow in Anaheim's footsteps and demand that we give up one of our young guys.  So who do you give up?  Lazar? Ceci? Stone?!    You say you wouldn't give up Hoffman unless we got a really strong forward and a first rounder.  Murray has said that he's after just that.  In my ideal world we get to keep everyone too, but I don't think that's going to happen."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:21:09 2015 UTC,"No gm will give a strong forward and a first rounder for Hoffman.   Obviously you have to trade value for value. So, one of our goaltenders is what we have and should give up.   Anderson or lehner. I would deal Anderson I think, even though I think he is the best goaltender for us right now, I think he might be peaking at the wrong time for us.   It depends on the predicted timeline for O'Conner.   But when you get a good young guy, you hold onto him imo.  Ya, I would deal Lazar before I would deal Hoffman, even with his size. He doesn't really use it much anyway.  Not stone though, ceci maybe but were talking forwards.   I like the sens team right now except for up front. I would look to deal one of our goalies for a draft pick, and/or someone like zibanejad. It again depends on the draft choices available, which I'm not familiar with.   But if I gave up Hoffman for a draft, I would just be hoping to draft a player like Hoffman. That would make no sense."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Akoustyk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:50:57 2015 UTC,One of the young guys like Hoffman would be just one piece in a trade for a strong forward/1st rounder not the only piece . That said I don't think we're ever going to agree just based on your player choices and knowing my own personal preferences.    In your scenario who is our 2nd C if you deal Zibanejad?
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:07:18 2015 UTC,"I would deal zibanejad if I could get a good enough draft pick to select a center that could play almost immediately. And they could duke it out for the number one center spot with turris.   Turris is a great center, and a player I like on my team. I wanna keep him. But I want a better number one center.  Again, its not because zibanejad isn't good, you have to give something to get something. This isn't NHL 2015 ;)"
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Akoustyk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:08:43 2015 UTC,Why not just sign a top 4 D? There are a handful available. Easiest decision is to dump bad contracts and sign the RFAs and a UFA. There's no requirement to trade Hoff or Stone.
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,mike-kt,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I'm not really worried about our D in this conversation.  I'm more concerned about our forward lines.  Stone and Hoff on the top two lines are fine.  My issue is that on the bottom 2 lines I'm not really comfortable with anyone other than Lazar and Pageau  (Michalek if he keeps playing like he finished the season but that's unlikely if he's bumped back down to line 3)  I feel like Stone or Hoff could play on the 3rd line and really boost it.  Then our bottom line of some combination of Neil/Smith/Legwand/Chiasson we can just never speak of."
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,Ubuhio,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:31:49 2015 UTC,"Lazar Pageau and Michalek are a good 3rd line (assuming Condra isn't re-signed), 4th line of Prince Smith and Chiasson isn't terrible.   Sens can't compete with only 4 capable D even if their forward lines have an extra player (and why worry about adding a forward piece when they could just resign Condra to improve that 3rd line?).   Boro and Gryba can't play together. Improving that situation is way better bang for your buck"
OttawaSenators,39dxfb,mike-kt,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:58:24 2015 UTC,I honestly believe that ottawa would be very well served to get a top6 forward and a top4 D this off season.  I haven't been talking about D because this was a conversation about forward line combinations.  I would agree that our Defense is a bigger issue to be dealt with this off season than our Offense.

OttawaSenators,39bnps,scienceraven,8,Sat Jun 13 23:24:54 2015 UTC,I think they'll get a good offer from the Blues for Anderson.  It's a perfect scenario.  Anderson's the best available goalie out there for a team that needs to win right now.
OttawaSenators,39bnps,BottledBarf,3,Wed Jun 10 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"We can't afford is contract. We have to pay Tarasenko, Allen and few other UFA. It all depends if Elliot request a trade or not"

OttawaSenators,39bnps,BottledBarf,17,Wed Jun 10 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"Every team wants to win, but not every team is a Cup contender.  ""Winning"" changes depending on where you're at.  Right now, for Ottawa, I'd say a winning season was making the playoffs.  For the Blues it's a finals appearance, at least.  I think when you have a bunch of your best players in their prime, and signed under the cap, there's a lot of urgency to do everything in your power to win a championship even if you mortgage the future a bit.  St. Louis has been called a contender for about five years and they've done nothing in the playoffs, and I think part of that reason is goaltending.  I mean, Brian Elliot doesn't scare anybody."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,ToiletTroublez,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"For the blues, it's a cup. Its absurd to even think that making the finals and not winning would be considered anything outside of a failure IF the team is considered a true contender."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,Omega613,8,Thu Jun 11 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"Doesn't every team need/want to win right now?   Not necessarily. Or rather, in an ideal world, yes, but that's not where we live. Many teams are undergoing rebuilds and have younger players that still need time before they're at their 'peak'. Conversely, a team like the Blues have great (and established) depth right now thanks to a number of veteran players on larger contracts (eg. Stastny, Steen, Backes, Boumeester, Oshie) in combination with some younger high ceiling players who are performing well and on ELCs/cheap bridge cotracts(eg. Tarsenko, Schwartz, Shattenkirk). Soon (1-2 years) the latter group of players will require new bigger contracts and they will no longer have the cap/roster space to keep everyone, likely meaning members of the former group will need to be traded.  That means their current window of great depth is basically one or two more seasons due to salary cap constraints (and in some other cases players aging and becoming less effective). If they don't get a cup within that time span, then they have to rely on their lost depth being filled with free agent signings and current prospects/picks panning out - and that's hardly a guarantee (prospects and signed players flop more often than they prosper). All in all, this means that their best foreseeable chance at a cup is ""now"", and since goaltending (in critical situations) has seemingly been their biggest downfall, they need to address this problem or their current window may pass without success.  By contrast, look at the Sabres. They have virtually no established high-level players outside of a select few (mostly just Ennis, Kane, and Bogosian if we're generous). They're not a playoff contender at the moment, let alone a cup contender. There are three main sources of acquiring players - draft, free agency, and trade. All 3 have a major downside which makes it tough for a team in Buffalo's current position to suddenly become the Blackhawks in one off-season (draft: takes time to develop and players may not pan out, free agency: expen$ive and can't conform to salary cap, trade: have to give up good players to get good players which is usually used to trade from an area of depth to address area of weakness). So in essence, they are not in ""win now"" mode at all because they simply can't manage it. Their best option right now is to draft well and focus of prospect development. In a few years when said players begin to show their respective ceilings (some will boom, some will bust), then it will make more sense to go to free agency or trade and try to pick up players which address the needs of the team. If Buffalo, for example, traded for Anderson and gave up their second 1st rounder (21st overall) then their goal-tending would be good while the rest of their team is not, likely doing nothing for them, and in the process they would give up a potentially good player several years from now. But on the flip side Lehner is young and likely still a season or two away from really showing his best/most consistent performances, so by the time he's ""good"" the rest of the Sabres prospects may be in the same boat. They are in a ""win later"" mode right now.  Only one team can win a cup each season, and to give your team the best chance you want your forwards, defense, and goaltending groups to all be strong and in their respective primes near the same time. If not, you'll be stuck in mediocrity. A player like Anderson is good now and will likely begin to crash after a couple more seasons - so a team with a good group now and in the near future (in need of goaltending) would make a great fit for Anderson."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,WigginsEnder,3,Wed Jun 10 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"That's a step price for a goaltender, if you look at the return for goaltenders in trades in the past few years it's all over the map.  Expect a B level prospect or a 2nd rounder.    You might get both for Lenher.  But if you look at what LA got for Bernier it was fringe winger & a 2nd"
OttawaSenators,39bnps,Beardslyy,3,Thu Jun 11 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah but for the Bernier trade, it  would be the equivalent if we tried to trade Hammond IMO.  Bernier was a backup his entire time with Quick as his teammate."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,hughtankman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:02:28 2015 UTC,"Disagree, Lehner hasn't proven much more than Bernier. At this point, Andy brings back a much larger return then Robin, despite his high potential. Goalie development is far from linear and extremely volatile, which is why goalies like Bobrovsky, Bernier, Bishop (twice), kiprusoff, etc. have returned so little in the past. For every one of those, there's a Raycroft, Toskala, Carey, etc."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,Beardslyy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:25:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Andy is a proven veteran starter.  Apparently the Blues want him, and for some reason I like that a lot"
OttawaSenators,39bnps,sex_panther_by_odeon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:37:13 2015 UTC,"If you look at Lehner statistically, he has had 1 good season in the past few years (including AHL numbers). And Lehner hasn't proved he can be anything but an average backup.  When Bernier was traded, he had great numbers as a backup and showed promise to be a number 1 goalie."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,Beardslyy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:38:22 2015 UTC,"If you look at Lehner, he just surpassed the 82 game mark this year. Also Bernier was in a way better position being on a much more skilled LA Kings team"
OttawaSenators,39bnps,Arayvenn,3,Fri Jun 12 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"Don't get too excited. This is just a platform to negotiate from, we'll never get this return. Average prospect or a bottom six player + a 2nd rounder more likely. Personally, I'm not sure why we aren't targetting a defenseman."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,Jthedude17,2,Thu Jun 11 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"I'd like to just find a solid 25-32 year old defenseman to help steady the blue line for a couple years until Englund, Harper, Claesson, Wideman, and/or Wikstrand are ready to play. As much as I like Borowiecki and Gryba for their physical play and defensive role, we can find better options. Those two are good for now, but long term we need something a little different"
OttawaSenators,39bnps,Chiefboss22,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:52:17 2015 UTC,"Seems Wideman will either play in Ottawa this year, or sign elsewhere. We will probably lose him given the current logjam"
OttawaSenators,39bnps,I_AM_TESLA,5,Thu Jun 11 04:44:29 2015 UTC,Can't wait to find out that the young player is a scrub who plays on our fourth line and the draft pick is going to be a 4th. I just know we're going to get fleeced on this trade.
OttawaSenators,39bnps,PaddleDown,7,Wed Jun 10 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"You can't really say either way... we've had some outstanding success with late players that couldn't be predicted (Stone, Hoffman) and we (like every team) have had our share of high-pick flops as well. The 4th-rounder we got in the Bishop  trade turned into Tobias Lindberg and it's far too early to judge him at this time, but he's the highest rated prospect on our RW at the moment talent-wise. There's no reason to assume we're going to get fleeced, especially since we're in a position of power and can sit on 3 netminders if we absolutely have to."
OttawaSenators,39bnps,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Wed Jun 10 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"So many things point to trading Anderson.    Ottawa Senators had one of the lowest average ages of any teams that made the playoffs. Take into consideration that Phillips, Legwand and Greening were all healthy scratches and it reduced the average age again by almost a year, I think I worked out the average age was close to 25 on this roster. Anderson, 34, or Lehner, 23. Who fits in better in this situation?    Direct quote from a league executive : ""When you make goalie trades do you actually get full value?"" Lehner having the higher overall value, but you won't actually get that entire value in return. So would you rather trade away the more valuable piece and get less than expected in return? Or the less valuable piece and get less in return? Or rather, who would you hold on to when you know there will be a value loss in the trade?  Finally, the mention of Talbot and Lack on the market, which saturates the market a bit more. However, if any team is unwilling to take a chance on someone young and unproven, and they are looking for a veteran that's something Ottawa can offer with Anderson. Lehner fits in with young and inexperienced just like Talbot/Lack.    My personal opinion, I would love to see both Lehner and Anderson in Ottawa next year, there was a big commitment to Hammond after a very short, but very spectacular run. I don't agree with telling Hammond if he signs that means someone else will go, which is what I'm told happened, but I've never heard the organization say. To me Hammond is the least valuable goaltender of the 3.    In my ideal world we'd see the Anderson/Lehner competition continue, and the contracts signed last year? or the year before? would continue as the timeline. With a huge stroke of luck, we'd have Anderson for a season or two more, just as O'Conner is graduating from the AHL and is ready to backup Lehner.    (Hedging my bets: I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'll gladly give up a package deal to make a splash for a big name trade in Ottawa. I'm okay with seeing a goaltender go if its part of a bigger overall package to bring some top end, prime aged talent into Ottawa. I don't think one of Ottawa goaltenders alone could ever do that though.)"
OttawaSenators,39bnps,mike-kt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"yes, i'm in the same boat. Anderson Lehner is the least risky duo and I'd rather they trade Hammond."

OttawaSenators,39bnps,OfficialGreenkid,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"A player that I wonder about in these scenarios is Kyle Turris.

OttawaSenators,39bnps,Akoustyk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:18:34 2015 UTC,"I would easily get a prospect for a number 1 center. Then I'd let Turris and my number 1 prospect duke it out for the number one spot. And let the competition duke it out for the other spots also.   But I'd be happy doing that with pretty much any of our forwards. We good forwards that I wouldn't necessarily want to give up, but if I could add to my team, and have more depth and bump someone out, I'd be very interested in doing that.   Especially if the sens can deal for a forward pick that they can put on the ice right away.   That would be tough though, and you gotta think that would be one of our goalies in the trade. Which would kind of suck, but I think it is the right thing to do.   Goalie is a hugely important position though. It would be a bit of a gamble, but I think it would be good decision. If the player drafted is good enough."

Now, I haven't seen him play nor seen anything aside from basic stats so I don't know if he's worth pursuing.

I know nothing about him (please let me know what you know), and even if he never makes the NHL he could be a great AHL asset given how rough the Bingo team's defensive side was this year. If his game translates well to the pros O'Connor/Driedger would be happy to have him I'm sure :P"
OttawaSenators,38xccd,Omega613,5,Sun Jun 7 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"Google tells me:    6'4'' 216 pounds, 22 years old.     Missed the entire 2012-13 season recovering from injuries resulting from an off-the-ice incident.  Clarkson Golden Knights sophomore defenceman Kevin Tansey, 19, suffered a shoulder injury, three cracked ribs and a concussion in an assault on July 31 in Ottawa, according to a media release from the school in Potsdam, N.Y.   2011 draft eligible, and went undrafted. One Bruins blog wrote that he could be a late round sleeper:    ""We don't have a scouting report on him yet, but understand he's a mobile shutdown D with some emerging offensive potential. He's a big hitter and can fight, too. Raw, but highly interesting player well under the radar right now.""     PIM heavy stats, and he was invited to the development camp in Ottawa last summer.     Most recent report I could find, from March 18th 2015:     Kevin Tansey, Defence, Clarkson Golden Knights, Junior-Redshirt, (6’4″ 216 lbs)  The 22-year-old Tansey redshirted due to injury during his sophomore season, and so even though he has just finished his fourth year of college, he has one year of eligibility remaining if he chooses not to sign a pro contract.  He’s got excellent size and uses it to play a robust defensive game.  Tansey loves to hit, and if a forward comes down his side of the ice with his head down, he can expect to pay the price.  He also blocks shots, and cuts down passing lanes with a long stick.  Tansey keeps the front of the Clarkso net clear, and this is welcomed by his coaches and goaltenders.  He is a decent skater for a big man, but don’t expect a lot of offence out of the 22-year-old."

I trust the coaches to be able to fix any glaring weaknesses (if the player has the right attitude) like they did with Stone. There's a reason the Sens hit on a lot of late round picks and it's not all scouting. Sens player development is really good so give them a guy with size and toughness and I think they can fill in the rest, especially if all you're after is a bottom pair d."
OttawaSenators,38xccd,RichMilk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"umm. Hoffman and Kane play forward, its way easier to be a small forward than a small D.  Also Kessel is fucking tank???

OttawaSenators,38xccd,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Sun Jun 7 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"Lets also be fair here, Phillips' career is all but over, Gryba is expendable and Cowen has very little rope left if any, no idea what our prospect pool on D looks like after Claesson and Wideman so it's a solid pickup if we get him, heck he may even play a few games"
OttawaSenators,38xccd,kenata88,0,Mon Jun 8 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"Harpur and Englund (on the surface) seem like similar players.   The cost is the money and that Clarkson will count towards the team's 50-man roster limit. Not huge costs, not huge rewards either."

OttawaSenators,38p0iy,mike-kt,-9,Tue Jun 9 15:05:08 2015 UTC,uhhh with Andy we were 14th place
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,Br3N8,4,Sat Jun 6 17:34:52 2015 UTC,and with Hammond we're embarrassingly swept in the first round. We still lost in the first round I know but Anderson was lights out and one of the main reasons we even made that a series
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,crabbai,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:16:59 2015 UTC,"Uhhh...I'm sorry, but it had nothing to do with Anderson. Even when Hammond was in net, he let in a lot of goals. We just scored more than the other team. Our defence sucked last year."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,On_Letting_Go,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:12:16 2015 UTC,Didn't Hammond have one of the best goals against average? For his short time he definitely didn't let in that many goals...
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:25:46 2015 UTC,"He definitely was good. At the beginning all his adrenaline carried over to the rest of the team I think.

OttawaSenators,38p0iy,Voljjin,8,Tue Jun 9 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that they ignored the Andrew Raycroft trade in the article.  But it's true, the return on Andy or Lehner will not be what fans here are hoping for."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,tornfightstrap,3,Fri Jun 5 17:42:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think the team needs to get a huge return for the goalie trade, IMO they just need to package some bad contracts with Andy/Lehner and clear up their cap space. That is valuable enough in many ways even if it lowers the return to just a draft pick or two."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,Ariachne,7,Fri Jun 5 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"Although I generally agree with your statement, Spezza asked for a trade which handcuffed Murray into making a worse deal than he would've liked."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,BigRiggety,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"A lot of trades are luck.   All it takes is one team to really want a player for the return to be great. Nashville was that team last year with Spezza, they apparently offered a package that included the 11th overall pick but Spezza wouldn't waive his NTC."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,tornfightstrap,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:32:56 2015 UTC,"And now we have 3 goalies, which handcuffs them into making a worse deal then they want."

OttawaSenators,38p0iy,mike-kt,2,Sat Jun 6 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"There is plenty stopping them from doing it.   Senators management has said they could go into training camp with three goalies, there is a difference between training camp and the season. I also think they are being a bit deceptive when they say that in order to prevent teams from thinking they can kick the tires with low ball offers because the Senators have to give in and move one goalie.  The Senators have 7 defenders on 1-way contracts. They have Cody Ceci who isn't going back to the AHL. Carrying three goalies would mean that they would be unable to carry any forwards as healthy scratches, or that they'd have to waive one of their defenders. It is just not going to happen."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,pasky,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:35:17 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of free agency moves left to be made before the start of the season which would free up a spot for 3 Gs on the roster. Chiasson is an RFA this year, do you really see GMBM making a trade for one of our guys in net at less than market value just to resign him or Phillips or Gryba to complete the roster? That doesn't make any sense.  Listen, I can understand the point of various guys on this sub, that Goalies don't fetch as big a return as solid Fwds/Dmen, but to suggest that we're handcuffed into making a bad trade is ludicrous. The position we're in is that we currently have 3 starting goalies which every team needs to compete. The smart thing to do is to keep them all well into the season until maybe a contending team loses a G due to injury and their value goes up. If that means letting Gryba or Chiasson go due to Free Agency and rolling with one fewer Healthy Scratch on either D or Fwd, then we do it. Feeling like we have to trade anyone is a mistake"
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,ftardontherun,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:29:52 2015 UTC,"Right. Hammond's contract added just over $1m, the team has a lot of dead wood to clear out before that $1m is going to be the straw that breaks their back."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:06:50 2015 UTC,4G is even better!
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,TheKandyCinema,6,Sat Jun 6 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Look at the Spezza deal from last year. People expected a legit top 6 FW, top prospect and a 1st.    Anyone who expected that didn't understand contracts.  Spezza had one year to UFA, so it's not like we traded a decade of Spezza for that haul.  Yes, he signed a new deal there, he also could have walked.  I actually think we got pretty decent value for 1 season of Spezza, even though Chiasson has been disappointing.  For contrast, we paid a lot more (a little too much in my opinion) for two years of Bobby Ryan.  I agree with your main point, either goalie alone is not going to fetch a huge haul.  I wouldn't mind see a package, something like Andy + Hoffman + Smith + pick for Eberle or something like that.  But I think Andy or Lehner on their own might fetch a 2nd rounder, depth D or a 3/4 line forward."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,morphotik,4,Fri Jun 5 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've long thought that if a goalie had to go combined with the team saying they want a top 6 FW then Hoffman might be the odd man out, which I'm totally fine with. I wonder what a package of say Anderson, Hoffman, Greening (salary dump) would get in return. I think it would be decent."
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,Chiefboss22,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:22:52 2015 UTC,Why trade Hoffman though? Why not expect a mediocre return and stuff as many bad contracts into that trade as possible.
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,tornfightstrap,4,Tue Jun 9 15:08:18 2015 UTC,People always want the best for their teams. I'm expecting Braun and a 3rd or a 2nd for Anderson.
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,21syn,2,Fri Jun 5 18:42:57 2015 UTC,I would assume that if we were to get a top 6 forward or top pairing D man that it would be in a package deal. Not straight up.
OttawaSenators,38p0iy,shining_,2,Fri Jun 5 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed but then we're looking at giving up a blue chip kid for that. Something like Anderson, Lazar, B/C level prospect, pick for say Shattenkirk. Not happening."

OttawaSenators,38ofof,jmontelpare,6,Sun Jun 7 00:37:30 2015 UTC,"I think Braun is a very reasonable target for Ottawa to target. In his prime and he's a top 4 defenseman we need. And if we trade Anderson, it'll give them a proven starter and clear up a more expensive contract for them rather than giving up less in Demers. I think Braun and maybe either a 2nd or a 3rd for Anderson could be a possible trade."
OttawaSenators,38ofof,TheKandyCinema,2,Fri Jun 5 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"It's seems as though GMBM has already taken this lack of available defensemen into account, and see improving our forwards as a much easier place to be improving, rather than spending money and assets on a defense player that may or may not work out on our current line-up. With all the talk of forwards like Malkin, Nash and Oshie possibly becoming available, I think that Ottawa wants to return to it's days as a fearsome offensive force."
OttawaSenators,38ofof,stompinstevo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:42:42 2015 UTC,"Why are you using PDO? That's more of a team stat, as its heavily influenced by goaltending and luck.

OttawaSenators,38ofof,3thoughts,2,Fri Jun 5 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"You're right in the sense that I should have added shooting percentages, but I included PDO to see if goalie performance had an effect on their underlying numbers in general.  Demers: 6.87 SH% Braun: 7.5% Stuart: 6.78%"

Both of these D are young but they've shown they can play. I'd be happy with a more proven player, but there's a really good chance the goalie trade is with Edmonton and you gotta dance with what you've got.   I bet Edmonton values Klefbom a lot higher than Marincin, but for so many good reasons I don't follow that team.   There's also the possibility of getting a pretty good D in UFA, there are a lot out there this year and the cap situation for a lot of teams is dicey, pushing down prices."

OttawaSenators,38ofof,peskysens,0,Fri Jun 5 16:09:53 2015 UTC,"What about a Seidenberg trade from Boston? He is a methot style guy with lots of experience, could pair really well with Ceci or Weir. And because Boston needs to move cap we could potentially get him for very little, something like Seidenberg + Bos 2nd for Gryba + OTT 6th"
OttawaSenators,38ofof,peskysens,4,Fri Jun 5 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"Don't really want to pay a 33-year old 12 million over the next 3 years. The guy is also a negative possession player, with a 48.3 CF%. That's Jared Cowen territory right there"
OttawaSenators,38ofof,Omega613,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:30:46 2015 UTC,age is irrelevant to me. There are many very very good D in that age range.   I was looking at it as we could easily get him and a 2/3rd for like our 6th.   I feel there are going to be a lot of disappointed Ottawa fans next year who are expecting us to get Burns or something.
OttawaSenators,38nphn,Dk_krypton,27,Fri Jun 5 11:56:57 2015 UTC,I can't see NYR wanting to take on Lehner or Andy when they've got a solid starter and an up and coming backup who's already proved himself this season.
OttawaSenators,38nphn,Tundra66,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:13:08 2015 UTC,"That makes the trade a lot harder to swing. We'd probably have to do a roster player+prospect+1st rounder like we did for Ryan. But I don't think we have the depth of prospects we had then so it probably would be ill-advised. That said Nash for 3 years would be sick, that's a nice window that wouldn't destroy the team's cap space long term."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,zdelusion,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:20:56 2015 UTC,I agree with this.
OttawaSenators,38nphn,TheKandyCinema,17,Fri Jun 5 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, please God, no Rick Nash.  Besides, he didn't want to come here a few years ago right?  He seems to clearly be on the decline, has a huge price tag, and has looked completely worn out in the past two playoffs.  Nash could become one of the biggest anchors in the NHL salary-wise.  I realize he had 42 goals this year but from what I saw he was invisible when it really mattered.  We've already got Bobby Ryan at $7 million a year to motivate, why add a similar player with similar issues?  Edit:  grammar"
OttawaSenators,38nphn,BottledBarf,3,Fri Jun 5 13:24:24 2015 UTC,How can you say he is on the decline when he just had his best season in years?
OttawaSenators,38nphn,Jaycorr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:20:06 2015 UTC,And he had a number of disappointing seasons prior to that. I don't expect him to suddenly start playing like he did in his mid-20s again for multiple seasons.
OttawaSenators,38nphn,JumpedAShark,2,Sun Jun 7 00:23:14 2015 UTC,Are you watching the same hockey that everyone else is watching?  Rich Nash had the most complete season of his career last year.
OttawaSenators,38nphn,braken,0,Fri Jun 5 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"Obviously he had a good year.  I suppose I should have said that he's not getting any better and I don't think that if we added Rick Nash we'd be that much closer to being a contender with our young players.  But from what I saw in the playoffs, yeah, I think he's starting to slow down, even with the 42 goals."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,BottledBarf,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think that if we added Rick Nash we'd be that much closer to being a contender with our young players.   I'm with you all the way on this.  I'm not a huge fan of bringing him over, regardless of how I feel about his play last season.    What I did see last year, was that this guy has really picked up his overall game.  He played like a veteran, no mistakes, was a killer on both the PK and PP, and just looked like a leader out there.  I don't know that he'll be able to maintain his current production, but if he goes to a team that's a bit more mature, he could be a deal breaker.  I just really liked watching him last year.  He's always been such a shark around the net, and adding some depth to his game was fun to follow."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,braken,3,Fri Jun 5 20:54:13 2015 UTC,Rick Nash is an elite player and has been his entire career.  It's unlikely we'd be willing to pay the price NYR would want for him.
OttawaSenators,38nphn,On_Letting_Go,3,Fri Jun 5 13:29:40 2015 UTC,I don't think New York is interested in Andy/Lehner while they're shopping Talbot...
OttawaSenators,38nphn,Arayvenn,2,Sat Jun 6 08:52:09 2015 UTC,"Hear me out here - it is admittedly a bit of a tin-foil hat idea.  How would you guys react to a trade like this year's 1st, Mike Hoffman, and Robin Lehner for Rick Nash?   This could allow New York to deal Talbot to a team like Edmonton, while getting a goalie that can serve as Lundqvist's understudy as he progresses through his 30s. New York can afford to wait on Lehner to develop while Hank eventually meets a slow dropoff.   Mike Hoffman serves as the direct replacement for Rick Nash on New York. He seems to be a player they'd love, speedy with a good shot. I'm not sure if the 1st is overkill, but it should serve to add value for a guy who's a Team Canada Olympian.  This trade would completely stack up Ottawa's top 6, and possibly give us something like...  MacArthur - Turris - Nash  Ryan - Zibanejad - Ryan  Food for thought."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,JeffSENS,2,Fri Jun 5 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"I heard you out.  Where does Stone fit in?   And in two year's we'll be talking about ""how we need a real top line center to help Nash out.."" Columbus had the same issues before trading him to NY.   I can't agree with you, sorry Jeff."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,Grambo92,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"I like your thinking.. But I still don't see NYR trading Talbot for someone from Edmonton. And then take in a goalie from us, with Hoffman, and a 1st. For Nash. There's also the issue of our own cap.   I don't think Nash is going anywhere from NYR. Doesn't seem likely."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,mike-kt,2,Sat Jun 6 12:57:09 2015 UTC,"That's the Rangers way of saying, ""We'll trade him if there's a sucker out there who wants to take on his ridiculous contract in his decline years so they can watch him under-perform in the playoffs instead of us."""
OttawaSenators,38nphn,benches48,3,Mon Jun 8 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"Last time Nash was up for sale I thought about it this way:  If Nash was a UFA, would you be happy with the Sens signing him to a 3 year, $7.8m contract.   If you would have reservations about that, why even entertain the idea of trading value for him? I am a fan of paying for talent, but I see that contract and I think the Sens could sign Franson and Condra for that amount easily. I think that's a better use of the money for the Sens.   Biggest priorities this off-season are trading away bad players, resigning RFAs, getting another top 4 D, retaining Condra. After that, sure try to grab a better forward than our top 6. Sens need to prioritize is all I'm saying."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,Jaycorr,3,Fri Jun 5 13:21:24 2015 UTC,"GMBM needs to focus on the fourth line, not our top 6. We're good for now, hopefully Hoffy and Stone get better, but our fourth line sucks shit completely."
OttawaSenators,38nphn,InTURRISting,9,Fri Jun 5 12:18:46 2015 UTC,Getting a top six will inherently push someone down the depth chart making the bottom six better as well.

OttawaSenators,38iqwc,Kidparkinsons,11,Thu Jun 4 14:14:14 2015 UTC,Great news. Now we're certain we can trade Anderson for some great value.
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,TheKandyCinema,-3,Thu Jun 4 15:57:53 2015 UTC,Sarcasm? Andy is staying put. Lehner is going
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,GilmerInSpace,6,Thu Jun 4 16:35:31 2015 UTC,That is incorrect.  Our prophet Owls has forseen the future.  Anderson will be traded.
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,On_Letting_Go,13,Thu Jun 4 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"Trading Anderson is a much smarter choice. You'll get more value for Anderson which is what we need. Rather if we were to trade Lehner, we'd get like a 3rd round pick and a prospect. Trading Lehner advances us nowhere in the league. People here over value Lehner too much."
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,TheKandyCinema,3,Thu Jun 4 16:42:17 2015 UTC,problem is people think the sens are actually a contending team right now. they forget the sens were a bottom 5 in the league until the fluke record setting run at the end of the year.
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,twist2002,4,Thu Jun 4 20:55:01 2015 UTC,People here over value Lehner too much.   ..so we should make him our starter for the next few years?  signing O'Connor and Hammond made it pretty clear it's Lehner that is on the way out.
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,Funkativity,15,Thu Jun 4 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"signing O'Connor and Hammond made it pretty clear it's Lehner that is on the way out.   I disagree, I think both of those moves do nothing to confirm or deny that possibility. O'Connor is 1-2 years away if we're optimistic/generous, and there's nothing that guarantees he'll ever be an NHL goalie (we all hope he will be, but it's far from a lock). He's a great piece to have for depth with good potential upside, but ultimately he's just an over-aged prospect who's not ready now and not a sure thing for the future (no more so than Driedger or Hogberg, for example).  Hammond has proven himself capable of playing in the NHL, with some big question marks about repeatability in his performance, especially over a physically taxing NHL season. He was signed as a backup quality 'tender with a cap hit to match - he has little bearing on the starter role regardless of who takes the position. He's middle aged, but given his experience level probably has a little bit of room for growth/development still attainable.  Either way we're without a bonafide NHL starter for near future with those two, and we also have no young proven goalie for the future. Those two roles could be filled by Anderson and Lehner, respectively. Although it would be a gamble, Lehner could theoretically fill both roles, while Andy can only (at best) fill one and would force us to instead gamble on O'Connor's development.  Either way, we're rolling the dice and I fail to see how Hammond/O'Connor signings influence the fact that Andy is the safer bet long term for the franchise. Either you make the gamble in keeping Lehner under the assumption the he (in tandem with Hammond) can be a starter in the near future, or you make the bet in keeping Anderson and assume that O'Connor (or Driedger/Hogberg) reaches the point of showing at least as much potential in the NHL as Lehner. Both options have big merit and big risk. I don't envy Murray's job in the matter, and my current opinion leans more toward keeping Lehner, but seeing the possible returns would likely influence that decision greatly (especially since either one would fetch interest from different teams in different situations). Now I'm going beyond the scope of your comment though :P"
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,Omega613,5,Thu Jun 4 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"Anderson is 33. Lehner is I believe 23. We're rolling the dice on keeping Anderson if anything. 2 years from now, he could go down the drain where we could still have Lehner. Also, I think  it's time to give Lehner more time. If we trade Anderson, we can bring in pieces to help prevent goals. If Lehner allowing goals is an issue, we've always got the Hamburglar on speed dial."
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,TheKandyCinema,5,Thu Jun 4 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"Also, I think it's time to give Lehner more time   that's what the plan was last year, he was given a chance but he dropped the ball.  his attitude towards the team, especially the defense men, prior to the injury showed that he's really not ready for the role. In the end, he's just not a good fit for the organization moving forward.  It would be better for his own development to get a fresh start somewhere else, and we can ride Anderson/Hammond reliably for the next 2-3 years while O'Connor develops in the AHL."
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,Funkativity,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"Also if I can take anything out of Murrays press conference today and what people much more in the know than me have said, there is a lot more interest in Lehner than Anderson at the moment. I think that'll change once the VERY shallow pool of goaltending FAs get snatched up, so no rush in trading either of them right away."

OttawaSenators,38iqwc,Lemondish,5,Sat Jun 6 14:55:55 2015 UTC,"Two years from now, Anderson might very well still be a top-10 goalie in the league. We are just soooo close that it hurts we probably won't keep him around to go all the way. Think back to the days before Craig Anderson. Save for a few years of Patrick Lalime, the crease had always been a concern in Ottawa. The LeClaire/Gerber years almost broke me as a fan..  That said, I agree Andy should be moved. He deserves a shot now, and I think St. Louis should be looking at him very closely. Lehner gives us a longer window to sort out our top 6/second pairing. (edit: plus, we hopefully address those issues with the theoretical Andy trade.. exciting days, these are)"
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,OfficialGreenkid,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"Out of pure curiosity, do you consider Anderson to be a top10 goalie right now?  I'd say that Price, Rinne, Lundqvist, Rask, Quick, Holtby, Mason, Schneider, Bobrovsky and Bishop are better than him.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Anderson and I would be happy if DW managed to trade for him, but he isn't that good."
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:33:16 2015 UTC,"If Mason, Bobrobvsky, and Bishop are leaps and bounds better I have a hard time seeing it. Hell, even Schneids or Holtby..  Anderson showed he can play shot-for-shot with Carey Price this year.. even Glen Healey was admitting it after Andy saved the seemingly hopeless series and made it interesting.   He's played some great hockey the past 4 years on a team that, for the most part, has had little defensive stability. He consistently gets 40-save wins for us, it seems. I certainly say he's top 10. Humble opinion, though.. I'm no stats wizard at all"
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,OfficialGreenkid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:56:48 2015 UTC,"Holtby and Schneider are definitely better than Anderson at this point, but Mason, Bobrovsky and Bishop are ""only arguably"" better IMO.   If Anderson is top 10 then it's really just barely over Mason, Bobrovsky or Bishop IMO. Price, Rinne, Lundqvist, Rask, Quick, Holtby and Schneider are all way better than Anderson."
OttawaSenators,38iqwc,TheFantasticFinn,0,Fri Jun 5 13:12:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mason even deserves to be in the conversation, but Bob and Bishop definitely do.    I actually don't think Quick belongs on the list at all; he's a competent goalie who takes advantage of being in a possession-driven system with a good coach.  Bernier posted very similar stats to Quick when they were on the same team, and look how he plays on a team that can't play D.  Our team struggled defensively as well, but Anderson stood on his head."

Not sure how much I'm willing to put faith in these rumours, mainly because all 3 have long been rumoured to be in the market for a goalie and there are several out there. I have little doubt talks have been had, but how serious/worthwhile their offers are is the bigger question (and one we may never have answer to, certainly not before trade).

OttawaSenators,38gmfl,Omega613,3,Thu Jun 4 03:02:05 2015 UTC,"They may be inclined to sell lower if it nets them a solid goalie, though."
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,Lemondish,6,Thu Jun 4 04:08:06 2015 UTC,We really don't need a goalie unless Elliot demands a trade we got two guys in the AHL and Allen is our guy for the future. On of our podcast said that if we trade Elliot we should go after Anderson for back up or 1a 1b with Allen
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,jamesonbar,3,Thu Jun 4 04:11:12 2015 UTC,"Any idea/reads on how Blues management perceives Elliott? Various social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, etc.) seem to be under the impression that although Elliott has had some success in St.Louis, he's also not a great performer when the going gets tough, like in the playoffs.  As a Sens fan, Elliott was really not a good goalie for us on the whole. He was a puck sieve many nights, and not much better in his short stay in Colorado. Presumably between Hitchcocks' defensive system(s) and some more complimentary goalie coaching which meshes better with his style, he's no doubt turned it around with the Blues, but I can understand any doubts people have with him.   Just curious, if as a Blues fan, you know any more about Elliott perceived value by the organization and/or if they're looking to replace him with a different veteran? And for that matter, how much truth does there appear to be in rumours that a couple core guys might be on their way out as part of a re-tool?"
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,Omega613,6,Thu Jun 4 04:18:40 2015 UTC,I like him he will go 9 games playing good but will play shit for 2 games.  I wish they would of played him the playoffs this year.  I think he could of stole us a game. I wamt him back but I understand why he wouldn't want to be back.  Buffalo and oilers would be good fit for him.  Since both need goalies.  Our system probably makes him better then what he is though even though they played like shit in front of him thus year after the all star break
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,jamesonbar,-4,Thu Jun 4 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"""would of""   *would've  Sometimes I can't help but correct that one. This is one of those times.  Edit:   could of   *could've  (oh man....)   then   *than"
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,Disturburger,5,Thu Jun 4 12:53:29 2015 UTC,Didn't see last part. I see oshie and Burgland gone both have a no trade clause but doesn't come into effect until July 1.  We need speed. Backes Jackman Oshie Burgland and  Steen were put in place to beat Detroit but since they joined the east. We need speed to beat the Chicago's and LA of thr division.
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,jamesonbar,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"Rumours are suggesting interest in Andy. Let's play with that possibility. Can Oshie play left wing? If the cost was a top six forward, what are your thoughts on that?  And they should be interested. Guy is brilliant. Personally, I don't think our window of contending lines up with Andy, though, and we aren't a contender yet."

IMO it would be a bad idea to go for him, Ryan and Stone have the top 2 RW's on lock and who knows if T.J. can play left as effectively."
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,Hoxtilicious,3,Thu Jun 4 02:25:55 2015 UTC,I agree with that statement. Aside from Chiasson being top 6 capable lol

OttawaSenators,38gmfl,On_Letting_Go,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"Oshie is an interesting idea. Depending on Stone next season our top 2 RW should already be set. If Stone has a regression then Oshie could slide into that spot.   Other wise Oshie would need to play LW and I am unsure how he is in that scenario.  His value is a little inflated from the olympics, but the team needs/wants to shed cap so there is possibility to make a move at a reduced price based on this.  I would not give up a 1st for him, I would give up a 2nd and some stuff."
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,peskysens,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:33:41 2015 UTC,"I just don't know why this trade would make sense for the Sens.

OttawaSenators,38gmfl,mike-kt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:23:22 2015 UTC,I would say no. Ottawa shouldn't break up the first two lines and Oshie would not fit in the third line after Stone and Ryan.
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,TheKandyCinema,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"I personally don't see why you would as you guys don't have a need at right wing. Oshie is getting tons of hate from Blues fans right now because they just want something or someone to be pissed at.  Also, what you have to offer in terms of a trade is not what we would want to get for Oshie. Although there is a possibility of us wanting Anderson if Elliott has requested a trade.  I'd think a 3 team trade is the most likely scenario here, but even that isn't likely in my eyes.  Do you guys have any left handed top 4 defenseman you are looking to get rid of? That's an area that needs to be addressed with the Blues."
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,gruesome2some,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:48:00 2015 UTC,I don't think Ottawa should be looking for guys from a perennially underachieving team like the Blues. How many years in a row now are they supposed to have gone deep in the playoffs only to prematurely be knocked out? Oshie is a talented player but he's part of the group of guys in St.Louis who can't seem to raise their game to the next level in the playoffs. I feel like we'd have the same complaints about hm that Blues fans do. He's not a young player either
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,bbmello,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:09:07 2015 UTC,No. Making a play for him could ruin us.
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,jamesonbar,0,Sun Jun 7 15:11:28 2015 UTC,Yes please take him but cost you a first. Hes one of the guys in our core we want gone. He's good but can't skate funny in December but not in April but a solid two way forward who probably needs a change of scenery  also add Burgland for a prospect. You guys are the reason Burgland is getting paid 3 million a year cause he was going to be traded to Spezza
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,Omega613,2,Thu Jun 4 02:17:52 2015 UTC,"You guys are the reason Burgland is getting paid 3 million a year cause he was going to be traded to Spezza   Allegedly Nashville was actually the 1st in-line destination for Spez, but he wouldn't waive his NTC to go there (so instead NSH went a got Neal for a similar package). So I don't reckon we absorb too much of the blame on that one :P   Yes please take him but cost you a first.   We dealt a first rounder for Bobby Ryan in last year's draft, which in itself was a big deal for Murray. Our GM loves the idea of strategic drafting and building from within, hence why a huge portion of our current roster are players we drafted in the last 5-6 years (there was a recent discussion in /r/hockey and very few teams had more recent own-picks playing on their NHL roster). Not having a 1st rounder last year and having a barebones prospect cupboard due to a load of promotions in the last 2 years means that trading our 1st rounder in this/next year's draft seems unlikely. Although we have a nice stock of quality young NHLers, we also need more in the pipeline in case the current crop falters or otherwise doesn't meet our long term needs. Also, if you include our (NHL) RFAs, we have something like 25 players on 1-way contracts plus a couple AHLers who will likely request 1-way deal or leave as UFAs (group VI), that means we have to ship out 2-4 players to get under the 23 man limit. Sufficed to say, we can't logistically trade picks for even more roster players, not unless you're taking back a couple of poor(er) contracts in the process."
OttawaSenators,38gmfl,jamesonbar,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:15:02 2015 UTC,Yea I think management wants to get in thr first round this year since we traded ours to Buffalo for Ott and Miller last year.  That the joke with our sub is that Burgland was going to be on the deal for Spezza and we signed that deal to make him more appealing.  I actually don't mind Burgland as a 3rd line winger but we need to clear up cap space for Tarasenko and Allen this year and Schwartz next year
OttawaSenators,38c446,captainduck2,23,Wed Jun 3 06:58:24 2015 UTC,... things you can google ...
OttawaSenators,38c446,elamothe,7,Wed Jun 3 14:21:47 2015 UTC,All the NHL awards are announced at a live event after the season is over.
OttawaSenators,38c446,iamthegame13,2,Wed Jun 3 07:03:10 2015 UTC,It'll be just a couple days before the draft. Somewhere around like mid-June
OttawaSenators,38c446,Jthedude17,4,Wed Jun 3 11:02:26 2015 UTC,"The NHL Awards are on June 24th and then we will hear if Karlsson wins the Norris, Stone wins the Calder and Hammond wins the Masterton"
OttawaSenators,38c446,TheKandyCinema,2,Wed Jun 3 15:36:50 2015 UTC,I think we have a realistic chance of going 3 for 3.
OttawaSenators,38c446,ftardontherun,6,Wed Jun 3 19:32:38 2015 UTC,Karlsson and Stone are basically guaranteed but I have doubts on Hammond. Letang had a stroke and came back to play strong.
OttawaSenators,38c446,TheKandyCinema,5,Wed Jun 3 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think Karlsson is more likely to win the Norris than Stone is to win the Calder. Having a strong second half will work in Stone's favour in a ""what-have-you-done-for-me-lately"" kind of way, and it doesn't hurt that he led the league in scoring over that period of time. That said, Gaudreau was on people's radar consistently for the entire course of the season (and I don't see Ekblad winning it, even if he had an amazing season in Florida). I agree, though, that Hammond isn't likely to win the Masterton based on Letang's health concerns and his subsequent comeback."
OttawaSenators,38c446,PaddleDown,3,Wed Jun 3 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Stone is tied for lead in takeaways and plays more of a two way forward and gets more points on even strength. Gaudreau is great but not nearly defensive as Stone. Also, Stone was bad for the first half because MacLean had him on 3rd line."
OttawaSenators,38c446,TheKandyCinema,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:27:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you, but a lot of the people casting votes may not be looking at what line he played on during the first half and stats like takeaways. I think he should win because of what you're saying, but it's not a lock."
OttawaSenators,38c446,PaddleDown,2,Thu Jun 4 11:30:52 2015 UTC,"As much as I want Stone to win the Calder, I don't think he will.  The media has been salivating over Johnny Gaudreau since day 1 of the season."
OttawaSenators,38c446,mikegian,2,Thu Jun 4 15:05:07 2015 UTC,"His advanced stats are far superior. If Gaudreau wins, they're caring about hype."

OttawaSenators,389xv8,benches48,-10,Tue Jun 2 23:31:40 2015 UTC,The Sens have always had a good third line no matter who is on it. Condra will not be missed once people realize a rookie can do the same thing as he does.
OttawaSenators,389xv8,walahiguy,11,Wed Jun 3 13:22:58 2015 UTC,I'm a bit disturbed that the media has essentially proclaimed that there's zero chance that we re-sign Condra.  pretty much every article to come out since we got eliminated assumes he's not coming back and that makes me sadface

OttawaSenators,389xv8,JumpedAShark,5,Wed Jun 3 13:25:23 2015 UTC,"If we fail to re-sign Condra, or simply choose to let him walk, it will be another example of management failing to make those ""smart-spending"" decisions they keep talking about.  This is what frustrates me most about our current management and their decisions. They often listen to their hearts more than their heads. We're giving extensions to guys like Phillips and Borowiecki based on things like ""loyalty"" and ""home-grown talent,"" while we let proven and useful players like Condra leave.  After the success that line had when Condra wasn't a healthy scratch, why are they so reluctant to re-sign a cheap, useful utility player like him?"
OttawaSenators,389xv8,MichelangeBro,2,Tue Jun 2 23:29:39 2015 UTC,I agree with everything except the knock against Boro. I never won't value a bruising D-man.
OttawaSenators,389xv8,mike-kt,2,Tue Jun 2 23:54:32 2015 UTC,But why extend Boro for 3 years a year before he's an RFA? They didn't have to do that. Boro is not going to be worth more $$ than he already is. He's a bubble player on a bubble team. Why lock that up? Sens were signing with their heart

OttawaSenators,389xv8,JumpedAShark,0,Wed Jun 3 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"My point was more about how they re-signed him.

OttawaSenators,389xv8,antonio106,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:06:34 2015 UTC,"If I'm going to be fair, the thing that Condra brings is an opportunity to create scoring chances against bottom pair D-men.   He's not a good player, despite what possession stats might tell you. But he isn't going to cost your team as many goals. He is a better forward for a fourth line than putting a heavyweight who is probably a defensive liability every time he steps on the ice.   I say this, even though I love guys like Carkner, Kassian and Konopka, and hockey fights are basically the reason I got into NHL hockey."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,walahiguy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:17:56 2015 UTC,he is definitely better than a heavyweight and I don't want a guy like that on the 4th line. I'd rather have a guy like Puempel in the lineup even though he's a different position. I think Lazar will be next year's Condra anyway.

OttawaSenators,389xv8,blvckhippy,2,Wed Jun 3 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"Reading this article put a few thoughts I've had into perspective:   Seeing the amount of dollars we have tied up in horrible contracts is astounding. 9.625m for Greening, Legwand, and Michalek! Just can't get over that number.  For me, I don't have an issue with the AAV for Smith and to a degree Cowen. Think about, under 25, injuries have hampered his development and the jury is still out on whether or not he'll be a bust. Also, the cap friendly contract Wiercoch is signed to helps alleviate, in my mind, Cowen's regretful contract. With that said, if Cowen doesn't become the D partner we desperately need to play with either Ceci/Wiercoch, GMBM has to make a deal for a top-4 defencemen. Enjoy watching Gryba and Borowiecki, unfortunately, only one of them should be on the opening day roster. Anderson? Lehner? Hammond? Who knows. Just make sure that when a deal is done we address one of our above mentioned issues."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,walahiguy,3,Wed Jun 3 03:44:09 2015 UTC,Michalek is not a horrible contract by any means. We wouldn't have made the playoffs without his fine play late in the season
OttawaSenators,389xv8,JumpedAShark,5,Wed Jun 3 04:39:15 2015 UTC,"Seeing the amount of dollars we have tied up in horrible contracts is astounding   No kidding. Legwand, Greening, Michalek, Cowen, Gryba, Borowiecki, Phillips, Smith and Neil (all fairly replaceable players) add up to $21.4M of our ~$59M cap hit next season. That's a problem. It's a miracle we have guys like Karlsson and Turris on relatively cheap contracts for their value."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,blvckhippy,3,Wed Jun 3 13:19:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair the contracts of  Gryba, Borowiecki, and smith aren't terrible.    Gryba 1.25m Borowiecki 1.1m Smith 1.887m   It's the term of these contracts that's unforgivable:   Michalek has two more years Ditto for Greening Legwand, Neil, and Philipps all have a year left. Hopefully there expiring contracts are trade bait.   I know eh. You could even say that I'm thankful."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,mike-kt,0,Wed Jun 3 04:53:41 2015 UTC,"Those first three contracts aren't terrible (except for the term), but I'd like to see other players get a chance to show what they have, players like Prince, Claesson and Wideman. I think the team should leave spots for young kids on cheap contracts. It's the main reason I didn't like the Legwand signing.   Overall this team man, this team."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,walahiguy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"That's not a big problem, that's 35% of the cap for around 39% of the roster, and I'm sure most teams are the same way. Funny how you say they are all replaceable but you don't mention Condra in the same breath."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,Ubuhio,0,Wed Jun 3 12:47:38 2015 UTC,Condra brings a unique skillset to the team that no one else really can replicate.  No he doesn't have much of a scoring touch but he's clutch on the PK.
OttawaSenators,389xv8,walahiguy,0,Wed Jun 3 13:21:53 2015 UTC,Pageau is the exact same player with more scoring upside.   Stone is a great PKer.   He can and will be easily replaced
OttawaSenators,389xv8,Iphikratous3,2,Wed Jun 3 14:03:44 2015 UTC,I'd just like to point out that the two players you mentioned to replace him on the PK already play the PK. One happens to be his partner...  I'd sure as shit trust Condra on the PK more than a guy like puempel or prince.
OttawaSenators,389xv8,relapsingoncemore,0,Wed Jun 3 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"Amen brother. We just don't have anyone with his skillset that isn't already on the PK, and no one in the system can immediately replace him in his specialties.

The kids great, and there's no question he's capable of playing in the NHL, but there's also no rush. His play and attitude should earn him a roster spot next year, but a year in Bingo finding his scoring touch is probably better for his development. I'd rather have that Lazar in the roster a year or so down the road when we're contending."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,walahiguy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:17:03 2015 UTC,There is no chance he plays in Binghamton. You don't send a guy down when he's proven to be an NHL player unless he has a terrible camp which won't happen with a guy like him. He can play the exact same way as Condra did and score more.
OttawaSenators,389xv8,walahiguy,0,Thu Jun 4 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"Lazar replaces him on the PK, stone moves up one. Pretty easy."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,mike-kt,2,Thu Jun 4 01:14:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of Cullen and I like this game plan. I would jettison a bunch more players than he lists, but I like how he brought up the idea of a buyout for Cowen. If no one is willing to trade for Cowen, I think it's the next best option. The chances of Cowen outplaying the salary on his remaining two contract years is miniscule, and we're talking about the cost of an AHL player on the cap for 4 years. Anyway they'll either trade him or keep him"
OttawaSenators,389xv8,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Wed Jun 3 23:16:49 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have a 6'5'' 24 year old on the bubble of the roster instead of 29 year old Greening at 2.65 mill, or 34 year old Legwand at 3.0 mill.     If anyone's getting bought out it should be Greening or Legwand before Cowen."
OttawaSenators,389xv8,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:10:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, they need to go.   The general point is that Cowen is set to earn more than either of those guys and his buyout is far less than either of theirs. Still, I think there is a trade market for Cowen and Legwand.

Never went a game in the Mem Cup tournament without a point (I don't believe any other General can say the same). His zone entry and secondary assist set up the cup winning goal tonight   Here's his slick-toe drag against Kelowna earlier in the tournament which later stood as the game winner. Also, here is his late (clutch) game-tying powerplay goal against the Remparts that sent the game to OT where the Gens won.   Although we should temper expectations until we at least see him in the AHL (or NHL for that matter), certainly an exciting prospect to have (reminder: we drafted him in the 4th round with the pick we got back in the Bishop trade). With 32 goals and 78 points in 67 regular season game and 7 goals/19 points in 21 post season games, he had a hell of a year - doubly so when you consider that this was his first year on North American ice and learning and more physical play style. He's adapted well and his size (6'3"", 215 lbs) bodes well for translating his game to the NHL."

OttawaSenators,3806ir,JumpedAShark,6,Sun May 31 21:43:37 2015 UTC,If he's hurt that badly by a comment in a professional environment which was likely not meant as a slight then he has a whole other problem
OttawaSenators,3806ir,goost0852,5,Mon Jun 1 13:57:11 2015 UTC,So true :P I don't think this is actually the case though. IMO Lehner just isn't a backup goalie and can't play well in a once every few games type roll. I really thought he was turning the corner in his last few games before going down with injury. He went 2-1-1 in his last 4 full games with a ~.920 save percentage (all in a short window with Andy hurt). In a game against Buffalo (yes I know it's Buffalo but we weren't beating many people at the time) he was the 1st star stopping 35/36 shots in an OT win. Besides just the stats I remember him as making some timely saves and keeping us in the games even the losing ones.  I really feel like he just needs to get in a rhythm and get lots of games in to stay sharp and is not the type of guy who can come in after a couple weeks of no starts and be ready to go. I understand his sample size is small and it would be a huge risk to give him the starting job (or a shot at it) to start the season but I feel like we're going to regret it hard if we trade him away and he is going to be a superstar. He pretty much single handedly won Binghamton the Calder cup in 2011.
OttawaSenators,3806ir,devin27,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"This remains my main concern with him. I believe he has the talent, but he needs to be able to get past this idea that the staff and organization isn't treating him fairly enough or giving him enough of a chance. If he keeps playing with the mindset that he can get that starting job, he has a shot. Unfortunately it feels like he's kinda given up trying."
OttawaSenators,3806ir,InTURRISting,5,Mon Jun 1 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"What I noticed was a distinct difference in Lehner's attitude and performance since. He just lacked that drive, that motivation, that killer-instinct we had seen in previous seasons   Despite his comments to the contrary, this reveals a lack of maturity which is not well suited to professional work.   This is typical of those <25 who have achieved at previous levels.  While nothing to worry about it does not endear one to becoming a 50+ game starter.   One day."
OttawaSenators,3806ir,Jthedude17,3,Mon Jun 1 13:39:58 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I'd never really considered this. I noticed that right before Lehner got hurt, when he was the undisputed starter (when Andy was injured) Lehner did fairly well. He just needs encouragement and the mindset that he can take the starting job"
OttawaSenators,37tl6y,danglesnipecelly69,6,Sat May 30 07:38:23 2015 UTC,"Sure he's still a little bit of a wildcard, but it was more than just flashy saves over a third of a season. There were times where a player like Steven Stamkos would rip down the wing, blast a shot, and Hammond would be in perfect position to snatch and hold the puck with poise like he was a veteran and I'd think to myself ""this guy's for real.""  That's the feeling I'm keeping going into next season"

OttawaSenators,37tl6y,Nutzillaa,-15,Sun May 31 04:59:18 2015 UTC,Sigh. This contract is such a disaster.  They should have just let him walk.
OttawaSenators,37tl6y,mackinder,9,Sat May 30 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"3y at just over $4mil. So you think he isn't a serviceable backup?  I mean that's not long term or bad money on a one-way deal with the ability to move him if needed, but only if he can give you 30 games a year."
OttawaSenators,37tl6y,Nutzillaa,0,Sun May 31 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm not entirely sure whether he'll be a serviceable backup right now. I'm just not a fan of signing guys purely for the sake of ""retaining an asset"" (like we did with Michalek).  What's wrong with saying ""Hey kid, you did an outstanding job with us over the last 20ish games of the season and completely saved our year.  That being said, we didn't use a draft pick to get you and we think that we have two guys in our system that are ahead of you so we're going to let you walk and pursue your career somewhere else?""  The thing that worries me the most about Hammond is that he's never been a great goalie at any level.  He was a tier 2 Jr. A net minder who was a little better than average in college but not outstanding and was abysmal in the AHL before seizing his opportunity and playing well for 20 games in the NHL.  he'll come back down to earth next season and we'll be stuck with a contract that's hard to move and be forced to trade a guy like Lehner who we've been developing for 6 years now."
OttawaSenators,37tl6y,sgtenders,1 point,Sun May 31 22:02:37 2015 UTC,"How exactly would that contract be hard to move? It would actually be incredibly easy to move and even if you had to waive him and nobody took him it's still cheap enough that it doesn't hurt to eat and he could be bought out easily as well. That's assuming nobody would take him which I sincerely doubt would happen if it came down to it, at his price."
OttawaSenators,37tl6y,Nutzillaa,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:16:23 2015 UTC,"How exactly would that contract be hard to move?   Because there are only 60 jobs (58 if you don't count the Sens) and many of those teams already have established #1 guys or want to fill their backup position with a guy they've developed internally through the draft.  If he flames out next season teams aren't likely to take a flyer on 27 year-old when they could just use some kid that's 4 years younger that they've been grooming in the AHL for the last couple years.   even if you had to waive him and nobody took him it's still cheap enough that it doesn't hurt to eat and he could be bought out easily as well.   No.  We're a budget team that's going to have to overspend next season because of the way Bryan Murray has mismanaged the roster--specifically the veteran players like Phillips, Michalek and Legwand.  We simply cannot afford to pay players not to play for our team, especially when we're aiming to spend significantly less than most of the teams in the league.  Everyone says ""Oh, it's just 1.3M, what's the big deal?"" Well, when you're one of the cheapest teams in the league every dollar counts.  Greening is just 2.65, Phillips is just 2.5, Hammond is only 1.3, no biggie.  But we could be using that money on a legit top-4 dman instead of having it sit up in the press box.     That's assuming nobody would take him which I sincerely doubt would happen if it came down to it, at his price.   Honestly, the price doesn't scare me as much as the term.  If the NHL was like the NFL with little to no guaranteed money, I'd have no problem signing Hammond.  You could give him another opportunity next season and if he flames out you could just cut bait and be done with it.  But, in the NHL you're basically attached to the hip of guys you've signed and it can really fuck up your ability to take advantage of your ""window.""  The Sens are in a decent spot right now considering how far some of their young talent has progressed, but they'll be held back next season by a plethora of old, useless guys who have a guaranteed roster spots that could be better used on younger guys in our system.  A big part of why we're in that situation is because Murray was afraid to ""lose an asset for nothing"" i.e Michalek and Phillips.  My feeling is that in today's game you have to sometimes let guys walk if you feel like they can't contribute like they used to and are signing contracts that are hard to trade.  If you have faith in the players you've drafted you should just let those types (Hammond included) walk and let the younger, cheaper players prove themselves."

OttawaSenators,37lcsr,chumpawumpa69,23,Thu May 28 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck I could not imagine being a Sens fan without the work of Bryan with this organization.     Coached Ottawa to the only finals experience with essentially one line and a buncha role players. Couldn't find a decent coach to replace him, but somehow got the Cory Clouston/Craig Hartsburgh/Martin Gerber/Brian Elliot/Jarko Ruutu/Peter Regin/Jim O'Brien Senators into the Mac/Turris/Stone/Hoff/Zib/Ryan/Lazar/Karlsson/Ceci/Andy/Lehner Senators that we see today. Meanwhile a captain left us suddenly, owners have said to city counsel that this team loses money, and stars have asked to been traded. Holy shit balls batman.    Bryan you are a goddam hero and we all fucking love you!"
OttawaSenators,37lcsr,FixedTheNewelPost,8,Thu May 28 17:16:54 2015 UTC,I mean he also got the Spezza/Alfie/Heatley/Fisher/Chara Sens into the Smith/Neil/Greening/Condra/Cowen/Gryba Sens  I love the guy but you were kind of picking and choosing names there
OttawaSenators,37lcsr,On_Letting_Go,7,Thu May 28 20:56:34 2015 UTC,Chara wasn't him I believe...and Heatley demanded a trade after signing a long term deal
OttawaSenators,37lcsr,thebestagirlcanget,2,Fri May 29 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"Sure I cherry picked names a bit, but out of those names you listed Spezz and Heatley both asked to be traded. You can say his lack of coach hiring success maybe has something to do with this if you want to be more fair.  Chara and Alfie both walked, not a mismanagement on Bryan's part IMHO. How much of that is personal reasons (captaincy in Boston, playoffs in Detroit) or the ownership/salary challenge he's faced this whole time in Ottawa?  And in a rebuild he sent Mike Fisher to is wife's hometown where he could start a family and still managed a 1st and conditional pick from it. The Fisher pick ended up being Puempel I believe, who is scoring his first NHL goals and will be making a solid push for the 3rd line next season.  So I guess there should be more emphasis on the lack of consistent coaching, and ownership/salary issues then just listing names of players. Either way, considering the restrictions placed on Murray in his time here he has built quite the roster after falling from grace."
OttawaSenators,37lcsr,FixedTheNewelPost,12,Fri May 29 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"Very sad, but kind of expected, really wishing Tim Murray had stayed right about now, he would have been the next in line for sure. Either way, I hope everything works out for  the better."
OttawaSenators,37lcsr,galloots,6,Thu May 28 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"Just thinking ... How long was Tim Murray's contract with Buffalo?  If it was two years, he could still be Ottawa GM next summer."

OttawaSenators,37lcsr,mike-kt,3,Thu May 28 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"You know, you do have a good point there. With analytics becoming so prominent, that could make or break a team come a few years. Especially in a cap era, where teams with extra money can't spend more on players than other teams but they can spend more on off-ice personnel like scouts and analytics.    I can see Ottawa poaching a guy like Travis Yost from TSN in the near future, which we would probably do considering he'd be working for one of his favourite teams. I think then, Toronto would still have a slight advantage in analytics, considering the fact they were one of the first to do it and will develop sooner. But I still think that even with all their scouts, Toronto won't be as good and successful as Ottawa as far as scouting goes.    So pretty much, when comparing Ottawa's off-ice staff to Toronto's, I think we'll pretty much even with theirs for the next few years"

OttawaSenators,37lcsr,walahiguy,2,Fri May 29 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"Hey Sens fans, how does it feel having a good GM??? pouts momentarily  But seriously, looks like the dude did a lot for you guys. Wonder who will replace him!?"
OttawaSenators,37lcsr,JimWest92,2,Fri May 29 08:30:45 2015 UTC,"Living in Ottawa, Bryan's a pretty big key in the organization and the general public, he'll be missed in ottawa."
OttawaSenators,37lcsr,MaxTheWolverine,1 point,Fri May 29 11:44:45 2015 UTC,"He'll be seriously missed but it's worth pointing out it was always the plan to step down next summer. He signed a 4 year deal last year which was for 2 years as GM and 2 years in an advisory role. His illness may have put an end to any ideas of extending as GM, sure, but this was always the original plan."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,BigRiggety,7,Wed May 27 13:42:07 2015 UTC,"Yay Sens discussion!     Anyway, I think the reason for the top 6 talk is that the timeline for this team being a consistent top of the league team is longer than most fans think. Sure this past season, or really from Feb 18th onward was awesome, but without a record setting hot streak Ottawa was in the McDavid sweepstakes.     Every team wants a young skilled top 6 guy, and the last time Ottawa was in a consistent winning position they were a 3 headed monster with Spez/Heat/Alf. This time around it could be Karl/Ryan/ _____.      The reason this comes up now is that Ottawa is so overloaded with assets it may actually be possible. We're busting at the seems with young NHL ready potential. And find a team with a prime aged star that has a core that needs more years (please Boedker, please, just come to Ottawa and wear the heritage jersey, you'll love it) and it may actually be possible. Maybe.     The defense core doesn't know what it even is yet. No real ""shut down duo"" unless Ceci and Cowen both take huge leaps, and happen without the massive minutes logged by Meth/Karlsson. Kind of a 3rd pairing bash-brothers situation but offensive teams still feast on them?? Weircioch/Ceci/Cowen is a 3 headed beast of uncertainty that needs 2 players to emerge. Cowen's the weakest so far, but it's not like Ceci/Weircioch have developed enough dependability to give up on Cowen completely.    A top 4 addition either gives up on 2 of Weircioch/Ceci/Cowen, or makes our 2 cap friendly Gryba/Boroweicki expendable even though they are just as unreliable as Weircioch/Ceci/Cowen right now.     The defence is easily another full season away from even having set roles and a direction, while a top 6 forward is like the rare unicorn all teams wants but very few (no one) can pull off. Ottawa may just have the assets to get it done."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,FixedTheNewelPost,4,Wed May 27 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"Excellent reply, I dig it. I guess the inherent point of my post (that was poorly communicated) is that we have the assets to make moves, like you said, but why isn't our sole focus the Defense? We have glaring holes in every Defensive position past Meth-Kaptain, so why are we even entertaining shipping our assets for anything other than players that can fill these holes?    I guess that's the main source of my frustration with this whole Top 6 F thing - I understand that every team is looking for a Top 6 player that can push them to the next level. But 2 years ago we went and paid the price for a Top 6 Forward in BFR, and, guess what, he didn't suddenly make us a contender. It took a complete team effort (and unbelievable goaltending) to even give us a shot.    So, in the hopes of building a more complete team, shouldn't we be looking for Top 4 D, and only that?"
OttawaSenators,37gizh,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Wed May 27 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"Shipping away say Cowen for a top 4 guy still requires the emergence of 3 of Weircioch/Ceci/Boroweicki/Gryba and in that timeline you may have given away the guy that's becoming the exact player you need.    Bring in... X player and have him in the top 4 with Ceci, who still needs time. You're leaving Weircioch and Gryba maybe as the clear bottom pair, and if they struggle wouldn't it be nice to have a young 6'5'' guy down there with higher potential to maybe have an elite back 6? Shit, that's Cowen.  Same could be said of you rotate Weircioch into the guy leaving (Ceci is untouchable IMHO).  Also just on timing, Cowen has little to no trade value, so what else have you given up for this prime aged top 4 d-man? Lehner? Pageau? A 1st rounder? You've given up assets to turn a shakey bottom 4 into a shakey bottom 3 that still need another season in them.     A top 4 d-man would be nice but at what price? And it's tough to point at 3 of the current bottom 5 (sorry Philly you don't count) and go ""you three, those are the guys we're going with"".     In any case a deal is a deal, and it's stupid for Murray not to listen to offers. I would say Ottawa can't give up a ton of assets for this top 4 considering all the unanswered questions, and potential for guys to thrive elsewhere."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Wed May 27 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think it's quite easy to single out 3 of the bottom 5:    Ceci Wierdcock Rotation of Boro, Claesson or Wideman (we also have two defensive prospects who deserve a shot).    I agree with you on Ceci, however I think he's still quite young and could use a reduction in minutes, provided by the alleviation of defensive pressure via adding a dependable Top 4 Dman. Regarding Cowen....for the majority of nights he's on the ice he is a liability. I will admit he has spurts of strong play, but you can't have 1 of your 6 defensemen be hot n cold throughout the season. Cameron has realized this, and has shown that sometimes it's better to make him a healthy scratch rather than try and throw him into situations to gain experience. Not good for a player whom we hope will become a Top 4 contributor...Cowen just isn't going to be the player we hope for.  Right now, management has a chance to use the Goaltending situation to form a nice, attractive package to fill a hole we really need, which will likely include pieces that aren't panning out, but still have potential value. If we can pull in a Top 4 D to go with Wier and Cowen has to go as a result of it, I won't shed a tear, because we really need help on D, versus sort of maybe need help up front."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Ubuhio,1 point,Wed May 27 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"I guess I see the team in an opposite way than most. To me there's a lack of elite talent up front with a chance of a solid defence core emerging from what's already there.    I see Lehner as the goalie of the future, so I'm automatically looking at 1-2 years out. I see a top 6 filled with 35-50 point guys and maybe the odd 60 point year from Ryan if he develops consistency. On the back end, again if nothing is done, there's a 6'5'' 26 year old Cowen on the bottom pairing which is a luxury many teams would be jealous of.    Average age on the team is like ~27 and acquisitions to the 3rd/4th lines make this team competitive in the playoffs, but not league leading elite by any means.  Not saying the defence is elite then, but certainly a less pressing issue than the top 6.  We won't be the next 2010 Boston Bruins considering they had a Veniza candidate along with that stacked defensive defence, whereas Karl/Ceci/weir are all set to be offensive or two-way."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,devin27,14,Wed May 27 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"Because you solve the depth problem by getting a top 6 and bumping Hoff or Stone down the line.  Great players who will get better but don't be surprised to see a sophomore slump from either of them.  Pairing up against weaker opponents will do them some good, especially Stone if he wins the Calder."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,MooseFlyer,7,Wed May 27 15:16:56 2015 UTC,Because you solve the depth problem by getting a top 6 and bumping Hoff or Stone down the line   Hoffman OK but bump Stone down? Are you kidding? He was our best player second half of the season.  IF he has a huge sophmore slump then OK but man you can't move that guy down the lineup until he plays his way OUT of the top 6.
OttawaSenators,37gizh,MooseFlyer,1 point,Wed May 27 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"Unless you do, and you let him feast on other teams' third lines. Spread out scoring is a fantastic thing to have.   And you take how effective our third line was last year and add some scoring? good things could happen."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Ubuhio,2,Sun May 31 04:10:23 2015 UTC,"The same is true for the D, except that our depth D are worse than our depth F, so we should still be after a top 4 Dman instead of a top 6 forward.   What we should be seeking is to wind up with this D corps by the start of next season:  Methot - Karlsson  Acquired top 4 Dman - Wiercioch  Borowiecki/Wideman - Ceci  With Cowen and Gryba gone off in trades.  That gives us a competent top 4 (I believe that Wiercioch is pretty much read to be a #4 guy) and allows Ceci to play sheltered minutes on a bottom pairing, which is where he should be at this stage in his development."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,MooseFlyer,1 point,Sun May 31 04:18:40 2015 UTC,Just because we need a top 6 Forward doesn't mean we don't need a top 4 Defenseman.  I would agree with your pairings as well.  It's possible that GMBM still can see the light at the end of the tunnel for our D.  Wiercioch and Ceci are going to be great and perhaps he thinks that's what our 2nd pairing is going to be.
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Jaycorr,1 point,Sun May 31 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"I also think the D-man is more important because I think Ceci still needs to be sheltered. Our top 6 might not be the best in the league, but they're all capable of playing in the top 6 just fine - none of them need sheltering at this point, IMO."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Grambo92,2,Sun May 31 13:29:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a believer in Mark Stone but I still don't think that he can be the player he was being for the last half of the season for years to come.  Good insight, I too believe that we could be looking at a bit of regression from a few players. edit:  come on stone, prove me wrong!"
OttawaSenators,37gizh,HockeyBoyz3,9,Mon Jun 1 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"Once the Rangers complete their playoff run they will have a few D men who they wont be able to pay.  Also keep in mind that if we're looking for that top 6 forward, STL always flirts with goalies. They have zero faith in Allen. We may be able to pluck a forward from them.. possibly a d man as well in Jackman or Gunnarsson."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Chili_Palmer,5,Wed May 27 15:13:24 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Mackenzie tweeted yesterday that the Blues are toying with the idea of trading Oshie
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Iphikratous3,3,Wed May 27 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Rangers would be a good team to try and poach.   Would have been better to give Stralman that same deal he got like I wanted last year, but hey, can't win em all."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,TrulyMagnificient,3,Wed May 27 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"We would have had to give Stralman a lot more than he got. Not saying it wouldn't be worth it, but he went to a cup contender in sunny Florida with 0 income tax. Different than going to a rebuilding team that had a shitty season, in this climate, and paying income tax."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Jarretl9,2,Thu May 28 02:02:01 2015 UTC,I've always wondered how income tax affected teams and the cap. I guess I'd have to look into it more but I bet the difference between the lowest taxed and highest taxed has a pretty significant impact on 'effective' cap. Maybe not though.
OttawaSenators,37gizh,as_hagi,1 point,Thu May 28 05:13:17 2015 UTC,Chicago is going to be in the same situation. They won't be able to keep that roster for long.  Edit: format
OttawaSenators,37gizh,detroyer,6,Thu May 28 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"The only move that would make the team better would be to replace MacArthur or Hoffman with a top-3 winger. That said, there were only nine LWs who scored more goals than Hoffman last season, and I can't see their teams letting them go. I think the organization should plan for Hoffman's production to dip to around 20-25 goals, but for Ryan and Stone to score 30+ goals each.  Also, there isn't room/cap space enough to add another piece to the wings unless two of Michalek, Smith, Neil and Greening are traded.  I think our current defensive squad is good enough. I don't think this sub gave Ceci enough respect for the way he played last season."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,ftardontherun,7,Wed May 27 14:18:43 2015 UTC,but for Ryan and Stone to score 30+ goals each.   plz bobby
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Boonedoggle,2,Wed May 27 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"Greening is a virtually guaranteed buyout (they couldn't give him away at the trade deadline).  Hopefully Neil retires or gets ""injured"" and I don't think Smith is that hard to move as an inexpensive, tough 4th C.  I also think Legwand could be on the move as well, probably for nothing as his contract is a tad pricey, but that would make lots of room.  I think Michalek, Greening and Cowen are really the only players we have on tough-to-trade contracts, and even then someone might take a flyer on Cowen."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Chiefboss22,5,Wed May 27 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine a scenario where legwand doesn't get traded. Pageau, Lazar, and arguably Smith can all play the defensive forward game just as well as #17, and they can skate faster than walking speed."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,ftardontherun,2,Wed May 27 15:27:39 2015 UTC,and that is why we may not be able to trade Legwand..
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Omega613,1 point,Wed May 27 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"Could be that no one is willing to take him on, though he's a prototypical Panthers guy - written off and something to prove."

I can unfortunately, two in fact:   No one in the league wants him and his contract He won't waive his NTC   The former I do doubt, since someone is likely to be looking for a depth veteran centre. It would just be a matter of Murray not getting the deal done early, and then everyone who would've been interested finding alternatives or tying up their cap space in other players.  But the latter is a huge one on which trading him entirely hinges. I have no idea what Legwands thoughts might be on the matter, he may or may not be happy enough playing a reduced role and/or the teams interested in him (eg. maybe Buffalo) he would not be willing to waive for."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Omega613,2,Wed May 27 17:22:02 2015 UTC,That moment when you realize a 2-year rental player can block a trade that may impact the future of the org... ouch.

OttawaSenators,37gizh,jimtheclowned,2,Wed May 27 23:42:40 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, I guess it was still the right move to bring him in, given smiths injury, but damn, that should have been a 1 yr deal"
OttawaSenators,37gizh,ftardontherun,4,Thu May 28 02:07:12 2015 UTC,"Michalek stands as the player to most surprise us...If you take away his awful start, and injured time he played pretty well for a decent stretch of games.  I like having him for the depth, but his contract is lolllll wutttt for the role he plays right now.  Although, if he stepped up early and kept it going next season. By golly we could be scary as a team."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,MooseFlyer,2,Wed May 27 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't hate him as a player, I just don't think he'll ever live up to that contract.  If he's able to stay healthy into the last year he actually fetch something, but I wouldn't bet on his knee lasting that long."

OttawaSenators,37gizh,On_Letting_Go,3,Wed May 27 14:49:34 2015 UTC,Wow you are drinking the Kool Aid. That is not a top six set of forwards that are going ANYWHERE near the stanley cup. It needs upgrades.

OttawaSenators,37gizh,On_Letting_Go,2,Thu May 28 10:44:52 2015 UTC,I'll agree on the defense part but my only point is that the forwards do need an upgrade if the cup is a goal

Our top 9 might look like:  MacArthur/Turris/Stone  Sharp/Zibanejad/Ryan  Hoffman/Lazar/Puempel  Just a few thoughts I had"
OttawaSenators,37gizh,ftardontherun,7,Wed May 27 14:01:43 2015 UTC,I like Sharp but he's getting older and declining.  He's 33.  I'd hate to see us spend big on a guy who could be out of the league in 2-4 years.

OttawaSenators,37gizh,Akoustyk,2,Wed May 27 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"I really can't see why the coach doesn't like Hoff on that line.   the only thing I can see is that he doesn't think the D assignments are being covered off well enough with two young guys in Zib and Hoff, but to me that is more on Zibby. If Zibby takes another step forward in his development into a great two-way center, it may look a lot better to have Hoff play where he belongs."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,hnryv,1 point,Wed May 27 16:07:40 2015 UTC,I'd love to know why the coach thinks Hoff doesn't play good enough defensively yet plays him on the point in the power play...
OttawaSenators,37gizh,MooseFlyer,2,Wed May 27 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"Right now we lack game-breakers and toughness in our top-six. I like the group we've put together, Stone especially - assuming he can put up similar numbers again (I think he can)-... but the reality is we don't have a single player beyond Karlsson that I'd call a star in this league, at least not yet. I think MacArthur is better suited to the 2nd line and while Michalek isn't ""old"", he's certainly slowed down due to injuries. Hoffman played excellent and this is exactly why he'd be a big chip in a trade for a proven top-6 forward. Despite his success this season, the team can improve on him if he's part of a package with a pick or a roster player at a position we're overburdened at already (e.g. defence, goaltending). He isn't a particularly hard player and his defensive game will never be outstanding, so if can trade for a guy who brings a similar shot but better attributes surrounding that then I don't see why we wouldn't do so."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,anthcam,1 point,Wed May 27 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"The only upgrade I could see in the top-6 would be a more defensive forward in Hoffman's spot. IMO, as long as the defensive pair isn't totally out of position, it's the back checking forwards that create a lot of the turnovers and good defensive play. Most teams are able to get a good scoring chance if they're getting 3 on 2s all the time. My point is that while defensemen have defense in their name it's actually the forwards that contribute the most to reducing scoring chances against, as long as the defense isn't totally botching the play. Somebody like ROR would be an ideal fit, IMO."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Beginswaffle,1 point,Wed May 27 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"If we could improve our forwards, that would be great. Basically every single one of our forwards could be improved upon. The question is simply whether it will actually be possible in practice. I mean, there is ovechkin, or crosby, or the oiler's first round pick for mcdavid.   The team can be better up front, we don't have all the best players up front. I'd be very hasty to give some of them away, but the right player, is the right player.   That said, I think now that they've learned to play, our group of forwards is pretty decent and pretty young. There are a few guys that I think might be possible for a trade. Idk for who exactly, maybe there just couldn't be the right trade, but I can't say that we could not improve our forward group with a trade."

Most people seem on board with the idea of the next generation of tenders.  I can see why, I've been a Lehner die-hard, I wore the shitty Hamburglar masks they were handing out that one game, I get it.  But Andy gets us wins when this team is good.

OttawaSenators,37gizh,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:20:32 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't play Hoff with Bobby and Z-Bad. While he's great at stretching the ice and being a general match up nightmare, a lot of what makes Bobby and Z-Bad so great is how they work in the offensive zone, which unfortunately is the opposite of how the Hoff rolls. We need someone who can help set Ryan up, take a pass from Z-Bad and be responsible defensively in our own end. Another problem is no one is publicly allowed to speak our last 40 goal season getter. Burns or Eberle/Hall plz."

OttawaSenators,37gizh,ftardontherun,1 point,Wed May 27 14:30:20 2015 UTC,My hearts set on Burns because he fits both.

OttawaSenators,37gizh,benches48,1 point,Wed May 27 18:28:22 2015 UTC,We don't have the assets to give up to get those three guys. Simple as that.
OttawaSenators,37gizh,mike-kt,1 point,Wed May 27 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"One possibility, I wonder if it's a bit of misdirection.  He's been talking about adding a top 6 FW forever, but hasn't done it.  Is he really looking for a D, but playing coy?  ""Well, you know, we're really looking for a forward, but I guess we'd take Shea Weber off your hands for Lehner, if you throw in a pick or two"".  I definitely think a D is the need, I'd love to see another 2nd pairing guy as I think both Pdub and Ceci are at that sort of 4/5 stage.  If they develop into 3/4 locks it's always good to have a guy in the third pairing who can move up if needed, and besides, most teams usually spend somewhere around a third to half the season missing at least one of their top 4 to injury."
OttawaSenators,37gizh,walahiguy,2,Wed May 27 13:57:54 2015 UTC,"I've thought of that too, and the only reason I'm less inclined to believe it is because GMBM has never been the type of manager to misdirect - he's usually pretty straightforward with contract situations/team needs/weaknesses, etc. It would be one hell of a play if he did pull something like that off, though"
OttawaSenators,37gizh,Beginswaffle,1 point,Wed May 27 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll find out soon enough, as I'd be pretty surprised if we still have all three of Andy/Lehner/Hammond on the roster by October.  I tend to think if he is going to trade for a forward, we would be shipping one out as well.  For example maybe he does something like Hoff + Andy for Eberle.  That might be fantasy (I'd love that trade but it probably takes more to get Eberle) but along those lines - top six for top six, but a serious upgrade."

OttawaSenators,37bveg,wordsNtricks,15,Tue May 26 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"Shocker.    I'm still torn over who I'd rather see them move.  The knee-jerk answer is Lehner because he's not proven yet.  However, there's a lot of us that are nervous of that given our recent history with dealing goalies.  (As soon as the uniform turns blue they become elite).     Most people want to keep Anderson because he's top 10 in the league and arguably top 5.  However he's got this weird on/off thing going on where he's only good on alternating years.  He also will net the highest return.  I think I'd be ok with dealing Anderson if he got us a big piece in return.  I'd like to think that between Lehner, Hammond and O'connor that we have a bona fide starter in the system, but it's nice to already have one so we don't have to worry about it."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Ubuhio,12,Tue May 26 14:15:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, that would be nice, but is safe the best choice for the future?  I'm okay with Andy going more than I am in giving up on the young Lehner."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Lemondish,5,Tue May 26 15:41:20 2015 UTC,Anderson also would get a higher return. I'm pretty sure teams would rather give up for a guy they KNOW will be a starting goaltender now than a guy who MIGHT be a starter a few years down the road
OttawaSenators,37bveg,kenata88,1 point,Tue May 26 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure, there are a lot more teams with entrenched #1 options that would like a goalie of the future than there are teams without a #1 guy. I'm thinking Edmonto, Buffalo, San Jose. Everyone else has their guy (even if their guy isn't very good, phx, car, wpg, phi, pit, lak)"
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,7,Tue May 26 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Andy is 34 years old, he doesn't factor into the future regardless at this point."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Chili_Palmer,3,Tue May 26 17:18:48 2015 UTC,He's got two good seasons left in him IMO. Who is to say in two years we aren't a contender? With the age of our core I'd say 2-3 years is a our window.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Voljjin,1 point,Tue May 26 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"The window is open now. Any improvement in the young guys will be offset by the old guys getting older (Ryan, Mac, Milan, Andy, Methot, ...Gryba)"
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,4,Tue May 26 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"Ryan and Methot have 4 years of prime left, assuming andy gets moved, Gryba is not a key player and very replaceable. Only one of Mac/Milo needs to stay a top 6 UNLESS we get a top 6 LW back from Andy in which case neither will be leaned on heavily or needed really..."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,SkullCrusherXP,1 point,Tue May 26 21:54:15 2015 UTC,The fact that you're counting gryba and Ryan as old guys shows how young this team is.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Benjamin_Butthole,1 point,Thu May 28 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"This is true, but they're in their UFA years and they're in the last half of their pro careers"
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,1 point,Thu May 28 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"Just because they aren't young doesn't mean they're old, they both will be at their best for atleast another 3-5 years, and that's enough time for the young guys to all hit their prime."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Benjamin_Butthole,1 point,Thu May 28 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by best, and I don't know how you can make that assumption. It's very possible they've already played the best hockey of their careers. That's really besides the point, but are you saying that they will be better than they've been in the past into their early thirties? There's a chance, but it's more likely they're at their plateau now, and will slowly decline. Maybe you mean they (or at least Ryan) will still be NHL players for the next 3-5 years. This I agree with, I never said they would be out of the league very soon, just that the slow decline due to aging is a very real thing."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,1 point,Thu May 28 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"I mean that they're likely at their best now and they'll stay that way for the next 3-5 years. While decline from aging is obviously real it isn't relevant for a 27 year old. And as for whether bobby Ryan will be in the nhl in 3-5 years, that's so obvious even discussing it's ridiculous. Even saying that a team that may be the youngest in the nhl once Phillips and Neil leave is at it's peak is ridiculous."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Benjamin_Butthole,25,Thu May 28 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal.  And I've said this many before.  Hammond is an NHL backup.  Whoever we keep out of Anderson and Lehner will be our starter for next year.  If they falter or get injured, we know Hammond is capable of playing well when called upon.  Matt O'Connor is in no way a sure thing.  We cannot expect him to jump into the NHL after a few years in Bingo and dominate.  It would be awesome if that did happen, but it is not something we can bank on.  Craig Anderson is currently the best goaltender of the 4 we have.  The only issues with him are his age and his injury frequency (I won't comment on any locker room issues because we as fans have no way of knowing if these exist).  It seems based on the age of our team that by the time we are ready to truly contend Anderson will not be a viable option.  If Craig was 5+ years younger there would be no question of who to keep.  This leaves Lehner.  If he becomes what he showed flashes of in the lockout year we will have a bonafide starter on our hands.  If he doesn't, Hammond or O'Connor have the potential to step up.  If we trade Lehner now, we will get something like a third round pick.  It is not worth it to trade Lehner."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,On_Letting_Go,2,Tue May 26 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"I think you summed it up well, the issue with Anderson is the age/timeline. While the issues with everyone else is that they aren't as good.     Why not let the Anderson/Lehner battle continue and look to trade Andy at the deadline next February? The contracts signed last summer still haven't really planned out they way they were intended. Injuries caused two AHL call ups and one happened to steal the show, call it a happy accident but this isn't in the plans for the future.    Only thing Hammond did is maybe give Anderson a little less time on that 4 year deal, and that's only if Hammond develops consistency.    Its difficult to talk about patience in a world of ""OMG I want news now!!"" but it may be the best option. Only other option I can think of, which is much less likely is a big ass package deal.    Currently carrying an abundance of unproven NHL goaltenders, developing top 4 defencemen, developing middle-6 forwards. Package them all and make a splash? Easier in video games than in real life."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Tue May 26 15:48:24 2015 UTC,If we had kept Bishop none of this would be a problem :( Fuck hindsight
OttawaSenators,37bveg,kenata88,6,Tue May 26 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"Who knows if he would have developed the same way in our system, under our management.  It's a game of if's and buts, and while it sucks looking back, who knows."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Bordak,2,Tue May 26 22:57:10 2015 UTC,"On the plus side, we got Conacher!"
OttawaSenators,37bveg,iPoop20,7,Tue May 26 17:18:17 2015 UTC,Don't forget Tobias Lindberg
OttawaSenators,37bveg,T-ohm-y,-2,Tue May 26 18:48:17 2015 UTC,Bishop is a league average goalie at this point. Yes we only got Conacher but I feel Vasilevsky will take over soon enough and we will forget Bishop ever existed.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,jmgk,5,Tue May 26 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"If we trade Anderson, we could get a lot in return for him. The problem is he's the one that enables Ottawa to win games. If Hammond/Lehner struggle next year, it could affect the team's confidence/development. At least with Andy, we know what we're getting.   If we trade Lehner, we'd lose a good prospect that could blossom with another team. But he's kinda struggled ever since he left the AHL. In this case, by the time we let Anderson go, O'Connor would be ready to take over.   I feel so torn... I just hope it works out."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,scienceguy98,3,Tue May 26 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"The chances of O'Connor being a NHL level starter are slim. He's a lottery ticket, which is great, because goalies are a crapshoot; it can never hurt to have a few extra around for cheap. Don't count on him playing more than 20 NHL games in the next 5 years."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,3thoughts,2,Tue May 26 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"With Andy we know we're keeping an older guy who is injury prone and who likely won't be the starter when the team is ready to actually contend.   I think he's the best on paper to move. It's risky, sure, but the payoff is way better. Trading away a young Lehner is risky too, and that could just turn into Ben Bishop 2.0 if gmbm isn't careful."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Lemondish,0,Tue May 26 15:44:16 2015 UTC,He is NOT injury prone.

OttawaSenators,37bveg,Omega613,2,Tue May 26 19:19:47 2015 UTC,Things Craig should do Never
OttawaSenators,37bveg,InTURRISting,6,Tue May 26 19:49:06 2015 UTC,He's been injured in the last three seasons. Long swaths of him not being available or playing sub par.   Yes he is.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Lemondish,11,Wed May 27 02:49:35 2015 UTC,Its gotta be Andy (34) on the move. We're still looking medium-long term and he gives the opportunity to bring in possibly 1 or 2 significant pieces who could pay off in the near future. Or better yet he brings in a young to mid aged guy who makes an impact next year and years to come.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,MelvinFinklethorpe,11,Tue May 26 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"I love our team so much, and it's a shame we couldn't have an experienced enough roster for Anderson.   No disrespect to Patrick Lalime, but Anderson has been our best goalie ever."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,as_hagi,3,Tue May 26 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'd rather have both but from the team perspective going forward Andy makes sense. Its true that it would be a significant blow to our goaltending."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,MelvinFinklethorpe,6,Tue May 26 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"technically speaking Hasek is our best goalie ever, but his time here was so short that Anderson's total body of work surpasses him"
OttawaSenators,37bveg,On_Letting_Go,3,Tue May 26 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"Technically Tugnutt had equal save % on a shittier Sens team, so I give him the edge. But I hear ya, I certainly wouldn't sneeze at Hasek. ;)"
OttawaSenators,37bveg,antonio106,3,Tue May 26 22:24:30 2015 UTC,Tugnutt was my fave as a kid!  I have a binder of hockey cards of him
OttawaSenators,37bveg,On_Letting_Go,1 point,Tue May 26 23:16:31 2015 UTC,If we could get a mid level roster player and a pick for Anderson or Lehner and get Joel Ward in FA I'd consider this off-season a complete success! Obvioulsy resigning our own guys is priority #1 but I'd assume it wont be a problem.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,kenata88,-2,Tue May 26 16:38:36 2015 UTC,I don't see how you could say that. You haven't even seen Lehner play that many games.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Akoustyk,3,Tue May 26 14:44:10 2015 UTC,Say what? That Andy has been our best goalie?
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Lemondish,-9,Tue May 26 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"Andy has the big contract for the remainder. He makes risky moves he needs to learn not to do, and then he will be very good. It can be taught, what he needs. Hammond is good, would make a good backup, but he cannot be a playoff goalie.  Lehner has some value, and is not a key piece of our team.   If you keep Andy and Hammond, then you know we're ok. If you move Andy, then you have a big question mark.   I would move Lehner if it was me, for sure. He might end up a great goaltender, elsewhere, and I hope he does. I don't want to fuck another team. I want another team to give me good value for a good goaltender, and I want my team to be where my team needs to be. If in doing that another team takes a bit of a risk that works out for them, then great.   that's what risks are all about. Some people don't want to move lehner on the chance that he becomes good. But instead are willing to put our number one position in the hands of chance.   I don't think that's smart."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Akoustyk,5,Tue May 26 16:07:42 2015 UTC,Anderson has a very reasonable contract for a top 10 goalie in the NHL.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,kenata88,0,Tue May 26 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"I wasn't implying otherwise. I'm just saying, we pay him to be our number one. We are giving him number one money for a number one position."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Akoustyk,3,Tue May 26 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"Anderson is only going to be good for another year or two.   Martin effin' Brodeur wasn't able to play at a high level after turning 36, how do we expect Andy to?  He won't. He should be shipped to a contender, and we let Lehner/Hammond battle it out to start. In a couple years, hopefully we know our guy when Zib/Hoff/Stone/Turris/Lazar/Pageau/Karlsson/Ceci are all in their prime."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Chili_Palmer,2,Tue May 26 17:16:47 2015 UTC,"This is the best argument, and so for me it would entirely depend on the timetable for O'Conner. I don't know him specifically first hand, so that's an unknown for me."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Akoustyk,1 point,Tue May 26 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Anderson's contract is only for three more seasons, up to age 36. Using your Brodeur example, up until he was 36, he was an elite, 40 game-winning goalie, then he started to fall off. In three years, after we've had an elite goalie for three years, we can let Andy go to FA, and if one of our young guys has developed into a good goalie, he takes over. If not, we sign an FA. Deals can still happen in the future.  I don't understand why people want to sell off our winning goalie for a 3-way crapshoot, just as the forwards & defence are starting to come into their own. Don't you think it would be better if we made the playoffs again next year, and those young guys got that much more playoff experience, so that by the time they peak they know what it takes?"
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Wed May 27 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"I don't want to move him at all, I wanted to let Hammond walk. But obviously that's not happening now.   If the choice is between Lehner and Anderson, and one of them has to go, I'd rather it were Andy."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Lemondish,1 point,Thu May 28 12:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think we have a big question mark with Andy. He's 34 and this team isn't contending for the cup next season. That's two to three years away, maybe, and Lehner will be the guy for us then, not Andy."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,MichelangeBro,4,Wed May 27 02:48:51 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest that I'm a little worried that FO thinks we're ""a piece away"" from contending and will trade Lehner for a top-6 forward. I think we don't need a top-6, but do need solid forward depth (4th line) and a much more consistent defence behind Karl and Meth.  I just have this feeling that we're going to ship out Lehner for a player we really don't need, not make it to a Conference Final before Anderson drops off, and then have no goal tender while Lehner is playing his ass off somewhere else."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,3,Tue May 26 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the Sens are a piece away from being a likely playoff team (capable of making the playoffs without a miracle), but I don't think the team realizes that piece is a good defenceman to play with Wier. Their forwards are fine.  Obviously they need to clear some space, but I worry that they don't know who to clear, why or whom to target.  I really do think this team is a couple good players away from doing well and I am really worried they'll mess this up."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,MichelangeBro,1 point,Tue May 26 20:02:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that if we had an upgrade on one or two positions that we would be definite placeholders for a playoff spot. The thing is though, is that a huge amount of our talent is young and inexperienced. The way I see it, we need to set ourselves up to be real contenders 2-3 years down the road, rather than right now.  In my opinion, trying to fill those spots immediately is just going to hurt us long-term."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,darth_sansa,1 point,Wed May 27 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the missing piece is finding an upgrade on Wiercioch to play with Ceci. The Habs series pretty much proved the gap between our top 3 d (Karlsson, Methot, and Ceci) and the rest."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Iphikratous3,5,Tue May 26 22:04:50 2015 UTC,Wier was better in that series than Ceci... That series got him an invite to Team Canada.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,darth_sansa,-1,Tue May 26 23:08:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the ""eyeball"" test, and Patty scares the shit out of me when he has the puck (especially in our zone). Ceci is by no means perfect, but I'm scared that people highly overrate Wiercioch because he scored a few important goals, and has some nice advanced stats."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Omega613,3,Wed May 27 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"people highly overrate Wiercioch because he scored a few important goals, and has some nice advanced stats.   You know those advanced stats are literally people just writing down what they see with their eyeball tests in an attempt to remove opinion and bias (which we're all guilty of while watching a game)? It's just a more reliable way of doing what you're doing that relies far, far less on our memory and biases.  Corsi, Fenwick, shot attempts, zone entries, pass %'s, etc.etc.etc. are all just factual records of what happened in the game, just like anything else you would find on the scoresheet/scoreboard. People aren't ""overrating"" Wiercioch, they're analyzing independent of their biases. To my eye (critically speaking), Wiercioch is an awkward skater who could really stand to learn how to better use his size along the boards in puck battles (he doesn't need to hit more or anything, literally just be stronger or more aggressive in the corners on the puck to push off other skaters). But there are factual, quantitative records which show that on average when he is on the ice the team is better offensively/defensively on the whole. Looking at those stats, at the root of it all, differs little from taking into consideration Goals, Assists, Shots, Blocked shots, Time on Ice, Powerplay Points, etc. - in other words, don't let the media buzzword ""advanced"" trick you into thinking these are some smoke and mirror stats that are too complex for the average fan to comprehend. If you understand what shots, missed shots, and blocked shots are, you're already set for the most part. Sure, any one stat doesn't tell the full story, and no one is claiming that to be the case. Wier is hardly a perfect player, but in the present tense he is demonstrably better than Ceci by a non-negligible margin. So when you say:   The Habs series pretty much proved the gap between our top 3 d (Karlsson, Methot, and Ceci) and the rest.   ...then you really need to go back and either re-watch or look up the numbers on Ceci. He was our worst dman for 2 of the first 3 games, and generally among the worst players throughout the first 4. Games 5 and 6 were admittedly pretty good for him, but he wasn't good on the whole for that series. But perhaps more importantly, in 5 out of 6 games in the series Wiercioch is statistically better when separated from Ceci (and simultaneously Ceci was worse when separated from Wiercioch), suggesting perhaps that Ceci is slowing down Wiercioch's game in a not dissimilar way to when Phillips was with Karlsson (albeit, with a far smaller gap in current talent :P). I can link you the various stats, but you don't sound terribly interested. But if anything...   The Habs series pretty much proved the gap between our top 3 d (Karlsson, Methot, and Wiercioch) and the rest.   I'm still thrilled with Ceci and his progression relative to his age, but he's our most flawed top-4 dman at present. There's a very real chance he can and will improve, and probably even surpass Wiercioch overall as a defender. But that's not yet happened, and Wier has plenty of room to improve simultaneously, so to rephrase/repurpose one of your own statements: ""I'm scared that people highly overrate Ceci because he looks good for his age, we have a soft spot for the ""local kid"" with a good story, and he often passes the eye test."""
OttawaSenators,37bveg,darth_sansa,2,Wed May 27 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"This is a really solid answer, thanks! Admittedly, I am late to the advanced stats party., but I feel like you and I are actually in agreement. As I've said before, I am well aware what certain advanced stats indicate, and that Wiercioch has some pretty great numbers. My concern (I don't want to seem negative just for the sake of criticism) is that people are seeing his numbers, and allowing that to FAR overshadow some of his inexcusable defensive play (not unlike cowen's size allowed him to get away with poor/slow decision-making). I am a little hard on wiercioch, but you generally seem to agree with me here.  About ceci in the playoffs, in my opinion (as someone who highly scrutinizes defensive play), I don't think he was bad at all. Again, you can criticize me all you like for not digging in to his possession stats, but I generally liked his play against Montreal. Totally subjective, not necessarily fact-based, I know. Didn't ceci also draw some pretty tough assignments?   That's probably a very accurate assessment of why many people adore ceci, and I'm definitely guilty. I should be more specific of why he passes my eye test, but i feel like we might be going in circles."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Nutzillaa,0,Wed May 27 04:27:29 2015 UTC,lol
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,3,Wed May 27 02:58:31 2015 UTC,Ceci was pretty awful away from Weir; Weir was driving the bus there. Weir is the 2nd or 3rd best D on the Sens.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,darth_sansa,1 point,Wed May 27 00:23:32 2015 UTC,"Was he that awful? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seemed that Cowen and ceci played their best with each other, not with Wiercioch."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,3,Wed May 27 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this WOWY table is simple to grasp at first look, but it's as simple as I could find  Ceci's most common partners last season were Cowen and Wiercioch.    Ceci with Cowen - 47.8% Corsi Ceci without Cowen - 49.8% Ceci with Wiercioch - 53.3% Ceci without Weircioch - 46.8%      Btw Weircioch apart was 55.4%  Edit: I noticed you said you're an eyeball test fan, I really recommend digging into current analytics and stats - you'll find that what you look for will change. Most stats people believe in their eyeball test, because they're looking for things that are correlated with winning.   Look at Wier's results, they've been great for a few years now. He's not getting lucky over and over, he's really contributing to the the team's success when he's on the ice. Look at how well he compares to other players, he's been boarderline 1st pairing material."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,darth_sansa,1 point,Wed May 27 02:46:24 2015 UTC,"Oh I know that Wiercioch has far superior advanced stats. I appreciate the help! My issue is that he often looks shaky in our own zone. That chart is very interesting, but unlike advanced stats people, I can't see the correlation to on ice performance. His corsi might be spectacular, but I don't think it negates the boneheaded, cowen-like defensive plays (giving up the blue line too easily, being caught reaching or holding, and blind clearances behind the net)  Anyway, i don't want to be too negative about the guy, so I'll point out that he does have fantastic patience in the offensive zone, and a great shot."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,mike-kt,2,Wed May 27 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"I guess one of my points is that Weir looks silly out there, but good things keep happening when he's on the ice. Something is up with that. It's not that he's just creating a fair amount of offense, in 2014-15 Weir trailed only Methot on the Sens for suppressing shot attempts against. Weir was their second-best defensive defenceman. Something is up with that.   My other point is once you ask these questions, you start looking at the game differently. Your eyeball test changes."

OttawaSenators,37bveg,TorontoMapleQueefs,1 point,Tue May 26 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I could see one of the interested teams being Calgary, with Hiller not really working out in the Ramo/Hiller combo. Because Ramo showed some promise, I could see him being a starter, but still with the need for a backup that can play a lot of games and be capable. With how young the Flames are I could see them being interested in Hammond or Lehner, although the price for Lehner may be higher than what they're willing to give up."

OttawaSenators,37bveg,BradMarshTheAllstar,-2,Tue May 26 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"Murray would have to be an idiot to get rid of Anderson now. Rolling with Hammond/O'Conner takes us out of a playoff position immediately next year.   Hammond's coming back to earth next season. He's going to surprise noone and teams have video on him that they can spend an entire off season/training camp/preseason to break down his game. We don't take it to 6 if he's in net. I don't know why everyone's all of a sudden so ga-ga over him. Yeah, he played well and it was awesome he helped us make the playoffs but he's not some great goalie who's going to become the next tim thomas or something like that.   Championship caliber teams think with their heads and not their hearts and Murray and the front office are getting too swayed by the fan base imo."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,RigidlyDefinedArea,1 point,Tue May 26 18:54:08 2015 UTC,So you think this team is 1 goalie away from a championship?

OttawaSenators,37bveg,czekhthis,1 point,Wed May 27 23:42:51 2015 UTC,this team is definitely more than 1 goalie a way from a championship. you completely missed my point.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,0,Wed May 27 23:42:37 2015 UTC,I dont see why we need to trade anyone at all until Lehner is back and playing. Wait until the trade deadline.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,FixedTheNewelPost,-2,Wed May 27 00:19:44 2015 UTC,Whats the issue with sending Hammond to the minors?  Let the Anderson/Lehner battle continue.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Funkativity,5,Tue May 26 16:04:05 2015 UTC,Isnt hammond's contract one-way?

OttawaSenators,37bveg,Funkativity,1 point,Tue May 26 17:25:17 2015 UTC,That has no bearing on his waiver exemption. EAsports has the waiver status completely false in their games.    Didn't Hammond count as an emergency call up with Lehner and Anderson on the IR?
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Grambo92,1 point,Tue May 26 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"Didn't Hammond count as an emergency call up with Lehner and Anderson on the IR?   yes.. but he's got a new contract now.  what your talking about relates to his previous contract, it no longer applies to the discussion."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Tue May 26 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about that? Not saying you're wrong, I've just never heard that signing a new contract with a team would matter at all.    As far as I've known, since Hammond was replacing the injured Lehner the only stipulation on waivers is that he must return to the AHL immediately once Lehner is activated."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Grambo92,1 point,Wed May 27 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"I've just never heard that signing a new contract with a team would matter at all.   new contract, new terms.   since Hammond was replacing the injured Lehner the only stipulation on waivers is that he must return to the AHL immediately once Lehner is activated.   that doesn't carry over after the season anyway, waivers only count after a season starts."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Chili_Palmer,3,Wed May 27 01:15:53 2015 UTC,It doesn't solve our issue with the Top 6 forward need.   It's becoming an issue every year. We need to understand that we have something that other teams want. It's time to hit while the iron is hot.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Tue May 26 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hear that, the whole league wants 24-28 year old top line wingers though, and how many teams are willing to give one up?

OttawaSenators,37bveg,MooseFlyer,2,Tue May 26 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"I've read on multiple occasions that Boedker is an untouchable and part of their rebuild.   I know what you mean though, the guy is very talented and they would probably look for a D-man in return."
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Funkativity,3,Tue May 26 16:35:18 2015 UTC,one-way deal.
OttawaSenators,37bveg,Nutzillaa,1 point,Tue May 26 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"Answered someone else already, but one-way has nothing to do with it and I thought Hammond was waiver exempt due to Anderson and Lehner's injuries.    Even if he does need to clear, Markstrom in Vancouver cleared waiver just this past season due to good timing. Could easily wait until all NHL rosters are set then send Hammond to the minors."

OttawaSenators,3787kz,peskysens,10,Mon May 25 18:52:13 2015 UTC,It really makes me sad to think we may lose Condra because of bad contracts to guys like Greening/Legwand. ;/
OttawaSenators,3787kz,Omega613,2,Mon May 25 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"I'm happy at least that Dorion said in his recent interviews(s) that they would like to keep him around and will be making an offer 'soon', with the only qualifier being the fact that they need to move out a few players to make roster space (although they have to do that regardless of whether Condra is retained or not)."
OttawaSenators,3787kz,peskysens,7,Mon May 25 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"yea, the management saw his worth in that last month + postseason. HE worked his ass of for us. He deserves to be rewarded for it.   But the guys we need to move are going to bite us in the ass. They are just so bad. Greening, Legwand, Neil, Phillips & Michalek are just not desirable anywhere. While 9MM can still offer some scoring on the 3rd line @ $4M it's a hard one to swallow."
OttawaSenators,3787kz,Omega613,1 point,Mon May 25 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"Probably so, but if no one bites on Greening chances are he gets bought out in my opinion (and from tidbit rumours we've heard). Phillips, not going anywhere I'm guessing, best case scenario he retires but it's looks unlikely to happen based on what we were told in exit interviews. Neil could be traded. We've heard Murray say he might have to take a reduced role (if I recall correctly), but Neil saying he still wants to contribute, and at the trade deadline he was said to be warming up to the idea of moving. Legwand I genuinely think could find a home with reasonable ease so long as he wants to move given his NTC. Milo I imagine we keep, he's over priced (which is part of the reason) but he's a decent PK'er and good in the bottom 6, and supposedly very 'professional'/a good influence off ice. Plus we know he can be called into the top-6 in a pinch, and he matched MacArthur's scoring rate this season despite making less than MacA will in his extension ($4.0Mx3yrs vs. $4.65Mx5yrs).   The other notable names in the mix one would assume are Cowen, Gryba, Smith, and one of Anderson/Lehner (only after Lehner has recovered though). Cowen should be re-homeable but with debateable return and would depend heavily on Murray's desire to give up on him. Gryba is a decent bottom pairing dman but I suspect the team will be more willing to commit to keeping Boro given his ""local boy"" status thus the team might deem Gryba tradeable given some similarity between our bottom two D (and I think Gryba could be re-homed with reasonable ease). Smith I would be happy enough having as a 12/13th forward, but would probably be one of the easiest trades for Murray to coax another team into. Andy and Lehner? I'm not touching that debate anymore for now :P"
OttawaSenators,3787kz,peskysens,4,Mon May 25 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"I would be very happy if we bought out Greening. Very very happy. And I agree Legwand could potentially get moved if he agrees his cap hit isn't terrible and he could be a 3C on a number of teams.  Neil/Phillips I can't see getting moved. I just feel that Murray won't bite on any trades for Neil because they are all going to be incredibly low. Now if Neil asks to move that may be different.   Milo is 50/50 to me, but you are right I was surprised that his points were as high as they are. However I sadly can't take any stats from the first half of the season seriously as MacLean fucked the team so hard it's just incredible lol ;) And while his $4Mil is harsh he has been good to Ottawa and is as you say reliable.   Cowen is the wildcard to me. I really honestly think he can turn into a good D here in Ottawa. But he has been fighting injury and wacky line juggling and inconsistency for a couple years. I do however see him as part of a package deal with on of our goalies.   Gryba is gonzo in my opinion. Boro is who they will keep as that 7th/bottom D, especially if Wideman is coming up.   Smith is a perfect 4th line C. Size and physicality. Can play the PK, defensively sound. I don't want him to go anywhere.   As for Andy and Lehner, I really just pray it's Andy who goes. Lehner is 10 years younger. And it's pretty obvious that trying to move Lehner is going to net us a 3rd at best. Or a mediocre player not working out on another team. Just not worth the risk at all. Looking at it from the Bishop perspective, Conacher didn't work out, but this Lindholm kid looks like he might. But do we want to gamble another goalie now for a player 4-5 years down the road? I really don't think so.  I can see Andy with a combo of Cowen and or a decent pic netting us a good player. Like Yak, Bennette, Sharp.. Depending on how old/young we want to go.   I would love Ottawa to make some blockbuster deal with tampa to get Drouin (who is seemingly on his way out), my lord that would be amazing for the team and the fans!"
OttawaSenators,3787kz,Omega613,1 point,Mon May 25 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"I think we're on a pretty similar page overall actually. I would prefer the team looks at blueline targets before forward targets, and middle pairing quality guy to displace (or support) Wier/Ceci would be excellent. I've not yet figured out who would be a good target for that, but a fringe candidate in my mind has to be Michael Stone. He's a bottom-3 caliber guy, but decent all-around defender and the connection to his brother Mark might be good for the team long term in the form that both may want to stay in Ottawa for the bulk of their careers (perhaps a shade cheaper too). He's pretty average in the league (not necessarily a bad thing), and is a noticeable upgrade over Gryba in many respects.   Skipping to your last point(s), Yakupov I could see being plausible, iff Edmonton was willing to part with him (they've said they're not, but it's always hard to know what's true and what's just posturing, likewise with Cowen and the Sens). Something centered around Cowen+Anderson would surely be tempting (give or take some parts) given that it links to two of their needs, although risky for us since Yak has had a pretty rocky start to his career production-wise. Drouin I can't honestly see happening, mostly in the sense that I don't think we have the (available) pieces to offer to Tampa. Their team is pretty complete and young and they have a reasonable stable of prospects and picks at this point. I've seen arguments from Lightning fans that their defensive depth is lacking (although I would disagree), but I don't envision them seeing Cowen or Gryba as a suitable centrepeice in that trade, so surely they would look else if they were planning to trade Drouin. What sort of package would you be thinking in a trade like that?"
OttawaSenators,3787kz,peskysens,2,Mon May 25 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"For sure we agree pretty much down the middle.  Drouin is going to demand a high price, I don't see Ottawa having the pieces to do it legitimately. Unless it's something like a Chiasson + Cowen + 1st +2nd or something really intense like that. I don't even know if that is close enough.   Outside trades, I would love Ottawa to make moves to try and snag Frolik as a UFA. He is a good top6 player, size/speed/hands And every team that has been unable to keep him regrets losing him. (Chicago & potentially Winnipeg now)."
OttawaSenators,3787kz,hoopopotamus,1 point,Mon May 25 21:29:40 2015 UTC,I thought Frolik was a 3rd line guy in Winnipeg?
OttawaSenators,3787kz,peskysens,0,Tue May 26 03:34:19 2015 UTC,I think he bounced. Mostly because of youth. But he could do the same in Ottawa with Stone. I however feel he has a Clarkson esq deal coming this offseason and I don't want Ottawa in that mess.
OttawaSenators,3787kz,hughtankman,1 point,Tue May 26 03:39:11 2015 UTC,"Ya, we don't even touch Drouin with that offer. Tampa hangs up immediately. It'd be more like Ceci+Zbad+more.  Chiasson is spare parts right now and Cowen is worth more for us to keep to hope he pans out."

OttawaSenators,36rjll,beekermc,3,Thu May 21 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"They didn't have Hammond's tweet up there? I know people outside of hockey don't know his story or his nickname, but if they just had the Hammond tweet there, I'm pretty sure I would have made waves.  By the way, no coincidence, it was partially coordinated with Hammond's fantastic run. Notice how the announcement came out ~post-season + early play-offs?"
OttawaSenators,36rjll,benches48,3,Fri May 22 00:40:51 2015 UTC,He almost actually looks like Hammond in a way. Maybe that's just me.
OttawaSenators,36rjll,TheKandyCinema,2,Fri May 22 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"Hammond thinks so too.  He tweeted about it a couple weeks ago, when they first announced the new hamburglar."
OttawaSenators,36rjll,beekermc,2,Fri May 22 20:42:30 2015 UTC,Hah I just got to see the tweet. Hilarious stuff.
OttawaSenators,36nwga,absolonmoreau,6,Wed May 20 19:26:09 2015 UTC,Nice painting!    Next step is to create a painting of Lazar holding the painting and create a Droste effect.
OttawaSenators,36nwga,broomlad,2,Wed May 20 19:53:32 2015 UTC,Thank you! Haha that would be epic
OttawaSenators,36nwga,Valentine96,4,Thu May 21 02:06:05 2015 UTC,Did you paint it and just hope to meet him or did he hire you or what?  How did this all happen?!  PS:  You talented bastard!
OttawaSenators,36nwga,CaptainKarlsson,5,Wed May 20 23:22:16 2015 UTC,"Haha thank you! He commissioned me to do the piece, so everything was custom done and picked by him! Potentially have some work for other guys on the Sens coming soon"

OttawaSenators,36oov3,TheKandyCinema,46,Wed May 20 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"I think that was a great example of the perfect trade. Both sides got what they needed and both sides ""won""."
OttawaSenators,36oov3,tenders11,8,Wed May 20 23:18:01 2015 UTC,No argument there.
OttawaSenators,36oov3,Valentine96,16,Wed May 20 23:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, the trade made sense.   Methot is a surefire top 4 defenseman, and we gave up a guy who never found his groove.   I like Nicky Fols, I really do - but I'm not ready to say he's a surefire bet to hit those numbers ever again. A good guy, who can set an example on the ice, but to me Michalek/MacArthur fill any role Nick would have had on this team just as well as he does, and are a better bet to continue to do so."
OttawaSenators,36oov3,Chili_Palmer,3,Wed May 20 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"I like Nicky too but I think his numbers are partially a reflection of how good Johansen is.  His competition on the wing are Hartnell, Skille, Atkinson, Jenner, Bourque and Boll which, sorry Columbus fans, is pretty thin.  So no wonder he's getting top line minutes and first power play.  He's also been shooting 16-17% for the last two seasons which seems a bit on the lucky side for a typically 10-11% shooter.  Still, great trade, CLB got a good young winger who finally cemented himself as top-six, Ottawa got a solid #2D.  In fact, I think Methot is criminally underrated, he's a lot more than just ""that guy who plays with Karlsson""."
OttawaSenators,36oov3,ftardontherun,3,Thu May 21 17:46:19 2015 UTC,Part of what makes Methot so valuable is that he's completely content being seen as ''that guy who plays with Karlsson''... he knows how to play the role and does it perfectly.
OttawaSenators,36oov3,PaddleDown,12,Fri May 22 11:28:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's no guarantee Foligno would've developed this way in Ottawa, plus Methot is a fantastic player and complements Karlsson perfectly"
OttawaSenators,36oov3,shining_,12,Wed May 20 23:32:44 2015 UTC,Remember our defence at the beginning of the year when Methot was injured? I think that's your answer.  Foligno was a fun guy to watch but I don't think an extra 30 goals a year would make up for our non-Methot defence.
OttawaSenators,36oov3,Boonedoggle,2,Thu May 21 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"That's a great way to look at it, not having Methot is like losing a 30-goal scorer, because he'll easily save you that many over time."
OttawaSenators,36oov3,ftardontherun,4,Thu May 21 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"Happy to see Foligno succeed, always loved him and his style.  That said, we gained a top 4 D that slows things down and allows another defensemen to put up +30 points over if he was playing with some plug.  I'd say we won, but CBJ didn't exactly lose."
OttawaSenators,36oov3,InTURRISting,3,Thu May 21 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"allows another defensemen to put up +30 points over if he was playing with some plug   He's no Kuba, but he's Ok I guess."
OttawaSenators,36oov3,ftardontherun,3,Thu May 21 17:50:40 2015 UTC,Both teams won this trade. Karlsson got the security he needed in a pairing and the blue jackets got a captain.   i don't know much of how Methot was in CBJ but I do know that Nicky sadly was not finding his spot in Ottawa. I really loved him on the team and wanted Ottawa to keep him but in the end we had other guys who could take over his role and we needed that rock on the blue line.
OttawaSenators,36oov3,peskysens,2,Thu May 21 16:51:38 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel. Typical ""hockey deal"" both sides happy. However, obviously Ottawa wasn't looking to give up a near PPG player for Methot."
OttawaSenators,36oov3,JackLeiper,2,Thu May 21 21:15:18 2015 UTC,I think the trade was great. Foligno had a great season on a team that didn't make the playoffs and it'll be a big stretch for him to repeat the success. He's gotta be happy about getting huge $$$$ now.   Being named a captain doesn't change anything about that trade.

OttawaSenators,36ouxt,housewife_hell,5,Thu May 21 06:12:33 2015 UTC,right. because putting our trust in a guy who played well for 25 games over a 23 year old goalie in Lehner is such sound logic..
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,DawnaBard,20,Thu May 21 13:44:38 2015 UTC,Can we have Hertl? Because I think Hertl and Lazar on the same team would be adorable.
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,Omega613,29,Thu May 21 00:39:18 2015 UTC,That could be a rip off for us because Hertl and Lazar might be the same person.
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,InTURRISting,9,Thu May 21 01:45:19 2015 UTC,the same person   One scores dirty goals and the other scores dirty goals.  Just depends on your definition of dirty.

OttawaSenators,36ouxt,Ynnad00,4,Thu May 21 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, ""rip-off""? Everyone needs more Lazar in their life!"
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,Chili_Palmer,9,Sat May 23 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"We need a playmaking forward and a top 4 defenseman, but that's a steep price to play for a young netminder.   I'm not sure the sens are ready to sell on his potential yet, they may shop Andy around to see what they can get for him.   That said, it wouldn't take a king's ransom to pry Lehner out of Murray, IMO."
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,Omega613,6,Wed May 20 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly? No clue, but it's a good question.  The problem is that after a poor season and the potential for lingering damage from his concussion, his value is at an all time low.  So my guess is that the upside we stand to gain from him might exceed what teams like yours are willing to pay, thus making him relatively untradeable from our perspective. That is, unless your GM is very gutsy and will to take the gamble (so for the sake of discussion, let''s pretend he's ignoring the concussion).  The other complicating factor is that goalie value is so random, and more often lower than we as fans might perceive (unless we're talking star goalie, of course, and those are rarely traded while young or in their prime).  If it were me playing mock GM, and Lehner is a ""must have"" on your list, I would be looking to do a quantity for quality deal, rather than a 1-for-1 trade. We have a number of genuinely decent (but unspectacular) depth players than we HAVE to move this season (our roster currently sits at 26 players if you include our restricted free agents and 1 UFA, plus two guys in the AHL, Chris Wideman/Derek Grant, may demand 1-way contracts or leave via their UFA group 6 status.).  Our shopping list likely includes 2nd pairing Dman, notable prospects/high picks, and perhaps a top-6 LW (most of us fans disagree, but Murray seems to think so).  I can only assume Vlasic would be off the table (and rightly so), but what's the read on Braun? I don't know much about him, but seems like a defensive defender for the most part, and overall very similar to what we've got in Methot. Not a huge fan of his contract (at least while not knowing much), so you would have to take back the equivalent value in the return (but likely with less term).  Knowing very little, would something centred Lehner+Gryba (RH defensive dman, physical, skates well, shoots poorly, bottom pair) for Braun be interesting to the Sharks? That would likely be give or take some other components, and pending more info on Braun too. We could probably also add Zack Smith, but might need a (middling?) pick or prospect added on your side, for example."
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,mike-kt,2,Thu May 21 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen in previous comments and other research it seems as if both teams are currently looking for similar things. Our top need right now would also be another top 4 defender. I'm not sure if Wilson would be willing to get rid of a younger one who's showing real promise atm for a goalie. The real strength the sharks have right now is scoring and young players who are NHL ready (Karlsson, Hertl, Nieto, Wingels, etc) At this time last year I would think there is no shot that Hertl could be had but If the organization is content with our center situation I could see him being the centerpiece of a trade because he is certainly skilled enough to be a top tier second line center."
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,mike-kt,2,Thu May 21 04:57:03 2015 UTC,So mueller would be off the table?
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,MelvinFinklethorpe,3,Thu May 21 15:10:10 2015 UTC,I'd think so

OttawaSenators,36ouxt,TotoroZoo,4,Thu May 21 06:23:48 2015 UTC,If you can convince him to leave I could deal with that. We have a couple of guys and will be adding more this year at the draft.

OttawaSenators,36ouxt,peskysens,2,Thu May 21 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"Man, what is it with Ottawa fans thinking teams will give up future HOF'ers* for guys who haven't proven anything in the league and don't project that well either.  Like, you don't honestly believe the Sharks would give up a perennial 30-goal guy who's played over 1300 games AND a prospect for a back-up goalie who regressed a little bit this past year and is coming off a season-ending concussion, right?  Plus, Marleau has a no move and recently built a brand new home in California so there's no chance he'd ever come to Ottawa."
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,MynameisInig0,2,Sun May 24 22:25:58 2015 UTC,Marleau will be 36 before the season starts.  It's a 12 year difference in age.  I guess if you project Lehner to be bad his whole career you're just going to want the guy that can play.
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,peskysens,1 point,Mon May 25 01:56:54 2015 UTC,My issue here is Marleau's age. Ottawa isn't in a win now scenario and Patty is getting old. Ottawa needs players who are in that 22-28 range who can build with the team not offer a 1-2 year offensive boost and retire.
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,TheKandyCinema,1 point,Thu May 21 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're closer to contention than people think.  Acquiring a guy like Marleau would increase this already fast team's speed and fill in a gap on our offense.   I mean, if SJ was willing to part with Brent Burns for Lehner, I would prefer acquiring him simply based on age."
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,TrulyMagnificient,8,Thu May 21 17:56:14 2015 UTC,We are close. But we are not 1 season close. Especially if Hoffman/Stone have the dreaded sophomore slump.   Also kids like Ceci/Lazar just don't have the experience yet. Zibby is still 21/22 as well.   I wouldn't cry if we got Patty. Just not what I think Ottawa needs to focus on.
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,TheKandyCinema,3,Thu May 21 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting down voted.  Seems credible to me. Our emerging core players are in their infancy, they need to show up and produce again next year to show that they are the real deal and not just a statistical blip."
OttawaSenators,36ouxt,Nutzillaa,2,Thu May 21 22:57:16 2015 UTC,Hehe I don't sweat the down votes :) some people like to discuss. Some like to vote :)  Next season to me is key. If Stone continues to play like a true top6 and Ryan gets his game back. We will be in a good place. Hoffman should stay steady with his age.   Lazar and Zibby are my main worries. Zibby has had a good season. But he had a bad one the year before. I hope he trends up. Lazar is just crazy young. He is an unknown next year to me.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,On_Letting_Go,3,Wed May 20 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"Where would you start?  Only real team who needs a starting goalie is EDM.   We have the opportunity to trade Andy, a D and a prospect for a member of that EDM team.   I know they're going to be hesitant because both Chiarelli and McClellan will want to see what they have.. but at least call."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Grambo92,6,Wed May 20 14:42:32 2015 UTC,Does anyone think STL might be looking for a playoff proven goalie too? Would be a great place to nab a solid top 4 D as a return as well
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iJaysus,3,Wed May 20 14:54:19 2015 UTC,I love Shattenkirk but he's almost untouchable in my eyes.  STL would be a great location to grab that top 6 forward.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Grambo92,2,Wed May 20 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"Does Zybnek have anything left on his contract? And I agree, we could probably throw in some picks/prospects and get Oshie on a great contract"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iJaysus,1 point,Wed May 20 15:06:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't invest too much into Oshie. He's a great player but our right wing is full.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,iJaysus,2,Wed May 20 15:35:28 2015 UTC,Andy has played well in the playoffs but I hardly think St Louis is looking for a guy who's only been past the first round once
OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,3,Wed May 20 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"His #s tho. I'd say he's much better than Elliot and has more experience than Allen, and a goalie with a ""cup winner"" pedigree is usually tough to steal from teams without overpaying. They could go with signing Niemi this year, but I think Anderson is far better. Makes a lot of sense to me, but who knows what OTT/STL mgmt is thinking"

OttawaSenators,36mlca,walahiguy,2,Wed May 20 14:46:08 2015 UTC,Who do you see as a possible return from Buffalo? They don't have anything but youth who they plan on building with.  And SJ has a thing for not trading players with any promise unless it benefits them tenfold.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Grambo92,3,Wed May 20 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe Zadorov for Anderson, or the NYI 1st for Lehner. And yes, I'm being very very optimistic"

OttawaSenators,36mlca,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,3,Wed May 20 14:49:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Edmonton would be preferred but I suppose it depends mostly on the return"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,On_Letting_Go,2,Wed May 20 14:50:27 2015 UTC,a top 6 forward seems to be the only thing on his mind.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,2,Wed May 20 14:56:32 2015 UTC,I strongly believe Yakupov still holds a high level of potential in the right atmosphere where he's told to go score goals.   Our needs are a legitimate top line center and a top 4 d man.   I don't think Nugent-Hopkins will be traded until Draisaitl has developed. And even then RNH has serious shoulder injury problems.  Not my top choice.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Grambo92,4,Wed May 20 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Our need is not a Centre, its a top 6 LW and a 4th D to play with Ceci.  Yak surely has tonnes of potential but he is a RW and Bobby/Stone are locked in our top 6"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,On_Letting_Go,4,Wed May 20 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"4th D to play with Ceci.   I see Weircoch getting second pair minutes this coming season, he has been playing well, and I'd be comfortable with that pairing."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Bordak,2,Wed May 20 15:07:22 2015 UTC,"Wier and Ceci are both good options for a second pairing puck moving type however ideally we would have EK/Meth, Ceci/Meth-type, and Wier/Meth-type (Boro or Gryba)  Wiercioch would still get PP2 time to make up for playing bottom line 5 on 5, and it would spread out the wealth a bit"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,On_Letting_Go,3,Wed May 20 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"I consider Ceci to have more potential to grow as the defensive minded D, as opposed to being the primary puck mover.  Maybe that is just me, but it's how I saw it this past season."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Bordak,1 point,Wed May 20 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"Just a quick reminder: I think Wiercioch should be our 3rd, and Ceci our 5th defenceman. Here's  Wiercioch's HERO chart, if you forgot:"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,BoobieRyan,2,Thu May 21 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"Fair, But Yak shoots left.   He played a bit of left wing in Sarnia. It wouldn't be hard for him to find that groove again, I would imagine."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Grambo92,3,Wed May 20 15:04:25 2015 UTC,There's also the factor of Ottawa avoiding Russians like the plague.  Not that I'd be upset if we became Yak City

OttawaSenators,36mlca,Grambo92,3,Wed May 20 15:07:43 2015 UTC,San Jose might be a place.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Lemondish,2,Wed May 20 15:29:54 2015 UTC,That would not surprise me either
OttawaSenators,36mlca,On_Letting_Go,9,Wed May 20 15:31:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe this will be controversial, but I hope that this shows that the team isn't in a ""win now"" mentality.   I might be reading too much in to this, but signing O'Connor and Hammond sounds to me like Andy is on the way out. Give Hammond a shot at starting, hope that Lehner is able to step in if needed, and then a few years down the road, we'll hopefully have a more proven Hammond (good or bad), a Lehner whose potential we have a better idea of, and an O'Connor with development to make the conversation interesting.   I would not be surprised to see Andy traded for picks or a guy with potential, or a combination.   Again, I might be reading in to this too much, but signing Hammond says to me that we're willing to take risks now in order to set ourselves up better in a few years' time. And I think I'm happy about that."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,MichelangeBro,1 point,Wed May 20 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"I like your thinking, except for giving Hammond the starter job.  He will be a solid backup, but I don't see him being capable of starting full time.  So just reverse Hammond and Lehner in your post and we have something to start with ;)    BUT as I said in an earlier comment...I feel that the Sens management is in a ""win now"" mentality, and they are likely to go with Andy/Hammond."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,broomlad,4,Wed May 20 20:03:37 2015 UTC,I don't think Lehner has proven himself any more than Hammond has. They should be made to fight for the starting role. My post assumed Hammond would start because of Lehner's concussion.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,Hoxtilicious,1 point,Wed May 20 16:09:31 2015 UTC,Meh.  It's cheap enough it's not a huge loss even if we have to pay him $1.5 to play in Bingo in a couple years

We'll have another Ben Bishop situation all over again."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,mikegian,18,Wed May 20 14:28:58 2015 UTC,Trading Anderson makes the most sense.  He's 10 years older than Lehner.  Ten years.  Lehner will be better than Anderson soon.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,On_Letting_Go,17,Wed May 20 14:34:12 2015 UTC,That's the hope.  But what a gamble.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,mikegian,14,Wed May 20 14:36:44 2015 UTC,By the time this core is ready to truly contend Anderson would be too old anyway.  It's not really much of a gamble at all if you really think about it
OttawaSenators,36mlca,On_Letting_Go,10,Wed May 20 14:37:28 2015 UTC,The gamble is if Lehner turns into the goalie everyone expects him to be.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Boonedoggle,14,Wed May 20 14:39:18 2015 UTC,"I understand but even if Lehner doesn't, by the time we need a solid starter Anderson wouldn't be an option anyway.  Better to hold onto Lehner than Anderson.  The real gamble would be whether we could find a replacement for Andy if we got rid of Lehner"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,InTURRISting,9,Wed May 20 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"I was originally on the anti-Lehner bandwagon but this viewpoint has been making more and more sense over the past few weeks.   If we trade Lehner, we have to find a new goalie anyway, because Andy will be too old by the time we can truly contend. If we trade Andy, we at least have a chance of Lehner becoming a solid starter."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Boonedoggle,3,Wed May 20 15:22:29 2015 UTC,To accept this means you believe Hammond is not an NHL calibre goalie.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,InTURRISting,1 point,Wed May 20 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"I think he could be good for ~30 games a season in an a/b role, and he would absolutely be one of the league's best backups, but I don't see him as a career #1 the way Andy is and Lehner was/is supposed to be."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,BoobieRyan,1 point,Wed May 20 20:06:17 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I don't totally disagree with the that scenario being likely

OttawaSenators,36mlca,chumpawumpa69,2,Thu May 21 03:58:12 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I see what you're saying.  That's a fair point."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,BoobieRyan,3,Wed May 20 14:43:18 2015 UTC,"It is a HUGE gamble, but I feel like there are enough decent veteran goalies around that we can trade or sign one if the bottom falls out for Hammond and Lehner.  That said, it's tough saying goodbye to Anderson.  He's the best we've ever had by far.  I don't envy management right now."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,chumpawumpa69,2,Wed May 20 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"At the same time, Andy could probably fetch a MUCH better return than Lehner. If Andy becomes irrelevant soon (like most goalies do at this age), we will bang out heads against the wall for not trading him and letting him walk or be crap."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,_bobbykelso,1 point,Thu May 21 03:59:11 2015 UTC,You gotta imagine a team like St. Louis would trade for him.  They can't go in to another playoff with Brian Elliott and Jake Allen.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,PRND1234,0,Wed May 20 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"I would have made that gamble last year, but this concussion Lehner is suffering from makes me nervous.   If we trade Andy and then Hammond doesn't work out, and Lehner is forced to retire young, we're proper fucked."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,2,Wed May 20 15:03:38 2015 UTC,"It seems like Murray has been growing our goalie prospect pool because of this situation.  With O'Connor on contract, I think we can afford to gamble on keeping Lehner -- if he bombs, we're not 100% up the creek.  And Hammond seems to be a reasonable choice as starter if Lehner is still on IR come October (Dreidger as backup, though I don't know his situation so well).  Ultimately, if we trade Andy to maximize our return on a goalie, it looks like we have contingencies in place no matter what becomes of Lehner."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,broomlad,5,Wed May 20 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically. Anderson isn't really old and most of his injuries haven't been serious types that cause recurring problems; he can easily remain our starting goaltender for the next 3-4 years if necessary, at which point we'd have either Hammond or O'Connor to run with. Regardless of the team playing poorly for most of Lehner's years and his young age, it's far too early in his career with far too unstable numbers on his part to say he'll be better than Anderson anytime soon."

You can only have one starting goalie on your team. They'll have a ""Ben Bishop"" situation regardless of who they trade."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Akoustyk,4,Wed May 20 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"I think what he means is if you're trading Andy you know what you are trading. A proven, elite level starting goalie. Presumably the return will be better than Conacher.   If you trade Lehner, he could be the next Pekka Rinne and we'll all be left crying. We'll be left with a bag of pucks and a 5th round draft pick :("
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Lemondish,1 point,Wed May 20 14:54:02 2015 UTC,"First of all, that's an IF. Second of all, it is not certain that if that happens he will become a goaltender we should not have let go. Even if he becomes a starter. If the timeline is ok for O'conner to be up for it by the time andy retires, I'm fine with letting Lehner go, no matter what happens.   If it is not, then you have to keep Lehner. But then hammond and o'conner won't get much ice time. The depth would be good though, since for a while were short on goaltenders due to injuries.  Not that things like that happen often, but it would have been real rough, had hammond not worked out quite so well, or had an injury also, or something like that."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,rickysauce36,15,Wed May 20 14:43:44 2015 UTC,Just heard it on TSN 1200.   Continue the Anderson or Lehner trade talk!  I vote Andy.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Lemondish,5,Wed May 20 14:19:51 2015 UTC,"I've had many discussions with friends about this. Trading away Lehner would be the safer option short term as Andy is a proven starter however Lehner won't yield that big of a return (is injured, hasn't had a good season). Trading Andy away will definitely yield a bigger return but if a Hammond/Lehner combo doesn't end up working, we will be screwed for the next year or 2. To be honest I am kind of torn."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,JumpedAShark,11,Wed May 20 15:14:18 2015 UTC,I don't think we should be so quick to write off Lehner considering he's 23 and still needs a bit more experience.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,InTURRISting,4,Wed May 20 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"Also, people seem to think O'Connor will end up being a good replacement for lehner, but he hasn't even played a single pro game yet. Let's not get carried away."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,thebestagirlcanget,1 point,Wed May 20 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"More than 2.   We could be screwed as long as it takes to develop Oconnor, which is a gamble, which could take as many as 5 years (*or not at all)  lehner clearly has had some issues that aren't just ""young goaltender"" issues.  He's had issues with attitude and positioning.    I'm not saying he can't get passed them, but he serious regressed operationally (may be not statistically) this season before his injury.    Lehner will be the one traded- hopefully to EDM, out of division"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iPoop20,20,Wed May 20 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"A Hammond and Lehner duo just doesn't sound safe. With the signing of O'Connor as well, I vote Lehner gets traded."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,18,Wed May 20 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe not safe in the short-term, but long-term I like it. We get a much higher return for Andy at this point, unfortunately."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iPoop20,3,Wed May 20 14:41:38 2015 UTC,"You aren't going to get a high enough return on Andy that would make the risk of serious regression in the next couple years worth it. You'll get a pick, but you'll also get a pick for Lehner. I'd imagine the different won't be in terms of the pick offered but whether a prospect or roster player or an additional lower pick is bundled along with it."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,2,Wed May 20 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"We might have some regression without Andy, we might not. Regardless, we're not going to be a serious cup contender for at least another handful of seasons. Therefore, with the plethora of young goalies we have, we don't need Andy. I like where this team is going, we're going to be a legit threat in the not so distant future. But we're not making a deep playoff run for at least the next couple of seasons. We'll definitely get more than a pick for Andy, and if we get a prospect or two in return, I'd say that potential for long-term value far outweighs any near-term regression.  TL;DR we're not a cup contender for at least a couple of more seasons. Hence, short-term regression is meaningless."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iPoop20,2,Wed May 20 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'd rather my team have strong, reliable netminding while they develop over the next few seasons. I'm not kidding myself and thinking we're a realistic shot at a Cup in the next few years, but I don't want my young core to take a step backwards because we trade away arguably the best goaltender this club has ever had and Lehner/Hammond can't handle the load. A winning environment is huge in sport, and why risk the setback which could impact long-term development? I can also almost guarantee you that we aren't getting a pick and two meaningful prospects for Anderson in a trade, but this summer will tell... although again, I doubt he's going anywhere."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,1 point,Wed May 20 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hope they trade Lehner, but we wouldn't get much for him. Anderson was a rock all year, except for when he got injured. And he's been amazing in the post-season with us. I don't see why we wouldn't get a decent return for him."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iPoop20,2,Wed May 20 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"It's just the goalie market if you look at some trades over the past few seasons... a skater of equal importance to his team would net much more. Bigger name goaltenders have been traded for less, so I don't expect to break the bank on an Andy trade, but I'd be happy with a series of picks anyways."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,mike-kt,1 point,Thu May 21 01:17:34 2015 UTC,Ya that's a fair point.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iPoop20,2,Thu May 21 01:44:04 2015 UTC,"We might not be a cup contender, but the Sens are in their contention window right now. Their young players are good enough and cheap enough to contribute, their veterans (the ones that actually play) are still young enough to be good.  The Sens don't have many more young players that they're waiting on, the future is basically now. They certainly have to peak as a team before Karlsson hits free agency in 4 years. In 4 years Methot, Ryan, Macarthur, Michalek and Anderson will not be able to contribute like they do now"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,OfficialGreenkid,1 point,Wed May 20 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"I would argue that our young players aren't quite ready - for example, Lazar, Prince, Puempel, Ceci, Wideman (?) need more time. Hoffman might need a season or two to become consistent. Pageau seems pretty close to ready. Anderson will be gone in 4 years from now, and to be honest I'd rather have a different top 6 forward than Michalek. I agree about Ryan/MacArthur. However, we could always trade for more top 6 forwards in 3-4 years from now when the team is a more serious contender. The young guys still need time, and I don't think we should rush things just because Ryan/Macarthur/Michalek will be older. They're replaceable in my opinion, though that might be an unpopular opinion."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iPoop20,2,Wed May 20 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"Hoffman is in his mid-20's already, so I wouldn't put him in that group. And besides, why is the window for Lazar, Wiercoch etc more important than the window for Karlsson, Turris, Zibby, Methot etc? Certainly the latter group has more pedigree."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,mike-kt,1 point,Wed May 20 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"In terms of his NHL playing career, Hoffman is really young - this was his first full, breakthrough NHL season. I wouldn't be surprised to see him struggle a bit this upcoming season, but he has a lot of good years ahead of him.   The latter group is still relatively young. In 4 years from now, all of them would still be <30. Of course, the exception is Methot, which is too bad because him and Karlsson are a great pairing. But we'll find someone else to take that role if we have to.   Why? Because it's better to develop a young core. These guys are all playing together and building chemistry. If we develop that young core, like Murray has been doing, we'll be a consistent threat for many years. I'd rather give those guys time to develop and add further prospects than try to make a deep run in the next 2 years. We will not have a run like that in the immediate future, whether we have Ryan, Methot, MacArthur, Andy or not. This team isn't ready for that. Sure, we might have a couple of first or second round exits, but are those really worth throwing away prospects for? I don't think so. We have to be patient.   Look at it this way: Alfie won the Calder in 1996, he was 23 at the time. We didn't have a deep playoff run until 2003. The CASH line wasn't formed till 2005, and we finally made the finals in 2007 - Alfie was 34. We had a plethora of first and second round exits in between, mostly first round exits. I'm not saying we should keep our hopes down until Karlsson is 34. But what I am saying is I don't understand why people are so anxious - our young core isn't going to suddenly expire within 3-4 seasons. Give them time, let them develop and then we'll add the final pieces to the puzzle as necessary. I'm not expecting much from this team in the next 1-2 seasons, and I'm fine with that. The future is bright. And if we trade Andy to further add to that bright future 3-4 years down the road, I'm personally happy with that."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,valleygoat,1 point,Wed May 20 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"Hoffman won't necessarily need seasons to become consistent, he would need them to prove he's consistent. Also what do you want consistency to be, strong corsi%? consistent shooting percentage? (at what %?), PDO over 1000?   Also the Sens have (hopefully only at the moment) boxed out Prince, Puempel and Wideman. I'd love for them to get long looks this year."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Lemondish,-2,Wed May 20 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like we need short term. We could be very dangerous next year with the rookies that have played so well this season, if we get a solid D it's worth the gamble to keep Anderson and go for a run next season."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,mike-kt,4,Wed May 20 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"Dangerous enough to run for the cup?  Man, I want your rose coloured glasses because mine seem broken in comparison."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,twist2002,1 point,Wed May 20 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"It's possible of course. Acquiring two good defencemen like the Islanders did last year is possible, it cost them 2 picks and 2ish prospects for Boychuck and Leddy. Those kind of moves really help.   Imagine if the Sens had played their game 6 lineup for most of the year? They would not have needed that miracle run. Imagine they had signed Stralman instead of Phillips and Michalek, or Perreault instead of Legwand.    It was possible for Murray to really improve this team last summer, but they didn't do it. Their biggest challenge this summer will be clearing cap and roster space"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,iPoop20,1 point,Wed May 20 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"people are insane. fluke out and make the playoffs and they seem to think the sens are a contender all of a sudden.  sens are still rebuilding and won't be a real contender for years to come. trade anderson, he's old and won't be around when the team is actually ready to take a run."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Lemondish,3,Wed May 20 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"That's certainly possible. However, I would not put my money on that happening, even with better D men, because this team is still really young. At this point, I'd rather gamble on the more distant future by getting a higher return for Andy right now - his potential trade value right now is as high as it's ever going to be for the rest of his career/tenure with us."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,InTURRISting,1 point,Wed May 20 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking at. If we're a cup contender next year, then Andy is our guy.   But if not...well, I'm having a hard time giving up on a 23 year old goalie."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,0,Wed May 20 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"Giving up on a 23 year old goalie?   Like this never happens.   Why do you believe that Lehner is not NHL cannon fodder?  Why don't you tell us more about why we shouldn't give up on Lehner, because his development over the past three years has been flat to down.   Thats unacceptable for a developing professional talent.   You don't get worse before you get better."

OttawaSenators,36mlca,Lemondish,3,Wed May 20 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"I love how ambiguous the statement ""I vote Andy"" is in this context :p  I think everyone might be jumping the gun a bit though. Until Lehner has recovered, I don't see how we can possibly make a trade. No one (likely) wants Lehner while his future is uncertain after such a potentially debilitating injury, and conversely we couldn't trade Andy without being certain Lehner has recovered.   I'm not convinced yet that we won't start the season with 3 goalies (one possibly on IR), for better or worse."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Stoet,3,Wed May 20 16:32:27 2015 UTC,That's a good point. It'll be a long season.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,Lemondish,1 point,Wed May 20 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"We really dont need to trade anyone at this point. Lehner is hurt, so it will be Andy and Hammond. Basically until Lehner gets back from being concussed we play hammond... if he sucks we send him down or buy him out and if hes great we might trade lehner at the trade deadline.   But nothing has to happen for at least the first half of the season."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,CatoDarpa,1 point,Thu May 21 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"Lehner is projected to be at training camp from the mouth of Dorion himself. So we at least need one gone before the season starts.   Also, if we can get a deal done before the draft, it helps determine organizational needs for the future. I think that would be beneficial. The longer they wait, the more likely it is that the goalie market slims."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,mikegian,1 point,Wed May 27 02:58:45 2015 UTC,Well 2 weeks ago they were saying Lehner couldnt even get on a stationary bike. So Im somewhat skeptical. Head injuries take forever to heal.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,FixedTheNewelPost,5,Wed May 20 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"One thing I do believe:  I vastly preferred the way this team had to play in front of Hammond than the way they played when they knew Anderson would bail them out.  If Ottawa is to have success in the long run they're going to have to be that responsible, positionally sound team they were during the stretch run.    I'm honestly sick of being a Cinderella squad who rides their goalie to an eight-place finish.  I want to see consistency and the team to take the next step.  So for all that, maybe Andy's the one who has to go."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,33GSG65,2,Wed May 20 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"Last time this team was at that level (beyond a bubble team) they had 3 superstars on the top line, currently Ottawa has 1.     Right now theres an excess of forwards, excess of defence, excess of goaltenders and they have all their draft picks. It's starting to become apparent for me it's time to make a splash."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,3,Thu May 21 00:30:25 2015 UTC,"Although I do think that Lehner will be traded, I don't think that GMBM will go out of his way to trade him individually. He'll be a piece in a bigger trade for a top-6 forward or a top-4 dman, especially with his concussion issues right now."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,marklar901,3,Wed May 20 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"Alright start the armchair GM time. One of Andy or Lehner is going to be traded and I bet 90% of Sens fans are going to be disappointed in the return. Temper your expectations and remember that goaltenders are not worth as much as skaters are on the trade market.   We might get a highish pick back along with a middle-of-the-road roster player, or a lower pick with a promising prospect, but don't hedge your bets on a lot more than that... especially since neither goalie is considered in the NHLs ""elite"" (yes, I know Andy's numbers, but he doesn't have the stature of a Miller, Fleury, Price, Bishop, Rinne, Lundqvist, etc.).  I would expect that Lehner is the guy to be moved regardless of his injury since we have younger guys in the pipe who can take his role in the coming years, and Andy will allow us to win in the meantime and perhaps be moved down the road."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,1 point,Wed May 20 16:43:33 2015 UTC,Isn't O'Connor only a year younger than lehner?
OttawaSenators,36mlca,marklar901,5,Wed May 20 17:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, O'Connor is a year younger... which is why I think all signs point to Lehner being moved. In a perfect, smooth, linear world, Anderson stays for a few years, moves on... Hammond or O'Connor takes over... and if Hammond took over then O'Connor would be next at bat for a starter's role. I like Lehner, but I also see the O'Connor signing as a lack of confidence in Lehner's long-term abilities and a way to give this club potential for linear goaltending progression over the next few years."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,1 point,Wed May 20 19:54:38 2015 UTC,This whole thing has halak and price written all over it. One way or another we won't be happy about the immediate results.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,2,Wed May 20 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"I'm in favour of any of the possible results, I'm just trying to keep realistic about what we'll get on the trade market and about what the team looks like it's setting itself up to do. I'm happy with any of the possible duos going forward, but it looks like it makes more sense for Lehner to be moved based on recent signings."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,1 point,Wed May 20 21:10:07 2015 UTC,O'Connor is like 5 months younger and has literally zero pro experience.  That would be a less than good plan.  Plus what about Hogberg?  Hard to say OConnor is a sure thing to leapfrog him
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,2,Wed May 20 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say any of them will turn out to be anything valuable, just as it's hard to say that they won't. The organization has added enough prospects at the goaltending position that at some point you're going to have to deal a young netminder or they'll be walking away rather than resigning because the playing time won't be there. It's also 7 months younger and since when do we count the months when simply responding to a question regarding age difference? My argument still holds regardless of whether O'Connor  is 5 months, 7 months, or 12 months younger than Lehner."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,5,Wed May 20 21:08:02 2015 UTC,"I posted this in the other thread. I like the singing. I don't care about the term. 3 years is nothing and goalies can be moved at this low of a pay.   1) This could be in pairing with a trade. A team may have come to Ottawa and said if you/we can sign him to a cost efficient deal we can make so and so a trade. Ottawa speaks with Hammond he says cool and it's a go. 2) Lehner may be hurt longer than we know, and Hammond is going to step in and play backup to Andy for the season, half season and then it's all assessed then. If Hammond does an ok job trading him will be easy. 3) Ottawa already has a trade in mind that they ""feel"" is a win/win for them in regards to Andy or Lehner (most likely BUF/EDM) and this was a needed signing to lock down a backup. 4) Hammond just carried this team from 14 points out to the post season, rallied the city and fans and the team to see that while we are incredibly young we can still play a damn good game, and management felt the $1.35M was a worthwhile risk for a team almost $11Mil under the cap."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,0,Wed May 20 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"This could be in pairing with a trade. A team may have come to Ottawa and said if you/we can sign him to a cost efficient deal we can make so and so a trade   I am surprised we signed him up for 3 years.  If anyone else wanted to throw that kind of term at Hamburglar, I would be extremely surprised.  I don't think there would have been a huge demand for him for a single season, let alone 3."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,1 point,Wed May 20 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"I won't like, the 3 years was interesting. But at the AAV it's basically irrelevant. Hammond wanted some security obviously and Ottawa was aiming for low cost.   I think you would be very surprised to see some teams interested in a Goalie who could very well be a great NHL starter, for such a small cost. Teams were paying Bryz 4-5Mil MULTIPLE TIMES!   I honestly don't see Hammond being the one moved however."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,0,Wed May 20 21:38:46 2015 UTC,Bryz posted .920 or higher in 3 of 4 (full) seasons once.  There was a damned good reason he was earning that kind of salary.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,1 point,Wed May 20 22:02:11 2015 UTC,Not 2 or 3 times. He was bought out for a reason. He didn't stand up to the season.  And then another team gave him a shot again he failed. And then again. Fact is for 1.3M any team in the league will take a shot if they need a goalie.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,1 point,Wed May 20 22:24:36 2015 UTC,"You are mistaken.  He was offered a huge contract by the Flyers because up to that point he was a bona fide, highly sought-after NHL starter. He was bought out because he didn't live up to expectations in Philly.  From then on, he never got anything more than a 1-year contract and the first one was for $2 mil.  Hardly overpayment for a long term NHL veteran goalie.  NHL teams are in no hurry to throw $1.3 at a guy with 25 games under his belt, sorry.  He's making more than Lack, Kuemper, Enroth, Freddie Andersen, Mrazek, Dubnyk, Allen, Raanta, Hutchinson, Cam Talbot, Martin Jones, Scott Darling, Tokarski, and Al Montoya."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,1 point,Wed May 20 23:07:46 2015 UTC,Ah well then I apologize. However your comparables are almost all guys on their rfa status still. So that isn't really fair. We damn well know these guys are mostly all going to make a lot more.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,1 point,Wed May 20 23:14:38 2015 UTC,"Point is, if you want to put someone with little experience in net, most teams can do it for a lot cheaper than Hammond."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,1 point,Wed May 20 23:22:28 2015 UTC,Next season the majority of who you listed will be paid more. And some of them a lot more. But yes. There are options. But saying 1.3M is in any way bad or a negative is sorry to me silly. It's a laughable amount.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Disturburger,1 point,Wed May 20 23:24:55 2015 UTC,It's more the term and the situation the 1-way contract creates for our other goalies that worries me.  I also think unloading him will not be easy for anything more than a late round pick
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Xavier26,2,Wed May 20 23:33:09 2015 UTC,"Hammond just signed a very, very tradeable contract, everyone. Sure, it might be a dick move, but I wouldn't be overly surprised if he was traded to a team who wants to take a gamble for a cheap #1"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,popcorn_cake,2,Wed May 20 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"Lehner is the bigger question mark, especially with the concussion. Hammond could be a good backup at this point, but I'm not sure he or Lehner are starters right now."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,roes0024,2,Wed May 20 19:20:24 2015 UTC,Trading Lehner would be a huge mistake.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,5,Wed May 20 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Lehner is on his way out.  If the Senators want to win NOW, and all signs point to them wanting to win NOW, they will stick with Anderson/Hammond.  O'Connor signing pretty much seals the deal on Lehner."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,broomlad,8,Wed May 20 14:42:20 2015 UTC,Ottawa isn't in a position to win NOW. Core is far to young. Unless some blockbuster trade is made and we end up signing an elite player we are still a couple years away from our true contending years. In which Andy will be past due.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,5,Wed May 20 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I agree with you.  But from what I've seen and observed from Senators management, they do not.  I think they are seeing the team that played great down the stretch and are thinking, ""We're 1-2 pieces away from really contending!""    Case in point, GMBM is looking for a top 6 winger when he should be fixing the D."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,broomlad,3,Wed May 20 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"I have to say I agree with the whole top6 Forward nonsense. However I am a believe Cowen will pan out, so maybe my marbles aren't all there ;)"
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,2,Wed May 20 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure of the defence.  I am also hoping Cowen will pan out - I think a lot of people are reading too much into that Don Brennan interview, especially considering it came out that he had surgery for a sports hernia.  I'm also not 100% sure of the top 6...there are clearly issues with Hoffman, or else he wouldn't have been demoted to the 4th line / kept off the powerplay for so long.  I'm not saying he's a bad player, but management is seeing something (or not seeing enough of something) that will definitely affect his next contract.    I guess what I'm saying is, again, I agree with you, this team is not / should not be in the 'win now' mindset."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,junius52,2,Wed May 20 15:10:55 2015 UTC,"Hoffman is an interesting one. Either bad attitude or injury set him on that 4th line. He is a player I would not be surprised to see moved in a package. Not that I want him to be, but it just seems like he might be."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,1 point,Wed May 20 15:40:34 2015 UTC,What does NOW stand for
OttawaSenators,36mlca,junius52,2,Wed May 20 15:21:23 2015 UTC,NOW usually means the next season in my books. Teams like Hawks/Rangers are in a NOW scenario because their cap is going to require moving players.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,PaddleDown,3,Wed May 20 14:35:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like we should have tried for 2 years for sure, however, we're not in too much potential trouble because in the next 3 years we will have Anderson (proven starter) or Lehner (supposed to become proven starter) and Hammond can hopefully play a back up role well enough. If all fails then we could try to make a trade to bring up O'Connor providing his development is going well."

OttawaSenators,36mlca,peskysens,1 point,Wed May 20 20:15:43 2015 UTC,"Last year there were literally zero expectations of Hammond.  None.  We could have missed the playoffs and no one would say it was Hammond's fault.  Got there, Hammond was less than stellar under playoff pressure.  Next year?  If we ditch Andy or Lehner, you better believe he's under pressure.  Now he's expected to be an actual NHL player and get us wins.  If we move either of those guys and Hammond doesn't pull it off, I am pointing fingers and handing out told-you-sos."
OttawaSenators,36mlca,halibb,1 point,Wed May 20 20:58:30 2015 UTC,Ottawa is in a very odd situation. I honestly don't think we have much options other than moving Andy. As it stands we are not going to get much more than a 3rd for Lehner. And I feel that is an INSANE price to let him go at. His comparable's are going to be guys like Lack etc.   Andy has the best possibility to net us something useful now. I can see a package with Andy and Cowen or Gryba or Boro going to EDM for someone like Yak. This of course bolsters our RW meaning we need a guy like Chiasson or Stone to move over to LW if they can.   We are really overflowing with bottom 6 players and its' going to effect our ability to form a roster.
OttawaSenators,36mlca,Sens420,3,Mon May 25 19:01:12 2015 UTC,I was hoping for 2 years max hmm.

OttawaSenators,36mlca,hoopopotamus,2,Wed May 20 16:20:13 2015 UTC,Phillips was only 2 years and I think i read on Twitter that Tim Murray negotiated the Cowen deal
OttawaSenators,36pums,TheKandyCinema,7,Thu May 21 04:07:51 2015 UTC,"We've talked about this author before but....     Maybe everybody is starting to criticize this trade right now because Silfverberg is playing insane in the playoffs right now.   Read that sentence again right now, and see if you can notice anything awkward about it right now.    Now as for the content, the author clearly dislikes Bryan Murray as many of his articles comes down to his supposed mismanagement and questioning Murray's ability as a GM.   Stillman/Commodore, sure you can say its a bad trade, more like an unnecessary trade but the Ryan or Spezza trades are worse? No way in hell. Also, the worst trade Murray has done is a trade he hasn't done?      Defence of the Ryan trade, you never lose a trade which you come away with the best player. That year was the David Clarkson sweepstakes, and the Daniel Alfredsson saga, and Ottawa came away with a bigger name and more talented player than both those free agents.  The argument against the trade says:     At a time when the Senators are looking for forwards, the three they traded are the ones they could use right now.   In what sweet universe is there an Ottawa team that needs three extra forwards right now? They already have 2 in the press box each night in addition to their 2 extra defencemen and goaltender on the IR. There are roster limits you know, and hell I'm sure there even capacity limits in the press boxes themselves.  The reason why Silfverberg was expendable was because of this franchises trust in guys like Stone and Hoffman, and Silfverbergs trade value was higher. That talent analysis was absolutely on point in every single way and was an excellent move dealing from a position of strength knowing who Ottawa had in the pipeline ready to step in.  Brilliant management of assets dealing from a position of strength,  youth and potential, to address a position of need, a big ticket name while the sky was falling.    Spezza trade: Jason Spezza requested a trade, he approached Murray and said he'd be interested in seeing whats out there. This wasn't a management decision to trade Spezza which is exactly what the author said he supported about this deal.   I had advocated for trading Spezza, and I still like that they did it. However, the return wasn’t as good as it could have been.   Or was he only an advocate after Spezza had requested the trade? If that's the case then fuck yeah, I was a strong advocate too. Mr. Murray I really think you should trade the player that just asked to be traded.   I wonder if Murray tried to target some other Stars players, because there were certainly lots of other better prospects that had good years for them. It’s a shame that Chiasson may end up being the “best” piece.   A vague statement like that without suggesting WHO would've been the better target is ambiguous, and the reader is left asking who the fuck the author is even talking about(Edit: Redundancy! See this is why I don't claim to be a writer). I'll assume, since I have absolutely nothing to go off, its Klingberg. The explosion breakout performance from a 22 year old defencemen certainly was a good year. But, what would Ottawa need with a 22 year old defencemen given their roster? And considering how thin the Dallas blueline is, what would taking away Dallas' defensive prospects mean for the other assets in the trade?   Brett Ritchie is a big strong powerforward who is a 2nd rounder, is that who the author means? He's been fighting injuries a lot, as my 30 seconds of research tells me, and Ottawa acquired a big strong powerforward with Nick Paul anyway. Suggesting Chiasson may be the best(no need for quotations) piece, ignores every bit of reporting after the trade stating Ottawa was fixated on Nick Paul and that he was the key asset in the deal. Gaining a roster player in Chiasson also helped prevent regression following the loss of their #1 centre, and gave another young unproven winger a chance to compete with Stone/Hoff for a top 6 wing spot.  In this case, Ottawa dealt from a position of weakness, a trade request from their #1 centre, and had to get the best return possible. They landed a sought after prospect who immediately became the best player in the system behind Lazar, a roster player to add immediate benefit, and a 2nd round pick.      There isn't even a 5th trade in this top 5.   I'm done with this ""senshot"" clutter on this sub. I really enjoy participating in a lot of the discussion had here, but these articles don't contribute to any discussion. Personally, I know zero sens fans, and this sub is my sens analysis outlet. It really sucks to see new (I'm assuming) writers try to grab a little extra clicks on their blogs by offering nothing but vague suggestions that Bryan Murray is bad at his job for some reason. I'm open to actual content and analysis but none of that has been provided."
OttawaSenators,36pums,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Fri May 22 00:42:50 2015 UTC,5 Worst IMHO:    5) Traded away Picard + 2nd Rounder for Matt Cullen    4) Traded away Chris Kelly for a 2nd rounder (Shane Prince)    3) Traded away Dean McAmmond + 1st rounder (Kyle Palmeiri) for Chris Campoli and Mike Comrie    2) Traded away the 2010 16th overall pick for David Rundblad    1) Traded away Ben Bishop for Cory Conacher + 4th rounder
OttawaSenators,36pums,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Fri May 22 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"Kelly for a 2nd? I had no problems with it, especially since rebuild was in full-force. Weren't there even rumours he was going to return as a UFA?   Shane Prince has turned into a good prospect, should play in the NHL. No issues with that deal."
OttawaSenators,36pums,JackLeiper,1 point,Fri May 22 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not a horrible trade. Murray's generally done a great job as GM.   Third liner that wins cups for a guy that can't crack the NHL though. I was a huge fan of Kelly, and keeping him within the division hurt. He consistently consistently shut down Ottawa and won a ton of draws."

You say I clearly dislike Murray, but that's totally false. I mentioned in the article that he's made some solid moves as well, and I'm going to do his best trades in an article soon too. This list was simply his worst trades, I'm not saying every one was awful. Like I mentioned, the Ryan trade is fine, but you have to admit it looks like Anaheim is the slight winner. And yes, I wanted Spezza to be traded before he had asked to go. Sorry, it seems you're upset with a lot of this.

It was one bad trade, 3 mediocre ones, and one that hasn't happened.    Like I mentioned, the Ryan trade is fine, but you have to admit it looks like Anaheim is the slight winner.    No it doesn't. They have one player having a hot streak of 12 games, so what? He only scored 13 goals this year, and didn't break 40 points. Bobby had 5 more goals, and 15 more points in a down season for his standards. They also got Stefan Noeson, who looks like a complete bust due to a rash of brutal injuries, and a 1st rounder they used on Nick Ritchie, a guy who looks like he'll be a fringe NHLer at best.   Sorry, it seems you're upset with a lot of this.    I don't think it's entirely your fault, if he is anything like me he is likely frustrated with the lack of quality Sens coverage available nowadays. Since Yost moved on, there hasn't been much to read by anyone who knew what they were talking about. And no offense, but you don't know what you're talking about in this article.

This one would be my least favourite if Bobby Ryan doesn't end up stepping it up. Nick Paul might solely be worth the entire trade. And that draft pick is still undecided. Tobias Lindberg looks promising, but the Sens were in a goalie situation. There's no promise he would've been the superstar in Ottawa. Teams will want a younger goalie and I can almost guarantee there will be more assets in the trade.   I generally don't hate any of these trades as future is still decided. Talk to me in 5 years."
OttawaSenators,36pums,devin27,3,Thu May 21 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of these pretty much. IMO Bryan Murray's trade history has been a mixed bag where you can't say definitively if overall he's ""good"" or ""bad"" at trading.   Good trades: Elliot for Anderson, Methot for Foligno (Win-Win), Rundblad for Turris.  Bad trades: 3rd rd pick for Filatov, maybe the Bobby Ryan Trade, Definitely the Bishop trade but was in a tough situation.  As an aside it's funny that the Heatley trade isn't in the top 5, and despite our somewhat mediocre return (basically just Michalek) that trade is still considered a win."

But first round exits from the playoffs don't really do much for us.   Ottawa is still 2 years away from contending if we continue to progress as we are. Zibby, Ceci, Lazar all need to age up a bit and get a little more experience. Ryan will still be young and in his prime, Lehner will be hitting the start of what should be his prime and will have lots of experience and the rest of our team is young enough that it will all be right in their prime. (with the exception of Neil, Phillips, Legwand who will hopefully be gone)  I think if Andy can net us either a solid shut down top4 D or a REAL top6 scoring guy in his prime (24-28) then that move needs to be done.   That all being said, Dorion said that they are going to listen to offers, shop around and work out what is the best deal. So it is possible that Lehner is moved as well. This puts us in more of a ""pls win now"" scenario I don't like :/"
OttawaSenators,36obzq,peskysens,5,Wed May 20 21:52:04 2015 UTC,"I love Andy, he's the best goalie of the three (right now), and gives me the most confidence. He's mature, a leader, and seems to be a pretty important guy in the room too. With that said, I think you're right and Andy is the odd man out based purely on our timeline.   We have a solid team right now with a lot of core pieces locked down and approaching their prime. I think you're right in that we're 2 years of development away from being where we want to be. 2 years gives Lehner time to mature into the #1 we need and hopefully gets everyone some more playoff experience.  Knowing he has Hammond and OConnor behind him should put some fire under him too. Meanwhile, Anderson is likely at his peek right now and, in two years time, won't be the man we need. If we can move him to a team that's desperate for some wins (Edmonton/Buffalo) for a good return, now's the time to do it.  I think we'll seen a tandem of Lehner/Hammond next season. I just hope Lehner answers the bell for us."
OttawaSenators,36obzq,halsed,4,Wed May 20 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"Do you have any link to something saying that Lehner is working out? The stationary bike report was only a couple weeks ago, so--I'm not saying that I doubt you--but it would be nice to see a source ;)  Otherwise, I completely agree with you. Our young players are already great, but they need experience and time to mature. Lehner will hopefully become the number one, and our team will have the experience to help him out."
OttawaSenators,36obzq,peskysens,1 point,Wed May 20 22:17:59 2015 UTC,Dorian (Sens assistant gm) said it today on tsn radio. I believe the interview Is on there. I'm on my cell so I can't get it sorry.

He said something along the lines of ""I believe he'll be there for training camp."" To me, that sounds as though he doesn't have a real update and is just trying to assuage fears.  I dunno, maybe I'm just a pessimist, haha."

I am sure he can't say one way or another on the condition for all kinds of reasons. But I am not to worried about it, Concussions (as shitty as it is) are a fairly common thing in hockey and players get through them. Lehner is young, he will be just fine :)"

OttawaSenators,36obzq,Nutzillaa,4,Thu May 21 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"a REAL top6 scoring guy   Who in our top 6 isn't ""real"", in your eyes? Bear in mind that there are 180 top-six forward billets in the league; using the hockey-reference Goals Created measure, we've got players at the following ranks (min 25 GP):    Rank Player    31 Stone   41 Turris   71 Hoffman   83 Ryan   106 MacArthur   124 Zibanejad   159 Michalek    And sure enough, OTT was a very respectable 9th in the league in goals per game last season. I don't think we need more top-6 forwards. I think we're doing pretty well there."
OttawaSenators,36obzq,peskysens,3,Thu May 21 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"I think that Michalek has aged out for 1. I also have a bad feeling Hoffman isn't going to be back. Just a gut feeling something went down. There has to be a reason he was on the 4th line and not given more shots in the playoffs.   Thos being said, I REALLY would prefer we go for D. BUT if we can work a deal for an Eberle or Yak I am not going to complain about it.   Mac - Turris - Eberle Hoff - Zibby - Ryan  9MM/Pageau - Lazar - Stone   this would be a fantastic lineup. HOWEVER again I would much prefer to bolster our blue line."
OttawaSenators,36obzq,Nutzillaa,1 point,Thu May 21 01:00:54 2015 UTC,"He was relegated to the fourth line because Cameron didn't trust him in the neutral/defensive zones.  I haven't looked at the numbers but I don't remember him being a turnover machine, rather just a guy who plays a sketchy brand of hockey that makes coaches nervous.  For example, he holds onto the puck way too long in the defensive zone and has a tendency to circle back towards his own net when he's breaking out and doesn't like the look he's getting from the opposing team.   Personally, I find it funny how Murray keeps saying they need another top six guy. Hoffman had like 26 even-strength goals last year and will be a fraction of the price of someone of that calibre on another team."
OttawaSenators,36obzq,peskysens,1 point,Sun May 24 22:41:18 2015 UTC,I agree with you. But I honestly feel like there was some sort of issue with Hoffman and the coach or someone. I have a suspicion he won't be back. Packaged in a trade. I hope not. But I feel like it.
OttawaSenators,36obzq,TorinK92,1 point,Sun May 24 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Well, why do you feel that way?  He didn't communicate any frustration with the coach/management to the media sat any point during the season."
OttawaSenators,36obzq,detroyer,1 point,Sun May 24 22:54:21 2015 UTC,Mostly from media and interviews. Both with Hoffman and the staff. Every time he is brought up it's fairly blown off and basic comments. Unlike say Stone who is praised and cherished for his accomplishments (deservingly so). And when Hoff was interviewed or asked about his future with Ottawa it's always been very dismissive etc. I dunno it's just a gut feeling. I would love to be wrong.

OttawaSenators,36nni9,Dk_krypton,16,Wed May 20 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"Meh. It's not going to matter much for a few years, and that assumes Toronto's rebuild is successful.   And although Babcock is a very good coach by all accounts and looking at his resume, coaching the 2007-2009 RWs to cup finals as well as Canada to gold was surely not as lofty an accomplishment as it might've been with different rosters. Don't get me wrong, he's a good coach and will surely help Toronto, but that alone does very little to transform them into a contender.  Also, do we know how good Babcock is when coaching young players? Most of Detroit's prospect callups have always been nearing 22-24 by the time they hit the NHL, so Babcock hasn't been instrumental in their success or development. I doubt that will be the case in Toronto - how long before people are pissed off because he's scratching Nylander or Marner in favour of ""veterans""?"
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,5,Wed May 20 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried about Babcock's pedigree or record of medals and cup finals.

OttawaSenators,36nni9,marleyman3389,-2,Thu May 21 16:28:37 2015 UTC,Here's my question:  how is what Babcock has done any different or less disrespectful than what Lebron James did?  He even had a TV interview next to the boss (and friend) he was about to give the shaft to.
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,2,Wed May 20 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Babcock didn't owe Detroit anything, at all. He gave them 10 years. He didn't shaft them, he didn't blind side them, he didn't lie to them. Even in the interview he didn't in any way hint he was going back to Det for sure.   The man took a god damn raise, anyone who thinks he shafted, cheated, screwed over or was disrespectful to DET is being a fool. Every single person alive would take a raise of that magnitude if offered to them for the same job. Period."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,peskysens,-1,Wed May 20 21:42:03 2015 UTC,"Well, neither did Lebron.  But he was ripped to shreds."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,5,Wed May 20 22:05:32 2015 UTC,"The only reasons Lebron was torn apart were because a) he booked an hour long TV special about himself with ESPN to make the announcement, and b) he was leaving his hometown who drafted him, the seemingly perfect cinderella story for a city who never wins anything.   Babcock is going home to the city with a history of losing, and  didn't announce it live on TV with a douchey statement. He's also taking on a challenge, where Lebron went with two other superstars at the time to take the easiest possible path to a title."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Wed May 20 23:50:37 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about the LeBron scenario admittedly. Just this Babcock witch hunt is hilarious to me.
OttawaSenators,36nni9,peskysens,0,Wed May 20 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"What exactly did this LeBron James fellow do? I've heard a few comparison's of that nature today, but know little beyond ""he plays basketball""."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,0,Wed May 20 19:22:43 2015 UTC,LeBron left his team (the Cleveland Caveliers) to go to Miami because they threw big money at him. he could win a championship.   Edit: Apparently it wasn't about the money. My mistake. Thanks for the correction
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Jthedude17,2,Wed May 20 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"No. Lebron James left the Cavs to play for a winning team. Bosh and James both agreed that if they moved to Miami, they would become championship contenders.  Also, Wade and Bosh were good friends of his, making the transition easier. He could have earned the same or more in Cleveland."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Baby-punter,3,Wed May 20 20:45:38 2015 UTC,"I figured as much, but I don't know the context nor the normality in the NBA.  For example, in the NHL, it's not unusual for a player to leave during free agency, very often going to the team with the loosest wallet. Not always, but often enough.  However that almost never seems to happen with coaches, doubly so since they usually coach one team until the day they're fired. Not only was Babcock still wanted by Detroit at the end of things (and not fired), but he also left and took the biggest paycheck it would seem (although we don't know for sure if there were other factors, of if Buffalo/Detroit weren't willing to match Toronto's figures).   During the season at some point, one of the notable analysts (Bob Mackenzie?) has said Babcock wanted to see coaching salaries in the NHL go up (he thinks they're underpaid relative to their job), and to do so he figured he had a duty to negotiate as high as possible to elevate that ""ceiling"" for coaching salary. Now I don't know if that's all true (nor if I am misunderstanding/misquoting something), but it seems like a move motivated not (entirely) in selfish desire.   Was LeBron ever said to do the same? And is it unusual for NBA players to leave teams during free agency in pursuit of a larger paycheck? This where I'm uncertain about the comparisons knowing as little as I do about the basketball world."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,0,Wed May 20 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"For example, in the NHL, it's not unusual for a player to leave during free agency, very often going to the team with the loosest wallet. Not always, but often enough. However that almost never seems to happen with coaches, doubly so since they usually coach one team until the day they're fired.   I think this is going to become more common - this happens in the MLB and often players are involved in terms of compensation to other teams.  I hesitate to guarantee it, but it's my opinion that this will be a sticking point in the next CBA."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,broomlad,0,Wed May 20 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"If so, then this (and the potential need to pay future coaches a lots more) is what impacts the Sens and other NHL teams the most - far more I feel than a rival team getting a notable coach in my opinion."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,1 point,Wed May 20 19:57:30 2015 UTC,"For sure.  I think the biggest piece of this news is that a head coach just got an 8 year deal worth $50 million.  It would be big even if it was a smaller market team (wasn't St. Louis also in the running?).  You're going to see that price tag attached to his name in every headline, and you're right, that's huge for the NHL and the other 29 teams."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,broomlad,2,Wed May 20 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"Babcock is making $6.25M per season. I know coaching salaries are far less advertised than players salaries, but last I had heard Quennville was the highest paid and at ~$3.0M-3.5M/yr.  This is pretty much double the next highest paid coach, and around 50% more than most people speculated he would make on his new contract.  It's easy to look at players and think the difference isn't all that massive, but it would be like Tarasenko signing his next contract for $20M (salary cap issues aside) or something."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,0,Wed May 20 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense, the CBA is between the players' union and the NHL.   Coaches have no such union or agreement, and as such are free to go to the highest bidder."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Chili_Palmer,0,Wed May 20 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"It might, if NHL teams start seeking money and/or players as compensation for coaches."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,broomlad,1 point,Thu May 21 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but that would also require a buy-in from the coaches.   I don't see how it could happen.  The only coaches that anyone would be able to ""trade"" are coaches in demand. Why would coaches in demand, when they sign a new deal, agree to be traded? They wouldn't.  And because coaches have no guaranteed contracts, they can be fired. teams really have no incentive to start doing this."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Chili_Palmer,-2,Thu May 21 14:18:58 2015 UTC,"He also hyped it in the press to an endless degree.  He held a TV special where he announced his decision.  It was a massive ego trip, and Babcock did essentially the same thing."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,0,Wed May 20 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, well then it's important to remember that Babcock was really not drumming this up at all. Every time he was questioned, it was a ""PR friendly"" non-answer that said he was weighing various options and would reach a decision soon and when the time was right.  Every little rumour and update was entirely  constructed by the media and/or the fans - and that's just a product of the information age we live in and the nature of being a ""sports celebrity"" with potentially large impact.   So to address your original question of ""how is what Babcock has done any different or less disrespectful than what Lebron James did?"" (assuming I understand the LeBron situation adquately), I think it comes down to intent. LeBron made this a spectacle and fed into the media, Babcock tried to do his due diligence by ensuring the job he took was right for him and the media/fans were responsibly for the publicity. The Babcock show was very very similar to that of O'Connor's situation recently."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,-2,Wed May 20 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but that is nonsense. Babcock knew exactly what he was doing and he did it to drive up his price."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,0,Wed May 20 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"Proof? Source? Otherwise - that's nothing more than an opinion. An opinion that may be right, or it may not be. But the definitive statements (and possible downvote) seemingly suggest you're pretty darn confident, and now I'm curious as to why?  You've shot down by comment by simply saying ""that's nonsense"" without explaining how/why you've come to that conclusion. I can point you to numerous analysts and tweets (see: Mackenzie and Friedman, for starters) all of which have had conflicting information based on who-knows-what and ""opinions"" that quickly became spread like they were fact by fans. Yesterday, Toronto was ""definitely out"", today they sign him. That happens every time thanks to media member pulling the trigger on a take in order to be ""first"" to report it. It's similar to what happened with O'Connor, where a couple days before his decision Edmonton was ""definitely out"", but within 24 hours that was reported false and we know they were in the running up until the last moment (O'Connor called to inform them he was signing elsewhere much the same as he did NYR/VAN).  But even if you can't provide proof that Babcock manufactured the hype - then at least tell me why he would've done so and how else he should have handled an important personal decision such as this to avoid the publicity? And with regard to the former half of that question, I don't believe for a second he would have received less money without the public updates - sounds a whole lot more like Buffalo and Toronto were willing to open their wallets pretty wide to outbid one another and those negotiations would just as easily have happened behind more tightly locked doors."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,1 point,Wed May 20 20:54:14 2015 UTC,"I can't provide proof for an opinion, just as you can't provide proof for yours (all you pointed out were the opinions of others, not proof).  But Babcock is a smart guy and he's leveraging his high profile for more money.  The media will always offer you a chance to make a jackass out of yourself, but it takes a big ego to oblige them.  The TV special was what I found most disrespectful, and that was exactly the same thing Lebron James did.  There is no difference between the two of them in terms of the way they managed their moment in the spotlight.  Except the obvious, of course."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,-1,Wed May 20 21:25:32 2015 UTC,You're being an ass.
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Chili_Palmer,-1,Wed May 20 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"Damn, I got told."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,10,Thu May 21 00:21:17 2015 UTC,I realize that Babcock is a good coach.  I get it.  I also think there are better (or equally good) coaches in the NHL (Quenneville and Sutter for starters).  But who cares?  The Leafs are still a terrible team and no amount of coaching can fix the fact that they have a lousy roster.  Ron Wilson and Randy Carlyle were geniuses when they came to Toronto as well.  edit/sp
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,4,Wed May 20 19:10:57 2015 UTC,"As far as building toward a competitive Leafs team, I think having Dubas/Hunter as (interim) GMs has far more impact that we (as rivals) should worry about. The former is well versed in the stats side of things, and the latter has a long-standing background in scouting."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,0,Wed May 20 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Players are always more important than coaching, especially today when coaching is really good across the board.  Also when it comes to coaches, the most important thing is finding a fit.  At this point I wouldn't choose Babcock over, say, Dave Cameron just because the team responded to our guy so well.  Don't fuck with the formula and all that.  Babcock may be a great fit in Toronto for all we know, but it's by no means a guarantee."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,3,Wed May 20 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"I find Dave Cameron's perspective on the position interesting and in stark contrast to recent coach signings.  In several interviews, Cameron has repeated how ""a coach is only as good as his team"" and that he's at the forefront for all blame, so a coach is the best or worst person in the world entirely dependent upon the success of the team. He has a refreshingly pessimistic (yet realistic and somehow positive) outlook on the head coaching job :P"
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Omega613,3,Wed May 20 20:00:40 2015 UTC,I think you are really undermining what Shanahan is doing. Or simply ignoring it because you are bias.   Babcock is just another cog in the machine that they are rebuilding. He is easily the best available coach. Possibly the best in the league.   TO can quickly become the next BUF/EDM if they are able to move people for assets and use their picks wisely. They are going to be a year or two behind Buffalo in the rebuild but I would not count them out of a fast turn around.
OttawaSenators,36nni9,peskysens,3,Wed May 20 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"He's not the best coach in the league, but he is in the top 3 (Quenneville and Sutter are the two best and have done more than Babcock).    But we'll see, won't we?  What has Shanahan done?  So far he has hired a coach (before choosing his GM), and fired a bunch of people who deserved to be fired.  It's not bias, all I'm saying is that hiring Babcock as a coach doesn't make the lemons on the roster any better.  The team has thrown money at high-profile, highly successful coaches before and it has never worked because they have never built through the draft."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,chumpawumpa69,4,Wed May 20 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"Shanty eliminated the rot in the back room. And has promised to rebuild the team. As for hiring a coach before a GM. I don't think any GM is going to mind. And arguably Babcock is going to bring in a whole new world of options GM wise.  Yes Toronto has a couple bad contracts. So does every team.   We will see what happens, this summer should be crazy."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,peskysens,11,Wed May 20 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"Hey, if he wins the Stanley Cup with the Leafs, his legacy as quite possibly the greatest coach of all time will be cemented.   IF."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,antonio106,7,Wed May 20 18:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a little bit excited that the Lafs might become a contender.

OttawaSenators,36nni9,stompinstevo,2,Wed May 20 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, Leafs suck and I don't want to cheer for them.  BUT - I think they do have some interesting pieces and having them be better is only good for Ottawa.  Pushes the Sens to be that much better."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,broomlad,3,Wed May 20 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"Well said! Maybe that way we won't underestimate them and get our arses handed to us while shooting for a playoff spot (yes, I'm still salty that we lost to them of all teams.. Lucky it didn't hurt us as much as it could have..)"
OttawaSenators,36nni9,huntergreenhoodie,5,Wed May 20 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"Still has rebuilding to do and if he doesn't take the team to the playoffs, fans will just call for him to be sacked."

OttawaSenators,36nni9,PaddleDown,2,Thu May 21 12:23:00 2015 UTC,"Unless Babcock joins the roster it won't matter too much. The Leafs have some good pieces but can't seem to play as a team and are missing defensively and in the net. The best he can do now is kick them in the ass and make them try, and try to get whoever's around next year to gel better. A lot of the problem this team has had looks like it's coming from the players playing as individuals, without heart, without any real drive or motivation. As much as I dislike the Leafs, I'm genuinely interested to see where Babcock takes them in the next few seasons (and with a $50mil contract, I'd happily coach one of the worst teams in the league for a few years)."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,lucastimmons,1 point,Wed May 20 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"Why does this matter? The guy is a skill, puck possession, no penalties coach. Exactly what part of that sounds like the leafs? It shouldn't be Daaaaang. It should be LOL."

OttawaSenators,36nni9,Funkativity,0,Wed May 20 19:16:12 2015 UTC,"I think that the specific way that the deal went down is a really good sign of how badly this will work out for everyone involved.  Babcock won't make the Leafs better, Leafs will make Babcock worse."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,peskysens,1 point,Thu May 21 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"Point. But more than the leafs themselves making him worse, its more likely the media is going to tear him to shreds if he screws up even a little bit IMO.."
OttawaSenators,36nni9,Funkativity,1 point,Thu May 21 03:34:45 2015 UTC,The way it went down? A guy took the best offer? I'm pretty sure this is fairly common when taking a new job.
OttawaSenators,36nni9,peskysens,0,Thu May 21 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"Babcock turned them down.  They made overtures to Guy Boucher, had a few meetings, it went well enough that they flew him and his family in from Switzerland.   while they were in the final meeting,  one which by all account was to finish with him having signed, Babcock called in so one of the execs walked out of the Boucher meeting to take the call, Babcock asked for another offer... then the exec walks back in to interrupt the Boucher meeting and tell him 'never mind, you can leave now'.  it's such a great example of how the Leafs organization comports itself and, as I said, goes a long way to show how little the coaching change will have an impact on the off-ice issues that plague the team and lead to them choking year after year after year."
OttawaSenators,36kcjr,ActionAxson,16,Wed May 20 00:47:49 2015 UTC,Wow! I'm really pleased to read this. From that last update it seemed like he'd given up. Amazed it all came together so quickly.  But there go my chances for seasons tickets for life :(
OttawaSenators,36kcjr,PaddleDown,13,Wed May 20 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"Ethically I hope there's no reward or then I do have concern about public pleas for transfers from celebrities and wealthier individuals, but I wouldn't be surprised if something is done in return... that said, there may be real legal implications if it involves any sort of monetary value. The donor is anonymous, though, and I'm not sure what the confidentiality rules are regarding donor-recipient relationships (e.g. If it's possible to find your donor). I could look it up, but alas I'm tired.  (That said, it was a wonderful gift to give and I'm fully supportive of his public plea - a life is a life, and everyone deserves a chance to pull on the strings they have available to them for their own sake and the sake of those dearest to them. I hope all goes well in his recovery, and am very glad to hear of the successful surgery!)"
OttawaSenators,36kcjr,dez04,9,Wed May 20 02:07:11 2015 UTC,It has to be anonymously. There will be no compensation.
OttawaSenators,36kcjr,Omega613,5,Wed May 20 02:09:21 2015 UTC,"I think the best ""compensation"" (if it can really be called that) for Melnyk to offer once he's feeling better is doing his part to encourage organ donation and helping (mostly in terms of awareness) various related charities/organizations through the Sens/alternate avenues.  But ultimately that's for Euge to decide and organize as he sees fit. For now, he and those who know him (even indirectly, like us fans) should just be happy with the good news :)."
OttawaSenators,36kcjr,Chili_Palmer,2,Wed May 20 02:57:56 2015 UTC,"That, and since it was almost surely a sens fan, return to cap team status!  Might serve as a harsh reminder to Euge that you can't take it with you."

OttawaSenators,36kcjr,MichelangeBro,3,Wed May 20 03:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's like if you or I needed a new liver, we could go on the list to wait for a deceased donor, or we could ask our friends and family to get tested and see if any of them are a suitable match.

The material's right, the stitching is well done, the tags are in order and it appears to have the NHL hologram.  The reason why it was so cheap on Amazon was it's a different sweater than what they wear now. The tag says ""as seen in NHL 08"" which was released in 2007, the year this sweater was introduced. Back in the 07-08 season the material they used was supposed to be designed to help with moisture-repelling, but it ended up making all the moisture go to the players gloves. So halfway through the season going into 2008 all the sweaters in the league were redone with some different materials."
OttawaSenators,36k5pd,TorinK92,3,Wed May 20 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"Correct, this would be the Edge 1.0, versus the Edge 2.0 of what the players are wearing now. Best way to describe the 1.0 is the material is a lot stretchier and smoother feel. You'll also notice the back of the jersey has the RBK logo versus the words ""REEBOK"" which the 2.0 have now."
OttawaSenators,36k5pd,sensforlife11,1 point,Wed May 20 00:25:25 2015 UTC,"The switch from the RBK logo to the wordmark didn't correlate to the switch from Edge 1.0 to 2.0 though. That happened before the start of the 11-12 season, over three years after."
OttawaSenators,36k5pd,TorinK92,2,Wed May 20 00:27:55 2015 UTC,Same with the replicas. Bugs me (prob not most people though) when people have newer players stitched on jerseys with the RBK logo on the back.

I received the jersey and as far as I can tell, it's pretty good. If anyone has a definitely real Authentic white jersey, I'd love to compare tags etc and see if it's the real deal.

OttawaSenators,36jh29,Crispy613,5,Tue May 19 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"I don't mind him as a 4th line centre. Pageau has seemingly passed him on the depth chart, and legwand might be ahead right now, but Smith is basically a younger, cheaper, more physical legwand, which is fine for the 4th. Derek Grant might supplant him, but I doubt he'd make that big a difference."
OttawaSenators,36jh29,Iphikratous3,3,Tue May 19 23:42:08 2015 UTC,"Smith or Grant would make a decent-to-good 4C, at least in the short term - although neither have played long enough/consistently enough in the NHL (recently) for me to know which would be the better option. And on a related note, Grant is a Group VI UFA this summer, so his place in the organization is a bit up in the air for now.  But Legwand is signed one more season with an NTC and a not-so-low salary. Whether we can trade him (or whether he wants to be traded) is a big question which may determine Smith's future with us. In reality, Legwand is a tiny bit better than Smith statistically, but the price difference ($3M cap hit vs. $1.9M) seemingly doesn't make it worthwhile in my opinion.   I think - regardless of what happens with Grant - Smith or Legwand are getting traded, and the status/desire of the latter determines the future of the former. What Smith is worth? I have no clue. He was drafted with a 3rd rounder, is prime aged, perfectly serviceable 4th liner, protoypical ""tough playoff character guy"" (desirable to many GMs), and on a decent contract. If we didn't recoup at least the pick we used on him, I will be angry. But given the odds of a 3rd rounder actually making it to the NHL and the time/money spent to develop him I would hope we would stand to get a (late) 2nd rounder or equivalent from a team well stocked with picks/prospects, if not include him part of a package deal."
OttawaSenators,36jh29,Omega613,2,Wed May 20 00:00:16 2015 UTC,"Legwand (like it or hate it) also contributes on the power play, which is not something Smith should ever be involved in, Paul...  edit:  I promise I know how to spell Legwand"
OttawaSenators,36jh29,MarkMech,1 point,Wed May 20 15:21:46 2015 UTC,"For sure, but we have other forwards who can do that role too. Pageau, for example, or even Lazar might be an experiment, and when everyone was healthy we sometimes had (or could have had):   [MacA-Turris-Stone]+[Wiercioch-Karlsson]  [Milo/Hoff-Zbad-Ryan]+[Ceci/Hoff-Karlsson]   Where Hoff assumed one of those two positions, and the remainder was filled with Milo/Ceci respectively. Add in several other players, and making 2 PP units isn't tough (on paper). I was one of the few who was ok with Legwand on the PP, he was generally pretty good (and under-appreciated) on special teams in general. And like I said, Legwand is a little better than Smith, and can more easily elevate his can (PP, or further up the lineup in injury). But if we can save $1M here and there, it suddenly becomes a lot easier to afford all our new extensions and RFAs (plus could be the difference in re-signing Condra or not)."
OttawaSenators,36jh29,Omega613,3,Wed May 20 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"I think Ottawa needs to move out of the use of grinders and more into the area of power forwards and two-way forwards. Smith, being a grinder, should be traded to a team that lacks physicality in return for either a pick or a decent player that we can use to replace him.  That being said, Smith is definitely worth something to Montreal, Dallas or Calgary where they need their physicality area beefed up heavily."
OttawaSenators,36jh29,benches48,3,Wed May 20 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"Something to remember is he played with a wrist injury during our last push and post season.   Smith is the perfect 3/4 line centre. Big, rough, good faceoffs and reliable defensively.   Who would we replace him with? Pageau is a centre but why take him off the wing. He worked well with lazar and or smith in the middle.   His contract is great, and I doubt he is going to look for much more when it comes to re-sign."
OttawaSenators,36jh29,peskysens,2,Tue May 19 23:28:39 2015 UTC,Pageau played center on that #3 line the whole streak.   He is basically in a battle with Legwand for the 4LC spot.
OttawaSenators,36jh29,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Wed May 20 01:58:04 2015 UTC,Legwand has to go. He brings nothing that Smith doesn't. And costs way more.
OttawaSenators,36jh29,peskysens,1 point,Wed May 20 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, many people are judging him based on this season, but I'm sure his injury played into his lack of scoring."
OttawaSenators,36jh29,Chiefboss22,1 point,Wed May 20 17:55:42 2015 UTC,Scoring isn't even the big thing with him. He wasn't able to be as physical because of the wrist. He wasn't able to hold/scrum/hit/push do the general physical game as well with it. It's surprising how much it effects what you do.
OttawaSenators,36jh29,peskysens,1 point,Wed May 20 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think he's become a replacement level player. Sure wish we could've pursued a trade with Chicago a couple of years back for Hjalmarsson. Could've killed two birds with one stone (losing Smith, Hjal for Gryba.)"
OttawaSenators,36jh29,xBarDown,1 point,Tue May 19 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"He doesn't seem able to play better than the other centre options the Sens have. I have no idea how other GMs might value him, but I assume they'd give up something to get him. I think he's more tradeable than Legwand."
OttawaSenators,36en20,PaddleDown,10,Mon May 18 20:08:05 2015 UTC,Eugene Melnyk is going out singing the praises of medical advances and promoting the importance of being an organ donor.   We all die.

Eugene Melnyk is using his final moments on this earth to and his social influence to promote something that can help others long after he has passed away.   Way to go out like a champ Eugene.

OttawaSenators,36a8j9,Lanhdanan,2,Sun May 17 22:57:30 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of talk about this earlier in the season, and of course last season too. Was making the playoffs two years ago a curse? Did it convince Melnyk that he could get away with being close to the salary floor?  I'm optimistic due to the young up-and-coming players. Goaltending is not an issue. However this off season is critical. All it takes is a few offer sheets to really put the Sens' balls in a vise. Can Ottawa sign all the guys they need/want? Will Melnyk pony up some cash? Will Melnyk even be alive? (Liver transplant surgery isn't that bad, but you never know)  But really I'm worried that Melnyk will continue his ""cost per point"" campaign. I'm not saying Ottawa needs to spend to the cap, but we always seem to be talking about ""can Ottawa keep these guys around"".

You want to keep him around as like, a gesture of good faith, rather than trading him and getting some value for him while you still can and opening up a roster spot for younger, more talented players who can actually help us win?  The reality of hard-cap pro sports is that it's very, very rare for players to spend their entire careers with one team.  If you make the mistake of signing guys to ""preserve their legacy"" you end up with guys like Phillips--a player that's too old to contribute to the team but is taking up a roster spot/salary that could be going to someone better.  You have to think Team > Feelings."

The issue is, if we don't use Puempel, and his contract runs him to RFA status, someone needing a goal scorer may offer sheet him. He's a former first rounder, who has scored goals consistently throughout all leagues.   I think he can be a Micheal Ryder type of player for a team who takes a chance on him, just not sure it will be us who gives him the chance with our forward depth."

It will be on Sunday August 16th from 1:00-5:30 at MacLaren's on Elgin. Entry fee is $30 and covers food, pool table rentals, raffle ticket(s), as well as a donation to the Sens Foundation. The event will also feature a trivia contest and an NHL video game tournament.  Here's a recap of last year's event where we raised $1000 for the Sens Foundation: http://www.bonksmullet.com/2014/08/s...00-raised.html   This year we have a special guest in Bruce Firestone, the founder of the Ottawa Senators! He'll be making a presentation called Don’t Back Down, the real story of the Founding of the NHL’s Ottawa Senators. It's based on a book of the same name to be released in December 2015. As a bonus, the first 200 people to buy tickets will get a free e-copy of this book!  In addition, up for silent auction will be an exclusive breakfast with Bruce Firestone. Details to come!  We already have a large number of raffle prizes including a full set of this year's bobbleheads and a pair of glass seats to a Sens-Leafs game in 2015-2016 (donated by Faces Ottawa). I am looking for additional sponsors (individuals or companies) to donate prizes for our raffle, so if you know anyone be sure to let me know!  Full Details on the event can be found here. Updates are going to be continuously published here up until the event: http://senssummerfanfest.weebly.com/  You can purchases your tickets here. We are offering an early bird special, the earlier you buy, the more raffle tickets you'll get (you can purchase more at the event itself): http://senssummerfanfest.eventzilla.net/  Hope to see some of you out there.

OttawaSenators,35z2mc,chumpawumpa69,18,Thu May 14 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"What a difference that miracle run made.  Before their run everyone in town was calling for this guy's head.  Sens make it to the playoffs, put in a bid for a new downtown rink, have a bunch of young guys step up.  All of a sudden he's a genius for not spending.  I'll admit I was on the ""I hate Melnyk"" bandwagon too I might add.  This is why I don't run a hockey team.  Well, one of the many reasons."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,MarkMech,7,Thu May 14 20:10:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say he's a genius or a fool either way.  I will say Eugene seems like the gambling type.  And I think you need to be to be a sports team owner.
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,PRND1234,27,Thu May 14 22:23:51 2015 UTC,wow. that is crazy. I wish all the best for him and his family. Hopefully he can find a donor.

OttawaSenators,35z2mc,kenata88,16,Thu May 14 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"My first thought was ""well it's not like they're going to ask the fanbase for liver transplants""  Then I clicked the link, and that's pretty much exactly what they're doing.  Crazy stuff.. All the best to Mr Melnyk."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,Boonedoggle,11,Thu May 14 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"Your liver is comprised of two lobes. If you donate one lobe, the other lobe will grow bigger to compensate. There are certainly risks to donation, but for the most part the donor will return to 100% after a week or two in the hospital and then 2-3 months of rest and recovery at home."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,JackTheLab,14,Thu May 14 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"I know this sounds awful and selfish, and Melnyk deserves all the well-wishing we can offer - but given the subreddit we're all on...  If Eugene Melnyk (or any individual NHL owner for that matter) passes away somewhat suddenly (not long enough to enact any specific recent contingency plans), what happens to ownership of the Sens team/franchise? Is it an asset that he can ""willed"" to someone? Does the NHL assume control? Is it an asset which would be auctioned off? Is there precedence?"
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,Omega613,6,Thu May 14 21:44:32 2015 UTC,"I highly imagine that the team would be written into his will in some capacity.   God forbid, if he were to pass, the teams ownership would likely undergo some form of probate; during which time the executor of his estate (likely his lawyer), has the power to assign control over to someone (likely the NHL) until the estate is finalized, at which point whoever the owner in his will is would assume control."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,ThunderSteaks,2,Thu May 14 22:45:25 2015 UTC,Woah... This has way more implications than I thought.
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,AreYouStillThEere,3,Fri May 15 06:21:18 2015 UTC,I've been wondering the same thing.. I imagine it's like any other asset that someone will inherit?
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,Boonedoggle,3,Thu May 14 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"You would think so on the surface, but don't forget how much input the NHL has into team ownership through new franchise/sale/relocation/etc.. It's the sort of thing where if the owner left the franchise to [insert relative here], would the NHL have a say either at the time the will was written or when the transfer would take place? I just envision it potentially being a whole lot more complicated, but I'm really unsure."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,Omega613,3,Thu May 14 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"Well, technically speaking, it would be the estate of the owner that would own the team until it was distributed to beneficiaries. And the deceased's estate trustees would manage the affairs in the meantime.   With assets that massive, it's unlikely the trustee would distribute the estate without a clearance certificate from CRA, lest they attract personal liability.   So if (God forbid) EM died, it's not like someone would wake up the next morning and instantly have the keys to the CTC handed to them. It would be a long and drawn out process, and his beneficiaries--depending on who and how many--could ostensibly have get league approval as owners, or otherwise take their sweet time to find a new owner.   I don't know what the turn around was when the Sabres owner bought the Bills from Ralph Wilson's estate, but I'm guessing it was at least a few months, right?   Source: I'm going to become a lawyer in like a month, and I'm studying to be a trusts and estates planner."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,antonio106,1 point,Fri May 15 04:29:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks so much for detailed and presumably well sourced reply - talk about an applicable background! Hah. It all sounds very plausible when you put it that way.  Now that all said, the Sens technically have a pretty big debt rolling (unsurprising, and I assume not uncommon). Is it safe to assume to whoever would assume control, if it's via the owner's will (forgive me if that's not quite the correct term), who also be in charge of that debt too? If so, then there's definitely worry that the new owner would be unable to handle the financial implications of the franchise (aside from the option of selling it, of course)."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,Omega613,2,Fri May 15 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on the terms of the will. So it's bald speculation otherwise.   As a practical matter though, I suspect his kids may not want to be saddled with an enormous FT job of running a team, so it wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to sell it and run, especially if we're talking about minors."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,antonio106,2,Fri May 15 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"Too soon!  Seriously though, it can't be helped."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,InTURRISting,2,Thu May 14 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"It would be willed to somebody.  It's not like in the US, where there are estate taxes either.  So it won't be automatic that the person has to sell the team to pay the taxes on it."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,dejour,3,Thu May 14 23:55:19 2015 UTC,"No, in Canada there's a deemed disposition of assets on death. You're deemed to have sold all your stuff the day before you died. So you're right that estates are not usually taxed in the hand of the beneficiary, but they are taxed.   And considering that EM bought the team from a fire sale, that's probably a HUGE capital gain to pay."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,antonio106,3,Fri May 15 04:33:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for pointing that out.  Melnyk might have a lot of capital losses to net against that though.  (He has racked up a bunch of losses with his other businesses)

OttawaSenators,35z2mc,Austin13,5,Fri May 15 01:05:26 2015 UTC,"I know I'm selfish for not even considering to offer my liver for a cause like this. If he were family, I wouldn't think twice. I truly hope his story has a happy ending though. Sens and their management always seem to get robbed of them."
OttawaSenators,35z2mc,lead2gold,2,Thu May 14 21:39:17 2015 UTC,I would like to draw attention to the disgusting individual posting on the sens Instagram page. @hillierk77... What a horrible thing to say about someone. On top of that he posts it below his daughters post. Can everyone help to get this removed?

In a Stanley Cup challenge game in 1904, the Ottawas injured seven of the nine Winnipeg players, and the Winnipeg Free Press called it the ""bloodiest game in Ottawa.""[35] The next team to challenge the Ottawas, the Toronto Marlboroughs, were similar treated. According to the Toronto Globe:  The style of hockey seems to be the only one known and people consider it quite proper and legitimate for a team to endeavor to incapacitate their opponents rather than to excel them in skill and speed ... slashing, tripping, the severest kind of cross-checking and a systematic method of hammering Marlboroughs on hand and wrists are the most effective points in Ottawa's style.[35]  According to one player, the ""Marlboroughs got off very easily. When Winnipeg Rowing Club played here, most of their players were carried off on stretchers.""[35] This style of hockey would continue for years to come."
OttawaSenators,360e0o,OfficialGreenkid,2,Fri May 15 14:41:19 2015 UTC,"I found this on Wikipedia while looking into the original Sens. Graphic design in the 1890s was......different.   I learned a lot today. Like did you know the team was originally officially called Ottawa HC and the Silver Seven was just a nickname?   I don't know, maybe this is common knowledge. But it started with me wondering why the newspaper called them the ""Ottawas"" and now here I am."
OttawaSenators,360e0o,dejour,3,Fri May 15 01:10:33 2015 UTC,I always thought they were they the Silver Seven because there were seven players on the ice back then/the fact that they were winning/had won Stanley Cups (silver)
OttawaSenators,360e0o,amontpetit,3,Fri May 15 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yep.  EDIT: It was also because they were awarded silver nuggets for having won the Cup.   In a 1957 interview, Harry Westwick recalled that at the presentation ""One of the players said 'We ought to call ourselves the Silver Seven.' and the name caught on right there.""[32] (At the time, hockey teams iced seven men—a goaltender, three forwards, two defencemen and a rover).   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators_(original)#Silver_Seven_era_.281903.E2.80.931906.29"

OttawaSenators,35unih,DRUNK_ON_SYRUP,12,Wed May 13 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with the title, on the basis that prospects are super volatile - often being traded or simply not living up to their potential. Hockey fans also have a bad habit of expecting every promising player to become a star. Nick Paul or O'Connor, as examples, genuinely could be excellent some day, but neither have ever played an AHL game, let alone an NHL game. The sky might be the limit, but at the other end of that spectrum is also the ground. Even if they become a 3rd liner and backup goalie (respectively) in the NHL some day, that's really not a failure - on the contrary, it would be a success looking at prospect/draft pick success rates NHL-wide.  But suggested we don't need ""another 2 year project brewing in the minors"" feels very short-sighted, unless I'm misunderstanding. Yes, we have a lot of NHL-ready youth (in the NHL and on the cusp), but many of them may not end up panning out as we will only likely discover a couple years from now. If that's the case, we cut ties/reduce roles and we then need the option of more AHL prospects to try in their place or to use via trade then. Perhaps Pageau stumbles (:'() and regresses, or injuries take hold. Well, perhaps a guy like Dzingel might be a great replacement by the time he's spent a couple more seasons in the AHL. Prospects are superb to have and all stages of development, because you need a constantly developing pipeline of players - either to use or to trade now/in the future.  On top of that, did you see our AHL team this year? They weren't very good. Got some good offense, but no massive standouts save perhaps for Prince. Defensively they were lost with blueline quality really dropping off after Wideman/Claesson (neither of which are necessarily bluechip prospects themselves). That farm team needs some serious influx of talent, now and down the road. Further down the pipeline I think the only near-AHL ready players we can add next season might include Lindberg, Paul, Harpur, and possibly Wikstrand+Hogberg (SHL commitments to be determined). Considering we may be simultaneously subtracting some combination of Grant, Wideman, Puempel, and Prince through call-ups/trade/free-agency, Bingo and our prospect pipeline are looking sparse at many positions. And beyond just having potential NHLers to draw from, making that Bingo team better means it wins more and may make the AHL playoffs - both good things for developing/evaluating prospects that play there regardless of their individual timelines.  If anything, I would argue that we need prospects and picks more than we do NHL player additions (for the most part) in the short term. Aside from a shrewd and calculated addition or two, leave the NHL roster be temporarily to develop more and so we can get a better read on the young players and their eventual roles/ceilings."

OttawaSenators,35unih,Omega613,12,Thu May 14 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"This is an ignorant post.  You always need 2 year projects brewing in the minors, it's a cap league.  Not to say we won't make a deal or two, but your take here sounds like you think we should trade all of these picks."
OttawaSenators,35unih,Chili_Palmer,3,Wed May 13 18:55:56 2015 UTC,We have the youngest roster in the league. If we have the chance to package one of these picks in a deal for a proven NHL player we should pull the trigger.
OttawaSenators,35unih,Chili_Palmer,8,Wed May 13 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"No doubt, but to say the last thing we need is a 2 year prospect is a bit much - we still need to keep filling that pipeline to replenish the depth when guys like Michalek, MacArthur, Methot are getting ready to move on.  Besides, we all know the true last thing we need is Colin Greening."
OttawaSenators,35unih,ProblemOfficer,2,Wed May 13 20:08:04 2015 UTC,"We just resigned Meth for a decent term, Mac still has a few years left on his deal and 9MM has Nick Paul (hopefully) filling his shoes. Greening was also a late round pick, did we gamble and over commit? Yah, but it's by no means a cap crippler."

OttawaSenators,35unih,Omega613,2,Wed May 13 20:12:01 2015 UTC,"Sadly our management doesn't see it this way. If anything the Sens drool over picks/prospects. We love to build from within, and are seemingly ok with sitting as a middle pack team if we can keep doing that."
OttawaSenators,35unih,Iphikratous3,7,Wed May 13 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"Well, we traded away last years first rounder as part of the Bobby Ryan trade.. it sure sounds like Murray wants to make another trade along the same lines.   On top of that, building from within is totally necessary in a salary cap league. Look at what happens to teams like the Leafs, who spent years trying to build by trading picks and prospects and signing expensive FA's."
OttawaSenators,35unih,Omega613,1 point,Wed May 13 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with the building from within. I do understands it's importance. But we are on our 2nd(3rd?) cycle of players who are in their prime with a sprinkling of good rookies. If we simply stock the shelves some more instead of make moves to solidify what is missing we won't succeed.   I hope you are right, and we do another Ryan esq trade. Or snag a good free agent (Williams/Sekera) and help our team long term."
OttawaSenators,35unih,InTURRISting,4,Wed May 13 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"In fairness to our management, they tried to tank a little starting with 2010/11 (in the form of trading away a number of important players for picks). That worked for 2011, but then we ""screwed up"" by having some relative success for a couple of the subsequent years.   Although would a full scorched earth rebuild be financially viable for Ottawa? Doubtful, in my mind. Sure you could sell the fans on ""hope"" that a burgeoning stable of top prospects would help the team prosper ""some day soon"", but what if that rebuild takes too long? What if it fails completely and we have to restart?   For Toronto or Buffalo, their fansbases are so much older and more established that whenever success eventually returns (and often even if it doesn't) they will still fill the seats at their arena. Ottawa relies on at least modest success to do the same. 3-5(+) years of tanking would likely lead to bankruptcy of some sort and possible relocation if it went on too long. TOR/BUF could yet follow the rebuild pattern of Pittsburgh/Chicago, or of Edmonton (to date).  Fortunately, and if nothing else, one of the best things Murray has done in his tenure so far is install an excellent scouting department. The number of drafted/developed prospects on our team and nearly ready for the NHL is superb - one of the highest success rates in the NHL right now. Not every pick is a homerun, but many have become viable/good NHLers. And every once in a while, we do strike gold later than expected - like Karlsson, Stone, Hoffman, Pageau, etc., all of which have become (or have shown plenty of signs of) being players which exceed both their draft spots and the talent level of their respective positional averages around the league. Frugal or not, that's an excellent way of clawing our way up to being a much better team than simply ""average"", albeit a tough road with little guarantees of success.  I feel as though I've gone on a tangent now...  :P"
OttawaSenators,35unih,walahiguy,2,Wed May 13 18:08:59 2015 UTC,I've heard enough fans upset with the current rebuild to know that many would have jumped ship completely if we'd gone full buffalo. Ottawa is a fairweather city.
OttawaSenators,35sw3p,mattmassim0,8,Wed May 13 05:57:53 2015 UTC,So we almost traded Ben Bishop for Nick Paul
OttawaSenators,35sw3p,mike-kt,8,Wed May 13 11:33:14 2015 UTC,But instead we traded Spezza for him.

OttawaSenators,35pqwh,Memes4Gold,4,Tue May 12 14:37:56 2015 UTC,"Nick Paul will be at camp to start the year next year. If he doesn't make the team he will play in Bingo.   If you're 19 years old and younger, you have to play in the CHL if you aren't playing in the NHL. If you're 20 years old and over, you play in the AHL.   Lazar was in a similar position. Due to his age, if he didn't make the team at the start of the year, he would of had to return to the WHL."
OttawaSenators,35pqwh,ProblemOfficer,5,Tue May 12 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"We can't call him up because the season is over.   In all seriousness, Nick Paul is now 20 years old, so the CHL thing is not a concern.   Starting next season, he will try and make the big team, and if he can't (unlikely given our forward depth, and the fact we're making most of these guys pay their dues in the AHL) he will return to Bingo on a two-way deal, and we'll be able to call him up in case of injuries.   We may not see him for more than a few games next year, as Prince, Puempel, Robinson are all ahead of him on the winger depth chart waiting for their shot.   But the OHL contract is over now, the sens get to choose where he plays next season and they will almost surely choose Bingo."
OttawaSenators,35pqwh,Chili_Palmer,1 point,Tue May 12 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"Both other posters are mostly right, but to expand on this: the ""situation"" is an agreement between the CHL and the NHL that any CHL players under 20 who are not going to make the NHL squad cannot play in the AHL until either turning 20* or finishing 4 full CHL seasons, which ever comes first. It was designed to slow the rate at which talent is drained out of the CHL, since most NHL teams would put their young prospects on the AHL farm team.  *Not sure if its 20 before the season or the calendar year"
OttawaSenators,35oqzt,T-ohm-y,7,Tue May 12 07:27:47 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea. I like these draft profiles.  Anyway I've got a buddy who plays on the Screaming Eagles so I'll ask him about Svechnikov and see what he thinks.   I would rather Ottawa picked a defenseman first round but if the picks before us are heavily defenseman, we could snag a great winger who probably should have gone higher. Either a defenseman or left winger and I'll be happy."
OttawaSenators,35oqzt,Jthedude17,1 point,Tue May 12 10:28:22 2015 UTC,If you don't mind me asking who's your friend?  I wouldn't mind if we decided to draft a defenceman with our first but even if we don't there are plenty of guys available in the 2nd-3rd round that have pretty good upside. J. Roy or Kylington would be killer though.
OttawaSenators,35oqzt,Jthedude17,2,Tue May 12 15:24:45 2015 UTC,Probably shouldn't say haha. Sorry. And I agree. I'm very okay with taking a D man in the 1st or 2nd but if a quality defenseman is available at 18 we need to take him. A strong piece to strengthen our blueline is needed I think
OttawaSenators,35oqzt,Jthedude17,1 point,Tue May 12 22:43:41 2015 UTC,Edit: Was finally talking to my friend. He said he thought Svechnikov should go top 10. Didn't really say a lot besides that he's a hell of a player

OttawaSenators,35nh1a,zdelusion,7,Mon May 11 23:09:24 2015 UTC,"I'm trying not to get too excited about him, but I'm getting excited about him. Seems like he could be a decent player, hope to see him in the AHL next year."
OttawaSenators,35nh1a,shining_,3,Tue May 12 00:58:36 2015 UTC,"Really, really quick hands on that move. Just excellent puck movement, and while at speed too. Hope that's a skill which translates well as he develops.  Any confirmation yet if he'll be in Bingo next season? I've assumed so to this point, but that's not actually based on anything besides common developmental progression."
OttawaSenators,35nh1a,Omega613,3,Tue May 12 00:29:40 2015 UTC,"He'll be 20, and has already transitioned to the North American game rather successfully, so if he's not in Bingo next season (which I think he should be) he'll be in Evansville. If I'm getting my facts straight."
OttawaSenators,35nh1a,TorinK92,2,Tue May 12 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"Especially when you include the fact that Schneider and Robinson are the only two natural RWs we have in Bingo, it would certainly make a lot of sense to put our only other RW/C prospect in the system on that roster unless there's some contractual/regulatory reason why not to."
OttawaSenators,35nhp7,Omega613,4,Mon May 11 23:14:53 2015 UTC,"I just hope we can deal with the Boro/Gryba/Phillips/Cowen/Wideman/Wikstrand bottom 2 in a good way. (6 players potentially in our bottom 2, that's pretty insane)"
OttawaSenators,35nhp7,TorinK92,2,Tue May 12 00:05:52 2015 UTC,"That part really confused me about 6thSens' article. I'm not sure where in that situation we are deriving the assumption that he would start in Ottawa.  It's my expectation he would play in Bingo, especially to give him time acclimate to the North American game (ice size and playstyle primarily) and also since he's only 22 (and we're not desperate for depth blueliners right now). Wikstrand signed his 3 year ELC a year ago in May, as I recall. It may or may not slide one year, but regardless I assume he's (a) waiver exempt, and (b) contracted to a 2-way salary."
OttawaSenators,35nhp7,TorinK92,3,Tue May 12 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't been expecting him to play in Ottawa as well. It seems like he'd need a season to adjust to NA and we have a logjam of bottom pairing defensemen.  Although, if he could come over and become our John Klingberg, that'd be great as well."
OttawaSenators,35nhp7,PaddleDown,2,Tue May 12 00:36:04 2015 UTC,"Listened to all the interviews, but I'll comment specifically on O'Connor himself. Prior to now I hadn't really heard him interviewed and it was a pleasant surprise... sort of in the way some early Hammond interviews were. Very well spoken, very well rounded, and realizes there's bigger things in a life that will one day require him to have continued success outside of the sport itself. I think he's a great prospect to have in our organization, and his maturity and dedication to the process will go a long way toward him finding success - be it in the NHL or in a career outside of the league in the future."

OttawaSenators,35lpla,KrazyCooter,9,Mon May 11 16:26:03 2015 UTC,The fact we traded Bishop for Conacher still hurts me
OttawaSenators,35lpla,go_sens,6,Mon May 11 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"Same, although mostly because we could've/should've gotten more - at least in hindsight.   But that aside, what helps me is realizing just how much Bishop is getting paid in spite of have just 1 good NHL season. For the next two season's, he's getting $5.95M, which is nearly as much as we're paying Andy and Lehner combined. Add to that their need to pay for a backup. Sure, Bishop put up good numbers last season (.924%, 2.23GAA), but was pretty average this season (.916%, 2.32GAA) despite playing for an excellent team. His contract length makes his situation more manageable, but there's no reason yet to believe he won't follow Mike Smith's career progression (contract situation included).  On top of that, the 4th rounder we got back was used on Tobias Lindberg, who (a) has shown great drive/attitude by coming to North America per the Sens request, and (b) has been excellent for the Oshawa Generals. He's got size, skill, and is putting up solid OHL number despite still clearly adjusting to NA ice size/playstyle.   It doesn't magically make the trade in our favour by any means, but coupled with our continuing wealth of goalies it certainly makes it easier to handle I think."
OttawaSenators,35lpla,Omega613,3,Mon May 11 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"Bishop's already better than Mike Smith IMO, he has 77 wins over the past 2 years.  Price has only 1 more win than that.  When was the last time a Sens goalie had 37 or 40 wins in a season?"
OttawaSenators,35lpla,Omega613,3,Mon May 11 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"I would agree that Bishop is seemingly better than Mike Smith, but the parallel I'm trying to make is this:   Mike Smith was a large, middle-aged (career-wise) goalie who had shown some promise, but had trouble putting it together and locking down a starter position. In his first season after signing with Phoenix, he posted a 93.0% save percentage and 38 wins in 67 games and was big part of Phoenix winning the division title in 2011/12. At the time, the 'Yotes were pretty good and had a good defensive core. The summer of 2012, Phoenix felt comfortable offering Smith an advanced extension ($5.667M x 6 years) which would kick in after the 2012/13 season. That following season he posted much more ""average"" numbers, including a .910% and 15 wins in 34 games (shortened season, recall).  Since then, Mike Smith has posted a 91.5%/27 wins/62GP and 90.4%/14 wins/62GP. Sufficed to say, despite the 1 great year prior to his extension, he hasn't really lived up to the value of his contract, especially given the tumultuous financial situation of the franchise.   Aside from the 2nd paragraph there (which could still be in Bishop's future), the bulk of that story lines up with Bishop, aside from some finer/unimportant details. Now of course, this season might've been more of a ""down"" year for Bishop, and he'll rebound next year, we can only wait to see. And smartly on Yzerman's part, he didn't sign Bishop for long-term despite the large dollar value. But speaking solely of what's happened to date, Bishop's story and Smith's are quite similar:   Ben Bishop was a large, middle-aged (career-wise) goalie who had shown some promise, but had trouble putting it together getting NHL opportunities and locking down a starter position. In his first [full] season after signing with Phoenix being traded to Tampa, he posted a 93.0% 92.4% save percentage and 38 37 wins in 67 63 games and was big part of Phoenix Tampa winning the division title in 2011/12 2013/14. At the time, the 'Yotes Lightning were pretty good and had a good defensive core. The summer of 2012 2014, Phoenix Tampa felt comfortable offering Smith Bishop an advanced extension ($5.667M x 6 years)($5.95M x 2 years) which would kick in after the 2012/13 2014/15 season. That following season he posted much more ""average"" numbers, including a .910% and 15 wins in 34 games (shortened season, recall) 91.6% and 40 wins in 62 games, the win stat being largely attributable to playing behind the league's most potent offense."
OttawaSenators,35lpla,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Mon May 11 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"A second or third for Lehner? Isn't he by far more valuable to Ottawa as an athletic 24 year old with only 86 NHL games than the picks?    If that's what market value is for Lehner, and I think its a fair assessment, its either let Hammond walk or hopefully get a 2nd round pick. I'd rather see Hammond walk."

A snapshot of Anderson's value when he's just taken 2 months off from injury is a lot different than after his stellar play. Just look at how low the value of Lehner is currently.    Elliotte Friedman wrote this yesterday:     So now that O’Connor is going to Ottawa, who’s leaving? It’s not an easy question to answer, because some potential partners may prefer Craig Anderson while others might choose Robin Lehner, pending his recovery. It’s believed Buffalo would have interest in Anderson, but would the Senators send another goalie in the division (Ben Bishop)? If one of them can get the Senators a top-six forward, that’s the guy who goes."
OttawaSenators,35lpla,walahiguy,-2,Mon May 11 19:54:30 2015 UTC,a couple of good playoff games doesn't mean the team all of a sudden trusts him and his health going forward.
OttawaSenators,35lpla,JBVsev,1 point,Mon May 11 20:27:39 2015 UTC,Seems completely insane considering how well he played. Gonna go ahead and assume this is bs.
OttawaSenators,35lpla,walahiguy,-2,Mon May 11 19:38:11 2015 UTC,it's not. Straight from Friedman. Anderson has soured on a team before (Colorado). He played well but went 2-2.
OttawaSenators,35lpla,JBVsev,3,Mon May 11 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"""straight from my total misinterpretation from Friedman"" might be more accurate."

To my great disappointment Conacher shit the bed. I say we trade a goalie for a proven player this time around"
OttawaSenators,35mieg,Shack_TS,11,Mon May 11 18:50:02 2015 UTC,"if Kylington is code name for Konecny, yes"
OttawaSenators,35mieg,walahiguy,3,Mon May 11 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"As a supporter if his team here in Sweden, yes they shall get him if they can. The problem this year was that he played for two teams that where under a lot if pressure the entire season. Kylington has a lot of tallent of the kind that can't be thaugt. He plays with a very small safety margin, and that led to a lot of unnecessary goals last season. Once he gets his defense and risk taking sorted out he will be a really good defender in the NHL."
OttawaSenators,35mieg,SherlockInDisguise,2,Tue May 12 01:28:06 2015 UTC,Did you get to see him lots? Curious to get more thoughts on someone closer to the situation
OttawaSenators,35mieg,RenegadeHipster,3,Tue May 12 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"At the end of last year I would have said to take him, but at the moment I am not that sure anymore. I guess some of the questionable decisions made by him can be attributed to being immature/still growing up, but it do ring some warning bells.  There will be a lot more safer bets if he still is available at 18 though one can't deny that he has a heck of an upside."
OttawaSenators,35mieg,Omega613,1 point,Mon May 11 19:39:55 2015 UTC,I guess some of the questionable decisions made by him can be attributed to being immature/still growing up   What have you heard about him in this regard?
OttawaSenators,35mieg,RenegadeHipster,3,Mon May 11 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"What I was referring to was him starting out the season playing in Färjestad in SHL, then being angry with the minutes he got asked to be sent on a loan to AIK in Allsvenskan.  It didn't go that well there and at the transfer deadline he was sent back to Färjestad J20, and then later on with the main team in SHL."
OttawaSenators,35mieg,Omega613,1 point,Mon May 11 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"Oh interesting, hadn't heard any of that, thanks.   Definitely hard to judge without knowing all the details (like how each team treated him, and other factors), but on the surface it's definitely not in his favour.   I hope our Euro scouts know more and have spoken with relevant personnel. He still makes an intriguing option in the draft, especially if names like Konecny/Svechnikov/etc. are off the board early."
OttawaSenators,35mieg,SherlockInDisguise,1 point,Mon May 11 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he only played for the seniors the second time when they where resting their key players, and it was one or two times."
OttawaSenators,35mieg,Stoet,1 point,Tue May 12 01:24:35 2015 UTC,"He was 17 and wanted to play in his home town for a team that was struggling and not so far from friends and family. The playing time was probably just a bonus. I wouldn't read much into the claims of ""diva for playing minutes"" thing"
OttawaSenators,35mieg,immaperson,2,Wed May 13 07:50:38 2015 UTC,I'm torn between Konecny and Kylington. Konecny is a 67's boy and be offensive and defensive. Kylington dropped but look at what happened last time we took a Swedish defenceman in the first round earlier than he was supposed to go. Karlsson could be a good mentor for him.
OttawaSenators,35mieg,Omega613,1 point,Mon May 11 23:48:31 2015 UTC,"As your write-up points out, it's really hard getting a read on why Kylington fell so much in the rankings. Earlier this season, I wouldn't hesitate to draft him with the 18th overall pick if he somehow fell that far (not unheard of, recently Filip Forsberg fell to 11th after expected to go top 3/4).   But now I can't help but wonder what's potentially got the scouts so worried. Was it just his injury this year that has made it tougher to project/rate him highly? Is there a fitness/attitude issue? Was he overrated to begin the year? Frustrating to know so little about these international prospects.   Similarly, what have Carlsson/Larsson done to rise over Kylington in the ranking as fellow swedish dmen, not to mention centre Eriksson Ek whose risen from 22nd to 4th in international skaters. Keep in mind our very own Erik Karlsson rose from 63rd to 4th in international skaters from midterm to finals, and wasn't (at the time) considered a ""good"" pick at 15th overall in 2008. International scouting is weird."
OttawaSenators,35mieg,mike-kt,2,Mon May 11 19:34:42 2015 UTC,Hockey Prospectus has Kylington as a tier ii-iii prospect but they don't really do a great job at explaining why he's so far down the list.  Feels like a player the Sens should try for a homerun on.
OttawaSenators,35mieg,SherlockInDisguise,2,Mon May 11 20:40:12 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. Sometimes the odd picks turn out the best, especially with Europeans. If he was in the OHL he'd get much more exposure and we'd have a better ranking"

OttawaSenators,35fvhi,Jthedude17,1 point,Sun May 10 21:56:52 2015 UTC,He posted the same thing like 800 times in this thread. OP is alluding to this.
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,CookingInTheKitchen,5,Mon May 11 01:52:23 2015 UTC,"The thing that this article doesn't mention is that if Anderson is traded, we free up some much needed cap space (especially if there is no escalator) to sign our many young free agents."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,3thoughts,10,Sun May 10 14:56:55 2015 UTC,A tandem of Lehner--coming off a flat season and a concussion--and Hammond--with a heroic 25 game run that's not representative of his entire career--is terrifying.   No way in Hell would I trade Anderson.
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,antonio106,3,Sun May 10 19:35:38 2015 UTC,At the same time though this team is so young that keeping a player like Anderson for the sake of making the playoffs vs making the right trades now so in a couple or few years were making cup runs can definitely be worth it.
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,tripledjr,2,Sun May 10 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"Hasek and Tim Thomas were both 37 when they won their first Stanley Cup, were they not? Unless you think the Sens are in full rebuild mode, their window comes in the next 4-5 years, not in a decade. I don't see age as a huge impediment one way or another."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,antonio106,-2,Sun May 10 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Hasek is a freak of nature and Thomas was playing behind one of the best defensive teams ever assembled. Anderson/our team isn't comparable to Hasek/the 2011 Bruins.  I'd be scared of only having O'Connor, Hammond and Dreidger around in 2-3 years if Lehner is traded."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,3thoughts,4,Mon May 11 00:25:31 2015 UTC,"My favorite part of this article:  ""He’s 23 years old (same age as Robin Lehner as of now)""  As of now ... like this could change somewhere down the road, lol."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,halsed,3,Sun May 10 20:23:05 2015 UTC,Poorly written.  Lehner turns 24 in a couple months so maybe he meant to say that they're both technically 23 but Lehner is actually closer to a year older.
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,Nutzillaa,2,Sun May 10 22:02:32 2015 UTC,Yes
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,baldchow,3,Mon May 11 01:26:38 2015 UTC,... assuming he works out.  A hell of a lot of goalies show a hell of a lot of promise going into their NHL careers ..

OttawaSenators,35fvhi,PaddleDown,3,Sun May 10 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"It's such a crapshoot with goaltenders I'm not sure why people are making this big of a deal about it. Lehner has played alright and looks behind in development, but he's still so young compared to the majority of NHL netminders. I'd be surprised if the organization sold so low on Lehner, but it's also not as if his concussion - whether he can ride the bike right now or not - is of serious, career-ending concern. Goaltenders aren't a high risk concussion-wise, and I wouldn't be overly concerned about a recurrence. That said, they'd still be selling pretty damn low.  Whether or not O'Connor signed here, one of Anderson, Lehner, or Hammond was going to leave town this summer, since none of those three would be returning to the AHL. I would be shocked if Anderson were moved as we need the stability he can provide, and I wouldn't be shocked at all to see Hammond sign a short-term deal to serve his time as an NHL back-up for a couple of years, and then see Anderson being moved supposing Hammond shows stability and O'Connor makes progress. I'd rather keep Andy around and have a winning environment for this team to progress in than trade him for a late 1st-rounder."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,CatoDarpa,1 point,Mon May 11 13:11:34 2015 UTC,"If Lehner is still hurt, you probably wont see any of them leave town until at least the trade deadline. Which means we will have some time to see what Hammond can do"
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,InTURRISting,1 point,Mon May 11 15:53:49 2015 UTC,TBH I'm simply perplexed at this concussion he experienced.   I mean I've had 200lb guys fall on me in all sorts of ways...but wth.
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,PaddleDown,2,Mon May 11 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's not that perplexing... Lehner was moving forward quickly and has his head snapped back very suddenly and very violently, an impact that was somewhat hidden by his mask coming loose. It's reasonable that he's been out longer than MacArthur because his brain undoubtedly smashed into his skull with a hell of a lot more force. Once he's back, there's not as much serious long-term concern as there might be for a skater, but he might be a while getting back."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,InTURRISting,1 point,Mon May 11 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, when I watch that head snap back from the other angle I see what you mean.  I only ever saw it from one angle (listened on the radio that day).  From the angle I saw it looked like no one ever actually fell on his head, just that his mask got clipped,  so I was understandably mystified."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,Nutzillaa,1 point,Mon May 11 20:01:21 2015 UTC,Please don't sign Hammond.
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,JackLeiper,2,Sun May 10 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"I can see giving him a contract. If it means Lehner is gone, i'll be upset.   23-years-old, goaltenders peak much later and Lehner has played at the league average throughout his career. Had ups and downs. Still a solid backup, can only improve.   If return is good, I'll understand. But otherwise, Lehner moving would be very upsetting."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,PaddleDown,2,Mon May 11 00:00:43 2015 UTC,"Returns on goalies generally aren't as good as anyone thinks they'll be. I wouldn't be shocked if Lehner netted a 1st-round pick, but I also wouldn't be surprised if he were traded for less. Whether Lehner or O'Connor is better long-term is largely a coin flip, and as much as I like his passion, I don't think Lehner's glares toward defencemen and stick swinging fits do him any favours with the organization when it comes to not being the odd-man out."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,InTURRISting,1 point,Mon May 11 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"Wait, you mean chirping my defensemen makes me less popular? :P"
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,Nutzillaa,1 point,Mon May 11 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still think he's got a tonne of upside and although I appreciate what Hammond did for us this year, I really believe he'll fall off a cliff next season."
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,SRohoman,-19,Wed May 13 23:17:36 2015 UTC,Ya..because adding another tendy is gonna make it more flexible!   We've got 2 guys that are more than great already!!
OttawaSenators,35fvhi,benches48,2,Sun May 10 07:26:44 2015 UTC,Huh? That makes no sense
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,tenders11,24,Sat May 9 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't expect this,  I think our best bet would be to move Hammond, give O'Connor the starting job in Bingo and maintain the course we've been on.  Lehner has too much potential to just drop him for a goalie like Hammond, who has only played exceptionally for 20 so odd games. I'm pretty much just praying that Hammy is just a flash in the pan.  In any case, this is a good sign for the organization, and I'm very optimistic for our future.  I would just die inside if Lehner became successful on another team. Think of when Toronto traded Rask. Man.. what a happy mess we have on our hands."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Hoxtilicious,16,Sat May 9 18:51:11 2015 UTC,Like Bishop? That one still stings a little.
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Lanhdanan,5,Sat May 9 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact opposite. I'd be inconsolable if Hammond became successful somewhere else. On the other hand I think I'd actually be happy if Lehner figured out his game in another city, he hasn't really turned out that great here."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,mechanicalhand,4,Sat May 9 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"he hasn't really turned out that great here.   Man, he's 23 and has had, like... what one +30 game season maybe?  And all his time here has been with a... well, less than stellar defense.  Plus, I mean... he scares me.  Let's not anger him."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,ibanez-guy,3,Sun May 10 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"I don't want a goaltender that gets angry and emotional. I want one that stays calm cool and collected through thick and thin, and is constantly focused on the present, on stopping that puck, whether the score is 5-0 for or against.   In my mind, I would shop Lehner, maybe not right now, idk. It depends perhaps on what other teams think about Hammond. Thing is, he is still only a backup at best. I would take hammond as our backup while O'conner works it in AHL no problem."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Akoustyk,3,Sun May 10 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don't want a goaltender that gets angry and emotional. I want one that stays calm cool and collected through thick and thin, and is constantly focused on the present, on stopping that puck, whether the score is 5-0 for or against.   I just want one that stops the puck.  I'll admit the Carey Price method is pretty damn good, but I'll take Ron Hextall if it works.   In my mind, I would shop Lehner, maybe not right now, idk.   Well, I would always be shopping everyone on some level i suppse... but right now, I feel like we'd be selling pretty low on Lehner, where with Hammond the opposite would be the case."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,ibanez-guy,1 point,Sun May 10 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"A goaltender that gets emotional though can be rattled up by the other team and can be put off their game. During regular season. Its not such a big deal. During the playoffs, the opposing coach will know that, and will sick a pest on him."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Akoustyk,1 point,Sun May 10 16:04:58 2015 UTC,"I think anger and confidence are on a sort of relatable spectrum, with more games, better defence and more experience I feel that any player with anger/passion issues will settle in and channel that emotion into their play when they have confidence in their team and themselves.  Lehner has the tools to become a standout starting goaltender. You don't come across this sort of player very often. He is also in a perfect environment with us right now. I vote hold on to him."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,TotoroZoo,1 point,Sun May 10 19:02:17 2015 UTC,"Emotions don't work that way though. If a player is emotional, then it affects them in an unpredictable way. Its not logical, they can't design it or ""channel"" it, whatever that means.   It gets the better of people and they take poor penalties or just get thrown off their game, because they are focused on whatever their emotions are making them feel, rather than just stopping the puck.   I mean, sure, sometimes anger can help accomplish stuff. But a cool calculating mind focused on a task is always much stronger, other things being equal.   I hear people talk a lot of good things about Lehner, I've never seen anything particularly special at all."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Akoustyk,1 point,Sun May 10 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"I have seen many games where Lehner has made save after save, some of them due to his athleticism more than anything. I see him being a solid goalie in the NHL for a long time when he grabs the reins.   You have to admit that passion/emotion/anger is part of being a young guy for almost anybody. I think that most goalie's take longer due to the mental side of the game taking longer to develop. I'm happy to see him can't stand to lose. With a good coach and management those issues can be ironed out. I would hold on to hope for Lehner, he's a good young goalie. Star goalie prospects are hard to find. He has that potential."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,TotoroZoo,2,Sun May 10 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"The emotional aspect sticks with players for life. It's genetic. Every goalie that makes the NHL makes athletic saves. I watched Hammond make save after save also. I've watched a lot of goaltenders make a lot of nice saves.    But players with the emotional aspect, don't lose that. Some of them are pretty good despite that. But it is still a weakness that can be preyed on in playoffs.  Again, I've heard people say he has great potential, but to me, that's all emperor's new clothes talk. I've not seen anything special from him. I saw him suck it up this year, with a chance at really making a push for the number 1 even, and then when he got replaced, that's just what I watched his replacement do.   Ya, he's younger. But whatever, we have a young guy right now we just signed, whose head is in a much better place. I'd rather sell lehner to someone that thinks like you do, while people still do.  Hammond would be a suitable backup until O'Conner is ready. He also sells tickets. If Anderson can learn not to make needlessly risky plays, we'll be in great hands right up until that day.    Lehner gets angry, and all O'Conner wants to do is play where he has the best chance at learning the most. I'll take O'Conner over lehner based on that alone. Easily.   Because if I know your goaltender gets angry, then I'm sending a pest in your face every chance I get, come playoff time.   But whatever. You like lehner, that's fine, I won't try and change your mind. I just don't find he's anything special. All I ever hear is about potential about what he could be. I don't see what those people see. He just doesn't impress me.   Obviously he is good enough to be a backup in the best league in the world, so he doesn't suck, but you see something special and rare, and I don't see that. I hear that from people, which I suspect are just repeating what they heard other people say."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Akoustyk,1 point,Sun May 10 21:42:02 2015 UTC,How do the Sens move Hammond when he's a UFA?
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,mike-kt,4,Sat May 9 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"That's why I used the word ""move"" and not ""trade"" or anything else like that.   I don't know what they would do with him to be honest. I don't want him to leave and get nothing back, but unless we sign him, that's what'll happen. Hypothetically, if we all agreed he was the odd one out, signing him wouldn't make sense.  Do teams ever sign players to contracts only to get value back when they trade them shortly thereafter? I have no clue man.  edit: Jarret says yes they do"
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Hoxtilicious,0,Sat May 9 23:44:27 2015 UTC,They are working on a deal so they could resign him then trade him.
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Jarretl9,3,Sat May 9 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"It's bush league moves like this that ended up costing us Chara. No thanks.   You do a sign-and-trade on a guy who isn't expecting it in the NHL, and you are essentially putting yourself in every agent's black list when it comes to UFA, not to mention re-signing your own guys."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,ultrafil,1 point,Sun May 10 04:57:44 2015 UTC,"It was bush when we did it to Hoss because he thought he was staying. I'm pretty sure GMBM would sign him knowing that he would have 3 NHL ready tendys and only room for 2 spots here. One would move but in that case at least all three have contracts. It would be Hammond singing with the knowledge that he might be moved. At that point he would be moving regardless and really just wants to be on a team that needs him. either way, Hammond's agent will explain that to him and no one will be surprised when a player is moved."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,mackinder,4,Sun May 10 12:24:37 2015 UTC,That's dirty. They don't need to do stuff like that

OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Jarretl9,2,Tue May 12 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make much sense. He is UFA, anyone can give him whatever they want. If Ottawa wanted to give him x, to trade him for y, because y is valuable to the sens, then the team trading y, would have paid x+y for hammond, when they could have just gone directly to hammond's agent, and said ""i'll pay x+1"""
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Akoustyk,1 point,Sun May 10 13:11:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. Hammond is technically very weak. Had one of best NHL teams in front of him. I would keep lehner.
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,goalieca,1 point,Sat May 9 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree, though I know we're all incredibly thankful for his contributions."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Its_apparent,1 point,Sun May 10 01:19:14 2015 UTC,I disagree with this. Yes the team played amazing in front of Hammond but those stats can't a be the team. It's not like he was only having 20 shots a game.  I think Sens should trade Lehner and a prospect for Yakupov/Eberle. Ballsy. But they need a goalie for the long haul and they want to move a bit of their core. And Chirelli (butchered the spelling but too lazy to look it up) has no problem making big trades and has dealt with Murray before.  Then have Andy start for 3-4 more years with Hammond being backup. Even if he doesn't play to this seasons potential he has the skills to be a solid back up. Let O'Connor take the lead in Bingo until Andy is done and then bring him up to start in Ottawa.
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,GilmerInSpace,5,Sun May 10 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"That isn't enough for Eberle, so it would have to be Yakupov and even then I don't know. The Oilers want to see what he can do in a full season playing with a capable centre.  Lehner, who unfortunately isn't worth much at the moment, would return something more like Marco Roy and 3rd, maybe 2nd round pick."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,gpaine93,1 point,Sun May 10 03:53:52 2015 UTC,"That isn't enough for Eberle, so it would have to be Yakupov and even then I don't know.   I'd do Lehner and a prospect for Yakupov faster than Mark Stone compiles takeaway stats.   Yakupov is going to be the real deal, and the sooner he GTFO's Edmonton, the better for him."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,ultrafil,1 point,Sun May 10 11:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm an Oilers fan on top of Ottawa, so I really want to see him play with McJesus. But I wouldn't complain that trade happened, though the prospect would have to be somthing like Harpur and a lower pick, or a d-man taken in the first two rounds this year. Edmonton needs D badly."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,gpaine93,1 point,Sun May 10 11:26:37 2015 UTC,I think if we started Lehner a few games and did does well he can make some better trade bait. And there are a couple teams that could use him this year. We also have way too many prospects wasting away in the AHL. Sending a couple of them for a top 6 forward would be amazing

OttawaSenators,35eo8e,AskMeIfImAHuman,14,Sat May 9 16:49:11 2015 UTC,For Sale: One Robin Lehner. (Slightly used)
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,ilikerandomstuff,10,Sat May 9 16:53:11 2015 UTC,Slightly damaged*
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Lanhdanan,8,Sat May 9 16:54:29 2015 UTC,Slightly loved.
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Stoet,3,Sat May 9 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we signed him, a good player signed is always good and he could become spectacular. I love it. We're lucky that we're in a position of choices on the goalie side.   But I'm a little bit sad that Lehner never got to bloom here. I think he's the most likely and best choice to leave."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Lanhdanan,2,Sat May 9 19:00:53 2015 UTC,Man! What a summer this could be for the Sens! So much anticipation! MUST GET A TIME MACHINE AND GET TO OCTOBER!!
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,jermotank,3,Sat May 9 21:55:01 2015 UTC,So which goalie gets traded?
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Omega613,6,Sat May 9 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"Well he's confirmed to be going to the AHL (wants to ""develop properly""), so for now he has no significant bearing on our NHL roster. If Hammond re-signs however...  Edit: It might affect our AHL goalies though. Specifically, Driedger is expected to play there and Hogberg was said at various points this year to jumping the pond next season. Likely means one of those two (Hogberg?) starts in the ECHL, for better or worse."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,mike-kt,1 point,Sat May 9 16:49:42 2015 UTC,Gives Hogberg the incentive to stay in Sweden this fall and play another year there. Maybe Dridger goes back to the ECHL so he can play full time.   I wonder how many back-up games O'Connor will get in the NHL next year; I wonder if the Sens promised him games so he could earn some serious cash.
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,mike-kt,2,Sat May 9 17:05:30 2015 UTC,Wow that's awesome!

OttawaSenators,35eo8e,mike-kt,4,Sat May 9 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"Schnider got the Canucks a 9th overall, it would be tough for the Sens to get better than that."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,BootsToYourDome,4,Sat May 9 17:13:46 2015 UTC,Maybe a low first?
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,AutoMasta,3,Sat May 9 17:19:10 2015 UTC,"If all we get back for a top 5 goalie in the league is a low 1st, I would not want to trade him."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,SeveredSurvival,1 point,Sun May 10 00:50:23 2015 UTC,"I see people being optimistic yet sketpical of this move. Frankly, I'm not too worried, they can move pieces to improve the team. I really don't get the outrage and concerns some people are having. Either way, this Sens team will be fine. We always seem to do decently well in the goalie department despite some players not panning out. (Gerber, Auld, etc)  I'm content with whoever we keep and sure Lehner has the potential but as far as I'm concerned that's all he has at the current moment. Nothing proven yet besides his one or two good seasons of decent stats backed by this year's pretty disappointing performances. Plus this gives the Sens lots of leeway in management."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,iPoop20,0,Sat May 9 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling Anderson is the guy we'll move. I really hope it's Lehner instead, but I don't see us getting much for him right now. Ideally, we'd hang on to everyone and wait, but obviously that's not possible. So I think that means Anderson is on his way out, which kinda sucks.   However, maybe there's a team out there that is willing to take a gamble on Lehner."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Its_apparent,2,Sat May 9 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"If they move Lehner or Hammond, I'd be sad, but I'd understand.  If they move Anderson, I'll be legitimately angry.  Guy is the most consistent thing we have, I think.  When he came back in against Montreal, I was much more at ease, and for good reason."
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,veryimprobable,1 point,Sun May 10 01:21:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, I feel like edmonton or buffalo would take a chance on Lehner, he's 23,  a big body, and has a fair amount of NHL experience. Of course it's dependant on his health but assuming he's progressing well I think a few teams would be interested"
OttawaSenators,35eo8e,Baby-punter,2,Sat May 9 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"I think Edmonton will look for a proven starting goalie over Lehner. However, Lehner might end up being their best option, as most teams don't trade starting goalies."

OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Billsncowboys,12,Sat May 9 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain to me why this guy is hyped.   If he's so good, why didn't he get drafted or something like that?"
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,matty323,4,Sat May 9 20:23:59 2015 UTC,"Speculation, but maybe he wasn't very good at 18. Could be a late bloomer, or someone who sat on the bench behind a weaker starting goalie (politics yadda yadda), or someone who just finally got the icetime and attention he needed in college to really improve.   Like I said, I have followed absolutely nothing about thisg uy, don't know him but those are some guesses."
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,valleygoat,3,Sun May 10 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"In his final year at BU, O’Connor played in 35 games registering a record of 25-4-4, a 2.18 goals against average, one shutout and a save percentage of .927.  He's pretty big, pretty young, and his numbers improved ever year he played for BU in the toughest NCAA conference.   We weren't the only team looking to land him either, so he's been seen as a commodity worth taking seriously."
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Lemondish,8,Sun May 10 15:27:16 2015 UTC,I wonder how this will effect the current goalie controversy
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,ballinwithstalin97,4,Sat May 9 16:54:16 2015 UTC,We need an extra bench in the CTC for the backup goalies alone
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Ynnad00,5,Sat May 9 18:22:57 2015 UTC,I'd say Anderson has a higher chance at being traded because Lehner was still having concussion problems when the Sens were eliminated by the Habs.
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Memes4Gold,7,Sat May 9 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"I really hope not. Anderson is still an amazing goalie compared to Lehner. Lehner is a big goalie, which is theoretically good, but he's terrible at tracking loose pucks and he's a lot slower. It really bugs me that no one else notices that."
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,CookingInTheKitchen,2,Sun May 10 04:04:13 2015 UTC,"Anderson is a great goalie, but the problem lies with the fact that the team isn't built to compete for the Cup this year or next year (at the moment at least) and Lehner has a very high ceiling. He's played just average as an NHL goaltender, but he's 23. People have been saying he has a poor attidude and isn't as calm/cool as they would like, but neither was/is Rask. Anderson's value is very high right meow. His production has been in decline and he's injury prone. I'm a fan of both and I'm torn in this situation. Not really worried about it though. I have faith GMBM will do the right thing. Hell, maybe Hammer gets traded/doesn't even resign and we stay in a good position, because I like having a tandem of Andy/Lehner."
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Lemondish,1 point,Sun May 10 15:17:16 2015 UTC,He's really young still and I think the poster above is right. Andy provides little upside when his departure could help the finances and net someone of worth. We aren't competing for the cup for another 2 to 3 years and it's not like Andy will be the goalie we'll be using to do so.
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,johnsmith9219,2,Sun May 10 15:50:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly the Sens goalie priorities should run as follows    Anderson: proven/ solid tender (albeit injury prone)  Lenner: ""goalie of the future""  for me the jury is still out on whether he'll reach his potential or not but at least he's still young. hopefully injury's don't become a factor.   O'Connor: really he is an unknown but seems to have good potential. I cant help but remember when Gustafson was the ""next big thing"" and everyone wanted to sign him.  Hammond: As good as he was down the stretch he got exposed in the playoffs and its really hard to tell if he's a flash in the pan or legit. Either way if he wants more than 2mil/term on his next contract the Sens should let him walk, there are already to many ugly contracts on the books as it is. it would be nice to have him tandem with O'Connor in the A tho.    The wild card in this is if Lenner is not healthy by next season Hammond would make a solid backup. However I assume he will be fine by then."

Hammond was brilliant for stretches, he will have a chance to prove himself again. Anderson is rock solid, and will be our go-to guy for another few years."

OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Omega613,2,Sun May 10 18:55:11 2015 UTC,Oh the offseason just got interesting.
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,MelvinFinklethorpe,5,Sat May 9 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"What difference did this make to add to ""interest"" that wouldn't already have been present? O'Conner will be in the AHL to start next season, so he has no particular impact on the Lehner/Andy/Hammond debate - at least not this year. Granted, he could push Lehner for the ""future goalie"" conversation, but O'Connor has proven nothing at AHL/ECHL level, let alone an NHL level. So those two shouldn't (yet) be being compared or contrasted."
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Omega613,4,Sat May 9 17:56:55 2015 UTC,The org. told him they'd trade a goalie to make room for him so I assume we're going to make some goalie moves. Especially with contract talks with Hammond already started.  Personally I think Hammond would be/is a fine number 2 so we don't need Andy+Lehner. O'Connor (whom we assume pans out) puts Ottawa in a position to feel comfortable making a trade.
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,veryimprobable,1 point,Sat May 9 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"There's one source for that rumour (Wayne Scanlan), and even if he's reasonably trustworthy, he even says it without absolute certainty himself:   Quite sure the Senators told free agent BU prospect Matt O'Connor the org would be trading a goalie in the future to clear room for him.   First off, it does say ""in the future"", which offers no specific timeline, not even implicitly. Secondly, it doesn't say at what level a goalie would be moved in this alleged future. O'Connor has said recently that he's ""Very open to being in AHL next year"", so moving an AHL tender (one under an Ottawa contract, or under a Binghampton contract) would be a reasonable interpretation of this rumour. But sufficed to say, he's not in the running for an NHL job any earlier than the 2016/17 season.  Between now and early next year, the only goalie situation it seems to directly affect is (a) Driedger/Hogberg in the AHL (or ECHL/Sweden), and (b) we're not likely to draft any goalies in this year's draft.  If Hammond re-signs, then there's a good chance one of Anderson or Lehner get traded, but whether that's this offseason or sometime next season/off-season remains to be seen. However, Hammond re-signing is the only factor there that directly/significantly influences Andy/Lehner's futures. O'Connor might make it easier to trade Lehner rather than Andy, but by contrast to Hammond's contract decision this has virtually no effect. If, for example, Hammond walks then there's no chance we trade Lehner or Andy this season for O'Connor. As it stands, O'Connor is no more experienced or highly rated than Driedger (for example) - the media coverage has everything to do with his situation as a young UFA rather than his abilities."
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,Omega613,3,Sat May 9 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"He did go 25-4-4 with a .927 sv% in the NCAA this season, it's not like he's a slouch"
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,TrulyMagnificient,1 point,Sat May 9 21:56:08 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely correct, and I think at worst he's capable of stabilizing our AHL goaltending situation alongside Driedger and if nothing else that's nice for other prospects in the system because it introduces them to a winning atmosphere and potential playoff games. At best, he makes an excellent and somewhat homegrown NHL backup/starter for us to use or trade one day. Where in that spectrum his future lies remains uncertain, but I do like the sound of his work ethic and attitude, so that's a great sign.  But his past numbers mean relatively little. They're good, but plenty of goalies do well in the NCAA and don't amount to much. Add to that our recent mixed/mediocre success scouting and signing undrafted/late drafted college players (Eg. Greening, Winchester, DaCosta, Hammond, Dzingel, McCormick, etc.), and I'm not necessarily sold yet that O'Conner will be an NHL goalie. He could be amazing, he could be a bust, but his development will determine what happens in that regard.  For me, the big positives here are the fact that (a) we got a relatively desirable asset effectively for free (no players/picks given up), (b) goalie ceiling and development is notoriously tough to project, so the more you have the better your chances to end up with someone who pans out well in the long term, and (c) it's a step in the right direction to dispelling the myth that we're an undesirable location for free agents. I don't mean to talk down our communal excitement over this event, but I think it's important to remember that he's not some magical amazing NHL player at this time, so expectations (current and future) need to be kept in check and judgement (positive or negative) reserved."
OttawaSenators,35eoq0,xBarDown,3,Sat May 9 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"Seriously Omega, when are you starting a sens blog? You could just take your reddit comments and it would be better analysis than most of the sens articles I read."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,MrSpaceBaby,9,Sun May 10 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"Our goaltending situation can be easily broken up in 3 parts.  NHL: We were already going to trade a goalie for next season regardless of the O'Connor signing. We can't expect to rotate three goalies throughout the season and have much consistency. I think we either see a move before the draft, or we wait a month or two into the season to have a better idea of who would be the best player to trade. (I'm not going to get into who should be traded, because ¯_(ツ)_/¯.) Any possible way this goes down, we should have two goalies by next trade deadline  AHL: This is where O'Connor comes in. He's just came out of college and is still young and unproven, and therefore isn't quite NHL ready. He's already said he's committed to his development, and that means time in the minors, we can't rush him. Chris Driedger has played really well in the AHL when he was called up due to Hammond coming up to the NHL (6-0-0, 2.55 GAA, .923 S%). He's only going to be 21 by next season and isn't being supported by Evansville in the ECHL, so having a shared/backup role in the AHL might be the next logical step in his development. What I'd like to see is Mannino and Greenham cut their ties in Bingo and we can see a O'Connor/Driedger pairing down there.  OTHER: The only other goaltending prospect we have (barring anyone we might pick in the draft) is Marcus Hogberg. He's a really unpredictable prospect, but IMO his peak potential might be somewhere around Neuvirth/Enroth type quality. He might be only a potential future backup, but he's still only 20 so he's worth keeping around. It's been said for a while that he'd make a jump to North America next season, but if Driedger makes the AHL squad next season (which he might have a decent chance) his only shot at that would be in the ECHL. However there are still the options that he stays in Sweden for at least another year, which isn't unlikely. There's also the chance that Bingo will try a three goalie system like they did this year with Hammond/Greenham/Mannino. All three are viable options for him, but if he does end up coming to North America next season, I think he'll end up seeing time in the ECHL.  So we got for next season:   NHL: Two of Anderson/Hammond/Lehner  AHL: O'Connor/Driedger  ECHL/Europe: Hogberg  This way we have a potentially solid NHL tandem for the next couple of years, and we could give O'Connor a shot if it isn't quite working out. O'Connor has time to develop in the AHL before he jumps up to the big league, and when that happens we'll hopefully know a lot more about our two remaining goaltenders and which one would be better to move. And Driedger and Hogberg have anywhere from 4-8 years to develop (considering most goaltenders enter the league in their mid to late 20's) if they develop well before they're NHL ready.  So we don't quite have the horribly congested goaltending conundrum that everyone is making it out to be. In fact, it's quite balanced for the time being, even if it is really good. O'Connor's not going to be suppressed in the minors for the rest of his career here, he'll get the opportunity to break through into the NHL when he's ready for it."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,TorinK92,2,Sun May 10 02:50:41 2015 UTC,"This makes sense, the only problem is if you are trading away one of the ""three"" you most likely wont get too good of a return. Anderson is solid most games but is  inconsistent at some. He is getting old and most teams that are looking for a goalie that is young enough to grow with the team. Lehner looked very promising at first and I still believe he can live up to that hype since he is only 23 but not sure how much value he has because he is unproven. Then there is Hammond who IMO would not fetch anything that would be worth trading him for. He could totally be a one hit wonder but what if? I doubt any team would take the risk of trading for him for anything more than a 2nd. I do therefor believe teams like the Sharks and Oilers would be interested in picking up a Lehner/Anderson to help their situation. I do realize why O'Connor made sense, for any team really. I would predict a Anderson trade just because of all the younger goalies coming threw the system but I am not management so yeah. Thanks for the input, I am a Leafs fan and don't know too much about how these players play night in and night out but from what I know these are my thoughts :)"
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,TorinK92,3,Sun May 10 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"There's a fine line here. Anderson has by far the highest trade value, but he's our only Proven starter (He's been top 10 in the league for S% 3 out of the past 5 years, and is rock solid in the playoffs.)   Lehner's concussion messes things up a bit. If his symptoms don't improve by the start of next season, he might be rendered untradeable, but also wouldn't bring anything to the team during that time.   Hammond is the biggest wild card out of the three. 24 games in a clutch playoff run is a decent sample size, so we know he has the skill, but we don't know how he'll handle the starter or backup duties for a full season. We have no idea if we have a Tim Thomas or a Jim Carey in Hammond."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,thekindlyman555,1 point,Sun May 10 04:11:06 2015 UTC,"Nobody would trade for Hammond because IIRC he's a UFA so he can just leave for nothing if Ottawa doesn't re-sign him. And if Ottawa re-signs him, they won't go try to flip him in the near future..."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,jimtheclowned,7,Sun May 10 06:36:29 2015 UTC,"In short: Stocking the war chest. Rather have assets and not need them, than need them and not have them.  Also supposedly O'Connor wants to play AHL and develop first and not be thrown in the fire so its for the future.  There is no guarantee Hammond signs back here, there is no guarantee on when Lehner is free and clear from post concussion syndrome. Its a smart move that can either pay dividends in 2-5 years, or be washed away in 2-5 years.  Hammond in my eyes needs to play another 10-20 in the NHL, see how he handles them. He pulls the same stuff he did then he is golden. As of now though, those 2 shakey games in the playoffs showed me he is human. Yes he deserves a contract, but not a godly saviour esque contract."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,SirRaava,4,Sun May 10 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"Did not realize O'Connor wanted to play in the AHL, I thought it was like a Casey Bailey deal(Wanted NHL time). Now it makes sense that ANY team would want O'Connor because its basically a free prospect. I agree, Hammond in the playoffs gave me an idea that he is a one hit wonder. He needs to prove himself to earn a big contract, I think he will have to be signed to a bridge deal because I don't think anyone will sign him to an elite level contract just yet."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,TheKandyCinema,5,Sun May 10 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, O'Connor said he wanted to go to a place with a good system set up so that he could develop as a prospect more. Confused as to why he had EDM in the final 4 for that reason, but that's what I had read"
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,Omega613,1 point,Sun May 10 04:42:16 2015 UTC,Hammond actually played good in the playoffs. Just lack of defense in the first couple games and he got thrown under the bus. He had nowhere near his AHL stats in the playoffs.
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,Lakronn,3,Wed May 13 05:52:28 2015 UTC,"Neither Hammond nor Lehner are proven #1 goalie's on this team, and them being ""capable"" of that role right now is debatable. Both have had good stretches in the NHL, for sure, but neither can be relied upon yet with certainty to play 50+ games and put up consistently average-to-good numbers like Andy. Hell, there's no guarantee even that Hammond/Lehner will ultimately be able to handle a backup position reliably yet.  Similarly, O'Connor is a prospect - don't let the media attention fool you into thinking otherwise. He had a good career in the NCAA system, but it remains to be seen how he will perform in the AHL, let alone the NHL when he (might be) ready in a couple seasons. We certainly hope he pans out and becomes and NHL-caliber goalie, but we'll have to wait and see.  The closest comparable he has in our system right now is Driedger (not Hammond/Lehner). Both are young, played/playing in North America, relatively inexperienced at a pro level, and both were acquired by the Sens with some level of pedigree/hype (via draft/free agency for Driedger/O'Connor, respectively). And, both will likely be playing for our affiliate/farm team(s) next season - either both in the AHL, or possibly Driedger in the ECHL I'm assuming.  As to why? It sounds like a cop-out, but... why not? He's a free asset, partially developed, and has decent upside with almost no risk. If we had traded for him or used a draft pick, then this would be a very important question. But in essence, he was ""free"" with the exception of his salary and pushing a couple of our younger guys further down the depth chart. It's the same reason you guys signed Casey Bailey - you didn't need another depth center, but the more you have the more likely you have one (or more) develop into something good/useful and/or the more assets you have (long term) in terms of trade.   In summary, the 3 big reasons for us to sign him in my mind:   We got a relatively desirable asset effectively for free (no players/picks given up), low risk - potentially high reward. Goalie ceiling and development is notoriously tough to project, so the more you have the better your chances to end up with someone who pans out well in the long term, It's a step in the right direction to dispelling the myth that we're an undesirable location for free agents (among fans, but more importantly among players).    In spite of Sens/media hype though, I think it's important to remember that he's not some magical amazing NHL player at this time, so expectations (current and future) need to be kept in check and judgement (positive or negative) reserved."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,nachochease,1 point,Sun May 10 02:42:05 2015 UTC,Hammond will be an NHL goalie this year either in Ottawa or elsewhere.   This leaves room for at the bare minimum a starting position in binghamton
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,originalthoughts,1 point,Sun May 10 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"I don't see much controversy at all.  Firstly, I'm assuming Hammond walks and doesn't re-sign in Ottawa.  Then Andy and Lehner are #1 and  #2 respectively.  O'Connor is the starter in Bingo.  And then management can sit back and assess who Andy's successor will be.  No need to trade anyone.  Hammond's poor playoff performance is probably closer to his real level of play.  I know they made Hammond a contract offer, but I seriously doubt that they're expecting him to sign."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,nachochease,1 point,Sun May 10 20:17:15 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't Hammond sign in Ottawa? He seems to have really liked in here, and he has really good chemistry with the team and with the fans. One of his top 3 moment in his life has to be the burgers on the ice, I really doubt he'll want to go anywhere else."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,canuck_11,1 point,Sun May 10 22:26:48 2015 UTC,"Hammond has been a career minor leaguer, and now's his chance to cash in and get an NHL contract.  How much are the Sens going to offer him when they already have two NHL caliber goalies + a newly signed prospect?  At 27 Hammond's #1 priority is going to be $$$$, and he'll undoubtedly get more on the open market as a free agent.  The only scenario in which I see Hammond returning to Ottawa is if Lehner's concussion is serious enough that he may not be ready to play next season.  In that case Hammond would make a good insurance policy."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,benches48,1 point,Sun May 10 23:42:48 2015 UTC,Hammond is very unproven still. He cannot be trusted with the starting job until at least another year of development. O'Connor needs a year in the AHL before he can be assessed as ready for the NHL.
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,Omega613,-9,Sun May 10 02:43:19 2015 UTC,Lehner's bad. Period. He has not lived up to the potiential he was hyped up to be while O'Connor appears to have a better chance on becoming a better goalie than Lehner ever was. Hammond & Andy are our NHL goalies while O'Connor will play with the AHL.
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,jimtheclowned,4,Sun May 10 02:38:18 2015 UTC,Lehner's bad. Period. He has not lived up to the potiential he was hyped up to be   Can you prove that statement?
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,benches48,5,Sun May 10 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"In support of Omega here, Lehner isn't necessarily bad (he's 23 mind you) He's aggressive and raw IMO. Doesn't help that whenever he played, the defense was pretty much a clothes line and left him out to dry a few times.   From the glimpses you see, as well as his physical ability he does have talent. If he calms down I think he can be much much better."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,Omega613,-7,Sun May 10 02:52:43 2015 UTC,"Easily, every game he has played in, he's lost. He's not appealing, he plays sloppily sometimes and he's lost that shine he had when we had to deal with three NHL-level goalies (Andy, Lehner & Bishop). He's lost lustre."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,benches48,5,Sun May 10 02:50:35 2015 UTC,"You've qualitatively described several games he played independent of team/goalie performance metrics or history, and followed it up with an entirely subjective/irrelevant description. This is his second season with more than 12 games played (age 23), and he posted a 90.5 SV%. Carey Price also posted those the same numbers in 2008/09 (age 21) and 2012/13 (age 25) - would you have given up on him too? I know many Montreal fans had.  Now I'm not suggesting Lehner isn't bad (or won't be bad), but I'm not convinced you can possibly make such a definitive statement at this point based off the data we have available (feel free to do some research and dissuade me from that opinion though). However, I will reserve my judgement on his performance to date and the potential rebuttal/confirmation to your conclusion until after I've finished an analysis I'm presently planning/working on."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,Omega613,2,Sun May 10 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"Hm, true. Maybe we need to develop Lehner further when he's back from his concussion?"
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,benches48,1 point,Sun May 10 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"In my early opinion (before I've done much digging into his numbers, so I'm reserving the right to change that opinion if need be :P), I think patience is likely best in the short term. Between his bad season and injury, he's lost almost all his value, so trading him now would be ""selling him low"" to an extreme extent - the small chance he recovers and becomes very good likely isn't likely worth the paltry return we would get right now. I thinking giving him one more season to rebound and show some positive signs of progression and high level play, contrary to many games this season (especially after his concussion) would better help us/the team get a read on where his ceiling will actually taper off. We don't need him to be the next Carey Price, but we do need him to be above average statistically (~91.8%-92.5%) and capable of doing that consistently year over year for 50-60+ games in order to become a future starter for us.  Rolling 3 goalies to start next season seems best in my mind. Lehner might rebound, or he may continue to struggle or show lingering effects from his concussion. Hammond may show his 20+ games  weren't a fluke and become one of the best backups/semi-starters in the league, or he may show that his playoff performances were more indicative of his long term play - also, he may not even re-sign here. Anderson may continue to be a solid and steady veteran goalie, or his age may begin to show through, or his injury woes could rear up again. We'll never know for sure, but a little more play time and data could help us determine which of those possibilities are most likely.  This is the sort of situation where the answer may become relatively obvious in a hurry (either by Hammond not re-signing, or by one goalie struggling in the first month or two next season, or Lehner not recovering, etc.), in which case the Sens decision could become a whole lot easier. Additionally, perhaps all 3 thrive and we get a better return from an injured/struggling team in desperate/immediate need of a goalie. Any idea what type of return goalies fetch in the off-season vs. mid-season? Genuinely curious if one is noticeably great than the other.  If we must (for some reason) make a trade in the summer, Andy would likely be the logical option, for better or worse. His value is high meaning a better return and the cap space ($4.2M) we would get back would be very beneficial, although the risk of us going into next season with a Hammond/Lehner duo scares me. Hammond could also be let go/refuse to sign, and/or have his negotiation rights be traded for a late round pick.  In my mind, there are so many options and every one of them carries significant risk, and debateable reward. Almost all the trade scenarios I work out in my head don't necessarily benefit us, at least not before letting all 3 play a bit next season. One thing that I wish we had access to is our goalie coach, Rick Wamsley's, unfiltered opinion on each goalie to better understand why the team might make the decision it makes."
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,Funkativity,2,Sun May 10 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"So basically almost the same thing we did with Andy-Lehner & Bishop back in '12-'13? Andy's a nice option in the back since he's had the playoff experience that Lehner and Hammond don't have. But yeah, if Lehner doesn't recover, would it be a good idea to trade him since he's just taking up cap space?  (that reply was probably one of the only posts that hasn't gotten downvoted to hell yet :P)"
OttawaSenators,35g8v0,benches48,0,Sun May 10 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"Easily, every game he has played in, he's lost.   He's won 9 games this year.  lying about easily verified stats makes you look like a complete imbecile."
OttawaSenators,35ffsu,Pilfdominy,15,Sat May 9 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm reserving judgement until I see some of Nick Paul's play.  Not overly happy at this point."
OttawaSenators,35ffsu,evilJaze,34,Sat May 9 23:23:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of us were really expecting Chiasson to replace Spezza by any means.

OttawaSenators,35ffsu,Cogeno,5,Sat May 9 21:02:04 2015 UTC,You put it way more polite than I would have.  :P
OttawaSenators,35ffsu,Valentine96,14,Sun May 10 16:49:02 2015 UTC,"He's still 24 and entering his third full season in the league. I have a good feeling he could turn it around and become a solid 3rd/4th liner in the league. (This might just be a sophomore slump, after all.) He needs a lot of motivation to go with that as well.  The other key parts to the deal are still in the future for us. Nick Paul is one our best prospects right now, and it's always nice to have prospect depth with players like Guptill. Then there's the 42nd overall pick which is in a good position in a good draft.  Overall, I like what we got from the trade, Chiasson has been meh (if that) since he's gotten here, but we got some really good pieces for the future back from you guys. We were trying to trade an injury prone, aging, 1/2 centre in a saturated market and it looked for a while like we'd be getting peanuts in return. I think we got fair value for Spezza, and I might end up really liking the trade in the future depending on how Paul and the draft pick turn out."
OttawaSenators,35ffsu,TorinK92,2,Sat May 9 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"I'm hopping he does something next year but if he continues the path he's on he will turn into Greening 2.0, disappointment edition."
OttawaSenators,35ffsu,johnsmith9219,14,Sun May 10 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"In a word? Underwhelming.  That likely has a lot to do with who we gave up in the trade (namely, Spezza), and comparing him to Chiasson (the only NHL ready player we got in return). That may not be fair to make that comparison, but it's all we are able to do this early on. It's not like we expected him to replace Spezza or his numbers, afterall this was a quality for quantity deal when on our side we hope to gain depth and perhaps one or two components stand out eventually - but we certainly hoped for better production or better signs I think. Speaking of the other pieces, Guptill was apparently really bad in Binghamton, so barring a quick turn around he's looking like a bust. Paul has fortunately had a great season and shows a lot of potential to be a large, two-way, goal scoring forward, potential middle-6 NHL ceiling.  The 2nd rounder will be nice this season given the draft depth and relatively depleted prospect system (most of 'em graduated to the NHL roster over the past two seasons). We also don't know what the other trade offers were or would have been, so it's hard really to call this a bad trade for us since our hands were tied in needing to trade Spezza (he wouldn't re-sign here)  and him having a limited NTC (that's technically our bad though). But also important, the cap space Spezza left behind and the roster spots he opened have allowed our lineup to develop more appropriately, so there's an opportunity cost to incorporate into the deal from our side that often goes un-discussed.  But more on Chiasson. The bulk of his point production came early on while playing in the top-6 with much better players - but he wasn't making them any better (arguably worse, in fact). He had trouble generating offense, and on a team which relies heavily now on balanced scoring everyone needs to be a bit of a threat, even when playing small minutes. Unfortunately, his defensive game isn't spectacular either, so it's not as if we could excuse his mediocre production in saying he had tough starts/assignments and did lot's of positive stuff in his own end. On top of that, he held a team worst penalty differential at -17 (24 taken, 7 drawn), often taking boneheaded hooking/holding penalties in the offensive zone for no reason at all. Generally, not a favorable season. I wouldn't say he was our worst player, or even worst forward, but we definitely expected more.  I think Chiasson has the tools to be a decent bottom-6 guy (size, good hands, good forechecking ability, good attitude, decent speed), but it's not as if we were desperate need of those (nor are most teams).  If he works with the trainers in the off-season and re-signs cheaply, then perhaps we'll be more pleased with his performance next season if he can step up his two-way game at least (if he's an Ottawa Senator next season, that is). Otherwise, at least his size (6'4"") and age (24) means that some team is likely to look upon him favourably and seemingly overpay in thinking he's a 'project' (which he might be, for all we know)."

Average skater, average shooter, average strength, average hockey IQ, average everything.

OttawaSenators,35ffsu,CatoDarpa,4,Sun May 10 13:07:12 2015 UTC,"I was pretty happy to see Spezza go. He was, for me, the second-most frustrating Sens player ever to watch, after Kovalev, though he lasted far longer. He was also aging and expensive and unlikely to sustain point-per-game production much longer.  That said, the return so far, as others have stated here, has not been inspiring.  But, that said, the Sens feel more like a team now that could easily be called Youth U. A lot of young guys having fun, learning on the job, finding their game.  So in the end, I like the deal. After all, the kids pushed into the playoffs this year. That's an improvement, and I expect there's more to come. :)"

OttawaSenators,35ffsu,walahiguy,1 point,Sun May 10 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"Chiasson is entirely average in every way. He's fine a a fourth liner, probably even above average, but truthfully he's a disappointment relative to the expectations media and management set for us fans regarding him.   Guptill is looking like a complete bust, but I think he was mainly a toss in anyway. To go from college hockey to the AHL should be an easier transition than the CHL kids, and yet at 23 in his first season in the AHL he looked terrible. Don't forsee him having any NHL career.  Nick Paul has an unbelievable ceiling, with his combination of size, speed and hands. Doesn't have the same instincts for the game of a Spezza or a Mark Stone, but he does have natural finishing ability. He will be the steal of the trade, ending up as a 30/20 guy who can throw the body in the bigs, IMO.   Of course, if that's really all we get with the second rounder, hard to call that a steal for Spezza.   The most important thing this team got by moving Spezza was 7+ million in cap space, IMO. a lot of that space is going to be used this offeason on the very same young guys that just broke out to go on that great streak late."

I think it depends on how high the organization is on a guy like Wideman though, as like I've said I think this team might do well to just stay internal, swap Wideman in at Gryba's spot and keep Phillips for spot duty. Given his age, Ceci has played pretty damn well, but he could also slide down beside Boro and then that older veteran could be brought in for a couple of years (so I'm thinking older than the 28-32 range) while Ceci and Wideman develop for a couple more years."

OttawaSenators,35bw9x,e_cybo_pooch,4,Sat May 9 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

In 56 regular season games he scored 3 times, then twice more in 6 playoff games. Here's a list:   Nov.4, 2014 v.DET Scores late in the 3rd to break a 1-1 tie, which would stand as the game-winning goal. Mar.17, 2015 @CAR Ties the game at 1 in the 2nd period. We eventually won in OT (on that highlight slick deke+pass by Turris, finished by Stone). April 2, 2015 v.TBL Scores the OT game winner, follows it up with a great celebratory facial expression. April 17, 2015, Game 2 @MTL Scores in the latter half of the 3rd to tie the game at 2. We lost in OT, but we got there thanks to Wier that day. April 24, 2015, Game 5 @MTL Technically less timely by comparison, but Wier put the Sens up 2-0 in the 1st period. That later stood as the game winner in the 5-1 victory over the Habs."

OttawaSenators,3542in,Shack_TS,7,Wed May 6 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"I would love to sign a guy like Petry, or secondarily Sekera/Franson. But I fear the bidding may will get too high, and I would be more comfortable re-signing our key free agents before committing big dollars to a less known commodity (namely Zbad, Hoff, Stone, Pageau, and Condra too would be nice). Unfortunately, Condra excluded, most of those deals likely won't be signed before July 1st/UFA season.   I agree with your conclusion about narrowing down to Zybnek Michalek. I don't honestly know a lot about him, and I'm not thrilled looking at his current age (32), but as a brother of Milo I wonder if he would sign for 1 year at ~$2.5M while every other team argues over the bigger names. Wouldn't help out much offensively, but statistically seems to be a superb shot suppressor which wouldn't go unappreciated here in Ottawa. I know Boro has played a little bit on the right side too, so perhaps something like:   Methot - Karlsson Wier-Ceci Michalek-Boro/Gryba/Wideman   If not, I wonder if Michael Stone (Mark's brother, in ARZ) could be a trade option? He's not (seemingly) as good as the other names in the list, but still young and would be a decent upgrade over Gryba on the third pair right side. He seems pretty well rounded, with slightly more offensive upside than Grybs. Having both Stone's could encourage both of 'em to sign here long term and perhaps for a little less - never know!  Generally speaking, I'm not looking ahead to anything significant (signing or trade), but some small, shrewd tweak to our blueline could have a big positive effect.  Out of curiousity, do you (or anyone else) have any good sources for international players (esp. KHL) who are rumoured to be coming across the pond? That might be a great source of a cheap, mid-to-high end player for cheap that we wouldn't even need to trade for."
OttawaSenators,3542in,Omega613,3,Thu May 7 00:45:16 2015 UTC,"Would love to get Michael Stone for sure, he seems like a great defensive guy that isn't bad at moving the puck out of the zone. Had a crazy number of blocks and hits this year.  I think Arizona could use a goalie, Mike Smith sucks and they seem to have empty cupboards in net.   I dunno about Mike Stone's value, maybe Lehner and a 2nd round pick? Maybe they are interested in Cowen?"
OttawaSenators,3542in,Chiefboss22,3,Thu May 7 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"If we could get Michalek on a short cheap deal, I'd like to see him beside Wier on the second pairing. He's not amazing defensively, but as Omega noted, his shot suppression is top notch, and he could help insulate wiercioch by providing stable defense, and insulate Ceci by putting him on the third pairing right now. When his contract is up, ceci should be properly ready for a top 4 role."
OttawaSenators,3542in,Iphikratous3,3,Thu May 7 01:44:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I realize defence is seen as our weak point but I'd much rather let our pairings mature for a few more years along with our forwards. The first pairing isn't going to change, and the second pairing of Wiercioch-Ceci played quite well in the second half and the organization will be in no hurry to change that. The sky is the limit for Ceci as he gets older. So realistically we're just looking at a stop-gap measure for the #6... and I have no problem with Boro as a 5 guy right now. We already have the internal solution with Wideman (assuming he re-signs, which he likely will without much hesitation if there's an obvious opening for him) should we move or demote Gryba.   I don't really see the glaring holes everyone else seems to see, and since we aren't in a position to win I don't see the point of bringing in an older stop-gap solution when we could be given our internal options some NHL experience in a bottom-pairing role. Would it be cool if we got Stone or Michalek? Sure. But they aren't really the players we need right now unless we're getting rid of both Gryba and Boro OR sliding Ceci down to the 3rd pairing beside (presumably) Boro. That's a possibility and having Zybenek's brother here certainly helps, but a contract on our end would only really make sense if it were for a couple of years. Given how he's been playing shorter seasons the past half dozen, I'd think he might want a longer-term deal with more security, as it might be his last opportunity given the way he plays.   We also aren't realistically going to fetch Green or a more mobile defensive guy like Petry on our budget and timeline. Almost everything that's realistic would just be a side shuffle that would be largely unnecessary in our current state and take time away from other players in the organization. Get back to me in 2-3 years once our d-corps develop and we're in a more realistic chance to at least somewhat challenge, then maybe we make some tangible, bigger moves."
OttawaSenators,3542in,PaddleDown,2,Thu May 7 05:51:42 2015 UTC,Ehrhoff pls
OttawaSenators,3542in,shining_,2,Thu May 7 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"The Sens have a couple options when it comes to defence.    Cowan At 24 he is still pretty young for a defenceman and he was injured this year so I wouldn't give up on him just yet. He also has two more years left on his contract to prove himself and if he's still not improving then whatever, we wouldn't get much in return for him right now anyway.  Weircioch is 24 too and played great down the stretch so it would be premature to trade him unless the Snes are getting a proven top 4 in return. He probably has the highest trade value out of the defenceman that have the potential to be moved but it would take more than just him to get a deal done.    Gryba a 6/7 guy who is 26 probably the most expendable, I can't think of any scenario where we want to keep him. His cap hit is only 1.2 mil so he probably wont be to hard to move.   Phillips at 37 coming off a pretty serious knee injury I'm hoping Phillips retires because he has zero trade value.   The only way I'd be okay with moving Weircioch or Cowan is if we got a top 4 defenceman but that seems unlikely. Free agency could be an option but I doubt that the Sens will spend what it would take to get Franson/Petry/Sekera. They might look at a guy like Michalek but like many of the FA defenceman this year he isn't a top 4 at this stage in his career and the last thing the Sens kneed to do right now its to add to the log jam on defence. I think the Sens defence should look like-   Karl/Methot  Top 4/Cecei  Weircioch/Cowan  Borowiecki  But It'll probably be more like  Karl/Methot Weircioch/Cecei Boro/Cowan Gryba and maybe even Phillips. In any case I don't want to see 8 defenceman on the roster all year like we did this year."

OttawaSenators,350hf9,Shack_TS,4,Wed May 6 02:08:01 2015 UTC,"Don't really understand the logic at the end. Stop using his height as a reason to not give up on him? But other skills can be developed, size can't. One would think Cowen would be working his ass off this summer after being benched for almost half the season to try and secure a roster spot on precisely the poor skill areas mentioned in the article. Sure there are a few good sub-24 year old dmen in the league, but the majority of dmen take a long time to develop. It seems like the author is focusing on cowens negatives and ignoring his potential. You can see his size and athleticism is there, he's just not polished and has yet to develop zone awareness at the NHL level. I'm not saying he will, but to ignore a young dman's potential due to some poor advanced stats in his formative years is silly.  Tldr; size is one of the only reasons NOT to give up on Cowen, other skills can be acquired through hard work, cowens potential is evident and it's too early to give up on him."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,iJaysus,1 point,Wed May 6 03:39:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly, people seem to forget that he is only 24 which is pretty young for a defenceman. Plus he was injured this year so that obviously hampered his development. I wouldn't give up on him just yet. Cowan has two more years left on his contract to prove himself and if it's still not working out then whatever, we wouldn't get much in return for him right now anyway."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,johnsmith9219,2,Thu May 7 15:18:07 2015 UTC,"My sentiments exactly. I envision ""giving up"" as dealing him for a later pick or maybe a prospect. Obviously if the value's right I'd be fine with a trade, but with his current numbers I don't think we're getting anywhere near what we should for a guy like him. Obviously we need cap space, but we have a lot of dead weight elsewhere that will only depreciate in value - and we could get similar value trading those guys as we would with trading Cowen, who still has an upside."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,iJaysus,0,Thu May 7 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"He's been in the league for 5 years now though, that's quite the sample. I just don't see how he could develop any further from what I've seen. I mean some cases would be different, but he's not athletic in my eyes. Probably one of the slower skaters out there. Like I said, sure he could turn out fine, I just find that very hard to believe. Talking about his height is a cop out"
OttawaSenators,350hf9,iJaysus,3,Wed May 6 08:24:31 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. When I watch I can see that stuff is there, and he's still young for a dman. No reason to give up yet."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,iJaysus,0,Wed May 6 12:42:35 2015 UTC,"People are desperately hoping he turns into something useful because he would be a waste of a top-10 pick otherwise. Agree to disagree, because I don't see a good player in the next few years"
OttawaSenators,350hf9,walahiguy,1 point,Wed May 6 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I definitely understand that. Other than the fact that I disagree I thought the article was well structured. Good work, keep em comin"

OttawaSenators,350hf9,walahiguy,3,Thu May 7 07:46:56 2015 UTC,"for a guy his size he is a good skater and was very good before injuries. Not the worst skater on the D corps, that would be Wiercioch.   He hasn't been in the league 5 years, he has played about 2.5 seasons.   you mentioned Hedman. Do you know how much people were shitting on him before he turned it around? He was called a bust with zero hockey IQ.   it doesn't really matter though, I would take Murray's opinion over some kid's any day of the week"
OttawaSenators,350hf9,InTURRISting,-1,Wed May 6 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"Dude, Hedman's hockey IQ is/was nowhere near the depths of Jared Cowen.  He plays defense like a potato.   Every shift I can show you his serious screw ups with a magic pen if you like.   He is un-coachable.   Everything I've seen points to this, including his attitude."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,iJaysus,1 point,Wed May 6 14:50:42 2015 UTC,you can do that with a lot of defensemen (micro-analyzing every shift). Cowen is just the new whipping boy. Hedman's hockey IQ was seriously questioned as well as Zibanejad's.
OttawaSenators,350hf9,InTURRISting,0,Wed May 6 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"New whipping boy?  No he is a wreck.   I have been criticising him since he came back from his major injury.     Zbads hockey IQ as a 6th pick has never been in question.   By who?  The bloggers?  I don't even know what you're talking about anymore.   Are you Jared Cowen?  Because if you are, you are so terrible I would prefer a pairing of Chris Neil and Phillips.   At least that way we can spread out the bad penalties, and brain farts.   Neil could put us offsite too lots, with failure to keep the puck in the zone.  Also the downvote button is not a disagree button.   Something that is very much wrong with this sub."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,iJaysus,3,Wed May 6 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"Downvoted because of your unwillingness to have a discussion on the matter. Cowen is still young and can be good. I can definitely say you have no idea how coachable he really is, assuming you're just a fan and not on the Senators coaching staff. Good players have been in his shoes and turned out fine. That's all the commenter was trying to say, but you seem set on writing him off because of a couple bad seasons when he's young. Though I definitely disagree, I downvoted because you come off as someone with a closed mind who doesn't really know what they're talking about, who doesn't seem interested in others' opinions."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,InTURRISting,-4,Wed May 6 15:13:25 2015 UTC,"Downvoted because of your unwillingness to have a discussion on the matter.   Really, I've been trying to have an honest discussion about Cowen's impact on this team for years now.   This is not an argument:   you seem set on writing him off because of a couple bad seasons when he's young.   I absolutely know what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about his poor attitude, his poor response to adversity, the amount of time he's been scratched, and a complete lack of development.  Anything.  See thats a list of analysis, not some nebulous, WELL UH HE COULD BE GOOD- HEDMAN!   or YOU DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY COACH HIM.  Seriously, you actually think that's an argument?   And one that is worthy of addressing?   In philosophy we call that a non-falsifiable claim- designed such that it can never be addressed.  Such arguments are regularly discarded as nonsense.  So I give you one last opportunity to make an actual claim:  Can anyone show me Cowen making a solid play/contribution in one or more games this year?  Wow downvoted faster than you could possibly have read this.  GFY POS."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,walahiguy,4,Wed May 6 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't downvote, but ok. You seem a bit mad. We clearly have differing opinions, and though my argument may not be the strongest, it's how I feel about the player after watching him for 2+ seasons and it's not like your arguments are rock solid either. You just don't know, and neither do I. And that's fine. But it really sucks you have to be such a dick about it"
OttawaSenators,350hf9,InTURRISting,0,Wed May 6 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"How do you not understand, this is not an argument?   You just don't know, and neither do I.    And yes I am hopping mad because no one here wants to actually discuss Jared Cowen, just their nebulous, non-hockey thoughts about him."

OttawaSenators,350hf9,InTURRISting,0,Wed May 6 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"No.  Im tired of this bullshit.   If you are going to defend Cowen, provide an argument and keep your votes in your pocket.    if you make an actual argument no one should downvote you at all and frankly I'm the only one here who has made any sort of measurable, observational claim.   I could be wrong but counter it with something actually falsifiable."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Wed May 6 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"But I agree that he's not a great D-man now. It's his potential to be good that I don't want to give up on. If you are 100% sure that he has no potential and is a wash, then you are clearly unwilling to hear the opinions of others, because you can't know that. That's my point, and I know it's hard to understand without cold hard stats, but it's just how I feel.  I don't really care how right you think you might be, but there's no reason to be such a dick about it."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Wed May 6 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"because you can't know that.   How you feel is not an argument.  The stats speak for themselves. They are so voluminous I haven't bothered to collect any in a long time.  Compare him to any DMAN on our roster, including call-ups."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,Voljjin,3,Wed May 6 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"Jesus fucking Christ, I withheld from saying this on your other articles but stop throwing out opinion as fact. And back up your arguments with some actual analysis.    ""He's not even that good"" how? Why? Anything?!? ""In fact I'd argue he's gotten even worse."" How so? Why do you say that? Give the reader SOMETHING to support any of these claims.  And a click bait title that obviously contradicts your first 3 sentences. Who ever said his size is a skill and not an attribute anyway? Who are you arguing against with that title?  Plenty of arguments to come up with if you analyze Cowen's game. Turnover, bad breakout passes, bad reads or angles, hesitation between taking the man/playing the pass.   Nothing's being analyzed here, then you say you really question Bryan Murrays ability to do his job since he supports a player who you happen to think is crap for some reason?  Next time lets see a little more effort."

Perhaps next time I'll dive deeper into that, I just felt like ranting about this topic because I've heard Murray state his height as some sort of positive on numerous occasions, as if it's why he can be good. As for ""clickbait,"" well...yes your titles are supposed to get people interested. It's essentially a rant against Murray always talking him up"

OttawaSenators,350hf9,TrulyMagnificient,4,Thu May 7 07:25:36 2015 UTC,"It really seems like the Pro-Cowen argument has devolved into: ""We can't give up on Cowen because I want him to be good""."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,TrulyMagnificient,2,Wed May 6 18:45:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. Is that such a bad thing? He's had one full season and this is one of the first years he's really been in the doghouse with coaching. I think if we don't see positive development in the next couple of years then it may be time to move on, but I do think it's too early, no matter how bad his stats seem.  It's strange to me how many people don't realize development is not instantaneous. You have to endure the bad to get to the good. It just depends if we're willing to endure his awfulness to have a chance of him being good in the future. I'm not even sure if we are, but I know I'm not ready to give up on a first round pick at 24 years old."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,benches48,2,Wed May 6 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"My issue with him is that I've seen no improvement from him since he entered the league. In fact, he's looked worse, and become a healthy scratch because of it. You just don't see a lot of signs of his potential. His awareness is awful, his positioning sucks, he's gotten scared of hitting after getting suspended, he just doesn't look promising any more.   Maybe he'll turn it around, but at some point we need to realize that we can't continually hold out hope for him."
OttawaSenators,350hf9,PaddleDown,1 point,Thu May 7 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"Totally see where you're coming from, but he's been in the league for 3 seasons and has only had 1 complete one, one year due to injury and this year due to being healthied for a significant portion of the season. IMO his physical presence is one of the biggest aspects of his game, and I personally don't think his suspension will have a huge impact on that.   You see when defensemen (especially young ones) get more experience in the NHL that stuff you mentioned (especially awareness) improves drastically. Based on his limited play in all but one season I think there's still room for improvement, and hopefully he's motivated to work on his puck skills and positioning in the summer in order to get a roster spot that unlike other years, is not guaranteed for him. Guys like him are pretty commonly criticized when they enter the league, because a lot of fans just don't have the patience to deal with their bad years even though they can end up being NHL level guys that are really valuable to have.  I definitely agree that at some point if this continues over the next 2-3 years/when his contract is up we might be wise to let him go then, but I doubt that teams want to pay his back loaded contract based on how he's playing now, so the return most likely wouldn't be enough for what we might get if we keep him. A comparable to what he could be would be someone like Braydon Coburn, who IMO is an above average 3rd pairing guy, and probably better than what we'd get in a trade for Cowen.   Anyways, all the arguments against him are absolutely valid, but I think sens management feels similar to the way I do, and would rather keep a first round pick guy than trade him for a later round pick where we have no idea what quality of player we'll get. What it all depends on is if management believes they have room for him on the roster to get more time at the NHL level to allow him to improve. I posted some of my thoughts about his actual potential here: http://www.reddit.com/r/OttawaSenators/comments/350hf9/why_jared_cowens_pure_height_is_not_a_skill/cr0eyb5 if you want to hear what I think about his actual play."

OttawaSenators,350hf9,benches48,2,Wed May 6 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"I think I've read every article you've posted here, and this was by far the worst (in my opinion) in terms of writing style.  I don't know if you were tired or distracted or what, but the whole thing made my head hurt.  Unlike most (if not all) of the others I have read, so take it for what it's worth and if you don't give a shit that's cool.  This use of parentheses makes my brain hurt: Cowen had that going for him, but the problem is he hasn’t (and I don’t think he ever will) developed skills that translate into being a quality top-4 defenseman. (And I don’t think he ever will.)    Then there is: He had a much easier route to the NHL than other players, but his size means moot point if he doesn’t do anything with it.    And: He couldn’t even get ice time over Mark Borowiecki and Eric Gryba down the stretch this season, as he was scratched in 28 games this season.    This is another one that makes my brain hurt, though technically it’s correct: There’s nothing that shows he’s been an effective defenseman in his career, and even the eye test makes him look almost worse.    Again, this is more style, but read this aloud to yourself and tell me it doesn’t sound awkward: The only reasons he is still being given a chance is because of his draft position, and his size. Teams don’t give up on top ten picks early on, even if they don’t see much in the player. It makes the team look bad, no matter how bad the player has been.    Weary means tired: It’s not just Murray who does this, it’s some people in the media that are also weary of trading him just because big defensemen have value.    Subject-Verb Agreement: If anything, the other teams sees how big and slow he is, and gives the opponents confidence that they can beat him."

I wouldn't sign him for big money, but if he can be had for 2M or under, I'd take it. Although given the way he played, I wouldn't hold it against him if he wanted to test free agency to see what the market has to offer."
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,freisenburger,2,Wed May 6 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"Well that's just it, a guy like pages or lazar came in and played like Condra did, two rookies on entry level deals. I think You can find guys like that anywhere at cheaper rates. Not saying Condra wasn't good for us, it's just that we always find guys like him"
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,walahiguy,2,Thu May 7 02:54:10 2015 UTC,"Well for sure he's replaceable. But having a guy you know if going to give you solid play is nice. Keep him around, would love to see him signed. Proven as a reliable player."
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,PaddleDown,5,Thu May 7 11:47:56 2015 UTC,"[EDIT: Apparently I went overboard and basically wrote an entire article for the comment section. Clearly need the next season to start already.]  Alright, here's my take, and it's sort of similar to what I've posted elsewhere on this sub. I'm not really touching on the AHL guys because I'm not going to pretend I follow the farm team to any real extent. Also going to roll with one option for most, rather than going between short/long, retaining RFA status or not, etc. From the net out:  ANDREW HAMMOND Unsigned or 1-way, 2 years, AAV $2.3-2.5m  Salary comparables for 2015-16 season: Lehner, Neuvirth, Khudobin, Elliot, Scrivens, Reimer  A lot of this depends on O'Connor, including the 2 year tag, as well as the trading of one of Lehner (likely if Hammond signs) or Anderson. The signing of O'Connor would have serious implications on our goaltending depth chart. I do have questions in regards to whether O'Connor will sign with us or not given that while he's stated he's more than willing to play through the AHL for a few seasons, he also wants to be able to work with an excellent goaltending coach. While Ottawa has developed some great goaltending prospects as of late, Bingo has no dedicated coach in this position.   Leaving O'Connor out of the conversation completely, right now Anderson will be our starter next season. Lehner's concussion likely isn't a long-term issue (in that goalies tend to be at a much lower risk for recurrences given that they aren't being routinely crushed) but you never know given the recovery issues. That said, he's currently a clear back-up netminder of NHL quality - although that may be all he is, it's pretty damn hard to tell with goalies. This organization has made too many strides to realistically risk our short-term future on a Hammond/Lehner duo next year, so either Lehner will be traded to make room (which is risky given his age, but if we sign O'Connor, it mitigates some of that risk), or Hammond will sign a contract with another team willing to offer him a 1-way deal, of which there will be a few. Goaltending will be the biggest decision this off-season, distantly seconded by the potential returns Hoffman might net.  ERIK CONDRA Unsigned or 1-way, 2-3 years, AAV $2-2.25m  Salary comparables for 2015-16 season: B. Boyle, Shaw, Roussel, Hagelin, C. Smith  Let me start by saying that as much as I like Condra, he's quite replaceable on the ice. That said, it also wouldn't cost much to get him re-signed to a fairly respectable deal and keep some of the chemistry alive and well. Based on some of Murray's exit interview comments, I wouldn't be surprised if Legwand is moved and coupled with a possible buy-out of Greening (savings of ~$.950/1m a season) there is a realistic chance that Condra might be re-signed. He can't score to save his life, but he's an excellent penalty killer and responsible defensive player. He'll be in the NHL next year in a similar role whether it's with Ottawa or not, but it's not unrealistic to expect him to be re-signed either.  MIKA ZIBANEJAD 1-way, 5-6 years, AAV $4-4.5m  Salary comparables for 2015-16 season: Bozak, Dubinsky, Fisher, Johansen, Backes  Zibanejad has had a steady rise in production in each of the 3 years where he's seen time in the NHL, with a 0.47 points-per game in 2012-13 and 2013-14 rising to 0.57 points-per-game this past season which likely would've been better had the team played the full season as they did under Cameron and if his linemates hadn't disappeared/been shuffled around. He's only just turned 22-years-of-age and is already a legitimate #2 centreman in the league. While they could go for a short bridge contract, I fully expect something longer-term that takes him to the early years of UFA status. The money looks high given his numbers, but could end being a big bargain in the coming years.  MARK STONE 1-way, 5-6 years, AAV $5.25m  Salary comparables for 2015-16 season: Ryan, Benn, E. Kane, Hossa, Lupul  I agree that a bridge contract makes the most sense here, but I really expect something longer term. With his 23rd birthday around the corner, a contract around 5-6 years would let Ottawa grab a couple UFA years before having to re-up him, and also ensure he has an opportunity for another contract in his prime. There's no reason to expect Stone to regress at this point, as he was the only consistent scorer throughout the second half and wasn't doing pretty bad the first half either... and even with his injury in the playoffs, was still an impact player defensively. He's one of the heart and souls of this team and I expect him to be a big part of it moving forward, and I really think the ball's in his court here.  MIKE HOFFMAN Traded or 1-way, 3-4 years, AAV $3.75-4m  Salary comparables for 2015-16 season: Berglund, Perron, Kunitz, Yakupov, MacKinnon, Simmonds, Bickell  I don't expect there's anything imminent on the Hoffman trade front, but I wouldn't be shocked if he were moved based on his age nearing UFA-eligibility and arbitration rights for the upcoming contract. He's a high-risk, high-reward player who probably won't ever be a defensive phenom, but he's proven to be able to score whenever he's moved up the line-up. He would net some excellent returns given his offensive upside and age. If Ottawa re-signs him I'd argue it's more along the lines of 3-4 years given that they don't really have anyone who can replace him offensively at the moment, which was pretty apparent when he moved down the line-up.  ALEX CHIASSON 1-way, 2 years, AAV $1.5-1.75m  Salary comparables for 2015-16 season: Fehr, Moore, Santorelli, Lewis, Dorsett  He definitely didn't show much promise in his first season as an Ottawa Senator, but it was also only his second year as a pro for Alex Chiasson. I doubt he ends up being anything more than a 3rd-liner at this point, which is why Ottawa will likely only sign him to a short contract that takes him up to UFA status and then reassess. They might trade him, but it won't be for much, which is why I expect him to return to save some face on the Spezza trade. I wouldn't be shocked to see him left unsigned after this next contract, though, unless his production changes. He's probably the most replaceable player on this team, so they aren't going to open up their pocketbooks for him. He needs a short deal to prove his worth for his own sake as well.  J.G. PAGEAU 1-way, 3-4 years, AAV $2.5-2.75m  Salary comparables for 2015-16 season: O. Jokinen, B. Schenn, Boedker, Killorn, Niederreiter, Nielsen, Tatar  He played largely in a checking role at the NHL level but was almost a point-a-game player in the American League the last couple of seasons. He has a lot of obvious offensive flare coupled with some excellent defensive play, and is a valuable and well-liked member of the team. He's a lock to be re-signed, and I wouldn't be shocked if it were for more than people are expecting. Given some more maturation and regular NHL minutes I fully expect his production to increase quite a bit from his 0.38 points-per-game this season, even if that's in a 3rd-line role again. I agree here that it might be a shorter contract in order to keep his RFA status for his next contract (which might end being quite a raise), but I think he'll earn a bit more than expected."
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,TrulyMagnificient,6,Wed May 6 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"I really hope Hammond isn't signed at that value. I know he's a hometown hero but I'd trade JGP because I want Lazar at C, and I dont think either of them should be 4C. 1yr on Chiasson cause fuck did he suck after the first 10 or so games but I don't want to give up yet. Happily trade Hoff but the return needs to be good, I think we'd be selling high because while I think he's awesome and has some more upside, I don't know how long he'll be awesome for. Stone & Zibby are givens and should be staples of this team for a very long time to come."
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,PaddleDown,2,Wed May 6 19:31:23 2015 UTC,Agreed on most of these. Especially Stone and Zibanejad.. lock em up!
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,iJaysus,2,Wed May 6 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"If we (e.g. the organization) wants to keep him, that's what it's going to take because other suitors will offer him that much. Like I said, I think it depends on how the O'Connor situation plays out in part. He's another promising NHL prospect who's the same age as Lehner but a lot less hot headed and comes in with less stick swinging and glaring at defensemen. It could be a step back, it could be a sideways step (which is fine), or it could be a step forward long-term, we really don't know and can't know given the success of some netminders of late (e.g. Hammond, Lack, Darling, Dubnyk sort of but he always played on terrible teams). I'm not the kind of person to emotionally cling to players (not that I wouldn't be sad to see certain ones go, Pageau included), and I understand the potential value Pageau has on the trade market. That said, I think it's worth re-signing him and seeing how one of them can do on the wing to add some proven value to a promising prospect before moving him. Unless someone offers something ridiculous. At least you don't want to give up on him yet. Expectations in check, but also I wish people would understand he's a second year pro on his second team in two years. He wasn't coming in here to be Jason Spezza, and there's no real reason to ever believe he was. Exactly; and, Exactly. Can't wait to see what this team looks like when it's core gets to an average age that's more than about 25 (with Legwand and Phillips excluded)."
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,walahiguy,3,Wed May 6 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think? Obviously the main four are Zibanejad, Hoffman, Stone and Pageau. How far off am I?  Included a few of the minor guys.. should be an interesting off-season of negotiating for B. Murray and crew."
OttawaSenators,34zmjf,iJaysus,2,Tue May 5 21:48:15 2015 UTC,"Personally I think stone zib and Hoffman are the closest to a sure thing to get resigned (Hoffman due to arb). The other roster players from last year that are UFAs seem to be up in the air based on which direction GMBM and co decide to go with things (Tapping the UFA market vs. keeping things similar).   I haven't watched any AHL games but I get the impression from this article and other sources that other than a couple guys (puempel, prince, maybe wideman) there isn't much to be excited about.   My gut says we keep zib stone pageau and find room for condra, sign Hoffman and deal him and/or anderson for a forward+pick and are forced to keep chiasson/other bad contracts/players unless a team is desperate enough to take em off our hands.   That being said, I'd really like to know anyone's thoughts on any AHL players who might be able to crack a roster spot next year and make an impact, since my knowledge is limited in that area"
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,scienceguy98,15,Tue May 5 13:14:44 2015 UTC,This whole goalie question makes me super nervous.  I honestly can't say who the best guy to let go is.
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,chumpawumpa69,10,Tue May 5 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"Am I alone in thinking Hammond should clearly be in the minors?  If anything he's a slight bit of insurance if Lehner never plays hockey again, do we really think Lehner's injury is that serious?"
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,FixedTheNewelPost,11,Tue May 5 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"If he can't even ride a stationary bike without symptoms this far into his ""recovery"" then yes, I think it's safe to say it's serious."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,_bobbykelso,7,Tue May 5 16:58:58 2015 UTC,Lehner can ride stationary bikes in dark rooms for the next 3 years and still be younger and have more NHL experience than Hammond does today.
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,FixedTheNewelPost,15,Tue May 5 19:07:46 2015 UTC,That doesn't make him the better option ;)
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,peskysens,4,Tue May 5 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard and read his injury isn't career threatening, concussions are a whole other monster though...  I would much rather see Anderson dealt because there is a bigger reward there then if we deal Lehner. Anderson's stock has never been higher and we aren't projecting to be cup contenders next year(atleast at this point...) Lehner is young and has high upside if he can recover (I believe he'll be fine for next year.) Hopefully we can sign O'Connor and have him developing in Bingo while we resolve the issue in goal. I'm not particularly worried. Having many assets is good. I'm excited for next year and this off-season."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,CookingInTheKitchen,3,Tue May 5 18:00:52 2015 UTC,It's been almost 3 months and he still can't ride a bike without getting headaches.
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,FuckFuckittyFuck,4,Wed May 6 04:42:10 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think you're alone.  I really don't want to give up Lehner, and I'm really not keen on giving up Andy since he's the best goalie this franchise has ever had.    I think there's some hope that Hammond might sign a two-way.  There are a lot of goalies out there and I think after his playoff performance there might not be that many takers."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,chumpawumpa69,4,Tue May 5 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think that Hammond should be seriously considered, unless GMBM is going to swing for the fences in a deal involving Lehner."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,broomlad,7,Tue May 5 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that Hammond should be in the minors and also should be on a two-way deal. But the former won't happen because he would have to clear waivers first (right now he won't), and latter likely won't happen because because he's performed too well to not be offered a 1-way deal (if not by us, then by someone else in free agency)."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,Omega613,14,Tue May 5 17:23:06 2015 UTC,Please be a two-way.
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,jmgk,3,Tue May 5 15:12:54 2015 UTC,"While ideal, I don't think that will happen."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,broomlad,8,Tue May 5 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"This is a really tough decision, and I won't pretend like I know what's best.   I just hope Murray makes the right choice on who to keep."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,Stinky-pickle,7,Tue May 5 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"I don't want to give up on Lehner, but depending on his injury there is a chance he may not play (part of?) next year. If he has serious concussion issues it's not something that can be taken lightly.   Hammond had a great (let's say) 30 games. But he is still vastly unproven. He did a great thing for Ottawa, and I hope it leads to him getting a decent deal. I am not sure how all the contract stuff works, in regards to send down and callups, I am not sure two-way or not if we can even call him up and send him down without Waivers. So that is the gamble.   If we can package Lehner and land a solid top player (Eberle etc) I can live with it. If we move Lehner for a pick I will be upset.   Something else we all haven't considered is, does Lehner want to stay in Ottawa. He has shown frustration a lot this season, he was mishandled greatly by MacLean and cut short once we entered the Cameron era. It is possible that he has expressed desire for more start time that Ottawa isn't willing to give and a team like EDM/BUF etc is."

OttawaSenators,34xrsy,matty323,1 point,Tue May 5 13:57:35 2015 UTC,Why all the Hammond hate?   Didn't he prove with 2 regulation losses in 24 games that he isn't a minor league goalie?  Didn't he prove with 3 career shutouts in 24 games that he is at least better than Lehner?  Hammond played excellently and I couldn't careless that his road to the top was rockey and Lehner's was cushy. The fact is Hammond is the star goalie of the future and Lehner is not.
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,JohnnyPoster,3,Tue May 5 20:55:33 2015 UTC,"Love Hammond, think he deserves a CHANCE.  I don't know if he'll be as amazing as he'll probably regress to a backup for the rest of his career, not sure his stats are anything close to sustainable. But who knows.  Maybe he just needed NHL calibre players with and against him to shine, one of those types that plays to the level they are needed to.  He looks extremely calm in net, maybe not to the level of Carey Price, but definitely a 'veteran' look, which is odd considering his NHL experience.    I think he's earned a few chances, but if he comes in and sucks donkey dick like he did the entire season in the AHL I wouldn't be afraid to ditch him post haste, and someone would pick him up off waivers or take a flyer on a trade so it's not like a decent contract would fuck the sens."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,TrulyMagnificient,3,Wed May 6 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Exhibit A  There's a long history of NHL goalies playing above their heads for a season.  I'm not denying that Hammond had a good run - I just don't know if he's capable of that on a regular basis.  I think he makes for a great back-up goalie in the NHL - I do think that he's reliable enough to give a starter a few nights off here and there.    I absolutely don't think that Hammond is the ""star goalie of the future"".  You're right that we don't know what we have in Lehner, but neither do we know what we have in Hammond."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,broomlad,5,Wed May 6 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"You're right in that we can't take away what he accomplished for the Sens this spring, but it was a very small sample size. I don't see this as hate directed at Hammond so much as people wanting to approach the situation with caution. Up until 2 months ago we've been told that Lehner is the goalie of the future, and that the organization lacks goaltending depth outside of he and Anderson. Hammond certainly puts that line of thinking into question, but in no way can it be said that he is definitely better than Lehner going forward, only that he was better than Lehner over a 30(ish) game stretch."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,freisenburger,0,Tue May 5 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"The fact is he won a job. Lehners been constantly given chances and blown it .  Also with my shutout stat , Hammond has 3 career shutouts to lehners 2.  The fact management says lehner is the goalie of the future would only suggest that Hammond is a star. The fact is they were so wrong on lehner clearly they can be just as wrong assuming Hammond was a minor leaguer .  Importantly Hammond had great nhl stats and 25 games is a small but actually sizeable sample.  25 games is certainly more than 10. I think 25 is enough for me to judge . the fact is he won like 6 more games than andy showing that he did indeed play a lot of games . Plus Hammond passed the eye test. He looks great in net. Lehner never did"
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,JohnnyPoster,3,Wed May 6 05:36:03 2015 UTC,Plus Hammond passed the eye test. He looks great in net. Lehner never did   Correction: Hammond passed / Lehner failed your eye test.  It's clear from your comments how you feel about both goalies so I won't bother arguing one way or the other with you from here on out.
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,broomlad,1 point,Wed May 6 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"Hammond proved himself to me.   At some point all the talk of ""goalie of the future"" for Lehner has to result in clutch wins, and we haven't seen that.   I like the team having depth at goal, but I don't know how to manage the roster and salaries. If Lehner had any trade value, I'd explore that, but until he's healthy the value is nil."
OttawaSenators,34xrsy,thwump,-2,Wed May 6 00:06:47 2015 UTC,Go for a long term deal Hammy!

OttawaSenators,34vwxt,canuck_11,4,Tue May 5 00:18:59 2015 UTC,That's a fairly strong assumption. Melnyk has said he will spend. There are so many teams in cap trouble teams out there that we have a good chance at landing some UFAs if we want.

OttawaSenators,34vwxt,jamishthegreat,2,Tue May 5 03:43:36 2015 UTC,Murray did say they wouldn't be a cap team. I think it will be a pretty big accomplishment to keep their Game 6 lineup and get under $67m

OttawaSenators,34vwxt,Boonedoggle,3,Tue May 5 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"Some people are making some pretty ridiculous claims in regards to us clearing space. It's not as simple as ""just trading"" some of the bigger burdens like Legwand and Greening... nobody even took Greening on waivers. Phillips is expected to return to the line-up next year and wants to be here, and so he will be. Neil might accept a trade elsewhere, but he also has stated he wants to be here, and he's probably got more value than any of Gryba, Phillips, Greening, and Legwand. I'm sure Legwand will be moved but it isn't going to be for much, but it may allow for the resigning of the likes of Condra. I can see Hoffman being traded because of his success and arbitration rights, Stone, Zibanead, and Pageau will be resigned regardless of internal budget, and Hammond will likely test the waters but sign a fair offer.   Chiasson is also likely to be resigned because while it was a down year, it was only his second year of pro. Granted, he's not projected to be anything higher than a moderate 3rd-liner at the time being. If Hammond resigns I wouldn't be shocked if Lehner is moved. I also wouldn't be surprised if Cowen remains with the team until at least the trade deadline if not longer, as the team has invested a lot of time into his development and is not likely to just toss him away."
OttawaSenators,34vwxt,PaddleDown,1 point,Tue May 5 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"Is Phillips realistically going to come back? He's a 37 year old stay-at-home D. He just underwent major back surgery, Cameron doesn't seem to like him much, and let's be honest, he's just not that good anymore.. I can't imagine that game vs WSH not being his last."
OttawaSenators,34vwxt,CatoDarpa,1 point,Tue May 5 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's unrealistic to say Cameron doesn't seem to like him much, he barely played under him; and while his ice time was down, he was also playing through injury. Is it a for sure thing that he'll return? Of course not. But I've also said in the past that if he wants to return he'll be welcomed back into the line-up in what would likely be a 6/7 role. If it's between Gryba and Phillips, I prefer Phillips in a 6 role. That said, we need a more mobile partner beside Boro, and long-term neither of those guys really make much sense. (And yes, I am also saying that Boro is essentially a 5-lock for next year.)"
OttawaSenators,34vwxt,bobartlarry,1 point,Wed May 6 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. You need value to get value. No one's gonna take those bad contracts unless we bait them with 1st/2nd round picks. Cap space is a valuable commodity though, and teams aren't going to be dumb enough to pick up dead weight players at a 2-3 mil cap hit. Kind of why I think anderson/Hoffman might be our best trade prospects. Unfortunately those other guys are probably stuck unless we get desperate and give up some of our future picks"
OttawaSenators,34vwxt,TrulyMagnificient,1 point,Wed May 6 01:49:20 2015 UTC,"No team will trade their top scoring forward unless they plan a rebuild. Which Ottawa isnt. Hoff isnt going anywhere as long as he doesnt ask for something absurd.   Lehner might be moved, and almost certainly will be if Matt O'Conner picks us. But I doubt he moves until the trade deadline because of his injury, it gives time to see if Hammond is worth it.   Legwand will be gone, Cowen probably goes. Neil's cap hit isnt that bad so I wouldnt mind seeing him stay. I think he has value. Gyrba likely is gone, Phillips I have my doubts but we'll see.   Plus that was the internal cap. Not the NHL cap, we could realistically sign everyone and still be fine."

Trade is the best option (but who wants him and that contract, maybe contract split?)  Worst comes worse send him to bingo and help the farm."
OttawaSenators,34vwxt,Lemondish,1 point,Tue May 5 03:50:40 2015 UTC,"It depends more on what the organization wants to do... in this case it could make sense to buy him out. While his cap hit would extend from 2 to 4 years, it would only be for about $1.8-2m/season (66% of his salary in a given year). This team is not likely to spend anywhere near the cap in that window, so that isn't an issue. They would save around $0.9-1m a year in salary by buying him out, which they could use toward a current UFA/RFA... money which can make the difference between a player re-signing and not re-signing. Given the exodus of players from Bingo to Ottawa, they aren't in a position to win where Greening could really be of much help. Better to keep growing from within down there, sign a couple guys for $40-50k contracts if needed and promote up the line-up, and let Greening try to reignite his career in Europe."

OttawaSenators,34sict,AskMeIfImAHuman,9,Mon May 4 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not interested in any blockbuster trades. I don't feel we have enough high-end talent to pull that off without crippling our depth at another position. Also, while a ""top-4 dman"" would be great, the market demand is ludicrous right now and any big names will become far too pricey (either in free agency or in trade). I want low-key moves that are aimed to streamline our current roster, and any players who are shipped out I want picks or (where possible) young prospects that aren't quite NHL ready yet but could perhaps jump right into our depleted AHL roster. I like our current roster for the most part going into next season, and in the immediate future we just need to focus on development. Next off season might be time to better identify our weaknesses as young players begin to settle and be more aggressive in our attempt to address any issues. (Oh, and Hall/RNH won't be available, guaranteed. Eberle/Yakupov could be for the right price, but I'm not convinced we could meet their demands even then)   Find a middle-pairing quality dman, ideally who's good for shot suppression and/or puck movement (rather than offense, for example). I'm talking someone similar in skill level to Petry, Hjalmersson, Coburn, or Franson, (but cheaper and more ""available"" than most of those examples) perhaps even a little less skilled/well-known. We don't necessarily need another star at the position, and we likely can't afford one right now in terms of trade/salary - I'm looking for a MacArthur type signing (or trade) where they're brought in for relatively cheap (because other teams are too busy bidding for the bigger names) and then the player thrives in a new environment. But that player can either reinforce our bottom pair with one of Boro/Wideman, or displace Wier or Ceci (positionally dependent) if one of them is struggling, which should help insulate them and ease their development. Sign the player for ~2 years, hopefully in the neighboourhood of $2.5-3.0M. I won't name names though, since I don't honestly know who's available/feasible right now (and again, like the MacArthur deal, the ideal candidate will likely be someone that we wouldn't realize until after the fact). Re-sign Zbad (~$2.5M), Hoff (~3.0M), Stone (~$2.5M), Pageau (~$1.25M), Condra (~$1.75M), Grant ($1M, 2-way?), and Wideman (~$1M, 1-way?) where bracketed salaries would be ideal and semi-realistic in my mind, each for 2-3 years terms. Chiasson I would be okay re-signing, but preferably for <$1.5M and for 1 year, mainly on the basis that we're thin on depth RWs and I'm not confident we could find a direct/better replacement on the market. If he puts in the work with our off-season trainers, perhaps they can mould him into a more defensive bottom-6 guy with decent offensive upside. But I also wouldn't be hurt if we offered him for trade either (given his size and age, I know some team will overvalue him.) If there aren't any great deals out there for Smith, I would be okay holding onto him. He's not amazing, but he's also not bad in a sheltered 4th line role, especially if we can surround him with some more talent and have him form some chemistry. I like that he's positionally versatile (LW/C), and moderately inexpensive ($1.887M). Also, his physicality and NHL experience (>300 games, despite his age) would help shelter a LW like Prince/Puempel if either were on the roster. Trade: Cowen, Gryba, Greening for sure. Greening get whatever you can get, at this point the salary space is the main return for us and his value is so low. Gryba is a serviceable bottom pair guy who could actually do well for the right team with the right needs, but we've already got Boro who's a better shutdown guy, loyal (Ottawa native), leaderly (captained Binghamton), a part-time enforcer with some skill to back it up, and is on a good contract. I think we could salvage Gryba's draft pick back by getting a 3rd-5th rounder or equivalent prospect(s). Cowen I want gone, I've given up on him despite trying so hard not to disalike him at the start of the season. He's just not panning out, and although he might improve I think a change of scenery is the only thing that will spark that development. Every day we have him (playing or scratched) his value goes down. That said, given his draft pedigree, age, and size, I fully expect Murray to play hardball in trade negotiations and rightly so. We'll never recoup a 9th overall for him, but a high-ish 2nd rounder (or equivalent prospect) doesn't seem impossible with the right trade partner. Trading all 3 will likely be a challenge, but at least 2/3 of these players would be satisfactory to start in my opinion. Also, trade one of Michalek and Legwand, primarily for salary reasons, but a secondary advantage would be that it opens some room in the depth chart to promote one of Puempel/Prince/Grant. Legwand is perfectly serviceable as a 4th line C despite criticism, but I firmly believe Smith can do roughly similar work for less cap hit, and also that Grant has potential to do an even better job for half the price if given the opportunity. Legwand was brought in to play a middle-6 C role, and was paid accordingly, but his demotion to the 4th line makes him overpaid. Milo is obviously a great versatile depth guy who can reliably step into a top-6 role as needed. I've also heard Milo is very good off the ice (professional, very hard worker and looked highly upon by younger guys), based on some of Cameron's remarks. But again, he's overpaid for playing a bottom-6 role most nights, and having two guys overpaid so badly is causing some issues. I would prefer to keep Milo of the two, but his trade interest would be higher and Legwand's NTC might be an issue, so we'll see what happens. I don't know what to do with/about Neil. Heart says keep him and/or desperately try to convince him to retire (doubtful), but brain says trade him since we have better 13th forwards available, let alone regular roster players. Phillips isn't going anywhere by the look/sounds of it, but if he's basically a press box warmer (7th/8th dman) then ""whatever"". Anything but a trade still forces us to swallow his salary/cap hit, so we're mostly screwed (esp. since he also has an NTC). However him retiring seems even more imperative than Neil, if only to clear up a spot on the 23 man roster limit. And the goalies... sigh... I don't know any more. It seems contentious to say right now, but I actually wouldn't be too upset with Hammond being allowed to walk and/or shopping around his UFA rights for a late round pick before July 1st, but Murray seems keen to at least offer him a deal. Lehner still has huge upside despite a poor season and many fans turning on him. This season's performance and worries over his recent concussion have likely destroyed most of his trade value, so I do not want to see him traded (on top of wanting to see him given more time to develop/prove himself for us). So if Hammond is re-signed, we either roll into next season with 3 goalies (which would likely be temporary), or we could look to trade Anderson. Andy would likely have the highest trade value, and would clear up a good chunk of cap space as a nice bonus, but he's also given us the most stable goaltending we've had in about a decade prior to his arrival, and I'm not yet sure how confident I would be rolling with just Lehner+Hammond. Unless the return would be huge for Anderson (or a package involving him), I don't want to see him go. In my mind, I keep arriving at the conclusion that Hammond needs to be the odd one out, but I have no clue how to handle the situation in all honesty."
OttawaSenators,34sict,Omega613,3,Mon May 4 06:27:48 2015 UTC,"Gryba is a serviceable bottom pair guy who could actually do well for the right team with the right needs, but we've already got Boro who's a better shutdown guy, loyal (Ottawa native), leaderly (captained Binghamton), a part-time enforcer with some skill to back it up, and is on a good contract. I think we could salvage Gryba's draft pick back by getting a 3rd-5th rounder or equivalent prospect(s).   Omega, you know I'm your biggest fan, but that's really not a good reason to let Gryba go. I've watched games focusing on the bottom-pairing. Borowiecki has shown he's got decent puck-handling skills, and Gryba is good when he's playing with confidence. They've got 23 points between them, and I know that plus/minus isn't the greatest stat, but they're a combined +26. That's got to count for something, and I'd really like to think that guys performing as expected, especially if they're homegrown, should count for something.   I'm looking for a MacArthur type signing   As far as UFAs go, I wonder where guys like Joel Ward or Frolik would fit in the lineup."
OttawaSenators,34sict,as_hagi,2,Mon May 4 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"Hey you know what, I don't disagree. That pairing, while overall below average to my eyes, was better than the sum of their parts, and in terms of the Sens ""using what you've got"" that pairing did well. And on top of what you listed, I think one of their best accomplishments was on the penalty kill, since they played a big role and the Sens were solid this year in that regard (82.9%, 11th best in the league). And to people who think simply getting rid of him or Cowen or Chiasson, etc., for ""a bag of pucks"" (or equivalently poor return) is a good idea - it's not. That's terrible asset management. Using Gryba as an example, he was a 3rd round pick that's become a legitimate bottom pairing NHL defensemen. Most 3rd round picks don't make it to the NHL (I don't have the numbers handy, but something 20-30% playi n the NHL, and ~10% will ever play more than 100 games) - so he was tremendously successful, and even getting a 3rd rounder back would technically mean we lost out in the long run, especially once you factor in all the time/money spent to develop him. There have to be other benefits (better return, cap/roster relief, opening a spot for a promising rookie, etc.) to justify getting even a 3rd for him, let alone less than that. But that's a bit of a side tangent :P  To elaborate, here's my issue. As is common to see with defensive pairings, one player assumes a role nearer to the ""stay-at-home"" model, while the other becomes more of a ""puck-mover"" who typically clears the zone and directs the puck up ice where possible (using speed, passing, IQ, or whatever assets they might possess). EK+Methot is an extreme example of this role delegation, and I doubt it needs explaining. With the Boro/Gryba pairing, Boro has taken the SOH role, while Gryba uses his above average skating ability (one of his best assets) to be a puck mover, and that's reflected in their stats over an 82 game pace: blocked shots (B:132, G:63), hits (B:303, G:187), giveaways (B:27, G:44), CrosiFor%(B:46%, G:47%), etc.. All differences you would expect to see given their respective roles.  But the real problem, to my eye/knowledge, is that each have very similar skill sets, more specifically both should really be playing the shut-down type role on a 3rd pairing. Both are physical, shot-blocking, shot suppression type guys, and both could use a better puck moving partner (neither are particular adept at passing, neither have particularly high hockey IQ, neither are fast). In fact, they make one another worse, at least in terms of possession metrics:   Boro with Gryba: 44.53% Boro without Gryba: 47.80% Gryba without Boro: 49.04%   So they're not great together, they don't have complimentary skill sets, and neither are good enough to bump up to the 2nd pairing. On top of that, when I look at our lineup and where improvement can be made, one thing to consider is goals and shots. If we look over the ~55 games this season where Cameron was or HC (for all teams):   Ottawa goals-for: 2.98/gm, 5th best in the league Ottawa goals-against: 2.47/gm, 9th best in the league Ottawa shots-for: 32.0/gm, 6th best in the league Ottawa shots-against: 31.0/gm, 24th best in the league   Overall, we did well in these categories. However our shots-against indicates that we likely definitely benefited from good goaltending, which helped our goals-against. On the whole, when I look at those numbers, it tells me that our offense is actually very good (and the young talent we game may yet improve further!), but our defensive game is lacking. Defensively, our forwards largely consist of two-way players who willingly backcheck, so it leads me to believe that our defensive struggles originate from the blueline, and so I can't help but look at that bottom-pairing as containing the most replaceable condidates, and I listed in my above post some reasons why I think Boro is the better of the two to keep around (combined with the stats I posted above in this post, and the fact that Boro was a rookie this season, so the extra year of experience might help him boost his abilities ever so slightly going forward). I also think Boro is a rarer/less replaceable player. See, there are plenty of bottom pairing, large, physical players who do a serviceable/adequate job like Gryba, but there aren't a lot of enforcers who also possess a good skillset for their position (it's like Neil in his prime vs. John Scott in his prime - both can punch people quite well, but only one can also reliably put up points and deserved a roster spot even without the enforcer qualities).  And in my opinion, keeping Gryba as a replacement ""7th"" guy would be fine, except that we're already paying (and using a roster spot) to keep Phillips around, begrudgingly. Gryba, despite his manageable cap hit, suddenly becomes cap/roster fodder for us. In fact, a well stocked team in cap trouble might look to exchange a more skilled blueliner for Gryba (and likely picks/prospects) to maintain their overall roster and clear the cap. We ran with 8 dmen this season which wasn't ideal, and I would expect that Wideman is looking for a 1-way contract or else he leaves, which would further complicate things. And to lose the AHL's Norris equivalent winner for nothing would be terrible, especially if he might be exactly the player that our 3rd pairing needs with Boro to move pucks and generate some offense (in the event that we can't source a more established option).   Now it's important I mention the fact that in spite of a different view at the start of the season, I now like Boro as a person/player, so I'm not writing this free from bias. But I do feel Gryba could be pushed out for a small upgrade, and we would be better off. Whether that upgrade comes in the form of Wideman, a trade target, or free agent signing is highly debatable, but I think despite his upside, Gryba is no longer a player we benefit fully from having.  (And with regard to your closing point re: Ward/Frolik, either could be decent additions, but in case it wasn't clear my MacArthur example was meant to refer to a blueline equivalent to that signing.)"

If the Sens luck into a better bottom pairing than Gryba-Boro, I'm feeling pretty happy. I'd be totally happy with trading away those contracts to make room for better players. Not as big a deal as getting some other contracts off the books, but the little things add up."

Also I'd still hope the Sens fix up their D instead of signing a UFA F. They just don't need the help as much at forward."
OttawaSenators,34sict,mike-kt,2,Mon May 4 14:26:21 2015 UTC,"Love it.   I agree that the biggest thing the Sens can do this summer is clear space on the roster and salary cap. If they are able to simply bring back the lineup they had for game 6 that's a huge success.   If they can clear enough additional room to sign a young UFA defender that would be great. I don't think prices for UFAs will be astronomical. There are a fair number of available D, and the cap is going to be between $68m and $71m, that doesn't leave a lot of teams with room for expensive UFAs. The Sens could be competative if they're somehow able to free up the space.  I think the only way out for Greening is a buyout. No one wanted him off waivers and we were told a long long time ago that his agent was free to canvas other teams for a trade.   I took a look through the RFAs on cap-tight teams, but I don't think there are many defenseman available for $3.5m (where the compensation is a 2nd rounder in 2016-17)."
OttawaSenators,34sict,mike-kt,2,Mon May 4 14:09:09 2015 UTC,"I took a look through the RFAs on cap-tight teams, but I don't think there are many defenseman available for $3.5m (where the compensation is a 2nd rounder in 2016-17).   Now there's something I hadn't considered. Interesting point. Shame no obvious answers stood out to you, but still plausible. It would likely be tough (and highly unlikely), but I wonder if Boston can handle re-signing Hamilton given their cap space and only having a handful of low salary expiring UFAs (plus the raises to Krejci, Krug and Smith incoming).  Another possibility, and one I know very little about, is signing a KHL player who's looking to make it into the NHL. It's been rumoured to happen, and before the off season has even started we're already seeing a trickle of players (Moses to Nashville, Panarin to Chicago). They would likely be cheap, on the basis that they are new to the NHL and we're not giving up any assets, and have potentially good upside. I don't know how many players we can expect to see, let alone defensemen, but it could be a great source."
OttawaSenators,34sict,Omega613,2,Mon May 4 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of RFA D  You're right in thinking Hamilton is the best on there, but he's so good that $3.5m isn't enough to offer sheet him. If he were a straight free agent I'd go for $5m, but to give up a 1st and 3rd pick the following year is a tough pill. Boston is at $62.8m for next year, but that includes Savard's cap hit. Once he's on LTIR they have $58.8m and that's a lot of room for them to fill 7 roster spots.    Beaulieu, Dillon, Smith and Cole would be worth a $3.5m or under offer sheet, but the habs, sharks, wings and penguins will likely try to keep them. Worth the effort maybe."
OttawaSenators,34sict,mike-kt,1 point,Mon May 4 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Boston is at $62.8m for next year   Where do you get that figure, just out of curiosity? I've ignored the salaries of their 5 UFAs (Campbell, Paille, Soderberg, McQuaid, Bartkowski), and included their 4 RFA salaries (Spooner, $0.725M; Connolly, $0.851M; Hamilton, $0.833; Svedberg, $0.600M) on the basis that they will all be re-signed for at least that much or be necessarily replaced by an equivalent/greater salary. That leaves them with 11 forwards, 6 dmen, and 2 goalies (all minimum required, with exception for needed 1 more forward) and $72.183M in salary tied up.  Edit: Before even posting this, I must've made an error in excel - still not sure where. I now get a total salary of $63.282 (excluding Savard), which is much more in line with what you found too. Although having 4 RFAs (all important, all likely due for a moderate/big raise) and still needing at least 1 more forward, they are in a small bind. Doubly so if you include the fact that their low-end/depth players are largely unestablished in the NHL and may require replacing/supplementing with more expensive players (and/or they're left without any extra players in case of sudden injury). But definitely less problematic than I originally believed, so perhaps Boston won't be as much of an offer sheet target as believed, but I'll leave my figures below regardless.  From NHLnumbers.com, here are my figures from largest to smallest (sorted by position) in case you know where I may have made an error: Forwards:     Krejci $7.25M Bergeron $6.5M Lucic $6M Marchand $4.5M Eriksson $4.25M Smith $3.425M Kelly $3M Pastrnak $0.925M Talbot $0.875M Spooner $0.87M (RFA) Connolly $0.851M (RFA)   Defensemen:   Chara $6.917M Seidenberg $4.00M Krug $3.4M Hamilton $1.494M (RFA) Miller $0.800M Trotman $0.625M   Goalies:   Rask $7.00M Svedberg $600K (RFA)"
OttawaSenators,34sict,Omega613,2,Mon May 4 22:08:45 2015 UTC,"I think they can give their RFAs decent raises without hurting their cap. I would certainly offer Hamilton $3.5m and force Boston to match. If Hamilton signs for less it's a sign GMs simply don't want to use all the tools available to them for fear of hurting feelings.   With the KHL in serious financial trouble, a team with decent scouting could find some real value for the bottom of their lineup there."
OttawaSenators,34sict,mike-kt,2,Tue May 5 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"Do you guys have the cap space to keep all 3? We are probably trading during next season but Chicago has rolled 3 pretty good goalies through the entire season this year (crow, darling, raanta)"
OttawaSenators,34sict,ChrisAshtear,1 point,Tue May 5 03:46:17 2015 UTC,"That's precisely what I'm wondering. The focus is of course on which 2 of 3 would be kept around, but it seems plausible to roll all three, at least to start the year. If fears about Lehner persist, or emerge for either Hammond/Anderson, then perhaps a deal could be reached mid/end of year (doubly so when inevitably a team has goalie injury problems and decides to look for something more than just a quick fix).   If our alleged ""internal cap"" proves real, then yes that might become an issue unless we successfully clear almost all of our unnecessary contracts/cap commitments. The league cap (~$70M-71M) shouldn't be too big of an obstacle so long os our RFA contracts aren't too high, since clearing several players (necessarily) will clear a little bit more cap room. But otherwise, I currently project the bigger issue to be the 23-man roster limit during the regular season. Our roster, as of the playoffs and ignoring the AHL call ups, had 26 players on it and there are (potentially) 2-3 AHL guys that might demand 1-way contracts next season. Acquiring anyone new would further compound this problem.  I suspect even without any blockbuster moves, this summer may prove to be very interesting and active for the Sens :P"

If he wants to keep playing after that, his best bet would be to move to another team that has a spot for him right now in hopes that they'll sign him to an extension rather than hoping he can get a new contract after the season when nothing is guaranteed, and teams will likely be focusing on more pressing issues than fourth line wingers."

OttawaSenators,34sict,sgtenders,0,Mon May 4 04:45:55 2015 UTC,"Re-sign the core.      Zibby, Hoff, Stone and Pageau for sure, with Hammer/Chiasson getting an offer as well. Condra isn't resigning unless some contracts get taken off our books.      Dump the dead weight.     I really like Smith in the 4th line role. Wouldn't mind seeing him stay with the Sens for the money he's making. Legwand and Gryba are on the chopping block. Cowen is tough, I still believe he can be a 2nd pairing dman, but good god was he awful down the stretch. I'd say test the market and if nothing floats your boat then keep him. Finally, Phillips and Neiler... please retire... I love them, but they aren't doing much other then collecting a paycheck at this point. GMBM said he wasn't going to trade them but I would take anything I could get for them.     Sort out the goalies.     This situation is so interesting. If we get O'Connor, that opens a lot of doors. I think GMBM sees Lehner as the goaltender on the outside looking in, but being shut down with that concussion has really lowered his value. Where as Andy's value has never been higher. It's tough, but I'm not giving up on Lehner. He's too young. It's not like they're going to win a cup next year. Trade Andy to Edmonton. Keep the Hammond/Lehner tandem and hope we get Matt O'Connor.     Draft well.      Well, DUUUUUUH.     Sign a top 4 dman.     If Cowen gets traded include him in a package deal with a goaltender amd other pieces to Edmonton for one of their top players. Otherwise, I'm hoping Cowen can be our 2nd pairing dman. Or take a look at teams that have cap issues and go after their dmen and blow Cowen up lol.     Blockbuster trade.      That could be cool. Cowen+goalie=???   I'm pretty interested in seeing what happens this off-season. Very excited for this team moving forward!"

There's also a bunch of young players maturing, which can't be directly attributed to Cameron. Methot coming back, Hammond coming up, Weircoch ending hot, etc-- his influence is minimal.  The two things that I think made a huge difference were 1.) Sometimes a change is all a team needs. Consider both the early success of Clousten and then MacLean after him. With Cameron, we've yet to see if he's a great coach long-term; 2.) Cameron, at least according to some players, worked them harder than MacLean did."

But since I'm sure this is New York's year to go all the way, Ovie won't last much longer than Mtl.    So I guess I'm not sure.  All my teams are either already out, or will be out this round.  And the only thing I had left was cheering for someone to curb-stomp the dirty Habs.  That ends this round, so I'll probably just stop watching until next year.  I will add though, that much like other Sens fans, I do have a soft spot for the Wild.  I just don't unfortunately see them beating Chicago in a best of 7."

OttawaSenators,34ewly,t0t0zenerd,6,Thu Apr 30 16:04:13 2015 UTC,"I have been to three games in the supporters section, all at the beginning of the season. I have gone to 13 games total this year. With that said, I have some random thoughts:   The atmosphere has definitely changed. CTC has been a notorious dead zone for cheering but I found that any night that was a Supporters Section night had much more energy. Even if you weren't chanting yourself, you could hear the chants and the simpler ones always caught on around the full rink. Every person I've brought to a game this year loved listening to the chants, and seeing all the fans on the big screen.  I am happy they are expanding the section next year. I think it gives another option for all the different types of fans we have. I didn't buy season tickets in the section, because it's not for everyone and not all of the people I bring to games will enjoy it. As for improving it, the group running it (Red Scarf Union) itself is still finding its feet. It's pretty poorly organized and every game is plagued by some sort of drama (opponents jerseys in the section, people wouldn't stand, someone got too drunk, scalpers reselling to take advantage of low ticket prices) that ultimately distracts from the game, however they seem to have made improvements over the season.   To sum it up, the section was very popular within the type of fan that was looking for this type of experience - loud, high energy, meet new people, a lot of beer vendors stopped by :) By the end of the season the Sens Organization were adding more Supporter Games and those games in 319 were all selling out. Getting a playoff ticket in that section was near impossible.  This is still Ottawa though. As evidenced in the other comments in the thread this will never catch on for the full arena."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,wordsNtricks,2,Thu Apr 30 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"I actually think for a first year the RSU did a decent job at flagging scalpers, moving away team fans, and coordinating with the Sens sales and promotion teams. Fans who get too drunk are an issue at times, but it often is during any sporting event. But, there's definitely plenty of room for improvement! I'll be in 312 next year for every game I go to!"
OttawaSenators,34ewly,00antho,8,Fri May 1 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"They're bringing it back next season to a bigger section.   Personally,  I get dragged into it a lot by a friend of mine,  but I'm not the biggest fan  just because I find it's the opposite extreme.  I have slight back issues,  so awkwardly standing in a space where I just barely fit gets really sore really quickly.  So I'll stand when I can, I'll cheer a fuckton,  but I often yelled at when I'm not standing."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,Cogeno,3,Thu Apr 30 16:18:44 2015 UTC,"I also enjoy watching/concentrating on what's going on on the ice. Kind of hard to do so when you're standing and screaming shit.   I enjoy having the section there, but I wouldn't want to be in it."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,Stinky-pickle,3,Thu Apr 30 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"All my tickets are in the Supporter section and I love it. I'm not crazy about the RSU, but I'll piggy back on their passion and support all the best parts."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,mike-kt,4,Fri May 1 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"they dont need to stand, but i like having the supporters section.  Personally i think the team should commit to the first 4 rows behind the visitors bench being up ot a raffle to ""hardcore"" sens fans. However that could be defined."

OttawaSenators,34ewly,corneliusvanDB,2,Thu Apr 30 22:52:35 2015 UTC,Minus the shit getting set on fire.
OttawaSenators,34ewly,Stinky-pickle,3,Fri May 1 04:44:45 2015 UTC,"I love it. I've been thrown out of games before for being loud and obnoxious. On one hand, I don't blame them, like on ""family night"" what family of grandma and grandpa with the grandkids wants to sit behind someone who's gonna cheer and yell and chirp the refs and potentially swear and spill beer all night?   On the other hand, it's a fucking hockey game.  Anyway, I find it refreshing to be ""seated"" with other actual fans, who aren't embarrassed by loud noises and unabashed cheering. In many ways, Ottawa is a sleepy quiet town of government workers who are afraid of a commotion. The fanbase suffers from this stereotype, out-of-town fans often give us shit for having the ""Quietest arena in the league"". Not anymore, with the fan section.  And standing isn't bad, it's great! I can hardly sit half the time anyway, I'm always jumping up in anticipation when it looks like a goal is coming, and I don't want to block the people behind me.  I have always said, if they have a Coca Cola No Alcohol Section, they should have a 19+ section where fans can be loud and drink openly, and say ""Fuck"" when the other team scores.  I don't want to ruin the experience for other people, so I do watch my language and behaviour, and try to stay seated in a sitting section. But I'm tired of that. I want to stand, I want to yell, I want to sing and chant for my team."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,corneliusvanDB,6,Thu Apr 30 21:11:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, except for classifying these types of fans as 'actual fans.' Sitting and enjoying the game without drinking and chanting doesn't make you any less of a fan - some of the most hardcore hockey fans I know just like to sit and take it in."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,wordsNtricks,-11,Thu Apr 30 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"Sitting quietly at a hockey game is the exact opposite of a fan. The word fan is derived from ""fanatic"". If you sit quietly and don't cheer the team in the arena, you are simply someone who enjoys watching hockey, not a true fan.  The players need, and want, to know that the people in attendance support them. They want to hear the chants, the shouts, the energy. That's what gives us home-ice advantage. A quiet arena robs them of confidence and energy.  It's hockey, not golf."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,corneliusvanDB,7,Thu Apr 30 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree, don't limit it like that. There are 20k seats in that arena, plenty of room for everyone."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,mike-kt,1 point,Fri May 1 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"I never limited anything. I never said people who wanted to be quiet weren't welcome. It's a free country, and a quiet seat is better than an empty seat. I'm just pointing out the difference between a fan and a passive spectator."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,corneliusvanDB,2,Fri May 1 06:59:01 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean, fans can be quiet."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,mike-kt,6,Fri May 1 12:32:24 2015 UTC,"I have 15+ Sens jerseys, follow the team on multiple road trips every season, never miss an away game in Buffalo, Detroit or Montreal, but rarely stand up, cheer or even clap.   Does this mean I'm not a true fan? I'd just prefer to take in the game or talk shop with friends."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,niwanyshyn,-3,Fri May 1 02:25:59 2015 UTC,"You don't cheer or clap? Yeesh... To each their own style of enjoying the game, but if you don't voice support, no, I don't think that's a fan in the true sense. Sorry :/  EDIT: buying jerseys and tickets only helps the team so much. You're helping Melnyk and Bettman, not the players."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,corneliusvanDB,0,Fri May 1 05:03:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it doesn't sound like you're much of an authority on any of this, and your opinion stinks, so I'll just keep doing what I'm doing."
OttawaSenators,34ewly,niwanyshyn,0,Sat May 2 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"You're just as little an ""authority"" as me, and I reciprocate your feelings on opinion.  You keep doing what you're doing, nobody's going to try to stop you. But for the love of the team, please, I implore you, rethink what you've said. Try, in the future, to at least fucking CLAP (if you absolutely refuse to cheer) when the team scores! I implore you!  I sincerely feel that a fan who sits quietly during a game robs the team of energy. Hence, during playoffs, how many times it was said that we had to ""score fast and suck the energy out of the crowd at the Bell Centre, that will keep the team down"""
OttawaSenators,34ewly,corneliusvanDB,-3,Sat May 2 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't been in it, but have been close to it.  I find it annoying as the guys with the drums/tambourines do not have a sense of rhythm.  Example:  Seven Nation Army starts playing on the loudspeakers and the supporters section start playing it about 30% faster than the recording, ending up being totally out of sync.  Embarrassing."

OttawaSenators,34ewly,mike-kt,0,Fri May 1 02:02:41 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if you have a drum try keeping a 4/4 beat on time.  This song has the most basic beat possible.  This isn't hard and begs the question why you're bringing a drum to the arena if you can't keep time with it.. don't like this concept?  I've been a soccer game in Monaco where the drummers were doing far more intricate rhythms in sync and kept time.  We can do better - not expecting perfection at all, just basic competency."

If it's an actual reddit account, then I'm OK with it.  They don't have to be a regular contributor here (or /r/hockey, or in any hockey related sub for that matter), just a real person that is at least willing to discuss their article.  The bots or accounts just existing to post articles, yea, fuck those."

OttawaSenators,34bq19,Omega613,7,Thu Apr 30 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with this decision, although I don't disagree with users giving it a go in the past (particularly those who use that revenue to help make a living).   At very least, if someone posts an article, I think being prepared to discuss it in depth with users on this board would be a big plus. If there is actual analysis (rather than simply a regurgitation of facts/reports) then there should be plenty to discuss. I know some people have made posts and never/rarely replied to feedback, questions, etc., which is a real shame and I feel misses one of the biggest reasons to post here. It should even be mutually beneficial to discuss your analysis here, as it ought to encourage more people to check it out (more traffic) and to make an effort ot follow your future links. But then again, I suppose that falls into Valentine's condition for posting ;)"
OttawaSenators,34bq19,Jthedude17,8,Wed Apr 29 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind individual bloggers posting to their sites/articles honestly. This is off topic but what annoys me is 70 post game threads all saying pretty much the same thing. I wish people could post to the game thread/a discussion thread instead of each posting their own link. This includes things like ""Go Sens go - from the Wildbros""  I appreciate their support but I hate when there is a post from like 10 different team's fans. I just wish we could use one thread for that stuff. That's my mini rant.  Anyway I don't mind blog posts as long as they are at least somewhat funny or meaningful. If the stupid ones are just monitored and deleted when needed I would be happy."
OttawaSenators,34bq19,deliciouswolves,6,Wed Apr 29 23:21:11 2015 UTC,"We had this issue with the ""appreciation threads"" a while back, and everyone got the message.  With our playoff run, it brought in a huge amount (not sure if actually huge, too lazy to check the stats) of outside comments which didn't necessarily fit with how neat and tidy we like stuff.  ie: everything in the preGT/GDT/postGTs, as you mentioned.  Without speaking for the other mods, I just let that stuff go during our playoff run, as I didn't want to be deleting people's comments somewhat needlessly for the sake of keeping stuff ""nice"".  We've been trying to use Stickied Posts (like this one) to keep stuff a bit cleaner when we can.  But we can only have 1 at a time, so it gets tricky at times."
OttawaSenators,34bq19,InTURRISting,6,Thu Apr 30 03:52:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not hating me. There's been a few times when we had to debate on this site whether or not me posting Bonk's Mullet links was within the Reddit guidelines. I agree with /u/TrulyMagnificient in that as long as a post promotes healthy discussion, and the articles are actually worth reading, I would have no problem with someone posting their own links.  Speaking as a blogger, and I know this is how guys like 6th Sens and SensChirp think about things the same way too, very little of what we do is about ad revenue. We probably all make around $1 per thousand views from Google Ads. In two years, my site has generated around $600 in revenue, which is about $25 a month, or $1.60 per article. Given the thought and consideration put in to each one, to then be accused to be sharing our articles because we want ad revenue feels like a slap in the face. We write articles because it's fun to be part of the online Sens community.  I've stopped posting our articles as much here because I didn't want to feel like a pest, so I appreciate having someone vouch for us. Twitter (and adult life) has taken most of my Reddit time away, but this is a great space for people to talk Sens, and that should only be encouraged."
OttawaSenators,34bq19,TrulyMagnificient,3,Thu Apr 30 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen how little AD REVENUE is driven to sites like this.   It's a pretty lame excuse to exclude people who just want to promote their hard work, where their audience is.  I don't make adrevenue of my photoshops.  but imgur does.  Maybe we should ban me for posting all of my images to imgur.  So tired of this broken logic from mods.  Either Reddit is organic and we let people post what they want, or we can no longer claim to be organically curated.  As soon as mods set arbitrary rules about where contents comes from the information is no longer aggregated organically.   Flies in the face of reddit IMO"
OttawaSenators,34bq19,InTURRISting,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of people aren't familiar with how much revenue is created by site ads, etc., so while it's an ignorant argument it should at least be understandable.  There definitely are accounts that come in, post some regurgitated or clickbait article, and literally self-promotion is all they do on reddit, they don't discuss or contribute anything, which I'm pretty sure is entirely against the rules of reddit.  And I can't think of any reason these types of accounts/bots exist other than to promote and drive traffic so the assumption that it's for $$$ is at least a bit valid for such tactics.  Users like yourself, /u/deliciouswolves, and the many others that regularly contribute and make /r/OttawaSenators excellent, often BECAUSE of the articles, primary works, and other links they post?  I don't think most people have a problem with this at all, and in fact, we would have a whole lot less to read, discuss, bitch, argue, and circlejerk about if we didn't have this stuff!"
OttawaSenators,34bq19,TrulyMagnificient,2,Thu Apr 30 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"Thats kind of how I feel.   But I dont see that kind of activity here at all.  At least not so badly, its pushing legit content away.  I mean I hate Bruce Garrioch, but if he or that other moron Donn Brennan, wanted to post their own sun articles here, I'd be ok with that!   Id downvote them, maybe ridicule them and be on my way-  never thinking once, GEEZ I wish mods would do something about these idiots!  Either we are free range organic information, or we are a museum/mosoleum of information artifacts curated by mods before users even get a crack at it.  I prefer the former."
OttawaSenators,34bq19,InTURRISting,2,Thu Apr 30 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  If Brennan and Garrioch started posting all their articles here and that's literally all they had a reddit account for (no posting of other 3rd party articles, discussion with other people in the community, etc.) then fuck them.  I can find that shit by searching ""ottawa senators"" on google.  If you want to post your articles and have a discussion, more power to you.    Again, just my opinion, and obviously we have a few differing ones here."
OttawaSenators,34bq19,TrulyMagnificient,2,Thu Apr 30 22:03:18 2015 UTC,I was engaging hyperbole...but I come here for one stop info shopping.  I want it all with the best perculated to the top by the hive.  I want my contributions to be treated fairly compared to users who sub links they stumble upon.  The only thing this subverts is user karma.  At the end of the day bloggers and amateur analysts need ways to get their work out there because no user is going to organically find and link scottswordonhockey.com.   If you see bots and stuff that's another thing all together but self subbed articles man I want to read as many as I can and I certainly don't want mods deciding by drawing a line in the sand that lumps user submitted content with Spam

OttawaSenators,34bq19,deliciouswolves,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:50:06 2015 UTC,There have been a few account in recent weeks with post history of:    link to website article 10 link to website article 9 reddit.ottawasenators link to website article 9 reddit.hockey link to website article 8 link to website article 7    And nothing else.  Reddit itself automatically removes them and puts them in the modqueue for unblocking.  That's what I'm talking about here.
OttawaSenators,34bq19,bobartlarry,7,Fri May 1 01:16:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree with this.     It's certainly open for interpretation of who contributes and who doesn't, but in the extreme example of ONLY ever posting links to their own hockey blogs, and never participating in discussion then yes, removal please."
OttawaSenators,34bq19,Funkativity,3,Thu Apr 30 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"I personally don't see the harm in it. After all, it's our choice whether to follow the links or not."
OttawaSenators,34bq19,InTURRISting,4,Thu Apr 30 06:11:38 2015 UTC,I guess the thing about Reddit is you're trusting people are posting links because they're good. People posting their own links breaks that trust system to a degree.
OttawaSenators,34bq19,broomlad,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:52:27 2015 UTC,I don't care who wrote it if it's a link to good writing. And I'm happy to judge that for myself. I suppose I'm a proponent of free speech.

OttawaSenators,34bq19,CJLethal,2,Thu Apr 30 01:59:33 2015 UTC,If a blog is 100% dedicated to the Sens.. I feel it' a bit pointless to create a separate thread to link each article/post here.  seems like the better solution is to simply have a sidebar section that links to all the Sens blogs.
OttawaSenators,34agvk,Omega613,22,Wed Apr 29 16:20:53 2015 UTC,"This was just a great season for the Senators. Alfie coming back, Phillips getting the most games played as a Senator mark, then of course the ""Rise of the Rookies"" and Hammond getting us into a playoff spot. We may not have gone as far as we hoped, but tell any Senators fan at the start of the season that we would make it to the playoffs and have a very close 6 game series with one of the best teams in the East and I think they would be ecstatic. Great season from the Sens, and I can't wait to see what next season brings.   GO SENS GO!"

OttawaSenators,34agvk,Arab09,3,Wed Apr 29 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great idea, and a great way to keep the subreddit active in the offseason. Maybe every week there's some kind of video compilation challenge; one week focus on goals, the next hits/fights, then do player specific ones. I think it could work well if we had people willing to participate."

OttawaSenators,34cjz3,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Thu Apr 30 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"Offer Hammond an AHL friendly deal, if he doesn't like it then allow him to walk. I still see the future as Lehner, even if Lehner lays in a dark room for the next 3 years he'd still he ahead of Hammond in youth and NHL experience.    2-3 year deals for Stone/Hoffman. Maybe even shorter for Hoffman. If they want longer, which I doubt, it needs to be modest 2nd line money at tops considering this season may be a peak.    Explain to Neil/Phillips they may not be on the ice much next season, we're thrilled to have them retire as Senators but if they want a change of scenery or a better opportunity to play we can start moving them around.    Sign Pageau for 2-3mill, but on a one-way. Assure the kid the fucking around between Ottawa/Bingo is done, but you can't offer anything higher than 3rd line money.    Small extension for Condra, 1 or 2 years tops which unfortunately may come with a higher than expected price tag. He played his best hockey this season so you don't want to overpay too much, in a season or two he'll likely be expendable considering the development of Lazar/Stone/Hoff/Puempel.     Given all the contract extensions that kick in next season Ottawa is looking at I think an 8 mill increase in expenses, add to that probably 4-5 mill in raises for RFAs and there are some bodies that need to go.  One of Legwand/Smith, I've always liked Smith :(, could go. Smith having the higher trade value and I believe Legwand may have a no-movemant clause?  I'm cool with keeping Legwand for another season for leadership purposes and maybe explore a few options around deadline time if he's still a 4th liner.    Greening... his agent is going to have to do some leg work here, but maybe an AHL team with inconsistent bottom 6 depth? Buyout may be a good option to lower the overall salary costs while we're on the final year of Legwand/Neil/Phillips contracts.    Or say FUCK IT ALL and make a splash. Eye up that Eberle guy from Edmonton, we all know how much Chiareli loves former Senators."
OttawaSenators,34cjz3,AskMeIfImAHuman,7,Mon May 4 05:09:56 2015 UTC,"Move Lehner for picks, re-sign Hammond to a one year show me deal. Hopefully sign O'Connor and play him in the AHL next season, he can take over as backup should Hammond not be able to cut it in that role.  My only guys that I want to keep for sure on defense are Karlsson, Methot, Ceci, Wiercioch, and Borowiecki. Ideally Boro is the 7th man and we bring in two veteran stay at home guys to be paired on the 2nd and 3rd pair with Ceci and Wiercioch respectively. Convince Phillips to retire, trade Cowen, banish Gryba to Siberia.  Re-sign the core forwards and keep the same top 9.  Hoffman-Zibanejad-Ryan   MacArthur-Turris-Stone   Condra-Pageau-Lazar   That's a great start and ideally we get rid of Legwand, Smith, Greening, and Michalek. Neil can stick around for one more season as the 13th forward. Ideally our new 4th line involves one of Puempel/Prince (Puempel preferably), Chiasson/Robinson (either is good), and a veteran center who is elite at faceoffs and the penalty kill (McClement is an excellent example).  Hoffman-Zibanejad-Ryan   MacArthur-Turris-Stone   Condra-Pageau-Lazar   Prince/Puempel-Vet C-Chiasson/Robinson  Neil  Methot-Karlsson   LH DFD-Ceci   Wiercioch-RH DFD  Borowiecki   Anderson  Hammond"

That said, I completely agree with getting rid of the others, and for good measure, throw Chiasson in there are well.  Oh, and the solid D. For heaven's sake, we just need one more great D-man (not amazing, just great), someone who can pass the puck properly to our forwards (who have been frikking incredible as it is..)"
OttawaSenators,34cjz3,AskMeIfImAHuman,2,Thu Apr 30 16:38:42 2015 UTC,"Nothing against the guy, personally I really like him as a player. But his contract is too heavy for a guy who would be on the 4th line every night. He's not taking Hoffman or MacArthur out of my top 6 and I would really hate to break up that third line so it's either 4th line or nothing.  4 million is way too much for a guy who is on the 4th line."
OttawaSenators,34cjz3,slurpfile,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:40:57 2015 UTC,"I felt that Michalek was invisible most nights. Yes, his skating improved this year but the production still wasn't there. I don't mind him on the team, but I wouldn't think twice about including him in a trade package if it brings us a solid D back. Also, I don't know how long he's going to keep his spot on the top lines with all of these kids coming up and stealing the show.  But yeah, I'm surprised Chiasson hasn't been mentioned much yet. He seems 100% replaceable to me."

We need a fucking defenseman. Just 1 to be honest. Trade anything and everything we have to get a good solid fucking stay at home D, and we'll be fucking scary as hell next season.

OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,3,Wed Apr 29 15:21:57 2015 UTC,Exactly.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,walahiguy,8,Wed Apr 29 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"I just heard that comment, and I just can't see it. I love GMBM, and he's clearly seeing something we're not.  I'm not sure if I was just distracted, but I could swear he said that Cowen had a sports hernia that needs surgery? Maybe he's still holding out that Cowen can be a part of the team?  Regardless, I'm still adamant that we need a top 4 d guy going forward to really be competitive."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,11,Wed Apr 29 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"they need another top 6 LW (or worst case, a C). That's who the target is. There is a clear hole there on LW"
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,BoobieRyan,8,Wed Apr 29 15:28:12 2015 UTC,The biggest priority is defence and I don't know why BM doesn't acknowledge that.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,On_Letting_Go,6,Wed Apr 29 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"he probably does think that but he doesn't have to say that publicly. Getting a top line LW like the Ryan trade would do wonders for the defense as well.   I think maybe one D piece is needed but the pieces are set, they just need time."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,BoobieRyan,-1,Wed Apr 29 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"Needs time? Everyone but Ceci is in their prime. They need someone to play with Wiercioch on the 2nd pairing more than they need another forward.   Which of Ryan, Stone, Macarthur and Hoffman would you want to improve on instead of D? Is the marginal improvement on a forward going to be as great as that of a defenceman?"
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,On_Letting_Go,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel like getting both would be best. We could get a 2nd pairing guy to play with Wiercioch (a Petry-Franzon kind of guy) and put Ceci on the 3rd with a shutdown. Hell, we already have BoroCop for that. It wouldn't take much. Then add a 1st line elite winger for Zibanejad & Ryan and bam, cup contender. We would have a line to compete with the likes of Anaheim's and Chicago's while retaining an above-average 2nd line and pairing and developing what we have in Ceci and our 4th line rookies (Prince, Robinson & Puempel come to mind as candidates). Obviously keep our 3rd line together. Keep in mind we have assets in Cowen, Legwand & company to trade away that still hold value (albeit not much in some cases cough).  For example:   Eberle-Zibanejad-Ryan MacA-Turris-Stone Lazar-Pageau-Condra Prince-Smith-Robinson   And then   Karlsson-Methot Wiercioch-Sekera Ceci-Boro (can we call that the Ottawa Line?)   Trade Lehner, Cowen + 2nd for Eberle and Hoffman for a good 2nd pairing d-man while his value is high. I feel like with the acquisition of an elite LW, we won't have much room for Hoffman and I don't think he can get much better than he was this year. It could be time to move someone like that."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:04:10 2015 UTC,I love Ebs but he is a RW.  Not all wingers can play both sides
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,walahiguy,0,Wed Apr 29 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"Replace Eberle with any comparable LW, point should still hold."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:16:22 2015 UTC,Yup I agree
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,PaddleDown,0,Wed Apr 29 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"I like Ryan more than Eberle, but consider the following:  Compare the Ryan trade 1) Silfverberg - good roster player,  2) Noesen -  good prospect,  3) 1st round pick   to Eberle for Lehner, Cowen and 2nd. 1) Lehner is pretty good but has issues 2) Cowen didn't play when his team was winning and carries a relatively big cap hit, 3) 2nd round pick is just a 2nd rounder."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,0,Wed Apr 29 19:58:48 2015 UTC,Wiercioch-Ceci is a good pairing in my opinion. Ceci is more proven than Wiercioch so I'm not sure why you're saying they need somebody to play with Wiercioch on the 2nd pairing. Those two are the ones I was referring to when I say they need time. I think the only guy I'd replace is Gryba.   I'd want to improve on Hoffman. We could get a massive improvement on him. I'm talking star forward.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,PaddleDown,5,Wed Apr 29 15:51:47 2015 UTC,Ceci was heavily carried by Wiercioch this year. Ceci had a CF% 7.5 points higher with Wiercioch than without him.   Wiercioch With or Without You stats  Ceci With or Without You stats  Wiercioch has been a good NHL defenseman for 3 years now and was a very good prospect before that.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,Chiefboss22,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:08:09 2015 UTC,"Right now Wiercioch is a solid #3 on this team, but it's hard to tell who has the most upside longer term. Wiercioch was managed pretty haphazardly the past couple of years but really started coming into his own once given a real chance to stick with the team. Ceci is pretty damn young, and might end up helping us form the top-4 we need in time. I've said before that Boro is fine for a 5/6 guy and if we slide a more mobile partner beside him I think we're set for what this team needs in the present. We don't have enough star power up front to be a true contender yet, so I think we're safe to let our D develop (including Wideman in this) and seeing what we have. In a few years once we're closer to being a contending team (hopefully), then that might be the time to reassess and see if our d-corps has rounded out into what we need it to be or not, and if not then address it. I don't think this team needs to do anything drastic this summer at either F or D, because we don't even know what we have long-term here yet. Under half a season with Cameron this roster played excellent, but with Stone's injury our offence was far too easy to check. I wouldn't be shocked to see a couple trades this summer, but they might end up being for picks rather than players, and Murray might look to free agency to bring in another body or two."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,2,Wed Apr 29 18:49:50 2015 UTC,If in 3 years Ceci puts up the numbers Wiercioch does he'll be universally loved by the fanbase. I can't emphasize enough how well the team does when Wiercioch is on the ice. If Ceci develops and does that well that will be a huge accomplishment for him.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,X0bi1e,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. This team likely isn't a championship team in the next couple years, I'd rather be patient and let these guys have a couple full seasons under Cameron's system with minor tweaks where necessary. In a few years, then we start making major moves if necessary... but right now, I think we're looking quite good considering where we are. Right now Wiercioch has the most value he's ever had (again, this isn't me saying we should trade him), and he's the only defenceman we have right now that I can see this team being willing to move who's actually worth something above negligible. People forget you need to give skill to get skill... not trade Gryba and a concussed Lehner and somehow get a big return."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"I think because:   He expects Wier and Ceci to progress into a solid 2nd pairing. This is reasonable given their ages, but obviously as fans we aren't as patient. We probably have 9 one way contracts next year on D until we move someone, all we need is a solid bottom pairing to emerge out of Boro, Gryba, Phillips, Cowen, and Wideman. Quite possibly Cowen is gone, but still.   Of course, we could add a 2nd pairing defenseman, but don't forget that Cody Ceci is 21 and will be solid in that spot very soon."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,walahiguy,3,Wed Apr 29 16:12:49 2015 UTC,"We're starting the Sens window of contention. Their best players are either in their cheap years or young UFAs, they've got a great goalie in Andy and they have a couple prospects that can play depth roles and free up money for more talent.   If the Sens can trade away their bad players to free up enough room for their RFAs and one new player, I hope that player is a defenseman. Ceci is still years away."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,JumpedAShark,2,Wed Apr 29 16:27:26 2015 UTC,"I understand that there's certainly a hole, but I think that we have a forward group that can definitely compete when healthy (I know, when healthy is a key part of the argument). But our back end depth is lacking IMO. A top 6 guy puts our forward group over the top, but the greatest improvement comes from getting a top 4 guy in the back as far as I'm concerned.  That being said, I think that Wideman needs to be given a shot, and maybe he can transition and fill the holes we're seeing... One can hope."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,PaddleDown,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:37:56 2015 UTC,I'm all for a Wideman - Ceci 3rd pairing if GMBM is able to add another top 4 D
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,MelvinFinklethorpe,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:45:27 2015 UTC,they are both RD. Won't work
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,kenata88,0,Wed Apr 29 16:10:29 2015 UTC,Mike Hoffman still exists.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,PaddleDown,3,Thu Apr 30 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"Longer term we might already have the top-4 d guy we need in Wideman, but that might come down to whether he re-signs with us this summer or not. Regardless, we didn't lose because of our defence, we lost because of our inability to score goals. I think our defence will round itself out nicely over the next few years once Ceci improves even more (he's only 21) and with Wiercioch gaining consistent ice-time as well. I can't see this team trading for a household-name guy on the back end quite yet, not at least until we see what we have and are a bit closer to being legit contenders."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,benches48,3,Wed Apr 29 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, our defence is getting better as they age and gain experience. A top 6 forward would give us so much depth up front we could roll a 4-line game."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,zdelusion,3,Wed Apr 29 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'm expecting from this off-season. Hammond resigns as our backup goalie, we keep Anderson and trade Lehner to a team willing to take a shot on him. To compensate the Sens sign O'conner out of College. In the package with Lehner we throw in one of our Defenseman, would like to see it be Cowen but odds are it'll be Gryba, to make room for Wideman to come up. Hopefully we can get a decent return and snag a scoring winger to help our secondary scoring, besides Stone and Macarthur no one was scoring down the stretch. I believe in our defense with another year under it's belt, but we NEED more scoring. See y'all next season :)"
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,benches48,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Lehner and Gryba would grab us a proven top-6 scorer unless a pick or two are packaged in there as well. Goalies aren't worth what you expect them to be worth on the trade market, especially unproven ones currently suffering from a major concussion... Gryba is at best a 5/6 guy on an average defence corps. We'd be better off signing a guy like Frolik, because that's probably the max we'd be able to get back anyways."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,walahiguy,4,Wed Apr 29 19:40:48 2015 UTC,Thing is: we have our top 6 already sorted out  It's our bottom 6 that need help.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,InTURRISting,2,Wed Apr 29 15:50:45 2015 UTC,7-9 is solid. 10-12 needs some help.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"4th line needs help.  Chiasson is the shit, Leggy has had a bad year and we're swapping Smith and Neil in and out. Come on, just put Pumpel back in next year."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,InTURRISting,0,Wed Apr 29 22:18:29 2015 UTC,we don't. Hoffman isn't reliable.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,9,Wed Apr 29 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah he'll probably regress next year as we hold him more accountable.  But he has shown significant growth year over year, despite physical setbacks.   Hoffman can be relied on to improve his game.   I expect 20 goals next year from him and be happy.  Thats top 6."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,InTURRISting,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly how much do we expect Hoffman's S% to drop by next year? 13.6% is around where you'd expect an above average shooter to be, and it's clear that Hoffman is most definitely above average in that regard. If he gets more icetime and finds his groove on the power play I think he could avoid a sophomore slump altogether next season."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,3,Wed Apr 29 16:47:25 2015 UTC,I expect him to regress only because of less shots- it's clear to me the Sens want him to alter some aspects of his game.  If he meets that target I expect fewer opportunities is all.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,InTURRISting,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:06:19 2015 UTC,You think the team is going to ask him to shoot less? Don't most coaches preach getting the puck to the net?
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:13:35 2015 UTC,"Well they put him on the fourth line.   Yes, they will ask him to play a team game.   Putting the puck on the net is useless if no one is there to pick it up.  In fact, failing to put the puck on the net reliably or at the right time is the #1 cause of offensive zone turnovers."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,InTURRISting,2,Wed Apr 29 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, they will ask him to play a team game.   Does not necessarily mean they'll ask him to shoot the puck less.   Putting the puck on the net is useless if no one is there to pick it up.   I disagree, I'd say almost all of the time getting the puck on net is beneficial for the team shooting. It's not always the best play available but I'd never say it's useless.    In fact, failing to put the puck on the net reliably or at the right time is the #1 cause of offensive zone turnovers.   I'd say the #1 cause of offensive zone turnovers is probably players over-handling/over-passing the puck instead of just getting it on net."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,relapsingoncemore,3,Wed Apr 29 17:39:16 2015 UTC,It's funny how much we disagree about hockey on a regular basis.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,benches48,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:54:38 2015 UTC,If everyone agreed with everyone discussing things like this wouldn't be any fun.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,peskysens,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:24:09 2015 UTC,I think they should keep Hoffman around just because of his game changing shot. He honestly is one of the few guys on the team who has the ability to change the score with just one flick of his wrist. He has one of the best releases in the NHL... but they do need to keep him in the top 6. He's not much use in the bottom two lines
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%, but he will need to be more responsible according to Sens management if he wants to keep getting those opportunities.  This translates to take fewer risks.  or we'll force you to take fewer risks."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,peskysens,3,Wed Apr 29 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted for this opinion. Truth is, he's got great speed, and a wicked shot, but he's not as great defensively as some of our LW'rs, and plays are constantly dying on his stick on the O'zone.   Bringing in another Top-6 LW allows us to slot Hoffman down to the 3rd line, making teams seriously think about those matchups."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,walahiguy,0,Wed Apr 29 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"We do.  Hoffy, on his debut year in the NHL, posted a grand total of 54 points. 54 considering he was just called up this year. It's just development and mental confidence. He has the talent, he just didn't have the confidence at the end of the year. Something snapped, just like the rest of the boys when we couldn't score goals."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,2,Wed Apr 29 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"I would much rather address the D line, but I think Murray is really still hoping on Cowen. Our current Top4 is decent, but I would love to see it improve. I doubt we have the assets to get a legit top4 D without hindering our team. I think a top6 LW could be good, I don't know about Hoffman, he had an incredible spurt, but I can see him regressing greatly."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,walahiguy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:39:33 2015 UTC,Why do you see him regressing greatly? His S% isn't that ludicrous for a guy that can shoot the puck like he does and all of his icetime adjusted production would suggest that he'll produce even more with increased icetime.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,2,Wed Apr 29 16:55:59 2015 UTC,Greatly was a bad choice of words. However he was a solid player who had a great hot streak. I don't see him continuing that hot streak over the course of the whole season. I also think that now people are targeting him and he isn't going to get the same chances.
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,walahiguy,-1,Wed Apr 29 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"""all of his icetime adjusted production would suggest that he'll produce even more with increased icetime.""  if you believe that, you're nuts. He has probably peaked"
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,T-ohm-y,4,Wed Apr 29 17:15:54 2015 UTC,Hoffman scored 27 goals playing third line minutes this season and I'm nuts to suggest if he got more than that he'd probably produce more?
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,SirZapdos,2,Wed Apr 29 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yes that's nuts, and no he didn't score most of his goals playing third line minutes.   More ice time does not mean more goals. 27 goals is already a lot ot ask for"
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,PaddleDown,2,Wed Apr 29 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"More ice time does not mean more goals.   So if a player scores 27 goals one year playing ~14 minutes a game, and then next year plays ~18 minutes per game you would expect their goal production to be unaffected by the change in icetime?   no he didn't score most of his goals playing third line minutes.   Just counted, 20 of his goals were scored in games where he played 15 minutes or less."
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,relapsingoncemore,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:34:59 2015 UTC,you are saying he should score 35 goals given 18 minutes of ice time per game. I am saying that is not going to happen. Remember Michael Grabner?
OttawaSenators,34a7y7,mike-kt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"you are saying he should score 35 goals given 18 minutes of ice time per game.   I am not saying this. What I am trying to say is that players overall production will almost all of the time increase with their icetime, it won't always be an exact relationship but to deny that there's no correlation between the two is silly.  Mike Hoffman could very well end up like a Michael Grabner type player. I personally don't think he will, but I'm not going to deny the possibility of it happening."
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,SirZapdos,8,Wed Apr 29 20:20:00 2015 UTC,You be the Boss   Fire Don Brennan
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,MightyGamera,3,Thu Apr 30 03:45:53 2015 UTC,They're really pushing hard for Ryan to be the most over rated considering who was in that group with him.
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,AskMeIfImAHuman,2,Thu Apr 30 08:27:05 2015 UTC,In case anyone hasn't seen it yet. I can't wait to see the results.
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,JohnnyPoster,2,Wed Apr 29 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"I know before the survey results a few things:  1) Dave Cameron will be overrated. Yes Paul Maclean was clearly incompetent but a) remember Mike Hoffman was on line 4 for Game 1, 2 & 3 and they lost those games. Game 4,5 &6 he is correctly put on line 2 and surprise surprise they play better. Hoffman was moved off line 2 for no reason at the end of the year. Cameron says he had to improve his defensive game but that sounds like BS to me. Its unacceptable to be sending messages like this in crucial games. He would have gotten it after game 1.  b) Anderson playing that game vs. Boston. c) Chiasson consistently getting extra ice time and in defensive duties. I often saw him fill in for Hoffman in a late game lead. Chiasson is clearly their worst defensive player and had the worst +- among reg players. But just watching him he is clearly not good defensively and is super soft. He isn't an NHL skater either.   Cameron is okay not great. He got the team to play pretty well but some of the moves he made were questionable.  2) Curtis Lazar will be given a 5 by everyone. I gave him a 2. I know he is 18 but 15 pts in 67 games is not going to cut it. I understand he may be better next year but this year he wasn't an NHLer and should have been in junior. I am rating him as an NHLer and not giving him a pass for being 18. This is because the vote is for how he played and his play this year wasn't very good. Am I still excited about Lazar going forward? Yes I am but the poll was how he played this year and it wasn't acceptable as a 3rd line player.   3) Mark Boro will be overrated. Everyone loves this guy despite being awful at possession and taking lots of penalties. All the stats show this. I understand he is the epitome of a guy who put in all the work to make it but I felt he was costing us Ottawa games during the stretch and the playoffs because they would be pinned in their own zone when he was on.   4) Eric Gryba will be underrated. Somehow he shoulders all the blame for everything going wrong on the pairing despite the fact he is the puck mover on the line and Boro struggles to complete a pass. This clearly puts more pressure on Gryba to be the puck carrier. It isn't a very good D pairing. Gryba needs a better partner.   5) Andrew Hammond - This one I am not sure about but I think people will underrate him and consider him a flash in a pan despite the fact that he has still only lost 2 regulation games in his whole career. He let in 2-3 weak playoff goals but so did Price in game 1 & 2. And remember it was his first playoffs ever which is a lot of pressure and most goalies struggle in year 1, see Price's first year. I think he handled it better than a lot of guys but overall it's good he got his feet wet in those games.  I didn't think he cost us any of the games in the playoffs and would love to have him as #1 or backup next year. Remember Andy gets injured in most seasons and his injuries usually take 1-2 months.   6) Chiasson, Cowen & Lehner. Not sure if people hate them as much as me but I have written them off as NHLers and want them gone at any cost. Some people still hold out hope for Lehner and I ask WHY??? So many good goalies in the NHL and the AHL. Basically there are too few NHL spots and too many good goalies. Basically any injury a team faces whether to Lundqvist in NY or Ottawa in Anderson they find the AHL or the backup is just as good of a goalie. I see no reason to wait on Lehner when there is tons of talent floating around in the AHL. Hammond isn't the exception he actually is more of the norm. Yeah his run was exceptional but I consistently see new goalies brought in the NHL in the NHL who immediately have success at the NHL level. Other examples are Bishop stuck in the AHL.  Also Hammond has clearly proven to be better than Lehner. Cowen is god awful but I would keep him over Boro. Ideally though we have neither back next year. Chiasson is one of my least favourite sens ever. Lazy, doesn't use his big frame. Hate him."
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,Omega613,3,Wed Apr 29 22:04:07 2015 UTC,"I rated Chiasson a 2 and Lazar a 3. Lazar looked good in the playoff run, but then again he was linemates with Pageau and Condra (Mr. Corsi). I think I had Boro at a 3 and Gryba as a 2 or a 3.   I agree about Cameron and Hoffman. That made no sense at all to me. He was their leading goal scorer!"
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,JohnnyPoster,2,Wed Apr 29 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"Some counterpoints, although I certainly agree with your general ideas for most of these:   Cameron wasn't perfect, for sure. Cameron also is a rookie coach at the NHL level, and didn't have a training camp in which he could properly introduce his players to his system and scout how well they would work in various roles. Certainly agree Hoffman being moved was a mistake - at least long term. Short term (a few games) as a little kick/experiment, no prob, but he was on the 4th way too long. Starting Andy for Boston I don't necessarily disagree with except in hindsight, but clearly water under the bridge since we made the playoffs. I'll touch on Chiasson in the next point along with Lazar.  Sufficed to say, he was imperfect but this team was fun to watch, successful (made the playoffs, contrary to mid-season expectations), and the players themselves saw growth in play/role. That's a very successful year from a coaching standpoint. The degree of mistakes you mention are less than what I hear from Chicago about Quennville or Detroit about Babcock - no coach will go without criticism and frankly Cameron exceeded every expectation I had of him (I was initially disappointed by him being promoted mid-season).  First off, Lazar is 20, not 18 - big difference because it means he already spent a year in junior after being drafted. He's won at every level in junior and captained team Canada to gold (this season). If it were possible, I agree that Lazar should've been in the AHL, but that wasn't possible because of some strange rules. However I doubt being sent back to the Oil Kings would've resulted in better development for him or roster for us. However, he was routinely responsible defensively, seldom a liability on ice (no more so than anyone else on our team), and he was on a ~20 point pace over 80 games. Ideally, you would want a little more production from a bottom-6 winger, but it wasn't exactly abyssmal production either (there are plenty of bottom-6 wingers in this league producing ~5 points). At the same time, we aren't an ideal team, so imagining these ""ideal"" situations is pointless and we have to work with what we've got. Which brings me to my other point on Lazar - our RW depth. For our bottom two RW spots, we basically had the option of Lazar, Chiasson, and Nei (short of calling up some even less experienced AHL player that likely belongs even less on our roster right now). If you dig into the stats, Lazar and Chiasson are by far the better two options. They're more skilled, can benefit from the playing time (developmentally), are less of a liability than Neil (turnovers/penalties) most nights, throw plenty of hits (Neil's supposed specialty), and also didn't spend a good chunk of the season injured. All in all, I would give Lazar a pretty decent (but admittedly <5) mark on this season. Boro is certainly overrated, but he's loyal (Ottawa native), he brings leadership (was captain in Bingo), is a semi-skilled enforcer (to replace Neil, but not useless like John Scott), and is on a great contract. I'm the first to admit I wasn't happy about having Boro up to start the season, and one of my biggest fears was his PIM (we were so bad last year). But he had fewer minors than Gryba (21 to 26, and EK had 21 by the way), and qualitatively I remember many of Gryba's being boneheaded and ill-timed. Boro got many of his in scrums, which weren't ""officially"" fighting majors, but often coincidental minors which isn't nearly as problematic. Boro had half as many giveaways as Gryba (21 vs. 40) and almost twice as many blocked shots (101 vs. 58). The pair of Boro/Gryba was terrible as most know, and a puck mover would really improve that pairing (Wideman, perhaps?), but everything considered I would take Boro over Gryba easily now despite starting the season with the opposite opinion. Gryba is certainly underrated, and I do think some team can pick him up and have success with him on the bottom pair. As you say, he's the better puck mover on that bottom pair, largely in part to his above average skating (likely also has a bit of influence on the giveaway stat I posted in #3). Then again, that's become his role (puck moving 3rd pair dman) and he's not really very good at it - at least Boro performs the stay-at-home shot blocker+bonus enforcer role reasonably well. But like I said, that pairing needs to go (too many #6/7 dmen in general on this team) and if it were my choice Gryba is the odd man out for the above reasons, and I can't help but factor that into my evaluation. I agree with your points here in thinking Hammond's actually a capable NHL goalie (although probably better suited to an affordable backup role). Although I think people will overrate him rather than underrate him (if Reddit/twitter is any indication). He's been very good, but if were honest the team played very well in front of him most nights down the stretch too, which at least probably inflated his Wins/Losses ratio and to a lesser extent SV%. And overall, though he looked good throughout his 23 regular season starts, that's also not a big sample size on which to base a grade. His stats were/are unsustainable, and that has to be factored in. It's like taking a course but only taking (and acing) one single quiz throughout the year while skipping all the others - it's really not fair to give you a top mark for such a small sample. Hammond was also better in his first ~10-15 games than in the latter half, which makes me question how well he would handle a full 82 game season (even as a backup). Here's where I perhaps disagree most. Although first off, I agree that Cowen is just bad. I understand that injuries have hampered his development, but the Sens made the (classic) mistake of drafting him because he's big before any other major attribute. Aside from the occasional play, he's never looked ""good"" on a regular basis in his NHL career and being young is not really an excuse at this point. And if you go by the ""occasional play"", you can make any player in this league look good. However, in spite of all my complaints, I also don't want the team to rush into any 'ol deal to trade him because he was a former 9th overall pick and we all know damn well that someone in this league will be willing to overpay for him if we're just a little bit patient/persuasive. Not re-couping a reasonable amount of his value would be terrible asset management. Chiasson didn't particularly impress me, he certainly didn't live up to expectations, that much is for sure. He also had a bad habit of taking very careless/ill-timed penalties when he could easily have avoided it. That all said, we have an absence of decent (NHL ready) RWs in this organization, and if I scrap my biases of thinking he would be a major scoring threat then I find myself liking him a little better. Given his age/experience, it's not out of the question for the off-season trainers to help him mould himself into more of a two-way player, such that he can better fill the role of a bottom-six winger with decent offensive upside. So in that regard I'm not too bothered by him so long as he's offered a small (cost & term) deal this summer. Alternatively, he's still young enough to be considered a prospect/project, so his value as part of a deal shouldn't necessarily be underestimated (esp. given his size, which too many GMs in this league over value). Lehner is where my opinion departs the most. I'm satisfied giving him a bad score on the season, because he wasn't generally very good. However the team played dreadfully in front of him too, for whatever reason, and in a ~25 game sample size team performance is hardly irrelevant (often played behind Cowen/Phillips, didn't benefit from late season success/confidence). He certainly has stuff to work on this Summer, and I'm worried about his health with the recent concussion, but looking as his career as a whole (NHL, AHL, SHL, etc.), this year is the anomoly so far, and thinking anything else is very shortsighted. He's unlike Cowen in this regard, because he has shown himself to be good on a regular basis in the recent past, in the NHL and at lower levels. He's only 23 with 86 games of experience, which is comically too young to judge 99% of goaltenders' NHL ceiling (See: Price, Hammond, Anderson, Lundqvist,  etc..). Price is the example I keep citing, because up until last season, he was alternating between good and bad seasons, then finally after ~300 NHL games and age 25 he's followed up with 2 consecutive good NHL seasons and finally isn't perennially cracking under playoff pressure either. Montreal's patience paid off, in spite of many fans calling for him to be traded (most won't admit it now). That's not to say Lehner will be as good as Price, but we don't need him to be that good either. Fairly consistent ~91.8-92.5% season performances would make him an excellent starter and is well within the realm of his projected potential. Having a goalie put up 93.0%+ every year is awesome but hardly necessary to have success (See: Chicago, L.A., Pittsburgh, Detroit, etc.)."
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,JumpedAShark,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:33:19 2015 UTC,"1) Cameron made some moves that really annoyed me. Putting your top goal scorer on line 4 for game 1, 2 & 3 makes my blood boil and I would argue cost them the series and this knocked several notches off his score.. 2) I gave Lazar a 2/5 because he was a below average 3rd liner. I think he will improve but overall that isn't so controversial if we are rating this year.  3) Boro's a great shot blocker because he has little ability to clear the puck.  4) Hammond stole at least 6-7 of the games. He downright stole the LA game and the Carolina game. Also the Sens record with Cameron but excluding Hammond games is under 500% and the sample size is also about 20 games. So weird all the wins magically happen when Hammond plays.  5) Cowen loses value every day. Can't see people trading for him, see BRIAN Lee. I wish he was traded for someone good but I'd take anything I can get.  Chiasson lacks puck skills. He literally has no skill worthy of development. I'd rather find a completely different random 23 year old than him.  Lehner: I've written Lehner off as mentioned. His technical skills are poor as an NHLer. And I see no reason to keep him when we have 2 goalies that are better.  You mention Price Lundqvist but for one Lundqvist was always good so your example is already poor. Price also never stunk it up like Lehner did. Furthermore you fail to mention all the goalies who randomly appeared out of the AHL who were stars. There is so much goalie talent in the AHL, NHL an internationally that even if Lehner turns into an ANdy, who really cares?? Andy's are available everywhere and I wouldn't hold onto a $3M contract for that small possibility."
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,JohnnyPoster,2,Thu Apr 30 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"Other examples are Bishop stuck in the AHL   Ben Bishop didn't get good until he was about 25. Andy didn't become a starter until he was 30. Goalies take time. Give Lehner a second, he's only 23.  Also, I'm curious where all this ""talent"" you see floating around the AHL is, and how you propose we get it."
OttawaSenators,34bdzk,Fuckwildbros,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:36:54 2015 UTC,"Bishop was stuck in the AHL was the point. Had Ottawa not taken a chance on him he may still be stuck there. STL was unwilling to call him up rather ironically.  Anyways you missed my point because Ottawa already has talent in the goalie position. The point was if Hammond and Andy stink it up,  its not as if we're finished. I bet there are AHL goalies who are perfectly competent to take over Anderson and Hammond's job. Just as Hammond was perfectly competent to take over Lehner's job.  There is no reason to carry 3 goalies on the off chance that Lehner may turn out to be as good as Hammond or Andy is now."

OttawaSenators,34aa79,ClapBomb,4,Wed Apr 29 22:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the market for top-4 D right now is rough. You generally either overpay (in salary or in trade) or you're left wanting it seems.  Personally, I wouldn't even say we need a star ""top-4"" guy, more like a steady and reliable middle-pair quality player, ideally someone good at shot suppression if we can be so picky. Someone who can play either on the 2nd or 3rd pair, where placement is based on injuries and/or performance (gives Wier or Ceci a break if they're struggling, and some developmental insulation too). We don't need to go out and get a highly paid/sought after Stralman or Seabrook necessarily, but a Russell/Franson/Petry equivalent would be super. Basically, picture a blueline version of the MacArthur UFA signing - something low key, low risk (1-2 years), low-to-mid cost, and with reasonably high reward, and a non-targeted player meaning we aren't bidding to drive up costs. That might be acquired via trade or by free agency (perhaps even an international signing, given the KHL issues)."

OttawaSenators,34aa79,X0bi1e,2,Thu Apr 30 11:19:48 2015 UTC,"They will have an increased budget next season (already discussed).   Do you think this means any major acquisition/addition, or is it just to cover the raises for Stone, Hoffman, etc?"
OttawaSenators,34aa79,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Fri May 1 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, no, it won't be for the purpose of a major acquisition/addition, at least not unless we can clear out some of the unnecessary assets we currently hold. It's easy to forget that we made five major extensions this off season which all kick in on July 1st:  Extensions  1. Bobby Ryan: Extended for 7 years @$7.25M/yr (Formerly $5.1M/yr)  2. Clarke MacArthur: Extended for 5 years @$4.65M/yr (Formerly $3.25M/yr)  3. Craig Anderson: Extended for 3 years @$4.2M/yr (Formerly $3.188M/yr)  4. Mark Borowiecki: Extended for 3 years @$1.1M/yr (Formerly $0.575M/yr)  5. Marc Methot: Extended for 4 years @$4.9M/yr (Formerly $3.0M/yr)   Those alone add ~$7M to our $56-$58M payroll, and only Eric Condra ($1.25M/yr) is an expiring UFA. Add on the need to re-sign Hoffman, Zbad, Stone, Pageau, and possibly Chiasson and Condra - suddenly we're up against the cap. However, We're also presently carrying 15 forwards+8 defensemen+3 goalies that are on 1-way contracts and/or non-waiver exempt. So that total will come down. by necessity. Let's look at the roster we were icing for most of our run and the corresponding salaries for next season (with the exception of Hammond, since his future status is probably most in limbo, and Phillips, since we pretty much untradeable and even if he retired we would still be on the hook for his cap hit thanks to the 35+ rule):     LW C RW     MacArthur (4.65) Turris (3.5) Stone (???)    Hoffman (???) Zibanejad (???) Ryan (7.25)    Condra (???) Pageau (???) Lazar (1.254)    Michalek (4.0) Legwand (3.0) Chiasson (???)       D Left D Right     Methot (4.9) Karlsson (6.5)    Wiercioch (2.0) Ceci (1.369)    Borowiecki (1.1) Gryba (1.25)    Phillips (2.5)        G     Anderson (4.2)    Lehner (2.25)    That roster with it's current contracts all signed comes to $49.723M, with the six players above all still needing contracts. On top of that, the following $9.537M in players is presently on our payroll:     Extra Extra Extra     Greening (2.65) Smith (1.887) Neil (1.9)    Cowen (3.1)      Hammond (???)      Let's say, for arguments sake, we manage to trade an equivalent of about half of those ""extras"" for a reasonable return in futures (picks/prospects, basically non-roster players), but we're still on the hook for ~$5M. That brings our pay roll to near $54-55M before re-signing anyone. I don't know how much our budget will have increased thanks to tremendous fan interest and a playoff run to close the season, but let's say we end up at the midpoint of our current payroll and the cap, meaning about ~$65M. That leaves $10M-11M to sign six players, which is doable but might be tight. I'm also assuming that if Wideman and Grant (from the AHL) are re-signed to 1-way contracts, that we would end up shipping out players of similar value occupying their potential roster spots (presumably Gryba, and... maybe Chiasson, but we would have to re-arrange some players to make them fit positionally.). But we'll ignore that for now since it's too hard to predict and likely won't impact our payroll by more than ~±$0.5M.  Anyway, for the sake of trying to put some numbers in for the re-signed players, let's say the following contracts happen:  RFAs  1. Mike Hoffman: Re-signed for 3 years @$3.0M/yr (Age 25, buying some UFA years)  2. Mika Zibanejad: Re-signed for 3 years @$2.5M/yr (Age: 21)  3. Mark Stone: Re-signed for 2 years @$2.5M/yr (Age: 22)  4. J.G. Pageau: Re-signed for 3 years @$1.25M/yr (Age: 22)  5. Alex Chiasson: Re-signed for 1 years @$1.5M/yr (Age: 24)    UFAs  1. Eric Condra: (Estimated) Re-signed for 3 years @$1.5M/yr (Age: 28)   I have difficulty believing the numbers work out any cheaper than that, and that already comes to $12.25M, which is a little over our proposed budget estimation. Management either has to swallow that little bit of overage or we need to trade away one more of those ""extra"" players we retained earlier or we have to move someone of greater expense than who we can call up in their place. We can be semi-confident that the 4C spot could instead be occupied by Grant, and the 4LW spot could be occupied by Puempel/Prince - thereby making one of Legwand or Milo expendable. Personally, the former would be preferable to me if it could be arranged, but at this point I'm now going into hypothetical roster moves more than I am analyzing the definite roster situation. So I'll leave the armchair GMing to another thread, but going back to your question, I don't see it being possible to make a major acquisition, but a small upgrade here or there while shipping out equivalent cap hits would definitely be plausible. The only way it would happen is if we trade out nearly all of those ""extra"" players somehow (easier said than done with guys like Greening) and whomever would be displaced in our roster by the incoming player. Once again, plausible, but seemingly unlikely."
OttawaSenators,34aa79,X0bi1e,2,Fri May 1 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"The only thing that gets me is our trade priority. It all makes more sense with Cowen being injured, but damn do I think we need more depth on the back end. I'd be targeting a top 4 pairing guy."
OttawaSenators,34aa79,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Wed Apr 29 15:35:55 2015 UTC,"Acquiring a top 4 essentially ends Cowen's chances at being a Senator though.  Unless maybe you move Weircioch for the new top 4 acquisition? Cash in on the team Canada hype but you get rid of an emerging 24 year old...  The second pairing is a glaring weakness for sure, but with the youth up front and the changing of the guard expected in net over the next season or two means Ottawa still has time before the second pairing is a desperate priority."
OttawaSenators,34aa79,X0bi1e,3,Wed Apr 29 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed. However, I was pretty set at this point that Cowen should be traded. Recent news indicates he once again was dealing with an injury though. How much longer do you wait?  I feel like he could be best used to sweeten the pot or help us alleviate some contract burdens.  I guess I've just lost patience with the whole thing, and that's probably why I could never be an NHL GM."

OttawaSenators,34aa79,broomlad,3,Wed Apr 29 18:44:21 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it. Murray did say they were gonna tread carefully, but I don't know if I can handle a third year where I say ""I really hope he finally takes that step forward,"" because we can all agree he's just not cutting it right now.  Also, the interview he did with Brennan (and yes, I always take these with a grain of salt... or a whole box) didn't give me any confidence. It struck me the wrong way he didn't show any fire to get back into a playoff series. Even if you know you can't do it or shouldn't, it's not what you say."

OttawaSenators,3495li,GilmerInSpace,0,Thu Apr 30 02:23:28 2015 UTC,Because I'm planning on Andy having at least 3-4 good years left. Lehner won't be a back up that long. He'll want to be a starter and he will be a pain in the ass next year to sign because of that. I'm hoping that by the time Andy is done Hammond or O'Connor can step up. Also there is no point in having 3 goalies on your roster. If Hammond resigns that will be an expensive trio of goalies.
OttawaSenators,3495li,JumpedAShark,2,Thu Apr 30 03:32:44 2015 UTC,Can we not trade Andy once we feel Lehner's ready for the starting role? Seems like that's been our plan for the future for a couple years now.

OttawaSenators,3495li,GilmerInSpace,0,Thu Apr 30 05:13:46 2015 UTC,"That means we keep Andy, Lehner, Hammond, O'Connor and Dreidger on the pay role? Melnyk won't let us spend as it is. I'd much rather keep Andy and Hammond, trade Lehner for something juicy, have O'Connor develop and then let Hammond or O'Connor replace Andy when he's done. Or potentially have a new goalie.  And Lehner doesn't want to be a back up. That's why it was so hard to sign him at the start of this year.  His contract is up again next year, if he is going to have to backup Andy for another 3-4 years he'll ask for a ridiculous amount."
OttawaSenators,3495li,AskMeIfImAHuman,6,Thu Apr 30 05:39:40 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up but if we sign him, Lehner is pretty much good as gone. Bryan Murray told him that we would trade a goalie if he signed here and Anderson and Murray have showed loyalty towards each other in the past so it likely wouldn't be him being moved.  Hammond would not be traded because they could let him walk away as a free agent and wash their hands of him.  That leaves Lehner, who is young and struggling. You have to assume that O'Connor is only willing to spend a maximum of one year in the minors, and rightfully so, so he is going to pick the team that gives him the best opportunity to give him an NHL job and that is not us with Lehner around.  If he signs here, we go into next season with goalie depth like this.  Anderson  Hammond (1 year contract)  O'Connor  Driedger  OR  Anderson  O'Connor  Driedger  O'Connor is not signing here to be a future backup behind Lehner."
OttawaSenators,3495li,BusinessCasualty,4,Wed Apr 29 14:28:35 2015 UTC,"You're making the wrong call in giving Hammond an offer, Bryan.   That means that Lehner is pretty much gone which is a stupid, stupid move. Hammond got exposed in the Montreal series. It's a real possibility he could be nothing special next season. Team's know what to expect from him and have video on him to break down his game. Montreal showed that this past series.   Why would we give up on Lehner so soon? Yeah, I get it he had a bad year but the guy's only 23. You're going to give up on a guy you spent a high draft pick on for such an important position? I mean I know we don't want to have to wait forever to see if Lehner becomes the type of goalie we hope he can be but atleast give him one year to bounce back, man. I was hoping we would see what Lehner could do for another couple of years before giving up on him like it's obvious Ottawa's doing with this Hammond news. If he showed no improvement in the next 2 seasons, then sure, I can understand maybe trading him might be a good thing to do.   But so soon? After one bad season?   That just shows the front office gave into the hype rather than looking at it in an objective way."

Honestly though, there are only a few MSM guys that I even bother paying attention to anymore. Even then most of them I only listen to because they're the first to report notable hockey news."
OttawaSenators,347nv1,JackLeiper,2,Tue Apr 28 23:15:44 2015 UTC,"Whadya think? Huge turn around for him in terms of recognition, nice to see. Likely buys him another shot to prove what he's got.   .. and to think the team was actively looking to move him. Good on Patty!"
OttawaSenators,347nv1,kenata88,2,Tue Apr 28 23:16:25 2015 UTC,"I foresee the team moving on with Cowen with how Weirchioch has stepped up and how high the team is on Wideman and to a lesser extent Claesson. I love what Patty brings to the table, good skater and good with the puck, a type of Dman the league is trending towards."
OttawaSenators,347nv1,benches48,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:12:35 2015 UTC,"wouldn't call Wiercioch a ""good skater"" has some serious work to do there. Can be worked on, but not taking away from what he's brought.   Hoping he gets another fair chance going forward."
OttawaSenators,347nv1,peskysens,-2,Thu Apr 30 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"The fuck Senshot? Moving Hoffy? You're kidding, he would, regardless of conference, haunt us and come back and bite us in the ass. Don't make idiotic statements like that if you want to be reputable. Yes we could use some more depth, but to drop one of our top forwards is a bit of a stretch."
OttawaSenators,347nv1,benches48,2,Wed Apr 29 00:44:46 2015 UTC,Hoffman was far from a top forward near the end. He started to regress. I wouldn't put any eggs into that basket until mid next season to see if he can keep up the play.

I made major trades (Got Ellis, St.Louis, Simmonds, and a few others), completely re-did my coaching staff (sorry Cameron :/), won the cup this year, then traded my 1st rounder and some spare parts to the Yotes, they won the lottery, and I drafted McDavid.

He's maligned because he doesn't look like a star NHL defenseman, even though all the statistics say he is.  He skates weird, so he must be a bad skater, and if he's a bad skater, he probably isn't going to be good at hockey.  If he's not good at hockey, why are we paying this guy when we have real hockey players we could put on the ice instead of him?  When in doubt, the eye test is always wrong.  Numbers might mislead you, but if they keep coming up aces, the guy's probably an ace."
OttawaSenators,347fde,thirty7inarow,2,Wed Apr 29 17:36:05 2015 UTC,He's either the luckiest person to ever play hockey or he's just good at it.   Good things happen when he's on the ice so consistently that's it's not a fluke.

It was too easy for me to fall into the tank mentality a few months ago given the Sens history of not being able to step up when it mattered.  It's that killer instinct they always talk about from good teams that the Sens have sorely lacked since the pizza line days.  But it's certainly good to see it return!  Here's to next season!  GO SENS GO!"
OttawaSenators,346031,DawnaBard,13,Tue Apr 28 16:02:05 2015 UTC,"He deserves it, finished the last couple months of the season really strong and had a great playoffs.

Fortuntely, not really bad news, at least not for Karlsson. Zbad getting some more international experience/exposure might've been a plus, but again selfishly (as a Sens fan) I would rather his long term health be a priority.  Many suspected Karlsson was nursing some minor injury in the last couple weeks of the season since he didn't take part in many practices and same during the playoffs. We were just told ""maintenance day!"", under the guise that he plays a lot so having him fresher for games would be better. Glad we now know for sure :)  PS.

OttawaSenators,3434tb,as_hagi,2,Tue Apr 28 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"The only one I could personally put ahead of him this season - if injuries not a factor - is Giordano. But had he been healthy, who knows how he might've played down the stretch, entirely possible he slumps significantly and wrecks his chances anyway. EK was there all damn season for sure - including before Methot returned. Admittedly he had to spend a chunk of his ice time bailing out incompetent partners which hurt his production, but he was still great in the first half too."
OttawaSenators,3434tb,Omega613,14,Tue Apr 28 05:23:36 2015 UTC,"There's going to be lots of bitching in /r/hockey about this because ""Karlsson"" doesn't play defence, but when Karlsson is on his game there is not a single other defenceman I'd rather have on my team. His defensive shortcomings are exaggerated by people that don't watch him play, and don't recognize that he doesn't defend by pushing people around in the corners and in front of the net.  Though I wish we'd play him less at even strength and on the power play so that he could kill penalties. /s"
OttawaSenators,3434tb,SirZapdos,39,Mon Apr 27 22:59:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard for Karlsson to play defence, because when he's on the ice, the puck is hardly ever in the Senators zone."
OttawaSenators,3434tb,Fenrir,12,Mon Apr 27 23:11:33 2015 UTC,"This is the best argument against the ""doesn't play defense"" narrative. When your team is on the offense, they are playing the best kind of defense."
OttawaSenators,3434tb,ineedaneasyfriend,2,Tue Apr 28 01:44:24 2015 UTC,"He's good defensively. His speed and skating ability more than makes up for his lack of strength, great hand eye and stick to break up passes, usually in good position.

OttawaSenators,3434tb,Omega613,3,Mon Apr 27 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"It was somewhat of a legitimate criticism in his first season or two in the NHL, as is usually the case for any ~20 year old dman. Also up until this year (under Cameron) he was leaned on for almost every neutral zone puck carry while on ice, which ineviably led to turnovers, but the reason was ignored and the result was blown of proportion (chocking, right?). But even by his last Norris trophy year he was solid in his own end. I think you're right that there's a natural assumption that offensive and defensive dmen aren't the same. Nowadays? He's pretty spectacular on either side of the puck, and when he does make a mistake of have a turnover he has the speed to compensate or the skill to run things all by himself leaving his partner (usually Methot) free to patrol nearly a full zone back from the play. The only arguable knock on EK is that he gets very like PK time, but when (for example) you play over 30 minutes in a night, including all 8:00 minutes of powerplay, suddenly pushing PK time on him seems hardly fair :P"
OttawaSenators,3434tb,chumpawumpa69,5,Tue Apr 28 05:32:28 2015 UTC,"The penalty killing thing is the worst. I don't want to say that anybody can kill penalties, but...

I'd say it's between Subban and Karlsson, with Karlsson getting an edge offensively (goals over assists). Subban has a drastically better +/- but that's more to do with Price than himself (not that he's bad defensively), but his approach to the game what with diving and theatrics might sway some votes away. We'll see!"
OttawaSenators,3434tb,Eagled,4,Tue Apr 28 01:13:38 2015 UTC,He's got this. Hands down.

OttawaSenators,3434tb,Stinky-pickle,-4,Mon Apr 27 22:53:44 2015 UTC,I'm blown away that a joke like Subban can even be considered.

OttawaSenators,3434tb,i-am-the-walrus789,2,Mon Apr 27 23:23:13 2015 UTC,No other player has been reprimanded as many times as PK this season for diving/embellishment. Does the NHL really want to be handing trophies to that kind of player? I'm as surprised as /u/stinky-pickle that he even got the nomination.
OttawaSenators,3434tb,JumpedAShark,2,Tue Apr 28 06:42:35 2015 UTC,"He's good yes,  but is he Norris worthy?  I know he has been in the passed,  but this year?  I'm not sure"
OttawaSenators,3434tb,Stinky-pickle,5,Tue Apr 28 01:23:42 2015 UTC,"He had 60 points this year to Karlsson's 66, and he was pretty damn good defensively. I'd say he deserves the nod if EK does."
OttawaSenators,3434tb,matty323,0,Tue Apr 28 06:57:56 2015 UTC,"Won't deny he's a very skilled player, but the fact that he's such a dirty and  undisciplined player, on top of being a career diver should disqualify him from any consideration for any award."

OttawaSenators,3441z3,PlaylisterBot,3,Tue Apr 28 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome!! Great job. Even if many of these guys go before we pick, I always love reading their bios. And there are always a couple who slide almost inexplicably (Forsberg to 11th in 2012, as a recent good example), hopefully we don't pass on 'em if they do!   From what you've seen/read/etc., any idea when the #2-4(ish) international skaters are expected to go? You mention Rantanen being an early pick overall, but what about guys like Carlsson/Kylington - any chance they at least drop to one of our 2nd rounders to your knowledge?"
OttawaSenators,3441z3,Omega613,3,Tue Apr 28 03:44:54 2015 UTC,"Looking like they'll go in the late first round or early second round. This year's not a fantastic year for players coming over from Europe, and further scouting has seen them slip down the rankings. (Physical concerns mostly, teams look at the risk of the player and the length of time it takes to transition to NA. If you have someone who might be the next big thing, but he's going to take 5 years to cross the pond, he's not going in the first round.)  North America's brought it's A-game this year as well, very tough and deep draft."
OttawaSenators,3441z3,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:47:42 2015 UTC,It would be sweet if Kylington slid to us in the 2nd (likely with the Dallas pick). He's had a rough go of it this year but that could be an abberition - he's got the skills. Standard 2nd round situation.

OttawaSenators,343xlv,SkullCrusherXP,4,Tue Apr 28 02:40:14 2015 UTC,Methot and MacArthur both had hip flexor injuries. Stone had a bone bruise/micro fracture on his wrist. Pageau was likely banged right the fuck up from all the shot blocking. I'm convinced Bobby is injured (but that's just speculation)   We'll probably find out more in a few days.
OttawaSenators,343xlv,Stinky-pickle,3,Tue Apr 28 02:47:45 2015 UTC,"Do we know yet if that's why Methot only played 15:35 in the last game? Or was it more a matter of rewarding Wiercioch with extra ice time (and an opportunity to play with Karl, including ~6min each on PP and even strength with EK) for his excellent playoff series?"
OttawaSenators,343xlv,Omega613,4,Tue Apr 28 04:56:26 2015 UTC,I imagine it was a bit of both. Methot's injury probably hampered him and we needed to score. Cameron adjusted accordingly.
OttawaSenators,343xlv,JumpedAShark,3,Tue Apr 28 07:12:11 2015 UTC,"Dean Brown was saying that after game 6, he saw Methot walking out of the CTC with a pretty wicked limp. It's probably why he only played 15 minutes."
OttawaSenators,343xlv,Stinky-pickle,2,Tue Apr 28 13:20:07 2015 UTC,He also was the last man back and rushed right up the middle into two Habs turning the puck over just outside the blueline. Boroweicki took the next 2 shifts with Karlsson.

OttawaSenators,342w0e,MrPilg0r,19,Mon Apr 27 22:51:33 2015 UTC,"If we're getting rid of Lehner I want him gone to a team in the west, or at very least out of our division. No matter what you say, he's always been projected to have all kinds of potential, and we've seen with Bishop that goalies take longer to develop. While there's no guarantee with him, I want to be safe and not get repeatedly burned by him if he turns out to be great, like the Laughs with Rask"
OttawaSenators,342w0e,lotio,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"Sound logic. Small chance we might see a deal with Edmonton... Particularly since Chiarelli has a penchant for dealing young guys and for getting deals done with GMBM. Can't say I'd shed a tear if Lehner were shipped out in a package that saw an Eberle or Hall coming our way! Pure speculation of course, but stranger things have happened..."
OttawaSenators,342w0e,housewife_hell,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:06:16 2015 UTC,"Of course, the could all get screwed up if Matt O'Connor signs with Edmonton, which I think really depends on which he values more - potentially fighting for an NHL job right away (VAN or EDM), or potentially having a chance to start winning right away (Us or NYR). If we get him then I think Lehner more or less becomes expendable and we definitely trade him. Assuming EDM doesn't get him, I wouldn't mind seeing something like Lehner, Cowen, Chiasson, one of Prince, Puempel, or Paul, and maybe a second or third round pick heading to EDM in exchange for Hall/Eberle, and Nikita Nikitin. That way EDM get's a ton of young players plus picks, and they get rid of a bad contract in Nikitin. It may not be ideal for EDM, but with people like Draisatl, Nurse, and now McDavid waiting in the wings, all of whom are supposed to be at least solid NHL players, there's no way they can go onwards with 18 million tied up in Hall, Eberle, and RNH. They're eventually going to have to do what Pittsburgh did when they had Crosby, Malkin, Letang, and Fleury on big money deals, and no room left for a very good player in James Neal and his 5 million dollar cap hit"
OttawaSenators,342w0e,lotio,4,Wed Apr 29 14:45:36 2015 UTC,"Been a fan of the Off-Season Game Plan series by Scott Cullen for quite a while. With Ottawa just bowing out, I don't expect the Sens edition for a month at the very least. With Cullen alluding to Buffalo being an ideal landing spot for Lehner, I thought it'd be fun to discuss the merits of a deal.   Throw in Greening instead of Condra? What if Lehner becomes the goalie we all thought he'd be?"
OttawaSenators,342w0e,avanross,18,Mon Apr 27 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"I can all but guarantee that if we trade him, Lehner will become that goalie"
OttawaSenators,342w0e,JumpedAShark,2,Mon Apr 27 23:13:10 2015 UTC,I think we've passed the point where Greening and Condra have the same value in the eyes of NHL GMs.
OttawaSenators,342w0e,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:00:05 2015 UTC,"You can't trade Condra, because he's a UFA. Also Sens would have to sign Hammond (who's a UFA) to replace Lehner, and there's no guarantee Hammond will resign here for what the team offers.   Lehner would be the sugar needed for Buffalo to accept Greening and that contract, we wouldn't get much of anything back.   I'd be happy if we could target Grigorenko in return. He's got plenty of skills but got jerked around by Buffalo. Hopefully his trade value is ruined but can be salvaged like Turris."

OttawaSenators,342w0e,Chili_Palmer,2,Tue Apr 28 08:15:10 2015 UTC,"The last thing we need is more prospects and as for weber I think we could get better for lehner and condra. What we need is a top 6 forward like Eberle I think a deal with Edmonton  would be way more beneficial for both teams. That being said I'd say trade Hammond instead of lehner just based on his ahl and playoff performance, i say trade him while his value is high."
OttawaSenators,342w0e,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:27:01 2015 UTC,Hoping if Chiarelli does decide to trade Eberle he'll make a courtesy call to GMBM giving him first refusal. A guy can dream right?
OttawaSenators,342w0e,BoobieRyan,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:06:24 2015 UTC,"Eberle is entirely overrated and overpaid.   I'd rather have Hoffman/Stone/Mac all in the top 6 for under 4 mill each than be paying Eberle 7 million or whatever ridiculous amount he earns for his 65 points a year. We're already overpaying for that once with Bobby Ryan.  This team needs defensemen, and a bonafide top line center.   Gryba and Boro were hideous in the playoffs, we need them gone. These guys are late 20's, they're not going to get any better and their best isn't good enough. If we have to pay to get a couple guys who can skate and hit, then they should do it.  EK, Ceci, Weir are great puck movers, Methot is a great compliment. We need compliments for the other two."
OttawaSenators,342w0e,mike-kt,0,Tue Apr 28 11:49:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything except Eberle makes $6m a year, and 65 points is pretty good production. Also I see Turris as a #1 centre, but it would be nice to get another great centre, why not?"
OttawaSenators,342w0e,BoobieRyan,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:49:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel like with his ever-increasing point production and physicality, Zibanejad is a future 1st-liner, if not already. He seems to be able to handle it. I would love Eberle to compliment him, and we could have a legitimately potent 1st line, and an arguably WAY above-average second line. With the grinder/still good 3rd line and a chipping 4th line, we would have very, VERY good offense. For the first time since the CASH line, we could have a truly ""elite"" 1st line, like most other teams.   Ryan-Zibanejad-Eberle MacA-Turris-Stone Lazar-Pageau-Condra Michalek-Rookie-Rookie   All we would need is a true 2nd pairing D-man to compliment either Ceci or Wiercioch (think roughly the same level as Jeff Petry, Cody Franson or Erhoff) and we have a legitimate cup contender, imho. Also, perhaps we could bump up Wideman for a 3rd pairing role? Ceci and Wiercioch could be interchangeable and roll sort of a 2a and 2b pairings, or even keep WeirdAppendage and Ceci together. Think along the lines of:   Karlsson-Methot Wiercioch-(2nd pairing acquisition) Ceci-Wideman   I would be okay with giving away something like Hoffman + Lehner for Eberle + (insert prospect/rookie?). I feel like while Hoff is a truly skilled forward, he might not get much more production out of him than he got this year and he doesn't fit as well as we thought. He could be worth A LOT after this season and it could be worth it to look into it, at least."
OttawaSenators,342w0e,hoopopotamus,2,Wed Apr 29 05:59:05 2015 UTC,"I think Hoffman + Lehner for Eberle is a great deal for the Sens, I'm not sure that can get it done.   Sens have enough ammo for one trade at most, why go after a winger? Why not Defence? If they can trade for a good defender and sign another one, why not do that? They have decent forward depth right now, and who knows how well Wideman or Claesson would do?"
OttawaSenators,342w0e,relapsingoncemore,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"Hoffman + Lehner + 2nd?  At the beginning of the season I thought we only had one good pairing but it's becoming evident that Ceci + Wiercioch are something great, and they will only get better. We could use a 3rd pairing shutdown guy to go with Boro, though, I think. Someone who can go after a puck, retrieve it, and clear it when we need him to. (cough Cowen cough)  After we improve our 1st line to elite status, with Andy/Hammond in net, we have a legitimate cup contender."

OttawaSenators,342w0e,Valentine96,3,Mon Apr 27 23:18:15 2015 UTC,Just because he plays on the 4th line doesn't mean he doesn't get big minutes.  I think he was 4th in ice time for forwards against MTL?
OttawaSenators,342w0e,InTURRISting,2,Tue Apr 28 01:12:29 2015 UTC,Lines are shifted all the time for different scenarios. What I meant is that there's no way he's fourth on their depth chart.

He turned the Habs powerplay into a complete non-factor, him and Condra (and Lazar to a lesser extent) generated so much pressure that they had no business generating. That 3rd line was top notch.

OttawaSenators,342q9h,Hoxtilicious,5,Mon Apr 27 21:07:49 2015 UTC,"Draft rankings are still based on the regular season standings except for the teams that make the semi-finals. This means that we will draft 18th unless Calgary beats Anaheim, in which case we'll draft 17th. (Calgary - Minnesota Western Finals anyone?)  There are some players who I'm really hoping drop, these include Meier, Rantanen, and Connor. Konecny, Chabot, and Werenski are some other players that could be available when we're drafting. For some reason we do really well when we draft in the middle of the round, so I'm excited for who we'll pick up.  I also hope we pick up both Sebastian Aho's in the later rounds."
OttawaSenators,342q9h,TorinK92,3,Mon Apr 27 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"That's gonna suck for the crap Sebastian Aho when the good Sebastian Aho is drafted.  edit : whoa nevermind, they're both pretty good.

Thanks for mentioning that, for some reason I always thought it was round-by-round, such that there were 4 ordered tiers of playoff teams. Never realized it was divided like that."
OttawaSenators,342q9h,Omega613,2,Tue Apr 28 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"I also hope we pick up both Sebastian Aho's in the later rounds.   What's the story on them? I've heard slight murmurs, but nothing really of their play. I think the only thing that's brought them to my attention are article pointing out the name coincidence. But clearly they're both fairly highly rated, and unlikely to go undrafted this year if he ranking are anything to go by."
OttawaSenators,342q9h,TorinK92,3,Tue Apr 28 00:43:29 2015 UTC,"High risk medium reward flashy forwards who are always going to go in the later rounds. They're both small (~ 5'10, 170 lbs) which can be a problem for kids coming from Scandinavia. They're also not ranked too highly, 13th and 18th in Europe this year is likely 4th-5th round at the earliest.  A team like us or Detroit who can work wonders for Scandinavian late rounders could possibly turn them into NHL'ers, but they're nowhere near ready for the North American game,  and it's not likely that they'd eventually turn into stars."
OttawaSenators,342q9h,TotoroZoo,2,Tue Apr 28 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"I liked the thought of him too. Perfect mentor in Karl, and we have the guy we crafted last year second round for a bruiser shut down partner who is also Swedish. Just get the future Swedish Olympic team for our defence corps."
OttawaSenators,342q9h,hoopopotamus,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"he's not even that small from what I've read.  6 feet doesn't exactly put him in Gaudreau territory.  But they have his weight at 180, so he's basically Karlsson's size"
OttawaSenators,342q9h,beekermc,2,Tue Apr 28 03:21:40 2015 UTC,I don't care who we draft for the first 5 rounds. It's that 6th rounder I'm going to have my eye on!
OttawaSenators,342q9h,Omega613,2,Wed Apr 29 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"For everyone's reference, here's central scouting's draft rankings. I also know a user who has something relevant in the works for this exact topic ;)  I think broadly speaking, the Sens could use help at almost any position, so drafting ""the best player available"" seems like a perfectly reasonable strategy. If there's any priority in my mind, it's centermen and Dmen (esp. Right handed D), since we have very few high end prospects in the system at those positions now unless there are some unexpected developments from late round picks (our best are Prince, LW/C; Puempel, LW; Lindberg, RW; Grant, C/LW & UFA; Paul, LW/C; Claesson, LD; Wideman, RD & UFA, and none are real blue chip type prospect, more like middle-6 ceilings.).  I've heard good things about Konecny, Svechnikov, and Meier, who might be available where we're drafting. Some of the international skaters like Rantanen, Carlsson, and Kylington might be available and woefully underrated/under scouted in such a deep year. I would especially like us to explore using 1 or maybe even both of our 2nd round picks on some international guys on the above basis that they're likely being overlooked by the wealth of domestic talent being scouted, and we seem to have some good international scouts.   On a related note, does anyone know how/why Kylington dropped from 1st in international skaters to 4th in a few months? That's a huge drop, and I've never understood exactly what happened outside of a small injury (causing him to miss the WJs)."
OttawaSenators,342q9h,JumpedAShark,3,Tue Apr 28 00:21:06 2015 UTC,"I think Konecny might drop to our around our spot. I've heard good things and it would make sense since we know Murray likes drafting guys from the 67s when he can. He was apparently incredible before his draft year so I'm banking on him finding his form again.  Only issue I see is Murray thinking we need to invest in defense now rather than forwards. Not saying it's a bad idea, but I'd rather take the best player available than look to fill the need."
OttawaSenators,342q9h,captainduck2,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:41:36 2015 UTC,In the later rounds I'd love to see us pick the Poehling brothers. I watched them heavily this year.

OttawaSenators,3429ns,shanely,8,Mon Apr 27 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"I can say, with 100% confidence, that I have no idea what our goalie situation is going to look like come puck drop in October."
OttawaSenators,3429ns,mralexjt,6,Mon Apr 27 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yup. I said it elsewhere, but our goalie situation feels as though there is no right answer, but also no way we can go wrong (except obviously there are).  Anderson is getting older, but has proven he's still solid (at least in the playoffs?)  Hammond won our hearts, and deserves a shot after all he did for us, but is he capable of maintaining anywhere near that level of play?  Lehner feels like the odd man out, but he's very young and has tons of potential, so it doesn't seem like the right decision to offload him.  Seriously.   Keep Andy & Hammy: Elite starter, solid backup. Gives Hammy a chance to surpass him in the coming years, but Lehner could go off and surpass them both (or amount to nothing).  Keep Andy & Lehner: Elite starter, project backup. Keep Lehner & hope he develops like we want him to, but chopping Hammond would feel completely heartless, and he could end up showing everyone that he wasn't lightning in a bottle.  Keep Hammond & Lehner: The younger duo giving us more years in the future, but neither have proven that they are long term answers. Could get a nice return from trading Anderson, but we could just as easily be left without a true #1 goaltender.  This is what I mean. Each option feels possible, each has their advantages, but none of them feel ""right."""
OttawaSenators,3429ns,MichelangeBro,2,Mon Apr 27 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. The extra complication here is that apparently GMBM is pursuing O'Connor. I suppose if O'Connor is in, that means Lehner is out."
OttawaSenators,3429ns,Zigur,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:53:38 2015 UTC,I feel like it'd be a strange decision to get rid of a 23-year old goalie (who's been highly touted) with almost 100 NHL games experience for a 21-year old free agent just out of college.
OttawaSenators,3429ns,JumpedAShark,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was shocked to learn we had been pursuing O'Connor. Perhaps there are other reasons why management thinks Lehner won't work out here? I really hope it's not due to his injury being more serious than we have been lead to believe."
OttawaSenators,3429ns,Zigur,8,Tue Apr 28 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"I think that they let Hammond walk. Lehner is probably untradeable, and I think that Anderson is still too good of a goalie to trade, so that leaves Hammond out. Not that the Hamburglar didn't play great, but I think a lot of the Sens' awesome run was that Cameron was finally icing as close to an optimal lineup as possible, as well as the play of Stone and Hoffman.   I also think that Greening gets bought out in the offseason, and that they let Gryba walk."
OttawaSenators,3429ns,SirZapdos,3,Mon Apr 27 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"I think Hammond is more valuable to Ottawa than to any other team. Who would invest in him? He played lights out for a month, good but not great for another month, and then the playoffs happened."

OttawaSenators,3429ns,mike-kt,2,Mon Apr 27 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"Now it's not like I know the guy, but looking at Ottawa's log jam in net what free agent is really going to sign here? He maybe has a chance at the AHL starting job?    Only thing I could see is the organization saying, look, we're not going to rush you, and we'll have Wamsley make you into an NHL goaltender."
OttawaSenators,3429ns,FixedTheNewelPost,2,Tue Apr 28 01:18:38 2015 UTC,Rumour is they told O'Connor that if he signs here they'll trade one of their goalies.
OttawaSenators,3429ns,mike-kt,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:24:59 2015 UTC,"But then we'd still have (hopefully) 2 goalies in the NHL, so that move seems to be  to make way for his future, rather than put him in the team right away.  IIRC, teams were telling O'Connor that he'd see NHL action before the end of the season if he signed with them. To me, that just means a game or two of experience (i.e. Skapski), not necessarily an NHL job right away."
OttawaSenators,3429ns,TorinK92,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be in the AHL for at least a year, I don't think its a huge problem. At least in the sense that the team can decide to trade a goalie later, depending on how things are going"

OttawaSenators,342rl5,Omega613,6,Mon Apr 27 21:44:59 2015 UTC,Yeah it began when we faced the Sens later in the season. Both had new young goalies that were on a hot streak. And our teams were in similar situations Wild were around 16ish points behind and I think Sens were over like 20ish...
OttawaSenators,342rl5,The_Original_Fett,5,Mon Apr 27 21:52:29 2015 UTC,"The gaps weren't quite that large from a playoff position, but proportionally about right. The Sens set the league record for biggest regular season points deficit overcome (ever) with 14 points out of the final available playoff spot. That said, I think you're right (and perhaps quoting?) the deficits eventually overcome on teams that were eventually passed, because in the above link we were 19 back from the Pens but finished 1 ahead (20 points gained on them), and likely the same idea for the Wild from their lowest point."

OttawaSenators,341bee,CatoDarpa,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:47:51 2015 UTC,"Premiere or Authentic are basically jerseys made by reebok that are game quality.

The numbers are pasted on, not sewn on. as with the names.  Although in my experience they look identical.

OttawaSenators,341lv7,xBarDown,4,Mon Apr 27 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"A quarter of this team's salary goes to replacement level players and we need money to sign Hoffman, Stone, Zibby, Pageau, Condra and probably Hammond. We can easily let Chiasson walk. Over 12M of the teams payroll didn't even play Game 6."
OttawaSenators,341lv7,mike-kt,3,Mon Apr 27 16:23:08 2015 UTC,"Finding a way to get ride of Cowen, Legwand and Smith is pretty important for the team. I assume they'll want to keep Neil, but if they can trade him I'd support it. I think Phillips is untradable, and even if he retires his cap hit stays. Greening is on a one-way trip to buyout city.   If the team wants to really improve, they'll need another good D. It'll be tough to free up enough money for the RFAs let alone another defender, but that's they're biggest weakness.   I'd love for the team to acknowledge they're pretty good up front, ditch the expensive depth players in favour of cheap prospects like Prince, and sign one of the big UFA D (Petry looked good) or put in an offer sheet ($3.5m max) for a player on a cap crunch team."
OttawaSenators,341lv7,shanely,2,Mon Apr 27 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"Woah - I didn't know Methot was making that much. I like him, but is he worth that much of a hit?   Also, do people think Ryan is worth the amount he's being paid?   I'd be fine with freeing up the space that Cowen is taking up. Maybe it's just me - but I've never really seen him do anything too valuable. What happened to him anyways? I don't know the last time I saw him on the ice."
OttawaSenators,341lv7,mike-kt,5,Mon Apr 27 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with Ryan's and Methot's money, there are higher priorities to cut."
OttawaSenators,341lv7,Grizwald,3,Mon Apr 27 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with Methot. The way he plays with Karl is worth it. Ryan, sometimes you have to put up big money to keep a guy like that around on a smaller market team. Couldn't let him walk at the end of the year, and he carried us for the first half of the season."

Montreal had 2 high sticks on the same play.  http://imgur.com/gallery/f8S6xOS/new  I just want to spread the word. Everyone talks about Pageau's misscall but in reality there were 2 bad calls not 1
OttawaSenators,3439na,papaprof,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"I made a lengthy post about this. While the 2nd high stick just before Gallagher scores is debatable (I believe it was a high stick for the record), there's no denying the one Mtl got away with leaving their zone to get that play going in the first place.  I'm more outraged that call was missed than the non-goal."
OttawaSenators,3439na,juggylo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:02:21 2015 UTC,I think that's what I found most disappointing. It didn't feel like the series was solely decided by the play of the two teams involved...
OttawaSenators,3439na,bsaures,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"Thats hockey though! its a lucky sport. We should be more upset that Ottawa didn't show up completely until game 4! Had they played in Game 1, 2 &3 as they did in 4,5,6 they would have won 4-1.  So it sucks they are gone because I know they are the better team. Unfortunately you don't often see a bad call for a goal Ottawa scores and one for Montreal scores in the same game. Ottawa really caught the worst possible luck at the worst possible time.  Also if you count the incredible luckiness of Gallaghers goal which will never happen again. Damn it was an incredible play but my god  was it lucky."
OttawaSenators,3439na,bsaures,0,Tue Apr 28 01:38:15 2015 UTC,Lol @ better team.
OttawaSenators,341dsb,hatcherhullmodano,10,Mon Apr 27 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"this summer the bigger issue isn't getting new pieces, it's getting rid of old ones. there's 16M worth of guys that don't fit on the roster anymore(Phillips, Neil, Legwand, Greening, Cowen).. and then there's the goalie situation.  Maybe we luck out and get some value back out of however we deal with those guys(though unlikely given we spent all year trying to trade them)... but there's also a second wave of prospects that'll be ready come August.. so ya, signing new players is really not a priority"
OttawaSenators,341dsb,Funkativity,3,Mon Apr 27 15:29:55 2015 UTC,"The value is not having them get in the way of signing the real talent. If we only get picks and risky prospects, I'm okay with that.   Though I think we have enough valuable pieces to at least put together one quality trade worth getting really excited about."

OttawaSenators,341dsb,MyNewOldAccount,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:42:33 2015 UTC,I don't know why I found this hilarious. But thank you.
OttawaSenators,341dsb,Omega613,13,Mon Apr 27 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"The top-3 forward I disagree with, the dman I agree with though, but it will be much tougher to find in this market.    In terms of forwards, we very much rely on a scoring by committee/depth strategy rather than have any real stars, but it requires them to really be defensively responsible too. This is basically like the Boston and LA models employed (with great success) for the past several years (before injuries/trades/age/arrests began to take their toll for them this year).   Our top-6 contains proven ~60 point (give or take a bit) guys like MacArthur, Turris, Stone, and Ryan, plus Hoffman and Zbad are still young (in age or experience, respectively), and put up just under 50 points already. Perfectly good depth compared to Boston/LA, and aside from MacA/Ryan, all those guys are 25 or younger or rookies so there's room to grow. Plus they're nearly all two-way capable guys as well. All these players are signed long-term or are RFAs, which is great news. We also have Michalek in our bottom-6, who's a really serviceable option in case of top-6 injuries as he's become a much better forechecker with better defensive positioning in the past couple seasons, and if needed in a top-6 role he's easily capable of a 35-50 point pace still.  Our third line by year's end was Condra-Pageau-Lazar. The former two were ~30 point (pace) players with amazing defensive awareness and almost comical physicality given their relative stature in this league. Lazar's point production was a slightly lower, but he's only 20 and has shown plenty of offensive at other levels. Little doubt he won't be a 30-40 point (capable) defensive specialist in a couple years, and already doesn't look out of place in the NHL. Pageau is also only 22, so he has more room to grow, perhaps having near 40-point ceiling once established, and he's managed those points so far against the opposition's top lines and/or while short-handed (likewise for Condra, but he's not at an age where we would expect more growth).  The problem with our forward depth is our fourth line. Later in the season once it was ironed out, it was rarely bad, but it was a complete non-factor most nights. Very little offense, and mostly average defense, but usually had to be matched against easier competition or given favourable zone starts. Michalek looks fine there and as said above he provides to injury depth, but usual the combinations of Legwand/Smith(C) with Chiasson/Neil(RW) just didn't do much. We do have a lot of internal options to mix things up on this line to add some skill, like Grant, Puempel, and Prince, so hopefully that's explored for next year.  In summary with our forwards, we're getting some good production from our current group. In the latter half of the season we were generating over 3 goals per game and playing some great two-way hockey. Infusing that with perhaps another 30-50 point depth guy (like Michalek) wouldn't be a bad move, but that's what Legwand was brought in for without much success, so internal options might be better. We managed all that with some key guys being in their early 20's and some injuries, so if there's anything we desperately need, it's another year or two worth of development. That's not to say an elite game-breaking forward wouldn't improve our group, but it could change our forward group for the worse, and if acquired through trade chances are high that we would sacrifice our depth to pull of that trade, which I fear wouldn't be worth it in the long run (we would have to draft/develop that talent if anything).  On D, Methot-Karlsson is a perfect top pair. Methot realistically should a 2nd pairing player, but Karlsson is so good and their chemistry allows for the Methot to be a perfect ""#2"" compliment for EK. Our 2nd pair later in the season was pretty good, albeit inexperienced and arguably should've been better sheltered. Wiercioch, once given a chance and time to get into a routine, was an excellent 2nd pairing guy. He still has lots to learn and could really work on his skating over the summer, but he moves the puck well with some excellent passing and is a possession monster (he also has a great habit of scoring goals in key situations, all of them this year being game winners or late game tying goals). Ceci shows a great many signs of being a top-4 guy soon, with a solid hybrid skill set. My only knock on him is that some nights he just looks like he's in over his head, but that's just the inexperience of being a 21 year old dman in the NHL, and he's not exactly playing with a veteran who can cover these mistakes. And he has his fair share of really good nights too, so for now it's give-and-take, but hopefully soon mostly just ""give"". Our bottom pair though has been pretty bad most nights on the whole. Decent shot blockers/penalty killers with some physical edge, but that's about it. Physciality is great, but when almost every player on your roster is throwing hits it's suddenly a lot less important to have ""specialists"" doing that job. Gryba-Boro bring the same basic skillset to the team, to a point that it's redundant and ineffective as a pairing, especially when neither have good puck moving skills (Gryba's above average skating in the closest thing).   In my opinion, our blueline could be fixed with another top-4 (2nd pairing) guy to displace Ceci (or possibly Wiercioch if positionally needed) from the 2nd pair allowing them a more sheltered role on the 3rd pair. That would give us a puck mover to play with Boro, for example. We don't need a star blueliner, just someone who's effective and experienced - I think of guys like Russell (CGY), Hjalmersson (CHI), Goligoski (DAL), or Alzner (WSH) as the type of player we would be on the look out for, although those particular examples are unlikely to be traded. The problem is that top-4 guys like this are in high demand, so their trade values are usually inflated, as are their free-agent signing costs. If push comes to shove, one internal option would be to re-sign (hopefully) and bring up Chris Wideman. He would likely start on our third pair beside Boro, but could possibly even displace Ceci in the short term. It's riskier, but might be more worthwhile than overpaying for an externally sourced player.  Goalies? We're good thanks :P  So all-in-all, our roster needs some tweaking, no doubt, and with basically 15 forwards, 8 dmen, and 3 goalies (26 players) on the roster there will be some movement. But down the stretch things really came together, we weren't good just because of luck (outside of the occasional night), we were a legitimately good team with our current roster. There's not much reason to make any big moves, an extra year or two for the young guys to develop plus a couple tweaks/trimming-of-fat will suffice to make this a very capable playoff contender :)"
OttawaSenators,341dsb,mike-kt,2,Mon Apr 27 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of D options around the league. If the Sens prioritized it, I'm sure they could grab one of the big UFA D this summer. One of Petry, Franson, Sekera would really help, but if they want to earn $5m it'll be tough.   A lot of teams are going to have cap problems, so if the Sens are able to get rid of their problems (big ask), they'll be able to make some deals.   Also I don't have a problem with the idea of a Wideman-Ceci 3rd pairing (Boro as a 7th). I'm fine with skill throughout the lineup, and it would be really neat to have a 3rd pairing able to skate or pass the puck out of the zone to help the forwards out. Chipping the puck out just doesn't work."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,Omega613,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"so if the Sens are able to get rid of their problems (big ask)   That's going to be the big goal this summer. If they can rid themselves of half their our over-priced contracts even with minimal other moves, we should consider that a success going into September. We don't really need any big blockbusters. And given how much we emptied the prospect pool in the past year or two, I imagine picks and prospects (rather than roster players) will be the priority for return.   I think guys like Cowen, Smith, Chiasson, and even Neil/Legwand won't be to hard to move if we're not asking much, the tough part is going to be appropriate asset management (some of those guys being more/less likely to move, of course). Just because Cowen doesn't fit our roster and we (the fans) don't particularly like him doesn't mean he should be shipped off for a 7th rounder, or something. He was a 9th overall pick and is still young enough to be considered to have not peaked in his development. If we're not recycling a notable portion of his value then you eventually end up like the Leafs.   Then again, if another team decides to offer sheet Stone and/or Zbad, we may have little choice. We can certainly match those offer sheets, but we'll likely have to follow up by trading guys like Cowen for much less."

OttawaSenators,341dsb,ProblemOfficer,3,Mon Apr 27 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"Our forward corps, other than the 4th line, is just fine. We need to find a top 4 to knock Ceci down to the 3rd pairing for awhile for more seasoning. Ceci's a stud, but needs a bit more time."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,peskysens,2,Mon Apr 27 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"our top-3 is Ryan. He was injured and not playing even remotely close to his potential. A healthy ryan and our top6 is set.   Mac-Turris-Stone Hoff-Zibby-Ryan  As for our D, this to me is our biggest issue. Meth, Karlsson, Ceci are good solid players. Weir, Gryba, Boro, Cowen are all unproven and or bottom rung players. I think Cowen has potential but the team seems to have given up on him. Boro is a great bottom pairing  energy guy. Gryba is meh. And Weir turned it on at the end so he will get another shot. I think if Ottawa can sign our UFA's/RFA's and maybe snag a free agent D to come in we will be set.   Phillips, Neil, Greening, Legwand all need to go, Chiassion I would consider trading as well, but he is young and we could give him another shot next season."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,MichelangeBro,2,Mon Apr 27 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're giving nearly enough credit to Wiercioch. I don't recall him giving too much up, and generated some pretty good offense as well. Over the last few months, I would say he was definitely our 3rd best D-man behind Karlsson & Meth. Ceci looks promising, but still needs time, and I think we'll always find space for Boro in our pairings.  Defensively, I think we need Ceci & Wiercioch to really take the next step, and find someone who can solidly play next to Boro. Offensively, we pretty much need a new 4th line. I like Puempel, and could definitely see him coming into the mix in the next season or two, but besides that, I don't really know.  Our top line of Mac-Turris-Stone is amazing, the Hoff-Zbad-Ryan line is great (even if it got cold at the end), the Lazar-Pageau-Condra line is 100% solid as a third line, it's really just the 4th that doesn't have an identity.   Then we have the goaltender situation. The more I think about it, the more there seems to be no right answer, and yet no way to go wrong. Do we get rid of Hammond when we have no idea whether or not he can live up to this past season? Would anyone even be willing to take that chance? And Lehner is super young, which a lot of people seem to forget. Anderson has shown that he definitely still has it, but he's getting older, and his play wasn't always stellar during the regular season.  Honestly, I have no goddamn clue what to do with our G's, and I'm glad that I'm not the one to make that call. My heart wants Hammy, my brain says Andy, but there's no way I want to send Lehner off so soon either."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,mike-kt,3,Mon Apr 27 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"You're right, Wiercioch is really good. For parts of this past series I've thought he was performing better than Methot (even though they have different strengths)."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,MichelangeBro,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:09:19 2015 UTC,"Last game especially, I thought he was outplaying Methot. Methot is definitely the guy that Karlsson has the best chemistry, so that shouldn't be messed with. But I'm pretty sure I heard that Patty had more ice time than Meth last night.  Sometimes, Methot can get a little too ""into"" a play. He's taken some pretty dumb penalties in the past, and he can get too physical after the play. Wiercioch is just a solid player. I like him a lot."

OttawaSenators,341dsb,chumpawumpa69,2,Mon Apr 27 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"We've needed an experienced, veteran defenceman since we let Sergei Gonchar go.  Not that Gonch at this point would fill that role, but someone like him."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,mike-kt,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"Methot is the veteran now, and Karlsson's already played a bunch of seasons.   Pretty good shot Jason Smith and Chris Phillips will be working/on the team next year, so I wouldn't worry about veteran help."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,peskysens,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:10:25 2015 UTC,Does Prince jump to the second line with Z-Bad and Ryan?  Does Paul go to the A or straight to the NHL?
OttawaSenators,341dsb,mike-kt,3,Mon Apr 27 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"Prince is going to have to prove a lot to make the team next season. Unless we can move Greening, Legwand, Neil and maybe Chiasson there isn't going to be a free spot for him. Not to mention he is no where near 1/2line calibre yet. He had an ok call up but nothing worth top line minutes.  Paul will go to Bingo, and will get exhibition call up to see if he can make the team but just like Prince (or any one in bingo) they are going to need to be outstanding to make the roster. If we are stuck with our old vets there is no room on the roster. Guys like Stone, Hoff, Pageau and Lazar are not going to get sent back down again."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,peskysens,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"Paul has to prove he can score in the pros, I have real worries he'll be at best a 4th line player in the NHL. Hopefully he's a late bloomer who's still getting used to a recent grown spurt."
OttawaSenators,341dsb,mike-kt,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:11:19 2015 UTC,Like Hoffman :)
OttawaSenators,341dsb,Lanhdanan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:37:09 2015 UTC,"But Hoffman was lighting up the AHL, that's very different than Paul's play at his age in the OHL.   Hoffman's 20 year old season in the OHL - 85 points in 56 games. Paul's 20 year old season in the OHL - 66 points in 58 games.   Hoffman also consistantly scored in junior, whereas this is Paul's first really productive season.   Maybe Paul is better at other aspects of the game, but he will have to be way better to have the same value that Hoffman has had this season.  Very different players."

Sometimes the bounces just don't go your way and to Price's credit, against him you need all the bounces you can get. Anderson was the same way this series, which is why that 1-0 score line was so appropriate."

OttawaSenators,33z8ce,go_sens,11,Mon Apr 27 01:35:30 2015 UTC,Tsn 1200: rule 38.4 viii allows for NHL review on a blown whistle :(
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,goost0852,6,Mon Apr 27 03:24:27 2015 UTC,I don't know the exact definition of the rule but I feel it is to review when a whistle was blown rather than whether a whistle was deserved
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,bendermcduster,2,Mon Apr 27 02:04:21 2015 UTC,rule is really up for interpreatation. Check it
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,goost0852,2,Mon Apr 27 02:47:13 2015 UTC,"rule 38.4 viii   The video review process shall be permitted to assist the Referees in  determining the legitimacy of all potential goals (e.g. to ensure they  are “good hockey goals”). For example (but not limited to), pucks that  enter the net by going through the net meshing, pucks that enter the  net from underneath the net frame, pucks that hit the spectator  netting prior to being directed into the goal, pucks that enter the net  undetected by the Referee, etc. This would also include situations  whereby the Referee stops play or is in the process of stopping the  play because he has lost sight of the puck and it is subsequently  determined by video review that the puck crosses (or has crossed)  the goal line and enters the net as the culmination of a continuous  play where the result was unaffected by the whistle (i.e., the timing of  the whistle was irrelevant to the puck entering the net at the end of a  continuous play).   Should have been reviewed... Might have stood as it might not be considered a ""continuous play"" whatever that means.  If it means that the puck went in through it's own momentum then no, no goal, but if you think that Pageau tapping it in is a ""Continuous play"" then, yeah, good goal.  It really depends what continuous play means."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,bradnakata,2,Mon Apr 27 02:53:45 2015 UTC,"http://www.tsn.ca/c-mon-ref-explaining-sens-disallowed-goal-1.268079   While it might seem all too logical to assume that the quick whistle had no effect on what Price did (or did not do) in an to attempt to cover the puck, the separate and distinct action by Pageau to knock the puck into the net is not deemed to be a ""continuous play"" in the application of this review process."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,j0yb0y,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:37:52 2015 UTC,If they had at least reviewed it I would have been happy.
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,goost0852,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:14:28 2015 UTC,I feel like neither the ref nor Cameron knew about the updated rules this year for specifically this scenario. They absolutely could and should've reviewed it.  I'm fine with refs making mistakes. That's life. But what's the point in adding a new rule if nobody uses it when it matters most?
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,epwnym,0,Mon Apr 27 16:03:50 2015 UTC,The rule was specifically modified for this season for this scenario (and others).   The new expanded rule will also allow Hockey Operations to provide guidance to referees on goal and potential goal plays where the referee has blown his whistle (or intended to blow his whistle) after having lost sight of the puck.
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,epwnym,11,Mon Apr 27 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"ok not fuck chris lee, i understand the call and it's an honest mistake but FUCK WHAT A SHITTY WAY TO GO OUT. i want to cry right now."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,elementsix,13,Mon Apr 27 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing to cry about. We made it this far. We were down 3-0 in the series with one goal preventing us to force a game 7. Our run to the playoffs was amazing, if not legendary.  Look forward to next season, we will be stronger. For now, pick a team for the run to the cup and support them!"
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,confirm_it_first,7,Mon Apr 27 01:07:56 2015 UTC,yeah... let's go wild... :'(
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,epwnym,2,Mon Apr 27 01:53:40 2015 UTC,"Hell, our run to the playoffs was the best in NHL history.  This team has accomplished some great things... Hope to see the same spark in the fall next year."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,Quattro5,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, I am saying fuck Chris Lee. Not because he made an early whistle. Honest mistake (although wtf was he doing sitting in the corner instead of getting in close?).  But because he didn't even know the new rules for this season about requesting a review for an obvious premature whistle."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,TheBatman69,10,Mon Apr 27 10:56:23 2015 UTC,Guys....when the whistle sounds....everyone stops playing. Especially the goalie.
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,epwnym,3,Mon Apr 27 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"watch it again, nobody stopped playing. it's a reviewable call since this year and they didn't even review it."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,bradleylauchlin,20,Mon Apr 27 01:34:43 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have been overturned tho, because the shot that lead to the goal was taken after the whistle was blown. It would only have been overturned had the original shot (taken before the whistle) lead to the puck crossing the line, after the whistle."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,Quattro5,-4,Mon Apr 27 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't have. The announcement of the rule change makes that clear.   The new expanded rule will also allow Hockey Operations to provide guidance to referees on goal and potential goal plays where the referee has blown his whistle (or intended to blow his whistle) after having lost sight of the puck.   It has nothing to do with being a single shot."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,bradleylauchlin,-2,Mon Apr 27 03:05:03 2015 UTC,The whistle was less than a second before the puck went in. No NHL class goalie (especially one of Price's calibre) ever takes the chance of not covering a puck unless the whistle sounded while it was no where near them.
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,housewife_hell,10,Mon Apr 27 17:57:36 2015 UTC,I would say more than a second. A second in this case is a long time.
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,TotoroZoo,5,Mon Apr 27 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"Evan at a second goalies always play it safe and cover. My point is that there is no way that price just ""decided"" not to try and cover that puck. He is the goalie I respect most in the league and he always plays it safe."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,Yolocost,4,Mon Apr 27 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"He thought he had it, that's the only reason he didn't move."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,grizrr,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:45:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed, If you look at the replay he clearly never makes an effort to retrieve the puck."

OttawaSenators,33z8ce,Fuoconator,2,Mon Apr 27 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"I generally hate blaming refs for deciding a game, but damn... that first goal was clearly a high stick before he touched it again and it should've been blown down, then the no-goal... that's just a shame. That is not the way to end a series.  The most frustrating thing: A Habs fan who watched the game told be it was a 'weird one' and that she didn't even feel that good about the outcome because of some of the refs calls. When a Habs fan is having second thoughts about referee calls... yeah. 'Nuff said."

OttawaSenators,33z8ce,thekindlyman555,4,Mon Apr 27 01:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure. He blew the whistle too early. But shit happens man, no control on that"
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,Boroski_74,2,Mon Apr 27 01:50:29 2015 UTC,The worst thing is that it's a reviewable play this season and they didn't even bother to review it...
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,goost0852,-7,Mon Apr 27 01:59:59 2015 UTC,Yeah? They don't go by the whistle anymore?
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,thekindlyman555,10,Mon Apr 27 02:06:57 2015 UTC,"Official rule change as of this season:   Rule 38.4 (viii) has been modified to allow broader discretion to Hockey Operations to assist the referees in determining the legitimacy of all potential goals (e.g., to ensure they are ""good hockey goals"").

The new expanded rule will also allow Hockey Operations to provide guidance to referees on goal and potential goal plays where the referee has blown his whistle (or intended to blow his whistle) after having lost sight of the puck.   So that play should have been reviewed and overturned.... but for whatever reason they didn't..."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,newfiegoalie,9,Mon Apr 27 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"The problem with the play is that it wasn't a no goal call. It was whistle blown for a (presumably) frozen puck. Yes, he did wave off the goal after, but the initial call was frozen puck, a non-reviewable call."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,Boroski_74,2,Mon Apr 27 02:20:40 2015 UTC,Ref did wave his hands saying no goal though.....aka no goal call
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,thekindlyman555,2,Mon Apr 27 02:45:58 2015 UTC,The new expanded rule will also allow Hockey Operations to provide guidance to referees on goal and potential goal plays where the referee has blown his whistle (or intended to blow his whistle) after having lost sight of the puck.   Did you read the rule?  It's also been applied in the regular season.  There's no way to get around it: this should have been a good goal. The refs should have sent it to review and the call would have been overturned.
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,CoolstorySteve,3,Mon Apr 27 03:50:29 2015 UTC,I know you're sore and all but in that play you linked the puck was through the goalie when the play was blown and the puck then went in. In this game the puck was blown before the player even shot the puck. Yes it was a blown call but you're just reaching for strings on this one and that example is a poor one
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,freisenburger,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think they need to change the wording. I pull from this that the play couldn't be reviewed because the puck was ""frozen"" Idk, maybe they thought the whistle had an effect on the play and that's why it wasn't reviewed. If I'm interpreting the rule wrong then yes it needs to be reviewed. But i understand it as though he didn't lose sight of the puck, rather he thought Price had a handle on it."
OttawaSenators,33z8ce,SirZapdos,0,Mon Apr 27 03:27:10 2015 UTC,potential goal plays where the referee has blown his whistle (or intended to blow his whistle)   The rule says it explicitly. I don't know why you are having such a hard time with this...

The cocksucking was hard enough to listen to all series but to hear about how dominant he was for hours and hours afterward sucks. He wasn't perfect. He allowed a shitty goal. He was the second best goalie in this series.   Fuck Price. Fuck Subban. Fuck Gallagher. Fuck Prust. Fuck.

OttawaSenators,33z8aw,Jthedude17,6,Mon Apr 27 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"Time to reflect on a wonderful back half to a season that many, including myself, thought was over long ago. We were offered two straight months of ""playoff hockey"" and making it into the actual playoffs was just the metaphorical cherry on top. It's too bad they ended up getting eliminated, but they never gave up. It has been an incredible run and the resolve and determination shown by these young players has truly been inspiring. How far they have come is nothing short of extraordinary and that never say die attitude they had all along was amazing.  Thank you for the journey, thank you for the memories, and next time over, let's win it all!"

You cannot see anything that occurs on the other side of the goalie where the puck landed. You make you judgement based on what you think happened and the body language of the players on ice. Price thought for sure he had it so the the referee blew it down. You could tell that the ref knew he fucked it up after the play."

OttawaSenators,33z849,TorinK92,12,Mon Apr 27 00:58:06 2015 UTC,"I think firing the ref is a bit extreme, as bad mistakes happen a lot by many refs (although maybe not this bad).

OttawaSenators,33z8b1,JumpedAShark,50,Mon Apr 27 01:26:12 2015 UTC,I'm actually more upset that our not-being-shut-out streak ends on a game where we actually scored.

OttawaSenators,33z8b1,detroyer,-3,Mon Apr 27 03:37:39 2015 UTC,What? It was 2-0.
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,juggylo,7,Mon Apr 27 10:14:09 2015 UTC,Pageau tied the game when it was 1-0 in the second but the ref had just blown the whistle early because he thought Price had it..

We had a great season and I'd say our guys aren't quite ready for prime time.  We got down 3-0 and made a good fight of it, but next year Cameron has to instill attention to detail.  I've enjoyed this team more than any other team I've followed (maybe excepting 2007).  I'd rather have our future than Montreal's and this group's going to do great things."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,chumpawumpa69,0,Mon Apr 27 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"The future is bright for these kids, and hopefully with a couple years of playoffs, they're going to have a ton of experience.   Also, a goalie trade to the Oilers for Draisaitl also might help."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,TheKandyCinema,12,Mon Apr 27 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"Even though all this happened, we can all appreciate how our captain played over half the game and the entire third period. Leaders lead from the front I guess."

OttawaSenators,33z8b1,AlmostArab,36,Mon Apr 27 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, we aren't a cup contender yet. Not really. Beating the Habs in a 7 game series was doable since they're not terribly strong outside of Price (look at their stats and forwards, in particular). Overcoming DET/TBL in the 2nd round, extremely unlikely, but not impossible I suppose. But even if we managed that, we'd have to make it through one of the Rangers/Caps/Isles, and then the top Western team (Wild/Chicago/Ducks likely).   Our time will come, our core is still crazy young, and an extra year of development for Stone/Hoff/Page/Lazar/Ceci/Wier/etc. and a more stable coaching situation will only help. Our run was incredible, but it wasn't just on the back of luck. We were a seriously good team for long stretches, and we can still get better. If anything, Cup or not, that should be unbelievably exciting for Murray if he steps down this summer."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Omega613,2,Mon Apr 27 01:17:00 2015 UTC,"If we ditch Legwand and Smith and call up another prospect (Dunn, De Costa or anyone who plays centre and is open for improvement) then we'll be set next year since we'll be relieved of that 3 million contract for a depth player."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,benches48,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"Dunn was basically let go by his QMJHL team this season, he was that bad/toxic. He may never play professional hockey for us, especially at an NHL level. Da Costa isn't ours to control any more, to my knowledge, as he left this season to play in the KHL and will likely remain there until at least our rights expire. Despite our centre depth being very good in the NHL, we're pretty low on prospect who are NHL-ready now/soon. Fortunately, we could also put Lazar in the 4C spot and instead plan to replace his RW spot (eg: Prince-Pageau-Condra), or Prince has C capability too.   The only true centre prospect of note is Derek Grant, and fortunately he would make a good 4th line C. Unfortunately he's a UFA this summer, so we need to re-sign him to make that happen. Very good at faceoffs too, apparently, which would be a big asset for our team."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Omega613,2,Mon Apr 27 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"Faceoffs are normally a Sens strong point, but the series with Montreal really exploited that, we had a few guys who kept close to 50% but no real aces. We could use a legit faceoff allstar. Hopefully Pageau or someone can dedicate time to mastering them this year."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,zdelusion,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"Faceoffs are normally a Sens strong point   ""Normally"" as in historically, or in this year's regular season? Historically yes, and one of the biggest reasons was Spezza being a prominent centre for us for a decade, and he was routinely very good. But if the latter, no, we weren't normally good this season. Kyle Turris was our only C to manage >50% on the draws, and even he was only 50.1%. Overall, we were 24th in the league at 48.2%, and by contrast Montreal was 4th in the league at 52.1%. In fact, we were below average in every faceoff situation. Those numbers roughly translated into the playoffs as well, with Montreal winning 51.3% of the draws to our 49.7%. Faceoffs aren't a huge part of the game, but they sure help (especially on special teams when gaining possession quickly is key), so hopefully we can at least be nearer average next season, be that someone brought in like Grant, or as you say have Pageau/Turris/Zbad dedicate some serious time to mastering them for when we need an important draw taken :)"
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Omega613,2,Mon Apr 27 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so every other year we've had a ""guy"" who with 30 seconds left in the game you send out to win that draw. Turris is a decent faceoff guy but isn't quite the faceoff ace you need to hold down the 1 goal lead or make that late push. Honestly I hadn't looked at the numbers and they weren't as bad as the series looked imo. There were a lot of clutch draws that we didn't win. Zbad's numbers in particular were lacking though.  Edit: Also looking at the numbers. Holy shit Turris and MacArthur both had 50% of the PIM they had over the entire regular season in 6 playoff games."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,zdelusion,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"Also looking at the numbers. Holy shit Turris and MacArthur both had 50% of the PIM they had over the entire regular season in 6 playoff games.   Yeah, I saw that too, but fortunately the majority of minutes earned were ""after"" the first game ended, presumably in a post-buzzer scrum."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Omega613,2,Mon Apr 27 21:12:33 2015 UTC,Good point bud. Lemme do some reading on Prince and Grant's numbers before I make a full reply.
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,benches48,2,Mon Apr 27 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"Alright, getting back to you now.  Honestly, Prince is the better choice if we were to ditch Leggy and Smith for a draft pick or some depth. Although Grant has played more games in the NHL than Prince, Grant, over the course of 25 NHL games has only recorded 2 points while Prince, over the course of 2 NHL games has recorded 1 point.  Breaking this down into decimals or whatever, this means that Grant has an average of 0.08 points per game while Prince has an average of 0.5 points per game. If anything, call up Prince, since he's younger too and open for more development."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,benches48,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:59:14 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of parity in the East. Honestly, I'm pretty sure any team in the playoffs had a reasonable shot of coming out of the conference. I don't think any team in the East though is going to even be close to keeping up with whoever comes out of the West unless they are beat to absolute shit."

Rough 2nd periods and some tough bounces in OT in games 2&3 ultimately lost us this series. I can't say I'm not a little bit disappointed with the way this series turned out but I'm very proud of the boys for the resilience they've shown over the last 30 games. I look forward to watching the young core talent such as Hoffman, Stone, Pageau, Condra, Lazar, Weircioch and Ceci progress next season and make the sens into a Contender in years to come.

OttawaSenators,33z8b1,HelloYesThisIsDuck,22,Mon Apr 27 02:52:25 2015 UTC,"Habs fan here. I have to congratulate you guys, the Sens have been fucking fantastic not only during their epic run to qualify for the playoffs, but also for their comeback in games 4 and 5. The series was extremely close, and frankly, I think a lot of our success was down to luck more than anything else.  Not entirely happy with the way we played tonight, and the ref definitely robbed you; if not for that bad call, there might have been a game 7, but I'll take the win anyways.  Everyone says Price is the greatest goalie in the world. I definitely agree, but Anderson is not far off!"
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,evilJaze,5,Mon Apr 27 00:57:05 2015 UTC,Price deserves the praise (but not from Healy and constantly) for sure.  I feel the same way though.  Your Habs need to get their offensive shit together or the will be devoured by the Rangers eventually.  GG!
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,HelloYesThisIsDuck,7,Mon Apr 27 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"Unless Kreider decides to run him over like a freight train again this year, I'm not really worried about the Rangers. We held our own pretty well last year, despite having to rely on Tokarski, and we won 2 out of 3 in the regular season.  More worried about Tampa, but I am hoping we face Detroit instead.

OttawaSenators,33z8b1,WildStar81,6,Mon Apr 27 01:15:32 2015 UTC,Helluva season SensBros!!! You're a blast to watch and I'm going to miss you in the postseason. My bracket is pretty messed up without you guys! You're gonna tear it up next year!
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,SkullCrusherXP,4,Mon Apr 27 01:16:58 2015 UTC,"Even if you may think your to sad to watch hockey, I would reccomend watching the Gens Batallion series in the OHL. Great series and we have two top players on each team. Nick Paul, and Tobias Lindberg, both first line players."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,beekermc,5,Mon Apr 27 01:29:15 2015 UTC,Nick Paul is a stud!  And didn't Lindberg get a hattrick in his first playoff game this year?
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Butthisistheinternet,4,Mon Apr 27 01:33:32 2015 UTC,Be proud of our boys.  Every single one of you enjoyed the run we went on to get here.  We're still one of the youngest teams in the league.  Be optimistic about next year.

Had a never give up attitude and and played till the last whistle. Stayed clean when the other team got dirty.  Best team in the league and ambassadors to the sport.
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,markw3456,25,Mon Apr 27 05:48:36 2015 UTC,Like I said in a different thread. Your fans and team just gave me amazing goosebumps with that final salute and cheer. Good luck next year from a Bruins bro. Go Flames go now!  http://imgur.com/mNr4mWT

Going into next year, they will just be better under a full season of Cameron. All these young guys stepping up, I think I heard we have 9 players all under 24. The future is bright!  Until October, go Jays!"

Go Sens, and go /r/OttawaSenators. Our team didn't finish first, but this sub is always no. 1"

It's a tough way to go out, but really, short of hoisting Lord Stanley there's no good way to go out. So fuck it. Nothing changes the fact that I'm so proud of this team and this city, and everything that was accomplished this season.  I have more hope for the future of this team than I've had in as long as I can remember. So much young talent, great personalities, and amazing coaching. We'll be back next year stronger and hungrier than ever. Go Sens, now and always!"
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,var_superUser,4,Mon Apr 27 02:12:16 2015 UTC,"I know it won't help much, but I'm sorry Sensbros. Crap call, really a bummer.   On the upside, you guys were so much fun to watch as a second team this year. Enjoy some time off but then think of all the nasty beatings you'll give the Habs come October!"
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,man_on_hill,5,Mon Apr 27 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"Two of my team's seasons ended tonight: the Senators and the Toronto Raptors. For one, I was so proud and happy for how they fought throughout the season and got into the playoffs overcoming a massive deficit. The other... well the Raptors can fucking perish. Fucking disgusting team. Cheers Ottawa for the amazing season and I hope you guys come back rearing and gunning in October."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,figdaddy125,5,Mon Apr 27 02:53:13 2015 UTC,I'm upset that it's over but I'm also excited to see the team play next season.  (:>)
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,clearsimpleplain,4,Mon Apr 27 02:59:39 2015 UTC,"Man I hated you guys after the 2013 series. I hated Walrus and I hated Anderson. I was all riled up for ugliness and hate going in, but you guys made it impossible. Your players were classy, Karlsson was sexy, and I wish pretty badly I had Ceci on my team. Cameron is great. You've got a great club and I don't hate you guys anymore.  Except Anderson. Because in the playoffs he becomes arguably the best goalie in the league.  Well played, pretty sure you guys are making May next year, and maybe later."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,safewinter,5,Mon Apr 27 03:29:00 2015 UTC,I moved to Canada last year and this was my first ever season watching hockey. I picked the Senators a while back and I'm glad I did. Its been super fun watching this team grind. Hopefully next season they can take it a few steps further.
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,inick565,12,Mon Apr 27 04:05:20 2015 UTC,Well... This CBC post game has only showed Habs interviews. They are even using the Scabs logo to transition. CBC coverage has been a disgrace.

Really wish you guys had won this series after hearing about your GM and asst coach, there's also really no one I dislike on the Sens and I was particularly fond of Macarthur when he was a Leaf. I hope Detroit or tampa destroys these guys"
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Mon Apr 27 00:57:28 2015 UTC,very exciting year! so proud of our boys! this playoff series gives some of the younger guys some needed experience and gives us fans hope for the future.  fuck the habs i hope tampa or detroit kills 'em
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,ChrisAshtear,15,Mon Apr 27 00:59:26 2015 UTC,"That was some fucking bullshit. Absolute disgrace that's how the season ends for the Sens. That ref could have just single-handily affected the outcome of the playoffs. Fuck that shit.   Hell of a run, Ottawa.   GO SENS GO!"
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,ESEADupes,4,Mon Apr 27 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"It's over.   It's hard to believe it is but it is. We had our chances in this game. I think the fact we basically came out fuckin sleepwalking to start the first did us in. That quick whistle was killer but we had some power play chances too but we just didn't get enough traffic in front of Price consistently enough to give him trouble.   I just had a feeling  Price would have a bounce back like this. I dont know why some idiot Ottawa fans were claiming we'd be able to replicate what we did in Game 5 against him. There's no doubt he's the best goalie in the league bar none. He was in Olympic mode tonight and it showed.  I dont think Montreal was all that great overall. Pacioretty was invisible, Subban was very good but I thought he faded after like Game 3 Plekanek was invisible, Gallagher got the goal tonight but he was on and off for them. DSP was really noticeable in the first 2 games for Montreal but he faded as well I thought the rest of the series. They're a decent team but you can see they lean a lot on their goalie to win them games. I don't know if thats how championship teams are made but lets see what else they do in the playoffs.  At the end of the day, they won the series but it was by no means a dominating effort by them. We could have had this had we not gotten in the hole in the series that we did. Losing Game 3 was killer for us to be honest.  But at the end of the day, they won and move on. Congrats to Montreal but more importantly congrats to Price tonight. He put the team on his back and was rock solid"
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Gonzanic,3,Mon Apr 27 02:34:56 2015 UTC,"Congrats and all, but I hope they get eliminated SO FUCKING HARD in the next round."

OttawaSenators,33z8b1,stompinstevo,6,Mon Apr 27 01:29:45 2015 UTC,You guys got shafted by the officials. I'm mind blown how the first goal wasn't whistled down for a high stick and I'm sure you all know what happened on that second goal. Really a fucking disgrace.
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,franken_BEAANNS,4,Mon Apr 27 01:34:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that it might have been a high stick, but not easily discernible.  The disallowed goal, though?  What the fuck? The ref must have been blinding by the thought of gargling Price's balls during the intermission."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Helionix,4,Mon Apr 27 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"The most upsetting thing was that the commissioner was there, and that call was still a thing."

Even the habs fans behind me said they didn't expect another sens fan to call him out. When the habs lose in the bell centre, of course shit will be thrown but guys, were supposed to be the better fans."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,halibb,2,Mon Apr 27 01:13:06 2015 UTC,"Hey boys, Great series the entire series- except game 5- had me pissing and shitting my pants the entire time. I hope you guys will cheer for us! Good game!   Ps. I'm glad Anderson was able to show face- I love when rookies show up veterans but I've always liked Anderson."
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,lotio,7,Mon Apr 27 01:18:52 2015 UTC,I know our fanbases are really contentious but I thought id pop in to say a few things. Ottawa scared the ever loving shit out of all montreal fans. This series was so close. You guys should be absolutely proud of the bright team you have going into next season. Great series.
OttawaSenators,33z8b1,Belcaster,2,Mon Apr 27 01:19:52 2015 UTC,"Hey Everyone,   Just wanted to say what a great game by Kyle and Friends.    It's a shame miracles need to end sometime!  It was even harder to go out on the ice for my own playoff game last night during the sens match, knowing what happened with Pageau, and then have pretty much my game decided by ref too.  BRING ON BALL SEASON and I'll see you all in the FALL with MANY MUCH TURRISES.   :-)  LOTS TO SMILE ABOUT BOYS.  There are like 6/30 teams left who don't want to be the Sens right now."

But all things considered, we weren't even supposed to be in the playoffs. We we're supposed to be able to get back from down 3-0. We weren't supposed to be able to score on Mr. Best Goalie in the World. But we did. We were put down by 2 shitty over time goals, and a shitty non call in game 6. But we kept battling like we always do, and we grabbed this league by the balls and sent a clear message to watch the fuck out, because this team can be damn good.And in my books, that's a success. EDIT: Obligatory salt here - Fuck the Habs, they're going to get absolutely dummied by either Detroit or Tampa. They barely made it through this round, I don't see a way in hell they make it through the next."

OttawaSenators,33zmuk,gmred91,7,Mon Apr 27 03:04:12 2015 UTC,The arena absolutely should move to Lebreton Flats. Having it so far out in Kanata is awful.
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,Kain292,3,Mon Apr 27 10:27:06 2015 UTC,Not for the people who live in the west end.
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,evilJaze,10,Mon Apr 27 12:47:17 2015 UTC,Having it favour one end of the city while being poorly positioned for the rest of it is stupid. At least if its downtown its a centralized location that's equal distance to get to. I live in the East end and to get out to CTC for a game takes way too long. Getting home is even worse. Taking the bus is slightly better but with the LRT closures starting up soon it will take even longer to get out there. It's ridiculously planned.
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,Kain292,-5,Mon Apr 27 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  It may not be central but it was intentionally placed right along the 417 where people can just hop right on the highway (after first trying to get out of the parking lot).   If it's relocated to Lebreton, you're going to see an unholy traffic mess after each event whereby people are clogging up the 1-ways and tiny, car-lined side streets trying to get to all points east and west.  Bus and LRT will probably be the only sane way to get there which will add a lot of travel time to people who live well away from OC Transpo's reach."
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,evilJaze,2,Mon Apr 27 13:13:13 2015 UTC,I live in Craig Henry and love the location of the CTC.  I think it's fine to stay there.  But I also think because of my proximity to Baseline I'm just as well-served if it moves to Lebreton...so what I'm saying is I have no horse in this race.
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,broomlad,0,Mon Apr 27 13:19:15 2015 UTC,Exactly my point.  A person's opinion of the CTC's location is pretty much based solely on their proximity.  Doesn't mean that it's location is bad overall.
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,evilJaze,6,Mon Apr 27 13:29:40 2015 UTC,Some lighter news on the Sens coming out of this day
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,MichelangeBro,7,Mon Apr 27 03:04:40 2015 UTC,they need to build one in the downtown core. I've never been to a city with a professional team that has an arena in a crappier location than we do. In a suburb? Really? Could you imagine having the ACC in Brampton or Richmond Hill?  It just doesn't make logical sense and I hope this happens
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,MichelangeBro,3,Mon Apr 27 11:49:26 2015 UTC,"Isn't the 49ers new stadium like, an hour out of San Francisco?"
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,Shadowss,2,Mon Apr 27 12:03:45 2015 UTC,"that's the exception, not the norm.   why wouldn't it be good to have an arena downtown? It would liven it up and be great for business down there too.  And if Ottawa one day does win the Cup, downtown would be a great place to celebrate it, not some arena in Kanata, Ontario surrounded by cornfields and car dealerships."
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,mechanicalhand,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:56:14 2015 UTC,"Nono, I know. Sorry, I wasn't the one that downvoted you. I was just adding that in as an interesting point.  I definitely think the arena should move into the city. Only makes sense, and it will just make our fans more lively."

OttawaSenators,33zmuk,mike-kt,2,Mon Apr 27 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"Foxborough is further from Boston than the CTC is from Ottawa. In fact, its closer to Providence, RI than it is to Boston. The Detroit Pistons and Buffalo Bills are also in similar situations."
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,untitleddocument37,0,Mon Apr 27 14:30:49 2015 UTC,As long as they used only private funds with no tax incentives/etc.... sure.  As a property tax payer I'm not really interested in paying more taxes so we can build a 2nd NHL stadium in the city...
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,mike-kt,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:54:41 2015 UTC,"What about $1 a year? There's likely some amount you would pay for the benefit of having the arena downtown.  I too am upset with the number of publicly funded facilities around north america, so I really hope the organization funds this privately so that I don't need to hate myself for wanting to give them a tax break"
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,untitleddocument37,0,Mon Apr 27 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"Well I live in Kanata so a stadium downtown would be ""no good"" for me but it's not about that.    It's like saying we need to build a new parliament or a new Rideau Centre every 20 years because ""the cost of the upkeep is too high...""  I'm sure Melnyk would love to own/operate two stadiums in our city specially if the city is paying large portions of the construction cost.  Now he can host an NHL team and concerts/etc and reap in more income...  You think they're just going to tear down the CTC?  No, what will happen is they'll build the new building and then roll out the puppy eyes to say ""hey we need to fix the CTC for the community!"" and of course we will pay for that too..."
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,mike-kt,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:10:27 2015 UTC,"If the Sens try to get additional money for CTC when they have another arena, I'll be upset at that. I won't however, say moving the arena downtown is bad because of that one possible outcome to an ancillary part of the discussion."
OttawaSenators,33zmuk,untitleddocument37,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:18:32 2015 UTC,You keep talking like the CTC is going anywhere...  If anything the city should buy a stake in either/both as a means of raising funds not tax breaks/cash/loans.  But that would requite Jim Watson to leave a fucking church bizarre and do some fucking work.  That ain't gonna happen so long as grandma has nick-nacks for sale.

OttawaSenators,33z9ck,abqsensfan,4,Mon Apr 27 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't matter to the NHL, then why do they adjust suspensions downward in the playoffs? The games are more meaningful, they should make sure they get the calls right."
OttawaSenators,33z9ck,superphunthyme1864,-1,Mon Apr 27 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"that wasn't in the playoffs. nor was it an elimination match. kinda odd to compare the two. I understand where youre coming from, I really do, but you can't just tell people not to get riled up by something like that."

That was playoff hockey from the Habs and our young team isn't there yet.  I hope this was a lesson for them - they got down 3-0 because of small mistakes.

OttawaSenators,33z9ck,Droma,3,Mon Apr 27 03:44:37 2015 UTC,Ya that was much much worse. Price deserves the benefit of the doubt for being amazing. Sens fans are salty
OttawaSenators,33z9ck,Droma,6,Mon Apr 27 06:04:38 2015 UTC,We have every reason to be angry about that call. No one that is angry at the ref is writing off how great of a season we had. It's completely legitimate for us fans to vent about an abysmal call that may have cost us game 7.
OttawaSenators,33z9ck,TheSmokeyBear,-16,Mon Apr 27 01:09:52 2015 UTC,"Selective hearing, I guess. That was all explained on TV. The call was 100% correct, as the ref had lost sight of the puck. Also, had Sens not been slashing at Price's glove, etc, all night, the refs might not have been so quick to blow the whistle."
OttawaSenators,33z9ck,superphunthyme1864,0,Mon Apr 27 01:17:54 2015 UTC,"A right to be angry, sure. But in the moment that the play was happening and from where the official was positioned, all the professionals agree that the call was correct. If the ref had been standing on the other side, he'd have seen it differently, the whistle may have gone off later, Price may have also reacted more since he'd have stopped moving when he heard the whistle. There's also the little point about the Sens constantly slashing at him. Really, I don't need luck to convince anyone. I couldn't care less. I think the Senators played a hell of a series, and I've always liked the team. They deserve a tonne of credit. Fans should be angry about a controversial call, but it was the right call, and the better team won. And to all the incredibly salty fans I didn't know existed in Ottawa until these playoffs who're downvoting me: Your tears amuse me."
OttawaSenators,33z9ck,TotoroZoo,4,Mon Apr 27 07:27:08 2015 UTC,Why do the refs get a pass? Chris Lee fucked up completely and the outcome of this game could've been wildly different.  He deserves the shit - he blew it.
OttawaSenators,33z9ck,Sporto-Hawk,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:23:14 2015 UTC,"Because he is not a robot, and cannot be expected to get every call exactly right. If he is consistently bad then there's a problem, and it's up to the NHL to decide whether he should ref. Sure, he blew it, but it is inevitable that this happens sometimes, and ideally the game is decided despite the bad call."

OttawaSenators,341uja,X0bi1e,9,Mon Apr 27 17:22:55 2015 UTC,"the play should absolutely have been reviewed and likely deemed a goal by hockey operation.   It should have been reviewed but as far as I know it would NOT have been deemed a good goal. The puck was shot after the whistle. Had the shot been taken before the whistle was blown and entered the goal after the whistle was blown, then yes maybe it would be overturned.   I'm sorry but you cannot start allowing plays to originate after the whistle has been blown."
OttawaSenators,341uja,blackleaf2,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"I think there needs to be a bit more discussion here. I totally agree that this is a can of worms that you can't just open up willy nilly. I also agree with what you're saying for the most part, except there is an important distinction to be made.  I took a look back at another thread in this sub, and this comment by /u/bradnakata explains what I have issues with right now.  In short, the adapted rule 38.4 viii reads:   This would also include situations whereby the Referee stops play or is in the process of stopping the play because he has lost sight of the puck and it is subsequently determined by video review that the puck crosses (or has crossed) the goal line and enters the net as the culmination of a continuous play where the result was unaffected by the whistle (i.e., the timing of the whistle was irrelevant to the puck entering the net at the end of a continuous play).   The key thing to look at here, as /u/bradnakata points out, is what can be deemed a continuous play. Based on my interpretation and review of the play from all angles, it should be considered a continuous play. Anything of relevance happens in less than a second after the whistle, and no one on the ice stops playing after it goes, including Price. While the shot might occur after the whistle, Pageau is diving to make the play as the whistle happens. I think that's enough of a reason to consider it a continuous play in the context of this adaptation to the rule, and should certainly have been reviewed at the very least.  I think I could have at least been somewhat settled with this whole thing if it had at least gone to review, but I think that you could very easily make a case for this to be considered a goal."
OttawaSenators,341uja,j0yb0y,2,Mon Apr 27 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"http://www.tsn.ca/c-mon-ref-explaining-sens-disallowed-goal-1.268079   While it might seem all too logical to assume that the quick whistle had no effect on what Price did (or did not do) in an to attempt to cover the puck, the separate and distinct action by Pageau to knock the puck into the net is not deemed to be a ""continuous play"" in the application of this review process.   He provides more detail on when it would have applied.  I'll let you form your own opinion on Kerry Fraser or possibly his bias."
OttawaSenators,341uja,j0yb0y,3,Mon Apr 27 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thx for the update. I've disagreed vehemently with Fraser in the past, but he has been spot on in other cases. I do want to take a closer look at what he says. I still disagree in that I think you can make a case for Pageau's play to be considered continuous. Doesn't mean that is the right conclusion, but merely there is a base for at least some form of argument."
OttawaSenators,341uja,blackleaf2,2,Mon Apr 27 20:33:29 2015 UTC,*Tips hat.  If it makes you feel better the habs have been on the receiving end as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGxVJcX6XIg
OttawaSenators,341uja,blackleaf2,2,Mon Apr 27 20:35:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, I think that's a bit of a stretch. I would think that a continuous play means just that, a play that continues after the whistle has been blown. While Pageau may have dove to shoot the puck before the whistle, the shooting of the puck is not a continuous play, it's a new play. I'm also not sure that you can say with certainty that no one on the ice stops playing. It doesn't look like it, but someone could argue they stopped playing when the whistle went.  In any case, the rule as you are interpreting can lead to some serious complications. When is it decided that a continuous play ends? How many seconds have to pass? Or is it when guys stop playing? How can we reliably determine when someone stops playing.   I'm sorry that this happened, but in my opinion, a play should die once the whistle is blown. A continuous play that leads to a goal should be a play that is unaffected by the blowing of the whistle (ie the puck was going in anyways). We can't start allowing plays on the puck to occur after the whistle is blown. It would allow too much discretion on the part of the referee and the review booth and personally, I just don't think it makes any sense. If the play is dead, it's dead.  You can't shoot a puck into the net after a dead play and count it as a goal, it's just silly."
OttawaSenators,341uja,Woofmore,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"Some good points for sure. My only argument here is that I would deem Pageau's shot attempt to be continuous as it's own entity. I think that the shot shouldn't be treated as an isolated action from his fall in this case, in so much as it looks like he dives to make the shot.  I also see now that Kerry Fraser has given his thoughts on it, as per both TSN 1200 and /u/j0yb0y, and I suppose I'll have to take that in stride and admit that I'm wrong here despite disagreeing. Regardless, the habs goal should still not have happened in the first place. That doesn't mean that we would win the game if it was called back, but it would have impacted how the game was played.  Cheers to a solid series, and we'll see you next season :D"

OttawaSenators,33yyxu,YoungMapleLeaf,0,Mon Apr 27 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"Who else had a noteworthy series for them? Montreal didn't score a whole lot of goals after Anderson came in. 2 goals in game 3, no goals in game 4, one goal in game 5 and one goal in game 6  This series was won on the back of their Vezina and Hart trophy winning goalie. Montreal's forwards didn't clinch this series for them, Price did."
OttawaSenators,33yyxu,Peetreee,0,Mon Apr 27 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"Carey Price stole one game for them, and that was game 6. In the first 2 games it was the noteworthy play of the 4th line (Flynn and Mitchell with 3 points each), then in game 3 it was Dale weise who came up clutch as he has in the past for the habs in the postseason.   The Habs outshot Ottawa every game EXCEPT for game6 which Carey stole. The Habs I believe have the highest shot total in the playoffs so far, so if any team was riding goaltending this series it was Ottawa.   The scoring for the habs this series has been evenly distributed across all 4 lines."
OttawaSenators,33yyxu,AllThatJazz,0,Mon Apr 27 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"CBC mentioned several times during this series that the top guns for Montreal were not doing much on the scoresheet and it was mostly the 3rd and 4th line who was contributing on the scoreboard.   Montreal had a lot of perimeter shots in some of those games. You can fire 50 shots at a goalie but if they're coming all from the point or just wrist shots with no traffic in front it doesn't mean much. Montreal fans on boards thought so as well.   Where was Plekanek in this series? Markov? Eller? Galchenyuk had the OT winner but he faded away at points in the series as well. DSP? Descharnais? All top offensive weapons for Montreal but they didn't exactly light the world on fire in this series.   Montreal beat Ottawa by 1 goal in all the games they won. Canadiens players themselves admit that they're not a high scoring bunch so logically if your forwards aren't known to get a lot of goals than winning games falls on your goalie which has been Montreal's MO this entire season. Are you seriously trying to suggest otherwise? That Montreal, being one of the lowest scoring playoff teams this years, doesn't depend on Price to win games for it and weren't looking at him to lead them past this first round before it started?"

OttawaSenators,33z4kx,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel bad for the ref?  Maybe?  He blew the play dead by being behind the goaltender with no knowledge of the actual state of the puck.  In a situation like that when the ref is behind the goalie he should not be blowing the whistle quite so fast.  He needs to be on the play side of the goal to be that quick.  The only other way to avoid this with on ice officials is to have 4 refs (or enhance linesman powers), one in each corner, and the one in the corner of the play determines when the puck is covered and play is stopped.  There has to be a way to eliminate straight up guessing on whether a puck is covered or not."

OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,28,Mon Apr 27 00:07:02 2015 UTC,I love losing a goal because the NHL is too suborn to ever fucking review plays.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,11,Sun Apr 26 23:22:15 2015 UTC,This needs to change. Maybe do something similar to a Coach Challenge from the NFL. Give the coaches each a chance to challenge one call on the ice that must go up to the booth for further review.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Vickshow,9,Sun Apr 26 23:24:15 2015 UTC,You'd seriously think that protecting the integrity of the games being played would be worth the 1-2 minutes extra a review would take. Now if this game ends 1-0 the refs will have literally cost us the playoffs.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,13,Sun Apr 26 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"What an appropriate ending to this shit show of a series. Excellent season boys, something to be proud of. As always, fuck the Habs. Fuck the refs. Fuck the CBC."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,12,Mon Apr 27 00:51:34 2015 UTC,These CBC dinks make it difficult to enjoy the playoffs.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,maztor,10,Sun Apr 26 22:52:57 2015 UTC,Wow. Wow. Fuck these refs so hard
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,mralexjt,11,Sun Apr 26 23:22:03 2015 UTC,We get it. Price is good. Shut up.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Stinky-pickle,12,Sun Apr 26 23:38:25 2015 UTC,OMG. I wish I could hear that Lazar taunt.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,13,Sun Apr 26 23:48:51 2015 UTC,"The 3rd better be a fuckin blowout, after they saved all this energy."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,maztor,12,Sun Apr 26 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, delay the whistle THIS time"
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,iPoop20,21,Mon Apr 27 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"The Habs players must be so confused, the Sens are down 1-0 but the crowd's still making noise!"

OttawaSenators,33ydnl,MichelangeBro,11,Sun Apr 26 22:53:42 2015 UTC,And now they're going to drain Gallagher's balls.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Cogeno,9,Sun Apr 26 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, that announcer was really offended when the other brought up Price's save percentage against Ottawa this season and in the 2013 series. It angered him enough to betray a broadcaster's love for useless statistics"
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,SteveDougson,6,Sun Apr 26 22:59:14 2015 UTC,"""You think the best goalie in the world is thinking about that!?"" We yes. He is human, and when you are losing grip of a sweep you WILL think back to the last time it didn't work your way. What a dumbass announcer. Price is no god."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,maztor,4,Sun Apr 26 23:02:58 2015 UTC,inb4 CBC announcers declare Jihad on you for blasphemy
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,SHOW_ME_YOUR_GROWLER,11,Sun Apr 26 23:05:35 2015 UTC,Is CBC getting paid to suck Habs cock? This is getting worse every game...
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,karma911,7,Sun Apr 26 23:12:49 2015 UTC,It's really hit a peak when they laugh and compliment them while they mock a rookie they hurt with a dirty player
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,maztor,11,Sun Apr 26 23:13:50 2015 UTC,Why the fuck was that whistle blown?
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,theeverlastinglight1,10,Sun Apr 26 23:21:35 2015 UTC,Fucking refs have been blowing early whistles all fucking year. Shit needs to fucking change since things like this can fucking happen. What the fucking shitfuck.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,markw3456,12,Sun Apr 26 23:22:14 2015 UTC,Every time Healy's mouth opens Price's cock gets homesick.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,RichMilk,12,Sun Apr 26 23:39:03 2015 UTC,I vote Gallagher as the most punchable face in the NHL
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,markw3456,6,Sun Apr 26 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"My vote goes to Marchand, even though I love that little weasel."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,ThisIsDK,11,Sun Apr 26 23:44:28 2015 UTC,Why does the ref with 0 viewing angle make the call? Why can't the guy on the blue line make that call?  Also. This shit doesn't even out in 1 playoff series you fucker Hrudy.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,11,Sun Apr 26 23:56:42 2015 UTC,Man... I'm embarrassed for CBC/Sportsnet now. This is the worst shit I've ever heard.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Stinky-pickle,20,Sun Apr 26 23:58:38 2015 UTC,Here it is everyone: Your Game 6 Habs vs Sens BINGO Card
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,canuck_11,5,Sun Apr 26 20:44:41 2015 UTC,add that makes all men seem like rapists? I have not seen this. I'm still getting shingles commercials nonstop.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,e_cybo_pooch,4,Sun Apr 26 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Basically shows various scenarios, I believe it's a a bunch of guys recording a chick, possibly pre-rape, then a woman getting massaged by a creepy fucker at work, then a guy spiking some chick's drink. All of these clips end with 'Thank you for keeping your mouth shut.'"
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Cogeno,9,Sun Apr 26 21:00:06 2015 UTC,"What would happen if we got a ""Sportsnet Sucks!"" chant going?"
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Cogeno,6,Sun Apr 26 23:15:13 2015 UTC,The people at the game don't really have to suffer our audible supplice.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,karma911,5,Sun Apr 26 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"I managed to be there live for ~20 games this season/post season (so far), it was great not having to deal with any commentators."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Vickshow,5,Sun Apr 26 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"or ""HEALY SUCKS"" would be great too"
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,TheSmokeyBear,10,Sun Apr 26 23:16:21 2015 UTC,MTL has no shots this period? Better get the timer up there.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Vickshow,11,Sun Apr 26 23:16:00 2015 UTC,Don't be stupid. The only MTL counter they have is for how many gallons of Habs semen the announcers can ingest in the space of 60 minutes.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,SHOW_ME_YOUR_GROWLER,9,Sun Apr 26 23:17:24 2015 UTC,Glenn. Shut the fuck up.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,mralexjt,11,Sun Apr 26 23:29:59 2015 UTC,Healy managed to find a way to make the bullshit no goal Ottawa's fault.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,RichMilk,10,Sun Apr 26 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"And we all know Habs fans right now are probably like ""Of course Sens fans are blaming the refs right now. It's their fault blah blah blah."" I hate Habs fans that are saying that and I hate /r/hockey."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,markw3456,10,Mon Apr 27 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"YOU GUYS HAVE 10 MORE MINUTES, MAKE IT FUCKING HAPPEN I BELIEVE IN Y'ALL SO HARD"

OttawaSenators,33ydnl,Craimos,27,Mon Apr 27 00:52:23 2015 UTC,CBC on full Montreal suck off mode now.

OttawaSenators,33ydnl,beekermc,9,Sun Apr 26 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"Funny, no highlights of that blown call."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,TheSmokeyBear,10,Sun Apr 26 23:38:13 2015 UTC,Holy shit they said something good about Karlsson?
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,SHOW_ME_YOUR_GROWLER,10,Sun Apr 26 23:48:20 2015 UTC,"Pre-3rd period prayer:  O Lord almighty, please give us a win and take us to the promised Game 7 land. In the name of the Stoner, the AnderSON, and the Holy Turris. Amen."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,iPoop20,10,Mon Apr 27 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"I hope Ottawa comes out flying in the 3rd. This is THEIR game to win. I watched Calgary come back from a 3 goal deficit to win in 6 games, Ottawa can do the same in 7. LET'S SEE SOME DETERMINATION AND LET'S WIN THIS GAME! GO SENS GO!"
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,ArmouredCoyote,7,Mon Apr 27 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"C'mon Sens, force a 7th game!!! I need and exciting team to watch before the 2nd round starts, and the Sens are basically Flames East this year. :P Karlsonn-Gio are Norris favorites. Gaudreau-Stone are Calder favorites. Cameron-Hartlet are Jack Adams favorites. Both young, both barely made the playoffs beating expectations. Both 3rd period teams."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,alivirji,10,Mon Apr 27 00:11:26 2015 UTC,And the Ottawa Senators finish off the year never being shut out a single time.

OttawaSenators,33ydnl,evilJaze,7,Sun Apr 26 22:45:19 2015 UTC,This first period. Needs to end and Cameron rip a piece off these guys.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,elementsix,7,Sun Apr 26 22:51:03 2015 UTC,They will give us a power play after they see how much they fucked that call up.

OttawaSenators,33ydnl,benches48,8,Sun Apr 26 23:34:48 2015 UTC,This guy can't even tell the different between Turris and Lazar. I could call this shit better.
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,9,Mon Apr 27 00:12:19 2015 UTC,"That shit makes me mad. Takes his own goalie out, wrecks any chance for a rebound on a short distance shove. we get jack shit."
OttawaSenators,33ydnl,zdelusion,8,Mon Apr 27 00:33:50 2015 UTC,I SWEAR TO GOD REFS! THIS PAGEAU GOAL BETTER COUNT REGARDLESS IF THAT LUMBERING GOOF MARKOV RAN THE FALSE GOD PRICE OR NOT.  #turristhetruegod

OttawaSenators,33ydnl,chardychar,5,Sun Apr 26 23:48:13 2015 UTC,I didn't even feel this bad in that Pittsburgh game when we were down by three. Listening to Healey jerk Price off repeatedly is not helping either.

OttawaSenators,33zt1p,jamishthegreat,2,Mon Apr 27 04:05:25 2015 UTC,anywhere from 2.50-2.75 i think. 3 or 4 years. that is if he resigns which i don't see why he wouldn't
OttawaSenators,33zt1p,NDstorm,4,Mon Apr 27 04:25:06 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Condra (and trust me, I do), he's not worth that much. At the end of the day, he's firmly a bottom-6 defensive talent. He doesn't put up huge points, and he's not really even fringe top-6 talent  on our team in case of injuries/slumps (like Michalek, for example). He's technically replaceable, both internally or externally, although he's a quality/established bottom-6 player for sure.  He signed his current 2 year $1.25M/yr deal not long ago, and was roughly as valuable then as he is now. Naturally, one could expect some economic/cap-based salary inflation and his play down the stretch might give him some room to barter. But ultimately, $1.5M-$2.0M seems like much fairer value on a 2-3 year deal. I think Murray definitely approaches Condra/his agent to re-sign, and if they show interest in a deal in that area then I wouldn't be surprised to see it get done in a hurry. But with guys like Puempel, Prince, and Grant all NHL ready (or close enough in a pinch) and all LW (and the latter two being centre-capable too) there's little reason to overpay for Condra. And that's ignoring the FA market too.  And even if Condra were just that slight step better to justify your proposed price tag, we may not have the cap room (let alone ""internal budget"", if that's truly a thing). With all the extensions we've signed in the past year and the impending RFAs, our cap will easily be in the mid $60M range barring any big moves and/or shed contracts. Guys like Milo and Legwand, notably are paid too much relative to their role despite being decent/good players in their own rights, and then Greening/Phillips/Cowen/Neil/etc. have all been near-permanent fixtures in the press box and occupying more than $10M in salary. We have to spend wisely.  I think with Cameron around and how important the coach made Condra feel (and become), I'm convinced he wants to re-sign until I hear otherwise. Legwand, Smith, Neil, Greening, and (arguably) Chiasson are our most replaceable (read: unnecessary) players, and fortunately Cameron's lineup's as the season went on supports the fact the he believes the same. And given that we had success of in spite of these players, you've got to believe management sees something similar, so half or more of these guys might be out the door this summer. But now I'm getting off topic :P"
OttawaSenators,33zt1p,Omega613,2,Mon Apr 27 05:25:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed with your 1.5-2m.. for whatever reason I thought he was being paid 2m this year and figured he would get a tad more then that. I hope he resigns 2-3 years anywhere under 2m per. I believe he's worth that for being a great PKer and a good mentor for young players such as Pageau, Lazar, Stone, an whoever else will be coming up from Bingo next year."

Or as many of them as possible  These are replacement level players making nearly 15 mill a year total. That money can easily be better invested.   I wonder if Bryan Murray steps down (given his condition)."
OttawaSenators,33zbv6,chumpawumpa69,6,Mon Apr 27 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a ridiculously hard choice on which goalie to let go.  I'm super nervous about the idea of letting Lehner go.  I still think he's got the best potential.  Also, we NEED to fix our third pairing.  We just can't contend with Boro playing next to Gryba, Phillips or Cowen.  I'm not always crazy about Wiercioch-Ceci either.  We need a veteran anchor.  Up front I don't see the need for any change, except maybe moving out Chiasson and Legwand.  I want to see a full year from Puempel - I feel like he could be our Gallagher or Marchand, with a lot more skill.  And I hope to see two things:  a clear-cut successor brought in to work with Murray and the management team, and I want Daniel Alfredsson to be part of the organization in one way or another.  I don't care what it takes, bring him in and mentor him!"
OttawaSenators,33zbv6,xdiagnosis,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard to ignore the consistency seen in Anderson, and getting rid of him for a goalie STILL trying to grow, and a goalie that may or may not be coming down to earth is potentially risky. And there has been so much fan emotion surrounding the legend of the Hamburglar that I can't see him going anywhere either. Plus, the O'Connor thing adds more complexity.  Wiercioch and Ceci both have incredible potential but I do agree that it's tough to grow when they don't have someone beside them to hold them together. Boro is a sure bet, but they do need someone who can actually step up as a proper Top 6. Maybe one more year of waiting for Cowen? Or just trade him off for something more certain.  The forwards are finally clicking, but I do think it'd still be nice to have a left winger that's more reliable to put up points than MacArthur. Still, there is huge improvement in the rookies Stone, Hoffman, Lazar, Pageau and definitely Puempel. Perhaps Puempel could step up as that left winger?"
OttawaSenators,33zbv6,Jthedude17,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:46:34 2015 UTC,Agreed on Alfie. Give him some generic title that just kind of gives him a say in everything and keeps him in the loop. I don't see it happening but I think he'd excel at assistant coach.
OttawaSenators,33zbv6,Jthedude17,2,Mon Apr 27 02:12:22 2015 UTC,"16 - 7 - 61  68 - 93 - 6  22 - 44 - 27  9 - 15 - 90/26/25 (probably not Neil but maybe)  3 - 65  46 - 5  74? - 45?  41  30/40  Forwards are fine. Get rid of Legwand and Greening. I'd be fine if Chiasson went (preferably for a decent bottom-6 left defenseman.) I love both Boroweicki and Gryba but my god one if not both needs to go. Hopefully Wideman takes the 3rd pairing RD. Trade Cowen. I don't care if he can one day become the next Chara, if he remains an Ottawa Senator he will only become the next first round bust. Give him a fresh start and salvage something for him.  Goaltending is a tricky issue. Anderson is ridiculously good but don't forget that he is 33. Soon he's gonna start getting old and not be as good. Trade Anderson while he has insanely high value, trust Lehner as the starter. If he blows it Hammond can cover his ass. I firmly believe that if we trust Lehner with reasonable, consistent starting time he can be a solid goaltender. Not a star, but very solid. This will really let him grow. We also have a safety cushion with Hammond, who will also get lots of backup starts.  Don't sign any free agent forwards. Just don't do it. We have the ideal lineup right now, we don't need another shitty depth piece to play 4th line/press box. The only big free agent move I'm okay making is for a quality, left shooting, 2 way D man to teach Wideman. Sign him to a 2 year deal. Play him bottom 6, where he can be responsible and kill some penalties.  In the draft we have a 17-19 first rounder, a 42 second, and a 47-49 second. Use the first on a good defenseman with an offensive upside. One of the seconds on a total bottom-6 winger who will kill penalties and be responsible (think Condra). The other can just be a reasonably skilled forward (likely another winger) who can play 2nd/3rd line. Don't forget that 9MM won't have a lot of time left, meaning there will be a hole in our lineup."

OttawaSenators,33xc41,HelmedHorror,17,Mon Apr 27 02:56:02 2015 UTC,Andy has turned it on for sure. However he isn't Price. Price posted an insane full season. Andy has been amazing 2 games.   I just hope Andy is in his zone and steals this series!

OttawaSenators,33xc41,karma911,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:45:31 2015 UTC,people need to start realizing that almost all goalies are equal. And there is very little between most goalie matchups.  The only thing that makes Price better than Andy is Price doesn't take 2 months off every February for some questionable injury
OttawaSenators,33xc41,MikeyTupper,-5,Sun Apr 26 16:57:43 2015 UTC,Surprising how average Price's stats are. Especially when you look at his dominance stats wise this season.
OttawaSenators,33xc41,Peetreee,4,Sun Apr 26 16:30:48 2015 UTC,it was mostly last game only he was bad though

OttawaSenators,33xg73,Stinky-pickle,8,Sun Apr 26 16:08:49 2015 UTC,No doubt about that. I will be cheering like a mad man no matter what.
OttawaSenators,33xg73,peskysens,14,Sun Apr 26 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"First half of this season I was almost ready to start watching someone else. The team was just depressing. The coach was a joke. And the players (playing at that time) were a joke.   Then Maclean gets the boot and Cameron steps in with the idea that maybe our youth is the key! And pow!  The second half of the season has been amazing as a fan. I wasn't even expecting post season and my faith and drive as a fan was back 1000x. Watching stone and Hoffman turn into the stars they are, Karlsson really take hold of the C and Lazar show that while he is 19 he is really here to stay! Then you have the main core of Zibby and Turris showing they can take that next step. It's been fantastic.   So regardless of the outcome of this series I am stoked for the future of this team!!"

I am really trying to be optimistic and pleased that we pushed the series this far but to be honest, I feel like a loss tonight would be heartbreaking. I am feeling more anxious than excited and it sucks.   Either way, I am so proud of this team and what we accomplished. Going to cheer my pants off tonight."

OttawaSenators,33wwzw,lead2gold,20,Sun Apr 26 12:24:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone, we gotta take the same approach that Cameron's taking: one game at a time.  Let's not forget that we still need to win two more in a row. This series isn't ours. We need to check our expectations, not only so that we don't end up crushed if we lose, but also because we don't want to give anyone ammunition if that loss should come.  Let's just keep doing what we've been doing for the past few months. Cheer on our boys, hope for the best, and be as civil as possible."
OttawaSenators,33wwzw,MichelangeBro,5,Sun Apr 26 12:46:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I'm just a fan. The outcome of the game isn't going to change based on a picture on Reddit. Relax, and enjoy the game tonight! Win or lose, the Sens put on a fantastic show to make it this far."
OttawaSenators,33wwzw,MichelangeBro,6,Sun Apr 26 12:57:21 2015 UTC,"No, I know that. I just think it's a good idea to not give Habs fans anything to throw in our faces if the series doesn't go our way, haha."

OttawaSenators,33zbgi,Jthedude17,2,Mon Apr 27 03:23:05 2015 UTC,I don't understand this to be very honest. There has never been a darker time for Robin Lehner. He isn't doing well for Ottawa and we have 2 true goalies in Hammond and Anderson who are fantastic. If Lehner does avoid getting traded he's going to have to play his ass off. I like Lehner but this doesn't make any sense to me at all.
OttawaSenators,33zbgi,estyll11,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:05:19 2015 UTC,"Well hey, that's what preseason is for. Hopefully Lehner has gotten a chance to think about his training camp, and will elevate his play when he gets a chance. I love the hambrugler, but he needs to show the team he can do the same thing for more than 25 games, so I wouldn't consider him a guarantee as back up to Anderson. I'm actually hoping Lehner finds a way to nab that starting job from both men."

The Sens are the ones down (as he openly mentions), and we're the ones who came into this series as the underdog - that's the Rocky story, and we have the starring role.   It's not a matter of the ""poor little Habs battling hard through injuries and adversity to win a long awaited cup, facing a much greater team"". No, they're the (self-appointed) Goliath to us, as David. They have the ""best goalie in the world"". If we lose, so what? They beat a less highly touted team chock full of developing ill-prepared rookies, good for them but there's little grounds to be overly proud of that accomplishment. If we somehow manage beat them in 7? Then we will have overcome the ""mighty"" Habs, bent 'em til they broke and have every reason to be pleased with ourselves. Everything we accomplish in the playoffs is an amazing bonus for us when all is said and done - we have everything to win, they have everything to lose... and I'm loving every moment of that dichotomy."

OttawaSenators,33uzq4,VITOCHAN,3,Sun Apr 26 03:03:02 2015 UTC,yikes.    Imagine Mendez ranting like that.  lol
OttawaSenators,33uzq4,dilpreet64,2,Sun Apr 26 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is true or not, but Mendez has admitted to not being a fan of the Sens."
OttawaSenators,33uzq4,VITOCHAN,2,Sun Apr 26 13:53:35 2015 UTC,He pleads journalistic integrity can't be met if you emotionally invest yourself in a team. Mendes can be irritating but he's always coming from a point of view that isn't skewed by fandom. Unless it's the Cowboys... which is odd because they suck.
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,JackLeiper,3,Sat Apr 25 20:15:08 2015 UTC,One of the best in terms of save percentage over the past few seasons. Would hate to see him traded. Still on an amazing deal.
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,walahiguy,2,Sat Apr 25 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"He's a good goalie but is inconsistent and always hurt. I think he's still a prime trade candidate, barring a huge playoff run. He has the most value and his contract is attractive to other teams. It makes more sense to keep lehner who is a lot younger and cheaper. Both have some mental question marks. I like the Lehner Hammond combo more, personally."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,Akoustyk,2,Sun Apr 26 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"Anderson has the potential to be one of the best goaliesmottawa has ever had.   When he is in position, he is a very strong goaltender.  But he drive me nuts the way he takes unnecessary risks, going for poke checks trying to play pucks that will clearly just miss the net and go off into a corner or something, or go back to play pucks with impending pressure.   A lot of decisions he makes provide little advantage if successful, but sever penalty if anythingoes wrong.  I just wish he would stop that. If he could stop those habits, I think he'd be one of the best goaltender's in the league right now."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,shallowcreek,5,Sat Apr 25 23:03:29 2015 UTC,he probably already is the best goalie Ottawa's ever had. The bar isn't all that high to begin with
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,Vickshow,4,Sat Apr 25 23:58:10 2015 UTC,"If you add on ""while they have been a Senator"". If you're just saying best goalie that has played for Ottawa then that goes to Hasek."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,Akoustyk,3,Sun Apr 26 01:08:52 2015 UTC,"Ya, not such a high bar, but they did have hasek, lalime was not so bad, but had some of the same symptoms, and Elliot was decent and so was emery. But its true that sens have needed a really top notch goalie for a while. And Anderson could be that if he fixes those tendencies.  Those poor sorts of decisions that leave the net open though are really severe, because those are the sorts of goals that are so demoralizing. If your goalie was there, working hard and one got past him, ok, so you fight to get one back for him.   When your goalie leaves the net for a poke check, and gets scored on a wrap around in an open net just because the skater was able to deke the check, that's demoralizing, because you feel like your goalie is liable to just hand them goals."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,benches48,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:00:28 2015 UTC,"Top 10 goalie in the entire NHL based on SV%? Yes please. If we keep Hammy and either send down Lehner or trade him for a bottom 6 forward or top 6 d-man or vice versa, even better. Andy has found his confidence, the team plays 100 times better under the leadership of Cameron. Next thing I'm expecting is Lehner coming back with a .940+ SV% on his next start, if it ever happens."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,thwump,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:38:39 2015 UTC,"Lehner can't be sent down without going through waivers.  When he's healthy, he'll be with the Sens or traded."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,papaprof,2,Sat Apr 25 23:49:39 2015 UTC,"Problem is, Andy has more value at this point..."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,benches48,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"Ah gotcha.  Trade him then and let's ditch the players who are either being paid too much or are not doing anything anymore (Cowen, Leggy [if we can find someone better than him like a certain De Costa] & of course Lehner). We could use some depth players who aren't paid 3 million to act as a veteran presence."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,Ubuhio,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be Lehner.    Moving Andy for a Lehner/Hammond tandem couuld work but it would be foolhardy.   You can move Hammond and keep Lehner, but Lehner will be a starting tender soon.  (He already is for some teams out there)  We can't keep him in a cage out back and just release him when we need him.  What if we do successfully court Matt O'Connor?  How do you convince him that the starting role is his to seize in a few years if we have Lehner AND Hammond?  I love Lehner and really wanted him to have a long successful career in Ottawa.  Unfortunately I think that's just not the way it's going to work out.  Edit:  It's just occured to me now.  Doesn't SOMEONE have to go back to Bingo for next year?"
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,thewinegarden,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:38:13 2015 UTC,Can't move Hammond. Free agent this off season.
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,Ubuhio,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"Could always pull the ol' ""Hossa"" on him."
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,thewinegarden,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:11:53 2015 UTC,Fair enough
OttawaSenators,33uo9z,Arayvenn,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"This has been known. If any team is dumb enough to give up actual assets for a goaltender that's played 25 career games and is, right now, a UFA at the end of the season, I say ship Hammond out. I'm grateful for the playoff run, but Andy is our guy and Lehner is the future. I don't buy into the Matt O'Connor hype."

OttawaSenators,33uatf,blvckhippy,4,Sat Apr 25 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine bought it just before he got traded.   One odd statistic I've noticed is that whenever I see Silfverberg jerseys in the wild, it's almost always a brown guy :S  Or maybe it's the same Silfverberg jersey."

Makes for way too much ugly, ugly merch.   For instance, Canadian Tire has these sweet little NHL licensed kids bikes this year. The Sens one is just ruined by the use of this flat ugly gold. Doesn't even reflect the current team look at all.  Makes me sad. Also, the =O= logo needs more merch love. But I digress."

OttawaSenators,33tqrd,man_on_hill,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:20:27 2015 UTC,Was just making a joke about how all the habs fans are screaming that Stone was faking it when he got slashed but acting like a felony was commited when Anderson slashed Prust.
OttawaSenators,33tqrd,Cogeno,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:23:51 2015 UTC,really? I think the guys a moron.   From his childish comments from a coupe of years ago to targeting Anderson like that he seems like a guy who gets stupid really quickly if things aren't going his way.

OttawaSenators,33tqrd,Lyrus,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:35:59 2015 UTC,I think there are far dirtier and far more childish players is all I mean. He's not one of my favourite players by any stretch... he's not dirty or turtley enough to annoy me long-term compared to other players of his ilk.

OttawaSenators,33s1d6,epwnym,5,Sat Apr 25 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think our defence has been getting enough credit. How many amazing games do our goaltenders actually have? We have a LOT of very good defensive forwards as well.  Getting kind of tired of all the praise being heaped on the goalie every game.  Pageau had a great game defensively, I thought Z-bad looked solid most of the game and turris and stone are still dominating. They've been on fire for months.  Wiercoch and Ceci have been impressively solid and showed some flash tonight, I like methot's game right now, Karlsson is at the top of his game and Gryba and Boro are finishing checks and intimidating the Habs.  It's not all Andy, and it certainly wasn't all Hammond. Not to knock their games, they have made key stops that's for sure. But the entire team just seems to be relentless and very responsible.  Also Lazar and Condra round out a line that barely ever plays in our zone."

OttawaSenators,33s1d6,Dk_krypton,3,Sat Apr 25 03:14:30 2015 UTC,Ya. You think we'd get rid of Lehner? I just don't think we'd get much for him. I think either Hammond or Anderson are gone.
OttawaSenators,33s1d6,ActionAxson,3,Sat Apr 25 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yeh, but think about it this way. Is getting trade money more important than possibly doing really really well in the next season or so in terms of goaltending?  If Lehner performs, then brilliant! But damn. I'm kinda happy with the way things are right now. Anderson starting and a solid backup hamburglar."
OttawaSenators,33s1d6,SirRaava,2,Sat Apr 25 03:33:04 2015 UTC,O definitely doing well comes before. But I think having both Anderson and Hammond would be overkill. So I'm thinking as sad as it is we get rid of one and pick up a stronger d player.

He is INDEPENDENTLY choosing to say that the coverage was in favour of Sens!    Anyways, I agree with you.

Potvin is pretty much out of it, but back in the day (before I was born) he was a solid offensive defence man.

OttawaSenators,33s3se,JackTheLab,8,Sat Apr 25 02:16:18 2015 UTC,"PoorMans Karlsson Subban. The only impact he's had all series was the slick one-tee goal he had off the boards on Hammond early in the series.   The cornerstone of any offence is to break out of your own zone, this is what makes a puck moving defence man so valuable; and that is what Pretend Karlsson is. A puck moving defense man.   EK65 is in a class of his own in moving the puck down the ice. It's incredible to watch.   He knows exactly where every player is on the ice, where the puck is, where the puck is going to go. He appears out of nowhere to snatch away the long outlet pass from the other team.   If he sees a possible odd man rush he will quickly forward the puck to the winger who's more open (leaving the centre to drive into the slot for a possible pass); and if the forwards are covered, he will just back off an play catch with Methot and wait for a lane to open.   In the zone he has a heavy, accurate shot that he can launch from anywhere. If he's one the weak side away from play he will sneak down low and look for a squeaker or a weak rebound from the net minder.   The progression cliche for defence men is that they'll hit their potential around 400 career games. EK is sitting at 397 regular season games with 303 points.   If he is ""finally maturing"" then I am completely fine with this. All series he has been playing with a fire and intensity unmatched by anyone one either team.  I only wish Alfie had played his last year here, it would have been a great experience for EK; even without that, he will be a great captain for years to come."

OttawaSenators,33s1bq,sugar_bear,8,Sat Apr 25 02:17:37 2015 UTC,Much more serious because there's more danger to the player.   The Habs organization is taking every chance they can to go out and intentionally injure our best. They shouldn't even be allowed to continue but the league ignores it in favour of playoff revenues.

OttawaSenators,33s1bq,beekermc,4,Sat Apr 25 04:40:35 2015 UTC,Ehhhhh... I'm sure someone has. Probably not the regulars on this sub.
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,InTURRISting,10,Sat Apr 25 03:40:55 2015 UTC,If MacArthur can't play next game do you guys think we might see Shane Prince finally? I feel like he would slot in very nicely with Turris and Stone.
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,T-ohm-y,7,Sat Apr 25 03:42:16 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming the top-9 is set (not a guarantee, but likely), if Neil were to come in it would mean putting either him or Chiasson on their off-wing. The only alternate option in terms of NHL ""proven"" forwards is Greening, which Cameron hasn't shown much trust in (understandably), or putting Legwand back in and moving Smith to the LW.  That all seems like a bad idea imo, on top of the other ramifications. Prince is fast (good for Cameron's system), has played as many games for the Sens in the last few months as Neil, and is a natural LW. He might also make that 4th line capable of some legitimate offense for the first time this series, and didn't look out of place in his short stint earlier in the season. I say yes, although it hinges on MacA still being injured by next game (did anyone catch when/how he was injured?)."
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,Omega613,6,Sat Apr 25 04:37:56 2015 UTC,Is Puempel still injured?
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,T-ohm-y,5,Sat Apr 25 01:54:21 2015 UTC,yeah
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,lukin5,4,Sat Apr 25 02:00:27 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. He's not listed as being on IR (and may never have been), but the fact that we've not even heard about him skating makes me think he's still out. However he ought to be close at least, since he was injured almost exactly a month ago and we were told something like ~3-4 weeks.  Another good option though if he's ready."
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,benches48,5,Sat Apr 25 02:03:51 2015 UTC,"All I heard was that it was a lower body injury, I'm looking through the game again to try and find what caused it exactly.   Edit: Only thing I could find that might have been an injury around the time he left the game was at the 11:35 mark of the second when he got his leg pinned awkwardly between Eller and the ice. It didn't look very bad at the time but he only played one short shift after it happened, so maybe."
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,karma911,6,Sat Apr 25 02:23:25 2015 UTC,"I thought Smith was awful in his own zone tonight.  Took an extra second every time he had the puck,  and it didn't clear the zone.   I'd be looking to replace him for game 6 if there was an alternative."
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,Eagled,6,Sat Apr 25 02:27:11 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, I was going to say that our fourth like looked ""ok"" tonight. Not good, by an stretch, but not a liability and did a good job clearing the traffic in front of Andy to make saves more easily. Also important to realize that Smith started 88% in the defensive/neutral zone, so he was given very defensive assignments and yet managed ~30% CF% (and our team was only ~37% on the night, so relatively strong).   I wouldn't be offended if Legwand drew in, but I thought Legwand didn't really look any better this series than what I saw from Smith tonight or last game."
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,NDstorm,5,Sat Apr 25 02:04:22 2015 UTC,I was at a loud ass pub. What happened to him?
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,IUvipss21,3,Sat Apr 25 02:19:22 2015 UTC,Lower body injury. Not really sure when. Day to day.
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,bbmello,2,Sat Apr 25 02:33:59 2015 UTC,michalek
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,IUvipss21,3,Sat Apr 25 03:50:42 2015 UTC,That is an option (and most likely what the coaching staff will do) but putting Michalek up with Turris not only weakens that line but also has a negative impact on our fourth line which is finally starting to look good.   Basically would you rather:  Prince - Turris - Stone  with  Michalek - Smith - Chiasson  or  Michalek - Turris - Stone  with   Greening - Smith - Chiasson / Smith - Legwand - Chiasson / Chiasson - Smith - Neil
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,flirtyf,3,Sat Apr 25 03:54:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, when I replied last night, I missed the part about Prince playing with Turris/Stone. Why is Prince on the 4th line not an option?    Milo - Turris - Stone Hoff - Zbad - Ryan Condra - Pageau - Lazar Prince - Smith - Chiasson    Prince looked good there earlier in the season (in terms of ice time and level of competition), even having a pretty slick assist in his first game (note: our 4th line that day was Prince - Legwand – Condra)"
OttawaSenators,33s1bq,Omega613,3,Sat Apr 25 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"Anything that gets Prince into the line-up works for me to be honest, I remember how good he looked with Legwand and Condra earlier in the season. I would just prefer to have him playing alongside Turris and Stone as I feel like he'd fit in perfectly with those two."

OttawaSenators,33s1bq,SkullCrusherXP,5,Sat Apr 25 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"So I was following the Jets/Ducks series while it was playing, and a common thread of conversation throughout was how physical the series was (in terms of ""Hits"" tallies) and especially how much physicality the Jets played with in particular. Here's the breakdown:   Game 1: Jets 37; Ducks 46 Game 2: Jets 33; Ducks 48 Game 3: Jets 61; Ducks 44 Game 4: Jets 45; Ducks 35   176 173 Series:     Jets Average/gm: 44.0 Ducks Average/gm: 43.3 Series Average/gm: 87.3 Jets/Ducks each led two games in hits, always at home. Jets had a series high 61 in game 3.   Now I'm on the side that hits are great when done well, but when you remove yourself from the play to finish a check on someone who doesn't have possession (or isn't a threat) then you're doing your team a disservice. Cameron even touched on that a bit in one of his pre/post game pressers. Essentially, hits for the sake of hits are pointless, even in the playoffs, but can be used to great effect. But I digress, for comparison to the above, let's look at our series, for which I've heard very little about the physicality in terms of hit counts:    Game 1: Sens 44; Montreal 42 Game 2: Sens 53; Montreal 41 Game 3: Sens 61; Montreal 36 Game 4: Sens 34; Montreal 29 Game 5: Sens 50; Montreal 39   Series:     Ottawa Average/gm: 48.4  Montreal Average/gm: 37.4 Series Average/gm: 85.8 Sens led every game in hit total, and had a series high 61 in game 3 (same as the Jets).   So while there's certainly an absolute CHASM of a difference in terms of total hits per game from both teams combined (a huge difference of 1.5 hits/gm), the Sens are ""out-hitting"" the Jets in our series. It's minor and arguably irrelevant, but it was such an important story from the other series. It might even be taking it's toll physically on the Habs and might be a part of our recent success. Just yet another interesting (pro-Sens) point of discussion that perhaps Sportsnet has conveniently forgotten ;)"

At that point in time, Ottawa was bottoming out and it looked like there was no chance in hell they were going to make the playoffs. Soon after I left, they really started turning it around, which led to them to the playoffs. So it WAS all my fault :)  I'm not due to come back until mid-June, around the time the final ends.

OttawaSenators,33qyy4,shining_,10,Fri Apr 24 20:04:48 2015 UTC,Biggest decision of the summer!  Oh boy.
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,chumpawumpa69,8,Fri Apr 24 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"Now I know I, for one, was dreading our long-term goalie depth a couple months ago, and hoping we would use one of our 2nd rounders this season to draft a high end prospect. Now I'm unsure. As it stands, there are basically 4 open spots in our goalie depth chart (2 NHL, 2 AHL, and I'm ignoring ECHL) for a fair few decent (or better) goalies:   Craig Anderson - 33 years old - Long term veteran, signed to a 3 year $4.2M/yr contract that starts in July. Has given us some much needed netminder stability for the past ~4 years. Likely still has at least a couple productive years left. Arguable injury proneness. Likely has the highest trade value of all our goalies. Robin Lehner - 23 years old - Struggled this season, was average (but better than Andy) last season behind a disastrous defense, but has otherwise has put up amazing numbers across all levels/leagues he's played in. Needs some work and continued development before anyone considers him a reliable starter (goalie's often take util mid-twenties to start becoming consistent/good enough for the nhl, Carey Price being a good/recent example of this). Arguable trade value after a poor season and several other tradeable goalies with similar potential but with more experience (eg. Bernier, Reimer, Talbot, etc.), but could have tremendous value to us (long-term #1 goalie) or to another team. Andrew Hammond - 27 years old - Impending UFA, so if he walks this debate may become pointless. We have the option to trade his rights (might be unlikely), re-sign and keep him, or re-sign and trade him. Fairly certain he's no longer waiver exempt, so he's either stuck in the NHL for the foreseeable future or will likely be claimed by another team in need of a backup. He will regress from his recent regular season statistical success, but how much remains to be seen. He has genuinely looked very good many nights, and could make a good backup for us or another team. Chris Driedger - 20 years old - Not an NHL goalie yet, at least, but a decent prospect (3rd round pick 2012). He was the 8th goalie picked that year, despite being the 13th rated in NA, so our scouts must've seen something in him. Played for the ECHL's worst team (the Icemen) for most of this season, posting very respectable numbers given the team, but got to play 6 AHL games at the start and end of the year. Went 6-0-0, 92.3%, and 2.55GAA - all excellent numbers. Presumably a lock to start in the AHL next season provided nothing radical happens, for developmental reasons.  Marcus Högberg: - 20 years old - Our 2013 3rd round pick, has been playing in Sweden. Another huge Swedish goalie like Lehner, he posted an impressive 2.30 goals-against average and a .917 save percentage in 27 regular season games, despite playing behind veteran David Rautio for much of the season. Several reports have suggested that he's expected to make the jump to Bingo next season, further confusing the issue.   And now potentially O'Connor, all vying for 4 spots. Even if we trade one away (presumably one of our 3 NHL tenders), there's still a log jam if everything goals according to expectations (ie.

OttawaSenators,33qyy4,hoytaylo,3,Sat Apr 25 01:04:47 2015 UTC,"Ok now do a writeup on this O'Connor fella, plz"
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Clintown,3,Sat Apr 25 00:16:03 2015 UTC,"i don't know if i'm the only one that thinks about this, but didn't lehner just have his first kid over the summer? could that have anything to do with him having an off year"
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Roidsmakethegame,2,Sat Apr 25 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, Lennox Lehner. How do you imagine that affecting his game? (Not that I disagree, just curious about your theory.)"
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Omega613,3,Sat Apr 25 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"prolly makes it a little harder to focus.  pro athletes don't exactly have the best sleep schedule as it is, add a newborn baby into that and i could see it really messing with your head"
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Roidsmakethegame,2,Sat Apr 25 01:02:23 2015 UTC,"Could be. I know Lehner started the season really strong, he and Andy were posting mind-90's save %'s for the early stretch in October, but it was from November(ish) onward that things came crashing down. Even something seemingly small like losing the exra hour or two of sleep each night while home could have an effect. Certainly a plausible theory.  But beyond that, the team really did play very badly in front of him when he was in net. Continuing the trend from last season, the shots were usually in the 40+ range.  I'm thinking the Lehner's poor puck playing ability relative to Andy/Hammond might also have an effect. Having your goalie able to steer the puck toward your own players is always useful, and perhaps our team (especially when our puck-moving D are out of the lineup) is more reliant on that than we realize."
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Omega613,4,Sat Apr 25 01:10:00 2015 UTC,I only see Lehner as the option to be moved.
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,canuck_11,11,Fri Apr 24 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Why? He's the biggest gamble, for sure, but also has the highest upside. High risk high reward, in essence. He's had one bad year at an age/experience level where goalie's aren't even expected to be in the NHL, let alone perform well/consistently. Price followed the normal/average developmental path for goalie's in which it took him ~300 games played and until age 25/26 for him to string two consistently good seasons together. Before that, he was up and down and had trouble in pressure/playoffs situations. As recently as 2012/13 at age ~25 Price posted a 90.5% on the season and many Montreal fans held serious concern about his ability to succeed in the long term.  Lehner has been really good outside of this season - and that's been a small/inconsistent sample size usually behind dmen like Phillips/Cowen. Trading him now would be completely reactionary.  As unpredictable as goalies are, their developmental rate is predictably slow and delayed relative to other skaters. There's good reason to be patient with Lehner, and in my opinion he's the only one on this list I don't consider trading based on probable long-term benefit (whether that's increased performance for us, or increased trade value). Especially since his recent concussion is likely to drop his trade value significantly. I just don't think we can possibly get a sufficient return to justify losing out on even a small chance that he lives up to his potential. Lehner also has the best contract situation (small price, medium term, RFA afterwards). Contrast that to Andy - who won't be as good as he is right now forever, and Hammond who's still pretty much an unknown commodity but unlikely to have an especially high ceiling."
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Omega613,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"It's hard to imagine letting Andy go after these last few games, but it's at least as hard to imagine letting Hammond go after this year.   Lehner seems like he'd be the easiest guy to just say ""okay, bye"" to and get a decent prospect for, but with the sens history I can see him turning into Lundqvist the year after he leaves. In any case, I don't envy Murray's job this summer."
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Boonedoggle,3,Sat Apr 25 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"it's at least as hard to imagine letting Hammond go after this year.   My heart agrees, but my brain doesn't. And I'm not keen on making decisions based on emotions - it rarely pans out.  I think Hammond has shown himself to be NHL capable, in spite of his poor stats at lower levels. But nothing outside of a handful of games indicates to me that he'll be especially amazing. If you take a small sample from earlier in Lehner's career, he looks even more impressive than Hammond, and the eye test supported those stats too. Simply put, Hammond had a great run and may have a career ahead of him, but sacrificing Lehner so early in his career is daft. But right now people are taking Hammond 20-something game span as an indicator that he's amazing, and Lehner's 20-something game record this season as an indicator that he's a bust. Those are not adequate sample sizes for either conclusion, doubly so when those number came (largely) behind different rosters (more Phillips, Greening, Neil for Lehner, more Wiercioch, Pageau, Condra for Hammond) and different coaches.  Put it a completely different way - Lehner cost us a 2nd round pick (to draft) and has actually made it to the NHL. Many draft picks don't make it this far, and 2nd rounders have something like 30% success rates - sufficed to say he's already done relatively well. Do you honestly think he could get at least than in return in a trade? I don't, not after a poor season and questions about the impact of his concussion. Alone, I don't see him fetching higher than a 3rd or 4th rounder (or equivalent in a mutli-player deal), and making that trade is really poor asset management, especially with a player who's FAR from being written off as a bust. Hammond we got for free, by scouting and signing him out of college. Let's say we trade his rights for a 6th/7th rounder, or re-sign and trade him for a 4th/5th. We just managed to get a pick for essentially nothing aside from the opportunity cost of giving up a potential backup.   This needs to be thought about, not felt about."
OttawaSenators,33qyy4,Omega613,2,Sat Apr 25 02:15:54 2015 UTC,"Realistically, you are right. But it hurts to think about.. Three months ago, nobody knew about Hammond, and now people are wearing his jersey at the CTC.. :(  If he is not resigned, I imagine fury in the fanbase at first, and then people quickly realizing it was probably the right choice. Basically the same thing that happens whenever a controversial decision is made.  Edit: to be fair to lehner, wasn't he being discussed as the main piece in a trade for Taylor Hall? I'm pretty sure he would fetch more than a third rounder."

Wideman has at least proven himself at an AHL level, winning the Norris trophy equivalent earlier this month. Hard to think that skill level cna't at least translate well to the NHL in a sheltered 3rd pairing role to begin with. Having a puck moving guy on the third pairing (with Boro) might help them from getting hemmed in our zone constantly. He's 25 so it's not as if he's some young and completely unprepared player We could use the little extra speed to counter Montreal's, nt to mention potential scoring boost. I know throwing a rookie in is a gamble, but they're also driven to earn an NHL spot/contract, so there's a chance motivation and excitement can play a big part in their performance (see: Pageau in 2013 playoffs).  Contrary to earlier beliefs, he's apparently a UFA VI this summer, so anything we can do to convince him to re-sign (and/or to see how he handles NHL hockey) would be a plus.   That all said, I totally understand why we would keep Gryba in, since that would be a pretty significant change (it's not as if the two blueliners have interchangeable skill sets.)."
OttawaSenators,33qvzd,Omega613,3,Fri Apr 24 20:05:18 2015 UTC,"I do like Wideman for our Blueline in the future, for all the reasons you stated. However, I think it's way too big of a gamble throwing in an unproven rookie in a must win game in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The risk is much greater than the reward in this case (IMO)"
OttawaSenators,33qvzd,MichelangeBro,3,Fri Apr 24 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, elimination game, in the playoffs, on the road, against a heated rival is not the time to bring in a prospect who's never played a game in the NHL (that I know of?)."
OttawaSenators,33qvzd,Omega613,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:31:31 2015 UTC,"Correct. Never played an NHL game outside of training camp exhibition games (which hardly count). Closest he's come, to my knowlesge, is being called up as a 7th dman earlier this year, so he got to practice/train with the team a little bit, but never saw game action, and that's a big difference. Although he's had considerable professional experience in the AHL, playoffs included, so he's not as green as someone coming up from the OHL/WHL, for example."

Me ""wanting"" Wideman to play for above reasons and be actually being able to justify the inherent risk given the situation are very different. If, for example, Gryba were injured, then I might be willing to lobby for putting Wideman in over Cowen/other.   But I've conveniently left out most of the downsides to pulling Gryba out in favour of Wideman (eg. Our PK has been good this series, and Gryba has actually been a solid part of that, despite his questionable 5v5 play). Again, I would be happy to see Wideman in tonight/next game, but I have zero expectation that it would happen and I don't necessarily disagree with Cameron's decision to forego the option/opportunity."

Dubnyk played 67% of the games for 2(?) teams, starting off as a backup this year.

OttawaSenators,33ned3,iPoop20,14,Fri Apr 24 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised at all the people shocked Forsberg isn't up there. The only argument I've heard is that Stone got nominated due to recency bias... even though he ended the season with more total points than Forsberg, and was better defensively. By that logic, Benn shouldn't have won the Art Ross cause most of his points came in the last couple months.  I'd understand if Forsberg had more points that Stone that recency bias could be reasonably argued, but I don't think you can argue Forsbergs season was in anyway better than Stone. Still a hell of a player."
OttawaSenators,33ned3,Iphikratous3,12,Fri Apr 24 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Why should Stone be penalised for having a super strong finish to the season when the sens were fighting to make the playoffs, if anything that should be a positive factor."
OttawaSenators,33ned3,mikehofbrauhaus,2,Fri Apr 24 01:11:05 2015 UTC,Let's not forget stone should vrea selke nominee as well. Does gudreau have 94 takeaways ? Hell no!
OttawaSenators,33ned3,broomlad,5,Fri Apr 24 05:00:06 2015 UTC,"By that logic, Benn shouldn't have won the Art Ross cause most of his points came in the last couple months.     I disagree; the Art Ross is a statistical trophy - it doesn't matter when he got his points, it matters that he scored the most.  Having said that, I also think it's silly to suggest that Stone is undeserving based on when he scored his points.    It's also fair that Forsberg was left off - he had a strong start but he really tailed off.  Let's not forget Conacher's strong start in 2013..."
OttawaSenators,33ned3,InTURRISting,3,Fri Apr 24 12:32:52 2015 UTC,yeah but conacher didnt have a playoff hattrick
OttawaSenators,33ned3,broomlad,2,Fri Apr 24 14:03:12 2015 UTC,Calder is for regular season though.
OttawaSenators,33ned3,InTURRISting,2,Fri Apr 24 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing the calder, I'm arguing that comparing him to conacher is ridiculous."
OttawaSenators,33ned3,broomlad,2,Fri Apr 24 14:05:46 2015 UTC,"Then we agree.  I'm saying that it's common for rookies to start the year strong and tail off.  I didn't say they were the same calibre player.    Edit: to clarify, what I meant is that you can't base the Calder trophy on just the beginning of the year either.  That's where I was going with the Conacher comment."

It's not that at all. Montreal earned their wins by the conditions of the time. That fair and legit and they should be respected for that.  What isn't legit is the persistent attitude that those wins means Montreal was and still is god's gift to hockey. That they're a dynasty at or beyond a level like the Yankees.  They aren't god's gift to hockey. And the last 35-40 years are proof of that. As soon as the rest of the clubs matured and learned how to play, Montreal stopped dominating.  I'm a former habs fan. Grew up one. Rubbed this stat in the faces of Leafs fans all the time. But it's bullshit. And the longer the habs go on without a cup, the sillier this stat becomes.  Pretty soon that 24 is gonna be the number of years since a win ;)"

OttawaSenators,33n7o5,lmoj1,12,Thu Apr 23 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"It kinda pisses me off to see people continue to downplay the guy's injury saying it's ""just a MICRO-fracture"" when you can clearly see how it has affected his game in this series. He's still contributing a lot, but his shot definitely seems a little off. That injury could very well be the difference between this series being tied and where we are at now."
OttawaSenators,33n7o5,pooptypeuptypantsss,6,Thu Apr 23 22:54:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to downplay anything. In Swedish we'd call it a crack in the bone, it doesn't sound as misleading and timid as ""a bone bruise"". I had a microfracture in my rib.

Now stone didn't rip his ligament right off, but ligaments and tendons are still fickle as fuck. I forgot about his ligament, and you're right.

OttawaSenators,33me3n,mike-kt,19,Fri Apr 24 13:05:19 2015 UTC,"So many players made massive leaps in their game this season that absolutely no one could've predicted.    Hoffman is on a ""do or die"" last chance one year deal after just showing flashes last season. Stone was injured last season and is on the final year of his ELC. Chiasson was brand new to the team and it wasn't certain how he'd fit in. It's only Ceci's second year in the league. Lazar is still 19 years old and could be in the WHL. Neither Weircioch or Cowen emerged at any point last year as the clearly better player. Methot had serious back concerns and was a UFA who missed half a season.  Mika Zibanejad was asked to take a big leap forward in minutes, and was an average at best 3rd line centre last season.     If you're saying at the beginning of the season you were certain all these players would be active contributors on the roster you're just plain lying.   GMBM did an amazing job to add fall back insurance if these young guys didn't step up. You can't blame GMBM that the coaching/players have done an amazing job and he should've seen it all coming."

OttawaSenators,33me3n,FixedTheNewelPost,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"The current situation and the time of these signings are drastically different situations.    Yes, absolutely there is a bloated press box, but you can have an understanding of why the press box is that busy, instead of just calling it ""a ridiculous amount of bad spending"" like this article does."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,mike-kt,-4,Fri Apr 24 13:50:15 2015 UTC,"Ok but then your argument is that the Sens aren't good at evaluating young talent, so don't get mad at them for poorly identifying older talent.  What about when BM tells us the prospect pipeline is full and Richardson is doing a great job in Bingo? They are proud of what they've built and they do think they've drafted good players. My problem when they signed Legwand was that they continually said they had great young talent and then they didn't make room for it.   If they really are intelligent and wanted to hedge against poor performance, they should have identified defence as their biggest weakness. They could have signed Stralman instead of Michalek and Boro. That would have helped the team way more than keeping a depth winger and a 7th defenceman.   It was ridiculous when Greening, Phillips, Boro and Gryba signed their current contacts, and the pain has only increased.   This team gets it right about 60% of the time (just a feeling) and that's not good enough."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,InTURRISting,8,Thu Apr 23 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"Boro is a great contract.   He is half of a solid bottom pair, will fight, and is a skilled defenseman in this role.  He takes penalties when necessary and not too many bad ones.  For 1 mil a season he is a steal.  He can get the puck deep otherwise pretty stay at home.  Local boy too"
OttawaSenators,33me3n,mike-kt,2,Thu Apr 23 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"I don't appreciate him like you do; I believe Stralman to be a vast improvement over Boro at only the cost of Michalek, a 4th line winger in game 4 making a ton of money.

OttawaSenators,33me3n,walahiguy,4,Fri Apr 24 15:22:20 2015 UTC,You say that as if stralman would have wanted to sign here. Michalek and boro are key pieces on the team

OttawaSenators,33me3n,FixedTheNewelPost,3,Fri Apr 24 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"What I was saying, and what my issue with this article is, is that you can't blame the GM for signing young prospects (Cowen, Lehner, Chiasson), veterans (Phillips, Michalek, Legwand) when there was no certainty that they ALL would be simultaneously be injured/out played given the state of the roster at the time of their contracts.     Legwand right from his signing was brought in to solidify the centre position. If Zibanejad, who had just spent a year bouncing between Spezza's wing, and centre on the 2nd and 3rd lines, wasn't able to step in and be a full time NHL centremen then Legwand would be there to ease the burden on Zibanejad and give him easier minutes. Also, remember that Lazar was in the WHL, Pageau was in the AHL, Hoffman had scored just 3 goals in 25 games, and Stone had 4G/4A in 19 games on the 3rd line.      My problem when they signed Legwand was that they continually said they had great young talent and then they didn't make room for it.   Ottawa does have great young talent(I just listed them), and they have made room. Legwand has been on the 4th line for months, and just spent a game in the press box.    I will agree they carried too many NHL defencemen contracts by most standards, but the latest signings of Boroweicki and Gryba are absolute beauty deals considering what they can both bring to fill out a bottom pairing. It's far from anything worth calling ridiculous.      Weircioch/Cowen signings at the time were two young prospects that are competing for the icetime, neither had been in the lead of that race until Cameron upped Weircioch's usage in January. Neither could hold down a roster spot consistently but were young talented blueliners with potential, what was management to do, flip a coin?  I had waaayyyy too much typed out here in defence of Michalek To summarize: Excellent PK player, MacArthur went down and he contributed on the 2nd line. Two rookies have played so well they've forced a comfortable 2nd liner(Michalek) to be above average 3rd liner, but wait, our young, talented and unexpected 3rd line is on such a damn roll that someone as skilled as Milan Michalek is forced into the 4th friggen line. Its a goddam luxury, not a bad signing by Murray."

Even without any buyouts, we can resign all our players this offseason, wait a year or two of development out, and then get that 18 mill in the bank to spend on high end talent to round out the roster for a cup push."

OttawaSenators,33me3n,mike-kt,-3,Thu Apr 23 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"Who knows whether that is empirically true, but if most teams are worse there's an even greater advantage to be had by maximizing all the limited assets this team has. If the Sens made really good decisions all the time they would be even further ahead of other teams. Instead we're stuck in the middle with no cap space next year.   Wasting money is especially bad for a team that can't afford mistakes like this."

OttawaSenators,33me3n,benches48,2,Thu Apr 23 22:50:02 2015 UTC,"Counting Phillips & Lehner is pretty stupid. They're both injured, and as such will be collecting money from insurance as opposed to Uncle Euge. So that $17.8M is actually $13.081M.  Even $13M is a lot to have sitting on the sidelines, and I think the author's point is still valid. I just wish they wouldn't artificially inflate the total to make a stronger argument."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,ErikKarlssonsTendon,2,Fri Apr 24 01:18:07 2015 UTC,"Good point, but I didn't mean to make it more artificial. I was trying to show how much money was on the cap, and Phillips and Lehner will be there for next year, presumably not on LTIR"
OttawaSenators,33me3n,Lemondish,2,Fri Apr 24 05:20:22 2015 UTC,"Well, sure, but it's unreasonable to assume we'll keep 3 goalies  through the offseason. I also think that although we did carry 8 defencemen this season, we have a pretty good idea what we have now and we can trim fat.  In addition to counting Lehner and Phillips, it's a bit disingenuous to count Neil and Smith, since they are in the lineup at the moment.   As I said before, I think you have a good point, however I think you're trying too hard to fit the numbers to your narrative."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,benches48,3,Fri Apr 24 05:43:08 2015 UTC,"What. the. Fuck? You're paying Cowen of all people 3.1 million? When was the last time he preformed at the quality of his contract (hint: pre-suspension)? As for Phillips, seriously? I swear, whoever is in charge of contracts needs to start paying the contracts by the performance, not by their reputation.   Someone who needs to have the contract like Cowen would definitely Pageau, Lazar, Hoffy or Stone. Seriously, this is a problem similar to the Laffs, they overpay under-preforming players. When was the last time Phillips played anyways?"
OttawaSenators,33me3n,AutoMasta,10,Thu Apr 23 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all fond of shitting on Cowen's contract. It was a calculated gamble on the part of management, the same type of gamble that has Kyle Turris with a $3.5M cap hit or Craig Anderson at $3.2M. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,benches48,2,Thu Apr 23 22:01:39 2015 UTC,Or EK at 6.5  What a steal.
OttawaSenators,33me3n,AutoMasta,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"It's a loss with Cowen, obviously. The guy has not been playing well since his suspension. It's safe to say though, that Turris and Andy have earned their contracts however. Their overall playing has improved significantly considering Andy bounced back from a streak of bad games to come back with a .950+ SV% in the playoffs.  Absolute tank."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,benches48,3,Thu Apr 23 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"Be thankful for that Cowen contract, remember during contract negotiations it was reported they offered him an 8 year deal? God that would have been horrible. Dumb decision by Cowen to decline it."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,AutoMasta,3,Thu Apr 23 22:53:37 2015 UTC,"Dumb-ish.  Kind of glad he did not accept it, since he is logging down cap space, being incredibly useless. I mean, Gryba is able to make the big hits Cowen is and be relatively useful offensively not really but, he has had a couple of good shots and passes"
OttawaSenators,33me3n,benches48,3,Thu Apr 23 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"I think we can all agree that if we spent right up to the cap, no way in hell any of Gryba/Cowen/Borowiecki are on the team. Really need to make some moves in terms of defense this off-season, i think the forward groups are fine. Have to bring in some more defenders that are capable of moving the puck up the ice."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,mike-kt,2,Thu Apr 23 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"We also need a replacement for Legwand. I mean, although the guy did decently considering his role for this year, he's really expensive depth."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,walahiguy,2,Thu Apr 23 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"You're right, I like him as a 4th line centre, depth type player, but he is quite expensive for that role."
OttawaSenators,33me3n,benches48,2,Thu Apr 23 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"What is he paid? 3 mil? Sorry Leggy, but that's too much.  I suggested on another thread that we call up either Dunn from the Q or De Costa from the KHL so that we can develop some of our bottom 6 prospects (since, let's be real, all of our actual prospects minus a few are already playing in the NHL).  After this year, I do believe that we need to cut losses and release some guys who have been holding the team back. Maybe we trade Chiasson and keep Neil in the line ....? since Neil appears to be more of the ""in your face, crowd + momentum"" kind of guy while Chiasson has managed to get on Cameron's bad side somehow."

But why the hell they have him on an analyst panel is beyond me. Not that the others are necessarily top notch, but they each at least have some kind of hockey or hockey media background on which you can justify their presence.   I've heard the argument that Strombo offers more of a ""fan insight"" of an average viewer. Which sounds good on paper, but when it's actually a ""habs fan's insight"" it suddenly becomes very unprofessional. At least balance it out by having a local media guy in for the shows who sympathetic to the opposite team (like Ian Mendes for us, or an equivalent non-TSN person). It saddens me that I now often prefer to watch an away stream over HNIC when possible, because it's often more insightful/interesting."

Price faced under 25 shots in every game except the USA and Healy even mentioned in game 2 or 3 that Price sometimes went 11 minutes in between shots. He really didn't have to be spectacular with that team.

OttawaSenators,33l513,evilJaze,11,Fri Apr 24 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"This isn't anything new. I haven't been able to stomach any Rogers/CBC broadcasts of Sens games for a while. It's so bad in this series in particular that, and I really can't believe I'd even consider making this claim, that I'd take Bob Cole over the current cast of homers. TSN has been the only broadcaster who has done it right. Guess that's what happens when you lose the rights but can spend on talent.  I think some of the most glaring examples lately, and I'll use last night as an example (I'll admit I did see these sentiments mentioned during the GDT in /r/hockey last night but they really hit home for this particular point), are the coverage of Hoffman's goal, and an apparently missed high stick.  It's amazing the coverage that they were giving to PK's incredible 130 km/hr shot (and it was an excellent shot), yet 0 talk on Hoffman's goal which crested past 120. It's not quite in the same ball park, but that's hella fast.  The ""missed"" high stick was talked about over and over for quite some time in the 2nd IIRC, when in reality it was a result of a cut caused by the Habs player's helmet from either a check, blocked shot, or the ice upon contact. Wish I could recall the details a bit better.  TL;DR: CBC/Rogers broadcasts are shit. TSN should have exclusive rights, but it'll never happen. Hoffman's shot deserved more attention, and LOL ""missed"" high stick."
OttawaSenators,33l513,X0bi1e,5,Thu Apr 23 15:30:03 2015 UTC,At the beginning of the season I was cursing because I had to go and spend extra to get the TSN channels added to my package (we only had basic cable) just to watch the Sens play.  But now I can't even stomach the crap CBC is feeding us right now.  Money well spent IMO.
OttawaSenators,33l513,chsh,7,Thu Apr 23 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it is. I've been privileged to have had access to the TSN channels for quite some time, and there's absolutely no comparison to the quality they've managed to deliver. I find that they do a reasonable job staying unbiased (there's still some pull for the canadian teams for sure, and they definitely sound like they pull for Ottawa, if only for the amazing story), and I look forward to the analysis they provide."

If it was any other player on that team they would have tucked it. Prust is a PK specialist, 4th line grinder, ""enforcer"" and has the worst hands/speed combo on the Habs. The fact that he almost scored was probably a surprise to everyone, including Prust lol.  He's joked before that if he gets a breakaway he'll probably just dump it into the corner and start the cycle."
OttawaSenators,33kit7,Backfire16,6,Thu Apr 23 17:28:11 2015 UTC,I could say the same thing about any time that Condra has gotten a breakaway on a PK pretty much ever.  And that's a large number.

OttawaSenators,33lif5,Gonzanic,6,Thu Apr 23 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"If I were in the ref's shoes and saw that, I would most likely have made a call in the moment. Good thing I'm not a ref.  Right before getting hit, Gilbert dishes the puck and turns into a vulnerable position. Arguably, Zibanejad still had just enough time to let up, but in a high-pressure situation, it's not only totally understandable he'd finish his check, but what any coach/knowledgeable hockey follower would advocate: finish your check.  I don't ever like seeing players get hurt, and it doesn't look like Gilbert does, but you also can't just put yourself into a vulnerable position (I'd deem it last moment in this case), and expect a call to be made.  I think this is entirely a clean play. No charge, no intent to injure/board, and the questionable outcome of the hit is a result of Gilbert putting himself into a vulnerable position at the very last moment. Doesn't give Zibby much time to let up, and there isn't really much else he could have done imo."
OttawaSenators,33lif5,benches48,2,Thu Apr 23 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah you nailed it.  Flubs and freezes/turns his numbers to potentially save the play.   Good hockey iq on both sides.  As a ref, Id say nice try Gilbert, I wont call the dive and you're even."

First game all series where they actually dictated the flow of the game and had consistent pressure in the Montreal end. Didn't feel like the Habs bought their A game except for Price. I was getting nervous that we were gonna go to OT again and have our season ended by some fuckin 4th liner from Montreal.   Zibanejad was a monster tonight. He was very noticeable and creating shots and chances all game.   We need to figure out how to get more than 1 damn goal on Price. He;s just so hard to beat but I feel we need atleast 2 or 3 to be able to comfortably beat these guys

OttawaSenators,33o3d9,mikehofbrauhaus,5,Fri Apr 24 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"We have been one of the most penalized teams in the league for the past few seasons. Mtl draws more penalties than almost any other team. There's no conspiracy, we just take a lot of stupid penalties combined with rotten luck.  Though it's funny to see Habs fans have 3 powerplays in a row then flip out when they get called for something blatent and claim the refs are against them."
OttawaSenators,33o3d9,e_cybo_pooch,8,Fri Apr 24 04:09:41 2015 UTC,"Relevant stats on our penalties taken/drawn (per war-on-ice):   2012-2013: Maclean, 48 games played   Penalties Taken: 239 (6th highest) Penalties Drawn: 229 (10th highest) Penalty Differential: -10 (25th highest) Differential Percentage: 48.9% (25th highest)  2013-2014: Maclean, 82 games played   Penalties Taken: 435 (1st highest. aka worst) Penalties Drawn: 390 (4th highest) Penalty Differential: -45 (30th highest, aka worst) Differential Percentage: 47.2% (29th highest)  2014-2015: Maclean, 27 games played   Penalties Taken: 135 (6th highest) Penalties Drawn: 136 (3rd highest) Penalty Differential: +1 (16th highest) Differential Percentage: 50.2% (16th highest)  2014-2015: Cameron, 55 games played    Penalties Taken: 206 (16th highest) Penalties Drawn: 230 (7th highest) Penalty Differential: +24 (6th highest) Differential Percentage: 52.8% (6th highest)    In summary, under Maclean we were consistently one of the best penalty drawing teams, but simultaneously worse for taking penalties, generally leading to VERY poor differentials. Cameron is typically a harsher disciplinarian from everything we've seen/heard, and injuries/scratches to Neil/Smith have seriously curbed our penalties taken to the point that we're now average in that category (woohoo!). However we've maintained our good record of drawing penalties, leading to an excellent differential. Under Cameron, players with notably good penalty differentials include Pageau (+11) and Zbad (+8), meanwhile Chiasson (-6) and Gryba (-8) are our worst offenders."

OttawaSenators,33jo69,aMinnesotaBro,18,Thu Apr 23 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"Some interesting and rather extreme trends to observe from some of the stats tonight. Clearly effective, but abnormal no less:   Both the Hoff/Zbad/Ryan and Milo/Smith/Neil lines had staggering 100% offensive zone starts. They never started a shift in our zone, only in Montreal's or in the neutral zone. Consequently, the other two lines had ~30% or less offensive zone starts. Pageau's line got killed for the most part, but (to be confirmed) I suspect they got the brunt of the top line assignments against Pacioretty & Co. and still generated some ntable scoring chances. Hoff/Zbad/Ryan played 3rd line minutes(~13-14min), while the Pageau line played 2nd line minutes (~15-19min). Ceci generally had another poor night possession-wise. Despite hugely favourable zone starts (88% in the offensive zone), he was ~50% CF% which is in the negative relative to the team. Hope we see him turn it around soon, not bee a great series for him to date (our worst possession dman, which is saying a lot given our third pair and the fact that Wier has managed good numbers through it somehow). The nice feed to Hoffman was excellent though, so credit to him for that. ""Face-off violation"" penalty my ass."
OttawaSenators,33jo69,Omega613,4,Thu Apr 23 02:07:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, you're not wrong, but I think you're doing a bit of injustice to Ceci. He had a good game by the eye test, no turnovers, and no major lapses in defensive positioning/coverage. He had a EV CF% of ~55% compared to the teams ~60%, and an EV FF% of ~59% compared to the teams ~61%. That's not poor, that's just weaker than the rest of the team.  And in the same vein as your hunch of Pageau and co., the forwards he lined up against most were Desharnais, DSP, Eller, Weise, and Pacioretty. He was also mainly opposite Markov and Subban. (from war-on-ice). As far as CF% is concerned, the only players he was below 50% against were DSP, Desharnais, Pacioretty, Subban, and Petry.(natural stat trick) It's hard to contain Subban and Pacioretty even when you're starting in the O-Zone.   (Natural stat trick puts him up against DSP, Desharnais, Pacioretty, Markov, and Gilbert the most at EV. Subban scoots up their in all scenarios. Don't know what war-on-ice times are from, as they're slightly different from natural stat tricks)"
OttawaSenators,33jo69,Iphikratous3,2,Thu Apr 23 01:45:30 2015 UTC,"RE Ceci: For sure, and that's why I was trying to be careful with my phrasing to say ""poor night possession-wise"". Unlike moments in the last couple games, I agree that qualitatively I didn't see any egregious mistakes (certainly none that stick out in my memory, which is a good sign in itself), in fact I saw a handful of good moves, his assist being one of them. However my criticism for Ceci right now is that Wiercioch is carrying him to an extent when we look beyond the individual plays. It was arguably less visible/statistically impactful tonight, but Wiercioch was his partner for over half their time on ice. Ceci with Wiercioch had a CF% of 56% (56% at EV), but without Wier he drops to 44% (50% at EV), which is much more worrying when you consider that (a) that negative relative to the team's performance tonight, and (b) he had immensely favourable zone starts (again, >85%!). On the flip side, let's look at Wiercioch, who equally played a little over 10 minutes of his ~20 minute night with Ceci. Wiercioch with Ceci was (as we determined) 56% (56% EV) CF%, but without Ceci he rather comically rises to 100% (100% EV) with the same zone usage. If we go back to last game, Ceci/Wiercioch together were at 41% (41% EV), but Ceci without Wier dropped to 12% (0% at EV), and Wier without Ceci rose to 59% (55% EV) - this all came in a game in which the Sens as a team were around ~43% CF, so Ceci on ice wasn't exactly contributing positively to possession, nor was he tonight. If you go back further in the series, it's much of the same.  Sufficed to say, I really wish we had 1 more top-4 capable guy so we could shelter Ceci a little bit better. However, that's not the case and I'm very proud of everything Ceci has managed (beyond just this series). He's really developing both his defensive and offensive game, and as such a young player I can't help but be excited at the earlier signs, and despite his possession hurdles I still trust him more out there most of the time than Boro/Gryba/Cowen/Phillips. Afterall, not every young dman will be like Ekblad out of the gate, and I'm happy to wait and watch Ceci grow. But for now, he's not been good this series and there's little we can do about it beyond observe and comment."

OttawaSenators,33jo69,housewife_hell,3,Thu Apr 23 01:40:10 2015 UTC,So you're saying it's a proud Montreal tradition?
OttawaSenators,33jo69,freisenburger,5,Thu Apr 23 01:41:34 2015 UTC,Well proud is a strong word. I'd put poutine in the proud category. Broomsticks wind up somewhere in the same pride territory as rioting....
OttawaSenators,33jo69,winemaster,8,Thu Apr 23 02:04:49 2015 UTC,I'm not even a Senators fan and I'm on my feet! Wooooooo!

OttawaSenators,33jo69,jamishthegreat,6,Thu Apr 23 01:38:36 2015 UTC,lets talk about that face-off.
OttawaSenators,33jo69,mchien777,5,Thu Apr 23 02:26:30 2015 UTC,Great game! Here's to the reverse sweep!
OttawaSenators,33jo69,healthyj,7,Thu Apr 23 01:45:45 2015 UTC,Section 319 was bonanza tonight!
OttawaSenators,33jo69,matty323,3,Thu Apr 23 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"They were killing it, was really impressed."
OttawaSenators,33jo69,InTURRISting,20,Thu Apr 23 01:50:54 2015 UTC,I just want to say that was very weak goal by Carey Price.   The habs are done  Clearly they need to put in Tokarski   GIF  And thank you Papa Strombo for allowing us Ottawa Fans to see another game.  I also want to say I love how Ottawa controlled this game from start to finish  But we can't think Montreal is going to let us do this again
OttawaSenators,33jo69,french_poast,15,Thu Apr 23 02:02:44 2015 UTC,Huh? That just looked like a great screen to me. :/ Give your guys some credit.
OttawaSenators,33jo69,InTURRISting,16,Thu Apr 23 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"Oh dude, I'm just mimicking Habs fans cockiness on that one.  Price was amazing all night long."

OttawaSenators,33jo69,locoda047,12,Thu Apr 23 01:51:12 2015 UTC,"The first period was close; the second period, we got better; the third period, we were lights out. The Habs were not able to contain our speed and they looked lazy.  With Hoffman back on the Zib/Ryan line and Andy playing like a boss, we have a comeback in the making."
OttawaSenators,33jo69,iPoop20,9,Thu Apr 23 01:53:23 2015 UTC,We need our kid line to produce too though. A couple of Pageau goals could go a longggg way for us. They didn't play too badly tonight though. But I'd like to see them shoot more.
OttawaSenators,33jo69,karma911,4,Thu Apr 23 02:13:44 2015 UTC,It would help if they didn't spend 10-15 minutes on the PK every game.
OttawaSenators,33jo69,Neuromotorized,5,Thu Apr 23 01:42:58 2015 UTC,I love everything!

I've been planning a trip that presents Montreal as a key component of our Canadian identity to my American (eventual wife and future Canadian). How do I do this when I've cursed their name in this playoff series so hard?  Where the hell can we go where I can show the French culture without hockey getting in the way lol
OttawaSenators,33jo69,matty323,5,Thu Apr 23 12:32:01 2015 UTC,Go to Montreal.  Its a big place.

OttawaSenators,33jo69,untitleddocument37,2,Thu Apr 23 16:50:00 2015 UTC,I like their strat of not going gangbusters in the 1st only to lose in the 2nd.    3 solid periods of hockey => win.

OttawaSenators,33jwsd,detroyer,2,Thu Apr 23 04:53:49 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does that net look comically large around Andy from the angle this was taken?

OttawaSenators,33js6s,austenzo,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:51:32 2015 UTC,It really is about the xp. Anderson is clearly showing it in his play style. Cool as a Price cucumber.
OttawaSenators,33js6s,Lanhdanan,3,Thu Apr 23 15:45:21 2015 UTC,As is expected.
OttawaSenators,33js6s,Stinky-pickle,3,Thu Apr 23 02:19:20 2015 UTC,Was there any doubt about this?
OttawaSenators,33js6s,DragonPC-ca,2,Thu Apr 23 13:57:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be upset seeing Hammond play game one IF we make it to the next round.   Gives Anderson a break and we know that Hammond is capable.   That being said I'm also ok with riding Anderson the whole way as long as he keeps playing the same way he did last night.
OttawaSenators,33js6s,screechop,4,Thu Apr 23 13:14:03 2015 UTC,But Hammond got us to the playoffs! /s
OttawaSenators,33js6s,broomlad,2,Thu Apr 23 10:35:37 2015 UTC,Way to minimize his contribution.
OttawaSenators,33js6s,MarkMech,2,Thu Apr 23 14:34:59 2015 UTC,That's not what my sarcasm was aimed at.  I'm poking fun at all the people who were sure that Anderson was not the answer and the wrong decision to start last night.
OttawaSenators,33js6s,broomlad,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:39:58 2015 UTC,Retracted then. I don't get why there's two camps. I can appreciate what both goalies brought and continue to bring to the table!
OttawaSenators,33js6s,MarkMech,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:48:55 2015 UTC,Hammond isn't bringing anything to the table any more. He's been very average as of late.
OttawaSenators,33js6s,broomlad,0,Fri Apr 24 12:24:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree.  I just disagree with most of the people yesterday who thought that putting in Anderson was the wrong call because Hammond was the one who got them into the playoffs when they were so far out."
OttawaSenators,33js6s,valleygoat,0,Thu Apr 23 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. The argument for putting Hammond in the first two games because of the playoff run was a good one, I'll give them that. However, Hammond was a little sloppy those 2 games and now its time for Anderson to step in."

OttawaSenators,33jupw,NortonFord,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:19:30 2015 UTC,No bathroom Breaks throughout the game.  Switched where I was sitting and what I was wearing from the first three games.
OttawaSenators,33jupw,InexcusablyAngry,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:24:34 2015 UTC,My wife couldn't handle the pressure and stopped watching before the first three games ended.  I made her finish this one.

OttawaSenators,33idjm,thekindlyman555,2,Wed Apr 22 21:23:19 2015 UTC,I'm in.

OttawaSenators,33idjm,uhoh_spaghetti_0,2,Thu Apr 23 02:13:48 2015 UTC,I'm in!
OttawaSenators,33idjm,InTURRISting,8,Wed Apr 22 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"Everyone, the whole church of Turris even, is behind Bobby!      I'm just glad he doesn't seem to be letting this brutal slump dictate the rest of his play, which has been 100% effort and lead by example."
OttawaSenators,33idjm,Do_Whatever_You_Like,4,Wed Apr 22 19:53:03 2015 UTC,Players of that caliber can't slump forever.   Let's just hope he gets out now
OttawaSenators,33idjm,Circletwerk42,2,Thu Apr 23 05:39:12 2015 UTC,ayoooooo
OttawaSenators,33idjm,SirZapdos,6,Sat Apr 25 04:19:19 2015 UTC,robert pls
OttawaSenators,33idjm,Akoustyk,5,Thu Apr 23 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"In Game 1, his even-strength Corsi For % was 25% (terrible). In Game 2, it was 79% (outstanding) although the sample size was small. Game 3, it was 35% (terrible), but yesterday, it was 72% (again, outstanding).  Yesterday, Hoffman was 86% and Zibanejad was 80%. Translation: 6-93-68 DOMINATED possession. If Bobby, Mika and Mike can keep playing like they did yesterday, then the Sens have a chance to extend the series even further.  The question becomes, why the heck wasn't Hoffman playing with Bobby and Mika in Games 1, 2 and 3?"
OttawaSenators,33idjm,Iphikratous3,3,Thu Apr 23 13:28:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I'm worried also that Bobby Ryan is not the offensive player we thought he was. Idk if I would have given him the contract he has. I would have given him that salary but for shorter term, or a lesser salary for a longer term.   It's sometimes hard to tell if a player does well because of the team mates he has, or whether he can be a big factor on any team.   Imo he hadn't proven himself in Ottawa yet, at the time of his contract. But I certainly hope he gets out of his funk and starts being the offensive threat we need him to be."
OttawaSenators,33idjm,galloots,5,Wed Apr 22 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"That's a legitimate concern, but we haven't seen a 100% healthy Bobby yet. He was on pace for his best season before he suffered the sports hernia last year. This season, before the extremely unlucky slump he went through, he was still on pace for over 60 points and a career high in assists, in spite of a broke finger that needed freezing before every game. We may not have gotten the offensive output we expected when trading for him, but he is very good defensively, and suffered from injuries through his tenure here.   I think he will make a case for the contract next year, with a full season under Dave Cameron, and playing with a more developed Zibanejad."
OttawaSenators,33idjm,Alex_Scott,3,Wed Apr 22 23:01:42 2015 UTC,I wanted to suggest this! I hope that the arena fans agree!

Love that last comment by the CBC broadcasters on Condras play ""nice play by subban"", yeah lets just ignore the fact that Condra kept the puck alive and erased another 20 seconds off the clock. Subban did nothing there. Christ....."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,zdelusion,11,Thu Apr 23 01:38:19 2015 UTC,Conda's clock awareness is one of his best qualities. He's always finding ways to kill extra seconds on the penalty kill or at the end of the game. He's a fuckin beaut.

OttawaSenators,33j1ju,zdelusion,6,Thu Apr 23 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"THE GODS ARE WITH US! SHUTOUT FOR ANDY, OUR PLAYOFF LORD AND SAVIOR sorry Turris"
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,InTURRISting,4,Thu Apr 23 01:38:13 2015 UTC,Habs fans have showed up to the game with sirens and brooms.. I expect a few fights tonight.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Billsncowboys,6,Wed Apr 22 22:35:27 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks it's ridiculous that CBC doesn't even have pregame coverage? They're showing the fucking Coronation Street right now
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,chardychar,8,Wed Apr 22 22:56:33 2015 UTC,Refs trying to give the scabs the game early.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,random_monkey,6,Wed Apr 22 23:42:33 2015 UTC,Condra's a pretty classy guy. Plus that shot of his was pretty close to going in.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,iPoop20,7,Wed Apr 22 23:46:43 2015 UTC,I'm glad he has found his place on our team.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,MichelangeBro,3,Wed Apr 22 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"I do too. He needs more goals (career # being 33) but that number should and will be going up over the years if he continues to get better. He may be 28 years old, but he's still as vibrant as Pageau and Lazar, which is fantastic."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,i-am-the-walrus789,6,Wed Apr 22 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"I don't get how we got a cross check that one time, but the Montreal player just did the exact same thing, no call. Picture of this series."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,DShKM,8,Thu Apr 23 00:12:33 2015 UTC,Sens won the face off we need a do=over!
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,galloots,5,Thu Apr 23 00:20:50 2015 UTC,What? A penalty against the habs? Is that even possible?
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,random_monkey,7,Thu Apr 23 00:31:12 2015 UTC,Dat grin on Andy :]
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Iphikratous3,5,Thu Apr 23 00:34:46 2015 UTC,Can't be many games this season that the Sens have taken into the third with no goals on either side.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,theeverlastinglight1,8,Thu Apr 23 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"I think we decided to throw them off - instead of losing a lead, we decided to just not play with a lead at all. I like it! :)"
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,DShKM,10,Thu Apr 23 00:46:33 2015 UTC,Score with one second left in the third. Good plan.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,NDstorm,5,Thu Apr 23 00:47:43 2015 UTC,Well... Time for the most nervous 20 minutes of the season
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,InTURRISting,6,Thu Apr 23 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"About as blatant ""too many men"" as you can get."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Hillstylelife,8,Thu Apr 23 01:10:31 2015 UTC,"I love Andy too guys,  but we don't need to chant him right now, he cant score our goals too! or can he?"
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Xhwag,5,Thu Apr 23 01:10:43 2015 UTC,Can we call up the refs from little league?
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,AutoMasta,7,Thu Apr 23 01:10:51 2015 UTC,Lol thanks romanuk.  You just had to say the word.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,InTURRISting,5,Thu Apr 23 01:15:36 2015 UTC,FUCK YEEEEAAAH!!!
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,evilJaze,6,Thu Apr 23 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"Mike ""The Sniper"" Hoffman! Woohoo!"

OttawaSenators,33j1ju,T-ohm-y,7,Thu Apr 23 01:15:55 2015 UTC,CAREY PRICE IS FAR TOO GOOD TO LET A MAN WITH A BROKEN WRIST SCORE ON HIM
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,InTURRISting,7,Thu Apr 23 01:19:49 2015 UTC,COTTON EYE JOE
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,DShKM,7,Thu Apr 23 01:26:34 2015 UTC,That Bobby chant and the goal...it's just what the line needed
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,AutoMasta,6,Thu Apr 23 01:28:37 2015 UTC,"NOT A SWEEP, NOT A SWEEP"

OttawaSenators,33j1ju,T-ohm-y,16,Thu Apr 23 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"gallagher can hit our fucking goalie though, ok. imagine if that was price, woulda been jumped."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,zdelusion,5,Thu Apr 23 00:39:49 2015 UTC,"Nice little defensive play by Hoffman there, glad to see Cameron reunite that trio early in the game, they've looked pretty good so far."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Billsncowboys,6,Wed Apr 22 23:40:01 2015 UTC,<3 that Participaction ad.  Don't visit our website!  Love it
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,MichelangeBro,3,Wed Apr 22 23:42:22 2015 UTC,If Montreal doesn't get the next penalty...
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,NDstorm,5,Wed Apr 22 23:45:24 2015 UTC,"does anyone have the powerplay numbers for MTL - OTT? Gotta be insanely lopsided, right?"
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,chardychar,7,Wed Apr 22 23:46:19 2015 UTC,Well I asked after last game and someone posted it but mtl fans down voted him so much he deleted it I think or it got hidden
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,SHOW_ME_YOUR_GROWLER,4,Wed Apr 22 23:47:25 2015 UTC,Another 1st period dominated by the sens. Please follow up well sens
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Geoff819,5,Wed Apr 22 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"Might be a long time before you get another PP boys, bury this one."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,zdelusion,5,Thu Apr 23 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"Power play looked real good, I wonder if it's benefiting from Legwand not being on the first unit."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,zdelusion,4,Thu Apr 23 00:15:26 2015 UTC,What a playoff quality penalty right there
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,AutoMasta,6,Thu Apr 23 00:20:36 2015 UTC,THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,SHOW_ME_YOUR_GROWLER,5,Thu Apr 23 00:20:39 2015 UTC,WHAT?!?

OttawaSenators,33j1ju,InTURRISting,4,Thu Apr 23 00:37:22 2015 UTC,I really feel like it should be Zibby on the point with Karlsson on the PP.  He has a better clapper than Hoffman
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,i-am-the-walrus789,6,Thu Apr 23 00:37:47 2015 UTC,Huge fucking save by Andy.  Emelin is a piece of shit.  I'm kind of glad Mike Johnson is there to balance the retardedness of Healy and Romanuk.
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Hillstylelife,5,Thu Apr 23 00:44:07 2015 UTC,That powerplay pressure. Holy crap. I think luck may have just picked a side in this game.  We didn't really need luck anyways. The Gods are on our side tonight!
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Billsncowboys,4,Thu Apr 23 00:53:07 2015 UTC,Bobby Ryan flairs everyone! He's gonna pot one! I can feel it
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,AutoMasta,3,Thu Apr 23 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"Christ Pageau, even I heard the ref saying it was out."
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,galloots,6,Thu Apr 23 01:01:11 2015 UTC,Did they just mention Anderson in the same sentence as Price... what is life
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,DShKM,6,Thu Apr 23 01:06:39 2015 UTC,ANDY ANDY ANDY
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,zdelusion,6,Thu Apr 23 01:09:36 2015 UTC,"Pick your team, pick your channel. What if the right channel isn't playing my game? I miss TSN. :("

OttawaSenators,33j1ju,Valentine96,6,Thu Apr 23 01:22:22 2015 UTC,mike johnson defended sens coaching!

OttawaSenators,33j1ju,NDstorm,5,Thu Apr 23 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"In the immortal words if Jack Eichel, ""Buffalo Montreal, WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!"""
OttawaSenators,33j1ju,MichelangeBro,6,Thu Apr 23 01:37:54 2015 UTC,FUCK YOU CBC! WHY ARE INTERVIEWING THE 2ND STAR OF THE NIGHT?! He missed his call!
OttawaSenators,33k6aa,Starky_D,2,Thu Apr 23 04:22:15 2015 UTC,I have thought this for a while. Bobbles a lot of pucks and his shot is not as hard or accurate as it used to be as well.
OttawaSenators,33k6aa,infinitygoof,2,Thu Apr 23 17:39:51 2015 UTC,I was at last night's game and got to look at things behind the play -I saw Ryan holding his hand a lot after coming out of corner battles. Definitely still hurting.
OttawaSenators,33k6aa,InnocentGun,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:57:13 2015 UTC,Hmm I feel ignorant. When did he injure his hand?
OttawaSenators,33k6aa,Mik0n,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:53:04 2015 UTC,"Back early January I think. Not sure, anyone want to provide something?"
OttawaSenators,33k6aa,benches48,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:30:02 2015 UTC,"I looked it up. Late November, broken finger."
OttawaSenators,33k6aa,Mik0n,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:35:31 2015 UTC,"Cue collective ooh's  Broken fingers are assholes to recover from. Probably because no matter how long it takes, if it even gets a slight amount of pressure or stress, it'll hurt. As well, Ryan's finger may have not been healed 100% when he got back from the injury so there's always that."
OttawaSenators,33k6aa,benches48,0,Fri Apr 24 00:38:04 2015 UTC,"""Still"" injured, I doubt. It doesn't usually take that long for a healthy individual to heal some more minor breaks. However, re-injured is completely plausible. Players seem to slash one another's gloves a bit too frequently, and it often goes unnoticed, although you would expect one of the reporters to pick up on some form of hand strapping/padding/bandaging in one of his numerous interviews over the last few month. So if he's injured, I'm guessing it's not a finger injury again."
