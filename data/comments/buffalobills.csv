The NFL, however, sets up a big festival area outside the stadium and they have beer stands and such.    You need a game ticket to get into the official tailgate.  Scalping is illegal and the cops take it very seriously.  So if you're going to the game, it's best to have tickets in hand.

I can confirm that Old Bay is used as frequently as Frank's on just about everything in Maryland and increases in frequency as you head toward Baltimore.   Old Bay wings are real good. You want the wet ones not the dry ones. The dry Old Bay wings are OK but you need a little sauce to take it up a notch.   I haven't been to iBar but I'll check it out next time I'm up there.

You'll get some shit-talking, especially if the game goes poorly for the Bills. But most of it will be good natured, and any of it that is not will not be part of a huge crowd harassing you. If I were a fan of another team, I would not hesitate to wear my jersey, and I have friends who are Dolphins and Patriots fans and wear theirs to games regularly with no repercussions.   The may important question is whether you can be relaxed and friendly even when someone's giving you some shit. If you're the kind of guy that lets that stuff roll off and can keep a smile and make sure your banter seems friendly, you should have no qualms. Enjoy!"

Look, a bunch of people are going to fart in each others' faces, South Park style, and tell you that it's a friendly environment as long as you're nice.  They're wrong.  I am proud of RWS and I am proud of our tailgate culture.  It's either us or KC, but we're 1 and 2 no matter what and always will be.  But Buffalo football fans (not hockey) are not nice. I have had to push Charger fans out of the way of harm just 'cause I'm a human being and didn't want carnage.  I have seen Jets fans hit with bottles.  I do not think our stadium is so special that it is safe for any opponent's fans.  It's the same--or worse--as any that you've been to.  You asked in /r/buffalobills, so, of course, you've got our civic pride responding. I am here to suffer downvotes and tell you that no, you should NOT wear your Jeff Saturday jersey; you should NOT wear blue and white (unless with red trim) and you should be careful.

Since we are saying unpopular things I think the crowd at the Sabres games sucks. The ""cultured"" and ""family friendly"" atmosphere means some idiot in a Montreal jersey can act like a dickhead without repercussions. Meanwhile fans continue to have conversations and check their email on their phones while goals are scored.

buffalobills,3dy7ic,McRiot3,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:24 2015 UTC,This is pretty much what I was going to post. It helps that most Bills fans are pretty ambivalent about the Colts.

If the colts win (especially a close game) and you present yourself as an obvious colts fan i strongly suggest taking that jersey off and quietly escort yourself from he stadium  Too often ive seen drunken bills fans plow through opponents' fans faces on the way out of the stadium.

buffalobills,3dz58f,iwantthatpurpledrank,4,Mon Jul 20 18:36:53 2015 UTC,He's of an unknown value in the nfl. I personally think no matter who starts its not gunna be pretty but it'll be managable. Tyrod could add another layer to our offense with his scrambling skills. I think having Tyrod on the roster is great for pushing Manuel to get out there and sling it.
buffalobills,3dz58f,Tittycommander420,5,Mon Jul 20 19:00:29 2015 UTC,If he wins the camp battle it's either really good or really bad for us. I don't think anyone can convince you he's our man because he hasn't seen any quality starting time in the nfl.
buffalobills,3dz58f,methothimself,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"So on the converse of your last statement, would you consider his supporters, and by that I mean people calling for him to start, fairly crazy?"

buffalobills,3dz58f,NicCages,3,Mon Jul 20 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"At this point, it's just as crazy to condemn him as it is to support him."
buffalobills,3dz58f,Nomad86x,4,Mon Jul 20 20:43:36 2015 UTC,I say we wait for somebody to win the job before we desperately cling to the notion that they can be a good NFL starting QB.
buffalobills,3dz58f,pixel_pete,4,Mon Jul 20 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"Taylor's biggest strength is his mobility. Guys like Kaep, Wilson, and Newton have succeeded in the league while using their legs as a weapon (as opposed to just an escape route). Especially in our situation with a questionable O-line, having a QB that can extend plays with his legs and run the option is a huge plus. Maybe he's not a great pure passer but with Harvin, Watkins, and Woods as our three main targets we should aim for an offense that generates a lot of YACs rather than just bombing the ball deep. Taylor can and has run an offense like that, but there's not enough evidence to say whether or not he can do so in the NFL. The dude is in spectacular condition and has spent his NFL career learning from the most elite QB in the league. What he lacks in on-field experience he handily makes up elsewhere. Really the only downside to him is we just don't know how good of a passer he is. He could be a great one, in which case he's an absolute steal and should definitely start. Even if he's not a great one he seems like a much better version of Thad Lewis who can play second string and win games in the event of injury.  I personally want to see Manuel start, but playing Devil's Advocate I thought I'd give you my analysis of Taylor's strengths. Unfortunately I don't think training camp or the preseason will tell us anything we don't already know. This is just a decision that Ryan and the staff have to make and see how it plays out in the season."
buffalobills,3dz58f,Vanderbeek1312,3,Mon Jul 20 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"I think that the only QB that we know what type of production they will have is Cassel. He's the only QB that has enough of an established body of work to make a fair assessment, and it's not great. I am neither for or against EJ or Tyrod, but I don't think they have enough work under their belts to make a fair judgement of their abilities. I honestly think the difference maker and person who will make the greatest impact for our QB situation is Greg Roman. I don't think that Kaepernick is a great QB by any means and if you look at the stats from their 2012 Superbowl run, they weren't a great passing team either. EJ was most compared to Kaep coming into his draft, not in size speed or strength, but overall style of play.  Taylor is definitely more mobile and faster than EJ but both are mobile style QB's which should play well into Roman's system. So basically I'm looking forward to drafting a QB next year if neither QB pans out."
buffalobills,3dz58f,bittjt71,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:30 2015 UTC,Having this conversation on WGR right now!!!
buffalobills,3dz58f,PJHFortyTwo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:56:19 2015 UTC,"He played very well in college, and unlike EJ or Cassel, we haven't seen what he can do in the NFL yet, so there's really no reason to doubt him yet. (Don't knock the pie till you've had a slice). Furthermore he is a Kaepernick clone and Roman has had success working with that type of qb. Also I remember watching him in college and he has a cannon for an arm. Ideally he learned a lot from Harbaugh as a backup and he learned a lot about the game. If Taylor starts in the fall it means Roman wants a mobile qb, Taylor learned as a backup (not unprecedented), his arm strength would indicate Roman wants to go deep with Woods/Watkins, and that he beat EJ in short to intermediate throws,"

buffalobills,3dx8jd,bittjt71,9,Mon Jul 20 07:54:06 2015 UTC,Colts is a push. I think they rely way too much on Andrew Luck so if you can shut down the pass you win that game. Could go either way though. Our defense going up against a strong passing team after having nothing but our three QBs to practice against could be rough.   I think we sweep the Dolphins this year. We've beaten them 3 out of the last 4 times and the one win they did have over us was when our offense was playing like shit on top of the refs handing out freebies towards them. I think they've done a terrible job of building a team around Tannehil and they broke the bank on a player they really didn't need.   Cowboys are also a push. They play better on the road and they got the good Oline. They're not gonna be playing as good of a defensive line as ours this season so there's the chance we could be pretty disruptive. I think that game is gonna come down to how our offense is shaping up at that point.
buffalobills,3dx8jd,JoesShittyOs,2,Mon Jul 20 09:07:49 2015 UTC,The great thing about the Dallas game is it's in December so hopefully we will have some snow which will take away their biggest threat

buffalobills,3dx8jd,StuffedCheesyCrust,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:33 2015 UTC,"All of those games are winnable and could go either way. Considering that we play the Dolphins 2x, I think we win at least 3 out of 5 of those games. I like our chances against the Dolphins and Colts."
buffalobills,3dx8jd,BuffaloWilliamses,3,Mon Jul 20 11:04:24 2015 UTC,"Finally someone else that agrees that the Phins are mad overrated  However, almost every other team listed is very far from overrated so the author's credibility now comes into question."
buffalobills,3dx8jd,MilesHighClub_,3,Mon Jul 20 11:29:26 2015 UTC,Every year the dolphins have improved on paper. Each year Tannehill statistically improves.  But every year they are 8-8.   All the hype completely ignores their biggest issue which is consistency. It doesn't matter how good the stats or players are if it doesn't translate to wins.
buffalobills,3dx8jd,Billionaire_Bot,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"3-1/2-2. I think the Colts will definitely be tough, but it's really hard to say. I'm excited to see that defense. I wouldn't be surprised if they were to go 4-0. Too early to tell though."
buffalobills,3dx8jd,B1995,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going with 3-2, dropping the fins game in Miami, and <sigh> Dallas..."
buffalobills,3dx8jd,CaptainExpletive,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:01 2015 UTC,I think we match up against the colts very well good defense that'll force luck to throw into some questionable situations. And no strength in the middle of their d-line I expect shady torches their defense.   The fins don't scare me that much we can get tannhil rustled and there linebackers still aren't great some we may be able to accomplish some decent drives.   The Cowboys will be a fun game to watch our elite defense versus one of the best offenses in the game with each team being meh on the other side of the ball.
buffalobills,3dx8jd,Tittycommander420,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:21 2015 UTC,I'm not really impressed with Tannehill - maybe because he's 2-4 against the Bills and looked mostly like complete horse crap against them.

buffalobills,3dukeb,danceKevindance2,3,Mon Jul 20 13:26:53 2015 UTC,"And there doesn't need to be a rush. Eventually there will be a new Bills stadium - it's just the way the NFL works these days. I'm not exactly a fan of it, but it is what it is.  I do trust the Pegulas to do it right though. They don't strike me as the types to just needlessly rush into a process like this; they're going to do their due diligence on it."
buffalobills,3dukeb,Eudaimonics,3,Sun Jul 19 18:53:27 2015 UTC,"It is likely that the stadium will be built somewhere near downtown.  That being said, a project of this size would hopefully include some major improvements to downtown's infrastructure.   It might include a metrorail expansion or burrowing the 190 underground. Both of which are huge projects in themselves.  Another thing is that I think everyone is expecting Pegula to foot the majority of the bill or the construction. Not a bad thing. Pegula seems to be making money head over tails with the Harbor Center.  Downtown Stadium + Convention Center means more concerts, tournaments and more events.  The current problem with the Ralph is that its so isolated. There aren't even any actual hotels within 2 miles of the stadium.  There is also the rumor that Delaware North might contribute - and they better if they expect to win the contract for concessions.  But for now with $130 million in improvements, I think we are fine."

He was there for all the best times in Buffalo's franchise. He was the first announcer, and remains the longest tenured.   My favorite Van Miller story goes to the early 2000s when Murphy had taken over play-by-play but Uncle Van was still doing color. The interchange went something like this:   Murphy: We're going to kick it out to Van Miller with out of town scores. What do you have for us, Van?  Miller: Well, the Jets and Broncos are scoreless right now...  Murphy: Yep Van, that's a 4 o'clock start, sure to be a good one.    My dad often put on the radio over the TV broadcast just to listen to Van Miller, so I feel like I grew up listening to him call games. He will be sorely missed."

We have him tied up for 5 years whereas Watkins is on his rookie contract and Dareus needs to be resigned once his is up. Not to mention McCoy will probably be getting more work than Watkins. Darby might not even be a starter
buffalobills,3drzjo,4and1punt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:37:13 2015 UTC,I disagree with this. Dareus might be gone next year but there is a good chance that McCoy doesn't play out his whole contract with the team and where Watkins almost certainly will.

It was in the heat of the FSU thing which has resolved to a civil brawl but no one I think ever questioned Williams' athletic talent.   6'1"", 4.48, 230 - these are almost video game stats, and I remember seeing an efficiency thingmajum about karlos in the redzone. This website compiled all the most efficient running backs in the red zone by all these characteristics, and the list was pretty interesting. Headed by gurley and Gordon at 2 and 3, Williams was so good that the guys at the website kinda threw it out, nevermind that karlos had so many rz carries, even after cook emerged.   The bills had an awful rz last year so what do we get,  bruising running back with great hands to put it in the end zone? Whaley is a shrewd guy and this has him all written over it."

If Karlos can come in for a few key runs a game and completely change the pace of the running game hes making an impact. He's a young version of Fred in my opinion. We are very crowded in the backfield but the talent that we have works for the amount we will run. If he makes one play that contributes to a W hes making an impact.

Our best receiver was a 7th round pick, the rest were mostly undrafted guys. Our leading back was some guy out of Coe College. And yet, with basicly 0 offensive talent on paper, he helped put us in the top half of the league. If you have a stapler, a can of beans and two rubber bands he will find a way to squeeze more offensive success out of them than is reasonable.   Essentially, he could turn the jets from a terrible offense, to a middling offense, and frankly that might be all they need to succeed this year."

buffalobills,3dfb5x,drewdistilled,8,Wed Jul 15 23:37:53 2015 UTC,Marrone was hot in 2013. He had offers from multiple teams.  Remember we had to give extra to keep him from going to cleveland. He wasn't a bad candidate. He just turned out to be a bad coach. It doesn't matter who hired him because at the time he was sought after and that made the hire look more attractive.

buffalobills,3dfb5x,meatsbeat,-5,Thu Jul 16 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"This article is stupid.   The author never even takes into account the why of it, which is/was the run game.  When you have a defense that great and a QB that raw, you want to run the ball.  CJ Spiller through those first 3 games mentioned had one great game (week 2) and two awful ones.   The only thing I learned was that after 3 weeks, the CJ Spiller experiment was over and that the entire offense was back to the drawing board.  In week 3, Spiller was abysmal. Fred picked it up alright. That game, that loss was crucial because it taught the lesson that they need to run the ball better. I guarantee you that's why he changed gears. I remember these games. Vividly.  In the following two starts, Manuel threw the ball 22 and 20 times. Fred ran 16 and 17 times, which was his highest number of attempts so far that season. Spiller rebounded in week 4 with a huge game. He ran 23 times and the Bills ran 55 total times. It was epic. That's how you knock off a champion!  Then the next week Spiller does as Spiller does: he disappears. And the Bills fell on the road to a weak Browns team.   When you're faced with an inconsistent rookie QB and inconsistent run game, this will happen. At least with a Kyle Orton at the switches, he has the ability to go to the pass if the run isn't there. Or, as this author failed to point out, he can go to typical NFL balance which allowed Marrone to keep teams guessing on run vs pass.  See, when you do the exact ratio of plays that the league average is, you make it hard to predict or guess what is going to happen. If you're a running team, defenses will guess run. If you're a passing team, they will guess pass. But if you're following the 45% play selection on 1st down like the league average, all they can do is play the most basic of percentages against you.  Look - Marrone might be a lot of things, but wrong about this was not one of them. And like the author said: he didn't fail to draft QBs post-EJ.   I just don't care for ""analysis"" articles that are heavy on stats and light on context. This is like PFF to me. Does anyone actually watch games or remember history anymore? Or do they just curl up at night in their mom's basement with their Sabremetrics handbook and furiously masturbate to it until they fall asleep?  Where do these people come from?  WATCH THE GAMES."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,smacksaw,5,Thu Jul 16 07:01:52 2015 UTC,"See, we were supposed to be a running team which gave EJ an advantage on first down because the offense will expect the run so do some play action and the success rate is higher. Our run game was shitty both years and that didn't really help ej. Our defense in 2013 wasn't as good as in 2014 and ej didn't have Sammy. Stevie is a good receiver but very hard for a rookie to come in and throw to a guy who didn't run normal routes. My problem wasn't that we ran the ball, its that we ran it predictably."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,BadMeetsEvil147,5,Thu Jul 16 08:57:12 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree a bit. In 2013 we had some success running, but once things became predictable, we had a tougher go of it (later in 2013, and all of 2014). Unless you have superior offensive line talent (we do not), no team can be successful in the long term by running the ball 70+% of the time on first down. If they can key in on your plays, you're in for a bad day, period."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,jasonhaven,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:59:14 2015 UTC,"Marrone is an ass but I'm sorry, let's not act like EJ has sucked so far because of Marrone. Did Marrone make EJ miss wide open passes? Did he make him have absolutely no pocket awareness? Did he make him not be able to throw a deep ball? No, EJ has been a poor quarterback since he's come into the league and while Marrone may have inhibited his growth he certainly hasn't ruined him. Switching to Kyle Orton was 100% the right decision and if we could have run the football with any consistency we would have made the playoffs because of the QB switch.   Edit: Looks like I should have waited to post this until he inevitably plays like a shit and gets benched for Tyrod or Cassell. I clearly interrupted an EJ pity party."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,McBride055,3,Thu Jul 16 12:52:16 2015 UTC,"People are set in their ways about how EJ actually performed -- it's just a bunch of blanket statements that aren't really backed up by specifics. Can't throw a deep ball? What about the multiple TDs thrown deep?  He didn't miss as many wide open passes as you remember. He made mistakes, sure—any normal rookie would—but much of his poor play can be attributed to growing pains or bad execution from the entire offense. I found these videos really helpful at looking at EJ's 2014 games objectively."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,knuxo,0,Thu Jul 16 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try and find a link but at one point EJ had the poorest deep ball accuracy in the league, I can't recall if that was his rookie season or last year though.   He's always struggled with his accuracy and he struggles with ball placement on simple routes like slants and outs, he frequently has throws behind or low on easy timing passes. I think is actually a huge problem because with the play makers we have now getting the ball in their hands in stride could be the difference of a huge play or a short gain.   I was very negative of EJ in my opening post but I actually do want him to succeed and I like him as a person but I've not seen anything from him that makes me believe that he has it in him to be even an average NFL quarterback. I'd say Kyle Orton won us two more games than EJ would have, possibly more. I'm just tired of people not giving EJ any blame and using Marrone and Hackett as a scapegoat for his poor play. Can they have something to do with it? Yes, absolutely but there are things he has done on the field that are his own doing and have nothing to do with anything that a head coach or offensive coordinator."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,McBride055,2,Thu Jul 16 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"Watch those videos. I'm curious if it affects your opinion. A lot of those timing issues don't seem to fall squarely on EJ.  As for the deep-ball point: in 2013 (as of Dec 7) he was 33/39 in deep passing accuracy, but that was still ahead of Joe Flacco and Cam Newton. Are they unable to throw a deep ball? Or have they just been given a fair shot?"
buffalobills,3dfb5x,knuxo,0,Thu Jul 16 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"I'll try and give those videos a watch tonight. Here's pro football's stats for his rookie season(haven't gotten his 2014 yet): 2013 stats. He finished with the 9th worst accuracy with 68.4% and he finished 10th worst in deep ball accuracy with 34.1%. In your link he has better deep passing percent than Cam and Flacco but he was 9/36 not 33/39 and was in the bottom ten in the league, look again."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,McBride055,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:44:23 2015 UTC,"33rd ranked, I mean. I know it's not impressive but he was a rookie, for gods sake."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,knuxo,0,Thu Jul 16 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"That's fair and I'm not saying I'm expecting but that combined with just watching him throw the ball deep make me have the opinion that he is pretty poor. He has the arm but he just can't throw deep accurately. Geno Smith was in the top 10 for deep ball accuracy so I don't really know if it's a rookie thing. I will watch those videos though, I'm genuinely trying to have a discussion and not just keep taking the same side."
buffalobills,3dfb5x,McBride055,2,Thu Jul 16 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"It's more that this is a discussion about Marrone. Like it or not, he absolutely failed to put EJ in a position to succeed, so it's hard to gauge how good he could be.  And this part is only my opinion, I love to talk Bills, but I don't think switching to Orton was the right move, just like I don't think starting Cassel would be the right move. After a decade of watching them suck, there was no point using them to sneak in to the playoffs and get killed. I know, I know, it's been so long and any given sunday, but they have absolutely no potential to lead the team to anything really meaningful. We'd be better off going boom or bust with anyone else. Not quite Sabres level tanking, but going 8-8 every year isn't how you get to the elite level in the NFL."

Preston Brown is another option - he's looking like he'll be around for a while yet. On the other side of the ball, Sammy is a safe bet but I'd prefer an FJ jersey any day. Fred's an icon."

buffalobills,3daczc,waynewideopenTD,8,Tue Jul 14 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"I'll throw my opinion down on our position groups real quick.  QB - Hold.  I'm looking forward to seeing if EJ can finally move towards his potential.  But worst case, we didn't really get any worse at this spot.  RB - Buy.  Adding LeSean McCoy obviously improves this position group.  Interested to see if Karlos Williams can make any sort of impact in the next few years.  Jerome Felton is also a largely underrated signing by the Bills this offseason, gonna mention it in this position group because he's going to directly impact their effectiveness.  WR - Buy.  Sammy is now in his sophomore year and showed no reason to believe he won't continue to improve.  Dude's gonna be a stud, and really he already is.  Robert Woods is going to break out as soon as we get consistent QB play.  Adding Percy Harvin only helps our cause here.  Getting Goodwin back healthy helps too, but I'm really starting to wonder if he'll ever see a full season.  I'm also pulling for the rookie Dezmon Lewis to make the roster, and for Chris Hogan to secure a spot and future here.  OL - Buy.  Hard not to improve on some of the play we got last year.  Better coaching, added more talent, should equate to better play.  We'll see though!  DL - Hold.  They'd be hard pressed to improve upon one of the top 2-3 units in the league.  Added some veteran depth here though.  Should continue to dominate on a weekly basis.  LB - Sell.  Forced to say ""sell"" here due to the departure of Spikes and Kiko, but I don't believe the unit will miss too much of a step.  Losing Kiko will have zero impact on this group, didn't have him last year and they didn't miss a beat.  Little concerned about Spikes leaving because of his emotional play and ability to stuff the run, but realistically he was only on the field for ~47% of the plays (few steps above a backup) last year.  I see no reason that his production can't be replicated.  This group's performance will 100% depend on Bradham and Brown furthering their development.  CB - Hold.  One of the top groups in the NFL last year, largely keeping the same pieces and adding talent with Darby.  S - Hold.  Aaron Williams is one of my favorite players to watch on Sundays.  His switch from CB to safety was the perfect fit for him.  Graham possibly transitioning to safety kinda concerns me, but he played well enough in the secondary last year to not question that dude's game haha.  Special Teams - Hold.  Consistently one of the better units in the NFL and they don't seem to be losing any pieces.  Plus they have Genny Jesus on the squad who should continue to bestow his blessings and hangovers to his followers.  EDIT:  Forgot the TE spot.  I'm buying them.  Charles Clay is a clear improvement over Chandler in terms of athleticism and talent.  Chandler has done nothing but be a solid contributor in Buffalo for the most part, but it'd be foolish to deny the improvement there.  MarQueis Gray is gonna turn some heads this year I think, and Nick O'Leary should push for playing time eventually as well, possibly forcing Gragg off the roster.  Improvements across the board."
buffalobills,3daczc,scottpilgrimreaper,3,Tue Jul 14 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"Neat idea.  I'll throw a few out to get started, hopefully can add to it later when I'm not at work:  Defense  Defensive Line - Buy  The D-line stayed intact after showing great chemistry the last couple years. With the Hughes signing, the line is in danger of being a little overpriced (I think they overpaid for Hughes), but there's no arguing with the effectiveness. Despite another DC change, the group seems immune to such movement and continues to produce. They maintained and actually added to the depth on the line, re-signing Wynn and picking up an old teammate in Carrington.   Linebacker - Sell  I like our linebacker group. This isn't a strong sell by any means, but Alonso is gone, Spikes is gone, Rivers is gone. Rivers was never great with Buffalo, but Alonso had versatility and Spikes was a good situational player. The group we have is good, but I'm not sure there's a way to slice it where we're not downgrading it this year. The upside is that Nigel Bradham is only in his 4th year and Preston Brown is entering his second year, and both were strong players last season so it's entirely possible that their growth will fill the gaps.  Secondary - Buy  Da'Norris Searcy left, which will hurt, but the Titans paid too much. The depth at safety should help shore up that departure, as Aaron Williams is very good and only 25, and Graham will convert to safety as an excellent and massively underrated corner last year. Duke Williams has had mixed performances but shows some real talent (though questionable taste in women). Rambo had his eye-catching game against the Packers last year, but basically did nothing else so we'll see if he's a ""project"" or not. With a name like that, I can only cheer for great things - how can you not want to say ""gosh, Rambo sure laid waste to that team."" Gilmore often shows flashes of being a true lock-down corner, so if he can be consistent, the addition of Darby out of the draft could be exciting. I think the secondary will be even better than their excellent performance last season."

""On Saturday night deputies with the Walton County Sheriff’s Office responded to a residence on Winston lane at Inlet Beach in Walton County, Fla in reference to a battery. When they arrived deputies spoke to the caller and learned three boys had been fishing on the beach when the suspect, later identified as Buffalo Bills Offensive Line Coach Aaron Kromer, and the suspect’s son confronted them over the use of beach chairs left by a beach access. Victim’s told deputies Kromer grabbed their fishing pole and threw the pole into the water and then pushed one of the boys to the ground and punched him in the face. It was stated Kromer then told the boys to return the chairs to where they found them. The victim stated Kromer also told him if he reported him to the police he would kill his family. Kromer was subsequently arrested early Sunday morning on a misdemeanor battery charge and transported and booked into the Walton County Jail. He has since been released on bond. WCSO is continuing to investigate and additional charges may be filed. WCSO executive staff will be reviewing this case first thing Monday morning when the redacted arrest report will be made available. Thank you for your cooperation and patience."""

The triplets kid's parents later asked the kid what happened to his face and they made up the fishing rod story.   The parents realized the guy was an NFL coach and saw a chance for a quick settlement payday so they called the cops. Three college payments at once is a lot to ask.   They called their cousin, a cop, he saw the facial injury and the corroborating story from his nephews and they went to arrest the man.

The report indicates that Kromer was attempting to recover stolen property (i.e. the beach chairs) and could not see who he was attacking in the dark. No mention of his alleged verbal threat to said party is made, however.  A source told FOXSports.com's NFL insider Alex Marvez that the incident stemmed from Kromer responding to the theft of his beach chairs.  ""It was dark out.

buffalobills,3cu1py,alochanddropit,5,Fri Jul 10 19:48:00 2015 UTC,I would probably go to ESPN or one of the big outlets if I want real solid expert analysis.... I would probably watch your show if you're funny and relateable.
buffalobills,3cu1py,JoePesciOfGoneFishin,3,Fri Jul 10 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say that if you're going to make one that a pre and post-game video would be pretty cool.  If the analysis is thoughtful, and whoever is in the video speaks well enough with a firm grasp of what he/she is talking about, it'd be worth checking out.  Especially since the coverage of the Bills is spotty on a national level.  Be nice to have a place to turn for immediate reflection and reactions after the game (besides here of course!).  Basically doing your own recap of the games and predictions, along with some player highlights (not just of scoring plays, but more in-depth of positive or negatives from that given week)/stat graphics, would be enough for me to at least check it out.  I'm not sure of the legality behind using game footage and such though.  Good luck with it all if you decide to go through with it!"

Where you get to watch film on specific players or something?  I seem to vaguely recall something to that extent, but I might be misremembering.  NFL Rewind would likely work just fine for your purposes too though.  Sampling the clips shouldn't be too difficult of a process to figure out as long as your pc/laptop isn't a POS like mine haha."
buffalobills,3cu1py,PJHFortyTwo,2,Fri Jul 10 21:11:20 2015 UTC,"Do highlights and analyses of not so well known players. People will cover Watkins, Harvin and McCoy, but die hard fans would love a Fred Jackson, Chris Hogan or a Robert Woods video. Also, be funny. Not in an embarassing kind of way, like the guy who does Eagles videos (You know who I'm talking about), but in a silly kind of way."
buffalobills,3cu1py,Socceuro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:10:54 2015 UTC,Chris Hogan or a Robert Woods     Seconded. Also you've got to keep in mind that you need to be bringing something to the table that fans can't already get from other sources. I think being relateable and funny is a good start.

Bruschi also wasn't doing anything so they started making up statistics to show him having an effect on plays. (It was something like 'impacts' for being around a tackle I forget the exact name.)
buffalobills,3co0g0,TurnTwo,3,Thu Jul 9 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"First play of the game was an end-around to Roscoe Parrish. Bruschi met him in the backfield and just flat out missed the tackle.

Also, I don't see how anyone can say, with any degree of intellectual honesty, that McCown isn't the worst starting QB in the NFL."
buffalobills,3ckcmn,SeanJuan,3,Wed Jul 8 16:25:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Its really tough to compare the bottom of the barrel here. McCown had an amazing half season with the Bears before being shipped off to the worst team in the NFL. Imagine putting EJ on the Bucs and you'll see the same results. I don't think winning percentage is a good indication here, you have teams like the Bills who have an above average team except QB, and then we're also talking about teams like the Bucs & Raiders who have been abysmal. I think completion percentage & yards are most important.. EJ has a decent comp % but not many yards which is a bad sign, it means he's been dumping the ball off. Maybe Marrone & Hackett were the problem here... we will see."
buffalobills,3ckcmn,mikeytd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:20:54 2015 UTC,With all due respect most people who said they were ready for a 16 game EJ season last year were singing a different tune after the Texans game.

buffalobills,3ckcmn,Dissaid,6,Wed Jul 8 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"When was the last time we gave a QB the supporting cast that he needed to be successful? I'd argue that it was back in 2008 with Trent Edwards, when the OL was at least average and there were reasonably legitimate weapons on the field in Lynch, Evans, Freddie, and Stevie. We were off to a 4-0 start until Trent got a concussion and Jauron seemingly cut the offensive playbook to about three plays.  Quarterbacks don't play in a vacuum. There aren't many who can win games for you without quality playmakers around them."

buffalobills,3ckcmn,Dirtydeedsinc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:41:17 2015 UTC,Yea. You're much more comfortable with a talking head making stuff up about us having the worst QB situation in the NFL. Got it.

buffalobills,3ckcmn,binaryvisions,6,Wed Jul 8 17:00:46 2015 UTC,McCown's performance in the game against Atlanta on Thursday night definitely sealed it as the worst QB in the league for me

buffalobills,3cjvpz,errorsniper,65,Wed Jul 8 14:06:26 2015 UTC,In this case because we aren't losing a home game.
buffalobills,3cjvpz,51213,24,Wed Jul 8 14:14:51 2015 UTC,So the Toronto game was always a home game?

buffalobills,3cjvpz,Crymaximus,19,Wed Jul 8 14:21:35 2015 UTC,It didn't help that the Toronto games FELT like road games as well.
buffalobills,3cjvpz,bullseyetm,35,Wed Jul 8 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"The problem was that many of us saw the Toronto series as a precursor to the Bills relocation, as if the team was just testing the waters before diving in.  So, we were understandably put off by the idea.    We also hated how regular the Toronto games were, one home game each year.  We felt like we were giving up a lot by taking a one of our only eight games away from the Ralph, all for the benefit of a Toronto fan base that didn't even care about the Bills.  As for London, I don't think anyone believes that the Bills are at risk of moving there.  It's also only a one time shot, and an away game.  However, I would certainly understand if Jaguar fans hated the London series for all the same reasons we hated the Toronto series."
buffalobills,3cjvpz,jaso4657,3,Wed Jul 8 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"The problem was that many of us saw the Toronto series as a precursor to the Bills relocation, as if the team was just testing the waters before diving in. So, we were understandably put off by the idea.   This was all but confirmed when Rogers Communications, who were footing the bill for the Toronto Series, became partners with Bon Jovi when the team was up for sale.  The goal of the Toronto Series for them was to build a fanbase for their inevitable purchase and move.  Thank GOD it was a spectacular failure."
buffalobills,3cjvpz,Percinho,2,Thu Jul 9 12:17:05 2015 UTC,"This article does a decent job describing why the Jags fans are coming around to it. The TL;DR is basically that the Jags make enough money to stabilize the team so they aren't as close to having to move plus it allows them to keep stateside ticket prices lower. Also the London fans are becoming huge Jax fans and actually make some noise/cheer/care about the team, unlike a certain city to the north."
buffalobills,3cjvpz,Mr_Frieze,3,Wed Jul 8 20:06:20 2015 UTC,I always found it funny that the nfl tries to get the uk in to football. The primetime games start at like 11 pm or midnight to them.
buffalobills,3cjvpz,MyShadows,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:21:52 2015 UTC,"Bit late to this, but as a UK NFL fan for 20ish years I can provide some context.   Whilst the Prime Time games aren't ideal for us, the two early Sunday games are perfect. 6pm until midnight or so, and moreover they are rarely up against any UK sporting events. Additionally the Thanksgiving games start at 5pm, just as people finish work.   It's also worth bearing in mind that there has been an historical fan base since NFL was shown on network TV from the mid-80s. When I was 10 years old we'd play American football at playtime in school (or should I say during recess?). The NFL aren't so much trying to push the game on us, it's just servicing an existing audience, and one that's growing."

buffalobills,3cjvpz,PeteTodd,8,Wed Jul 8 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"Not officially.  But, they are in a position similar to ours during the Toronto series days, in that they lose at least one home game each year to the London series.  The NFL's UK movement advertises the Jaguars as London's team.    Much like our situation before last season, there has been no outward showing that the Jaguars are going to move.  But the NFL has made clear that it might want a team in London, and the Jaguars seem to be being put in a position to be that team, if one were to move."
buffalobills,3cjvpz,SeanJuan,3,Wed Jul 8 14:27:32 2015 UTC,thanks!
buffalobills,3cjvpz,champ1315,3,Wed Jul 8 14:35:49 2015 UTC,"I'd also add the Toronto series was guaranteed every year for quite a few years,and each a home game. The London games are always different teams each year (I believe) and are always always games."

buffalobills,3cmnwp,SabresFan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:22:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I was wondering if there was something definitive out there. My guess is that since the secondary markets have to air all of a team's games based on NFL rules, they will be allowed to air this game on TV as well. But, I have also seen the NFL do weird things, so I wouldn't guarantee it until it's on my TV."
buffalobills,3cmnwp,LtPowers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:41:16 2015 UTC,I could have sworn I read that the secondary markets are good to go -- basically any market that would normally be guaranteed a Bills or Jags away game gets to see it on TV.

buffalobills,3cgxvc,oohbopbadoo,11,Tue Jul 7 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"If they can get a him for a 4th this makes sense. But a 3rd is too much.   He has really long arms but he needs to build muscle if he's 312 and only benching 12 reps. The ""cramp in arm"" situation is unacceptable. That means his body wasn't prepared for the workout and who knows if it'll be prepared for training camp or the season.   Also the simple fact that the Bills sent their OLine coach doesn't necessarily mean they're very interested in this guy. That just means the coach was free at that time - and keep in mind this is in the middle of basically the longest vacation in the NFL year. If coaches want to go on trips, this is the only time they can really do so with family. I agree that it does mean they're potentially interested but it doesn't mean that other teams are any less interested.   He also is pretty unlikely to start right away on this roster. Glenn/Kouandjio/Henderson are all much better with more experience. Why this does make sense to focus on getting this guy is because Glenn is in his contract year - secure some young talent to mediate mitigate that potential loss.   But only for a 4th."

buffalobills,3cgxvc,GlucoseGlucose,2,Wed Jul 8 12:35:56 2015 UTC,I think the title is misleading OP. Brandt just states we sent our OL coach. I don't think it indicates level of investment at all. 25 of 32 teams sent someone...  That being said I'd use a 4th or 5th on him. That's it though.

buffalobills,3ch5ce,SgtBikeitis,8,Tue Jul 7 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"I purchase from Lids, Dicks, NFLShop, Buffalo Bills Shop, or other legitimate retailers. I generally wait for them to be on sale, but occasionally buy jerseys that are still expensive, when the time is right.  For almost everybody, the entry-level ""Game"" jersey that's least expensive is the best bet. If you're really super concerned about looking good, you can get an Elite (which is actually a gameday replica, basically), but it's going to cost you. The best time of year to buy is usually around Christmas. I got an authentic Marcell Dareus from the Bills Shop in December 2012 for $40. I got an authentic Kyle Williams from Lids in December 2014 for $35. Basically, because the end of football season (and corresponding reduced demand) coincides with the holidays, that's when you get some epic deals. But you have to be willing to take what you get.  In the past I have always bought up-and-coming players, and I really regret it (my #21 C.J. Spiller jersey was an awful waste). I will not be doing it anymore, except on major sales. From now on, if I buy an expensive jersey, I'll be buying team legends and ""elder statesmen"" like Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, Andre Reed, Kyle Williams, Fred Jackson, etc. The type of guys who will be remembered when they leave the team."

I will be making my first jersey purchase from NFL Shop since 2009 in the next few weeks.   I'm kinda stressed on who to get. I want to go Clay but I'm thinking maybe play it safe and get 95 Williams.   The only other piece of advice is that you don't have to pick a player. You can get a customized jersey with any name on it i.e.# 23 - Beast Mode (which I still have). Caveat being you can never get your own name.   Decisions . . . Decisions"

If you are trying to argue that some players are more ""important"" than others you can do that, but literally, special teams is 1/3 of the game, and any player on a team would be 1/53 of that team. Do you consider the QB to be like 7/53 of the team? RB is 5/53? and so on?  If you really break it down by points scored, the defense scores points on the fewest percentage of their plays compared to offence and special teams, so do they matter less?

As soon as he came to Buffalo and was slotted in as our TE2, he put up 8 catches for 118 yards over 5 games. Extend that production over 16 games, and it's 25.6 catches for 377.6 yards, good for TE24.    Even behind Chandler and in our anemic 2014 offense, he was still in the back-end TE1 range, and we're still only asking him to be our TE2 behind Clay.  With how much Roman uses TEs, he may actually be a pretty big difference maker this year."

When Cleveland comes to town you can get nose bleeds for $50-$60.  I went to the game the last time the Giants came to the Ralph.  I don't recall those tickets being pricey.  Most Giants fans seem to be down on the team this year so I wouldn't be surprised if the 2nd hand ticket's are cheaper.  I'm looking to round up a group to go to this game as well.  So I will be keeping an eye on prices.

When I watch Beast Mode rip off on a gnarly run, I occasionally think ""Wow, imagine if he was still here"". But I don't dwell on those feelings.   Especially when we have the talent we have on our team as of right now. Just within the backfield alone, there's too many talented guys for me to lose much, if any, sleep on not having Marshawn on our team anymore. So much so that we'll probably saying the same sort of thing about Bryce Brown in a few years, forgetting that we're wealthy at RB this year. (Not that he's necessarily going to become a top-5 NFL RB, just that he'll probably do well for himself).  I could understand the feeling more if we were a team that would probably go 4-12 and have an empty of cupboard of NFL-capable talent, but our offense has playmakers all over the place, the entire defense is stacked, crazy good special teamers, and the coaching staff seems to be exceptional - at least above average (and an improvement from was here just one year ago).

This is from an article at syracuse.com about players on the rise after mini camp: ""Speaking of the competition at linebacker, another name April brought up was A.J. Tarpley, an undrafted rookie out of Stanford. While sixth-round pick Tony Steward has been injured, Tarpley has been getting more reps and seems to be impressing his coaches with them.

Pass heavy teams, especially the dink/dunk sort, are well deflated (hehe) by quick pressure and being sacked on a late down or multiple times in a down set.

buffalobills,3buaij,JoesShittyOs,16,Thu Jul 2 07:37:26 2015 UTC,It could also mean our offense IS doing it's job. The more points we score the more teams will have to rely on 5 and 7 step drops to try and compete.

This offense, one focussed on running game, has the added benefit of being able to burn clock time. If they're not constantly going three and out, and forcing opposing teams into bad time crunch situations, our defense shouldn't be on the field nearly as much. Hence, less sacks.   Or hey, we could have an amazing offense and they'll still break the sacking record again, which means we have the scariest defense of all time."

buffalobills,3bwnb8,Nomad86x,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:14:24 2015 UTC,"McCoy will have way more volume than Spiller. More touches = more chances to break a long play. Spiller is not the lead back in NO. Spiller is more of a highly variable RB2, where as McCoy is a lower-ceiling RB1. He won't have a lot of 30+ weeks, but he won't have a lot of <10 weeks either."
buffalobills,3bwnb8,Isaystomabel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"But McCoy has benefited from great OL play and CJ will have someone who knows how to use him properly.

We will be better in every facet of our offensive game this year. We upgraded our OLine, upgraded the RB, upgraded the WRs, upgraded the TE, upgraded the FB, and finally the coaching will be better. Put this all together, and you'll find a competent offense that runs the ball ALOT!! Shady will be an ok fantasy pick this year. Freddy is getting older, we don't have excellent depth behind Shady. The defense won't be on the field for long which leaves plenty of time for the Bills offense to run the ball until Shady pukes."
buffalobills,3bwnb8,mikeytd,-7,Thu Jul 2 19:46:57 2015 UTC,dolphins fan here. Love clay but you didn't upgrade at TE he is a utility player who lines up at TE more than anything else.

buffalobills,3bwnb8,Paulus81,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:35:55 2015 UTC,"You've got to be joking right? You think Scott chandler is better than clay? Chandler is severely lacking any athletic ability he can't get separation on any defender in the league. The only time he got open was either when the defense forgot about him, or he ran 5 yds and turned around. Clay is exactly what this offense needed as a flex TE, especially with Romans creativity. I understand he was hurt some of the time in Miami, but he'll be fine.... And you're the only person on the face of the planet that thinks chandler is a better player."
buffalobills,3bwnb8,mikeytd,-4,Fri Jul 3 12:52:36 2015 UTC,he's just not an upgrade at TE. Clay struggles at things that traditional TEs are expected to do like run block. He's gotten a lot better at those things with experience but he will always be 6'2 240 pounds. He is a great offensive weapon and i'm sad we couldn't retain him but you will see what I'm saying about him as a tight end specifically. At no point did i suggest chandler is a better player. He is not a clear upgrade at TE is my point.
buffalobills,3bwnb8,Arlennn,3,Fri Jul 3 13:06:51 2015 UTC,"Chandler could not block to save his life. He could catch, but we called him stone hands for a reason. So if Clay can make clutch receptions regularly and isn't a turnstile, he is an upgrade over Chandler. Did you watch Bills games other than the two times we play the Dolphins a year? Trust someone who has watched a lot of them, we loved Chandler, but he wasn't that good."

Huge EJ/fsu fan so i got a little disinterested but I'm confident that they are in the same ballpark production wise strictly looking at them as tight ends. Clay dropped a lot of touchdowns last year but it was uncharacteristic and i expect him to bounce back.
buffalobills,3bwnb8,Arlennn,2,Fri Jul 3 15:25:40 2015 UTC,I think you are seriously overestimating Chandler.

buffalobills,3bwnb8,Paulus81,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:36:57 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Greg Roman will know to ease the pressure of the QB by having shady participate in the passing game. He knows what type of player he is and unlike Marrone and hackett I doubt Rex and Roman will not let him participate in a vital part of his offensive skill set
buffalobills,3bwnb8,taterdstruct,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"Draft him high, in the last 5 years he has rushed for more yards then any other rb and has been in the top for rushing attempts. Keep in mind he has already had a new coach and offensive scheme, so he can handle change. The Bills have a new coach in Rex Ryan and a new offensive coordinator, Greg Roman, both of favor rushing and with out a superstar QB you can be sure they will run a lot. As for Freddy and company, they are not the feature backs but will cut in to Shady's time. However, most of the rushes will go to Shady and he is a playmaker. He may not be as good as last year but he has consistency, something which each of his backups lack."
buffalobills,3bwnb8,Fgrira-Fpevoare,0,Thu Jul 2 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"See, thats the problem though. He may not be as good as last year, and last year he was the 12th best RB in fantasy. At least last year, Nick Foles or Mark Sanchez could move the ball downfield in the passing game. I don't have any confidence in Manuel, Taylor, or Cassel. Even if he is just as good as last year, I don't think you should draft him as high as he's going in fantasy drafts."
buffalobills,3bwnb8,DFS_GordonBombay,0,Fri Jul 3 20:45:14 2015 UTC,So where would you take him?
buffalobills,3bwnb8,alochanddropit,0,Thu Jul 2 20:02:19 2015 UTC,Probably mid 2nd round if he's still available.

Those two are way bigger gambles than taking a dude that has proven himself as a top tier RB for the past like.. 5 years.  Also gotta think that Gore is a little lower than Shady too.  Though I can see your argument with him a bit more than the other two.

buffalobills,3bodx1,Nomad86x,2,Tue Jun 30 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"He looked good in the Chiefs game too. His problem is the fumbles. If he'd reign it in hed be a totally competent number one back on a few teams. But he still hasn't fixed it, and it's lost us a winnable game that would have put us in the playoffs.   Anytime you put him in, you're putting a huge risk that you're going to lose the ball, bigger than other RBs in the league. Holding onto the ball is something a RB should be able to do better than any other position in the league.

buffalobills,3bf718,irieCO,7,Mon Jun 29 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"This list is ridiculous. I think they judged it within fanbase, rather than from an outsider's perspective. The 'boys, Pats, and Hawks shouldn't he that high. Pittsburgh probably shouldn't either."
buffalobills,3bf718,YepImanEmokid,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"On what grounds shouldn't Pittsburgh be that high? The fan experience (particularly away game turnout) is second to none and the uniforms are classic. Management is classy to the end.  Frankly, I was surprised the Patriots* were that low. If it was based on their own fans' perspective, they'd be number one."
buffalobills,3bf718,LtPowers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:47:18 2015 UTC,Steelers are a consistently successful team with fans EVERYWHERE. Those are the kinds of teams you see getting a lot of hate. They're similar to the Cowboys or the Patriots in that regard.
buffalobills,3bf718,YepImanEmokid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:52:49 2015 UTC,Except the Steelers aren't nearly as hated. And having fans EVERYWHERE seems like a good criterion on which to raise their ranking.
buffalobills,3bf718,LtPowers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:53:51 2015 UTC,I live in the heart of Steelers country and I can tell you; it's a daily struggle not to punch Steelers fans in the face during football season.
buffalobills,3bf718,Ro-Jack,3,Tue Jun 30 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with #1. If the Bills don't make it too far, I'm always fine with seeing the Packers win. (even though we kicked their ass this year). They're in such a neat town and have a good story."
buffalobills,3bf718,that_joke_explainer,2,Mon Jun 29 03:12:09 2015 UTC,Thank you sweetie!
buffalobills,3bf718,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Packers are the most like-able due to their least hateable status. I moved to Wisconsin and after the Bills Packers game (I watched in a Packers bar) the locals bought me a few beers for not being a jerk. Sure the Cowboys are ""America's team"" but they have a lot of hate.  Bills number one in my heart forever Packers can have a good day too."

buffalobills,3bd4gh,raleighhicks,3,Sun Jun 28 05:47:22 2015 UTC,"From all the response, this sounds like the place to be! I heard they let you tailgate too!"
buffalobills,3bd4gh,TheBimpo,2,Sun Jun 28 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, Bills Backers have been meeting there for years. They allow us to tailgate, get there EARLY if you want to sit in the bar area."
buffalobills,3bd4gh,fazzle1,2,Sun Jun 28 16:11:46 2015 UTC,I'll be moving into the Raleigh area soon as well.  How early is early?
buffalobills,3bd4gh,TheBimpo,2,Mon Jun 29 06:33:33 2015 UTC,"September, 11am or earlier. We're out there tailgating with breakfast, cornhole, chili cook-offs, you name it. Come October 11:30, November 12:30, December...kickoff."

buffalobills,3bb5xv,derfolly,9,Sat Jun 27 15:18:05 2015 UTC,I would love to see more Marquise Goodwin on the field this year.
buffalobills,3bb5xv,MattLovesMath,3,Sat Jun 27 15:35:59 2015 UTC,If it's between him and hogan I'd rather see hogan.
buffalobills,3bb5xv,EvansCantStop,5,Mon Jun 29 16:48:15 2015 UTC,It's been super frustrating watching the Bills handle Goodwin's career.
buffalobills,3bb5xv,pullandpray,4,Sat Jun 27 19:44:04 2015 UTC,Maybe he shouldn't get hurt every play
buffalobills,3bb5xv,derpaderp1,4,Sun Jun 28 15:12:06 2015 UTC,How? He's been injured for most of it. There's nothing they can really do
buffalobills,3bb5xv,MaybachMusic22,6,Sun Jun 28 12:14:53 2015 UTC,For those of you not too familiar with what that actually looks like here is his last olympic qualifying:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK8yiRJkfcU
buffalobills,3bb5xv,aryanoface,3,Sat Jun 27 18:05:41 2015 UTC,How amazing would it be to see this dude jump over a pile at the 5 yard line right into the endzone
buffalobills,3bb5xv,stalktheground,-14,Sun Jun 28 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"Need to cut the guy.  He's not fully focused on fball, can't stay healthy, and isn't really worth keeping a roster spot for.  For me, the quote in the article says it all, ""not trying to gain to much weight on thr football side"" keeping a track football balance etc.  Pick one Goodwin.  You want to go do track, great.  If you want to play football that should be your only focus."
buffalobills,3bb5xv,Buffalo_Spartan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:45:47 2015 UTC,Hogan>Goodwin.  Goodwin will not be with the team long.  Plenty of time for him to work on the long jump
buffalobills,3bb5xv,Buffalo_Spartan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:37:04 2015 UTC,I think Percy is a better replacement than hogan.
buffalobills,3bagfi,DiddyMac,13,Sat Jun 27 09:17:43 2015 UTC,"No problem, but I would get them secured before you come. That's too far to fly to try and buy them in the parking lot if that's what you meant. Definitely get there early on game day. If you hang around the tailgaters sounding British and saying you flew from the UK to see your beloved Bills, you will eat like a king for free. There is no food like Buffalo food. You may even be offered some beers if your mate can keep his filthy, Cowboy-loving mouth shut /s. Enjoy, fellas. Welcome."
buffalobills,3bagfi,relativex,3,Sat Jun 27 13:59:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd ditch your friend as soon as he puts on Cowboys stuff. Outside of the AFC east, I don't know if there is a more hated team for most Bills fans.   If he gets free food, it might come in the form of a projectile."
buffalobills,3bagfi,TheDrunkenWobblies,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:20:15 2015 UTC,Don't reinforce shitty fan behavior.
buffalobills,3bagfi,derpaderp1,2,Sun Jun 28 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"Don't warn him about the truth? I had a friend of a friend show up in a Jets jersey once and he left the stadium covered in blood and piss when 8 drunk guys jumped him in the washroom. Shit happens there, alot."
buffalobills,3bagfi,TheDrunkenWobblies,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:32:35 2015 UTC,And again. Don't reinforce it. Being assholes to someone who likes something different than you is literally the scummiest thing you can do.
buffalobills,3bagfi,derpaderp1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:40:25 2015 UTC,And not telling somebody the truth that they may get fucked up is also a disservice.
buffalobills,3bagfi,TheDrunkenWobblies,10,Sun Jun 28 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"Should be fine. StubHub will have them listed until just before the game. If the Bills are in the playoff race (they will be) it might be expensive. Dress warm. If you need a place to tailgate or drink before the game, PM me closer. My brothers, friends and I just want to tailgate the games. No need to go in for us (unless the price is right)"
buffalobills,3bagfi,biggymurf1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hope this isn't illegal to post this... but check out a mobile app called Gametime. Very similar to stubhub but all mobile based. I have used it a few times to get tickets, both last minute and well before hand. I find it is cheaper than scalpers and usually cheaper than ticket booth unless a high demand game. Hopefully by fall Buffalo is included. Any sport in most cities to this point. Big for mlb and mls. If you sign up, use my code as we both get money off our next tickets..  BRENTNGTON2301"
buffalobills,3bagfi,TheDrunkenWobblies,10,Sun Jun 28 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"Do it! You will have the time of your life. I had a season ticket at Villa for 8 years, and now regularly go to the Ralph.   Absolutely nothing compares to game day at the Ralph. Premier league games do not get close to being as amazing as a Bills gameday experience."
buffalobills,3bagfi,rob1703,5,Sat Jun 27 12:54:10 2015 UTC,"Stubhub is the way to go.  Scalpers on game day are going to be way overpriced.  If you want to play it risky, while you wander the lots on game day and there are usually a few extra tix that a large group has left over because someones buddy dropped out at the last second."
buffalobills,3bagfi,deecoliw,3,Sat Jun 27 11:48:26 2015 UTC,"if you do come put up a post well give you advice on things to do..like going to a Sabres hockey game, niagara falls, skiing or snow tubing, Canada  or where to drink and tailgate before the game"
buffalobills,3bagfi,IR_Bills_Fan,2,Sat Jun 27 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"You may even think about flying into NYC spending a day or to then flying to buffalo, manytimes there are cheap fare for $100-150$ between the two cities"

buffalobills,3bagfi,Buffalo_Spartan,2,Sun Jun 28 00:48:08 2015 UTC,"Do it!!.you should be fine scalping but I would get tix in advance.    On a side note I'm very bitter as I live in jacksonville and out of all the games this year, the bills game WOULD be the London game."

buffalobills,3b8wxt,Petrol_in_my_eyes,4,Sat Jun 27 15:50:24 2015 UTC,But Kerfuffle is going to be awesome.  And they play about 1/8th of the commercials of any other station so I can live with it.
buffalobills,3b8wxt,blu333,2,Sat Jun 27 15:52:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. I just wish they would play something else occasionally

But I remember looking up at him and he was like twice my size, granted I was only 15 years old, he was still ginormous. I didn't get to have much of a conversation with him, I don't think he was too pleased going 3rd instead of 2nd that night lol. Cool story tho man!!!"

buffalobills,3b6o70,wafflesareforever,3,Fri Jun 26 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"It's crazy how big some human beings are. I was into wrestling as a kid during the Hulk Hogan era (not proud of it, let's just move on) and I got to go backstage at an event because my dad worked with Hacksaw Jim Duggan's sister. I met the Hulkster, Hacksaw, and a few others. They were all impossibly huge; their hands were almost comically enormous. Hacksaw picked me up by the front of my shirt and held me up in the air like I weighed nothing. I was around 12 at the time. It's like they're a different species."
buffalobills,3b6o70,wafflesareforever,13,Fri Jun 26 14:25:34 2015 UTC,"Dude, if you're not proud of being into wrestling during its peak then what can you be proud of? That shit was the coolest ever. Awesome that you got to meet him - I would have just gawked like a little girl."

buffalobills,3b6o70,Aushwango,14,Fri Jun 26 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"I have a cool Dareus story.   I went to the first open practice at TC his rookie year. After the practice during the autograph time, he came over by me.   Somebody had on a Dareus jersey and took it off and asked him to sign it. He grabbed it, took a step back, held up and shit you not he teared up.  He said sorry to the fans and signed the jersey. He muttered something to the fan thanking him for buying his jersey. He then told the crowd it was the first time since being drafted that he saw a fan up close in person wearing his jersey.   You could tell that had hit him all of sudden that he was in the NFL. Fans would be wearing his name on their backs. It was a cool expierence."
buffalobills,3b6o70,36in36,10,Fri Jun 26 22:50:37 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I misread you and thought Dareus tore up the jersey! I was extremely upset until I reread it."
buffalobills,3b6o70,smartyr228,6,Sat Jun 27 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"I had to reread it like 5 times, I was wondering if I missed the part where he bought him a new jersey or something"

buffalobills,3b6o70,AryanNinja,7,Sat Jun 27 02:09:10 2015 UTC,Funny story. When Living in Elmwood village a few years back while I was still in Buffalo I went over a friends house after bars close (~5am after a quick Jim's Steakout stop). We go back to her apartment for drinks and when we walk in there is a huge black man in her kitchen with a real thick country twang. It was fucking marcel Dareus right after he was he drafted. I guess he met her roommate earlier that night and came home with her. It was awkward and hilarious. Real humble dude and VERY country (at the time).
buffalobills,3b6o70,CallTur,7,Fri Jun 26 22:57:52 2015 UTC,Marcel and I went on Spring Break together freshman year and every way that you've described him is accurate so I can vouch for you! He's a great guy in all honesty and really down to earth.
buffalobills,3b6o70,nemoomen,3,Fri Jun 26 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I at least ran into Dareus too, at the Buffalo Airport.    It must have been in in mid-January, when I was headed back to school, and Dareus was probably headed home to Alabama :(   , but he rushed through the airport line. I didn't recognize him at the time, just a big black dude with a beard that was cutting in line, but I was gonna say something, but he was hugely bigger than me.   ...your story is better."

Taylor was having trouble making reads with a pass rush of 4 which gives him time to run around and find a break in the coverage. A lot of NFL talent on the field here.  I hope Taylor has improved his ability to make reads. If he has, he could be super dynamic in the NFL. Can you imagine? Taylor really seems like a boom or bust player.   I think TT will ultimately get the 1st crack at the starting job if Cassel falters since the coaching staff has no connection to EJ"

Offensive line, and tackle moreso, is a position that routinely takes a year or more of pro-level training to be proficient. The need to learn advanced techniques in hand use, balance, recognizing offensive tricks, etc. to deal with the extremely large difference in size and speed of the players they are blocking.  Really, no one expected the tackles to be ready last year. And bringing in another rookie is unlikely to improve on two players with a year's experience (and possibly even better skillsets to begin with). Guards are better equipped to step in immediately, of course."

And seantrell had to play against some amazing pass rushers last year. He had JJ Watt, Cameron Wake Twice, Justin Houston, Wilkerson twice. Of course he was gonna look bad"

But until we have definitely solidified the position, why in the world would we stop drafting tackles?  They might pan out, they still might not. I don't think anyone can argue that tackle isn't a position of need, and we didn't address it at all this year.  We attempted to get two, Bulaga and Collins, but didn't close either.  This guy is a moderately successful left tackle from a good football school.  He can also be had cheaper now than i f he was in the full draft."

buffalobills,3b2ctp,Ohuma,14,Thu Jun 25 12:17:26 2015 UTC,"My inclination was to go with C at first, but I wanted to take a more systematic approach and assigned the following numerical grades to each type of game:   Good Game: +2 points Average Game: +1 point Bad Game: -1 point Horrific Game: -2 points   On that basis, the cumulative scores for each QB are:    Rank QB Score    1 C 1   2 B -2   3 D -12   4 A -15    So, on that basis, I think it's easy to rule out A and D, but the 3 point difference between B & C is insignificant enough that B would warrant significant consideration.  Edit: Decided to look at it another way and break the games into ""Average or Better"" versus ""Bad or Worse"", since with our defense, ""Average or Better"" is really all we need on any given Sunday to give us a great chance at a win. On that basis, this is how the QBs rank in terms of the percent of their total games that are ""Average or Better"":    Rank QB Average or Better Bad or Worse    1 C 11 (57.9%) 8 (42.1%)   2 B 8 (57.1%) 6 (42.9%)   3 D 10 (34.5%) 19 (65.5%)   4 A 6 (27.3%) 16 (72.7%)    Again, B and C are neck-and-neck. And A and D are again ruled out completely. You can't have a QB coming out with a Bad or Worse game 3 times out of 4 or 2 times out of 3."

buffalobills,3b2ctp,Hamburger77,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"Breaking them down into these ranges is slightly deceptive. It's worth noting that B (Manuel's) ""average"" games have been better than C (Cassel's) average games. Manuel had 4 games with QBR +60 his rookie year (sadly none last year), while Cassel had 4 games with QBR +60 in the past 3 seasons. Cassel seems to skirt around the bare minimum of average, except for a couple instances where he very barely balls out.  I really don't know how QBR works as a stat, it honestly seems like garbage to me. Cassel's 1TD/4INT disaster against New England netted him 17.2 QBR, while Manuel's 1TD/0INT game against San Diego had 8.4 QBR. What the fuck is the stat supposed to mean? How can it be a reflection of how good a performance is if the numbers are contrary to the performance?  EDIT: Strike that, QB C is not Cassel. My point still stands in that Cassel has more games in the statistically average zone, but those average games are on the lowest end of qualifying."
buffalobills,3b2ctp,pixel_pete,3,Thu Jun 25 15:58:14 2015 UTC,"Isn't obsessively dependant TD/Int ratio the main problem w/ the traditional QB rating?  I haven't looked at QBR that closely and I didn't watch that NE game last year, but I'd want a less hair-splitting example of it being bad.  That Charger game was legit horrific...against a bad defense at home.  Same hopeless feeling as the Steelers/Bucs games the year before.  Like it really felt like you could line up a defense full of training camp cuts and we'd have a sub 1% chance of scoring on a given possession."
buffalobills,3b2ctp,BuffOrange,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying both aren't bad, I'm saying when you turn the ball over four times and barely completely half your passes and your team gets blown out, that might just be a little bit worse. I see where you're coming from with the San Diego game, our offense just couldn't make anything happen.  Like I said though, I'm not really sure what the inner mechanics of QBR are, I know there's some subjectivity that goes into it (like clutchness), and that could be good or bad."
buffalobills,3b2ctp,pixel_pete,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, QBR is supposed to reward players for playing well when the games circumstances call for it. So throwing a td late in the 4th quarter in a close game is weighed more favorably than doing the same in the first quarter. The same for ints, a game blowing pick 6 is worse than one thrown in garbage time.  So for both of those games, you'd have to see the context around the throws, which makes the entire system controversial. Some people just want to weigh every pass, int, and td equally while others may want to say that a 6/2 td int game is way different if you're mounting a massive comeback."

buffalobills,3b2ctp,binaryvisions,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:26:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's break these into percentages:    QB Good Average Bad Horrific    A 13.6% 13.6% 36.4% 36.4%   B 0% 57.1% 14.3% 28.6%   C 5.3% 52.6% 26.3% 15.8%   D 13.8% 20.7% 41.4% 24.1%    A few notes... First, one QB has a lot fewer games here so judging that QB against one with 22/29 games is a little unfair - it is precluding the possibility that a raw quarterback will improve given more games. I'd be interested in seeing this chart truncated for the FIRST 14 games of each player.  That said, this actually stacks up pretty well for EJ, especially with so few games. QBs A & D are hurting their teams here. QB B is going to have some bad games, but statistically is going to keep you in most games. I'm not sure there's enough data to differentiate between B & C here. One good game doesn't mean much.  Ironically, I'd like to see the chart with the first 14 games for all, but I am also going to say: there's not much information here. Less than a season is a TINY amount of data. Less than two seasons is still pretty small."
buffalobills,3b2ctp,Buffalo_Spartan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:40:06 2015 UTC,"QB A (JP Losman) did have a half-season under his belt in 2006. But in that one half-season they didn't keep track of QBR. So theoretically, he isn't has as raw as you would think.  I think the chart with their first 14 games would be interesting, actually. I considered doing that at first, probably should have followed through.  This is ONLY QBR...it doesn't take into account so many factors. For one, EJ has had an excellent defense behind him. His starting field percentage is going to be much better than B's (Mike Glennon) and D's (Trent Edwards).   Also, Losman and Edwards probably had many less offensive weapons than EJ.  Additionally, think about the defense aspect. EJ Manuel could be in a game until the 4th quarter without having a need to make plays, only manage the game. While Losman had no defense and had to come out ""slinging"". That is something else to consider."

His starting field percentage is going to be much better than B's (Mike Glennon) and D's (Trent Edwards).   EJ averaged a starting field position of the 26.71 yard line, good for 25th in the league. Tampa Bay was 23rd the year Glennon started most of the games. Trent Edwards averaged starting at the 32.42 yard line the year he started 14 games, good for 3rd in the league.  Might want to look up the stats before you make that claim.  I'm not sure that we've got a particularly fair representation of how many offensive weapons EJ has. His rookie year, there was no Watkins, there was no Harvin, he had a bunch of rookie wideouts and Stevie. Edwards had Stevie & scrubs at WR as well.  This year, there's a true arsenal of weapons on offense - Watkins has a year under his belt, Woods has some experience, Harvin is tough to judge but is certainly talented, and McCoy is dangerous under all circumstances. Add an actual dynamic TE into the mix and I'd say, at the end of this season - yes, EJ had a lot of weapons to work with. But through his first season? Not so much.  edit: really?

I can't imagine you'd find anyone—even in Atlanta—who would argue that Matt Ryan had a better 2012 season than Aaron Rodgers, but Ryan's QBR was higher.   It baffles me that a guy can have a higher touchdown total and touchdown percentage, a lower interception total and interception percentage, more yards per attempt, more adjusted yards per attempt and more yards per completion yet have a lower total rating in a statistic that is supposed to bring everything together.  The problem is that it's not something that can be disputed. There's no formula to plug numbers into here. We're just trusting ESPN. And that's cool, but the lack of tangibility attached to this stat makes it harder simply to use it as a piece to the grand puzzle that is the evaluation of a quarterback.    I can't think of one off the top of my head, but I know there's got to be a better one than QBR. Also, ""Until you can find one that suits your line of thinking?"" is exactly what you are doing with this post. We've butted heads on this before and every single time you have shown to me that you lack any kind of understanding and an argument that boils down to ""I watch EJ and I don't like him.""  It's fairly obvious that this whole post is a misguided ""wisdom of solomon"" type bullshit attempt to trick people into agreeing with these biased and cherry picked stats that you found. This is not content, this is a waste of everyone's time. Good day."

buffalobills,3b184g,taterdstruct,2,Fri Jun 26 13:28:40 2015 UTC,There are 1696 players in the nfl over 32 teams.  This means that on average a team will have 3 1/8 players in the top 100.  Having 5 players in the top means that we're 60% better than the average team using only this metric.

buffalobills,3ay31h,Hebs811,7,Wed Jun 24 21:52:31 2015 UTC,Hogan as the #3 receiver is pretty surprising to me
buffalobills,3ay31h,BZI,6,Wed Jun 24 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"Couple questions:   1) Why is Cassel still #1? After all we've heard I think EJ should get the bump.  2) If Duke Williams is ahead of Corey Grahm, shouldn't we revert him back to corner? We was playing incredible at corner, having him as a backup safety seems like a waste."
buffalobills,3ay31h,dbandbacon,6,Wed Jun 24 14:27:58 2015 UTC,Kinda weird that Goodwin's as low as #5 on the depth chart too. Rex gushes about Quise more than George Bluth salivates over an ice cream sandwich.
buffalobills,3ay31h,legendary_sponge,2,Wed Jun 24 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"Joe B said that graham isn't as physically talented to stay on an ""island"" in a rex ryan defense at corner. his instincts should translate really well to safety, as well, it sounds like we'll be using 3 safeties a good amount like we did in 2013."
buffalobills,3ay31h,jmm57,2,Wed Jun 24 18:49:18 2015 UTC,Rex plays a decent amount of three safety looks with one walked down into the box and two high. Duke Williams would be the in the box guy with Aaron Williams and Corey Graham being responsible for deep halves.

buffalobills,3ay31h,wesomg,2,Wed Jun 24 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anything to suggest that. It looks he based the WR a little bit on who's actually been playing in mini camps (Harvin and Dezmin Lewis are a spot lower than I would've thought, both have missed significant time this summer). I think it's more indicative of Hogan looking good in a starting outside spot in camps, rather than Harvin looking bad."

We'll have their O in check and its up to our boys to match their points. I have a feeling the games between the Bills and Dolphins are going to be the new Ravens vs. Steelers. A rough, tough, heated, hard hitting battle, and the victor has to truly earn it. I'm excited to watch both of these games."

buffalobills,3ayw26,samtresler,2,Wed Jun 24 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"I seriously think Miami is going to be dead last in our division. As long as Philbin is their coach, they will continue to vastly underperform.   Their offseason was terrible. They didn't need Suh, they needed to shore up their offensive line, which has been the predominant reason for them being mediocre for the past two seasons. They wasted their money on a luxury player they didn't need instead of protecting the most important player on their team.   This is the team that allowed Geno fucking Smith to have a perfect QB rating on them during the last game of the year when they were still in contention for a wildcard spot.  We swept them two years ago, and we should have swept them last year but got fucked over by shitty officiating. I'm much more worried about the Jets this year than the Dolphins."
buffalobills,3ayw26,JoesShittyOs,0,Thu Jun 25 04:33:36 2015 UTC,"Lest we forget that both Suh and Wake were non factors in the games we played against them. I also don't feel that they've gotten especially better in many positions. Add to the fact that Tannehill doesn't normally play well against us, I don't foresee them being too bad to play against."

Given the inconsistency in reported PSI numbers, I think it's his best bet - aside from just tucking his tail and going home wth a fine, a wrist slap and a guaranteed reputation as a 'convicted' cheater."

buffalobills,3aup18,legendary_sponge,47,Tue Jun 23 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"I just envision a perfect end to his career.  Our QB magically doesn't suck for a season, we prove all the doubters wrong, streamroll through the regular season, with the defense clobbering every team we play. The Bills kick ass and play some great, exciting games in the playoffs, and get to the Super Bowl. Then on a crucial, big moment - I'm thinking 3rd and 18 on the last drive of the game with the Bills down by 5 points - it's perhaps Buffalo's last chance. Then they hand it off to Fred and he bulldozes through the entire defense, all 11 guys, one-upping Marshawn once again and claiming the title for greatest run in playoff history, and sprints to the endzone and wins the Super Bowl and is crowned the MVP. He decides to retire ""to give the young 'uns a chance at the football thing"". Then the entirety of WNY goes nuts over the victory and the entire subreddit goes out for ice cream. And everybody lived happily ever after. Except for Tom Brady, who died of AIDS.   The End."

I can't say this on behalf of everyone, but I have nothing against Kyle. Players do what they do, and play like they can. He's a veteran and having him with EJ for last season was a good thing, I think. Everyone is always learning and to be taught by a veteran is a good thing to have, like Matt Cassel is probably doing now.  Kyle did a good job by giving us a winning record last year, sure he's not a superstar like Rodgers but he's also not a cancer in the locker room and from what I've seen he's a supporter and team player. So that's what a team needs.   Now bring it in brother!"

I really think Marrone micro managed beyond his skill level as a coach."
buffalobills,3arbza,KushFlows,13,Wed Jun 24 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"After it's all been said and done, I really don't have any ill will towards Orton. He did good for us, and when his play started to reflect his desire to retire - I honestly don't blame him, just one last hurrah of a season and then just don't get hit towards the end. Avoid one of those ugly hits and make it out of the other side of the NFL without too much damage.  And honestly, since not making the playoffs turned out to be a blessing in disguise - no more Marrone, he'll probably be remembered even more fondly despite the streak absorbing yet another year.  If he wasn't ready to retire last year and played a little longer, he really felt like a great match for this team."

buffalobills,3arsgq,jfrankel69,5,Tue Jun 23 00:04:32 2015 UTC,I'm glad Goodwin is not missing opportunities with US Men's T&F.  I wish him the best.  It would be a real uphill climb for him to make the roster as it is.  Go for gold.
buffalobills,3arsgq,Why_So-Serious,6,Tue Jun 23 12:50:20 2015 UTC,"It would be a real uphill climb for him to make the roster as it is.   I've heard nothing but glowing reports about him so far, actually. Rex Ryan has praised his route running and even said something to the effect of ""if everyone's open, he's the one you want the ball to go to."""
buffalobills,3arsgq,TurnTwo,2,Tue Jun 23 13:44:44 2015 UTC,It's a numbers game. It just doesn't add up.   Watkins Harvin Woods Are Locks  Easley is a lock as our special team ace.   Hogan is running with 1s now.   It's just a tight space and Goodwin's history may be too much to risk a roster space on a stacked roster.   The best ability is Availability.
buffalobills,3arsgq,Why_So-Serious,5,Tue Jun 23 13:54:52 2015 UTC,"Assume we keep six wide receivers. Watkins, Harvin, and Woods are locks. Call Easley a near-lock due to his contributions on special teams. That leaves two spots to be distributed among the following WRs currently on our 90-man roster:    Justin Brown Andre Davis Marquise Goodwin Chris Hogan Caleb Holley Dezmin Lewis Tobais Palmer Marcus Thigpen Deonte Thompson   I think Hogan and Goodwin are the clear safe bets out of that group. Maybe Dezmin Lewis because he adds a height dimension to our WR corps, but I haven't really heard any glowing reports out of mini camp yet. Thigpen is expendable with all the other KR/PR talent we have on the roster. At this point, a roster spot is Goodwin's to lose."
buffalobills,3arsgq,TurnTwo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"The bottom of any position group can have multiple strategies.   i.e. (God for Bid) If Watkins or Woods go down for an extended period of time is Goodwin a player that can come in and do what they do? I would argue no. He is a deep, speed threat.   So at the bottom of the WR group do you what a specialist or depth? I do not know.  The coaches will make that call.  Also a lot of times the bottom of the position group are players that are the ""coaches pet project"" or ""The coaches kind of guy."" Goodwin was the last round of coaches pet project.   Lewis or Thompson may fit the mold for  ""Pet project"" for Sanjay more than Goodwin. Especially as Training camp continues if they think they wouldn't get away with stashing either Lewis and Thompson on the PS and they want them then they may need to make a move and let Goodwin go.   I agree On pure talent Goodwin is probably ahead of those guys. One could argue though you know what you're getting with Goodwin where the other guys have a chance to grow and learn.   We will see, personally I think the deck is stacked against Goodwin making the team.   The fact that Goodwin is taking a chance to be away from a Training Camp means he probably thinks the deck is stacked against him too and is trying not to miss any opportunities on the USA Men's T&F team. 2016 would probably be his last chance at the olympics."

During his tenure with the Bills, it was like he painted the Mona Lisa with a pile of shit. Erik Pears looked good -- remember that? Fitzpatrick had a moment. We were converting 3rd downs.   If Geno can't turn it around with Gailey, he is a goner. I have faith in Gailey in that he can make Geno look decent enough so the Jets throw 2011 Fitzpatrick type money at him. Gotta Billieve"

buffalobills,3ap7td,YepImanEmokid,3,Mon Jun 22 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"The thing that really gets me is that they seem to ignore how hilariously bad Geno has been. EJ has, at worst, been poor. Largely been a bit below average with a handful of pretty solid games. Geno has had a few really good games, but even more where he looked like he'd never seen a football in his life. His few highs were certainly higher, but he had way more lows, and they were about as low as you can get."
buffalobills,3ap7td,smokey815,2,Mon Jun 22 16:10:14 2015 UTC,And we're all homers for disagreeing with them.
buffalobills,3ap7td,fortyonejb,2,Mon Jun 22 15:31:23 2015 UTC,"Not really.  When they say they'd rather have geno, they only base this off his good games, presuming is complete and utter meltdown games can be curtailed.  So when they say they'd rather have geno, they are saying they would rather have a guy who can throw for 300+ yards and multiple TDs even with his potential to play so poorly it makes it impossible for your team to win.  One thing our QB cannot do this year is give the opposing team chances to win. It completely defeats any gains our defense makes, destroys our momentum and makes out d tired.   In terms of upside, I think Geno has EJ beat. But Geno takes away chances to win just as easily as he provides them.  All we need is a QB who can make a few plays a game to capitalize on the good situations our D had provided. Think 2012,13 Russell Wilson. EJ has shown he can do that, particularly in his rookie year. If we can build the right scheme to cater to those strengths, I believe he is the more effective and consistent QB.  So in terms of what the bills need, I think EJ is the better fit."
buffalobills,3ap7td,Billionaire_Bot,16,Mon Jun 22 19:50:21 2015 UTC,It's interesting the best games EJ had were with the least amount of doug marrone coaching.

Which included having the final say in play choice and even telling EJ to not take any risk. How do you tell that to a developing player,  have him take necessary risk and learn from mistakes. Don't punish him by taking away your half of your OC's playbook and making your young QB lose confidence in himself. I can see EJ having that early game boom we've seen before with Rex because he tells it straight and let's the QBs run loose without destroying confidence. Just brush it off the shoulder"

buffalobills,3ap7td,Nomad86x,2,Mon Jun 22 15:00:22 2015 UTC,"This. He is suck a baller. We have so many weapons in this O. We need EJ to be just serviceable, and we will be good."
buffalobills,3ap7td,rob1703,10,Mon Jun 22 19:53:18 2015 UTC,The level of my hopes when I watch these videos  IS TOO DAMN HIGH!!
buffalobills,3ap7td,Something_More,19,Mon Jun 22 23:16:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know how people just typecasted him as a terrible quarterback.  He has two back to back bad games, and he got the boot quicker than multiple other QBs who've done the same.    I don't think he can be just average, I legitimately think he can be a good quarterback in this league.  He took the Pats down to the wire his first day game out.  He leads a ridiculous comeback his second game of the year.  Hell, he was doing great up until his injury.    He now has one of the strongest supporting casts in the league along with that huge chip on his shoulder.  I think he's got this."
buffalobills,3ap7td,JoesShittyOs,6,Mon Jun 22 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and he no longer has a coach shouting into his ear: ""don't you ever leave the pocket! Always check down! Don't make a single risky throw or I'll kill you!!!"""
buffalobills,3ap7td,fortyonejb,2,Mon Jun 22 12:52:01 2015 UTC,As a non Bills fan it confused the hell out of me. I saw him play in a pre season game and thought he looked fine. Watched his rookie games and he looked like a ... gasp rookie. But he looked like he could end up being more than serviceable. He just needed more time in the oven.
buffalobills,3ap7td,SilverViper,15,Mon Jun 22 15:27:40 2015 UTC,Actually...that was awesome. Man that Panthers game was fantastic. Let's Go EJ!
buffalobills,3ap7td,Yuk0nC0rnelius,15,Mon Jun 22 15:36:35 2015 UTC,The throw at ~1:25 is one of the better throws a Bills QB has made in the past decade.  Really hoping he turns a corner and can show that type of play with some consistency this year.  I think he's going to win the starting job.
buffalobills,3ap7td,scottpilgrimreaper,11,Mon Jun 22 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"I do too, he's a great person and has a wonderful work ethic"
buffalobills,3ap7td,naus226,7,Mon Jun 22 11:57:44 2015 UTC,Can we at least talk about how great his Play Action fake is? He sells that better than most QBs and he does trick camera men often with it.
buffalobills,3ap7td,11111one11111,3,Mon Jun 22 12:04:16 2015 UTC,I really hope he is a product of poor coaching. With the new staff I feel he could really take off.
buffalobills,3ap7td,Socceuro,4,Mon Jun 22 12:19:30 2015 UTC,"I've been saying it since day 1. This kid has got what it takes. I have no idea how he was just written off as terrible from the get go. He had a lot going against him; terrible coaching, injury, and not to mention he was starting his rookie year. He has the skill and the athleticism, and seems to have the mind for it too. Now it's just a matter of if he can pull it all together, go out there, and do it."
buffalobills,3ap7td,DjFeltTip,4,Mon Jun 22 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem with him was stupidity of coaching. In 2013 you had a rookie offensive coordinator, and at the same time, they didn't get the rookie Manuel a QB coach. The rookie OC served as the QB coach as well. I'm sorry, but whoever made that boneheaded decision should have been fired. Probably Maroon."
buffalobills,3ap7td,ShredSZN,3,Mon Jun 22 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"his problem is going through the WR progression. He is good when his first read is open, not so much when it isn't"
buffalobills,3ap7td,mikeytd,3,Mon Jun 22 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"I hope EJ wins the job, but it really seems like he stares down his receiver. I think a lot of these plays are his first read too, I really hope he has improved in making decisive decisions."
buffalobills,3ap7td,screechdiddy,3,Mon Jun 22 16:53:25 2015 UTC,All I could think about was Robert Woods watching that video
buffalobills,3ap7td,jcwood,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:02:40 2015 UTC,Seriously. He is SO good. Love watching him play.
buffalobills,3ap7td,BZI,4,Mon Jun 22 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"This made me wish we kept Stevie. And as good as EJ looks in this video, it's a highlights video. The lowlights version would have a lot more content(but I hope EJ has improved)"
buffalobills,3ap7td,Ballsortahard,2,Mon Jun 22 21:39:43 2015 UTC,I love those deep bombs to Goodwin so much
buffalobills,3ap7td,LoudSweaters,2,Tue Jun 23 16:49:21 2015 UTC,Robert Woods is always wide open. This should be his highlight video too haha
buffalobills,3ap7td,TheDrunkenWobblies,2,Mon Jun 22 13:44:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for posting this video. I, along with a lot of the rest of us, seem to have forgotten that over the course of his 14 game career (14!!!) that the negatives have always been more focused on than the positives. I'm pumped for EJ to lead this team for an entire season."
buffalobills,3ap7td,knuxo,2,Mon Jun 22 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"Somebody posted EJ's every snap from 2014.   That itself gives me hope that if we don't have a complete turnstile every play on the right side of the line, things will be okay. The Houston game was terrible, both in OL play and game planning to deal with JJ Watt.   Pears was absolutely terrible. I have praised him in the past. Not after watching the first 4 games. Fuck him.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c5HTvR1dts"
buffalobills,3ap7td,TheDrunkenWobblies,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, these are fantastic. Thank you. That Houston game, EJ actually looks decent. O_O  Mostly it just seems like he's playing like a talented guy without a lot of experience..."
buffalobills,3ap7td,knuxo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:55:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. The pressure he was getting that game was intense. Just go and do the three second clock that a QB has to be able to make a read and let routes develop. There are a few instances where EJ has to get out of there less than 2 seconds after the snap.   EJ isn't perfect. But that breakdown shows he could be pretty good when he has time as he often finds somebody if he has 3 seconds. There were some inaccurate throws.. but some where it looks like a bad pass was internationally thrown to where it couldn't get picked off. The JJ Watt interception was a fucking joke of a play call.. naked bootleg with Watt the unblocked guy? Were they trying to make EJ fail?
buffalobills,3ap7td,TheDrunkenWobblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand how people conclude the common refrain: He can't read a field. He can't find open receivers. He can't hit anyone in stride.  All of these games, it looks like he has a few bad throws (that can't be attributed to bad protection/miscommunication), but almost all of them I would chalk up to growing pains. I'll be satisfied if we get through camp and he hasn't proven his ability, but man I feel like a lot of fans have been unfair to him."
buffalobills,3ap7td,Nomad86x,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:36:09 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see this breakdown for his 2013 games too. EJ really recognizes his protection breaking down at times like some of the best of em. Reminds me of Cunningham and his ability to juke rushers.. Give him a good OL and there will be magic.
buffalobills,3ap7td,pigion84,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"There's certainly validity to the criticisms of his ability to read defenses and his accuracy, but during that season, he really had some great moments. I really hope whatever needs to happen for him does; whether it was Marrone GTFO, or fixing the accuracy or not playing scared. Whatever his game needed/needs I hope he got/gets it.   Because if/when the day comes that we throw EJ onto the rubbish heap of ""QBs that didn't cut it"", he's going to be one that I look back on and think ""Man, if things played out differently, it could've worked out for us and him""."

buffalobills,3ap7td,JP714,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:05:07 2015 UTC,You mean Stevie Johnson? He was an average receiver who didn't run normal routes and had attitude problems that clashed with marrone
buffalobills,3ap7td,NFLVideoConverterBot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:54:05 2015 UTC,That's slander. Stevie Johnson never had locker room or attitude problems within the team. Stevie Johnson was also a way better than average receiver. He was a good teamate and loyal to the Buffalo area. End of story.
buffalobills,3ap7td,anujsingh83,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:52:00 2015 UTC,"yeah but... http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d81c7a11b/Johnson-drops-potential-winning-TD  He's dropped a few very clutch passes over the years. He is obviously above average, but expensive. Look at our young receiving core this year. Do you really have regrets over not keeping Stevie?"

buffalobills,3aqckj,Petrol_in_my_eyes,6,Mon Jun 22 17:27:39 2015 UTC,Chris Hogan showing that he deserves to be on this roster?  Today was a good day.
buffalobills,3aqckj,Nomad86x,3,Mon Jun 22 22:24:38 2015 UTC,What are the chances of dealing Bryce Brown to anyone at this point? My initial thought was maybe a mid to late pick from Dallas for him. I know it's a long shot but I feel like there's more upside for a team like the cowboys to take a chance on him.
buffalobills,3aqckj,GoreyEnd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:47:59 2015 UTC,I feel it'll be more likely that we'll cut him before the season starts and someone will pick him up in free agency
buffalobills,3aqckj,4and1punt,3,Mon Jun 22 19:24:09 2015 UTC,Awesome! EJ is improving and it's looking more and more like 7/11 will make the final roster. Good news all around!

buffalobills,3apxlw,jonahan,6,Mon Jun 22 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yea I saw that and they showed it in the preview for the next episode.  At first I thought it was a flashback to him hitting someone so hard he killed them, but I'm hoping it was to show him getting injured?  Also made me not miss those jerseys at all."
buffalobills,3apxlw,MarhsalRaylanGivens,2,Mon Jun 22 15:46:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I initially thought too.  But Based off the post episode behind the scenes interviews I'm assuming the hit lead to a brain scan which found a brain tumour or something so he's trying to accomplish as mich as possible before he succumbs to it.  Six feet under already did that, I feel like him dealing with the trauma of accidentally killing a guy on the field would be more compelling, although that might have happened as well."
buffalobills,3apxlw,Chasedabigbase,3,Mon Jun 22 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"I would much prefer the latter (trauma of accidentally killing a guy, potential PTSD and a need to ""make amends""). I think that could be very compelling for a show with a sports theme to it. The ""terminal illness/injury"" theme has been abused to death in TV/movies. Also, since you mentioned it...Six Feet Under was awesome."

buffalobills,3anqxs,Tadpoles_Seem_Weird,18,Mon Jun 22 00:43:30 2015 UTC,There's a shit ton of good food in Buffalo. If you want some tasty BBQ; go to Fat Bob's.  I also recommend hitting up Pearl Street Grill and Brewery and taking in some local suds.
buffalobills,3anqxs,KinslayersLegacy,6,Mon Jun 22 00:52:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I love local craft beer. Just for reference, how close is everything awesome to the stadium?"
buffalobills,3anqxs,clingsmash,5,Mon Jun 22 00:53:33 2015 UTC,The stadium is a 20 minute drive from the city. Most of the cool stuff is in the city!
buffalobills,3anqxs,FantasticDucks,2,Mon Jun 22 01:30:47 2015 UTC,Is it a 20 min drive on a gameday?
buffalobills,3anqxs,TheDrunkenWobblies,4,Mon Jun 22 03:19:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on how early you leave. Before 9am. Yep.. after.. up to an hour and more if weather is bad.  If you leave at 11, you won't be tailgating."
buffalobills,3anqxs,clingsmash,2,Mon Jun 22 03:54:12 2015 UTC,Down route 5 it's about 30 from downtown if you leave before 10a
buffalobills,3anqxs,ConneryFTW,2,Mon Jun 22 12:09:50 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for craft beer, I recommend Resurgence. It's in the city, so about 20 minutes from the stadium.

buffalobills,3anqxs,KinslayersLegacy,-1,Mon Jun 22 15:22:16 2015 UTC,I just don't think anything they make is good. Rusty chain is probably the most well named beer I've ever had as it tastes exact spot like a mouthful of rust water.

buffalobills,3ahijb,theduke34,46,Sat Jun 20 05:57:25 2015 UTC,I'm excited that EJ might be our quarterback. I'm worried that EJ might be our quarterback.
buffalobills,3ahijb,JoesShittyOs,11,Sat Jun 20 07:00:40 2015 UTC,I know..cannot get the image of him completing the touchdown pass to JJ Watt outta my head.
buffalobills,3ahijb,BadMeetsEvil147,15,Sat Jun 20 07:18:33 2015 UTC,"That was a great play by watt, and EJ isn't the only qb who looked that bad vs JJ watt. You have to think that the whole game JJ was only getting ""blocked"" by Seantrel and he took full advantage of the mismatch. Also, JJ Watt had an MVP worthy year, so if anything it was poor coaching on preparation for JJ watt"
buffalobills,3ahijb,BadMeetsEvil147,2,Sat Jun 20 11:40:17 2015 UTC,Had not watched the play since the game. Just found it on youtube. Henderson completely missed his assignment. That probably was more on him than EJ.
buffalobills,3ahijb,JoesShittyOs,2,Sat Jun 20 16:23:09 2015 UTC,Was ej playing conservative? Yes but he absolutely had no help from his line in those 4 games. His running attack was non existent so he had to play behind from the start. The kid got put in a bad position to begin with
buffalobills,3ahijb,BadMeetsEvil147,2,Sat Jun 20 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I'm pretty sure JJ Watt is the only lineman in the league who's capable of making that type of play. Hell, had Watt missed that throw Fred would have been able to make a big play."
buffalobills,3ahijb,ThePopcanKid,7,Sat Jun 20 12:24:49 2015 UTC,"Well Cassel can be average to slightly under average, so it says something about EJ"
buffalobills,3ahijb,The_Punniest,7,Sat Jun 20 06:23:42 2015 UTC,I'm excited because of new coaches. He can only be better with a new coordinator who has worked with young QBs.
buffalobills,3ahijb,Billionaire_Bot,4,Sat Jun 20 11:17:15 2015 UTC,"Excited, but worried."
buffalobills,3ahijb,jedwar05,5,Sat Jun 20 06:45:24 2015 UTC,"Excited.  Especially as it seems that EJ has looked actually good, not necessarily the least awful.  If we can cater to his strengths and let his confidence grow, I think he can be effective in the NFL"
buffalobills,3ahijb,coppersink63,3,Sat Jun 20 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"My personal feelings are you know what you're getting with Matt Cassel, an average QB who can win games when put in the right situation. With Taylor and Manuel, they're more wild cards. As long as one of them wins the QB battle, it means they've surpassed the ""sure thing"" average QB. I think EJ's size and tools put him in a better situation than Taylor, so if he wins I think we have good things coming our way. EXCITED."
buffalobills,3ahijb,Yuk0nC0rnelius,3,Sat Jun 20 15:10:51 2015 UTC,No question it's a good thing he is doing well.  I am really critical of EJ personally but if our first round pick is gathering steam than we should all be excited.
buffalobills,3ahijb,I_AmTheLiquor,3,Sat Jun 20 12:38:47 2015 UTC,I'm excited for EJ. I think he has shown that he understands the work that you have to put in to be successful in the NFL. Hopefully everything can come together for him.
buffalobills,3ahijb,errorsniper,4,Mon Jun 22 12:29:31 2015 UTC,Excited.  Best case scenario for this franchise is EJ develops into a quality QB.
buffalobills,3ahijb,Pdb39,0,Sat Jun 20 21:03:22 2015 UTC,Worst case he continues to be a fuck up and loses us games.
buffalobills,3ahijb,nysom1227,2,Mon Jun 22 04:48:35 2015 UTC,Probably a little early to start feeling any angst over the Bills QB situation.   Still a long way to go.
buffalobills,3ahijb,BelligerantFuck,2,Sat Jun 20 14:16:04 2015 UTC,Seems like the third year tends to be the charm for a lot of QBs in the league. It was for Cam Newton. Maybe it'll be the same for EJ.
buffalobills,3ahijb,jimshortz,2,Sun Jun 21 04:46:58 2015 UTC,"If EJ can throw down the sideline without the ball floating 5 yards out of bounds, then we're fine.  If he got rid of his yips that had his short passes nowhere near catchable, he'll work out.  If he has learned to at least get to his 2nd progression before dumping it off, awesome.  If the o-line can give him more than 1.75 seconds to do any of those things, deep playoff run.    The short passes to the YAC guys and Shady doing his thing will only work if the opposing defense has to respect the mid to deep field.  We've seen what happens when they can just stack the box."
buffalobills,3ahijb,fortyonejb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:05:57 2015 UTC,And his footwork.  He needs to stop throwing off of his back foot and place the ball and show some more confidence in the pocket and step into those throws.

buffalobills,3agp4v,theduke34,8,Sat Jun 20 17:07:56 2015 UTC,Well from other reports it does sound like cassel is losing the qb race although this is written in typical negative Rodak style.
buffalobills,3agp4v,tictaxtoe,5,Sat Jun 20 01:43:40 2015 UTC,"If they don't have a better use for the money, I don't see why they'd cut him.  Even if he was #3."

buffalobills,3agp4v,FantasticDucks,0,Sun Jun 21 02:57:55 2015 UTC,Right but we could also do that next year.  And Mario and Gilmore still have more time don't they?  Bradham and Glenn are more pressing.

buffalobills,3agp4v,SeanJuan,4,Sun Jun 21 20:21:43 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm in with the minority of bills fans when I say I didn't see  Cassel starting for us  when we got him. It seem most fans want and think Cassel is the best option. I just don't see it. You know what Cassel has and can do its mediocre mid level play at best. Why not go with the younger option worst case he's slightly less than what Cassel will give us best option he's better or he could be the same.   Anyone else feel this way?
buffalobills,3agp4v,BooB398,7,Sat Jun 20 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"If Cassel isn't the #1 or a crystal clear #2 over Taylor, they'll dump him and keep Simms."
buffalobills,3agp4v,Moruitelda,2,Sat Jun 20 02:01:57 2015 UTC,Really? I'd figured they'd keep him unless Simms wowed them.
buffalobills,3agp4v,FantasticDucks,6,Sat Jun 20 05:39:31 2015 UTC,There's no way that we'd keep Cassel for almost $5 million this year if he's not a starter or a clearly superior backup option to Taylor. We'd cut him loose and use that cap space for Dareus/Bradham/Glenn's extensions.
buffalobills,3agp4v,Moruitelda,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:39:17 2015 UTC,Makes sense
buffalobills,3agp4v,FantasticDucks,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:56:32 2015 UTC,Do you think they'll try to trade for/sign another vet if Cassel doesn't work?
buffalobills,3agp4v,YepImanEmokid,2,Sat Jun 20 05:02:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't hold my breath. Who's available at a reasonable price and an upgrade? I can't think of much of anyone.
buffalobills,3agp4v,Moruitelda,2,Sat Jun 20 05:07:40 2015 UTC,"Cannot believe that I am saying this.....  ...But, if the Bears are seriously considering trading for Kaep, and they cut Cutler, it would not be the worst thing in the world if we signed him.   Longshot, but would be the best among bad options."

buffalobills,3agp4v,Moruitelda,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"Cutler would be a pretty great pick up depending on how much it costs to get him. At the same time, I doubt that the 49ers would give up Kaep."

EJ has the most experience (playing in game wise) and even he hasn't started or played that much.  I'd like to keep someone who has played for awhile on the team."
buffalobills,3agp4v,pmkilla,3,Sat Jun 20 02:17:39 2015 UTC,Taylor spent four years under a super bowl MVP. It's not like he was out picking daisies all that time

There's not really a Bills' bar that I know of in Roanoke, but there are often a few of us at the Fork in the Alley (in Crystal Springs, near the hospital) on NFL Sundays.  The manager is a Niners fan, which could be worse.  (My band plays there the third Sunday of each month and we talk about about the games between songs. I'm a Bills fan, bassist is a big Saints fan)  Cornerstone downtown has a ""no more than 2 Cowboys fans allowed at one time"" sign above the bar, so at least you won't have that there.  The CI (Community Inn) on Grandin is (or at least was) an Eagles bar, but is still a very fun place."

Most of the defense was sitting by the end as well (you didn't score a point in the second half despite that). You just weren't missing anywhere near that amount of talent and it was still a one possession game. It's not exactly a win I'd use as an example for how you would do against the Patriots missing just Brady."

The article doesn't speculate that Henderson could be out, and given that we only have four realistic tackles on our roster, even if Wayne Hunter beats him out (I doubt it), he still might very well have a shot as a ninth offensive lineman on the roster.   I think Hunter's a camp body. He was garbage and hasn't played in like two years."
buffalobills,3agpfi,Moruitelda,5,Sat Jun 20 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"""He was garbage and hasn't played in like two years""  Glad I saw this.

I also think that he was described (at the time of the trade) as a ""Human Turnstyle"""
buffalobills,3agpfi,theduke34,8,Sat Jun 20 05:53:51 2015 UTC,This guy was one of the worst rated tackles. I don't see him taking seantrels spot.
buffalobills,3agpfi,MessiahNIN,6,Sat Jun 20 00:59:15 2015 UTC,I dont think it will be the end of Seantrel he is young and still has massive potential he might be a backup for awhile but i highly doubt they will cut him just based on his upside. He still could be a great tackle in the NFL he just needs to learn how to adjust to the league and having a veteran like hunter could help Seantrel learn the ins and outs of being a tackle.
buffalobills,3agpfi,robbay,5,Sat Jun 20 00:47:29 2015 UTC,This guy is just a camp body. No way we get rid of a guy in his early 20s with huge upside for an over the hill average tackle.

Anyone who could swim was able to get around him due to his poor footwork.   I hope Cyrus put in the work, because with his size and strength he could be a scary pass protector and vicious run blocker. I just don't know how he managed to wind up ahead of Seantrel who seemed like a much better player than him last season.  Then again, I don't have the words ""Head Coach"" after my name for a reason."

I know our first team defense is elite, so that's somewhat reassuring, but the question is: how well do our second team guys stack up against NFL first team defenses?   Can EJ produce against the big boys?"
buffalobills,3acmxu,LastBaron,3,Fri Jun 19 12:42:48 2015 UTC,Yeah but the offense supporting him was second team as well so it's not like there were huge mismatches to give him an advantage

At one point the Pats were the media darlings. I rooted for them in 01, and since then Boston has had a ton of Sports success.   The Pats have been busted a few times cheating, and maybe if they didn't, we could have had a playoff game or two.

buffalobills,3a5xuo,MilesHighClub_,4,Wed Jun 17 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"Even if they do, he's a damn good (but not the best in the league) defensive end who's nearly up to quarterback salary this year. His 2015 salary is $12.1M and his cap hit is $19.4M.   That's seriously overpaid, even though he's an awesome player."

There is more at play to the situation, it made us a legitimate destination for talent and started the chain of events for Pegula to swoop in and make the purchase.  It's not just dollars per sack."
buffalobills,3a5xuo,dammitOtto,3,Wed Jun 17 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is exaggerating to say that this contract saved the franchise.   Yes and no. I think it helped draw attention from other free agents, but our franchise's improvement hasn't been on free agents; it's been on the draft. We've drafted Marcell Dareus, Nigel Bradham, Preston Brown, Ty Powell, Stephon Gilmore, Aaron Williams, Duke Williams, Kiko Alonso, Cordy Glenn, Sammy Watkins, and Robert Woods in the past few years, and all of them really panned out well.   That's what saved the franchise. Not Mario's contract.   started the chain of events for Pegula to swoop in and make the purchase.   I think you're crazy if you think Pegula's decision to buy the team was in any way related to Mario's contract."
buffalobills,3a5xuo,Moruitelda,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"I can't help but agree. Mario is amazing player to have on our team and really seems to enjoy his time here in Buffalo. I hope he retires here because we fans love him and MOST of us never doubted his contract even after a slow start. The guy is pure brawn and doesn't at all look the part of a DE which is kind of crazy. Him and JJ are cut from the same cloth. JJ is easily the best in the league (Houston can be argued too obviously) just for pure flexibility.   I think we built our line around him well and I even think we are getting some nice up an comers. The key is going to be keeping together M&M. Hughes is great (we overpaid him but he deserves it for what he's done for us) but if it comes to Marcel vs Jerry then the answer is clearly Marcel (unless he keeps fucking up off the field). Kyle is due to retire soon given he's a pretty smart guy and has been here awhile. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, fucking hope we can WIN at least 1 playoff game with him on the team. I don't think any player in our franchise history (Except maybe Brian Mormon but I digress) has deserved that more for their loyalty.   Our front 7 will be our key to success. I hope our safeties keep up their strong play in the back but I think that's half dependent on our LB play. Those guys help out covering the slots and check downs and I think our Safeties will have a field day out there with the pressure given.   I've never been 100% sold on Mckelvin, I know he's gotten much better but I always thought he was a reach that was half determined because of Bobby April wanting to use him on ST. To think we could have had Aqib Talib (Don't even get me fucking started on Passing on hometown boy Gronk who's family I know I like quite a bit out in Williamsville, for Troup) instead. Or Brandon Flowers, or Dominique Roders-Cromartie. Actually I think we had lots of better options in a very deep CB class in 08. That was actually one of the best drafts in long time IMO and I wouldn't say we completely missed, but it was pretty close to a total miss.   Gilmore I think is going to be a stud. I think he played scared (and hurt) year one but is starting to come into his own. I'd like to see him be a bit more physical and more of a pest at the line to throw guys off their game a little.   Overall our D is clearly our Bread and Butter and Mario was our starting off point for that. The drafts since he arrived took the course they did because we got them. If we didn't have our stud DE who knows how it would have played out."
buffalobills,3a5xuo,scag315,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"i think if you are a team without an ""elite"" QB to pay, that you can afford to ""overpay"" for other important positions.  even if Mario is ""overpaid"" (which i think there is an argument that he isn't), it was the good kind of overpay -- for an elite difference maker type player.  and those dollars have to go SOMEWHERE if there is no QB to pay."

buffalobills,3a5xuo,Moruitelda,3,Wed Jun 17 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"Well, he probably is about 3-5 million per year overpaid. But that's what needed to be done to bring him to Buffalo.  I would hope he restructures either at the end of this season or next though. I think we'll see Mario restructure to play beside Darius for a few more years."

Having watched every 49er game throughout Harbaugh/Greg Roman's tenure, I was really interested in seeing if the reason that S.F. NEVER ran any screen plays was due to Roman, Harbaugh, or maybe just Kapernick's inability to run said plays  I can't wait to see what an unrestricted Roman offense really looks like.  Harbaugh was most likely at fault for much of the 49ers woes last season, and the fact that the Bills are practicing screens is great."

Bradham and Brown aren't really ever going to come off the field as they are 3 down LBs and Hughes/Lawson are going to man the other OLB/DE spot. The Dline is set and will add Carrington/Charles/Bryant/etc. to fill Branch's role from 2013. I just don't see where Spikes could come in and get valuable playing time in a defense that preaches versatility, disguise, and variety for that price. At the vet's minimum I could see him maybe being worth it, however, how satisfied would he be taking a severe paycut and a reduced role?"
buffalobills,3a048x,Yamez9,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming Bradham and Brown take 100% of snaps, and they do not get injured this season, then Manny Lawson is our ""third"" LB. Don't you think we could use a little more depth at LB? Especially since we may be able to get him cheap and he already knows the team? I'm talking about a 1-yr contract so I'm not really concerned with how ""satisfied"" he would be, although after being cut from the Pats I'm sure he'd be happy to just have any contract at this point."
buffalobills,3a048x,JP714,2,Tue Jun 16 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily - Ryan and Pettine's schemes use a lot of nickel and dime, and way less base packages than Schwartz used in 2014 meaning only 1-2 LBs will really see the bulk of the work. Lawson can't really be considered depth for the ILBs since he slots into the OLB/DE role that Hughes currently fits - same will likely be the case for Randell Johnson, who is lanky like Lawson but could also be an ILB, and Michael Buchanan.   In terms of depth for the ILBs, Ryan will likely keep Ty Powell and Tony Steward, both of whom are more of the mold of Bradham and Brown and are very athletic, versatile, and a little more stocky. Jimmy Gaines and Johnson could also work as ILBs but Powell and Steward would be my bet to stick as Ryan has raved about Powell so far, and Steward is a draft pick and a former HS stud that still has ability, despite his injuries.  After that, it really just becomes a numbers game for Spikes. Depending on how many LBs and DEs they decide to keep, they might not even have a spot for Spikes on the 53 man roster. In 2013, Pettine kept 8 LBs and DEs - looking through who the Bills currently have I'd argue 94, 55, 53, 52, 91, 57, and 50 are safe. Thats 7 out of the 8 spots already taken up with the last spot likely coming down to Buchanan or Wynn, who is more versatile. I just don't really see an opening for a run stuffing, slow, LB like Spikes when they could keep a few younger, more athletic ILBs that fit their scheme instead."
buffalobills,3a048x,Yamez9,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"So basically you'd prefer to keep Steward, Gaines, Johnson, AND Tarpley instead of dropping one of them for a veteran LB who played 50% of our snaps last year? Assuming a cheap price, and 1-year contract, how can you go wrong with Spikes? We have plenty of young LB (Bradham has most experience with only 4 yrs played), as you stated, and it would be nice to have a vet in the mix to help mold them and continue to help us against the run next season. At least until we see how well the young guys fit into this scheme. You make great points, but I just can't see not signing another 1-yr deal to get a little more experience in at LB. Very low risk move to ensure we don't lose an integral part of our LB core from last year."
buffalobills,3a048x,JP714,2,Wed Jun 17 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"Nooo I'm not advocating for keeping Gaines or Tarpley over Spikes because they aren't likely to make the 53 man roster. Steward I think is a lock as most draft picks are in the year they are drafted, and Powell has been raved about by Ryan as of late so I think he is safe as well. That presents a log jam at LB where it would be hard to get Spikes a spot on the 53 man roster because you'd have to choose between keeping Powell, Steward, and Spikes. Eventually you get to the point where you can't keep them all without taking depth from other positions on the roster. The decision then comes down to, would they rather keep Powell and Steward, who are likely capable of playing all 3 downs if Brown or Bradham get hurt, or keeping Spikes who has shown he is very limited against the pass. With depth signings, I feel it is more important to emphasize versatility, especially in this hybrid scheme, more so than veteran leadership that can be obtained through Manny Lawson, Jerry Hughes, Mario Williams, etc.   If we were talking about only signing Spikes to the 90 man roster for training camp, then that would be a different story. I would be all for it, but I still wouldn't change my opinion that he would be a long shot to make the 53 man roster come September."

buffalobills,39l6t5,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Fri Jun 12 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"They're not really set in the secondary outside of Revis. Cromartie has always been an inconsistent player, and despite the pro bowl nod, he's still only good, not great. He just looks great cuz he has always been the number two. Skrine has been one of the worst starting corners (if you count nickel as a starter) in recent years, I guess he got the attention and money because he got four picks in 2014. Dee Milliner has much to prove, but it looks like he is their fourth corner for now. He's good for a fourth corner. :P  Gilmore is expected to take a big step this year, but regardless he is probably a little better than Cro is now. Robey is a better nickel than Skrine. Lol his first name is Nickell, it was meant to be. :P McKelvin can be a good starter if there are no complications from injury. Darby is a great prospect, possibly a number two corner in the future, but he can play inside too (Robey is on a contract year).  Gilchrist is good safety, I'll give them that. Aaron Williams is on the same level as him. Pryor will have to step it up after a disappointing rookie season. The Bills don't have a great safety beside Williams though. I think it's Graham and Duke Williams battling it out there. I'd have to give Pryor to nod due to his potential."
buffalobills,39l6t5,wafflesareforever,2,Sun Jun 14 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Leodis, but I think Gilmore has done enough to earn a starting spot and has the potential to develop into a star."

buffalobills,39l6t5,fairly_legal,16,Fri Jun 12 20:14:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Packers' fans know what's up.  In reality, Gilmore might be top-15 CB in the league and certainly top 30. That makes our top CB, about average for a CB1. On the plus side, he's young and likely still improving.  Who knows where McKelvin truly is ranked, whether a better than average CB2 as he played for much of 2014, or a low end CB2/high CB3 as he was prior. I'd say it's more likely we see a repeat of last year's play if only because the pressure from our D-Line will remain which limits the CB responsibilities. Either way, our own fanbase isn't even all-in on our CB2.  Corey Graham was truly special, ranking in the top-10 (of all CB's in the league) in lots of metrics, yet playing as both a CB2 and CB3. Now, it's likely he will be moving to safety, and also that he doesn't have a long track record of being a shut down corner.  Nickel Robey also looked solid in nickle and dime packages.  We know that the reason Darby's college numbers look weak when it comes to INTs is that he was the least targeted #1 in college.    Either way, it's understandable that McKelvin, Graham, and Darby are under-appreciated by /r/NFL. A lot of their success does come from the fact that our D-line put incredible pressure on the QB without blitzing, obviously meaning that few receivers were uncovered, or even left on an island without safety help.  Also, we're swapping in some new starters at S. Now, we've done it before and Searcy ended up being a solid if not all-pro like Byrd replacement, so we have faith that we can do it again. I like the optimism, but again I understand why other fanbases aren't going to think our secondary as a whole is top 10."

That said, I hope it becomes a defensive line that goes down in bills history for what they actually achieved. Playing an integral part in getting us back in the playoffs...  I think it's our turn, boys. People say it every year, but this year I have a good vibe. The d-line can't do it alone, but with a decent running game and a QB who can LEAD us, we're going to the playoffs this year."

buffalobills,39hq5z,binaryvisions,14,Fri Jun 12 01:19:36 2015 UTC,"A star 34 year old who was demanding a new contract despite being only 2 years into his last contract doesn't sound like a recipe for financial health to me.  The Bills definitely need the help on the O-line, but it sounds like Mathis is looking for a big (and likely long-term) paycheck, and at 34 years old, the team needs to be careful that they don't pick him up at the expense of signing the young guys like Dareus/Gilmore/etc. over the next couple years."
buffalobills,39hq5z,nemoomen,2,Thu Jun 11 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think we can pay him for more than a 2 year deal, nor would we want to."
buffalobills,39hq5z,AngryPurpleTeddyBear,3,Fri Jun 12 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, the big question is - is anyone else willing to pay him what he wants?  Now that we're post-draft, Mathis could see his market dry up pretty quickly based on his demands.  If the Bills put out feelers and just see how the wind is blowing, it's possible we could pick him up on a cheap-ish deal for only a couple years.  I'd absolutely sink some money into him as a short-term upgrade."
buffalobills,39hq5z,36in36,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  If the price is right, let him and Incognito play, while Miller learns.  That's a big upgrade at guard over last season."
buffalobills,39hq5z,AngryPurpleTeddyBear,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:01:24 2015 UTC,Looks like Rex agrees.  The Bills are definitely going to reach out to Mathis' camp and see if a deal could be made.
buffalobills,39hq5z,CleanBaldy,7,Sun Jun 14 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"If I was him, I'd actually be very interested in talking with Buffalo at this point.   With the team the way it is right now, he'd be a great addition on an already B+ rated team.   (crosses fingers)"

buffalobills,39hq5z,Moruitelda,7,Thu Jun 11 20:31:53 2015 UTC,It would more likely mean that both Chris Williams and Leodis McKelvin are gone

buffalobills,39hq5z,Moruitelda,10,Thu Jun 11 21:41:19 2015 UTC,He was the second best guard in the league last year.
buffalobills,39hq5z,Patrickhart123,6,Thu Jun 11 22:29:22 2015 UTC,"The holes in this team are getting smaller and smaller, it'd be nice to close up yet another one."
buffalobills,39hq5z,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"John Miller (third-round pick) projects to be a decent starter early on, and he has potential to be a good one in the near future. Richie Incognito was a good guard, but ya don't really know what you're gonna get out of him after he's been out of the league for a while."
buffalobills,39hq5z,Notalent13,2,Sun Jun 14 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"If hes an upgrade to our Offensive Line, I can see why people would want to, especially since Chris Williams is awful, and Leodis is gone next year anyways most likely."
buffalobills,39hq5z,deck65,3,Thu Jun 11 22:26:52 2015 UTC,No free agents until Darues is re-signed. Once that happens then they can get an idea of what their cap situation is going to be like.

buffalobills,39hq5z,drewdistilled,4,Thu Jun 11 20:10:38 2015 UTC,Yeah but we have Uncle Terry
buffalobills,39hq5z,binaryvisions,10,Thu Jun 11 20:32:09 2015 UTC,Why does everyone keep bringing up the Pegulas as a reason why free agents are getting signed? There's a salary cap. All teams spend the same amount of money.   There has to be up front money for signing bonuses but I doubt there's an owner in the league who couldn't come up with cash for signing bonuses.  Am I missing something?
buffalobills,39hq5z,drewdistilled,8,Thu Jun 11 21:01:56 2015 UTC,I was just playing around. You're right of course. Go Bills
buffalobills,39hq5z,CoveredSquirrel,2,Thu Jun 11 22:52:28 2015 UTC,Pegula has been really forward about paying large amounts of money up front - look at the Jerry Hughes deal. Ralph didn't often fork out big amounts of guaranteed cash up front.
buffalobills,39hq5z,binaryvisions,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:20:19 2015 UTC,"The Bills were in the top-5 in dead money over the past two seasons. That's the double-edged sword of guaranteed cash, and something the team had to get out from under.  I think it's good they're willing to pay for talent but giant guarantees in contracts are pretty rough once you get a couple years into them."
buffalobills,39hq5z,heff17,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:37:41 2015 UTC,"Am I missing something?   As Ralph got on in years, he was very reluctant to give out money to players. Buffalo was constantly giving away good, drafted players for essentially nothing because Ralph wouldn't pay them. Buffalo would constantly have tons of cap space while also being a poor team.  Pegula has no qualms about playing right up to the cap."
buffalobills,39hq5z,binaryvisions,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"Do you have any specifics/links? I'd like to read more about that. The Bills had a ton of dead money on their cap in the last couple years, which is not the sign of an owner who is being tight fisted. Fitz obviously got inappropriately paid. And it's not very common for teams to go year-to-year well under the cap.  I haven't paid as much attention to the finances of everything until the last couple years so it may well be the case, and I'd like to learn a little more.  edit: sportrac shows that the Bills had some cap space in 2011, but it was rolled over and spent in the following years. Since 2009 (the oldest year they have data for), the Bills are generally mid-pack in cap space."
buffalobills,39hq5z,AngryPurpleTeddyBear,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:28:02 2015 UTC,"I don't have any links to give you, but remember how everyone flipped a shit when the Bills gave TO a 1-year, $6M contract because that was a big FA expense for Ralph Wilson?  That pretty much sums up what so many of the later Wilson years were like."
buffalobills,39hq5z,JoesShittyOs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:19:31 2015 UTC,The money has to come from somewhere. That's where Pegula comes in.
buffalobills,39hq5z,binaryvisions,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Not really. Signing bonuses are paid up front from the teams, but the actual salary each year comes from the NFL's profits."
buffalobills,39hq5z,geoffyou,0,Fri Jun 12 10:12:05 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure about cap space, but I would love to see this happen. Glenn and Mathis on the left, Wood in the middle, and Miller and Incognito on the right. That would be a fairly formidable lineup."
buffalobills,39hq5z,Moruitelda,4,Thu Jun 11 20:11:48 2015 UTC,Neither Incognito nor Miller is a promising tackle. They don't have the length. Henderson or Kouandjio is getting that job.

buffalobills,39hbgk,nickphoto,2,Thu Jun 11 18:54:07 2015 UTC,I think getting a little west coast Greg Roman offense will help mix up this division this year.
buffalobills,39hbgk,The_Punniest,4,Fri Jun 12 06:27:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's been pretty clear that we're trying to be the 2012 49ers.  I think we might pass a little more though.  SF had a top run blocking line and mediocre WRs.  We on the other hand have abysmal run blocking and stellar WRs.  We could have addressed this and made a push for Iupati, but went after Bulaga instead.  We also have a RB who excels in space as opposed to a ground and pounder.   I think we'll certainly be top ten in rushing attempts, but I would not be surprised if all the running game talk is a bit of a smoke screen and we come out with a bit more focus on quick strikes setting up YAC opportunities."
buffalobills,39hbgk,SeanJuan,0,Thu Jun 11 19:49:00 2015 UTC,"Miller and Incognito should help that, assuming Incognito is still good. Their line really isn't that bad, aside from Henderson, he's gotta get better!  Also, I wouldn't say STELLAR wide receivers. Watkins is gonna be amazing! Idk about the others though. Woods is quite average, though he is improving. Harvin can be great, but health is always a concern."

buffalobills,39l50f,stinky_taters,18,Fri Jun 12 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"Where do I start? I won't, such a bullshit article doesn't deserve my time. Written by the mind of a 12 year old."
buffalobills,39l50f,DjFeltTip,7,Fri Jun 12 15:01:31 2015 UTC,"He's sorta right however, Manuel has always played a bit gunshy. Hes the opposite of most bad young QB's, very few errors...but good god is he afraid to actually take shots down the field. I still feel hes got a legit chance, Alex Smith was panned as worthless until Roman and Harbaugh came into SF and made him a star, they (Roman and Rex) might be able to do the same for Manuel.  Edit: Clarification."
buffalobills,39l50f,Notalent13,6,Fri Jun 12 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"I've been on the Manuel bandwagon from day 1, but now I want him to make it so much more."
buffalobills,39l50f,Socceuro,2,Fri Jun 12 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"Opinion piece based off of zero analysis other than one line (also opinion) from Joe B. who has never been a fan of EJ.  Upvoted for at least being new, interesting content."
buffalobills,39l50f,curmudge_john,2,Fri Jun 12 17:07:39 2015 UTC,Any article claiming the Tom Fucking Brady wouldn't have even made the NFL if not drafted by the Patriots is a goddamn retarded one.
buffalobills,39l50f,heff17,2,Fri Jun 12 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"He has a point there. While it is exaggerated a bit, situations are a key factor in how players pan out. It's not like all players that go to this team will be screwed, but how they fit in the system, mesh with the coaches, what their mentality is, how comfortable they are, the list goes on. I didn't actually read the article, so it could be some crap, but situation is key to how a player pans out, no doubt to that."
buffalobills,39flg1,Zep_Rocko,7,Thu Jun 11 11:47:33 2015 UTC,"""The number of offensive weapons added to Buffalo’s offense this offseason has been well documented. That caliber of talent can win on most plays in one-on-one situations. However, offensive coordinator Greg Roman isn’t relying on that. He’s got backs, receivers and tight ends rarely lining up in the same place more than once or twice.""   This is big. It's still early on, but adding more motion and variance to our scheme will be huge to making the offense more unpredictable. We have three receivers in Woods, Watkins and Harvin that should never become comfortable at any point in the season playing strictly in the slot or on the outside. They're all better playmakers than those limited roles necessarily imply. Clay can start a play from any position on the field.  Football isn't like Madden where you can line the same player up at the same spot on the field for 3/4 of your plays and expect him to be successful. Adding all of this variation opens up new options for our stars to match up with opponents that don't know what to expect on any given play. Awesome."

buffalobills,39dzt3,Yuk0nC0rnelius,2,Sun Jun 14 14:22:06 2015 UTC,You don't know...maybe the dude who owns the bar is named Bill.
buffalobills,39dzt3,redwing634,2,Thu Jun 11 12:28:23 2015 UTC,"If my name was Bill, I'd walk into this bar, pick up the entire cake and walk out the door. If they tried to stop me I'd say ""what? It says Bill's, I assumed it was for me.""   *edit: apparently this is not a picture of a cake. Go me."
buffalobills,39dzt3,redwing634,2,Thu Jun 11 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"its actually a wooden sign screwed to the wall, so you would need either a screwdriver or a crowbar."
buffalobills,39dzt3,dont_ban_me_please,2,Thu Jun 11 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, glancing at it on mobile quickly, I literally thought it was a cake.   I'll bring my crowbar after I  change my name to Bill."
buffalobills,39dzt3,Krunkyjunk,2,Thu Jun 11 19:33:09 2015 UTC,lol wtf. how?
buffalobills,39drea,FantasticDucks,13,Thu Jun 11 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"THAT'S FUCKING RIGHT!  Man I remember getting reamed by my non-Bills fan friends about this signing, saying that he'd never be the same after his pec injury. At first it looked like they might be right. Then BAM - all of a sudden it clicked and now he has something like 42 sacks. Badass."

buffalobills,39drea,Krunkyjunk,7,Thu Jun 11 02:11:31 2015 UTC,"I may be biased (okay, I'm totally biased) but Mario at 42 is not doing the man justice. Especially since he was number 29 last year."

buffalobills,39e31z,Silvanoshie,16,Thu Jun 11 03:13:41 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting our Offensive line to be much less of a problem than most people are anticipating. Between Henderson, Richardson, and Kouandjio, there's a good chance that at least one of them shows improvement.   Going up against our defensive line day in and day out till the season starts should help them out tremendously."
buffalobills,39e31z,JoesShittyOs,2,Thu Jun 11 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"That's the thing - there's a very real possibility that our OLs will be facing tougher competition in practice than they'll see on the field all year.  Talk about a trial by fire.  We've got at least 3 starters locked in with Glenn/Wood/Incognito, and it looks like Miller is really impressing, so if we can get one competent tackle out of Henderson/Richardson/Kouandjio, we'll be in decent shape."

buffalobills,39bu6c,Zep_Rocko,8,Wed Jun 10 18:33:14 2015 UTC,EJ is looking good O-line is still a question mark Team unity is also a question due to attendance?   I agree with 6/10
