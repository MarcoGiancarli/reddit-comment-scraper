If this confrontation occurred over social media it might be a good idea to log out for a couple of hours and watch some YouTube videos you find entertaining, or something on Netflix?  If it happened over text then maybe leave your phone in another room for a while? Separate yourself from the tense situation, as it where, and try and create a more calm and pleasant atmosphere for yourself until this passes :). Maybe browse r/aww for a while?   Stay safe :) <3"

selfharm,3e14aq,HarveyOpossum,2,Wed Jul 22 03:55:48 2015 UTC,I do the same thing a lot. The later at night I stay up the darker my thoughts get and the more I want to hurt.  I've found setting myself on a set schedule helps. I get up at 7am every morning despite usually not having a reason too. I usually stay up until midnight this way before my body and mind start to crash.  I'm also a fan of sleep aids. Melatonin is a good natural one. I was able to buy it myself at the drug store at 15. I now tend to use zzquil and advil pm more now.  It's like night is so dark and so lonely and there's nothing and no one to distract. Being in the light just feels better.
selfharm,3e0k20,the_jiujitsu_kid,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:27 2015 UTC,"Hey the_jiujtsu_kid,  I saw you posted that you are currently feeling depressed. If I was in a position like this, especially with all whats gone on with your manager, I would most probably feel this way. You're right though, relapsing wouldn't be the best option. I'm not a trained psychologist, but here are some things that have worked for me.   Talking:  often in a time like now, I will call a local hotline, which just talk through troubles. I feel that talking about it with someone that can understand really helps you vent and discover how you feel.  Writing: just writing down whats happened can me a lot too. I just write whats annoyed me, why it happened and what I wanted to say at the time. After that just destroy the paper.   Music: Playing music extremely loud to the point you cannot hear anything externally, but at the same time being mindful about ear damage. This takes a lot of your attention.   Last Resort Harm Replacement: I either flick myself with an elastic band or squeeze an ice cube. Both are ways that don't damage you, but hurt like hell! Another way I was recommended but I'm yet to try is situps/pressups. Keep doing them till it hurts like hell.   Hope what ever happens here, the outcome is in your favour! :)"
selfharm,3e0g69,braddunc,0,Tue Jul 21 00:24:17 2015 UTC,"I thought harm reduction was for people who's self harm is very ""severe"", so they can stop putting their bodies under the insane amount of stress it goes under when being injured to a degree that it needs (or SHOULD) have immediate hospitalisation.  Keeping your tools clean is common sense, doesn't seem like a harm reduction technique the same way that keeping deeper cuts covered isn't harm reduction more than it is just coping with the wounds."
selfharm,3e0g69,shpthro,2,Tue Jul 21 07:23:04 2015 UTC,"I can see you feel that you feel that harm reduction is something that only applies in cases that are very severe. After a month of self harming myself, I like many others began the get the strong urge to harm. This article here helped in giving me a couple of ways to self harm in a safer way. (https://www.selfharm.co.uk/get/staying_safe/harm_minimisation)  Harm minimisation to me is reducing the harm when an act is going to be completed anyway.   Deep cuts being covered is a great example. The recommendation you made there is by covering them up you reduce the likelihood of infection and allow healing. You've reduced the potential harm of infection.   By sterilizing instruments after every use, you reduce the potential harm of infection as well. This post was supposed to be a forum of ways to those who are doing this anyway, to do so in a safer way.   Sorry for not being very clear in my original post, but hopefully this will clear it up :)"

It certainly helped me express emotions in less-harmful ways. If you haven't done any DBT, maybe you should try looking into it?  Sadness, I let myself cry and take a nap (or laydown while cuddling my feather pillow or animal) while being very mind-positive. So reassuring myself that it's ""okay"" to be sad about what is going on, it's ""okay"" to cry, having emotions is ""good"" for you. I don't let myself get stuck in the myths of ""I shouldn't be so sad... I am pathetic for crying...etc"". Sometimes I let myself cry in front of someone, or whilst in a phone call with them. Sadness general means you're hurting and you need support or to protect yourself.  Anger is pretty powerful for me. I feel like it really depends if the anger is appropriate or not. I get enraged for very small petty things, so with those things I need to again be mind-positive and reassure myself that I have a quick temper, it's probably due to being pretty emotionally vulnerable (not eating, exercising, sleeping, etc), that whatever is making me angry probably isn't intending to, etc. If the anger is appropriate, like when my Mum cuts me off - I don't talk to her about it, but I go into my room and break plastic forks. I have a little container of them. Just snap them off the handle, then break the little finger bits. Or I bitch to a friend, release some of that anger and have it validated - having someone say ""Yeah, wow, that was so rude of her"" - helps."

You will push away the people who love you most. You will ruin relationships. You will eventually go through withdrawals when you don't cut.

Depending on your age you may or may not have parents notified about your health visit.  I advise researching the privacy policy in your location and finding out who will be informed of your doctors visit.  If you can't figure this out online, you can simply ask the nurse or doctor to explain their privacy policy and who will know your medical records.  This is a common question. If you are considered an adult regarding your medical stuff, no one will be notified about self harm UNLESS it appears you are at immediate risk to your life (suicidal currently and actively).

Fear of that judgement really causes me distress.  The way I have coped is that I take like 20-50 pictures each time I cut (and progress pics of my scars), when I can't shake the thought of the scars leaving me, I just scroll through 1000+ pictures of my self harm.

selfharm,3dokn4,kkaylium,4,Fri Jul 17 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. I once had a therapist that helped me see that self harm is just a way of coping, and that's the way I've viewed it ever since. When some people need to feel better, they drink alcohol, or do drugs, or go to sleep, or talk to their friends, or go for a walk, or self harm. It's just a coping mechanism. If you self harm, it doesn't mean you're suicidal. In fact, sometimes it can mean the opposite, because you're actively trying to make yourself feel better. I think that you can safely self harm, and I agree that there is a lot of stigma still attached to it."

selfharm,3dokn4,zelkovafr,3,Sat Jul 18 03:43:20 2015 UTC,"I'm with jelly_tots. I used to feel really guilty about self-harming  until a therapist told me it was a defense mechanism and a symptom that I was fighter. However, while I feel like there's nothing morally wrong with it (and it certainly doesn't mean I'm suicidal), its still a bad habit. Just because I'm not suicidal doesn't make it good for me. I guess I kind of equate it to smoking or drinking. I don't judge anyone for it, and I'm a social drinker myself, but if you're binging because of your emotions or if you get addicted, then it's not healthy. It wasn't healthy to begin with, even if there's nothing wrong with it. I don't like that there is a stigma with self-harm, but the nature of what it is does make it sort of ""unsafe"", and possibly a symptom that something else is wrong. Also, therapists/psychologists should be more  sensitive, but bc it was your normal doctor tat made that statement it kind of makes sense. A therapist should know the difference between safe and unsafe self-harm, but a regular doc might not. A regular doctor is probably taught to be overly cautious bc it makes more sense to treat everyone as ""Potentially unsafe"" and send them to a therapist then let someone slip through who actually is unsafe without giving them the warning.  Especially since I've heard that some drugs like that can make suicidal thoughts worse. So he might have been giving a statement as a warning instead of a judgement. I feel like I'm rambling.   I'm glad you don't feel unsafe! I often get anxiety so I feel generally unsafe a lot of the time. So don't let the doctor get you down. I hope Prozac helps and I think you're brave for facing the stigma to ask for it. :)"

Even if one starts self harming in a safe manner, it can develop into an unsafe habit. For example, some people harm while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, which can lead to dangerous & even life-threatening situations.

I wouldn't say you're an attention seeker, but I think for most self harmers out there, and myself - that our scars and wounds are a representation of how much we are suffering on the inside. I have never shown my therapists my scars, but every single time the first thing she asks is ""Have you self harmed in the last week?"" - it is like, if I didn't self harm she thinks I had a good week or something. When in reality, when I'm not self harming I am suffering WAY much more because I don't have release for the awful feelings or lackof feelings (emptiness)."

When I don't self harm for a while, or resist/am unable to self harm when I really really want to, I get really pissy and nasty and irritable.

It's just the actual act of picking up a blade, opening it, and piercing my skin for the first time that acts as a kind of barrier, it's kind of like my body's knows that to do so would hurt and cause pain which is bad and goes against human nature but I still know that once I do do it then I'll get that kind of comforting rush it brings and it'll all feel good again. Once I actually make that first cut (which is usually tiny, kind of like a tester), that feeling of apprehension just disappears instantly and it just all comes back and I'll just go to town on myself as per normal.  If something bad happens then I'll do it to calm down or make me feel better, but often there isn't really any event or reason that causes me to do it, it's just like there's a counter constantly ticking away inside of me and the higher it goes the stronger the urges get and the more I keep thinking about it.   It started out purely as a way to cope with certain situations but now it's kind of comforting if that makes sense, like cuddling a pet or something, and it kind of keeps me grounded and happy, I notice that when I go more than 4-5 days without doing it my mood worsens a lot and I start feeling depressed.  On I kind of related note to not being able to bring yourself to do it I tried to kill myself with 1800mg of morphine earlier this year. Planned it out for months and was so happy when the day to do it arrived, absolutely no second thoughts. But then when it came to swallowing the pills I had a lot of struggle actually putting them to my mouth and swallowing, took 15mins to just bring myself to swallow but then once it was done I was just so happy that it was over (or supposed to be :P). I think that was the same sort of thing again, no matter how much you may want to hurt yourself your body has a very strong survival instinct and is just programmed to prevent causing harm to yourself, whether you want to or not. It's just a natural instinct like a gag reflex or flinching when someone hits you."

This so much. It's like ripping off the plaster or jumping into a hot bath, like there's so much anxiety around ""WILL IT HURT????"" but once you've stepped over the line you realise it's not so scary.   With the other stuff, I read somewhere that you could physically bite through your finger like it was a carrot, were it not for your brain making it impossible for the command to go through. I guess it's like breathing, no matter if you're sleeping or have been knocked unconcious, your body STILL breathes. It's, yeah like you said, the most basic human instinct."
selfharm,3do8qq,jelly_tots,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:45 2015 UTC,Exactly! It's just like we're hard wired to go against those actions and our bodies fight back against them.

That way, you can get your thoughts down, and re-arrange, add, or take away things as you see fit. You are right that it is a good idea for him to know what's going on with you.  Your boyfriend is very important to you, and I am sure that if he loves you, he will be very willing to listen. I think you should tell him only when you are ready (and feeling calm).  I hope that you will feel better soon."

I keep my self harm secret from almost everybody, largely because I am afraid not just of being judged as an attention whore/emo kid/whatever, but also of the ""wtf, only teenage girls self harm"" reaction.  I was able to speak openly about my self harm with the 3x professionals that I saw, but only because they were professionals & I think that if any of them had happened to have been male I would've had a harder time being as open about it."

selfharm,3dmkcs,Sample_X,5,Fri Jul 17 15:12:39 2015 UTC,The thing about self harm is that its different for a lot of people usually it spurs from a different problem entirely and is rarely for attention unless you know you post pictures of it on MySpace which in all honesty that person clearly still needs help If they have to divert to strangers for likes. The problem with this subreddit is it doesn't have a clear goal in mind. except to group people together who may have nothing in common but the fact that they hurt themselves for some reason and want to get over it. Or have been in peoples shoes where they want to help others overcome this obstacle and in your case are either curious as to why people self harm or know someone they wanna help and don't understand what self harm is. Either way there is no clear answer its all relative to the individual s problem.

selfharm,3dgskg,pnact,3,Thu Jul 16 03:49:37 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, she's going to decide whatever she's going to do, but you can try talking with her. Perhaps there is some underlying cause; a stress of some sort, or maybe she has just been thinking about it more for some reason lately. Personally, cutting has been on my mind a lot since I've started college and have written research papers on the subject. It's not that I want to harm myself because I'm depressed or trying to cope with anything, I just want to feel something sharp bite into my skin, see the blood, feel the way a bunch of tiny cuts on my thigh feel sort of like a sunburn again. It's been a long time since I've cut but I still think about it, at some times more than others. I think I always will. I find it comparable to wanting a smoke long after you've quit, it's similar to that ""damn I could really use a cigarette"" feeling that seems to come and go even years later. I would try telling her that it's normal to experience urges to self-harm, even if only the urge to feel it again and not use it to deal with some emotional problem. But that doesn't mean she has to act on it. Remind her that it's something that she dealt with in the past - it should stay there! She probably worked hard to overcome it and ""get better"". Chances are she was not a fan of the place she was in when she was cutting and she does not want to be there again (I know I wouldn't). It's a slippery slope. Encourage her to fight off fantasizing about it and to find ways to distract herself until the urge ebbs down. Let her know you love her and you only want to see her move forward in life - you don't want to see her undo her progress. Good luck, I hope everything works out. It's nice to see someone actively trying to understand."

I had one who seemed to think I could just NOT self harm if I used all the tools she taught me...but it's not that simple. I'm also in my 30s and have been dealing with this for a long time. I changed therapists and in addition to helping me better utilize tools she doesn't judge me for acting on my self harm urges. She doesn't encourage it or say it's OK, but she gets that it's a process. I'm proud when I go months without acting on it, but the thoughts are there all the fucking time so the idea that I could just magically be perfect is pointless.   I've been focusing the last several months on retraining my thought patterns. I have a 5 month old baby and really want to break this cycle for myself and my family. So when my brain starts envisioning how nice it would be to act on self harm, I try to envision holding my son. That's a very different biochemical cascade that helps me feel and can be really great redirection. Sometimes I fail, but the more I practice the more I reinforce new pathways in my brain. The more I realize what wears me down and makes it hard to use my tools (being tired, hungry, angry, etc) the better I am able to arm myself when I see what's coming.   Anyway. I hear you. Talk to someone and find tools that help! Even if that means you have some relapses along the way."

(Or at least I partially understand one of many possible reasons why you would want to.) Identity, sense of self, everything you are, everything you were, everything you could ever possibly be, is it that sort of thing? A girlfriend or boyfriend or significant other in any shape or form, another soul to be devoted towards, can give a sense of identity and purpose beyond anything. Being another half to this person can become who you are.  And there are degrees to this, he/she could ""just"" be a boy/girl friend, but there's still a purpose there, another soul to prop up your own sense of self.  So without that you seem devoid and empty.  The point is, you are a person with thoughts and feelings of your own. You don't necessarily need someone else. You exist despite them. What you decide to do with your life is your own choice."

That was a few months ago now, but those scars are still visible. There are some ones on my shoulder that I thought would never fade, but they are almost gone now.  From what I understand, given enough time, most scars will fade away completely. It depends on how deep the cut was, and where on your body it is. If, like me, the cut didn't go through the skin but just cut the top layer, the it will fade away. I've found that a few months seems to be a good baseline.  Congrats on being clean that long, it's something I'm hoping to work towards as well. Just hold out on the hope that all your scars will fade, and that you can move on from this part of your life.  As for healing creams / cosmetics, perhaps you could ask over at /r/sharethecare if somone could post you something that could help. Just a suggestion, as the guys there have helped me in the past.  PM me if you want to chat, and take care."

If you mean completely vanish, then you might be in for a disappointment. I can show you my experience as an example: I stopped self-harming back in late 2004/early 2005, this is how my arm looked in [TW!]September of 2009. It still looks the same now, 6 years later.  You might get lucky and maybe your skin is just better at healing than mine, but there is a chance that those scars are there to stay."

When you feel more comfortable seeking help you should see if your school has a counselor/therapist. I started seeing one at my highschool at 15 and she told me that legally she couldn't tell anyone anything I told her unless I was planning to kill myself or hurt others. My parents never even knew I was seeing her and it helped me find alternatives and other resources."
selfharm,3d62kp,HarveyOpossum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:54:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! I will definitely talk to someone once school starts. If nobody else knows than I think it should work. I don't really think my parents would understand if I told them.   Do you know if I am suicidal but not an immediate danger to myself if they would have to tell? Like if I wanted to die but didn't have a plan?
selfharm,3d62kp,HarveyOpossum,2,Thu Jul 16 02:10:07 2015 UTC,I can't say for sure. It really depends on how the counselor interprets it. I wouldn't risk telling them until you get to know them a bit better and how they react to what you tell them.

Also, Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata. It starts off so mellow and calm and becomes so joyfully hectic and chaotic the longer it goes on. That's kind of how I feel with the fluctuating emotional states. I can go from ""i'm so incredibly happy to being alive"" to ""I want to cut myself and paint the walls in my blood"".   I'm a big fan of both genres of music, actually.

My boyfriend's father accuses him of not doing anything and being lazy when he's sick. it pisses me off a lot since...you know, when someone's legitimately sick they should rest and get better.

selfharm,3cvnb2,Youknow_whatever,2,Sat Jul 11 04:48:09 2015 UTC,"She has mentioned she would like to stop. It's just hard for her because she has done it for a while now, which I imagine many people here could commiserate with. I only bring it up when I notice there is a new cut (she doesn't cut very frequently) or she mentions it. She doesn't say she doesn't want to talk about it, but rather I wouldn't understand, so there's no need to go into detail, or she won't talk to me if the urge strikes, making it so I can't help her. Whenever she does call me if she's crying or something, I can always make her feel better and forget the current issue, so I would like to think I could help at least a small amount with her cutting.  I know there are things that could replace cutting and, instead of just alleviating the stress and pain, could be beneficial and help her."
selfharm,3cvnb2,swuarve,2,Sat Jul 11 05:06:40 2015 UTC,"My own person perspective on my situation: The only people I want to talk to about my self harm are others who self-harm. The reason for that is I do not have to go into detail or try to explain, because they already understand exactly what it means when I say ""I cut myself"" or ""I want to cut"". People who don't self-harm don't 'get it', even if they can logically see why it is something someone might do. I never initiate a conversation with someone who doesn't self harm, except my doctor. When those same people try to talk to me about my cutting, it just makes me feel more shame and more guilt because they make my actions/desires seem negative. Imagine if every time you eat some pizza, someone you love tries to convince you to eat salad instead, or go see a nutritionist, or have a deep conversation about why you want to eat pizza so much. You are already helping her by making yourself available if she wants to talk to you, but if she doesn't get in touch with you when she wants to self harm, she made a choice. Also trying to make a major life change (quitting) while already going through another major life change(death of a parent) is very difficult. One thing at a time will probably see better results."

One told me she hasn't talked to me because my self harm ""turns her stomach"". This coming from a woman who tells me she loves me, who says I can talk to her about anything, why is my self harm excluded?   Anyways, point is that when I need help, I want to know that whatever I tell you is not going to make me feel judged in any way. That you're not going to change your mind when I say something you don't want to hear. I want to be able to be vulnerable and not feel like I have to worry about losing you because of how I am or what I say.  On the other hand, that feeling of relief is amazing.

selfharm,3csp60,JimmybobIII,2,Sat Jul 11 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks :/  I used to like basketball, well I still like it alot. But it's quite hard to play basketball alone (I'm kinda loner). I mean it's possible ofc, but gets kinda boring after a while. Also I used to practice soccer in my younger years, but meh, too much running for the ball :D I do cycle alot, because I sold my car for financial problems. But that seems to be just so normal thing for me.   I do love running tho, but i have some problems with my achilleus, so I need to take a two week break from that.   Gaming? Nah, not for me.  Music works, but only for like 1-2 hours. And I tend to end up listening depressing tunes, so that's no I guess.  Seriously, I have no clue what to do.. Might as well just go for a walk. It's 3 o'clock at night, but who cares."
selfharm,3csp60,JimmybobIII,2,Sat Jul 11 23:54:18 2015 UTC,Ok fair enough. Have you tried mountain biking? It transformed cycling for me. I still love road riding but mountain biking gets me pumped and allows me to vent better.

But! It helps(obviously)...and in the bad and darkest moments, that is all that matters.  And there are worse things than cutting if you need to cope, like alcohol or drugs (my opinion).  I managed to stop with it for nearly 3months (the longest time I manged to control it) from february till may this year...but at some point, things are going down again. This is sadly only a matter of time. But I'm proud for everyday I can manage without it :)"

selfharm,3crajg,fireballOC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"Dude, I've been there. Very recently, actually. Last week my mom found out about my cutting via my girlfriend. My mom asked, sorry, yelled that she should call the police so they could watch me. I had to bargain and plea for her not to. (That was over the phone) When she came home we talked about it and she did the same thing that your mom did. She expected more of me and said I had nothing to be sad about. That made me mad. The one thing that finally made her understand was telling something along the lines of this:   ""Bad things happen in the world. They happen for a reason. As it turns out my reason is very irrational, but has a source. It's just the way my brain functions. Nothing to do with you. I appreciate your worrying about me, it shows that you care. But sometimes with issues like this, lectures aren't going to do anything. I will talk to you when I am ready, not when you want to. I need some time to think about this. I hope you understand.""  It worked for me and I hope it works for you. Something along those lines I think would work. I wish you the best of luck. Cheers!"
selfharm,3crz9p,sh_throwaway_1847362,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:10:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds a lot like what I do. Tried just stopping altogether before but that was hopeless and people making me promise to stop just made me feel even worse with guilt when I did do it. Now I usually tell myself that I can't do it until a certain event has passed, such as waiting until after I've visited relatives or after I've gone out somewhere. I struggle a lot with social anxiety and even just popping out to the corner shop is a big deal, so not letting myself cut until after I've gone out to do some shopping or see someone gives me a bit of extra motivation to get out and also a kind of reward to look foward to when I get back, it just sort of relaxes and calms me down. I don't always do it after the event has passed though, probably about a third of the time I'll then tell myself to wait till next time instead, so it does keep from doing it as much as I used to. I do find that the longer I leave it though the more it kind of builds up, so if I wait 2 weeks then I'll probably do it a lot worse than had it only been 2 days since last time."
selfharm,3crz9p,CyaneaB,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:15:55 2015 UTC,Well the fact that you try and go longer without cutting every time does sound like a decent idea. Better than going cold turkey i would think.
selfharm,3crz9p,Vi10x_SSJ6,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound like a good idea at all! You make cutting a reward and that is really not a healthy thing to do.  Try to not tell yourself that it's unrealistic. It can seem like it, but you have to try.  Were the days you didn't cut that bad? You did it then, why is it different on this one day you set your goal?  Imagine an alcoholic do that. He won't drink for a week. But then something happens and he thinks ""fuck that, i deserve to drink now because this thing happend"" Why did he think that? Because he made drinking an award for not drinking for a week. Doesn't make much sense, does it?"

The pain from the removal was pretty intense and that helped keep them at bay, but when I did take my pain medication it seemed to keep me in an okay state.   I also got full anesthetic and it took quite a while to fully come down from that.. The closest I got to harming there was thinking that they'd replaced my mouth with someone else's and trying to ""get rid of it"" by chewing on it.   Sooo.. You probably don't need to worry, but it's perfectly valid to be concerned about it."

selfharm,3cqp5s,TragicallyFearless,4,Fri Jul 10 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"You can't prevent someone else from doing something. Nor is it your fault or your responsibility when someone else harms himself. You cannot save him. You can choose provide advice, guidance, and support and he can choose to ignore it all. However, you can save yourself. You're the only one who can save you. Be an example. Make choices so you can help yourself better and recover more. Show him what to do, instead of telling him what not to do."
selfharm,3cqp5s,singcoralfang,2,Fri Jul 10 02:16:50 2015 UTC,"There is nothing you can do to get him to stop, you know that from personal experience. You have to want to stop to be able to start to. I understand that you want him to stop before it goes to far, you want to protect the person you love, because you understand what he is going though.  You do have that going for you, as most people who you go to for help or advice normally haven't been self harmers. I would suggest that you just let him know that you are always there for him if he wants to talk, and that you are open to talk about anything. If you are not able to talk about something, just let him know he will understand. If you are able to talk about self harm with out being triggered I suggest you do so, to help him understand what it is about and how it can end badly.  Make sure that you still take care of yourself, you are the most important.  You can't make him stop, the blood is never on your hands. You just need to be there to support him, and advise him to get professional help.   I know this is rambling at this point, but if you ever want to talk just message me."
selfharm,3cq25z,jjuuuu,2,Thu Jul 9 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"From my experience I have found that I originally cut because I felt crappy/sad, however as time had gone on cutting had become more of a thing I did simply if I was bored or wanted to feel good. I'm not too sure how long you've been SH'ing but in my case it was a good few months before it got to this point. I've read that it's because once we make cutting a normal thing in our lives it become habitual, in other words we simply do it because we can and because we associate it with feeling better, this would likely explain why you're doing it even though you're not particularly upset.  I know that this may seem foolish, but I've found that it may be better for you not to focus so much on how long you've made it without cutting. By keeping account of how long you've gone without cutting it does give you that feeling of self-accomplishment which is good, however if you do then decide to cut you feel as if you have failed which will put you in a crappy mood. I would say that it would be awesome for you to make an effort not to cut as I know you have, but don't focus on it so much that you will feel emotionally hurt if you do cut.  Feel free not to answer but when you were self harming, was it at a time close to when you were with others? The main reason for someone cutting is usually because it is the first thing that springs to mind but personally if I'm out with others I tend to forget about it but do it at a later date when I'm alone, if this is the case then being around others may have helped after all :)  Sorry for the wall of text."
selfharm,3cq25z,AdmiralMcMuffins,2,Fri Jul 10 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"Hey Admiral,  Thanks for replying to my post, your experience and insight is always very helpful.  I think that I am similar to you, in that self harm has become habitual, almost a part of my weekly routine. It gets to the evening and I think, ""am I going to cut tonight or not?"" When I am upset I definitely self harm more frequently, and cause more damage to myself.  You might be right about not focussing too much on his long I have gone without cutting. I do tend to fixate on this a lot, and do get frustrated when I relapse and loose a streak.  As for being with other people, I do think it makes a big difference to when and how I self harm. When I was with friends all day, up until late evening, I was pretty happy and content to go straight to bed without considering cutting. The problem I have is that I don't really fit in with the sort of people who stay up really late, partying, getting off with girls. I find that I just phase out, listening to what people are saying, laughing with them, but not engaging with the conversation. I blend into the background. I wanted to tell them about my self harm, but everyone just seemed happy, and I didn't feel like the cared enough about me. I want to tell someone who I really trust, and who trusts me.  On Thursday, I cut in the evening, before I went out with a few friends. I spent the whole evening thinking about my mental condition, and the cuts on my leg. There were only 5 of us out, but I still faded into the background. I just didnt say much the whole evening. I didn't cut again when I got home, but I did spend a while wondering why I am so bad at social situations like that.  Sorry for the grammar, I am quite sleepy ATM."
selfharm,3cq25z,AdmiralMcMuffins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:13:43 2015 UTC,"Do you think you may have a mild form of social anxiety which may act as a trigger? It could be that you cut before you went out because you were anxious about what would happen later on in the evening, and it may explain why you would feel less of an inclination to talk in the social situations and why you don't really dig partying and all that stuff (though that can just be subjective anyway). Because I'm pretty certain I have SA and I seem to go through the same mindset as you; I generally get stressed before I go out with people, don't put myself in the spotlight, and act critically about my actions later on. It could be that it sort of stresses you out to the point where you may want to cut however when you are actually with your friends you realise it isn't as bad as you thought it would be so you feel good then, just not before or after, but that's just a wild shot in the dark.  I've found that when I am deciding to cut it is more of a matter of convenience, for example, I used to cut a crazy load, and quite rightly so because from my desk (which I'm at the majority of my day) I am literally at an arms reach from my ""tools"", as such when ever I get the urges I am capable of acting on them almost instantly, because of this whenever I did tell myself that I would cut later on I would know it would be an easy task.  This is a minor change and it may not work for you but try finding a way to inconvenience the act of cutting, if you tell yourself you are going to cut you will be more likely to follow through if you know it will be easy to do, however try maybe putting your tools in an area that is a pain to get to or takes a while to get your stuff out of, for me I put my stuff at the bottom of my filled drawer. By doing this you may think that it is too much of a pain in the ass to bother cutting, and just tell yourself ""meh I'll just do it another time"" in which case the process may repeat. As well as this, if it is a sudden urge which tend to subside quickly, in the process of trying to get the equipment your feelings may change or you'll no longer have that sudden urge. This is just a personal fix for me so take my advice with a grain of salt.  As for telling people about your selfharm, this is a touchy subject because I don't know your friends and what they're like, but I will say this out of personal experience. I know that SH'ing is a big deal and that usually the basis of people doing it is that they are hurting emotionally, this usually means they will want to find comfort or support, as such you would just want to tell all of your friends and get as much help as possible, but if you do want to tell your friends you might want to talk to them individually to make it more of a personal thing, and if so you would definitely want to start with the friend you trust the most. Currently only one of my friends knows I'm still cutting but I'd trust them with my life so I take solice in the fact I can go to that friend when I feel like I need support without the fear that they will tell others. For me personally I feel more comfortable having only one friend that knows because it holds more of a personal touch however as long as you trust your friends to appreciate confidentiality I'd say go for it, unless you feel it may compromise the friendship. And remember, if you don't feel confident with your friends you have a whole community of fellow people here who know what you're going through and we would all be more than happy to help or support you :)  I'm glad I could be of help to you :D"
selfharm,3cozas,Underhill2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:43:18 2015 UTC,i'm sure you're probably well aware of this but a relapse would probably be the worst thing you could do right now.  this last weekend i've had an extremely traumatic experience with self harm that i deeply regret.  Try and do whatever it takes to prevent yourself from letting it happening again. I'll be on reddit all night so if you wanna chat in this thread or PM for someone to talk to i'd be so happy to help out and it would also be a great help for me as things are so raw and i'm trying to make sense of all this shit myself.  The whole self harm thing is confusing for me and i'm certainly not a trained mental health professional but i've often found peer support from people who are going through something scary together can often be more useful.

If it keeps bleeding and wont step then I suggest seeing someone or at-least covering it with butterfly strips or some sort of cover. As-long as the cut isn't causing any effects on the limb that you are cutting, such as if you have sliced your thigh and your leg is now twitching without control, and it doesn't get infected. Which it shouldn't if you just keep a watchful eye on it, and clean the opening with some water.   Its a scary thing cutting deep so you can see the skin tear apart, I believe you can divert your path to a nicer one my friend :)  Remember you're not alone Bunch Of Numbers, you can and I believe you will get to the light at the end of the tunnel :)"
selfharm,3cnkgr,Crypos,2,Thu Jul 9 08:48:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your time to reply it means a lot. Over the past few weeks I've gone from cutting everyday to like every four or five. Initially when I started using razors it was such a huge shock to me that I thought I was done. But then I got used to it. But even though it's not super deep, this one is the deepest I've done. And when I started razors it was a conscious decision whereas this was by accident and it freaked me out so much. Now I'm so scared that I might go deeper that I think it has been the final motivation for me to really stop. I'm worried about the scar but at the same time I think this will be the last one... I'm terrified right now but at the same time feeling kind of optimistic. (Just tonight I patched things up with a friend I've been having a rough time with) it was hard for me to hold the cut closed because it's right next to some kinder ones but I tried to the best I could. At what point would it be okay to throw some polysporin on? I'm in bed now but I'll check it out first thing in the morning. Probably will throw my blades out too. Thanks again for taking the time to reply."
selfharm,3cnkgr,FractalOwl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:10:32 2015 UTC,"If it won't close or starts to get angry and red I would advise getting a doc to check it out. My last deep one was cleaned (by me) and I put some strong butterfly bandages on it to hold it shut that I change every so often and put some antibiotic cream on it, and it's healing well enough. Just make sure to keep it clean! Once you've got it held shut, some polysporin over it shouldn't hurt. Maybe keep it wrapped in an Ace bandage for the day to keep it clean, and let it breathe at night.  (Does this constitute medical advice? I know it says don't give medical advice... This is kind of basic wound care though... If needed I will delete.)"

The best thing I can do for you is point you in the right direction and hope you get help and I really do hope you get the help you need and everything turns out okay. I know how bad it can feel when you wanna kill yourself and trust me, these feelings will subside, the urges can be controlled and things do get better. It's not going to happen overnight. You have to take it one day at a time."

We're dealt shit hands by life. It's how we play your hand that determines it all.  Life gets better. Life gets worse. It's a constant up and down. You can get through this, and you can get through anything thrown your way. You're strong. We all are. You just need to trust and believe in yourself.  I hope it all works out for you.

selfharm,3cksmh,bleepbloopPENIS,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:24 2015 UTC,"Hey there :) I totally know what you mean, I don't think it's sick. Some of my friends drink (underage btw so not a lot but bad enough as it is) and some of them self harm as well, so it's like if everyone else has their own dodgy way of dealing with their problems why can't I? But I definitely don't condone it, and not having your own 'vice' isn't a bad thing, and it doesn't make you or your problems any less valid - if that's something you're thinking. Sorry to hear you're not doing so well rn, and i really hope you can find another release other than self harm. This is gonna sound pretty cliche, but maybe immersing yourself in something you like to do will at least temporarily take the edge off? You've mentioned you've dealt with depression and if you've heard this a lot I'm sorry if I sound ignorant. If the urge to self harm becomes really strong, there're some good last minute resorts like holding an ice cube in your hand, taking a hot shower, snapping a rubber band against your wrist, those sorts of things. Hope you feel better soon, PM me if you need :)"

selfharm,3ckn79,PaganFrost,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:53 2015 UTC,I've been clean for a while. I didn't use amazon. I preferred toilet paper for when the blood is flowing and then flushing it.  I liked to let my cuts air out in the open and then neosporin and a light gauze pad.  check out r/madefromstyrofoam
selfharm,3ckn79,beeealive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:51:27 2015 UTC,"Hey just wondering, when you use toilet paper on your wounds does it tend to leave any paperish residue in your cuts or not (like if it absorbs too much and rips). That'd be the only reason I'm worried about using it, but I'm not sure. Ninja edit, also gj on being clean for a while haha missed that the first time I read it :) dont answer if u dont want to."
selfharm,3ckn79,CelebDanni,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"I would wipe down the cut instead of blot. blotting would leave residue but as long as you're not using 1/2 ply paper it doesn't leave junk behind.

Also good to know you're looking more into wound care :) I'm trained in first aid so I guess that's where I'm getting this info below from but it's pretty basic and chances are you already know it sorry haha  I don't actually think theres a much better option for absorbing blood than a washcloth, or an old tshirt or something - as far as I know, in first aid at least the only other thing you could use is a triangular bandage (useful for a lot of things like splints and slings so good to have a couple anyway) or maybe a combine dressing or gauze. For after, gauze is good for padding and you can use crepe bandages (salmon coloured bandages that come in a roll) to wrap it if you aren't already that is. Make sure you use a non-adhesive dressing underneath bandages and check regularly cause some dodgy gauzes can get stuck inside wounds when healing and hurts a lot to get out.  For smaller wounds island dressings are good, make sure to change them often as usual and they're easy to use on yourself, its just like a big bandaid. If you have gaping cuts a butterfly bandage might work, but its a bit tricky to use on yourself if you're doing it one handed - also if you have a cut that deep/wide please try to get it checked out. If you clean your wounds I'm pretty sure just water and a non-irritating soap should be fine, some 'wound-cleasing' wipes are good but can also have adverse effects and they sting like a mofo haha, (also not a medical professional someone correct me if im wrong thanks). If you do use some sort of wipe to clean your wound always wipe inside to out, as to not contaminate the wound further, and try to only use it around the wound, not directly inside it.  Sorry I couldn't be more specific, but I hope it's what you're looking for! I can't recommend any brands atm because I live in Aussie and I don't really care for my wounds anyway oops. Stay safe and PM me if you need."
selfharm,3ckn79,CelebDanni,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:09:10 2015 UTC,I used paper towels and held a constant pressure to the wound to stem the blood flow. The only cleaning I did was to just pour alcohol on it and bandage it. Though i only bandaged it once or twice cause whatever.
selfharm,3ckn79,Youknow_whatever,0,Thu Jul 9 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have much in the advice area for what to buy since I usually just go get stuff from the drugstore if I need it, but as far as cleaning blood away I would continue using the washcloth instead of looking for something you don't need to wash. It could get very dangerous in terms of infection if you're not using clean products. Another thing you could use instead if you don't want to continue washing it is paper-towel or something similar which is disposable. be safe <3"

selfharm,3chvrf,asherd87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:04:49 2015 UTC,"That's a difficult one. I guess the thing to remember is that harm reduction is always better than nothing. The word I hate is 'scratches'. But when I'm going for harm reduction, compared to what I normally do, they are scratches. Superficial is descriptive of the wound, not of the pain that put it there.  Personally, I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that this may be something I will never entirely give up. As long as I always go for harm reduction, well, there could be a lot of other, more damaging things I could be doing to deal with my stress - many of which are considered socially acceptable despite being very dangerous.  I kind of think that, well, no it's not very healthy, and I will try to stop, but as long as I'm being safe, it's no big deal. As long as I am dealing with the things that make me want to cut, and talk to the people I need to, then it's okay."
selfharm,3chvrf,Lenaballerina,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:00:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response. I completely agree that harm reduction is the best but I guess after almost 20 years I get annoyed that I still need to do it at all. Just because I manage it better sometimes it doesn't mean that everything's fine. My team seem to think that superficial  wounds aren't still a problem and whilst I understand it's better than it was this past year, it's still there.. And, like you, I think I am coming to terms with the fact it will probably always be there. I think when I hear people calling it superficial I stop wanting to talk about what's going on for me - I play it down because it feels unimportant. Like if it was a big deal, I could physically see it on myself and do something about it. Does that make sense?  Good luck with your harm reduction <3"

In medical terms, superficial is a positive, descriptive word. When confronted with selfharm, some medical professionals don't consider the emotional interpretation of their wording and don't mean it as a reflection of the patient's issues' severity."

Even though it's getting posted on the internet to random strangers, I still find it helpful to get stuff like this out of my head. Once I have sorted it into a post like this, I can try and deal with the situation a bit more logically. I ask myself questions like:    Why do I feel like cutting atm? Why do I feel like shit despite having a ""good"" day   So hopefully getting all of this stuff out of your head does make you feel better, if only a bit. Relationships are difficult, and failing your year must be a pretty hard thing to deal with. It's understandable that you feel bad right now.

selfharm,3cha80,jjuuuu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:41:10 2015 UTC,It's really hard to stop. Please try now while you still can. I've been self mutilating for 14 years. I can't stop. It used to just be cutting but somehow it got so much worse than that and now I can barely fucking walk because I've ripped out chunks of flesh from the soles of my feet. My legs have more scar tissue than normal skin. My scalp is scarred from where I've pulled out handfuls of hair and now I'm starting to get male pattern baldness and soon I won't be able to hide the scars anymore. I thought I was being sneaky and noone would find out if I mutilated in places noone could see but it doesn't matter because now they'll know anyway. I can't live like this anymore.
selfharm,3ci9gw,kkaylium,3,Wed Jul 8 02:59:43 2015 UTC,"It might be a cleaner cut. Pocket knives can get kind of rough-even when they're sharp-after a good many uses and/or sharpenings. Razors are usually fresh and have a very straight, neat edge. Able to glide through better I think. Same reason a cut with a dull blade hurts more than one with a sharp blade"
selfharm,3ci9gw,shthrowawayforthings,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:59:30 2015 UTC,I use to use a razor and this is the answer. Razors have such a finer edge than regular knives so it cuts deeper not wider.

Playing with the knife, running my fingers over it, etc. Something I do on occasion when I feel the need to cut even though i.shouldn't be doing it.   I think I do it just to prove that I can hold a knife and not cut.

There are ethical options:    Therapy & Social Support  Various therapies have been shown to reduce (often drastically) the instance of re-offense for sex offenders and (in my opinion) there is no reason or evidence to suggest it would be any different for those with difficult/perilous attractions, paedophilic or otherwise who haven't committed a crime.  There are support groups for innocent paedophiles seeking to avoid dangerous or criminal behaviour, some being run by other self-titled ""Virtuous Pedophiles"" and others by community outreach type groups like ""Circles of Support and Accountability"" and ""B4U-ACT"".  ""Stop It Now"" is a good resource for survivors and reporting crimes in a general sense but also has a page dedicated specifically to helping us find help.  On Reddit there's /r/pedtalk, /r/pedohelp , /r/pedophilia and the generic abuse prevention sub /r/abuseinterrupted that I've found or been referred to so far.  In addition to such support, actual psychological treatment in the form of behaviour modification (whether through operant conditioning or respondent conditioning including the ethically controversial aversion therapy) has some substantial positive effect.    Pharmaceutical Aid  There is also chemical castration which attempts to reduce risk by lessening or eliminating sex drive entirely with varied (though often positive) results.  Additionally, several other prescription medications (such as anti-depressants for example) list reduced or eliminated libido as a side effect (some without the more distressing side effects of standard chemical castration drugs) the use of which could allow someone to seek medication without ""outing"" themselves under the guise of someone suffering from something like depression, which is so common as to draw little or no attention, and has the side benefit of reducing the depression that often accompanies low libido and the social isolation associated with having a sexual identity that is incompatible with ethical sexual expression.  I'm not certain which work on women but men at least should (very cautiously) research:  Antacids (famotidine, ranitidine) can cause erectile dysfunction.  Anti-anxiety drugs (alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, diazepam) may result in lower libido, delayed ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction.  Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [SNRIs], monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) can lower libido and cause erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and sometimes painful ejaculation.  Antifungal drugs (ketoconazole) can lower libido and cause erectile dysfunction.  Antipsychotics (haloperidol, risperidone, fluphenazine, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, clozapine) can result in lower libido, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty ejaculating.  Blood pressure medication (beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic drugs, diuretics) can cause low libido, erectile dysfunction, and delayed ejaculation.  Cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates) can cause sexual side effects like low libido, and erectile dysfunction since cholesterol is needed to produce testosterone.  Chemotherapy drugs can cause low libido and ejaculatory problems.  Prostate drugs (finasteride, prazosin, tamsulosin) can cause erectile dysfunction. Terazosin may result in priapism. Anti-androgen drugs used to treat prostate cancer can also cause side effects because they are made to lower testosterone.    Other Info  Additional Sources: I'm a Paedophile.

Mindfulness Meditation is a particular type of meditation that eschews the metaphysical bullshit in favor of common, secular practices and scientifically studied and evidenced medical and psychological benefits.  Here are some links to guided mindfulness meditation sessions from the study of it at UCLA.  TheraminTrees is a YouTube channel that makes some pretty interesting videos about thought, faith, ethics and such. I should warn you it is from a quite secular viewpoint which may be unsettling to you if you are religious.  QualiaSoup is quite similar and works frequently with TheraminTrees.  QualiaSoup's video on a logical basis for morality is quite helpful in divorcing the notion of morality from your own personal feelings as is Sam Harris' TED talk on the subject.  I'd also recommend Sam's video on free will as it outlines some pretty interesting points.  Phil Hellenes has some food for thought/secular inspirational videos and is well worth checking out.  This is a poem titled ""Shake The Dust"" written and performed by ""Anis Mojgani"" at the 2010 ""Heavy and Light"" concert/poetry slam hosted by the suicide/self-harm prevention advocacy group ""To Write Love On Her Arms"" that I've found particularly empowering when I'm struggling.    Once again, I derive a lot of my positions from very secular sources (because they're equally available to anyone regardless of belief system) so if you're religious they might put you off a bit.  Just remember: You're not alone, you're not evil and you're not doomed.  We're all here for you so talk to us."

What you need to do is find the strength to live a moral and ethical life. A pedophile does not need to destroy themselves to lead a moral and ethical life.    if anyone ever found out my life would be irreversibly destroyed    Truth is a virtue. Do not fear truth. I'm not saying you should volunteer this information to anyone, but children are inherently beautiful, and that is a fact. You must live like a saint, and expect no reward. This is your burden, and your responsibility. Your reward is the beauty that you see in children that no one else can."

You say you think you could do something to a kid. Why do you think that way? There are millions of other pedos out there, and most of them are responsible people like you, who don't want to hurt children. They realize how they love and respect children and that keeps them from harming kids.  There are sites like virped.org, where you can talk with others with same problems."

selfharm,3cdg8b,Youknow_whatever,3,Tue Jul 7 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"It is different for everyone, and some people understand while others not so much. When my best friend asked so she could understand and try to help, this is what I told her. "" Everything around you can be perfectly normal while inside your head a million different awful thoughts are screaming things at you. You get overwhelmed and you feel this pain in your chest like you're about to explode. At that moment, you aren't thinking straight. You'll do anything to find some relief, to stop the voices in your head from screaming any louder. And as you take that blade to your skin, as the blood beads in a perfect line. silence You aren't thinking about how you want to die or how selfish you are for doing this to yourself and ruining your family. You aren't thinking about how your mom will crumble to the floor when she eventually discovers the scars you made on your once beautiful skin. You are thinking of nothing but the cuts that you are making, the scars they will leave and how good it feels to have no pain in your chest or voices in your head. Your release is amazing, but it only lasts for so long and eventually you aren't satisfied with just small cuts, you need to go deeper, and longer to get that escape you crave. You don't tell anyone because you know it's wrong, you know that you are slowly but surely killing yourself, but you can't stop. The lies keep coming and eventually you feel no remorse when lying straight to your friend's or mother's face. ""I'm fine"" you say, as the blade calls your name. And you give in again because you aren't as strong as you pretend to be. In fact, you aren't very strong at all.""  That, is what self harm is like, to me."

I figured I could get a milkshake at 11 pm and be okay, but apparently not. I had urges all the way home even though in was with my buddy. All I could think about was slicing up the rest of the leg to show her how fucked up I am.  But I dodnt. Haven't given into th eurges yet and remain clean.

I do suffer from depression/anxiety however my self harm does not correlate with these episodes.  When I SH i feel grounded.  I can feel my body and my mind clears.  I use it as a precautionary measure, to calm my body and in a way, to meditate.  I've never understood the ""make my inside pain visible"" or the need to SH when i feel helpless (even though i've been suicidal), so i think can appreciate where you come from.    The thing is, you do it.  And you have your own reasons and needs surrounding it.    If you feel as though you want to get to the bottom of your personal why, can you spot a common denominator?  Don't berate yourself for doing it just think about the times you've SH'd.  I'm here for you if you ever want to talk.  No judgments and completely open minded.  I really hope you're okay."

I just don't have any reason to..."
selfharm,3ca7ol,jjuuuu,2,Mon Jul 6 12:53:33 2015 UTC,"There could be a simple exploitation for this. When you cut, your body releases endorphin's that make you feel good. It's the same stuff that gets released when you go for a run. The brain craves more of this chemical, thus creating a repetitive cycle. It's the reason why some people find running addictive. Just a thought."

What I have learned is that people love to deflect the blame of their own shortcomings on whoever they can. Your husband is blaming his mistakes on you, and that is definitely not a healthy relationship, let alone marriage.   He should be cleaning, washing, tidying the place as well as you. Most of all, be should be helping you in your dark time of need. You two should be a team. Not mentally separated. You can do so much better than someone who is abusive like him and his family.

Your husband sounds like an arse. He shouldn't be getting pissed at you for not doing stuff - you're hurting and need time to rest. It won't kill him to pick up after himself for once. I'm not one to advocate giving up on marriage, but it really sounds like he's not willing to put in the effort to make your marriage a good one. Can you leave him? Or at least stay with friends for a few days so you can get a break?   I know it's hard, but try and block out their negativity. Whatever they're saying, it doesn't matter. You don't need that shit in your life. You are amazing, and strong, and patient, and wonderful. You are not lazy, you are sick. Sick people need whatever they need to get better.  As for being bisexual, well that's none of their business. Even if you did tell them, their bigotry and hatred has blinded them. And that is their loss. You can't argue with stupid.

selfharm,3c6deq,Bruised-,2,Sun Jul 5 06:55:44 2015 UTC,"Most likely is that your body remembers the massive endorphin hit from when you did cut.   Sorry to be blunt... but you need to get over the fact that some alternatives might not be appealing to you, and just do those things because it is best for your body, your mind and your health.   A lot of the things that are unappealing (like running) become habitual and enjoyable once you schedule them in and stick to it - your body wants the endorphins and in turn you'll enjoy the things that release them!"

Guns for Hands is about selfharm and I would also recommend that along with Car Radio (about struggling to find distractions from negative thoughts).   I am in the minority in that I don't like Kitchen Sink, but I would highly recommend listening to a bunch of their songs. They have a large variety of sound/genre and there are surely songs you would like.   Psssst. Also! Listen to Glowing Eyes as well. It's about being locked up with your dark side because you are so familiar with it, but knowing you need to get out/away from it. The band is called Twenty One Pilots (a.k.a.TØP)"

selfharm,3c0wao,someincrediblebore,9,Sat Jul 4 02:04:06 2015 UTC,"Ninja EDIT: Apologies for the wall of text, I got a bit too into it and didn't realize how much I'd typed.   People want help because when you use it as a coping mechanism, at first it works, and the more you do it, the more it gets ingrained into your head as your primary coping mechanism. Except over time you need more and more because you build up a tolerance to it. So to counteract that, you cut more and more to get the same high. Eventually you're cutting in places you don't normally cut because the places you do cut are too full of cuts already and there's no more room. You're stuck wearing clothes that cover your cuts, you can say goodbye to wearing anything too revealing, and all but the most accepting of sexual partners are going to stay away once they see the scars (or fresh wounds, depending on how often, though eventually it'll be fresh wounds more often than not).   But you don't care, because when you start to feel bad about it, you instinctively reach for the blade, because your brain is trained to cut whenever you feel bad.   Or maybe, instead of feeling bad about all that stuff, you simply can't reach that same high without doing serious damage. So you either feel bad that you can't feel good anymore, or you reach for the blade and start doing serious damage. Maybe you regret it, maybe you don't. Maybe you make it to a hospital in time to stop your arm from spurting blood all over the place, maybe you don't.   Maybe eventually, if you're still around, something makes you want to quit. Maybe it's the clothing, maybe it's the lack of partners who understand, maybe you survived a visit to the hospital or maybe you're just running out of room and feel like maybe this is becoming a problem. So you decide to stop. First day clean? No problem. You make it through. Maybe you make it two days, maybe a week even.   Then things go to shit. Something bad happens. Let's say one of your loved ones is in the hospital with something life threatening. Most people? They'd cry, they'd talk it out, they'd find some way to cope. You though? What are you going to do? Your brain is telling you to cut. After all, what have you always done to cope with something like this?   But wait, you told yourself you'd quit! For whatever reason, you told yourself you'd stop cutting. So you try to find another way to cope. Except the urge just gets even stronger, and you can't find any alternative because no other coping mechanism feels good like cutting does. Nothing healthy provides the same rush that the feel of cold steel separating your skin does, the feel of the warm blood pooling out and flowing down your arms.   Eventually you relapse, after trying literally everything else within your power. And when you do, it's not just a couple cuts. Nope. It's a lot of them. Just like you used to do. You can handle it, you're used to it. Except your not used to it. Not anymore. You took a break, and your tolerance went down. So it doesn't feel normal, it feels better than normal. It feels amazing. Why did you ever want to quit this?   Then the next time your tolerance returns pretty quickly. Once again you're no longer feeling the same rush, you're back to doing it just to feel normal, to feel something. And you start to remember why you quit, and you feel ashamed. How could you let yourself slip back into this? You feel so bad that, once again, you turn to the only way you know how to cope. And it just keeps spiraling further and further into a cycle of cutting, feeling shame from cutting, cutting again to cope with the shame, and feeling shame again for that.   Maybe one day you get out of it, maybe you don't. Maybe you somehow quit. You get clean and stay clean for, let's say a whole year. The urges were still there, but you beat them back and after a few months they were barely noticeable. But they're still there. They'll never go away. You've tasted something that feels better than normal life. You know that there's a state that you can reach that feels better than reality, all it takes is a few cuts.   But you still manage to hold off, and a year after you finally decide again to quit, you're still clean. Then something bad happens again. Remember that loved one in the hospital? Turns out what they had never went away. Now it's coming back. You hold off for a while, staying strong, because you know they'll beat this. They beat it last time, they can do it again. You don't feel the need to cope because what is there to cope with? They'll be alright.   Then it turns fatal. You're devastated. How could this happen? They beat it last time! Surely they could do it again? You had such high hopes, and they were crushed. Maybe you continue to hold off. You have to stay strong, after all. But eventually the urges are too much, and you give in. And it feels sooooo good. You can't believe you gave this feeling up. Hey, since it feels so good, let's just keep going. Why stop? Why not just keep cutting? And cutting? And cutting? Over and over, the blade tastes your flesh. Arms. Legs. Belly. Nowhere is spared the kiss of your cold steel.   But then you cut too deep. You cut too deep, you can see something white. Is it fat? Or is it bone? You don't know. You're starting to pass out. Which is understandable because you're bleeding all over the place, remember? You pass out, and because you locked yourself away so no one could know, nobody finds out until you've already bled out.   But that doesn't always happen. Not everybody cuts too deep on accident, and not everybody dies if they do. Let's say you do make it. You're in the hospital. Everyone you know and love is surrounding you. They never knew you could take it this far. Or if you'd already been in the hospital for this, they'd hoped you'd stopped. What if you had died? Why couldn't you have just stopped after the last time? How could you be this selfish?   Except you weren't being selfish. Everyone deserves to feel happy. It was just harder for you to do, so you took it into your own hands. But they won't understand. Nobody understands until they've fallen into the rabbit hole themselves, and by then it's too late. They've subjected themselves to the same fate as you.  Everyone has their reasons why they started. Either for attention, for making up for mistakes, because they can't feel anything else, there's almost as many reasons as there are people who have them. But eventually, it starts to no longer be about that reason. Eventually, you stop doing it because of that and start doing it because it's the only way you know how to cope. And no matter how many times you try to stop, the urge will always be there. For the rest of your life you'll be fighting against yourself.   That's why people want help. That's why people want to stop."

Bit over 3 weeks clean this time around but who knows), I wouldn't say the whole thing's from my perspective, some of it comes from anecdotes I've read elsewhere (most of the serious injury stuff, I've never gone too deep), but the part about starting and about trying to quit and being unable to find healthier ways to cope, that's all me."
selfharm,3c0wao,GwenCS,7,Wed Jul 8 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"I'm so conflicted. I put my most severe burn ever in my arm this week, and on one hand I have nothing but positive memories of doing it, being completely thrilled and caught up in the action, but then, I'll have to give made-up explanations about the scar for the next twenty years, or however long I last here. I think drinking might be actually a healthier way to cope. I mean I'm not at a point where I need to quit, but I really ought to just get some things in control. Like, I shouldn't be sitting at work thinking about how fun it would be to make another third degree burn in my skin. and plus the numb, charred out skin feels really cool. Weirdest shit in the universe, this life we've got."
selfharm,3c0wao,lifeafterbreakfast,5,Fri Jul 3 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally recognize what you mean by not needing/wanting to quit but needing to get some things in control. Like I actually beat myself so badly today that I nearly cried and my hand is red and bloody (has all kind of weird red dots on it that look like blood) from hitting so hard. That I do it okay, so be it, but lately it seems like I have no control anymore about how hard I hit. Multipe times I lost sensation in the hand for an hour or so (like accidently hitting your funny bone but then your hand). With cutting atleast I felt like I was in control about where, how much, etc, but with this hitting it is more on impuls, reflex like almost. I should probably really switch back to cutting again. But I dont want to...Because cutting for me was out of selfhate most of the time, while hitting myself is about feeling powerless and angry and expressing it that way. I dont really hate myself anymore, I just hate what my life is like sometimes. So yeah to quit, or not to quit, or to just switch to something else :/"

selfharm,3c0wao,grayleikus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"I am glad you clean it, and I also understand why you like the feeling. I do hope you keep on cleaning it because aftercare is so important. I only like the bruises and the pain when I am in a ""selfharm mood"", otherwise they just feel like a bad reminder of the pain I was in earlier that made me do it. And with my chronic illness I dont like any extra pain. Which is understandable but also a bit weird since that was why I started again (first did it because of depression and selfhate, then quit for a while, then fell ill and started again).  I hate the numb feeling, hate it so much because when it is numb I cant even pick up a cup and if I do do something with it I get shooting muscle pain kind of feeling and the numbing goes away even slower after that. My illness includes nerve damage (lyme diseases can do that to you if untreated for years, and it often goes untreated for way too long because most doctors dont recognize it or even know  what to do with it) and my hitting problem really makes the trouble worse. The nerves that go numb in my hand, are also the nerves of the lower arm, there they travel through the upper arm straight to the neck and that is where the trouble is. So basically their source is already broken and I dont want to also break the nerves in my hands because if that happens I am utterly fucked since my right hand is my dominant hand.  I dont see many people because I cant go out much, and my style are long sleeved tunics and long skirts so there is often not much to see anyway. So all the questions I have had I can count on one hand. I want people to know so badly but tellin people freaks me out  too. Only some people know."
selfharm,3c0wao,Kadamba,2,Sun Jul 5 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"It is really nice to have someone ask and care (and not freak out or lecture me). Yeah, getting an infection is too far in my book. I've cleaned it again and wrapped it in new gaze. My arm is a whole lot easier to move today (shifting positions while sleeping took some extra effort last night). I wore long sleeves and I don't think anyone noticed me carrying my arm is a slightly odd way.   I like the pain/soreness lasting. It's comforting to me. That's why I liked burning. The sting lasted for a while and I could feel the raised skin for days afterward. Most of the scars are gone, but some of the deeper ones are still there on my upper arm. I'm thinking of getting tattoos just so I can wear sleeveless shirts again.  I've never hated myself. I get upset and angry with myself, but never hated and never hurt myself out of hatred. I kind of wonder what it is like.    You can have Lyme disease for years? I always thought it was really deadly untreated. That's from tics, right? If you hit yourself too much/the wrong way/over do it, does the pain go up through to your neck and cause problems? I have minor nerve damage in my left (dominant) hand and it is very frustrating. Nothings like your situation though.   Can you not go out because Lyme makes you feeble or something? Too much exertion is way too taxing on you? There is no one in my ""irl"" life that I want to tell. I hope I meet someone who I can relate to in person, but I don't know if that will ever actually happen."
selfharm,3c0wao,grayleikus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:22:49 2015 UTC,"I dont know you but I still care. :) Probaly hardd to believe but it is still true. Because you said it feels comforting, which I understand, it is a bit weird to say that I am glad your arm is easier to move, however that is what i think.  I tried burning aswell, and I love the middle ground it is between getting both anger and selfhatred out for me, but I was aways afraid of going to far, and my slight fear of fire made it a method I dont prefer. It has been months that I did it last, and never big, just hold a match to my skin till it hurts and that's it. Somehow I have never been really extreme with anything I do to myself, just the frequency can be a bit alarming. Or atleast that is what I could say before the hitting went out of hand hahaha.  What kind of tattoos would you like?  Cant really describe what it is like...I dont have words for it. Usually I am pretty eloquent, but this no. I am trying to think of a description but I just cant. Have you ever hated somebody? Imagine that combined with anger+sadness and the belief that you are worth nothing and deserve to be punished (or to die but get punished instead). Yeah a bit like that.  Why did you think it was deadly?  I believe there are people that have died from it but not that many. The problem with lyme is, it gets into your blood, and then lyme infects cells everywhere. Even in your brain. So all kinds of symptoms occur, so varied that lyme is called ''the great immitator"". Your hormones can get thrown out of wack entirely aswell, and my personal theory is that also your sleep/wake cycle can be stunted (after I had lyme for a few years, suddenly I started to wake up and get tired 1-2 hours later than the previous day without being ale to do anything about it. Even when i get woken up by an alarm, the next day my body just resets itself to where it needs to be in the cycle, resulting to roughly 2 weeks of me being awake during the day and 2 at night. Its a perfectly stable cycle, just so impractical to manoever.)  I have read that eventually because of some mechanism I cant really explain, the body gets impaired at absorbing minerals from food and impaired at making certain vitamins. So you get those vitamin deficincies aswell, and you dont even notice because you already feel so sick.  It is a multisystemic disease, like lupus, rheumatoid artritis and HIV are. Like one of those vitamins something can go wrong with, B12, can make existing lyme symptoms like fatigue and nerve damage worse. With too little B12 you can get nerve damage all over your body. This is something that happens so often after years of untreated lyme, that eventually your illness seems to look more like MS, tremors and all than what people picture lyme to be.  So yeah people who read this: if you ever get bitten by a tick, go to the doctor ASAP and insist on atleast a month of antibiotics, and after that be wary of any symptoms (often starts with headache, fever, pain in one of the joints. Feels like a common flu, but beware of the fever and the joints, especially the joints everyone) that look like they could be lyme. Look for the bullseye ring, but even if it isnt there it doesnt mean you dont have it. If you have that flu like thingy for like 4-6, youre fucked: you have it, even if you took meds; go back to the doctor.  The pain doesnt go up my neck when I hit, just till my elbow.  If I do things like combing my hair or picking up a cup (things I use my upper arm for more) then the pain does radiate to my neck.  And I cant touch certain areas on my neck or it hurts like you just put ice near a toothcavity. Same for some places on my leg, but if I touch them my foot just falls asleep, it doesnt hurt its just annoying to have happen to you every damn day.  Nerve damage in your dominant hand sucks, no matter how minor.  Like I just described above lyme can do a bunch of nasty things to you. For me lately it is mostly fatigue (as always), muscle pain (has increased tenfold this year, fml) and breathing troubles (I cant take stairs anymore but I have to if I even want to go to the toilet or out of my house, fml again). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease#Signs_and_symptoms For extra information, but the short summary is that it can do stuff to you, you never imagined even existed.  And yes too much exertion is horrible. Like if I walk a mile I can feel the pain in my leg and back for days.  Do you know many people irl? If that is too personal feel free to not answer. And thanks for reading my rant. Edit: Fuck that was a long post of mine, dont really know how to shorten it though :( I wish I could give gold to anybody who made it this far."

As I do not go out without a shirt on, I now have VERY noticable scars scattered throughout my pale chest.  On Wednesday, I walked to my father's house and the shirt I was wearing got totally soaked through with sweat.  My father was doing a load of laundry and he asked me to give him my shirt.  I told him I didn't have any other shirts, so he told me I could borrow one of his.  I took off my shirt and he noticed the scars and asked about them.  I told them they were scars, and he commented that they were unusual shapes, asking how I got them.  I just told him I hurt myself and that caused the scars.  Luckily, he does not realize what kind of ""hurt myself"" had happened.  I am also very fortunate he did not see the obvious cuts all over my arm"

Sometimes it makes you feel so lonesome and hopeless not to have someone there who you can talk to about these things. I definitely relate to that. My friends who knew are gone now and have moved away (we recently graduated university) and sometimes when I feel relapsy...I just don't know where to turn. It is not nice feeling that way <3   It is awesome that you were able to stop for so long though and be mostly harm free for 3 years. That shows a lot of strength and you should be proud of that accomplishment, even if things are hard right now. <3 Be safe."

In the evening (when I normally cut) I just thought, ""I don't really feel like cutting tonight."" Since then I have been relapsing less and less often, and have been clean all of this week.

selfharm,3brydn,lifeafterbreakfast,2,Wed Jul 1 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"I just want to say as someone who works in the medical field that a lot of times this is just protocol and we don't enjoy having to do it. In my own experiences most do not want to commit you but we don't want you to hurt yourself, be it accidentally or on purpose, to the point of you ending your life. Sure there are people we pick up on the truck who obviously are suffering severe mental instability and do need to be held but sometimes people are just having one of those days/weeks/months/year. The majority of people I know have gone into healthcare because they care and want to help others. A part of it is definitely wanting to cover all bases, this is their job after all and could very well have any kind of licensing or certifications revoked were something to go wrong. At the same time people do care and do want to help and it sucks when the vast people have experiences like were posted here. I just felt the need to voice that. That we do care."
selfharm,3brydn,tryandstop,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the perspective. And yeah, it definitely makes sense, of wanting to take every possible precaution, but I really wonder too if there could be a way to reform the process so it feels less ""guilty until proven innocent""?"
selfharm,3brydn,Youknow_whatever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hadthe same experience, roughly. Except I went in feeling suicidal and I listened to my psychotherapist. She says ""If you feel suicidal, go sit in the ER for a bit"" Okay.  so I go in, and am just standing there awkwardly and some lady comes over and asks me if I need up and I just kind of lay how I feel on her. She sits me down, calls in the back, gives me a bracelet and I end up having to sit and see their hospital psychiatrist lady.  So they pretty assigned this lady to follow me around and watch me like a hawk. She had to escort me to the bathroom, she basically just didn't talk at all except for a few words. Nice enough lady. So a nurse comes over, talks to me how i'm feeling, explains that they need to do blood test and urine to make sure im not on shit. I was like ""I don't need this shit. I just wanted to sit here and calm down. I feel fine, i'm going home now."" The nurse looks me in the face and goes ""You can't leave. You came in saying that you felt suicidal. You can't leave until you talk to our hospital therapist."" If it wasn't for the fact I had given my address to a friends house, who I was living with and who didn't even know about ANY of my problems and still doesn't, I would have just walked out.  So to sum this up, blah blah blah, they won't let you leave until they're satisfied that you're not going to kill yourself. They have to cover their own ass.  Just say it's an accident from now on if you need real medical help, but do get help."

I think it's really shitty your mom is embarrassed of you, you should be able to wear weather appropriate clothes without shame. Heat stroke is really dangerous. I personally don't think your scars would hold you back from anything you really put your mind to, but surgery could help if it really bothers you personally. It will probably come at a cost though. Maybe do some research on diminishing scars or estimated surgery costs etc. You could at least get consultations to see if it's possible and how much it'd be without actually going through with it."

Actually in my college clinic they told me the case worker there could help me get it in my insurance. but it does give me anxiety and its not only my mom but i myself will wear long sleeves or hoodies to avoid having them being seen.

THis is really dangerous and you need help monitoring it. I would also tell your SO to come with you to get the new prescription filled so that it's never in your possession. I know the impulse is to take the drugs all at once, but often these overdoses don't actually kill you, just damage your organs really badly. That may sound like a good thing in terms of self-harm, but these are side effects that will last even if the urges ever go away. Please be safe <3"

With so many big changes going on for you right now, I'm not surprised you're resisting college. Don't rush it. College will wait. Take a year off, if you can. Maybe get a job, do some volunteering. Find things to do that you are really passionate about. That way if you do end up going to college, you'll have a bit more of an idea what kind of direction you want to go.  Go easy on yourself. It's not easy being a teenager in this immensely connected world. There doesn't seem to be a lot of time or opportunity to just sit, reflect, and be, if you know what I mean. Perhaps disconnecting from all of that for a while might be helpful. Put your screens away, sit in the garden and read an actual book. Maybe go for a walk, and leave your phone behind. Give yourself time to simply experience the moment, without thinking of anyone else- just yourself.  You've got this. You're strong."

I won't be around my family as much in the near future so this is the last hurdle so to speak.  It kind of sucks because I haven't SH'ed in over a month but there's so much scarring on my arm It's either going to take a very long time to become less noticeable or I'll need to start getting something for it : /   It's awesome to hear you and your friends/parents are comfortable about your scars :)"

One little tip I use for being a bit cooler in summer is to wear an open long sleeved shirt with a t-shirt or tank underneath it. I use that a lot in the summer months.  Scars are a bitch. Fresh cuts are harder to hide and if people see them (some of my friends saw by accident on a couple of occasions) they flip out etc. Scars on the other hand make the rumor mill start turning, people notice and keep them to themselves but then spread rumors. If you want something for your scars, try Jojoba oil. It's about £5 on eBay for 100ml or so and that will last you ages. Just massage your scars with them occasionally and they will fade.  Thanks, my friends were shocked to begin with (I'm not the most stereotypical self harmer, 6'4"", male, into death metal etc etc) but they soon got over it and now, if I have a party or something and I don't know everyone, I just make sure they won't be offended and go in short sleeves."

I laid in bed with my urges last night and went into my closet and grabbed a big knife out of my block and just laid in bed holding it. I eventually came to my senses and put it up. I wanted to cut so badly but I refused to give in. I'm glad I didnt.  Don't give in to your urges. You can get through them and you can get through this. No matter how bad it gets."

selfharm,3bl05y,jprice111,2,Tue Jun 30 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"Only you can make this decision.  Personally, I don't think cutting helps long-term. Its effective for dealing with the 'here and now', and overwhelming emotions, but it isn't a healthy way to cope.  I hope that you will keep posting and keep talking about this. I think the longer you can go without, the easier it will be to stop. Stay strong. You can do this."

selfharm,3bl05y,thegianttaco,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:52:11 2015 UTC,"As sad as it is to say, there's nothing to stop you but yourself. It's like when someone quits drinking for their spouse, the second they split they'll go back to drinking again. The longest I've ever gone without cutting is 9 months out of a decade and that was because it was for a boyfriend. Lowandbehold, as soon as we split, I started cutting again. It's got to come from inside you. Here are some reasons why YOU should quit for YOU; You are a beautiful person. You are a good person. You are a survivor of struggles. You are seeking help. The sun is shining. You are breathing. Someone cares for you in this world.   I am so sorry you feel this pain, and I am so sorry your parents are asshats."
selfharm,3bm91a,spiderdust,6,Tue Jun 30 10:36:24 2015 UTC,"Best advice is to just go and get it checked out, if you tell them you are not thinking of hurting your self again they can't really do anything, and it is best to have it checked out instead of it turning in to something worse. hug"

selfharm,3blmqh,flyersneversaydie,2,Tue Jun 30 05:36:31 2015 UTC,No need to be afraid when you have us :) and if you do decide to cut again the important part is that you made this far clean and I'm sure you can do it again!

selfharm,3bk978,22Rainmaker22,3,Mon Jun 29 22:19:57 2015 UTC,"I like to go for a drive and listen to music. My hands are busy and I can let my mind wander a bit, and just focus on the drive. Usually when I get home, I feel tired, and don't want to hurt myself any more.  Another thing that is helpful might just be being around people. Talk to someone when you're feeling down. Or maybe just go to a coffee shop and just sit with your phone or a book.  I think the most important thing to overcome this is having a distraction, an outlet, or something to keep you busy.  When I feel sad, I am tempted to listen to sad music or look at sad things, and it perpetuates my bad mood. Today I raked my backyard just because. I felt a little better after and it gave me something constructive to do.  I am confident other users have a lot of suggestions for alternatives. If you don't get many replies, please check the subreddit wiki. It has a list of helpful links and ideas.  Take care. I hope that you will feel better soon"

selfharm,3bk978,Crypos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:01:25 2015 UTC,"I was ,and still somewhat, in the same boat as you a few weeks and months ago.   I took a one week work experience course at the local primary school and the last thing that I wanted to do was expose my scars to kids at such a young age. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I did...being a technophile  and gamer I managed to halt my self-harm for long enough to ensure the week was over and my previous 'slices' weren't as 'obvious'.   The weekend before I legitimately played a strategy based game (Civilisation V) for 7 hours straight to stunt the habit. Personally, before where I am now, I used to use video games as a sort of portal into a world where no one can truly judge who you are, it released all the stress off my mind, and placed me into a false sense of productivity that eventually led to me doing some actual productive work. You just need to learn how to balance the virtual world and the real world, just as you do with pain relief drugs or other beneficial substances.  Months before so, I was on a leadership camp for a local club, I absolutely dreaded going and was afraid of judgement from new people so I cut extensively the days leading up to that weekend. I managed to halt the cutting and let the wounds heal for a few days by listening to upbeat EDM artists. As well as listen to some genres like Nightcore,  Chill Step, or Liquid Dubstep. That seemed to work for some time.   In all like Humiliative said, all you need to find is a distraction so you can keep your mind off self harming. Another option is just to tell someone your problems, ive dealt with multiple people (Who are all now friends) and the one thing that I have managed to distil into their minds is that they can trust me, they can speak to me about what ever they please, and I will always be there as shoulder for others to cry on. You just need to find that one person willing to listen and not judge you for thinking your thoughts.   Hope I helped, sorry for the essay. You will get through it Rainmaker, just remember you're not alone and to always be yourself despite what the circumstances you may face. :)"
selfharm,3bl747,arcessivi,3,Tue Jun 30 03:05:25 2015 UTC,"My doctor suggested getting some lotion or oil and rubbing it on scars. Use two fingers and make tiny circles as you rub. It helps break up scar tissue. I think it works for old scars, too. As for changing the color of them, I recommend Korean BB cream. It whitens skin (which I discovered by accident after it bleached a beauty mark on my face). I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work on scars.  Edit: Wording."
selfharm,3bl747,justlurkingaround1,2,Tue Jun 30 09:41:41 2015 UTC,Vitamin E oil or cocoa butter lotion has helped me pretty well. I tried that expensive scar gel stuff...naaaahhh save yourself the $$$. Try out the cheaper alternatives first :)

selfharm,3bjpld,glitterain,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"I have trouble with booze and I occasionally announce to everyone that I'm going teetotal for a while. It puts more pressure on me to follow through (but also more if I fail, which is not helpful). I have trouble with using alcohol as a crutch, so sometimes I need to quit when I get a bit out of control. If it's a problem for you, is it worth asking about possible rehab programmes to try out alongside your regular therapy? I've heard of people do that before and it helped them.  No problem, that's what this sub is here for :)"
selfharm,3bjpld,Runaway_dragon,2,Mon Jun 29 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"What you write sounds familiar. Some people are just not meant to drink like that (like me). I have realized that I shouldn't drink either, since I've been using it as an alternative way of dealing, and in a way, harming myself (not to mention harming myself while drinking). I am still accepting that I should, I need to, stop drinking altogether, but I haven't gotten quite that far just yet.  Have you checked out r/stopdrinking ? They are nice there and have some good thoughts and are really supportive.  Stay safe, and don't feel ashamed with your therapist. S/he's there to help you."

selfharm,3bjdmd,shthrowaway7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the first time I really self harmed was when I was 14 or 15. It didn't last long, but I would go through walks in the woods in shorts where I knew there were jagged plants that would slice my legs up. Somehow doing that was acceptable, yet hurting myself wasn't. Over the course of 10 years or so to this moment, I just realized I had been casually self harming. I have punched myself in the face on multiple occasions, bashed my head against the shower wall, punched through a glass window pane I found just because I know i'd get cut and bleed. I did get cut, and I walked around the neighborhood with a bloody knuckle and let it blood freely and drip down my hand the entire way. I remember it and it was amazing.   Anyways, back in April I started cutting. Like, seriously cutting. My cuts have still not healed fully on my leg. I should have gotten stitches on one of them so my mom said. My arms are scarred, my legs will scar and my thighs have a few errant scars on them too.  The urge, my urges, to self harm have never gone away. I picked up a knife today to put it back in the block when I woke up this morning and I held it in my hand and 10 seconds later I was fantasizing about cutting with it. I had to just drop it on the counter and take my coffee and leave the kitchen. I had urges last night just laying in bed.   Best I can say is to learn to cope without hurting yourself. Try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) it helps but you really need to apply it both in and out of urge-mode. I think for everyone it's different. My urges are here, but someone elses might not be a lingering darkness for them."
selfharm,3bh1pc,DarkAngel214,2,Mon Jun 29 03:53:45 2015 UTC,"Weird. Everyone seems to prefer razors, but I like knives. Oh, well, whatever.  Well, you're gong to have urges. I'm 26 and I have urges every single day. You're going to have to learn to figure out what makes you want to cut and address those problems accordingly. If you can't solve those problems, you'll want to cut.   I would suggest talking to your mom about seeing a therapist. They help. Keep in mind that since you're a minor, the therapist can report to your mother about what you guys talk about. That's a good and bad thing imo."
selfharm,3bh1pc,Youknow_whatever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:58:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding, I've already talked to her about seeing a therapist, but right now we can't get one for me, because we are running out of money.

selfharm,3bh1pc,dizzymage95,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:06:39 2015 UTC,"You can look into online C/D behavioural therapy resources for self help if you can't get a therapist or something! I know it's not exactly the same thing, especially when/if you're feeling too helpless to even motivate yourself to work on stuff alone, but it is an option which has helped me a bit (I'm 20, have been self harming since I was 11, but have been (mostly) clean for a few years now!).  Here is a list of resources for DBT (I don't have any on hand for CBT because I find DBT works better for my personal circumstances/mental illnesses): http://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/comments/1pu04y/repost_all_the_dbt_workbooks_ive_found_online/  I'm sorry about your mom's reaction. It can be really, really tough when the people we care about respond to finding out about things in this way. Just know that going through these things doesn't make you a bad person or a burden! A lot of us go through these things and none of us ask for it.  If you need someone to talk to about things or just to get things out, there's always places to do so! I think reaching out on Reddit instead of bottling things up and refusing to talk to anyone about what you're feeling is a good step. It can also help to find people to talk to one on one about stuff. Obviously it's never the same as seeing a trained therapist, but it's helped me a ton to just have people in my life to talk me through things.  Sorry this is really long!"

No one's perfect and we all have baggage whether emotional or physical as we learn and grow in life.   While we shouldn't be ashamed of the marks, I just want to say that one also shouldn't engage in self-harm in the hopes of someone else liking them more or caring for them more. These types of relationships, ones where the person dates you because you are a selfharmer are generally unhealthy and dangerous.

selfharm,3bcea9,Youknow_whatever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:25:21 2015 UTC,"Why do you think cutting won't help me?    It does help, but it's only temporary. It's a self destructive form of helping. You'd be better of learning to cope with things in a healthier manner. CBT can help with that, but ultimately it comes down to each individual working every day to change the negative behaviors.   Do you also feel better? Do you also feel free from anxiety?   I feel better after I cut. Always. Well, except my last cut it made me panic and gave me anxiety instead. That was 25 days ago, and I haven't cut since. My psychotherapist said to treat it as my ""rock bottom"" so that's what i'm doing. I do get anxiety. I had alot of ruminating last night in bed and constantly wanted to get up, go into my closet, unpack my block of knives and hack away, but I resisted. Every day I have to resist. That's what it's all about. So yeah, I almost always feel better when I cut, but i'm trying to learn to cope in a healthy manner. I'm not free from anxiety at all. My anxiety leads me to cutting so I gotta control that. Every day is a struggle.   What does make you hate love and happiness?   You know, I don't even know. Being back home with my parents, I just hate it. I hate it here. I hate that people are excited to see me. I hate this state. I have hardly left my house since I got back home two weeks ago. I don't even know what it is. I long for an intimate relationship. Someone I can be open and vulnerable with and not be terrified, but at the same time, I can't get there. I try though. It's going to take time.   Why are you in this situation you are now?   Got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder exactly 1 month ago. Basically, I never dealt with my abuse or my problems from intimate relationships. I've never had stability in my life even as a child. I was treated like garbage all my life so I constantly talk down to myself. Too much niceness or love freaks me out. I'm the guy who hates overly nice people. I'm glad that you're glad, but call me an asshole or something and make things less awkward for me please, lol.   But i'm learning to not self harm. So far so good, but the urges are there. Some days I want to just cut my wrists because I want to die, other days I just want to bleed. I guess you could say i'm still self harming in a way. I pick at my last cut that needed stitches that I never got, I hit my head on walls or ram my head into things one or twice. Never more than that though. I don't know, it all seems kind of grey to me. If we're being technical, it's self harm, but i'm not really doing damage."
selfharm,3bcea9,Youknow_whatever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:55:47 2015 UTC,"I know you don't want people to feel sorry for you, but that's exactly how I'm feeling. I hope you get better. No one deserves to live like this. I'm happy you're getting assistance from a psychotherapist because you really need to.  As long as I know, I don't have any mental problem, but I'm probably going to have. I feel too much pain when people hurt me and I hate myself. I'm always trying to get the love I don't have on others, but they don't love me.  I was sure nobody would love me, but then I started dating a guy who said he loved me. Of course, I felt really happy because I thought I was wrong on thinking I was an unlovable person. Later on, he cheated on me and I'm even more certain nobody will ever love me.  There are a lot of people telling me I should move on because I'll certainly find someone who'll love me. I'd like to have the strength to move on. It's hard to keep trying and keep being hurt. Selfharming is also a temporary form of helping for me. The pain makes me feel alive. It remembers me I'm a human being."

It really sucks because I felt like I was finally getting somewhere. Now i'm all alone to deal with my crazy. It's not so bad though. I have good days and bad days.  It;s true. You should move on and someone will love you. I feel the same way. I feel like no one will ever love me because i'm so broken and it's a horrible feeling. Yet, I play the stupid relationship game 'cause that's how you get it. The thing is is that you're going to get hurt in relationships. It's unavoidable. Learning to deal with that pain is really what matters."

I'm never going to learn how to deal with that pain. Cutting myself is the only option I have to deal with it and feel better, at least temporarily."

selfharm,3b8o7v,stardust_morde,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:39:12 2015 UTC,"it sounds fine to me.  some veins are quite big and important, like arteries.. while others are small and don't do much. needles are quite thin, so you've probably just never hit anything before. whether or not you draw blood also depends on where you do it, how deep you go and how forceful you are.  you're not in immediate danger if you hit one of the smaller ones, they're so tiny that they often scab over within a few minutes and can be left to fix themselves. BUT, you should worry if it starts squirting or you can't control the bleeding, then you've probably hit something more important and should get medical help ASAP.  all in all, tiny little superficial cuts aren't very serious, as long as you keep them clean. i've heard all of this from my doctor in regards to me cutting, so i'm not sure if it's any different for piercing, but i'd imagine that the vein stuff still applies."

So I wold make a time frame of when you need to get up to start your day, etc. For example if you work 9-5 monday through friday, you wake up at 7:30 am every day of the week and are in bed by 10pm.   Cut out all sugary drinks and snacks hours ahead of time and drink only water. At least 3-4 hours before bed.   No screen-devices in bed, reading books is okay.   Melatonin works great to help you get more sleepy, so I would suggest taking that.   What you're doing is possibly more dangerous than cutting because if you're driving or operating any kind of vehicle, you could hurt someone innocent. Not to say that cutting is acceptable either, of course."

selfharm,3b2djx,BPDisOP,2,Fri Jun 26 08:44:37 2015 UTC,"I have been getting my arms sugared lately and it took the 2nd visit for her to mention something. My forearms are covered, but I had an accident when I was 14 on the back of my wrist where I cut too deep and had to get stitches. So she brought that up to break the ice, she asked what happened. I blantely just admitted it because I know she saw them before, so I figured why try and hide it?  That's my attitude with most people when I see them looking, taking some advice from Tyrion Lannister, ""Never forget who you are, bastard, for surely the world will not. Wear it like a coat of armor, and it can never be used against you"".  Not to say I'm proud of them, but when people ask or when they stare, I take a deep breath and say that I went through some hard points in my life. This is the result. Most of the time people will feel so awkward or embarrassed, that they'll stop asking questions after that. If they do, they may just be curious. Try not to be on the offensive about it and you never know the results you'll get.  Note that this is about faded scars, I do not get waxed/sugared on fresh cuts. 1) It is dangerous and can cause them to bleed, and 2) At least when they're old scars I can fake it like I quit cutting a while ago.  I hope this helps<3"

selfharm,3b0po2,HylianDannie,2,Thu Jun 25 01:05:02 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly surprised that this has gone two days without a reply. That's incredibly surprising to me. That said, tips on resisting the urge to cut. I don't have much, but I personally do one of a few things, sometimes all of them if the urges are real bad.   Distract   Exactly what it means. Distract yourself. I do this alot, but don't let it become your main solution. Don't distract from how you feel and result in not dealing with it because that can be just as bad. Read a book, exercise, paint, draw. Do something that keeps your mind interested and focused on something that's not self harming.   Recognize what it does to you   We know what it does to our bodies and our mental health, but recognizing what it does in the moment can help deter you. If you feel the urge to cut yourself (or however you choose to harm yourself) just think about what's going to happen to you. You'll probably bleed. You may need medical attention, you'll get a bunch of unwanted attention from friends and family, etc. You'll have to care for the wound to prevent infections. The list goes on and on. Recognizing that it's better to not cut because you don't have to deal with all this nonsense helps me. Maybe it'll help you.   Positive Self ""Harm""   Basically, when you feel the need to cut, some people have suggested getting a marker and drawing where you wanted to cut instead. I personally have never done it, but some people it helps. As well as holding an ice cube in your hand or on your wrist. Again, never tried it but people swear by it.   I would also suggest trying some positive reinforcement. When you think about cutting, instead think about something you like about yourself. Maybe you're artistic so think something like ""Well, I do draw a real good picture of _____"" things along that nature. This is a common way to change negative thinking, obviously, but it may help you in this case.   Figure out what makes you want to cut and address those issues   Pretty obvious and self explanatory, but needs to be said. I cut because I feel anxious, fearful, and cutting brings me great relief, but it's not healthy, so I try to avoid those situations that give me great amounts of anxiety. If I do feel myself to get anxious, I take some deep breaths, do something on this list, or just breathe and say to myself ""I got through my abuse, I can get through this."" and just dive right in and solve the problem and move on."

selfharm,3ax8ph,zoknikuro,3,Wed Jun 24 06:03:35 2015 UTC,"Light scratches won't leave scars, assuming that they're left to heal properly. In my experience, anything deeper than that (usually drawing blood) will leave a temporary scar. Most of those fade in about a week. I do still have some scars from deeper cuts I made a few weeks ago, which have faded but are still visible.  Anything deep enough to go through the skin, down to the fat layer, will leave a scar.  If you're expecting that you can keep your cuts shallow enough that they will not scar, then you're right, that probably will work at first. After a while though you may end up cutting deeper to get the same feeling, leaving scars.  Please PM me if you want to talk about it, and take care of yourself."
selfharm,3ax8ph,jjuuuu,2,Wed Jun 24 06:24:03 2015 UTC,"Light cuts that just break the skin have a chance to scar for a bit, The deeper the cut goes the more likely it is for it to scar. It does depend a lot on your skin tone and how your skin handles it, I have fair skin, I can see some of the smaller cuts I did over a year ago, that weren't deep, and the deep ones are red and obvious.  If you are thinking about starting, please don't. Trying to rationalize it to I will only do it ""this deep"" or this many times. It always turns into more and more and deeper. If you have anyone to talk to please do that before you start please it is a horrible habit. Always here if you would like to talk."
selfharm,3ax8ph,dunraim,2,Wed Jun 24 07:29:14 2015 UTC,"It actually depends on how your skin reacts to trauma. It also depends on amount and frequency. If you're doing light scratches that hardly bleed, initially they're probably not going to scar, but if you're doing lots of them at once, or several times a day, eventually your skin will give up healing neatly, and just do all it can to close and keep out germs as quickly as possible. Most scars fade over time also. That's actually a difficult question to answer, because there are a multitude of variables interacting in the healing of wounds."
selfharm,3ax8ph,Lenaballerina,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:27:17 2015 UTC,Mine have been on my legs for roughly 3 weeks or more and are still pinkish red.  Pretty much drawing blood is a way to get a scar.

With school aged kids (whom I work with) I just say that it's nothing they need to worry about.  Perhaps you could put a compression sleeve or similar over the worst ones? Or perhaps a translucent long sleeved beach shirt and sarong or something like that? I guess it depends where on your body the scars are worst.

Your most useful tools in helping your loved one through their trauma will be compassion and understanding.   Do not provide ultimatums as it only adds more stress to the harmer. Stress is often a trigger for those struggling with Self-harm, and feelings of shame only work to cause the harmer more stress (eg. If you hurt yourself, I will hurt myself). While it may seem as though an ultimatum may give the harmer incentive to stay clean, it actually has the opposite effect by applying more pressure to the situation. Even if you do not understand the way your loved one feels remaining non-judgemental is important in encouraging conversation. Getting better educated about self harm is a great way to start the process. Kidshealth tells what to do when your friend is in a crisis. Helpguide explains self-harm and dispelling myths/stereotypes often associated with self-harm. Befrienders provides tips to more comfortably discuss self-harm. Healthyplace examines the issues that surround adult self harm (more common than people think!). Nhs outlines how to tell if you're suffering from depression and when to see a doctor. EverydayHealth talks you through key steps to take in helping a loved one battle depression.

selfharm,3ao1fl,rdthmm,2,Mon Jun 22 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"Hey,  I am not sure on what sort of input you're looking for - but have you been diagnosed with an OCD?  I suffered with trichotilomania when I was younger - firstly manifested as pulling out my eyelashes, eyebrows, then hair all over my body - I'd pick into my skin to get the hair out, the root. I have so many scars on my arms, legs and pubic region from where I'd dig into the flesh to find hairs and roots. I'd sit there for 1-5 hours at a time, not even noticing the time - just zoning out, completely in my own world. The way I conquered it (still have the urge, and sometimes fall back into the habit) was by stopping myself from ""zoning"" out (dissociation). Which took a lot of therapy. I think if you learn what triggers you, you'll be able to move forward faster. It's great you noticed it happens more when you're at home. Can you think of anything else? (other than general stress)  I'm really glad that you're making improvements to help reduce the damage you're doing to yourself. I am really hopeful for you, and I hope that you have support in your life to help you go through with your goals :) If you ever need a cheerleader of the sort, or to talk, I am available on here."

I know how it is to feel ugly to the point where all you want to do is destroy your body and yea im not proud of it either. It sucks having to wear long sleeves every single day in the heat of the summer, but it beats the alternative or so I tell myself. Listen I dont know the answer or else I would've followed it myself. But what I can say is to at all costs FIND something to love about yourself. It could be something seemingly miniscule as the dimples when you smile or that one cute beauty mark. For myself I really like my eyes, I may hate every other single body part attached to me but hey atleast I love my eyes. Doing this helps you find that love for yourself and may encourage you to grow that love. Well thats all I got.

selfharm,3anqz8,piggahbear,3,Mon Jun 22 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"Alcohol is a depressant so if you're already feeling down it's going to make it worse.  I can't drink alone because the same thing happens, especially if I'm drinking alone. And cutting when drinking/drunk can be worse because you don't have as much feeling so it's easier to go deeper and since alcohol thins your blood you can bleed more. It's just worse all around."
selfharm,3anqz8,HarveyOpossum,2,Mon Jun 22 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I could handle a few social drinks but drinking by myself is a recipe for trouble anymore. Im just getting to where I'm not much of s drinker anymore anyway. It's kinda liberating actually. Don't have to worry about getting in trouble, spending too much money, embarrassing myself. I guess it's just getting older. I'm 24 now and I feel like I'd rather just have one or two of a tasty favorite with friends (if I ever make new ones anyway) than getting drunk. I'm trying to get out of the habit of serious mood altering anyway as I've had a serious opiate addiction for years that's only now starting to get better."

But just think about this, you made it 5 days without cutting. That right there is an amazing accomplishment in itself. Be proud of yourself for that, and try to push yourself to go even longer without harming. You've been so strong already, I have immense faith in your ability to recover. Be strong, and remember that we all love and want to help you."
selfharm,3anbhd,AdmiralMcMuffins,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"You've got to look at this from a positive angle man. presumably you were cutting quite often before, yet one day out of the blue you told yourself that you would stop cutting, and in doing so you resisted the urge for 5 whole days. That's really impressive! You shouldn't be upset with your achievement! Use it as a learning experience, you can do it! :)"
selfharm,3anbhd,pleeplious,2,Mon Jun 22 13:14:21 2015 UTC,Have you ever considered talking with a professional? Seriously. The only success stories that are long term involve a professionals. What are you thoughts? I think reddit is a great place to get advice but you'll need to process the pain and trauma that you've been though in your life with someone who is trained to do this. I really wish the best for you. Let me know if I can help any other way.

selfharm,3amora,Zorgbley,3,Sun Jun 21 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"I can totally understand being worried about being committed, but seeing a counsellor once a week isn't that big of a deal. When I talk to mine, it's primarily just talking about what has been bothering me and she checks in to see how much/how bad my cutting is. She likes to make sure that I'm being safe about it. It's definitely not the worst fate in the world to talk to a counsellor. You should do it - not for your mom, but for you.  Besides, it makes these conversations go much easier. ""Yes, I know. My counsellor isn't super worried about it and she knows best. I'm working with her very closely. Blah blah blah."""

One of my friends who I'd talked to about it a lot finally convinced me to go ask for help. It's a lot different this time. I'm talking to the same guy but since I did it willingly, just needed a nudge from my friend, it's really not bad."

You don't need to talk to anyone. You don't even need to think! Just arrive at the site and do what you're asked. Honestly it's hard work but it's an easy job.

Anyways, if you are getting scanned, you will have to strip down into provided clothing that is pretty revealing. I had to be extra conscience about my scars on my forearms to ensure no one saw them, and that was for an MRI of my knee.   Even if the doctor sees them, they are not supposed to bring them up. And in my experience, the results were in a typed report, not a picture of the scan or anything like that.   Good luck :)"
selfharm,3akrzb,DKTFCO,6,Sun Jun 21 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"If you cut down to muscle at one point, it might show up as muscular scar tissue. Super emphasis on might. I'm no medical professional on how damaged a muscle needs to be to show up as so on a mri  Surface scars won't show up on the scan.When you get in the gown thing and get in the machine, the people working the machine will see them though. Iirc they won't really care if the scars are oldish, even if you are a minor. It's not their job to intrude unless they have reason to think you have current mental problems that are more important than whatever you're getting an mri for.  This could all be wrong though, don't trust a random kid on the internet haha. Regardless if I'm unintentionally talking out of my ass or not, good luck man :)"

selfharm,3akl7u,metalhead1999,5,Sun Jun 21 02:56:42 2015 UTC,Nobody can diagnose you but a professional. Online tests are bullshit. See a professional.
selfharm,3akl7u,Youknow_whatever,2,Sun Jun 21 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, even if one of us had the credentials to diagnose you, there isn't really anything we could do to help your condition. Screening with online tests really only tells you if you should seek a diagnosis from a psychiatrist or other doctor. If you really can't see a therapist or doctor about it, try looking online for info about coping with bpd, try some of the techniques and see if they help. And remember, if you ever feel like you may do serious harm to yourself, go to the ER immediately because it is a medical emergency. Your life is more important than the costs of seeing a professional."
selfharm,3akl7u,EyesofStone,2,Sun Jun 21 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"BPD is historically one of the harder things to diagnose so I wouldn't worry about what an online test would say.

selfharm,3akl7u,pleeplious,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:51:13 2015 UTC,You are going to have to lean into the discomfort before you can heal. TALK WITH SOMEONE. If you don't talk with your parents can you find another family member to talk with?
selfharm,3akl7u,saladdressed,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:16:17 2015 UTC,"Is 1999 the year of your birth? It's really difficult to diagnose BPD in teenagers because a lot of symptoms of BPD (unstable sense of self, emotional volatility, chaotic interpersonal relationships) are pretty normal for teenagers. This isn't to diminish your issues or your hurt in this situation...but being upset in the example above is pretty understandable. I wouldn't say that it's evidence of a personality disorder on your part.  I don't have BPD and I self-harm(ed)."
selfharm,3ajt7k,throwawayinnewhay,2,Sat Jun 20 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"Deal with the root cause. Whatever it is that is causing your stress / anxiety / depression is the same thing that is causing that urge to self harm. In my experience the best way I've found to deal with my problems is by talking to people on this subreddit. I haven't told anyone irl, but I'd like to and hope that I will someday. In the mean time I've been very active in this community, replying to other people's posts, sending PM's to people and finding out about other people's problems. Simply telling other people about my issues has helped me come to terms with them, and is the only reason that I've been able to stop cutting (4 days clean now).  I hope that this helps, and I'd urge you to avoid self harming if you possibly can, It only makes things worse. Please PM me if you want to talk, I'd be happy to listen.  Take care."

selfharm,3ajt7k,wanttodrinkdrinkdrin,0,Sat Jun 20 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, it is really great that you are fighting against the urge. Keep it up! Do you talk with your therapist about this? It could help. I think it's important that you find out why you want to self harm. The reasons can be different for everybody.  You can also search for something that helps you to fight against the urge, something you can do instead of self harming. Again, different things help different people. For me it's riping paper  apart and listening to agressive music, that may sound stupid, but it does calm me down. Being physicaly active could also help."
selfharm,3ai8us,AdmiralMcMuffins,2,Sat Jun 20 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how deep the cuts are, and how far along the healing process the scar has developed.

selfharm,3ahdjs,DKTFCO,2,Sun Jun 21 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"That is hard. Try to get out on your own though. It's kinda okay once you get used to getting out on your own, and enjoying your own company more.   Maybe some commitment could be found from volunteering. It will get you out of the house and that is what is important imo when you are struggling to get a grip of yourself. So that you aren't always at home thinking about your problems and cutting and all that.   At least, this is what helps me. I don't cut if I'm too tired when I get home. Maybe it can help you.

selfharm,3adt66,BPDisOP,2,Fri Jun 19 08:31:31 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think to say is that they're just a part of you now. They're like a big obstacle along the path of you feeling good about your body.   If you want to feel better about how you look, at least good enough to wear dresses freely, then you have two options really. One is getting rid of the scars. For the vast majority of people, this isn't going to take care of all traces. It also involves a lot of time and money, depending on the severity of the scars. The other is accepting them and moving forward. By trying to see yourself as beautiful overall, then this might be easier. You don't have to love every single part of yourself. Unless you have an ego the size of the moon, you probably won't love every part of yourself. It's about finding the things that you do like, and liking them enough that overall, it's okay. If you can find a great dress and pair it with awesome jewelry and have a flattering hairstyle, nobody who matters is even going to judge you based on the scars. I (and from the sounds of it, you) will never find any of my scars beautiful. But I don't cover them anymore. They're not pretty or endearing but they're part of me now and they won't define my lifestyle."
selfharm,3adt66,captainjib,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:11:39 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of them is pretty impossible for me unfortunately. I have the money, just wish money would fix all my problems hey.  There are probably 2 things I like about myself, one physical, and one personality side - but it just.. doesn't seem enough to balance all the self loathing. I suppose I need to find more... or change enough of myself to make more.....  Thank you for taking the time to reply. I really appreciate it. ""they won't define my lifestyle."" really resonates with me."
selfharm,3adt66,driftloon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:40:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is a bit harsh, but i don't want to sugarcoat it.  I am covered in scars too. Complete arms and legs. And, oh dear, people stare because i don't cover them. They try not to, but they are not very good at hiding it. I know that probably 70% if not more think i want attention or something like that. But i got used to it. I forget about my scars and i don't even think about the people that stare.  I covered them for two years, and i didn'd didn't mind for the following two years i stopped, but in spring my bf told me that people are staring. I think he was a bit ashamed. So I made an experiment how many people look at it. Many. But it's how it is. I won't hide them (except for work of course), because I don't see why I should. It's my body. I can't change it now. I started step for step. First my upper arm (i wore legwarmers on the other half because it was worse there) and then the rest. I still covered my thighs for one year after that, but most cute dresses are not knee-length. So tights. Then semi-transparent. And now i can go with out. If i go swimming i still wear swim trunks, because i still can't handle just bikini bottoms.  The worst is kids asking, because they don't really know it's not really polite to ask. If they are young enough you can just say that you had an accident. When older ones and adults ask i just say ""It is what you think it is and i don't want to talk about it"". Most will shut up after that.  You will never like your scars. But you have to accept them as a part of you. Damn, i hate my scars but i don't care about what people think about them anymore.  It took me three years to not cover them anymore. But I am so glad that i don't feel embarrassed and ashamed anymore. Fuck people who can't handle it. Don't let other people control you.  I hope you can make it one day, it is SO hard, but working on accepting it step by step is worth it  Internet hug!"
selfharm,3adt66,driftloon,2,Fri Jun 19 10:21:58 2015 UTC,"I just feel so guilty.. people seem so distressed when they see my scars - concern, worry, and stress. It honestly makes me feel bad for being alive. I understand what you mean by kids seeing - I've had a few kids ask my why I have ""blood"" all over my legs and arms (just pink scars, 6+ months old) - and it really gets to me. Because then I see how embarrassed the parents are, and then how concerned they are. It's just awful experiences. More than one occasion I've had cashiers blurt out quite loud ""WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ARMS??"" - and I just say, I've a mental illness - they drop it. But I feel so humiliated. And I feel bad that they then feel embarrassed for asking. Just horrible experiences.   I manage to not always cover my arms in public - the guilt is unjustified, so I can let it go - but 100% always covered around friends and family. And I think that hurts me most. I really want to work towards acceptance... It's just difficult when I've had friends tell me it makes them uncomfortable to see my scars... even partners - I understand why, but it's... urgh :l  Edit** I really appreciate you taking the time to reply. Really helps seeing other people who are ""okay"" with bearing it all outside."
selfharm,3adt66,driftloon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:32:00 2015 UTC,"That's there problem not yours. They have to deal with it, it's not your job to make them comfortable to look at you. If they can't accept it you should ask yourself if they even supportive at all. Do they know? If yes tell them how you feel. Tell them you feel guilty because of their reaction.  Just be honest with them, they are your friends and your family(if you have shitty parents who know and aren't support it at all and give you shit because of it i would still hide infront of them.)  My boyfriend told me that he thinks i am beautiful except for my scars. It hurt, but it's so understandable. They are not nice to look at, but i don't see why i should cover them. You can't change it and it's a part of you."
selfharm,3adt66,Lenaballerina,2,Fri Jun 19 10:47:59 2015 UTC,I cop shit from my family - which I suppose makes this harder - Mum wont go out with me if I am not fully covered. She says I wont get a BF with my scars and my weight etc. But I do see what you are saying.  I'm sorry to hear he said that - it must have been really painful to hear from him. An ex told me something along those lines - I didn't take it well.
selfharm,3adt66,Youknow_whatever,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:54:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, i absolutely understand that then. I would do the same :/  It wasn't that bad, because it's understandable, but it made it a bit harder for me to be comfortable with showing them, i mean, when having sex it's not really possible, but besides that i tried. He got used to it and he doesn't really jave a choice. He loves me so he has to deal with it and if someone likes you I don't think the scars or the weight or any other appearance stuff will stop them :) if it does, fuck them. They don't deserve you."

My husband calls my scars my tiger stripes. I cover my arms around my family because I don't want to make them uncomfortable, but I don't go out of my way to do that either. I'm not going to wear long sleeves in our crazy summer heat. But really when it comes down to it, it's none of their business. It took me a long time to get to this place, but I'm here now, and it is great. Cutting is my way of coping. It keeps me alive. I could do with some harm reduction, but whatever. I definitely could do with losing weight, but again, whatever. If I want to wear a pretty sleeveless dress, I will. Not now obviously because it's bloody freezing, but you know what I mean. Yes, people stare, but I figure that if it makes them uncomfortable, that's not my problem. Their opinion of me does not matter to me."
selfharm,3adhcj,throwawaiysdksjdd,3,Fri Jun 19 05:47:22 2015 UTC,"I think you should try to talk to her. It sounds like you've known each other for a while, and its good that you know a bit about each others problems.  Just be nice and gentle and calm about it. Ask her what's going on and if there's anything you can do to help. Tell her that you're worried about her, and want to make sure that she's okay. Don't just sit back and ignore what's going on.  Hope this helps"
selfharm,3adhcj,jjuuuu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:02:37 2015 UTC,"I think you should bring it up... you don't have to push her to open up - just asking lets her know you're concerned/worried. And I think that's the most important thing you need to get across to a person who is actively self harming.  I don't talk to my partner about it, but when it's happened, I just say ""be careful of this area"" - and drop it. I get somewhat offended when he doesn't ask why it happened, or, if there is something he can do, or, if it hurts... I feel like him pretending it didn't happen is proof he doesn't care? I know he does - he just doesn't want to push me. But I want proof he cares or is concerned for my safety... or general well being."

selfharm,3acspk,dark_light_,2,Fri Jun 19 06:19:21 2015 UTC,It's bee months since I last cut and I suppose that's an improvement. The fact that I'm here instead out doing it now is also rather positive...these topics have been a big help since I haven't really had anyone to talk to about my problems or get help and I don't really like to anyway...I guess it just helps to remember something positive or write about something like that so I'm rather thankful for these And to further answer the topic I've been making better choices and I suppose I've had better judgement and self control too...even when it gets hard.

selfharm,3a9a0q,1230982015,8,Thu Jun 18 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know you, or your life, but it doesn't sound like you're doing it for attention to me. If you're questioning your motives, it's probably because of something real. This isn't totally applicable but one thing that many non-binary people, such as myself, go through is questioning if they really are non-binary or just in it for the attention. From what I hear, cisgendered people generally don't question their gender identity. There aren't really signs that point to being non-binary; it's ultimately an internal evaluation of feelings.  To get back to my point, I don't think anyone can tell you why you are self-harming. People can help you sort through your feelings, but you'll have to make the call in the end. It's okay to ask these questions and it's okay to not know the answers. It's possible that you'll never have a definite answer for yourself. What matters is staying safe and getting the support you need. Asking someone for help is not a sign of weakness or that you're only after attention. Asking for help only means you're asking for help, nothing more and nothing less, and that's okay. We could all use a bit of help in our lives."
selfharm,3a9a0q,chartear,2,Thu Jun 18 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! Your non-binary comment makes a lot of sense to me and thank you so much for sharing.  I'm scared to ask for help... partially because I don't know if they'll shun me for this or something, and partly if I /am/ doing this for attention and they call me out on it..."
selfharm,3a9a0q,piggahbear,4,Thu Jun 18 12:59:07 2015 UTC,Well when you say physical evidence that resonates with me because it wasn't until I saw those cuts and scars that I was in deep and there was no denying it. I believe the feelings of anyone who selfharms are very real. I don't think anyone does it just for attention. Theres something(s) there. A lot of pain.  So don't invalidate yourself.
selfharm,3a9a0q,InkyTaste,2,Thu Jun 18 11:41:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment... It's not only the self harming that I feel like I'm ""seeking attention"" for, that's the only part that I know is real... but whenever I feel sad or any negative emotion I just feel like it's me forcing myself to be sad... if that makes sense?"
selfharm,3a9a0q,three2em,4,Thu Jun 18 12:56:35 2015 UTC,"I can somewhat relate to how your feeling. I know I have a problem and I know that it's real because of the state of my arm and how badly it's gotten in such a short time.  I know I'm not doing it for attention because the only reason people have found out is either by accident or me going too far and needing help. There's been once when j told my friend because he was going through something slightly similar and I wanted him to know he's not alone with his dark thoughts and stuff. I don't know if that was a good idea or not, but I felt like it was a good time to relate and let him know I'm a little fucked up. (he's one of my best friends so, maybe I should have told him sooner for my sake)... Anyway, whatever... What I meant to say here, was that I keep putting off going back to the doctors and asking for help. I know I should start taking meds to see if that helps and I know I should maybe get some councilling or something... but, what if I'm not bad enough for that stuff? What if I'm being stupid? What if I'm just wasting people's time and energy and they just think I'm fine.  Half the time I feel like there's nothing wrong with me. I've hurt myself so bad though and I have stupid thoughts and feelings, so there must be a problem.  I'm just scared of people telling me there's nothing wrong with me, because then i'm just a crazy person cutting myself for no reason. Ugh!  You probably do want attention... because you need it. You need people to realise there is something wrong. That's not a bad thing, right?"
selfharm,3a9a0q,three2em,2,Thu Jun 18 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment, and for this alternate perspective on my situation. I have gone to counseling before, and I felt like we weren't getting anywhere and it was beginning to become a waste of time so I stopped the sessions.

selfharm,3a9a0q,HarveyOpossum,2,Fri Jun 19 12:39:24 2015 UTC,"I used to feel like this many years ago. I had been self-harming for several years, and feeling very disconnected from how I was feeling. I had felt for a long time that when I felt sad, I thought I was acting sad because I was supposed to, but not actually sad. I never thought I was trying to manipulate others with my self-harming, because I never told anyone and kept it a big secret, but I went through a period of my life thinking that I was manipulative with my feelings.  For me, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is very common among people who self-harm, and I think it was at the root of that emotional disconnect I was feeling. You may want to look into it, but don't self-diagnose. Seek help if you think something is wrong."

I had also had a history of intense relationships and impulsive behavior, which are also symptoms."
selfharm,3a9a0q,stickfiguredrawings,2,Fri Jun 19 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way a lot but have a hard time verbalizing it. Like logically I know cutting doesn't help me at all, that maybe people are right that I should just stop being sad and start being happy because it's that easy for them so why can't I do it too. I remember why I started cutting and now realize that I don't deserve to hurt, but I don't stop. I have a bubbly personality and people don't realize I'm depressed and anxious and hurting unless I tell them.  I don't know exactly what I'm trying to say, but I know what you're feeling. It's a weird confusing feeling. You just have to keep reminding yourself that whatever you do and feel is valid, your feelings are valid."

And it took me a long time to realize that I really was. The few people who actually cared that I cut were the people I really wanted to be my friend. I didn't know how to socialize well so sometimes the negativity is all I could do to keep them around. It sounds so sad when you put it like that. :/ I wish I'd learned how to actually interact with people. I was so painfully shy. I wonder where I would be really if I hadn't ever started from wanting attention. Then it took over my life well after it had a reason to. Just addiction. blah"

One has problems and stress 24/7 from school to home to the people she cares about. Another lives in a house where nobody cares about her. The only person who cared for her got deported and she's been in CO start loneliness for years now.   I can't stand seeing the people I care about suffer like this. As much as I want to help, as much as I want to do something, all I can do is listen to them tell me everything that their going through. Once I hear their stories I'm at a loss for words. I can't believe how they've been able to deal with all this crap, all at once and still put on a happy face in front of everyone and a positive attitude. I just sit there listening and I feel like shit. I look at up and I question whatever is up there. Why does God or whatever us up there give these good people, these wonderful good hearted people such shitty lives. And then I look at myself, failing g all my classes, failing at having a social life, failing at everything and I hate myself. Why does a scumbag like me have such a wonderful environment to live in. Parents that care, every opertunity in the world. Why do I have such a stable life and these people don't.   Sorry for the rant. When you see your friend suffering from shit life gives her,the o my thing you can do is talk to them. Look at them in the eye when they say their fine, and tell em you sure you're fine. You've known her for a long time right, you can tell when something is wrong just by looking at her. Look at her and tell her to talk. Tell you everything. Just blurt out. You telling her to talk is better than her building up all the stress and anger and telling you on her own. Talking to her will make her know, that you care about her, and that's all she needs.   Talk and talk and talk. Make her feel better about everything. Tell her your there for her and if she ever has anything in her mind to come to you reassure her on everything. And one thing you should tell her is what you wrote in this post. How you care about what she's going through but you can't put it in words.   I don't know what I'm saying.

That said, I've never got an infection and I usually reuse a blade a few times before getting rid of it and it's been a god few years since I started. The risk of infection will always be there anyway and doing things like using old blades will just increase that risk, whether it's a risk you want to take is up to you at the end of the day."

selfharm,3a7r2w,deasphodel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:00:32 2015 UTC,It depends on what you need when you cut yourself. It wasn't about seeing blood for me so warm water/food coloring/markers didn't work. I liked cold showers when I was feeling so overwhelmed that I just needed something to shock me back into my body (it worked better for me than ice or rubber bands) or replicate the tension release from cutting. What is it about the SI that makes you feel better (so I can give better suggestions on alternatives)?

I think it is more of  a tension relief thing for me, the cold showers seems something that would work better than the ice.  It's not really as targeted as that.  But yeah,  I'm the same,  more in it for the relief than the blood."

Sometimes to feel better, I needed something that hurt. (3 years and a shitload of therapy/work later, I'm finally able care for myself in better ways.) This zine from The Icarus Project has a big list of ""harm reduction"" alternatives (bite into a chili, rub on an ointment with capsaicin, etc.). There's a lot of other good stuff in there, too--it was really helpful to me (just a warning, there's one photo in the workbook of scars, if you're sensitive to that)."
selfharm,3a6nab,lifeafterbreakfast,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"As long as it's not a gaping wound or something, you could try poysporin. That's pretty good at healing things fast and the 3/1 formula (comes in a black and gold tube) helps prevent scaring. (personal experience)"
selfharm,3a6nab,suicidejunkie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:08:30 2015 UTC,I use neosporin and I think it's helped reduce scarring. If you go to the store and look in the pharmacy/first aid section you'll find different creams and stuff meant to help cuts from getting infected and they usually have some element of scar reduction.

I'm in the same bot where I haven't cut for a while (a little over a year! woo!) but I feel like I want to again. Please hang in there. Do things that are fun and require you to bare your skin - like go swimming or to the beach as a reward for yourself if you manage not to. If you do slip up, that's okay too, but I think you can hold out. :) When i was still cutting I would just buy the longer shorts and bathing suits that had skirts and be very very careful about making sure the skirt portion is covering my cuts unless it's dark and people can't see my legs. It's such an annoying hassle though. I'm glad I haven't' had to deal with it yet this summer. I also agree with the person who suggested coming up with excuses now. Good luck!"

selfharm,39y8jr,Lostgirl90,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"I second the poster who said try long gloves.  It's hot where I am but hopefully where you are it's not too hot.  Still, I think it's a good idea.  As far as scars being red, how long did it take for yours to fade?  I've got a bunch that are still red, about 2 months old and it's very embarrassing, I have to cover them up.  I have a job interview tomorrow and I'm going to wear long sleeves."

I've had some take up to six months to fade though and it really is awful at times. I think it depends in the area and the severity and your general health ie if you're chronically ill or not/you're exercising, eating nutritionally, and staying hydrated and obviously those can be quite hard to keep up with for those of us with mental health issues ):"

selfharm,39sajl,swuarve,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:01:09 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you feel the need to cut man. It's one of the most fucked up things you can get addicted to because of that rush you described. Maybe ask your parents for help getting a job? They seem to care about you. Or a close friend. Anxiety sucks. And cutting helps if even just for a little bit.    Usually free clinics offer counseling. Try to go their and fix your anxiety and ween off cutting. Maybe they'll give you some anti anxiety meds to help you get an interview.   Good luck with everything. I hope it all works out in the end.

Maybe since it presumably takes a while that's a time period of focus and no stress. Cutting is the same but it takes a lot of cuts to stay in that mental state for very long. Also I sometimes tell myself stuff like ""well I would really rather not bother"" too when i want to avoid people and such, even though I really do want to."

selfharm,39rn7v,SnooSnooCookie,2,Sun Jun 14 10:16:34 2015 UTC,"I think my SH perhaps started with ingrown toenails.  When I was a kid I would get ingrown toenails from time to time.  I was really ashamed to tell my parents so I would try to cut or pull the nail off to fix it.  I was successful some of the time, but it would often take me weeks to either fix a toenail, or finally tell my parents.  So it would be weeks of considerable pain, which I just came to live with.  This was years before I really got into 'self harm' as I would call it but I could definitely see this as one of my earlier memories of being in pain and oddly okay with it.  I still have problems with my toenails, and I have 2 toenails medically removed.  And I'm pretty sure I've damaged the root of a few other nails.  And cutting nails often is a bloody affair for me."
selfharm,39rn7v,aimark42,2,Sun Jun 14 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know your question, but I'm going to respond lol..  I think you'd said everything you need.  ""I don't feel like another drug could do anything different"" - may or may not be the case. I know some people who took 2-3 different anti-depressants before they found the right one. I don't take meds full time because my sedatives just numb me out to everything, so I can't really say from personal experience.  The intrusive thoughts are a struggle to deal with every day, but it's a grind most people go through - just some have them a lot more frequently. If you're having difficulties with handling them, I think the best way to combat it is to self-soothe and self validation.  ""I feel like I need to make actual changes to my lifestyle."" You're right. But it takes a lot of effort and a lot of internal willpower. Only when you feel ready, and when you feel you need the change is when you can move forward regarding that. I wouldn't go it alone though, do you have any support? Like a psychologist? They are pretty good with that stuff."

They may have even gotten a glimpse of your scars or cuts and known not to ask. Or, if you are female, they may have just thought you were on your period, and didn't want to make you uncomfortable by asking. It might be just that simple. When I was younger (before I first cut myself), I used to skip swim practice (I swam competitively) when I was on my period, before I discovered the joy of tampons.

I want them to ask what's the matter but I don't want to have to give the honest answer. I feel like i'm digging myself into a hole that is deep and dark and alone and it's my own doing.

It will heal without it, but may stay open for a few weeks while it does so, and the scar will be wider if not taped.  Take care Knyburg, and hang in there"

Ask her if anything is bothering her, or if she has been okay recently. Those questions aren't too intrusive and she can either start talking about it then, or if she doesn't want to talk about it well best not to force it out of her, but let her know its always better to talk about it and to have someone always there to listen and help, and not shut her down, ever."
selfharm,39kpae,Miss_Mechanical,2,Sat Jun 13 06:17:39 2015 UTC,"I would let her lead the conversation when you guys get a chance to talk. I know it seems different to let her be the one who does the talking, but it will help her. As someone who self-harms and struggles a lot with it, all I was is someone to talk to, but amongst my friends and family I have no one to talk to, only people on here. Just tell her  she can tell you anything and that you're there for her and that you want her to be able to talk to you about things that are bothering her."

It's not very common for people with schizophrenia to put themselves in the hospital for mental health treatment unless they have a lot of family support and are used to recognizing their symptoms. It's his family's responsibility to make sure he is getting adequate care, and they're pretending he doesn't have delusions/hallucinations so...there's really not a lot of hope there. I'm not really actively working on getting better or anything, not at the moment. Last summer I went cold turkey on cutting and that was hard.

BDSM knife play, etc. Also, if you've already stopped (just scars leftover) you can use silicone-based hair gel to fade them, or you can doodle over them. I like the thornbush idea, especially if you live in a place where blackberries or other fruit-bearing thornbushes grow, you have a reasonable excuse to messing around in thornbushes (blackberries are worth it). You could also poke around in your local hardware store and look for some tools that have reasonable accident probability, and say that as an excuse. You might also say you were trying to whittle something, but them they might ask to see what you made, and if you dont know how to whittle then you're screwed. Good luck."

I'm sorry things are hard and I know it's difficult and sometimes you'll feel hopeless and stuck. But the thing is... Self-harm will NOT solve all your problems.  I found a good way to deal with self-harm and that is exercise :)  Scars only make you uglier and your partner will probably find that even more unattractive. So just try doing more psychical things and try and build yourself even though you might break down a little.  I promise you things will get better as long as you don't self harm, there are so many healthier options.  You should open up your eyes and see."

Are you able to talk to them before you find out they self harm? If yes then why does finding out they do suddenly change your perception of them? They're still the same person.  Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to ask for advice on this. Asking a bunch of people you feel uncomfortable talking to and that drive you insane is really the last place you should be getting help."
selfharm,39j8fs,HarveyOpossum,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:15:39 2015 UTC,Its more of a vivacious sense of feeling when I see it or realise it is when it happens to me. I notice alot of things about people when I see them or are near them and its hard for me to break the habit of focusing on it. Whenever I get the feeling my nerves light up like I am feeling it myself
selfharm,39j8fs,Bxrwheel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"People do it for many reasons. Sometimes it's a form of gratification, sometimes it is self destruction.  For me at least, the best way I can describe the feeling, it's like scratching a really really really itchy itch.   The best thing to do is not deny it. That's part of growing up, you will run into things you are not going to want to see or know, the world can be sick. My best advice on dealing with life is to understand it's not flowers and bubblegum.  Once you move past that, understand that each person does it for different reasons. If someone is hurting, you shouldn't make them feel that their pain isn't real. I guess that's the real reason I harm myself. When I'm upset, i get an unbearable headache and it feels like I can't hear the world for my life. Cutting brings me back, and it helps me stay with reality. It relieves my ""headache"". My physical pain is something I can deal with, but my mind? That incredible brain of ours does incredible things, and also makes problems incredible to experience.  It is generally done for unhealthy reasons, and you should not suffer yourself to allow it to drag you down. As before, my best advice is to accept that the world isn't sunshine and kisses, it won't be easy at first, especially if you had experienced a somewhat sheltered lifestyle. Some people don't want help, unfortunately only we can really help ourselves. The most people really need, at least for  me, is a push forward.   No one wants to admit that something's wrong, but when you harm yourself, asking for help can be the most difficult thing in the world. You must show that you can give that person your full confidence, you must vocalize it. The biggest problem I faced is telling someone, because I knew it was crazy. It's difficult to admit to a ""normal"" human being what you are doing, because some people's reactions only makes everything a cluster fuck of complications.  Always use your best judgement, everyone is different, but mostly we are people suffering, and we need that push to get us started to recovery.    I feel cutting should be treated with an AA (Alcoholics Anonoymous) attitude. Definitely pick up what they call the ""Big Book"". It's free to those who seek its advice. For a person like me, Support and the knowledge you are not alone are the best motivators, finding places safe for venting are a must.  As it is common practice in the rooms, much like addicts, it is impossible to become full fledged ""recovered"", that attitude will only make us disappoint ourselves and others, but one day at a time, turns into weeks, months, and years."

Assure him that you are reaching out as a step to prevent yourself from internalizing these feelings. Let him know that you appreciate his friendship and that's all you're looking for.  Friends freak out and run sometimes not because they're mad or disgusted or think you're a freak. They're scared because they worry that knowing your secret makes them responsible for you, and if anything happens or if you hurt yourself (or worse), that it will be their fault.  Make it clear that you appreciate the emotional support and that you may relapse and you may have your ups and downs but you take full responsibility for it.. but just having someone know makes it a little bit easier.

Thanks for sharing. I think you'll find a lot of people here who do understand the struggles that our relationships with others can hold, you're not alone with that. It's not easy, those feelings... Personally, I'd find myself shutting down a lot emotionally, and cutting would be a huge relief and would help me feel, yeah? It's a little different for everyone, but there are similarities too. You're not alone in this - we're here for ya.   Who is it that you'd be hurting by cutting? Who have you told about it? I hole you don't mind me asking, I just always want to hear more, and give you the space and opportunity to speak without judgment.   When your girlfriend goes to uni, are you going to keep in touch with her? Or is the plan to end the relationship? And have you talked to her about the anxiety and how you feel about this all?  I hope you can hold out for a little longer and keep talking here. You have a situation with two pretty intense options you've laid out, but I think there's more to it. And I wanna help.

All in all I know they would all be disappointed, it's been 8 months :/ but it's like I hit a wall.

It can be a little difficult, having to take in everyone's stories. But at the same time, it's good to hear, to listen, and to realize that we all have our struggles, none any better or worse than the other, all just real, honest, and present.  Ahh, the mutual ending of the relationship, though it sounds like it's hitting you hard. How'd she take it, do you know? I thin, personally, that it's really strong of you to agree to this. It's not easy, but you care enough to let her go through with this. It shows a lot of your character, and though it's painful, I hope you can appreciate (as I do) the part of you that has agreed to go through with this.  I'm glad to hear that your friends understand! With the counseling, though, how did that go? Did you learn anything about yourself? I always feel we can learn more about ourselves through everything, even if we don't like our situations.   It's been 8 months since you've last self-harmed? If anything, that sounds great to me. I mean, perhaps they don't understand personally what self-harm is like, but I deal with the temptation all the time, I work with a lot of tools I could use to hurt myself. I even gave away all my knifes only to be given a new utility knife at my job that I'm supposed to keep with me, bring home, bring to work... It's just awkwardly ironic that that would happen.  So, did you make it through last night? And hopefully tonight? I'm glad you got a chance to respond so soon, but I apologize for not getting back to you sooner than now.

Its helps:) counselling was a bit to much for me, although finding out about myself and having someone lay it out for me, without me being able to ignore it was probably good for me, it was hard. Example being that I find it really hard to see why people would like me/ take compliments, and generally low self esteem are probably down to my Dad leaving when I was younger, someone who brought me into this world decided he didn't want to be with us and left, that kinda hit me hard.  Im a little proud of it :) although, part of me misses the scars now they are starting to fade. Oh god :( how do you do it? sounds like you have a lot of self control.

I'd expected it to feel good, like a giant release, a huge rush of endorphins, but honestly, it was so disappointing and anticlimactic. I had to ""train"" myself to think of it as something positive, i.e. forcing myself to do it again and lying to myself that it felt good and that I liked it, until gradually it became the truth. That was one of the dumbest things I ever did. Right now you are at the best place to stop self-harming before it gets bad. I mean, you are so lucky that it does nothing for you right now.

selfharm,39aaug,itsathrowawayforreal,17,Wed Jun 10 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine how horrified and terrified you must be feeling.  When I began self harming, I had a very poor relationship with my parents, and no one to talk to about what I was feeling. Moreso, even when I tried to open up, my feelings were completely invalidated. I had almost no language to describe what was going on in my head, which only made matters worse.  Cutting is for me what drugs and alcohol are for others. It is an escape. It makes me feel better - SO much better. It silences the negativity in my head that makes me feel useless, worthless, not good enough.  If you want your daughter to trust you, do not respond to her cutting with anger, contempt or dismissal. Do not let her see the disappointment if possible. Absolutely do not make her promise to stop, force her to stop or take away her tools. She will only find other, better, more secret ways to do it, and your communication link will be severed permanently.  Do respond to her calmly with love and concern. Ask her what was going through her mind just before she cut, and if she is aware of any triggers. Try not to make a big deal of it. Ask if she would be okay showing you her cuts after she has made them. Make sure you emphasise that this is not because you want to judge her, you just want to make sure she is caring for her wounds appropriately. If she's not okay with showing you, just keep her supplied with first aid requirements, so she can feel that you care about her safety.  Definitely encourage a therapist. And if she doesn't like that one, find another. Keep trying new ones until she finds one she likes and connects with.  Educate yourself. There are a multitude of books and websites on self harm around these days, and professionals understand it far better now than when I started.  Best of luck :-) feel free to PM me any time, and I will get back to you as soon as I can."
selfharm,39aaug,Lenaballerina,8,Wed Jun 10 12:00:02 2015 UTC,"If you want your daughter to trust you, do not respond to her cutting with anger, contempt or dismissal.   This cannot be stressed enough. I'm really close with my mom, but when she found out about my cutting nearly ten years ago she had a really negative reaction and to this day I don't trust her to talk about it and she thinks I've been clean for years. Things like ultimatums, forcing help, taking tools away, etc. won't help your daughter at all but most likely just teach her to be better at lying and hiding.  The fact that you're here asking for advice makes me think you won't act that way, but it's something to keep in mind."
selfharm,39aaug,HarveyOpossum,2,Wed Jun 10 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"Came here to reinforce this.

selfharm,39aaug,Single-Use_Account,3,Wed Jun 10 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"I remember telling my Dad about my cutting was one of the hardest things I every did. He reacted as well as he anyone could expect. Just feel special that she came out and told you when you asked. I would recommend a therapist. But, as someone who still sometimes struggles with self harm, I can tell you that the only way she is going to stop is if she decides to stop. So regardless of if you get angry, yell, cry, whatever, it basically doesn't matter. Try to remember that for the future. You want to maintain that open relationship. I know if my parents got angry at her cutting, upset, sad, it wouldn't help me. Although it its taboo and not the best coping mechanism if its not life threatening I wouldn't focus too much on the actual cuts themselves. You have to get to the core of why she is doing it and discuss that. Only after she analyzed why she is cutting and other ways to cope with those feelings will she start to want to stop."
selfharm,39aaug,standstilllookpretty,3,Wed Jun 10 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"It's awesome that you're seeking knowledge about self-harm while being your daughter's support in this. As you've read, you're starting from a much better place than some of our families and friends. My most heartfelt advice to you (in no way disrespectful or smart-ass)...find yourself a therapist, too. And not the same one. This is SUCH a difficult issue and understanding WHY at this point is going to be nearly impossible for your daughter, much less for you. As her mom, it's going to be SO hard for you to not to get caught up in this emotionally...because you care! But even sincere, good intended emotions can be dangerous here. A therapist can be hugely helpful to you, both as someone to help you process this as a mom, and to provide professional insight on this or other issues at play. I could give a dozen reasons a therapist could help you, but just as important...it'll help your daughter. What better way to affirm her ""treatment"" than to go through it yourself. You seeking help (even if it's only for her benefit) says that it's ok to be affected by whatever you've all gone through the last 2 years and to find healthy ways to cope. I'm not a professional, but I'm making this journey, too. Good luck."
selfharm,39aaug,notnefarious,2,Wed Jun 10 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"Lots of different reasons. I cut because the emotional pain was too overwhelming and the only release that felt appropriate was to cut. Nothing I have ever done since trying to get better has given me the same relief. It feels amazing, but it's so bad for you."
selfharm,39aaug,Youknow_whatever,2,Wed Jun 10 11:33:52 2015 UTC,"Its nice you found her someone to talk to. My parents found out, knew for years, never told me they knew, and did nothing to help. I didn't see a dr until after attempting suicide in my college dorm. I was forced to go or be kicked out of my dorm and my school. I told them after another visit to the er, this time for stitches from cutting. No response. Years later my stepmom makes some backhanded comment to me about it, revealing they'd known all along (started when I was 12). That shocked and hurt me A LOT. Still resent them for their refusal to help me, so you're already leagues ahead in that regard. I didn't understand my own selfharm until well into my 20s, after years of seeing mental health professionals."
selfharm,39aaug,singcoralfang,2,Wed Jun 10 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"So for me it was all about internalizing pain. In my scenario it was an abusive family situation where showing weakness or trying to tell anyone would only make me a target for abuse. Later in relationships it became more of a wanting to internalize it so as not to take out my problems on others. Or a sense of shame that I always felt like I had no control over my situation or my emotions.  It became a coping mechanism that was akin to the immediate satisfaction of sex or drugs- everything else faded away and there was this one focus that was the only thing. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, and it wasn't numb. I felt something and I had control over it and it was simple and it was pure. And it was destructive and horrifying after that spun me back into the same cycle over and over.  You wanting to understand it is admirable and wonderful to hear, but please brace yourself to know that you will probably never fully understand it, and that's ok. It's good, even. It's more important that she understands why you've never considered it- you have other tools to cope with emotional pain, and seeing a therapist will help her gain those tools, too. Try not to dwell on where she is, and just help be a guide to where she needs to get to.  Thank you for caring enough to get her help and reach out to try to understand. You may find it a weird thing to say, after all she's your child and of course you care, but there are so many parents out there who never care enough to notice or who ignore it and convince themselves there's nothing wrong."
selfharm,39aaug,brokenboomerang,2,Thu Jun 11 02:36:50 2015 UTC,"For me personally, there are only two reasons.   The first is that I seem to always have a need to sabotage my body in some way. It used to be an eating disorder, but when I got over that, I realized I needed a new reckless 'hobby', so I put my effort/discipline into cutting myself instead. I don't enjoy the pain, nor does it make me feel 'good', but I just enjoy damaging myself.   The second reason is that I have no self esteem, so when I look down in private and see scars all over my left thigh, I can't help but feel 'strong' and tough, like maybe I'm too pathetic to make friends or find a job, but hey, I can handle pain on a regular basis and I have the scars to prove it. That's where I get my teeny fragment of self esteem.  Every now and then I 'accidentally' get slack on hiding my box cutter/razor blades etc, hoping that maybe my mom or sister will find them and reach out to try to help me. But they never do."
selfharm,39aaug,blue_coral_green,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:40:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, make sure to never blame yourself, because it'll just be a downward spiral for you. Understand that she has some issues going on and she really just needs your support. Don't constantly bother her, just check in sometimes, if possible, just bring her out for ice cream or surprise her with something small but nice. The gesture and effort saying that you're always there for her will help her so much.  Now, to answer your question, I don't 100% know why I cut. I've been doing it for 5 years now. Most people don't have a 100% answer as to of why they do it, so make sure to never pressure an answer out of your daughter. Just talk with her casually. Never pressure her and make her upset. A lot of people, including myself, cut to distract from other pain. I cut to also bring myself back into reality. It may not make any sense to you, but it does to a large amount of people. Make sure to encourage that your daughter continues to seek therapy, but make sure she is comfortable with the therapist because other wise it'll just be counter productive.   I wish you and your daughter the best. If you have any further questions or anything feel free to message or reply to me! xo"
selfharm,39aaug,benbecdav,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:48:41 2015 UTC,"To better understand it, I would suggest sitting down with her and telling her she can tell you anything and talk to you about anything. Just convey to her that you're there for her and that you love her with all your heart. That's all I want. I just want someone to talk to face to face, who understands my problems. I have friends who I know I could do this with , but I don't have the courage to tell them."
selfharm,39aaug,metalhead1999,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:16:47 2015 UTC,It's good that you asked her. I know it's scary but don't show her you're scared or panicking. And don't treat her like she's dying. Carry on like normal but just do a little extra to be there for her without getting too much into her space and never creep up on her.  And also ask her to explain how she feels and then you can tell her how you feel about the situation too :)  Oh and ask if she would like to go to a doctor or therapy. (I got forced and it wasn't nice)
selfharm,39aaug,Jinxed_Luck,0,Fri Jun 12 08:26:27 2015 UTC,"For me, understanding the physical and psychological effects of cutting helped me to understand the action as a whole.   When we get physically hurt, the body releases endorphins to help deal with the pain. When one self-harms, you're forcing your brain release these endorphins to deal with psychological pain. The person who is self-harming is often very dissociated from these actions--they aren't fully present in the moment because they're so upset. So if I had to guess, your daughter is doing this because it's a fast and addictive way to relieve anguish. It's a very difficult habit to break, because traditional and safe ways of dealing with psychological pain aren't as powerful and quick (talking things out doesn't feel as good as a big rush of endorphins).  So if I were to try to put the situation together, I would say that your daughter is having a hard time dealing with her emotions, and she found a habit that provides quick and addictive relief.   If I were in your position, I would try to help her to develop less harmful ways of dealing with the pain. Going to a therapist is a great start, as long as she's intent on getting better. If you can, I would talk to her and tell her that you want to help her find ways of feeling better that don't cause damage like that. Depending on what she's going through, there are things that might help her to feel better. I know for me, a way to replicate that rush of endorphins is to go for a hard run (runner's high is similar to self-harm high). Hopefully her therapist will help her to develop tools or methods of self-soothing that aren't harmful."

selfharm,39b5w0,AdmiralMcMuffins,2,Wed Jun 10 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"There's nothing trivial about this at all. I'm going through a similar situation with my AS exams at the moment. I know how awful it can feel to have the pressures of exams adding to issues with self harm.  I'm sure you are aware of some of the options you have: resitting the year, retaking exams etc. You will be able to get the uni choices that you want. You might be lucky, and get the results that you need straight away.  The transition between a-levels and uni is a very difficult one. I'm sure you feel that you have a lot of expectations to live up to. The best thing you can do is try your best for your remaining exams, and put off worrying about the bad ones until results day. Once that day comes, you can put together an action plan for how you can get into the uni you want.  Remember that you're not the only one who will be feeling like this. Your teachers at school and tutor (if you have one) will be able to give you advice and support, so it might be worth discussing this with one of them.  We've PM'd in the past, so feel free to talk to me about this further if you want to."
selfharm,39b5w0,jjuuuu,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:44:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply :) , it's just the fact that it was the first test of many so I guess it sort of set the mood for the rest. In hindsight it isn't an unifiable mistake, luckily the subject has a second test next week which could hopefully balance everything out."
selfharm,39b5w0,asbestos-i-can,2,Wed Jun 10 22:45:39 2015 UTC,"but the fact that I've been doing so well the entire year yet it takes less than 2 hours to completely erase all of that progress   I'm from the US, so I don't know much about the educational system in the UK, but do universities only look at a single facet of your application, like test scores? Or do they weigh the scores together with other factors like grades, application essays, recommendation letters, extracurriculars, etc? Because you mentioned you've been doing well academically the past year, and I feel like that's got to count for something? I feel like if you've been a solid student, you definitely shouldn't give up hope. A test is just a one-time thing, whereas you had to earn your grades with real, persistent work over a whole year.  I'm sorry for my ignorance, and sorry if this isn't helpful. When I was trying to get into college, I did well on my tests and still didn't get into either of my dream schools. I went to my third choice, and yes, it's had its share of perks, but I still periodically feel sad about ""everything that could have been,"" and the feeling sucks. Sorry I can't be more uplifting. Best of luck to you."
selfharm,39b5w0,asbestos-i-can,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"For most universities they have entry requirements, so for example if you are doing 3 subjects the university could ask for a CCB or AAB, some universities use a points system but the points are based on the grades so they're essentially the same. You do tests in your first year which usually equate to 50% and then at the end of the second (this) year you do the remainder.  My grades in the first year were pretty average (CCD) but given my entry requirements it's doable as long as I do really well in a certain subject. Failing the test yesterday hasn't doomed me but it's certainly screwed my chances unless I haul ass on the rest of the tests from now on so that's the plan.  Thanks for the reply. don't worry, it's appreciated :)"

selfharm,398rq4,metalhead1999,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:04:45 2015 UTC,"Being there for him is good, but feeling responsible for him will make things worse on both of you. You will want to be a good friend and you will want to be there when things are the worst. You can be, but don't let that be all.   You are not a professional and you are not trained to help give your friend the coping mechanisms he will need to help himself out of this. You can try to talk to him and make it ok to get help, though.   The suicide attempt is a big red flag. You didn't see the signs before, and you may not see them in time the next time. If this happens, it is not your fault! There are places you can take him where he can check himself into (that you can visit often and continue to be there for him) where he can start breaking down the bad coping habits and start rebuilding something better."

selfharm,397n5f,jjuuuu,3,Tue Jun 9 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"From ages 12-18 I was being sexually abused by an older, very disturbed man. I started cutting for a couple reasons. One, because I was desperate to have control over my body. Hurting myself instead of being hurt by him was my way of gaining control. Second, because I thought that if he saw the physical evidence of the pain he was putting me in that he would stop hurting me. This man claimed to love me and often expressed how he thought I enjoyed being abused. However, when he saw my cuts, he liked that I was hurting myself ""for him"". He would force me to do it more. Now, it's been several months since I've escaped him and I can't help but still do it. I like feeling the cuts afterwards. I like having scars to remind me that my pain is real."

I get a lot of anxiety when a lot of people are around me too, so it relieved that.  But it got a lot worse after I was raped by an ex boyfriend. After nightmares, sometimes in hopes of preventing nightmares, to cope with the thoughts and flashbacks. The frequency is slowing down now.   My current boyfriend encourages me to talk to him first, or even after. He's trying to help me feel less ashamed about it since he thinks my secrecy with it is feeding it. Of course, he's helping with the root problems too, so that helps with slowing it down. But he's also good at reminding me that he still loves me even when I feel like I can't stop myself."

The bottom line I guess is just that I do it because I have problems dealing with the intensity of my emotions and the general sense of unhappiness/hopelessness I have about life.  At my worst (probably around 15-16), I self harmed for any reason. I did it when I was anxious, I did it when I was sad, I did it when I was fucking happy. In high school would skip chunks of my classes to cut because I was stressed. I've always held myself to unrealistically high standards, which doesn't mesh well with depression and a shitty attention span. I remember using it a lot of the time to focus or sleep when I was younger.  Another common theme for me is feeling out of control. If I feel like there is nothing I can do about something that is upsetting, I self harm to maintain some feeling of control over my life. I didn't really understand that I was doing this until I was an adult."

Now I'm not necessarily as bad as I was before but whenever I get angry, sad, or feel hopeless I SH pretty badly.

But I would do dozens at a time on my arms. As I grew up it truly became a way to deal with stress or emotions. I've pretty much tried to block out emotions to try and prevent it from happening, but it seems like it always pops back up and here I go again! If you feel like you are doing it over stupid things you need to think about what you're doing....are you harming where others can see when you are wearing normal shirt and shorts?

Quitting now would be the best thing you could do for yourself....or you might end up like me where you need to go just a little deeper to feel a little better!

I refused. I suffer from bpd and unfortunately he's has a long hard 20something years dealing with my insecurities. Last night he said he was done. I'm feeling hopeless. He stupidly told my two daughters about my recent pathetic attempts at suicide. Not really attempts. Just wishes to see how far I could go.  Anyway, I'm seeing my therapist today. She might drop me also, she made me sign a contract to not cut. I hope this blows over and I can stop doing this. Sorry for venting here. You have all been very supportive. Take care...."

I actually fucked my leg up pretty bad last Wednesday and it made me panic so I am trying to stop.  I actually take pictures of my cuts in the worst moments where there's blood everywhere. I relive my self harm through pictures so I don't cut again. I can still feel the cuts and the blood on my leg. It'd kind of like a serial killer enjoying their trophy in a way.

It's not something on an intellectual level (because I know that the shame makes me bad) but on an emotional level.  Anyway, I cut myself not really ""because I'm a girl inside"" but more because ""I don't want to be a boy anymore"".   I can't imagine how confused and upset and unhappy you are feeling right now. Would your family support you if you reached out to them? Society has come a long way - even in the last decade - in terms of equality and keeping their damn mouths shut when someone is different to them.   This period is surely better than before, but I still feel hate from society, or maybe I'm kind of paranoid and I misinterpret some things.  I mean I think almost all of my friend would accept me, and my mother too even if I know during the first months it would be hard for her because she loves her ""son"" and is ignorant about trans people (so she had some misconceptions and find them ""strange"", maybe ""a little disgusting""), but at the end she loves too much her children to reject them for who they are. However my father I don't know and I don't care because I don't like him (and my parents are divorced soon).   You are NOT a freak.

The one I went to, people were friendly, the doctors (except this one guy...) all listened to what you had to say, and it was an okay place in general.

selfharm,38vrng,al_the_apache,3,Sun Jun 7 06:18:27 2015 UTC,"At this point, you will definitely have visible scars, no matter what you do. Do use scar reduction creams to make them less visible, but you may want to consider other options, such as Henna designs, tattoos, jewelry, or something else. Even just doodling in black pen over your scars can be a way of hiding them. You do end up being ""that weirdo who draws on himself"" but that's better than being ""the mental patient who cuts himself"". Which isn't true, but extended families have a way of reacting like that. OTC scar ointments and antibiotic ointment is a good idea, as are the ideas listed in the site that /u/I_Love_Spiders_AMA linked. You might even consider makeup, if the scars aren't very dark, but makeup won't stay on in the water. I hope you can sort all this out. I totally know the feeling of needing to hide shit; I'm a competitive swimmer. Godspeed, my friend."
selfharm,38vrng,PM_ME_ROADKILL_,2,Tue Jun 9 01:38:10 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, this is a decent website with lots of information. I'm not a doctor nor do I have much knowledge on scar healing other than what I've used myself, but after the wound has healed (depends on how deep it is) you could buy silicon sheets from a drugstore. I used ones for a while after making a nasty cut on my wrist and I used one each night while I slept applied over the scar. It won't really ""heal"" it quicker but it will help compress the scar. Also, from experience, getting a sun tan helps blend the scar in with the rest of your skin and make it less noticeable. If you were thinking more of a cover up option, I use Kat Von D tattoo cover up. It's $20 a tube and covers scars fairly well (I'm also not the best make up artist). I hope that can help.

selfharm,38ux96,Idrkc,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"First off take the bandaid off and put on some gauze. Band aids keep the heat from the burn (yes heat your body inflames the area to flush out anything stuck in there) and can cause more damage, infections or bad scarring. Neosporin can help but make sure you're washing it with water and a gentle soap as well. After you wash it you need to let it air out. Letting a burn breathe is just as important as keeping it clean (which is what the gauze is for). Otherwise you may prolong the healing process. Burns can be very tricky and small ones are the most annoying in my experience."
selfharm,38ux96,mathwizard420,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:48:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, I actually did the same thing a few times and I wanted to lend you some advice.  Yes, I still have scars from it, but it could look worse.  They're really not that bad.  But what I wanted you to know is that you need to be very careful when in the shower.  GRAPHIC: mine were burned so that the fat was exposed, and it was impossible to grow scabs because they kept falling off in the shower.  So do yourself a favor and avoid hot showers.  The hot water makes it really hard for it to heal.  Try taking warm or cool showers.  Other than that, just keep neosporin on them.  You don't necessarily have to cover them.  I believe mine did better without bandages but it's hard to say exactly since they're such a pain in the ass to heal tbh.  I wish you speedy healing."

But him not saying it says more about him than you. Guys generally have difficulty talking about their feelings. Telling you he loves you opens him up to vulnerability and the possibility of being hurt. I know that's exactly what you have done, but he's not gonna think of that. I second the suggestion of talking to him. But try do it in a way that is no pressure on him, otherwise he will get defensive.  Go easy on yourself. You are worthy of being loved.

It was my first time on a plane since my family doesn't really have enough money to travel that much... I got to go to Diagon ally and Hogsmead and go through Hogwarts... I'd have to say my favorite ride was the escape from Gringotts... In which we were attacked by Voldemort and Bellatrix and saw Ron, Harry, and Hermione and was also saved by bill..... And thrown by security trolls... And in the line there were mechanical goblins working there and it was amazing...

selfharm,38qhxl,jjuuuu,4,Fri Jun 5 23:31:39 2015 UTC,"I do not condone self harm but if feel you absolutely need to, then ya your thigh would be the best place. I'm make and I used to cut on my arms but people almost found out on three seperate occasions. Now I cut on my upper thigh and no one ever sees it. Remember though, rather than running from your problems and trying harder to hide your cuts you should tell someone about it. But ya, for swimming in the future you could just say that the chlorine in the pool was too intense or something and you just sit by the pool and not swim. Good luck though and remember it may seem hard not to cut but I know you can beat it and be clean :)!"
selfharm,38qhxl,metalhead1999,2,Fri Jun 5 23:45:02 2015 UTC,"If you do choose the thigh area be careful. In my experience, the legs tend to bleed more and for a longer amount of time. Also, if your legs get sweaty it will burn like crazy. Hang in there guy! :)"

A bunch of people from work go swimming sometimes and I'd love to join them, but even the slim chance they see my scars makes me not. I only have cut on my thighs, but some are quite low and near my knee, so they could see. I tested wearing swim shorts and it's just not worth it. Oh well.... Not sure how this helps you but I thought I'd share."

So far I've only gone at night and no one noticed, but I'm nervous about the rest of the summer.  I think it might be best for you to try going to your thigh because it's really easy to get away with wearing swim shorts. I happen to hate cutting on my thighs because it does not satisfy me, but if you really need to keep cutting, which I'm not saying you should, maybe it would be better."

I think you should tell him. We both know how hard it can be to stop and how bad lying hurts so use that as a segue into telling him.   He doesn't understand sf harm and alot of people who don't cut really don't get it. Try and explain it to him as best you can without getting worked up.

selfharm,38q7rf,LightningGuardian,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"If the idea of telling him is causing you pain, you probably aren't going to stop thinking about telling him, regardless of any comment posted here. If your problem is not knowing whether or not to tell him, think of the positives and negatives. Don't make a list, because you can't put numerical value to important decisions like this. I want you to think about how he has stood beside you throughout previous hardships. To think about how he knew this was a problem before and decided to stay while others may have left. Possibly consider that he might be able to help, and the people who care for you want to know when you're hurting. It may be hard... For me it always is... But some times it's just better to ask for help. He obviously cares for you, and I doubt you would want him to find out on his own that the person he loves is hurting so bad, and he couldn't do anything because she didn't trust him enough. I send my love to the both of you, and I wish you luck in finding the answer you need"
selfharm,38nwo5,cryogenicRomantic,4,Fri Jun 5 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm a pale person who spent months a year in Sicily while cutting, so I've been there too.  Any moisturising creams or lotions without alcohol or perfumes/fragrances will help you with skin drying out and also the redness/irritation. I know its tempting to pick off scabs but they can slow down the healing and leave marks if disturbed, so try to be patient!  If you do tan then scars and lines may be noticeable, because of changing colour, but it won't be really obvious. Your skin will still be delicate and sensitive where you cut, so make sure you use suncream (and a high factor because you are fair skinned).   Most importantly: Be confident and safe and enjoy your summer :)"

My scars were more noticeable with tan skin. They would be healed for a month or so (they just looked like pinkish lines to me). They would be fading a lot and still be more noticeable.   I used to get swim shorts that would cover mine. Half the time I was in guys swim trunks because I did it too low on my thigh."

selfharm,38mw26,stickfiguredrawings,2,Fri Jun 5 06:23:57 2015 UTC,"hi <3   you've probably already looked into it but postpartum depression sounds like it might be happening. I don't know if you were talking to anyone or taking anything before you had your daughter. it could just be a continuation of what you had going on before. but it also could be that things have changed or (possibly) gotten worse. if you're not talking to anyone, I really really think that you should at least look into it. not just for you really, but for your family too. I really think that you deserve to be happier. you have a beautiful daughter. she's going to grow up and as she gets old enough to really know you and start learning how to be a person, your health is going to be really really important. you both deserve love. if YU are talking to someone, it is probably worth looking for a change because it sounds like things aren't working.   beyond this, I know that some communities have social groups for moms. I don't know if this sounds appealing but getting out and meeting people and not having to worry about leaving your daughter behind could be soooo good for you. you don't have to put yourself out there that much and if you try it and you hate it then you can pull back and stay away. but just changing up your routine would be good. at the very least, taking up a new hobby. I don't know how you feel about knitting but it's really easy once you learn and you can do it in tiny pieces whenever you have time. but then eventually you produce a physical thing that you made and it can be rewarding.   sorry I'm being so rambly but I do care about you and I really want to help <3"

It seems like the people who are your support system are also pretty messed-up themselves, so they are not able to give you the care that you need. Instead of looking for help from them, is there anyone else you can talk to who is maybe a bit more...neutral? I couldn't tell from your post whether you are in high-school or college, but either way your school should have some people you can talk to (counselors, etc) who may be able to give you some perspective that these other suffering people cannot. Please consider talking to someone from outside your friend/family group...I think it might help you a lot."
selfharm,38me4c,burningpopsicles,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:02:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I would talk to someone but my mother doesn't even want me talking to my friends about our issues. She thinks ignoring the problem will make it go away. She caught me burning myself once and I punched a wall in front of her another time. She doesn't think I self harm regularly though. She knows I throw up from anxiety every morning and she says I'm just hysterical. I also have physical health issues, but she refuses to give me medication for it that was prescribed from several different doctors. She hates medicine. Kind of ironic. Also I am in high school and she thinks that if she gets me any help I won't be able to get into a good university. That's why she never reported my sister's anorexia, even at the point where my sister would pass out from starving herself. She thinks that because she studied medicine she can handle it herself. She can't. Do you know of any way I can get around that?"
selfharm,38me4c,Lenaballerina,2,Fri Jun 5 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"If you do have a counsellor at your school, you definitely don't need your mother's permission to talk to them. They can provide you with all sorts of resources that are available in your area, and your mom doesn't even have to know. If you are not ready to take that step yet, I  have always found Captain Awkward's blog gives really good advice about how to deal with difficult/manipulative/controlling people in your life. You might also want to check out the good folks at /r/raisedbynarccisists. However, as helpful as the internet can be, it is no substitute for talking to someone face to face, so I really really  think that talking to the counsellor at your school should be your first step."

selfharm,38luki,metalhead1999,3,Fri Jun 5 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"And as far as seeing life in a positive way, some of the best advice is fake it. Tell yourself you will have a damn good day. Tell yourself how happy you are to feel the sun on your skin. Find little victories in life and cherish them. Another suggestion (hippie shit alert) is crystals and stones. I'm ""agnostically pagan"" as I call it and I love crystals and stones. I constantly carry rose quartz with me everywhere I go, whether it be my necklace or my actual rose quartz crystal. Why? It represents Love in all forms. I love love, I choose to try and swallow myself in it. Not just romantically but I choose to love everything around me (excuse my hippieness, it's cheesy I know. But hey,it helps me anyway). So by carrying it with me at all times, when I start tearing myself down right before I cut, I will hold or touch my rose quartz, reminding myself to love myself and to love love. I'm not sure what your views are on that stuff, but it really does help focus and center me when I'm really about to lose it. I can tell you where / how you can get them if you'd like. <3"

But what's great is by WANTING to tell someone, it shows inner strength and that a part of you, whether subconscious or not, wants to get better. I have always struggled with talking about my feelings and let alone my cutting. How I usually manage to do it (which is pretty rare ) is I find someone I truly, truly trust and just blurt it out. You have no Idea what their reaction is going to be (no matter how much you think you do, you don't) so no use trying to plan how they'll react. Tell them you need to talk, and blurt it out. The worst will be over, and the relief you'll feel is damn near close to the relief felt when we self harm. You won't have to hide, no matter if the consequences will be good or bad, at least you won't have to hide.   I hope that helps. And I wish you the very best in beating this, I know you can <3"

That's effectively the result of the release of endorphins. It's this feeling that I crave, as it provides release to the pain I'm feeling.  How much is enough? Recently I've been limiting myself to an area that will fit under a 5x5cm dressing pad. Sometimes I cut a little somewhere else to supplement this, but I like to have my wounds covered overnight to avoid bleeding all over my clothes."
selfharm,38ik4y,jjuuuu,2,Thu Jun 4 14:28:22 2015 UTC,I feel comforted. Like when you're a kid and your mom hugs you to make to feel better. It feels a lot like that.

selfharm,38ik4y,HarveyOpossum,2,Thu Jun 4 22:45:53 2015 UTC,"Literally speaking, I feel pain when I SH.  A knife is entering my skin.  That's not supposed to happen so pain receptors are triggered and send impulses to my brain.  I'm usually extremely angry at myself when I harm, so I feel self-hate while I do it, both at myself for being me and at myself for needing to harm myself.  I use this hate and self loathing to keep the cutting going.  If I'm not bleeding, I'm not angry enough.  If it doesn't look deep enough to leave a mark, I'm a fuckup who can't even self harm the ""right"" way.  These are completely the wrong ways to think and extremely unhealthy, but it's how I feel when I'm doing it.  If I cut long enough, the pain fades away almost completely, which I find to be even more disturbing then the need to cut.  When the pain fades, it leaves room to cut deeper and those deeper cuts are what is going to get you in trouble really quick.  It's those ""no pain"" cuts that are going to send you to the hospital for stitches.  That's how I know it's usually time to call it, if my limb of the day feels numb from the pain.  After its over, I feel a wave of relief followed immediately by a nauseating sense of pride and guilt.  It's not ""pride"" in that I'm happy that I did it - no one should feel proud of harming themselves purposefully - it's more just that I don't know if there is a word to really explain it.  It's like...being excited, ashamed and pleased all at once.  You feel good that you feel bad, and you feel bad about feeling good, about making yourself feel bad.  About ten to fifteen minutes later I feel a decent adrenaline rush that is probably about the equivalent of a few cups of coffee all at once.  As for how much is enough: the long term answer to that question is nothing is ever enough.  I can hate myself much deeper and longer then I can feel love for myself.   That is something that I need to work on fixing.  The short term answer is: If blood is running down my legs and touching my socks, it's a good stopping point."

They're more likely to turn brighter and stick out more. The redness will fade with more time. As kruemelmonstah said a few months old isn't much time for them to fade yet.   Personally, I use Vaseline cocoa butter or almond milk lotion on scars. For newer/fresh cuts neosporin helps keep scarring down. My grandma always told me cocoa butter helps fade stretch marks and it seems to work with scars as well. There's also a section in the wiki on the side bar about preventing and fading scars."

To me, the really tricky part is getting personal consumption down as far as how often I expose myself to SH threads, pictures, content, etc.  Until very recently, I used be pretty active in some of the sister subreddits on here but had to slow down/stop after I noticed it seemed to be playing a contributing factor in some of my bad habits, and in some cases making them a bit worse as far as feeling a need to cut in order to ""fit in"" or contribute to posts.  It wasn't even that people encouraged it - they didn't - it was simply a matter of how I felt about those places.  It was super weird how easy it is to get sucked into a certain kind of thinking.  That feeling of validation among your peers can be really powerful stuff sometimes.  Anywho, I hope everything goes well for you and I hope that you feel welcome to use this place as often as you need it.  Unfortunately there are some threads that go unanswered, even when people are hurting pretty badly, but I would guess that just about anyone who comments in these threads is willing to respond to PM's if you need someone to talk to directly.

selfharm,38hdgu,lactosefree1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:39:47 2015 UTC,"I've been in it and it doesn't make loneliness any less lonely. That's my problem. I have nobody, I have nothing, I'm near broke, I seriously consider suicide nearly every day. This is no fucking way to live a life. I don't know what it's like to be loved. Everything for me has always been underappreciation because I don't live up to everyone else's expectations simultaneously. And when I say fuck it I'll do it myself, suddenly I'm the bad guy.  Like nevermind that I was the best worker the company had but they still went ahead and fired me anyways. Set me up into a position where I couldn't fight back, lied to me repeatedly, and nobody sees my side except the few people I got to know during my time there. I can't get another job because nobody wants someone who was fired over a pretense of medicinal cannabis, the thing I use to make everything ok enough for me to get out of bed in the morning, the thing that suppresses the thoughts I don't want to have and should not want, including different ways to kill people, and they had a problem with that? Like shit I don't even get high from it. It takes way more than I can smoke in any given period for me to get stoned. You wouldn't be able to tell that I just smoked, other than the smell, which can even be hidden. But I digress. Similarly to the point I was making before I got sidetracked, it was my second job, places throw my application out almost immediately because ""former employment history"" isn't even fully filled out.  My mom wants me to get a job down here near her but I'm trying to move the fuck away from this fucking psycho. And I'm not to the point in my life where I can accept a job, go through the training, and say ""Oh sorry I'm moving elsewhere, gotta quit"" but somehow they think I am. Like I can't even get a fucking interview without help. Fucking pathetic. My life is just so fucked up and set so far back because I don't want to be the person everyone else wants me to be so I'm not allowed to be anyone at all. I have none of the skills I'd need to survive on my own, and I hate feeling like a leech, which is what happens because I am unable to be self sufficient.  And on top of that? The past 6 months or so my dad has been trying to be a parent to me for basically the first time in my life (not that I exactly blame him for that because for so long he was our sole breadwinner and couldn't do much of that stuff), but what the fuck, the first parenting I've ever really received and I'm fucking 21. Bad enough I was orphaned at birth, but to be then stuck in my shit hole of a life after? How the fuck am I even still alive? I've never known love in my life, so when I try to find it, it's always unrequited. I feel like a fucking dog most of the time, where you can slap me away as many times as you want, but I'll still come back and try to show affection because it's all I know how to do.  I wasn't a bad kid. I followed all the rules that were worth following. I did chores without complaining excessively, usually without complaint at all. Got good grades at good schools, and when suddenly I didn't have above a 3.5 GPA it was the end of the fucking world. And I was expected to maintain above a 3.5 basically always. Above a 3.4 in the best public middle school in the state? Not good enough, apparently. And eventually I learned that I could fight back. Not that it changed expectations. Like who cares about unweighted GPA anyways? Great, I got a fucking C+ in an honor class that had 15% of the grade as homework grade and I didn't do a single homework assignment all year. I must be some horrendous failure that will work dead end jobs forever. Or, maybe, did it occur to you, that in fact, maybe it's something that doesn't interest me? No, that's preposterous, because anything that interests you has to be a part of my life? I'm fucking done. Why do I always have to do everything for everyone, and then get punished as a result?  Well ok I may have not been the best behaved at school, but I was nowhere near the worst. As far as I was concerned, other than the goodie two shoes kids, I was pretty much the kid that got in trouble the least, and it was usually something like ""talking out of turn"" or ""homework not done"" but big surprise when I'm the one who actually knows what the person is trying to say and expand on it with more clarity so the teacher knows that they knew it too, or when I'm the one with the highest grade on the test consistently, but never did the homework. If I get it, why waste my time? ""Everyone else has to do it"" well I'm not everybody fucking else, am I? I'm not going to go around bragging that homework is optional for me now, I don't even have anyone to brag to since I was always bullied in elementary school. Most of my friends moved away to other schools when my school closed and we had to start attending a different elementary. One got kinda kicked out for a really funny reason, especially because he didn't even know what he was saying, one got diagnosed with dyslexia and had to go to a special school that specifically is for dyslexics, one got accepted into a really good private school system. So by 6th grade all my closest friends went to other schools than me and some kid thought I would be a great target to pick on. Long story short, by May, I had had enough, this kid was getting what was coming to him. He tried to pull his bullshit, my foot was between his nuts and back on the ground before he had a chance to register what happened. Keep in mind, this is after I had gone to the principal about this kid, so there was obviously no stopping this kid without force. And of fucking course, I got in trouble and he got away with it. And since then for some reason my parents, at least the psycho, always think I'm lying about everything for some reason.  Whatever, sorry, Pink Floyd wants their wall back so I'll leave it to them. At least my dogs still love me."

You said that you don't know what it's like to feel loved? Well I love you. Wherever you are right now know that I care deeply for you.

selfharm,38hdgu,nymphetamine-x-girl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow lactose intolerant, LoL playing, depressed redditer.  I'm not sure what field you are looking for a position in, but most jobs will not discriminate if you've got a prescription for your marijuana. Perhaps more importantly, most corporations will not tell a potential future employer the reason for termination: it keeps them from getting sued for libel. When asked the reason for your separation, list something vague but true like ""out of work commitment too large"" ""moral conflict"" ""improper work-life balance"" or ""job duties did not match training."" I have been a hiring manager and these things do not raise too many flags.  I read your whole post as well...  The most important step to getting employment or anything else you want really is by acting charismatic. Make people believe you. Speaking to an employer? Make them believe that they need you. Defeatism and charisma are directly opposite, so even when the world is crashing down and defeat appears imminent and you've accepted it as fact, act determined, convincing, brave, and personable.   It's good you have dogs. I've got 7 adoptions animals and they keep me sane (2 sugar gliders, 2 cats, 1 dog, and 2 bearded dragons).   Know that how others treat you reflects only their value, not yours. Humans are the only species that adjusts themselves based on the perceived awareness of others; the problem with this is that perception, actual cues, and original meaning rarely align how we interpret them too. Given this, how we view others' opinions of us holds little value as a barometer of worth. Live life how you deem best and disregard others' opinions because even if they meant something valuable, it's unlikely that you'd interpret their meaning precisely anyways.  Finally, in part because of the aforementioned miscommunication involved in speech, more people love you than you'd ever realize. If you have a league team, they love you. Your crazy mother loves you. Your high school sweetheart loves you. Your distant relatives love you, and likely a young female admirer loves you the way you want and need to be loved, but you just don't know it yet. You should look for signs of love in peoples' action rather than disapproval. I had some of the worst. parents imaginable, but far behind themselves they love me and it shows through little actions like my alcoholic piece of shit father bragging to the neighbors about his pre-med daughter (despite the fact that I have a social sciences degree, am a semester away from an international politics degree, and am going to grad school for international security). Most people love themselves before others, but even though they may be selfish, there are people in your life who love you.  If I could I'd give you a long, reassuring hug and get that oxytocin flowing, but all you need to do to find someone to embrace is look around with an open mind. Everyone needs to feel loved and valued. But in order to do that, you have to look for signs of affection over rejection."

Especially in the medical field, coworkers will probably have the sense to mind their own business when it comes to scars and injuries if you are not open with it from the start.  At 14 your skin will probably heal fairly well, at least enough to not  have scars be super obvious. I'm not sure how deep/bad your scars are, but I had some pretty nasty scars from a piece of glass that covered my entire forearm from when I was 16. I'm 22 and they're fairly hard to see now unless you look close. Lotion every morning and night will help the skin, make sure to use it after you shower or bathe because that's when your skin will have the most moisture. Neosporin and vaseline lotion helped mine fade."

I only want to destroy myself, my body, cutting away at what makes me, me (at least on the outside). I cry during this moment, my tears being shed because I'm weak, pitiful, angry, and so completely alone. And I cut and cut until I feel calm.   After: There's a beautiful calm that overtakes me and I feel rejuvenated. I'm able to handle things, people, crises, etc. I feel better.  Of course then it all comes back around.

Usually scared, stressed, anxious, guilty, or some combination of them all.   During: Usually once I get to the point where I'm feeling all those negative things, I end up drinking. Once I'm drinking, my resolve not to self harm goes down drastically. I usually start drinking with the knowledge that I'll probably self-harm if I do, but it gives me the fuck-it to go ahead. At this point, my body is usually numb and my attitude is ""fuck it all"" and I'm usually listening to music.   Afterwards: Usually sleepy...because usually I've been drinking a lot. Emotionally and physically numb, content.   The Day After: Usually ready to pick up the pieces and start working again (usually it's stress regarding school that drives me over the edge). Usually tired because I've been up late the night before. At times I feel guilty about it, but not usually. My attitude has become more...""fight for the good days and do your best"" than ""be perfect"".  Edit: Just to clarify, I'm usually sober when I decide I'm going to harm.

Like I'm weak and useless but I deserve the pain so I should do it.  During: A weird form of solace mixed with satisfaction. Sort of like, ""I deserve the pain I'm glad I'm doing it this feels right. You're shitty this what you get for being shitty.""  After: Be a little angry at ones self. Tell myself I'm an idiot then pass out for doing this.  The next day: ""Get. Yourself. Together.""

My mom used to know, but thinks I just outgrew my ""teenage angst"". I'm not sure I want to stop. I've just started doing it in places people won't see unless I'm naked.

I have a half sleeve and few others. I remember while getting the tattoos really enjoying the pain. A lot of it because I knew I could endure it and that eventually you go numb. I feel like there's some sort of connection between the two. You could either cut and give yourself cuts or be addicted to tattoos because you get that same high and cover yourself with art. One being some what more socially acceptable than the other. It's strange.  I hope I stop at some point. Like you, while it's not frequent, it does happen. I don't know if the day will come when I stop. I guess I like the pain for some reason.  Maybe we're not hopeless. Maybe we're just really weird. I don't want to sound like I'm encouraging our behaviour because I'm not. Maybe tattoos/piercings are the lesser of two evils. I don't know. Everything is complicated.  You're not alone."

selfharm,38bb9l,aerumnus,6,Wed Jun 3 02:45:10 2015 UTC,"just to keep going with your analogy here, for a lot of women, the solution to the bra problem is to get a more comfortable bra. if a bra is made well and fits properly, then wearing it shouldn't be such a burden. (see some killa evidence at /r/abrathatfits if you're curious.) so basically, extending this to your situation, there's a function that you need something to fill and your current solution isn't making you happy. long sleeved shirts, cardigans over short sleeved shirts, or even just fewer, but thicker, bracelets, could help. each of these (especially the shirts) is much more comfortable. if it's really hot then pairing them with shorts can help so you're not too bundled up. even just doing this sometimes can be nice! if you still do think it'd be too hot, you could also consider just leaving your arms bare. I don't know your school/work situation, but some people like to just do that and often find that after any initial reactions, it's not such a big deal.   basically, if you're uncomfortable with your situation, there are things that could help :)"

Instead of focusing on the urge though, try and think about what you can do to defeat it.  When I feel the urge coming on really strong, usually the first thing I do is start reasoning things out: ""Okay, so I want to cut the shit out of myself.  Really, really badly.  What's going to happen if I don't?  Will I go into shock if I don't cut?  Am I going to go into convulsions and have a heart attack and die if I don't cut for 5 more minutes?  I think I want it just because I want it.  I just want to fuck myself up because X Y and Z are bothering the shit out of me right now and I can't handle it any other way.  So why do I want to do it?""  Etc.  Sometimes just thinking it out logically can be enough to talk myself out of it, but obviously the success rate is less than 100% or else very few of us would feel the need to come here.  Not sure what the local time is around you right now, but if it's daylight, try and go for a walk.  If it's nighttime, you could always try and push out a few sets of 20 push ups/situps.  If working out isn't your thing you could give cooking a try.  There's a ton of great recipes out there that are pretty easy to make.  Want a healthy snack?  Give Lemon-Earl Grey Squares a shot.  There's lots of great recipes on FoodNetwork too, if you don't have the ingredients for that one.  If you have a car, you could try just driving around for a bit with the radio playing, maybe listen to some music or NPR or what have you.  Video games are always a great outlet.  I've been playing the fuck out of Elite: Dangerous and GTA5 on PC recently.  If you've got a PS3 you could try out Tokyo Jungle, Ni No Kuni, Persona 3/4, Yakuza 3/4, etc. There's also a ton of games out there for Xbox and Wii/U as well.  Hell, you don't even need to play anything fancy, even something as simple as TypeRacer could probably distract you for a good couple of hours! :)  If you like watching movies and TV shows, you could check out something on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu or of course, YouTube.  There's tons of stuff out there, I would just try and avoid concentrating on the self harm until you start to feel it subside."

I have been relapsing for the past few weeks and have told no one yet.. But I feel the same way when I started again. Stupid, a fuck up, worthless. It's such a scary part of cutting, the psychological damages it causes to you. But please know that you're not stupid, you're not weak. You're a fighter and a survivor, and you will get out one day. I've been on a ten year journey and I agree, it's such a vicious cycle.. Out of all my poor decisions in life, starting to cut is my biggest regret. You can do it though, you can get out. Some day, whether it be today, tomorrow, or ten years from now, you'll look back and say ""Wow, I did it. I beat it""."

People need to remember, cutting is addictive. Making it 2 weeks is a great stride. No one can just completely stop an addiction thing out of no where permanently!

As for the scars, I use bepanthen scar treatment, which is a silicone gel that you use daily. I have found it super helpful. Others have mentioned silicone patches as being helpful also. If you're prone to keloid scarring, to my knowledge the only thing that would help are steroid injections under the tissue, which helps to lighten and flatten the scars. Your GP would be the best person to discuss this with, and they should know what is and isn't covered under the NHS.  Good luck :-) sounds like you're doing really well :-)"

I'm really sorry that what was most likely an attempt at politeness made you feel so bad, but I just wanted to try an explain my perspective on it incase it helps you understand."

I was told I was too ""high risk"" for the psychologist I was seeing, and the inpatient unit psych team wouldn't discharge me from the unit until I agreed to go into more intensive treatment. They thought it would make things better and all it's done is make my suicide attempts more fatal and made me cut even deeper.  I know I'm lucky to recieve the care that I do, but I don't feel like it's helping.   That makes sense, I wish they didn't feel the need to comment on it at all though. Thankfully the person who deals with my self harm the most (my GP) doesn't comment on it, she just closes them up and we talk about dogs or other happy things.  Thank you <3"

Literally, there is no way in hell this thing is a scratch. I almost saw the muscle when I cut. Doctors and professionals in general don't use ""heavy"" words when speaking, to try and create a sense of care for you, understanding, and not dig too deep. I mean think about it, which sounds harsher, ""what are those cuts on your arm?"" Or ""how did those scratches get there?.""  Just my 2 cents :). Stay strong, you know everyone here loves you"

Because I can't cut. But today. Just now, I caved, I cried and cried because I've eaten so much today, I guess I cut to relieve myself, but to punish myself as well; because I'm weak, and I put razor down, just to pick up a fork.

Nothing can come of a life full of hatred for one self. This is your main hurdle. It is obvious, and it is true.  This is the worst part, accepting that the failure you see in the mirror is someone, someone you would not hate if you were outside looking in. That if you were looking at yourself from the perspective of a stranger, you would only see the pure human, with its flaws, and with its qualities. Someone would even see a person with a purpose.   Something good is waiting for you, and you only.   That something will find you, and you will find yourself. Which comes first, we can never know. Trust me, though. It might get a whole lot worse first, but you will have your something. In this life.   Do not fool yourself. You're neither especially bad, nor good. Inherently we're all flawed. And that's humanity. Perfect with its imperfections. It's absolutely fucked, but hey, God tries his best.  When you think about the bad-bad and the turdfuck, force yourself to smile. Look that shit right in the eyes. Accept it, so that you can move on. Close your eyes, embrace the shit in your soul, so that you can cleanse. ""Alright, I am an idiot, alright she will not have me, alright, I constantly sabotage myself. Alright, the world is shit, I have bitchtits and I am ugly. If I accept these things and move on, I will be better equipped for the next time I inevitably crash into depression"". Because it will happen again, but there are mechanisms to cope. A depression can be a wonderful place. It can be a place for great growth. It takes time to control a deep depression, but when you put the saddle on her for the first time, just you wait...  You are all alone in this world, and that, is a great security, and the best companionship if you allow it to be. A friend stepped up with this great knowledge in a time of great despair for me, when I couldn't handle my mind; It's ok to observe the thoughts in your head without identifying with them. They are not you, they are humanity. Only you can decide the value you give to those thoughts.  Do not fool yourself. Under the dirt is gold. If I could love myself, everybody can. I did have those feelings. Sometimes I still do. I can only laugh at it now. I look in the mirror and feel like that's an old friend looking back. We've been trough some shit together. I still hate that guy, but I love him more. I do have friends, but I didn't see it when I was sick. They just didn't know what to do. They were afraid of making it worse. And they had their own stuff. Don't expect anything from anyone. Expect the worst and you will never be disappointed.  What really helped my during my last heavy bout, was that I realised... I am not depressed. I am an artist. And depression, is my livelihood. We see the world with a more honest set of eyes. That is not granted for everyone. You can be an ace student all your life without getting the insights that depression can provide.  OWN. THAT. SHIT. Also, join a boxing club. You need release.  Heavy, is the foundation for light."

I used to see a therapist and he seemed to focus on the self harm, how often and how I was doing it.  He always seemed to ask me about suicide a lot too, which I wasn't suicidal.   I quit going because at the time I just had so many appointments it was very hard to make it to them. I may consider going back.   My children are not abused, nor in any danger and they never have been. They're very happy. I don't know why I have such an irrational fear of losing them over this."
selfharm,384pfq,arachnophobia-kid,4,Mon Jun 1 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds cliched, but I think going out of your way to hide them will attract more attention to them than not. Long-sleeved light shirts aren't particularly attention-grabbing, but if you usually love to go swimming, it'd seem odd for you to suddenly not want to swim at all. Unless your brother and the others are terrible people, which I don't have reason to think they are, I wouldn't expect them to be uncomfortable if you don't seem so. A random cut on my friend's leg wouldn't worry me, but I'd probably wonder if something was up if they went to great lengths to make sure it was hidden.  Plus, bunches of parallel cuts on your non-dominant arm might be hard to pass off as anything else, but two random cuts on different limbs don't seem that improbable.  Of course, ""just act naturally"" is easier said than done, and if you're like me, trying to act naturally might come off as even less natural. So if you'd rather a different approach, you could claim to have cramps, if biologically applicable. Or that you forgot your sunscreen/bug spray (though that won't help if someone else brought some). You could put off swimming until after dark, if that's an option.   I hope you have a good time though, and that the situation won't put too much of a damper on your enjoyment."

Hell, I've slept with people who had no idea I self injure and I have very blatantly self inflicted scars if you're looking. Thing is, most people are not.   Anyway, you could claim to have a perforated eardrum. Ensure you remember which ear it's supposed to be and fake some mild (mild, srsly) hearing loss. You'll need to pretend for a few weeks to a month to make it convincing though. I reckon it's probably too much effort to go to and you might be better off to continue on as normal.   Alternatively you could use a supportive bandage on one of your affected limbs which would double up as a cover up and excuse not to swim. Again, you have the effort of remembering your cover story.  I hope that this isn't the sole reason you don't want to go and that if you do you have a good time."

selfharm,37zizo,72lhsd6,8,Sun May 31 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"In a way I feel as if my cutting isn't good enough. Like it's sub par in a way. I feel a bit of an inferiority-superiority complex when it comes to cutting. Like mine is worse than one person s, that's hreat, my pain is obviously deeper. Oh this persons is deeper so their pain is deeper, i'm just a bitch for not cutting deeper.  It's some sort of weird shit in my head."
selfharm,37zizo,Youknow_whatever,7,Sun May 31 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"I find myself feeling that way a lot, like I'm not a ""true"" cutter because none of my wounds have required stitches or whatever.  Similiarly, I used to brand myself before I started cutting, I felt like my self harm at the time ""didn't count"" because I wasn't, I don't know, hardcore enough to use a knife or something.  Totally stupid reasoning.  Harm is harm.  Anyway, the ways that I try and deal with it is two fold:  1) I've started to transition away from going to/viewing most of the places that show those types of images, including some of the one's on reddit.  Regardless of intent or whatever, I just felt like every time I saw those images I either felt inferior in my own cutting habits.  I also noticed an increased urge to cut more often, so I would feel justified to take pictures of fresh wounds and post them for the sense of community.  This could have gotten much, much worse if I had allowed it to.  I don't know if viewing SH pics works for some in order to cope more easily, but it didn't seem to be making things any better for me - it seemed to be making them significantly worse.  Only you can be the judge of whether they are helping you cope or not, but I would have a serious self-assessment of how those places make you feel and how you might have noticed your actions change since you started going to them.  2) I try and rephrase how I view my cuts.  Rather then concentrate on the physical aspect of the wound, whether it be my own or someone elses, I try and focus more on the intent of the cut.  Why did I feel the need to harm myself?  What was it that cutting gave me that I couldn't get from some other source?  Would anything bad have happened if I hadn't cut?  Stuff like that.  Instead of letting myself get caught up in the semantics of how it looks, how deep it is, how much it bled, etc. I try to think more about what lead the action to occurring and less on the results of that action.  The scars are just the confirmation that something happened, you know?  Yep, I did that when I was upset about X, Y and Z.  Maybe if I do 1, 2 and 3 next time those things won't have the chance of happening and I won't get that upset.  If they do happen, maybe I'll slow my role for a few minutes first and try and talk out my feelings with someone instead of slicing open my flesh again as my first and only option.  If I devoted even half the time that I did in obsessing over where, when and how deep I was going to cut next time, towards something more positive like what I can do to get myself to stop, I probably would have completely recovered by now.  Not to beat up on myself or whatever, it's just a fact really.  If you plan on cutting, you are probably going to cut.  If you plan on recovery, hell, maybe something good will happen.  Maybe not.  But it's worth a try, right?  I guess to answer your question, I deal with the envy feeling by seeking out more positive alternatives to it.  By the way, it's fine if you don't feel like the things I suggested are going to work for you, or you might not feel like your there yet, or they just sound like total bullshit or something.  Everyone has their own ways of fighting SH, just try and find something that you can do in order to fight SH effectively and get yourself into the early stages of recovery."

If he is a center of darkness, if he is encouraging the blade to enter your veins, then please let him go. Ultimately, you have the power, but I do understand it needs to be drawn out somehow.   Maybe, my words can help, even a tiny bit. Even a sliver, it's better than the void, right?   There are people that can help you. I won't say they are on every corner, but they exist. As scary as it may seem, you may be able to find a therapist, to explain to, to confide in, to bring you to Earth again. I can try to help, too. But I am but a troubled layman.   There are people that have dedicated their lives to helping the tortured souls of the world, to help the sweet, damaged people like you go to university, and complete your goals.   I hope you may find one. And if not, I hope you can find solace in the knowledge in that you're not alone. I too am suffering, and I feel I understand your disassociation, to an extent. Being trapped in a body is an unfortunate reality, but it is one we must face, and hopefully accept in time.   I wish you will find some happiness in your struggling mind, I will continue hope for the both of us."

It’s very existence is what defines us, what makes us human. That force is love.  Love, you see, is the one force that cannot be explained, cannot be broken down into a chemical process. It is the beacon that guides us back home when no one is there, and the light that illuminates our loss. It’s absence robs us of all pleasure, of our capacity for joy. It makes out nights darker and our days gloomier. But when we find love no matter how wrong, how sad, or how terrible, we cling to it. It gives us our strength. It holds us upright.

selfharm,37sfxk,weeniehutsenior,4,Sat May 30 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"Hi, am a mum. My almost 14yr old daughter is currently in a psych ward due to a suicide attempt (her first), and has been SH for a year and a half. Even though she had never attempted it before, that day I knew what was going to happen, the tone of her voice was wrong. Fortunately that meant that we were able to get medical assistance almost as soon as it happened. But mothers intuition isnt always that good, and maybe your mum's radar went off for some reason. For me, I know that I am reminded in so many ways- seeing another person's story, seeing an old friend of my daughter who was involved with my daughter during a hard period, a dream or flash back, or just the fear after a ""good"" period, that it might be happening and that we just cant see it.  I suspect a lot of other parents of SH understand the need for privacy of emotions. We know that the parent/child dynamic often is a negative one, regardless of how hard we try, and is often the cause of stress. So although it might seem like we arent trying, sometimes its a hard effort for us to not do anything- if that makes sense to you. I know that I am trying very hard with my daughter to give her the power of control over her anxiety and depression, and part of that is allowing her to choose who she talks to and understanding that I will always be the last person on that list... hopefully, for now anyway.   If your mum (mom) has upset you, let her know. And let her know what you need from her. I know its easier said than done and theres often so much more involved than just a simple conversation, but hopefully it gives you a sense that you can get whatever it is you need, when you need it.   big hugs"

There could've been countless triggers--be it my experiences, my dad's suicide attempt last year, or my twin brother and his anxiety problems. There's plenty of fuel  I'm also glad to hear your daughter is getting help. I was sent to a psych unit a month before I turned 14. It helped me get back on my feet and the psychiatrists and psychologist I'd seen started taking my case a bit more seriously. The one downside, though, was coming back to the real world. My life didn't have the structure that I'd gotten used to. I didn't feel like I was ready anymore. I don't know if she's been in a ward before, but she'll probably have a similar experience. I'm sending her my blessings; being 13 is the worst.   Take care"

Once I touch that blade to my skin, I have to keep going until it is 'good enough' and I just don't know if that is a risk I can take. One cut is easier to hide than a hundred.

Sometimes I feel as though managing to make someone feel better in some way is better than just making myself feel worse. That is nice during the day. It actually was nice for a period of my life 24/7. Nowadays I have a nice time making someone feel a bit more alright with things before sundown, then after the productive part of my day ends and I am alone at home things go right back to ""the truth"" I feel about myself.

My scars are very visible (to hide them, I'd have to wear long sleeves through out the year) and there are so many of them that my skin looks mangled. And yet I'm past that part of my life. People tell me I'm attractive, and like to be around me. I hate my scars, but people rarely bring them up anymore. It's only occasionally awkward around people I'm just meeting.  I don't know how much I can offer, but if you try to be a good, friendly person, good people will look past your scars. I can understand your BFs shock at finding self-inflicted scars, but if he really likes you, he'll get over it. But if he doesn't, break up with him, don't wait to be hurt by him. Seriously, there is no one in the world worth tormenting yourself over, and certainly not killing yourself over. People like us generally grew up not being taught to care or like ourselves, and it's hard to learn, but you can't let your emotions be controlled by other people, especially SOs. Learn to love and be comfortable with yourself, and happiness will follow."

Maybe, that means community service, or perhaps it means something else entirely.

I never thought I would get to this point and on one hand I'm scared but on the other hand it was so... easy.   I know this might not be what you want to hear, but I hope you're taking care of your wounds and making sure the blades are clean? Helps prevents complications and wounds close faster this way. Its always scary to realize firsthand how easy it is to bring the blade down because it goes against our survival instinct, I think? But for those of us who SH, we do it for varying reasons. I've been clean for roughly a few months now but the thoughts of SH are never too far away still. It sounds dumb, but I try not to SH as often as I can and vent it out in other ways like designing stuff or other hobbies. There are days where I draw pictures and there are days where I draw blood. So, yeah find out what triggers you, find ways to cope with your thoughts and emotions and always make SH the very, very last resort if ever.   And today I saw new cuts on a very close friend of mine and I never knew she cut before so I want to talk to her but I have no idea how I could bring it up if she doesn't want me to know.   I don't know the extent of friendship you guys have, but my advice would be be avoiding any discussion with her about what you saw. One reason (why you shouldn't) would be that your own psyche isn't in an okay place right now. Sort out the things bothering you, clear your mind first then try to help someone else. The wrong words or emotions expressed can be a trigger for her to SH again, the last thing anyone who's trying to help wants to achieve. On the other hand, of course you understand your friend(ship) better than an Internet stranger - so if you think you have a plan in talking it out with her and be of some help to each other, then go for it! All that matters is that you know what's in your heart and where it is (:  I hope this helps, and please takecare!"
selfharm,37jri2,MDogg351,1 point,Thu May 28 03:19:26 2015 UTC,It has to be up to you whether you tell them. I or anyone else can't make that decision for you.  That's awful that your friend had to be hospitalized. I hope they feel better soon. It's not your fault that they're having issues. It really sounds like your friend would have gotten down low enough on their own that your actions didn't make that decision for them. They were struggling and now they're in a safe place. I know how having a close friend go in when you've already been there feels and it can bring up the past shit. You remember what it was like and where you had to be in your life to get there and it's hard. Old habits can come back to try dealing with that but they don't have to stay.  Do you have anyone like a therapist or a counselor to talk to? Having a good outside opinion can help a person through those times. Even a close friend to listen and spend some good time together can make it easier.

It was like one day a switch flicked in my brain. I just didn't want to be the person I was becoming. It got to the point where I hadn't left my house for about two months so I just decided I needed to get out. I walked for miles and somewhere along the way decided I wasn't going to wallow in it anymore. And that's when I stopped. I don't know how to get that feeling back and I wish that I could.

It's natural that you would want to try and handle your problems yourself and you couldn't have seen this coming. So forgive yourself and try to reach out to someone who'll be able to support you through this. Do you have any friends/family members you can confide in without being judged?

I've got a really close relationship with my mother, but I know she sees any form of mental illness as a huge weakness. She just can't sympathise in any way. The small amount I did tell her about depression didn't go down well. She means well but if anything she will make it worse. I've got through it on my own before I just hope I do again."
selfharm,37hgzy,tommo3472,4,Wed May 27 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"Check out the wiki and other posts on this sub. There is a lot of great advice out there.  Do you have any contact with a therapist, or a close friend who you can share this with? It is important that you tell other people how you are feeling.  As for the self harm, I only started quite recently. Personally I find that it doesn't hurt much at all, and it makes me feel relieved and good afterwards. It is completely normal to feel that way. You put it best when you said that ""It scares me how good I feel."" I feel exactly the same way.  You will probably end up doing it again; perhaps tomorrow, or next week. You will cut more and more, deeper and deeper. My best advice is that you talk to people about it, on here or preferably with a friend/therapist/doctor.  Please feel free to PM me, and take care of yourself.  EDIT: You're not a terrible person btw, self harm is a pretty common way people find to deal with their problems. You're not alone in this.  EDIT2: Any form of self harm is equally as concerning. It doesn't matter if you have made a few small cuts on your arm, burnt your chest or cut your leg open, self harm is a sign that there is something you are struggling to deal with. So to answer your concern, you should not feel bad for coming here, you should be proud of yourself for seeking help."
selfharm,37hgzy,jjuuuu,1 point,Wed May 27 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"""It scares me how good I feel.""  That's such a good way of putting it. I was only really cutting for a few months this winter, and I never really got to the addictive point, because a) it felt too good and I know that's bad, and b) because it'd hurt my friends/bf to see fresh cuts. But I keep remembering how good it feels and I keep wanting to cut, even when I'm not that upset, even if I'm just vaguely upset. And I don't understand how I can keep wanting to, because I've only gotten the sense of relief and good feelings a couple times."

Don't expect them to vanish or anything, but any redness should go down and it might smooth them out. Most of mine just took time to fade and you can't see them unless I'm sun burned or tanned on my arms."

Then cover with a non stick dressing, and bandage firmly.  If you have no medical supplies, close the wound with whatever tape you have on hand. If no tape, roll up a towel or something, and wrap it tightly over the wound and apply pressure directly on the wound. This is not recommeded though, as unsterile dressings can introduce bacteria into the wound.  If you can see fat or beyond, it needs proper medical attention. If it's still bleeding freely after about 20 minutes of pressure, it needs proper medical attention. If the bleeding is uncontrollable, it needs medical attention immediately."
selfharm,37g52t,Lenaballerina,3,Wed May 27 13:02:05 2015 UTC,Get and use butterfly closures to close the wound as best as possible and put pressure on the wound. Then use superglue or ductape if you have to.

BUT, even still - I am currently 18 days clean of any ""deep"" cut. The behaviours come in waves of strength - and tolerating the urges of them is a part of life - and it is easier to tolerate those urges than it is self harm - because self harm is significantly more satisfying."

For the most part I rely on people minding their own business about it, which most do. It is a coping mechanism I have trouble finding something that eclipses the relief I get from it.

After a trip, the anxiety melts away and I feel happy for days, the world feels happier and brighter and I stop wanting to hurt for awhile. But I wouldn't recommend this for everyone.

I work at an indoor pool and on really cold days we can sometimes go hours without getting any patrons.  On one such day my coworker and I got to swapping stories about our various scars.  He told me about the time his friend's pet snake bit him and I told him about the time I tried to bungee jump from a tree using rope instead of bungee cords.  We kept going like that for a while, then he said, ""See these ones?  I got these by tripping and falling on the grill at a fourth of July party.  When I got back to school in September everyone thought I'd cut myself.""  He pointed to a set of three parallel lines that, healed up, were hard to tell apart from deeper knife wounds.  I laughed and held out my arm.  ""Well look at these,"" I said.  ""These are from when I actually did cut myself.""  He gave me a weird look and then laughed right along because really, what can you say to that?  ""I once cut my hand trying to slice a bagel...""  he continued, and we kept talking for a while until a swimmer finally came in and we had to split up to watch the pool.  But for that brief exchange, self harm was just another story to be told, another scar to chat about to fill the hours in the day, and I have never experienced any other conversation quite like that."
selfharm,37afyx,headsburg,3,Tue May 26 04:22:12 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell you if it's something you should be worried about, as only you can really be the true judge of whether it's going to be a problem for you or not. I would say though that those things could be a potential early warning sign of how your mind wants you to deal with stress, and that it is something you might want to keep an eye on.  Try and evaluate what's been stressing you out a lot in your life lately.  Has something changed drastically or suddenly?  Do you have any control over any changes that might have, or could occur?  Do you have a lot of family/friend support in place to help you out when you are feeling stressed?  Do  you have any outlets to help keep your mind off the ideas of self harm?  Working out, Video Games, Hobbies like Music or some form of crafts are all great ways to move past intrusive thoughts.  There's also other tons of social actives that you can look into either in real life, or online if you feel like you just need to be around people more often.  Sports, DND, Concerts, Conventions, etc.  I can't really say for sure whether those thoughts are ""normal"" or not.  From personal experience, I have them, and often also have suicidal thoughts on a regular basis.  I am seeking help and taking medication as a result of those thoughts because they were burdening me enough to seriously effect my Quality of Life.  If you feel like they are starting to become unmanageable, it's something to consider.  If I had to guess, my uneducated opinion would be that most people have at least some amount of violent thoughts or urges occasionally.  I don't know how often it would be for a ""normal"" person, but if you find it taking up a majority of your day or that it is making it difficult to concentrate on day-to-day activities, it might be something you want to look into.  If nothing else, I would bring it up to someone you can trust.  A family member or a friend.  You could try something along the lines of ""I've been upset lately"", blah blah blah, talk about why, see how they respond, ""Yeah, I've actually noticed it's also started to include daydreams a little bit.  Nothing too serious, but it's just been different, you know?"" (or something like that).  Basically try and ease them into the concept and see how they respond.  If you want to do it more passively, you could try something like have them read over a short story you wrote about a character dealing with the thoughts you were talking about.  Maybe leave a computer screen on a website listing the symptoms of what you've been describing and leave it up for your parents to find.  There's decent alternative ways to approach it, if you feel it might be too awkward to talk about head-on."

Thoughts alone aren't necessarily bad, but if something else is happening then those negative thoughts can put you in harms way.   Hope this helps. If you need any advice or help, just ask. This community is really awesome and everyone always has good advice."

If it did, perhaps journalling could help sort out some of your emotions.  As for getting closer to God, well the one thing I have had to learn time and again is that God is not going to just magically take the pain away, but he does put people in our lives to help carry our burden. Lean on the people around you. Let them help you through the darkness. I look for songs that express how I feel, and one of my favourites is Plumb. Listen to 'hang on'- I find it helps me."

I eventually got over it when I was sent to the hospital for a week last year, but that doesn't help you at all. What my therapist told me is that if someone cares about me it's their job to worry and it's not my job to worry about them worrying. Your girlfriend obviously cares a lot about you and I know that you hate to worry her, but SH is serious shit and she's gonna worry about you no matter what. I don't mean to say just get over it, but I'm not sure there's a way to get her not to worry.  Ninja edit: also, maybe tell her that she can help by just being there for you when and if you need her and that if you're ever gonna seriously hurt yourself you'll tell her.

selfharm,376li9,Youknow_whatever,4,Mon May 25 08:31:02 2015 UTC,"The rush you feel is basically the same that drug addicts get. When wet cut, we get a mad rush of endorphins.... Over time, we build up tolerance to it so it requires more damage to elicit the same ""rush""  Do this for me... Pause for a moment and consider what your younger self would say to you if you were to meet/see her now... think through how that discussion would pan out. If you want to, try and write a letter to your future self (like 15 years in the future) explaining what motivates you now and how you feel and what's going on in your life. It's a really good way to get some different perspectives of yourself.   FYI, there are other ways to generate endorphin rushes in the body. Other ways to achieve that release.   One way to achieve the same rushes, is to cut down on the harming so you body adjusts to less endorphins.   Alternately, I very very very strongly suggest that the next time you feel you need to harm, you ignore everything your mind is telling you, and go for a run.  Just once. I'm not asking the impossible, really. Just... Go for a run... And run and run and run until you feel like you're going to fall over. Run until you can't breathe, pause and catch your breath, then keep running. Repeat. Until you are the embodiment of exhaustion.   Just the once.   See how how you feel. See if that desire is still there. I'd love to hear if it is or isn't.   Either way, please take care of yourself. I've been in your shoes (or similar ones) - and you are precious and loved.   You're at a point in your life where you have the power to turn things around before they become life threatening, and eventually evolve into unavoidable things like involuntary hospital stays and scars that will very seriously disfigure you for life.   You have the strength and wisdom to choose another path. My only regret? That I didn't seek help to stop going down my own self-destructive path when I had the chance.   Sorry for rambling. It's been a very long day.    Don't hesitate to message me if you need anything or want to talk through anything at any time.   Please take care."

My friend, how old are you? I hope you don't feel humiliated by there precautions. Your parents clearly care and are worried about you. I'm not a father yet, but if I saw my child hurting themselves, i'd struggle to do whats right. Regardless of how familiar I might be with this all.  You can't convince them with ease, you have to to some degree earn their trust back. I'm saying this because, I have personal experience; it's not as simple as trying to reassure them. Reassuring them means nothing to them as long as long as its a risk.  It might take time, it might be hard, but trust me - beyond developing a mutual an open relationship with your parents, you're going to have to earn trust back. You NEED to tell them when you're vulnerable and understand their concerns, our out of love.  Self-harm is a very.... difficult issue."

They don't know me and I'll probably never see them again, so they can think whatever they want about me and it won't affect me in the least.

As long as you fuel your body enough and don't push your body to extreme lengths, of course.   Maybe you should talk to someone at a gym. They have a lot more knowledge about how the body works (and its limits), and are also very used to people using working out as a way to cope with stress."

For now, those things are just staring at me in my closet. I actually don't have anything to cover up my bandaged wrists. My family and friends must not find out about this."
selfharm,374ngf,Da_Being,3,Mon May 25 08:54:43 2015 UTC,"First, I'm sorry that you have so much hatred for yourself.  I struggle with a lot of the same things myself.  We all make mistakes, and sometimes we just want to find any reason to blame ourselves just so we can justify the hate that we have bottled up inside of us.  It can be really hard to forgive yourself, and feel almost impossible to love yourself, but try to let go of those negative feelings.  If you can't find ways to handle it in healthy ways, I would strongly advise you to seek professional help for this now before it becomes a more serious issue.  You stated an interest in wanting to work yourself up to cutting.  This is not a healthy goal to have.  Cutting is not something you should want to do.  It is not going to fix anything.  Please don't do it.  Please tell someone that you are struggling.  To answer your question:  I haven't heard of it listed in most of the common examples of self harm, but I do know that excessive exercise could cause minor or serious damage to your body over relatively short periods of time frame if your only goal is to cause damage.  Doing push ups to say, avoid cutting, might be a healthy outlet in small bursts.  That is, when the urge feels unbearable, you instead pump out 10 or 20 push-up and see if the feeling passed would be a dually beneficial way to combat self harm and keep you in shape.  But doing pushups with the express intent of wanting to feel pain in doing them, and trying to do them just so you feel pain is probably not a great idea.  In my opinion, common sense would apply here: If you have to ask, you probably already know the answer.  Doing excessive amounts of pushups without giving your body time to recover could cause some nasty joint problems, lower back issues and possible tendon or nerve damage.  I'm not a doctor of any description, so I don't know how serious those problems might be.  From personal experience, I've noticed certain problems after doing pushups without the intent that you were talking about, so I can imagine things getting pretty painful pretty quickly if you are trying to make yourself feel pain.  Additionally, you should also be aware that this could also be a possible warning sign of Orthorexia Nervosa.  You didn't really give a lot of info and I kind of doubt that that would fit the bill for you based off the way you were writing, but it is something to keep an eye on. link 2"
selfharm,374ngf,Da_Being,2,Mon May 25 11:08:04 2015 UTC,I don't know if it is harmful but i don't think so...   It should be safe to do as long as you are stretching (for not shortening the tendons).
selfharm,374ngf,-SuicideThrowaway-,3,Sun May 24 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"I think self-harm is actually similar to running or exercising in general. There is the achievement of staying strong or finishing a workout but with exercise it actually feels like an achievement to me and not cutting is just making me want to cut more.  I transitioned from cutting to running because cutting wasn't going anywhere for me and i had to care for cuts for weeks and constantly worrying about getting an infection. (cuts get bigger because the pain tolerance gets progressively higher in a sitting)  With running however the rush is similar to cutting but i have the benefit of getting fit and don't regret it after i do it. For time invested i would say it's the same of about 30 minutes every day cutting and  replacing the bandages or running every second day for an hour.  While cutting more made me feel worse with each cut, running/exercise made me feel better each minute and i prefer it to cutting (looking forward to new shoes!)  If i reflect on it, i think my perception of self harm has changed. Instead of connecting me with like-minded people, cutting socially isolated me, because in my area cutting isn't popular and people don't understand it.  I have met some people online because of it however.   If i would have to choose i would do it again,  but more intelligently and later in my life. (I'm not encouraging anyone to do this) Not on my wrist.   wearing long sleeves in the summer as a guy just doesn't feel right and the last time i went swimming was 2 years ago.  I would love to see you not self-harming and exercising instead, avoiding the social isolation that comes from tell-tale scars on your wrists (how could i be so stupid to cut there?) and getting the self-image related benefits of exercising.  Conclusion: Exercise didn't help me with Depression but with self-harm. In my opinion you are on the right way with exercising as a coping mechanism and i would suggest you take that direction instead of cutting as it is really hard to get out of and often limits you in society, exercise instead and it will provide you with options.  Cutting is a thing you can't take back. Some scars will be there permanently and not everybody can emphasize with depressed and self-harming people, so being a cutter is a disadvantage in many areas like school, work and relationships.  Exercising has cognitive benefits which are good for school and work and provides  benefit to self-image and therefore relationships.  A rational decision would be to take the Exercise option. Sadly i am too late to make that decision.  scars4life  I cannot tell what self harm is like when you are an adult but i imagine it being just a bit less annoying. I would still like to be able to go swimming however.  Now i have to get rich and buy myself a swimming pool so that i can swim without people judging me.  Seriously, don't start cutting, one day it might seem beneficial but i cannot take those cuts back now, even though i am 100% ok with me having them, most others aren't.  I thought i would not do much in the beginning, barely scratched my arm but now the scars are as big as pen/pencil is wide and i see them every day, reminding me that i did this because i felt like i  was not worth anything. Just know that you could do it, if you would like to.  Just a small spark of common sense hit me after my last cut telling me not to do any more, but as you can tell, there are people cutting way worse who have to be hospitalized.  Every cut you can imagine, from 1 inch to 5 inches and bigger, you are able do that and you won't even know that you did it until you lift the blade. The worst part is that there are people trapped in this Addiction for years ( /r/selfharmpics as an example) . Maybe you should compare this to other addictions.  Until i cut, i wasn't addicted to anything before. So i could not emphasize well with smokers and people who drank a lot. But now having experienced a true addiction, i can tell that quitting  is not easy, i think of cutting every day.  It is a terrible idea, i know but if you aren't getting the results i get out of exercise (if  u consider my advice) u could still turn to a less damaging and more acceptable  addiction. (plz don't)  This was hard to write and i don't know if u got anything out of it, just me hoping to prevent you from doing that first cut."
selfharm,374ngf,-SuicideThrowaway-,2,Sun May 24 23:16:22 2015 UTC,":') Thank you! Yesterday I did about 40 pushups (just couldn't do any more) and I felt so furious. Ideas of cutting, bruising and banging my head were all over my mind. So, insead I decided to go out for a walk. Yeah, it was 3AM, but who cares. I just needed to take my time and walk it off. And guess what, IT WORKED. Kinda... After those numerous cigarettes (I know, that I shouldn't smoke, but cutting is even worse) and roughly 5 miles I suddenly didn't feel like harming myself. But as soon as I got back home, things went the old way again.. (I didn't cut, yet... No worries) But I'm still happy, that I got over those stupid ideas, I had that night. It was really hard to get dressed and get out of my house. But I did it and it felt good.  First when I decided to reach out @reddit with my problems, I was like meh... What do they know about me and my pointless life.. But guess what, there are so many people to talk to here and it makes me feel loved again.

It might seem scary and you don't want to make your family/friends worry, but they are not the priority here... you are.   Telling your GP is important because they can get you the specialist help that you need. Are you on any medication?   In the meantime, try not to be too alone. It's okay to lean on your friends and family for support, even if you don't want to discuss everything you're feeling."

I've been prescribed Mirtzapine but due to the side effects of being overly sleepy, my GP decided it would be best I wait until next week (after my exams) to start it so I don't sleep in and miss one.    You don't think it would be a waste of their time just saying how I'm feeling regarding self harm. It's been about 3 weeks since I actually did it because my girlfriend and friends are keeping an eye on me. I've previously had a mental health nurse say because I wasn't actively trying to kill myself I was wasting their time.   I've asked my friend to study with me and I'm trying to get out the house to study."
selfharm,3741j7,esoper1976,1 point,Sun May 24 20:15:08 2015 UTC,"Is there anyway your therapist can work you in sometimes in the coming week? I realize Monday is a holiday, but the rest of the week isn't.  Maybe it might help.  I would advise to be around people as much as possible. Even if it just means doing your studying in the library.  That way, there is less opportunity for you to harm yourself.  As a therapist of mine used to say ""self harm is not a spectator sport"".  Doing things with friends is really great, but even if you can't do that, just being around people while doing your own thing could help.  Also, there is an organization called the Good Samaritans (I think they still exist, been  a while since I've needed this stuff,and they are UK based so I never used them b/c I am stateside).  They are mostly suicide prevention, but they can also help with self harm. They have a website and phone numbers. They are totally anonymous.  It would be someone to talk to at least.  Lastly, if you really can't think about anything else, and are totally consumed, then maybe a hospital stay is a good idea.  You might not do well on your exams if you can't concentrate properly, but if you were in hospital you might be able to get an extension on those exams.  maybe?  Dunno.  I spent three years living in an Residential Care Facility for the mentally ill.  Much of that time, I was consumed by thoughts of self harm,and I had no hope, and I knew if I were allowed to live on my own, I'd go back to my old ways right away.  Eventually, something clicked between my meds and my therapy, and I got mostly better. (I still think about self harm, just not as much/intensely). I have been in my own place almost three years now. Staff comes  a couple times a week to check up on me.  At first, it was two hours every day. Now it's one hour twice a week. So, getting better is possible.  If I could do it, anyone can."
selfharm,372z3d,SByG,5,Sun May 24 11:25:00 2015 UTC,"Oh darlin I know you think you're doing what's best for her, but you're really not. The best way to drive someone's self harm underground and make them hate you simultaneously is to give them rules like you have.  Cutting is a coping mechanism, similar to a pacifier for a baby. The pacifier keeps them quiet. Take it away and they scream until you replace it, or deal with the reason they are screaming in the first place. There is no point punishing them for it, this is what they need to do.  I love my husband. We've been together over a decade. But if he started being controlling like you, and demanding that I throw away my tools, stop cutting, and prove it - well he would be out on his arse until he changed his tune. If you love her, you cannot control her. She's an adult. She has to make her own decisions."
selfharm,372z3d,Lenaballerina,1 point,Sun May 24 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"I understand. As I mentioned to the other response, my mentality has always been a controlling one. Everything must be my way to the letter. I know that it's a problem and I am seeking help for it, but I'm trying to keep it as down as I can as possible.   I am completely new to this, I never saw it in this way that you both mentioned and I certainly need to. The minute that she is able to chat I will be telling her that I won't control her.  The one thing I do want to ask is about the pictures. I managed to get her to stop for 23 days, which is the longest she has ever stopped, the original reason I asked her to prove it was because I said I would seek help for my issues if she lets me try to help hers (Which I know, is terribly terribly wrong and I am so sorry for this), but now it's more of a way for me to know she's safe and re-assure me that she's doing better.   I also don't want to just jump off her back immediately, she could take this as a sign that I'm distancing myself from her, what are your thoughts on how I should go about that?  Thank you for your response it means so much."
selfharm,372z3d,Lenaballerina,3,Sun May 24 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're aware that you are beibg controlling. I would suggest - rather than jumping completely off her back about it, tell her that you talked talked to us and we thought you were being too controlling and ask her what she thinks of that. Rather than you making the rules, come to an agreement together. One that rewards successes but forgives mistakes. Punishment does not work on us generally, but rewards do.  Regardless, unless the cutting is physically dangerous (full thickness, requiring stitches, not being cared for properly, or lots of infections), dealing with the cutting head on shouldn't be your focus. The focus needs to be on the reason for the cutting - the feelings that are overwhelming or cannot be adequately expressed. I don't know of anyone who goes into this just for the hell of it. There is always something underlying that must be dealt with, or one bad coping mechanism will be replaced with another. Deal with that first, provide alternative healthy coping strategies, and the cutting simply might not be needed any more."
selfharm,372z3d,Lenaballerina,1 point,Sun May 24 14:28:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure she would be comfortable with me talking to others about it, I feel like I have no choice though, so maybe if I said that I have been thinking about it and I'm putting too much pressure on her then see what she wants?  I have been dealing with the reasons since day one, I may be all too controlling, but I do assess every detail first, and don't instantly demand it to go a certain way. Unfortunately all I can do is provide words. There are so many problems and difficulties she's facing and the distance makes it impossible for me intervene, it's things that she has to fix herself, and I'm proud of how she has attempted to so far. (as I mentioned, I really don't want to share what the problems are as it's not fair on her, just know it's horrific.)  What sort of coping strategy would you say has helped you or others before, that I could suggest to her?"
selfharm,372z3d,Lenaballerina,2,Sun May 24 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"Talking to her about putting pressure on her is a good idea. Maybe mention the subs here as a place for her to come and talk if she wants.  As for coping strategies, well if I had some that worked, I wouldn't still be doing this nearly 20 years later ;-) just google 'alternatives to self harm' and you'll find all sorts of options. For me personally, removing the source of stress if possible always helps. If not, I either use the five minute rule (can't cut right now, I will wait 5 minutes, then stretch 5 to 10 and so on), or I'll schedule it in for later in the week. I try to journal what I'm feeling and thinking, tease out the thoughts in my head into some kind of coherence. I play a lot of computer games. I spend a lot of time looking at photos of other people's self harm (sometimes that works, sometimes not). I spend a lot of time on r/popping. Amongst all that, I am on antidepressants, and am seeing a counsellor weekly to help deal with my shit. Also, I get lots of hugs from my husband. All of those things help me to some extent. Not completely, I'm still a work in progress, but having someone there for support is great. Not someone who blows in and wants to fix everything, but someone who is patient, understanding, and compassionate."
selfharm,372z3d,Mortress,1 point,Sun May 24 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"At this point I would like to believe you're from the UK too? Off topic but I would like to ask how having a counsellor has helped? I'm more than certain that's the path I will be given soon and would be interested to know if it's something good to work with.  I have also just spoken to her, and she has said that she wants to keep the rules, which scares me a little as I don't know if she wants that or just wants that for me, I have made it very clear that it's her choice and that I won't be mad or upset or anything like that, however she insists on it. The only thing she said is that she wants more phone calls and there's two small bracelets she's worn forever that she doesn't want to take off, so I of course said that's completely fine.   You certainly sound like you're dealing with it really well, it's interesting to hear it from someone in your place, since you seem to have a clear understanding of it. I will always be here to support her and tell her that always, I did blow in and try to fix it all, but now that I know I will take a step back and let her go at her own pace.   Thank you very much for your input, I would certainly be in a giant hole with no ladder without it."
selfharm,372z3d,Mortress,2,Sun May 24 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"No worries. Just remember to always keep the communication open and make sure she is comfortable with what you're both doing. And nope, I'm Aussie, but I've got mates in the UK.  As for the counsellor, it's nice to talk to someone who gets it. Someone who is there only for me, with no agenda, or prior stake in my wellbeing. We just talk about stuff. I can tell her anything without having to worry about how she will react, or if I will hurt her feelings. I don't have to censor. We talk about situations and things that have happened, and she helps me untangle the feelings in my head. I have been to counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists, and with only one exception, I have always found the counsellors the easiest to get along with and the most helpful.  Good luck to both of you. I hope you can both sort your shit out and be happy together."

It can really hurt to be rejected, but every time you are rejected, it opens up a chance for you to fall for someone new.  There's a whole world of people out there just waiting for you out there.  Isn't that exciting?  On top of that, although she might have turned you down, maybe you can salvage a friendship out of this.  Heck, maybe she knows someone that would be perfect for you!  And since she knows you're available she could set something up for you. :)  And to be honest, things could always be worse.  I've been rejected a few times but what's worse is when you're not rejected but rather put in that weird holding-pattern ""I don't know how I feel about you"" thing.  They'll happily use you or call you up when it benefits their own little world, but will have next to no interest in any kind of commitment with you if they don't get something out of it.  That's why I really appreciate directness of being shut down.  Even if it hurts now, it's the truth.  It's plain as day and there's no ambiguity.  You don't have to deal with that long, drawn out hope that slowly fades into nothingness.  You know where you stand with her because she gave you an actual answer.  That answer totally sucks, but it's an answer, damn it!  I hope you feel better soon."

I know nothing about medications and how it works, the side-effects, etc, so I'm not sure what the right course of action would be. Are you worried about side-effects, or withdrawal effects, from it? Do you think that's possible?  When you use to self-harm, why did you do it? Was it like you are now, or because you'd be upset and were trying to cope?   This being your high point or low point, I think that just depends on you. What you want to do, what you feel like. I hope it can be a high for you, I hope to hear that you do well and can be safe and healthy. Like I said, I don't know much about medication or anything and whether that'd make you shake a lot, so I'm not sure what that would imply. I know I shake a lot, restless legs, really shaky hands, that kind of stuff, but I don't know what it's from, and it might not even compare to you...  But I will leave you with this. Because I'd like to just share something since I asked you a few questions earlier, and I just would feel rude to not let you feel like there's some way you can connect with me.  The desire to cut, without depression, without reason, just for the pleasure of it... It's really, really enjoyable. For me. I hadn't harmed for a long time, but it was such a nice feeling to have again. To have a reason to be responsible (taking care of cleaning and protecting the cuts). The feeling of getting the shower and having the water hit the cuts (oh my gosh, that's the best kind of pain). I'm not sure if that's a reason you enjoy the cutting, but I've experienced that. And I don't want to do it again any time soon, despite how much I enjoyed it. But that was only after I did it that I could build some resolve against it.   What do you think? I probably sound a little like a freak, but you can lie a little bit with this one if you wanna make me feel better :)  Anyways, my head's getting worse. Hope to hear from you, well, not too soon, but soon enough!"
selfharm,36zyns,RubiedCross,1 point,Sat May 23 21:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to have caused that, then. I usually don't write such headache-inducing pieces.   The only withdrawal effect I was worried about was the headaches. I haven't been having them, so to be honest, I'm not worried. I figure that whatever is going on will pass in a week or two. I've looked up the side effects before and the medicine hangs around for 30 days or so after the last pill. It causes some issues, then they go away once enough time has passed.   I SHed because it was how I coped. It was the one control I had, the one thing that I could choose what happened in every aspect. It was my control.   I have restless leg syndrome, oh, undeniably. They always move. I shook long before this medicine and even while on it, just not this bad. I have poor circulation (I am a giant human shaped husk of problems, really). I'm thinking that with the weather being cooler, and whatever is left of this in my system, it's just amplifying the problems. It'll calm down.   I see nothing wrong with that. Each person has their own things that make them feel happy and normal. Who is to decide that SH is worse than exercising, watching television, or any other form of ""unwinding?"" It's all dependent upon how you look at it. So no, I don't think you're a freak."
selfharm,36zyns,RubiedCross,1 point,Sun May 24 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, it wasn't the piece that caused the headache, it was another long post I had made earlier, no worries!  I'm glad to hear that they go away, and that you haven't been having those headaches.  Mmhm, control is definitely a big part of self-harm. And as you say later in your post, who is to decide that it's any worse than any other coping or unwinding mechanism? I mean, look at the number of people who smoke. That has much more lasting and damaging effects, yet it's a fairly acceptable thing to do (less so now than it used to be, but never stigmatized to the effect that self-harm is). But, I'll save that rant for now. I agree with what you said, and while I sometimes would like to keep up with it, I think that I'm going to hold back for now. Primarily because I'm working in construction currently, so I'll be doing lots of heavy lifting and moving around a lot. I'd rather not risk having any cuts and such open up while at work.   A giant human shaped husk of problems, that's an interesting description. Makes me think of a game I used to play, where there were creatures just called ""husks"". Pretty spooky.

Just because it isn't cutting doesn't mean that it isn't self harm.  Please remember that it can be just as dangerous to bruise yourself purposefully as it can be to cut yourself too deeply.  Bruises that form is largely from blood that is unable to escape through the skin.  The blood that collects forms clots.  Those clots can travel and throughout your body and if it gets to some of your vital organs it can cause serious complications or stop your heart.  It can travel to your brain and cause some other nasty shit...seizures, I think?  I forget the precise thing it can do there, but it is not fun.  It's serious shit.  Please don't do it.  If you are looking for some inspiration on things you can do as alternatives to harming yourself, take a peek over at /r/arttocope.  I know how tempting it can be to harm yourself, and how satisfying it can feel to inflict pain which you feel like you deserve or need just to feel normal again, but it is not worth risking your life over.  You have people in your life that care about you very deeply and I hate the idea of them losing you because of something like this.  If they don't know you have started doing this already, please make them aware so they can help you work through it."

selfharm,36hgvl,catchslip,4,Tue May 19 12:39:09 2015 UTC,"This post of yours is me in the mirror. I've always wanted to be in love. I dated an amazing girl and left her twice because I didn't feel a ""spark"". I was going through a LOT (dropping out of college, diagnosed with depression, diagnosed with ADD, working a shitty job, and she stuck by me the entire time. After I pushed her away the final time she still remains a good friend. I pretty much begged for her to come back-even proposed marriage and she said no. To make things worse, she met a new guy with the same first name as me and she told me that she's never been happier...still a friend though. I don't know if its just me or what but, am I the only one that finds it very hard if not impossible to be friends with an ex? I'm 35 next month, attractive, nice, educated, veteran, no kids, have never lived with a girl or have even been able to keep one for more than a few months...I'm kinda giving up. I might start cutting myself today. I've got hardly any friends. I just feel dead inside."
selfharm,36hgvl,catchslip,3,Tue May 19 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"Fuck, that's hard man.  I had a similar thing happen, minus the proposal.  It was doomed to failure as we had already tried once before in high school a few years prior, we were both way too unstable for each other, but we did it anyway.  Got back together and were trying the long distance thing, state-side/japan.  It was the worst timing too, because two fucking days later I was leaving the country for a training exercise for a month.  I kept telling her that I was probably not going to be able to contact her at all, and she kept saying that she was fine with it and that she understood and shit.  Of course once I got back, and the first thing I want to do is talk to her on Facebook she's...in a relationship with some dickhead.  ""Look, we need to talk.  This isn't working.""  Fucking awesome.  What made it worse was I could feel it coming.  Every day I got off one of those soul sucking 12 hour shifts the only thing I wanted to do was to talk to her and pass the fuck out, but I couldn't.  I knew she wasn't going to wait, and I could feel her slipping away a little more every day that it went on.  I was basically already done feeling bad about it by the time I got back to an internet connection.  I had to completely cut her out of my life, not because I'm still bitter or anything, although I was for about a year after the fact, it's just that every time I talked to her on the phone or whatever I would eventually end up telling her that I was still in love with her.  She could never accept it, or even understand it really.  It was almost insulting.  She would say stuff like ""You don't know what love is.""  And it's like...what can you even say to that?  ""Yes I do!""  What the fuck.  I just realized that as long as she was in my life, I would feel that gnawing hole in my fucking gut every time I saw her picture, or have to pretend to be happy about how great everything was going for her.  It's not like I wasn't happy for her, it was just one more reminder that I would never be a part of it.  I really hope that you don't harm yourself.  It can be really hard to keep fighting, but if you have made it this long without it, you can make it a little longer.  If you haven't already, try and reach out to the VA.  I've been seeing a few doctors for some of the stuff I've been going through, and although my psychologist is a fucking moron, my psychiatrist is awesome.  I think there's a few more psychologists I can try at the facility I'm going to before having to try a different base or something through my insurance.  If you do try and get help but aren't feeling it, don't be afraid to say so.  Some of the VA sucks dick, but most of it isn't as bad as people make it out to be.  If you ever feel like you need to talk about some shit but feel like you're surrounded by too many teenagers on on this subreddit or don't want to have to explain what the fuck an MOS is, don't be afraid to give /r/Military a try.  There's a couple of jackasses over there, but for the most part they're pretty cool and understanding when you're struggling with shit."

selfharm,36hgvl,greatgatsbys,2,Tue May 19 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"Hey- dont lose hope. I met my fiance in college freshman year. I have the same problems as you: i get jealous very easily, im clingy and needy, i need constant reassurance etc. What ive now realized is i just havent been able to trust anyone enough. Hes known about all my problems since basically day one and instead of running he has worked with it. Well just be lying down or watching tv and hell look at me and tell me im beautiful and how much he appreciates me. He goes out of his way to make sure im comfortable. When i hurt myself hes never agry, he understands its a coping mechanism and i work my hardest to be better. You mightve seen my post on valentines day where he cleaned and bandaged them for me after we had a fight. It may be a flaw to have trust issues but when you find someone willing to work with it the clinginess creates a truly unbreakable bond - its both a gift and a curse. You just have to meet someone willing to understand and who loves you enough to support you no matter how youre feeling. Just make sure when they need you they have your complete attention and respect; you have to give back. I would have panic attacks over the thought of previous boyfriends cheating or leaving or disrespecting me. now we spend the summers apart (im still in college, we live six hours apart) and those thoughts never cross my mind. edit: i also joined a sorority to help me with my awful social anxiety. Its been a year and im finally comfortable with the sisters. Youre a much better person than you think and people value your voice. the sorority was both the best and worst decision ever, because the anxiety when first joining and acclimating was awful; but ive learned to value myself more and interact with people better. Sometimes you just need that push."

I feel like some of the people I have been with probably could have been a bit more understanding (well, you know, if I had bothered to be honest about it) but I think the part I took the most away from what you said was probably about having to give back.  Sometimes when I would be feeling upset or vulnerable, the people I was with could tell and would try to help me through it and I just...I don't know, I can't explain it.  It's like there was this anger building up inside of me and I just needed to smash something that I cared more about then anything else.  It's like I felt the need to hurt someone who cared just because I knew I could, because they saw me when I was weak.  Just stupid, petty shit.  I think that maybe if I focus more about being more open and honest with my feelings that maybe things wont go as poorly, if there is a next time."
selfharm,36hgvl,littlewarrior7410,2,Wed May 20 03:04:19 2015 UTC,"It's kind of rough because I feel like I'm always hiding 99% of myself from them because I don't want to burden them (or they don't want to hear it) with my depression or self harm or anxiety, so I just hold myself back.

I would usually mention some of my previous scars, but always tried to make them believe that it was no longer a factor or anything, even if I felt the urge really intensely at the time.  I actually hid a lot of my feelings.  I'm a man, and they shouldn't have to see a man weak.  I should be able to protect them.  Blah blah blah.  It never worked out well.  Even when they'd break up with me, I could never cry in front of them.  It was like...it was like I couldn't let them win.  You know?  It's like even if they hurt me inside, I could pretend that everything was fine and that I didn't care.  For me, it's been increasingly difficult to be able to trust people, especially people that I find attractive, as I have made some...really poor choices in the past and had really shitty things happen as a result.  But I hope that I am able to find someone special enough to let in on all of that shit.  I hope that you do too.  Seriously.  You sound very much like myself in certain ways, and I hope that someday you find someone who is worth the time and effort.  No matter what happens, or what you tell yourself I hope that you remember that you are worth it and that you are a good and kind person.

It's really difficult, whenever someone sees my scars I always tell them it was a past thing and pray they don't see the fresh cuts. I understand the not being able to show weakness thing - even as a girl I always toughen up and just act cold and uptight when people really hurt me as a defense mechanism because I despise showing weakness and admitting defeat in a situation. I'm sure you'll be able to find someone one day, everyone will eventually :) Thank you for your kind words.

There is someone out there who is right for you, who will help you grow as a person and as half of a relationship. That person is waiting for you and you just haven't found them yet. Don't stop looking by any means.   Me? I don't tell people. That's my rule. A few people at my old school found out and I felt constantly uncomfortable and those relationships broke down / weren't good in the first place. I'm in a different school now and the only people who know are teachers. I have close friendships and I have a great group of friends but I don't want to share that part of myself. Wait, scratch that. I can't share that part. It will make everything different, I'll be judged even if they try not to. I'm very academic and people think I'm funny, but I have awful social anxiety and I can't wear short sleeves because my arms are scarred badly. I have the person that I present to others, and the person I really am. So far, only I know that person.   I live in hope of finding people who I feel able to open up to. I've never voluntarily told someone, and I hope that changes. I hope one day I'm strong enough to feel like I'm more than the scars, more than the dark days. I want a partner and friends who will accept me fully. Don't ask me how you know if someone's that trustworthy person, I have no idea. I just want it."

I often feel “empty.” My emotions shift very quickly, and I often experience extreme sadness, anger, and anxiety. I’m constantly afraid that the people I care about will abandon me or leave me. I would describe most of my romantic relationships as intense, but unstable. The way I feel about the people in my life can dramatically change from one moment to the next—and I don’t always understand why. I often do things I know are dangerous or bad for me, such as driving recklessly, having unsafe sex, binge drinking, doing drugs, or going on spending sprees. I’ve attempted to hurt myself, engaged in self-harm behaviors such as cutting, or threatened suicide. When I’m feeling insecure in a relationship, I tend to lash out or make frantic gestures to keep the other person close."
selfharm,36hgvl,Rach0,2,Wed May 20 02:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yikes, a lot of that hit the nail on the fucking head for me, reckless driving especially.  I've only done it a few times purposefully that I can recall, but sometimes when I would feel like there was basically no reason to continue breathing I'd jump in the car, get it up to about 80mph on the highway or 60 on some backroad, put it on cruise control, close my eyes and take my hands off the wheel and count to 15.  If I grabbed it again or felt scared, I wanted to live, if I didn't I didn't.  I'm glad I did.  Quick side story about BPD: I actually just recalled a memory that I had at about the age of 19...I had been researching some of this early on and I remember having an especially nasty fight with my mother that devolved into a screaming match when I tried to bring up BPD after reading about it on Wikipedia (the bastion of all accurate information and knowledge!) and how I seemed to have certain symptoms in common with the general description of it.  Her response was something to the effect of ""That's a bad illness to have, so you don't have it.  Also, therapy would cost too much money.  Do you want me to be stuck in low income housing forever?!""  Ahh...nothing like arguing over health care due to cost.  Thank fuck we don't have Universal Healthcare in this country, otherwise I'd have no neat stories to tell!  Anyway, I try to avoid any type self diagnosis as a lot of clinical mental disorders can be painted in very broad strokes but be meant for very specific things or personality types.  Also because it annoys the fuck out of me to hear people talk about how ""totes OCD they are today"" when they've never spoken to a professional about it or had to plan leaving the house 10 minutes ahead of time everyday because of the rituals they had to go through to get out the door...buuuut that's probably something I should bring up at my next appointment.

Forgetting things doesn't necessarily mean you don't care, everyone forgets things at times.   As for cheating, let's be honest, it happens. It sucks, it isn't a positive, but it happens. I've done it, and I hated myself over it, but it all turned out okay in the end. I'm still with the same person, and things are going extremely well for us.

Like you, I never thought of those two as self harm since I thought SHing was simply cutting yourself. I'm not sure why but I know now.   Though probably not as bad as cutting since they do leave any scars or signs of damage (except the bleeding forehead) it is still bad since it's a self-destructive behavior. I still do it though, maybe because I get some satisfaction out of the temporary pain/sting or I feel as I deserve to be punished. I also sort of talk down to myself but it's more of me pointing out facts (about myself or my behavior) than my inner mind conjuring insults or something.  I'm a lonely person so it's tough keeping those thoughts at bay and resisting the urge. Not the best advice but what helps me some of the times is to just distract my mind from certain thoughts by watching a movie, playing video games or just about anything that requires me to think.  I still struggle with it heavily so I'm not the best person to give advice but I hope it helped some.   Wishing you the best!"

For example you used to get punished this would link bad moments with punishment creating this permanent link in your head that your fore fill through self harm.

I told her years ago about suicidal thoughts and we went to the hospital but because they were overcrowded, they told me they weren't worried that I was going to actually act on it and that they were concerned that I'd get ""more ideas"" from being in there. My mom didn't sleep that night and thank god she started monitoring me when taking my medicine. So I already know how she'll react.  Thank you so much for the response"
selfharm,36918h,esoper1976,1 point,Sun May 17 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have a therapist?  Perhaps you could start by asking to see a therapist, and then talking about this stuff with a therapist, and the therapist can help you talk to your mom. Of course (at least in the states) if you tell a therapist you are suicidal, and they believe you might actually make an attempt, that is one time they are allowed to break confidentiality.  They aren't allowed to tell someone else everything you've told them, just the suicidal part, and just enough to get you to a safe place so you don't hurt yourself.  The hospital really isn't all that bad.  Some are better than others.  The bad ones are mostly just boring.  There isn't much to do, the staff doesn't interact much with the clients and there aren't really any groups or anything to help you get better. It's more of a place to keep you safe until you can do that on your own.  The good ones have lots of groups--group therapy, arts/crafts, coping skills type groups, maybe an exercise group/recreation group. (if they have exercise machines like bikes and treadmills, you will exercise, otherwise you'll probably just play cards or something).   So, the worst hospitals have no groups, the best ones have lots of groups and most are somewhere in between--a few groups, but lots of independent/down time as well.  You will see the psychiatrist once a day, and sometimes he can order individual therapy for you with a social worker or other therapist depending on how the hospital is set up.   The other patients will also play a big role in your stay--especially if there are no groups.  Hopefully there will be some you get along with that are with it enough to play cards or board games with, or just hang out and talk with while watching T.V. or something.  I have always gotten just as much help from other patients as I have from the paid staff when I've been in psych ward.  Another option, if you can be reasonably safe outside a full hospital setting, but still need more support than once a week therapy is a day treatment program.  These programs are pretty much all groups.  Some of them are morning only, and some are all day.  Either way, you go in the morning, attend all the groups they have for the day and then go home.  I used to start in the hospital, then transition to a day program, then cut back on the number of days a week I went to the day program, and then go back to my regular psychiatrist and therapist.  That starting off with lots of care, and then weaning to less care worked well for me.   If you really need the hospital, don't be afraid of it.  Yes, it is scary to go the first time, but it can be a big help. (or it can at least keep you from doing something bad).  If you have a psychiatrist and/or a therapist, I would talk to them about which hospital they recommend and why.  Usually if you have a good relationship with them, you will like the hospital they recommend for you.  Oh, and if you are a teen (under 18), then the hospital will have slightly different rules for you. I have only been hospitalized as an adult.  Depending on whether or not school is in session, and other factors, you will have more rules than the adult ward.  That's just the way it goes.  But, from what I've seen, none of them are too bad--just stuff that's required b/c you aren't an adult yet.  Even with the extra rules, everything I said above also applies."

selfharm,3683n6,-SuicideThrowaway-,3,Sun May 17 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"I've felt the same. I cut myself 87 times at once. I was ashamed after not because I did it but because they weren't that deep. I wished they were all deeper because most of them only bled a little.   That was quite awhile back. Personally, I stick with quantity over ""quality"" of cutting if I do it. They still hurt but they are easier to take care of and heal better. I know scarring is sometimes a thing people who self harm want, but just be safe if you do that. I am not promoting anything, just saying be safe in how you do it if you must."

This is not how your SO should treat it, and she needs to make an effort to support you.  Edi: i mean honestly, if you dont normally wear shorts because of SH, she shouldve been proud of you for overcoming that fear, even if for a day. Not annoyed."

For attention (the one everyone jumps to for why you cut) No shame (not seeking attention but don't care to let it control you) Accidentally    If I were in your position too, I'd be pretty upset. You have no reason to hide them unless you're ashamed or fear people judging you. She probably assumes you'd be ashamed of showing them. That's pretty messed up."

I will have to try the running thing cause drawing isn't working anymore my boyfriend don't like me drawing myself with my scars he always erases them and it is the only way I could try to deal with it is if I can't cut then to draw what I want to do.

selfharm,3655at,secretcrazy,3,Mon May 18 17:50:30 2015 UTC,My feeling is that if counting number of days clean it is best to hold it as a quiet personal achievement to share only with a select trusted few.  That said I don't like counting because I think it puts one in a frame of mind that everything has been undone when you have one slip up. The thing is though that slip up are inevitable.  My feeling is that if you want to quantify these things that a rolling average type things is better. For example having the number of times done in the last 30 days. Every day forward means day 30 in no longer in the count. Then you can track improving your rate over 30 day clusters.  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average
selfharm,3655at,blumune,2,Sat May 16 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I usually don't count because counting doesn't prevent me from relapsing, what ever happens happens. But a friend had asked how I was doing and I counted and I was kinda proud. My other friend had texted me the same night also asking how I was doing (not about cutting but generally) and I shared my 5 day achievement. I guess that was the mistake there. He didn't ask about the cutting specifically so I shouldn't have brought it up. I won't be doing that again.   Edit: Like I said I don't like counting but I really like the rolling average idea. I'll pass it on to my friends who count. Thank you!"

I feel like a deserve it because I'm not taking care of my mom as well as I should and I have other problems. I do my best but I only make $10 hour but I'm addicted to pain pills which always has money tight. I hate myself for that but its not as simple as just stopping when you can't physically function without it and you have to work. I've been on them since I was a teenager and I'm 24 now. My mom used to give them to me, we share them now, but it was still my choice to start. I know its an excuse but its more complicated than people think, I feel.     My dad won't take care of my mom so I have to. She's disabled and I can't just leave her to fend for herself. We've always been very close and now that she's getting older I'm starting to obsessively worry about her health. She gets mad at me when I act depressed, but I know its frustrating. I'm crippling myself with guilt and anxiety.     She was mad at me today for being depressed and said something about living with my aunt. The first thing u thought of was ""I could finally kill myself"". I want to die, truly, I just can't. I just hate myself so much, its crushing. I think I hate myself more than my dad and that's saying a lot. I'm terrified of being like him so that's where a lot of the self punishment comes from. I'm very lonely, but honestly, how could someone that messed up ever expect to make friends, let alone maybe a girlfriend. I don't even consider that."

I don't really have any advice, other than that it is important to remember the urge to harm is one that usually passes. It does return from time to time, as you said, but over time, it will hopefully become less and less, and weaker and weaker. One thing that has been useful to me is the 'Hurt Yourself Less Workbook'.  Sometimes I am also tempted to go back to my worst, too.

I submitted a post about it on /r/MadeOfStyrofoam if you want to take a look.  Things can be trickier for people under the age of adulthood, but basically:  As long as you don't pose a serious and present threat to either yourself (suicide, or SH bad enough to lose body parts) or if you present a threat towards someone else then they basically just let you walk.  It can vary from Dr. to Dr., but as long as you are generally stable enough to say, drive a car or hold a conversation, you should be fine.  If you feel that you want Hospitalization, bring it up and see what they think of the idea.  Remember, they aren't mind readers so a lot really depends on how much you choose to share.  Additionally, they might recommend Hospitalization, but it will probably only be hinted at if they think you are cutting deep enough to see arteries and shit.  I was worried that the second I brought it up they were going to like, lock the door and fucking tackle me or something.  My Dr. basically just asked why and wanted to know if I was planning on killing myself that moment.  I explained why and said no and he took me at my word.

If it were for attention seeking, I would not be scared to tell my close friends in order to seek help.  People do not understand the true complexity of the situation, and it is sad.  As for how to bring it up, I would tell the people you most want help from.  If they say things like that to you, direct them to this subreddit.

selfharm,363noa,fireballOC,2,Fri May 15 21:45:39 2015 UTC,"It's just part of the stereotype, really.  I'm 28 and self harm.  I don't consider myself to be a child buuuut I guess my opinion is a bit skewed! :)  I would say that part of the problem is that it can be hard to tell the difference between attention seeking and self harm, and how they can actually go quite well together.  Some self harm for release, some do it to feel, some do it for control or as self-punishment.  Sure, some do do it for attention but the mere fact that they are able to cut open their own flesh and get away with it for extended periods of time before anyone notices should underline just how little attention they are getting at that moment.  I don't think that there should be a negative connotation associated with attention seeking (within reason).  I would argue that most of the things that humans do is specifically for attention from others (fashion, political views, musical tastes, etc.) or to seek validation and self-satisfaction from the crowd.  We're social animals, damn it!  Attention is our fucking bread and butter!  To answer the second part of your question, none of my current friends know that I do.  One knows that I'm going through a rough patch but I haven't explained how I'm coping with things.  The others are entirely clueless, aside from long visits to the bathroom at work.  It's funny; I'm scared to tell them for the same reasons that you listed in your post.  I don't want to be the center of attention.  I don't want to be the drama queen of the group or seen as some fragile butterfly.  Just because logic might say that I should be fine with telling them doesn't mean I'm not immune to the fears the stereotype brings too!  So how can you tell them?  Well...do you have to?  Part of me says that maybe they were just joking around, but if the weren't, eh...fuck it.  Does it matter?  Is it something that they absolutely need to be aware of?  If you feel that you can trust one of them implicitly, you could float the idea to them ""Hey, yeah...I used to do that.  But not for attention."" and see how they react.  If it isn't all doom and gloom you could mention that it is also something that you are still dealing with.  If nothing else though, if you do have a conversation about it, I would just make a point to mention to them that it isn't a suicide thing.  Aside from attention seeking, I always worry about the ""Oh, so you want to die?!?!?!"" reaction that people would occasionally give me when I was more open about it.  If they are willing to hear you out or at least accept that you aren't doing it for attention, they should be able to understand that you aren't doing it in hopes of dying either, otherwise you wouldn't be telling them."

So this is for OP, as after reading your comment I was feeling a little uncomfortable.  Not all adults have learnt ""better"" coping mechanisms. It is not often taught by our parents, not taught in schools, not taught to us by our peers. This is why a huge amount of adults cope ""immaturely"" through alcohol, drugs, abusing their children (or putting their emotional problems on them), through aggression, through self harm, through over eating, etc.  Basically what I am saying is, the majority of people I've met, and have seen, and heard of - all have their own coping mechanisms and not all of them are very healthy. It is sad that alcohol abuse and overeating are more socially acceptable - even though both are just as damaging.     Now to address your question. I have friends who know about my self harm. We went to a cabin, met their friends of friends, drinking, having fun - really chill night. It was Summer, so I took off my jumper (exposing self harm marks on my arms). Even though 6 of these people know me, know my scars, can see my scars - they still joked about self harm being ""emo"" and ""childish"" - I didn't take offense, as I know they didn't mean anything bad towards me. They love me, they worry and care so much for me. But they just use ""cutting"" as a joke, the same as people use ""gay sex"" and stuff as jokes. Is it right? Probably not.

And, if one person says ""I have an alcohol problem"" and another says ""I have a self harm problem"" the latter is less socially acceptable. Which adds to the reasons why it's hard for us to seek help.   I think you took me wrong. When I explained about the jokes my friends made - I wasn't hurt by it, as I knew it wasn't directed towards me. So I don't expect people to think about me. I'm not a cotton bud.

You don't have to ""flaunt"" it. I would take a more serious moment, or wait until a relevant question is asked and then say something like.. ""I think you should know I've had issues with self harm in the past, I'm mostly past it but sometimes problems resurface."""

selfharm,362gh3,betheguy,2,Fri May 15 15:13:54 2015 UTC,"That's awful that your job is intolerant. It's taking our species way too long to realize that people are people and it's really no business of theirs what your gender or sex is unless you choose to share that with them. People just feel the need to categorize everything to understand it and fear the things they don't understand. But it's as simple as this: nothing is simple, there are exceptions to every rule, and there are absolutely no absolutes. All of that is contradictory, but so is life.  I'm sorry that you have the craving to cut and that you have to hide so much (your scars, your identity) to appease those who can't accept the things around them. But it'll be ok, you have people who love you and safe places to go when things get to be too much. I'm glad you're making the transition and get to be who you feel you need to be. You are an amazing person! Make sure you're taking care of your body and your mind and give yourself the respect you deserve :)"

selfharm,362gh3,-SuicideThrowaway-,1 point,Fri May 15 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. I guess some people feel it threatens some belief of theirs or that it will somehow affect them or even contort truths or ideals to find a reason it is bad simply because they don't believe in it. People misconstrue information and feelings they don't fully understand and default to ways they think will deal with it which is often ludicrous. From the confusion stems frustration that they can't compartmentalize something and from that frustration comes anger that they take out on others because it seems like the only way to take care of the ""problem"" when in reality it's something they have to think over and learn to understand. It's a defense mechanism against not knowing and it's one that doesn't solve anything, simply covers it up with more issues. Similarly to why we cut. It's not good for us, it's hard to understand why we do it, but it feels right in the moment. The difference is that we take it out on ourselves rather than others. I have a friend who was homophobic because he was raised that way and he knew it was wrong to feel negative toward homosexuals and didn't want to, but he couldn't help feeling it inside which frustrated him that he didn't have control over his feelings and made him angry. The way he got over it was by facing it, recognizing where the homophobia came from and eliminated that thought process. This was aided by the thought that he cared for people who eventually came out of the closet and that they were still the same person so it wouldn't make sense to care for them any less. Oftentimes, to get past something that makes you uncomfortable for whatever reason, you have to make yourself uncomfortable. It gets worse before it gets better and all that. For obvious reasons, people don't like to do that so they leave it and nothing gets fixed. It takes a lot of strength and willpower to change things, but it can end up saving energy in the long run. Since the future is unknown, people don't like to take that gamble and care more about what's happening in the present so a lot of discomfort for unknown gain (for you or others) isn't a very appealing offer. It would be nice if we could set that aside and trust in what leads to more positivity and kindness to others. Our egos and desires get in the way of that though. It takes time and it takes being ok with not knowing and I hope that others can think critically about societal standards before jumping on the bandwagon, but until then, we can offer them perspective without anger, show kindness to others, understand the different experiences that alter people's behavior and find ways to work around it, and hope that we are shown the same respect. That's just my opinion however, yours will be different, and I accept that."

I wish I hadn't started but it feels like once I hit a certain point it was just a natural progression and there wasn't much choice at the time. I had to do something, so I cut. I really feel for other people dealing with this, more so even than fellow drug addicts, because I know how much pain it takes to get here. Everyone in this sub is hurting somehow and hurting bad."

selfharm,360upz,ilikepickless,2,Fri May 15 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"I've almost been homeless a lot recently, I know how terrifying it is. If its your life situation that you feel is primarily overwhelming you and pushing you to cut I can tell you what helped me...     When I get overwhelmed I try to go day by day. I don't mean it like the cliche but really only worry about what you CAN do today. When it comes to housing, jobs, etc I think it helps to make physical written plan. I.e. today I'm going to search craigslist, then I'm going to physically go to apply for a job or apartment. One thing a day is better than a day or just self loathing. This is stuff you CAN accomplish and are allowed to feel good about; feel like you're making progress. Only worry about what's on today's list, not this week or months list. You searched the internet today and found some prospects, good! You don't deserve to be cut today. Follow up on even just one tomorrow and feel good then too.      I know God isn't for everyone and that's ok, but God is a big deal for me and the only reason I'm alive. So if you're a person of faith, make sure you have faith. If you do your part God will take care of you. You're not damaged to God. No matter what you've done or been the victim, of God always loves you. If you try, you don't even have to do your best, God will cut a path for you. Sometimes its scary because all signs point to homelessness or worse but at the last second he will come through for you if you have faith, I promise.     I know you're in a great deal of pain and you think you're close to breaking. I've been there, I started cutting because I was testing ways to kill myself. I've had belts around my neck too. Then on the day I got my eviction notice I got a call back for a job. The only job I managed to apply for. But I did something at great effort due to my depression and God took care of the rest. Don't worry about 2 days, a week, month or year from now. What can you do today? That's your only responsibility because its all you really have control over.       If you think you're going to cut make a post here first. Talk to God about it. If you do cut, forgive yourself. If you're trying not to, you only have to not cut today. You can cut tomorrow, just try not to today. I don't know you but I care about you and so do others here."

selfharm,35y1s3,jetsam52,2,Thu May 14 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah knife play is the act of doing it.   Do they have to be self harm scars or is he just turned on by scars? From your other responses it seems he's more interested in the cuts and scars than the act of self harming.   If it's just self harm scars and he himself isn't a self harmer, that's a little worrying and probably not someone you want to get involved with. He's probably a great guy but it wouldn't be great to be around someone who encourages you, either directly or indirectly to self harm.   However, if he said this after you told him you were a self harmer he may be saying it so you don't feel ashamed of them or worry what he thinks.   BDSM and fetishes in general are very complex and diverse. I've had a blood fetish before I was even old enough to get horny, before I started hurting myself and while they are connected in some way, they are still separate things.   He may just be into scars/deformities/irregularities, which I totally get, that's all about uniqueness. I once slept with a guy who had a broken collar bone that never set right and I implored him not to get it fixed.   But whatever you do, make sure you feel comfortable. Okay? I know I wouldn't like the thought of someone getting hard over my scars, they're mine, not his and they are reflections of when I felt awful, especially if I didn't understand why. I would just jump to the conclusion that he's getting turned on by misery and I wouldn't want that, at all."
selfharm,35y1s3,DeidaraKoroski,2,Thu May 14 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Oh alright.   He specifically said self harm (like I said, light self harm, never anything that would need stitches or such). I don't think it's other scars but I didn't specifically ask.   Oh he's not encouraging me to do it, he just wants to see pictures of what I've got, and trust me, I would never self harm by request of someone else, nor would I talk to someone who tried to make me cut.  He did say it after me mentioning cutting but he also said he'd gotten turned on by seeing someone's self harm scars at work so I don't think it's for my benefit.  I don't mind his being aroused by it, if you've got it use it to your advantage, right? xD To me it's no different from showing other parts of my body and someone getting turned on, as long as they don't have a weird reason for it.  I will continue talking to him trying to figure out why this gets him going, I don't find it off putting as much as curious."
selfharm,35y1s3,DeidaraKoroski,1 point,Thu May 14 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he won't ever ask, and I'm sure if he does you'll be right out of there.  What I meant by indirect was, well let's put it in other terms. Let's pretend I'm into a dude and he's told me that he really digs the colour purple. I'm probably going to wear more purple now, or even dye my hair purple because I know he likes it. Do you see what I mean and why I'm a little worried about a self harmer getting involved with someone who's turned on by scars?   And even if you don't do it for him, when you're holding the blade to your skin and you're in that state of do I/don't I it'll pop into your mind that the person that's currently seeing you naked likes your scars so it doesn't matter that there's a few more on your body. Whereas usually that's the thing that stops me, knowing my boyfriend will see the scars and it'll upset him and I know that's true for a lot of people in relationships.  I know you're not with him, I'm just thinking about the potential future. I don't even know you and I'm worried x)"
selfharm,35y1s3,DeidaraKoroski,1 point,Thu May 14 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yes I see what you mean, I'm very careful about that and if I detect myself doing it I would stop talking to him purely out of self defense mechanism even though it wouldn't be his fault. But I rarely cut anymore to begin with and I'm not a ""heavy"" cutter so it'll be okay I think. Thanks for your concern though :3  Well it's only an online fwb thing so it's not like I'm in a relationship, I think it'd be riskier then, because I'd want to do things for a boyfriend way more than for a fwb you know?

Especially now that a bunch of crazy hurtful things are happening, I think about cutting often throughout my day but I keep telling myself it won't help my problems. It's a bad habit that I rely on to keep myself shut up and away from the world. The thing is, the world is going to keep going, whether you're watching or not. We don't know what kind of life we'll have after this, and I was sick of wasting mine. There's no need to go through life hating yourself and pushing others away, in the end you're only hurting yourself. For what? I'm not trying to demean the feelings of hopelessness or depression that we all feel going through life, but when a person is in a depression they feed off the bad emotions and let themselves waste away. Your brain keeps telling you: ""Nothing matters, no one cares, I deserve this pain and these shitty feels."" I'm sick of letting scumbag brain tell me what matters. I matter. And so do you.   I had to learn to love who I was as a person, accept my scars and my faults. I'm prone to tantrums when angry, stubborn, aggressive and I don't like asking for help, but I did anyway I forced myself to open up, not only to people close to me but to myself as well. I learned that I'm also intelligent, strong, independent, and someone people actually look to for support and advice.  I got kicked out a week ago, my SO is bipolar and is going through an episode, he kept saying he wanted to be alone and things would be easier this way.  This is what bipolar people do, they push people away from themselves because of their illness. I'm finally on the other side of this and let me tell you, it's awful. I feel like my heart was ripped out and finely minced, I never knew hurting yourself could effect other people so deeply.  I'm not giving up on him though. I just hope he comes around."

selfharm,35tyvo,three2em,2,Wed May 13 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"I mostly stopped (other than random singular relapses) years ago. I think there were a few deciding factors. One wound became mildly infected, one was deep enough that I had to seek out medical care as it kept opening, and I realized that my methodical self harm had gotten to the point where I was cutting deeper and more frequently than was perhaps still safe.  Having been institutionalized before (less than great experience) I feared it could land me back in and/or significantly worry my family.  I did what I could to stop and eventually did. I can't say that I never want to, I'm sure that any firmer addict thinks of their past addiction...but it's not something I think would be safe to return to.  Cutting over a tattoo would still be noticeable. If you do want a tattoo try to think of something meaningful to yourself and wait a year. If at any point you don't want it, don't get it."
selfharm,35tyvo,vSatyriasisv,2,Wed May 13 16:41:02 2015 UTC,I feel pathetic for not being able to cut deep I have difficulty getting tools to cut myself with (prizing razor blades out of a razor takes me half an hour at the least with scissors).

selfharm,35tyvo,Kernaghan,2,Thu May 14 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"Saw that it was hurting and worrying the people around me that I care about. Went though an intensive out patient program that really helped me and helped me stop.  Counting the days from the last time I cut has helped me not cut again because as weird as it sounds I don't want to break my record.  I still think of it all the time though and still have my razor blades out if I need to, because it makes me feel safe.  Don't get a tattoo just so that you can cut more, the scares will be more visible then they were before, and you don't want to mess up the tattoo as it is permanent.  If you really want a tattoo thinks about it for a while and get something that means something. I know it is hard to stop, and hard to not start again, if you are concerned about cutting too low and having to wear long sleeves there are other areas that are easier to cover up."

selfharm,35tyvo,dunraim,1 point,Fri May 15 13:10:24 2015 UTC,"It might not show up on a black tattoo, but I hear that can be difficult to cover up scares, so I figured that fresh cuts would be even harder. You would have to go with like a black patch on your arm, but with just black lines and a pattern the cuts will show up in the space between them, and it would be more visible because peoples eyes are drawn to the tattoo.  Just talking about it and being in environment that was more accepting and felt like I belong and could talk about and my feelings with out any judgement helped me a lot. If you have a chance to do one I would recommend it."

She always has to fill out a paper for me everytime I go stating what her recommendations are and any new meds etc.  This is given to the place that works with me (I""m on my own now, but have staff that comes to my apartment a few times a week) so they can keep tabs on when I'm going to the doctor, for what, and what my current meds/medical needs are.   I think at my yearly physical she probably asks about my mental illness diagnoses, but that's just to keep her records current.  If I take any med at all, it has to be prescribed by a doctor (even OTC meds like ibuprofin), and if a doctor tells me to do something for my health, then I'm supposed to do it until they say not to anymore."

Before I got comfortable with insinuating they were SH scars, I would just say ""An accident."" firmly and change the topic. People usually got the hint to move on and respected that.

My current SO understands that he can't stop me, but says that he will do anything to help me overcome the need.

After I stopped abusing anything I could find my emotions came back to me.  Those 2 years that past seemed like nothing.  You have to truly feel your emotions before you can move past them.  It's a good start that you are off the methadone, that's tough to do, props.  And it's great that you want to apologize for how you feel you acted.  You are owning up to your shit and wanting to move forward with your life.  That's some noble and ballsy shit there, keep up the good work and remember that yes, breakups are hard, sometimes we feel like we can never get over someone and that we want to throw our life away and that nothing is worth it, but we can make it out of despair if we just take it a day at a time."
selfharm,35oi4z,amatorsanguinis,5,Tue May 12 06:32:36 2015 UTC,"Something that I have heard that helps is to write her a letter. Say everything you want to say. Apologise for whatever you feel you need to. Handwrite it if you can. Then fold it up, seal it in an envelope, and either send it to her, or hide it in a drawer. What you do with it afterwards is not important, it's the writing it all down. That way whether she receives it or not, you can get out your apology. Then - and this is the hard bit - start to move on. Both of you made mistakes, you are obviously aware of yours, so learn from them and become a better person.  Don't set yourself a timeline for ""getting over"" her. Grief is a process that takes time. But you will be able to move forward. It is possible to move on. Be patient with and kind to yourself. <3"

I'm 24 and I've recently started cutting a lot and I understand the fear of not being able to stop. Sometimes its the only thing that calms me down when I'm really panicked or stressed out. I can't explain it but the compulsion to do it grows. If you can resist it, you should try as hard as you can because it seems to get harder the more you do it, for me anyway. I know how strong the compulsion can get though. It's really scary and my heart goes out to you and anyone else going down this road."

Part of it is the immediate relief but then there are more long term aspects for me like isolating myself and ""proving"" how much pain I'm in. Most of the time the urge comes on fast when I'm really overwhelmed but then times like tonight, I'm not feeling particularly bad but I've been thinking about it all night and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be doing it soon when I get off work. I wish no one had to feel this way but I understand why they do. If you have to, do it where you can hide it. I cut my upper thighs. If you think reaching out to talk to someone when you feel like doing it will help there are a lot of good people in this sub who will listen, me included (I'm just not good.) Also use neosporin or other triple antibiotic, it helps healing substantially and reduces scarring a great deal."

Funny enough, it's exactly where you said. My upper thigh. I cut this one deep, once again on accident. Once it stopped bleeding I put some antibiotic cream on it. I'm not too worried about the scar because in my mind my body is already scarred. It's hard describing my way of thinking to someone who hasn't been through it, but like I also said in my post I've been sexually assaulted three times. The first time I was a virgin (who didn't believe in sex before marriage). So after being told, and now feeling like I'm damaged goods, my whole body feels scarred. So yeah, I'm not too worried about scarring. I don't care anymore.   Thank you again for replying. I didn't know where to post and I had never posted on that subbreddit before.

The blood, the cuts, the pain, the fact I get to pick at i days after, but it's not good for you physically or psychologically.  What you should do is find what makes you want to cut and address those behaviors immediately. For instance, I cut because I don't know how to cope with emotions. So I just cut and it makes me feel better. It's not a healthy solution. If you don't see a therapist, i'd suggest finding one. Alot of them are willing to work with you on a sliding scale or you could even go to some schools and they'll dostudent therapy which is usually pretty fucking cheap. I've heard about 10 bucks  week.

selfharm,35k55f,legittomato,2,Wed May 13 15:24:44 2015 UTC,I know how you feel. My mom is getting too suspicious as to why I've had a bandage on my arm for 2 weeks. So I switched to my thigh. It doesn't feel the same though. It kinda takes away from the relaxation when I have to sit in a weird position.
selfharm,35k55f,legittomato,1 point,Mon May 11 07:03:42 2015 UTC,"This is the same for me. My friends have been wondering why I have a big bandage wrap on my arm and my excuse hasn't been consistent. Especially since one week I was feeling a lot better and they were fading so I was fine with not having the bandage on, but since then I've cut more and had to put it back on and come up with new excuses for why I keep needing one on the same arm. I'm worried they're suspicious but they're also not too aware of my issues.  The main issue with thighs I think is the skin isn't tight. My arms have more nerve endings and a cut there just feels so nice. Thighs have a lot less nerve endings, cuts don't bleed as much, they don't hurt as much, and so I usually end up cutting more or in weird ways to make up for it."
selfharm,35k55f,legittomato,2,Wed May 13 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"my excuse hasn't been consistent.   Oh my god yes. I told people who don't live with me that it was a cat scratch, but since my family wouldn't believe that since it's their cat, I told them it was some sharp plastic packaging when I was taking out recycling.   I've had my bandage on the whole time (even have a tan line now...) except when I sleep with the door closed because it's extremely obvious the marks are intentional (rows of straight lines). But lucky for me it doesn't seem like it's going to scar much.  I agree with the less nerve endings in the thighs/less bleeding, I always wake up with bad mystery scratches on my legs from brushing against something sharp like an open cardboard box and it didn't hurt at all. However I really fucked up because since my thighs are more squishy then my forearm, the same pressure cut way deeper then I meant to. Not that it's even that deep still, but it's DEFINITELY going to scar and I wrote out a bunch of curse words... guess I'll be getting a upper thigh tattoo after it heals... those are still cool right?"
selfharm,35k55f,Chross,2,Wed May 13 15:56:01 2015 UTC,"My god I hope they're still cool because I'm definitely going to need them. One night I was feeling particularly bad, I actually cut the molecular structure of dextroamphetamine into my thigh/hip area. If you don't know, that's Adderall, which I take for my ADHD. And it's the cure to and the cause of all of my problems.  Back to the excuse part, I told my friends that I had fallen off of my bike while biking to class on the lakeshore path, and I fell on my arm, and I was using bandages just to protect against infection. They know me as a kind of weird person who does weird things, so it wasn't all too unbelievable.  Honestly I'd be fine with scars. I hope that in the future I'm going to be okay with admitting that I had problems, and I hope that the people I know then also don't judge me for my past. I'm just not okay with the current marks, the scabs and cuts that are obviously very recent. Those are the ones I have to hide and I hate the chore of it. I've honestly considered finding my skin tone and buying makeup just to be able to cover up the marks."

I said I was keeping mine covered as to not pick off/scratch the scabs which seems to satisfy people. Also, I LOVE scars. But When I started on my arm, I didn't realize I was going to be living back home with my mom and siblings and I don't want them to know/have to explain that because they are still young. If I was still living on my own then my arm would look a lot different.  Edit: Clarity"

I often think people underestimate the body's ability to heal itself. Even plasters are unnecessary for me since the body dries and clots the blood seconds after. It's remarkable how the body is self-sufficient and yet first aid is apparently so needed. In fact, I find plasters to irritate my wound more so than letting it do its thing naturally.   It's like the idea that cutting wrists means you are at risk of death. How stupid do they think the body is? It's so rare that a cut will result in death. A large gaping wound would pose a risk but not a cut."
selfharm,35i6m8,Kernaghan,1 point,Sun May 10 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"Well, in the age of anti-biotic everything, lots of people's immune systems have gotten really weak. Also, in the days when a sinus infection could be a death sentence, weak immune systems were naturally selected against, which again, is less the case today, although our ancestors going through that does mean we have pretty damn strong immune systems.  I, too have a pretty kick-ass immune system though. That said, I still would sanitize blades and the cut itself with alcohol, just to be safe, because however low the risk of infection is, infection happening could greatly increase my risk of exposure as an SH'er.  Also a big part of it is how incredibly misinformed almost everyone is about SH."
selfharm,35i6m8,zelkovafr,1 point,Sun May 10 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"On the point about being misinformed, I could not agree more. It's such a closed off subject, admittedly you can't go prying into the lives of people who cut to find the answer, but education should be there at least. People need to learn more about mental health and the subjects relating to that, if I could put it in the curriculum I would. It's so vitally important and so deeply missed.  I don't want to risk exposing myself to people because I made the mistake of not disinfecting my cuts and having to go to the hospital with an illness relating to that. But at the same time, I'm aware of how unlikely that is. My body has it's own anti-infection system in place and I'm not going to mess with that. It's beautiful."

selfharm,35gzs3,ughmanda,2,Sun May 10 06:58:56 2015 UTC,"Try and think of it from your mother's perspective: it sounds like she is aware that you were self-harming.  She found your gear and was concerned that maybe you bought it recently because you felt tempted.  Maybe she thought you bought them last night or something and were planning on starting again.  She probably didn't want to be an enabler so she got rid of them in hopes that it would deter you.  That maybe you would forget about them entirely.  From a non-SH perspective, this is a pretty rational response and a ""fix"" for the problem.  ....As long as you aren't around any kitchen knifes.  Or bottles.  Or light bulbs.  Or cans.  Or scissors.  Or nails.  Or safety pins.  etc. They find it hard to comprehend that having the very devices that we use to abuse ourselves can also bring us comfort and safety.  It's super unintuitive, but the reassurance in having your go-to gear available but un-needed is an incredible motivator to stay clean.  It's a source of pride, not of temptation and shame.  I would suspect that some recovering alcoholics have similar habits with keeping old bottles around, unopened but there if they do need to relapse.  I could swear that's a thing...but it's also like 5AM here, so I might just be imaging things.  I would try and approach her about it again.  (There is also a chance it might not have been her that took them, by the way.)  Try and explain to her how we can be around these instruments of pain so often, but comparatively speaking, use them so infrequently, if at all.  Hell, show her this post if you have to.

You should explain to her that you are keeping them just in case you need them and they give you a sense of safety and security which sounds a bit odd for a non-SH to understand. To the rest of us it makes perfect sense, I leave my razor blades out in plain sight in my room where I will look at them every day, and I have been clean for a bit now. It is just nice to be able to look down and know that you haven't needed that for X amount of time, but you also know that you still have it to as a backup. Completely understand, and would be just as upset and feel very violated about it as well, especially because you had them in a case somewhere that was hidden, so she was looking for them if it was just a case and not the one they came in.

selfharm,35dcgd,emkelly,1 point,Sat May 9 06:04:43 2015 UTC,"I feel you, the fear of family and friends and how they will feel its their fault. I can't give you a sure fire solution. For me donating blood was something I really wanted to do. So it kept me motivated to not cut as you cannot donate with fresh wounds. It may help to set a goal. Small ones to start. Like one week or two. Self control is like a muscle and you have to work it to fatigue to build strength. Its been nearly a month for me... sometimes I just press a blunt scissor edge or my skin, it doesnt break through buy stings a little. That is a first step. Or maybe every time you feel like cutting quickly start doing sit ups or push ups or squats until you get tired, that may help delay the urge. I wish you all the best! Its hard and most people wont understand but you have to start off small and do it for yourself, or your family. Set goals"
selfharm,35dhg0,MissHeadspace,3,Sat May 9 06:51:12 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a lot of beauty hidden inside them alongside the pain. Why reveal one and not the other? You have things going on in your life and in your head, but just because they're different doesn't mean your fucked up. And just because they're negative and harmful to your wellbeing doesn't mean they'll remain that way forever. You can address the root of your pain and find constructive ways to deal with it rather than destroying your body. And you can talk to people about what ails you if you want help, wearing it on your sleeve, so to speak, makes it too easy for people to pigeonhole you and see the marks on your skin as an indicator of who you are as a person when there are so many other facets that they can't see that are lovely and make up a part of your being that is so much more representative than this dark period. It's important to feel, but respect your feelings, don't force them to impact your body. The scars that result will likely only cause more pain. You will grow from this and it will provide you with perspective to be compassionate toward those who are going through similar things as you are right now, but make sure to show yourself compassion as well."

The letters are what you're focusing on even though they don't comprise the whole image that you are seeing and they really only take up a fraction of the computer screen. It's the same kind of thing with the dark parts of your thought process. The bad seems prominent while the good fades into background noise. Invert that.

selfharm,35a513,Lenaballerina,2,Fri May 8 11:49:22 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, attachment theory (among other things) suggests that trauma to babies can have lasting effects. Adoption is a typical example - child removed from birth parent and raised by other parents - often attaches insecurely to other parents, and develops relationship issues as an adult. This can happen whether the child knows it was adopted or not. Similarly in abuse cases, particularly if the primary caregiver is also the abuser, that can have significant effect on attachment also. Furthermore, babies and young children who experience high levels of cortisol often, due to trauma, abuse, neglect, or even hospitalisation, the stress hormone can actually alter their brain to the point where the child is on alert all the time, and constantly has high levels of cortisol in their system.  Source - undergrad degree in psych and personal interest in neonatal trauma.  Edit- oh and your psych and therapist sound super annoying.

selfharm,35a513,Lenaballerina,1 point,Fri May 8 12:57:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I figured there probably was stuff to backup the assertion, it just doesn't sit quite right with me.  I hate the idea that the actions of others can have a scaring affect on me, it removes a sense of self-determination that I value very highly.  If I were say, missing a leg or something, yeah there's no denying that I would be permanently affected.  When it comes to the mind though, sometimes I feel like things are treated a different somehow and I don't know...taken at face value because it's so much harder to prove to a certainty.  Or at least that's my perception of the field sometimes, no clue if it's actually accurate or not.  Haha, thanks for the vote of confidence on the other front!  I thought maybe it was supposed to be used as some sort of...tactic or something(?) in order to get me to ""think more deeply"" about the statements that I was making.  I don't know.  If that was the case, I found it to be a bit insulting because I already spend a ridiculous amount of time doing so already.  I'm still questioning if perhaps the way I phrased it in the moment, verse the way I perceived myself phrasing it are two different things entirely.  Maybe I was mumbling through the whole thing?  My Psychiatrist did have a rather thick accent, maybe he literally just didn't understand what the hell I was saying but was too polite to say so.  I don't know.  I'll probably give him one more go, but I'm pretty much already in the process of trying to find a new Therapist due to some of the...questionable...advice he gave me about joining sports teams and stuff; it's a battle simply to go to the clinic and speak to him so I can't even imagine what he was thinking when he told me that.

So What I think is that what you've done by writing about it here - is connect to people who are essentially in the same boat, and who are writing a narrative of their experiences and realizations.  The thing about reddit is that it can be a series of realizations, accessible any time and infinitely benefiting each other in the attempt to find meaning in real life, which is not the world in which most people live (movies, entertainment etc).  That being said, I think that having a conversation like this with a great many people has taken me to a level of emotional understanding and depth in regards to seeing the lives of the people around me. Through reddit, I have gained the capacity to speak to people who I never would have understood, but now I have this kind of intuitive sense, perhaps because I am having this conversation a great deal of the time.  My genius has something to do with music but also talking about things that are of great significance, which lie outside of the commonly accepted topics of dicussion.  Generally, it is as if there is nothing to talk about with most people. The trick is to bring your topic to them, usually I talk about things like health with them, because health is actually infinitely complex, - world views, etc. I educate them while also gaining knowledge from their experiences and learning about their lives and relationships, which helps me a great deal."

The size or severity of a person's selfharm doesn't reflect the seriousness of what they're going through and minor damage, from a medical and physical standpoint, certainly isn't any less serious from a psychological one. I hope you're doing ok and that you have someone to talk to irl about what's making you want to harm.  In terms of the cuts themselves, razors are very thin and capillaries are thinner still. It sounds like you're going through the top layers which don't tend to bleed much from a clean, straight cut. The trauma you're creating seals up rather quickly and therefore tends to heal fast.  Wait, are you using an intact shaving razor not a single blade? That's risky in that it's difficult to clean those and they can harbor bacteria which can easily lead to infections. I don't want to advocate a single blade since it's harder to control the depth but be aware that you're taking risks with infections by using them more than once. Ideally all tools would be one use only but some are easier to clean than others.  As kitschy and lame as it sounds, the real damage in selfharm is internal, psychological. So yes, there's unseen damage every time a person does it regardless of how they selfharm. Take care of yourself."

I notice it heals fast, but it stings if I do a long shallow cut. I'd imagine that's because of the most nerve endings being on the top layer of skin.  I'm using a blade that used to be in a razor, but I would describe it as a single blade. An intact razor wouldn't do much except cause small marks here and there, it's designed to protect you from injury, where as the actual blade is just that, a blade. One use only? I've used this blade on three occasions. It's mine. I would burn the potential bacteria away if I were to use it again though. If an infection happens, then so be it.

It will probably make him feel worse when he finds out you did it and didn't tell him, and you could use some good friend support right now. He won't think you're weak. You're strong for reaching out and strong for carrying on.  If you focus on the progress you've ""lost"" it will only make things worse, so just try to do better. You made it three months, you can do it again, and maybe even longer :) Forgive yourself, people slip up and that's ok, but it won't do you any favors to dwell on it. Just recognize that it happened, it didn't make you feel better, and you don't need to go there again. A lot of stuff is going on, but it will pass. Nothing is permanent."

I thought I could reach out... it didnt help... But, the next week, when I reached out again, 4 people showed up to my house to ensure I was okay. They saw my wounds from the week prior and told me they wished I had messged them instead of the others I did.  The fact that I even reached out proved to me that I am capable of weakness and there others who want to be there for me-- they really do care. Knowing that has helped me regain my sense of self. Its been a bit of a month since my relapse (which happened aafter 7 years).  Healing takes time. To reference bill murray...baby steps."

selfharm,350urs,Kernaghan,1 point,Wed May 6 20:55:03 2015 UTC,It's an addiction from many angles. It has the ability to make you think 'I could do worse' or 'I could cause more cuts' and the gain of that adrenalin rush everytime you do it. Like a gambler saying 'I could bet more money' or a drug addict 'I could take a bigger hit'. It's so obvious the similarities between commonly perceived addictions and the act of injuring oneself. The risk factor is there too.

selfharm,34yk9y,nolifepreserver,2,Tue May 5 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"Darling, I'm sorry you had to go through all this. Many people don't understand the manifestations and coping methods of those who have had unfavorable life experiences. And there are people out there who beat others down to manipulate them to suit their own selfish desires and insecurities. If there's an easy way to go about something, people will step on whoever's convenient to get there. But that isn't true for all people. You just have to wade through a lot of pain to find them. But when you do it changes your life. I believe you will be able to get there. It's hard, but you've endured a lot, you're strong, you deserve to cut yourself some slack and surround yourself with people who love you and respect you. This includes professionals; if a therapist or doctor makes you uncomfortable, it's ok to switch or inform them that their approach is inappropriate and damaging. And as far as your weight goes, it's just a number. It doesn't tell you about your body composition or your health. It's more important to get to a state where you feel good and comfortable, not constantly light-headed, fragile, and sick because you're depriving your body of the sustenance it needs to function. And know that there is beauty in everyone. From this post I can see you're a beautiful, caring soul, and you don't need to force your appearance to fit a phenotype that may please others while risking your health. If you have to make yourself sick to attract someone's attention, they're going to be manipulative and damaging, especially if they encourage you to partake in unhealthy behavior. You need someone that cares about your wellbeing. Curves are lovely and there are plenty others who see that. Fat is evolutionarily important in many ways as it helps you absorb nutrients, keeps you warm, and protects you. Appreciate what it does for you so you don't have to constantly put pressure on yourself to avoid it so much. Someone who loves you will want you to be kind to yourself. A good way to find the person that fits that profile is to treat yourself right and love yourself as you are. You don't need to change for someone, you need someone who will love you for all your amazing qualities as well as your flaws. And flaws isn't even the right way to describe them, they're simply characteristics that define you and if they're connected to a lovely person such as yourself, they are lovely, too.  I haven't gone through what you have, but I've had some similar experiences and being able to relate to someone I don't even know can be extremely helpful. We are both still here despite what we've endured and that makes us who we are. That you can remain so kind-hearted while others don't treat you with the same light is incredibly admirable and makes you incredibly gorgeous. I hope you take care of yourself and find the happiness you deserve.  ""how much did this people have to suffer to be able to become so beautiful."" -Nietzsche"
selfharm,34yk9y,FeelOneFeelItAll,2,Tue May 5 17:58:18 2015 UTC,"It breaks my heart to hear how much you've been through.  I hope that you are able to find peace in your future.  I think an important part in being able to move forward with your life is going to have to be letting go of some of the trauma that you have been through.  You don't have to pretend that it didn't happen, or that everything is suddenly ""okay"".  Just accept that you had to deal with a lot of very difficult things way too young and try to leave them as facts of things that have occurred, not as monuments that are there to define your life and be reviewed repeatedly.  (That's just my guess at least, from the way some of this was worded that was the feeling I got.  I could be completely wrong.)  I would ask you to do this:  Who are you?  Aside from the things you have done, or seen, or been exposed to, what makes you tick?  Do you feel that in the face of everything that you have been through, does the person inside of you deserve happiness?  Can you allow yourself to acknowledge what has happened, but still be able to find things of value, of true passion and love in your life?  Do you love yourself?  Can you?  (This is one that I always struggle with the most trying to answer.)  It's okay if you don't know the answers to questions like those.  Hell, it's okay if your answer is ""No"" to most of those questions.  The important thing is to get a feel for who you are.  Understand what motivates and drives you, not what you are running from or what you remember.  Set your goals according to those values and try to find ways to improve the world around you.  It might feel absolutely overwhelming or impossible to find anything to feel good about, but it doesn't hurt to try.  I often obsess over killing myself and one of the tricks that I have to work though it is to focus on very plain, very basic or underappreciated things.  If I am outside, what does the temperature feel like?  Is the wind blowing?  If it's night, I can marvel in the miracle of electricity and human innovation.  If I'm driving I can ponder just how incredible it is that we have made roads that span the world over, that we have means of transportation that are incredibly useful, at reasonable prices, for the general public to use as they please at virtually any time of day, anywhere.  There's countless things to be grateful for, to revel in.  Be thankful that you are alive in this moment and can relate from one human being to another, someone who you have never met, instantaneously through a global network of computers, for next to nothing in monthly costs.  The universe that we live in is stunning in its incalculable complexities, impossible to comprehend in its mysterious beauty and sometimes horribly cruel in its vicious, chaotic nature.  Try and take the good with the bad.  Try and find peace."

selfharm,34y1u0,LetThereBeJohn,2,Tue May 5 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"Also not a professional, but it probably depends on the location, the thickness and sharpness of the implement you are using. There are also other things that can cause easy bruising such as alcohol consumption among other conditions. I have never experienced bruising from cutting itself, but I have bruised around incisions from a surgery. If your cuts are considerably deep that would make sense as you have to press down harder... Do you bruise easily under other conditions as well?  Take care of yourself."
selfharm,34y1u0,FeelOneFeelItAll,1 point,Tue May 5 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"I don't bruise that easily and these bruises are very red/purple in colour,  yes I do use a lot of force, it's the only way I can get any sense of release and considering i have to cut daily..... There is a lot of bruising :/ also the bruising is small,  size of a pea dotted across the incision"
selfharm,34y1u0,FeelOneFeelItAll,2,Tue May 5 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting... Does your skin pull a lot when you drag the blade across? Bruises are just burst blood vessels So when you're doing damage to yourself it's understandable that that would occur as well, especially since you use a lot of force. About the dotting of the bruises- do you use a lot of force then recoil a bit then repeat? Or perhaps your skin in the direction of the blade's motion folds up on itself and so it gets pinched between the blade and other skin. Does any of that seem plausible? If you're worried about it you may want to see a doctor, but I'm not sure, bruises happen and go away, usually not much cause for concern.   You didn't come here for this, but I  can't not say something about this. If you're worried about it, stop cutting. Easier said than done, but it is possible. There are tools for alternative coping methods. I don't know what you've been through, your motivation for self harm, or your efforts in cessation, but if you want to message me or anything, feel free. If it's something you need to work through on your own or don't want to change at the moment, it can be harmful to force it so I won't push. Just thought I'd extend the invitation."

selfharm,34y1u0,FeelOneFeelItAll,1 point,Tue May 5 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, plus tissues in your leg are longitudinal rather than lateral so you're cutting perpendicular to the grain, so to speak.

selfharm,3505hg,Darkmatterrainbows,1 point,Wed May 6 00:24:46 2015 UTC,General rule of thumb I use (I'm not a doctor - personal experience with Doctors) is if you cannot pinch the skin together then you need stitches. Also if you cut into fat tissue (yellow).

selfharm,3505hg,legittomato,2,Thu May 7 23:48:07 2015 UTC,"It keeps blood from drying on the cut which makes them much less visible and (no idea if it actually does) i think it makes it heal faster. I dont always do it that way, only when im in the shower/bath already"

Depending on the location of the injury, you can cover it up with clothes or a bandage or something, but if the doctors need access to that area or an area around it, either make sure you have something on that will allow access without having to uncover cuts. Like if they're on your forearm, wear long sleeves, but make sure the collar is stretchy enough so you can pull it down over your shoulder so the doctor can give you a shot or something. If they're on your legs, wear bandages and say you got torn up by bushes while hiking or something. Or just say that's not what you're there for and hope they stop pushing. I usually just try to change the subject ASAP. Anyway, good luck, and you should really go to the doctor if you need it. An awkward conversation is better than meningitis.

If the material is thin enough it won't be that hot and, bonus, it'll protect you from sun burns! Also, you could put mederma or something on your cuts to keep from scarring.

selfharm,34z5jc,noharmyetbutsoon,2,Tue May 5 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"Guilt can cause the kind of self-harming you're describing, and depression can cause an inordinate amount of guilt. There's a link between OCD and non-religious flagellation, and I know that firsthand after many hospitalizations and doctors when I was younger scratching their heads and finally making the connection. Self-harm is serious, and without downplaying that fact, the kind of self-harm you're describing is even more difficult to address because of the mechanisms behind it and how unprepared most professionals are going to be in treating it.  I'd continue reaching out for advice and support, and whatever else it takes to prevent you from going down this path. Anxiety, signs of depression, stress, whatever signs you notice that increase the kind of thoughts you're having. If those things exist, you're actually in a fortunate position of being able to tackle them before things get out of hand.  I distract myself, personally, and I think it's a decent option for a lot of people regardless the reasoning behind their self-harm. If I have the time to replay an event in my mind and start rationalizing how it's my fault, bad things happen. I have an amazing ability to rationalize my own guilt. Best to just not give myself the opportunity to blame myself for everything. Idle hands and all that. Got to get up and move, flick on some music or a movie, or engage in something that requires my full attention. Play off the OCD and go count ceiling tiles or something. With practice it helps a lot for all kinds of intrusive thoughts.  I wish you the best of luck."

selfharm,34z5jc,piggahbear,1 point,Tue May 5 19:42:02 2015 UTC,Don't have much to add except to say you're not alone in regards to those thoughts. A large part of my cutting is because I feel I deserve the pain and scars. Particularly the scars actually; I know that bad enough scars will keep me isolated out of shame.
selfharm,34z5jc,sirweebleson,1 point,Wed May 6 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"I know that bad enough scars will keep me isolated out of shame.   Was on my way out the thread and saw this. Haven't met any cutters personally who predominantly cut for that reason, and I was conflicted because on the one hand I was thinking hey after all these years I'm not alone this is awesome, but then the reality of the commonality hit and snatched it away. Just wanted to say I'm sorry. Not sure for what, exactly. Comment just brought a tinge of sadness with it.  If it makes any difference, I felt the same way for a long time. Somehow picked up some kids along the way even while looking like I flew through a windshield, so at least a few people were able to look past it. Scars alone don't mean you have to be alone in life."
selfharm,34z5jc,piggahbear,1 point,Wed May 6 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I definitely feel like I'm ""sentencing"" myself to isolation with each cut deep enough to scar. I purposely cut in patterns that can only appear intentional. Another part of it is seeming to take solace in the thought ""well I can't be okay if I'm doing this to myself."" Its probably the most complex addiction I have because of thoughts like that. There is a definite relief in the moment of cutting, watching the blood, but there's more to it. Every time my cuts start to fade I do it again and think ""well no point in trying to get too close to anyone for a while now."" I just turned 24 and I'm a guy so the stigma is strong, deservedly or not."
selfharm,34z5jc,sirweebleson,1 point,Wed May 6 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"There's a stigma associated with mental health and some particularly nasty ones associated with self-harm. As a man I'm also aware that it's a bit different for us. I never felt relief, it was more of an autonomous thing like you see with kids and trich (not so much the kind with adults), so I think maybe I jumped the gun there with the similarity. Nevertheless, I can completely relate to that feeling that the aftermath, the scars and all that, continue to push you outside of the majority who can reasonably expect to be able to find people to get close to. I never really figured it was in the cards for me. Neurontin unexpectedly knocked it out the park for me while one of my old psych's was mixing cocktails looking to treat the OCD. There's little to no literature out there regarding the efficacy of gabapentin in treating that type of self-harm. A lot of off-label use for anxiety, some cutters have tried it but most see little effect, some try to get high off it. Completely nuked mine from orbit likely due to the closer tie to impulse/compulsion != anxiety/depression. Every once in awhile life takes a break from throwing you curves and lobs an easy one your way.   And I guess that's my point. Sometimes when you're convinced you've closed all the doors on yourself, an unexpected one opens up. I know it seems like there's no use in even entertaining the thought that there are people out there that can look past your scars but there really are. I'm not the most charismatic guy but I've got a decent number of friends and every one of them have looked past it. I'm sure as hell not an attractive man or charming or really possess any of the typical qualities you'd associate with someone who can find significant others, but I manage to do okay I suppose. Made some comment recently in a thread in this sub actually I think eluding to the fact that at this point I'm concerned more with the type of people I attract rather than being able to attract any at all. In my experience, I've seen anxiety and depression cause more social isolation in friends and loved ones than cutting alone.  You very well may be surprised who comes your way when you least expect it. In the meantime, take care of yourself and hang in there, man."
selfharm,34z5jc,FeelOneFeelItAll,0,Thu May 7 04:47:35 2015 UTC,"Mistakes are a learning opportunity. Rather than thinking of ways to punish yourself, think of ways to avoid those mistakes in the future or how you can help rectify them. That way you're putting your energy into something productive rather than destructive. Punishment won't make the mistake go away, and trust me, you don't want to start down the path of self destruction. It's not an easy hole to dig yourself out of.   Good luck, mate!"

selfharm,34wla3,greatgatsbys,3,Wed May 6 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"I made a post on a similar topic to this. And in that I mentioned how I found it unusual that no strangers approach me about my scars. Never noticed a person even look strangely at me. Maybe it's where I live, in the tea-drinking nation where we are too polite to question the mental health of people we don't know. Even though talking in a positive way is such a benefit, at least for me I feel that way. If someone came up to me and said something like 'I notice your scars', my first response would be 'Thank you'. Because being noticed would be so nice and so unexpected that I'd have to show appreciation for that. Even though the stigma of self-harm makes people fear it, we should support the idea of breaking down the walls and be more open in acknowledging other people's struggles.  Although, with all that is said and done, it is often a good idea not to get involved as it is a very private thing, and could lead to an emotional connection that over time becomes fixated on negative ideas and brings both parties down. Should a friendship emerge based on depression. I have experience in that area, trust me, having two people with depression being friends is not as big a fairytale as it may seem. There is often less of the sharing of pain and fighting through it together as there is fighting each other with the anger and overwhelming fear of losing each other that comes with depression. And often a person with depression can unwillingly cause another person who is close to them to be depressed. It's an ugly truth.   So with all that, I want to make a point that we as a society should acknowledge the mental health of others, but that we should also tread lightly."

selfharm,34vgr8,RubiedCross,1 point,Tue May 5 09:49:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I prefer the self-harm to the smoking. That is, if you take proper care of the cuts and make sure to do it in moderation. I mean, self-harm will leave you with some scars, but with proper care, it won't get too bad, and you'll never get infections, and it's mostly just temporary injuries. Smoking, though, that can and often leads to cancer, as well as bad lungs, poor oral health in general, just, I don't even know. A lot. A lot more than cutting. Honestly, smoking should be considered the worse form of self-harm, when compared to cutting. It has much worse, lasting side-effects. It's life-threatening not only for yourself, but for anyone nearby who's breathing in the smoke. The only difference is, it's socially acceptable, while cutting most definitely is not.  However, I do both, not gonna lie. Not very often, either of them, but I still do both. So I feel you on those kinda nights. I really do.  MCR is a great choice to listen to, Very nostalgic for me. I hope your night was at least a little relaxing, and I hope you get some rest. Thanks for sharing, it's always good to hear from others who may or may not be similar to myself 8)  Cheers."
selfharm,34vuvs,Miamixink3,3,Tue May 5 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"I've never had a therapist threaten to admit me for cutting.  I was sort of 'held hostage' at my therapists office once because I was more or less planning to go home and injure and I didn't want her to tell my mom (I was an adult so she couldn't tell my mom w/out my permission). So, I had to stay until she was convinced I was safe. Also, there was a big snow storm while I was seeing her, and my car was snowed in because their parking lot hadn't been plowed, so I couldn't exactly leave anyway.  By the time I could get my car out, she felt safe sending me home.  I did have a psychiatrist once that for some reason decided I needed to go to the hospital whenever I self harmed.  If I wouldn't go voluntarily he threatened to commit me.  Well, I knew it was always much easier to get out sooner if I went willingly, so I always went, and the doctor who treated me at the hospital usually sent me home pretty quickly, because he saw no reason for me to be there for my superficial cutting.  Of course, once my self harm got more dangerous (I did a bunch of things that were way beyond typical cutting), then they did warrant hospitalization--they became as dangerous or more so than a suicide attempt.  I knew I needed to be in the hospital, and I went willingly.  There was one time when the only hospital with available beds didn't want to take me because I had insurance (Just medicaid at that point).  They preferred to save their beds for people with no insurance at all. (there is a severe shortage of psych beds in my state and really across the country).  I needed medical hospitalization before going to any kind of psych ward, and by the time my medical stay was over, I no longer needed a psych bed (and other beds in other hospitals had likely opened up), but I was told by the social worker that if the situation ever arose that I needed a psych bed, and the only hospital with beds didn't want me, I would have to be court committed so they would be forced to take me--even though I was willing to go without a court order.  TLDR chances are good your therapist will not force you into the hospital for superficial cuts, even if there are a lot.  If they think you might go home and do it again, they may ask your permission to talk to someone close to you (parent or friend) to help you not do this.  Only if they are seriously worried you might do enough harm to put your life in danger, or injure your body enough to need serious medical care (i.e. get a tendon or something that could cause complications for the rest of your life) would they suggest the hospital or have grounds for admitting you against your will.  Psychiatrist somehow have more power than therapists in getting someone committed."

Holding down a job that I can be proud of is probably the most important thing in my life right now, and I just never even considered that I would be able to be employed again.  I don't even know where I'm going with this.  I guess it's just weird to think that that's actually an actual legit option, you know?  Like...it's not the end of the fucking world for people who decide to go.  With the state I'm in right now I don't think that it's necessarily something that I need to utilize, but the mere fact that it is there, and that I could actually become employed again after words is...it's incredible.

Many people I was in the hospital with had jobs ,and would return to them.  Employers are not allowed to ask about your health, and they cannot legally discriminate against you for it (Unless it's like the military or something where it really could be hazardous to your job).   I had a full time job when I started going in and out of psych wards for the second time--I did take a leave of absence for a while, but then went back to work.  The work wasn't healthy for me, and I had way more problems than a short leave of absence would cure, but if I could have gotten my stuff together in 12 weeks, they couldn't have fired me because of the Family Medical Leave Act (aka FMLA).  I wound up quitting on good terms, and then going on disability because I needed way more care.  But, many people I was in treatment with went back to their day jobs and did just fine.

selfharm,34utem,jairova,1 point,Mon May 4 19:13:38 2015 UTC,"However, I still end up procrastinating (even now) while I'm working and I don't know why.   Shot in the dark here, but I'm assuming that you're in high school/college.  Do you think that perhaps the procrastination aspect of it could be related to being afraid of what the future holds for you?  It's perfectly fine to worry over stuff like that.  Perhaps the stress of what's next has just been boiling for a while now and something that changed recently finally pushed you over that edge.   I'm afraid of doing so because I didn't reach out earlier so now I'll have bigger consequences by confessing.   I totally understand about not wanting to reach out to anyone, especially if you feel like it's already ""too late"".  It's scary as fuck to let someone else in on something that is so stigmatized.  To put yourself in such a vulnerable position.  I would say though, that perhaps if you do have some friends or family members that you are particularly close to, you could reach out to them, not about Self harm specifically but rather get the conversation going about how you've been under a lot of pressure lately, what a toll that has been taking on you...and if they are receptive to all of that and you still feel brave enough to do so then maybe you mention some of the steps you've taken recently.  I wouldn't try and stress out too much about what you should have, or could have done to avoid this earlier.  It's in the past and accepting that whatever has happened, has happened is important.  Try to be honest about what has happened and figure out if there's a way to fix it.  I'm sure that all sounds way easier said then done, but try and take it all one step at a time.  Lay out every step that you can think of that you would want to do in order to fix the problem that is in front of you.  Figure out what might happen along the way and assess whether or not it's even worth worrying over, or if it's just spilt milk at this point.  Hope that helps!"
selfharm,34v26t,tomasgl,2,Mon May 4 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"Staying in the relationship is probably not good for either of you if you don't feel the same about her anymore. Pretending to care for her more deeply than you do isn't fair to either of you. You should break up with her.   Timing? Maybe wait until after her exams, this will help her stay as focused as possible on those and do as well as possible. I'm assuming since you're posting here, you do care what happens to her, you're just not in love with her. Waiting a few days/weeks until her exams are over would be very kind of you to do for her if possible, even if she never thanks you for it, never realizes that that is why you waited, and isn't grateful even if she does find out why you waited. If it were me, I would wait until the end of her exams.   In terms of her self-harming, since, if you take my advice you will be breaking up with her, you should tell someone. A teacher if you are in high school, or her parents if that's something you can do, or even a councilor that might be able to steer you in the right direction. I would absolutely not tell her friends. A lot of people don't know how to react to this kind of thing. She may not be ready for that kind of confrontation. A lot of people find comfort in their peers, she should be allowed to decide for herself which of her friends to confide in and which ones she trusts to know about her selfharm (if any of them at all). The last thing she needs now (as she's stressed and potentially grieving) is for her friends to isolate her because they don't know what to say or do around her. This isn't to say that they would all do this, but it's hard to say how people will react and blindsiding her with her friends may be extremely painful for her. If you tell her parents, be honest with them about why you're coming to them about it, you care and don't want her hurt, but you don't feel the same way that she does about you and you want her to have a support system in place.    so I ended up getting back together with her, as I fear what she will do should we break up for good.    This is not a good reason to stay with someone. It is a good reason to consider and plan your next few moves, but it is not something to build a relationship on. I hope this is somewhat helpful to you. Good luck"

If you refuse to accept that, and continue your belief that you are not worth the love he offers, you very truly risk creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Both you and he deserve better than that.  the single most important lesson to take away from this, I think, is expressed most poignantly to me by the line from Moulin Rouge: ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love; and to be loved in return."" The second part is measurably harder, but worth the effort.  Good luck, be well, and be you.  With sincerity,   -Rai"

selfharm,34s2zp,RubiedCross,3,Mon May 4 07:27:13 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the subconscious is much more aware of the obvious connection between injury and endorphins, and through any knowledge of self-harm, it subconsciously drives people towards self-harm.  That's just spewed nonsense, though. Don't take any of it to heart. The reasons for self harm are broad, and cannot be limited to any one single reason. Even for individuals, the reasons for self harm are hardly ever simple or obvious, truly. While one might be able to just say they self harm because a friend did it once, or because they saw it in some form of media, or read about it in a book, plays a lot more towards the sociological aspect of it all rather than to anything intrinsically unconscious. This prevents a clearway to an evolutionary explanation for self harm from being found. Rather, it's littered with so much that the path is hardly recognizable. But I'm certain there's strong ""evolutionary"" aspects to why humans (and animals) self harm. Just keep asking the big questions, and then try to discover the answers the little questions formed by its ripples."

So no you wouldn't shock yourself. But it does leave a very distinct mark and a lot of people would know what it's from, especially adults.   That thing is really fucking hot though and assuming you don't self harm around others, the only instance you may use it is driving and the figurative shock from the pain may cause you to jerk the wheel or something which may cause an accident. So while you shouldn't harm yourself at all and getting caught/ being asked questions about a pretty obvious marks suck, this could also risk the safety and lives of others. And don't ever assume there's no one on the road even if you can't see them.   Also, think about how so many people pick their nose in their car. A lot of times, someone sees it. So just because you're alone in your car doesn't mean no one can see you.  I would provide support in the manner of why you shouldn't hurt yourself or take out frustrations on your body, but I'd feel too much like a hypocrite at the moment. But that doesn't mean I don't believe that. I do. There's too much pain in the world to inflict it on yourself as well.  Also, on the front of using the car lighter for it's intended purpose, don't. Smoking sucks, it's a big waste of money, it smells awful, when it's cold out, standing outside to finish your cig is miserable, and when it's hot out, smoking just feels extra gross, and quitting is incredibly difficult. I've quit quite a number of times, but that's just a less depressing way of saying I never really succeeded in quitting. And cancer or whatever."

Assume the worst and make myself slightly paranoid). And if I did fuck up and do if try to not do it while moving so I wouldn't hurt anybody, I'd probably go to an empty parking lot or something.  And yeah, I already know about smoking. I used to smoke like three cigars/cigarillos (swishers and shit like that) a week. I haven't smoked since June though but recently the fucking craving sucks and I can't handle it. But I mean hey, vaporizers are nicer and healthy so that's always an idea.  Anyway, thanks again for the help, good luck in quitting, God bless."
selfharm,34sb7a,FeelOneFeelItAll,1 point,Mon May 4 11:02:01 2015 UTC,"Kinda good to assume the worst. Then you're prepared. Though it is a lot of excess anxiety. You could get rid of the lighter part to take away temptation. Or even just put it in the glove box so you wouldn't be able to access it while driving. Then it may give you the time to calm down and talk yourself out of hurting yourself since you'd have to find a secluded spot, pull over, get it out of the box, wait for it to heat up and all that. If you have the key for the lock on the glove box you could lock it in there just to add the extra step and if the key is on your car key ring, you wouldn't even be able to lean over and get the lighter while driving. That may be excessive, but sometimes it's good to take precautions.  Vaping has helped me quit, but I still smoke one every once in a while so don't place all your bets on that. Also, the shitty disposable ones are kinda iffy so I'd recommend getting a nicer vape. But if your endgame is to quit nicotine altogether, don't spend too much on one or you may feel obligated to use it. I dunno, maybe that's just me. And while there are a lot of studies on e-cigs that say they're less harmful, they're pretty new so we may not know the entirety of their effects. I mean, they used to think cigarettes were healthy back in the 50's. I dunno, I'm rambling, but I mess up a lot and don't want others to have to go through it. My lab mates in organic chemistry benefit from that quality of mine I guess.  Thanks for the well wishes and I really hope things get better on your end. It's no fun wanting to hurt yourself. Even though your parents seem like they don't think you're doing enough, they probably don't mean it. It's easy to take the good things for granted and they probably just want to push you to do well so you can have a good future. Though you and they may not have the same idea of what that means, it's all good intentions, I'm sure. If you talk to them about how the pressure they put on you is harmful to your wellbeing, it may open their eyes to things they never noticed. Telling the truth can hurt, but it's usually better in the long run. If nothing else it can be a learning experience for how to approach things or what to avoid in the future. My negligence really fucked with something important to me and now that I know how much it hurts, I'll do anything to avoid making that kind of mistake again. You can't fully appreciate the fire until you've been burned or saved by it. Boy does it suck getting to that point though."

Made me really self conscious to the point where I don't where short sleeved tops anymore.

You spotted that person staring, and maybe should have stared back if you really thought they were looking at you, of course they could just be daydreaming but then again I wasn't there. Five years is a long time to go without a person saying anything. Maybe it's based on location? I am in the apparently more polite part of the world, England.

selfharm,34krit,Youknow_whatever,3,Sat May 2 01:02:56 2015 UTC,"For me, it is likely the opposite...not because of reality but because of some of the mental disorders I have to deal with.  Occasionally I force myself to go outside, and since it's getting hot out again I try to wear short sleeves in order to look less conspicuous.  Most of the time though, if I don't have my arms crossed while I'm waiting on line for something, or speed walking through some store to get it over with, it feels like people are burning a hole into my arms with their stares.  My arms are very pale, the scars are fairly new and a dark, brownish color going with the vein in a pretty obvious pattern.  It could be because I live very close to a Military base and people just assume that I'm a typical PTSD vet (I am, but not for the reasons one would assume), but I've never been called out on it, which is a big relief.  More then being called out on it, I dread the vet to vet, heart-to-heart thing that I know is going to happen inevitably.  I'm really not looking forward to awkward-ass conversations about the VA and ""support groups, brother"" and all of that shit.  I've seen some of the scars that some of us have to wear on the sister subreddits and it still surprises me that some of us have enough courage to not cover up 24/7.

There is that moment when I am in the right light and I can see fifty scars and I'm like 'oh woah, I did do that a lot'.

selfharm,34k5ua,Mwc_,2,Fri May 1 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure why what's happening is happening, but here's my take on it:  Your father isn't upset at you.  He's upset at himself.  He's upset that he didn't see this sooner, that he couldn't have done something different to stop you from feeling the need to cut yourself.  Maybe he's angry at your mother for not noticing, or he feels like he failed you as a parent for not giving you a different escape from what you are feeling right now.  Things are bad, for sure.  They're not going to get better quick, but try and hold out as best as you can.  Try and tell your parents how you are feeling.  Don't make them rely on some stupid pamphlet and second-hand advice from your friend and some on-the-clock doctors.  Tell them with your own words what's going on.  Hell, show them this post if you think it would help.  Also, I would really, really encourage you to tell your parents about those things they don't know about.  Right now they don't know what to think.  They desperately want to trust you - they need to trust you - but the evidence that they see in front of themselves is telling them the complete opposite.  Give them that trust by telling them about those things you hid.  Show them where they are.  No more secrets.  No more running.  It's going to suck.  They're probably going to be pissed and be angry, but again, the anger they are going to feel is at themselves not at you.  They are going to feel angry that they couldn't have found them on their own.  But you can make it right by handing it over.  Maybe they'll take it out on you.  Maybe they'll blame you, but it's not what they are thinking; it's not what they are feeling.  We both know it's the right choice to make.  Make the right choice and tell them.  Like I said in the beginning of my post, this is all guesses on my part.  Pure speculation.  But from the experience that I've had, I feel like it's probably a point in the right direction.

(if you don't go to the hospital) If it's dark red blood flowing out quite fast than you really need to go to the hospital because it means the cut is deep and may require the muscles to be stitches and if you get an infection it could be far more damaging.  But regardless of that if you are worried just get yourself to the hospital. They won't stitch wounds after a certain amount of time due to risk of infection.

Self-harm is a form of self-medication, and it's especially dangerous if you can't identify what feelings you are ""treating."""
selfharm,34jdl4,Mondayslasagna,1 point,Fri May 1 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"Welp, it might actually be because I want to be around other people recovering from mental disorders. Here at home everyone around me is completely normal. In the hospital I'd been to we would happily discuss our preferred methods of suicide as a small-talk or how it's best to harm yourself. Such topics weren't taboos and I felt so... human or something like that. Now I have completely nobody to talk to in this way and it feels shitty. The worst thing is the lack of ability to do something about that. I am completely unsocial and even if I weren't, how would I be to find people with problems similar to mine? Surely there's the Internet but that doesn't really do the job for me. Any ideas?"

Isn't that an odd thought?    Don't be so quick to dismiss discussion over the internet, either.  I've never met someone in ""real life"" who self-harms for this very reason - people are more comfortable discussing it online with people they know will accept them and not spread info to friends and family in ""real life.""  Well, we're not all robots and are actual people, so I think it would genuinely be helpful for you to keep talking online like this.  PM me if you want.

I mostly cut on my forearms - not easy to hide, and the heat means no long sleeves for 90% of the year. I usually cover the most recent wounds with a sweatband. Once they are fully healed and scarred, I move on to a different place, and let the old ones show. People are used to me wearing odd things on my arms, so no one questions it, and no one usually comments on my scars. Really, in terms of workplace professionalism- as long as you get your work done, leave your home shit at home, and don't let your coping mechanisms interfere with work (like drugs and alcohol), employers tend not to care.  As an aside - could you cut higher up on your thighs, or on your hip where the edge of your undies sits? Just a thought."

But, the only 'good' (or working?) place for me to cut is my right forearm.  Definitely not a great place--especially in summer.  But even in winter, it's possible a shirt could ride up and my scars be seen. So I haven't cut in ages. And, at my job, it would be unprofessional to show new scars/fresh wounds.  I am just glad my old scars aren't super visible or I'd feel obligated to cover them as well.  Right now, I am having some urges to cut, but of course the one place that has brought me relief in the past is pretty much the one place I cannot cut for fear of being found out.  So, I have to do things other than cut. Use my long list of coping skills. Talk to friends, exercise, watch a movie, pet my cat, read a  book etc.    I'm sure I should also be talking about my urges to cut to my therapist, but I haven't been able to yet--I feel like I would be disappointing her if I did that.

Sometimes I can't even imagine eating noodles, but you can ask for just the broth. They might look at you weird, but the broth is delicious and healthy. And then see if you can eat a few saltine crackers, and/or thicker soups like split pea.  You'll start eating normally again when you feel ready, but in the meantime, do what you can to get some nutrients. (But I don't recommend taking a multivitamin because that can upset your stomach if you haven't eaten.)"
selfharm,34gcfg,tk-216,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you live in the US but most states have a mandatory report policy where if the therapist believes you are in immediate danger to yourself or others, in that you are going to either kill yourself or harm others, they have to report you. If you talk about suicidal thoughts, it's alright. They will ask if you have a plan and if you intend on killing yourself. While you can answer yes to having a plan (I do but that's from years and years of being severely depressed and thinking about it a lot), if you answer yes that you're going to act on it, by law they have to report you. Some are more flexible on that, some are less. You can ask what their personal opinion and understanding of that policy is without risk. Then you can be more or less open depending on what they say.  Selfharm itself isn't something they can report or have you hospitalized for. If your selfharm is severe enough, they can urge you to seek medical attention but they can't make that call or have someone take you unless you specifically request help in that. If you are not immediately at risk for suicidal actions, their doctor-patient-confidentiality is still in effect.  If you are ever seriously suicidal, being hospitalized and getting help isn't the worst thing in the world. It is scary but when it comes down to it, being with people who can help and being in a safe environment is better than isolation and feeling that temptation to end it. Being honest with a therapist is always more helpful and healthy than lying because you're afraid.  Some therapists might be overwhelmed by graphic descriptions of selfharm and some have more experience when dealing with it or eating disorder issues so take it slow and get to know them. Every one is different and have different approaches. Be upfront in the things you want to work through with them and if they don't feel like they'll be able to be the most effective person for you, it's very likely they know someone better. Is this the first therapist you've seen?"
selfharm,34gcfg,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I did a session once when I was 15 and once when I was 18 with two different therapists, but once I was there I was too anxious to admit to anything and never went back.  I had a consultation at a different place the other day, and a counselor talked to me. They asked if I had a plan, and it doesn't seem like you can have suicidal ideations without there being some method.  My selfharm isn't necessarily life threatening (bruises mostly), and it's not with the intention of suicide when I do that. I'm just afraid to talk about it with someone who doesn't selfharm because they may not understand that."
selfharm,34gcfg,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Fri May 1 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"Most therapists have training and have studied selfharm so it's not like talking to a random stranger in that they understand the basics of the urge and addiction as well as what causes a person to desire it. While they may not understand it in terms of personal experience, they understand it from a clinical, scientific, and empathetic standpoint. It can be very scary and they don't expect you to jump right into trusting and feeling comfortable around them. It takes time and if that means weeks or months for you to be able to be fully open with them, that's perfectly normal and fine.  I find the question of whether someone with chronic suicidal thoughts has a plan to be kind of useless. They're trying to gauge on a set scale (that's entirely subjective) how dangerous a person is to themselves but it's a given that a person who spends a significant amount of time dwelling on the idea of suicide would have a preference or at least an idea of how they would achieve it. It's a little like asking a person who parks cars as a side job on the weekends if they've considered what kind of vehicle they like to drive more. Of course it's crossed their minds and very likely they've formed an opinion.  I've been asked if I have a plan many times and even when I was severely depressed and considering acting on my plan, I found it at least a little amusing that they even felt the need to ask or that it made any difference compared to a week or a month ago. Even now when I'm not depressed and life is good, I still have that plan because I've spent years thinking about it and my therapist asked last week and I had to laugh. I understand why they need to ask and I understand the significance that can be drawn from the answers but after a certain amount of time, the existence of the plan becomes irrelevant.  Anxiety can be a big issue with therapy and overcoming it can be a huge step toward opening up and moving on. This is why having a therapist you trust and have spent time with, who you feel comfortable opening up to is important because you move past that anxious feeling into getting some actual therapy and working on the real issues. You have time. Take it slow but keep moving forward and eventually you'll be looking back marveling at how far you've come."

Once it would turn a orangish glow I would apply it to my skin for approximately 20 seconds or until the pain subsided.  I did none of this sanitarily or even carefully.  Honestly, it was a miracle I didn't get an infection.  The wounds took weeks to heal, longer still since I kept picking at them.    Any ""design"" that you end up trying to burn into yourself is not going to come out looking how you envisioned it.  I have an X on my chest where some parts of the skin are very much raised from the surface, while others are thin and almost invisible.  I have several other symbols on my body and drew them in thin, compact areas and they came out extremely blotchy and ugly looking.  I would not advise trying this at all.

Emotional neglect is hard. It's also incredibly difficult to overcome. So I started pulling away from those people. Of course, they hooted and hollered that they ""cared"", but I knew the truth, and kept my relationships with them relatively superficial. It is harder - much harder with family, but you recognise who and who are not your safe people, or people to trust, and you move on.  It does need to be said that sometimes people are just full up with their own emotional business to ""take on"" any more, and so they lash out. As self-harmers we lose our ability to gauge emotion not just within ourselves, but with other people, too, so our barometer of too much/too little gets a bit skewed. Balance."
selfharm,348mkg,nurse_kiki,2,Wed Apr 29 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"There's two kinds that I'm familiar with: the kind you can buy over the counter and the kind you get from medical or emergency medicine suppliers (technically there's more than that but basic.) The first is only for use on shallow, minor injuries and shouldn't be used on any wound that needs stitches. Really anything more serious than a bad papercut shouldn't be closed with the over the counter stuff. I've used it a few times on accidental cuts and it was alright. The temptation to peel the glue off made it kind of pointless.  The kind you get from medical suppliers is basically special superglue. It's supposed to be a temporary solution in situations where stitches or other methods of closing full thickness cuts isn't an option. I don't have any actual experience with it but the wiki says it can cause chemical burns and only lasts a few days. If you're trying to use it for deep cuts... a person could use tape and things to maybe make it last longer but since you're allergic... I was going to suggest reapplying and then keeping the area stable with an Ace wrap but apparently the glue reacts to some materials really badly and cotton is a material in Ace wraps... shit, it can light on fire.........  If you can find a wrap like that which isn't made with materials that react with the glue you're using it could be an option but I would be incredibly careful both with the glue and how you stabilize the area. Honestly, if you have wounds that absolutely require closing and you have the materials, I suggest stitching. For the majority of people, I'd say do anything else but it really seems like the safer and more sure option and if you have medical grade supplies and experience, it makes it that much safer compared to potentially explosive superglue."
selfharm,348mkg,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:34:51 2015 UTC,Liquid band-aid is all my grandma used when I was a kid. I'd have to say that you can use it on any small cut or any cut that's not very wide.
selfharm,348mkg,Thatscuzuralesbian,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:25:27 2015 UTC,"I don't use liquid bandaids, but I did want to give a suggestion. As someone who is also allergic to adhesives, I have found something that works wonders. Coban wrap. I'm dead serious. It's latex free, sticks to itself, can get wet (although that makes it frustratingly hard at times), can hold a gauze pad in place, great for bendy areas (knees, wrists, hands, etc.) and can be put preeeetty much anywhere. Not only that, but it's pretty cheap.   Since you're a nurse, I don't think getting some of this will be too hard. :) However, for the non-nurses who are reading and want to give it a shot, you can find it near the bandages in almost every pharmacy, grocery store, retailer like Walmart, etc. They keep the ""nude"" colored wraps in stock. If you want a little more color in your life, go to the sporting goods section of your nearest WalMart or just go to a sporting goods store. They sell it too, and while it may be under a different name, it's the same stuff. Non-adhesive/self-sticking bandage wrap. Athletes have been known to use it to wrap injuries, wrap flyaway hair to keep it out of their face, etc."

Like, I mean, it is, I guess, but the stigma around the situation is so over the top... You WILL find your person and you will lose yours. It may not be today or tomorrow, but it will happen when it's meant to happen. I know, I know, that sounds ridiculous. I rolled my eyes at myself, don't worry. However, it's true. My first time was horrible and I hated it. That's not a story to go into now, though. When I waited for someone I truly loved and felt passionate about, it was amazing. Having sex just to have sex or lose your virginity isn't anything to write home about IMO. When you find the person, that's when it'll be like, whoa.   And yes, you WILL find your person. You may think you're ugly, but that's your view on it. We all see the worst in ourselves; we're our own worst critics. There is someone out there, more than one someone, who will think that you look handsome/beautiful, though. Who will take one look at you and nearly break their neck trying to look again and take you all in before you disappear. Just because you can't see it in yourself doesn't mean that it's not there. I bet you're stunning, but just don't realize it.   As for being killed or manning up, I personally hope that neither happens. Not to imply that you're ""unmanly,"" but that I don't want you to reach that point. You have a purpose here, love, we all do. Sometimes it just takes a while to discover it.

Although I'm from Northern Europe, I guess I could give you my two cents. I've seen doctors more times than I can count during the last ten years, a.k.a. when I used to cut or have had scars on my arm. Not one of them has ever said anything, even when they've been extracting blood from my left forearm, meaning they've been working directly on the area with most obvious scars. I guess it may be because I've openly been receiving psychiatric care most of that time, and so my history probably mentions my cutting as well.   Oh! I just remembered: actually one of my former doctors took notice of my quite fresh cutting scars. Her only reaction was to ask if I had disinfected them properly. I told her yes, I had. She nodded and said that if I absolutely needed to continue doing that, to at the very least make sure I won't get the cuts infected. (edit. she was very friendly and caring, I didn't feel like I was being scolded, rather it just felt like she was worried about me.) I was really surprised and thankful.  Anyhow, the point being: doctors (and nurses) see and hear a lot of disturbing stuff almost daily, I'd imagine. You're not the first person with scars like that that they've met. :)  Though if you haven't told anyone about your self harming, it would be wise to talk about it to a doctor. They can actually help you.   In any case, take care! Oh and I'd be interested to hear how everything went, afterwards. :)"

I can't think of any healthy ways I can get rid of it because arguing makes me even less likeable, things like sports don't work on getting rid of it for me because it's not got the feeling of 'meaning it' (and I get hurt, which is ironic in this thread, but I like to have control over my own pain). Not to mention I'm stuck in this damn house.  I feel like instead of drawing out my pain on myself lightly I'm setting off bombs in my head.

It felt so good, but after I started and I woke up with the cuts in my arms I felt so ashamed, it only drove me deeper into my depression."

If your boss does have an issue with something you're doing, maybe they will take that as an opportunity to talk to you about it and maybe give some tips to improve efficiency. Also, I would check out the labour laws in your area, I don't think they can make you work for free on things and I don't think they can punish you if you refuse (but that might depend on what kind of job it is and what the rules are in your specific area).

When you love someone, you invariably hurt them whether it's physical actions, words, or taking the last cookie from the cookie jar.  If he loves you back, he'll find a way to support you.  Yes, the marks may hurt and he may look at them with a look you can't tolerate... but if you bottle it up inside, this cycle will keep going.  Sometimes, even if you let it out, it does.  I've tried, but I'm still relapsing now and again.  I think that talking it out could help, though.  Even though it would be hard, it could help a lot.  If you can't manage to find the words to say it, could you two keep a notebook of sorts, and write back and forth each day, talking it out?  Some people find that easier as well.

I don't want them to try and help, because to unload it all will only bring them down.  Or so I feel.  You aren't alone.  It takes time to be able to open up to people when you're like that, to not shut them out.  It doesn't mean that you'll be forever alone, just that it's not your time to have a relationship right now.  It will come.    Frankly, I don't think that you deserved it for messing with her head.  Things happen, relationships don't always work out, it's how life goes.  I do understand self harming due to it, as I've rationalized things like that myself.

You can pick up a package of one or two, depending on where on your arms you need them, for roughly $1 at most WalMarts in the US.  If you're not in the US, then I recommend Amazon or eBay.

I'm sure she appreciates the fact that you are there for her. But she might just not be able to talk about it (yet).  Sometimes it is in fact really hard to open up towards such an important person. In this case I guess the most important thing is that she knows that at no point she has to open up but if at any time she wanted to, you would be there.  But please do never ""force"" her into talking about it (even if you wouldn't consider repeatedly asking forcing). My gf once did this and since then I am actively hiding my scars from her again and I can't talk about it to her now. Please just don't make this mistake since it can turn very good will into permanent damage.  The best thing (in my opinion) is just knowing that someone is there - always ready to talk.

You've only been dating a couple of months, so it isn't terribly surprised that there might be deep dark secrets that she hasn't opened up about yet. I've been married for 13 years and haven't opened up about them all to my wife - and I certainly didn't before we got married.  You should focus on being supportive and loving of her, and give her the space to do what she needs to do. Provide other outlets to ease the pain and be supportive there. Most importantly, be there and don't be judging. And please, for the love of all that is holy, don't constantly harp on it.

selfharm,33k33v,katemariemc,3,Thu Apr 23 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"It is important to realize that people who are self harming are just people in pain, coping in a way that ... Well, if it doesn't make sense then it at least works. They need and want what every other hurting person does. So, I think it depends why she is self harming.  For me, it's usually because I'm stressed or depressed. If I'm stressed I generally want the stress to go away and to know that it's I am making things seem worse in my head. Again. I've got such a perfectionist streak that any perceived imperfection (in me) really messes with me.  When I'm depressed: someone to talk to is really what I need. Someone that can understand that I am hurting, even if they can't understand where I am at right then. A hug really helps.   It may not stop her from self harming, but being there for her and being accepting and supportive (of her personally) can really mean the world."

selfharm,33ioy3,jetsam52,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:26:53 2015 UTC,"In general I don't think it's really that necessary to ""come out"" about cutting. This may however be a minority opinion, because I do see a lot of posts here talking about it. My thought in this particular case however is that it would not be a bad idea. She confided to you, it would be courteous and a good point to bond and relate over for you to come forward to her too.   I know of a good dozen or so people who have cut, and mostly I know that they cut only because I shared a very close relationship with them, most of those relationships involving physical intimacy. For me, I don't really share my cutting with someone unless I feel that level of closeness. At that point, they're already going to be knowing most of what's going on in my life and seeing my body out of necessity, I may as well just tell them.   I think, due to how stigmatized cutting is, you should be prepared for this relationship to be taken ""to the next level"" so to speak. Obviously if you're gay and she's a chick, it's not going to be a romantic relationship, but you definitely want to consider the level of trust that this implies. That being said, once that level of trust and depth is established, it's really freeing to have someone you can talk about who knows or can relate very directly to how you feel. I know it's certainly helped me with coping.   For you, your cutting and your sexual identity are closely related. While you may not be ready to come out about your sexuality just yet, maybe as the relationship grows you may feel more comfortable with it. At some point though I would expect that she may ask you about what drives you to cut."

selfharm,33gaqb,afacefed,4,Wed Apr 22 07:46:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, I read the whole post. This may not be helpful, but here is an outside perspective.   Your wife is damaging your kids. In this situation, your kids and their safety are the priority. You need to get your wife admitted somewhere. I don't know what resources are available to you, but you need to end this manipulation. She is manipulating you through this behavior of saying she wants it, saying she doesn't, forcing sex, and threatening suicide if you ask for help. There is nothing wrong with asking for help, especially considering your daughter is in danger. This is nowhere near healthy, this is insane, and you can't fix it by yourself.   You need to call the police or health care provider and have her removed from the situation. They will put her on suicide watch and she will be safe, but she is not your priority. As cold as this sounds, her staying with you is only going to make things worse and worse. Religion shouldn't be used to keep broken and terrifying marriages together, this has to end.   Then you need to start trying to repair what's happened to your kids. You need to get into therapy, family therapy, individual therapy, all the therapy you can get. They need to know they can come to you and you need someone to talk to too. You've been through so fucking much that it's time for you to get a break and open up to a professional about it.     I know it sounds cold and heartless, but you need to break this family up, because this is toxic and painful for everyone involved. When a spouse starts threatening suicide to keep the family together....things are out of control, this marriage can not be saved, but your kids can be.    <3 I'm so sorry for all the shit you've been through. Good luck."
selfharm,33gaqb,suicidejunkie,2,Wed Apr 22 17:03:26 2015 UTC,"I know that you're right, and I spent a lot of time thinking about it today. We even split up, recently, because of her abuse but our lawyer told us to get back together on the condition my wife see a therapist. She goes too, but doesn't ever say anything is wrong. But something is very wrong. She tells me what she'll do if the therapist finds out about it all.  I woke up this morning to my wife yelling at one of our kids, and by the time I got out of bed and to the kitchen (very quietly so that she didn't know I was observing her), she was slamming one of the kids' head against a bucket. I got everyone calmed down again, the kids off to school, and I went to work.  I think someone at work noticed the cuts because they asked if everything was ok with work. Apparently I had the dead face again when they asked because when I responded that it wasn't work they said they knew. I really am too much of an open book. Sometimes I wish I could pull off a lie - any lie.  We had a party at work that my wife brought the family to today. It went pretty well but I had a couple of panic attacks from the crowd. I guess my relapse into cutting brought those back. All I could think of while she was at the party was about how she's abusing me and the children. I fucked up, and I was too quiet. She spotted it, and called me out at dinner and again when we got home. My daughter also noticed my cuts and asked about them at dinner. In front of everyone. I blamed cats. Again. I don't think it was very convincing, but hopefully.  Tonight I resolved to bring up ... I dunno. Stuff. I wanted to tell her that I'm afraid of her - terrified of her. I'm so terrified of what she does when she's angry that I get angry at the kids so that they don't provoke her. She mentioned that she was ""complaining about me shutting her out"", and I looked her square in the eyes and said I wouldn't call what she did ""complaining"".  Yeah. So, that was a mistake. ""Oh, so you're going to insult me now, huh?!"" She didn't hit me, but she didn't back off for... I don't know. A long time. She didn't really yell and I don't know what all she said, but she was really mad and I kept curling more and more into a ball. It was all I could do not to pull out the razors I keep in my pocket and cut on the spot. I did press the screw driver I keep in my pocket into my leg though.  By the time she stopped talking and I calmed down enough to respond and tell her that we really needed to talk, she just interrupted me and went to bed. She was asleep by the time I got in the room just a couple of minutes later.  Why am I so terrible at this? I hate myself, and I know that my wife is right. If only I didn't exist then she could raise the children without my evil demonic influences and they would all be perfect. I wish I had the courage to rip my throat out.  But, I guess tomorrow is another chance to set this right and stop being such a worthless horrible coward for my kids. I love them dearly, I just want to extract them from this in a way where nobody has murder on their conscience. Because I really, really, really cannot take that too."
selfharm,33gaqb,suicidejunkie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"Another thing I want to stress is that this abuse is not your fault. It would not be better for your kids if you weren't there. You weren't there the other morning and she still ended up physically abusing your children. She needs to be removed from the situation and nothing you do to try to please her is going to work. Please try to believe me when I say in this situation you are the victim and not the cause. If you don't believe me check out this article which describes the signs of abuse.   If you can't believe that you are the victim, at least know that getting out is the only way to make things better, regardless of who's fault it is. It's tough and really really difficult.   A good example that shows how this situation is not your fault AND how it probably isn't going to get better unless you break this cycle of abuse by leaving is the part where you say: ""I fucked up, and I was too quiet."" < You didn't do anything to warrant her reaction and it was undeserved. On top of that, this shows how her abuse is independent of your behaviour; it doesn't matter what you do or how you act it will continue.  ""stop being such a worthless horrible coward "" > You are not this, you are not worthless, or horrible, or a coward. You've been through hell and you've been emotionally and mentally beaten down. This doesn't make you a coward, this makes you tired and scared. Fear doesn't make you a coward, everyone gets scared.   ""I just want to extract them from this in a way where nobody has murder on their conscience"" > and this part proves that you're not horrible or worthless. You care about your children, you want to get them to safety. Horrible and worthless people don't do that, you are not horrible or worthless. It's hard to get out of abusive situations and it's hard to take a step back and evaluate what to do. Your wife may be narcisistic, or she may have borderline personality disorder, I don't know, which is why it's important to remove yourself from the situation and get her help. It is never acceptable for a spouse to manipulate someone by threatening suicide. You need to get yourself out, and it isn't weak of you not to be sure how to do that. It's a very tense and difficult situation and not knowing how to deal with it is completely reasonable. Maybe check this out for advice on how to get out of the situation safely and things to avoid doing. < this article puts a lot more emphasis on ""staying"" than I would like and than I think is appropriate in your situation since you have kids and since things are so far our of control. I'm sorry for responding with so many articles, but hopefully you find them helpful in some way. You're not weak or horrible, you can do this."

What I mean by that is - I thought I remember you said that she threatened to suicide if you went and got counselling. Well really, too bad. (I know, easy for me to say). But you need help. Your family needs help. Your daughter needs help. Right now, your responsibility is to yourself and your children. I know that sounds incredibly callous, and obv I don't know the full story, but if you and your kids are in danger, emotional, physical, psychological, whatever - ignore her, and do what needs to be done.  Just a thought - dunno what it's like wherever in the world you are, but is it possible to get her hospitalised for suicidal ideation? I'm normally not one to advocate involuntary admission, but it really sounds like you need a break."
selfharm,33gaqb,Lenaballerina,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:26:31 2015 UTC,"You're right - I don't feel very strong. Yesterday in the morning I wanted 10 minutes alone with a razor blade. Last night I got hours. That's not the kind of thing I think I'd do if I were strong. But, I'm still here and I'm not foolish enough to think I haven't seen some shit, as it were.  I had trouble sleeping last night - my arm hurts and I kept worrying that the cuts would re-open. My wife saw them in the shower this morning, but I played it off as a cat at work. She was like ... ""What kind of.. cat?!"". Yeah, but I think it worked. At least the incessant drum beat of killing myself has gotten manageable again. I think I only whispered it a few times this morning.  As for my wife: Yeah, I know. I think at least part of it's hormone imbalances, but I can't really prove it. The doctor's say nothing is wrong - not that she'd trust them anyway. Either way I know 100% sure that she's serious about her threat. I know the right answer is to get out or have her committed, but I can't do it. I can't pay for the child care costs. I can't deal with her suicide on my conscience. I can't deal with my young son all night while he cries for a mother that will never come. I can't deal with life without her, really. It's stupid to love her still, but I still do, I think. I've told her that she has to behave or I have no choice but to leave with the kids or ask her to leave. It... works, somewhat.  I've thought about sneaking me and the kids into counseling. I figure that might actually be worse when she finds out. And I don't think I could hide it from her. Or, I might be able to but I bet the kids couldn't. Hiding things from her... is never a good idea. It always ends poorly.  Then again, I can't deal with her physically attacking me and the children. At this point I think she only physically attacks me in any real way, but I can't guarantee it's true. Certainly nothing like before. She's mean as hell to the kids when she gets mad, and even the tiniest stress can send her flying off the handle. But she doesn't .... go to excess anymore, I think.  Someday I think we won't be able to keep it under wraps anymore. People already stare at us both. Every time we're in public I'm stressing like crazy trying to keep the kids in line so that they don't make her mad and she's still getting madder by the second. I honestly have no idea how the kids handle it - oh wait, I certainly know how my oldest does.  Yeah, I don't know what to do. And I know you have good advice. I just don't know how to... do it. Thanks for reading, and caring enough to say something."

Many close friends have refused to tell me their problems/reasons even if I have told them mine.   Another reason why she didn't understand could be that she didn't not know your situation back then. After experiencing what you had gone through, she feels bad and does not want to bother you.  I'm no psychiatrist, but I suggest that you give her some time. After some time has passed, ask her again nicely. If she hesitates or refuses, just tell her she only needs to confide in one person close. And that's it.

Are you in contact with her treatment team? If so, have you discussed what is going on with them? Does she receive any form of disability benefit? I ask this because if she does for her schizophrenia, you can contact you're states' Department of Human Resources and they can help you get despite care, and/or be able to refer you to better resources.   If she is this suicidal, and this willing to harm, she should probably be in an inpatient setting, at least until the medication titration is complete; while she is self-aware, if she is unable to keep herself safe, she needs to be hospitalised."

I am in contact with her treatment team and see them weekly as well as talk to them over the phone on week days.   She will receive benefits once she has become a full citizen here, this has had to wait due to the fact she needed a team, medication and time to rest from a big move from my mother to me. Now it is our top priority.   Hospitalization has always made her worse and she shuts down completely. Everyone in the team including me has seen it best she stays at home with me.

I said this yesterday, and I'll say it again - taking care of yourself is SO important. If you need a break, see if you can get a break. Perhaps she can go to your mum's for a few days, or your mum can come to you for a few days, and you can go away. You need to find things that you can do for yourself, or you may burn out. Be kind to yourself. What you need in this situation is just as important as what she needs.

selfharm,33csxp,GarnettGreen,2,Tue Apr 21 14:09:07 2015 UTC,"My mom always freaked out when I was hurting myself too.  She was just scared and worried about me.  That was the one thing I hated most about harming myself--the worry it caused others.  I knew they cared about me, and well, if I cared about someone I too would worry if they were harming themselves.  It's not exactly the healthiest of habits.  Counseling might be helpful, even if it is another thing to add to your busy life.  You could learn how to tell your sister to back off, and it might make your mom worry a little less.  I know my mom and I had some joint sessions sometimes--that helped a little too.  As far as having a not so nice doctor, yeah I've had those too.  I've had some really crappy docs who were very condescending and just plain mean.  The kind who would stitch you up without numbing you because obviously you like pain etc.  I've also had some GREAT doctors.  The best was actually a P.A., but she was awesome.  I was in the E.R. because for some reason I thought if I could cut my thumb off I would be cured of my mental illness.  That was obviously very false thinking.  My other mistake was that I didn't expect it to bleed as much as it did.  I couldn't see what I was doing, so I gave up, bandaged myself up reall well (practically in a tournequit), and drove to the E.R.  The P.A. was so nice.  She apologized that she would have to start stitching before the numbness took effect.  She stitched what she could and glued the rest (I had so many cuts so close together there wasn't enough skin to stitch it all).  She wouldn't leave me alone in the exam room, because of everything, but did a great job of providing the medical care I needed, and then sent me to the psych E.R.  I liked her a lot.  Once, I had a doctor see my scars and assume that my accident wasn't.  He was such a jerk to me.    I'm sorry you had such a jerky doctor.  I'm glad the other health care people were nicer to you.  I hope your sister can back off a bit, and that you can learn to tell her what is and isn't helpful--since she sounds like she genuinely cares.  I also hope you know that your parents love you very much, and that is why they worry about you."

And I know it could be helpful, but I've been to counseling before - neither counselor was helpful.  I think I must have worded it wrong. My sister isn't the problem, my mom is the problem. My sister was just informing me that my mom freaked out and it's my mom being overly nice.  I'm glad to hear that you've had some good experiences. It gives me hope that other people out there who have to go to hospitals might be taken care of instead of getting crappy doctors like I got or the ones you described.  I'm actually more scared for my follow up appointment tomorrow - the doctor is afraid of infection I guess. Not like I don't know how to take care of them by now. But whatever.  Maybe this is out of line, but have you ever had to do a follow up appointment with a general practitioner? What was it like? (If it is out of line, feel free to tell me it is and to not answer.)"
selfharm,33csxp,esoper1976,2,Wed Apr 22 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever done a follow up with a GP, unless it was for a wound that was infected or something.  But, when I was doing generic cutting I rarely needed medical attention.  It was when I got into more serious stuff that I did.  Then, I often needed time in a physical hospital, and definite follow up--but I made up convincing stories before even harming myself so no one would know it was self inflicted.  At some point, it got out any way, and then I didn't care what I did or who knew.  The GP who treated me then was the family doctor, and she just handles the medical stuffs, and left the rest to my psychiatrist and therapist.  I think she would have acted differently had I not been getting psych help--as in made me get some, but as long as I was getting psych help, my visits went fine.  Of course jerky doctors rarely recommended a follow up visit....  Edited to add--when I had stitches, I obviously had to see someone to have them removed.  I'm pretty sure the E.R. doc just told me to go see my regular doc after a set amount of time to get them out.  My regular doc at the time was WONDERFUL.  She treated me great, even though I'm sure  I made a lot more work for her."

selfharm,33eaa6,Lenaballerina,2,Wed Apr 22 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"If its possible to wear a long sleeved skin tone body stocking under your costume, see if you can do that. Otherwise try green concealer to tone down the redness. Remember that stage lights wash colour out significantly, so although you might feel exposed, it's probably not all that obvious. You can always say it was an allergic reaction to some moisturiser or something. I was a ballerina for many years, and I was always worried about my scars showing up on stage, but with a bit of clever makeup and a lot of luck, I survived most scrutiny."

I was feeling uncomfortable the whole time and wanted long sleeves, although my family knows about my scars and sees them every day.   All in all, you cannot be sure..But just as a reminder: if for attention or not, you want someone to see you. Regardless of what your intention is.

I'm glad she's talking to you and that you're taking her to get help.   The cutting isn't the...problem though...if you understand what I mean.

I'm sure he /she could understand how that anxiety could have an affect on you & possibly cause a reaction.  I'm sure it's really ok to not beat yourself up about it.  Everybody trips a time or two when they're trying to get up out of the mud. Go see your therapist. Be honest with them & take what help they can offer. If they won't help, find a different one.

selfharm,3371c1,xAfro,3,Mon Apr 20 03:21:56 2015 UTC,"If your scars are that old, there isn't likely much that will help them.  But maybe.  If they are raised and dark then any of the rub-on scar remover products (mederma, bio oil, even just vitamin E from a hole poked in a vitamin capsule) rubbed on it daily for several months might improve them (but it would work better if they were newer).  If however they are not particularly raised and are lighter than the rest of your skin, there isn't likely to be anything that would make a difference.  My step-dad is a retired plastic surgeon, and I asked him about this once--when he got a free sample of mederma (I think) in the mail.  (they hadn't figured out he was retired yet, I guess, and sent him samples of things they wanted him to get his patients to use).  He told me that because I 'scar well' (meaning light/not raised so not super noticable (but you can still see them)), those products wouldn't do much if anything to help me.  He did tell me the best thing to do was wear good sunblock or not expose them to the sun for the first six months, but of course in your case that is long past (in my case now too).  Congrats on being clean so long, and good luck with minimizing the scars.  I think there is supposed to be some pretty good cover up makeup out there (I saw them cover a womans tattoos once on a show--it was pretty amazing), so if your scars are really that bad, you could always go that route, but it would be a pita to wash it off nightly and reapply every day."

Telling them that it's wrong only adds to the guilt they already have.   Not only this, Greg's telling self-harmers that ""Self-harm is wrong; stop cutting."" in a way that is clearly meant to offend them.  On the other hand, he repeatedly tells people who self-harm to get help and links to online help resources. I think he's got the right message, but he's spreading it in the worst way possible. He was also critiquing attention-seeking tumblrinas who post pictures of their cuts on the internet, not people who self-harm and keep it quiet.  I think it's also worth noting that if someone posts pictures on the internet of their scars, then they probably do need the attention as they aren't receiving it elsewhere, like from a parent or from friends/etc.   People who self-harm do need help. We all need help.   I've been on both sides (I used to think self-harm was horrible and for ""emo fags"" until I myself began cutting), so I know how Greg feels and I know how you all feel.

It's kinda hard to explain it to someone who hasn't experienced it and everyone cuts for their own reasons. It is believed that self harming releases endorphins in your brain, which help the body deal with stress and pain. It causes this sort of high, that is very addictive. It is a coping mechanism. You can compare cutting to drugs, 9 times out of 10 the people who do them are trying to escape reality and cutting works the same way. To be clear I am not a medical professional, just someone who has struggled with self harm for a couple years.  I wish you and your daughter the best of luck. I would do anything to keep anyone else from doing this. I wouldn't wish this addiction on my worst enemy."

As for your parents blaming themselves, I think some of that is to be expected.  When you're a parent you feel responsible for your kids. When they're not ok, you can't help but feel somewhat to blame.  You start asking yourself 'what did I do?' 'what did I not do?' 'how did I not know?' All of those things are normal and take time to process.   It's just part of it.  And I can tell you this, no one would feel that way if they didn't love you so much.

So I would have kept quiet if it wasn't for that.  One mistake you shouldn't make is not taking this seriously. It seems like you really care and I think the best course of action for you is to bring it up with her and have her tell you how she feels. Don't judge her or stop her, just let her tell you. Then you can start discussing her getting help in a way that she is comfortable with."
selfharm,334kzz,Mwc_,2,Sun Apr 19 22:11:17 2015 UTC,This helps a lot.  Thank you.  I've been wondering how to handle this when she comes home.  My instinct would be to stop her. Can you tell me why it's a bad idea?
selfharm,334kzz,Mwc_,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:09:43 2015 UTC,"Well you should try to stop her but you should try to find her another coping mechanism because if you don't (depending on how much she has been doing this) she will find another way. That part is all personal experience so how she will react could be completley different.   You really should get her help though. I can't speak for your daughter but there's a chance that she would not be that comfortable talking about it with you so therapy is a good idea.  On a side note: You seem to be taking this very, very well. That's the first mistake parents make is overreacting. My mother just kinda shamed me for it. I guess what I'm trying to say is you are a great parent :)"
selfharm,334kzz,Mwc_,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:36:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for saying that.  I'm trying to be.  I'm getting her help.   She's getting a lot where she is & we have follow up care waiting for when she comes home.  I appreciate you taking the time to share & for your concern.    It's really cool how many of you recognize how serious this is. You're all going through this & all of you are taking the time to say 'hey this is something that needs attention & it needs to be handled delicately!'  That's a big deal.
selfharm,334kzz,Mwc_,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:56:56 2015 UTC,"I completely understand that your instinct would be to stop her. What parent wants to see their child in pain? But that is not often the best route. It can drive the behaviour underground, or make it worse due to extra feelings of guilt or of letting you down. Talk to her about what she needs. Perhaps it's if she feels like harming, she comes and gets a hug first. Perhaps if she does harm, she has to come to you to be patched up (if she can handle that one, it's a good one, because it lets you keep an eye on things and whether its escalating. it's not easy to show people your cuts tho).  Just sayin - you sound like an awesome mum. The worst thing you could do is ignore it and hope it goes away like my parents did. Get out there, talk about it. Get help for yourself as well. Make sure no topics of conversation are taboo in your house, and you're well on the way to creating a comfortable, healing environment."

She's in a hospital now & I've got an army lined up for all of us when she comes home.  All of you are helping so much! It's really helping me to understand what's going on with her.  She's having trouble articulating that right now.   We have a general 'no subject is off limits' thing going on in our home already. I'm glad to hear y'all think that's important too.  I think I'm going to try to help with finding alternatives & let her know if she can't help it & it happens anyway that she can come to me tonhelp patch up with no worries of repercussions.  I wouldn't have thought of that without your input. So again, I thank you."

I can remember one instance in TinyChat (just some live chat room the sub has you can find it somewhere around here if you want) Some guy was sitting there talking about suicide and I was sitting there with a bottle of pills already in my stomach. We kinda just vented in chat and wanting to die. I was close, I had an arsenal of daggers, swords, and axes getting ready to just disembowel myself or something. The most anyone could really do to try to help was try convince me to throw them up (I didn't) and post hotlines. I guess the think of your friends and family approach doesn't work well when you have no friends and hate the majority of your family.  tl;dr We're a handful. besides I'm not worth it.

I'm a real big believer in everything happens for a reason & people come into our lives & out of them sometimes when we need them. I'm not super religious or spiritual or anything like that.  I just believe in humanity.  I think we've all lost our way a little bit.  It happens.  However, I think the only way to get some of that back is to reach out to one another & help each other. It doesn't take much.  Sometimes all someone needs is a smile or a hello or a hug.  Sometimes they need a whole lot of help.  Some days are for propping up, ya know?  So yeah.  I mean it. And beyond all of that, you've been great.  You've taken the time to share your experience with me, someone who said 'hey, I need a little help'. That's really cool. And I appreciate it.

Why/why not? Again, it's ok if you don't want to share.  I'm hoping to learn more about this & see if there's more we (by we I mean our community/society) can do to help. I feel like there are a lot of kids/people who are hurting in silence.  My daughter reached out.  Not everyone can.  I just wonder why that is."
selfharm,334kzz,myroomiscoldinwinter,4,Sun Apr 19 16:16:46 2015 UTC,"It's because I hate myself. I feel this pain and the only way to get rid of it is to cut/burn/stab/hit/.... the list goes on and on. During that time it hurts worse but I can control the pain. After that I just feel like shit though. Then the cycle repeats. Eventually I'll try to kill myself and fail. I'm so useless I can't even manage that, so then It just gets worse and worse. The whole thing is just a vicious cycle.  I guess for me it's just a control thing. Sure it hurts more than before but I can control it. Makes me feel like I can actually do something.  Hope you can help her. I wish I could tell someone.  Edit Grammar."
selfharm,334kzz,Mwc_,3,Sun Apr 19 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much for sharing this. That's really powerful.    You knew what's helping her now?  The place where she's at. She's in a place where they are all going through it.  They have different stories and reasons why they're there but they're all hurting and they've all but given up on life.  It doesn't cost anything & no one had to take her there.  We all made a decision together, including her, she needed to go. But you can go yourself.  Walk into any emergency room & tell them what you're feeling. You won't believe what happens & how many people really do care.  Complete strangers who don't owe you anything, care because you're another person & you're worth caring about."
selfharm,334kzz,myroomiscoldinwinter,5,Sun Apr 19 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"unfortunately here in the US it's really expensive. Even as a 15 yo I understand how expensive anything health related is. My father, who apparently loves me, probably wouldn't help my mother because she's supoosed to cover medical stuff. She's too poor to do anything major like that; so I hide it. I have a therapist since my parents think I'm depressed but I don't know how to say this after lying for so long. I'm sure at some point in everyones life they got caught up in something that led to a chain of lies. Then found it hard to tell the truth after lying for so long. It's hard to be honest after years of lying. To be honest I don't have a single friend in real life. People know I'm smart and will ask me for help(usually logic, programming, hacking, science, or something along those lines) but that's about it. I care more about the people here than I do at my own school."
selfharm,334kzz,myroomiscoldinwinter,2,Sun Apr 19 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"We're in the US also.  A lot of people think the same thing & I'll admit I did too. But it doesn't cost anything.  My daughter's school counselor called me because a friend of hers was concerned about some of the things she was saying.  I didn't know what to do or who to call. I called her drs office & the nurse there was really kind. She told me to take her to the emergency room & tell them she was having thoughts of hurting herself & they'll take it from there.   I'm a broke mom too & the only money I've spent is the gas in my car to get to the hospital for visiting day.  They're not charging us for anything.  These services are out there just so many people don't know.   As for the years of lying, it's gotta start somewhere.  A burden this big is so much to carry on your own.  Your parents love you, you've said that yourself.  They just may not know how to help or where to go or what to do. I know I didn't.  I just started yelling to every one who would listen for help.  Not everyone knows they can do that.  I know my daughter didn't."

selfharm,333cm9,Jeniikyou,2,Sun Apr 19 04:07:17 2015 UTC,You probably think you want to but you don't. I stab and it takes an insane amount of pain tolerance to go any deeper than an inch. The deepest I ever got was about 3-3.5 inches. It really hurts beyond what most people would do for SH.

Or rather, it's also sometimes a habit, and sometimes a coping mechanism, and sometimes an act of self-loathing, but all those reasons I understand and don't bother me as much. It's this strange longing feeling, and desire to be worse, and envy that is attached to it that I don't understand and bothers me because I know it's delusional and disconnected from anything that I can explain and even seeing tat doesn't seem to matter and I don't even know if I'm making sense here."
selfharm,333cm9,Mysterious_Drifter,2,Tue Apr 21 00:15:50 2015 UTC,"The most validating thing I can do for myself is to create lasting physical manifestations of my illness.   YUP, this is exactly how I feel. People can't see how depressed or hurting someone is and there isn't even really a scale for it. So maybe if I have some physical marks then people can see that I am hurting, I'm hurting a lot. And it's not even for others to see really (for me at least). I suffer from DP/DR and I find that after a horrible night the next day I completely forget what happened. I have such a fast/automatic response to deny and forget anything that wasn't a good day. I tried journaling but by the time I wrote out a few things during an episode I felt like what I was writing sounded so pathetic and embarrassing that I always threw them out/burned them. Scars mark the times I have suffered, but don't have the embarrassing details of exactly how I was feeling at the time.  On another note if scars are what you are looking for, you don't have to go that deep. There are other ways you can encourage scaring that I believe (I'm not a medical expert) are less dangerous then deep cutting."
selfharm,333cm9,Death-Chan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:51:49 2015 UTC,"That reason for self harm makes sense to me.  I am never quite sure if it's for other people or myself. Some of both, probably, though the former makes me hate myself so I try not to think about it. But I also spend a lot of time looking at my scars, photographing them (though I never show anyone), drawing them... I am rather fixated. Maybe just because it gives me something to fixate on and I need that. I don't know, it's all hard to untangle. It's just come to my attention that how I feel about self harm isn't very rational at all, even when I'm in a pretty reasonable mindset about other things.  On the other note, message me please?"

But, regardless of how he looks to me, you love him, and you must be feeling devastated. Let me tell you though, as someone who has been there- the heartache fades, along with the love blinkers, and you'll see him for who he truly is. No one who loves you for who you are would ask you to prove your love for them with some extraordinary act.  As for the cut, keep it sealed and covered. Antibiotic creams can help. If you can wear long sleeves, do that, otherwise if you can cover it with a bandaid go with that.  Perhaps it might be time to see a professional about what is going on in your life? It sounds like you just really need someone to talk to who is completely on your side, and is there for your support.  Good luck. Don't take the arsehole back. (Kind of joking) ;-)"

I'd use some other oil like olive oil or something because theres no evidence that Vitamin E oil actually works. It also causes rashes. I've gotten weird bumps on my scars from it. Try olive oil or safflower oil. It won't do anything to your skin like the Vitamin E does. The point is to moisturize your scars.

The pressure can be a lot, and not gonna lie the feeling of relapsing and knowing that person is disappointed in you fucking sucks. There's no way around that. On the other hand, it can be an amazing motivation, whether you appreciate it at the time or not, to know that not just a vague ""people"" in general care about you but that that specific person, that name, that face, cares about you. My advice would be to let her keep tabs on you, and if you feel the urge to cut again, try reaching out to her. She's made the first step, so it's plain she cares. Asking for help is hard, I know, but try it. And remember, I care about you too even though I don't have your number/can't keep tabs on you.

I'm not sure what to tell you because you don't seem to be asking for any feedback, but I really hope that you're alright. Please don't be to hard on yourself. I'm not sure if you do it to be beautiful, or to feel in control (like I did), but for whatever cause, depriving yourself of food doesn't really create the answer. I don't mean to sound depressing, I'm just speaking from experience. Obessing over food and starving yourself will never lead to satisfaction. You'll never look in the mirror and think ""I'm thin enough, I'm perfect, I'm happy now."" It doesn't happen. With this sort of obsession just comes poor health and a worse, more distorted perception of your body, not a better one.  If you want perfection, the closest thing I think most people have been able to find is happiness, and ultimately you won't find happiness when you keep yourself in a constant state of hunger. Or when you're so weak from lack of food that you can hardly walk up a flight of stairs, or when your hair is falling out and your skin is dry and itchy all the time from vitamin deficiencies. It's not perfection. It feels awful.  I don't know if telling you to get help will have any affect, and saying that makes me a hypocrite because I wouldn't get help for ages, but if you would go to a professional or just talk to someone about this it will do you so much good.

selfharm,32v7sv,Valhalant,3,Fri Apr 17 00:04:20 2015 UTC,"I used to get really angry too (still get really angry sometimes, but less often.) I don't know how much I can add, but I feel for you. First off, when I used to get really angry, it was not as bad as I've seen some people get, so take what I say with a grain of salt. One thing that has helped though is age. That sucks because there is nothing you can do about it, but I have found getting older has helped a lot. Part of that though is learning that everything will pass. I used to get angry as a teen for reasons that I can't even remember, and if I do, I have no understanding of why that made me mad. And realizing that, when I get angry now, I just remind myself that it will pass, but whatever actions I take in that moment won't. That usually calms me down. You can also try screaming into a pillow, or running. A punching bad is a good idea (and won't make you more aggressive, it'll just wear you out – I used to be a boxer, so speaking from experience.) A lot of times anger is just pent up energy. Find something to direct your energy towards, a hobby, a sport. It won't necessarily help when you're angry per se, but should lower the frequency and intensity of your anger. Hope that helps."

selfharm,32u0n0,1864752987,2,Thu Apr 16 20:53:50 2015 UTC,Because you build it up such that you expect a big release in your mind and when you actually do it you make the usual cuts and still get a release. Your body and mind also recognize that the damage that you were thinking of inflicting upon yourself is not going to be pleasant and will end up causing more distress rather than facilitating a release.

selfharm,32spgf,c_marier,7,Thu Apr 16 12:15:35 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a really tricky situation. While I understand the desire to be friends...I really don't think that it's going to work if him starting to self harm and potentially trying to manipulate you is the product of that friendship.   Him starting to self-harm is not your fault at all, regardless of why he says he's self harming. It may be that he is actually trying to understand, but this is not an appropriate way to do that. Furthermore, it may be to try and make you get back with him through sympathy or because he thinks it will give you something to bond over (consciously or subconsciously: If I do this, she will love me/care for me because I am like her). I can also see how that would be belittling and hurtful. And if he has genuinely started to self-harm...well, I can understand wanting to be supportive, but I don't think it would be good for him for you to encourage the behaviour by awarding your attention, and I don't think it would be good for you to sink that much energy into someone else's recovery.   I'm not suggesting that you cut him off by making a scene about why his actions are wrong or anything like that, because chances are it'll only make the actions worse (because of the attention) or make one of you feel really shitty about what's happened. I would probably have a conversation or two with him about how it's not okay to be self-harming to understand someone else's self-harm and that if that's the case you would like him to stop immediately, but I would keep them short, to the point, and I would have ""plans"" at a specific time so that the conversation doesn't drag out.  I would probably end the friendship soon after that. What I'm talking about is something I like to call ""the slow fade"". Start decreasing the amount of time you spend together, start having a lot of plans, be ""busy"" all the time. Invent relatives who are visiting (I've done this, one of my more desperate moves). My experience with people is once your ""busy"" all the time they become busy with other people too. Where this has the potential to be really crappy if it blows up in your face, this is the approach I would take. I'm currently performing the ""slow fade"" on someone right now because staying in the friendship is increasingly bad for my mental health, but I work with them so don't want to cause a scene and make them feel horrible.   I don't know if this is moral advice, or good advice, but it is what I would do in your situation in order to preserve my own mental health. If you're not taking care of you, you can't take care of someone else too."
selfharm,32spgf,suicidejunkie,3,Thu Apr 16 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"I'm really doubtful that anyone would really self-harm for that long just to try to understand someone else. If he were just genuinely curious with nothing else to it, he might have tried it once, made a couple of cuts, realised the appeal of it, and then stopped doing it before it became habitual. I would guess that the reason he gave you is just how he rationalises his own self-harm, and he is in denial about the real reasons for his behaviour, or at least he doesn't want to tell you his real reasoning. Tell him to seek help, and then cut off contact with him."

Tell your friends about his obsessive behavior and that you don't want to hang out with him for your own sake. It's definitely not your fault, he makes his own choices. You are not responsible for him. You do not have to be friends with him. He does not want your friendship anyway, he is just using that as a way to stay close to you in order to try different things to get you back.

It will lighten and flatten the scars. It may take a while, but with daily application, you should notice a difference in a few months.    My step-dad is a retired plastic surgeon, and as far as all the scar treatments go (the topical rub on kinds) he says they are about the same.  He says they wouldn't do much for me because my scars are light and not very raised. (according to him, I scar well--meaning I don't have dark/raised scars, but instead have light/flat ones that are not so easily visible).  He does say that the dark raised scars can improve.  Also, keeping wounds out of the sun (or using a good strong sunblock) for the first six months or so will help minimize scarring."

selfharm,32qsw0,meredev,3,Wed Apr 15 23:37:43 2015 UTC,"This is completely relevant to the sub! I haven't thrown out blades in the past with the conviction you're describing, but I have not harmed before simply because blades were more difficult to get at.   One thing some people do if they're not quite ready to throw them out yet, but don't want them readily available is hide them from themselves, make them difficult to get to. For instance, in my room, I have a very tall shelf in my closet that I can't reach without a chair. I would put them in a small box or something and place them up there behind a couple things. That way if I had the desire to self harm, it would take more effort for me to get my tools, but I would know that if things got desperate enough I could get to them (taking the time to go get the chair and to move the things in front also might give time to reconsider and to cool down from the initial urge).   I found not having blades around when I was sh free for a while was helpful because when I felt like self-harming, it was a lot more effort to go and get blades, but I can definitely understand why you wouldn't be 100 percent excited to get rid of them.

Someone posted here at some point about how they quit, but still had their blades because it was comforting to have around. But I also know lots of people throw them out, for many of the same reasons suicidejunkie points out. It's very hard to give into the urges if you are physically incapable of doing so, at least not without a lot of effort. That principle is one I try to use in my life when I can by just making it really hard to follow through on impulses.

selfharm,32ql8l,Robin_Could,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:08:04 2015 UTC,"cardboard cuts are painful and annoying.  As far as scarring, don't expose the area to the sun for six months, and it will minimize scarring--actually, a good strong sunscreen if you must be in the sun is fine.  Yeah, I used to love getting accidentally injured, because it was a wound I Could wear with pride--I didn't make it, but I still got hurt. Then, I would get paranoid over accidental injuries, because I'd be afraid people would think they were on purpose.  Now, I just let life happen.  It's been at least five years since I've injured (not basic cutting, but other more serious stuffs),and even longer since I've done the generic cutting."

I don't self harm because of him anymore or even often then, but the first time I ever did self harm I was about 13, at the end of my rope and thought well...""so and so likes girls who do this"". That was the first time and it was basically because I was stressed and his last few girlfriends had been cutters, what I didn't count on was cutting being so effective in helping me cope with shit (in a bad way). It was a recurring coping mecahnism a couple times per year in my teens, but my real issue started last year in my third year of university. I blame him a bit for what went down emotionally back then and I blame myself for picking up a habit because I wanted him to like me too. He was a piece of shit to me and drug it out for years, but at the end of the day it was my decision and my body, just not a very well informed decision.   Similarly to you, idk what mine hopes to accomplish when he messages me at 2 or 3 am (well, I know but..Idk why he tries) asking what I'm doing and how I'm doing. I don't really want him in my life and I think you made the right decision to cut this guy out of your life. I relate to your story on quite a few different levels. I think it's very strong of you to cut him off and that you've stopped self-harming. Be safe out there <3"
selfharm,32ofie,suicidejunkie,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"That really sucks, I'm sorry you went through that. ): I cut mostly to escape the suffering I felt and hoped he would notice and care... but I was wrong. In the end he didn't really care about anything, including me. That's why it's driving me crazy that he texted... he admitted that letting me go would be the best thing for me, so why is he reaching out?? Sorry I'm just thinking out loud lol I'm still struggling to find the strength to ignore him, but I just think about how much I hurt myself when I was with him and how suffering it was and how angry I am at him for abandoning me. ""Hey you"" doesn't fix anything haha. Thanks for sharing. <3"
selfharm,32ofie,suicidejunkie,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"why is he reaching out??   It could be  variety of reasons. He might be reaching out out of guilt, or genuine curiosity as to what's up, or to see if he can manipulate you. It really depends on what he wants from you. My ex usually messages me because he wants to talk to me about his dick (classy). No, these messages do not fix anything at all and I think you're best to keep ignoring him. In your situation, he's already hurt you and you've made the position clear. Inviting him back in in any capacity probably isn't the healthiest."
selfharm,32nkwh,Smalls139,12,Wed Apr 15 05:35:36 2015 UTC,"I hope you know they did it because they care. I'm assuming you're a teenager, and that they are too. They probably love you extremely much, and wanted to help, and did it in the only way they knew. I know you'll be mad, and that's understandable. Hell, I was pissed for weeks when my friends called my parents. I just want you to try and rationalise this, and eventually forgive and understand. Trust me, they did it out of pure love."
selfharm,32nkwh,LettuceAndSandwich,-2,Wed Apr 15 06:41:16 2015 UTC,"That's bullshit. I'm sure you know as you're typing that out that it's bullshit. They have no idea what's going on and their solution is to tell someone who they think can ""fix"" you...bullshit. Fuck people."
selfharm,32nkwh,Cutting_Alt,2,Sat Apr 18 17:07:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, I never used the word 'fix'. You do not 'fix' people. They aren't like a chair missing a leg or a microwave not working. We are human being, and we are helped. Never fixed.   Secondly, I would like to add that logically, what the friends did is the best solution. It's like taking a drug addict to rehab: he will be mad, say it's ""shitty"", but in the end, he needs help. I think it's pretty straightforward, but maybe you need me to explain even more. This is how the friend thinks:  Problem: Friend is in psychological agony. I love my friend. I want to help. I am too young to help. I have no education in psychology. I will tell an adult. Adult will take friend to a professional. Friend's illness will be treated. Friend may be happy again. That's all I want.  So:  Friend ill and in extreme mental pain→He tells me, I can't help→I tell adult→Adult take charge→Gets my friend help→My friend could get better.  It's all pretty logical. To be honest. Would you not help a drugaddict? (Self harm and drug addiction have many similarities.) The friends did what they had to do. They did it out of care and love. If they had kept quiet, they would have been extremely shitty friends. Face it: selfharmers need help. Professional help. I've selfharmed for 2-3 years, and I accept it. What we do is fucked up. We need help. We need professional help. And that's okay. People who 'tell on us' are simply helping us to get what we need. Professional help."
selfharm,32nkwh,LettuceAndSandwich,2,Sat Apr 18 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"Why in the hell would anyone downvote this? Everything you said was exactly accurate, especially including the idea that people struggling with life need ""fixing"" when that is never the case. Justifying slashing your own wrists on a regular basis to escape from negative affective experiences by saying ""Well, at least I'm not an alcoholic"" is such a good example of how addictive and denial-inducing these behaviors are. A self-harmer may tell himself it's okay because he's not an alcoholic, but the alcoholic is telling himself it's okay because he's not doing heroin. All three can ruin your life."
selfharm,32nkwh,TheWetRat,-1,Sun Apr 19 04:37:58 2015 UTC,"You say ""we need professional help"". Why? Does everyone who drinks or smokes or is overweight need professional help? It's a way of coping with life. Yeah, if you're like Coldnessinmyheart, you need professional help, just like if you're an alcoholic or obese or addicted to meth or something you need professional help. A coping mechanism isn't the same as an addiction."
selfharm,32nkwh,Cutting_Alt,2,Sat Apr 18 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"Overweight people need professional help. That's my personal opinion.  And yes, a coping mechanism isn't the same as an addiction. But if it is a destructive mechanism you need help to find a mechanism that isn't destructive yet works as effectively."
selfharm,32nkwh,LettuceAndSandwich,0,Sat Apr 18 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"Alright, fine, overweight people do. Yeah, I guess I can agree with you there. But the others? People who smoke, or drink, or use recreational drugs?(for the sake of argument, assume they're using them legally). Do they all need professional help? And if they do, what about all the other habits people have that are harmful? Do they all need professional help?"
selfharm,32nkwh,Cutting_Alt,2,Sat Apr 18 19:45:43 2015 UTC,"If they are doing them recreationally, maybe. If it's just for fun, and they can live well without these, no. But self harm isn't recreational. I don't do it for fun. I don't think many people do it for fun. It's difficult for a self harmer to live without the harming, and quitting is often a struggle.   All I'm saying is that if you have an addition, or have trouble living without something harmful/destructive, you need professional help. If you don't have trouble quitting, you probably don't need help, you need to stop, by respect for yourself and others.  (Oh, and are you a fellow shitlord? For the overweight thing)"
selfharm,32nkwh,LettuceAndSandwich,0,Sat Apr 18 19:54:28 2015 UTC,"You don't need to explain the concept of self harm to me. Believe me. I can't even say ""been there"", it's more ""currently there"". But many people, I'd venture to say most people, have something in their life that is harmful, and helps them get through life, and it comes in more forms that I can list. Alcohol, marijuana, sugar, tobacco, even the Internet. Self harm is one of these, and there's nothing that makes them any different from the rest. Arguably, it's one of the least harmful. Alcoholism can kill you much faster than cutting, serious drug addictions even quicker than that. Yeah, some people slice their skin to get through the day. I'm one of them, and so is the OP. And nobody has any right to judge a cutter as long as they're sitting there, picking up their joint, beer, cigarette, or soda. And I doubt there's many people who don't use at least one of those, in some form, regularly."
selfharm,32nkwh,Cutting_Alt,2,Sat Apr 18 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not explaining the concept, I just fail to see how you're thinking. Sure, other people do bad things. And sure, that doesn't give them the right to criticise us. But it also doesn't justify what we're doing.   I don't think we'll get anywhere, so maybe just end this here? You have an interesting point of view, thank you for this. Have an awesome day! And stay safe"
selfharm,32nkwh,LettuceAndSandwich,0,Sat Apr 18 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't justify what we're doing. But, for example, the ""friend"" in the OP's example, I'm sure they've done one or more of the things I listed, and then they report them because cutting has a bullshit stigma. That's really the point I was trying to make. If you want to end it that's fine, but I just wanted to clarify my reasoning."
selfharm,32nkwh,Cutting_Alt,6,Sat Apr 18 21:54:19 2015 UTC,"If I was doing something like that and my friend didn't try to find help for me, I wouldn't call them much of a friend."
selfharm,32nkwh,TheWetRat,-1,Wed Apr 15 08:43:37 2015 UTC,"I fucking hate how peoole just don't understand... I don't expect them too... its just too complex with everyone having a different way of dealing. Sometimes you just need to talk to someone, but the typical person will just end up doing something that pisses you off (although they are trying to help).  When I was in the hospital, and hated being there, I was about to finally be free, and then my ex intervened and I ended up having to stay longer.  She thought it was the right thing... it pissed me off sooooo much.  She just didn't get it, probably still doesn't but for me, that was a huge trust breaker.   That and other things is well, why she is ex.  Life is shit people try to help, you just need to find people who ""help"" in a way that you deem acceptable. Fortunately for me my aunts are awesome to talk with.  So they and random internet people are who I confide in to help with shit that I believe most will overreact to.  (Sry for brain dump, I just feel bad that things went so shitty for you.  But really friend was trying to help, but that doeant mean you have to like the way they handled it.  You don't have to continue confiding in them, but I'd say don't hold it against them either.  They are a friend for some reason, keep them a friend for that... just don't talk to them about sh issues, hell reddit is epic for that imo)"

Screw them, screw them all.  They said i wasnt allowed on school grounds and sent me home with all my stuff, said i cant come back till i get a note from a psychiatrist saying im not dangerous. I went to see him right away though and got the note, my psych agreed with me and shook his head. Just cause im mentally ill doesnt mean i shouldnt be allowed to come to school. Ugh this shit is fucked up, i hate school so so so much. Even though i got the note im not gonna go back to school for a while because well, fuck them. They wanted me gone, ill gladly take them up on the offer. School is torture for me. Sitting down and staying still for so long, not learning a thing, just thinking bad thoughts. But it still pisses me off so much that they just up and kicked me out like that.  Sometimes i wonder if my brain is just different. Maybe i wasnt meant to live - in the past, people like me died pretty quickly whether it was by their own actions or being killed/locked up by others. But really. If you took a scan of my brain, would it be all fucked up? Probably thered be like all kinds of shit there like alphabet soup and stuff haha. Whatever, i dont even care anymore.

I loathed institutionalized learning all throughout my schooling. Still do but I'm forcing myself through college for whatever reason.   They have to do their part in assuring the other students' safety, but I think they're going about it the wrong way. It's incredibly shitty of them to cast away anyone, but it's probably just misguided judgement. I really hope you don't take it to heart too much, awful as it may be.

selfharm,32hs0m,TheWetRat,2,Mon Apr 13 22:57:47 2015 UTC,"You never really have to go.   However, you will likely still benefit from it. Generally it's recommended that you decrease your frequency of visits until you and your therapist/counsellor/treatment team together decide that it is not necessary for you anymore.   Of course not everyone is the same and I don't really know the situation, but that's my general advice here."

selfharm,32hs0m,MicJaggs,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"In regards to developing a psychiatric disorder...   Keeping with counselling/therapy until both you and your treatment team believe you aren't may be protective. However, there are many factors that go into the development and not going certainly doesn't guarantee that you'll develop one.   So long as you're open about returning later if you feel you need it, stopping now likely won't be detrimental."

I told him because he was going through a rough spot and was saying things that were scaring me about possibly hurting himself/suicidal thoughts. I showed him my scars because I was trying to help him understand that everyone fights battles and that it can get better and that I didn't blame him for struggling. I wanted him to feel like he could talk to me without judgement.   Instead he judged me. It sucked, and I felt dirty. It didnt even matter that the scars were old and that I'd long ago stopped. I was still a leper to him. He has never again talked about hurting himself, though, so that makes it worth it. People will either understand or they wont. I have decided not to tell any more people in the future. Let the secret fade with the scars."

selfharm,32d7io,jetsam52,7,Mon Apr 13 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"For sure, I wasn't planning on telling them what exactly they were, they are way too young for that and I don't want to be the one to ruin their naivety on the matter. It's just a tricky topic, you know? I don't want to lie, I don't want to tell them, and above all I want them to feel like they can ask me things - and when they're older if they need an in-depth answer I want to be able to do that.  I did talk to my in-laws and they said to lie by omission, and how I played it off is how they'd take it. So I guess I'll just tell them getting hurt happens and shrug it off, maybe goof around with it."

With someone the age of your nieces, I would probably just say ""OH,  they are old owies, but they are healed now.""  You aren't lying, and you aren't telling them what happened.  If they ask what the owies are from, or how you got them, then it becomes trickier.  But, I've never had anyone that young ask beyond that."

selfharm,32dzzl,mereintheair,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:34:32 2015 UTC,"I have worked with kids and had scars.  Most of them don't ask even if they notice.  Some do.  I merely tell them they are old owies and that usually works. (we're talking younger kids here).  Older kids might be dealing with this themselves or with their friends.  If they seem to know what the scars are from, I will tell them I used to have a problem, but am better now. (I did at one point work with a group of at risk youth, and I knew some of them had this problem, though not who.  It was during a SUPER HOT summer, so long sleeves were not an option--especially since the dorms we stayed in at night were not air conditioned.)  If they talk to me about having a problem with this (Or a friend that has a problem), then it gets more serious.  I listen as well as I can, and try to be as supportive as I can.  If they are injuring, I let them know that they need to tell their parents (if they haven't done so already).  I offer to help with that, or hook them up with the school counselor to help.  But, I don't feel that I can keep it a secret from parents.  If it's a friend, the situation is a little different. I mostly listen and give the best advice I can and suggest counseling for both that person and/or that friend.  As far as scar removal goes, depending on your scars, you may or may not see a good result. My scars are a little lighter than the rest of my skin, and not particularly raised, so my step-dad (retired plastic surgeon) said that scar reducing products will not help me. He says I scar really well, in that my scars aren't super noticeable.  If however your scars are darker than your skin (red) and/or raised, then scar removal products will probably give you some improvement, but not make them disappear.  It will lighten them and make them less raised."

If they become pushy, i tell them it is none of their business and change the subject.  I use bepanthen scar treatment which is a silicone gel that helps to improve the appearance of scars, and fresh or scabbing wounds I keep covered with a sweat band.  When I worked in childcare, the under five year olds either didn't notice, or accepted the 'it's an old owie from long ago' answer.  In my experience, adults generally don't ask questions, or if they do, they usually just ask what happened, and stop pushing when you say 'nothing'."

selfharm,32cwhq,suicidejunkie,3,Sun Apr 12 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"I went to a prestigious all girl's high school that boasted a 100% college attendance rate.  I was at the top of my class, and in all the AP classes and was one of the ones most likely to succeed.  I got into a prestigious Engineering/math/science school, and did alright there. (doing alright there, was really saying a lot. They hadn't had any grade inflation ever, there were only two 4.0s in the history of the school, one senior my freshman year ALMOST had a 4.0, but she got an A- in one class!)    Then, things got really bad for me--a TON Of bad stuff happened and I had my first major breakdown and I left that school.  I transferred to a MUCH easier school, and even though I had plans to go back to the other school, that never happened.  It took me eight years to get my four year degree, but I got it.  I also managed to graduate Cum Laude.  I would have preferred Magna or Suma, but by the time I got done, Cum Laude was pretty good.  For a while, I either had a 4.0 semester or a semester of W's. (because I had withdrawn-- I was spending more time in the hospital than in school, and there was NO way I could concentrated on school work.).  Eventually, I got to the point where I could handle my semesters w/out having to drop out, even if I didn't get a 4.0.  I had to learn to be nicer to myself, and I had to realize that sometimes I wouldn't do as well as I wanted because I was dealing with stuff.  I was on disability at that point, and I had a letter at the school disability office, so I guess I could have asked for accommodations if I needed them.  No one was really sure what those would be--except that I could make up my work if I were gone because of being in the hospital or another psych emergency.  But really, my letter didn't do much for me.   I had to learn to be nice to myself, do the best I could at the time on my work, and keep on keeping on to eventually get to my goal of a degree.  I got it, got off disability (for a while--other issues came up and I'm on it again now...), and worked for several years.  TL DR be nice to yourself. Do the best you can on your work at the time given all your stuff, and keep on keeping on.  You can get your degree, and even if you don't score as well as you would like, a degree is a degree!!"

I've simply had to accept that I won't be able to do as well as I should do with regards to schoolwork, but I'm trying my best and I just have to accept that I'm limited in what I can do right now.  Of course it's not exactly the same for you, and it can be horrible to feel like you're letting yourself down, but I think it's important to realize that you're trying your hardest and being kind and compassionate to yourself is the best you can do (although that's easier said than done).

selfharm,32d0je,illgivethisa,2,Mon Apr 13 04:54:17 2015 UTC,"Self harm is absolutely a drug.  It's not ""like a drug"", it is a drug.    Drugs work by stimulating parts of the brain to alter the state of mind.  Alcohol works as a depressant, THC (weed) works by stimulating dopamine, etc.  Now, believe it or not, self harm alone stimulates dopamine, endorphins, and a central nervous system depressant.  Continual use of self-harm over time can and will cause permanent central nervous system re-wiring that causes you to become addicted to the rush.  Self harm isn't only like a drug, it is a drug.  It's not widely understood as a drug, simply because it's taboo and not well-understood.    But, if you break down every chemical released during a self-harm episode and the mentality of those who frequently do it, it very much so is a drug.  You and your girlfriend are in the same boat drug-wise.  You're both displaying symptoms of addiction and denial.    Before you break up with her over this, discuss it with her.  It's not fair for you to be upset with her over her smoking habit, considering you're doing the same thing to yourself."

I called and was on hold for 20 minutes, then when I was actually talking to someone, as soon as she found out I wasn't suicidal she just wanted me gone.

Speaking from experience of 12+ years, there does come a point, or sometimes a person, in your life when things start to get better.  You will be able to feel for a time.

selfharm,327skw,sparrow_lately,3,Sat Apr 11 09:26:31 2015 UTC,"All of these are valid reasons for stress and concern, but that doesn't mean you should handle this stress with self harm. It's hard to find a better way to deal with stress when you're so used to distracting it with pain, but being stressed is not a reason to punish yourself. I still struggle with finding alternative methods, but some that I use are creative outlets such as drawing or writing. You could distract yourself with reading or learning something new or that interests you, even apply it to your goals of getting a masters in education such as reading up on new studies in effective teaching methods. Hell, even surfing the web on ways to handle stress can distract you and give you tools to use in the future! Distractions are more in-the-moment things for when you don't have other resources to deal with these impulses, but therapy or counselling may be a good idea to figure out why you get those compulsions and to help you take care of the problem.   Being around kids is a tough one, but in this moment I think you should be focusing on making yourself better because once that happens, you'll probably be more comfortable with yourself and thus more comfortable and suited to be around children. sparrow_lately needs to focus on sparrow_lately to be able to attain your goals.   Even if you're having trouble loving yourself, that doesn't mean you're unlovable. You have a fiancé who I'm sure loves you. I don't know your background or why you don't know when you'll see your fiancé again, but just think, they're out there and they love you and it will be amazing when you finally reunite :)  As far as sleep goes, this may be unrelated, but screen-time can hinder sleep so possibly read paper-back or do some hands-on activities that don't involve TV or a computer. There's also this program called flux that you can install that changes the color contrast of your computer screen according to the time of day to cut back on exposure to blue light which is said to inhibit sleep. Here's an article on the effects of blue light if you're interested.  Finally, you can't be responsible for other people's actions and behaviour, only your own. Therefore, you aren't responsibly for your friend's behaviour (I don't know how you would be anyway) but you also aren't responsible for your mother blaming you. It's really shitty that she feels that way, but you can't take that to heart or it will be bad for you. Oftentimes people just look for a scapegoat to deal with issues and feelings they don't know how to deal with. Your mother is misguided in thinking you are in charge of your friends' feelings when in reality, the only one who can control that is your friend and they may need to seek help if their behaviour is negatively impacting them or people around them.   Consider that when you think about self harm as well. All this shit that's happening around you, you can only do so much about. What really matters is how you cope with it. There is no shame in seeking help to develop tools to handle it and I highly recommend it, from personal experience. There are suicide hotlines that are free and even though you aren't suicidal, the people on the other end of the line are sure to have dealt with self harm issues as well. If you just need to work through things and talk about them, there are chatrooms and such like this one that can help you get stuff off your chest as well. It'll be hard, but it's worth it. My scars are a part of me and tell me where I've been, but I won't let them define me. I hope you don't either.

I mean what's the difference between self harm and drinking anyway, why is one more acceptable than the other? Why are prescribed medications more socially acceptable than addiction? What the fuck is the difference if it's all self destruction?  I'm not in a good place right now and I felt moved by your post. I relate to it a lot as I'm engaged in self harm, alcohol use, and I'm using other drugs pretty regularly too.

That's an inspiration as I'm trying to stay clean too. Without selfharm though, I seem to have a wheel of bad coping strategies. Drinking is a big one since I don't have access to cannabis or anything where I live now. If I don't have alcohol, I tend to binge eat/purge which I tell myself is better because it doesn't leave scars. I'm trying to stop drinking and learn to use real coping skills, like work on my art instead, but it's difficult because being busy vs not being able to obsess or worry isn't the same."

It doesn't work all the time, but it helps me at least feel more relaxed, so eventually I'll get to sleep rather than running around my head all night.

I eliminated basically all caffeinated drinks. Coffee is maybe once a week thing, I don't have soda unless there is booze in it, and I go for herbal teas.  I won't say losing weight is the answer, but exercising does help me sleep better. I get up at 5am daily to workout and it helps ensure I'm tired at night. My body will be worn out and sore by bedtime.  I try to not use my bed for anything but sleep. No reading, watching tv or movies, computer and internet. Nothing, just sleeping. I read somewhere once that your mind will begin to associate your bed with awake tasks and that it will make sleeping at night harder? I wish I could find the article again but it's been awhile. With that, it suggested not just laying in bed when you can't sleep because again the association of being awake in bed.  Stay away from light screens for an hour or more before bed. If you need to be on a computer or phone use a dim lighting setting. I use flux on my computer and it tinges the screen red as the sun goes down.  I use a fan for white noise, mostly because I live in a college town, but it's calming and helps.  I bought febreeze with a scent that's supposed to help with sleeping? I'm not sure if it actually works but it smells nice and is relaxing before bed.  I still have nights where I can't fall asleep so I just say fuck it and will stay up all night watching tv or reading or something and then sleep better the next night."

Its only negative affect that I've noticed is it can give you crazy dreams. If you have to sleep with some sort of noise, I would suggest ASMR videos on youtube.

It's scary, and once it starts there's no stopping, but telling your parents is the hardest part.  I know you don't feel it right now but when it gets better it really is a whole new world.

selfharm,324k7n,wigglytuff69,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:25:12 2015 UTC,"Sometimes there are therapy-like resources around if you can find them like councelling through school or a depression support group in your town that may help. It could even be a step toward feeling comfortable telling your parents.   As far as telling your parents goes, sometimes they're surprisingly supportive. I bet your dad would understand. He's already been exposed to it from your mom and probably knows other people with depression, too, so he'll likely be sympathetic. I was in the same boat as you with my mother having a history of depression so I felt slightly more comfortable telling her even though it was terrifying. I just finally realized I had to do something about it and everything else becomes sort of... irrelevant. Telling them can lead to you getting help, not telling them will get you nowhere. It's scary but it's worth it.  I would advise against cutting to feel alive. I've done that and it doesn't help remotely. If you get the urge, perhaps hold an ice cube to feel the cold, but without doing any real damage. That's far from solving the problem, however, so getting professional advice is a very smart thing to do and that you're willing to consider it is amazing.   Some psychologists are really good at making you feel like you can talk to them and are pretty comforting. You just have to give them a chance. With my initial exposure to one, I wrote them off as patronizing and condescending and refused to see one for 8 years or something. Now I have a delightful councilor who I'm much more comfortable around so you just have to find someone who will reach you. Once you do, it gets much more manageable.   I wish you well."

I spent all day crying and hating myself intensely just for what I did last night. It is a really bad habit, and if you can help not starting, it will be much easier. I gave my life to cutting. It consumed me and I fear that I'll never get myself back. Please remember that you are strong and you do not need to cut. Throw your razors away and try something else.

selfharm,31x4je,kabuto548,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:05:45 2015 UTC,"First, I hope you're in an okay spot right now and that you're safe.  I also hope that things work out for you in the safest way possible, whether it means that you get to stay with your host family or go home, but as long as there is someone able to help you through this there who is a professional.    My own self harm started as drinking in college; I held out until a few months before I turned 21, then the second it was my 21st birthday I was at a bar.  That entire year, save for one month, I drank heavily because it seemed everyone else was, but it also set me up for really bad things.  Oddly, I stopped drinking when I started self harming.    Looking at it now, being about eight years stuck in the need to harm, I realized that I had used these same dreams as a coping mechanism.  Which it's great to dream, great to set goals, even if they're little things.  But I also found that when the dreams didn't happen, I'd be even more devastated.  I'm not saying to stop dreaming, but telling you to focus smaller for  a bit.  Moment by moment, day by day.  Set small goals:  I will shower, I will go for a walk, I will talk with my exchange family for a half hour about what I am feeling.  I learned to have to do this the hard way, because I had those big dreams, I ""completed"" a lot of them, and at the end, when everyone else was celebrating, I'd be stuck with that ""Now what do I do?"" feeling/mentality.    So, whatever happens out of this, it will be in your best interest, even if it doesn't feel or seem like it is, and even if it goes against your dream.  Dreams are far better when you're in a better emotional place to enjoy them from.  And when they ask why you were sent home, you say, ""Because I need help.""  And that's where you start.  It's not the actions you did for coping, but the emotions  you just didn't have the tools to know how to cope with.  And admitting to someone that you need the help is the first tool in your toolbox.  And once things get back on track, and if you are sent back to the US, remember, study up for college and find a school with a semester abroad program back to Austria.  Colleges too also have really good counseling services that can help with all of these.  Hope this helps, and I hope you first are able to get someone to talk to close to you in person."

selfharm,31xeg9,TheWetRat,3,Thu Apr 9 05:45:52 2015 UTC,"I do this too. Not so much anymore, but I used to be really bad about it. I also have asthma, but up until eight or so months ago, I didn't use an inhaler. I would run to make me lungs burn and my throat close until it felt like no air was moving in or out. And I would run up hills that would make my legs burn and when I felt like I was going to pass out, I would just walk or sit down until I was just starting to be able to breathe again, then I'd sprint. I did this every day for a really long time.  I kind of looked at stopping as though I were a healthy person exercising and stopping would be silly. Like, if I were any normal person going for runs, stopping would certainly be a 'bad move' and not advisable. So that kind of kept me going for a longer time, too. I still have trouble when I work out. Any time I start going, I feel like I'm not doing anything until it hurts me and I can't breathe.   I feel like I can't do any proper exercise now but I also feel like I should be exercising. It's horrible and I don't have anyone who can relate so I'm sorry I've been talking about me all comment but I couldn't just pass by you with all your parallels and not say something. I'm also in college and I feel so free to do this, like it's totally under the radar in a way, but I don't know.   If you ever want to talk about it or you decide you might want to ease back with it a bit, you can always message me. I get the feeling of not feeling fulfilled until you're about to break, though, so I know that these things may not really be of interest. Anyway, I hope that you stay safe <3"
selfharm,31wd32,Hidden_Sam,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling... Let your therapist check you if you want, you might get a small sense of pride when  they don't find anything.  After awhile, that number doesn't matter, you may realize after so long ""what's the point"" the triggers get less over time and it becomes easier to get through a bad patch.  I'm 27 it's been maybe  a year since my last incident, and before that it was several years. So not worth it but I didn't beat myself up over it. Good luck, hope I got my point across and didn't offend you.  :)"

selfharm,31wd32,nobodyhometoday,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:25:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that you go to therapy so regularly. It means a lot, together with the fact that you will be really disappointed in yourself if you relapse. Those things show how far you have come, that you really are getting better, and trying hard to move past self-harm and depression or whatever troubles you. I feel like that is more important than a number. Numbers can be daunting. I don't find it helpful to keep track of the days since I've hurt myself or engaged in unhealthy habits, because I'm too tempted to say, ""fuck it!"" and reset to zero. Maybe try to focus on why you are not hurting yourself, and not so much on the numbers? Just a different viewpoint. Anyway, way to go, and I hope you can stay safe. Good luck with therapy!"

If they're a few weeks old (from when you stopped) and they're still red you might want to consider seeing if you can get them looked at. Otherwise you can try putting a little Vaseline on them, letting it sit, wiping the Vaseline off after the scab has softened a little bit, and then applying concealer/foundation if you have any. Do NOT do this if it isn't scabbed or healing."

selfharm,31otw4,I_am_Me21,3,Mon Apr 6 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"The only person you have any control over is yourself. If you measure yourself solely on what you perceive to be others understanding of yourself, you're going to have a bad time.   I took the liberty of looking over your post history a little. I want to say 2 things to you.   Don't do anything stupid. I understand it's difficult to see past your present predicament however if you hurt yourself, you'll never find out what happens to you.  You need to measure your self worth against your own yard stick, not anyone else's. If you keep up this internal dialogue of not being worthy and thinking no-one likes you, then it's a self full filling prophecy.    What you have ahead of you is a journey of small incremental steps of gaining some self worth. You may stumble, you may regress, but the human race didn't claw it's way through millions of years of evolution for you to gaze at your navel, give up and expect someone else to pick up the pieces. The only person you can rely on is yourself, so start being someone you can look up to.   My personal advice is to increase your physical activity. Not to get fit, not to lose weight, not for anyone else, but yourself. You need to get your heart pumping, your lungs gasping for chunks of air, you need to get really really uncomfortable. You need your mind to stop taking shit from your body telling it you can't- you fucking can, humans are capable of pushing their bodies to ridiculous extremes, you don't have to do that, but you need to know it's possible. Exhaust yourself. Rest a day. Do it again. Let the anger/sadness/self loathing fuel you. You will be amazed at how hard it is to be unhappy, even though you will be sore, even though it will be hard to be motivated every time you do it, that will be an accomplishment. A small step, a foundation towards a better you.  The journey of a 1000 miles begins with a single step. But you need to take it."

selfharm,31otw4,Satanslittlewizard,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:34:05 2015 UTC,"I get it. Really. I understand it is incredibly tough, but you have to stop telling yourself that. I'm not saying you have to believe it straight away, but it's time to pull yourself up on that negative self talk. Remember, one step at a time and you can only work on your own perceptions not anyone else's. If you have the nerve to self harm, you sure as shit have the strength to direct that energy elsewhere. It will take time and resolve, but you need to start looking for the positives, however small, in any situation. The secret to happiness is not other people, or money, or success or possessions. It's the ability to be conscious in a moment of happiness. To see a small thing that you like, to appreciate a moment of quiet that is just for you. As corny as it sounds, getting up early and watching a sunrise, or going for a stroll at dawn, just to appreciate that single moment and be aware that you can be happy. The more you do this, the more moments you will discover and the quieter the negative voices will be. You may not ever totally get over this, but you and you alone are in charge of it. You are the boss inside your own skull and you have every right to tell your brain to shut the fuck up and that it is wrong."
selfharm,31otw4,Satanslittlewizard,2,Tue Apr 7 00:43:58 2015 UTC,"I wish I could do it. I swear I try every day but I can't seem to get the power. I wish I didn't have to power to self harm, I already had body image issues and I made it worse. I am not sure why I am venting to you. I am sorry."
selfharm,31otw4,Satanslittlewizard,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"You are venting to me because I responded and I'm fine with that.   You do not need to apologise, but you do need to work through this.   The single best thing you can do as a start point is this - when you have a self harm urge go an RUN as that punishment. Push yourself that way. You might only get half a block before you are out of breath, crying and wheezing on the sidewalk, so kick your ass and get up again. You don't have to be good anyone else eyes, you don't need to look a certain wa, have the 'right' equipment or be anything other than yourself. And if that's throwing up on the side of the road, then so be it. I guarantee when you drag yourself back, have a shower and collapse you will feel a sliver of accomplishment. Hold onto that sliver, that is the new you.   Think about this. From an evolutionary standpoint, humans are the best endurance runners on the planet. We can chase down game much faster and stronger than ourselves because we have the ability to put mind over matter. To push through exhaustion, through anger through sadness and DEMAND out bodies do our bidding. Your body is designed to run, maybe not fast, maybe not beautifully, but it is written into your genetic code. All of your ancestors to this point have strived to survival to ensure the next generation exists. You are the pinnacle of your current evolutionary chain. Before you, before your parents and grandparents your humanity scratched and clawed and fought its way through life and existence to give you a fighting chance. You owe it to yourself as a human to give it everything you've got. If you want to die then go out fucking swinging! Your humanity demands it."

selfharm,31otw4,Satanslittlewizard,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:39:18 2015 UTC,"See this is the thing. There is no reason to work out other than working out itself. It doesn't matter at this point if your diet is shit. This isn't about looking good or getting healthy at this point. This is about directing those urges elsewhere and feeling truly alive. I don't want to get into the specifics of how your harming or how I may of. The point is I understand that doing that is a way to connect with reality. It's something real that you can feel that isn't hidden in your skull. You need to find a new way to feel real, you need to hurt in a good way, you need to regain the power you have over yourself. You don't have to run, but that's what did it for me. You need to hurt, to overcome, to push, not for anyone else, but to prove to yourself you are worth it. You need to own your failings, accept them then beat them the fuck down. Change that self talk 'I'm working on it' to 'I'm actually fucking doing it'. You're not sure? Fuck that, you had better find out! It's all small steps, you are not going to fix this overnight, but you need to give yourself the chance. If you were brave enough to say this to your mum, you are brave enough to go and give her a hug and say your sorry for upsetting her. That doesn't negate your feelings or sideline the problems, but you need people on your side. She might not be showing it, but I am sure that's desperately where she wants to be. Give her and yourself a chance. Make that your first step. Be clear that you still feel awful, but that your intent is not to hurt her. A good hug can do wonders.   EDIT: This is really worth a read. It's told as a story and is quite short, but it really gives some great tools for dealing with these feelings. I read this during one of my darkest periods and honestly, I was a bit 'meh' at the time.

selfharm,31noik,peasoop,2,Mon Apr 6 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you're from, your history, and your doctor.  In the UK, unless you are considered to be severely psychotic or are literally on the brink of killing yourself, it is unlikely you would be admitted to an inpatient ward. You would likely be referred to an outpatient crisis team who would be there for you while the feelings calm down.  In the USA, as far as I have seen, doctors are much more likely to prescribe inpatient treatment/sectioning.   The most important thing to do is to be honest with your therapist and trust that they (and your doctors) have your best interests at heart. They will do what it takes to keep you alive and well."

selfharm,31noik,arachnophobia-kid,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:24:47 2015 UTC,"No. Involuntary commitment is a last resort only used when the client clearly demonstrates that they are an imminent threat to themselves or someone else. You will not be committed if you make it clear, through both words and behavior, that you are not suicidal and have no intention of killing yourself. It will help if you say that you understand that SIB is dangerous, but you want to stop and you do everything you can to stay safe. Of course, don't say that if it isn't true.  You sometimes hear about people getting committed for SIB. Honestly, I have no idea where those stories come from because as far as I know nobody has ever been committed for having done what I mentioned above. Most likely, the people who were committed were hurting themselves severely (cutting extremely deeply to the point where you could feasibly kill yourself if you wanted to) and were so emotionally upset that the therapist couldn't let them walk out the door and think ""Yeah, they're safe."" People hear about those cases and think that they can't talk about their much more superficial self-injury because they're under the impression that ANY self-injury is cause for commitment when it isn't."

Relapse can be embarrassing and dangerous, but it /can/ be a one time thing. I'll be clean for a year next month, and I'd be lying if I said it's all rainbows. On bad days, not relapsing feels absolutely impossible and it's incredibly tempting.   I really hope you don't buy the eraser. You did relapse, but with the right support and environment you can help prevent another occurrence.   Use the money for the eraser to buy something you enjoy, like candy or ice cream. Like self harm, these also have instant gratification. Also it's the day after easter, so candy is cheap as fuck right now.   Throw out anything that especially triggers you to self harm or give it to someone trusted until you feel safe again. This includes razors, pins, sharp objects or chemical cleaners you might want to use. I think this is the hardest step. I wanted very badly to stop, but I didn't want to let go of my solace. You can't get rid of everything potentially harmful in your house, but items that take ""preparation""  give you time to think about what you're going to do.   If you can, talk to someone!

Anyway, I asked him about the products once--wondering if they would work on my scars.  He said my scars were so good looking, that they wouldn't make any difference. He said I was lucky and 'scarred well' meaning my scars are lighter than the rest of my skin, and not raised much if at all.  He said the anti-scar products work best on red/dark scars that are raised, and after regular use, the scars should get lighter/less raised.  But, he also seemed to think that the anti-scar stuff wasn't entirely needed.  Rubbing straight vitamin E on the scar would also probably work.  Mederma could be good.

selfharm,31jicj,radio_dyke,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:03:57 2015 UTC,What you need right now is to buy yourself some time. Ask for extentions on all your essays and just focus on the exams. I found every single one of my profs was willing to cut me some slack. Most giving me an extra month to complete the work with one giving me three months after I still couldn't get the damn thing done.   Best if you can ask in person but a phone call and even an email will suffice. (Explain a bit about why you cant ask them in person. It helps.) They're not there to see you fail and can be quite compassionate especially in the Humanities.)   If asking for an extension seems too much try the counseling center. They may be able to intervene on your behalf. Get some breathing space and then breath!

If I work on it as planned tomorrow and Wednesday this week, then study for exams for this weekend on Thursday and then i can finish it on the 15th and 16th.

selfharm,31i63a,lonely_in_love,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:30:31 2015 UTC,I can relate to dreams having a big impact. My dreams are always really extensive and vivid and usually involve being with old friends again and being happy and they feel more real than being awake does now. I can spend entire days just lying in bed going back to sleep again and when I am awake I can always remember my dreams in great detail all day and constantly find myself getting caught up thinking about them. Every emotion and feeling I have when dreaming seems much more real than those I have when awake and I can remember how it felt all day after waking up. Started writing my dreams down a couple of weeks ago which is interesting as there's certain places and things that aren't based on anything in reality but keep reappearing and sometimes I'll find two places I've been before are actually connected and part of the same place. It's like my own world I can go to that keeps getting more and more bits of it built each day :)

selfharm,31il3z,orangepoliwhirl,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:59:42 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a negative way of handling situational stress, for sure. In that sense it may have some similarities to self harm since they can both involve doing things that will ultimately be harmful to yourself as a punishment for perceived faults. But this is also the same with other negative coping mechanisms such as burying your feelings with drinking or lashing out in physical violence at close ones. Are these all self harm? No.   Self harm is specifically a mechanism that people use to cope with heightened stress or emotions that involves physical harm. Yeah, he's harming himself socially by isolating himself, but unless he is actually cutting himself (or doing something else to physically cause himself harm) it's not self harm. This recent behavior may stem from the same learned behavior and thought patterns that drove him to self harm initially whenever it was that that happened, but unless you can see marks on his body of recent harm, this is not the same thing."

But when she did ask or bring it up my heart would pound unbelievably. I had that OH SHIT moment too. But the worst was when she saw the cuts on my thigh, and let me tell you, there would be no ordinary excuse for that amount of cuts I had on that space on my leg. But she laughed it off to me scratching myself in my sleep. She's even made a joke on several occasions about me being a cutter. It makes me scared everytime."

But if he or she sees the scars and asks you about them, be honest. You don't need to give a long back story at the beginning, but don't try to make something up to hide it, especially if you want the relationship to work in the long run.  I might be an anomaly since, thankfully, when I met my boyfriend he saw the scars on my arms, but, as he told me later, the thoughts running though his head were things like ""she's really pretty"", ""I wonder if she'd consider dating me"", ""I wonder what her story is"". He's told me multiple times that although those scars are pretty visible, that they tell a story and show that I made it through a really hard time. I'm telling you this story to say that there are people out there who won't mind the scars. Sure, they'll be sad that you have them because it means you went through a really difficult time, but don't be afraid of becoming close to someone because of them."

Reasons for covering up: to avoid causing shock with new injuries, and having to answer questions about bandages. Once the scars are older and less red (and I'm more stable), it is easier to brush off questions and concerns. I still do wear long sleeves at certain times, basically when I don't want someone's first impression of me to be ""that girl with freakish scars"". Most of the time I don't care, people are used to it and sometimes don't notice.   I'm surprised that it is okay for you to work with your scars in the open as a nurse.

selfharm,318qeq,historyandpolitics,2,Thu Apr 2 22:04:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't cut since the middle of November. I did not have a burning desire to stop self harm. In fact, I still want to hurt myself all the time, sometimes very strongly. However, currently the reasons I can't hurt myself continue to outweigh the urges to cut, and that gets me through each day."
selfharm,318qeq,nobodyhometoday,2,Fri Apr 3 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"Just a personal view here, but once I found things that made me happy, I stopped. If you have a hobby or something you enjoy, that can really help."
selfharm,318qeq,chookyratman,2,Fri Apr 3 08:04:10 2015 UTC,"I started cutting when I was about 11 until I was about 22.  One thing that helped me start the process of stopping, was something that my mom said.  She told me that I wouldn't get hired if I went in to an interview with cuts and scars all over my arms.  I grew up really poor and have always been very career driven (its my way of trying to raise myself out of my class).  So the idea that I'd be poor and jobless because I hated myself so much I had to cut just really stuck with me.  After I stopped cutting I filled my compulsive behavior with first heavy drinking, then heavy drug use, then compulsive violent sex, then food (ended up gaining like 60lbs from that).  I've always been a addict in the sense that I cant control my compulsions and switch from one vice too another, always looking for something to fill me.  What Ive learned as Ive gotten older (25yo and havent cut in 3 years)  is that there are always things that can help you forget or numb you from the world but there are always conciquences to those things, and the best thing to do is to fill these urges (which might never go away) with positive outlets (aka coping mechanisms).  I've learned to fill that void with exercise (which helps with my anxiety as well) and BDSM/rough sex.    I hope you do find the will to stop, but its got to come from within yourself.  One day youll wake up and be done with it, a switch will flip and youll say enough is enough (mind you you might have relapses), but eventually one day itll stop feeling good and start feeling bad."
selfharm,318qeq,video-girl,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you can MAKE yourself WANT to stop. I think the best you can do is maybe therapy to try and gain perspective on what you're doing. Why you're doing it, that's where stopping is but nobody knows that but you. Personally, I just try to distract myself. I throw icecubes, I cry, I run. Everyone has some distractions that helps. Trying to stop is the first step I think."

selfharm,318qeq,jetsam52,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:52:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think there's any particular way to make yourself want to stop aside from hitting rock bottom, whether that means life-threatening injuries, skipping work to hurt yourself, hurting yourself at work or in front of other people, or something else. I have not actually hit that point (yet?) so for me all of my reasons for stopping are external to myself - I don't want other people to see the marks, and it's going to stop being seasonal to wear concealing clothes soon, I don't want to cause stress and concern for the people that do know about my cutting, I want to be able to run and wear shorts and t shirts without drawing judgment or fear from other people. Perhaps the only internal motivation that I have that really drives me to stop cutting is that I don't want to feel like I'm a slave to any one particular method of getting my needs met. Other than that, I really do want to cut most days. I miss cutting, and the only people I know who used to cut who don't miss it anymore are people who hit absolute rock bottom and knew they needed to change because where they were at was incompatible with living a decent life.   Unfortunately, as long as you still want to cut or otherwise hurt yourself, there is some part of you that believes one of two things. Either you believe that a compromise can be made - that living a happy, healthy life and hurting yourself to cope with emotional pain are not in categorical opposition, or you don't think you deserve a happy, healthy life. Once you actually come to believe that self harm is not healthy and that you do want to be happy, you will want to stop."

selfharm,314hpd,SultanofShit,3,Wed Apr 1 23:00:40 2015 UTC,Im slightly new to self harming. But i dont know. One day things just broke for me. And i couldnt take feeling so empty anymore. So i started burning myself. Its like once you feel that pain everything else in your life tones down a bit and you can just stop thinking about everything that makes you feel that way. So i guess i do it to calm myself down when i start to overthink.
selfharm,314hpd,PeaceWillWinFearWill,3,Thu Apr 2 02:38:49 2015 UTC,I do it because I can't adequately handle negative emotions and cutting/scratching/burning helps to calm me down. I don't know how else to make myself feel better when I'm sad or angry or lonely.
selfharm,314hpd,Thatscuzuralesbian,2,Thu Apr 2 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"So maybe I misunderstood, but we're sharing our reasons for harming, yeah? Okay, here goes.  Cutting is my coping mechanism. When the feelings get too strong, and the noise in my head gets overwhelming, it grounds me. When I am not able to cut, and the overwhelming feelings cause me to shut down, it makes me feel alive again.  Cutting helps me deal with the stress of being an adult - work, marriage, bills, mortgage, ageing parents. It also helps me deal with the feelings I experience as a result of being adopted.  I struggle to find words to explain how I feel a lot of the time. Cutting helps me to feel the intensity of what i feel without the frustration of meaningless words.  It's not for anyone else, just for me, and I hide most of it from the kids at work, but I care a little less out in public and around my family. It is currently the only coping mechanism I have that provides instant relief."
selfharm,314hpd,Lenaballerina,2,Wed Apr 1 23:29:38 2015 UTC,"I do it because I need to be in control of something. My entire life, everything has been spiraling out of control and I've been left behind to drown. Cutting is something I can do to myself, for me. I need it so I don't lose myself."
selfharm,314hpd,lonely_in_love,2,Thu Apr 2 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"This has always been something I've been interested in knowing. Just to see if anyone else feels the same way. So here's my reasoning:     * I cut almost entirely to punish myself. I feel I deserve it. When things go wrong or something ends negatively I tend to start out angry at whoever/whatever the trigger was but it is never long before I feel like it is my fault. Karma is a mysterious thing and I feel like I deserve whatever bad comes my way because I must've done SOMETHING to deserve it(idk if there is any truth to it, just the way I see it).      *Other times I do it because the voice in my head becomes so relentless when it comes to pointing out all my faults that at least if I cut, it silences that voice for a little while. Like a recognition of, ""hey, I hear you, I know I suck.""  I would also like to add that I too sometimes wish people would notice(as I've never told or talked about it with anyone in the 11 years I've been doing this-wow, I cant believe its been that long, I thought for sure I'd have outgrown it by now). I wish they would notice and cut me some slack, try and help me. But this has not happened yet. I've been trying so hard not too(and have so far succeeded) but I still feel so fucking worthless and I don't have anyway to feel better about it anymore. i got rid of my coping mechanism but not the problem. I just wish I could like myself, for once, even if only an instance. Just see some sort of self-worth in myself. I can't see or think about myself in a positive light and I can't imagine how anyone else could either. I've felt like this as long as I can remember and I am starting to fear I always will. -sigh- anyways, hope lots of people reply to this with their own circumstances as I've always been curious."
selfharm,314hpd,Ifuckinghateyou999,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:43:26 2015 UTC,I feel the same exact way.  My mom always used guilt as a way to manipulate me and my sister.  I used cutting as a way to punish myself when I felt guilty or bad about something I did.
selfharm,314hpd,video-girl,2,Fri Apr 3 13:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm an odd duck.  I started generic cutting type behavior so I wouldn't keep trying to break my arm. (if my arm were covered with cuts I couldn't get medical help for a potentially broken arm).  I was obsessed since a very young age with having a broken arm.  I have to this date never broken a bone, but I occasionally still obsess about it.  I tried to find other ways of getting a cast, but never got one. I did get some surgeries.  I also became addicted to surgeries and being in the hospital.  My self harm switched from trying to break my arm (which I decided would never happen-- I tried and tried and it never worked), and your typical cutting with occasional burning, to finding ways of making myself sick enough to be in the hospital.  I started every few years, then once a year, then a few times a year, and well, that was getting to be too much. It was becoming suspicious.  I eventually came clean about what I was doing, and wound up in a residential care facility for the mentally ill for a few years. (I have bipolar NOS, borderline personality, factitous disorder and anxiety disorder).  Now, I'm self-harm free, but I still think about it a lot.  Sometimes I even plan it, but I never wind up doing it, because there are things in life I really want to do, and if I were sick and in the hospital, I wouldn't get to do them."
selfharm,314hpd,esoper1976,2,Thu Apr 2 01:45:24 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I get this feeling that my own existence is unbearably painful. I'll feel like I need get up and do something, but at the same time I don't want to do anything and feel horribly bored. Cutting helps me feel better when this happens. It's like the pain temporarily resets my emotions."
selfharm,314hpd,aardvark44,2,Thu Apr 2 02:36:26 2015 UTC,"I started cutting because I was sick of feeling lost, and I wanted something visual I could look at to say ""This is what my thoughts look like"".  I've tried for years and years to make sense in words what I feel inside my head, but I've failed time and time again.  Cutting helps me feel a little less confused.  Whenever I'm feeling empty, or confused I look at my cuts and it helps me calm down; it helps things make a bit more sense.  I also cut when I'm just feeling emotionally overwhelmed, and I need to distract myself from the pain.  I've tried so so many things up until I started cutting, but cutting is the only thing that helps (aside from less significant SH that I did before, but cutting does the job a lot better)."
selfharm,314hpd,Jeniikyou,2,Thu Apr 2 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"I started because I felt I was useless, I'd never done anything the help anyone, and I just wanted to feel as though I have something I can control. So I could make myself feel something, instead of letting others make me happy, sad, angry. I needed to be able to control my feelings, make me calmer and have something to show for it."
selfharm,314hpd,GrishaJaegerisBenjen,2,Thu Apr 2 06:51:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like I deserve the pain. I know I'm such a piece of shit human being that I deserve every bit of pain I can feel. So I do it because I feel like that's what I deserve. Cutting, starving. There's so much self-loathing inside me that I feel like I need to punish myself for all the bad things I've done. And self-harming is a way for me to do that."
selfharm,314hpd,weedinafoxhole,2,Thu Apr 2 09:16:12 2015 UTC,"My reasons have changed around quite a bit, currently I do it for two reasons. It helps me deal with anxiety. Second I absolutely my body, it has everything wrong with it so I feel the need to punish it."
selfharm,314hpd,Till-The-End,2,Thu Apr 2 12:18:26 2015 UTC,They change with the times. It started with something to punish myself. Then it became something to get rid of the numb feelings. A way to feel like I was removing parts of me I didn't like.  Something to do to ward off suicidal thoughts. Something to deal with anxiety. Now is generally the first or last if I end up harming.
selfharm,314hpd,MicJaggs,2,Thu Apr 2 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"I used to cut because I hated myself. For me it was a means of self punishment.  I would get a lot of shame and guilt from everyday situations (that normal people would just laugh off) and not know how to deal with them.  I had a lot of anxiety especially dealing with other people (do they hate me, are they talking about me behind my back, is that group of strangers laughing at me etc.) so it helped me feel more relaxed when I did something that I deemed embarrassing, or bad.  it was my way of dealing with the guilt that would make me toss and turn every night."

I guess to cope, it helps me calm down when I'm feeling overwhelmed (which was pretty much always until recently). I also do it to feel in control, because when I do it, no one else can stop me and I guess feeling 'powerful' over myself is comforting. And I sort of see it as a minisuicide. I can't kill myself but at least I can hurt myself.   Also I kind of like how it looks."

selfharm,314hpd,HarveyOpossum,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:04:04 2015 UTC,When I was younger it was because my dad was abusive and I thought making mistakes meant I deserved to get hurt. As a teenager I realized how fucked up that was.   Now it's a way to ground myself and control my feelings. Sometimes I feel numb and empty and it makes me realize I'm still human and can feel things. Sometimes I feel all too much and it's a way to channel my upset and anger and sadness. I'm not good at expressing my emotions and this is easier.  Lately it's been one of the few things I can control. I'm about to graduate college and my life is a mess and I have no idea what I'm doing anymore. At least I can control this one thing.
selfharm,314hpd,pop484,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"I have a variety of reasons. Cutting for me started out as a way of externalising my pain, and cleansing myself from it. If I couldn't cope with how I felt inside, all the negative emotions building up, the self loathing and fear, hatred, guilt, stress, anxiety... But then I got addicted to the feelings of doing it, to seeing a web of scars on my thighs. Also, hiding the scars, dealing with the cuts and bleeding, stopping my tights sticking to scabs, that all distracted me from what was going on in my life.  A third reason is to punish myself if I feel guilty, ashamed, or whatever.  Mostly though it's for the externalisation and distraction. It takes focus and concentration, and every moment spent thinking about cutting is a moment less spent dwelling over the past and the future and loss and the pain."

I know there are a good most of the posts on there that are what I would (in my own fucked up mind) consider reasonable. Probably not necessarily healthy, but definitely will fade with time and, assuming the person quits, a decade or two from now won't be that noticeable.   But then I stumble on pictures of those horrific injuries, the giant blistering burns, and the down-to-the-muscle-and-bone cuts that are permanently disfiguring. I go there because the experience of seeing the totality of those images - at one moment so inconsequential and minor in the big picture, and then so permanent and disastrous the next - really helps to break me from my fixation. Not gonna lie, there have been several times that I have nearly lost my lunch in response to some of the images posted there."

selfharm,310t69,Blueberries_of_Wrath,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:28:49 2015 UTC,"What are the feelings you are trying to deal with, and how did self harming help?"
selfharm,310t69,SultanofShit,1 point,Wed Apr 1 07:06:19 2015 UTC,"I guess frustration over my current situation of being unemployed, and being demeaned and degraded by my parents who have given up on me getting a job and pretty much said so to my face... by telling me that they are selling the extra car I've been borrowing from them for running errands and going to interviews.  This was after I had injured my back earlier in the day hauling a safe up the steps for them and had an allergic reaction to a cleaner they insist that I use despite me telling them that I'm allergic to it.  So by the time they decided to get rid of the car, I had already just wanted the day to be over.  The shittiest part?  My fiance has me on his payroll and when we have enough money to send my way he helps with it, and I do technically work for his business (which he also lectured me on last nigh and said it was my business too).  And I love my job, my parents just don't see it as an actual job because all of it is done at home on the computer and there is little financial reward for his business.  Then on top of it all my fiance was angry with me last night because I was angry with him for blaming himself for the situation I'm in.  As if 33 years of my parents being who they are were his fault.  If I had a job I wouldn't be in this situation... I'd just be stuck with my mother stalking me at work and me being worried again about her costing me my job.   Usually the self harm would shock me out of feeling how I felt, this time I just didn't want to stop.  And in the past it would give me the chance to give myself aftercare as well, which didn't help.  Even the feeling of my jeans against it which usually was a little reminder of the secret only I had control over which would at least make me smile.  Now instead I'm sitting here wishing I had a job, a car, my own apartment, that I hadn't harmed, and also that I wouldn't have stopped."
selfharm,30yttb,lifeslittlelemons,5,Tue Mar 31 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"Im not on my throwaway and should probably switch, however I might do so later.   I know exactly how you feel. The first time my friend self harmed, he said one of the most thrilling feelings about it were the rush that he received. Granted he was in a shitty place at the time and used it to cope. The feeling of wanting to do it more is understandable and so are your feelings towards it.  You feel the rush right? The feeling of seeing how much damage you can cause or how deep you can go. My friend felt it too. We go all our lifes being told what to do and what not to do, hell you're always under someone else and to what extent do you truly have full control over anything? Almost none. The rush from cutting usually comes from a place of realising the power you have over your body. You are actively going against what you've been told all your life and have realised how much power you have over your own body. The sudden power and rebellion causes a morbid curiosity and in my friends case, gave him such adrenaline his hands would shake causing blood to go everywhere.   I get it. I guess thats what I've been trying to say. Its understandable and I do understand. However, its a destructive power, you're finding control and power over your own life where you may be lacking some through destructive means. Its almost as if you were a helpless Bruce Banner all your life and turned into the hulk destroying things with your new found power.   Though there are other ways to regain power ans control; there are some great ways of using power in a constructive way. For example, my friend works out. He uses control and power to push his body to his limits but instead of seeing destructive scars, he sees muscle that has grown bigger and stronger to adapt.  You can use the power you may have over someone elses life to influence events in their life, perhaps by giving them a compliment to raise their self esteem. It may not seem it but you are impacting their life.  This comment has gotten long now but what I wamt to get across is its natural to try and regain power, control in any way you can, however you find power and control through constructive means. This may not help you but I found it cathartic to write this, guess you've influenced my life too."

selfharm,30w27i,notathrowaway989,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:42:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm still never going to cut deep. I don't know how to take care of it, and I don't want to be taking care of it well after I've made the cut. Plus, I'm not actually too fond of pain, so I tend to go only as deep as I can without it hurting, which isn't very deep at all. :/"

selfharm,30wdlh,glagola,6,Tue Mar 31 06:18:21 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain you can't get withdrawal because you're not physically addicted. You're probably just sick. Sorry. (I could be completely wrong though, I'm just guessing)."
selfharm,30wdlh,Urban_II,5,Tue Mar 31 07:32:43 2015 UTC,"Selfharm can be physically addicting in the sense that the pain works on the opiod receptors in the brain much in the same way opiates (heroin, oxy, etc) do. For those who harm regularly, they can crave the release of endorphins even when no other psychological or emotional trigger happens. Even at 7 weeks clean, that desire can still exist but would be gradually becoming less frequent much in the same way a drug addict might miss the high.  Glagola, I haven't ever heard of a sudden consistent nausea like that being a side-effect of the previous selfharm and must have another main contributing factor. It's possible that the urges which are normal in someone trying to stop selfharm are triggering a change in brain chemistry and something else is causing that surge of emotion to become nausea. Are you on medication to help you stay clean or any other psychiatric medication? If you are, that could very well be the source and if you aren't, the comparisons with non-opioid drugs are kind of meaningless conjecture. If you are, talk to your psychiatrist right away and if you aren't, talk to your general doctor because it's likely that you are sick somehow and the urges are aggravating that.  Withdrawal in itself does vary from person to person just as the initial urges to harm do but there are many consistent and common similarities. Seven weeks is fantastic and the longer you fight it off, the more experienced you become in dealing with the emotional triggers and urges in a positive manner. As for resources, the sidebar wiki has the best list I know of and if you ever want to talk about the efficacy of methods or just general stuff, feel free to PM me. I'm about 8 months clean and am still dealing with the urges all the time. I know it's cliche but it really does get easier to resist through practice.   Edit: Forgot anxiety, like /u/AdloraOfSolitude said. Really the simplest explanation but I'd still talk to either your psychiatrist or doctor about it."
selfharm,30wdlh,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Tue Mar 31 09:26:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the reply! I'm currently not on any meds, but I might be in the near future: it's certainly not out of the question. I'll definitely talk to my therapist about stuff, and hopefully I'll have a psychiatrist soon enough. No general doctor right now, since I'm a college student who can't adult very well, and I'm super leery about going to the campus clinic because my school's policies still think self harm is suicide for incompetent people, which will get me kicked out :( . I can probably get a referral to one if it doesn't go away in another week or so, though...  Congrats on the 8 months, that's amazing!"
selfharm,30wdlh,AdloraOfSolitude,6,Wed Apr 1 00:10:29 2015 UTC,It is entirely possible to be nauseated and on edge from not SH'ing. It's called anxiety. Happens to me all the time. I find that curling up somewhere safe and distracting myself will make it go away eventually.
