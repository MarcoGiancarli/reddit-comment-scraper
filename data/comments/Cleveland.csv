Cleveland,3e35xb,Aedalas,5,Tue Jul 21 17:46:21 2015 UTC,Because he was making some kind of analogy about how the cops are the children of Frank Jackson and they're in bed together. A very poor analogy that makes his store look like the NAMBLA headquarters.
Cleveland,3e35xb,TheNavidsonLP,4,Tue Jul 21 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"No no, you're thinking of the other NAMBLA. His is the headquarters for the local chapter of the National Association of Marlon Brando Look-Alikes."

Cleveland,3e35xb,menschmaschine5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"No clue. Never stopped there either but I drive by it on my way to work every morning. A few years ago there was a murder there and there have been several shootings in the parking lot. The owner is a very outspoken Muslim that constantly paints anti-American and anti-semantic murals on the wall (such as Obama being hanged by Benjamin Netanyahu and various other offensive things that can be seen on his Facebook page), but I know it wasn't him that was arrested because he's been updating his Facebook about the raid.

Cleveland,3e3cbp,cjrobe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:48 2015 UTC,True about the airport but book online; huge price difference when you book online vs on the spot.

I've reserved on my phone on their co. website and I paid $40 while in line talking to person trying to rip me off... gave them reservation # and drove away...

Also rented from a couple of local small town local car dealers, they'd rent used cars off lot or service loaners at very reasonable rates, very negotiable, with no big name franchise involved."
Cleveland,3e3cbp,ispland,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:45 2015 UTC,"It all depends on season and supply and demand. I frequently find what I consider good deals at the airport with National using their ""last minute specials"" plus a $20 off weekend or week rental coupon code.  I have found good with Hertz when combined with promo codes at their downtown and Lakewood locations, but have also run into issues with vehicle availability where it took 45 minutes to get the car or where they just didn't have any cars despite accepting the reservation.  As an aside, if you rent often with Enterprise with low rates, make sure you're crediting your rentals to National. You get the same credit for a cheap rental as an expensive one and the free days can be redeemed for (expensive) one-way rentals."

Cleveland,3dyg9r,Dwi11,3,Mon Jul 20 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks alot man, so I should probably talk to them after my doctors visit then? I know there's a tissue injury but I didn't want to get involved with someone that would tell me to wear a neck brace for months. I'm hurt but not on my deathbed. Do the insurance companies usually cover the damage to the vehicle and lost wages as well? I have another car that's not reliable at this point and I use my truck to carry equipment to contract jobs but I can't conduct business without a truck."
Cleveland,3dyg9r,SOGorman35,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"this is good advice.  Keep in mind too that an attorney is going to get up to 33% (if it were to go to suit, which is rare) of your settlement, so a $2,000 settlement with an attorney is about equal to getting $1500 on your own.  Also, call the adjuster back.  If you're not at fault, delaying hearing from them is just going to keep you from getting paid for your car and getting a rental (if you need it).  Injury claims and property damage claims are two different animals, you can settle the property damage claim in a matter of hours/days without having to settle the injury claim until you are either ready to, or reach an agreement with the adjuster.  If you don't get the offer you want, but you feel you might be in the ballpark, it couldn't hurt to just sit on it for a bit and see if the adjuster comes around.  It's always a big deal for adjusters to minimize their backlog of claims, and if a month or three passes and it's still sitting there, they may up the offer.  Disclosure: I'm an adjuster who only handles property damage, but I've had authority to settle injury claims like the ones you are describing."
Cleveland,3dyg9r,techtoy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not an attorney, so I would focus on what /u/whodeeya posted above.  I've been rear ended something like 10 times now, been sideswiped once and t-boned once so hard my car spun 360 degrees in the air.  I've gone to the hospital to get checked out once, urgent care for another instance later because of neck/back pain.  When asked if I'm ok, the answer has always been ""I'm not sure, my back and neck hurt"".  Nothing more or less. Each time I've been hit that resulted in insurance claims, I play wait-and-see and don't pursue anything.  After a few months, the insurance company offers me some money to sign a release of liability to prevent me from suing them later.  The worst accident they started out with a $300 offer and ended up raising it to $1500 or $1800 (this was 15+ years ago too).  More recently for a minor rear-ending, I think it was $600 or so. In those situations, you really need to be wise.  If you are suffering any sort of aches and pains or have been seeing your doctor consistently, it seems foolish to sign anything.  If you have been feeling great since the initial stiffness from the accident cleared up, I think it makes sense to take the cash."

Todd Schneider, a spokesman for FirstEnergy Corp., says  Muhammad Abdulazeez was conditionally hired as an engineer at a nuclear plant about 35 miles northeast of Cleveland. He spent 10 days there before he was let go because he failed a background check.  He would not say why Abdulazeez didn't pass the screening process. Abdulazeez underwent general training on company procedures, but his access was limited during his brief employment.  Schneider says he worked in an administrative building and was never allowed in the protected area of the plant near the reactor.  He says employees recognized a photo of Abdulazeez after the shooting and alerted company officials."

The official had the information after being briefed on the matter, but couldn't speak publicly because of the ongoing law enforcement investigation of Muhammad Abdulazeez.  Earlier Friday, a spokesman for the plant said Abdulazeez had failed a ""background check,"" but would not elaborate on why he hadn't passed the screening process.

There are several detectors (metal & radioactive) at the entrance along with armed security.  Nuke plants have heavily armed security throughout the plant (semi-automatic rifles along w/ sidearm backup). The security trains specifically for terrorist threats.   Different areas within the plant have restricted badge access, esp for the areas w/ nuclear material.  Worst case, he causes a plant shutdown and costs First Energy millions of dollars in revenue.

Cleveland,3do4zk,AtTheLeftThere,2,Sat Jul 18 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"As far as anything nuclear goes, damn near impossible.  No, he's not the only one out there, but I'm telling you that there are a lot of safety and security protocols in the nuke facility world. They take that stuff VERY seriously. That is why the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) goes deep into the asses of these plants.  The government does not mess around when it comes to facilities w/ highly radioactive material.    There is automated equipment that will shut the plant down and flood the reactor if certain alarms are tripped. You can't just go and sneak away with nuclear material either. Besides the fact that you can quickly get extremely sick and possibly die, there are detectors throughout the plant that lets everyone know if the material has not been contained.  Like I said, at the entrance into the plant, there are heavily armed guards where you pass through the metal detector, and beyond that area.  I don't know if they have them anymore in the post-9/11 era, but you could take tours of the unrestricted areas of the plant and see (in a limited fashion) the security and safety measures for yourself.  They train for this stuff and have military professionals that help them train.    The nuclear reactor building is supposed to withstand the impact of a 747 (was tested). I am skeptical of this, but there are no-fly zones in the area of nuke plants.  If something as big as a 747 is headed towards a nuke plant, military jets will scramble.  You are given a drug test, a thorough background check, and a multi-hour psych test before you can gain security clearance to even get into the restricted areas of the plant, which include the control room and radioactive restricted areas."

All I'm saying is, there is ALWAYS a possibility of it happening precautions or not.  I am in no way a conspiracy nut either I assure you. I believe the twin towers were taken down by Al-Qaeda, I believe we landed on the moon, I don't think jet streams are chemicals being sprayed. But when something happens in our country like happened in Chatanooga and has happened elsewhere in America already, we better prepare ourselves for what is coming. I can only hope we are prepared enough."

They could cause a panic and get on the national news I guess and get some publicity. Security is located all throughout the plant, out in the open and in secured rooms with highly restricted access. There were rumors about other things at their disposal.  It's not as easy as movies make it to be.  Even if they took over the plant, the military would move in quickly."

You're more likely to find manual transmission rentals at a small independent place, rather than one of the big rental chains. The manuals tend to be very, very cheap rentals as nobody wants them.   It's really rather easy to do, you could easily become competent enough to drive with a few hours of practice. The key is to not be shy with the accelerator, you need to hit the gas as you release the clutch or you'll stall out.  I love manual transmissions, it's something I really miss ever since switching to an electric car. For months, my left foot kept reaching for the clutch!"

It's very different in Europe, they have fleets of stick shift cars and it's difficult and really expensive to find an automatic.    ...but I'm more reluctant now that I own a 2014 model year car. It was easier to justify when I had a piece of crap.   Yeah, I feel you.

Lots of late night driving around the block.  You stall out at first, but you then know the friction point of the clutch and where to let the clutch out at.  I even taught my ex-gf how to drive a manual when she bought a Mini Cooper.  I had to drive the car for the first week, but she eventually learned.  You could also try riding a motorcycle.  It has the same concept of clutch/gas/brake.  It gives you an understanding of how it should function, but you use different hands/legs for shifting and clutch.  You could also buy a cheap beater with a stick shift and learn on that.  Once your done sell it for what you paid.  That is if you have some cash/time to spare."

Cleveland,3dj48t,veggie151,8,Thu Jul 16 18:24:03 2015 UTC,He's not going to kill the clutch unless he's retarded or the clutch was already near death. They're made for the average driver (idiots).
Cleveland,3dj48t,unigami,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:39 2015 UTC,"He won't kill it, but it's not great on the transmission so I'd be hesitant to let some learn on my car for shit's and giggles. Better to teach them on their new manual."

I think the resale value of manual trans cars is less Can be tricky for a newbie when you are stopped at a light on a steep hill and the car behind you is about 1 ft from the back of your car   Benefits:   Better Gas mileage and performance YOU decide when to shift More fun, especially with a sporty car"

If we're already not comparing apples to apples, do we get to fully optimize both and see which does better?   Come on, I already said you've gotta be comparing the same thing. If the statement wasn't enough for you:  If you have two cars that are fully identical except for the method of shifting gears on the transmission. . ."

There's your apples to apples.    No idea what you're talking about, adding shit to one and not the other.. we're comparing a manual and everything that makes it a manual to an automatic and everything that makes it an automatic.  i don't have time to break it down any further for you..."

Cleveland,3dj48t,tenacioustortoise,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Manuals could probably do better if as much fuel efficiency research was put into them as is put into automatics.

I did this with my second car it and it was the best decision i ever made. it will force you to learn and learning is pretty easy. The first day i had it i sat in my slanted driveway for 20 minutes and just rolled back and forth letting the clutch in and out. once you find the sweet spot of the clutch the rest will come with just practice. Go for it! manual is way safer/fun to drive. You are completely in tune with your car (pun?)"
Cleveland,3dj48t,veggie151,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"That sounds a bit quick, but this is the best way to learn. I bought my car and was driving in a pretty stall proof manner by the end of the first day. Time is the best teacher."

Launch at Shelby Street launch in Sandusky and cruise the waterfront by the city.  Take in some nice views of Cedar Point.  You can cross the bay and hang out on the sand bar by Bay Point.  nice beach and swimming.  You can also go into the quarry on Johnson's Island and check out some nice homes.  Head under the Johnsons Island Causeway and cruise the North shore all the way to the Bay Bridge.    If you go under the Bay Bridge, there is a really cool bar on the water called Two Cans.  It's on the South shore of the Bay, about half way between the bridge and the river.  If you have more time, head up the river.  It's navigable all the way to Fremont.  There's a good place up there to get a burger called the Tacklebox.  With only a 15hp, you might not be able to make it that far.  Lots of people go via Jet Ski.  If you don't want to go all the way to Sandusky, you can check out the Rocky River, Lorain River, Huron River, and Vermilion River.  I think Vermilion is the nicest.  Go up and down the canals in the Lagoons.  You can go up the river really far.  Huron River is really nice and natural once you get South of Route 2.  Very quiet and scenic.

I'm kind of jealous of the people that aren't stuck in their booth :)  We will have a laser cutter and SLA 3d printer on display as well as quite a bit of art pieces that use the technology at some capacity. Rust Inc will be show off their metal art, or as they call it ""functional metal fabrication art""."

Cleveland,3dehit,jvslater,5,Thu Jul 16 03:34:57 2015 UTC,I recently got a car loan through the Fire Fighters Credit Union with a low interest rate. I decided to handle my banking with them as well. They have a few branches all around NEO and I think you can use a network of ATM's throughout the city without a service charge. I can definitely recommend them for your banking needs.

Cleveland,3dehit,work_account_duh,3,Thu Jul 16 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live and work, Cardinal Community Credit Union may not be super convenient, but they are really nice, have a really good high interest checking account and the best loan rates around (My wife and I used them to buy a used car last weekend and got a 1.99 rate, 1.75 if I do auto pay). I live in Cleveland, but I work in Lake County so they're convenient for me.  I imagine Firefighters is as pleasant to use as Cardinal and from what I can tell their interest checking is a better deal. Still, if you plan to get a loan any time soon, I'd recommend checking out Cardinal."

Cleveland,3desmu,tim222tim,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:45:51 2015 UTC,Avoid Ohio state. Warranty repair claims take 2 months at least
Cleveland,3desmu,Frahoobala,3,Wed Jul 15 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"This only is an aspect of what I would consider to be the larger problem.  First, Ohio State and a lot of similar companies dig a trench around the house (often claim to dig down to the frostline, but may not) and install a French drain rather than digging down to the footer, repairing and/or replacing the foundation drain and installing a water barrier on the outside of the block which is the correct way to fix the problem.  Second, they sell you on a waterproof basement.  But is it?  Often it's not and you have to call them on the warranty to do the rework.  So they'll come out and fix it if it leaks which it very well may - but if you want to finish the basement or otherwise use it with confidence that it's not going to get wet, that's kind of a dicey proposition.  What they sell you is a dry basement, but it really isn't exactly that.  Its a guarantee that they'll come out and remediate the work if there's a problem.    So sue them!  Can't.  Arbitration clause.  Why do they exist?  Because they're a lot cheaper than fixing the problem correctly.  And homeowners isn't going to cover it.  Its a maintenance issue.  If you do use one of these guys, know that they sell like used car salesman.  They will happily charge you the price a general contractor would to fix it right.  Then they will cut the price by half to a third (or more?)."
Cleveland,3desmu,discontinuity,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"I recently asked an architect friend about the basement waterproofing business around here,  I thought the TV commercials seemed ""scammy"" somehow.  He said that the TV services were probably scams because the waterproofing needs to include digging a trench around the foundation, and that these companies just put the sealant inside.  This means that moisture can still get in, it will now just damage the foundation walls from the outside in.  He said the number one reason for basement moisture was gutters and spillways not being clear, and that these companies will try to sell you their ineffective solutions.  He said foundation cracks are relatively rare and very expensive to repair correctly."

Cleveland,3dc0tx,thearn4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"Didn't see one listed on their website. They do have a laser cutter/engraver, 3D printers, and a vinyl cutter.  http://cpl.org/thelibrary/subjectscollections/techcentral/makerspace-2/  What material are you working with? There's also this wood shop that I know of. http://soulcraftwoodshop.com/woodshop/  I've been looking around for these kind of places in the area recently since I'm working on a project and we'll need to use similar equipment to build our setups.  Maker's alliance (linked above) lists two lathes on their website. I'm going to check them out on Tuesday night to see what equipment of theirs is actually usable, since it's hard to tell from their site which equipment works and is available. They have walk-in hours listed on their site."
Cleveland,3dbyhp,kilbane27,6,Wed Jul 15 02:08:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the company itself, but it raises a number a huge red flags that you're already seeing based on your inquiry.  When I was just out of college and running into companies like this, I had to ask myself a few basic questions:     Is the company website more geared to acquiring employees than clients? What, exactly, does this company sell?   I felt like I had a third one back in the day but it really doesn't matter, from as far as I can tell, if you scroll to the bottom of any page it asks about hiring, and the main contact on the contact page is HR, not sales.  This means that they are way more focused on employees than clients.  Further, they don't say anywhere what they sell.  Here's the truth of the matter, since I've been around their block before.  What this company likely does is sell office equipment or something door-to-door, and what they'll ask you to do is go to local companies or homes and try to sell these things door-to-door.  So if it is office supplies (through Staples, btw) you'll be soliciting on office companies and going basically desk-to-desk.  For the few and far between who are successful, eventually, up the pyramid scheme chain, will open your own branch, with whatever made up name, and do this same thing, where your website will be more focused on employees than customers and not ever say what it is you actually do other than ""b2b relations, communications, marketing"" buzzwords that aren't actually saying anything at all.  Refer to my 2 above questions as a fresh out of college grad, save yourself a headache.  This place is basically a scam."
Cleveland,3dbyhp,completED711,3,Wed Jul 15 04:02:01 2015 UTC,Looks like a scam company to me. Hope your GF is good with door-to-door and cold sales.

Cleveland,3dbyhp,danlyft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"This is basically what I thought. I was explaining this to her last night. Once I saw that they couldn't say what they were selling due to ""privacy of the companies they work for"" I knew it was a scam."
Cleveland,3dbyhp,ngfalcon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"I've also been contacted by this company for an interview, and it seems shady to me too. They told me I'd be hired on the ""management track,"" which includes a variety of job duties like HR, marketing, sales, etc. They wouldn't answer my question when I asked if everyone is brought in on the ""management track."" To me, it seems they have to train everyone as ""managers"" because of high turnover — no one sticks around long enough to properly ascend to management level."

Cleveland,3d9f48,rodion_kjd,2,Tue Jul 14 15:30:59 2015 UTC,We are going to be staying at the Radisson
Cleveland,3d9f48,rodion_kjd,25,Tue Jul 14 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"Oooo, okay.  Well an easy stop will be e.4th street.  You can walk there in 30 seconds from your hotel.  If you go all the way to the north end of the street you'll find green house tavern on your left.  Go inside and go all the way up to the roof if it is a nice night.  You'll find craft beer and craft cocktails and a rooftop patio with a nice view.    EDIT: If it is a shitty night still go here but drink at the bar inside the front door.  Dave is the bartender.  Best mixologist in the city.  One of the best I've ever met anywhere, actually.  If you're more into swilling cheap booze with a local crowd grab some cash from an ATM (cash only) and head west on Prospect until you hit Ontario (1/4 mile, maybe less) turn right on Ontario and look for a green, shitty sign that says ""ontario street cafe"" (ignore the tilted kilt, or don't, boobs are cool).  Head into the Ontario and step back in time.  Polished wood bar, bar keeps in bow ties, and all the Genessee you can drink.  A 22oz beer and a shot of whiskey (together, for both) is $3 all day every day.  There isn't a cocktail in the house that costs more than $5.  Just remember, cash only.  Once you're good and fucked up cross the street and head into the Horseshoe Casino.  Even if you don't gamble it is worth looking around because it is opulent in the best sense of the word.  Also, any of the bars inside the casino are great people watching and Great Lakes beers are only $3 if you need to rehydrate.  If you're ready for a real adventure and you have your wits about you head into the big Terminal Tower building that the casino is attached to and follow the signs for ""trains.""  Hop on a west bound Red Line - one stop - to the w.25th stop.  Head upstairs and you'll see a big building on your right.  This is the world famous West Side Market where some of the best sausage, meat, and produce in the region can be found. Doesn't matter though cause its 11pm and its closed.  Now, at this point in time most people are going to tell you to walk towards the lights and hit up w.25th and sure, you can do that.  Hit Crop if you're feeling fancy, ABC if you're feeling not fancy, and Nano Brew if you like super weird craft beer.  Or, don't do that at all.  Instead of going into the light head away from the light.  Go southest down Abbey Ave (this can be a little sketch, not bad, but keep your head up), turn right on w.21st, and then right on Freeman.  Hello buddy you're at the goddamn Duck Island Club.    There should be somebody spinning some records to an otherwise totally empty bar.  Or it will be packed full and pouring over into the street, you never know.  Regardless booze is cheap, people are friends, and music is loud.  You'll probably want to take an Uber home from here if you close the bar cause the area around it gets sketchier and sketchier.  Also the train stops running so you'll have to walk across the Carnaegie bridge to get home which, come to think of it, would be really pretty.  But probably not safe.  But oh well, your call."

I would say that $100 a night is about normal for a decent hotel, beyond that and I try to be flexible or look into AirBnb or other options. I have stayed at hotels in the city for less than $100 a night, but there were multiple properties with similar rates. Also, I recommend looking into accumulating hotel points if you stay in hotels for more than a couple nights a year.  Edited to add: I checked the week of Augus 9 to 13 and the La Quinta by the Puritas rapid station is $82, the Holiday Inn right by it is $103.  Probably not your dates but you can see that all the hotels in that area aren't always $150 a night.  Maybe also try Priceline."

Cleveland,3dd7j1,seniorheff,2,Wed Jul 15 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I have never heard that before. The Bureau of Labor Statistics lists several other sectors as having more employees than ""leisure and hospitality"" for the five county region: http://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/summary/blssummary_cleveland_oh.pdf  Although the BLS doesn't specifically break Cleveland out, I suspect that if tourism were the top industry in Cleveland itself that it would at least be mentioned along with the other industries on the Department of Economic Development's website: http://www.rethinkcleveland.org/Key-Industries.aspx"

Cleveland,3d5mu3,moodyfloyd,2,Tue Jul 14 12:17:05 2015 UTC,Yes
Cleveland,3d5mu3,Failedjedi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:39:01 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part, but let me ask you this. Would you have a problem if that restaurant put a security camera in the bathroom? I'm guessing most people would be against that. Would you be against an individual citizen walking in with a camera and recording video? I'm guessing most would be against that too. And granted it was just for a brief second in this case, but are you suddenly not against filming because it was a police body cam?   I personally 100% think there is no issue with 4 seconds of recording in the bathroom in this case, but there is a valid argument to made about not recording in a bathroom.   What if you were disabled and going was this whole big embarrassing production, and they caught that in the 5 seconds in the bathroom. I'm guessing that person wouldn't want that footage on youtube with over 2 million views."

Cleveland,3d5mu3,Jarredthebluetiger,14,Mon Jul 13 19:41:32 2015 UTC,Honest question why is that? Just trying to hear the other side. Also no one down vote them for generating discussion.
Cleveland,3d5mu3,terrick,6,Mon Jul 13 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"While I am certainly for body cams, I think there are a few concerns that need to be addressed.   For example, how do you deal with public records requests that could violate the rights of victims and/or minors?  Will have police have the opportunity to turn off the camera for any reason (i.e. when dealing with a victim of sexual assault). Will there be software that de-identifies faces in certain situations and how good is it? Can I judge or arbiter have the ability to conceal certain information from the public (etc).  Some of these things need to be hashed out for these cams to be used effectively without violating rights."
Cleveland,3d5mu3,darthdeighan,6,Mon Jul 13 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"I think they're a good idea, but I think it'll effect the way they police negatively too. For instance, If you jaywalk in front of a cop right now they either say nothing or they'll just yell at you. Now they'll be asked why they let you break the law. So then they will start to police people jaywalking, and now they are being force to waste their time instead of doing real police work.   Now on a more practical level, Cop shows up at a domestic disturbance call, and a Husband and wife are arguing. As you enter the house you see the man push the woman out of his way. (maybe to leave the house or go into another room not hurt her) Currently the cops would just make sure the two remained separated but now if they have cameras the man has to be arrested. The law in Cleveland says that when a primary aggressor is established they have to be arrested. So a scenario is possible where these cameras hurt the police trying to do their job"
Cleveland,3d5mu3,Jarredthebluetiger,15,Mon Jul 13 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"I believe that the way they work is that the camera will be reviewed for a reason. It won't be ""Let's watch your shift and make sure you ticketed everyone you could have""   Your more practical explanation with the domestic violence call could make sense. And I guess we will have to face laws with more grey area now. Before they were black and white with the judgment falling on the officer.   Now it may be less up to the officer and up to some form of committee. I'm not exactly sure how they will go about that. But if that means that people get arrested who are breaking the law and then it gets decided on later... Well I have a hard time saying that's okay or not okay but I think it will be a step in a positive direction and these issues will have to be dealt with later."
Cleveland,3d5mu3,whitefang22,5,Mon Jul 13 21:13:36 2015 UTC,"I think it would be ideal if the officers and police departments didn't have direct access to the tapes  They could request them from a third party for legitimate reasons.  Evidence for trial, review a specific incident, training examples,etc  Nobody wants their bosses hovering over them questioning their every decision all the time.  But if a 3rd party has access we could have the benefits without risking drawbacks"

Cleveland,3d5mu3,Jarredthebluetiger,5,Tue Jul 14 01:05:58 2015 UTC,I'm sorry I'm missing what you were commenting on specifically! A defense lawyer will what?
Cleveland,3d5mu3,rootwyrm,9,Tue Jul 14 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"This is NOT going to happen. Know why? Because it's completely flipping insane. No, seriously. It's insane.   CPD has 1,709 employees of which 1,550 are officers. Each officer works an 8 to 12 hour shift typically 5 days a week. (5 on, 2 off.)  Therefore, each shift is probably around 510 officers average. (Average!!) Even fast forwarding, the fastest a person could possibly review a shift is about 6 hours. To review camera footage in this fashion would require CPD hire about 1,500 new employees to do nothing but watch footage 8-10 hours per day, 7 days a week.   This is why body cameras are selectively reviewed, or you get loons like Seattle where they're going ""well we'll just let the 'community' review it all!"" The legality of which is already being questioned and will probably cost them more than all the body cameras to litigate."
Cleveland,3d5mu3,the-breeze,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"If we don't like a law we should get rid of the law, not give the police leeway to selectively enforce it.   If it doesn't make sense for the guy to be arrested why not ditch that law in the first place? Though I'm not quite sure why having this guy be allowed to push his girlfriend is a positive in the first place..."
Cleveland,3d5mu3,Failedjedi,2,Mon Jul 13 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'm all for more information they provide. Less he said she said. But, Cleveland already can't fix roads, is cutting costs elsewhere, and now there is the burden of the cost of the camera and storage.   Another thing is privacy concerns. What if I don't want to be recorded? If I am on my private property and ask a  officer to turn it off, will he? Can he? Does he have to?   What if I'm arrested dancing naked drunk in a street. Is that  video available under freedom of information for anyone to request and put on YouTube?   I lean towards supporting them, there are just concerns I still have."
Cleveland,3d5mu3,whitefang22,3,Mon Jul 13 21:35:54 2015 UTC,"Well first, I'd hope they wouldn't be able to turn them.  If you're in public anyone has the right to record you.  If an officer has no legal reason to enter your property and you ask them to leave, they have to leave.  If they do  have a legal reason to be there, then it's probably best they are recording anyway.  Now the FOIA stuff, idk, gets a little tricky"
Cleveland,3d5mu3,Failedjedi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"If they do have a legal reason to be there, then it's probably best they are recording anyway.   What's best for anyone doesn't matter. If they are on my property and I ask them not to record, what happens? Do they leave, turn it off, can they turn it off?   What about victims of sexual assault right after it happened. We aren't talking days later in an interview room, we are talking minutes after it happened. Is that something you think that person wants on video for potentially the whole world to see?   If the officer can't manually turn it off for a brief period of time, that will lead to them physically removing it from their body, which is worse in my opinion.   What about going to the bathroom? They stop at a Burger King for lunch and one officer has to go to the bathroom, is he supposed to record his whole trip into the public bathroom? Do you want to be recorded in a public bathroom?   Say something happened in front of your house, but you weren't involved. An accident or something. Officer comes up to your door and knocks. You have drugs sitting on a table within view of the door. The officer doesn't notice. A week later when reviewing tapes, he notices, and they come back and arrest you. Completely legal to do so, but you wouldn't be 100% pro camera then would you.  All I'm saying is there is valid concerns, and you don't have to be 100% for or against. You can fall somewhere on the scale. I'm just saying right now I'm about 51-60% in favor of them. I think the advantage out ways some of my concerns to a degree.   But I'd still like more information on how exactly they will work and have a policy in place. I think it's wrong to rush into cameras and come up with a use policy as you go. I think the policy should be in place and questions answered first.   And while I don't have a problem being recorded in my home if I'm just giving a quick statement about something, I 100% realize that others will.   My last and final concern is if it changes officers decisions to arrest/ticket someone. I've seen a few bar fights get broken up by cops where both parties were sober enough to realize what was going on, break it up when the cops arrived and not press charges against each other. For a felony assault you don't need the victim to press charges, cops could have nabbed both parties for a felony arrest, but didn't because the situation was over. Now with cameras do they feel compelled to arrest or justify why they didn't? Obviously a bar fight is one end of the example that you would think should lead to an arrest, but as you go down the scale of severity the opinions start to split. What about setting off fireworks on the 4th? If what you have is illegal and there is 100% definitive proof you should be arrested right? What about jay walking downtown? It's on video you should be ticketed right. If it's on video from an officers body cam it means he should have seen it and enforced the law right? Otherwise it's ""why weren't you doing your job?""."
Cleveland,3d5mu3,whitefang22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"Those are all valid concerns.  The problem is if you allow them to turn off or take off the camera when they want to it defeats the point.  I'd like to see a system where the recordings are in a 3rd party's hands, where they would not be subject to either random FOIA Inquiries or unneeded Police department Surveillance reviewing (or officer babysitting via camera).  The footage would only be released into public record for real reasons: evidence for a trial, review a a complaint, challenge the continents of an officers report, or other real reason to review a specific incident.  Get all the advantages of body cams but avoid those kinds of issues"

Cleveland,3d4yyu,tenacioustortoise,0,Mon Jul 13 16:44:13 2015 UTC,Do you remember where you stayed? I've heard good things about Hocking Hills.
Cleveland,3d4yyu,tenacioustortoise,2,Mon Jul 13 17:07:42 2015 UTC,Riverside Campground at Hocking Hills Adventures. It was a really good campsite right on the river. We had a 5 minute drive to get to the canoe launch though. I definitely recommend Hocking Hills. There are also a bunch of hikes and really cool caves you can go explore. Ash Cave and Old Mans Cave are two really good ones.

Cleveland,3d53bk,Backstop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"I went to one at the I-X a couple of years ago. My overall sense it that they are best for entry-level work, like if you can imagine that you'd be going through training with four other new hires, a career fair is for that type of thing. For example, call center agents, or salespeople. If you've been a plant manager for five years and are looking to transition to another company then not so much.   The main thing is you're handing your resume to someone that will actually assess you and put you in the Yes or No pile for a callback, instead of being Resume #691 barfed into an inbox from their online application form. Dress nice, speak nice, take business cards, act interested."

Also, this week is the lead up to the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix.  If you're looking for a car show, or a reason to visit Pittsburgh, I'd highly recommend it.  The Pittsburgh C&C meet there during the events, so you don't even have to choose both."

Cleveland,3d4p0c,adub232,3,Mon Jul 13 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"What you're asking for is to basically rent a house for a couple months right? Why not get in contact with a real estate agent? Most agents are cooperative enough that if your request is too complex they can refer you to an agent that is more knowledgable.   Another option is to contact the concierge at the Cleveland Clinic main campus. There are tons of stories of Middle Eastern royal families coming to town while they or a relative receive medical treatment. Rumor is they move the entire family to Cleveland, frequently renting out entire homes in Bratenahl.  One story is a prince rented a house for a year. Paid to have the home renovated to his specification, paid an additional sum for the home owner to re-renovate the home back to their liking, on top of the rent paid.   I know your budget doesn't compare to a Saudi prince, but that's an example of rental property in Cleveland."
