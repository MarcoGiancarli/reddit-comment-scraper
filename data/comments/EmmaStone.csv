EmmaStone,3dyazp,AaKkisa,5,Mon Jul 20 15:03:37 2015 UTC,Shes one of the few women in the world that can have any color of hair and look STUNNING. Brown in zombieland and blonde in spiderman. Red in easy A etc   Shes so flawless
EmmaStone,3drzff,PokemonTrainerYellow,-3,Sat Jul 18 22:00:33 2015 UTC,Fucking dumb ass title.
EmmaStone,3dp31f,McFappity,29,Sat Jul 18 02:25:44 2015 UTC,"""funny expresion""? more like ""get out of my face with that camera dude"" expression.  She looks adorable though, I accept this man's sacrifice to be hated by the goddess."
EmmaStone,3dp31f,ukjohndoe,6,Sat Jul 18 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"That's a straight up, ""what the fuck, man?"" Look. Or ""seriously?"""
EmmaStone,3dp31f,__KODY__,0,Sat Jul 18 16:56:42 2015 UTC,I know she's a natural blond but I prefer her as a brunette.
EmmaStone,3dp31f,TommBomBadil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:45:51 2015 UTC,Odd thing to tell you about your mom.
EmmaStone,3dpwpm,dzineflip,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:12:19 2015 UTC,She's realized whitewashing is bad after she cashed her check.   More interestingly though:   Stone discussed the inclination for Hollywood to give young ladies a role as the romantic interestes for much more established men.   That's a good point. I wonder if she'll ever get her own movie instead of just being the main characters arm candy?
EmmaStone,3dpwpm,should_not_ever,10,Sat Jul 18 14:49:52 2015 UTC,She's had a couple of those.   The Help and Easy A at least.
EmmaStone,3dpwpm,namesOnkeL,4,Sat Jul 18 15:57:36 2015 UTC,The person her character was based on though apparently didn't look Asian at all even though she was a quarter Asian and that is why the chose her.

EmmaStone,3dq4v5,KILLPREE,2,Sat Jul 18 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"haha, sorry.. not intended :/"
EmmaStone,3diqbl,totes-muh-gotes,4,Thu Jul 16 16:26:00 2015 UTC,That changes colors!
EmmaStone,3diri6,totes-muh-gotes,8,Thu Jul 16 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but you mean to tell me someone said she did not look attractive in that gold tassel dress? Almost makes me want to grab my pitchfork."
EmmaStone,3diri6,AaKkisa,11,Thu Jul 16 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"Okay well, while I agree with the sentiment... The guy who doesn't find Emma attractive isn't likely to be subbed to /r/EmmaStone... So he probably won't see this..."
EmmaStone,3diri6,nubsauce87,9,Thu Jul 16 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"I don't expect him to, just a title for the pic."
EmmaStone,3diri6,nubsauce87,4,Thu Jul 16 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, fair enough."
EmmaStone,3diri6,SaintPhoeniix,7,Thu Jul 16 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"""Fuck you for having an opinion that's different to mine."""
EmmaStone,3diri6,CartoonBumRush,2,Thu Jul 16 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"which pic did he/she dislike, out of curiosity?"
EmmaStone,3de6s8,AaKkisa,11,Wed Jul 15 16:00:03 2015 UTC,these dresses that look like they're see through but actually are not always put me on a roller coaster of emotions.
EmmaStone,3dfbez,PokemonTrainerYellow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:42:26 2015 UTC,I don't care for Taylor swift. I don't think she's hot
EmmaStone,3dc9n0,purosossego,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:20 2015 UTC,Yet she doesn't have one (at least publicly)
EmmaStone,3dc9n0,KILLPREE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:53:00 2015 UTC,"For a long time, she had a verified account that had absolutely no tweets but tons of followers."

EmmaStone,3dc9n0,KILLPREE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:49:58 2015 UTC,Source? All I know was that it was verified but didn't have any tweets when I checked.
EmmaStone,3dc9n0,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:58:52 2015 UTC,I was a follower and witnessed it myself. She also mentioned in a video (around last January?) that she used to have a twitter until it was hacked.
