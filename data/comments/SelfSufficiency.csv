I just envision the sand washing away, even if slowly, from under the blocks and necessitating a draining/releveling of the tank.

SelfSufficiency,3dxxy3,velacreations,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"You could be right. There is only about an inch of sand below the blocks. Once the clay soil gets wet and swells up the sand will compress under the block and very little should wash out. If I see that it going to wash out, then I'll just build a little border out of brick or something to hold it in. The ground right there is pretty level so there shouldn't be any quick runoff. ... of course, I've been wrong before LOL"

No personal debt - this gives you a measure of financial freedom. Harvest your own food (for at least a portion of your nutrition) Have multiple forms of home energy.   We use wood heat, generator available, and adding solar. Understand passive solar heating and cooling. Have a good water source (well) in case your local source becomes unusable. Know some basic first aid and have substantial stores of medical supplies. Have an alternate location (camp or cottage) in case there is social unrest.

SelfSufficiency,3decg4,bbqroast,2,Thu Jul 16 12:41:45 2015 UTC,"Self sufficiency is impossible in this context. Anyone who prattles on about it hasn't thought it through.  Canning ? where do the cans come from ? We bake our own bread, use a wood stove but we didn't make the stove.  The ingredients to go into it we buy, even if you mill your own flour you still buy the wheat, what of salt ? rice ? it's endless.  Do you use a chainsaw, where's the bar oil, replacement chains, and gas coming from ? etc et  You have some chance with a community eg communes,  etc but no chance as a homesteader.  We do it to be closer to nature, away from people and to learn skills to build some resilience assuming the climate scientist have a much higher chance of being right than wrong and to lower our environmental footprint.   We live in the bush, forest all around us, not cleared grazing land.  We could go weeks with no real inconvenience, months with minor inconvenience and if we have to go longer, some bad shit has happened and we're more likely to be okay.  Cities have what.. 3 days of supplies ? are mostly exposed on coast lines,  Katrina, Sandy type incidents are going to get worse and more frequent.  Droughts, look to Sao Paulo etc  If it's a move people want to make it has to be gradual, we simply don't learn the skills these days (using an ax and how to sharpen one for example) and you need to acquire them slowly.  Some people will come up against that wall of ""it's easier to buy honey from the shop then have your own bees"". We try and not do stuff neighbors do e.g they have bees, we swap something we have for honey rather than having bees as well. eg my partner makes cheese and swapped some of her Fetta for honey from the neighbour.  tl;dr cities have no resilience, nor do their citizens.  Their citizens distance from nature leaves them unable to value it becaue they can't understand how it's all inexorably linked and they rely on vast unsustainable practices to keep them going ."

SelfSufficiency,3decg4,bbqroast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"Cities definitely have potential to perserve the environment, but look at what currently keeps cities afloat. Acre upon acre of corn and soybean monoculture (which take out a lot of wildlife habitat) to feed confinement animals which then get processed and shipped to grocery stores in order to feed dense populations in cities. Vast amounts of non-renewable energy in order to heat and cool cities along with other energy needs. So as of right now, most cities are not environmentally friendly. However I do see a lot of potential in turning cities more sustainable with a more localized food system (using greenhouses to produce both vegetables and fish year round. Check out Growing Power in Wisconsin!) Developing more rail and transit systems. And reducing our carbon footprint through renewables."
SelfSufficiency,3decg4,mokana,2,Thu Jul 16 21:58:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about in city production of food, it seems to be counter to the reason for having a city (which is to bring people closer together).  On the other hand, I definitely agree with you about agri. Ideally we'd end livestock growth over the next few years, apparently 80% of our agricultural land is devoted to livestock. Without livestock we could massively reduce our farming area, turn huge areas back to nature, clean out every river (with forests on each side) and still have land left over to feed a 10 billion + population.

""He's never gone without a meal (friends in Moab sometimes feed him).""  ""mixing in fresh almonds he picked from a friend's orchard""  I guess he gets some food from dumpster diving but anybody who has spent time in the woods knows that collecting firewood and foraging all day burns a lot of calories.

You've missed the entire point of his thinking if this is how you see it. You are remaining firmly in the fear and scarcity economy while Suelo has gone beyond it to a gift economy where each person's needs are tied up in the good will of others.   Perhaps the almond growers give away all their almonds to people they know. You're assuming that they'd go under because they're paying high opportunity costs - those almonds could be sold at a good price. But does the story end there? Suelo offers his labor freely to whomever is doing good work. So if enough people went and did this, surely some would offer their labor freely to the almond grower.   Suelo seems to posit that we could supercede the money economy by our ability to both give and receive without expectation. Your assumptions about library internet bills assume that the money economy continues to exist. Your observations about what is dictate what will be. To change things, we have to transcend what is."

The problem with canning is that while you CAN have visible signs such as mold, lids popping, etc you can also have very serious issues such as botulism which may not be outwardly visible but can be deadly. As for redoing cans, if it's been over 24 hours i would not reprocess (Botulism and some other molds leave behind toxins that are not always killed by heat.)

SelfSufficiency,3aho5r,gordonjames62,2,Sun Jun 28 01:33:46 2015 UTC,"Here are a few thoughts.  Background -  I have lived on city water  (Halifax, NS, Montreal, QC, Moncton NB) and with well water in rural areas (Keswick NB, New Ross, NS).  The advantages of water managed by the city is that the cost is low, they do all the maintenance, Insurance us often less expensive,  and there are seldom issues with loss of pressure even during power outages.  When I was on a well I had some of the following issues . . .   In New Ross we found Uranium in the water from a drilled well(180 ft).  We dug a more shallow well(30 ft) for drinking water but then the municipality switched to salt on the road for ice control and I had salt in the well.  After a few months of bottled water we moved to a new job and location.  In the new location (Keswick) we were close to the flood plain of the St. John river/ Keswick river.  Our water was high in iron, and carbonates (hard water) so we added a water softening system that required salt (NaCl or KCl) to refresh/clean  the resin in the water softener.  The whole system requires electricity to run the pump and water softener, a pressure tank so the pump does not run continuously, space for equipment and storage for bags of salt , and is noisy.  If you are thinking self sufficiency, it is best to have a well as a secondary system while still being on city water.  The well will still require maintenance, but if you don't want to bother with regular water testing you can use it for watering garden & lawn, filling a pool etc. SO IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED FOR THE DAY YOU REALLY NEED IT.  This is what we have, but only because the city grew around our current home.  If you are thinking of only short term emergency water, the best system might be a water storage system.  A storage container BEFORE your water heater will give you several benefits.  It can allow the water to warm up to room temp so your heating bill will go down.  It fits on your existing system so there is no difference in ""usability""  You never really notice it is there.  I would use a big water heater not hooked up to the electric system.  This would also work like a settling tank for any stuff in your water before you hot water tank, making your hot water tank last longer.  In our area you are not allowed to have a well or septic system on less than one acre.  They are considering going to 2 acres as a minimum.    If you are thinking of a septic system, there are some benefits and maintenance issues.  We found that the grass always grew best near the septic tank / septic field.  This was from the heat produced by bacterial action, and the moisture from the overflow, and the nutrients."
SelfSufficiency,3aho5r,blaze4545,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:00:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely get a water test done!!! I work in water treatment and a major concern for some wells is bacteria. Here in Ontario, the banks will not even give you a mortgage for a house that has bacteria. You also want to test for things like high iron (staining in toilets, water smells like rotten eggs or blood), sulphur smell, hardness, tannins (mostly aesthetics).  Your local water store should be able to test for this stuff, but just because the water is clean now does not mean that the well will be clean forever. When the winter weather gets warm and the snow starts to melt you may see high levels of sand or iron in your water. Or if an animal dies in your well you can start to have bacteria. Wells are excellent for off the grid communities, but understand that you may have to spend the money to maintain them."

But I saw that you tried to propogate fig trees through cuttings in sand.  I had a friend who had a fantastic fig tree cluster out back that would send off scores and scores of shoots every spring.  So forthe first two years he lived there, I'd take about 2 or 3 dozen cuttings off of those clusters, and try to root them back at the house.  Now, I'm no botanist, to be sure, and my gardening skills are purely intuitive and lore-based, but I'll be danged if I couldn't get a single one of those to root, and I was trying sand, dirt, and water as rooting mediums... nothing doing.  Frustrated, because I had no idea how long those friends would live at that house, I started researching methods for growing fig trees.  (A)  I never read of anyone who said fig trees were ""easy"" to grow, and (B) I stumbled upon Air Layering.  So that spring, I gathered my supplies, cut back the bark, wrapped those trees, and waited.  Time to cut them came and I instantly had 18 fully viable baby trees with solid rootstocks.  Between he and I we only lost 2 that first summer due to what I would bet were faults having nothing to do with the process.  Next year, I repeated teh same dang process, and came away with another dozen or so.  I'm 100% fully hooked on air layering as the simplest method ever to propogate a fig tree.  I'm growing a few other fruit trees, and can't wait to try that out on other tree types.    So bloody simple.  anyhow... good luck out there."

I grow a surplus of fruit and veg every year and preserve very large quantities of food for storage.  As a prepper I anticipate a collapse of society and food shortages. If I had to convert to meat eating to survive I would do so and I have UK legal methods of obtaining meat for my own needs. My plan is to learn and practice the necessary skills from a friend. You might want to learn the skills required as a first step.  I have a lot of respect for people who can hunt for their own needs alongside growing their own fruit and veg, foraging etc. If you were to raise small animals as part of this knowing that your meat is humanely raised and slaughtered then I wouldn't question your ethics. It is for you to decide.  A problem in this reckoning is that on the very few occasions in my life when I have accidentally eaten meat I have had some unpleasant reactions. My body no longer processes meat as food, it reacts as if I have been poisoned. In my preparations for a visit to Japan where vegetarian food is less available than in the UK I could not make myself eat the smallest amount of fish, and never moved on to other meats. I have a huge psychological block when it comes to actually eating meat, although I can accept that my home grown food will never be entirely free of bugs.

If there was no history of vegetarian diets likely that diet is not sustainable. In many warm places vegetarian diets are fairly easy to pull off. In most northern climates it's practically impossible to over winter on plant foods alone.   When you are eating primarily wild foods and perennials you can go into nutritional debt simply because the available calories aren't there. Certain toxins in wild foods can become more dangerous. In many traditional diets the occasional meal of meat acted as a pulse of nutrition and protein that corrected this deficit and reset the system.   Milk, cheese and eggs are good supplements though and if you are the one caring for your animals you can take personal responsibility for their health and happiness. Just be aware that this involves some killing. A chicken flock with half roosters is not a happy flock. Some of those dudes are going to have to be culled and they might as well end up in a stock pot. Also keep in mind that laying rates and milk drops off in the winter."

My partner cries when we swing the axe on the chickens head, or break the Guinea Pigs neck.  If you can't kill at least some of your own meat, you shouldn't eat meat.  There is something about being connected to that which you are killing.  Can you visit a friend and see if you can kill a chicken ? That might make your mind up for you.

SelfSufficiency,38n654,bliess,5,Wed Jun 10 05:10:26 2015 UTC,"People in this thread are mentioning eating meat, eggs, milk and cheese.  I disagree entirely on what I've understood from medical literature.   Milk, cheese, eggs, and meat all contribute to the preventable diseases which are so prevalent in the west: Cancer, heart diseases, auto-immune diseases, diabetes etc.  If you look at the research it all seems to point at these foods as being the main culprits. Saturated fats, dietary cholesterol, IGF-1 production and it's role in cancer ( inversely proportional when comparing animal protein vs plant protein), cooking meat at high temperatures creates heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), compounds linked with some cancers.   Animal and laboratory studies suggest that HCAs may damage DNA and spur the development of tumors in cells of the colon, breast, prostate and lymph system. At temperatures of 350°F and hotter, amino acids and creatine (a natural compound that helps supply energy to muscles and nerves) react to form HCAs. PAHs form when fat drips onto hot coals, creating smoke that settles on food; these compounds have been associated with increased risk of breast cancer.   I adopted a plant based diet, after a pretty serious bone surgery I had a few years ago, and right away I noticed improvements in my overall health and well being. The more I researched it reading books and watching documentaries, the more things started making sense. Of course I also have my anecdotal experience which I'm gladly sharing: it has been easier to keep unwanted weight off, going to the bathroom is a daily occurrence (and I'm not exaggerating here, it takes less than 5 seconds to take care of business on the toilet), I recover faster from strenuous exercise and my endurance is significantly longer.   So if you are eating vegetarian for ethical reasons, I suggest you research some of reasons vegetarian and fully vegetarian (vegan) diets are preferable over any diet which includes animal protein.   The American Dietetic Association (ADA) found that low-fat vegan diets reduce the risk for heart disease in diabetics patients. The interesting part is that the patients on low-fat vegan diets had better results than those following the diet recommended by the American Diabetes Association's guidelines. source   Also,   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes. A vegetarian diet is defined as one that does not include meat (including fowl) or seafood, or products containing those foods. This article reviews the current data related to key nutrients for vegetarians including protein, n-3 fatty acids, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, and vitamins D and B-12. A vegetarian diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients. In some cases, supplements or fortified foods can provide useful amounts of important nutrients. An evidence- based review showed that vegetarian diets can be nutritionally adequate in pregnancy and result in positive maternal and infant health outcomes. The results of an evidence-based review showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease. Vegetarians also appear to have lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates. Features of a vegetarian diet that may reduce risk of chronic disease include lower intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol and higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy products, fiber, and phytochemicals. The variability of dietary practices among vegetarians makes individual assessment of dietary adequacy essential. In addition to assessing dietary adequacy, food and nutrition professionals can also play key roles in educating vegetarians about sources of specific nutrients, food purchase and preparation, and dietary modifications to meet their needs.   All the essential amino acids we need in our diet to thrive are found in plants, with loads of fiber, water, anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals without the cholesterol, saturated fats and excessive calories found in animal based foods.   So if you are trying to do self-sufficiency from a scientifically modern perspective, I suggest looking into everything associated with permaculture, Hugelkultur.   Cool link on Hugelkultur  Backyard Hugelkultur I've linked a little on Hugelkultur, which is only a small part of permaculture practices but it's such a simple solution that has been under our nose the entire time.   Closed carboon and nitrogen loops, using wood and branches to mulch and retain moisture in soil and create a healthy space for bacteria and other critters to fertilize the soil and keep it alive.  The more you learn about permaculture practices, the easier self-sufficency will seem and the more these monoculture practices will seem like ancient and obsolete technolgies.   Everything will start to click.   Just my 2 cents.  Edit: Check out some of the Doctors treating and reversing these diseases with plant based diets:  Dr. John Mcdougall, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. Michael Kleper, Dr. John Novick, Dr. T. Colin Campbell."

Its like saying if you ""sparingly"" drink 1 Coca Cola a month and smoke 1 cigarette a month there will not be much medical damage.

Therefore, you can get very sick from eating too much meat. However eating meat has a purpose.

But, in typical Geoff Lawton style – the problem can become a gifted solution. Geoff used rip lines on swales in the Republic of Macedonia to encourage the heaving of ice to remineralise his fields.

In comparison, a small solar cell costs $10 and will easily yield electricity at $0,90 per kWh. That's why the third world runs on solar cells and small wind power plants, instead of potatoes."

You probably should also take inventory of everything that you tend to purchase that will be sold in glass jars. Here in the United States, many manufacturers are moving towards plastic just because it's cheaper (I don't trust the plastic myself)... for instance, until 2 years ago we were buying mayonnaise in glass jars, but they no longer sell that brand.

This website has 59 designs & floor plans many of which are for passive solar houses, some also designed to be built with solar panels as well. One is even for a modified earthship. Check them all out.  I personally like #51 version 2 titled Viki although it seems like it was designed for a slope.  Here's what the site says about passive solar:  ""Generally (in moderate climates), for good passive solar performance, the prefered plan is somewhat longer on the east/west axis, providing good exposure to the low winter sun, with a somewhat higher percentage of glazing on the south face, less on the north, and less again on the east/west walls to prevent heat build up in summer months. Additional glazing on the south face should be balanced by additional (exposed) thermal mass inside the house. Rooms with more exposed thermal mass (like bathrooms and kitchens) are more effective on the south face than say bedrooms with low mass furnishings (bedclothes, carpets). You wilI see from my plans that I honor the above formula, but fairly often break away into something ""less efficient"". My excuse is that I believe a well designed, well build ""superinsulated"" house can make some passive solar concessions, put more weight on other considerations and still be a ""good"" house."""

Also carbohydrates are vital if there's no fat in the diet (to prevent rabbit starvation), which depends on the meat situation.   Shallots for flavouring stock/soups/sauces. Living off five food items forever would get boring fast. Plus both shallots and spuds grow really well here and can keep well in storage.  Carrots for vitamin C plus added flavour again, also because they can be eaten a snack when raw which I think would be handy.  Spinach for iron (I don't know what the meat situation is in this hypothetical situation) plus baby spinach leaves make a great salad and versatility and variety is going to be important.

My big dilemma is that I hate wasting time/energy/money on a big commute.  I currently live less than a 2 minute walk from my work, and the thought of building outside of city limits seems great from the standpoint of well / septic / self-sufficiency, but why would I add a gas guzzling commute if I want to be more green.  My project for this summer is to add a DIY solar ventilation preheating device to the outside of the house.  The best design from my reading is a screen pre-heater  This will attach to our air exchange, so it increases the air temp of air coming into the house.

Since the potatoes will displace a fair amount of soil, you would probably lose some volume to having to partially fill.   Also, I'm not sure what causes size restriction on the potatoes, so if you imagine a single plant producing a medium number of moderate-sized potatoes, you rapidly run out of room, or possibly create conditions for smaller ones.  I suspect it would work, but it probably isn't ideal.   Edit: as a work around, it might be reasonable to cut the bottoms out, and merely break up and slightly condition the soil below the containers, so that you still only use your ideal soil mixture within the containers (where the primary growth will occur), but there is some additional room for a taproot to burrow."

Versitle and varied (both drying corn and sweet eating corn). Drying corn stays for a long long time.  Winter squash/pumpkin- stores very well and adds variety to the diet.  Tomato- My main nutritional concern is a few vitamins, like C. Tomatoes can practically automatically, ensuring a long shelf life.

The primary definition of nutritionally complete is that, combined, they provide you with all the amino acids that your body doesn't create on its own.  It's been a while since my bio classes but iirc, there are 20 amino acids (which comprise the building blocks for all proteins), and the human body cannot synthesize all of them.  As such, the food you eat must provide the amino acids you can't synthesize, and there are only a handful of 'nutritionally complete' foodstuffs out there.   Brown rice is one (meaning un-hulled, un-bleached), and I can't remember the others."

I feel like I'm really getting something for the money, because our classes are very small and the material is challenging enough that you really do need the infrastructure and support a university provides. It's highly employable, with probably the widest selection of careers of any degree. Aside from the obvious (teacher, engineer, researcher), physics degrees are more likely to get you into med school and other professional programs than any other degree, including biology or whatever the traditional path is for that profession.  More importantly, physics has taught me skills which are indispensable for self-sufficiency. I know more than enough about electricity, heat transfer, mechanics, programming, and other things that my parents and their friends had to teach themselves as they went. A formal introduction to those concepts makes basic household wiring and mechanical repairs really easy to understand.  Probably the biggest skill you get from a physics degree is the ability to make anything into a science and to quickly learn just about anything. It sounds wishy-washy and cliche, but physics teaches you a method of thinking that's far more valuable than any of the facts or formal mathematical techniques you learn. I may not know much about biology, but when I needed to learn about nutrition, I could easily sift through the current research and figure things out for myself, rather than trusting some blog that eating five pounds of kale daily will turn me into superman.  For what it's worth, I'm graduating in a year and I'm certainly not self-sufficient now. But I'm lucky enough to be coming out without debt, and with a lot of very useful skills.

I have a sifter identical in principle to yours, but a very little bit less prototype-ish. But you're killing me, watching how hard you're having to work in that video. To compare, the most I have ever sifted  by myself at one time was around 16m3 12m3 and it took about six hours.  If you get it up off the ground a bit more so that you can stand comfortably, you can use your thighs and you'll not wear out so fast.  You'll also be able to get a wheelbarrow under it for when you need more than a little bucket full.   It also looks to me as though you're starting out with too fine a mesh.  A drawer from the antonius wire shelf from IKEA is what I use for my first pass to remove the largest chunks.  Cut one of the short ends off so that you can easily dump the chunks, too.  Second pass is just two drawers stacked together, and if I need really fine I lay chicken wire down inside the drawer.  More details if you're interested, I can provide.  EDIT: Multiplied wrong."

SelfSufficiency,35l9m7,Haven,1 point,Mon May 11 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"diatanious earth   WOW - this was new to me.  quote from wikipedia below   Diatomite is used as an insecticide, due to its abrasive and physico-sorptive properties.[8] The fine powder absorbs lipids from the waxy outer layer of insects' exoskeletons, causing them to dehydrate. Arthropods die as a result of the water pressure deficiency, based on Fick's law of diffusion. This also works against gastropods and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat slugs. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is very low. It is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness. Medical-grade diatomite has been studied for its efficacy as a de-worming agent in cattle; in both studies cited the groups being treated with diatomaceous earth did not fare any better than control groups.[9][10] It is commonly used in lieu of boric acid, and can be used to help control and possibly eliminate bed bug, house dust mite, cockroach, ant and flea infestations.[11] This material has wide application for insect control in grain storage.[12]  In order to be effective as an insecticide, diatomaceous earth must be uncalcinated (i.e., it must not be heat-treated prior to application)[13] and have a mean particle size below about 12 µm (i.e., food-grade – see below).  Although considered to be relatively low-risk, pesticides containing diatomaceous earth are not exempt from regulation in the United States under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.[14]"

To my understanding, it is possible, but likely the lifestyle isn't going to be anything like what you're used to; depending on how 'off-the-grid' you want to be.  It really all comes down to 'less'. You need to learn to live with less. Solar power is intermittent. Batteries can store energy, but they come with their own problems. Food can be grown, but it takes time, and you'll have to store the majority of it until next harvest. Energy for heating needs to be sourced in a sustainable manner. You can't just keep collecting wood from your local area; you'll have to travel further and further and may disrupt the local ecology though over-harvesting.  What about animals? What about building the house itself? What about sewage? Clean water? Maintenance materials/tools/know-how? Local laws? You're essentially building your own microcosm of a city - lots of bases to cover and they need to work together.  It depends on how independent you want to be; but bottom line is the less you can live with, the easier it will be.  You ~can~ do it, and should try. But: research, and baby steps.  I hope this isn't misleading, but it's what my research has shown."
SelfSufficiency,35kic9,TseehnMarhn,6,Mon May 11 06:28:36 2015 UTC,"Just a few figures  Regarding firewood  we burn about 4 cord a year - so we need a woodlot of around 10 Acres.  (3000 sq foot home)   ""On an average site in New York State, about 5 (full) cords of wood will be removed from each acre every 10 years, an average of 1/2-cord/acre/year.""  ""Poor sites produce only about 1/4 to 1/3/(full)cord/acre/year.""  ""Once a compartment is under management, a firewood harvest should be done about every 10 years to remove about 25 percent of the total wood volume; this represents approximately the growth that has accrued since the last harvest.""   Regarding electricity -   We use around 10000 kwh per year.  We could probably cut to 6000 per year with LED lighting and high efficiency electronics.  We could probably drop to 4000 per year with cooking on a wood stove / wood oven.  Getting rid of the dish washer, clothes dryer and clothes washer could reduce it more, but I would rather invest in more solar panels and batteries.  This website gives estimates of electricity use per household world wide.  I would probably go with a gas or diesel generator for the long Canadian winter if we went off grid.  Regarding food, I would want a minimum of 2 acres   some for greenhouse style production for things outside our growing zone,   some for staples like potatoes that would be the bulk of your calories.  The best planning for sufficiency is to have a small community of like minded people who do some specialization.  I'm not a farmer, so I would prefer to have someone else produce most food.  I like working at the wood pile, and cut & split around 7 cord each year as fun exercise.  I'm in my 50s, so this may not be realistic more than 10 years from now.

SelfSufficiency,35kic9,gordonjames62,9,Mon May 11 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"I have several friends who actually live off grid.  Here is one case study  Here are some Canadian examples in a study that shows what ""Energy Use Patterns in Off-Grid Houses"" is like in the real world.  None of them have the life style that I think I want I am used to.  In planning to go off grid you should keep the following in mind.   Budget - What is your capital cost budget?  It may cost more for startup costs. Are you wanting a maintenance free home, are are you willing to do lots of work for this dream? Rural or urban?  Rural areas often have less building regulations, or the local building inspectors may be friendly towards your project. This Map of location can help you know how much solar energy you are exposed to. Try a starter project to learn the ropes at lower cost. A few years ago I added a sun room to our home.  There were days last month when the temp in the sunroom was 80 deg f, and there was still 4 feet of snow in the ground    I really want to, but everyone is crushing my dreams and saying I can't do it.   Where do you live?  What is your budget?  Are you hiring a builder, or doing it yourself?  Do you have the ability to start and finish a project (sorry if this sounds rude, but many people can't start and finish a project more complex than building a doghouse)  For going off grid there are some things that are big issues.   Heating - more of an issue in a northern climate like mine.  How are you hoping to heat your home?  I use a wood stove, and we only use electric heat when we are away. Laundry - This is a big consumer of hot water and hot air.  If I were off grid I might use propane or oil fired hot water. Cooking - Propane? Air Conditioning? Hot water?  For one friend, some money saved living off grid is used for a gym membership where he works out and showers every morning before work."

We even have cell service and internet, and enough power to run a dryer.

There's lots of folk around us that don't have the right creek to do the same so they have solar panels and batteries, and run propane and get by just fine.

SelfSufficiency,35kic9,Mettephysics,3,Mon May 11 09:23:38 2015 UTC,"Globally over 1.3 billion people are without access to electricity and 2.6 billion people are without clean cooking facilities.   You might not be able to do it, that's the reality of it.  You might simply be unable or unwilling to give up some of the things you have grown accustomed to, or make lifestyle changes that you will need to make.  Many people think the process is very expensive, or that you need to say for example have land and money before you can start on the road to self sufficiency or off grid living.  The reality is you can start the process at anytime, anywhere.  Off grid living, self sufficiency, etc. does not need to be a all or nothing lifestyle change.  You can very easily begin the process while in collage, living at home, an apartment, etc. long before you make the big life changing event.  The reality is that for many people to go directly from living in the city and dump a bunch of money on the lifestyle but not themselves to be acclimated, educated  or prepared for the lifestyle just don't make it.  I'll give you a perfect example I have experienced personally.  My roommate drumped 80k onto an airstream trailer and 40K on a truck to pull it with the plan to travel around the US for a year or two when her husband gets out of the military in about 8 months.  She has used the trailer I think 4 times since she bought it 2 years ago and had grown very accustomed to the standard middle class lifestyle.  Up until I moved in and her dating (and then marrying) her husband she loved the idea of off grid living and self sufficiency but had not started attempting to live in a manner she would need for the life.  She had the standard day to day life of buying coffee a few times a day, having a maid once a week come in, throwing money at things that needed to be fixed or paying others to do it for her.   But in the last year she has really started to make changes to her life.  Previous years she was spending about 10K a year on updating/remolding her house.  This year she has spent almost nothing.  Every project that comes up she has gotten quotes on the work and I break it down about how we can do the work just as good, buy all the tools and equipment needed and she'll save all the money to have others do projects for her, learn how to do it herself and have all sorts of tools to use in the future.  Now days we do all sorts of things to be as self sufficient as possible.  They actually turn off lights in the house and not let the TV stay on all night.  We make our own booze and foods and no longer go out to eat all the time.  No it is not off grid living or self sufficient, but it's a start, and when the time comes she will be prepared for the harshness and changes that need to be made.  I've had a few other friends who have expressed interest in the lifestyle as well.  Many of these people are upper or middle class folks in the computer industry.  I'll talk with them about it but I don't think they have it in them.  Normally I tell them if you're really interested in the idea go out on a 1 - 2 week hiking trip and leave behind all their gadgets and experience a harsh 1 -2 weeks of living out of a tent.  I'm sure a few of them have giving up the idea after having to poop out in the woods a few times as a few of them went out for a weekend or two and just hated it.  Summary:  Start to make lifestyle changes and see if you can adapt to some of the ways you'll need to be living.  Challenge and educate yourself.  Go out and experience the life if possible and see if not only you can do it, but you enjoy it."

You set the growing surface a a slight angle so the water runs from top to bottom with gravity. Then a pump pumps the water back up again.

SelfSufficiency,35aurv,drbudro,4,Sat May 9 00:06:28 2015 UTC,"The company I went with came to my house and took real readings from my roof of what my expected solar access would be.  They then drew up a table that said what my expected output is for each year (taking into account the efficiency degradation of the panels).  If my real output is less, they will refund me the difference in terms of what the ""cost"" for a system that performs at that ""size"" would be.  Let me know if I made that too confusing.  Basically, whichever company spends the most time with you, answers the most questions, and gives you most information is probably the one you want to go with.    West is better than East, but South is best overall considering your utility does net metering.  My utility stinks and they pay me about 1/3 what they charge me per kWh.    I went local and am happy with my decision;  I see the installers around and have their cell phone numbers.    If you can afford to, buy the panels.  Obviously the people you lease from are making money on the deal.

SelfSufficiency,35aurv,gordonjames62,5,Fri May 8 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"I'm in Australia but the prices I've seen are around $8,500 for a 5kW system, not $25k like the other poster said. Around $5,000 to $6,000 for a 3kW. We do have a government rebate but it's hard to find out exactly how much it is, I think it works out to about $1000 per system (so add $1000 to each price if you don't have rebates in the US).  A small home where you're conservative with your power use probably only needs a 3kW system, but get an inverter big enough for a 5kW so you can add panels later if you need to.  In addition to getting quotes from suppliers ask around (via facebook if you've got it) see if any of your friends or neighbours have solar. They'll be able to give you a much more independent idea of how much it costs and what they save.  In my area power costs around $0.30 per kwh, but they'll only pay you about $0.08. So aim for a system that can cover your usage, but not much more than that.  You can google and probably find the hours of usable sunlight per day in your area. They can install the panels on an angle to catch the most sun if needed. There are calculators all over the internet for solar panels, google is your friend. You can do some basic numbers yourself; if you currently use 25kWh of power a day (check your bill), and your area gets about 5 hours of useful sunlight, then you'll need (25/5)= 5kW system. Obviously if your days are shorter in winter and that's then you use the most power then you'll be drawing from the grid a bit, and in summer you'll be putting in to the grid a bit.  Intuitively I'd say to do the roof before you install solar panels, otherwise you might have to remove the panels when you want to work on the roof, but I don't know the specifics.  As I said, I'm in Australia and I don't have solar power myself yet, I've just done research for when I buy a home. Your situation will be a bit different. I'm only telling you what I know because I know what a pain it is to get any specifics."

Lithium is better than lead acid in several ways:   Maintenance  - lead acid requires periodic checking of electrolyte and ensuring that the batteries do not sit discharged for an extended period. Capacity - lead acid should only be discharged to 50% or so (some favor even only 30-40% DOD). Lithium can be safely discharged 95% Weight - not a big consideration for most but matters to some. Lead acid are significantly heavier Lifespan - cheap lead acid batteries will only last 3-5 years. Better lead acid longer but those are at the price of this Tesla unit or higher

This technology is awesome, and really important for day/night arbitrage and a myriad of other important things.  But its not totally enough to be off grid in Texas (if you want AC).    A medium window AC is like 900 watts per hour.  So you'd probably get 8 hours of AC time on the bigger battery (probably don't totally drain a battery each time).  You could run a zillion little fans, though.  The main issue in TX is that AC is such a huge power hog.  And the fact that you often run AC even at nigh when you are 100% on batter power.  If we were in Maine, and we had wood heat and no need for AC, you'd never need nearly so much power.  A bigger AC runs like 1500 watts and a 2.5 ton central ac is 3500 w.  So to run for 10 hours you'd need 30kw storage capacity to cool about 900 sq ft (that's where a tiny house <200 is a huge plus).  And you'd need enough solar to recharge those kw, and run the AC at the same time.  So call it a 6kw+ panel system.  You're still talking like $20-30k.    A propone generator is more like $5k.  Modern AC is still an off grid deal killer.  Probably better to have a huge screen area, lots of cross ventilation, and lots of fans.  In the old days you woulnd't dry off after a shower, just wrap up in a cotton sheet and the evaporation with a fan kept you cool.    Now if the price drops another 2x, things get really interesting.  It might be to stack up enough tesla battery backup to keep a small cabin in AC for 2 days (a weekend stay), and then a modest solar system could recharge over the week.  That would be great."

SelfSufficiency,34maxx,mikkelibob,3,Tue May 5 09:40:01 2015 UTC,"The main issue is just that AC, even pretty efficient window AC, takes a lot of power.

My stove is propane (a converted conventional stove), and my heating is wood & propane.  You can use propane and even efficient solar/battery refrigeration (or just buy ice and have a nice yeti-style extreme cooler).  Washing machines might take a lot of energy, I never tried.  But AC is a hog.    My advice:  build whatever size you were thinking. But assuming its not a tiny home: make one very small bedroom extremely well insulated and energy efficient.  Insulate even from other portions of your house (so the internal walls and ceiling).  Make is small and efficient so that the tiniest little window unit AC can cool things down.  That way you have a refuge.  The rest of the place, just make sure you can cross ventilate, or even better, just screen in a great big porch so 3-sides can catch a breeze.

They are designed to provide and store enough power for 80% of the days. Those days where the site generated power is not enough to meet the demand, grid power is purchased to make up the difference.  Either way, it will be much more cost effective to try to minimize your electricity demand as much as possible. The less energy you use, the less generation you need (fewer solar panels, wind turbines, whatever); the less storage you need (batteries), and the less money you need to spend.   Solar hot water, more efficient appliances, LED lights, wood burning stoves, propane."

To be able to use what the avg. house uses (3-5KW) give or take you would need a source of at least that size. You could set up a capacitor bank but that would just be  replacement for the batteries and capacitors ware out eventually too and per KWh of energy stored are more expensive than batteries.

SelfSufficiency,34f8us,hdt4ever,0,Fri May 1 23:55:57 2015 UTC,"Disadvantages vs Lead Acid:   Low C-Rate  You want to run a 60W of draw (such as a single incandescent lightbulb)?  You can do that on a 60Wh Lead Acid (ie Car) battery without damaging it.  If you want to run the same system with a NiFe battery without damaging it, you need 300Wh of battery. Volume Those 300Wh of NiFe?  They take up 10L of space, so you're talking 5""x10""x12"" battery block.  300Wh of Lead Acid would only take up 5""x5""x12"". Cost 300Wh of NiFe costs between $45-180.  The same 300Wh of Lead Acid costs between $17-42.   So, if you want to make sure you've got a national average 30kWh of power, across the day, and you assume 8 hours of sun, you're going to want 10kW of solar, and 50kW of NiFe to be able to store it.  That will cost you at least $7500, and take up an area slightly larger than 4'x4'x3.5'  The same system in Lead Acid should cost you at most $7000 (for a minimum of $500 savings), take up half the space, and be able to safely handle loads of 5 times the amount of power.  Alternately, you could get away with 30kWh of lead acid, costing only $4200 (minimum savings of $3200), which would take up 30% of the space, and be able to charge a full day's worth of energy in a single hour.  Why haven't more people heard of it?  Because literally the only advantage they have over other batteries is that they don't appear to have a cycle life.  If batteries are anything other than the primary form of energy storage, that's not a problem.  And if you have enough space (say, a the footprint of a twin bed in your basement), the weight doesn't matter, and you can use old car batteries to rig up your system.  They've lost some capacity? Big deal, 6'x6'x3.5' gets you somewhere around 3-4x as much as you'll ever need.  And since they're used, you're probably talking about about slightly less money, and it'll last you the foreseeable future (especially since that huge capacity will extend the life of each cell significantly).  TL;DR:  Because while you could get a decent, reliable system, the initial price tag is pretty scary.  EDIT: Ack, bad math.  multiply all those numbers by 40%"

I absolutely hate the idea that something I am making and spending money on is going to wear out in only a few years. I'm afraid capacitors often do fail, though they would most likely last longer than a lead acid batt, and they are way way too expensive if you need any energy beyond powering a few LEDs or something trivial like that. Recycling lead acid batteries eliminates the harm by the way.  I dont know how much of a budget you have but this might be the answer. I think it is the best system to suit your needs and it would be  easy to wire up and work on if you have basic wiring skills. Supposedly this will last many times what a lead acid batt will and give you greater DoD%. http://www.altestore.com/store/Deep-Cycle-Batteries/Batteries-Saltwater-Technology/Aquion-Energy-S20P-Pre-wired-Battery-Stack-48V/p11629/"

SelfSufficiency,34f8us,JohnnyThree,1 point,Fri May 1 12:46:13 2015 UTC,"Its expensive but if it delivers on what it sounds like its supposed to do might be worth every penny.   Yeah, it's expensive, but it's still about 60% the cost of a comparable NiFe rig in total energy (2.4kWh), and 12% the cost of a NiFe system with comparable power (2.4kW instantaneous, which would require 12kWh of NiFe).  The break even point for a NiFe system would be between 11-18 years.  Event that is assuming you would want to replace the Lead Acid batteries after they were no longer peak capacity, which is not a good assumption by any stretch of the imagination, at somewhere around 8x the energy storage and 42x the power..."
SelfSufficiency,34f8us,R_Carrasco,1 point,Sat May 2 00:39:30 2015 UTC,"the other reason is people say they are more unenvirontly friendly than coal.    Then you have been talking to the wrong people, nearly all of lead acid batteries are recycled, so that's a good start.  That said, any battery technology is going to be destructive due to the extractive nature of the resources. As is living, unless you're using stone tools in a cave... Evan a shovel and axe come from steel, made from burning metallurgical coal and refining Iron Ore.  To try and roll out any battery tech widely, from Tesla's new overhype, to lead acid would effectively kill the environment, if people are looking to drop in renewables for fossil fuels.  It needs to be combined with a simple living philosophy if it's ever rolled out as a sustainable solution more widely.  2 LEDs in a small home is civilised, 100 LEDs in a cement rendered 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom, 3 space garage, one spot for the Tesla S seems to be the goal.  We have been living on solar for 6 years as per  Johnnythree's post.  To go completely sans battery might be impossible, the only 24/7 gen capacity would be run of river microhydro beside a river that never stops but you have debris issues and low and high flow rates of course.  Your're going to need inverters etc and they break down, need replacing.  Other solutions might be a variety of generators  eg our creek flows a lot when it's raining (and not sunny).. I had thought about a micro hydro and smaller batteries next time or wind and solar complementing each other but nothing is as easy as panels (zero maintenance aside from an annual wash with mop,  soap and bucket), they just sit there and generate power when the sun shines or even when it's overcast.  We don't have a generator and go into conservation mode when it rains for days.  Lowest SOC (temp corrected) I have ever seen my batteries is 82% in 6 years.  If you can relocate to a milder climate lkek we did, that solves lots of issues, not much heating or cooling ... a high efficiency refrigerator, LEDs (they won't last 25 years, I have been through 4 in 6 years)"

Good quality Flooded Lead Acid storage batteries should last twenty years (or more) if looked after.  Car batteries, or even ""Marine"" batteries (eg deep cycle) are limited in the number of charge/discharge cycles and are completely unsuited to Solar Work.  The secret to good battery life, is to purposeful oversize them (don't dream of skimping on battery size), never  flatten them, and have sufficient Solar Panels to keep them fully charged.  Good quality, well sized batteries are a dream. Undersized car batteries are a nightmare. Avoid second-hand batteries unless you are sure of their history.  But most importantly, you need to learn how to live with the system's capacity. Monitor your battery voltage and learn how many amper-hours each appliance uses. Never use Solar for heating (eg electric radiator, hair dryer, hot water, etc).  If your funds are limited, build a small scale system, but be careful not to overtax it. Many people build a small system, then complain bitterly that it's unreliable. Live with your capacity."

More work but possibly you could follow the waters line of least resistance and lay a trench under the soil layer filled with stones to help it drain faster to an area where it won't affect what your growing. Just lay a weed membrane over the stones before back filling the soil to stop the stone drainage clogging up. Know anyone with a tractor or JCB that could help?

The ducks will love the swale on one side and on the other side we will get to enjoy lounging in an antique wooden swing hanging from the low branch of a Mesquite tree. This will be a great place to relax and enjoy the ambiance of the garden area. Between the main food garden and this new decorative garden is an alley way where we will continue our compost operations.  What happened to all those tomatoes? Check it out, they are almost all in place. There is still some trellising that needs to happen, but I think they have found their spots fore this season.  As we take a little walk over to the Potatoes overflowing out of the fabric pots we stop to admire the Amaranth, Grapes, Moringa, Asparagus, Cantaloupe, Squash, Zuchinni and Cucumbers. We discuss the challenge with Pill Bugs, A.K.A Roly Poly bugs, as they chew through the tender greens on the Potato plants.  There’s more… Apples, Peaches, May haw, Blackberries, Hot Peppers and Carrots that I want to produce seed.  I'm using an old RV fresh water holding tank as a container for my potted plants to hold water to wick up from the bottom.  Nope, not done… Onions, Arugula, Swiss Chard, Strawberries and the sweet sweet aroma of a Lemon Tree.

SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,daddykirbs,3,Mon Apr 13 14:14:51 2015 UTC,"The video describes my process and reasoning for planting in the buckets. I didn't really plan to well where all the tomatoes were going to go, so the buckets will allow me to move them around as needed. These buckets are mostly old pickle buckets from a local Deli.  The soil mixture is top soil from my own land, compost made here on the farm and some sand from the floor of the chicken coop."
SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,sunpoprain,2,Mon Apr 13 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"Don't punch your holes in the bottom of the buckets. Punch them about 6-7 inches up the sides. Then bury a 2 Liter empty pop bottle with slashes in it. (should ooze water not pour it out the cuts) Enjoy not needing to water nearly as often. Add a packet of micorrhizae fungi with your soil and use a half strength fish fertilizer every 2-3 weeks until the plant sets flowers. There are better fertilizer plans that change the fertilizer as the plant enters different stages (growth, flower, fruit) but I have pretty awesome luck with the fish and micorrhisae fungi treatments.   The pop bottle and high water drainage makes a sub-irrigation planter, the fungi drastically increase the plants ability to uptake water, nutrients, and minerals, the half strength fish emulsion feeds the whole cycle. I can explain in greater depth if you are interested."

SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,sunpoprain,2,Tue Apr 14 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"This is my Sub-Irrigation planters for both starting and growing I have access to a steady supply of empty 2L pop bottles so those are what I use but the 5 Gal planter can use any type of water reservoir made from recycled materials. The diagram I made shows two 24oz bottles as the reservoir and a pvc pipe feed to the bottom. The school class I was teaching this technique to had a lot of 24oz pop bottles. The design I personally use does not require the pvc pipe as a water feed. Instead the 2L pop bottle is buried so just the mouth is open to the air.  When watering I keep my hose/sprayer over the opening to the pop bottle. It doesn't have to perfectly add water to just the pop bottle, watering that general area will fill the bottle as water wants to follow the path of least resistance from saturated soil to open air within the bottle. Once you finish watering the plant will begin to lower the amount of water in the soil which pulls water via capillary action from the bottle into the soil (Its important that the water move via capillary action as this is the only method of uptake a plant has for water. The holes in the bottle should not be visibly open. I just push a knife in and out with no twist to make the holes) Drainage holes are higher up the bucket to create an area of higher water concentration the roots of your tomatoes can tap into during high heat times. Sort of a water table artificially created.  I tested 2 buckets last year, one with holes 6 inches up and one with holes in the traditional bottom. There was a stark difference in growth and hardiness in the 2 buckets. The bucket with higher holes pretty much never showed signs of stress despite my only growing area for them being a north facing wall, in full sun, against a brick wall. (so HOT HOT HOT during our 100 degree plus, drought summers) I also only needed to water the bucket with higher holes about once every 2-3 days whereas the bucket with holes in the bottom required watering about once every 1-2 days (Without the sub-irrigation modifications, my buckets require watering sometimes 2 times a day)"
SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,sunpoprain,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:34:32 2015 UTC,Thank you for all that information! I have a lot to learn.  With the holes in the planting bucket being 6 inches up.. you aren't concerned about 6 inches of water standing in the bottom?
SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,sunpoprain,2,Tue Apr 14 16:42:54 2015 UTC,"My area has been experiencing summer drought with extremely heavy rains early in spring leading to flooding early. I did not have an issue with standing water (part of why I tested 2 buckets last year). This may not hold true across the country but I believe the 2L provides adequate air to the deep roots as excessive water will tend to hold in the 2L rather then the soil. Examining the roots of my plants at the end of the year, I found an insane amount of the small fibrous roots in the top 3/4 of the bucket (enough to hold the soil into a bucket shaped clump without any signs of circling from the larger water tap roots) with deeper tap roots running down into the water reservoir area. I did not note any root browning or signs of die back apart from the segregation of nutrient focused roots (small fibrous) and the deep water roots."

It's not as much of a reservoir but it's something. You may want to replant on of your buckets like mine and test it this year. Make sure its a variety you have in at least one of the buckets with PVC and lower holes and try to keep those 2 together throughout the year to compare.
SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,sunpoprain,2,Tue Apr 14 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"Replied in 2 posts because there was a lot of information that I was sharing and it naturally fell into two categories- Sub-Irrigation Planters and Soil Building. Some of this is meant more for in ground gardens instead of planters, but I figure it's all interesting to a permaculturist.  Let me introduce you to the BEST friend you have in the garden that you probably don't realize is there- Micorrhizae Fungi Essentially they are a class of fungi that colonize soil and form a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with about 80% of plants. (in the garden the only plants that don't form this relationship are the mustards) Micorrhizae fungi actually connect themselves with a plants root cells and trade water/minerals/and nutrients to the plant in exchange for sugar (carbohydrates). Think mighty morphing power ranger zoids all combining together to create a bigger, more awesome whole. The problem we run into as gardeners is that these fungi are kinda delicate and, since we until recently thought soil was a dead thing, our growing practices pretty much all kill micorrhizae fungi. I.e. chances are good any commercial soil you have doesn't have ANY fungi. If you till regularly, fertilize heavily, and leave bare open soil all winter, pretty much neither does your garden soil.    So a couple things you can do to increase your soil health-  (which lowers any need you have to fertilize, lowers plant water requirements, lowers weed loads as your good plants out compete the weeds, lowers plant pathogens as your strong healthy plants more easily fight them off, and lowers plant pests as your strong healthy plants fight them off)    Don't Till your soil!!! Tilling destroys soil structure and literally rips the delicate threads of fungi in your soil to shreds. Worried about weeds? See #2- Plant cover crops on in ground soils. Open barren soil is bad. Fungi need roots for structure, nutrients, and shelter. Cover crops provide all of that between when you are growing (plus like a million other benefits!) -I'm a huge fan of a mix of Hairy Vetch, Red Clover, and Winter Wheat. Anywhere between 2 weeks to the day you are ready to plant in the spring, roll the bed (or stomp it down) to crimp the stalks. This will kill the cover crop in place creating free mulch and feeding your bed throughout the year. Plant directly into the cover crop. For seeds, crimp the plants then 2-3 days later mow the bed as low as possible and, if you really need a flat plain soil bed, turn over just the top 1-2 inches of soil.  Before the advent of modern fertilizers and weed killers a farmer's cover crop mix was a highly researched and protected ""recipe"" that often included 20+ types and varieties of plants. There are mixes that recover ground (they out compete all other plants literally smothering even the most established weeds), there are mixes that provide a living mulch for pre-started plants, there are mixes that provide a big nitrogen boost early in the year (legume mixes with clover can be mowed before planting and worked into the top 1-2 inches of soil), really you name it and there is probably a ground cover mix for it. A lot of this knowledge was lost when we started RoundUp-ing everything and expecting open dirt ""clean"" gardens with everything unnaturally ordered and artificially fed. I expect this to be an area of gardening that grows immensely in the next decade.  Weed often - baby weeds can be killed by scraping the soil. It is SOOOO easy if done every 3-7 days (depending on season) and can be done with a super light tiny hoe in no time at all. Visit your garden for 15 minutes and drag the hoe around anywhere you see weeds. You get to enjoy your garden and you don't have those sucky days pulling giant weeds or that feeling about the end of July when you realize your garden is now a wild jungle. Cover crops help fight this. Weeds compete for fungi attention.  Establish Micorrhizae in your soil where they can't naturally reach or if you have large areas you want to recolonize quickly. They will naturally invade from ""reservoirs"" like wooded lots, some compost piles, etc. If you aren't sure you have a reservoir look for mushrooms after a warm rain. Where there are mushrooms there is very likely to be micorrhizae. You can buy micorrhizae spores to establish colonies in pots. Expect to need to provide more ""food"" in the form of compost or fertilizers like fish emulsion as your plants will be using a LOT more with the help of micorrhizae. For example, a friend of mine mulches his garden with wood chips mixed with lots of green grass. He has such strong micorrhizae soil health that the wood chunks are literally melted within just one growing season and the grass provides the nitrogen to balance all that carbon. He never tills, has almost no weed load in his soil (how much weeds your soil produces - essentially available weed seed- many weed seeds can survive for upwards of 10yrs in the soil only to grow when exposed to sunlight. A strong micorrhizae colony will eat these seeds over several years where they are buried deep in the soil. Coupled with cover crops this makes weeding pretty much a breeze.)   Don't worry about sand or lightening the soil structure of a good topsoil/compost mix in a pot that has micorrhizae. They will do that job for you. On a side note, this year I am testing adding a small handful of red earthworms in larger pots and occasionally burying half an orange in there to give them a little more food. The goal is to create a thriving soil ecosystem!   EDIT:: There are great resources online and in print for building soil structure and ecosystems. This is an area of hugely increased interest to organic growers, permaculturists, and agriculture scientists. Many large Ag-focused universities are running studies right now on Micorrhizae fungi and the effects of a well rounded soil ecosystem on agriculture (along with how to achieve that in modern farming!)."
SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,sunpoprain,2,Tue Apr 14 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"Mycorrhiza:       A mycorrhiza (Greek: μυκός, mykós, ""fungus"" and ριζα, riza, ""roots"",  pl. mycorrhizae or mycorrhizas) is a symbiotic (generally mutualistic, but occasionally weakly pathogenic) association between a fungus and the roots of a vascular plant.   In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's roots, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF or AM), or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi. They are an important component of soil life and soil chemistry.

SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,sunpoprain,2,Tue Apr 14 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"Those plants are extremely leggy and the root ball is way too over grown. They should have been either potted out sooner (by at least a week or two) or potted up again in the green house. EDIT: A stronger fan on the plants could have also encouraged them to stay shorter and stronger. Judging by the color, I'm pretty sure it was a root bound issue from being too large for those pots.  Mixing sand into soil can actually cause it to compact badly - The little particles in the soil fill in around the big sand particles. Essentially at small amounts the benefits of adding sand are negligible, Adding loam and using watering techniques that don't compact the soil top will provide a much greater benefit then sand.  Top the bucket off with soil to account for settling or you are seriously reducing the amount of available soil for roots. It will settle at least an inch within the first 1-2 waterings.  Drill your holes before filling with soil to avoid the drill bit becoming dull faster (grinding into soil/sand)"

SelfSufficiency,32fz2t,googlenerd,2,Tue Apr 14 16:53:38 2015 UTC,"You are adding soil to encourage roots high up the plant. But your plant isn't going to a new pot and, ideally, you want the plant to start stratifying its roots (learning what is close to the soil top and what isn't) to encourage deep tap roots and the heavy feed roots closer to the top half of the bucket. So waiting on those 4 inches or so that you left empty of soil accomplishes nothing but delaying root creation. The stem is there already, you aren't waiting for the plant to grow tall enough to lift it's leaves out of the area you want to add soil to.. Why wait?"

We collect water off the roof for drinking and have a small farm dam to supply water for use in the garden, outdoor shower etc but when we moved here 5 years ago, one of the major considerations for selecting the area in the first place was a goldilocks climate... not to hot, not too cold, not to wet, not to dry.. makes everything else a lot easier."

If you want to propagate, allow the plant to touch the ground.  Anywhere the plant touches, it will root.  However, if you have the number of plants that you want, you should trip the top of the plant a couple of inches from the end.  This will discourage the plant from elongating and will cause it to become more bushy and produce more fruit."

First off, I assume you're not going to dump soil on the balcony, so you're looking at containers?  What's your light exposure? That will have a HUGE impact on yields.  What crops are you growing? Is this crop for market or is it supposed to be used by the occupant? That'll help determine what you grow.  You'll have to know local market prices for each of those crops in Milan so you can calculate economic impact.  There are tons of resources out there for yield calculators, (just google crop name yield) but they all make a lot of assumptions and none of them assume being indoors or on the shady side of a hi-rise apartment building.  I think you should flesh out your idea a little more fully - such as what is the intent of the garden space, and what are the full details of the environment for each garden space."

SelfSufficiency,304jj7,daddykirbs,2,Tue Mar 24 12:44:41 2015 UTC,"It is worth noting that you could see potential issues in the tree's root growth because of this method.  First, the roots are likely to be shallow with daily watering. They've never had to strive deeply for water or nutrients. Shallow roots can result in the tree toppling if presented with a bad set of events once mature.  Second, if you have heavy clay soil or even a moderate amount of clay, consistent watering in a bowl-like ring can cause the clay particles to settle into a hard pack. Essentially forming a clay bowl around your tree. The trees roots are much more likely to turn into the softer inside soil then try to drive through that clay pan. (especially since they are steadily getting plenty of water and nutrients inside the circle) Root circling can lead to again shallow rooted trees, girdling roots, and trees without the root spread necessary to stabilize a mature tree.   You could avoid these issues by reducing your watering to once a week or less. Mulberry trees are extremely durable and even invasive in extreme climates such as Illinois. (100+ summers with up to 2 months of little to no water shifting to consistent sub-zero temps in the winter with 100 degree shifts over the span of days not uncommon, ice storms in May not uncommon, etc) They really only need help during the real extreme droughts while young.   TL;DR Its a nice thought to water and feed that little tree but it needs to get some hardknock life so it can grow up strong and sturdy."
SelfSufficiency,304jj7,sunpoprain,2,Tue Mar 24 13:50:15 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that feedback. I did consider the clay soil compacting there in the circle. My thought was that filling the circle with mulch would help mitigate that. Any thoughts on that?  Also, do you think that the 3 gallons a day will be too much once the hot TX sun come out?"
SelfSufficiency,304jj7,sunpoprain,4,Tue Mar 24 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"If the tree shows signs that it needs water, water it. Otherwise I'd avoid daily shallow waterings. Just keep an eye on the tree and see how it does without extra help from you. A really vulnerable tree I might water during the hottest months. Something like a poor northern spruce trying to survive our intense summers. I'm of the solid opinion its pretty hard to kill mulberries though. If you are concerned and don't have time to take a look at it regularly to see how it is responding to your environment, you could try a good deep watering every three days working around the entire drip line and out 3x the length of the drip line from the trunk. This will motivate the tree to extend both outwards and downwards.   Mulch won't help that ring. Rings are great for bushes, delicate plants. A trees root circle should end up functionally too big for a ring. (Consider that most arborists recommend you fertilize a tree out 3x its drip line. Now go look at a mature tree and think about how big a space its roots cover, that they absorb nutrients from an area 3x the size shaded by its leaves) We want to spur that growth but trees are kinda lazy. If the good stuff that's easy to reach is all within a couple feet, they aren't going to go looking further! Mulch adds even more ""good stuff"" right up next to the tree holding more water in that ring to create a more compressed pan. Hell, the Professor at University of Illinois I learned from told us not to even add compost or amend the soil when planting the tree unless we absolutely had to since it could encourage the same issues. Trees are all about the longterm goal. The issues we cause in them have long term effects and often don't show up until the tree has finally reached maturity!"

It could even actively discourage folks who are interested in the concept once they realize they'll never be able to afford something like this.

It may be only a maximum overall height of building.  Is there any wood on the land which you can use? Doesn't seem likely.  But check out local sources for wood.  Roundwood timber framing is cool stuff, and cheper to source than full milled timbers, also the building style lends itself to small houses, cathedral ceilings, and lofts.    The main man in the roundwood timber framing world is Ben Law, one of the UK's best known eco-builders. www.ben-law.co.uk He does workshops, apprenticeships, and other educational efforts alongside his builds.   If you want solar, some forethought to roof angle and orientation will save you lots of effort in installation and maximize the potential of your rig.  Off-grid is still stupidly expensive and requires access to wind and/or water as well as solar, best to check out grid-tied systems for the time being.  Also batteries are going to be coming down in price a lot in the next five years or so, while the recent reductions of price in solar panels are beginning to flatten out.  Don't forget to check out what you need for drainage for your water use needs, you'll want some kind of system you can install and forget about rather than a septic tank which needs to be pumped out from time to time.  If you have access to a firewood supply, think about wood heat, also a wood stove can heat your hot water.  The cehapest solar application going is solar hot water.  Passive solar heating is something else you can design into a house during the planning stages.  Do make sure you chase down any and all local regulations and codes which could apply to your building, and visit any cool places nearby so you can hear their stories.  The more planning you can do, the more you will save.  And if you need any special permissions or variances, always best to ask first, this is one case where seeking forgiveness after the fact can be expensive stuff.

The biggest is the rise of globalized corporate agribusiness, heavily centralized, heavily mechanized. Most crops just aren't suitable for industrialized agriculture, where things like uniformity, ability to store for long periods without rotting, appearance, the amount of labor required to harvest, ability to transport long distances without damage, and size count a lot more than flavor or nutritional value.  The modern mechanized agriculture strongly favors monocropping, to the detriment of many other things.  A lot of those defunct apple varieties don't keep very well, and bruise very easily in transport, so they're not suitable for modern agribusiness.   For example, in my youth (1960s and early 1970s), there were multiple varieties of smaller strawberries in the supermarkets. Then sometime in the '80s, the Sequoia strawberry appeared, largest and blandest of all varieties. Today, that's the only variety that gets sold in most stores. The smaller ones had better flavor imo. Wild strawberries are the smallest, but also the most flavorful and best-tasting of all.   But Sequoias require much less labor to pick the same volume than the smaller strawberries, so they are more profitable."
SelfSufficiency,2y71uo,boumboum34,2,Sat Mar 7 01:51:05 2015 UTC,I wonder if the strawberries case can be generalized into a broader heuristic for all foods. The complaint that past foods were more flavorful occurs for many fruits. Maybe it's just a density thing.

I'm pretty well read on natural building and a master electrician who has built a ton of stuff. I am building a straw bale cottage to begin with, post and beam construction and a metal roof. Rain water collection, high r value, fast, simple and very cheap. Cob or lime plaster over a framed straw bale wall is way faster than cob by itself.  After I intend to build a earth home and a lot of the ideas from earth ships will be incorporated but not all. I watched a guy grow old overnight from papercrete. Do yourself a favor and pour concrete wherever you like, knowing it's design and your lifestyle is what makes it ""green"". Don't put bottles and cans in a wall if it's load bearing, don't use tires unless you have a plan to vent off gases and don't be afraid to use some traditional methods to insure a strong durable structure.   Read Passive Annual Heat Storage if you do an earth home, hell read every natural building book you can get your hands on and don't limit yourself to one design or another. My 40 acres is here in the Colorado Rockies, tons of beetle kill lumber at my disposal and I have a neighbor with a mill. There's lots of agriculture so straw is also abundant and cheap but there is not much clay near me so straw bale/ post and beam it is for me.   Look around your area and evaluate your resources before setting your plan in stone. When you think you know what you want, research and then research your research. Ask locally like minded people what they did, my neighbor built a few straw bale homes and said that the one that wasn't post and beam ended up cracking it's plaster regularly do to the extreme weather. You don't build an igloo in California and you don't build an earth home in a swamp."

As for snow clearing, snow will generally slide off, if you get enough of it, but when you get a light dusting it will often just sit there.

I'm no entomologist, but if bugs can develop resistance to conventional pesticides, why can't they develop resistance to this bug-killing fungus? If this somehow gets around the resistance problem, that would be great, but all it takes is two bugs strong enough to survive it, mate, and pass on their resistance genes to a whole new generation. Also, the statement that ""it's essentially free"" sounds pretty naive to me. You've got to buy the fungus from someone, and they have to produce it somehow, so even if it only involves sprinkling a little powder on dirt and watering it, that still requires labor and capital. Who has access to these and is already in the market? The fertilizer/pesticide/herbicide companies. If anything, this is just a next-generation pesticide. This isn't going to kill big bad Monsanto."

If you comb through my post history, you can see albums of insects infected, mostly Whitefly.   This isn't a new concept; BotaniGard and products like it have been around for awhile. I've found it to be greener than other chemical pesticides, though they can often be used in tandem, and though resistance is possible, it's less-easy to build resistance, especially if you rotate your pesticides like any responsible applicator/supervisor should. Hell, B. bassiana is an endophyte naturally in some plants and can be encouraged in others.

SelfSufficiency,2wgivj,massiveCan,2,Fri Feb 20 09:53:40 2015 UTC,"From their FAQ   Q: How do I stop the bees getting to the honey while it’s draining out of the Flow™ hive?  A: Quite often we can drain the honey out without the bees even noticing us at the back of the hive, but sometimes they do and you will need to cover the jars, or better still, make a sealed system. This can be achieved by simply making a hole in the lid of a jar for a tube to go into.    If you are using a bucket, you can put many holes through the lid of the bucket or make up a manifold.   I'm curious to see how this does on Kickstarter on 23-Feb-15"
SelfSufficiency,2wfmpu,daddykirbs,2,Thu Feb 19 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"For those of you who don't want to watch the video, it's cool. I start out showing how I'm planting the 12 varieties of tomatoes in the Jiffy tray. I label each variety by writing on a clothes pin and attaching it to the edge of the tray above a row of 6 peat pellets. There are 12 pins each with a different label.  We move into the greenhouse where I show how I'm hoping to keep the rats out of my seedlings. I'm using an old firepit covering to enclose the tray of seedlings.   Up in the orchard we get to see the Nectarine and Pear trees with blossoms at different stages. My challenge with the Nectarines is that I chose to plant a tree with a very low chill hours requirement. I thought this was a good move since we don't get very cold Winters here in TX, but this can bite you in the butt if it warms up too early then freezes again in lat Feb. All the fruit will be lost.

I like to grow large amounts of storage vegetables like carrots, beans, potatoes and onions, and things that can be preserved like pickling cucumbers, tomatoes, beets. We also grow pumpkins, garlic, corn, and a few kinds of peas and beans. Plants that require a longer growing season than we have can be started from seed indoors around March /April.  For fruit, raspberry bushes and strawberries do quite well, and pear trees thrive in a cooler climate. Things like spinach, lettuce, and peas are somewhat frost hardy and can be started as soon as the ground is soft, so I've had success with those as well."

Keep them in the ground a little bit after frost and then harvest. They are also easy to store.  Just those two sections above will provide you with a lot of food. Beyond that, experiment with potted tomatoes and beans. Find a little microclimate that gets warm a little early and use that area for tomatoes/peppers."

SelfSufficiency,2upp5c,IreadAlotofArticles,6,Wed Feb 4 23:28:02 2015 UTC,"Iv done some research into building one of these. The most common problem is tar buildup, which ruins engines in a short order.  The solution is to make sure the gasifier gets hot enough to crack the tars down into smaller hydrocarbons. You can add a feedback loop for lack of a better word that draws gasses back through the hearth to crack them further. You do add tar filters, but if theres less tar to filter, the better.  Your engine will run like shit probably on this stuff. Id say it would be good for a small generator or something, but I would really hesitate to use it on a vehicle unless I really got the setup down perfectly.  They are also relatively picky with what size fuel they take. Wood pellets would be ideal due to their uniformity. Wood chips are ok, but their less uniform size means theyre harder to feed consistently and evenly. Youd probably have little to no luck running this on leaves and sticks. You need a reliable way to produce fuel of a fairly consistent size. You need to use hardwoods that are seasoned, theyll produce the least amount of tar and burn the hottest.  These things get fucking hot as shit. Youll need to probably make repairs occasionally, and they need to be airtight for maximum efficiency.   Disclaimer: I have not built one of these but this is just what my research has led me to. AMA"

During the production process biomass or other carbon-containing materials are gasified within the oxygen-limited environment of a wood gas generator to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These gases can then be burnt as a fuel within an oxygen rich environment to produce carbon dioxide, water and heat. In some gasifiers this process is preceded by pyrolysis, where the biomass or coal is first converted to char, releasing methane and tar rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

If those 5 places don't mesh with your needs, research another 4-5 places. Don't guesstimate or ballpark it - call the townships / local authorities. For example - in my township, we are REQUIRED to have a well and septic system. IT doesn't matter if we can get water elsewhere or have a composting toilet - we are required to have well and septic. Well cost over $4,000, septic cost over $18,000. If the land you buy doesn't perc, you'll need to hire a soil scientist ($600 - $1200) to see if an alternate septic system will work. These prices are for my land in my area - they might be a lot different in other parts of the country. You'll need to make quite a few calls to get the info you need. You'll need to talk with someone from that state's Dept. of Transportation to make sure you can install a driveway on your land. Some places won't let you put a driveway in if the hill is too steep or the road is too winding.  You'll need to know how the land is zoned - residential, commercial, rural, etc. Then you need to be sure that you can do what you want to do on that land. You also want to research what's around there. For example, I found an amazing piece of land at a jaw-droppingly low price. I was ready to put in an offer, until I Google Mapped it -  turns out there was an auto garage around the corner that I didn't see when I visited the property - it opened at 7 a.m., and it was LOUD. Another piece of land looked perfect - lots of acreage in the woods, at a very low price. I Google mapped it and it looked perfect. When I went to make a visit - the road was so long, hilly, and full of potholes, it was almost impossible to access. It would be impossible to navigate in the winter.  So make sure you NEVER buy property sight-unseen.   I recommend sticking to the U.S. first, unless you are fluent in Spanish or Portuguese, because you'll have to talk to a lot of people to ask a lot of questions."

SelfSufficiency,2u1b32,adventure_dog,2,Thu Jan 29 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"Remember that elevation has an impact on the climate as well as the latitude and surrounding geography.  Much of NM is rather high in elevation, remember that NM has the highest (in elevation) state capitol in the US.  There are ski resorts in NM.  But it just depends on your tolerance for cold.  I don't like shoveling snow, I don't like 5 months of winter... I currently live in Dallas where it gets cold (most winter is lows of 40, occasional dips into the teens) but it only lasts 8 weeks or so with nice breaks of 70-80 degree weather here and there.  I cherish the breaks in the winter weather, and not having to own a snow shovel.  I believe that there are some earthship communities already near Taos, NM... so there would be a good community of people who are experienced with that lifestyle.  And building codes there obviously wouldn't be a big issue either.  As far as saving up... my situation is a bit unique.  I work in IT and can work from home as long as I have reliable Internet connectivity.  I'm looking to build a second home for now since my wife still has to go into the office to work for now, and get it fully ready for us to be able to move there when we are ready.  Where I'm looking the water is harvested rainwater, the power is solar, and the supplementary fuel is propane.

SelfSufficiency,2u1b32,gordonjames62,2,Fri Jan 30 00:38:45 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is whether you will have to finance the land.  I'm not sure about all states, but here, if something happens during the term of your loan and you lose the land for any reason, the property owner does not have to reimburse you for any improvements. There is a land owner here that likes to finance his parcels, encourage people to develop them, and then take the land back so that he can sell it to someone else and repeat the cycle. He has been known to put weird stuff in his contracts so that he can claim a breach to force people out.   In short, it's not a great idea to build on land that you do not fully own and be sure that you read your contact thoroughly before purchase. There may be weird stuff!   Also, you may not be interested in maintaining more than 1 acre full time but you may be able to get a better deal on more acreage. Another plus is that you can put your home anywhere on the land and use the rest as a buffer between you and potential neighbors. You can always use less of your land but it can be hard to buy surrounding plots once you are established.   While I can't give you solid numbers because there are too many variables, I want to give you some advice that I wish we had been told. If you are going to a rural area you can expect to spend twice what you budget. Unless you are really handy or have friends nearby to help, things can get real pricey real fast. We had to do our own plumbing and learned some hard lessons fast when the pipes froze, then burst,  two weeks later.   Good luck with your project, I hope it goes well!"

Full on hard core living off grid.  This is usually best for people who have money saved up, or people willing to go with subsistence farming.  The reason I mention this is that a the hard core people talk about buying land and building a place.  If I were 26 and single again I might try to do things a little differently.  Here is what I might try now.   Lease / Rent some land from a farmer who is willing to help you with your project.  Think how easy it would be to build ""Bag End"" if you had access to farm equipment.  Think how great your garden could be if he did the tilling and gave you his wisdom on farming. Figure out how much electricity you want for your life style.  Decide if solar or wind power (or even water power) is the way to go.  [Here is a link about the average KWH used by people in different countries.  Americans and Canadians use way more than people in most countries.    If you choose to live on less electricity you can figure out how many solar panels you need. Thinking about what kind of place to build . . .  Do you want to go with passive solar and lots of windows?  Do you want a super insulated earth house?   Do you want to work on the farm part time to learn farming skills?"
SelfSufficiency,2u1b32,Umbrius,3,Mon Jun 15 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have clarified that I fully intend to practice subsistence farming and maybe even selling extra crops locally if possible. Most of the books I have been reading involve sustainable farming on 1/4 acre which is about what I was thinking as I don't need much. Land sizes that small are tough to find in online classifieds for land sales so I imagine I would need to do some footwork like you said.  Northern CA is where I would look if I were to go that route and the concerns about water in the southern states are valid (New Mexico also has some of these problems from what I hear). I've heard that Colorado is a solid option but that soil quality there will be need to be investigated thoroughly as it tends to be a bit rocky (no pun intended). Colorado is also an ideal destination for me because I visited as a child and have vivid memories of its remarkable beauty. I feel like visiting all of these places would be financially impractical so maybe it would be best to do lots of research on each states local agriculture and narrow it down to like 2 strong candidates? Everywhere has its pros and cons but it would be nice to find something promising in a place where this type of lifestyle is thriving."

The cold is NOT my thing. We have a good sixed acreage but basically use 3 acres. The house is 3500 sq. feet. and we have concrete surrounding it with an 18,000 gallon inground pool and the driveways can fit 16 cars. No, we are not wealthy.   We run on solar. We raise our own meat for the most part. Pigs are not allowed here because of the feral  hogs, so we do buy pork when we want chops or ribs or bacon. OK, so we buy a lot of bacon.   We grow the vast majority of our food. With a year round season, it makes sense. Of course, we do have to buy things that we cannot grow here like apples, peaches and walnuts. They just don't grow here.   When it comes to hunting, we have deer (they're smaller than up North), bear (and lots of them) alligator, and your typical ground animals. We also have access to fresh, brackish, and salt water for fish.   I would strongly advise that you make a list of pros and cons about every property you visit. Our big thing was having the ability to get solar power consistently, be able to grow our food and raise livestock, and hunt food if needed. Everyone's needs are different. Know what you need, take time to research and you will do well."

I have a similar video (actually of him in the chicken coop), they are completely stunned by light, he probably couldn't see anything while you were doing that.  I have a feeling if your chickens are free to roam around at night that they will be ok, i think my chickens were stuck in the coop and a opossum got in leaving them no where to run.

Of course it depends on the size of the tree, we did not tap anything less than 8 inches in diameter.  You drill into the phloem of the tree and that protion dies and is sealed off by the tree in a healing process, so the next season you have to drill the hole in a different spot, so you have to be careful not to girdle the tree completely.    I have heard of people tapping 2 or 3 large trees in their yards and getting a quart or so from that.

To get sap from a sugar maple night-time temps need to be freezing, and daytime temps need to be up in the 40s or so.

We had a home built solar array, with mostly used panels. This was in the early 2000s so price per watt was still about 5 bucks (new.) We used standard 12 volt wet cell car batteries (about 10) until my parents found a used forklift battery (gel cell) to replace them. We scraped up a few inverters and charge controllers and frankensteined a decent model of each. (My step dad is a phenominal electrician) the house was already built, we just spruced up the insulation and found a great rooftop solar eater heater that we got running with minimal repairs. We also got lucky, there was a perfectly functional compost toilet in the garage when we bought the place. (Ventilation parts included) we also had a 5kw Onan generator that we found for 500 bucks on Craigslist (with electric starter!) It was in shape with minimal repairs. We only used this to run the hair dryer for mom, or to use power tools.  A 1kw wind turbine came into play eventually. (Treat people right and they will treat you right in return, if you choose to surround yourself with the right people)  We had a propane powered stove/oven and refrigerator. The winter sucked sometimes (only due to freezing pipes on occasion.) We also had well water. All in all, the cost of utilities for us was only about 50 bucks a month at most, and the system (according to the rents) only cost about 5k total.

Additionally it uses tons of concrete, which is quite polluting (in construction). It's not like this house has replaced a less efficient one.  Secondly, the people inside are living far from various conveniences. I'd imagine they drive far each day, and can't use communal services. It might be far more efficient to stay in the city, where driving is reduced (and can even be eliminated), heat can be shared (apartments often only have 1 or 2 walls open to the outside air).

SelfSufficiency,2ro26n,bbqroast,2,Thu Jan 8 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah but cities tend to make the process more efficient. Yes that food has to be brought to you, but instead of one person driving their car to a store (which requires regular small truck deliveries) you have a large truck being driven along a level, well graded motorway (or even better, a train on rails) carrying food for huge numbers of people.  Likewise, communal services help a lot in cities. In a rural area people will generally do things themselves (eg have their own workshop, keep their own tools, etc), whereas in a city people will tend to use shared services (eg hire someone to fix things, go to a public gym, etc). Not only is this more labor efficient (we have more freedom to focus on a particular thing, allowing greater productivity) but also more environmentally efficient (we need less stuff for day to day living, preventing wastage of resources & duplication of effort).  People notice pollution in cities because they're denser - thus the pollution is more noticeable. However cities can often be much more efficient on a per capita basis (especially if excessive suburban sprawl is avoided)."

I am happy to sign as many petitions as I can and stand in the street, and occupy parks, but I find it would take an unprecedented set of social circumstances to create this kind of system.

If you compost with carbon and properly stir the pile, the aerobic bacteria introduced naturally from the carbon substrate/air with out-compete gut bacteria or the oxygen may kill the gut bacteria altogether.  Especially after composting followed by spreading, followed by resting as the plants grow.  I think that is plenty of time.  I would venture to say the over cautious approach is due to the few outliers who would go shit on a fresh crop and then eat it without washing it.

SelfSufficiency,2rfyge,Disco_Bits,11,Mon Jan 5 21:45:39 2015 UTC,"Self-Suffiency comes in a lot of forms, but most of it boils down to making some thing or some activity that was once mysterious into something known. In my experience, I find it best to start with something you want to know and then back track it down into simpler and simpler pieces until you reach a point of greater understanding.  My go to example for this practice is bread. Store-bought bread comes to us already baked, sliced and neatly packaged. We don't do anything except pay for it and eat. That's not self sufficient, though. If all the store bread suddenly disappeared, we'd be sunk. So we backtrack, and teach ourselves how to make the bread. It's actually quite simple. A mixture of yeast, water, salt, and a few cups of flour. Left to rise and baked, it's even tastier (and better for you) than the store-bought variety. Now we're more self-sufficient than we were by buying bread made by someone else.  Taking it even further, if you had a place to grow wheat, you could grow and mill your own flour rather than buy it. If you live near the ocean you can draw water to yield sea salt. Yeast can be bred on your own in a desum, or starter dough set-up. Taking these steps would go back to the simplest of tools and make your loaf of bread entirely self-sufficient.   This kind of thinking can be applied to most any consumable or task. It involves cutting out the involvement from others one layer at a time. Create your own compost and dirt instead of buying it. Learn to fix simple leaks instead of paying the plumber. There does come a point, where simplifying things further becomes impractical (like growing your own wheat to make bread). The fun lies in seeing far back you can go before you reach that point."
SelfSufficiency,2rfyge,dreamer_of_evil,4,Tue Jan 6 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"Great advice and an excellent example!   I'd put in a few additional steps between ""baking your own bread"" and ""growing your own wheat"", though ;-) Like, once you're regularly baking your own bread, go to the next level by buying wheat/grain and milling it yourself. This way you can acquire the necessary tools and skills gradually, over time. (I live somewhat self-sufficiently and have been doing the baby steps for something like 25 years, live on a 1.7hA country smallholding and I still don't try to grow my own wheat/barley on any meaningful scale.)  imho Self-sufficiency is mostly a state of mind; a sort of mental stance that looks at a task and says, ""How hard can this be? Let's give it a go."" I think that one of the mental blocks to overcome is the idea that doing these basic thing for yourself somehow requires more time than simply going out and buying stuff. It's very frequently not so, and, indeed, often the exact opposite.  btw, It's worth noting that (in my experience, at least) home-made bread (especially if made with your own sourdough yeast culture) actually has a significantly longer shelf life than factory-made bread that's supposedly stuffed with chemical preservatives. Don't know why; seems counter-intuitive, but there it is."

Like the other posters said, just pick something and take it back from automatically showing up at your house.   You don't have to raise and slaughter your own cows, but you could do small things that make you more self sufficient.  Beyond food, what do you know how to do yourself?  Can you maintain your car (oil, brake pads etc)?  What home maintenance can you perform yourself?  I use this book a lot.  I don't do all the things in the book, but it gives me ideas on what I can learn to do myself.  :)     http://www.amazon.com/The-Modern-Day-Pioneer-Simple-Century/dp/B00DPNV6A2"

I don't know about any urban eco-villages that would be similar to Dancing Rabbit, but I do know of a group of houses (three or four) in Columbia, Missouri that co-op a massive garden in their collective backyards and live sustainably that I think is more of what OP is looking for. I'd check here for a similar location closer to you, (if I'm not mistaken one of the founders of DR actually set up the website!) you can specifically search for urban projects.  Side note, if you ever get the chance you should definitely go check out Dancing Rabbit. Their population hovers around 70-80 or so, and there's a number of other homesteads and eco-villages in the area, including Red Earth Farms which has been operating for over the past 40 years.

SelfSufficiency,2orlsk,daddykirbs,7,Tue Dec 9 16:28:12 2014 UTC,"Some experience! A couple pointers: a larger tube requires more water but makes getting the bubbles out much easier. Also, a few drops of food coloring go a long way toward making the water level easier to read. We never put a valve on our tube but we did get in the habit of covering the tube with our thumbs before we moved it.  What often happens - one person gets excited, lifts their end of the level, which shoots water all over the person at the other end. Especially when you are finding multiple instances of level, this also screws you up and you have to sort of reset everything.  Two other mods I like: a stake on the bottom that allows you to plant it securely in the ground, so that someone doesn't always have to be holding it upright. Also, we even used hair ties as a level mark - put the two ends together, roll the hair ties up to mark level at some point on the ruler, then you know much more quickly how far you are off level as you go. Not sure if that makes sense. I can explain more if you want.  edit: you already had the ruler covered so I took that out."

SelfSufficiency,2orlsk,smegnose,3,Wed Dec 10 15:33:44 2014 UTC,"I used a simpler one than that when doing the levels for a DIY shed. One end on a stick, other end in a bucket of water, bottom of stick was my surface level. Never used one before, only saw a video but was easy and worked a treat. Whether or not you have fancy valves, let the air in/out slowly by taking your thumb off an open end for very short periods, i.e. less than a second. It helps get the level faster than waiting for the water to finish ""rocking"". This will also stop water spurting out, which can happen quite quickly, forcing you to reset it to your marks."
SelfSufficiency,2orlsk,AmishRockstar,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:00:37 2014 UTC,When I was a teenager I worked with a crew that leveled up mobile homes. They used a water level that had a bucket on one end as well.

It's still the best tool, hands down, for transferring a level line around a corner of a building, or into another room.  I haven't used them much in many years because lasers are so cheap and ubiquitous now, but all we ever used was a clear plastic hose from the supply yard. I think they were about 1/2"" in diameter, and yeah you NEED to get all the bubbles out or it don't work.  Pretty simple device though. No real learning curve to it, and it works! It's been around at least since the Irish built the pyramids so that oughta tell you something. You don't really need all those fancy modifications either. I suppose they don't hurt, but just the tube, water, and something to mark with works fine.

If you're, say, Apple, you can rape your resalers and still force them to thank you for the privilege. Then sure, do it: forcing a SRP means determining how margins are distributed, and ensuring that you make the bulk of it. But if you're a startup trying to conquer an existing market, you need distributors to be your allies, so you leave them determine their margins.  This is a CMU spin-off: they don't specialize in marketing, nor distribution logistics, nor customer support, and they come to disrupt a mature market. They have to leave sales to partners, so they have to treat them as partners: they will choose their prices.

Low-cost off-peak electric power is used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand, when electricity prices are highest.

Pump water to a header holding tank up the hill when we have sunny days, using an electric pump from our solar system, this can last about a week of water usage if we a get lot of overcast days so need for a generator to charge the batteries. No need to run a pump for water when we shower etc  As for generating electricity, pumped hydro is done now but not really feasible with tanks.  If you had spare land on a reasonable slope you could dig large earthen dams above each other and go for it."

If the quantity of water storage isn't an issue (large cheap tanks or holding dam), water has to be cheaper, but also consider the loss of energy in each of the conversions solar>pump>pipe resistance>turbine, each step has a loss."
SelfSufficiency,2mu00k,Machegav,1 point,Wed Nov 26 22:37:46 2014 UTC,"I think loss of energy is more a concern if you are paying for the energy to run the pump - so a solar panel means that's not a problem.  There'd be no point to using a solar panel to run the water up and then straight through the turbine. I should have said the top tank would have a valve. You fill it up, release the valve and it runs through the turbine. It'd no doubt be a lot stronger, energy collection wise, than a small solar panel would be (but a small panel is probably all you need to eventually fill that top tank). The idea is you'd just need a small panel, the tanks and a few other cheap things. It'd be much cheaper than a big solar array and battery array (also batteries eventually die, while this set up will last much longer and be cheaper to replace too).   But it would be bulkier - I'm wondering how much bulkier."
SelfSufficiency,2mu00k,Eat_The_Muffin,2,Thu Nov 20 07:18:11 2014 UTC,"Well let's run through it theoretically. It all depends on how far up you can pump your water - the change in energy depends on its height in the Earth's gravitational field.  The average American household energy usage is 903 kWh/mo, or 15.05 kWh in a twelve-hour period (which I am approximating as a ""night""), which is 54.18 MJ.  Lead-acid batteries have an energy density of 0.56 MJ/L, and deep-cycle lead-acid batteries are best used when they're cycled down to around half of their charge each time.  Therefore you'd need a battery of 193.5 litres (or a cube 0.57 metres to a side) to run your house all night (this is only an approximation, of course, depending on your hours of sunlight, energy usage at night, etc).  The equation for gravitational energy is U=mgh, where U is energy in Joules, M is mass in kilograms, g is gravitational acceleration in metres per second squared, and h is altitude in metres. To store 54.18 MJ by pumping water to the top of a two-story building (~6 metres), you would need 920,489 litres of water (which would be a cube 9.73 metres to each side). Which is a lot larger than your battery.  To store that energy in the same 193.5 litres, you'd need to pump the water 28.5 kilometres in the air.  This all assumes perfect conversion between gravitational/chemical energy and electrical energy, which is of course never the case.  (Several edits to give more numbers and fix some things)"

I'm getting better at making beer and kimchi (generally not at the same time...) and I even made flour out of chestnuts and acorns I foraged.  Acorn flour was especially surprising, that will become an every year thing for sure!  Now I'm drying out persimmons in the korean style - 곶감.

I have researched spirulina a lot and I know how to produce my own, so looking out for cheap/free glass aquariums, and I know I have at least one at my parents place I can grab. You can pretty much live on spirulina alone, so going to be eating a lot of that, along with the veges I grow over the summer.  I stopped smoking and replaced it with ecigs, which is a lot cheaper.  It's coming into summer, so I'll be starting to brew my own beer again. Already have all the equipment for that.

My shoes are wearing out, so I think I'm just going to give up on wearing them except to go to work. Too expensive to replace shoes.  I have researched flax types and weaving, and I'm going to weave a replacement satchel instead of buying one. Eventually a backpack. But first of all, a belt. I'm sick of my pants being loose, and store bought belts never seem to last very long with me.  Long term goals...  Produce my own biodiesel from algae that I can use to power a generator.

I constructed a cold frame from some salvaged windows for one of them and used PVC and 6 mil. plastic to put tunnels over two others. This should keep us in lettuce a bit longer and give us a bit of a start on things in the spring.  We expanded our flock of chickens from 8 to 12. In one way we're a little less self-sufficient because we did in our rooster as part of the chicken changes. On the other hand, the hens and I are all less stressed and I am fairly confident in my killing-things skills. Our new chickens are taking their time coming into lay and it may be spring before they give us much but with lots of neighbors interested in eggs, I will easily recover the cost of feed when they get going.  We grew over 200 pounds of our vegetables this year. We ate fresh all summer and have loads frozen and canned. I also found a killer deal on canning jars on Craig's List and now have enough collected to do an entire year's worth.  I learned to cure bacon and corned beef and to grind and season sausage from pork shoulder.   I've spent the year reading like mad about goats and bees. I have wanted both for quite some time and I hope to decide by the first of the year if I'm going to give either or both of them a shot.  My goal for next year is to double our vegetable production, plant three dwarf fruit trees, triple our rainwater collection capacity, do some work in our basement to be used as a food-storage area and install a small solar system to provide outdoor power to our shed.

They're not really ""canned"" just in pint jars in the freezer as I would need a pressure canner to properly can pumpkin mash and all I have is a boiler canner.  Each jar is 1 pumpkin pie worth of mash. I'll probably be making soup and gifting them too.  I also made salsa pretty much from my garden this year (tomatoes and jalapenos) and tons of pickles too. Saying that, I had to buy ingredients for every one of those. Before this year, I never had canned anything. And now I have soooo much. We also had fresh zucchini, summer squash, tomatoes, pole beans, parsley, 1 corn on the cob (haha, I kinda failed at corn this year), tons of mixed lettuce for most of the summer.  This next year, my vague (thus far!) plans include: 3 more raised garden beds (4x8), hops and many more root vegetables.

I currently make mead, but you can't drink mead everyday. It's strong and will leave you with a nice hangover. So I want to get into brewing beer.   I've been big into very basic woodworking this year. We made 2 workbenches, some bookshelves and an awesome patio table that has beer coolers in the middle. I also re-worked chairs from Goodwill to go with that table (spray paint and new outdoor upholstery/outdoor foam pad).  We very badly want to upgrade to a king bed.

Then, unfortunately, we have to purchase the wood. But if my calculations are correct we should save about 1/2 the money we would spend if we just bought a king bed (not including nightstands and lights, etc), not to mention how sturdy this sucker is going to be. It should last till we retire, at least.   I realize that working full-time it's fairly unpractical for us to be self-sufficient, there's just not enough hours in the day.

SelfSufficiency,2miuv4,LonelyNoble,3,Mon Nov 17 02:54:32 2014 UTC,"I cant think of anything that fits your description, is this meant as an affordable homestead setup?  I think rustic biofuel welding would be a hearth for brazing. Converting a multi fuel camp stove assembled into a small oven of firebrick, coat the metals to be bonded in flux, heat to temp, and then add brass. A diesel generator mobile welding rig would do the trick as well, more versitile and more expensive too."

In a hypothetical situation, I'd have a bag with general stuff including said torch while out in my fields. It's basically so I can mend a tool 'on-site' without having to walk all the way to my workshop. But I do like the idea of converting a stove to a hearth. I might, uh, steal that."

SelfSufficiency,2lzqfl,teenMom86,3,Wed Nov 12 14:32:12 2014 UTC,"John Seymour's ""Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency"" was one of the key books that nudged me along my own path to self-sufficiency. I think the biggest take-away from it is that self-sufficiency is mostly an attitude of mind: a notion that says, ""I want to do X. Let's give it a go. How hard can it be?"" (Usually it turns out that doing X involves any number of subtleties and complications that you wouldn't have thought of, but you learn and get better at it as a result of trying. Just because peasant farmers have been doing X for thousands of years doesn't necessarily make it easy or simple.)  His heirs have seen fit to piss in the soup by bringing out a ""New"" edition that imho adds no value, but at least still contains all the good how-to info he wrote. His other books on gardening, forestry, etc. are also worthwhile, but I'd look for them in a library or 2nd-hand rather than lash out too much money for them. And his self-sufficiency book is pretty comprehensive, covering everything from field crops through veggies, animals (including butchering and preserving), buildings and fences, brewing (though it won't get you a fine craft beer.) Having been on this road for several decades now, I disagree with some of his ideas and methods, but that's unimportant if they get someone started."
SelfSufficiency,2lzqfl,DocWattz,2,Sun Nov 16 08:27:55 2014 UTC,"So I must be misunderstanding your original tone then? Because my understanding is ""he's got a lot to answer for"" implies that he's caused a lot of damage, but that doesn't seem to fit."

SelfSufficiency,2lzqfl,PlantyHamchuk,3,Sun Nov 16 12:33:51 2014 UTC,"Library books. Read them before you buy them. I've a HUGE collection of books, and quite a few are just crap.   I like: Back to Basics - There's an updated version of this, but it really isn't an update as far as I'm concerned, just a re-edit. You may like the third edition updated one better, as it covers Adobe houses (better suited for Texas, no?) http://www.amazon.com/Back-Basics-Traditional-American-Skills/dp/0895770865/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1416268351&sr=1-2&keywords=Back+to+Basics  The Complete Book of Self Sufficiency - I find I open this book all the time to reference gardening stuff, as well as just homestead improvements. It's British, but they know how to do it. http://www.amazon.com/New-Complete-Book-Self-Sufficiency/dp/1405345101/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1416268500&sr=1-1&keywords=Complete+book+of+self-sufficiency  Home Repair - if you haven't fixed anything around the house (plumbing, patched walls, heating, some common electrical) I highly recommend something like this. It covers tools and their uses, and it breaks down almost everything in a home (or barn) into 'systems'. A lot of pictures. I recommend this to everyone I know that buys a house, or I give it as a house warming gift. http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-Complete-Photo-Repair/dp/1589235371/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1416268592&sr=1-5&keywords=The+Black+and+Decker+Home  One thing I'd like to say too. And this may sound like I'm being harsh, but I'm not. Don't hope to start something. Do. Yes, I'm sounding Yoda. I've found (and I'm slightly guilty of this as well, but not so much anymore) that people tend to overanalyze the crap out of everything. Just do. Start small (even a 4'x4' garden teaches you a lot) and do. You WILL make mistakes. You WILL fail sometimes. You WILL start to be successful after you make the mistakes and you WILL learn not to fail as much. The first attempt will never be pretty or go exactly as planned. If it is pretty and it goes exactly as planned, then you have spent way to much time in starting it.   Oh. And if you plan on raising any livestock, remember that they do die despite your best efforts to keep them alive. And don't invest in any sort of permanent fencing until your nearly 100% sure that you are going to be raising that animal for some years to come and your 100% HAPPY in where you are confining them. Pulse-portable fencing is the greatest invention in the history of mankind."

Despite spending a lot of time with my grandfather in his workshop being showed how to use various tools there were a lot of things I didn't know (He taught shopwork as well as physics, math, and chemistry).  That's where those little DIY guide books help.  Need to build a deck?  Get the guide for that from a couple of different sources.    Research it, plan it, buy the hand tools and rent any larger power tools you might need.  Consult handy friends.  This is important for you to know.  !!  I love being asked for my advice on things and love it even more when I'm asked to help or show somebody how to do something.   !!    I do not look down on my friends who are less handy.  It's taken me a lot of time effort and money to develop my skills and I like to give access to my skills to my friends.  So ask.  I was visiting a friend in Oregon once who was exploring a new relationship with a new girlfriend.  She wanted a little deck outside the back door where they could both sit in the morning sun on a couple of chairs.  I asked:  Do you want me to do it and you help; or, Do you want to do it and I'll show you how?  They chose the latter.  I had a lot of fun helping them build that little deck.  It was a great way to spend time with a friend and get to know her new girlfriend.  It was fun and we all had a good time.  So ask!  And ask to be shown!"

SelfSufficiency,2kecx9,AtomicPenny,6,Mon Oct 27 16:16:10 2014 UTC,"Manuals, online tutorials, and youtube are all convenient and free. If you know anyone who could lend you basic tools if you don't have any then that is good until you get your own. Even better if they'll give you some one on one instruction.  Check out the local colleges for extension classes.  A lot of basic skills are very easy, I think just jumping into it is the most daunting aspect. You may just be psyching yourself out unnecessarily.   Changing tires, oil, brakes are very easy and necessary skills. Basic plumbing like pulling the P - trap under the sink, replacing a toilet or shower head. Simple woodworking...start with a bookcase or picnic table...something to get you through the basic tools that you can use when your done.  Anything to get you familiar with the tools and concepts is awesome. Once you have the basics you can build off that to whatever level you want to.  There is no reason to feel dumb though. People get exposed to things at different points in their lives so some people will learn skills earlier, later, or not at all. I think it's great that you want to learn new things, it's a good thing to do for yourself. Don't worry about doing it for other people."
SelfSufficiency,2kecx9,Leovinus_Jones,3,Sun Oct 26 21:15:22 2014 UTC,"Its not a dumb question. There are a lot of us who grew up not knowing a lot of practical skills for whatever reason. It doesn't mean there's any shame is trying to pick them up now.  If you live in an urban center, and have the time, look up local Habitat for Humanity projects. Volunteer some of your time and pay attention to the work. Ask questions and figure out for yourself the different skills and methods that go into construction.

Youtube and Clymers manuals will walk you through the process and teach you the ins and outs of tearing a motor apart. Be careful with what you watch on youtube, I've seen tons of videos of people performing work incorrectly. The most expensive part will be the tools, the Clymer manual will tell you everything you need for a specific model. Parts for bikes can be obtained cheaply at salvage yards.  First motor I took apart was an 1986 XR80R, I managed to do so without a manual but I highly recommend them so you can have specs for many things like valve clearances, stock carburetor adjustments, and torque specs.

I've learned heaps of skills, from rust repair, to 3d video editing, brewing beer, to nice little handmade gifts for my missus. The only problem with YouTube tutorials is that they'll spend 45 minutes explaining a 5 minute job, which is really frustrating. But there's also specific forums and subreddits for most things filled with people eager to help. we're blessed to have almost all of the world's information at our fingertips, so don't be shy!  Once you've pottered around with some basic repairs you realise that most things are actually fairly straight forward. DIY is like a little puzzle that you need to figure out, and when you come up with a clever solution it gives you the warm fuzzies.  And as others have already said, definitely start putting together a toolbox. Screwdrivers, pliers, Allen keys, hammer, hacksaw, adjustable spanner, a decent socket wrench set is invaluable, especially for car repairs, a drill and bits, nails and screw's, and any other tool you need for your current project, because chances are you'll need it again sooner or later.

I've given to others as a gift. I wore out my first copy and had to buy another. It will show you tools and how to use them. It will show you how to repair many common household problems, from plumbing to electrical to installing doors and windows and patching wall holes.  I even used it to teach myself to drywall my rec room in my basement (which I've recieved many compliments on).   I've had this book in one form or another for about 8 or 9 years. I've used it to teach myself rough framing, plumbing, electrical and other things. I'm confident now, in learning things from that book, that I don't feel a small sense of panic when something breaks.

What I suggest is that you keep trying new things and don't rely on mentorship to explore details of those new things. I've learned so much from mentors, but you'll only be able to develop the confidence to try new things on the fly if you have done 'new things' enough times. You come to an acceptance that trial and error is a process and that the anxiety for not knowing can only be sated by exploring and observing and not getting things right the first time.  Also, realize you'll never know everything perfectly - and thus, no one else will either. So when you encounter some mentor who gives you anxiety, realized they don't know it all either."

Fuel isn't really an issue with miniature nuke plants (or big ones), nor is safety. It'd be more of a problem with heat and neutron radiation (spent fuel and casings).  Fissile reactions produce intense heat on the order of 3500-4300K.   For a suburban house that's way overkill. Even the smallest reactor would be putting out at least 1MW.  A mini-nuke could easily power a small town with 10,000 houses.  Rocket stoves and biogas fermenters are way better in my opinion.

I would definitely say the internet is a great starting place to learn these things but it is only the tip of the iceberg and should only be used as a stepping stone. After doing some basic research about a topic you should try and check out local hunting or fishing clubs in your area. I'm sure someone will take you under their wing if you offer to buy them beer.   You should also consider how remote you want to be from society. IMO this is one of the most important aspects because the skills that you would need in the bush are completely different from living in a secluded cabin on the outskirts of town.

You'll learn to live on basics and endure the hardships in the wilderness, and they offer full scholarships. There are also good trapping/hunting classes (in the appalachians at least) that will teach you how to not only live off the land, but live on little substinence when necessary (and there will likely be times that it's necessary)... If you're very serious, it truly is a lifelong commitment to be totally self-sufficient. The best thing I can recommend besides that are books and a mentor. Read everything you can, and make an effort to meet people who are proficient in gardening and (if you're lucky) taking care of animals. You obviously have internet access, so learn as much as you can. It takes a lot of dedication. Woodworking with hand tools and micro-agriculture will come in really, really handy.

You will not find a place where you won't have to pay for the land, except Alaska which still has squatters rights. But you probably wouldn't want to live there anyway because of the winters they have.  To build a legit house that does what you want it to (have water, electricity, heating, etc., & solar power) would probably be at least 200k.  A small (good) cabin is still going to run about 100k. You should definitely avoid cutting wood and actually legit making your own home unless you're trained in all areas needed. Placing logs to make a log cabin without the proper know-how will provide you with tons of problems later. (Of course, buying a pre-existing home or cabin would be much cheaper than building a new one).  Anyway, you might want to check out /r/tinyhouses for some ideas on small homes you could make on a budget. They also have tips sometimes about where to find the best/cheapest land.  500k is definitely not enough to live off unless you move to a developing country. And even then, it's very possible you will outlive the money.  you also need to think about just how slumming you want to slum. Do you want electricity? Do you want running water? Cabins without these cost less but are harder to maintain. At 18, you really want to think about why you hate your town so much. If it's just because it's boring, living alone in the wilderness is going to lose its luster pretty fast, especially when you start figuring out how many chores you're going to have and how much physical labor it takes just to maintain your way of life.  You might start think instead of living in a mobile home community.  edit: I started out with higher prices. Then I lowered the prices. Honestly it really depends on location.

Relatively cheap, about a month's rent plus whatever you need for food/transportation, you a learn a LOT about Earthship design and building while working on a current project they have going on, and if you're interested in furthering your knowledge there is an ""Academy"" program where you build an Earthship from the ground up!

When I was there we were finishing an Earthship so there was a lot more to do in terms of putting everything together, doing finishing touches, working on bottle walls, carpentry for windows/doorways/etc. and other design features. We definitely had our fair share of pounding tires. But that's why I mentioned the Academy program - you're working on one Earthship from start to finish the whole time and it's a lot more intensive and a lot more information than the internship. I think the internship was a good stepping stone to that, especially if you are just interested in sustainable housing in general.  Edit: But yeah, if we're putting this in basic terms the interns are there to learn but it's a lot of free labor for the company ;) still a good experience in my opinion, but you get out of it what you want to, I think it's different for everyone."

If you talk to the instructors though, you can sometimes find opportunities to round out your work experience at other sites.  (I could've got in some tire-pounding on a weekend that wasn't an official workday, but bowed out since my family had picked that weekend to come visit from out of state, and we drove down to Albuquerque)  I'm glad I stuck with the internship rather than the Academy though, since I got to see a wide variety of Earthships, and get a taste of the hard labour involved, but at a much smaller expense.

A company called Agriprotein in South Africa is performing research in conjunction with the University of Stellenboch (sp?) into using the fly larvae for low-cost waterless sanitation in the poorer parts of Africa. The fly itself never touches the manure, preferring to lay eggs nearby that crawl into or drop onto the waste, which they then eat, before crawling off the pile, burying themselves and pupating into an adult which crawls out of the chrysalis completely sterile. For this reason the adult fly, which does not eat, carries no pathogens from the waste as it never touches it.     The fly larvae is rich in protein and can be fed to chickens, fish, or reptiles after it self-harvests from the pile ready to pupate. They voraciously eat any food scraps including meat and citrus and are native to most warm places in the United States. incorporating the BSF may shorten your turnaround time and provide you with a protein source for animals."

Dissolve in dechlorinated tap water per recipe. The baking soda is key: It gives the solution a pH of 10 to 11, so basic that spirulina is about the only thing that can survive in it. That's how the colony remains pure and safe.  From Bed Bath & Beyond I bought a ~2 gallon wide-mouth glass jar with a tap, made for dispensing iced tea or lemonade.   I bought a starter culture. It comes in looking like a bottle of green smoothie. I kept on a sunny window sill until ready.  Around the bottom of the jar I put an aquarium air diffuser, the kind that's about 8 inches long and spongy, not just a airstone. It's hooked up to a aquarium air pump. I added the some solution and the culture, gradually filling the jar over a period of couple of weeks.  Initially I left it on a table near a window, but it wasn't nearly sunny enough for it. I moved it to the roof and it took off, getting dark green in a week.  I harvested twice using a coffee filter, but that's a little slow. I need something with slightly larger pores. I pour the filtered water back in the jar, rinse the spirulina with tap water, and eat off the filter.  It does best at 90 degF or so. The roof was hot enough in the summer. I added a aquarium heater just a week ago, but I messed up the temperature settings, or the heater mount location, or just didn't monitor the temperature closely enough and it got too hot. Spirulina dies at 103degF. At least that's what I think happened. A think brownish gell appeared on the bottom of the jar and the solution turned mostly clear from being mostly opaque dark green.  I took some of the slightly green solution and some healthy looking clumps out, cleaned my jar, put the salvaged culture back and hope that I can get it grown back up.

SelfSufficiency,2hu222,citybadger,6,Tue Sep 30 16:31:51 2014 UTC,"I grow algae on a research scale. The real thing is the quantity of water.   Algal density varies by strain, but a healthy dense culture will be between 300-700mg per liter of water. That is pretty good. Amazing is like 2-4g per liter which is possible...but do that math. A big mason jar is 1L so there if perfect you get 2-4 grams. Or about a tsp. In the entire jar.  I grow algae in small raceways, 2,500 liters. I can harvest about 6-7 wet kilos every three days. That's great but near impossible to keep sterile or state that it is 100%spirulina it's a great idea to use baking soda to keep the pH high preferring spirulina. But I grow lots of strains and I have at least 10 strains that will grow at 10-11 ph, so that's not foolproof.   Also nitrates are very bad for you. Salt Peter is nitrate.  It's cool overall but you can go on nuts.com and buy several dry kilos of spirulina for around 100$. I cannot fathom a cheaper source. We have pilot scale systems but still buy algae from nuts because its cheaper, and we have infrastructure already in place."
SelfSufficiency,2hu222,Umbrius,1 point,Tue Sep 30 18:39:41 2014 UTC,Where does nuts.com get their spirulina from? Someone must be making or collecting the stuff at a profit.  I've heart about raceways. What's their advantage over a plain tank? Easy to agitate?  Is it possible to grow spirulina without nitrates?  Thanks!
SelfSufficiency,2hu222,citybadger,6,Tue Sep 30 19:41:48 2014 UTC,"ok! So looking sidelong at nuts is a good idea. Its cheap. Like hard to figure out how they do it cheap. From that we have made assumptions that its probably from china, where cheaper human work and lower nutrient costs, coupled with lower regulation could do it. Nuts is food rated so its perfectly safe, but it would be doubtful that what they send you is a 100% monoculture.  Raceways! They are the most energy efficient way to grow massive quantities of algae. This is from a variety of reasons. 1. They use a single motor and paddle (typically) to move and agitate massive quantities of water. 2. Optimal growing depth. 15-19cm is the accepted most efficient depth. This allows for maximum light penetration especially in dense cultures. As well the more water you have the more energy the motor uses, so if light wont penetrate to 25cm but you fill it there then you are spending more energy for no benefit.  3. Area. Algae in the 70's and 80's was grown in large circular deep tanks like how sewage is treated. after researching what i have outlined the 15 cm deep but very long snaking path gives the most area and exposure to sun.  If you are actually going to grow spirulina at your home for consumption then a raceway is definitely overkill. You can grow it as this thing writes in a fishtank or in something home made. Honestly a big part of us growing our cultures is a stage where they are in 200L (~55gal) reactors. These are just cylinders of fiberglass sheeting and PVC pipe that we made here in the lab maybe 50$ of parts. But whatever you look at just do quick math on it. Ok so fine growth would get you to 1-2g per L of your tank. around 4L per gallon. so around 4-8 grams per gallon.  So in a 5 gallon fish tank if filled and grown fully would hold 20-40 grams of algae....not very much. maybe a few tablespoons  If you made one of the 200L ones thats going to be between 200-400g which is definitely enough to eat seriously. I dont know how much algae you can eat but I would think you need a container somewhere in between a fishtank and a barrel.  BUT Harvesting. This is really the killer in algae farming right now. In order to harvest our raceways we use a small centrifuge that seriously uses some power, and costs a ton to just buy in the first place. Filters are possible, if you are growing like a gallon at a time. For the most part filters just get clogged.  If you grow at home i recommend turning off any agitation you use (bubbling is the best for small systems) and letting the algae settle to the bottom. This is used in industry as a means of maximizing efficiency, its called gravity sedimentation. After it makes a mat on the bottom of your tank just siphon off the top water and there you have a decent harvest    Growing without nitrates is a difficult question. We all consume nitrates pretty regularly (very often if you eat processed pork). Our bodies have no natural systems to break down nitrate into products we can deal with and expel like ammonia. So they build up in our system, typically not to some dangerous level, but limiting exposure is just a good idea.   Plants actually don't use nitrate directly. They take it in and then convert it to what they want which is ammonia. You can feed algae ammonia for a nitrogen source, but the downfall is that ammonia will evaporate and then you have nutrients just disappearing.   All farming really uses nitrates most vegetables you eat were grown with nitrates either directly added or added indirectly through soil microbes. But plants take in nitrates slowly and use them as they absorb them. Algae absorb nutrients from the liquid environment they live in then grow.  So if you grew a bunch of algae in .05% nitrate then when you harvest them they will contain in their internal water nitrate. Not much, but they will have nitrate.  Will it kill you? Probably not.  Is is so bad for you that it outweighs the benefits of eating algae? Probably not again.   All I can really say on it is that I have been told by several different PhDs of organic chemistry and biochemistry that they avoid eating nitrate as much as possible, so I try and avoid it myself. Since I grow algae as a job and I weigh out pure Sodium Nitrate to add to the water. Its hard to separate nitrate from algae in my mind.   What I am super damn excited about is Aquaculture. Growing a tank of algae to be fed to fish, who poop and fertilize a hydroponic system. Eating algae is a fine idea and all but I would prefer to eat some fresh fish or shrimp with my salad greens and tomatoes. You still would be using nitrates to grow the initial algae, but they go trough so many other organisms that it would definitely limit your exposure.   Growing algae is complicated. It appears easy just mix this up and add sun! Which is true, but sometimes entire culture will just crash and die for no apparent reason. Its very very easy to grow invasive creatures like cilliates and rotifers which just eat algae and kill cultures. And of course its very very easy to think you are growing one type of algae, but if you look under the microscope it's a very different culture. Algae are very small and even if you are not in the industry like me you probably contact algae on outdoor surfaces daily. If you are growing spirulina and you touch the screen door outside then your tank water...maybe in a few weeks you will be growing screen door algae and not spirulina.  Sorry if this was rambling. I just got to work and only am half caffeinated. If you have any more questions please feel free to ask more or send me a message I will happily answer anything I can about algae. Strain questions, nutrient questions, methods."
SelfSufficiency,2hu222,Umbrius,2,Wed Oct 1 13:50:42 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that was very helpful!  Are there any really dangerous algae that can grow along side spirulina in a ph 10 culture? You make it sound like mushroom gathering - avoid unless you really know what you are doing.  I though filter clogging was a solved problem: back flow them periodically, like dishwashers do.  I suppose trying to feed algae with the ammonia in fish waste is a recipe for disaster in several ways: culture purity, different water requirements for fish and algae (spirulina especially) and, if you feed the algae to the fish, maybe too tight a food-chain loop (fish nearly eating their own waste)."
SelfSufficiency,2hu222,ArcFurnace,2,Wed Oct 1 14:44:50 2014 UTC,"There are several dangerous algae that produce toxins like mycrocystis or the dinoflagellates that cause red tide, but overall It's not as risky as mushrooms. Most of the algae that could invade easily are just going to be other cyanobacteria or regular green algae that are generally safe to consume.  In terms of what could grow alongside Spirulina I would worry about Anabaena. Its a pretty common cyano that produces a nice neurotoxin. Its unfortunate because relating to what we were talking about before with nitrate free media, Anabaena is a nitrogen fixing cyano. If grown in media with no Nitrogen source it will fix it from the air like common soil bacteria....alas its toxic. (side note it can make a great fertilizer)  There is backflowing for filters, but overall its more of a hassle than a benefit. It works well in dishwashers because normally the food that's stuck is varying in size and shape and a clog wont reform again after the backpressure. With algae they are tiny and uniform if you unclog it it will be the exact same within minutes.Though it really all depends on the volume you are growing. We are currently looking into getting these cloth bag filters that pool stores sell. They have very small pore sizes that are perfect for algae, and they are normally conical or at least tapering in shape and can operate at semi-high pressure, which somewhat solves the clogging problem.  If you go to the grocery store and go to the section that sells those premade smoothie mixtures like the naked or bolthouse farm brands. The green machine or green boost type will usually have a few types of algae in them. Normally spirulina and the super common Chlorella Vulgaris, but occationally other Chlorella varients. Most algae are just a great mix of fats, protein and carbs, each strain will have a slightly different mix of types of each. Some will also make additional products that you would want to consume like awesome anti-oxidants like Astaxanthin.   If you are considering growing look into F/2 algae food. It's sold at most large aquarium stores and sold in bulk online. Its a mix of small amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus as well all the little tiny micronutrients that algae need to live and thrive like, iron, molybdenum, calcium, zinc, copper, cobalt, boron, B12, thiamine, biotin. You mix a tiny amount, like 1 ml per 5 gallons, and add a bit of regular commercial Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer you can buy at lowes, Bam near perfect algae media.  Almost any algae will grow on it pretty well and it is the absolute cheapest source for all the nutrients that algae need.   With the aquaculture systems usually there are good filtration systems in place from the plants to the returning algae basin. Additionally the algae is grown and more dosed into the fish tank on a feeding cycle as opposed to just having a free flow between them. The fish waste is circulated through the hydroponic system to the plants then back to the spirulina. This creates a really good natural system for eliminating the waste in the water, so the fish are not really swimming in waste. Its taking how the natural world cycles nutrients in terms of ponds streams and separating the parts to maximize control and efficiency. There are issues with it, but it is super promising and there are plenty of smart people working on solutions to the issues.  Any idea about how much you were tinking about growing? We have a lot of calculations done about volume size and nutrient costs. If you have a general idea i can tell you roughly how much it will cost you per gram, so you can make the best decision.  If you don't care and just want to grow the algae, more power to you. It is really satisfying to grow a tank of something that is the color of Hi-C Slimer, and the smell is oddly comforting.

I think that's dry weight, though, and going by the numbers given by /u/Umbrius elsewhere in the thread it seems unlikely that a grow-your-own operation would be able to even produce that much.

I really like The New Self Sufficient Gardener by John Seymour for ideas on homestead and garden layout. The Resilient Farm and Homestead by Ben Falk is a worthwhile book for any location but is most useful for those in the eastern deciduous forest region. The recently published Forest Farming book by Ken Mudge and Steve Gabriel is excellent if you have a significant wood lot. Or, if you're in the more oak-savannah region (Midwest and west), Restoration Agriculture by Mark Shephard is a good place to start. Sepp Holzer's Permaculture is a terrific and inspiring read for anyone.  Planting guides will depend on where you live..

That is where you plant  multiple species of native plants  and trees that grow symbiotically and sustainably to produce food or other forest  products.  Some techniques allow you to produce food or  other commercial products while waiting for trees to mature before you cut them and sell them for timber. Some techniques allow you to make money while managing the forest to become healthier and have a more biodiverse ecosystem with old growth conditions.  Agroforestry can also  include livestock raising techniques that  use trees and underbrush to feed, reduce costs and reduce stress on livestock.  It's not a book but here is the link for the Appalachian Center for Agroforestry. if you click on the Articles and Info tab there is information  on various agroforestry farming and agroforestry livestock raising techniques particular to your area.

My problems and why I gave up on it:  Size, in order to be useful the size was to much on our boat. Always in the way or getting knocked/kicked around.  To long to cook. With the boat at anchor and swinging, we could not keep it lined up with the sun to get a good direct shot. It took for ever to cook anything.  Go with propane. It is available EVERYWHERE and cheap as hell. The amount of money I spent on the solar oven I could have kept my self in Propane for 10 years. Seriously. In El salvador, I can get my tanks filled for $12 bucks. that last for 4 or 5 months. Even cheaper in Mexico.  I would not worry about long passages. The longest you'd ever really make is in the pacific and that would only be a month at the way outside, unless you were skipping places to make longer passages.  You can buy food EVERYWHERE.

I could probably afford to pay 10x what I'm paying now for cooking fuel and get along just fine, but I like the idea of not having to. That's what this sub is about anyway. Self sufficiency.

SelfSufficiency,2cura8,mfluty,17,Thu Aug 7 04:03:54 2014 UTC,"Hi, I don't mean to be negative; but if you already have power to the house, this would be several multiples more expensive, every month, forever.  You will be paying more to make the electricity using a gas generator than it will cost you from the utility.  You'll then waste a measurable amount of it by charging batteries with it, along with losses in the wiring (small) and inverter (not so small).  And, for an entire house, this could easily be a five-figure investment in just batteries; and the cabling and connectors add up fast. You could perhaps pull it off for less than that using off-the-shelf marine batteries; but you will need to replace them all every few years which will certainly be thousands.  And you're going to need a bigger jenny."
SelfSufficiency,2cura8,Reasonably,12,Thu Aug 7 05:39:02 2014 UTC,"The only real way to cost effectively use an off-grid battery system would be to integrate it with a solar system- this would allow you charge your batteries at no charge. A complete off-grid battery systems cost cost however is prohibitive- not for the solar system, but for the battery bank itself.   The issue with this is not in the cost of solar- a typical solar system in an incentive US state pays back in 5-7 years, depending on your usage and tax appetite.  In a state without incentives where you would only be receiving a 30% federal tax credit the return is closer to the 10-12 year mark.  Obviously the return figures are based on electricity prices- the high the cost of electric rises, the quicker your payback would be.  Some areas have municipal power generation, which means electricity is still very cheap, and solar simply cannot cover its cost when your only paying $.06 total for the supply and delivery of your electricity.   If you have a 100% electrical offset solar system, your electric bill would only be the monthly service charge, which is anywhere from $10-30 per month, depending on your area. THIS IS THE REASON A BATTERY BANK IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE. Lets call the high mark of a service charge $360 per year. A small(er) battery bank for about a week's worth or usage would cost around $10,000.  This battery bank would be used every day, every night, all year.  Those batteries would need to be replaced, and would not last the 29 year financial payback period that eating a grid ""service charge"" would equate to.   That being said, there is a situation where an off-grid battery system would work like your referring to- and that would be on a property that does not currently have power running to it from the utility company.  Typically the cost to run power can range from $5,000 to $30,000 depending on where you are and how long the power lines would need to be extended.  In that situation, it would be more affordable to have an off-grid solar system charging a battery bank, as the additional cost of a battery system would only be $10,000 for approximately a week of average use, and closer to $30,000 for 3 weeks of use.    Its imperative to size the battery bank accordingly in a northern climate, because you are hedging against the weather during December, January, and February.  A 3 week period of clouds and snow could seriously deplete your battery reserves, and without a back-up generator you could literally be caught out in the cold.   There are alternatives to the high cost, high capacity battery bank systems-  but useful more for power outage situations that for daily power supply.  This would be a situation where a small battery bank $3,000 is installed next to a generator. The bank would last a couple days in the event of a power outage, and if it depletes, the generator picks up the slack. This is a convenience upgrade more applicable to areas prone to outages, and in many cases the fuel cost savings of just having a generator is offset by the battery bank being charged by the solar, for free.   tl/dr  batteries only make financial sense if your home is off-grid currently, and the cost to run electric to the property is high enough to justify spending that amount on a battery bank.  Solar pays for itself quickly with incentives, and works well in that situation.   Source- Its my job!"
SelfSufficiency,2cura8,silentguardian,4,Thu Aug 7 17:01:38 2014 UTC,"Covered most everything I was going to say, bar a few exceptions:   It is possible to go completely off-grid with 4kWh of battery power, but don't expect to be able to use any electric cooking/heating devices and no more gaming PC. Probably time to buy a new fridge as well. Amortization works out roughly grid equivalent where I am (Australia - 26c/kWh).  A week's worth of backup power is a little overkill. If you have a generator that's capable of delivering a decent whack of current, you should be able to whack 40-50A into that battery bank. Even on overcast days, if you've got enough solar, your system should be at a decent SoC - run the generator in the evening for an hour or so during dinner/evening peak load, which should keep your batteries at a high SoC for evening. Come 7-8am the next morning, you should be bulk charging :). Wind is so ridiculously cheap now. It's worth whacking 300-500W worth of wind around somewhere. Even those little breezes at night which generate 20-50W is enough to top off any consumption for LED lighting or refrigeration. It won't power the whole house (unless you live in a windy area!) but it's something when there's usually nothing :)"

Wind as your only source of energy is lunacy - it is not predictable enough to be relied on as a consistent source of power, unless you're in a consistently windy area (which do exist). It does have the advantage of working at night - if you think of it was a way to top of your batteries at night, rather than a primary source of power, it makes a lot more sense.  eBay is a great place to pick up wind turbines for next to nothing. There are a few ways to mount wind towers which make them easier to service. Newer turbines are a lot better thought out compared to older generation turbines (just like solar)."

It's going to be one of the most expensive options available to you, even with a large diesel generator.  If you have access to wind and solar you can run your house on an off grid battery bank, which will still be fairly expensive initially.

SelfSufficiency,2cura8,akohlsmith,3,Thu Aug 7 10:34:13 2014 UTC,"This. You want to run as absolutely little as possible off of the inverter. Any time you're converting from one voltage to another, or from DC to AC, you take an efficiency hit. It can be a small hit or a big hit depending on the technology and what you're using, but avoid it.   Since you're trying to limit energy use you want to maximize efficiency in all your loads, too. Start by really taking a serious look at what you have to use electricity for and cut out as much as possible. After that, you can now start looking for the most efficient device for each task, 12VDC first, then 120/240VAC if necessary. Don't use electricity where a better energy source might exist (gravity, solar heat, etc.)  Once you've got your loads down you can start figuring out what must be on most/all of the time and what is more ""volatile"" and determine your base and peak loads. Take into account any motors and their power factors, which drops efficiency. From there you can see what kind of solar panels and battery you'll need and know how long it'll take to charge the batteries and how long you can expect to run on a charge.   Remember that if your base load is 100A, you don't want to buy and wire for 100A; you want wiggle room. Without knowing your peak load and how long/often those peaks are it's hard to give you a rule of thumb about how much wiggle room to account for. Unless specifically stated otherwise, electronics run at their rating tend to get pretty warm and wear out faster.   Don't forget to include maintenance costs in the generator/inverter and batteries. They wear down and will eventually fail.   Source: worked in the power electronics industry for 13 years."

SelfSufficiency,2cura8,OmicronNine,1 point,Thu Aug 7 20:32:09 2014 UTC,"Getting a battery bank as a backup to grid power might make sense depending on your situation, but unless you invest in a good source of cheap power such as solar, wind, and/or micro-hydro, you'll only be throwing away money for no reason by going off grid with nothing but a generator.  What problem are you trying to solve here?  Are you just trying to get more reliable power? Get a battery bank and combination inverter/charger system (Outback makes well regarded ones) properly installed with a cut-over switch. The batteries are kept charged with the grid power, and when a storm takes it out you can hit the cut-over switch and power yourself off the battery bank until grid power is back. You can even take the additional step of a house scale UPS, but that'll be crazy expensive and probably unnecessary. Hell, even a battery bank is probably unnecessary compared to just a generator if power outages are rare. Still, the battery bank system makes it easy to add solar/wind and possibly transition to off grid if you want to.  Is being totally off grid your actual goal? In that case, you need to look in to solar and wind generation, and if you have year round running water on your property look in to micro-hydro. Worry about how you are going to get power at a reasonable cost first, then determine your battery bank needs based on that. A generator is your worst option here, all that fuel is far too expensive."

The first steps you should take is to limit your energy usage in the mean time.  There's the obvious choice of CFL lights over incandescent.   My house I have skylights in the bathrooms.  And I'm also a big fan of using a clothes line to hang laundry rather than using a dryer whenever possible.  Once you've got that squared away good.  Then start looking at DC stuff.  If you can get DC powered things such as lighting, it will work out better for you if you're trying to run on battery as you avoid the efficiency losses of an inverter.

I am planning on putting one of these up when I get land somewhere to produce the bulk of my fresh produce.

SelfSufficiency,2byzhg,planza,1 point,Tue Jul 29 13:02:15 2014 UTC,"50 lbs of the hydro nutes + 50 lbs of the calcium supplement last between 4-6 weeks. We use captured rainwater for irrigation (well, municipal water while we work out a couple of kinks with our rainwater irrigation booster pump setup), and are using solar to power everything. I think that the fertilizer is $60-100 (can't find the price list on the vertigro site). Depending upon the season, planting, etc, we can easily produce a few hundred pounds of harvest from the greenhouse.   We eat all the fresh produce that we want and sell the rest at local farmers markets. This covers all of our expenses and makes us a nice little profit (enough to manage operating costs and to save up a little for unexpected expenses). All of our startup costs and infrastructure were paid by grant money, but I think that the total startup cost (greenhouse, hydro system, plant medium, seeds, tools, etc etc etc) was just under 40k.  tl;dr; You come out way ahead with this system. The value of your production greatly exceeds your costs.   PM me and I can send you a link to my organization's fb page so that you can check out the greenhouse setup and all of that."

They grow tall and you just pick off one or two leaves at a time, so they're a great emergency food when there's nothing else around.  I use the leaves either for soup or to make 'wraps.'.  Also, pick the flower buds as broccoli - if you don't they tend to die, so you get a double whammy from these things.  PM me your address and I'll get some in the post to you.  I might be able to spare you a few pumpkin seeds too - about to break open the first Crown Prince of the year today so if the seeds look good I'll stick them in the envelope too.  Pumpkins are useful as they store well for the winter, plus you can roast the seeds (oil - you're going to be short on oil in you diet) and can even eat the leaves, though I've never actually tried them.    One thing I've learned about 'self-sufficiency' is that you're never alone.  When I moved into my place in Portugal, everyone raided their garden and gave me seeds, plants, surplus veggies and access to their fruit trees when they couldn't harvest enough.

Costs $18, filters 100,000 gallons (you'll probably never go through that much), filters down to 0.1 micron, can be used in multiple ways- filter straw, gravity filter, inline filter, bottle filter.  There's nothing else on the market at the moment that comes close to competing with the Sawyer filters."

Where I'm planning to have land doesn't get below freezing too often, but all it takes is once to ruin the entire system :/.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to dig a cistern at all either, hmm.

You may want to try to increase the diversity of the forage by adding in some legume, such as clover, alfalfa, vetch.

Some plants can fixate air nitrogen (via symbiotic bacteria living in root nodules), so you might want to introduce some of them in your rotation.  You should collect your manure and compost in general and after it's biodegraded you need bring it out into the fields again to close the material flow loops. You've got chickenshit and sheep manure enough I guess.  If there are algal blooms in the lakes nearby you might want to fish them out and put them on your manure heap.  You should contact a soil specialist in your area, and you might want to do a soil analysis to figure out which nutrients are depleted instead of flying blind. Alternatively, you can experiment on select plots by introducing different types of fertilizer (it can be nonnatural as you're only doing it to diagnose your situation). My guess that you would be able to catch almost all of it with rock meal, nitrogen fixating legumes and manure, maybe with a touch of extra phosphate.

Some of the energy of the seed is lost due to the seed growth. 3. Possibly more of the energy is available to the chicken in and easier to metabolise form due to starch conversion.  I think a better idea would be to sow some of that seed into any spare plots. Let them grow and come to head. Introduce chickens.

Also:     while I've not done one yet, I've looked through scores of potato tower reviews, and there is a thorough inconsistancy in their effectiveness.  a significant quantity of them have little to no increase in their production.  a lot of them just end up being wasted effort.

Until then, I'm going with my gut, and the gut says that anything that prolifically emits noxious fumes as does a tire, will readily contaminate it's nearby environment.

SelfSufficiency,2aip08,Scottmk4,2,Sun Jul 13 13:41:59 2014 UTC,"An off the grid solar system is fantastically expensive,   ""Fantastically"" is hyperbole, but regardless, it's still far less expensive then running a diesel generator that whole time.   ...and it needs new batteries pretty regularly.   Every 1-2 decades or so is not unusual. A diesel generator, on the other hand, will need fuel refills, oil, parts, etc... pretty much constantly.   A grid tie system won't do you any good in an emergency.   Depends on how it is connected. A simple cut-over switch can be included to allow you to disconnect from the grid and run off your own panels if you like, and it can be paired with a smaller ""emergencies only"" battery system for such times if you feel the need. This is not excessively expensive or difficult, it's just that most people don't bother because their power is more then reliable enough."

SelfSufficiency,2aip08,bbqroast,1 point,Sun Jul 13 23:31:02 2014 UTC,"I am no expert, but i believe solar panels have a tendency to reduce effectiveness/degrade as time goes on. i dont think a properly maintained solar panel will have a life-time more than a properly maintained generator, and the sad fact of the matter is where a bad jenny can be tinkered with, a defunct panel is basically scrap, and you would have to install new panels to stay off grid. somebody correct me?"
SelfSufficiency,2aip08,imakedookie,1 point,Thu Oct 30 01:30:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah this sounds correct. The panels are solid state electronics so it's possible they can be maintained for indefinite periods with proper maintenance, although it's also possible that they will degrade no matter what you do.  A generator on the other hand, especially one designed for simplicity, can be maintained properly and even repaired if necessary.   That being said, I don't think it's truly possible to be ""off grid"" - in terms of not connecting to anyone - and still maintain things like electrical power. If you could then it would be by simply stockpiling enough stuff that your resources are likely to out live you."

You can either mount the batteries on the trailer (well insulated if you have cold winters or hot summers) or you can put the batteries in your basement but you'll want a heavy guage wire to make the link which is expensive. You can't wire it into the house wiring with out an extensive retrofit for a grid tie inverter so you are stuck with using inverters and extension cords.

If she's not paying for city water, then she isn't paying for sewer costs either (which she was using).  A rather important point that the article completely leaves out.

Go buy a plot of land out in the country, do whatever the fuck you want, barely anybody will give 2 shits about your off-grid lifestyle. ""The Evil Corporations"" won't be coming after you.  But buying a .1 acre lot on Second St in the middle of a village and expecting to cut all ties with the grid, grow a ""food forest"", raise 100 chickens and compost your own humanure on site isn't going to cut it.  There are sooooo many things wrong with that.  You must abide by your state and local ordinance laws and be respectful of your neighbors, or you will suffer the consequences.

SelfSufficiency,28tk6v,illPoff,12,Mon Jun 23 00:40:27 2014 UTC,"I continue to learn, but the basic gist remains the same. Where I am, land is cheaper than in other places in the country... but that's because it's not quite as livable as elsewhere. But you need land, and you need tens or hundreds of acres. What's land cost where you want to try this?  It'll need a well. That's $20-50k most places. You'll need a home on it, how much can you build that for? And you know that depending on your lifestyle habits you're going to need $30,000 or $40,000 just for the PV.  You could easily spend $2 million. You could get by with less.   I don't remember the post you're talking about (I've made more than a few). I'm leaning towards no septic tank at all. You can buy what they call ""urine diverting toilets"" where the pee goes out a different pipe than the poop. Send that directly to a irrigation system of some sort. Urine's sterile after all, so there aren't any serious sanitation concerns.  And as for the solids, there are incinerating units, that burn it down to ash. You have to empty them 2 or 3 times a year. I've not seen one demonstrated though, and I do think there may be concerns with odor.   This reduces your water usage significantly and without doing that crackpot ""humanure"" stuff. Nor do you have to worry about paying someone to empty the septic tank every few years.  And of course, all drainage from your sinks, showers, and other basins would go directly to irrigation (typical dish/laundry soaps wouldn't be a big deal)."

Wood's not as easy to grow here as it is in other places, but I think I can get some decent maple and oak and a few other hardwoods for lumber, and pine if I want that. Think about how many board-feet I really need, I'm not supplying a furniture factory, just enough for the needs of 3 or 4 families of people.  Of course, it's slow growing, so in a given 25 year period, I'll only get enough those last few years. I can only claim the 50% sufficieny if averaged over the whole time.

If I had a pull-behind combine with the tractor to pull it, harvesting my family's wheat will take less than 3 hours per year. We only need hundreds of pounds, not thousands.  How much cotton do I need? Again, not more than a few hundred pounds, and even that will leave much excess to be sold/traded. Maybe to pay that property tax others are worried about.

Some compost in place and you never have to handle it. You just shit into a pit, compost in the pit, and plant a fruit or nut tree in it when done, then move your shit shack over and repeat. Plant 4 trees a year, and you never have to handle anything.  Another option is to shit in a bucket, and to have multiple bins in which it ages, after a year or two wait, the compost is ready and nothing about it is shitty. You can run a vermiculture system in the second or third year as well, and really there is nothing unsanitary about the system at all.

I will happily answer any questions you have.  As for the concept of growing algae at home for fuel, it is realistically improbable. So the article you linked had some good information on algae. Like that they can have 20-40% weight in oil that can relatively easily be turned into traditional fuels. But algae don't weigh very much. I get in my growth reactors a few grams per liter of water (and nutrients).  This means that the 20-40% oil is only maybe 1-2 grams of oil per liter of water. A medium fish tank would hold maybe 15 liters. That would mean densely you could get 20-30 mL of oil, much less of fuel. Add on top of that that extracting just the oil is not the simplest of procedures. Hydrothermal liquefaction is a new and very promising addition to oil extraction, but traditionally you need solvents that are kinda dangerous like chloroform, petroleum ether, or hexane.   To get enough to really produce oil you need lots and lots of open space to put shallow troughs of water, tons of water, about 30-40k gallon, and some large industrial facilities use much more.  That takes acres of land. Not to mention the harvesting which is one of the more costly and energy wasteful parts of algae production.  Then add nutrient costs and the relative need for sterility.   Algae on an industrial level has come a long way. Some companies are now using algae to make ethanol. One company out of Florida recently claimed to be able to produce a gallon of algae gasoline for the pumps for a little less than 3.00$, but in terms of home production its a little uneconomical due to the space requirements and water needs."

Our operation is not the largest, like in Texas or Arizona, but were more focused on total reduction in production costs of growing algae. Mostly through using waste sources as feedstock.   Say you have a factory producing carpet, or beer, or snack cakes, or really just about anything. You will have waste water that must be treated before you can dump it. Normally its a matter of chemical treatments or holding tanks, but what if we took your waste water and you grew algae that you can take and either digest for natural gas or to pellet into biochar to burn. Either way you can power or heat part of your factory with the algae results, additionally the waste water was treated without harsh expensive chemicals.   You get clean waste and free power/heating.

SelfSufficiency,241915,haole1,16,Sat Apr 26 18:22:21 2014 UTC,I'd recommend rice and beans.  They're pretty cheap and you can inexpensively store them for 30 years (if that's your thing).  I bought about 100 lbs. of rice for $65 and 125 lbs. of pinto beans for $100 at costco.  The mylar bags with O2 absorbers were $25 and the buckets at Lowe's are about $50.
SelfSufficiency,241915,domesticatedprimate,6,Sat Apr 26 15:42:10 2014 UTC,"I would go with lentils over beans. They take less time to cook, so less fuel and water needed in an emergency. Lentil sprouts are also delicious.    Brown rice is better for your health, but doesn't store as well for long periods (IIRC, 6 months)."
SelfSufficiency,241915,daphnetree,3,Sun Apr 27 00:41:46 2014 UTC,"The best rice to store long period is actually un-hulled rice, but then you would need a huller available when you actually wanted to eat it. Un-hulled and stored correctly, it can last years.  Brown rice can refer to two different things. The most common brown rice is simply unpolished, but hulled, white rice. This type lasts much longer than polished rice of the same variety. White rice is basically just brown rice with the outer layer polished off, so obviously that is going to expose the bulk of the rice kernels to the elements, allowing the rice to acidify quicker and lose flavor.  So the flavor of white (polished) rice does in fact go off pretty fast. If stored very carefully, it can still be edible for a long time, but just won't taste as good.  Of course, rice dishes in the west typically flavor the rice, so that degradation of flavor isn't as noticeable. In Japan, the rice is eaten plain along with other dishes, so the flavor is very important to consumers here.  The ideal storage of rice is in a temperature and humidity controlled environment. Here in Japan, farmers have special refrigerators for the purpose.  When storing without that kind of gear, you can get special bags that let air out but not back in, and you put the rice in there with a desiccant. That keeps it tasty for a year or more, and probably edible for much longer than that.  When brown rice refers to something like wild rice that is brown in color even when polished, then the time frames and precautions might be different.  Source: I grow my own short grain rice and always have about a year's worth (for two) on hand at any given time, stored as hulled but unpolished brown rice. We have a small electric polisher that would run off of solar batteries in a pinch, but the brown rice cooks fine as well, just requiring a bit more water and time for steaming."
SelfSufficiency,241915,NoMoreNicksLeft,5,Sun Apr 27 09:29:08 2014 UTC,"Best food to stock is what you eat now so you can rotate, like rice and beans, but don't forget what you will need to season them and add nutrition.

It also varies between scrappers, depending on what stockpiles they are trying to build, how clean and pure your scrap is or whether they are after particular grades of metal.  I would ring around for some current prices once a week for a couple of months, and stockpile metal yourself in the mean time."

SelfSufficiency,23efm3,samsc2,3,Sat Apr 19 00:26:01 2014 UTC,"I'm no expert on this, but I did work on a micro-hydro project in a similar vein. The motors will usually have diode in them that stop them running in reverse. Your best bet is to use an old car alternator, working ones can be picked up from scrapyards for around £30 in the UK, don't know about US.   The problem with both electric motors and car alternators is that they require high a high RPM to generate much power. Obviously it will be different for different size motors, but for an alternator you need to be hitting at least 1500RPM, possibly more, think the level a car would idle at. You can't cycle that fast, so you need some sort of a gearing system. It will need to be pretty robust to hold up to the stresses. I ended up using an old bicycle wheel rim with a serpentine belt from an old car hooked up the the alternator. Added an extra wheel into the loop acting as a tensioner and set the whole thing in a frame made from 2x4 inch timber.   These expensive generators you can buy off ebay which are designed for these sort of projects are really good, and work well at low RPM because they have huge magnets inside. But they're really quite expensive.  The build I did was a high school project in my penultimate year. I came across problems with the alternator, as they're effectively closed units and its hard to tinker with them, plus my water flow was extremely variable. I didn't have an over-flow system so one flood came down and destroyed my aqueduct system. But yeah, I didn't need my more than high school level physics/electronics to understand how to put the electronics together.  Also, if you want to make power off it, you're gonna need a rectifier, to convert from AC to DC and a battery bank. This is a whole other kettle of fish but I'd be glad to answer any questions, and I'm sure theres plenty online explaining it better than me."

Now, we need to put in inefficiencies if we're powering things. This site suggests 67.5% loss from pedal to battery, which makes sense to me. And batteries lose some power too. Which means that we get around 30% of our power to be useful.  So... 45 W useful power. I'm just going to stop here, read the article above, and here."

I'm actually a woman, but hubby n I don't want kids yet (if ever). I was at the gyno once, and the doc told me this long and detailed story about a woman he treated, and I will spare you the details. He couldn't figure out what was wrong with her - did 6 months worth of testing and couldn't find the answer to her issue. That is, until one day he asked her what she uses for lube during sex, and he said she told him ""WD-40"".   Then he looked me dead in the eye and said ""Make sure your lube is water soluble"". I have never used anything else. So honestly, I understand warning someone not to use Saran wrap. ;)  Edit: any better brand recommendations?  edit 2: this is all they have for non latex condom :( http://www.condomdepot.com/product/catalog.cfm/nid/209"

There was another brand they used to have that was excellent, but it was kind of a specialty brand, not one you'd find in the store, and I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. Sorry I can't be more help, I'll try to find the name of that brand in my old emails.

I suspect that won't go over well. From this article it sounds like she is a scammer and she has been able to Drag some well meaning caring people into her attempt to get something for nothing.

City water and sewer was promised within a year or two and that was several years ago. On top of that the roads around our houses were beyond horrible and borderline dangerous from the huge potholes. They finally paved them last month after giving us the run around for 3 years. On top of that code enforcement was borderline harassing us for minor stuff. We even had to make a tenant move who had the second nicest house in a 3 block area because he had a very nice truck that code said was commercial.

SelfSufficiency,236jz9,JamesDome,23,Wed Apr 16 14:10:55 2014 UTC,"""Go to college to figure out why.""  Great journalistic explanation.  Like the author, I too, spent time in Iraq.  I also did two tours in Afghanistan.  And I can say that we used containers as shelters very regularly.  The few I saw buried seemed to be doing just fine.  The author seems to very heavily question the structural integrity of shipping containers with some very condescending and generally vague points.    First off, shipping containers have been used as underground greenhouses for Canadian pot-growers (and some American) for the last thirty years.  Why?  They're cheap and they work great.  They don't collapse on a dime.  Covered with a layer of gravel and soil, you'd need to run a bulldozer over them to truly compromise the structural integrity.  Rather than go through the extensive list of fallacies the author uses to attack the usage of shipping containers, I would recommend instead looking at ways you can use them more effectively.    Acidic/caustic soil?  Place a layer of thick plastic tarp (or similar plastic barrier) around the outer shell.  Steel reacts to acid and bases but the type of corrugated steel most shipping containers are made of are resistant to acidic and basic water (they cross the sea, often times exposed to open salty air, acidic rain, and stacked high).  But let's talk about longevity.  Obviously, this steel will eventually corrode.  That's why we insulate with thick plastic tarp - the kind you would line the bottom of your pool.  That adds some lifecycle to your container surviving the elements.    OP got his reference for ""cubic yard of soil"" weight approximation from   http://www.ask.com/question/weight-of-a-cubic-yard-of-coal.  OP literally used the first or second search listing.  A lot of factors go into soil weight and how that affects structural integrity of the shipping container.  Saying your soil weighs approximately 75-100 pounds, by itself, as a statement, is inaccurate unless you've measured a cubic yard of your soil (after baking it to remove water content).  Is soil heavy?  Yes.  But you're going to take measures to distribute that weight effectively.  How wet is the soil?  Water adds weight and burden.  This can be alleviated by creating a leeching field-type system around the shell to distribute water downhill.  Remember, water goes the path of least resistance.  Create that path and the soil has a place to drain.  A good method of doing this is surrounding the hull with gravel and then a water catch basin that feeds to a conduit that moves the water downhill into a semi-permeable basin made of either gravel or whatever has pockets that allow the water to matriculate through.  This conduit could potentially clog after time depending on *your** soil conditions.  A good recommendation is to have the conduit feed to an exposed downhill surface so it can be maintained and cleaned with a roto-rooter.  This isn't absolutely required but certainly you are, again, adding years to the lifecycle of your container.    *Hey, you know what?  If you're going to mess around with gravel and plumbing - go the extra step and give your container some.  It's always a good idea to have an ""out"" pipe.    *While you're at it - are you buying your container under a yard of soil?  Why not include an air vent?  Does this alter the structural integrity of your container as a whole?  Yes.  Yes it does.  But that's okay because you're taking steps to rectify that.    If the shipping container is buried flush, the force of the mass of the soil should be evenly distributed atop of it.  If you buried your structure with a gravel shell, you'll further mitigate the lateral effect of soil force against the walls because water has somewhere to drain.  *To refute the article - lateral pressure isn't your primary concern... Unless you live in a seismically active area.  Then it is.**    *Figure out how to reinforce the area of the structure that is exposed to that extra force.  A good solution to this?  Lolly columns.  You can run them along the center line of the container and still have room to move around.  If you're really worried about the unit caving in, this is a good consideration.  You can use planks to distribute the counter-force of the lolly columns across the ceiling of your storage container.  If you're worried about lateral pressure, you may want to position a few horizontally (make sure to vertically support these columns).    Will this reduce your overall volume and encumber some of your movement?  That's where YOU come in.  You need to plan this out and make decisions that suit you best.    *The only thing I'll agree with this article is that if you make any modifications to the hull, you are compromising the structural integrity of the container as a whole."

We live up near Yellowknife, NWT, and even though we have a solar power system, in the winter we get so few hours of sunlight that we really have to watch our small appliance usage unless we want to run the generator.   And though we pump our water up from the lake, it's a time-consuming process, especially in the winter. We have to heat up an antifreeze line, that then heats up the pipe from the lake, and then run our generator to run the pump and fill the tank. So we're careful with our water consumption.   In the summer, when we have close to 24 hours of sunlight, we can toast, microwave, and use the Tassimo to our hearts' content!

In case you don't know (my husband hadn't heard of these), this is when you have a real toilet inside, but line the bowl with a black garbage bag. When the bag is full (or stinky) you take it out. The Yellowknife dump here even has a special area to dispose of your honey bucket contents."

SelfSufficiency,22zl16,SoccerGuy420,1 point,Mon Apr 14 21:29:04 2014 UTC,I thought this was going to be about using solar panels and collecting water in cisterns. I is disappoint.
SelfSufficiency,22zl16,CultureofInsanity,0,Tue Apr 15 13:11:11 2014 UTC,"""These will be more useful skills than killing dragons""  Sounds like my grandmother... I think we greatly under-value the importance of staying up to date with technology. Everything is about to be automated, knowing how to code is about to be as important of a second language as english is, and the skills devellopped through video-games (hand-eye cordination, reflexes, precision, focused attention) are the ones that will be needed in the future, rather than knowledge or the ability to build stuff.   I think the last thing one should want in this day and age is to de-familiarize himself with technology. This whole article has a bit too much of a ""go back to simpler times"" attitude I think. Most of the things listed there could be powered by a solar panel setup quite easily (especially the ones coming up in a few years, they're getting extremely efficient)  Avoiding waste and using the proper and most efficient sources of energy/water/etc. is the important part, not downgrading our lifestyle"
