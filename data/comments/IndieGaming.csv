IndieGaming,3e3vgy,Valar05,2,Tue Jul 21 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Skullgirls? They've virtually fixed this issue. The only motions you ever have to do are quarter circles, dragonpunches, and simple down-up or back-front charge moves. The single exception being Cerebella's Showstopper super which is a 360. No half circles, no double quarter circles, no bizarre charge motions. And in terms of pressing buttons, you never have to press more than 2 buttons to do any input. Supers, tags, assist attacks, snapbacks, pushblocks - they're all two buttons max.  It also includes some extra hidden tech to help make inputs more forgiving. For example, Cerebella's Showstopper has a 360 detection system in which the game is able to tell when you're trying to do a 360 motion and it will keep your character from jumping, making it much less of a hassle to execute.  I'm curious to hear the specifics of this game's input systems. But I'm having trouble imagining how they can make a game even close to the complexity of SF or SG without at least quarter circles. You can only assign so many moves to single directions and buttons without having them start conflicting with the movement."
IndieGaming,3e3vgy,Kuroonehalf,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"Beowulf also has a 360. And the taunts are crazy inputs. As is Squigly's hidden super. Which is useless, so... Yeah. No meaningful weird inputs :)   In response to your last paragraph, command normals? Sort of a Smash approach. Or even look at something like Injustice. That's playable without any specials, and what specials there are have simple inputs. Plus just uses a button for meter burn."

All that really delicate fiddly stuff like short-hops, walking, tilt vs smash, DACUS, wave-dash, etc is just a different kind of frustrating.

I'm surprised this piece talks more about large companies opening up to indie developers more than it discusses marketing towards indie gamers. Marketing and social media both pushed very strongly towards indie products and consumers really opened up to that.

The game looks fantastic and I love the concept of putting on a show for a crowd of intergalactic specimens with sponsors and everything. I have a few questions about the project:   The ""please the crowd"" concept sounds like a lot of fun. Does the character need to pull off unique tricks in order to get support? Use a variety of guns? Just survive? Will backers be given a steam copy of the game, a DRM-free copy, or both?   Thanks for being here to answer our questions."
IndieGaming,3dz3i1,FeaturingPitbull,3,Mon Jul 20 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"Hi Pitbull! Thanks a lot for the love :)   The ""please the crowd"" is a core mechanic. Right now, in the demo, it is still very simple. Kill enemies to please the crowd and have them throw guns to help you; run around aimlessly or stall and they get bored. In the future, the crowd will be a lot smarter: it will get excited with risky dodges, cheap tricks and context based actions. It will also get angry with you instead of just bored, and start throwing food at you - which you can then pick up and throw at an enemy to make them cheer for you again!; We're still looking into this more carefully, but I can assure you that the game will be DRM Free even if it is redeemable on Steam (you can pull it out of your Steam library and play standalone). It is likely that we will give our backers the choice between Steam, DRM Free copies or even keys for any digital marketplace we get into :)"

IndieGaming,3dw03m,Gamingtao,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"The biggest one is most definitely having leaderboards but not having replays. Oh hey, I optimized my run the best I could and I'm still in 24th place. How did these guys manage to do it 13 seconds faster? No one will ever know. It completely strips the motivation to compete right out of the game. It also deligitimizes runs since you don't even know if they're legit and not hacked or tool assisted, because you can't see them. After playing Dustforce I just can't go back to these nonsense ranking systems.  Another big problem I had with it was how reliant it was on tight timing / raw difficulty over complexity. There's a part where they introduce this obstacle where they throw water balloons in the air. They're triggered to fire by proximity, and if they hit the ground they cause a fail state and immediately restart the level, so you have to shoot them while they're airborne. The problem is they start going ham with this, expecting you to weave these really tight shots from afar, which are already hard by nature because you can't tell depth properly in a 3D games, and because your arrows have a certain travel speed, so you have to predict when your arrow will intercept the balloon's flight path correctly, and do this like 3 or 4 times in a row in one go. It's just a real pain and not enjoyable to do.  While at it, I also disliked the regular enemies that shot at you. They aren't as aggravating as the balloons because they don't have timed fail states, but a lot of runs were a pain to optimize because you had to almost point-blank these guys and you're always teetering on the edge of getting shot before you pull your trigger.  Lastly, I have an issue with ambiguous scoring parameters. In order to get a ""perfect"" score of 3 stars, you need to beat a given level while killing all the enemies, wasting no arrows (meaning every arrow you shoot has to kill an enemy. If one whiffs you don't get the star), and doing it within a certain amount of time. The first two are fine, since the first makes sense and the second one, even though you don't look at a lot of the shots connecting, you have audio cues to tell you if they landed or not. The third one is the problem. The game just does not tell you what you need to be aiming for. Every level has this arbitrarily defined ""good"" time that you need to beat to get that star. It's bad enough that it's completely arbitrary, but the fact that it isn't even listed, or have a visual or audio cue, sucks.  If you're looking to make a similar game, I suggest you play and study the stuff that Lovely Planet does, both for the good and the bad. For a quick idea of how it plays, this video does a good job of it.  ps: Also related to leaderboards, it annoyed me immensely how it didn't show my spot on the boards right away by default. You only had to press one or two buttons to get to your time, but it's one or two buttons too much, that you have to repeat every single time you finish a level. Once again Dustforce has already solved this problem, which is to show both the top scores and the scores in your rank's vicinity on the same screen when you finish a level, without needing to press any buttons."

IndieGaming,3dw03m,SergeantIndie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:33:45 2015 UTC,"Hello Developer here.  I think the closest we can be compared to is DeadCore yes. However there are a few differences. I will list the quick ones off the top of my head (but note that we were in development for a long time and had DeadCore pointed out to us at SXSW and we were already far in development).   Competitive leaderboard is a major focus of the game. It is meant to compete with your friends and the world. We focus a lot of short very skill based trials. So far the longest level (if you get higher than a bronze medal) is 40-50 seconds. Physics. In DeadCore you have a lot more control over movement even in midair. In APT part of the game is learning movement in a more physics based environment. So planning your jumps is a huge part of it.   That is what I have gotten from watching let's plays of DeadCore, but I didn't want to look at it too much so I don't pick up something from them on accident and claim it as our own."
IndieGaming,3dw03m,Gamingtao,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:41:16 2015 UTC,"I wasn't claiming you were copying, just looking for a USP :)   Sounds like you're aiming for similar notes to DustForce then. I'm still not sold on it, but fair enough, probably just not my thing."
IndieGaming,3dw03m,demise002,2,Mon Jul 20 09:08:29 2015 UTC,Sorry if it came off like I thought you were accusing us of copying.   But yeah the quick USP is basically a game you can pick up while waiting in queue for another game and give a try at some best times. While still having more depth to it as something you should practice at to get good.  While taking it to conventions we have kind of seen this either is a game you really like or a game that really isn't your thing. There is very few in-between.
IndieGaming,3dwo3a,Fakedice,6,Mon Jul 20 03:52:27 2015 UTC,I'm not a developer but it would be smart to send it out near completion so there won't be as many bugs and makes your game look fun. You want it to be great looking while they stream it so people are tempted to get it
IndieGaming,3dwo3a,lakilla21,3,Mon Jul 20 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"Good to know.  So I guess ""Start promoting your game as early as you can"" thing doesn't apply here?"
IndieGaming,3dwo3a,lakilla21,6,Mon Jul 20 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"Well you might want to promote it by explaining what makes it different and screenshot of the game so people can see it and be like ""oh this looks awesome!"" So when they see something related to it they will remember and go buy it. Always show stuff off at a constant speed like maybe 2-4 screenshots of maybe the new stuff you added or some weird bug you found in game that is funny so it shows you are working hard on the game. It shows dedication. If you start social media this will pull in people to like or follow your page then when release happens a good amount will be more temped to purchase your game. Take advantage of everything you can while it lasts."

IndieGaming,3dwo3a,tgunter,3,Tue Jul 21 08:16:33 2015 UTC,"There is allways risks involved when sending out copies of your game to ""strangers"". However, if you try and handpick a few streamers for exclusive first looks, where you join in, via voice, chat or ingame. The risk is minimal."
IndieGaming,3dwo3a,Blitzkriegsler,2,Mon Jul 20 07:25:57 2015 UTC,I see.  Thank you for the advise!
IndieGaming,3dwo3a,Blitzkriegsler,2,Mon Jul 20 12:02:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely does not apply to games! Games have a very short hype life. Don't blow your chance while the game isn't ready for the public.  Once you have a working build and are expecting to release in 2-3 weeks, then go hard for all the promotion. Up until this point, limit all public knowledge to small developing blogs and screen caps."
IndieGaming,3dwo3a,kalin_r,5,Mon Jul 20 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"While this might seem to make sense from a conceptual level, lots of experienced indie devs have discovered that this is very much not correct. In reality, it's a strategy that almost guarantees your game will flop.  If you want to be successful, you need to start promoting early, and do as much as you can to keep that momentum going. Your launch week is important, so you need to make sure you make as big of a splash as possible.  Think about it this way: promotion is exponential. The more people who know about your game and are getting excited about it, the more people they'll tell about. Making people wait can actually be advantageous. Anticipation breeds excitement, which makes people more likely to buy at launch than to wait.  Now, it's true that you want to present your game in the best way possible. Don't send it out in a clearly unfinished or broken state. Only show the best and most polished parts. Leave a good first impression. But definitely make that impression.  Marketing is a lot of work. Marketing takes time. Marketing is also what makes or breaks your game commercially. Don't put it off until last minute."

IndieGaming,3dwo3a,RoboticPotatoGames,7,Mon Jul 20 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"YouTuber checking in.   I'd suggest waiting until the game is a little further in development. I get 50-100 games sent to me a month, and the underdeveloped ones are ignored. It serves no purpose to you for me to promote your game when it won't be available to the public for 6+ months. In my opinion, you'd be better off creating a public demo that showed the core features and gave some light to the future of the game. Develop your press list and send the demo to that list."
IndieGaming,3dwo3a,CyberToaster,3,Mon Jul 20 13:08:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome insight!  Now I""m convinced that it's better hold off.

IndieGaming,3dwo3a,38spcAR,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"From my experience, your game will go through many stages before you have something immediately fun and engaging. In the case of streamers, the last thing you want is some big game breaking bug to throw a wrench in the gears and cause the stream to come to a screaming halt. Nothing is worse than a potential fan of your game get turned off by someone struggling with your game. You should start promoting as soon as you have something you feel is worth showing. That thing should come early. You want to create a solid, highly polished core. I think it's better to have a really flashy 10% of the game, than a really shaky 40%. You definitely want to promote early, but the most important thing is to carefully control what you show. Definitely get people to play it, but getting a complete newcomer to play a breakable build in front of a live audience is asking for trouble. No ones going to look up your game if the streaming crashes it in 5 minutes, and shrugs and moves on to something else."

IndieGaming,3drgxo,Psychobeans,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"Talos Principle has a free trial on Steam, so that will probably do more to help you decide if you like it than any of our opinions. I like it for the story as much as I liked the gameplay, but they don't exactly mesh so I can see why someone may not like it (you can beat the game without ever paying attention to the plot)."
IndieGaming,3drgxo,Magrias,3,Sun Jul 19 18:14:21 2015 UTC,2 recommendations (both FPS puzzle games):  Great abstract puzzle game called Fract OSC where you are rebuilding a synth/MPC from the inside.  Parallax - Black/white puzzle game where you are completing levels through dimension swapping.  Edit: 1 More - Q.U.B.E - bit of a Portal-esque puzzler but looks great and has some interesting puzzles.  Check out the 'More like this' section of the Steam store page for Antichamber for even more good recommendations.
IndieGaming,3drgxo,tanyaxshort,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:11:54 2015 UTC,I think I remember seeing Fract OSC ages ago but thought it was a glorified rhythm game lol but having seen it again it does look more interesting. Lot of other people said Parallax is good so will check it out and as I love Portal  I will definitely give QUBE a go. Thanks for your suggestions!
IndieGaming,3drgxo,FungalCactus,2,Sun Jul 19 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"Fract OSC isn't a rhythm game at all. It's more like Myst. The puzzles use music, but you don't need any musical skill to solve them. Definitely worth a try if you liked Antichamber."
IndieGaming,3drgxo,genericperson,8,Mon Jul 20 04:29:11 2015 UTC,"There is a game in development with a similar visual style to antichamber, but a slightly more rigid style of gameplay: Relativity, by Willy Chyr. The idea behind Relativity is twofold: The level wraps in on itself, so if you need to make it to the top of the tower, you can just drop off the bottom and land on the top. Secondly, you can change the direction of gravity, and certain items can only be used while gravity is in a certain direction - namely, you can move cubes around and place them on the floor, change gravity, and now they're on the wall and you can use them as a platform.    Unfortunately as I said it's still in development. It also looks like it may not have the same kind of spirit and commentary that Antichamber had (doubtless it will have its own instead), and obviously is less about breaking down the established rules of games and the universe, and more about defining its own set of rules and sticking with them."
IndieGaming,3drgxo,BigBreakfast,2,Sat Jul 18 21:40:35 2015 UTC,"Also, Willy is a cool guy and hosts a stream regularly, so you can check it out in development."

IndieGaming,3drgxo,DreadNephromancer,2,Sun Jul 19 05:57:18 2015 UTC,The Unfinished Swan. It's not quite similar but similar enough to be mentioned. The story is amazing too. Lots of layers.    Parallax is another good choice. No story but definitely mind bending in the same way.

Befireidn other survivors and maybe ask them to join you.  In the special continuous mode ""breakdown"" you restart the map (which is pretty big, 3 decent sized towns and farmland in between) and take 5 survivors on to the next stage, more zombies and danger each time. Also complete challenges to unlock specialist ""heros"".  It's an indie-ish (I think they were before but now work with MS Studios) XBLA game ported pretty well to PC.

IndieGaming,3dr0ya,Shar3D,2,Sat Jul 18 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"I figured it out.    The main goal is to keep your ship alive by keeping the green slot on the ship above zero. The blue slot is your shield (basically a free hit and if the blue die is a smaller number than the red, the remaining will be on the red die).    The top row of dice you get to select from have three different types.    Red - Attack, number is the amount of dmg. If there is left over damage, there will be a remaining number of said die.    Blue - Shield, applies to your ship's shield.    Green - Health, most important part of the game. If it reaches zero, you lose.    Yellow - Randomizes your row of dice to select from. Screen will flash red if you don't have a chance to live. It will deduct 1 when used.    Ship Core (bottom pixel) - Randomizes your ships health and shield. I believe this can be used once.    That's basically what I understood from the game. I'm at work so I couldn't go into detail yet.    EDIT: Fixed parameters."

IndieGaming,3d9ck9,NurmaKhan,2,Tue Jul 14 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"This is probably as good a place to ask as anywhere else.  I once read somewhere (cannot recall where, I believe it was a small indie-dev blog which is why I am having trouble finding it now) that pseudo-3D racers like this, Rad Racer, Pole Position, and Mario Kart give a better sense of speed due to ""faking"" of a 3D environment. I think the idea was basically that because you are manipulating the math of scale for different objects and such that you can achieve a greater sense of speed than what is available in a strictly 3D title. Does anyone know why this is or how it's achieved? Just curious."
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,pixel_illustrator,4,Tue Jul 14 17:36:58 2015 UTC,It has to do with the Field of View iirc. That's why you seem like you're going faster with a high FoV in Minecraft and why in Minecraft the FoV increases while sprinting.
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,NurmaKhan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"Hm, I'm not quite sure I understand how FoV would make a 2D game feel faster? To me that seems like it would be the opposite, FoV manipulation is (to my knowledge) a solely 3D effect that distorts the players perception via a fish-eye lens like effect (when it's more extreme of course). 2D games don't/can't have that. FoV manipulation certainly does make a 3D game feel like you are moving faster, but that fish eye lens effect is unique to 3D.  Unless you are saying these 2D racers emulate that effect in some way, which I don't really understand either."
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,pixel_illustrator,3,Tue Jul 14 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"Well I'm probably just wrong honestly. I don't really know, and I didn't think about that being different from 2D to 3D."
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,pixel_illustrator,5,Tue Jul 14 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah FoV is unique to 3D mostly because it's ""squeezing"" more of the world into your view. 2D games tend to be much more static in terms in terms of how the world is presented to the player. For instance it's very easy for a 3D game to switch between first person, 3rd person, top down, and profile views of the player/world, and you can even fake stuff like isometric and sidescroller views in 3D, but 2D doesn't allow this, and screen effects aren't as common. Mode 7 Graphics (of which Mario Kart actually uses) can give the illusion of different views of a 2D world, but it's still fundamentally 2D."
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,pixel_illustrator,8,Tue Jul 14 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"It's not really unique to 3D at all.  FOV is just a byproduct of the presentation of the game's graphics. It's not something that is inherently dynamic. Just because FOV can sometimes be altered in modern 3D games, doesn't mean it's not present in 2D games.  Because FOV is a universal trait of 2D presentation of 3D space, a 2D game can have a wider or narrower FOV than a 3D game."
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,NurmaKhan,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"...well, yeah, the actual ""Field of View"" is just part-an-parcel of 2D representations of 3D space, but I don't think anyone was honestly confused by that. ""Field of View"" is exactly what it sounds like, but myself and the other commenter were discussing it as the term is regularly used to a describe a particular effect that only 3D titles can pull off, the real-time manipulation of the FoV where more of the world is squeezed into the view dynamically."
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,Jimmyleith,2,Tue Jul 14 20:42:11 2015 UTC,"The way I was understanding /u/NurmaKhan's post was that he was saying a wider field of view conveys a greater sense of speed than a more narrow one. I didn't think he was specifically talking about dynamic FOV being the source of a greater sense of speed, which seemed to be what you've been talking about."
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,djfil007,2,Tue Jul 14 21:49:50 2015 UTC,I assumed it was dynamic given his example of Minecraft's dynamic sprinting effect. The FoV remains static until the player starts sprinting at which point it slightly increases to give a greater sense of speed.
IndieGaming,3d9ck9,Chemical_Studios,2,Tue Jul 14 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"/u/NurmaKhan   Yes this is more or less what I was saying. I just can't seem articulate myself properly today. :P   I can totally understand why it could be understood the way you were understanding it, which is why I tried to clarify :)  It's not like I think you're wrong, or that I disagree with you. Dynamic FOV changes are basically impossible in 2D games (outside of drawing new sprites for each FOV angle, being clever with the math etc.), and it's a huge strength for 3D.  I think it's the Need For Speed games where the FOV increases gradually as the player speeds up. This is a great way to make the player feel ""G forces"" as they accelerate, and would be a nightmare to recreate with a pseudo3D game."

It's pretty simple. I doubt most of these people go into retail and steal merchandise, so why is it ok to steal games? Do they think creative works get a five finger discount because its not as tangible as a broom or baseball bat? Do these people not realize that the more they 'pirate in retaliation' for DRM, the more they are bolstering its existence?"
IndieGaming,3d8g65,CyriusBloodbane,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:41:37 2015 UTC,"Do they think creative works get a five finger discount because its not as tangible as a broom or baseball bat? Do these people not realize that the more they 'pirate in retaliation' for DRM, the more they are bolstering its existence?   Pretty much.  Here's my theory with no quoted biology or social science behind it, but an amalgamation of articles I've read over time:  Firstly, we begin with a fundamental misunderstanding of the marginal cost of duplication applied to digital goods, in particular, disregarding sustainable renewal of funds required to produce goods of the same or similar quality (i.e., well-produced YouTube videos, high-quality mixing and production on digital tracks along with lossless distribution, and of course, interactive digital media like video games).  ""It's so cheap to make a copy and distribute it via peer-to-peer sharing, on bandwidth I paid for, so I'm surely not contributing to a problem, since I'd probably never pay for this anyway!""  An enormous wedge of the demographic is under the age of ~25, which implies immature frontal lobe formation (actually it's fully formed around ~40yrs, but the curve between white matter development and cognitive reasoning, as best we know how to measure, flattens out significantly after ~25).  This is not, by any means, an insult, rather, it's a biological characteristic of humans.  In particular, this affects ""young"" folks decision making process, causing greater difficulty with long-term thinking.  That's not to say that older adults are magically wiser, just that the mistakes they make are a more a mix of self-delusion and reinforced culture, and as such, we (rightly!) hold them to a higher degree of responsibility for their mistakes, especially wilfull and careless ones.  This, as opposed to younger folks who essentially have to justify spending the fewer resources they have, for their entertainment, and feel foolish in doing so, in that many or most of their peers are ""getting a better deal"".   The counterpoint to restore their confidence in ""doing the right thing"" is the somewhat subtle concept of patronage, as the nature of digital media piracy can't easily be boiled down into a moral duality.  For example, a rights-holder for a specific piece of digital media, let's say it's a classic PC game, may specifically wish to withdraw it from the world, denying access in perpetuity for completely irrational reasons.  Is that a moral act?  Perhaps not, and I'm against that sort of behavior, philosophically, but (at least in the United States) it is the rights-holder's privilege to do as they wish with their property.  Violating that would be at least ""piracy"" (if not theft, since we're distinguishing between the two).  The mechanisms of artificial scarcity are essentially the same between that policy decision and application of DRM, in that some people can't have it, and the presence of a price mechanism to selectively allow some access doesn't really change that.  But the problem is that this may be the way the laws work (again, at least in the U.S.), but it seems unfair, and may actually be unfair sometimes.  So, it's easy to form a narrative (especially considering frontal lobe development) where one's actions ""against the unfairness"" manifest as a punishment of those entities that promote these mechanisms.  It's basically unsubstantiated rationalization, something we all likely engage in at various times, to some extent.  Complicating this is the ""I do what I want!"" mentality, which encompasses both radical self-expression (can be good) as well as profoundly risky and impulsive decision-making (mostly bad).  In an atmosphere of volatile behaviors, passive activities like social media brigading and media piracy seem really low-key.  And, for the most part, that's actually true... except that en masse, it's a colossal problem.  TL;DR ""tragedy of the commons"" writ large, across the core gaming demographic."
IndieGaming,3d8g65,the_s_d,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said. I pay for all my music as well, even with the argument that the musician doesn't get a decent share but to be fair the musician entered into this agreement. There do exist musicians who do their own production and only license distribution and other takes on the existing system.  I do see the nature of the argument of the classic PC game (For fuck's sake, someone please make a new KKnD), but I mean there could also be a scenario where the rights holder simply didn't have enough liquidity to make a move to distribute. Or maybe they are holding onto it for the right time to distribute. Or maybe their actual sales numbers were absolute shit, so they don't actually want to spend valuable resources to create more of it. Or what about the scenario where the rights holder is working on continuing it but does not want to reveal it yet?  Your argument presented here also makes me consider something else: how long until a work should become public domain? Should there be a point in time where a specific work becomes public domain and you can download it for free, like you can the works of Edgar Allen Poe? How does this affect the future continuation of the series by the original rights holder? Once it is public domain does that make 'Sequels' free game? Would that result in tons of shovelware and a few gems hidden within?  Also thanks for a pretty thought provoking response :)"
IndieGaming,3d8g65,CyriusBloodbane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, regarding the public domain issue, I don't know exactly what a good solution would be.  I have some ideas, though, similar to compulsory mechanical license exceptions in copyright law.  The problem with my idea there is that these exceptions go specifically against the spirit of copyright, which is, in part, to protect the creator from undesirable depictions of an original work.  In any case, it is obvious to me that the current copyright duration is far too long.  How long should it be?  I'm not exactly sure.  I would advocate some sort of staged, or stepped, copyright scheme, such that ownership is somehow diminished over time.  This would incentivize creators to continue creating, as well as establishing a provision for future generations of a creator's estate to enjoy the benefit of their predecessor's creativity, a legacy which can be very important to a creator whose income stream is non-traditional.  At the same time, a fixed duration is established to prevent abuse from corporate entities or estates who wish to forever cling on to control.  How such an apparatus could be set up is where things go fuzzy for me... we'd need some sort of combined mechanical licensing agency, which would have to be independent and commercially neutral (etc.), and would have to broker a negotiation for license value, in a way similar to the music industry exception.  They would be responsible for determining a license fee to represent the ""value"" of using parts of the licensed work, establishing a depreciation schedule (down to ""free"", or public domain), as well as protecting the rights holder from abusive license applications.  Additionally, there would have to be enforcement for overstepping license provisions (as exists in compulsory mechanical licensing).  This is incredibly tricky, and establishing such an agency risks either devaluing someone's creative work down to a flat fee or having said agency be manipulated into perpetuating the same problem, i.e. that of an over-priced or perpetually-unavailable work.  Official sequels would be unaffected under such a scheme, and ""passing off"" a sequel which is only mechanically licensed, but not licensed to be ""sequel"", would likely not be a permitted exception, just as a mechanically licensed cover album cannot purport to be an official release by the original author.  I do think that there would be a clone/shovelware situation.  If the rights holder, or it's estate/corporate parent, still existed, then it could selectively choose to promote individual projects both financially and with advertising, as is traditionally done with the current studio publishing scheme.  In regards to cloning, at least all of the clones would be paying something to the licensing agency to compensate the original creator.  Perhaps the diminishing license could translate into some sort of diminishing royalty deal... I don't really know.  I hate to put that sort of power into a specific entity, one which would surely have been created under a mountain of legal drafting, one which employs lots of human beings to make decisions about the fate of people's creative works, but what else could hope to fairly and simultaneously represent small creators and the likes of Activision/EA/Ubi?  We have criminal court systems staffed with fallible humans that do the same thing, but determine far more serious outcomes than whether or not a ~25yr old video game IP is still fully owned by the bedroom indie dev who invented it (or the corporate overlord who refuses even fan tributes).

IndieGaming,3cytve,RandomNerdGeek,30,Sun Jul 12 00:45:16 2015 UTC,Yes. I would say all of those games are worth it individually. Even if you don't like that particular gametype it is interesting to go hand on on games that others talked a lot about. But that is just my opinion. From what you say about platform games I think Braid should be enough for you to treat the rest as bonus.
IndieGaming,3cytve,MuNgLo,2,Sun Jul 12 00:55:14 2015 UTC,Each one of those games is worth a lot more than five bucks for the entertainment you get out of them.    EDIT: except maybe dungeon defenders
IndieGaming,3cytve,Dan_Softcastle,3,Sun Jul 12 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"Dungeon Defenders is a solid multiplayer game, and its got a lot more replay value than the puzzle platformers if you have friends to play with. Might as well get the newer one that came out, though, if you like that kind of game."

I bought Risk of Rain because people won't stop talking about it on /r/GameDeals   Decided to refund it after 2 hours on Steam.  If you don't like the genre don't force it. You'll end up losing 2 hours.  I have to say I've also tried Super Meat Boy and hated it. It's not for me and I know I'll never buy anything like them in my life.
IndieGaming,3cytve,VolcaProblem,14,Sun Jul 12 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I personally loved Braid and Antichamber as ""peripheral thinking"" puzzles.  They can be taxing at times because they rely on non-traditional logic, but they're very well done."
IndieGaming,3cytve,funkme1ster,4,Sun Jul 12 01:12:48 2015 UTC,"First off, I think $4.89 for 4 games is pretty much always a lock.  But Braid is a piece of indie gaming history if you haven't played it.  Risk of Rain is fun as hell, it's a platform shooter roguelike with unlockable classes and skills.  Antichamber is hard as HELL, if you beat Portal 2 without so much as a bead of sweat, check it out but it's some serious outside-the-box shit.  Definitely worth experiencing if it wasn't already worth it for the other 2.    Dungeon Defenders wasn't my cup of cake.  But it's incidental at this point."
IndieGaming,3cytve,Kaneshadow,2,Sun Jul 12 01:39:18 2015 UTC,"Played the shit out of Braid. It's a classic. Although if I'm being honest, I'm not sure how well it would do if it came out today. It was the first of its kind, but there have been a lot great indie games since.  Dungeon Defenders and AntiChamber I didn't care for at all. Risk of Rain I haven't played. Anyway, depends on how much $5 is worth to you. I might pay it just to experience a classic."

IndieGaming,3cytve,mrmodeste2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:19:43 2015 UTC,"Might be a bit late here.  All 4 games should run on a pretty low-end rig. Dungeon Defenders might get iffy on big waves, and Antichamber might be a little bit taxing, but definitely not unplayable unless you're on some really impressively low end stuff.  Dungeon Defenders: Pretty fun, especially if you find friends to play with, still pretty good without. Tower Defense mixed with Third Person Shooter RPG stuff. Weird combo, neat fun game.  Braid: Never played. Heard great things. Sorry.  Risk of Rain: Took a risk and bought this game when it first dropped, and I regret nothing. It's a very fun game with a lot of content and a very original and interesting idea. Love it love it love it.  Anitchamber: A mindfuck of a puzzle/exploration game. Not stellar for replayability, but at $5 it'd be a steal for it alone."

Antichamber is a mindfuck, and I've only recently discovered Risk of Rain, but it's fun for a quick gaming fix as well.

Probably a 3-5 hour game I'd estimate...? Risk of Rain: Fun game but best played with friends or other people.  Unfortunately the most recent patch(es) to a newer version of the game engine to add Mac and Linux support has also broken the game in various ways and it doesn't seem like they plan to fix it. Antichamber: Very weird puzzle game.  I gave up after a few hours but enjoyed my time playing it.   FYI after transaction fees they get literally nothing from you if you pay less than ~$0.40 USD."

IndieGaming,3cy8t4,MisunderstoodPenguin,2,Sat Jul 11 21:28:03 2015 UTC,"http://www.co-optimus.com/games.php is a decent resource for finding on/off-line coop games.  The Trine series may be in line with the games you mentioned. Try the demos  The two Lara Croft top down games have a mixture of puzzles and shooty bits. Try a demo of the first in the series  For platforming, the two most recent Rayman games are delightful. Try the demos!  I've mostly played it by myself, but I've been really digging Crypt of the NecroDancer. You could see it as a dynamic puzzle game where you have to solve how to defeat each enemy and then how to deal with random combos of enemies.  I realize some of these aren't indie, but one of the examples was portal."

Axis / Game guru type tools didn't seem to get very good steam reviews.
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,Cha0sfox,8,Sat Jul 11 10:13:54 2015 UTC,"The problem with the RPG maker engine's are similar to unity, it has a bad name due to bad/new developers throwing together stock assets and selling them as a finished product.

IndieGaming,3cvfmm,keyface,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:23:07 2015 UTC,Rpg maker gets a lot of abuse but its how I got started in high school just playing around making RPGs.  Also for the battle system(s) while it takes work even in the 2000 version I know users managed to produce a whole variety of action battle systems (secret of mana style) even entire turn based strategy battle systems. Admittedly there are always going to be way more people just churning out stuff with the defaults but I don't think it makes the entire tool bad.

IndieGaming,3cvfmm,maezir,7,Sat Jul 11 20:43:36 2015 UTC,$12 tier worth it for Spriter Pro and Sprite Lamp alone - almost $100 in value on Steam.
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,MechaBeluga,2,Sat Jul 11 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"I got this bundle and there is so much that I am still not done checking it all out. Here are my impressions so far. I just started messing around with game making this year so I'm not a professional by any means.  I have been using stencyl for a couple months and just finished a little game, so I was happy to get the 1 year indie license which you normally have to pay 99$ for. It allows you to publish to desktop instead of just web. Stencyl is my favorite game making software so far.  Just started playing around in RPG Maker vx ace. What's nice about this bundle is that it comes with tons of rpg maker assets. Including the old school modern pack which has an earthbound feel that I love.   I also messed around a little with gameguru, which you can use to make FPS games. Right now it seems like game guru needs a little more fleshing out since it just released. You get a lot of assets for it which you would normally have to buy. Pretty much all of the assets are warfare, zombie or medieval themed. They have some scifi blade runner looking buildings and decorations.   So far it has Very few character models, pretty much just soldiers, zombies, civilians and some fantasy races like orcs/minotaurs/lizard men. The character editor basically just lets you dress up and change some features of human males/females. I wish they had some robots, aliens or monsters. Someone made some dinosaurs you can buy on the asset store.   At least the program is super easy to use and you can make a basic level in a few minutes. I am not sure how the menu/ title customization works, it doesn't seem very robust. I think it's also hard to put in a lot of story into the game without using scripts.  This is as far as I've gotten working through the bundle content. So far well worth the 12 dollars I spent to unlock everything. You also get a bunch of other assets for game making and some other programs that I have yet to check out. There are several games included with the bundle as well."
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,SergeantIndie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"I'm always looking for things to prototype with, so I'm interested in the ""DLC"" packs and other assets.  Any sounds/music?  Ballpark number of sprites/tilesets?  Don't have to be specific and I certainly don't expect a full inventory, but do you think it'd be worth my while for assets alone (I'm mostly happy with my tools as is)."
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,MechaBeluga,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"I dumped everything in one folder so its a little jumbled up. There are a ton of asset packs from game dev market, including sci-fi and fantasy packs. I haven't checked all those out in much depth yet. They include sounds/music. There are a whole bunch of asset packs for RPG maker, and a few for game guru. Probably 20-30 all together."
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,SergeantIndie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:01:28 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I might pick it up tomorrow.
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,MechaBeluga,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"Just got home and counted, 20 plus asset packs, around 9 or 10 look like tile sets, some for rpg maker, some from game dev market."
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,SergeantIndie,2,Sun Jul 12 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"OK, so for anyone considering this thing for assets alone:  Maybe not.  If you're a sound engineer who has never composed a song in their life, this is the pack for you.  Sprites, music, backgrounds.  There's like 3 menu sounds and that's it for sound effects.  The Menu sounds aren't even that great.  Kind of bummed out because I was hoping the Sci Fi pack might have some decent blaster sounds or sword swipes and clangs from the fantasy pack.  No such luck.  For example, they've got all the art, backgrounds, and music for a shmup.  Not a single sound.  Seems like a pretty huge omission.  Also you should be advised that some of the rights to use these assets are extremely limited.  For at least one pack you can create a game explicitly with one the company's game engines and use those assets for that. So you've got the rights to those songs if it is a game made on RPG Maker.  Anything else, and you're SOL.  But if you're just looking for things to prototype with, then there is a load of music here, and most of it is pretty good.  About the same for sprites if you're looking at an RPG or some sort of thing that looks like a tiled late 90s RPG.  Most of the sprites aren't great for anything I'd build, but there's some legitimately good music tracks and lots of them.  So, really, for my purposes, 12 bucks got my a load of music to prototype with. Not entirely sure how I feel about that, but it supports the Humble Bundle and I'll call it even I guess."

IndieGaming,3cvfmm,WaveLightGames,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:15:17 2015 UTC,"Certainly seems like a good deal.  However, I find that game dev need a certain limited number of assets for their game and I'm not sure that giving a range of assets would be that useful.  Perhaps a more focussed ""Fantasy RPG Game Dev Bundle"" and a ""Sci Fi Game Dev Bundle"" would be more appealing?"
IndieGaming,3cvfmm,21ki,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:23:10 2015 UTC,This is a very sweet deal. If I hadn't bought Spriter Pro already I would've bought it especially as it has Sprite lamp.

IndieGaming,3cttb6,chairliketeeth,3,Fri Jul 10 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"I quite liked Her Story- played it with my girlfriend and devoured the entire game in a night. Every keyword we typed in led us deeper and deeper into the story in what felt like a totally organic way. (I liked Gone Home for the same reason- but felt totally let down in the end with Gone Home) That feeling of organic mystery solving, whether real or imagined was very enjoyable.  When I heard about Sunset- I really wanted to have a look at it, but it did  feel less compelling than Her Story. I may still try it, despite JJ's... fervent dislike."
IndieGaming,3cttb6,Hwnn,2,Fri Jul 10 20:39:37 2015 UTC,"I respect what Her Story set out to accomplish and I enjoyed the experience playing it with my friend, but I thought the game itself was kinda rubbish. The writing and acting were just awful and overshadowed all the things the game did right. But it kept us entertained for 3 hours and only cost $5 so I don't regret buying it at all."

IndieGaming,3cozni,cevo70,4,Thu Jul 9 16:45:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I like the trailer, because it's different - feels quite meta, which I assume is the point.  But I'll ask the obvious question.   What is the gameplay?"
IndieGaming,3cozni,DarkMaster22,6,Thu Jul 9 19:05:57 2015 UTC,There is a demo available on the steam page. Try it yourself. Just finished it personally and I love the humor.
IndieGaming,3cozni,rujuro,5,Thu Jul 9 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"At it's core it is a narrative-puzzle game where the puzzles are solved using game systems rather than a single designer driven solution by recombining the behaviors you find in the world in your own way.   In almost all cases there are multiple ways to achieve your goal, we want the player to feel creative, not like they figured out what we were thinking.  Description here as well if you want more info http://www.magiccirclegame.com/seriously"
IndieGaming,3cozni,jokul,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:23 2015 UTC,How do you ensure the player always has a way to progress through a puzzle?  Or is it possible for a player to build their skills in such a way that it is impossible to complete?
IndieGaming,3cozni,rujuro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"We make sure that the player can undo almost anything they do, so there really is no state that is unrecoverable."
IndieGaming,3cozni,jokul,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:41:01 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good solution; is the process fairly easy or is it more punishing for the player to make these sorts of errors?
IndieGaming,3cozni,rujuro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:52:55 2015 UTC,"We made it as easy as we could, we want to encourage experimentation. Best bet would be to try the demo, before it ends you get a chance to mess around with the main systems."
IndieGaming,3cozni,ActionHotdog,3,Fri Jul 10 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"I played it at PAX, and it's like Hack n Slash or similar games where you ""reprogram"" the game. Essentially you explore and discover more ""attributes"" to use, so you can do things like change an enemy to consider you friendly and other enemies of its type hostile, or make a mushroom spew fire.  I left the demo wanting to play it more. The gameplay was fun and felt like there was a lot more possible than what the demo provided, and the narrative was entertaining (the floating eye things in the trailer are pretty snarky)."
IndieGaming,3cozni,KainAsylum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:10:48 2015 UTC,"Hi, another Magic Cricle dev here. Hack n Slash is a great game. It came out about halfway through the development of The Magic Circle. The main difference in design direction between Hack and Slash and The Magic Circle is that we wanted the player to feel more like a game designer and less like a game programmer. We felt that there is a very human story that tends to repeat itself anytime ownership of art comes into question, whether it be through shared collaborators or ownership by the fans (i.e. the George Lucas effect). This is the heart of the story that we wanted to tell."
IndieGaming,3cozni,The_Sodomiser,4,Sun Jul 12 05:09:35 2015 UTC,"I actually just played this for a review over at infiniteindie.com and you guys did an amazing job with this game.

IndieGaming,3cozni,tejon,2,Fri Jul 10 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"I played a few hours of Hack 'n' Slash, but when it got to the point where I had full access to the underlying Lua for basically everything, the fun drained out of it... basically, it started feeling like work. More importantly, work that would never be released; would never benefit or entertain anyone else.  Does The Magic Circle stick to attribute modification, and/or have some limitation on how extensively you can edit an object, or how many you can edit at once, or how often you can initiate an edit, or anything else that keeps it feeling like a game instead of a particularly unproductive coding exercise?"
IndieGaming,3cozni,rujuro,3,Thu Jul 9 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"You should try the demo, but I can say that we wanted the focus of this game to be making you think like a designer, not a programmer. The idea is to get creative without having to do anything particularly technical.   The limitations on editing are just those of the system, which is built to work kind of like behavioral legos.  But there are not any arbitrary limits, just the systemic rules."
IndieGaming,3cozni,tejon,2,Thu Jul 9 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"we wanted the focus of this game to be making you think like a designer, not a programmer   Ha! Okay, sold. On the demo, at least. ;)"
IndieGaming,3cozni,ps_Tom,3,Thu Jul 9 23:33:15 2015 UTC,I'm sure other developers sometimes get this feeling I'm gonna describe. I have a list of concepts floating in my head which I want to eventually explore. One of those was a wizards game when magic would be code and objects would have essence (programs) which you'd be able to change. And the gameplay in the trailer looked almost exactly like I imagined it :) That's so cool!  I'm really interested in trying it and seeing how it turned out. Good luck!

IndieGaming,3cgzmk,Decoyrobot,5,Tue Jul 7 23:56:43 2015 UTC,"If you go back and listen to how they talk about the game, they engineered this result for themselves.

They've done this to themselves, the fact that ED caught up to them with a different aesthetic but functionally similar concepts (and real multiplayer) may be a rock on bullshit mountain but its not the foundation."

Just like the fanboy slapfest over E:D vs SC has been going on before no mans sky announced and then it was suddenly sucked in it.  Not denying how pretentious the developers sounded but quite frankly artsy vague talk is better than ""We'll have an FPS module"" only to do a couple of months work and shut it down (too soon?). E:D is guilty of its own sins too, 'real multiplayer' is definitely not a term i'd use for it and in terms of gameplay i'd say the only common factor they have is that theres space and spaceships."

I'd say it's a little sparse on content for a paid app. I think the popular ""outcry"" for apps with no IAPs and no ads is a little misleading for many developers and really isn't a good business model when starting out with app development.   I'm saying this out of experience :(  I would switch this to a free app with ads. Either just an interstitial ad at the end of a round (you can even make it every other round to make it less annoying), or even a banner ad at the bottom.  The general game play is basic and addicting, which is nice. But your death screen is a GREAT piece of content. Creative little things like 50+ endings is a great way to make a basic app something unique.  Best of luck in your development endeavors. Keep making games!"

IndieGaming,3c8zkw,kokeshikeshi,18,Mon Jul 6 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"Motivation is probably the hardest thing about making games (#2 is making money). Some devs swear by scheduling work hours or showing off your builds at regular times like monthly indie meetups, but I hate deadlines. Instead I start making lists all the things that still need to be done before I ship and try to tick off at least one item every time I sit down to work so it feels like I'm making progress.  If I'm really sick of whatever I'm working on, I try to switch to another feature in the same game. I do some art for my games as well as programming and design, so if I'm sick of coding I'll switch to art for a day or two, or playtest the game and tweak the design. I save up fun bits for those times when I'm low on motivation."

IndieGaming,3c8zkw,Daxiongmao87,5,Mon Jul 6 02:29:44 2015 UTC,"You could try to lower your ambitions for your first projects. Finishing a game is a skill, you get better at it the more you do it. So it's a nice idea to make small(er) games if you can't finish your current one(s).  If you're working on a big project and lose motivation, maybe you could re-think the game and create a smaller one with what you already created.  I don't know if it's the best option but that's how I finished my first game. I struggled with something way too big (some kind of semi-open RPG) and eventually had to cut it down to the basic (a town and a dungeon). Once released I improved over it with updates that re-open the world with new zones around the town and side quests.  I'll probably do the same with my current project because I already feel it's getting out of hands :S  As for staying motivated, I don't really have a solution. Creating games is the only thing I can do and kinda became an habit over time. I feel bad if I don't touch (even if it's just moving a rock or adding a single weapon) my project every day or if I'm not productive during 2-3 days. But I now get the idea that losing motivation is a normal thing that happens from time to time (way too lot, to be honest). Gamedev is a scary (but awesome!) thing to do :S"

IndieGaming,3c8zkw,ShellfishGames,3,Mon Jul 6 08:13:59 2015 UTC,"Try to remember what got you excited about it in the first place. I've found that it's hard to make a game for anyone, including yourself. Doing it for someone will eventually make you resent that person for putting you through the stress of finishing a game (or any project for that matter). When that person is yourself, you'll likely give up or become incredibly stressed. Make the game because the game will be great. Acknowledge what you can and can't accomplish, and assess if the game you're trying to make will still be fun. I'm over two years into a successfully kickstarted game, and I'm still making the game for the game."
IndieGaming,3c8zkw,PotatoeRash,3,Mon Jul 6 08:33:08 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Always start with a proper gameplay prototype to avoid cases of ""man I've worked four months on this but this game just isn't fun at all""    So, this advice is quite simple and I'm pretty sure 95% of you guys already avoid that problem or just never had it to begin with... but oftentimes I have these (seemingly) amazing concepts in mind and I just can't wait to start working on them. But instead of doing the sensible thing - creating a minimal prototype with the basic gameplay features to make sure it plays well and feels fun and smooth - I start working on more technical things and optimization because I assume doing the ""hardest"" part first is better.   Once I wanted to create an underground terraforming rogue-like sort of game (yeah, I know), and instead of starting with something simple I spent a few weeks creating the necessary algorithms for terraformable terrain, including a bunch of really fancy optimization techniques, and water physics. Sure enough I was terraforming the shit out of everything at smooth 1000FPS, but in the end it all failed because I couldn't nail the controls.  So nowadays I make sure to start off with a pure gameplay prototype - no graphics whatsoever, no optimization, not even great code, just basic controls, mechanics and colored primitives for visualization, and I try to make sure the very core of the game is fun to play even without most of the content. Knowing your game is and always will be fun no matter what is a great source of motivation later on when you encounter problems."
IndieGaming,3c8zkw,tomerbarkan,3,Mon Jul 6 10:03:19 2015 UTC,"I make a list of about 10 action items I have to do everyday.  They can be as simple as ""change enemy sprite color to blue"" and as difficult as ""redo entire players control mechanics"", but I aim for 10. As the game nears completion, these actions get more directed and specific, and it's really exciting to see the home stretch. I'm motivated because, even on a day I feel lazy, my 10 super easy action items still feel like an accomplishment and motivate me to make my list the next morning."
IndieGaming,3c8zkw,Shadow_Being,3,Mon Jul 6 12:12:05 2015 UTC,"The only way that worked for me was making a decision that this is what I want to do with my life. This decision included reserving real work time for developing games (not as a side project, I quit my job and found a part-time gig so I have 3 full days to work on this), and investing money in the project.  There's something self-motivating when you know that there's a real tangible price to pay if you fail or abandon your project."
IndieGaming,3c8zkw,DocLogic,2,Mon Jul 6 12:29:15 2015 UTC,"always have a completed project (no matter how basic). Make your workflow so that you just have a small project and you add small modular improvements one at a time.  Try to avoid making large changes that could take days to code or try out to see if its even fun.  also- dont work on your game everyday. Spending a day or 2 just thinking about your game will help you from coding into a rut. Think about what you want to do for a while. It might seem a lot like doing nothing, but your time that you are actually programming will be much more productive and it will feel much more rewarding because you wont be coding as many bad ideas that end up getting scrapped."

IndieGaming,3c8zkw,Kondor0,2,Mon Jul 6 04:01:00 2015 UTC,"Losing hope is fine and normal. The trick is to keep working on the game anyway even if it's boring. Practise how to keep working (and just as importantly, how to stay happy and emotionally healthy) even if you don't have any motivation at all. It's not easy, but it's something you can learn about as you go—once you commit to doing it.  Don't let yourself start anything new. Remind yourself firmly that this desire to switch to newer projects is going to kill the new project too if you give in to it now. It's not worth it. The only way you'll let yourself start a new project should be by finishing this one.  Does it feel like you're not getting anywhere? Work out the tasks remaining, estimate how long each will take and start counting down that list day by day. If it looks like it'll take too long, cut down your plans until you'll have something finished in a reasonable time. Don't delete or throw away ""to-do"" lists for stuff you've completed; keep an ever-growing list that shows all the stuff you've finished so you can have a look through it occasionally and feel proud of yourself. Make sure you do a little work on your game every day to keep up momentum, even if it's just five minutes on the worst days. Keep moving forward."
IndieGaming,3c8zkw,lordoftherings911,2,Mon Jul 6 11:19:45 2015 UTC,Forget about motivation and try self-discipline.  Even your dream project will become boring after a while so you need to deal with it in the same way that you deal with all the boring stuff of your regular life: you just do it.
IndieGaming,3c8zkw,TheSapien,2,Tue Jul 7 00:50:38 2015 UTC,"how do you stay motivated?   I don't. I quit a project 3 times and start working on a new idea. Then get tired of the new idea and work on another idea. Then circle around and before you know it, I've barely got anything to do to complete the 1st idea and so I don't have to quit it for the 4th time. But by then I would have also quit my 2nd idea about 3 times and my 3rd idea twice. So, basically I've got a train of progressively less developed games.   So, although a 2 month game takes like 6-8 months, I can release 4 two-month games in 8 months. But I guess this is why I've only been able to make mobile infinite runners or platformers with minimalist design, none of which has done well.  I don't have a team. My advice? Get a team. I would have stayed with an idea if I didn't have to do the parts I didn't like and only stuck with what truly spoke to me about the idea and worked on that and let somebody else handle the stuff I didn't like (which must be they stuff they like).

You can paint, sell your art, hire painters and expand your guild.  It's a historical simulation game. I'm a history teacher creating this game in my spare time, and I'm trying to make it both historically accurate and fun."

IndieGaming,3c5xzx,Brandon23z,2,Sun Jul 5 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, I was playing a lot of Game Dev Story when I started making Painters Guild. So there are similarities, especially the icons coming upwards out of the characters to represent work. The gameplay is very different, though."
IndieGaming,3c5xzx,AD1337,2,Sun Jul 5 22:11:56 2015 UTC,I just watched a video on your game. I see how they are different and similar now. Did you do the art yourself? It's pretty inspiring to hear that a history teacher with no programming background is making a full game.
IndieGaming,3c5xzx,Brandon23z,2,Sun Jul 5 22:16:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm doing the art, code, game design and everything except for music (my friend Morvan is doing that). Thanks! It's been hard work but a fun journey."

IndieGaming,3c5xzx,PixelLeaf,9,Sun Jul 5 09:55:50 2015 UTC,"1) There are 3 cities you will be able to play in: Florence, Rome and Venice. You can also expand your guild from 1 room to up to 8 rooms.  2) Leonardo da Vinci is one of the artists in the game, there are also more historical artists (Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Botticelli and others) and infinite procedurally generated artists.  3) Impressionism would only come up in the late 19th century, and the game only goes up to the mid 17th century. I'm trying to be historically accurate, so there will be no Impressionism. Instead, there are the Renaissance styles: Chiaroscuro, Unione, Tenebrism and so on."

IndieGaming,3c5xzx,thommazk,2,Sun Jul 5 20:13:02 2015 UTC,The alpha is pretty hard! There are also some balance issues where it might be better not to spend much on furniture so that you have more gold to pay the goal payments. The final game will be more open-ended so you can explore everything without having to worry too much about running out of money.
IndieGaming,3c5xzx,ps_Tom,3,Sun Jul 5 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, I made it till Leonardo was like 23 so I hope I did good :o  If that's true then I may have to buy this sometime, love little sim like games :D"

IndieGaming,3c1g04,sarahnorthway,3,Sat Jul 4 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"I recommend this as a couples game.  I'm often on the fence about interactive storytelling games, but this is a goodie. I played it as a ""date game"" with my husband and we had fun piecing the story together over 3-4 hours. Kind of like playing a jigsaw puzzle or watching a detective show. The writing is cleverly set up to give you just enough hints to move on to the next set of clues and the pacing was perfect for us.  Her Story reminded me of Analogue: A Hate Story, where you're searching through logfiles on an old spaceship and trying to unravel a mystery."

IndieGaming,3c0p5n,BlackOpz,3,Sat Jul 4 02:46:18 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for sharing! What kind of marketing did you guys do pre and post launch?
IndieGaming,3c0p5n,bencelot,2,Sat Jul 4 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"Marketing Shattered Planet was really hard. There were tons of dungeon-crawlers and roguelikes out there, and although we had a few unique selling points (super pick-up-and-play, humorous writing, science fiction setting, meta-progression a la Rogue Legacy), none of them were ""hot""/""sexy"", and some of them are hard to prove until you play it.  That being said, we tried our hardest. We were writing blog posts and managing social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) for like 9 months before launch, and post-launch we even took it to PAX Prime as part of the Indie Megabooth. We released a free-to-play version on iOS and Android to raise awareness about the game, but it turns out that if you do that BEFORE the game launches, people treat your game like a port. Whoops. So don't do that.  The only marketing we did for it after PAX were occasional sales on Steam, Humble, and IndieGameStand."
IndieGaming,3c0p5n,BlackOpz,3,Sat Jul 4 14:25:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for sharing and happy birthday! On a side note, thanks also for all the blogs you've written. They were very useful, and they were helpful to me while creating our upcoming game here at Abbey Games! (especially the one regarding your battles with procedural levels)  More on topic: How much impressions and visits did your storepage have? I have the feeling that recently, these metrics have become way more important, since everything become much more croweded. I always thought that Shattered Planet's rightmost banner thingy was pretty good looking (withthe exploding planet), but the search banner spoke a bit less to the imagination. Could you tell us more about which marketing material worked well or had a high click-through rate?   For example, Reus had (since Steam metrics alowes me to read it) 17.4 M impressions, 560K visits, and about 55K sales. That puts Reus storepage conversion rate somewhere at 10% (according to my dummy marketing knowledge). It's hard to find this kind of data, to see what storepages/banner work the best, which I find increasingly useful.  Thanks in advance!"
IndieGaming,3c0p5n,bencelot,2,Sat Jul 4 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"We actually didn't test our click-through rate on our Steam banners as much as we could/should have! We tested our banners and icons a bunch on the iOS/Android stores, but the 8-week limitation on sales meant that getting statistically significant numbers for each banner iteration was just too time-consuming. What I CAN tell you is that we've had 15 million impressions and 540 visits, so... looks like your conversion rate is better than ours. I have a feeling our little banner is TOO sci-fi, and not enough 'dungeon-crawlery'/colorful."
IndieGaming,3c0p5n,imlaurie,2,Sun Jul 5 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"As a follow-up, our top impression sources were:   Roguelike promotion page Weeklong deals listing Tag page"

Humble or IndieGameStand or perhaps some other sale.  I kinda sorta hoard roguelikes...  Moon Hunters looks like it's going to be good.  I think I'll pick that up as it seems it might be a good couch co-op thing to play with my wife.  Good luck in your future endeavors!"

There was an anomalous period roughly between 2008 and 2011 where good games did mostly ""sell themselves"" (not that simple of course, but it was relatively easy compared to pre 2008 or post 2011).  The market today is a lot more competitive  & it's much harder to make money as an indie game dev than it was 5 years ago.  I've made ~$65k from my first indie game in 2011 which was profitable for me since it was mostly (although not entirely) just me working on it for about half a year and my cost of living was pretty low.

At least Steam has algorithms to suggest niche games based on your tastes, but everyone's too busy playing Minecraft etc to get around to them."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,WildFactor,5,Sun Jul 5 19:28:42 2015 UTC,Before you just have to put it on steam (hard) to have a decent income... Not the case anymore
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,gengis,11,Fri Jul 3 08:10:50 2015 UTC,Just the other day I was getting down voted as I tried to explain steam does not equal success. Nope. Steam is the savoir and solution to everything... How dare I question steam..  Steam fanboys are the downfall of PC gaming...
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,SegataSanshiro,2,Fri Jul 3 09:50:42 2015 UTC,"Before you just have to put it on steam   Easier said than done.  People pretend all the ""good"" games got on Steam, but as somebody that followed indies pretty obsessively at that time, good games were definitely falling through the cracks.  That was part of the problem that Steam was trying to solve with Greenlight in the first place.  The new system has the benefit that it is no longer on Steam's shoulders to solely determine what succeeds and what doesn't.  The problem is that the weight has to go somewhere, and now it's distributed on the teams of the individual games to carve out success for themselves, and some teams aren't capable of doing that in spite of a great game."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,sakipooh,3,Fri Jul 3 17:21:47 2015 UTC,"The myth that ""Good games will sell themselves""...   I think the real myth is that fantastic games are out there and no one knows about them. It's a bit crazy to believe something completely original, with a polished look and feel with excellent gameplay, would just fall through the cracks of the web with no word of mouth ever getting out. As if YouTube and it's millions of gamer channels would keep that a secret. I would really love to see this list that doesn't seem to exist.  I think the real reality is that people are making garbage and are looking for something to blame other than the fact they are completely unoriginal. ""Why doesn't anyone want to play my half-assed effort at making a <insert any game> clone?""  This generation of developers seems lazy and creatively bankrupt. So few want to try to come up with a new genre. They'd rather just look at past success and copy pasta the formula. Maybe it's not their fault but rather the tools being used. Perhaps Unity with it's prefabs and templates are to blame for the lack of out of the box thinking and truly creative content. It's like each one of these kids is being given a box of LEGO that only contains 5 pieces. Sure they can build something quickly but eventually it'll start to feel like their building the same simple thing over and over with slightly different configurations. It's not a marketing issue, it's the shitty product."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Bwob,4,Fri Jul 3 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  Do you acknowledge that there are good books that almost no one has heard of?  Awesome music that hasn't got the publicity it deserves?  Beautiful art from unknown artists?  Criminally underappreciated movies?  If so, then why in the world would you think games are any different from any other art form?  The skills required to make an awesome piece of art have surprisingly little overlap with the skills required to sell it successfully."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,sakipooh,3,Sat Jul 4 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"Show me one example of an amazing game no one has heard of.  Edit:   If so, then why in the world would you think games are any different from any other art form?   You must be joking right? The difference is night and day.  There is no greater verbal culture out there than gaming culture. When someone paints a picture art critics don't flood YouTube with thousands of lets play videos about it. The same can be said about films and music. While a song itself can spread via YouTube you will not see thousands of YouTubers play the song while delivering a commentary about how and why they like it. This mostly has to do with the fact that the art forms you listed are passive experiences rather than the active kind which games provide.  There is virtually an army of content creators out there hungry for something new exploit on their channels. All you have to do is make something fantastic and not some basic three month effort in Game Maker or Unity using purchased assets and modified prefabs from their store, which is about 90% of what is being pumped out right now.  In all of my years I have yet to see a great game fail to sell. However, what I do see too often is developers releasing poorly executed rip offs of other original and more successful games followed by misplaced blame on their lack of marketing."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Bwob,3,Sat Jul 4 02:56:55 2015 UTC,"No...  I don't think so.  Because that is a trap.  Anything I say, you will either claim is not awesome, (which, being entirely subjective, is not really something I can debate) or attempt to disqualify it for other reasons.  (Besides, anything I list is, by definition, something that people have heard of.)  So again, let's just cycle back to my original question - why in the world do you think games are different from other art forms?  (Or alternately, do you actually think that all good music becomes popular, as you seem to think works for games?)"
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,sakipooh,2,Sat Jul 4 03:29:02 2015 UTC,No... I don't think so. Because that is a trap.   Right.... The simple fact of the matter is that these games you speak of don't exist at all. It's a phantom point that creatively bankrupt developers use to explain their failures.  I answered your original question with an edit to my previous post.
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Bwob,3,Sat Jul 4 04:18:25 2015 UTC,"Why would you do that?  That just makes it harder for people to follow the conversation.  Anyway, I'm not sure what you're looking for from me here.  Are you just wanting me to be a recommendation engine and name cool games you have never heard of?  Because steam can do that as well or better than I can.  Also, if your basing your logic on ""well video game players just communicate more"", then your point is pretty laughable.  Give people with other interests some credit here.  They share as much or more than we do.  So if ""video game exceptionalism is the basis of your claim, all you are really proving is that you have an idealized view of your hobby, and aren't very good at paying attention to other peoples'."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,sakipooh,2,Sat Jul 4 04:48:10 2015 UTC,"I asked you to provide is a single example of a great game falling through the cracks, which is the basis for your entire argument, and you failed to do that. The only thing laughable is that you have nothing to back your claim.  Honestly, if there really was this vast collection of great games that have failed only because of their poor marketing it shouldn't be too difficult to find a half dozen.    ""video game exceptionalism is the basis of your claim, all you are really proving is that you have an idealized view of your hobby, and aren't very good at paying attention to other peoples'.   Wow, my claim is solid and that little hobby just happens to destroy the majority of all other entertainment industries on the planet including film and music. In fact it's the number one entertainment industry so I wouldn't even humour the interests of other people in the context of this debate.   They share as much or more than we do...   I'm gonna have to say a solid definite nope to that.  Video Games $93 billion  Film $36 billion in 2014  Music $14.97 billion in 2014  Using your logic a game like Star Citizen, had it been from an unknown developer, would go completely unnoticed by the entire web simply due to a lack of marketing. If you build it and it's exceptional, they will come."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Bwob,2,Sat Jul 4 05:40:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool.  I get it that you are super proud of liking games and think it is the best hobby.  But sales numbers don't really have much to do with what we are talking about here.  (I. E. How much people who like music, books, film, etc recommend things to each other.   Using your logic a game like Star Citizen, had it been from an unknown developer, would go completely unnoticed by the entire web simply due to a lack of marketing. If you build it and it's exceptional, they will come.   Haha, what?  No - by my logic, star citizen would probably do fine either way because they clearly have one or more people spending a lot of time on marketing.  By YOUR logic, they are wasting time and money telling people about their game and releasing all those videos, etc, since they'd be successful even without it.  Weird how basically all the successful games spend so much time trying to let people know about them, huh?  Apparently they're wasting their time and you just know how the industry works much better than all the people who are, you know, actually in it?"
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,sakipooh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"You are so out of touch with reality. The proliferation of game content via social media streams is light years beyond what people at saying about art, films and music. And sales numbers are everything when it comes to markets, that's the entire point of this conversation.   By YOUR logic, they are wasting time and money telling people about their game and releasing all those videos, etc, since they'd be successful even without it.   WTF? Are you kidding me? I never made such a claim. My point, since it obviously went far over your head, is that great games will never ever go unnoticed. The culture simply will not allow it. I was using Star Citizen as an exaggerated example to illustrate that point. In a universe where those developers used zero marketing the game would still eventually get noticed by the industry. I'm not here to shit on marketing all together as I understand that you need to market your title but all the marketing in the world will do nothing for a shit game, which is what is mostly coming out of the indie camp.   Weird how basically all the successful games spend so much time trying to let people know about them, huh? Apparently they're wasting their time and you just know how the industry works much better than all the people who are, you know, actually in it?   I'm in the industry and I never once stated marketing is not important I'm just here to debunk the B.S. myth that hundreds of master piece games are just sitting on the web right now and no one knows or cares about them. The reality is that a lot of no talent hacks believe their title was the next coming of Jesus when in fact it was just another throwaway unoriginal clone of something better.  This will stand true until you can provide a single solitary example, and that's never going to happen because you know it doesn't bloody exist."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,xbattlestation,3,Sat Jul 4 17:09:36 2015 UTC,The idea that indie games should make money is a myth perpetuated by those who make indie games to make money.
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Dexiro,3,Fri Jul 3 05:01:05 2015 UTC,"That's not really relevant though. It's a fact that a lot of indie developers would like their hard work to put food on the table, and it's getting increasingly more difficult to do that."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Senoculum,2,Fri Jul 3 08:39:05 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think a lot of them work hard enough. Most of them do it as a hobby and expect to be successful for the mere fact it exists.  Paintings, jewelry making, music, fiction writing, screenwriting, filmmaking, and heck, everything on Etsy takes a lot of effort, but it also requires some marketing savvy, major dedication, and real money needs to be put on the table up front. It's the same in starting a new cafe, or opening a brick and mortar storefront- it's not just art and entertainment.  Can a lot of ""indie"" developers even begin to complain when they haven't even registered a business name? The sad truth is that if you're making a game for a niche audience (and this includes board games and card games that pop up on Kickstarter) then expect a niche response.  It's incredibly easy now to find success if your work has the backend support to make it shine on PSN, Steam or your very own website. All the tools are out there, but as we all know, it's not the tool that makes perfection."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Dexiro,2,Fri Jul 3 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point of view. I'm not too sure it's fair to say that most aren't working hard enough but regardless it'll be interesting to see how the industry develops.   I get the feeling that the game industry will become one of the hardest to get into. It requires a ton of different skills, a lot of money and often a big time commitment for the players. There are genres that are effectively closed off because the competitors are too strong."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,ilovetoeatpoutine,19,Fri Jul 3 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"I've been sensing this for a while now. Like a whole new video games crash like the one atari suffered. Major labels are getting greedy and sloppy, thousands and thousands of indie games coming out that last maybe a few weeks/months and a majority of them just aren't that interesting.  My friend has been making a game for years now (emptied his bank account of $20,000 to sustain living while making it) and I am not even confident with the idea; I feel like it's going to flop, one of the reasons being how overcrowded the industry is getting and how hard it will be to get noticed. But seriously, how do you tell someone without coming off as negative? we'll see when he's finally finished."

IndieGaming,3bx3dx,jmking,9,Sun Jul 12 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"I'll bite.  Friends of mine made a beautiful little platformer called Marvin's Mittens. It's only a few hours long and there is no fail state. It's designed for children and adults who have nostalgic feelings of playing in the snow as kids. I really enjoyed it and replay it on winter nights.  Top notch music, beautiful hand-painted art, and fun mechanics... but no one played it. It doesn't really cater to the Steam audience, and it's extremely difficult to market a game like this.  Their second game, Starwhal, is a lot more successful. It got coverage on all the major game sites and has a decent following. It's out on PC and PS4 today and coming to Wii U and XBox One later on.  People really like the game but the biggest complaint is no online play. However, online play for a physics based twitch game where literally pixels worth of movement determine wins and losses is REALLY hard, and way outside the resources they have to build and support long term.  So despite being a game you might have heard of and maybe even seen huge Youtubers like PewDiePie play, they aren't exactly buying yachts."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,flexiverse,4,Fri Jul 3 10:35:55 2015 UTC,That marvins would be a hit if released on tablets and marketed to kids.
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,jmking,2,Fri Jul 3 13:05:44 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20/20 ;)  At the time, the indie market was a VERY different place.  When Marvin was first being developed, in order to even have a vague chance of ending up on a console, you had to have office space, a minimum number of full-time employees, and all these other red tape issues before MS/Nintendo/Sony would even talk to you. Getting Valve to talk to you was equally difficult.  Also the iPhone didn't exist. The best chance to get a game onto a console was to use Microsoft's XNA framework and hope to get onto the Xbox Live Arcade.  Now XNA is dead. They've got a game built on a technology that only works on PC and an obsolete console. To get Marvin on tablets and such now would mean a complete re-write. They haven't ruled it out - they've got a lot of experience with Unity now, but at the same time, the team would probably rather work on a new game than go back to that well.  We'll see"
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,flexiverse,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:10:55 2015 UTC,"No, I'm a digital strategist I could have told you how to market and what to target to make that game  massive. It's not complicated once you know your target audience.  Have you even played a nintendo game ? Also if it's c/++ et al  using a 2d framework it can be ported to ANYTHING. There are plenty of cross compilers around. You could probably easily port it to the 3ds. Unity ports to tablets off the bat. What real effort is there? You could probably pay a dude who'd port it in a few weeks."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,jmking,2,Fri Jul 3 14:28:06 2015 UTC,"Trust me - they've looked into porting. They've discussed with people who have done it (ported from XNA with MonoGame, etc), and while it sounds easy on paper, there are major problems - especially around audio and performance.  Like I said, they haven't ruled it out, but right now they are focused on Wii U and Xbox One versions of Starwhal.  Marvin's a really special game, and I hope they take another shot at getting it out there."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,gnomicrandz,3,Fri Jul 3 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"FNA makes porting XNA to mac and linux a lot lot easier than MonoGame. We did it for Square Heroes on Steam, but honestly, since the game didn't take off, it wasn't worth the effort financially.  Also used MonoGame to port Square Off to iOS and Android. This was very time consuming and even less of a success, but I believe it has gotten easier since then. Windows Phone is the most profitable platform for Square Off right now... Not that that is saying much though!"
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,flexiverse,-1,Fri Jul 3 15:02:44 2015 UTC,You are talking to the wrong people.  It's 2d game it's no sweat. It just depends how badly you want success.
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Zargogo,2,Fri Jul 3 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"There are always exceptions to the rule, but at the moment, most indie games are filled with passion and love, yet little to no self-consciousness. Developers have often no idea how their products fit into the the current market and don't care to develop one, rather simply hanging onto the fragile hope that they are not delusional and all of their investments and financial sacrifices were actually worth it, much too afraid to take an objective look at themselves and their work from both the perspective of innovation as well as marketing/sociology. Then they inevitable fail, most of the time."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,jmking,2,Fri Jul 3 15:07:48 2015 UTC,"Isn't that the point? Good games are good games, but not all good games suit the types of existing distribution channels. Also you can't just put a game out there and hope your audience finds it.  In a lot of ways making the game is the easy part these days"
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Zargogo,2,Fri Jul 3 13:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'm talking more about those developers who develop games out of nostalgia, falling into the same patterns over and over again. There's whole communities of them. Surprisingly, not many developers attempt to push the boundaries of game design. Most just focus on regurgitating the same cliches in a different form, which requires a lot of expertise and sociological knowledge to actually do successfully."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,sakipooh,5,Fri Jul 3 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"This a million times. I want to see these fantastic games hidden in the shadows of the Internet. I agree with you 100%, the market is saturated with mediocre simple ideas and developers blame the market and marketing hurdles rather than admit their game wasn't that great or original. A product will sell itself if it's worthy. These people would have you believe that a near perfect game released by the industry would be kept secret by the few and no one would ever speak of it online, which is a kinds of insane. Word of mouth is the key and that only happens when your game doesn't melt into the sea of unoriginal garbage."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,Jigsus,4,Fri Jul 3 14:17:24 2015 UTC,Not indie but Singularity was good and underated.
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,TheSecretMe,20,Fri Jul 3 12:22:37 2015 UTC,"I think indie game developers (and a lot of other craftsmen) are stuck in the trap of thinking that reach equals market.  The internet has given everybody such amazing reach that the whole world dreams of turning their hobby into their product. Not just game developers, just look at what's going on at Etsy for instance.  The problem is that hobbyists sticking way more time and effort into their hobby does very little for the market as a whole. Sure gaming as a hobby has grown over time and the internet gives people more reach. But you're still a drop in a growing ocean.  A drop that nobody was waiting for or asked for. You're just hoping that the drop you enjoy crafting so much might find an audience regardless of that fact.  I used to be a web designer and illustrator. And just like many other crafts, the advent of the internet flooded the market with people plying the same craft. Software, education, visibility it all just became more available. Some of these people were extremely talented, some were not so much.  But there's a moment in everybody's growth where these designers learn that while it's important to master unique styles of your own. Just selling what you want to sell is not a business model. Customers are looking for what they want, not what you want to sell.  That is why larger, more successful design firms easily out competed these newcomers because they were willing and capable to let go of their art to put their talents at the disposal of their clients, to produce what their clients want to see.  Freelancers often lamented this as selling out, killing creativity, removing the art from the process or some such. But really what it comes down to is the difference between having a hobby and selling a product. It's the same reason that triple A studios thrive selling fairly uninspired games while the really original stuff tends to have niche audiences.  Indie dev's can't have it both ways. Realize that what you do is largely a hobby in this climate and spending more time and money on it doesn't change that."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,je66b,3,Fri Jul 3 12:16:54 2015 UTC,"Very well put, but someone could make the argument that if everyone just did what the customer wanted how would we ever know that we wanted that new thing that someone made..

IndieGaming,3bx3dx,princec,5,Fri Jul 3 17:39:13 2015 UTC,The odd thing is that it's not a very financially lucrative market. For 99% of developers it's a dead loss.
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,ashwin911,5,Fri Jul 3 07:52:08 2015 UTC,"With financially lucrative I don't mean it is a market where anybody can make easy money. It means that there is a potential to make huge amounts of cash. This potential attracts of course a lot of people. So there is lots of money on the table that is up for grabs, however most developers aren't able to reach the table because the bar is set very high.  The same is true in, for example, the movie or finance industry, the market in terms of money is huge but only the top few receive most of that cash."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,solarbabies,13,Fri Jul 3 09:22:34 2015 UTC,"This is really well-written and I agree with you completely. Hit the nail on the head as far as I'm concerned. At the same time though, as indie devs, we can sometimes get a little too overconfident in our ideas. While it's true that a good game won't necessarily sell itself, it's also true that even if you spend years marketing a bad game, it probably won't sell any better than before. You need a good game, and you need good marketing, you can't be successful with one and not the other."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,akciom,4,Fri Jul 3 10:17:53 2015 UTC,"Having a good game isn't necessarily important as good marketing. Who would have ever given Hatred, a rather generic twin-stick shooter with a one-dimensional protagonist, a second thought if it wasn't for all the ""bad press"" it got?  The trick really is knowing how to market a bad game.  Sunset, has it's fans and certainly it's detractors. The problem isn't necessarily with the game but to whom they marketed it. It's an art house game, plain and simple. Mainstream gamers, i.e. most people on Steam, do not want a game like this and complaining about it on Twitter isn't going to change anyone's minds.  Cogmind, an indie rogue-like currently in development, recently released their alpha version. Granted, this looks like a really good game (even if you're not into rogue-likes) so it isn't necessarily proving that bad games can do well with good marketing, however, I feel it's relevant because it's a niche title. The game isn't currently on Steam however has done fairly well because the developer specifically marketed towards people who play rogue-likes. It's not seeing mind blowing sales but is doing very well for its target market. I'm even more impressed and excited that it's doing well despite the mantra, ""You have to be on Steam to make it as an indie dev."""

""Good"" and ""Fun"" aren't what games need.  Also, this is just my personal opinion, but I find it pretty narcissistic to think that your ""good"" game somehow deserves the attention and money of the masses. I'm not gonna play a game about a bunny collecting eggs when I'm in the mood for genre deconstruction. (Darkest Dungeon <3)"
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,flexiverse,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:29:45 2015 UTC,How do you write thousands of individual/personal emails? How much does 10 minutes of googling a reviewer really help? How many different ways can you possibly describe your game without any copying/pasting?
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,ChillZombies,4,Fri Jul 3 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"I've done both. Not thousands of emails, more like 2-300 - and probably about half copy/pasted. I think there's a good middle ground here."
IndieGaming,3bx3dx,UnknownStory,3,Fri Jul 3 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, thats what i did, a personal note followed by a pasted snippet.  Aside from the few reviewers that ive been following for years, it can be challenging to write a personal note to a reviewer youve only researched for 10 mins. ""hey i enjoyed your review of game x, thats cool you used to work for company y... Check out my game"""
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,trellos,22,Thu Jul 2 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Just seems a little hypocritical to participate in bundles and sales (how many times has World of Goo been bundled?) and then ask people not to buy games that way.  Unless I'm mistaken (in which case disregard), nobody's forcing you to put your game on sale or to throw it into a Humble Bundle.  The current state of affairs, with gamers expecting sub-$10 for everything, is only around because developers offered it and have continued doing so.  I'm all for taking a stand against dropping value, but if I'm going to buy a game at full price then I would also expect a dev to not drop it down 75% at the next Steam sale.  This kind of relationship goes both ways."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,ZenAnonymous,3,Fri Jul 3 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think some indies do make a point of avoiding sales, but in general bundles and sales are now a mandatory part of the modern indie marketplace. I can't imagine anyone purposefully sacrificing the ability to have a sustainable business all for the sake of having an imperceptibly small influence on the games economy."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,FlamingSwaggot,2,Fri Jul 3 16:20:58 2015 UTC,"The real issue is that AAA games from a couple years ago are also doing these crazy 75% off sales. So I could spend $10 on a mediocre indie game at full price, or $7.50 on Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition, which is almost guaranteed to give you more bang for your buck. There is, of course, the occasional KSP or Minecraft or Terraria or Don't Starve that gives you hours and hours of compelling gameplay for $20, but it's very rare to find that diamond in the rough."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,cparen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:54:20 2015 UTC,"This isn't new though. I've been fishing PC games out of the bargain bin since the late 80s.  I get that being an indie game dev is tough. Very tough. But it was tough last year too, and every year since forever."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,gpt999,9,Sat Jul 4 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"Does it really give indies more money tough?  Lets face it, the reason I buy a game isn't fully relevant to its quality, but mostly on how much money I got to spare, if I got 20$ to get myself some fun, either I will buy 1 indie game at 20$, or 2 on sale at 10$, but either way, I will put 20$ in the market.  Add multiple buyers, and you got a situation where there is a global amount of money that is bought into games, a higher quality game will of course, take a bigger portion of the pie, and if players feel a game is worth 20$, they will be willing to put up to that amount, but in the end, all this mean is that game take a bigger portion of the pie (Developers absolutely should try to sell the game for as much as gamers are willing to pay for it).  The coming of the concept of bundles mean that the money in the pie is divided further, with gamers paying less per games, but buying more often then they used to. High quality games will still take a bigger portion of the global pie, although its true its probably lower then before (meaning lower quality games make more, is that too bad of a thing tough?)  What we should fight for isn't higher price, but making sure most of the money we pay goes to the developer, and not as much to distributors (steam/gog, bundles, I love those guys, but in the end, they aren't the ones taking the big risk)"
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,Musenik,12,Fri Jul 3 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if you think the indie game scene is swimming in cash try making and selling one. Yes, it's an exciting scene. Yes, some do it for love instead of money. But if you believe that more indies should be able to make a business of it, please help to spread the word.   Full prices for indie games means more games from indies from whom you'd pay full price for their games. (not the circular logic it may sound like)"
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,the_s_d,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:17:24 2015 UTC,Full price? Nope you're off by a factor of as much as 2x.  $9.99-$14.99 is the new indie price-point  :-(
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,cparen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"Not for indie games. Shareware single dev and small studio games would be $10-20 in the 90s. Granted, prices haven't kept up with inflation, but the market is more competitive than ever - that's probably a large part of it."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,keiyakins,4,Fri Jul 3 01:42:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'll spend my entire gaming budget for the next few months months on a single, relatively short game. Great idea.

IndieGaming,3bxdd0,demonpants,12,Fri Jul 3 06:41:11 2015 UTC,Agree. I made about $1200 on my last game for 3000 or so man hours of work. That's around $0.40 per hour.  And the number of people bitching that it was $4 is absurd.
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,Sicmay,9,Fri Jul 3 00:26:36 2015 UTC,No offence but the number of hours you put into making a game is not relevant to the end customer who is purchasing your product. They had to work for their cash too. If you want to make loads of money then you really shouldn't be an indie developer

IndieGaming,3bxdd0,dSolver,3,Fri Jul 3 10:27:21 2015 UTC,"This is a cool idea, but I'm skeptical about it's efficacy for increasing support for indie games.  The truth is, for most games I've bought on sale, I may have spent $5 for a $20 game, but if not for the sale I would have spent $0 on it. Yes, I have a lot more games than I have time to play. Still, some of my money is still going to developers and I can try out more games I might have otherwise never played while finding some I enjoy and complete."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,foxsix,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:00:51 2015 UTC,well the general idea is to change perception on price of games. unfortunately I don't think it will do much. its always a race to the bottom as long as pricing is in the hands of inexperienced sellers
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,rootnegative,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I would really describe it as a race to the bottom as much as just free market capitalism. Unless we want to get the government to start regulating the price of indie games, there's not a lot you can do. It's a nice thought to encourage consumers to spend conscientiously--and there are some who will--but it's just not the reality of how most people manage their money.  I'm not an expert on this, but I would think your best hope is to try to motivate more people to want to buy more indie games. I believe game bundles and sales attract attention to games that a lot of people would never have even heard of let alone spend money on, and to indie games in general."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,Musenik,4,Fri Jul 3 11:20:56 2015 UTC,"As a gamer, I'm behind this. When Indies make more money, they make better games which makes me happier.   Now, all I need to do is put my money where my mouth is. Which one should I buy? I'm a strategy/simulation kinda gamer :D"
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,rootnegative,2,Fri Jul 3 13:00:25 2015 UTC,"Look at 7 Grand Steps. It's unique. It has a demo. So at least worth trying.

IndieGaming,3bxdd0,MisfitsAttic,2,Fri Jul 3 04:54:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of indie games and the gamedev scene, and I'm regularly spend money on people's creations (If its a game I like, I prefer to wait for sales to end so I can pay full price), but I kind of resent this idea that I ought to 'save the indies'. Some of us just had to get regular software development jobs, you know?!  The market is saturated these days. There's no way I could justify buying every indie game that comes along. I have fairly eclectic tastes, and I have my eye on many projects in development. If I gave them all a 'fair' amount for the work they've done I'd go bankrupt pretty quickly. (And thats not even getting to having the time to play all those games.)  Its cool that the indies are living the dream and everything, and I hope it works out for them, but if I could afford to support their indie dev career I'd support my indie dev career. I have a bunch of Ludum Dare entries and half-implemented ideas that I'd love to work on full time, but I'm well aware of the risks and its time and money I just don't have."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,zut50,2,Fri Jul 3 06:22:05 2015 UTC,"This is actually a really good point. As an indie dev I often get frustrated about ""entitlement"" I see from outliers in my community, but to look in the mirror that same entitlement is staring me back in the face.   Yes it's hard to be an indie dev, and yes we want nothing more than to make enough money to just keep making games, but we're not owed that by anyone.   I guess we each simply need to walk in the others shoes. For gamers, when a dev is frustrated and being a little whiney, understand they're trying really hard and so much can be demoralizing. For devs, when a gamer is frustrated and being a little whiney, understand they really just want to enjoy games and if you're spending hard earned money on something you have a lot of expectations."
IndieGaming,3bxdd0,MisfitsAttic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"Well put.  I've a great deal of respect for people like you who have the talent and the courage to create something amazing like you have done, but talent isn't enough to succeed any more.  A game isn't going to be successful just because its good. A good idea well executed doesn't guarantee popularity or profitability.  I feel bad for the many leagues of people out there, especially in mobile, trying to make a go of it in what is essentially a lottery. Just look at Flappy Bird. Dong Nguyen didn't even want his incredibly simple creation to succeed, and at the same time there are amazing works of art and craft that go unloved for no reason other than bad luck.  Developers, artists, musicians working in games are already being squeezed for all the industry can get out of them, and I can only see it getting worse. Things like Kickstarter only make it more competitive IMO.  I love to support my favourite game devs and indie projects, but its pointless to think we can fight against the tide. One should buy a game because one wants to."

IndieGaming,3bn6pf,primus202,-7,Wed Jul 1 00:54:55 2015 UTC,To enjoy HS you need to sink about $60 into the game.  Otherwise you cannot get cards that are cornerstones for many decks.  It's that or just lose over and over hoping you can complete some quests.  Farming in game gold for the wings is just about impossible unless you already have legendaries.
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,WakeskaterX,4,Tue Jun 30 23:11:51 2015 UTC,"If you believe that, you just haven't played enough to get good at the game. Legendaries are not at all required to play well. Some of the most popular decks (face hunter, zoo, grim patron) don't need any legendaries at all and are very cheap to build. You can also win with basic cards at rank 20 if you know how to play. Even though people do use netdecks at that rank, they don't know how to play those decks, so it's pretty easy to win if you're actually decent at the game. If you think you're losing because you don't have legendaries, you're actually just bad at the game since you clearly don't understand how situational most legendaries are."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,wipeout4wh,2,Wed Jul 1 07:56:10 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily legendaries, but cards you can ONLY get from blackrock mountain or naxx.  I want to build a decent mage deck?  Better do all of BRM and Naxx to get the right cards.  I can't even select the wings I need, I have to go through all of them.  So then to grind cards I just play normals and lose to people with all of the good cards, and yes I'm learning the game so I'm not 100% perfect, but I'm pretty good at strategy games and that doesn't help here, so it's either pay a bunch for Naxx/BRM or lose over and over and over and over and over.  No thanks.  That's an awful experience.  You don't get jack for losing too so you just waste time."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,WakeskaterX,3,Wed Jul 1 11:39:44 2015 UTC,"To enjoy HS you need to sink about $60 into the game.   Wrong, I am playing for free on my tablet from to time and I am enjoying it.  And I actually win about half of my games, and when I lose it's more because the opponent did better than me and not because he had 20 legendaries in his deck.   I mean sure, money would help you along, I don't doubt that, but it's not the only thing that matters.  Hell, you can have an amazing deck and lose because you only drew +4-5 lvl cards for the first few turns."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,HappyZavulon,2,Wed Jul 1 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I downloaded Scrolls it thinking it was free-to-play like Hearthstone... ran into the Scrolls paywall and promptly went back to Hearthstone."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,FeetSlashBirds,2,Wed Jul 1 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"This game had great potential, it's really sad (but understandable) that it got overshadowed by the release of Hearthstone.   Interesting view. I played it when it came out first, and was a little disappointed. But Hearthstone rocked from the first moment I've played it. For me HS was really the game I hoped I'd find in Scrolls. But even before HS I didn't see Scrolls to have any potential.  Potential is something I saw in the first Minecraft betas. It sucked and was ugly but it was also lots of fun. Scrolls was the other way around for me. It was already quite pretty and well defined, but somehow was more a grind than fun.  But that's just my experience. What was your thoughts about its potential? How have you hoped it would grow?"
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,erikb85,5,Wed Jul 1 10:13:01 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone is well-designed. It takes advantage of things computers do easily that you can't do well with physical cards (cards that create theoretically-unlimited numbers of other cards, counters that can be increased and decreased, cards that cast random effects out of a large set, etc) and avoids things that work badly with digital games (player-based interrupts being the big one). It plays like a CCG, which is actually rather impressive because most computer-based CCGs play like crap.  Additionally, it's reasonably balanced, it has interesting game design, the developers are acceptably proactive when it comes to fixing balance, and it's just polished.  Like most Blizzard games, it doesn't do anything astonishingly well, but it does everything reasonably well. Turns out to be a good formula."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,ZorbaTHut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"Not so much from a video game stand point. There have been other CCGs, but Blizzard has a pretty big audience. They struck a nice spot between casual and hardcore as far as CCGs go. Made it pretty simple to pick up and get started, but you definitely need to learn strategy and deck builds to do well."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,agmcleod,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:58:35 2015 UTC,"but you definitely need to learn strategy and deck builds to do well.   True, but it's not super complex, especially compared to other card games like Yu-gi-oh and Magic where you have to deal with fusions and different energy types.  The learning curve is smoother I think."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,HappyZavulon,0,Wed Jul 1 04:24:51 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go ahead and say scrolls looked like donkey doo from the start.
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,spaghettidrk,57,Wed Jul 1 13:41:47 2015 UTC,I guess they're focusing on Fallout now.
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,intake,5,Tue Jun 30 21:28:29 2015 UTC,Explain?   What does Scrolls/Mojang have to do with Fallout/Bethesda?
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,GregariousJB,4,Tue Jun 30 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"Back when Scrolls was first released, Bethesda tried to pull some shit about owning the TM to the name and demanded that they remove the game, or rename the game...  Mojang won.  It was ruled that ""Scrolls"" is too far from ""The Elder Scrolls: <Game Name>"" to be confused with their games.."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,shift1186,68,Tue Jun 30 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"That's... not really what happened. Mojang tried to trademark ""Scrolls"" which is kinda ridiculous. Bethesda fought back since that could be problematic for their series. Court ruled that Mojang could not copyright ""scrolls"" and that they couldn't make a game similar to the Elder Scrolls series."
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,notyourwaifu,2,Tue Jun 30 21:22:51 2015 UTC,"You switch from trademark to copyright half way through your post. Presumably you meant trademark both times?

It's the other way around, Mojang aggressively tried to Trademark the dictionary word ""Scrolls"" as their own invention and property and Bethesda defended it in court because it was a ridiculous  premiss (and won).  Of course many people here on reddit took Mojang side even if they were the instigators of that legal debacle, just because they look like the ""small guys"" compared to Bethesda. I personally lost lots of respect for Mojang for playing the Trademark troll and then acting all manipulative with their fan base, by pretending they were the victim."

IndieGaming,3bn6pf,DoubleSpoiler,3,Tue Jun 30 23:40:17 2015 UTC,Gah this game had such potential! I played a bunch when it first came out but content was just SOOO slow to come out that it got real boring real fast. By the time the first batch of new scrolls was added I'd already moved on. And now Hearthstone's destroying all the card game competition.
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,primus202,0,Wed Jul 1 07:32:35 2015 UTC,What potential? How would you dreamed it would develop?
IndieGaming,3bn6pf,erikb85,2,Tue Jun 30 22:43:16 2015 UTC,"It was a solid CCG with a really interesting board game/maneuvering mechanic. It was lacking diversity of cards and interesting deck synergies due to that. Plus it could never compete with the beauty and polish of Hearthstone which was also much more approachable.  It needed better intros, more cards, and better card combs/synergies. Game could drag on a bit to boot."

It was different enough to HS to have stood alongside it... But the entry fee and the lack of any real advertisement outside the whole Bethesda Vs. Mojang debacle didn't help.   Good game all in, shame to see it go."

IndieGaming,3bj0qc,cevo70,3,Mon Jun 29 16:57:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, just got the game a week ago, and as I'm a programmer I explored how it all worked.  1.- Yes. You can create a mod and start uploading it right away. The mods are simple json files that define each item. Shape and texture are enough to define each figure, card or dice. The game I explored (xwing miniatures) hosted everything in imgur and sites alike (even 3d meshes) and the game downloads the assets once you load a mod.  2.- The game has no rules, just a collection of assets that you use on a 3d physics featured environment. Add to your game cards and chips to keep track of hitpoints or whatever and everything will be fine.  4.- You will have a fully featured steam mod site where you can upload videos, screenshots, and will have a forum, etc  5.- You can publish a mod in seconds, in-game, with a contextual menu. Really straight forward.  In the corporate site they have more tutorials and videos, and more on their forums. You can probably find more info there, I'm on mobile and is a little bit tedious to copy&paste."

IndieGaming,3banc1,Tyrrrz,11,Sat Jun 27 11:52:02 2015 UTC,I tried it out for about 10 mins on the expo floor. The music has eerie way of putting you in a trance like state. Though there was an element of wanting to pick up a bit - especially because if you miss cue points the music calms down again. I hope the devs tighten that up by the time they release.

IndieGaming,3ays1w,Sheepolution,19,Wed Jun 24 16:13:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm Alex, I made the game. I made that trailer for our Greenlight campaign: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=458651962  I already have devkits etc. so we're coming to consoles, but I'm funded by Sony and the UK Government - I don't have a specific publisher, so I have to go through Greenlight to get onto Steam unfortunately, which is a bit of a pain but just something that needs to happen I guess.  We're about 40% of the way Greenlit in just over a day but we still need probably a thousand more votes before we get Greenlit, so I'd massively appreciate any votes:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=458651962  More on the game:  The game won Ludum Dare 28's innovation category. Dying is never necessary but just makes the game easier for those who find hardcore platformers super hard. It has extremely tight physics, my background's in physics and I 106%ed Meat Boy. I just made physics that I feel are perfect, but obviously there's some influence from there.  It has more vertical walljumping than Meat Boy's horizontal floatiness though and faster, tighter jumps. Plus there's checkpoints throughout the levels so each level feels a lot more like a mini linear Metroidvania style thing instead of a single level - the levels are like 10 minutes long each, and there's bosses etc. etc.  Also it's completely physics based, which means you can push your corpses around, spin things etc. etc.  And it's got a bunch of speedrunning features like seeded randomness, ghosts, stats, I hope to implement custom splits.  But yeah, thanks for the interest, if you have any questions feel free to ask."

Unreleased games:  Border - Remembrance is often considered similar or a rip-off of HLD. I'm not sure if the game's still in development, though.

IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Big_Cow,62,Mon Jun 22 11:44:18 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of counter-examples of similar games selling (Dear Esther, Gone Home, Papers Please…),. Maybe it's not the medium, maybe it's the game? I respect Tale of Tales for their pioneering work in videogames as art but looking at the actual gameplay, you can't help but feel like there's something missing, even if you ignore the lack of interactivity. $20 for such a game simply seems like a stretch and despite their numerous claims to purposefully go ""more mainstream"" with this, it still seems incredibly niche.  I kinda dislike them always shifting responsibility towards customers/""the industry"". While I can go on a long rant about what should change (and often do), in the end, it will be actual games that prove people's interest. There have been enough games in recent years that succeeded in this regard and getting all bitter for their attempt at this (and their ""moral obligation"") failing seems petty. I'm just gonna say that the emperor has no clothes, here. Sunrise seems like a game that's just not very interesting outside the high concept idea. You can't hide behind ""art"" when your game is, in reality, just boring. There is boring art, unintentionally boring art. There is bad art."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,nothis,18,Mon Jun 22 14:04:01 2015 UTC,"Nailed it. I keep seeing the narrative ""we made a game for gamers and nobody bought it,"" but from what I've seen it just doesn't seem like it was a good game.   Gone Home can command a price like that because of the stellar reviews it got, and even then I didn't grab it until it'd gone on sale.  Another problem might be exposure. I like to think I follow indie gaming rather closely, and this whole ordeal is the first time (I think?) that I heard about Sunset. Looking at it now, it seems interesting, but not something I'd risk $20 on, especially with the poor reviews."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Swisst,19,Mon Jun 22 16:02:26 2015 UTC,"You can't hide behind ""art"" when your game is, in reality, just boring.   I think I can agree with this.

They don't play games to watch a movie, and they don't play to stare at a painting/sculpture. They play to play.  The Path was gloomy, creepy, and had a great atmosphere. But you spend most of your time just slowly wandering through the woods, looking for junk. That's not engaging to a player. That's the equivalent of having them walk on a treadmill, while you dangle a carrot in front of their face. Their game The Graveyard literally has no gameplay; you just watch an old woman wander through a graveyard, and then sometimes she sits on a bench. That's not fun or engaging.  (Although I found Dear Esther and Gone Home to be equally boring, personally)  The main attraction of games and gaming is the interactivity. ""Show don't tell"" is a majorly important piece of advice, because that interactivity is perhaps the most effective storytelling method we have in modern media. You don't get the same sense of accomplishment from being told ""The bad guy is dead"" as you do from actually being in that battle, managing resources like health and ammo, dodging enemy fire, and conquering them with your own two hands. There's just nothing like it."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,tovivify,2,Mon Jun 22 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"Even if it's some simple mechanic, you have to keep the gamer doing something.    I'm actually starting to disagree with that. Dear Esther and Gone Home did fine creating an experience that isn't built around a ""challenge"" in the traditional sense of a game. People use the term ""walking simulator"" in a derogatory way but I believe you could accurately call them an ""experience simulator"" and they work as that. Just like a flight simulator simulates flying an airplane, these games simulate the emotional experience of a character. Subtract some boring object-collecting and repetitive fights and most popular horror games work on that level as well, games like Gone Home just go for a more subtle plot.  Sunset could have worked but, judging from gameplay videos and reviews (I haven't played the game) its plot simply wasn't good enough.  To add on this, I believe putting all the responsibility on ""people not enjoying the art"" hurts art games in general. It gives them a bad name and it is maybe the only justified use of the word ""pretentious"" I see in gaming. Good art is quite easy to enjoy. Art isn't boring. I mean, you have to open up to it and plenty of people just don't want to invest the time to do so or are stubborn about art wanting to ""destroy the fun in videogames"" or something like that. But plenty of people who are were willing to go beyond that played Tale of Tales games and still found them boring and that's IMO where the ""people just don't get it"" argument starts feeling a bit thin."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,nothis,2,Mon Jun 22 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"Dear Esther and Gone Home did fine creating an experience that isn't built around a ""challenge"" in the traditional sense of a game   I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this point, because of its subjectivity.   People use the term ""walking simulator"" in a derogatory way   It is pretty much a derogatory term, though. It's meant to imply that a game doesn't do much more than let you walk around. People use that in a negative way, because games are interactive stories, and when you put extreme limitations on a game's interactivity, to some people, the game feels stunted, lacking.   Just like a flight simulator simulates flying an airplane, these games simulate the emotional experience of a character.   You can put the player in the shoes of a character without limiting the gameplay to wandering around and touching stuff. Generally, most game studios that want to make a story-driven game make a good story AND engaging gameplay. And even though there's no real endgame to flight sims, generally speaking, there is still a lot to do in the game. You manage altitude, make sure not to crash into buildings, and then there's all the little buttons and controls. You basically have full control over a virtual plane. Whereas, with some walking sims, generally the player only has enough control to get the character from A to B, and make them look at stuff.   Subtract some boring object-collecting and repetitive fights and most popular horror games work on that level as wel   Here, you are discounting gameplay. In survival horror games, the point is to survive a horror scenario. The object collecting, like in adventure games, is usually to solve some sort of puzzle - unless you are collecting weapons and ammunition, which also help in that they allow you to fight back. But resources tend to be limited in the genre, so you also have to consider whether it is worth using valuable ammunition to get through a room, when you might need it later for harder enemies. There's much more nuance than you're making it out to be.   To add on this, I believe putting all the responsibility on ""people not enjoying the art"" hurts art games in general. It gives them a bad name and it is maybe the only justified use of the word ""pretentious"" I see in gaming.    I mean, all games are art. But you can make a game that has a good story, does something different, makes a point, and still have it be an engaging experience for players. There are plenty of games like that, and on top of that, successful ones, like The Last of Us, Braid, and Thomas Was Alone.  The ""pretentiousness"" tends to come from the naive and often elitist tones surrounding a game, be it from the developers who claim their video game is going to change people's lives, or the people who claim it is the next big thing, like it's somehow better than anything else on the market, only for people to discover it's a game where you walk around and touch stuff. This doesn't mean Gone Home needs to be a first person shooter to be good, but the fundamentals of game design say that you need to make your point effectively, with the interactive medium. This actually plays into what you were saying; simply put, when put to the test, people did not think Sunset was effective. Plus, they probably could have used some better marketing."

There's much more nuance than you're making it out to be.   I was specifically thinking about Amnesia: The Dark Descent, maybe the game that did the most to refresh the horror genre for me and it had little to no traditional game ""mechanics"" that I found to add to the experience significantly. There were a handful of puzzles, many of them rather lame (the finale is a prime example), some basic stealth that was more or less instinct-hiding in closets and all the most memorable scenes were almost completely passive experiences, like, say, running away from an invisible foe. Just being able to control the main character, seeing the world through his eyes and reacting naturally was all you needed. Heck, you couldn't even fight the monsters!  I'll happily agree that the most interesting general trends in gaming involve more concrete, mechanical interactions that can be won/mastered. But there's a rather new and, IMO, very ""honest"" niche of games that drop the alibi-interactions (quick-time events, throwaway puzzles, repetitive fights…) and acknowledge that they're emotional experiences first. That you ""play"" them like an actor plays a role and not so much like a soccer player plays a match. In other words: I don't believe that this is what Tale of Tales did wrong, there was a way to make this work in its niche. They just made it boring and act like this type of game has to be boring in order to be some kind of high art. That's IMO where they're coming off as pretentious."

That being said, I had actually seen Sunset during the Steam sale and checked it out but they lost me with their description and the screenshots. Ten bucks for the pleasure of being a housemaid? Not when I can get an outstanding game with massive production value for the same price.

And you're right, any time they're not happy with the sales of their games, there's always a blogpost blaming someone else. Sunset had an interesting premise, but I never checked it out because I know how Tale of Tales games play. They're all the same.

Because sorry, but that's not a setting I'd be interested in spending money on, especially not £15 (Actually there's not a lot of things set in the 70s I'd pay for and MaidSimulator 2015 is near the bottom of the list).  There's no hook. There's nothing to make me think ""Ooh, this could be interesting"" and consider adding it to my cart. Why would I spend £15 on Sunset when there's games like This War of Mine for the same price with a similar sounding plot and actual gameplay shown on the steam page?  Now while Sunset may or may not be a good game, they've done absolutely nothing to make it look worth buying. I wouldn't give it a second glance."

There's also that background plot about a war breaking out outside and you only seeing it through these apartment windows. There's interesting stuff in there. But it just doesn't add up to something bigger.  It's okay that they're not going for the same crow as, say, Goat Simulator or Battlefield 4. There's plenty of room for niche games. But if you want to do a game about being a maid in an empty apartment, they need to do something very interesting with that and it plain doesn't look like it."

Charging $20 for very little content was such a ridiculous thing to do. Not only that, but the game was just entirely dull in my opinion. I can appreciate developers that go out of their way to try and make a game that breaks the mold, but nothing from Sunset ever hooked me in any way.

IndieGaming,3ap9cp,LaurieCheers,8,Mon Jun 22 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"This was posted in this sub already yesterday.  I've been a fan of ToT for a while but I'm not sure who exactly they're blaming here. Putting one ad on one website and being shocked that it doesn't impact sales seems kind of a naive approach to marketing.  There's a lot of people (mostly students) making great artistic games who would kill for a chance to get the arts grants that ToT have had, to just make whatever they feel like. But if you want to keep going that way, you probably need to offer more innovation than ToT have really been doing... you need to help move the medium forward, not get stuck in making games that obsess about narrative over all else. That's not what the medium is about - it's not where it's best potential lies - and there have been enough games with, let's say, ""artistically minimalist"" interaction that people just aren't interested in that concept any more. You have to keep exploring and offer something more interesting than point and click variants.  Or, if they wanted to move into the commercial sector, then they needed a bit more business savvy - again, a struggle that most indies face, so I'm not sure who their bitterness is directed at.  Overall, I guess I don't think they really moved with the industry. Indie gaming has come a long way in the last 12 years. They seem to be suggesting that people still aren't accepting enough of art games, and that's why they've failed. But I think it's the opposite. I think that there are so many interesting and creative things happening in games (thanks to things like Steam, Kickstarter and the low barriers to creating mobile games) that there is more competition."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,mkk123,5,Mon Jun 22 15:25:18 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I play a ton of what we might call ""arthouse"" games, some of which I loved (e.g. Passage, Thirty Flights of Loving, Gone Home, Metamorphabet, To The Moon)... but I've always found Tale of Tales' stuff poorly made and not particularly compelling.  (That said, I haven't played Sunset, but it looks much better - definitely on my list.)  It's not that there's no audience for it. It's that you're not meeting their standards."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,mkk123,4,Mon Jun 22 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean ToT seem bitter about having inspired other people to make creative games. But they should be celebrating the diversity of games that people are producing now, and the fact that audience's have gotten more discerning because of it. Yes, the flip side is that you have more competition - but you should use that to drive you to innovate.   Trying to subvert the medium by creating not-games was interesting to begin with, they made their point, but you can't keep pulling the same trick forever."

IndieGaming,3ap9cp,mkk123,3,Mon Jun 22 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"Right. Also, if you want to make art for art's sake then you can expect to face the same challenges as artists in any sector - I mean, if you want it to be valued as much as film or painting, then great. Most people don't make money out of those, either.  The one thing I do agree with them on is that it's a shame if art funds for games really have dried up - that is a sign that the government are not taking the medium seriously enough to support it the way they support other creative media."

I don't think that's true at all. I think there's more interest in those types of games now than ever before. And I also think that there is more potential in expressing writing through video games than you seem to be convinced of. Good writing can do amazing things for a game. However, it's good not to mix a game that's heavily focused on the writing and a game with good writing. They're not mutually inclusive.  Maybe reason for this problem is the most obvious one, that they're simply not making good games, and are then trying to veil them under the pretense of ""art games"", which will only work for so long. Perhaps it's surprising that it lasted as long as it did."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,StuMx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you can't make a good game by focussing on narrative/good writing.

But truth be told, having watched about ten minutes of the let's play footage... I'm just not hooked.  The main character works an ordinary profession, I have no idea why what I'm doing matters, and there's little in the way of audio or visual candy to carry me through if there's supposed to me more going on later.  Tale of Tales got one thing right: whomever they hired to consult them on what a gamer wants failed them utterly.  My eighth grade English teacher, Mrs. Campbell, could have done a better job with one simple bit of advice: capture your audience on the first page.  I wouldn't pay for this, and I don't feel the least bit guilty about that.  Why does ""To the Moon"" work so well?  Within the opening scene there's a car crash.  Your characters have an interesting, sci fi role that makes you want to explore what they can do.  And they have a provocative goal at hand that drives interest in seeing what comes next.  To the Moon told a fantastic story.  Maybe Sunset did too - but I'll never know it, because Tale of Tales didn't have Mrs. Campbell for an English teacher."

Especially in the context of this discussion. Being able to successfully engage the audience IS artistic quality. The lack of engagement implies the lack of quality. If DaVinci's art wasn't engaging no one would have given two shits about after the first glance, and yet here we are several decades later still studying it for hidden information.   I feel you're falling for a disturbing trend in indie game development where experimental/artistic games end up being failures, and the blame gets cast on ""it's not commercially viable"", and yet the execution gets completely overlooked. Now, while I admit I haven't played the game, if the comments in this thread and reviews are anything to go by, then the patterns that appear have little to do with the commercial appeal of the product."

Ugh, I am tired of seeing indies blame their problems on others. The world does not owe you a living.   This is exactly why I mostly prefer games from devs who make games for themselves. They are the target audience, and they consciously make that decision when starting a project. They don't give a shit who ends up playing their games; if the game is fun and enjoyable to them, then completing it is an achievement. It's like completing a work in any other art or craft; hobbyist woodworkers don't hope to become millionaires by spending their weekends in the garage. They do it out of love for the craft.  The devs who (maybe selfishly) profess to make games for themselves usually release the best stuff. They do it for the love of the craft, and because they love what they achieve.  People in it for the money or to send a message usually don't create compelling games because the creators are not players themselves.  And then reality hits."

However I think the biggest issue is the price point. 20 bucks is way too much for what you get and even at 50% off that's still way too much.  I think if they had priced it at $5 it could have had more success. Lets look at the numbers some more. If the 4000 units they sold were at full price, that gives them a total of $56,000 or if they all sold at half price that is $28,000. The true is obviously inbetween.  But wait there is more, they also ran a successful kickstarter where they raised $67,636!  If you average the two possible sales numbers you get $42,000 + the kickstarter money and they ran through $109,636 for this game and that is nothing to sneeze at!"

They have to consider what that is worth to the people they hope will buy their game. They also can't go by the expensive standards of other forms of art. If they can't re-cooperate their costs for sunset by selling it for $10. Then their is likely something wrong with their development process. Or they are living beyond their means (which the house they were occupying in GameLoading:Rise of the Indies, seems to suggest) A game like that should not take that long to make. It took them over a year to make a game with barely any gameplay. I know artists are often perfectionists, I have the problem myself. But they have to learn to control themselves in that sort of situation. Also what about it's development has cost them an estimated $100,000+ ? I could live very comfortably for 5 years off that amount. How have they spent it in a year and accrued further debt? Something tells me they only have themselves to blame."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,archerx,8,Mon Jun 22 23:01:27 2015 UTC,"Looks like all those people who cry for games to be more mature and ""art"" don't actually buy games.   I like Tale of Tales, but... their games are heavy on being art in a game-like presentation, rather than what I'd generally consider a game in a conventional sense. Normally I'd say they need to be more game-like, but it sounds like they did that, which is a good start. That said, I'd never heard of this before now, and a lot of people are saying the same. Now I think about it, I've only heard of any of their games when they come out via a bundle. I can understand not having an advertising budget, but are am I missing every preview/review of their games, are they not getting previews/reviews, or simply are they not talking to journalists?  I'd hate the conclusion to be ""Gamers don't want art-like games"", but I think we can reasonably conclude people want game-like games with art.  As to $100k, that's actually fairly small budget for a game still, especially for multiple people over a year with costs (office, hardware, etc. etc.)"

IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Ardieroro,5,Mon Jun 22 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"The reason I put art in quotes is because I feel the games as art debate is really stupid. Of course games are art, a lot of creative work goes into them by one or more artists.   Saying some games are art and others aren't is insulting."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Norci,-1,Mon Jun 22 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"Of course games are art, a lot of creative work goes into them by one or more artists.   Creative work does not by default means everything is art.    Saying some games are art and others aren't is insulting.   Not at all. Only because something contains art, does not make that container art itself. Art is about depicting something artist thought was interesting/meaningful or conveying a message. Is online slot gaming art? Not really. If you take a bunch of paintings (art) and put them inside a glass display, does display it self becomes art only because it contains art? No.  Same way, while a single 3D character is art, the container of it, i.e. games are not necessarily art themselves."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,archerx,2,Mon Jun 22 18:43:31 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree.
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Norci,0,Mon Jun 22 19:08:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. So two questions to you then.  A) with my example of a glass stand, do you consider container to be art just because it contains art?  B) do you consider everything crafted, no matter how banal it is, to be art? From online casino gaming to a plastic plate for picnic."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,archerx,2,Mon Jun 22 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not who you were responding to, but for your first point, yes the display itself would be art. Museums and other artistic showings are arranged in an artistic way themselves; it's not just random placement of the works."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Norci,0,Mon Jun 22 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"I am responding to the guy I replied to:p   They may be arranged in an artistic way, in which case arrangement would be artistic, but question was if they are art themselves. If they are, is a bag you're carrying art inside of art as well?   If you take the most banal building and put art inside of it, does that building become art too? That's a rather far fetched argument. Way I see it, what separates art from everything else is the purpose. Whether it is created for practical means or as a means of conveying a message or depiction of something interesting.   Which is why an ordinary chair is not art, but same chair made of deer bones is."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,devancheque,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:38:07 2015 UTC,there is a difference between mass producing cheap crap and making a game. Even then I think the art in that area is in the setting up of the production line that lead to the rest of the production. It would better to compare a game to a movie and use the corporate movie analogy. Corporate movie as for internal use only.  I still disagree :)  Art is highly subjective anyway and is as futile as arguing which music is the best and that's what makes it beautiful.
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,archerx,3,Mon Jun 22 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"there is a difference between mass producing cheap crap and making a game.   Okay, we're getting somewhere, although even that mass produced ""cheap crap"" requires certain skills, planning and design. What about mass produced crap games?    Even then I think the art in that area is in the setting up of the production line that lead to the rest of the production.   Right. Part of the process of creating such a game could be art, such as making graphics. The point I was making however is should the end product be called for art itself, only because it contains art? You certainly wouldn't call online gambling for art, I think?    Art is highly subjective anyway and is as futile as arguing which music is the best and that's what makes it beautiful.   Well, it is subjective but not THAT subjective imho. There are certain definitions such as    ""the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" ""something that is created with imagination and skill and that is beautiful or that expresses important ideas or feelings""   Casino games, for example, does not require imagination nor creative skill. You take a mathematical formula and skin in.   The way I see it, what defines art is that its origin is non-practical and it is creation to express an idea, feeling, message or depiction. Which is why casino games, that are created purely for practical purposes and express nothing of importance are not art. Same goes for some cash grab game, it is created purely for practical purposes of earning money and does not express anything although it contains art. Call of Duty for example, could be considered art - it expresses the feeling of warfare."

IndieGaming,3ap9cp,TerrenceChill,-1,Tue Jun 23 03:27:28 2015 UTC,For the scope of that game yes 100k is more than enough. Maybe they shouldn't have thrown their money away on useless consultants.

IndieGaming,3ap9cp,russkhan,2,Tue Jun 23 06:03:02 2015 UTC,that's true. i guess it depends on what their costs were as well - it sounds like they invested a lot of money in it. maybe a wiser move is to do your best with a low budget if you're taking a risk on a niche game like this

The Endless Forest is a great example. Really neat, very cool, lovely to look at, confusing to 'play'... and there really isn't anything to do in the sense that most people expect. It's a graphically heavy sandbox chat sim, where you can't actually chat.  It's the kind of stuff I like to see out there in the world, I'm glad it exists, but art for art's sake can't survive without wealthy patrons. And to keep a computer software company alive takes deep pockets.  I bought a few of their products, because I like the idea. But if you don't write at least a few commercially viable games, don't expect to be commercially viable."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,kerm,6,Mon Jun 22 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have bought The Path and Fatale and liked them well enough. But I also knew exactly what I was getting into when I bought them. These games are Art with a capital A, the kind of stuff that literally belongs in a museum. Trying to make it on Steam and marketing to gamers was never going to work. And most of their stuff aren't the immediately engaging 'fun' kind of art-games such as The Stanley Parable, Jazzpunk, or Thirty Flights of Loving, but generally a lot more slow paced, less in your face, and often without any clear resolution to the story. (Dear Esther was pretty similarly unappealing to most people, but it got lucky and made a lot of sales because its previous incarnation as a free Source mod gave it a lot of indie publicity.) I'm sure they were doing this in some way but they really should have completely abandoned trying to appeal to gamers and just focused on people who like art."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,FatHat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Trying to make it on Steam and marketing to gamers was never going to work.   I don't think that's necessarily true. If anything, Steam is just about the best place you could get your game into, if you're looking to make it commercial. Especially now that we have user defined tags and such, where you can easily search stuff in your niche. However, Steam is also great about being transparent about user feedback. And if players don't enjoy your game for various reasons then those opinions will be visible and influence future buyers - as they should. There's quite a few games under the walking simulator tag that have a fairly decent ratings, so I don't think think it's a problem inherent to the type of game it is.  I find it hard to believe that if these games really do have the merit to warrant the price tag that they would be in this situation. I mean, either way, after 7 commercial games you should probably have this stuff figured out."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,some_strange_circus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"Thats the problem. None of these should have been ""commercial games."" You don't try to get a dvd of your weird little arthouse indie movie into a Redbox, try to get a big display for it at Target, or try to compete against summer blockbusters. You play it at festivals, small theaters, museums, etc. What these guys make is really niche and doesnt appeal to the vast majority of people.  Even among ""walking simulators"" (and btw they were making stuff long before that term was popularized) their work is inaccessible. They are artists first and game designers second. Take away the videogame aspect and it just seems weird, you don't see any other ""commercial modern artists"" out there trying to make an actual business out of selling their niche art films for $10 a dvd."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,fuzzlebuck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:44:07 2015 UTC,That's true. a lot of indie studios balance things by working on contracted gigs half the time and more independent projects the other half.

It's one thing to make an artistic experience, but to intentionally make the controls obscure or downright uncomfortable doesn't do the game any favors. If the theme is inaccessible, you should try to make the game itself as accessible and functional as possible.  I loved The Path, and the idea behind many of their other games, but all of their games are so inaccessible. Completely unintuitive in the gameplay sense, and not in an ""explore how to play"" sort of way, it's even cumbersome after learning how. I see they address this issue in this post, but I really feel like they could have advertised that better, or made it an even bigger focus."

IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Patedam,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with people who think Sunset's failure was more about price than anything. In the history of video games, 20 bucks for a game is not all that much. But on Steam in 2015, where over 50 new games release every week and all manner of games are available on the cheap, there is a lot of competition for someone's $20. Pricing the game a bit too high and with no discount off the bat for early adopters (something I always look for) is just not being competitive on a very competitive marketplace.  They didn't have to give their game away for nothing, but $15 with a 25% off opening week discount would have fallen in line with that type of game in that marketplace. Wouldn't have made the game a hit, of course, but at least peoples' first impression isn't a cold one due to the price."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,faemir,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"That's too bad. The Path was a really big game for me, personally. But, they were out of touch with video games as a medium in my opinion. I get the ""video games as art"" thing, but when you make the controls obnoxiously difficult to prove a point for example, I'm not sure that works.   A game should be fun. There's plenty of opportunity for high art aside from that, but a game should strive to be fun to play imo. Also, I've never heard of Sunset until now. That's a problem because I've purchased three of their games before."
IndieGaming,3ap9cp,Patedam,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"Having bought some of their games (The Path and The Graveyard), while I certainly don't wish them ill will... their games were just not that interesting. The atmosphere was almost always interesting, but once you got past that there just wasn't much to the experience. Honestly I think it's tacky that they're blaming everyone but themselves.

It went the same way with Dischan at the beginning of the year...These kinds of stories are always a bit sad and scary to me.  But while I enjoyed The Path a lot and thought it was a good game, I wouldn't have paid full price for it. I got it on sale and that was a fair price to me. It's hard, because there's such a fine line between making things affordable and making sure you make enough money. One of the initial problems Dischan had before the Kickstarter debacle was pricing Dysfunctional Systems too low and not making any profit as a result. But without that balance, things go belly up, I guess.  I wish the developers all the best and hope that they get everything worked out."

And to that people say 'Show don't tell.' Well movies have the luxury of guiding the viewer's eye where they want it to go, games have an even harder task of ensuring the player sees the details they need to see in order to get the story.   If this character didn't talk to herself and, coupled with that, is blind, I can't think of any other storytelling device they could've used to tell a story. Maybe put some reverb on all of the voice acting so that the voice just becomes thoughts? Not sure."

I'm not sure if you're happy for all the comparisons to that game, but Relativity looks really great and I am excited to see what it has to offer :)"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,14,Mon Jun 22 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind the comparisons. It only really bothers me when it's done in a dismissive manner, like it's just repeating what Antichamber has done.   I know a large part of it is because I haven't shown too much of the gameplay and the puzzles yet, and having a minimalist art style with edge detection leads to a very similar aesthetic. Antichamber has definitely had a big influence on the game, and Alexander Bruce, who made Antichamber, is a friend and has given me a lot of feedback and advice over the past year.   However, my goal for Relativity is to build on Antichamber in the same way Antichamber built on Portal, and take it in a new direction. It actually has a lot of similarities with Starseed Pilgrim and FEZ as well, at least with regards to the progression system and the metagames.   I'll definitely be posting more details about the game in the coming months.   Again, THANK YOU for sharing!"

IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,2,Mon Jun 22 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"That's interesting that you see Antichamber as building on Portal, as I'm not sure I see the comparison.  Portal took a single puzzle mechanic and followed it through from dead simple to fairly complex puzzles, taking the player along on a very carefully tuned difficulty curve, all while telling an engrossing story.  Antichamber is a mish-mash of different puzzles with little interrelationship between them, and a story as minimal as the art style.  That sounds far more dismissive of Antichamber than I mean it to. I really loved both games, I just don't really see much relationship between them beyond ""both puzzle games""."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,TheJunkyard,5,Mon Jun 22 11:21:10 2015 UTC,"The comparison is mainly from the perspective of a designer.   When I said Antichamber building on Portal, I really meant Antichamber expanded on the ideas that Portal established in the design of first-person puzzle games.   After Portal came out, there were a wave of first-person puzzle games that tried to emulate the formula (eg Quantum Conundrum), in that they had a very similar game structure as Portal - linear sequence of puzzles, voiceover to break up pacing, etc.   For me, Antichamber stood out because it went against all the design choices made in Portal. It was non-linear, no story. It's not so much building on Portal in simply refining what Portal did, but more that it looked at what Portal did, and went with something totally different, expanding the design language in the puzzle realm.   When I say I want to build on Antichamber, I also didn't mean I wanted to just take what Antichamber did and simply polish it. I meant more, how can I continue to push the design in the puzzle space, in the same way that I feel Antichamber did a few years ago."

IndieGaming,3amnj0,Turboshroom,2,Mon Jun 22 05:03:58 2015 UTC,"Oh man... it has indeed been a while. Sometimes I look at the early screenshots of the game I posted. This one was one of the first I shared on the devlog way back in 2012, and I can't believe it's the same game..."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,2,Mon Jun 22 05:12:24 2015 UTC,I remember seeing this game on screenshot saturdays and whatnot and and even having a little back and forth with you and now you're on freaking E3!? This is kinda crazy. Congrats!
IndieGaming,3amnj0,nothis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"Haha! Oh yeah, I think we did! I really like the screenshot saturday thread. I find that I get a lot less feedback these days with the different modes that the thread uses, but it's still a really good way to make sure I have something to show that week.   A lot of the feedback I've received there have helped shaped the game, so in a way, I got to E3 thanks to you!"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,2,Mon Jun 22 05:11:00 2015 UTC,"Those megastructures are really something else. Actually, it blows my mind a little that this stuff can be rendered so smoothly. Really unique stuff."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Saorigameover,3,Tue Jun 23 03:59:37 2015 UTC,"Optimizing the game for that stuff is a pretty significant part of development.   I brought on a programmer a few months ago who's been working part-time to help me with this, and he has written some really fantastic editor tools. For example, with the click of a button, Unity will automatically open up blender, bring in the mesh, clean it up, delete hidden faces, merge it, and then bring it back to Unity and apply a new material."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:16:19 2015 UTC,I watched someone demo your game at E3 as well and it definitely made me stop in my tracks to come check it out. I introduced myself to you! You may have my card still. I didn't know you made Antichamber as well! I played a little bit of that and thought it was great. I remember you saying you've been live streaming the development. I will have to check that out sometime. Great concept for this game. I thought it was very clever and aesthetically pleasing. :)
IndieGaming,3amnj0,MrBlueberryMuffin,2,Mon Jun 22 10:01:18 2015 UTC,"Hello (again)!  I actually didn't make Antichamber. That's actually Alexander Bruce, who is a friend of mine.   And yes, I will be live streaming development of the game. It's been pretty sporadic so far, but it'll be more regular starting in July: http://www.twitch.tv/willychyr"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,13,Mon Jun 22 10:07:11 2015 UTC,"Met this dude in Chicago. He actually when to school for physics as I understand it. Game is super sick, I'm happy he's getting so much coverage."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,zhucci,13,Sun Jun 21 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"I did study physics in school!   And thank you so much for your support!  BTW, where did we meet!? (feel free to PM me)"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,6,Mon Jun 22 01:59:49 2015 UTC,"Antichamber was damn good! Bought it in on steam sale just to check what is that game about — spent ~15 hrs in it. Will see what this stuff will be about, but it looks more like Antichamber 2 than separate game to me..."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,spriteguard,9,Sun Jun 21 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm Willy (the dev of the game). RELATIVITY is very different from Antichamber in terms of the gameplay and puzzles, but does build on a lot of what Antichamber established with regards to pacing.   I think the biggest difference is that all the mechanics are consistent from a systematic standpoint, while Antichamber was more about deception and psychology - e.g. turning around and the room has disappeared.   One example I can give in RELATIVITY is using the world-wrapping mechanic. The geometry of the world is a three-torus, so it basically wraps around in every axis. When you jump off the edge, you can land back exactly where you fell off from. This works with the cubes in the game as well, and when you throw a cube of the edge, it'll actually end up looping around. You can use this to your advantage if you need to get the cube higher, because you realize you can jump down, in order to go up."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,zhucci,4,Mon Jun 22 02:06:14 2015 UTC,Every comment of yours that I read makes me more interested in this game.

IndieGaming,3amnj0,Sicmay,3,Mon Jun 22 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"Not by the same guy, but this guy's on reddit - pretty sure I first saw this game nearly a year ago in Screenshot Saturday on /r/gamedev."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Ph0X,3,Sun Jun 21 21:31:07 2015 UTC,He's been here a few times too
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,4,Sun Jun 21 22:56:24 2015 UTC,"Visually it looks like Antichamber, but gameplay-wise, it's nothing like it from what I see.  Personally, I'm not very excited for this. It looks gorgeous, but the gameplay looks like a pure puzzler, which doesn't do it for me.  To me, a puzzle game needs to have that extra piece alongside the puzzles. Portal 2 and Talos Principle are perfect examples.  Antichamber managed to be great mostly because of the more open world nature of the game, adding a whole exploration aspect to it."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Ph0X,4,Sun Jun 21 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's Willy (the dev). The game is actually very open world (much more so than Antichamber.   I'm not sure what to say regarding your cocnern that it's just a pure puzzler. There's a whole metagame involving layers of puzzles. It's hard to talk about that though, because of spoilers.   I've been keeping a devlog on the game's development - I think that might answer some questions about the game's design."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,CubonesDeadMom,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear. The devblog definitely shows a lot more than the quick run in that video. I also see that it's set to release in 2016, so it's a bit unfair to judge an unfinished game, especially as mechanics usually tend to come before story.  I'll definitely keep this under my radar, and I'm definitely glad it'll see a PC release alongside PS4, as a lot of wonderful indie games are lost to exclusivity deals or lack of resources to develop multiplatform."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Spaceshipable,2,Mon Jun 22 02:28:52 2015 UTC,I like the exploration aspect of it. It's like exploring a completely different universe or plane of reality. Maybe only some people can appreciate that.
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,2,Mon Jun 22 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. From what I saw, it looks like the sort of game where you'd play a few levels and then say, ""Yeah I get it"" before putting it down and forgetting about it.   It also seems to steal the mechanics and even graphical style from Portal in part with the blocks and lines to what they activate. Certainly there's some inspiration there."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Spaceshipable,4,Mon Jun 22 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is Willy (the dev). This is just a teaser of the game, so it's still only showing the very intro.    From what I saw, it looks like the sort of game where you'd play a few levels and then say, ""Yeah I get it"" before putting it down and forgetting about it.   I've spent the past three years working on the game, so I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt for me to read that...   There's a lot that I have planned for the game in the later moments, and it is something that I hope will be special for players.   I've been keeping a devlog of the game for the past year and a half. It shows the evolution of the game. Some of the earlier shots are quite rough, but the more recent updates show what the later stages of the game are like and a bit of what can be expected."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:21:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, didn't mean to hurt you. Maybe I'm being overly critical. After all I haven't actually played the game. Good luck with it anyways :)"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Spaceshipable,2,Mon Jun 22 10:01:55 2015 UTC,"No problem. I think as a creative, the hardest feeling to deal with is indifference. I've basically spent all of my waking hours in the last three years on the game. As I type, it's 5:10 AM in Chicago, and I've been up all night designing a banner for an upcoming show of the game.   The design of the game is something that I have spent a lot of time thinking carefully about, and I've gotten feedback from a lot of developers and testers, and I want to create an experience that's worthwhile for a players and to make it something really special that they'd enjoy for hours.   To hear that it would just be something that someone would pick up and then toss aside after playing the open levels... well, it's not a great feeling.   I've met a lot of indie devs over the course of development of my game, and I can tell you that each one of them is super passionate about their work. No one is in this field to make money. Everyone is here because they want to make something that they care about for others to enjoy.   I know these are just comments on a website, but creators do read them, and they do care."

IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,2,Mon Jun 22 10:31:03 2015 UTC,Got to play this game a year ago at a small Midwest conference and talk to Willy. Was really cool and by far the most amazing respawn mechanic ever created. Not sure if he changed it since then though.
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Forseti1590,3,Sun Jun 21 22:10:14 2015 UTC,"Hello! I'm guessing you mean MGDS? That was a really fun event for me. I actually got a lot of useful feedback with regards to the game's design.   By ""respawn"" mechanic, you mean the the world-wrapping? It's still there! I've actually expanded on it quite a bit since too."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,TwilightVulpine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:08:02 2015 UTC,Yes the world wrapping! Was totally mind blowing to have that happen and was fun to use it to your advantage. Congrats on being in the E3 showcase :)

IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,2,Mon Jun 22 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"This is just the kind of game I've been waiting for. Whenever I have seen rendered 3D fractal videos previously, like this, I instantly want to get in there and explore them, find out their secrets, have that peaceful(or scary) feeling of wide open spaces. When these kind of infinite environments can be made to have game mechanics the possibilities will be so interesting. Relativity looks like an awesome step in that direction. This fractal design like with No Man's Sky is the main reason why I'm so interested in the exploration, because of the seemingly infinite space, going into these expansive worlds in VR are where it's at for me.  Looking great Mr Chyr!"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Fxture,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:31:27 2015 UTC,"You are who I am making this game for! I love rendered fractal videos as well, and have always felt the exact same. I was actually generating fractal images years ago, before I started on the game, but using 3D modeling software, so it wasn't interactive.   On a side note, I actually met some devs from Hello Games (who are making No Man's Sky) during E3 last week, and they told me they've been following Relativity's development!"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,king_of_the_universe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"That's so awesome. Man, I can't wait. There's something about fractals that sets my mind at ease, but is a scary thought all the same. Like the infinity of space.  No pressure about the VR comment I made, I just meant that when I look at the VR gear coming out, I'm more excited about entering worlds that are not possible in reality rather than the immersion from realism (though I still look forward to that as well!). Exploring infinity and out-of-this-world concepts is what gets me ready to lose hours behind a visor.  Another comment in this thread you mentioned FEZ, which is one of the best puzzle games I've played, the thought went into that game blows my mind. You mentioned Starseed Pilgrim, which I hadn't heard of, so I just got it on steam and have been playing for the last few hours. Took me about an hour to realise what was going on, but as it's clicking into place, I'm loving the concept and imagination that went into this. If anyone has other games of this calibre, please do recommend."

IndieGaming,3amnj0,phort99,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"The art style is fine, the use of color and communicating the game design is done well, and the looping spaces seem like a useful and interesting mechanic, but the world doesn't need another ""put boxes on buttons"" game.   Boxes have no purpose except to be transported. There's nothing in carrying a box from one place to another that gets me invested in a game. The mechanics and puzzles he shows here are vaguely interesting at best Infinitely looping 3D spaces haven't been done before in many games. As for the gravity mechanics, changing gravity directions has been done so many times by so many different games in more interesting ways that I feel like it's not really worth mentioning. Maybe he's trying not to spoil anything, and I can see how there is an interesting design space here for creating movement puzzles, but I think it's an oversight to do nothing but ""carry key to lock"" puzzles with no context other than the puzzle itself.   If the game were somehow themed around why carrying boxes is important (Portal: you are a lab rat in an experiment) I would feel a role in the story of the game and feel invested in the narrative. Portal got millions of people emotionally invested in one of its boxes in particular just by treating it like a character. Relativity's boxes grow on trees, but they don't look like fruit, they aren't used like fruit, and it just seems like a meaningless throwaway visual design. Maybe the designer was reaching for a weakly implied ""Newton's Apple"" analogy because of the gravity mechanics, but the tree is the only thing that alludes to that, and it still doesn't give me a meaningful gameplay context.  If the way boxes interacted with the rules of your world was interesting (Antichamber's various block snaking/spreading/flying mechanics) then the lack of meaningful context would be made up for by how the cubes are fun to interact with on their own. As it stands, the only thing that Relativity's boxes do is fall in one direction or get carried by the player, one at a time.   Infinifactory is a game about building shapes out of boxes, but each box has a form and you can infer a function from the name and the shape of the thing you're building. This implies a story on its own, even when you completely ignore the traditional parts of Infinifactory's story. Plus, the way you move the boxes through space and weld shapes together is incredibly challenging and fulfilling.  Maybe the boxes could be something else that gets me invested in their purpose. Maybe they're batteries that power machinery and power up the world. Maybe they're computers that route communication across the glowing colored wires. Maybe they're something abstract and unexplained, like there's a swirling fog inside them and when you put them down a magic fog breathes life into something nearby. I just feel like there wasn't any effort put into making the base puzzle interaction feel meaningful, because the designer came up with a bunch of puzzles that involved finding keys and moving them to locks, and some specific infinitely-looping spaces they wanted to create, and didn't consider player investment.  I don't know how early or late this game is in development, but hopefully they're either avoiding showing some of the interesting gameplay mechanics to avoid spoiling the puzzles, or it's still early days and the theme still hasn't been finalized.  paging /u/warandpiece"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks so much for the feedback.   (For others who may be reading this - I'm Willy Chyr, the dev of the game).   Regarding a lot of your concerns, it's actually mainly because of spoilers that I avoided talking too much about it in this interview.    Boxes have no purpose except to be transported. There's nothing in carrying a box from one place to another that gets me invested in a game.   I will admit, early on, the game was a lot about carrying boxes and using them to solve puzzles. I submitted it to a lot of events like IGF and IndieCade, and the feedback I received from the judges, as well as playtesters, was that many of these were tedious and not fun to solve.   It took a lot of design iteration and the good part of a year for me to figure out how to solve this problem.   This is a bit spoilery, but I do want to address this concern with some examples. As you've pointed out, the boxes are actually fruit that grow on trees. This isn't just a re-skinned version of a cube dispenser, but actually ties in very closely to the theme and evolution of the puzzles. The boxes are actually part of a larger ecosystem in the world. They grow on trees, and trees are actually grown from boxes as well. Here's the devlog post for more info.   In addition,  there is water in the world, which can be re-directed by the cubes (which can be rotated, but this is something that is introduced later in the game). Here's a devlog post showing the work-in-progress. Here's another post on the water aesthetic. Please keep in mind that this is all a work-in-progress.   When you combine water, a box, and some soil (again, something which will be introduced), it turns into a tree. This again has a major impact on the progression and development of the game.    Infinitely looping 3D spaces haven't been done before in many games. As for the gravity mechanics, changing gravity directions has been done so many times by so many different games in more interesting ways that I feel like it's not really worth mentioning.   The infinitely looping 3D space actually adds a tremendous amount of difficult in the design of the game because it means that I cannot rely on traditional methods of gating that's used in other games. I've had to develop a whole new set of level design language instead.   Most games that involve gravity changing take place indoors. Combining infinitely looping 3D space with gravity changing really opens the kind of architecture that can be explored, and also leads to some really interesting puzzle design.     I just feel like there wasn't any effort put into making the base puzzle interaction feel meaningful   I've been working on the game full-time for almost three years now, most of that alone (I was backed by Indie Fund about 3 months ago, and was able to bring on a programmer to help me). I've shown it at around 16 events around the world, and have had over 1000 playtesters play the game. I know it's just my words on a website, but I can assure you that I have put a tremendous amount of effort into making the puzzle interaction feel meaningful.     I really, really appreciate the feedback, and I make an effort to read everything that's written about the game and the concerns that people have.   If you are interested in the design process, I have been keeping a devlog on the game's development since November 23, 2013. I've posted a lot of my thoughts on the game's design, and you can see its evolution over the past year and a half.   What you saw in this interview is just the tip of the iceberg. I have a lot more stuff planned, and will be revealing them slowly over the course of the next year.   Of course, it's always a balancing act, because a lot of those discoveries are surprises that I want for the players to find for themselves."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,phort99,2,Mon Jun 22 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding.  Not sure what part of the game the demo video I'm responding to comes from. You mention it's a tutorial section so I assume it's the very beginning. Is there anything that can be done to move those thematic elements closer to the start of the game, so it's not just pure puzzles in the tutorial and people can get more invested in this world? Maybe make some of those trees and water visible through those big picture windows that you're currently only using to tease a view of other parts of the world?   I just feel like there wasn't any effort put into making the base puzzle interaction feel meaningful   This part came across wrong. Basically all I'm complaining about in that whole comment is the use of cubes. From the outside it looks lazy using cubes for everything, as it doesn't look fun to carry a box up some big ledges. The first few puzzles you show don't really look all that compelling in video although I know there's the problem that watching someone play a puzzle game is unsatisfying and spoils the solutions, doesn't show the thought process of solving the puzzle, so it doesn't demo well in video.  On an unrelated note, I don't know if this counts as a spoiler, but at 4:04 in the video, could you switch to blue gravity and carry that blue block with the purple one still resting on its side?"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,WarAndPiece,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:36:06 2015 UTC,"What's shown in the video is indeed the very beginning. At this point, the intro has been re-designed close to 40 times. I've watched over 1,000 playtesters go through that sequence. The reason why the more advanced mechanics aren't introduced earlier is because it can really screw up the player if they come across something too early that they're not prepared for.   The reason why the beginning has to be the way it is, is because everything is introduced to the player wordlessly. I don't have any text explaining how gravity works, or that you can only interact with objects of the same color when you're in the same gravity. All of that is communicated solely through the architecture and the level design.   Changing gravity to walk around is a really different way of navigating the world, and it takes time for that to sink in. What you saw in the video is only the first 10 minutes of the game. Some of the concepts take time to sink in, and it's all there for a reason.   I plan for the first playthrough of the game to take around 5 - 6 hours, with completionist playthoughs taking 20+ hours. It's incredibly difficult to show a lot of stuff in a 10 minutes live demo, esp at this stage where the game is still a work-in-progress. The cubes take on a less and less important role as the game goes on, but they demonstrate some fundamental rules of the world that's important for understanding how the world works.   The tutorial consists of 3 puzzles, and then you're imeediately thrown out into the world. As much as I'd love to start the player outside with a whole bunch of advanced mechanics, it would just confuse everyone. The exact sequence of puzzles is something that I've deemed to be the minimum necessary puzzles that players need to know before going outside.    On an unrelated note, I don't know if this counts as a spoiler, but at 4:04 in the video, could you switch to blue gravity and carry that blue block with the purple one still resting on its side?   Yes, you can carry the blue box away, and the purple one will stay. If you switch back to purple gravity though, the purple box will fall down. This does lead to some interesting stuff later, because this means if you exit the room, then rotate onto purple, the door will actually close behind you.     It's incredibly hard to showcase a puzzle game like this and summarize it down in 10 minutes without revealing spoilers. Also, like you stated, watching someone play through a puzzle game is an entirely different experience than playing through it yourself. The puzzle in which you use the blue cube to serve as a shelf for the purple cube is a really magical moment when the solution clicks.   Edit: I just want to add that the world wrapping and infinite architecture actually came about as a consequence of the gravity changing mechanic. It wasn't what I had set out to create.   Because you can change gravity, there is no objective up. This means that I cannot have infinite ground, because that would mean that is object down, which leads to the world having to float in space. Adding 3D world wrapping came about as a solution to the problem of what happens if players fall of the world. Once that was incorporated, I embraced it as a design choice, and that's where the infinite architecture started to come into play. It actually is very closely tied into the core mechanic itself and emerged in my exploration of how far I can push the mechanic.   Like I said, I really appreciate the feedback, but I just wish you weren't so dismissive based on a 10 minute video :)"
IndieGaming,3amnj0,LaurieCheers,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:50:44 2015 UTC,"Actually I was suggesting something entirely  different with taking the blue block out from under. I thought if you grabbed the blue block, gravity would continue to act on the purple one, but gravity would be acting sideways, so the purple block would rest on the blue one while you carried it. So it would rest on the side of the block and you could carry purple while in blue gravity by carrying the blue one that's supporting it."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,5thEye,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:53:14 2015 UTC,"No, that's not how the gravity in the game works. When you're not in purple gravity, everything in purple becomes ""inactive"" or freezes. It actually leads to much more interesting puzzles this way, because it allows you to use the blocks to create temporary platforms to accomplish different things, once you understand how the rules work.   A lot of these early puzzles are designed to build the correct mental model in the player's mind."
IndieGaming,3amnj0,Dicethrower,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"I just wish you weren't so dismissive based on a 10 minute video :)   I just want to say something here - whatever you do, someone will dislike it. This will hurt if you let it. An important skill to learn, as a creator, is to accept that you can't please everyone. Maybe a cube killed their parents or something.  (Actually, my advice is to turn it around: making a game people either love or hate is much better than making a game that's sort of meh. So if nobody hates your game, you made it too bland.)  Hope that helps! Relativity looks great, wish you all the best."
IndieGaming,3alyn9,jmarquiso,5,Sun Jun 21 15:03:01 2015 UTC,"I tried this at E3.  It seemed like an okay concept, trying to learn a story by investigating the aftermath.  Then I found out that between each day you get booted back to the main menu with 5-6 Paragraph text box explaining exactly how you will experience the game and my pretension meter skyrocketed.  It also ran really poorly."
IndieGaming,3alyn9,Grug16,4,Sun Jun 21 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"Sad news.   I like Tale of Tales, even if i don't always like their games. I think they've been an important studio and influence. If they've got one legacy, it's for pretty much single handedly creating the ""walking simulator"" genre. They did these kinds of slow exploration games long before anybody else.   I guess their demise is not entirely unexpected though. Anyone who followed what they do will be aware of their peculiar nature. Their games have always been very niche and they seem to revel in that. They make games because they're very interested in the possibilities of the medium, but also often commented about how they didn't care for mainstream gaming or even  ""gaming culture"" (for lack of better word). It sometimes went as far as gleefully taking up an antagonist role. It's part of how they ended up labeled pretentious and maybe also why they have a hard time attracting a bigger audience. Combined with having remained dependent on art funds, they never did seem like they ran a sustainable business.   Perhaps Tale of Tales has served its purpose and reached its goals, perhaps they're not really needed anymore. Games are certainly more diverse now, and there's no denying the role they played in that."
IndieGaming,3alyn9,arrayofemotions,3,Mon Jun 22 10:47:22 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan of ToT for a while but I'm not sure who exactly they're blaming here. Putting one ad on one website and being shocked that it doesn't impact sales seems kind of a naive approach to marketing.   There's a lot of people (mostly students) making great artistic games who would kill for a chance to get the arts grants that ToT have had, to just make whatever they feel like. But if you want to keep going that way, you probably need to offer more innovation than ToT have really been doing... you need to help move the medium forward, not get stuck in making games that obsess about narrative over all else. That's not what the medium is about - it's not where it's best potential lies - and there have been enough games with, let's say, ""artistically minimalist"" interaction that people just aren't interested in that concept any more. You have to keep exploring and offer something more interesting than point and click variants.  Or, if they wanted to move into the commercial sector, then they needed a bit more business savvy - again, a struggle that most indies face, so I'm not sure who their bitterness is directed at.  Overall, I guess I don't think they really moved with the industry. Indie gaming has come a long way in the last 12 years. They seem to be suggesting that people still aren't accepting enough of art games, and that's why they've failed. But I think it's the opposite. I think that there are so many interesting and creative things happening in games (thanks to things like Steam, Kickstarter and the low barriers to creating mobile games) that there is more competition."

IndieGaming,3alyn9,Antipode2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:58:32 2015 UTC,"This is sad, but also inevitable.    While I respect Tale of Tales for making gaming experiences that they want to make, it's a very niche market they are aiming for.    I've played and enjoyed ToT games before, but the thought of paying $19.99 (or $9.99 on sale) to be a house-cleaner for a rich bachelor (I know there's more to it than that), isn't something I'd relish - especially when there's so many other great indie games to purchase nowadays.  4000 sales is a very low number, but if they really care about sales they'll have to find a balance between artistic endeavor and commercial appeal.  They have two choices - try to aim for a more commercial market, or stick to smaller, less expensive projects that allow them to fully express their creativity (I hope it's the latter)"
IndieGaming,3alyn9,charmangled,3,Sun Jun 21 23:16:28 2015 UTC,Compared to previous games this was probably their most commercial endeavor

IndieGaming,3alyn9,chromesitar,-9,Sun Jun 21 21:27:21 2015 UTC,"Compare this game to Doom 4. Not artsy, doesn't have a pretentious message, doesn't appeal to SJWs.

If you want to make games for gamers and you make a game diametrically opposed to what gamers want from their games, you really have no one but yourself to blame for less than spectacular sales."

IndieGaming,3akw6z,Etalyx,2,Sun Jun 21 06:28:30 2015 UTC,"Cool.  For those wondering, the best way I can describe The Tomorrow Children is like being part of an ant-colony.  You play as a creepy, toy-like child in a vast empty void with other players and some NPCs.  The goal is to cooperate with all other players in the game to build a civilization.  Raw resources are obtained from ""Islands"", enormous structures that spontaneously generate off in the distance.  When I was playing, two islands were in the shape of a big sushi roll and a positively massive blue pig with an apple in its mouth.  They are so large that they contained cave systems and catacombs inside.  However, you need to cooperate with other players to plunder them as infrastructure is essential.    First you need to build a bridge to the island (the ground becomes water if you get too far from the base).  Kaiju will try to destroy the bridges, so you need to fire rockets at them when they appear.  The islands themselves can be mined into for the raw... stone?  Plastic?  Meat?  I'm not sure what they're made of.  They also contain caves with crystals and sometimes other things.  I didn't see any monsters but considering my child had a shotgun I wouldn't be surprised.  Each child will die if they are in darkness for too long, so you either need to build lanterns or use a flashlight with limited battery life to explore the interior.  You can only carry so many resources at a time, so you can build railroads that will bring resources between any two points.  You can also place things like ladders, trampolines, staircases, and platforms to make navigation easier.  Tools are crafted or purchased from NPCs, which require money earned by operating a machine to generate electricity.  I only saw a bit of the game but it was fun and creepy exploring the islands and the town.  If the concurrent player count is high I can see it being very entertaining."
IndieGaming,3akw6z,JohnStrangerGalt,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:50:13 2015 UTC,"I tried The Tomorrow Children at E3, but sadly it amounted to little more than a progress bar simulator in my brief time with the game. Almost any action you do in the game meets you with a progress bar, rather than you performing actions like mining and digging and building manually. The bars take a while also. I felt like it would have gone faster if I had a book to read in between clicking things :\"

We've been approached by Sony a while back but decided not to go with them for now.  They seem to be pretty keen on getting indies on board. From what I hear you should probably try to get some sort of timed exclusivity deal with them in exchange for a larger revenue share (But not too long, aim for something like 2-4 months).  Also don't forget you need to pass thought their (from what I hear rather extensive) QA team and get various ratings like ESRB, etc. They can help you with one or two of those, but for others you're on your own and this supposedly can be quite a lengthy and expensive process. You may also want to consider localisation which (agian, from what I hear) may be required to launch in some regions. This can also be very expensive (In our case between $10-20k per language, but we do have a huge amount of text)!  Good luck!"
IndieGaming,3a8t0x,hangipants,3,Thu Jun 18 13:36:02 2015 UTC,"Once we got the developer deal paperwork done we got a list like this. One of my initial goals with this first game was to keep the text minimal. There's maybe one page's worth for the entire game. We were told Vita sells like crazy in Japan so getting it to Japanese would be a goal at some point! I have a friend in Japan who speaks English and Japanese both, and when I asked the Sony rep last year if they allowed us to translate through our own means, that seemed to be acceptable. I have no idea what goes into the programming side of it though, or if there are additional things that need to be plugged in. I'm the artist of this duo.  Our game, though nes Megaman in length, has no mechanics outside of jumping and pressing use on a few wheels and doors, so QA and beta testing have been pretty good for us so far amongst our own testers.   And yeah, I've prepped my programmer for a lengthy process and I'm just playing things patiently. Thanks for the response!"
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,noved626,10,Wed Jun 17 16:25:54 2015 UTC,I think it's neat. But I think that it'd be nicer to respawn closer.
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,OneTrickKitty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:01:44 2015 UTC,The respawn isn't that bad if you activate the check points well except for a few exceptions XD
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,Jtheme,6,Wed Jun 17 19:08:01 2015 UTC,I personally find it very frustrating and I like it.
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,cynap,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:59:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I definitely feel that's the vibe they were going for.
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,Baknik,3,Wed Jun 17 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Same mechanic as Towerfall, Duck Game, Hotline Miami, and others. There's a reason these games do well. Most deaths feel fair, and the fact that all other enemies/bosses die in the same amount of hits adds a frantic pace to the game. It works really well if done correctly."
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,MuNgLo,8,Thu Jun 18 05:43:02 2015 UTC,"As a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne I certainly can appreciate using death as a way to teach the player, but a one hit kill is too much and is actually detrimental to this idea. With a health bar, you are able to take a big attack, learn from it, and immediately use your new knowledge. A death in a souls game means that you failed to learn. A one hit kill delays your ability to use what you've learned until you walk all the way back to the boss. Basically, you can't learn in the moment like you can if you can take 3 or even 2 hits instead of just one."
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,bionicseraph,5,Wed Jun 17 20:51:32 2015 UTC,While I get your point I think it really is a very deliberate choice. To use the travel time for suspense and build up of sorts. In a game that is only bossfights and each boss die in just a few hits it would be weird having the player take more then one hit or respawn directly into the next attempt. Definitely not a design for everybody though. Me included.
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,PapaAlphaTango,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's good, but ultimately it wore on me. Possibly it's because I was also playing Bloodborne at the same time, but I just couldn't handle the level of frustration that game was giving me.  Design wise though, I think it's great. The creator gave an interview where he talked about how he was really going for this sharp tension with a great release of excitement when you won. That's definitely very apparent in a play through."
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,CustomCoder,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:28:36 2015 UTC,It's annoying when you die but then it redeems itself by the bosses being held to the same one hp rule.  If you had one hp and the boss was a bullet sponge (arrow sponge?) then it would just be infuriating in the worst way.
IndieGaming,3a6fpi,Neon4pt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"I think its good. It adds difficulty, which is very important, so players can feel skilled when they finally win. IWBTG games are a bit overkill but great for the same reason."

IndieGaming,3a5i56,agmcleod,6,Wed Jun 17 12:38:07 2015 UTC,"It still blows my mind how a team of 10 people can do something this gorgeous.  My only issues is that all these events hype the fuck out of it, always putting it at the front stage of indie games in big conferences, mostly because it's an impressive game to demo. People's expectations are gonna be way to high. To me, this is an indie game made by 10 people. It probably won't have a shitload of gameplay and be an ""everything"" game, but it'll be an insane exploration game that has insanely cool tech."
IndieGaming,3a5i56,Ph0X,2,Wed Jun 17 14:43:46 2015 UTC,I have the same concerns. I just hope the game is interesting enough to keep playing. Dynamic systems of factions & war is difficult to make interesting.
IndieGaming,3a5i56,agmcleod,2,Wed Jun 17 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"I sincerely hope it has some system of building bases or strongholds or whatever so people can successfully ""stake a claim"" out in space"

I'm afraid the nature of the exclusivity agreement is that we can't say when exactly it will be coming out on PC, but it will be a laughably short wait compared to how long everyone's been waiting already.  Going to be hanging out in this NeoGAF thread once my account is validated to answer more questions if you have any. Thanks for sticking it out so long!"
IndieGaming,3a5i56,zaikman,2,Fri Jun 19 02:12:57 2015 UTC,just saw the e3 gameplay trailer that i missed too... looks sick. stoked for the depth of gameplay... going to put it on my arcade and play the crap out of it... I don't have a Neogaf acccount but can you comment on the control scheme? I'm very excited about a potentially sky-high skill ceiling and would love to know at least how many buttons it uses if nothing else :)
IndieGaming,3a5i56,gr3yh47,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:17:21 2015 UTC,"That's a fucking awesome setup :O  The control scheme is wonderful. I may be biased because I've been playing with it for two and a half years, but it gives you an unprecedented level of control over your ship. It's all momentum based movement, not too dissimilar from Asteroids but with much tighter controls.  We use every button on the DS4. Left thumbstick rotates your ship, right thumbstick pans the camera. Face buttons are used for shooting, juking (pops you out of the gameplay plane for a moment), firing missiles and ???. Left/Right triggers are for forwards/backwards thrusting, Right bumper is for boosting, Left bumper is for strafing/sliding. It feels more like a really slick 2D racing game set in space than a twin-stick shooter.  As for the ceiling, I find that I'm still getting better at it even after putting thousands of hours into it so I think you'll be happy :)"

IndieGaming,3a0hyt,echolog,4,Tue Jun 16 14:52:52 2015 UTC,Dark Souls is hard if you're playing it for the first time. After that it's very easy to memorize enemy positions and attack sequences and it becomes sort of trivial.
IndieGaming,3a0hyt,vincentrevelations,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:12:12 2015 UTC,So it's kind of like guitar hero?
IndieGaming,3a0hyt,CheshireSwift,0,Tue Jun 16 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say trivial, you can still very much be punished for slip ups, even when you know the game inside out. That said, it's definitely a learning exercise more than anything.  Either way, I agree people need to stop comparing things to Dark Souls, just because they have chunky combat, high difficulty and/or an oppressive, dark fantasy atmosphere.  Game of Thrones is popular atm too. If anything, I'd just say the ""life is cheap"" gritty fantasy meme is thriving, not that everything is inspired by Dark Souls."
IndieGaming,3a0hyt,DTMickeyB,-12,Tue Jun 16 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Only casual babies who play shit like cawadoodie and skyrim think dark souls is hard. It's an annoying meme. Dark souls isn't hard,  it's punishing to newbies,  that's it."

IndieGaming,39s16t,Space_Quack,12,Sun Jun 14 04:57:09 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend thinking of pixel art as a medium option like pencil, ink, acrylic paint or oil paint. The real question is what medium would the developer like to use to present their game.  Some will stick with what they know because they have artists really skilled at one type of medium, some will follow fads, some will decide based on what platforms they want to develop for and others may simply decide based on the software they have or are used to.  Other considerations are time. Vector graphics has a bit of a learning curve for someone who has never used Illustrator or Inkscape. The same can be said for pixel art and how to get the right look, what size to work in what software to use.  Personally, I've been working on an indie game using vector because I can export the image to any resolution I'd want. However, I'd like to challenge myself and make a pixel art game next.  So I guess it also depends on what the artist simply wants to try and do."
IndieGaming,39s16t,crumpled_sandwich,2,Sun Jun 14 05:30:15 2015 UTC,"indeed, quality art can be appreciated regardless of the rendering style. pixel art doesnt let you get away with being a bad artist"
IndieGaming,39s16t,gromange,6,Sun Jun 14 06:56:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I love pixel art and use it in all my games, but it really depends on the type of game you're making, who the audience is and what you (or your artist) is skilled at. Bad vector art, bad painted art and bad pixel art are all similarly horrible."

IndieGaming,39s16t,FungalCactus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:54:54 2015 UTC,I get what you mean but you can't argue that pixel art isn't a product of the hardware limitations back then. (Even though I love the way Fez looks)
IndieGaming,39s16t,Raymi,2,Sun Jun 14 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"If early man could've taken photos, they might not have invented finger painting. Therefore you might argue that painting is the product of hardware limitations. Just a thought."
IndieGaming,39s16t,FungalCactus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:49:24 2015 UTC,I know that. I'm just saying that the art is too elaborate/different to work on an earlier console like that
IndieGaming,39s16t,sal_vager,2,Sun Jun 14 14:49:15 2015 UTC,"I think indie devs shouldn't let the trend for pixel art convince them that all indie games have to be that way, there's many games that don't take the pixel art route and it's refreshing to see other styles, pixel art style, like minecraft style, is seen by some as overused.  To anyone making a game, don't let the notion that pixel art is somehow preferred from deterring you from making your game look the way you want, and using pixel art because it's ""indie"" instead of something you'd personally prefer.  Myself, I like vector art, hand-drawn art, 3D, anything really.  Pixel art is okay for some games but not for everything, what I like to see is variety."

IndieGaming,39s16t,slages,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"From my personal experience on the project I'm currently working on, the artist actually tried several other styles (vector graphics and even 3D) before experimenting with pixel art, and it turned out to be the style where he achieved the better compromise between quality and production efficiency/speed. I also recently saw an interview from the guys developing Eitr (also a 2 man team) saying the same thing, pixel art is the style where they are the most efficient. And for both of our projects, on top of classic pixel art, we don't hesitate to use modern rendering techniques like post-processing or dynamic lighting, I think that it blends very well with pixel art and there's still a lot of room for experimenting with it."

IndieGaming,39s16t,MelodyPlusML,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:58:10 2015 UTC,"What I find interesting about pixel graphics is that it leaves more to the imagination. That also makes it more wear-proof.

It could be a hit if he is able to take advantage of the way the world is revealed more, or incorporate more mechanics around the concept. Reimagine a few more retro mechanics in a new light, using that perspective, to really seal the deal, like Fez, where the shift in perspective is a core mechanic."

IndieGaming,39ai2i,matholio,9,Wed Jun 10 19:53:29 2015 UTC,I think it will be awesome for about 30 mins.   Should have called it ball and chainy.
IndieGaming,39ai2i,kormyen,5,Wed Jun 10 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for the feedback hah.  We've tried to focus on analogue input where possible, that combined with the physics based interactions leads to a lot of nuance and personality in interactions and emergent reactions.   We are currently working on AI for a single player and co-op ""Hordemode"" so there will be more than just killing each other. We really hope you'll enjoy Swordy for more than 30 minutes if you do give it a go! Haha.  Looks like there is a Ball and Chain restaurant, but it just doesn't sound as good =P"
IndieGaming,39ai2i,matholio,3,Wed Jun 10 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"I have been play Exanima, which has a physics based movement which uses momentum.  Looks to be similar.  While I may not be the right market for your game, All the best, it looks like a lot of effort."
IndieGaming,39ai2i,kormyen,2,Wed Jun 10 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome, been looking forward to Sui Generis, didn't realize there had been a release already. How is it?  Yeah, Swordy's controls are designed to be much more analogue and direct but obviously a lot more stylized. In Swordy there is no ""attack button"", the right analogue stick swings and aims your weapon directly toward that direction. Gamepad triggers directly map to extension of the weapon, so pulling the trigger rapidly produces stabbing (and if your unarmed then it controls punching).  The bumper button drops the weapon, if you drop the weapon mid swing or stab - that's how you throw.  Thanks for taking the time to check it out! :D"
IndieGaming,39ai2i,matholio,2,Wed Jun 10 22:08:22 2015 UTC,"Exanima is really quite different.  It took me a few hours to get the hang of combining the arrack button sequence, with actual swinging.  The character stumble about and it can get a bit messy, and chaotic.  There's no stab, I think there should be.  Come to think of it I didn't think I would enjoy it, and I did, so I will be looking out for swordy.  There are some exanima bids on YouTube.  Enjoy."
IndieGaming,39ai2i,gojirra,3,Thu Jun 11 02:29:59 2015 UTC,"You might be right, but have you played the game?"
IndieGaming,39ai2i,matholio,2,Wed Jun 10 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"I have not.  My comments are based on the video, which to me didn't show much more than a kill room."
IndieGaming,39ai2i,2ndStudio,2,Wed Jun 10 20:51:15 2015 UTC,It looks cool.  Is the animations based on physics? Some of them look at bit jittery.  I like the color splat when you kill enemies :) Awesome !!
IndieGaming,39ai2i,kormyen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yes they are. The character run speed and leaning depends on momentum, and the arms are using inverse kinematics to hold weapons and animate punches.   Yeah, we still need to polish some things!  Thanks. The size/length of the blood splatter shows how much damage was done :D"
IndieGaming,39ai2i,Jakkisle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"Looks awesome. 4 player co-op and versus, right? I kinda want to throw money at the screen and get it now.   Not a huge fan of the ""square-ish"" blood splatter, not a big deal tho.  Also I hope that using the heavier weapons won't be all about spinning around. An additional attack for it would bring more variation and depth to it. A button to raise the weapon above your head could be pretty cool, but it's probably too early to say anything without trying the game first. :p  Keep up the good work!"

Also, I can't see how anyone can have any argument at all that there should be no refunds for unhappy customers except the most shady and dishonest developers. As he says in the video, this is just how you do business. I mean, physical stores commonly offer full refunds on products, and those are often products that have been opened and used! This is a fucking intangible item of which you can theoretically sell an infinite amount of!"
IndieGaming,39b8xq,gojirra,4,Wed Jun 10 17:35:57 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, and as was said in the video, pirating is still an easier option if they're just in it to try the game out for free. So it literally is just a way to get a refund if you're unhappy with a product.  I don't know about anybody else, but I don't want to keep the money of someone who doesn't like my game."
IndieGaming,39b8xq,NoMoreBirds,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, game developer (and, full disclosure, one of the ones quoted in the video) here.

IndieGaming,39b8xq,DoctorFour,2,Thu Jun 11 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"The issue for an indie developer is that they may take a full year or two to develop a game to sell for .99 which only lasts an hour, and then people beat it in a day or two and just get a refund. Thus killing short well designed indie games."
IndieGaming,39b8xq,Pugnax814,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"If you take 2 years to develop a video game, which lasts one hour and is sold for .99 cents, you generaly are not expecting to make a living out of it. Besides, most people will not refund a game when they completed it and thought ""well, this was fun"". A ""you can't refund after you get [endgame achievement]"" would also solve lots of problems with people that abuse the system."

That's definitely true, and certainly part of the reason that developers are there is the gold rush mentality—but another big part of why there are so many games now is that the cost to produce them is dropping."
IndieGaming,398jwu,McPhage,2,Wed Jun 10 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"It'd be nice to think it's a gold rush but even something as apparently simple as Titan Attacks has about a year of effort gone into it, and that was just the initial deployment.

I'm not too familiar with Adobe Air, but from what I understand, it's more like the JVM - it's a runtime that you build on top of"
IndieGaming,398jwu,abchiptop,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"sorta... it's the new official replacement for Swing for Java, and it's a whole different world. Very fancypants."
IndieGaming,398jwu,princec,43,Fri Jun 12 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"It's a long, long read but a pretty important one. The salient point here is that with a no-questions-asked refund policy games can be priced appropriately instead of priced apologetically low. Fewer customers at a higher price point can possibly be enabled because you know that anyone who's unhappy can just get a refund.   That may pan out to be true, and I really hope it does. Game makers make a criminally low income most of the time and it would be nice for that to change."
IndieGaming,398jwu,rxninja,37,Wed Jun 10 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"Consumers are starting to see the steam sale/humble bundle prices as the ""true"" cost of a game, and that's putting a big dent in launch sales numbers.   There's lots of patient gamers who see a 15 euro price point, and even if the game looks good enough to play right now, there's plenty of reasons to hold off getting it until it's cheaper.  What customers need to buy new games isn't a higher price, but simply a fair price and a promise that they won't feel ripped off because of a >50% discount sale in six months.  As a marketing gimmick, deep sales have done what all marketing gimmicks do. They increased sales for a while, then customers caught on and the gimmick now does the opposite of what was intended."
IndieGaming,398jwu,Prezombie,15,Wed Jun 10 08:19:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest, during steam sales, I buy a lot of games and never play them. I don't plan to ask for a refund for any of those.  There are some games and developers that I really admire, and I'll go to great lengths to support them, by buying collectors' editions, soundtracks or extra copies for gifting."
IndieGaming,398jwu,zapu,6,Wed Jun 10 11:36:50 2015 UTC,"Axiom Verge is doing exactly what you're talking about. $20 price point, 10% discount in week one, and a promise that it won't go on sale until at least October. It's doing well financially, so what you say may end up being true on a more widespread level soon."
IndieGaming,398jwu,rxninja,6,Wed Jun 10 14:38:17 2015 UTC,"Thing is, the thing indie devs need the most is marketing, and a sale/bundle is the easiest and lowest-risk way of marketing a game. Sales and bundles aren't going away any time soon, and shouldn't.  What is true is that because sales are so important, games need to be priced with sales in mind. You can't have too low of a starting price, or the discount has less effect.  $15 is honestly a great price point for a lot of indie games. Base price is reasonable for people who are interested. 20% off gives enough of a discount to be worthwhile. 50% off puts it at a price that makes people on the fence willing to jump on it. 75% off puts it in impulse buy territory."

It's an incredibly unpredictable market and every ecosystem behaves differently."
IndieGaming,398jwu,rxninja,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"Crossy Road isn't a fair comparison to many Indie titles because it's a F2P game.  That's a completely different business model that relies on people not caring about microtransactions and being willing to drop $1-$5 at a time on it just because.  Compare that to a game that will have expansion DLC (like Don't Starve). Or even no DLC at all. Those games are dependent on selling at a certain price to cover the work done, rather than recouping the cost a little tiny bit at a time after giving it away for free."

Immediately after the refunds were implemented they claimed that consumer protection policies were causing them to lose more sales and that being able to screw the consumer over was more important.

He's the journalist, not Puppygames. It's not their fault Grayson can't do his job right and didn't disclose their alleged friendship. This is a failing attributable to the journalist; developers have no responsibility over how press articles get written.  As for that Twitter screenshot, is there proof that the account was a known customer and not a random stranger?

Sure there are sad stories of good games not getting enough attention but whose fault is that when marketing is your own responsibility? Don't blame the market when you're responsible for your own product. If your game can't sell at $2, it wasn't going to sell at $20 anyway.   Also: how are game makers making criminally low amounts of money when nowadays most games are self-published digitally? I hate this ""poor indie developer"" meme going around.

It's incredibly high risk, it's costly, it requires an entire stable of unrelated yet highly specialized skills, and the consumer base is intensely demanding.   It's not a meme. It's reality. It's very, very hard to make money making games.   And yes the price of movies has gone up dramatically in the last several decades. Have you been to the theater lately?

And even though you need a specific skill set you can learn everything you need from home for free and relatively easily.   Maybe 10-20% of game making is ""fun.""   For starters, this article is pretty much required reading to get a grasp of what game development might entail.   Beyond that, game development is typically a large, frontloaded amount of work to make a functional thing, then a long, long tail of exhausting, tedious work to make that functional thing into an actual, polished game worth playing and buying. The frontloading part is often how you describe it, but the rest of game development is definitely not.   Do you like the idea of having to solve problems that have never been solved before, and if you can't solve them RIGHT NOW your entire business plan might collapse? You should check out this article for a nightmare-inducing story about one of the worst bugs ever. Every single game developer I know has a story similar to that one. It sounds exciting, but it is most assuredly NOT FUN to work through that.   You said you don't need initial capital, and that's sometimes true but often it isn't. Yes, you can use a desktop computer you already have and free software like Unity, Gimp, Inkscape, Audacity, and so on, but you can only go so far with that. How long until you need a better machine? How long until you need to pay for a pro license? How long until you need to hire an artist, a composer, an animator, a marketing specialist, a PR agent, a legal consultant, or one of dozens of jobs you didn't even know you had to deal with until it was suddenly upon you and requiring attention?   Beyond all that, the odds of success are so low, you're probably going to make at least half a dozen projects before anything makes even a fraction o the time and money you put into it back. What are you doing in the meantime? Probably working another job, unless you did somehow start with capital in which case your last conjecture is moot. That leaves nights, weekends, or both, which severely limits your social, family, and romantic life. Instead of seeing friends, traveling, or spending time with your significant other, you're sitting behind a computer late at night wondering why the fuck your game crashes when you jump three times in a row and fire your special weapon after the game's been running for at least 30 minutes.   Is it all worth it? It can be. There's no joy like seeing someone sit down with something you made and have fun with it. There is also no despair quite like pouring months or years of your life, your time, your money, and your well-being into a project that goes unnoticed, gets critically panned, or worse, gets critically praised and still fails to pay the bills.   If you or anyone reading this is thinking of making a game I encourage you to decide for yourself if it's worth it. Just don't go in thinking it's all fun, easy, cheap, and accessible. Certainly don't go in trivializing the effort involved or the psychological cost of repeated failure in hopes of eventual success."

IndieGaming,398jwu,Tech_Romancer,-2,Wed Jun 10 07:25:14 2015 UTC,"Dude. The point the guy's making only applies to people who buy games just because they're cheap. Most people buy the game on sale because they wanted it and it's cheap. Not just because it's cheap. If you want to charge more now, you will simply have less people buying it. Reason being, the people waiting for it to hit sale so they can afford it (and weren't concerned about ""trying out"" the game) won't necessarily want to pay more for that game beyond a certain threshold.   It's ridiculous how devs blame the market when they themselves can be so anticonsumer. Hey, people can ""demo"" our games now. Let's charge more for them! Believe me, the higher price point won't justify the low amount of sales. Also, the point of steam having to make games so cheap so that people will buy it without fearing risk is partly bullshit. Valve doesn't set the prices. People who buy games because they're cheap let it sit in their library for weeks generally before touching it if even at all. These are not the same people buying a game to try it and then asking for a refund. Those people are the people who generally can't afford wasting money on a shitty game and pricing your game higher will lead to them just not buying it and buying something cheaper instead. Unless your quality can justify your price. You're all so shortsighted. None of this matters unless your game is good. Otherwise refunds just mean you'll get 0 sales because everyone will be wanting their money back.   Edit: sorry for not compiling my thoughts into a well thought out response. I'm at work."

IndieGaming,398jwu,elitexero,6,Wed Jun 10 06:02:55 2015 UTC,"From his comment:   The salient point here is that with a no-questions-asked refund policy games can be priced appropriately instead of priced apologetically low. Fewer customers at a higher price point can possibly be enabled because you know that anyone who's unhappy can just get a refund.   The emphasis is that games are not priced appropriately because of the ""race to the bottom"" that game pricing has become. The easy fix of ""Make games people enjoy"" doesn't address this, and is beside the point. We're not debating the quality of the games, /u/rxninja includes the statement ""anyone who is unhappy can get a refund,"" he's commenting on the hope that now that we have this refund policy, indie developers (and AAA developers for that matter) can price their games closer to the actual value of the product rather than trying to survive in a market that is bottoming out.   Despite what you think of a game, games cost time, money, and effort to make. Titles that are considered great titles are at disproportionately low prices to the cost to make, with the required amount of sales becoming increasingly unrealistic to be a sustainable business model for anyone.  If the trend continues, the industry will again be at the mercy of a few big publishers because everyone else was drowned out by the low pricing model that iOS, Steam Sales, and Bundles have gotten everyone accustomed to, which would most likely lead to low-risk games with little to no innovation."
IndieGaming,398jwu,babyjeans,11,Wed Jun 10 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"Just as a sidenote: I've bought all of Puppy Games's games, and I mostly enjoyed them. They're really mostly just remakes of classic games with the Puppy Games art style. There's nothing wrong with that, and I've had fun with them.   A sale was a sale. Valve had shifted some of the burden of risk in trying unknowns out by simply eroding the price to the point where games have virtually almost no value at all.    I think a big part of the sales/pricing has nothing to do with the lack of refunds. With Steam you don't really even buy a game, you buy a license to use a game. If you get banned from Steam and lose your account, you also lose all of your games. That's it. Good day.  The thing is, people are more willing to deal with that - more willing to build up a stupidly huge library of digital items which they don't actually own - if they think you're getting a good deal. Then, if they buy full-price releases, their rationalization for any concerns they have over it maybe being more expensive than they like is that it's Steam. They trust Steam, and Steam has given them so much, so what's $60 between friends?   And it was all based on this one thing: a sale is a sale, and that’s it. But that’s no longer the case. A sale is only a guaranteed sale after it’s been played for 2 hours. That’s a bit awkward because the median time game play for most titles on Steam is only about an hour, which does rather beg the question why they chose a 2 hour window, but that’s part of the meta-problem Valve has, which I’ll get to.   Two hours or two weeks. Pointing out the mediam play time means nothing here. Two weeks out, you know how many sales you had today.  I don't think that this refund thing will ultimately change much in the way that consumers consume or how things are priced. People will still pile up games in their Steam accounts that they'll never play, and they won't be refunding them because, as statistics seem to indicate, a huge percentage of those games will never be opened anyway.  I think the idea that prices will go back up is just wishful thinking on his part. Steam's deep sales are at least partly a response to piracy, and they're the reason why people buy so many games on Steam. I mean, you can try to lead a revolution where prices are doubled and sales are rare, but I think a lot of people will scamper off (or back) to piracy if that takes hold. Which means it won't. The way things work now just isn't the way they worked a decade or two ago, and really, his success is due to that. A decade ago, his games would've been great flash games (tower defense, Space Invaders clone, Robotron clone), but I don't know how many people would've paid anything to buy digital copies of them. Now, people are more inclined to pay for them.  Part of the problem is that he's longing for a time that isn't coming back (and that his current company, Puppy Games, wasn't even around for). Access to everything for nothing is extremely easy to get, and things like Steam's sales, Netflix, and Spotify are industry-specific responses to that. It sucks in a lot of ways, but the business model for entertainment is pushing further in the direction of sell a lot and sell it cheap, and it's unlikely to ever go back in the other direction (due to a lot of factors, not solely piracy). You can argue over how you feel about that, but that's how things are."

Right now there’s no real hard and fast rule about what you can get refunded – at the time of writing it’s anything up to about 6 months old, regardless of play time, depending on your luck. But otherwise it’s within 14 days of purchase and under 2 hours of recorded running time for an automatic, no-questions asked, no-quibbles money back guarantee.   The assumption he's making (and that I'm with him on) is that they're eventually going to fix the system to follow the rules they've published. Later he's saying that at that point, games won't count as sales until they hit the two hour mark, ignoring the two week mark because that would weaken his point there."
IndieGaming,398jwu,Stubborn_Asshat,3,Wed Jun 10 21:38:06 2015 UTC,"The article is wishful thinking. As mentioned, AAA studios don't offer demos anymore yet their games certainly cost more than a few dollars and can offer more than an hour's worth of play.  I understand that a AAA studio will have higher costs to cover than an indie. But the point is the same; offering too much free content can significantly hurt sales, whether what you're offering is ""premium"" or not. It's hopeful thinking that there will be enough loyal customers who don't game the system and are willing to pay 10X more than they used to for the same game."
IndieGaming,398jwu,codesushi,3,Wed Jun 10 07:41:40 2015 UTC,"Good read.  One thing though, I don't think it's completely fair to put all the blame on Valve. Sure, the Steam model probably added to it, but I think there is an awful lot of competition out there driving down prices too. Even if the big discounts go away for awhile, someone will give in and lower their price to beat the competition, guaranteed.  And we have to keep in mind that just because somewhere someone made something, doesn't make it good, and doesn't mean they deserve to make a profit. If your game is genuinely good at what it's intended to be, and there is an audience for that, people will stick around. (Definitely not directed at this articles dev, by the way. I have their ""Titan Attacks"" game and I really enjoyed it.)  Personally, I think everything will settle down and devs might find they make more sales when customers can get their money back taking a risk on a game they aren't super familiar with.  Obviously Valve will tweak the refund system if it's just getting abused, they like money too!  Edit for clarity: I think devs putting garbage on Steam will quickly realize they can't get away with that any more, and devs making quality games will reap the benefits of costumers finding their games after refunding junk games."

Its not going to be easy, but if the good developers can game development should return to the profitable exercise it should be.  You know what will happen though? One of the good devs will be tempted by making those extra sales from a discount and they will crack. While ever they are tempted and drop their price for ""one more sale"", we'll continue our race to the bottom and video games will continue to get cheaper and cheaper.  As a consumer, I'm not ok with this. I'd prefer to pay $50 or $70 for a quality game made by talented people who are earning good money than $10 for five to seven shitty ones made by the only people willing to accept the wage."

People will pay $50 for a quality product, they won't pay $5 for a pile of trash.  OTOH, you have to understand that more people will buy at $5 than at $50, choosing the optimal price point is also part of running a business (just like the optimal launch time, eg not during the summer steam sale)."
IndieGaming,398jwu,WelshDwarf,9,Thu Jun 11 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"I think one thing that Valve has lost in its series of sales is the original point of the uber sale, specifically grabbing a ton of market share that you don't normally have access to. By putting yourself at say $30, you are pricing yourself out of the $10 market automatically. However by having a 66% off sale you can get a hold of quite a lot of that market (if conditions are right).  By having them all the time though, it is just causing people to think that is the normal price. (I am talking about you, games that go on sale for 75% off every time a sale comes).  Nothing wrong with having a huge discount like that once every couple years or so to capture some ""why not"" money, but even every year is setting yourself up to be ""I will just wait till its cheap"" which also hurts because a decent number of people who think that forget or change their mind.  Lots of words but tl;dr is the initial steam sale was a hugely cool thing for everyone but making it a yearly thing is causing pain for developers."

You're a consumer and you're ignorant (not because you're a consumer, before you take that out of context). I get that.

It’s censored! Not allowed"") but I strongly disagree. Political correctness isn't to be confused with basic politeness. You're selling players a product, people want some professionalism from you. They don't want to see you entering in a mental breakdown on Twitter over some 12yo troll.  If you can't handle the pressure on social media, I think it's better to leave it to someone else who's more calm and/or less involved in the project. On the plus side you'll have more time for what you truly can do: making awesome games.

Look a this week current Humble bundle to get the famous indie list. These indies are the same for years!  They made their success during the golden period (or got lucky), enough to get decent dev budget, and enough to absorb low price and refund by selling volume.  Player are not against Dev. And dev are not against player! If you think Puppy game are against player you didn't read the article. This is a symbotic relation. When player get more for less, it hurt dev. Dev won't be able to make good game.  Of course player always want more More MORE MORE MORE. But he should be aware that dev will have less Less LESSS LESSS money to make games. And games are becoming crap for that reason.  We shouldn't fight ! And player should understand the point of view of dev. It's in you interest to participate in a good, healthy industry if you want better games!

They aren't saying that people are abusing the refund system to only play their game for a bit and then return it.  The same time the refund system came into play, Valve also stopped a coupon deal for the game, and large majority of buyers bought buy the game through that coupon. That is the main reason why their sales have declined since the refunds were introduced. The author ultimately believes, at this point, that Valve made a good decision, and expects to get more sales than if the refunds didn't exist.  edit: Also, I'm a big fan of ultratron and think it is a great robotron style game.

That's not for video games, but let's ignore that and assume all software performs similarly. That article still does not support your claim that only 1% of the users who try the demo buy the product, it says 1% of the visits buy the product. What it does say, however, is that ""The average ratio of sales:downloads across all products is 4.5%.""  So of those who downloaded the trial(or demo), 4.5% bought the product if I am reading it correctly, not 1% as you claim. Might want to edit your article, but hey, 99% sounds so much cooler, eh?"

Most of those disc-based games are designed with a 40-60 hour playtime--either through an extended single-player campaign or by adding in a multiplayer component--to minimize the trade-ins at GameStop or EB or whatever. Smaller bite-sized games that don't have this concern are instead sold direct to consumers via PSN or Xbox's Marketplace.  So Steam has basically switched from being the latter to having an element of the former... except it's a whole lot easier to refund something from your couch/chair than it is to walk it back to the store.

But the system is way too complicated and frustrating for that. If you want to use the refunds like rentals, you're much better off pirating.  Ultimately, as a developer, you want your game to be enjoyed by people. Sometimes a game isn't for you and that's fine. If I had bought Civilization V today, I would probably have asked for a refund. It's not a bad game, it's just not for me. And that's fine.  As a developer, I'd rather have people exercising their rights as a consumer for a no-questions-asked refund then them slogging through a game that isn't for them.

What if a large number of consumers are asshats who have no appreciation of how much effort goes into making a game, and therefore have strange ideas about whether you 'deserve' the money?  Policies like this serve big retailers (in this case, Valve), partly because they can absorb the costs, and partly because a refund will probably just get spent on another game. The customer is happy, Valve is no worse off, but now 2 developers have had their game played but only 1 is getting paid for it. This is only good if you believe developers can afford to lose out on that revenue (and most can't).   What the writer is worried about is people buying games, playing them through and then returning them. This is in fact called a ""rental"" and used to be common practice in the 90s.

I don't want money from an unhappy customer and maybe a customer getting a refund for a bad (or just not for him) game will spend its refunded money on my game.  As for the deserving money thing I can see your point, most people don't realise what it takes to make a game, but again, people like that can just pirate it in the first place. Also, don't forget that money hasn't the same value for anyone (jobless people, poor country, etc...)"
IndieGaming,398jwu,Beldarak,2,Wed Jun 10 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, without the refund what would happen is: one developer get the money, the customer is unhappy. The second dev doesn't get money.   You're making the assumption that every refund is being made by an unhappy customer. We can see from the various statistics that it is probably not the case - some people just seem to want to get their cash back. Perhaps it's because they'll never play the game again, perhaps it's because they don't think the game is as good as it could have been. But they have still made use of the content and want to have that for free - which is a problem.   So I don't see the issue here. I don't want money from an unhappy customer   That's great. Steam should provide an option where you, as a developer, get to opt in to a ""refund if you're not happy - no questions asked"" system. But right now it's basically forcing that on everybody.   don't forget that money hasn't the same value for anyone (jobless people, poor country, etc...)   That's an argument for regional price differences or special case discounts - and without agreeing or disagreeing, I don't see that it's directly relevant here. A consumer normally has to make a decision on whether a product is worth the price before they buy. If they choose to buy, then they have anticipated that it will be worthwhile - however poor or rich they are. Sometimes they're wrong, but we don't usually allow them to back out of that for the simple reason that if everybody could get a refund for the service they used, merely by claiming they didn't like it, there wouldn't be enough revenue for people to provide those services. That's why the EU laws that people keep talking about here are explicitly written to prevent that sort of abuse, by making it clear that you lose the right to an instant refund when you start consuming the service (or in the case of digital goods, when you download them to your computer). We already know that people will take things for free if they can, which is precisely why stores put the paywall up front."

We can see from the various statistics that it is probably not the case   True, but those statistics you're talking about are in now way relevant. It's too soon to truly see the effect of the new policy. So I guess we're both wrong on this. Things should be more clear in the future, after the summer sales. I'm making that assumption about unhappy customer based on the fact that a dishonest gamer will pirate the game anyway (which doesn't involve him ""gambling"" money in it). And if this person ""try"" my game, I'd rather have him do that in good conditions on Steam instead of a pirated version which may not be up to date, containing spywares and stuff like that...  Leaving the choice to the developers could be a good thing, but it should be mentioned wether or not you're offering refunds on the store page. So it might hurt your sales just the same if you don't. As a gamer with limited budget, I'd be more willingly to buy a game which I know will offer refunds than another one that doesn't.   We already know that people will take things for free if they can, which is precisely why stores put the paywall up front.   I'm not convinced. Yeah, some people do that but then again we come down to the piracy thing. Before Steam become what it is today, I used to pirate a lot of games. Now that I actually can buy them easily (I earn my own money, I have access to all the games and not just shitty AAA titles at the local store,...) I'm willing to do so. When I buy a game on Steam I'm happy to support the developpers. And I can't really see why anybody would think otherwise since it's so easy to just go to the bay and get any game for free.

IndieGaming,398jwu,zouhair,-4,Wed Jun 10 12:17:55 2015 UTC,Damn money tainting everything.  Games should be about games.
IndieGaming,398jwu,RivetSpawn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:20:06 2015 UTC,Devs eats too ;)
IndieGaming,398jwu,Beldarak,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:29:15 2015 UTC,Ayee well I wish we could change our society in such a way that would allow them to eat and make games without money.
IndieGaming,398jwu,RivetSpawn,0,Wed Jun 10 06:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too :/"
IndieGaming,398jwu,Beldarak,-19,Wed Jun 10 04:42:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not reading all that. Would anyone summarize it, please?"
IndieGaming,398jwu,Saicotic,5,Wed Jun 10 09:05:32 2015 UTC,There's a tl;dr at the bottom. Not gonna post it here cus I don't like enabling people.
IndieGaming,398jwu,MysticKirby,-8,Wed Jun 10 05:07:59 2015 UTC,I already read that bit. Either the tl;dr or the article is worthless IMO. You can't accurately sum up 3000 words in one sentence unless it was 3000 words of fluff.
IndieGaming,398jwu,Saicotic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:39:53 2015 UTC,"Are you serious? That's the exact opposite of what is true in the real world.   If 3000 words can be summarised in a sentence, likely it's not an important read. The fact that something can't be easily summarised makes it even more likely it's a detailed, well-writted article.  Edit: I'm an idiot."

This is the first time I've done any covers from this game. It was at the request of a friend- one who deserves to have his requests taken, since he's been so good to me. :P I hope you guys like my arrangement of ""For River"" from the game ""To the Moon"".

IndieGaming,39am3w,SmallAnt,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:21:23 2015 UTC,Getting lots of sites to do reviews helps quite a bit. I've had big boosts in downloads and sales in the past just because a certain website ran a review on it. If you get enough small sites to do a review sometimes that leads to bigger name sites to do one.
IndieGaming,39am3w,DietChugg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"I tried a year ago requesting reviews, but most of the cases the sites requested to pay for a review. Only few sites accepted to do a honest free review. I'll do it again, but I want to ask where I can find a list with the sites who are offering to do honest reviews?"
IndieGaming,39am3w,InkPadStudios,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"Use Keyword ranking tools, try to find Keywords with high traffic for the lowest difficulty score. We used Appnique because we didn't have to pay for it. But I think Sensor Tower is better."
IndieGaming,39am3w,fridayjams,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"Hi, this is just something to add onto your list of things to do, but I run a site that helps game devs promote their games. Http://www.indieVideogames.com click on ""promote your game"". Thanks. (edited because I had a bad URL in it)"
IndieGaming,39am3w,_venkman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:04:35 2015 UTC,Great but... What exactly does it do to promote them?
IndieGaming,39am3w,fridayjams,2,Wed Jun 10 17:24:45 2015 UTC,"Well, first it links back to your game on the App store, which the more linkbacks you have,helps your ranking. Tons of gamers come to the site daily. Also all published posts are shared to the Twitter account with 5500 followers and Pinterest with 3500 followers, as well as Facebook and Tumblr."
