queen,3ds6ab,will_wolfy,2,Sat Jul 18 23:04:35 2015 UTC,The only logical next step here is to make a Bohemian Rhapsody parody of everything else.

queen,3doli7,Unimatrix7,2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:42 2015 UTC,"As a space nerd, I ended up watching the whole thing. xD"
queen,3dj0cz,rhye_cl,8,Thu Jul 16 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"Brian and Roger cash in again. A rehash of a rehash. The whole catalog was just remastered and released in waves on viynl. At this point the only new thing that you might be getting is the book. What new Queen information could possibly be in that book to justify what I'm sure is going to be an outrageous price? Do we really need it all over again in special, box set exclusive colored vinyl? The answer is no. Remaster something that the fans want not just the studio albums. Why not release the footage in the vaults from Knebworth?"
queen,3dj0cz,reztezbor,0,Thu Jul 16 20:07:47 2015 UTC,I wonder how Freddie would feel about this exploitation of his legacy...
queen,3dj0cz,coley1223,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:41 2015 UTC,Freddie said that he didn't care what they did with his legacy just as long as they didn't make him boring
queen,3dj0cz,reztezbor,3,Fri Jul 17 18:16:13 2015 UTC,Id do it if i were a vinyl geek. Still I  would have preferred a restored live concert release announcement.   P.S.          I'm afraid to see the price.
queen,3dj0cz,Mick_Wyld,3,Thu Jul 16 18:02:10 2015 UTC,£285.00 is $444.93 in USD. So yeah it's expensive.
queen,3dj0cz,BurningFlame08,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:34:12 2015 UTC,The shipping price is also really high I read.
queen,3dj0cz,loie519,3,Fri Jul 17 13:06:21 2015 UTC,"Handsome set, but pricey.  looks closer A VERY handsome set, but VERY pricey."
queen,3dj0cz,TheSpaldingMachine,3,Thu Jul 16 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"I am one of those Vinyl fanatics. This looks great but it's way too expensive. I would rather see them focus their efforts on releasing concert video like Houston 77, Hyde Park, etc."
queen,3dj0cz,Chuck_boyd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's time to dive into the concert archives and give us some classic shows. Video and music release would be everyone's first choice but im sure most of us (like myself ) would be happy for a steller show even without visual.  This site does an excellent job breaking down most of the shows captured either professionally or bootleg. I hope someone from the Queen camp takes notice of our community here and start selling what the fans really want to buy and collect.   http://www.queenlive.ca
queen,3dj0cz,Mick_Wyld,2,Sat Jul 18 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"There are two things I like in life: Queen and records. I actually own about 200 LPs and SPs from the 70/80s from them. But like u/reztezbor said: they're just looking for cash and that since 2011. It's really starting to annoy me and even though I'd love to own this because it's so beautiful, 400€ is too much."
queen,3dj0cz,twistnroll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:43 2015 UTC,Going to wait and see what the actual retail price is on Amazon after a couple months.  This comes out to about 25€ per album for 30-40 year old albums which is just absurd.
queen,3dj0cz,jakdak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:42 2015 UTC,retail price is on Amazon   Yup. Tht is what I did with Forever 4LP vinyl edition:  €99.99 in Queen Online Store with €50.00 courier delivery (and no other delivery options available for me)  vs  €98 in Amazon with free delivery
queen,3d6iya,Bi_Kinky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:25:24 2015 UTC,He's out in a short-sleeved t-shirt. London is a very cold and not so green place in January. I would say it was most likely taken around that time.

queen,3d370f,illumanaughty,5,Mon Jul 13 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"Like Brian May said the best thing about it was, it wasn't even a queen crowd and Freddie still had them eating out of his hand."

queen,3d370f,BigGreenYamo,4,Mon Jul 13 17:48:21 2015 UTC,The crowd for Radio Ga Ga was definitely on point
queen,3d370f,dna_monkey,3,Mon Jul 13 21:12:54 2015 UTC,"I listen to this performance regularly, and the thing that gets me is that there isn't a single bum note in the whole set. (Apart from the third note of Freddie's warm up on the piano, which sounds slightly off key.) I remember watching this live and thinking..""someone's going to get fired for the feedback in Crazy Little Thing"". Nice to see that this audio has been cleaned up and sounds great now."
queen,3d4yw7,PoppyOncrack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"Mother Love is more serious and gloomy.  A Winter's Tale is more happy and dreamy and delightful.  I'd say Mother Love is more of a farewell song than A Winter's Tale, though I can't really say which one of the two I like better."
queen,3d4yw7,KumoNin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, i honestly love both songs, A Winter's tale is lovely and has Amazing Vocals from Freddie, while Mother Love is gloomy and regretful, and also has Amazing vocals considering Fred's health at the time it was recorded."

queen,3d2kcv,Knickerbocker22,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:08 2015 UTC,anybody knows what does Freddie says ?
queen,3d2kcv,franciscocorrales,6,Mon Jul 13 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"Something along the lines of ""we're very happy to be back in Japan."" :)    Freddie is amazing, from the sounds of it he fell in love with Japanese culture after his first visit to Japan and he later learned the language to a certain extent. He went from half-decent but slightly strange pronunciation in ""Teo Toriatte"" to his song ""La Japonaise"" with Montserrat Caballe, in which his pronunciation is gorgeous. He apparently wrote all of the lyrics to it, as well, English and Japanese both."
queen,3ccc20,Joshawa119,2,Mon Jul 6 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"The energy at the concert is definitely lackluster compared to a real Queen gig, but I think most of that is due to the crowd and not the performers. The sound quality and stage performance was fantastic and I found myself suspending disbelief for a majority of the show. I would recommend you go, but with an open mind. Just don't expect Queen."
queen,3ccc20,codyshuttleworth,2,Tue Jul 7 04:27:07 2015 UTC,"I saw this one about a year ago and while it was good it was not the best I've seen. Perhaps seeing the real deal a month prior didn't help! Peter Freestone was in the crowd though which was interesting!  The best Queen tribute I've seen is an Argentinian band called Dios Salve a la Reina (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen_(band)). Absolutely brilliant on all levels, if they come back to Australia I'll definitely see them again."
queen,3ccc20,PorkHunt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:20:41 2015 UTC,"God Save the Queen (band):       God Save the Queen (Spanish: Dios Salve a la Reina) is an Argentine Queen tribute-band formed in 1998. The band's members are: Pablo Padin (vocals), Francisco Calgaro (guitar), Matias Albornoz (drums) and Ezequiel Tibaldo (bass).   The band takes their name from the United Kingdom's national anthem which was played on tape at the end of every Queen show while the band took their bows.

queen,3bvk3z,jelsomino,2,Thu Jul 2 16:46:55 2015 UTC,Dragon Attack is fucking awesome and the fanboy in me really hopes they find a way to play the kick ass live version in the credits after a Dragon-heavy Game of Thrones episode.

They still haven't even announced a live album with Adam, which surprises (and disappoints) me. This would be their first world tour that I can think of that they didn't release a live album/DVD."
queen,3bxrrn,AlexHeyNa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:31:45 2015 UTC,"I was (nay... AM) hoping they release more live material from the ""archives"" like they did for the Rainbow '74. Hell they can essentially do this every year in an anniversary style edition. I'd even prefer they don't go in order of year.  Youtube is flooded with concerts that would be awesome to have in Blu-ray  (even SD - BLURAY ) with remixed sound.  1979 crazy tour, South America 1981, The Works 1984. All of these and more deserve restoration and release."

queen,3ay63d,PoppyOncrack,2,Wed Jun 24 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, i forgot about Back Chat that's probably my 2nd favorite song from Hot Space, No.1 being Under Pressure,obviously."
queen,3ay63d,paulosham,2,Wed Jun 24 20:38:48 2015 UTC,I would like to hear how the album would have sounded if Roy had produced it.
queen,3ay63d,geekstone,2,Wed Jun 24 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"This is a badly produced album but as far as songwriting goes pretty decent as witnessed by the album On Fire Live At The Bowl . The Hot Space tracks live are much more ""Queen"" like."

queen,3aiwi0,PoppyOncrack,2,Sat Jun 20 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"Well the two are in the same vein - if Freddie died before Innuendo was completed, Was It All Worth It would've been his farewell song.  That said, The Show Must Go In is yards better without doubt."
queen,3aiwi0,tehsuigi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, If ''the show must go on'' hadn't been made, Was it all worth it would be Freddie's swan song, i kind of feel like ''Mother Love'' is his true farewell song, though, there's also an interesting contrast between T.S.M.G.O and Mother Love, too me, T.S.M.G.O feels like a somewhat hopeful song,especially the ''i'll face it with a grin,i'm never giving in'' part. as if Freddie had just a small sliver of hope that things would get better,but of course, Mother Love was recorded at a time when Freddie's ''Hope'' was ''gone'',and to an extent i feel  like it's probably Queen's most poignant song, especially considering Fred's condition at the time it was recorded."
queen,3aiwi0,geekstone,2,Sun Jun 21 15:12:21 2015 UTC,Was it all worth it is a good song  but The Show Must Go On is a masterpiece. It has amazing lyrics with some of Freddie's best studio work and to consider what he was going through while recording Innuendo it is a very fitting finale for the band.
queen,3afctq,BP0413,2,Fri Jun 19 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"This song is so overlooked, both by the general public as by a lot of fans. It's such a happy little tune. No big fireworks there just a small uplifting song."

queen,3800ki,loie519,20,Sun May 31 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"Reading between the lines, and going from what Roger and Brian have said, he no longer considers himself a public figure and wants to spend the rest of his life with his family in private.  John wanted to leave the group after The Works tour, and it was purely because of the huge success they enjoyed after Live Aid which prompted him to go for it one more time with the Magic album.  The Magic tour was supposed to be his last ever performance with the rest of the band — he even threw his bass and smashed it after the end of the last encore at Knebworth Park — allegedly storming off without saying goodbye to the rest of the band.  With the profits from the tour on top of his royalties for I want to Break Free, Another One Bites the Dust, You're my Best Friend, and other album tracks he penned, he had more than enough to live a comfortable retirement, but was only persuaded to record another studio album when Freddie became sick.  Freddie was always John's strongest friendship within the band.  It's no secret that John and Brian seriously disliked each other around The Game and Hot Space era, and that Fred Mandel and Freddie worked separately with John on much of the material they recorded around that time — with Deacon and Mandel producing almost all of the keyboard and drum machine tracks in a different studio to the one used to track the guitars and acoustic drums.  It's seems that words were exchanged between John, Roger and Brian that John found hard to forgive and was simply waiting for the right time, both contractually and financially, to leave the band altogether.  The fact that this took 10 years longer than he would have preferred is reflected in the fact that John's only involvement with Queen as things currently stand, is based upon the assumption he approves of everything done with the brand in his absence, but remains free as a shareholder in Queen Productions to speak up as and when anything done with the music he wrote for the group, or the use of his image in promotional media doesn't meet with his approval."

He was keen to finish off certain unreleased material, and to set up the memorial stuff but no more. Also, I think he experienced a certain amount of depression when Freddie died which contributed to wanting a quiet life - being able to live off the royalties etc. Generally speaking after being in Queen for so long, he'd had enough, and didn't feel he had it in him to keep performing and making public appearances etc"

Also if you really want the live shows, you simply HAVE to download them since a lot of them didn't get an official release. Personally, I'd go with vinyl. Nothing beats the vinyl experience for me: the big album cover, the smell of the inner sleeve, the shiny vinyl ... It's not expensive either as long as you aren't looking for rare stuff. The studio albums aren't exactly rare. However if you're looking for unofficial live recordings that's gonna cost ya."

queen,349lip,Chribbex,5,Wed Apr 29 11:51:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.   One of the rules at Live Aid was the bands couldn't use any pre-recordings. They had to play every bit of music live. Which, as I'm sure you guessed, is why they cut BoRap off after the first part. They did consider doing the opera part live, but they decided it just wouldn't work. So that's probably an indication that they've never done it live. It could mean that they've done it before and they didn't like how it turned out, but if that's the case, good luck finding some sort of recording of it."

queen,32zjao,shinjuddis,25,Sat Apr 18 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"What Adam has that Freddie didn't is range.  Freddie was incredible at singing like Freddie Mercury, but he didn't have the technical chops to sing in another style.  Even when he worked on Barcelona it was Freddie Mercury 'doing' the same style of singing as he did in a rock band except with an orchestral arrangement.  Whereas Lambert can change his timbre and breathing to bring less of himself to a performance and more of the song.  He is a technically very gifted musician whose instrument of choice just so happens to be his own voice.  BUT, in an area of musicology known as psychoacoustics, we can explain why Freddie is, objectively, a far more musical singer than Lambert.  This appears, on the surface, to be counterintuitive.  How can we say that someone who is technically more proficient than someone else, in a given area, is somehow less captivating when it comes to their actual performance?  But the secret here is the intensity of the performer, and their close emotional bonds to the music they're performing.  Adam didn't write Somebody to Love, Freddie did — so he had a much stronger emotional tie to the content of the lyrics than Lambert, and so more licence to convey that emotion to the listener — sometimes on an audience by audience basis.  Indeed, many musicians report a phenomena we might describe as being 'in the zone', where objectively we might say that a performance on one night was almost identical to a performance on the following night — and yet the musician feels as if the first night was far stronger than the second, because of the intensity they subjectively experienced 'in the moment' which was absent from one and present in the other.  Fred could turn on this almost magical ability to 'hold the audience in the palm of his hand' like a tap.  He wanted every single person in the room to be touched by the music.  Freddie was a conduit through which the true power of music pounded like a hurricane and trickled like a babbling brook.  Adam Lambert is just a really good singer."
queen,32zjao,SexWithTwins,3,Sat Apr 18 03:26:12 2015 UTC,"I don't at all understand the first part of your comment, about Adam ""bringing less of himself"" or his ""instrument of choice being his own voice."" I think the reasons Adam is so much better with the high notes than Freddie are  1) Queen's songs happen to fit more comfortably into his voice than they did into Freddie's. Freddie was naturally more of a baritone, though most of Queen's lead vocals were delivered in the tenor range. Adam simply has a higher voice.   2) More importantly, Adam has excellent singing technique, being able to produce powerful notes with excellent support and control without straining himself. Freddie, unfortunately, apparently never had formal vocal lessons, so his voice would conk out fairly frequently live.  With all that said, however, I much prefer listening to a decent live Freddie performance than one of Adam because I think the timbre and overall sound of Freddie's voice is far better sounding and more musical. Adam's voice, to me, sounds a bit annoying and fake (although he can do spectacular things with it)"
queen,32zjao,reevejyter,14,Sun Apr 19 07:12:37 2015 UTC,"Brian's just saying Lambert can reach higher notes than Mercury. That's a technicality. He's not dismissing Mercury at all, don't worry! :)"
queen,32zjao,rocketblitz,15,Sat Apr 18 02:04:16 2015 UTC,He also said in a live setting. Freddie would often go lower live.
queen,32zjao,Lucius_Funk,7,Sat Apr 18 03:42:20 2015 UTC,It's no secret that Freddie shied away from high notes during live shows. I think that's what May is referring to here.

queen,32t16t,albino_pirate,12,Thu Apr 16 14:06:39 2015 UTC,"As a die-hard fan of both bands, I believe that the two can't really be compared. They released their music in two separate periods of music.   The Beatles completely overhauled the landscape of popular music in their time. Queen had the advantage of having better technology to expand their craft. Both consisted of four extraordinary musicians that were each amazing in his own right, but if even one member left either of the bands, it would take a toll on the overall quality of their music. Prolific songwriting was also a shared element with the two groups. The two bands also had the strength of having distinctive vocalists.  Objectively, The Beatles were probably the better band, based solely on their influence (listen to the period between ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Abbey Road"" -- amazing stuff, lots of which you can even hear in today's pop music). Queen, however, is my personal favorite based on the sheer musicianship, personality, and their use of the studio as an ""instrument""."

queen,32t16t,Iksaiah,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:18:32 2015 UTC,"Hilarious video. You could argue that The Beatles were objectively better for whatever reason (breadth of genre, changing the landscape of popular music for their time, etc.) but I do feel Queen had a rather similar effect and as much if not more raw musical talent.  This could probably be argued till the end of time. The way I see it, while I have favorite Beatles songs, the bulk of the Beatles One album covers most of them (missing mainly stuff from the White album and Sgt. Pepper's, an album which has the privilege of being the first rock album I ever owned and listened to). But I have such a huge list of songs I simply love from Queen, my ""favorites playlist"" from the entirety of their discography (Queen through Made In Heaven right now, only missing A Kind of Magic and Queen Forever) is so long that it lasts me about 5 hours of continuous play last time I guestimated it, could be more. I've had to actively hunt for and remove songs just so it's not an ""every album in a continuous play list"" type deal. Very hard to make those decisions. And I'm discounting the few singles from the 3 CD Platinum Collection and Live at the Rainbow '74 2-Disc set (good God do I love that live set!).  You hear many of Queen's most familiar songs used at sport events and in advertisements constantly, besides being frequently played and popular favorites on local classic rock radio stations. Queen's music just has a really strong appeal that I think will render every song they've made a timeless piece that will still be heard and enjoyed by the majority of people regardless of their musical tastes for plenty of generations to come, especially among those who love music in all its forms."
queen,32t16t,Iruk_SNAFU,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:00:44 2015 UTC,"I got into Queen first and didn't always like or respect The Beatles, but eventually I became a fan and realized that I was wrong.  The Beatles were a huge influence on Queen. I mean, they influenced everyone, but Queen probably more than most. The eclectic experimentalism, the studio tricks, the harmonies, the combination of catchy melodies and artistic sensibilities - all owe a lot to the Beatles. And the band members have said as much. Even Deacon's bass style has a lot in common with McCartney.  I still prefer Queen, but I love the Beatles too and without them there'd be no Queen. And the White Album is probably my favorite by either band, but Queen has more albums I really like. So it's a hard question to answer. I do think Queen's albums tend to get overlooked compared to a lot of other classic rock bands, at least in America."

queen,32k5l8,zerocoke,2,Tue Apr 14 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"If i do decide to do it, I would have 3 others (bassist, guitarist, drummer) alongside me. Given my social interactions, I know quite a few musicians/choir members/band and orchestra members at my school. As for me, I am really interested in learning to play the piano, but for now my biggest strength is my voice.  I'd start with the piano, and sing ""Mama, just killed a man..."" and so on. Then the guitarist plays the rock solo, and when the opera section begins, we'll go backstage and relax/drink some water/whatever, and a screen behind us will play the music video for Bohemian Rhapsody. Then, once that ends, we'd all burst back out into the stage, hammer out the hard rock part, and then I'd return to the piano in my school's auditorium and play the rest of the song."

queen,30ylq0,ucfboss,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:18:33 2015 UTC,"From Album A Night at the Opera (1975) ""Love of My Life"" was written for Mercury's girlfriend at the time, Mary Austin, and is one of his most covered songs (there have been versions by many acts like Extreme featuring May, Scorpions and Elaine Paige). Mercury played piano (including a classical solo) and did all of the vocals with startling multi-tracking precision. May played harp (doing it chord by chord and pasting the takes to form the entire part), Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar (which he'd bought in Japan) and his Red Special. ""Love of My Life"" was such a concert favourite that Mercury frequently stopped singing and allowed the audience to take over. It was especially well received during concerts in South America, and the band released the song as a single there. When Queen and Paul Rodgers performed the song (specifically Brian solo) he sang almost none of the words and let the audience sing it all, continuing the tradition. (Wikipedia)"

Based on the casting they'll probably concentrate on the last years including the legendary wembley concert, the last recordings and his illness. It's good to know that people close to him are involved in the project and have the last say, that's a good sign and will help to make the project true to Freddies life...

queen,30ib9f,hosewater,2,Fri Mar 27 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"Adam Lambert by far but I saw them both and enjoyed both. But Adam is just a better fit, from both a vocal and showmanship perspective."
queen,30ib9f,jargonista,2,Wed Apr 1 02:41:24 2015 UTC,I don't care for Adam Lambert at all. I preferred Paul Rodgers

queen,2zx07x,mintlou,5,Sun Mar 22 16:47:30 2015 UTC,He wanted to end the song because the crowd sat on their ass all night. I've heard versions of that song that went on a while longer. I think Freddie fed off a crowd. That crowd gave him next to nothing.
queen,2zx07x,zerocoke,2,Sun Mar 22 20:58:19 2015 UTC,The crowd were bad that night and Freddie made several references to it. But he then approaches Brian mid-song to possibly end the concert?

It was commissioned by George Henry Haydon, who was head steward at Bethlem Royal Hospital at the time. He was impressed by Dadd's artistic efforts and asked for a fairy painting of his own. Dadd worked on the painting for nine years, paying microscopic attention to detail and using a layering technique to produce 3D-like results. Although it is generally regarded as his most important work, Dadd himself considered the painting to be unfinished (the background of the lower left corner is only sketched in), and as such added the suffix of ""Quasi"" to its title.

queen,2y2pry,joeobrown,4,Thu Mar 5 22:54:19 2015 UTC,"Back when he died the media were far less intrusive. As I remember it in those days it still wasn't socially acceptable to be openly gay so there was always speculation, Freddie was often referred to as being 'bi-sexual' in the media. Obviously he was a very private person as well, especially towards the end.  I remember there being a lot of media speculation about him being ill and the paperazi did get some shots of him looking very gaunt. But when it came it happened so quickly, I think there was only a day or two between it being announced he had Aids and him passing away.  To this day I think Freddie's death did a huge amount to shift society's views on homosexuality, the band were one of the biggest acts in the world and Freddie was one of the most recognised, respected and admired stars and for him to die made a lot of people think about their own values and how they regard others.   As I recall it the British media were very respectful following his death."

queen,2xdlwx,girlwithaguitar,14,Fri Feb 27 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"My personal criticism I'd make would be regarding Roger Taylor.  He's proven that he's quite a good drummer, but there are seemingly very few songs where he really unleashes that, and the drum beat in many Queen songs (especially their later ones) feels really lazy, and that he could do better."
queen,2xdlwx,ozzraven,5,Fri Feb 27 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"This.  Most certainly. I wish he flexed his muscles more, so to speak, in some of the drums beats that I believe he is/was much more capable of."
queen,2xdlwx,Bearninja36,4,Fri Feb 27 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"... and we could say this about the whole band in the 80's. Freddie's singing in the 85 tour, and some parts of wembley feels lazy. Brian licks are sometimes restrained and john's bass lines in some songs could be easily replaced with a loop. But that was the trend on the 80's pop"
queen,2xdlwx,NyuuTwo,3,Sat Feb 28 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"I can't help but wonder, after listening to the Brian May Band, what Queen would have been with a drummer like Cozy Powell.  Also, with a very few exceptions, I find RT songs to be entirely skippable."

queen,2xdlwx,Bearninja36,2,Sat Feb 28 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"As a very bad drummer, I listen to songs like Liar, Brighton Rock and lots of other early stuff and am very impressed by his skill. Then I can play I Want To Break Free perfectly, and hear a lot of just standard boring drumming in nearly every song post-A Night at the Opera. I feel the same can be said for Deacon's bass lines too. There are flashes of brilliance here and there, but a lot of times it's just lazy. They took more song off than say, Keith Moon and John Entwistle did."
queen,2xdlwx,ejabno,8,Mon Mar 9 13:42:44 2015 UTC,I personally think that they steered heavily towards overtly commercial pop in the eighties. The Miracle is a perfect example of this. Instead of brilliant compositions we got filler like Party and Khashoggi's Ship and Rain Must Fall. And I really hate the awkward fade in the title track.
queen,2xdlwx,nougate,2,Sat Feb 28 01:25:56 2015 UTC,"Signs of the times?  I think maybe they were just trying to throw an album together as quickly as they could. Was It All Worth It is a pretty good song though.  When I was a younger Queen fan, I found the 80s stuff embarrassingly cheesy. I've learned to embrace the cheese. After all, ""Don't Try Suicide"" made it through the filter....they can't all be winners."

queen,2xdlwx,LeftHandedGuitarist,6,Fri Feb 27 23:14:15 2015 UTC,I know it's subjective but I love that they don't take themselves too seriously. That's why we get gems like Seaside Rendezvous and Melancholy Blues.  Just be glad these fantastic lyrics didn't slip into the final mix.

queen,2xdlwx,greatqueenrat,3,Sat Feb 28 08:00:51 2015 UTC,"The only thing which has ever annoyed me about Queen is their live set lists. They do the same songs in the same order every show, and placed far too much emphasis on the singles. The Magic Tour was the worst culprit for this, here is where they became a ""greatest hits"" band and it's and one of the most boring periods of Queen's live career (made all the more sad that it turned out to be their last tour).  You can understand my joy at the release of Live At the Rainbow '74. I rate it as the most essential live album ever released.  Pearl Jam are an example of a band who get it completely right. Since the early 90s, every show they've done has had a completely different set list and no song is given more importance than any other. You can expect to hear b-sides along with their latest single and obscure album tracks."
queen,2xdlwx,KimberlyInOhio,2,Sun Mar 1 16:10:07 2015 UTC,Thank God It's Christmas should be about half as long...and half as repetitive.
queen,2xdlwx,KimberlyInOhio,2,Sat Feb 28 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"The obvious one is that most of their 80s albums are inconsistent. To make things worse, with some of their strongest 80s songs the album version isn't the best one (for example, I Want to Break Free's single cut is much better).  Roger Taylor's songwriting is hit-and-miss.   Their live setlists changed very little within any given tour and became increasingly hit-heavy over the years. Also, Freddie's voice sometimes struggled live.  I'm not wild about Brian and Roger's ""Queen+"" ventures, especially without John."
queen,2xdlwx,dusmeyedin,2,Mon Mar 2 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"I think the use of synthesizers in the 80s was rather annoying. Not only since I personally dislike synthesizers and find them lazy when writing music, but also since some of Queen's earlier albums proudly bore the label ""No synthesizers were used on this record"" since synthesizers were becoming a big thing in the 70s. Feels rather hypocritical, but I still love a lot of their later stuff, synthesizer or not, but I prefer their earlier work."
queen,2xdlwx,NyuuTwo,2,Thu Mar 5 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"How about the Platinum collection. I don't know who this is made for. two songs from sheer hear attack, one from queen 2 and none from queen 1. The 3rd cd is just a bunch of junk I would never associate with queen and would never care to listen to. They could have put some early songs on the last cd, to let people who don't know much about queen to hear some of (in my opinion) their best work."

It's not amazing or anything like that but there are some decent to good songs on there. Cool Cat is a nice foot-tapping tune, a chill tune. I think Dancer isn't bad for what it is, same with Back Chat.  But I totally get why people don't enjoy it. Although, when you're active for almost 2 full decades, you're bound to swing and miss a few times when you get up to the plate. That happens."

queen,2xdlwx,Inthenameofbulsara,2,Sat Mar 7 05:39:15 2015 UTC,My critique would be their lyrics. A lot of Queen songs have lyrics than are filling space instead of telling us something meaningful. It started around News of the world I think
queen,2xdlwx,jargonista,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"I feel as if they got too lazy in the 80's-as if they were just filling a contract. Their 70's albums were way better.  Now, if you asked me my criticisms of Freddie himself, I could give a whole list lol"
queen,2xdlwx,werrt1234,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"I get why you have Brian and Roger sing the lead on some songs. And those songs aren't bad, and they do a good job. But, guys, you have Freddie Mercury in your band. Just, let him do it.  Also, one big critique is that they were so many light years better live than in the studio. Prime example: Dragon Attack. Weird and somewhat punchless on The Game, but the Rock Montreal version is one of my favorites."
queen,2xdlwx,danarbok,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're looking for. Their studio work is some of the best from any band in my opinion. That's why we get the overdubbed solos from Brian and the operatic backing vocals that define 70% of their songs. I can see how they have more punch live though, if that's what you're into."
queen,2xdlwx,Bearninja36,2,Sat Feb 28 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't get me wrong, they were great in the studio. But often the live versions of their songs are still superior. Somebody To Love is another example."
queen,2xdlwx,danarbok,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:19:21 2015 UTC,"I personally like the studio version of somebody to love way better, so many voices!"
queen,2xdlwx,husker_who,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:28:24 2015 UTC,"Oh yes of course that part is better on the studio version, you're right! But the power and soul that Freddie put into it live was so moving! When he goes for it and nails it in the Montreal show, that's magic."

queen,2wvysk,too_long_didn_t_read,2,Tue Feb 24 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"It's Late:       ""It's Late"" is a song written by Queen guitarist Brian May and performed by the band for their 1977 album News of the World. The song was May's idea of treating a song as a three-act theatrical play, and the verses are called ""acts"" in the lyrics sheet. It makes use of the tapping technique a few months before Eddie Van Halen's use of the tapping technique on the Van Halen album. May told Guitar Player Magazine  that his use of the tapping technique was inspired by an unnamed bar-band guitarist from Texas. Tapping had also been previously used by other players, notably Steve Hackett of Genesis. The song is notable for its length and heavy, wide vocal range (E3-E6), bluesy guitar riff, and using the previously mentioned technique.

Discovered it and added it to my library in October of last year, it has about 150 plays since then.. so I've listened to it almost once every single day since then, on average - and unlike some other songs in my library that have a fuckton of plays, it isn't because I ever put it on repeat for hours on end. Like, You're My Best Friend has some more plays than that, but that's in large part because I spent like an hour or two listening to it on repeat once - Seaside Rendezvous I've never done that with; I've just chosen to listen to it on a fuckton of individual occasions."

queen,2wvysk,Gossack,1 point,Sat Feb 28 07:59:23 2015 UTC,"If you want to get into their deeper material, I reccommend just listening to their albums. Especially since a lot of their songs are very deliberately sequenced. If you haven't heard A Night the Opera, start with that. Then just go back to their debut and move chronologically at least through The Game, and don't skip Innuendo either.   They have very few bad songs up to 1980. After that they were less consistent and became more of a singles band, though even the lesser albums still have their strong tracks. And Innuendo is a late return to form."

queen,2vorms,dusmeyedin,4,Fri Feb 13 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"Actually I think the rest of that quote is important..    The reason he didn’t want to say this was because it was one of his own songs, and he didn’t want it said that he only liked his own music and not any of the other band members.   He always saw himself as just one of four people in the band, which was important because it allowed the rest of the group to grow significantly as songwriters as him and Brian had been in the beginning."
queen,2vorms,drowse,-1,Thu Feb 12 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"They never saw themselves as four people in a band when it came to songwriting. When it came to songwriting, they were just Queen. That's why the songwriting credits for their later albums just said ""Queen."""

queen,2vorms,franciscocorrales,1 point,Fri Feb 13 14:46:47 2015 UTC,"It is true that they later agreed to share all writing credits, but in the early albums, Queen's members definitely had some territoriality regarding individual song credits. Brian May had gone on record saying that there was some chilling effect on collaboration if your name wasn't associated with the song, and it had a monetary effect as well (part of the reason why Roger pulled the ""lock myself in a cupboard"" stunt regarding BoRap's B-side).  They ironed out the differences in the end and shared credits to split the proceeds more evenly in the final albums, yes, but it's a stretch to say the band was ""never"" one to specify authorship. It's probably more fair to say Queen encountered the problem (common to many bands where each member was extremely creative) and eventually found a workable solution.  Posthumously, even the ""Queen"" shared credit songs have been linked to individual members for composition, but that seems more an issue of record keeping and giving insight to the band's creative process, than necessarily to claim financial or artistic credit for any one member."
queen,2vorms,dusmeyedin,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:40:17 2015 UTC,I think they credited it to Queen because they knew Fred had limited time left and they didn't want to spend it arguing. I think I heard that on a documentary somewhere.

As for Delilah, that's understandable, but it was the end of Freddie's life so that's a bit more forgivable if you ask me.   Khashoggi Ship would be my choice as my least favorite Queen song. A very close second would be Don't Lose Your Head."
queen,2vg6dv,FloydPink24,2,Tue Feb 10 20:03:05 2015 UTC,Don't Lose Your Head is a pretty dumb song but its one redeeming feature is that electronic/guitar sound part. Uber cool.
queen,2vg6dv,JoshDimmock,2,Tue Feb 10 22:49:10 2015 UTC,That is the coolest part of a very bad song. You're right.

queen,2vg6dv,Nineteenletterslong,4,Wed Feb 11 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, Play The Game was the first synth song! But Break Free is very synth-y, but it's probably a top-five song for me!"
queen,2vg6dv,ThaneOfMordor,3,Wed Feb 11 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"If the synths bother you, look up the live version - it's much more guitar-driven (like a lot of their 80s songs live)."
queen,2vg6dv,Diegosmiles_,2,Wed Feb 11 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"Even though the song is just meh, I think the music video more than makes up for it.  It's so hilarious!"

queen,2vg6dv,SgtFinnish,2,Thu Feb 12 02:53:52 2015 UTC,"Lazing has that intentional old-timey feel to it. I can appreciate the work that went into it, but Seven Days sounds like it was written by a lovesick 12 year old."

queen,2ukiko,MegaLordmuffin,9,Mon Feb 2 22:51:44 2015 UTC,It would be insanely difficult since half the song involves synced choirs interplaying with an extreme delay effect. They would have to do it Bo Rap style and leave the stage while a backing track plays. Love the song but it's not worth it for them to do.
queen,2ukiko,DTrainSmash,10,Tue Feb 3 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"The only time I can think of off the top of my head was at the free Hyde Park concert, and you're right the quality isn't great.  I think they didn't do it very often because it's technically difficult, it takes a lot of time, and it probably wasn't a big hit."

Some tribute acts have vocalists that sound very very similar to Freddie but I highly doubt Brian and Roger would appreciate a man prancing round stage pretending to be their dead friend!  Adam Lambert is a great vocalist, although he doesn't sound identical at least he's unique and doesn't try to be somebody he's not. I think Adam does justice to the songs and is the closest we're going to get as of now, but it's unlikely that they'll ever find a vocalist that all of their fans would appreciate."
queen,2u3f8v,TomM96,9,Fri Jan 30 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"Saw them at MSG this year, nobody can replace Freddie for sure but Adam makes a damn good try at it. His vocal range, the style, the showmanship - I don't know if any other vocalist could have come as close as Lambert.   Thinking back, it seemed less like a Queen concert and more like a tribute to Freddie. The songs where they sprinkled in video & audio of Freddie from previous concerts was eerie, sad and epic all at once."
queen,2u3f8v,ManWithGoldenGun,12,Thu Jan 29 17:10:16 2015 UTC,He's closer to Freddie than Paul Rogers was at least.
queen,2u3f8v,jakdak,3,Thu Jan 29 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"Common sentiment. He's not Freddie, he's Adam.   Even if someone could sing exactly like Freddie, he wouldn't be. He'd be called an impersonator.  Also, DAMMIT, they started with One Vision! Really jealous, they started with Stone Cold Crazy when I went. I was hoping for that One Vision. :("

queen,2u3f8v,franciscocorrales,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"Great voice but not as powerful.  He doesn't put on a performance like Freddie, but then he wouldn't be able to without imitating Freddie, which he would criticised for.  Also, Freddie's musicianship was important to the way he sang and improvised on stage. Of course, Freddie wrote a lot of the songs and chose to sing all the songs the way he did. Adam can't deviate too much from what Freddie originally sang. Freddie could have though.  If you go expecting any more than a really good karaoke performance from Adam, then you'll probably be disappointed.  From what I've seen, Brian and Roger aren't giving it as much effort as they used to either. No costumes, no laser shows. Don't get me wrong, I'd bite your arm off for a ticket and I still love them, but they could be making a much better job of it."
queen,2u3f8v,Geekmonster,3,Thu Jan 29 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"I went a few months ago. There were lasers, there was smoke, Brian had some sort of gold-cape-thing. I think the only reason they might be making 'less effort' is because they're approximately 110 years old."

queen,2u3f8v,gyropyro,-1,Fri Jan 30 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't go to a Lambert queen gig if I was given free tickets. Nothing against Adam, but it's not Queen."

queen,2te7w7,GwonamLord,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:18:34 2015 UTC,Wembley is heavily doctored and was one of the worst nights on the tour.
queen,2te7w7,froboy456,2,Sat Jan 24 11:44:23 2015 UTC,I don't see how. They went all out and built the biggest and best stage that any band had ever done. They used 13 cameras to capture every angle of the stage. Also they had to add extra days on the magic tour to accommodate all the people who wanted to see them. They wanted to keep adding days because of the overwhelming demand for them live.
queen,2te7w7,GwonamLord,1 point,Sun Jan 25 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"and this has to do with their performance how?  the tour itself was amazing.  most gigs were amazing.  Hell, even Wembley 1986 beats most 1984-1985 gigs.  They chose the worst possible night to film (Zurich was also a rough vocal gig but they were in the minority on this tour thankfully)."
queen,2te7w7,froboy456,1 point,Sun Jan 25 09:22:44 2015 UTC,"The camera set-up is essential on how it makes the performers look to the DVD version of the concert. Sure it's not related to the audience that is there live. They really did go all out. I think that your opinion is in the minority about the filming issue or rather lack of. I have never had anyone else complain about what night that they filmed. I disagree with your statement on this being the worst time to film. If you where filming this concert, what would you have done differently?"

Friendship with Freddie Mercury of article  Kenny Everett:       Freddie Mercury and Kenny Everett became close friends over the years they knew each other. First meeting in 1974, Kenny had invited Freddie on to his breakfast show on Capital FM; the pair hit it off instantly. During the 1970s, their friendship became closer, with Everett becoming advisor and mentor to Mercury - and Mercury as Everett's confidante, helping Kenny to accept his sexuality. Throughout the early-mid 80s, the pair continued to explore their homosexuality - in addition to drugs - and while the pair were never lovers, they did experience London night life on a regular basis together. During this time Kenny and Freddie became involved with Nicolai Grishanovitch and a Spanish waiter named Pepe Flores.

I'm afraid the collaborations with other singers really hasn't cut it for me.   Adam is the closest thing I think we can ever expect to a replacement for Freddie. Excellent singer? Check. Flamboyant stage presence?. Check. Androgynous looks and faintly ridiculous outfit? Check.   Folks we have a winner. :-)

Adam is an incredibly talented bloke, and I definitely enjoyed some of his solo stuff, but I don't always like the way his voice sounds like on Queen songs. The only song I thoroughly look forward to hearing him sing is The Show Must Go On.   But, anyway, as I said, he's incredibly talented in his own right."

He's not for everyone, but he's certainly selling the tickets and getting attention for songs that Freddie would have wanted to live on."
queen,2r18i8,gyropyro,2,Thu Jan 1 22:43:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I like that Adam is not trying to be Freddy. He can sing the songs well and gets into his performance, but does not replicate what Freddy did. I like that Queen incorporate recordings of Freddy in certain songs ."
queen,2r18i8,coltonnashville,1 point,Fri Jan 2 06:55:55 2015 UTC,I had the chance to go see Queen with Adam.  Didn't go because... it's Adam Lambert.

queen,2qybdh,BP0413,2,Wed Dec 31 21:09:40 2014 UTC,"Wait, so was this guitar work from Brian May?  I recall hearing he didn't like the song too much. But did he actually do more complete guitar backing and then pull them out?"
queen,2qybdh,dusmeyedin,3,Thu Jan 1 13:28:37 2015 UTC,"IIRC, he thought the song was too light and need a heavier backing track so he took it home and made this in a night to try and prove his point. It was never used or released and I think in the end he preferred the original."

queen,2qqsq5,LockedInACage,9,Mon Dec 29 20:44:04 2014 UTC,"Listen to the Greatest Hits, Volumes 1 and 2 (although there are several versions of Queen's Greatest hits). If you like a particular song, I would suggest listening to the album on which it was originally released.  In general, I would describe Queen's albums in the following manner:  1973-1975 (Queen I, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack, A Night at the Opera): Queen was developing their  sound in this era; although their dominant genre could loosely be classified as ""glam rock"", the music is, at times , all over the place--but entertainingly so. This era didn't produce as many radio-friendly pop hits, but if you're looking eclectic, eccentric, musical brilliance, then you should check out these albums.  1976-1979 (A Day at The Races, News of The World and Jazz): After the release of Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen was a legitimate superstar band and was seriously cranking out albums, sold-out live tours and chart topping hits. Queen continued to write songs from a diverse range of genres, but the music doesn't quite have the experimental, unstructured feel as do some of the earlier albums. This is probably Queen at, or near, their prime.   1980 (The Game, Flash Gordon soundtrack)- In The Game, Queen took their music in a new direction and finally started using synthesizers. The result was one of their-- if not the most -- successful albums. Compared to their earlier works, the album is a bit understated, but features a fantastic sense of rhythm (e.g., Another One Bites the Dust, Dragon attack). Queen is now one of the most popular acts around the world, and rightfully so.  1982 (Hot Space)- Emboldened by the  success of The Game, and influenced by outside forces, Queen goes hard on synth-pop beats, much to the dismay of many fans (though I personally love the album). Queen loses its popularity in the U.S. and never really regains it. Keep an open mind for this one.   1984-1989 (The Works, A Kind of Magic, The Miracle)- These albums feature a lot more formulaic pop songs, many of them quite worthy; however they do not display the sheer breadth of originality and musicianship that the band displayed in the 70's.   1991 (Innuendo) - Queen returns to form a bit by releasing a very original album, albeit one that is difficult to categorize. Most of the songs do not have the catchy hooks that characterized a lot of their material from the 80s.   1995 (Made in Heaven) - This album is for serious Queen fans only. It mostly consists of re-worked demos that lay around in the archives. While us Queen fans are happy to have any and all Queen material released, this album cannot, and does not measure up to any of the preceding albums that were recorded while Freddie was still with us.   2008 (Cosmos Rocks) - This really isn't a Queen album (as it didn't involve either Freddie or John) , so I wouldn't bother with it (since nobody else did)."
queen,2qqsq5,snakers,8,Mon Dec 29 23:11:22 2014 UTC,"Well. From my personal experience, and some may not agree with this, I started listening to the 3 Greatest Hits albums to listen to more their more 'mainstream' (if you like) songs. And then I gave each album a chance to see what other songs I liked.   To be honest, I'd probably start in chronological order - starting from Queen to Made In Heaven. But if you want my recommendation, I'd recommend you listen to The Game as there are some killer sounds on there. Good luck!"
queen,2qqsq5,Riqitch,4,Mon Dec 29 21:25:01 2014 UTC,"Many 'mainstream' songs are really great, so I think that's a good start (and you should know some of them from radio etc.) Also The Game is one of my favorites too. Conclusion: Just Listen!"
queen,2qqsq5,New_Master,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:02:30 2014 UTC,"I agree!  I started listening to Queen in junior high when my brother gave me his ipod, and it had the Greatest Hits album on it.  It was amazing and I was hooked onto Queen since.  I liked it because it had a lot of their really popular stuff that you'd hear at like sporting events (We are the Champions, We will rock you, Bohemian Rhapsody), and it has a lot of other good songs on it!"
queen,2qqsq5,heyitsyoo,2,Tue Dec 30 05:06:13 2014 UTC,"Can't go wrong with their 70s stuff really. In my experience, A Night at the Opera is what initially got me hooked. The Game is a good album too, it's their first album to feature synthesizers.  I also recommend just listening to every album in chronological order."
queen,2qqsq5,KumoNin,1 point,Tue Dec 30 18:18:03 2014 UTC,"Jazz was the first album that I ever listened to all the way through at once.   Really, you could pick up most any Queen album for a first time listen (I'd probably recommend an album from the middle of their works though).   Jazz, Sheer Heart Attack, A Day at the Races, A Night at the Opera, and A Day at the Races are all good albums.   Queen I and Queen II are their first two albums. These are pretty different from the rest of their albums IMO. You should listen to these two albums together because they're pretty similar but different from the rest of the albums."

queen,2qqsq5,paulosham,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:12:47 2014 UTC,"If you are up for a chronological tour, Get the recently released Live at the Rainbow cd. It is a great summary of their first three records. Plus better production than first studio release. The four on the floor take from these performances helped me have a greater appreciation of the studio cuts.   I did this when i first really got into the band. I had GH and CLASSIC then picked up Live at Wembly around the time it came out. No regrets."
queen,2qqsq5,Mick_Wyld,1 point,Tue Dec 30 17:52:15 2014 UTC,"Although not my very first, (The Works was), I'd say Sheer Heart Attack. It's the blueprint for later Queen albums and where they really hit their songwriting stride. Killer Queen is the perfect pop hit, Brighton Rock and Now I'm Here the big Brian rock tracks, In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited the epic number. Then there's Roger's growling Tenement Funster, part of the rather marvellous 3 song melody of that, flick of the Wrist and Lily of the Valley, the lamenting ballad. Misfire is the jaunty John pop song, and Bring Back That Leroy Brown the fun Freddie song, a la Crazy Little Thing. Stone Cold Crazy is the relentless, breathtaking one. It's a cracking album and, if you like Sheer Heart Attack, I'd say you're pretty likely to like later albums. This isn't to do down Queen II, which is one of my favourites and is astounding... I just think that this is more typical of the Queen we know and love, and more of an 'in'."

Maybe because Tenement Funster is such a powerful piece and Flick of the Wrist is so dark, I don't know. But it's nice to know that other Queen fans also hold it in high regard."

Medley cover?), but I'm not a big fan of how they pretty much ditched the original guitar solos entirely for their own noodling. Don't get me wrong, I love it when bands try to shake up the songs they cover, but this comes off as more ""trying to turn the song into something else while also trying to keep it the same"" and it's confusing and really weird feeling."

queen,2qg27h,KumoNin,2,Fri Dec 26 19:44:46 2014 UTC,I don't think that's actually Queen.
queen,2qg27h,Oldgrain,2,Fri Dec 26 19:45:39 2014 UTC,Kind of sounds like some kind of unpolished demo. I have some not-so-well-known demos at home and will give them a listen tomorrow or sunday
queen,2qg27h,BurningFlame08,1 point,Fri Dec 26 21:34:19 2014 UTC,"I also, don't think this is Queen. The singer sounds like Tim Staffel (which it isn't). Definitely Queen influenced though."

If you have a look at the Live in Montreal concert you can clearly see Freddie run up to Brian with a smile on his face as the song is about to start, making sure it starts off well. Someone on this subreddit told this story a year ago or so, and Ive tried to find the recoding ever since.  Thanks man!"
queen,2q10f4,lightring3,2,Mon Dec 22 02:15:30 2014 UTC,The facsimiles of the memorabilia are absolutely wonderful. Things you never knew existed... avid Queen fans and casual listeners alike will be enriched by these mementoes.  Merry Christmas and happy reading!

queen,2q0j9j,SheepwithShovels,3,Sun Dec 21 23:29:55 2014 UTC,"^ This is probably the definitive answer.  Many people dismiss John as mainly a root/riff player, but in fact, several Queen songs have complex, melodic basslines. One that many don't usually think about is ""You're My Best Friend""; it may not be very fast, but it is surprisingly intricate. IMO, the same applies to ""Play the Game"".   ""Stone Cold Crazy"" is also especially difficult because the bass has to keep up with the speed of the guitar and the drums. It's even more difficult when the tempo is increased in live situations (Houston 1977 comes to mind...)."

He played the song slowly (at first) and asked us to listen to the lyric. So, I know this song meant a lot to him, but he undoubtedly has lots of favourites for different reasons."
queen,2oicm5,Geekmonster,5,Sun Dec 7 01:40:16 2014 UTC,Oh nice. This is the info I was looking for when I made this thread. Did he say anything about Freddie knowing the song was about him at the time it was written?

queen,2odchu,mulldoon1997,10,Fri Dec 5 15:37:56 2014 UTC,"I don't disagree. Some of the best pop music writing ever, imo.  Really - pop is short for ""popular"" music.  The Beatles (well and Elvis, Kinks, etc) set a standard of what pop rock & roll music was for decades, and Queen followed in that format.  However, I'd say pop is just one aspect of their writing.. A Kind of Magic is a much different song than say, The Prophet Song, but its just two different sides of the band.."
queen,2odchu,drowse,7,Fri Dec 5 18:30:34 2014 UTC,he has also said there sell outs

queen,2odchu,comhcinc,4,Fri Dec 5 18:36:06 2014 UTC,Yeah they are a pop band. Pop=popular. It is comes from who gets on the Billboard Top 100 chart. Which Queen has been on a lot. So was Nirvana and Metallica and Tupac.
queen,2odchu,AngusWolfe,5,Fri Dec 5 18:35:39 2014 UTC,"To confine Queen (or most great artists) to one genre is a bit silly. It's not like Leonardo only did portraits, even if his most famous picture was one."

queen,2o8elm,DarwinAckhart,2,Thu Dec 4 05:14:30 2014 UTC,It may be the 'Rah mix' from Greatest Hits III.  That starts with a whisper like verse.

queen,2o8elm,rbwildcard,1 point,Thu Dec 4 14:39:23 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking it's the one from Classic Queen. The more common one that is played on the radio and such is different from this version.

queen,2o5qj5,Lucius_Funk,7,Wed Dec 3 15:15:17 2014 UTC,"I love it. It's my second favorite Queen album behind Innuendo.  I especially love ""If You Can't Beat Them"" and ""Jealousy"" not to mention ""Bicycle Race"" and ""Fat Bottomed Girls"". ""Don't Stop me Now""...god. It's all so good. However, my biggest guilty pleasure in terms of Queen music is most definitely ""Mustapha"". It's wonderfully strange and I love it as much as I love ""Seaside Rendezvous"" on Night at the Opera for the same reason. The only song on Jazz that's just meh (in my humble opinion) is ""Fun It"".   Regardless, it's a great album, friend! It's certainly a gem."
queen,2o5qj5,TheSpaldingMachine,2,Wed Dec 3 16:42:03 2014 UTC,"Phew!! Really thought I was the only one! I agree, the production isn't quite there but I also feel that way about NOTW (another great but sometimes overlooked album).  I didn't even realise how much I liked Jazz until I realised I was going to that CD more than the others...Took me by surprise as I'd always said Sheer Heart Attack or A Night at the Opera were my favourites."
queen,2o5qj5,jargonista,1 point,Wed Dec 3 23:06:25 2014 UTC,"Oh man, Fun It is one of my favorites from Jazz. I've never been a big fan of Jazz. I put it lower than Hot Space, but higher than Flash Gordon."
queen,2o5qj5,DuderonymousLex,5,Thu Dec 4 09:25:06 2014 UTC,"Jazz is a totally awesome album. The songs are all different and it does indeed display a transitional phase. I do, however, have a problem with the production. I think the drums sound soft. I think all the songs that are not singles sound muddy and compressed (ok, except Dead on Time). This is the most in-need-of remix LP in their catalog. Would love a crack at it someday (oneday) ..."

queen,2o5qj5,zerocoke,5,Wed Dec 3 23:06:36 2014 UTC,"Jazz isn't my favorite, but it is the album that made me fall in love with them as a group. The bit where all the previous songs on the album cut into the outro of ""More of That Jazz"" is brilliant."
queen,2o5qj5,nougate,4,Wed Dec 3 16:27:17 2014 UTC,"I like ""Leaving Home"" and ""Mustapha."" I think this album represents their real turn towards pop. It's not my favorite album but it shows them moving away from the more involved and dramatic towards the simpler, hook-oriented music they began digging into with ""NOTW.""  It's still a great album and I don't begrudge anyone holding it up as a favorite."
queen,2o5qj5,ozzraven,2,Fri Dec 5 01:53:36 2014 UTC,"I think a lot of it comes down to Jazz being the first or second Queen album I ever bought. I had the platinum collection as a kid but it was a while before I bought the albums. Jazz, A Night at the Opera and Sheer Heart Attack were my first (I think)."
queen,2o5qj5,ozzraven,3,Fri Dec 5 10:20:45 2014 UTC,Jazz has always been my favorite Queen album. Every track is great but I guess you could say that about every one of them!
queen,2o4t3m,nougate,5,Wed Dec 3 06:50:10 2014 UTC,The Prophet's Song into Love of My Life on A Night at the Opera would be my favourite.

queen,2o4t3m,BlueShoeLover,2,Wed Dec 3 08:17:35 2014 UTC,"A little known one would be In The Lap of the Gods -> Stone Cold Crazy. Very subtle transition, but a prominent one nonetheless!  I wish they did this kind of thing more, because it adds a layer of cohesiveness to the album as a whole and ""ties"" the music together to a much greater effect."
queen,2o4t3m,shearhartattack,2,Wed Dec 3 13:50:43 2014 UTC,I swear Queen had a special talent at this. I was watching Rock Montreal in theatres and somehow the transition between Killer Queen and I'm In Love With My Car just worked so well.

Even if by ""hidden"" you meant ""not on a greatest hits compilation,"" it's still difficult to answer, because I would have to say, ""All of them.""  Every Queen song you don't know about is a hidden gem, and I envy those of you who have yet to listen to some songs for the very first time."
queen,2o01mv,two,3,Tue Dec 2 02:17:04 2014 UTC,What I would do to be able to forget about all their songs and listen to them for the first time all over again.

What he will not do, however, is dance like a trained chimp just because some super-fan is having their best day ever by pestering him for autographs and ""selfies"".  He's a very private and quite man who just so happens to be one of the four faces used to market a music publishing franchise worth hundreds of millions a year.  He can't be ""on"" all the time.

Things like autographs and selfies are part of the gig and when you're as big a band a Queen is, you don't shun your fans. Now, I'm not saying he should be happy or give in to people who are ruining his supper with his family and the person below didn't really say their situation having to do with their not getting an autograph, but plenty of artists, especially from that era, tend to shrug off fans in any situation be it because they have a huge ego or because they simply can't be bothered.  That being said, beyond the whole autograph/being a star thing as far as my opinion of him, I'm also including a lot of what he posts about on his blog or reasons for him being in the news as of late. He comes off as a crotchety old man having temper tantrums.  I'm sure that in private conversation he is quite lovely but the things he posts and the and the way he comes across in the media or the way he handles things in the online realm in general portrays him to be a prat."

Judging by the amazing filmic sound at the Music Centre, I'm pretty sure things like White Queen and Black Queen would've been even better than they are, had they been recorded at De Lane Lea (MC) and mixed at Trident (with those phenomenal A consoles).   1972-1973: At Trident, they used the studio house Steinway piano (surely a D model, 8' 11 3/4"" Concert Grand). Considering they recorded downtime and probably couldn't bother setting their equipment, it's also very possible that Roger had to use whichever drums were in the studio at the time (i.e. Hayman or Ludwig) instead of bringing his own. The famous Marquee photo shows a white piano in the corner, it could be the famous Bechstein used by Fred 3 years later on Bo Rhap, considering the Marquee club was also (AFAIK) having some sort of special deal with Jacques Samuel (where the white Bechstein would also be rented from).   1974: Live, Fred would use whatever was provided by concert promoters. As for the studios: Wessex had a Bechstein at the time, AIR a Steinway (but Queen only used the overdub room, where there was no piano) and Trident another Steinway. Apparently most of their backing tracks were at Rockfield though... nowadays they've got a Yamaha at the Quad and a Bösendorfer at the Coach (or viceversa), but there's nothing to confirm or deny that was the set-up 35 years ago. There was also a jangle piano, apparently a Chappell which was (again apparently) at Rockfield since it would also be used for Rendezvous (and Rockfield are the only studios used in both 'SHA' and 'ANATO', IF the liner notes are correct).   1975: A white 9 ft 2 in Bechstein was hired (hence the credit, 'Bechstein Debauchery'), possibly meaning they didn't require the studio house pianos (Bösendorfer at Sarm, Steinway at the Roundhouse, Yamaha C7 at Scorpio, unknown at Rockfield, Lansdowne and Olympic). For the Bo Rhap video and the Hammersmith gig, the same white Bechstein was used. For the rest of the British 'Opera' tour (as well as the 'SHA' world tour early in the year), Fred played whatever local promoters got him (a Steinway for most 'Opera' gigs, Kawai and Yamaha at some Japanese venues). Speaking of Yamaha, Fred got a baby-grand (5'  think) for his flat during their spring trip. He'd use that, apparently, to write Bo Rhap.   1976: Rented pianos for 'Opera' world tour, and the white Bechstein again for Best Friend video and Hyde Park. Apparently, the 'Opera' formula was repeated for 'Races' and Fred (and Bri) ditched the house pianos in favour of the white Bechstein. Still, just in case (or just to document as much as possible): an enormous and beautiful brown Bösendorfer at Sarm (used for the Somebody to Love video), another Bösendorfer at the reformed Wessex (those studios underwent a makeover in 1975 which is why Queen couldn't use them for 'Opera', part of such makeover consisted of buying a new piano with a blank cheque given to Tim Friese-Greene, who BTW was the second engineer for this album) and ... I've got no idea about Richard Branson's Manor in Oxfordshire. BTW, for the January Man from Manhattan sessions, Fred probably used Sarm's Bösendorfer rather than the white Bechstein but it's just an educated guess... after all, those pianos do sound alike especially if the player's the same person.   1977: For 'Races' tour, Fred played whatever was supplied. For 'News' album, a Steinway at Basing Street and perhaps the Bösendorfer at Wessex: some time ago, when Wessex were closed, the piano was also auctioned, claiming it'd been used by Freddie Mercury and other people. If the claim's true (it could easily be just for the auction's sake), then it means he used it for either 'Races' or 'News' (for 'SHA' the Bösendorfer wasn't in the studios). But apparently Johnny Rotten had puked on it (another recollection claims he merely poured some spirits over the keyboard) some time around 'Bollocks' and deemed it unusable, forcing the studio managers to hire a Yamaha C7 while the Bösendorfer was being cleaned. So it's all very confusing anyway. When the band travelled to America for the winter tour, Freddie bought a 1972 Steinway D and since then used it for every Queen concert except for one.   1978: Apparently, Fred used his Steinway for the recording sessions. No idea about house pianos at either studio anyway... it seems that there was another Steinway at Mountain during those days. As for Super Bear... it's too bad Rick Wright isn't around anymore, he'd surely remember as he used it extensively for his first solo album and 'The Wall'.   1979: The piano at Musicland was almost definitely a Yamaha C7 - ELO's '77 release (recorded there) credits it and Brian's playing a Yamaha on Butterfly in 1985. So, we can be almost certain that at least in the 77-85 period, there was a Yamaha C7 at Musicland (unless during the 78-84 period it was swapped or something, which indeed isn't as unlikely as one may  think).   1980: Yamaha for 'The Game' (if my theory above is correct), Steinway for the tour and for 'Flash' it's definitely a Bösendorfer Imperial since the lower notes on the title song (the only one with piano) only exist in that model (which has an extra octave on the bass). Now, there were two Bösendorfer's at The Townhouse and one at Music Centre (previously known as De Lane Lea), Brian could've played any of them. The small Steinway at Anvil and the big Bechstein at Utopia weren't, AFAIK, used for the recording sessions.   1981: Apparently, once Queen bought Mountain Studios (was it on '78 or '79?) they had Fred's Steinway as 'house' piano, so it was used by whoever recorded there as well, except when Queen were touring, in which case David Richards had to hire a Steinway from Zürich - fortunately for him, most acts were more into synths than pianos at the time, so they didn't mind anyway. For Under Pressure, it must have been the tour piano, then (IF what I've researched and concluded is correct).   1982: Steinway at Mountain and touring, Yamaha at Musicland.   1983-1984: When I asked the head of the road crew, he told me he didn't remember which piano was used in LA or whether Fred had brought his Steinway. Again, Yamaha in Munich and Steinway during the tour but, AFAIK, when Fred moved to New York he had a piano (which one?) delivered to his hotel suite, which he'd then use to write I Was Born to Love You. Was it his touring Steinway? Was it his London Yamaha? Was it something else? No idea.   1985: Yamaha C7 for 'Bad Guy' and early 'Magic' sessions, Steinway for all concerts (including Live Aid, indeed it was apparently Fred's piano which was used by most of the artists including Phil Collins, then it was changed by Elton's white Yamaha for his and McCartney's sets). Some white baby-grand for I Was Born video.   1986: I was also told some time ago (and haven't been able to confirm or deny it) that Queen had made some sort of special arrangement with Yamaha which included them using Yamaha drums (as seen in the Magic tour), Yamaha synthesiser (One Vision, A Kind of Magic, Who Wants to Live Forever) and Yamaha piano (regardless of the studios). I can't (and probably will not be able to) confirm if they actually replaced the pianos at Mountain and The Townhouse by Yamaha. I suppose it'll remain unsolved at least for a while. For Fred's 'Time' sessions, Mike must have played Abbey Road's legendary Steinway.   1987: For 'Barcelona', Mike probably used two Steinway's: one at The Townhouse and Freddie's at Mountain. No idea if he recorded anything on either one of Townhouse Bösendorfer's.   1988: There were Steinway pianos at Townhouse, Mountain and Olympic (one each), and probably those were used for all related projects (Queen's 'The Miracle', Brian's 'Back to the Light' and The Cross).   1989-1990: 'Innuendo' was recorded at Mountain (allegedly housing Fred's Steinway) and Metropolis (having a Yamaha C7 - apparently it's still there nowadays and they claim Fred used it as well).   1991: No piano was used for the three songs written after 'Innuendo' (though there's something in Mother Love that may have been either acoustic or sampled, or digital), and apparently Roger took Fred's Steinway after he died (but when after? 91? 92? 93? Does anybody know when were Mountain sold to David Richards?) and had it at Cosford Mill for at least 'Happiness'."

queen,2l7y9c,Jawa411,2,Tue Nov 4 02:27:02 2014 UTC,"The true Queen fan's Bohemian Rhapsody? I will go with Bohemian Rhapsody, and I do indeed consider myself a true fan.  Just because March of the Black Queen is lesser known song, and it came before Bohemian Rhapsody does not mean it is better. I see so many people saying that true Queen fans does not like Bo Rhap, and so many people saying that you are not a real fan if your favourite song ever is not March of The Black Queen.   I do not consider it their best song ever, nor do I consider it above Bo Rhap. Yes it is good, and has some great vocals and harmonies and captures the essence of the early Queen really well, but seriously... People need to get over their hipster self and stop circlejerking so hard."

queen,2l49v3,mintlou,1 point,Mon Nov 3 10:16:11 2014 UTC,"There is in fact a meaning behind Bohemian Rhapsody.

On the night before his execution, he calls for God in Arabic, ""Bismillah"", and with the help of angels, regains his soul from Shaitan."

Drowse has never been one of my favorites, but then again I'm not a huge fan of Roger's songs in general."
queen,2kzk26,FloydPink24,1 point,Sun Nov 2 07:11:30 2014 UTC,"Roger's stuff is admittedly pretty hit and miss. Some of it is pretty awful (Fun It, More of That Jazz, The Loser in the End), but there's some really strong material (Drowse, Radio Ga Ga, Fight From the Inside) and some very interesting other compositions (Tenement Funster, Sheer Heart Attack, A Human Body). Oh, and I'm in Love with My Car is so fucking fun.   Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll is a fair reworking of Roll Over Beethoven too. Its problem, like all of the original album, is the dreadful mixing and overall quality."

queen,2kfjcy,BrianBoyko,8,Mon Oct 27 03:21:02 2014 UTC,"Here in Britain we are much less metric than in continental Europe. We still mostly use feet and inches for height, stone for weight and talk about pints of milk and beer - all the road signs use miles etc.  Probably temperature is the one exception, where most people these days will talk in Celsius unless they're maybe 50-60 years old +. Keep in mind that the song was written in 1979, and some basic digging shows that the weather forecasts by the Met Office started using Celsius as well as Fahrenheit in 1962, then fully changed to Celsius in 1970. Whilst that may seem like a long time before the song was written, the band's parents would definitely have used Fahrenheit and they were almost certainly brought up using imperial measurements almost exclusively.   TL;DR: Britain uses a weird mix of imperial and metric + the song was written 35 years ago when Fahrenheit was much more commonly used.

queen,2kfjcy,EB_CCC,1 point,Mon Oct 27 03:53:24 2014 UTC,"Section 11. Other sectors of article  Metrication in the United Kingdom:       Before the Hodgson Committee, the metrication process was already in operation. One example was the Ordnance Survey, the national mapping agency for Great Britain, which initiated the Retriangulation of Great Britain in 1936, using metric measures.  A metric National Grid was then used as the basis for maps published by the Ordnance Survey from World War II onwards,  the War Office maps having had a metric grid since 1920.  The Ordnance Survey decided on full metrication in 1964. The best-selling 1 inch to the mile range of maps started being replaced with the 1:50000 range in 1969.  The metrication of Admiralty Charts began in 1967 as part of a modernisation programme.  As of 2013 [update], road and street maps with primary scales in inches per mile were still being produced by the company Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas.2]     Interesting: Metrication | UK Metric Association | International System of Units | Imperial units   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

queen,2kfjcy,Somethinginthefridge,1 point,Mon Oct 27 21:17:24 2014 UTC,"He'd lived in the UK for 15 years when the song came out. The terms you use, among other things, tend to change when you've been surrounded by people who use those terms for a long enough time.   He was also raised in a boarding school in India, where, at one point, Great Britain had influence, before moving to the UK, which was probably where he learned his English, if he hadn't already learned it from his parents.  Since he was born in 1946, and Great Britain still used Fahrenheit up until 1962, it's fair to say he was probably taught and raised to use Fahrenheit, not Celsius.  TL;DR: Even if he wasn't from the UK, it's very likely that he was taught to use Fahrenheit in India in the boarding school.   Edit: And when OP says Freddie Mercury was from the UK, while that is wrong, he means he lived in the UK for the majority of his life and that is where most ""uneducated"" non-Queen fans believe he is from."

Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack.  I remember my older brother buying albums (vinyl) in order and being excited to listen when he brought them home. I remember the first time I listened to 'A kind of magic.' I wasn't allowed to stay up to watch live aid (I was 9 at the time), so I missed that. I missed Queen's Australian tour because I was too young.  I was on the school bus when I heard that Freddie died. I had to hold back the tears because the other kids were making jokes about Freddie. I remember wanting to smash one kid's face because he said ""Good. Another dead poofter."" That made me so angry. Here I was, totally gutted, aching inside, and no-one else cared. No-one to share and grieve with. That was a hard day... well, every day was a hard day for me, in high school, but that stands out as one of the worst.  So... while I was alive through their 'live prime' (I think their 'recording prime' was their first 5 albums), I missed it."

queen,2ivbqb,django933,3,Fri Oct 10 16:53:14 2014 UTC,I'm not sure if it actually means anything. Queen songs were full of nonsense lyrics!  The only thing I can think of is that it's in reference to the nursery rhyme Fee-fi-fo-fum (was that Jack in the Beanstalk?) because there's a fairy tale type element to the song.
queen,2ivbqb,FloydPink24,3,Fri Oct 10 17:17:37 2014 UTC,"This is very likely the source.  It's an old rhyme for kids, and it even appears in Shakespeare, but it's associated with giants and fantasy tales, as a chant or noise made by bad guys.  So the Black Queen is herself something of a monster, and her Bad Boy enforcer is also similarly corrupted."

These toxins include scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which cause a bizarre delirium and hallucinations,  and are also used as pharmaceutical anticholinergics.

queen,2irwaf,TheKevinShow,10,Thu Oct 9 17:10:48 2014 UTC,"George Michael is an amazing singer, and I don't think anybody disagrees. But I don't think Brian, Roger, and John would've let this happen. It would have been incredibly disgraceful to replace Freddie, one of the greatest (if not the greatest) frontmen of all time. While George Michael would've been a worthy candidate, it just wouldn't have been right.  They handled it the right way. It would've been cool to see a Queen + GM tour, though."
queen,2irwaf,BP0413,-1,Thu Oct 9 17:34:15 2014 UTC,I don't know if it would have been disgraceful. It wouldn't have been the first time that a popular band replaced a member after their passing. Was it disgraceful for Brian Johnson to become AC/DC's new frontman after Bon Scott died?
queen,2irwaf,BP0413,7,Thu Oct 9 19:30:35 2014 UTC,"I'd have to respectfully disagree. While you bring up a good point with the Bon Scott analogy, Freddie was such an essential part of the band that Brian, Roger, and John had the good sense to know that Queen would be unable to continue without his presence. Obviously, I'm biased being a huge fan, but in my opinion, Freddie, in his 20+ years with the band, was Queen. He made such an indelible mark on music marketed under the Queen name that it would have been worthless to continue in the same form without him. Also, with Queen being one of the most beloved bands in the history of rock, it probably would have been an insult to replace him with somebody else. As much as I like AC/DC, I don't think Bon Scott ever came close to Freddie's level in terms of influence."
queen,2irwaf,AppleTeaCake,3,Thu Oct 9 20:01:52 2014 UTC,"As a fan of both it would be confusing. When attending a concert for Queen + GM I'd be wondering if I am going to hear any Wham or GM songs. And if not, does that mean GM would never tour with his own stuff because he is busy touring and singing Queen songs?"
queen,2irwaf,jakdak,1 point,Thu Oct 9 20:46:35 2014 UTC,"It would have better than the Q+Paul Rogers stuff.  Part of the issue I think is that the rest of the band (Or Brian/Roger vs John at least) wasn't getting along- so I don't think there was ever really an interest in continuing after Freddie passed.  What I wish had happened is that Brian and Roger had just formed a new band with a different name, found a new singer, and continued on.   This would have left ""Queen"" being Freddie and allowed Brian/Roger to continue in new directions."

queen,2i6lyg,Bwuhbwuh,12,Fri Oct 3 12:46:41 2014 UTC,"I was a bit skeptical about it, too. I'm not a fan of Lambert's at all. He's a magnificent singer, rivaling Freddie himself. But his stage persona just bothers me.  Then I saw them in concert. Trust me, if not by the first song, you'll be in by the third. He's got the voice and the stage presence for a Queen concert. His stage presence is nothing compared to Freddie, but I think that's good. He doesn't overshadow the band and it makes the show about Queen, not Adam Lambert singing Queen music.  All in all, it's a remarkable show, and if you're a Queen fan, you'll enjoy it immensely."
queen,2i6lyg,AlexHeyNa,3,Fri Oct 3 13:52:49 2014 UTC,"Alright, thanks a lot! Looking forward to it nonetheless!"
queen,2i6lyg,themcp,4,Fri Oct 3 14:17:54 2014 UTC,"I didn't think it was going to be amazing, I just didn't want to let it pass me by without taking my one chance to see two of the original members of Queen perform. I wouldn't have known Adam Lambert from... well, from Adam.   They rocked.  Seriously, it was far better than I imagined it could have been. Brian and Roger are every bit as wonderful as they ever were. Adam far exceeded expectations, and is probably the best possible living fill-in for Freddie there can be. I felt the show was respectful of the legacy of their music, and of Freddie. Adam gave homage to Freddie, but didn't try to clone him, performing with a bit of his own style and making the music fresh instead of being a bad imitation. As an example: at the end of concerts Freddie would wear, or place on the stage, a crown, like the one in the logo. Adam appeared at the end wearing a crown as well, but a very different crown, one glittering and more feminine... a queen's crown. It remembered Freddie in the action, but didn't pretend to be him. I respect that. I respect Adam Lambert for that. And let me tell you, that man can wail. Ooh, what a voice.   Roger sang a number of songs. To hear ""days of our lives"" sung by him brought a totally new light to it, to hear it coming with love from an old man as photos of his late friend appeared on the screen behind him, it was very moving. He brought his son, who played drums while Roger walked around the set and sang. They also had a drum battle. His son is good.  Brian, as usual, was epic.  All told, it was one of the best musical experiences of my life, and I'm way beyond glad I went."
queen,2i6lyg,ManWithGoldenGun,4,Sat Oct 4 01:33:39 2014 UTC,"It's an Epic show, I saw them at Madison Square Garden and they blew the roof off the place.  Nobody can be Freddie, but Adam puts on a good who. Brian may might melt your face as well, you've been warned"

queen,2hcbl1,Geekmonster,2,Thu Sep 25 06:15:20 2014 UTC,"Don't Try So Hard (and the contrast this provides at certain points during the song)  In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited (studio rendition, the 1986 falsetto is way inferior and the non-falsetto live versions just sound wrong)  We Are The Champions (studio, check the multitracks, the first ""fighting"" is sung in falsetto, the second in full voice. The third fighting is sung lower, think ADATR tour phrasing)  Bohemian Rhapsody (there's more falsetto there than one might think, the multitracks reveal a lot of this, but it's quite audible in the album mix too.)  Killer Queen (the parts in the album version where he does falsetto. in fact one of my favorite studio vocals by Fred for some reason.)  Somebody To Love (studio version, some parts, sounds beautiful, favorite part: i got nobody left to belieoweeoowieve)  Love Of My Life (specifically the ""hurry back, hurry back"" part. like an angel)  You Take My Breath Away (both the main part and the layer of background vocals)"

Heard it in an isolated vocal track from a multitrack version of the song, and was blown away by how subtle it was and how I hadn't really noticed it before."
queen,2h13im,exidy,2,Sun Sep 21 12:44:04 2014 UTC,"This reminds me of when I got into Queen at about the same age, 9 years later I'm still hooked. My dad took me to see them and Paul Rodgers when I was 10 and it was the most magical night of my life. Great to see Queen are living on after my generation :D"
queen,2h13im,TheRedBull28,2,Sun Sep 21 14:56:21 2014 UTC,"Wow! I thought I was young when I saw them with Paul Rodgers! I was 13! Crazy that there are 7-year-olds going to their concerts. There's really no other band out there that captures such a wide spectrum of an audience. Literally everyone enjoys their music, including my 86-year-old grandmother!"

I'm sure it was meant to be a nod to Freddie, but it came across as him trying to be like Freddie, because he doesn't put enough of himself into the performance.  I know I sound like Simon Cowell, but I'm just being honest. And if the name of the show is any indication, I guess they don't care about any of that stuff, anyway. They just care about how good of a singer they are. And if that's the case, he did an incredible job."

queen,2gu9v4,elderpo23,10,Fri Sep 19 06:57:12 2014 UTC,"I agree the cover is gorgeous. The album itself is horrible money-grabbing rubbish, repackaging songs we already have with 3 new pieces. I'm sick of this.   And they haven't even included all of the Freddie + Michael songs. What's the point?"
queen,2gu9v4,LeftHandedGuitarist,7,Fri Sep 19 10:18:27 2014 UTC,"There Must Be More To Life Than This is one of the Freddie/Michael songs. Still, this is depressing. They pushed this over a year and a half ago like it was going to be a whole new album of unreleased tracks and now we end up with very few new songs on a ""greatest hits"" style album. This is infuriating."
queen,2gu9v4,Batwaffel,4,Fri Sep 19 13:17:19 2014 UTC,"Having listened again to the tracks, I really strongly dislike the mix on There Must Be More To Life Than This, and, as with the Rainbow package, THERE IS TOO MUCH AUTO-TUNE! Freddie did not need it, and so hearing it plastered over both the live album and these tracks is really sad in my opinion...."

Didn't Brian say the tracks that weren't ""new"" were being re-worked in some way or did I completely misread this from somewhere? I mean if these songs are re-worked in a way that makes them completely different and unique compared to the originals, that would potentially make it worth buying..."
queen,2gu9v4,LeftHandedGuitarist,2,Fri Sep 19 17:21:31 2014 UTC,"The press release is confusing here. It does seem to say that the songs we know have been reworked in some way, but I think it could be poorly worded.  At any rate, it's nice to see Drowse getting some recognition."
queen,2gu9v4,twistnroll,3,Fri Sep 19 18:06:37 2014 UTC,"Let Me in Your Heart Again has been on repeat here and I love it. But you guys are right, it's so disappointing for the rest of the songs!"
queen,2gu9v4,rom211,3,Fri Sep 19 13:40:12 2014 UTC,No vinyl.  Not too serious of a release.
queen,2gu9v4,zvezdan,3,Fri Sep 19 14:03:04 2014 UTC,"OK, so all these bands, the Beatles, Ultravox, U2, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, David Bowie, even Led Zeppelin can make decent releases of their rare material, either as bonus discs or stand-alone anthologies, and Brian and Roger somehow still believe that Queen fans are suckers who will be paying for the Greatest hits-like releases with an odd remix/new song here and there infinitely...  Not to mention the fact that this was announced as a proper collection of previously unavailable tracks all the time. I've been into Queen for 15 years now and I'm joyfully skipping this ripoff."

queen,2g40rm,snakers,-3,Tue Sep 16 20:43:52 2014 UTC,I'm not very impressed by the responses so far. Do people understand the songs they listen to?  Drowse and Life is Real are definitely among the most depressing songs.

The recent tour and this release I think are going to force some people to reevaluate Queen as a live act. We have always known they were close to if not the top live band, I can really only say The Who before Moon passed or The Rolling Stones were better, but a Queen is really close."
queen,2fl5yc,geekstone,2,Fri Sep 5 22:28:19 2014 UTC,"Cheers for the heads up. That sounded lovely! Liked the acapella bit towards the end.

queen,2e56ye,Spudhead1976,1 point,Thu Aug 21 22:36:14 2014 UTC,"Do you think this is an accurate source, the source being the Daily Mail that is? I only ask because I truly do not know. I am somewhat unfamiliar with daily mail's reputation.   Also, this seemed like an incorrect figure to me:   to whom he left his magnificent £20 million Edwardian mansion in West London as well as the bulk of his £9 million fortune.   I could have sworn I read elsewhere that Freddie's total net wealth was something like 60 million or so? Perhaps I am mistaken? Plus, I think it might be a typo, at least, to suggest Freddie was watching DVDs of himself in 1990-1991."
queen,2e56ye,og_penson,2,Thu Aug 21 12:42:54 2014 UTC,"Well the article was written by David Wigg, whom Freddie trusted and Mary as well, apparently. (He did the interviews on Disc 10 of The Solo Collection) That being said the article he wrote and what ended up being published are not necessarily the same thing. Things get edited....  The bit about the band seems strange though.   I don’t think the remaining members of Queen have ever reconciled themselves to it. I don’t understand it. Because to me it’s bricks and mortar. I try never to be jealous or envy people.   What exactly is she talking about. The bits before and after are about jealousy and money, but still what is ""it""?  The ""He left the band a quarter share of the last four albums"" is quite vague as to exactly what that means.  The article seems to try to make it sound like there are resentments between her and the band, but I highly doubt that. Since Freddie was what connected them mainly it's not surprising that there isn't much contact (or none) now, and after all she's got a picture of Roger with a tea kettle hat on display at her house, so how bad can it be...."
queen,2e56ye,drowse,1 point,Thu Aug 21 15:03:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah...it was a strange article, I think. I think the bit about Freddie's fortune was inaccurate and it just seemed strange to me. I don't know. I would love to see any response to this article from Roger or Brian (John, too, but I know how much wishful thinking that is). I know the article is over a year old at this point but, still, I would be very interested to hear their thoughts on it."
queen,2e56ye,ozzraven,1 point,Thu Aug 21 15:07:43 2014 UTC,"Parts of it seem a bit too much, but David Wigg, who wrote the article, was pretty much the only journalist Freddie would let close to him.  I'm not so sure about Mary and how she felt about Brian & Roger walking away from her, that is her opinion. I'm sure Brian and Roger would have a different take on things anyway.  What I start to realize is now that we've reached the point where Freddie's death is now closer to the time that Queen started (1970 - 21 years) than it is from 1991 to now (23 years).   But that's the testament to what he did and what Queen did/does still.."
queen,2e56ye,elle918,2,Thu Aug 21 14:57:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it seems interesting to me. I wonder what Brian, Roger or even John's take on Mary's claims that they sort of wandered off and didn't bother with her would be. I would be extremely interested to hear their side of it."

But I can understand for those who didn't get to see the band with Freddie, this is the closest they can get.  I respect Brian and Roger's decision to keep touring, just like I respect John's decision to retire, and even though I'm not an Adam Lambert fan, I've heard he does a good job and is respectful to Freddie's memory. That's good enough for me. I won't be going to the show, but I hope those who do have a great time. That's what Freddie would have wanted, I think."

The second one was The Magic Tour in '86. Both shows were spectacular, and still rank as the two of the best concerts I've ever been to."
queen,2dqjqi,Diegosmiles_,7,Tue Aug 19 06:30:52 2014 UTC,"Ive been a Queen fan for years and years but never got to see them in concert so when they started to tour again, you damn right I bought a ticket. And I had the best time of my life. One of the best concerts I've ever been to. No, Freddie was not there, but I felt him there! The whole arena went nuts; it was deafening. To rock out to Queen's songs live, let me just say I'm glad I went and didn't sit at home listening to old records. And for you to say shit about a concert you NEVER experienced nor witnessed .... Say what you want about Lambert, but that boy can sing.  I hope they keep going out, would love to see them again.  So much respect for Brian and Roger."
queen,2dqjqi,og_penson,2,Sun Aug 17 03:46:53 2014 UTC,"Obviously Adam Lambert has an exceptional voice and talent as a showman, but Queen in their golden age (I mean in the old days) was more than that: Queen was about composition, musical talent, and virtuosity. So yes, Lambert is ok for singing in stadiums in front of a bunch of fans, but that is not Queen."
queen,2dqjqi,snakers,3,Thu Aug 21 02:48:20 2014 UTC,"To answer you main question first: I'm not into it as well. The little I have heard of Adam Lambert made me realise 2 things: he's got a great voice but I don't like it. I find it annoying somehow.... don't know.   The whole thing seems like another cash cow like all the other things they have done over the past few years.   That is one way of looking at it. Here's another: All the things Brian & Roger have done in the past 15 years have helped to keep Queen in the public consciousness. Compare them to Genesis for instance. Both were huge in the 80s.  Queen 86: hugely successful album & stadium tour (2x Wembley Stadium + Knebworth) // Genesis 86/87: hugely successful album & stadium tour (4x Wembley Stadium)  Queen 91: big success with Innuendo & GH2 // Genesis 92: big success with We Can't Dance + stadium tour  Queen after that: big success with MiH (95), many heavily promoted, chart-topping archive releases, the musical, many live appearances as guests & on their own with PR&AL // Genesis after that: nothing - unsuccessful album without Phil Collins (97), 2 somewhat successful archive box-sets, a couple of dvds, otherwise absolutely no activity; the exception: 2007 'reunion' tour, again very successful  look at them now: Queen are ""everywhere"", articles in the contemporary music press, still winning all kinds of awards (MTV), their music can be heard on the radio, on TV, in movies, young people know them, like them, look at facebook as one indicator: 28million fans  Genesis? you basically only come across them on classic rock stations and similar magazines, hardly ever heard on TV/movies, ask someone younger than 30 to name 3,4,5 songs of Genesis, if you're lucky someone will come up with In The Air Tonight (facepalm)... facebook? 1.6million fans  Now of course one can say there are many different reasons for that (""music hasn't aged well"", everyone started hating Phil Collins in the 90s, etc.), but I am absolutely sure, if Brian & Roger hadn't done what they did in these past 15 years, Queen today simply wouldn't be as recognized and worshipped as they are today, at least not by so many people!   all the different types of over priced box sets & reissues they like to sell. They know fans will buy it & it seems like Queen fans get taken advantage of sometimes.   in that respect they are absolutely no different from any other act. all that limited edition box set stuff is how you sell physical copies nowadays.   Personally Id rather sit at home & listen to the real Queen than go see Brain roger & the guy from American Idol/Glee.   That's exactly what I do. I read the headlines to keep up with what they do. If I don't like it - out of sight, out of mind. My respect for them comes solely from the music they've written and produced and can't be diminished by anything they do that I might not agree with."
queen,2dqjqi,AlwaysDrunkLiterally,2,Sat Aug 16 22:13:29 2014 UTC,"That's a good point. Brian and Roger deserve at least some credit for managing the Queen brand such that the band is as popular now as it has ever  been.    Their popularity, especially in America, was not inevitable. Just look at bands such as Genesis and Styx (Styx is probably a better comparator). They've enjoyed a revival under the stewardship of Brian and Roger. Sure, it's possible that they would have attained such popularity without any of their actions, but it's hard to argue with results."
queen,2dqjqi,og_penson,0,Mon Aug 18 16:38:08 2014 UTC,"I like your cash cow/Genesis analogy, maybe your right. Its just over the years Ive looked on the Queen website & theyve always got something new for sale, some over priced reissue box set, along side a deluxe box set and the super deluxe and on it goes which just isnt worth the money really.  It also seems Brians always playing with someone shit or trying to sell something all the time.  I know it sounds hypocritical of me after all Ive said but one thing I would love to hear is a Queen Anthology like the Beatles did. Outtakes, demos, acoustic versions. Then just put it to bed."

My dad saw Queen in 77, and he said it was the best concert he'd ever been too, so for his and my birthday we decided to go to Queen+AL. It was great and we loved it, he was happy to seem them again and thought Lambert was phenomenal but he was no Freddie(which is what everyone agrees on), I was happy to see Brian grinning at the applause and people singing with Adam and it was great. There were young people there and old people there, some were there for Queen and others for Lambert and to me you could tell that Lambert wasn't the focus, it felt like a tribute to Freddie, and Lambert did nothing to act like him or act like he's replacing Mercury, he sang phenomenally and yeah, I loved it, best night of my life.

I'm not sure what you are talking about, they already sold out three back to back London shows with Lambert and received rave reviews.  Maybe you don't like him, and that's fine, but don't think you are speaking for all of England.  This isn't a competition between Lambert and Freddie, if you don't like him (which is obvious from all of your insults) don't go see them.  Stay home and listen to how things used to be back in the day.  I happen to think he's absolutely brilliant and I'm so happy I got to see them play at a sold out Madison Square Garden show before Brian or Roger's health fades. Adam is much more than Idol/Glee or whatever limited stereotype you wish to assign to an individual, and fits in wonderfully with the band.  I don't know how long they will continue, but it's made a lot of Queen and Adam Lambert fans happy and you can just sit home and cross your arms."

Whatever floats peoples boats if thats what theyre into, like I said its a free country & Brian & Roger can do what thy want, I dont think it sounds very good & looks even worse, sorry. If youre into him & you had a good night seeing them live Im very pleased for you seriously.  Im a musician myself so i can totally see why Roger & Brian would want to play shows again, its just I look at this & I know they need someone with a vocal range but is this the best they could come up with.   One of my other favourite bands is The Stone Roses & I finally got to see them a couple of years ago which was amazing, but a small amount of that myth & magic was gone after seeing them as weird as it sounds & that wasnt just my opinion either.  I wouldnt really like one of my abiding memories of Queen to be seeing Just Roger & Brian on stage with this guy & in my opinion singing Queen songs not very well. Thats not Queen.  You sound like your a Lambert fan also which may have made it easier for you to be into it I dont know? Out of interest were you a Lambert fan before & how old are you?  Im not some bitter old Queen fan sat at home on my hands as you said (which made me laugh!)

As a matter of fact, ticket sales with Paul were so dismal, they had to shut down areas of venues and ticket sales were very limited...so no, Queen does not sell out venues on name their name alone, especially in the U.S.  Brian refused to come back to America unless he could play in two venues, Madison Square and L.A. Forum..  With Lambert, these sold out in minutes, and most of the tour sold out in a day then shows were added.  The Australian shows sold out in minutes, so they added more.  NZ sold out in minutes, so they added a show.  This tour has been a complete success on every level. I was a Queen fan (late 40's here) and lost interest over time.  I became a fan of Lambert when he was on Idol because he simply blew everyone else away, not to mention he listed Freddie Mercury as his hero and inspiration. He is rated as one of the best technical vocalists in the world.  To me, no one else can come close to his range and abilities.  And yes, he is the best they could come up with...and they are damn lucky to have him.  He's just at the beginning of his career, they are in the winter of theirs, so his time is very valuable right now as he is still trying to finish his solo album.  For whatever reason, what they are doing together  now just feels right to me, and it is wonderful to see them perform live.  I've seem them three times and I would definitely see them again.  Adam is introducing so many new fans to Queen's music, and at the same time, he's giving Brian and Roger a proper go around again, most likely for the last time.  They don't need anyone's approval anymore, they just want a way to keep the show going as long as they can. Sorry I got angry earlier, I don't get the ""Is this the best they could come up with"" thing."
queen,2dqjqi,AlwaysDrunkLiterally,0,Sun Aug 17 01:35:52 2014 UTC,"You make some valid points & I totally see where you are coming from.  I didnt know about the dismal ticket sales with Paul in the US tbh as I had no interest in it & didnt follow what they were up to in the US or the whole new Queen thing in recent years. So to get Lambert in with his American Idol exposure seems more logical now youve explained that part, more US exposure, help ticket sales also. It doesnt mean I agree he should be up there or like it but I see why they chose him in that respect if thats what they want to do.  Im sure Brian at his age & after all he had done didnt want a repeat of the Rogers dismal sales. And yeah your right the boys dont need anyones approval & have earned the right 100 times over to do what the fuck they like.  I just wanted to know others opinions as were probably all as passionate about the band as each other. I understand you getting angry as I wouldnt like it if someone was slagging off one of my favourite singers & I think its interesting you are in your late 40s & bang into it, so good for you.  Maybe I come across a little harsh but being a passionate Freddie fan/ brash northerner thats how I come across sometimes, sorry. Im not trying to wind people up or come across as just slagging the guy off, hes obviously talented & living the dream so good for him.  Im still gonna sit at home on my hands listening to Freddie though!"

It's possible the three queens (black, white, and killer) came from there.  I tried writing up an RPG setting for Rhye, and it included a derelict spaceport where an ancient interstellar craft took off in the year of '39. There were peers and shady senators, governed by an ineffective president (Leroy Brown), as well as a two way mirror mountain occupied by Ogre Men. In a run down two bit town, there's the Emerald Bar where a young bard, Sammy, dreams of adventure."

queen,2dl61y,Darth_Bowie,2,Fri Aug 22 03:43:25 2014 UTC,As a kid in high school I used to think the first three albums contained songs that were telling bits and pieces of a bigger story taking place in the land of Rhye with the Lap of the Gods and Lap of the Gods...revisited being kind of like a finale as the curtains are being drawn on this land.  Queen: -Great King Rat -My Fairy King -Seven Seas of Rhye Queen 2:  -White Queen -Ogre Battle -The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke -Nevermore -March of the Black Queen -Seven Seas of Rhye Sheer Heart Attack: -Lily of the Valley -In the Lap of the Gods -In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited
queen,2dl61y,KumoNin,2,Fri Aug 15 14:43:53 2014 UTC,"My view:  It starts with My Fairy King, in which this magical land is described, but then someone intrudes it and takes away the king's power.  Queen II tells most of the story. It can either be that it's only Side Black that matters here, since in MFK Rhye allegedly descends(?) into chaos, or possibly Side White is also a part of this... I think the first 4 songs on SW are kinda connected either way (with the kings and the queens and stuff).   Anyway, so Ogre Battle tells us about one of the events that now happens every so often in Rhye. Pretty self-explanatory, the lyrics. I don't believe the next song is part of this story.   Nevermore is possibly very closely related to The March of the Black Queen, and they're about how the (White?) Queen used to be so nice and loving (towards the people and the creatures in Rhye), but now she's evil and just wants to fuck everything up. The middle part is someone reminding her how nice she was (like an angel) and the tiny instrumental/aaah part between the last ""...a little bit of looove!"" and ""I reign with my left hand..."" is her resisting those... angels(?) that try to convince her to be good again, and she overcomes them.   In Seven Seas of Rhye whoever took the King's power reveals himself.   I believe the final part of this is a track on the next album called Lily of the Valley, in which it is revealed that Rhye is... No more? I don't know, but anyhow, the (new) king has lost his throne and there's a number of things that could mean. Possibly a message from Fred, that he's moved on from this type of songs.  But anyway, I honestly think that for each person, the meaning will be different. That's how it's meant to be. If you really want the complete story, you just gotta listen for yourself (Queen II and the 2 songs from 2 other albums I mentioned)"
queen,2dl61y,Eimona,1 point,Fri Aug 15 15:21:34 2014 UTC,"If I had to speculate, Rhye was a collection of Freddie's childhood fantasies.  My guess is that the fairy-tale/fantasy themes in the earlier albums were largely expressions of Freddie's creativity and curious nature.    I recall reading that the deeper secrets of Rhye were kept between Freddie and his sister, Kashmira, so I suppose she knows most about it.  But when Freddie died, the world of Rhye died with him."

I love Brian the artist, but the person is a shadow of what he was once. My guess is that he had a lot of issues with Freddie having all the spotlight, and he, as one important quarter of the band that sometimes can act as half of the band, didn't took the recognition he thought he deserved.  I guess we're all humans and he doesn't get that some annoying fans can make mistakes just as he usually does as a person.  That fan that needs to get a life, is one of the guys that probably help to pay his checks. Brian forgot all that grateful attitude towards fans that made him loved in the eighties.  Brian should sign off the Internet for a while.  The soapbox and twitter sometimes are just a whiteboard for his rants, and he is not helping himself.  On the other hand,  All those people who can't get over the fact that Freddie passed away and will not come back, and that John did not want to be in the business again , should reconsider their musical likes and not follow Brian on TW.  But as a fan with 20 years of experience with groups of fans, I must say that sometimes, the Queen fandom is one of the most passionated around, which sadly attracts the wrong kind of people very often."

Whilst its good practice to be nice to your customers, there's nowt wrong with telling the ones who are being dicks to just f*ck off.   He has nothing to prove to anyone, and as someone else has said, he must be sick of tellingpeople that he and Roger have John's blessing, and even before Freddie died he had told them to do what the hell they want with his legacy.  As for having issues about Freddie taking the spotlight, from interviews in the late 90s it seems it was more about wanting people to realise that there was more to him than just Queen. And he's said before he used the guitar to hide behind, and he got plenty of spotlight time doling out vagina-quivering solos in 15 years of touring, so I dont think its a spotlight thing.  The guy's 67 years old - people at that age tend to say what the hell they like. He for one has earned the right to speak his mind and give out the occasional smackdown."

queen,2cxqqw,gyropyro,1 point,Fri Aug 8 19:42:15 2014 UTC,It is the greatest mystery of Queen. If you do an internet search you come away disappointed. How can one man make himself so private in the 21st century? There is no internet trial of John Deacon. He almost doesn't seem to exist. Yet he wrote two of the biggest Queen songs of all time: ANOTHER BITES THE DUST and YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. I have always wondered what Brian May and Roger Taylor did to send him fleeing for the hills. Does anyone here know? Let's talk...Queen fan to Queen fan.

queen,2csxt1,KimberlyInOhio,1 point,Thu Aug 7 19:50:49 2014 UTC,It sounds alot like the return to the early falsetto approach Freddie had to singing. Some of his stuff with Ibex/Wreckage/Smile and as Larry Lurex sounds the same way. Also funny how love is has the same high register.

But as any Roger tune, it's fun to listen and fun to play in guitar. (That video is awful).  He wasn't ready at that moment for a serious solo attempt.  Fun in space captures him way better in terms of creativity and performance."
queen,2cn1l4,ozzraven,2,Tue Aug 5 00:35:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah I can see what you mean, from a critical point of view it's not the greatest, but, to me at least, that all goes out the window because it's such a fun song, like you said. I'm still looking through the rest of his solo stuff so I'll have to check it all out.  And of course, that video is reeaally bad :P"
queen,2cn1l4,ozzraven,3,Tue Aug 5 00:46:33 2014 UTC,"My view on Roger's work:   Fun in space: refreshing and creative. The tittle is pretty accurate and the cover art is awesome. Ahead of his time for sure. I can stil listen to it and feel that is timeless.  My pick: No Violins, Future management, Good times are now Strange Frontier: Sounds heavily like Bruce springsteen with new wave influences. Man on Fire is the strongest song there and I like it. Happiness: His best album IMHO. You can feel the grief after Freddie's passing. Hapiness, Revelations, Touch the Sky, Foreign Sand (Awesome work with Yoshiki), Old Friends... all masterpieces  Electric Fire: It's like happiness part II. Great songs again: Pressure on,  nation of Haircuts. Sounds more modern and fresher. Fun in earth: I have not heard it enough yet.   The cross is awesome in itself and deserves a separate post :D"

And let's not forget Flash Gordon which had Brian & Mack working together closely."
queen,2cgxwf,og_penson,1 point,Sun Aug 3 14:21:43 2014 UTC,Really?  What's the back story? Guess it explains Dave Richard's production from 1988 onward.
queen,2cgxwf,Mick_Wyld,1 point,Mon Aug 4 00:09:07 2014 UTC,"Lets see between the lines on these Mack quotes:  On CLTCL   The first track we attempted was Crazy Little Thing Called Love. Freddie picked up an acoustic guitar and said, ""quick, let's do this before Brian comes."" About six hours later the track was done. The guitar solo was an overdub later on. Brian still hates me for making him use a Telecaster for the part.  We put a track down and, being good musicians as they are, that is the track you hear! Freddie said, “Let’s do this real quick, before Brian [May] comes. Otherwise it will take weeks to get it done.” So, we had the basic structure [to “Crazy Little Thing Called Love”]. The next thing was a couple of overdubs. Freddie said, “Wait, mark my words; when Brian comes in, before he even hears it, he will say, ‘I don’t like it.’” Brian comes two days later. “Hey, you been doing anything?” I said, “Yeah. We’ve been putting down ideas. I think it’s come out pretty good.” “Well, I don’t like it.” I think he’s holding that against me to this day! I said, “This is the sort of part. Can you play a Fender Telecaster? Because it’s a take off of a rockabilly kind of thing.” He did it, in about eight takes. Being sort of to the point, I kept recording over it. I didn’t have eight tracks. He said, “Let me do it again. Let’s see what we’ve got so we can comp something together.” I said, “You’re going to have to listen back real close! The one you hear is the one you’ve got. The other ones are underneath, in the oxide!”  He did an interview in Melody Maker and went on for a page and a half about the “incident.”He didn’t like that too much. But overall the track came out pretty good.  There were two camps of song writing: Freddie and Brian. Fred was easy. We thought along similar lines and it took him fifteen to twenty minutes to come up with something absolutely brilliant. Brian on the other hand would come up with a great idea, but get completely lost in insignificant details after the first rush of creativity. Keeping the focus and direction was difficult at the best of times with this mixture of personalities. Getting a track finished was the prime goal, not the flavor.   ON IWTBF   So I’m on “I Want To Break Free.” I’ve got to do this fucking solo. It’ll never get done. The bigwigs were coming down in a half an hour and we had to present an album-type thing, even if it wasn’t mixed. They want to hear something they can sell. Fred Mandel, who did all the keyboards, just put the solo there with the [Roland] Jupiter-8; that’s the solo that’s still there. It was a placeholder. “Let’s just do it and get a mix together.” We did the rough mixes of all the tracks we had, and Brian would grandiosely explain what all the tracks were. Then this thing came up. Deacon was hiding in the corner and I was like, “Man, I really gotta get some beers” and ran out of the room three beats before the solo came up.  At first he didn’t have a clue; thinking, “This is the part where I had to put some solo stuff in,” not knowing that a solo would come in. It stayed like that, because there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s pretty good. But he’s still pissed off at the idea that people think it’s him doing something with a weird guitar synthesizer. But it doesn’t matter.   TL;DR;  Freddie and Mack admired eachother and had a similar working approach. In Mack words, it seems that Brian did not like his approach. He never felt comfortable with it.  I think the end of the relationship after 1986 could be directly linked to the atrocious sound of Mr Bad Guy (1985) too."
queen,2cgxwf,ozzraven,1 point,Mon Aug 4 13:21:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks. Totally makes sense.   The bad sound of Mr. Bad Guy has baffled me. A few cuts are outstanding, like Living on My Own. The rest sounds like demos,  especially Made in Heaven. Sooo glad the band took that track and Queenified it, very much deserved the treatment.   Going back to Mack, Im still a fan. I loved the two albums he did with Billy Squire. He just delivers a great live, crisp sound that rings well for me."
queen,2cgxwf,Mick_Wyld,2,Mon Aug 4 20:57:40 2014 UTC,"I think Mack was a good thing for Queen in several ways.  He got a fresh sound that allowed them to survive the Punk /new wave era. The game was their biggest album and a huge hit in America, so it was perfect !.  One of my favourite Brian solo's is Put out the Fire from Hot Space, and that was something Brian would have never do on his own. It was a drunk night and Brian played it freely without much thought. That was the mack Approach: to get the Ideas there with spontaneity rather than long hours of overdub.  On the bad side, they got lazy. They got more time for themselves out of the studio. They allowed themselves to do less, and thats very clear during The Works and AKOM."
queen,2cgxwf,ozzraven,2,Mon Aug 4 21:43:44 2014 UTC,"Throw in the Miracle on that list of mediocrity. Dave Richards was probably easier to work with but as has been mentioned in this thread, bands benefit from having opposition and challenges. I've refered this in other threads, the Miracle song with its two endings that are tacked on to please Brian and Freddie respectively.   As controversial as Hot Space is to fanatics and the casual listener;  It was the last truly daring and experimental album that they made."

I remember many, many years ago as a relatively new fan (only knowing 3 albums and the hits) I ordered the 'infamous' ""Live At Wembley '86"", which I had read about quite a bit and seen pictures of, at a shop (I'd never seen it in stock anywhere). I got it together with some other CD and the deal with my parents was that I'd buy one myself and get the other one later as a christmas present. Despite it being more expensive, I knew I just couldn't wait til christmas to hear it. So I spent the extra buck, went home, up to my room, put the CD in the player, put my headphones on and for the next 110 minutes just sat there in awe listening with my eyes closed.  Since then my CD collection has grown to around 600 releases. And although I remember when and where I bought most of them, the actual memory of hearing that album for the first time, knowing exactly how I was listening, where I was sitting, what I was feeling, is something very special. I mean, I remember getting Sheer Heart Attack and A Day At The Races a couple of years later from amazon on a hot summer day and taking them with me to the swimming pool, listening to them in the sun after getting out of the water for example, but the memory of sitting in my room, listening to the Wembley album is so clear, almost palpable that it stands out. And I'm sure that my anticipation of finally hearing this legendary performance played a big part in this.  But then again I'm not the boss of you, so do whatever the hell you want....."

queen,2ca61c,BP0413,3,Thu Jul 31 22:21:27 2014 UTC,"A big no.  I have watched some of QE's YT video's and while Marc does sort of sound like Freddie, the show would have been boring.  If I want to hear Freddie , I can listen to the real thing not an impersonator.  If I am paying to see Queen I want to see what they are known for…soaring vocals, charisma, showmanship, and flamboyance."
queen,2ca61c,easterbaby,3,Fri Aug 1 01:25:09 2014 UTC,While he has a great voice he would reduce Roger and Brian to a cover band. Adam or even Paul Rogers for good or bad bring their own styles which make for a compelling show.
queen,2ca61c,geekstone,3,Fri Aug 1 03:42:28 2014 UTC,"No, while I think he's a great guy, he's got no star quality...and just seems like a fake Freddie.  (Maybe he's not trying to be but that's what it seems like.)  I really think I'd be bored."

queen,2c7rmt,Marmite-Badger,10,Thu Jul 31 05:40:34 2014 UTC,"No, I don't think there's a better option.  Why would they want someone else?  Lambert was more than great and fit right in with the band and has a spectacular voice.  I hope they keep going as long as they can with him."
queen,2c7rmt,gyropyro,2,Thu Jul 31 11:23:01 2014 UTC,"I'd love to see Queen + George Michael, but am not holding my breath. I think GM has more of a solo career and might not be interested in hitching his star to someone else's wagon.  Lambert is doing a really good job, but doesn't have the charisma of George Michael, or, of course, Freddie. Maybe he'll develop that kind of magnetism on stage, given time?"
queen,2c7rmt,KimberlyInOhio,4,Thu Jul 31 13:48:58 2014 UTC,"I've always been a cheerleader for George Michael as far as a new singer for Queen. That being said, I was seriously taken by pleasant surprise with Adam Lambert and think he fits perfectly.  He's got the voice, he's got the showmanship, he and the band seem to get on really well and have a lot fun on stage together. Most importantly, he respects the legacy of the band and of the man whose shoes he's filling.  Before the tour, I never really paid attention to Adam Lambert but he really left a great impression on me.  He's awesome :)  edit: grammar"

queen,2c7rmt,megamouth2,1 point,Thu Jul 31 13:59:54 2014 UTC,"I agree. Don't get me wrong, Adam Lambert's a bloody talented bloke, and he's ace at singing other material. But when I first heard him doing the whole Queen+ thing, it felt like his voice didn't really suit the songs. They came out a bit more... warbled, or a bit more ""broadway showtune"".  Which, of course, is good if you don't mind that effect being added. But I... kind of did.  George Michael was great at the tribute concert - but he was a lot younger then, and I've not heard much of him in between being on the news for some strange things.  Marc Martel's good, but he doesn't have the showmanship to go with the wonderful voice.   It's definitely not an easy position to fill, and the songs are not easy to sing. Everyone I can think of either doesn't have the right voice or is a bit 'lacklustre' to get such big crowds going."
queen,2c3gcy,BP0413,5,Wed Jul 30 00:30:09 2014 UTC,"I loved the Chicago show since it was the first, even if there were technical issues in the beginning.  The anticipation was crazy.  MSG was also special (I was at that one, too).   There is an article out with Brian saying they want to do more.  I am not sure if they will come back to the U.S., but there are plenty of places around the world that are begging for them.  I would think the U.S. would be good for them if they were promoting new music, and were also doing t.v. appearances."
queen,2c3gcy,gyropyro,3,Wed Jul 30 17:26:09 2014 UTC,"Well they bypassed the southern states, so maybe a 2nd leg could happen."
queen,2c3gcy,Mick_Wyld,2,Wed Jul 30 18:12:33 2014 UTC,"I went to the MSG show, and NJ shows at Izod and Atlantic City.  In order: #1. Atlantic City, #2 Izod, and #3 MSG. For the Atlantic City show I got to sit two rows back from the end of the cat walk, so that enhanced the experience.  But the whole band was so ON for that show and the audience was phenomenal which makes for the whole awesome package.  Izod center was a lot of fun too, especially the Spinal Tap moment right at the beginning with the curtain malfunction. :D They didn't miss a single beat though!  MSG was my very first time seeing any incarnation of Queen ever, and wasn't sure what to expect with Adam. I remember thinking at the end of the MSG show that he made you miss Freddie even more.  Once the initial ""shock"" wore off and I went to the next two shows, it kinda felt like Adam was in the band all along and not necessarily filling a vacancy. I know, it probably sounds sacrilegious but that's how I felt :D  TL;DR: Atlantic City was my favorite show."
queen,2c3gcy,ferncorre,4,Wed Jul 30 18:16:07 2014 UTC,"Went to the izod show, nj.  I had low/no expectations of Adam Lambert. I don't know him or anything about him other than the buzz from American Idol way back when.  I mainly wanted to see Brian and Roger.  Going in without any of that, the kid did pretty well I think.  He can definitely sing. He's no Freddie, but he acknowledges that and has a few good words for us, the fans, accepting him and allowing him to be there.   I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. He seems comfortable with the material and does a great job.  Brian and Roger were brilliant, and I enjoyed the show entirely (though many didn't appreciate the long guitar solo).  I was happy. I went from telling people I'm going to see Queen, but there's that Adam Lambert guy singing for them, to telling people -  I got to see Queen.  So to any in doubt - go see the show, it's worth it."

queen,2c3gcy,ferncorre,2,Wed Jul 30 18:59:08 2014 UTC,"I went to the Philly show, and honestly I don't think I've seen a better concert. Everyone was spot on, the energy in the room -- both from the audience and the band -- was outstanding. My favorite part was easily the appearance made by Freddie during Love of My Life. The only mistake made the whole night was Brian introducing Spike Edney as a ""pretty fine bass player"". But it was funny, because of Spike's reaction and Brian's response: ""Well ya can't get everything right, can you? Fuck it."" Otherwise it was a flawless show, and I'd go again in a heartbeat.  So that's what I did!   I also went to the Atlantic City show, and to be honest, it wasn't as good. Still a fucking phenomenal concert (would you expect anything less from Queen?), but the energy from the band wasn't quite as high. They didn't seem as into it as they did at the Philly show. Adam Lambert messed up 6 or 7 times, and they all seemed like they wanted to be done the tour. That's not to say they didn't give it their all and play as well as they ever did. The show just seemed to be missing what the Philly show had so much of: enthusiasm. For one example, when Brian came to the front for his solo stuff, he talked about Freddie before Love of My Life, and told the story about the song '39 before playing it. At AC, he did none of that. He just played. Still, it was a great concert, and they even changed up the setlist a bit, adding Dragon Attack. However, it replaced Love Kills, which I thoroughly enjoyed at the first show. They also skipped The Show Must Go On. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the Philly show, I'd give AC an 8.5. But hey, ya can't do everything right, can you? Fuck it."
queen,2c0eup,snakers,6,Tue Jul 29 03:34:45 2014 UTC,"I attended the Queen/Adam Lambert show in Toronto tonight. This is post is more of a collection of a few thoughts rather than a full on review:  Overall, I was impressed by the show. I thought Lambert, surprisingly,  was best on the harder rock songs, in particular ""I want it All"" and ""Stone Cold Crazy"".  In fact, Queen didn't feature too many ballads, and the softer songs (""Love of My Life"", ""These Are the Days of Our Lives"") were sung by Brian and Roger, respectively.   In general, the show had a real hard-rock vibe to it, perhaps due to the influence of Roger and Brian who always had more of heavy metal sensibility than Freddie and John. They even muscled up ""Somebody to Love"" by incorporating a fast rock/rhythm portion at the end of the song. It was nice to see them breathe new life into old classics--especially on a song that is often prone to over-indulgence by singers.  The light/laser show,which has always been afterthought for me, was surprisingly entertaining and a real asset to the show.  There were few minor disappointments, however. I felt Lambert missed the mark on a couple of songs (""Who wants to Live Forever"" comes to mind), and the band didn't showcase both the great sense of rhythm and improvisation that had marked their earlier tours. However, the show proceeded at  pretty good pace--it was definitely a very tight and professional set, especially for dudes in their 60s.  Since this show marked the end of the (North American?), Brian seemed to be somewhat emotional. Who knows how many shows this legend has left in him?"
queen,2c0eup,dannzo_29,3,Tue Jul 29 03:52:24 2014 UTC,"Just got back from this, it was so great. It was also the first concert I've ever been to. I went with my dad who's favourite concert of all time was Queen's Get Down Make Love Ottawa concert, so it was fitting that we saw this one together. I'm really glad I got to see the rock legends, Brian May and Roger Taylor in person after listening to them for years. I thought May killed it on Love of My Life and '39, and the bits with Freddie on the screen were very touching. Like you said, I Want it All was amazing and overall the concert featured harder rock songs. Lambert was pretty funny too, I thought the part where they brought out the couch pretty funny. My favourite part was at the end where I got to do the Radio Gaga Clap, then the finale songs of We Will Rock You and We are the Champions. The crowd was absolutely going nuts at the end. Also found it pretty cool how everyone in the arena was talking about the Blue Jays game afterwords (they won 14-1)."

When they toured with Paul Rodgers, they did so much more. Sure, Adam Lambert can sing/perform, but it was NOT a Queen concert, and I feel really disillusioned."

queen,2b9260,BlueShoeLover,2,Mon Jul 21 04:53:48 2014 UTC,"I believe that's how ""Is this the World We Created"" came about. At least in part."
queen,2b9260,Tetra_Zelda,3,Mon Jul 21 06:23:42 2014 UTC,'The Miracle' is such an amazing song - it's from my favorite album! BUT the transition from the rock bit to to the sweet bit at the end is a complete mess! I think the group just didn't know how to transition those two parts so they just overlapped them and called it a day. The whole song is so beautiful but that part seriously bugs me!
queen,2b9260,og_penson,3,Mon Jul 21 05:12:19 2014 UTC,"Agreed 100%, also the Classic Queen (and GH2) version omits the ""hard rock"" ending. So that helps it a little."
queen,2b9260,joeobrown,2,Mon Jul 21 05:47:32 2014 UTC,"the Greatest Hits 2 version is no different from the album version, only the fade-out is about 10 seconds shorter"
queen,2b9260,og_penson,2,Mon Jul 21 16:03:54 2014 UTC,"Also back to HTF; the album version ends with drums then two seconds later, guitar,  then two seconds after that electric thunder clap. Again the single version just one good thunder clap at the end. It's like no one could agree on the song so let's do it all."
queen,2b9260,joeobrown,2,Mon Jul 21 20:10:58 2014 UTC,"Similarly with Seven Seas of Rhye, not a fan of that one's ending either which is a shame..."

queen,2b3x5k,mintlou,1 point,Sat Jul 19 10:31:28 2014 UTC,I feel Queen performed well that night (as always) but the audience sucked IMO.  Freddie kept swearing at them because they weren't into it so I don't really like that show as much.
queen,2b3x5k,mintlou,1 point,Sat Jul 19 19:14:02 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, the audience were very unappreciative which made it bad. But saying that, it did give a positive of actually hearing him sing all of 'Love of my life' which he didn't usually do."

queen,2arc69,KumoNin,4,Tue Jul 15 13:06:31 2014 UTC,"They're not really bloopers as such, it's just the stuff that is either low in the mix and not clearly heard or alternative takes that they ended up not using.  There wasn't room on the tape to leave in 'mistakes' as such, they just had to go over them with a better take."
queen,2arc69,SexWithTwins,2,Tue Jul 15 16:45:02 2014 UTC,"Technically true, but not in this case. Besides the comped final lead vocal there are 3 takes of the ballad part left on the original multitrack that were muted for the final mix. 2 of them can be heard in this video, the third one was partly used for the final lead vocal, IIRC.  The Roger/Freddie banter at the end was picked up by the drum / piano mics after the final take of the backing track."
queen,2arc69,og_penson,2,Tue Jul 15 18:15:41 2014 UTC,"I made this a few years ago from the 24 track masters that were leaked. It's just Fred and the piano. A couple of people have uploaded it since and claimed it as their work but it took me a while to put together and I don't think that someone else would have chosen the exact same pieces of the various tracks used. The banter at the end is from a couple of different tracks, Roger saying ""Deacon crashing about for the last ten minutes "" is from one (track 5 of 24)  and Freddie saying ""Oh fuck it"" is from another (track 15 of  24)."

queen,2ao2j7,snakers,10,Mon Jul 14 14:24:59 2014 UTC,"This guy is sooo far off. I saw the show in Vancouver, and it was amazing. Yes, the place erupted when the Freddie video came on, and so it should have. But Adam Lambert absolutely killed it. He was so good. I was worried that he would stray too far off the originals, and he didn't. He did add his own flair here and there which was great. What an incredible performer he is. I always liked his voice and the way he performs, but I now have a whole new respect for him."
queen,2ao2j7,kevin-13,3,Mon Jul 14 17:25:17 2014 UTC,"Well, the Toronto Star is known mostly for stuff like going through Rob Ford's garbage"
queen,2ao2j7,s_bar,1 point,Mon Jul 14 21:37:34 2014 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. I was also at the Vancouver show, and while I though Brian May really stole the show, Adam Lambert really held his own, especially when you think about who's shoes he is trying to fill."
queen,2ao2j7,gyropyro,4,Tue Jul 15 02:50:05 2014 UTC,"For this one odd review, I can show you ten full of praise for the show.  The reviewer seemed stuck on the fact the Lambert is not Freddie.  No shit, and he is not even trying to be.  Seriously, don't go to the concert if you are expecting a Freddie Mercury imitator."
queen,2ao2j7,indyK1ng,4,Mon Jul 14 15:25:30 2014 UTC,I'm too young to have gone to a Queen concert fronted by Freddie but after watching the video of Adam it looks like a great show.  I'm really looking forward to next week when they're in Boston.

queen,2ao2j7,NinjaNorris110,3,Sun Jul 20 01:08:02 2014 UTC,"I'm sure a good few were there to see Adam, and not Queen, then would've been so confused as to why everybody was going crazy at that part."
queen,2ao2j7,deetercopter,2,Mon Jul 14 17:32:31 2014 UTC,"Definitely have to disagree, I went to the show in San Jose and I thought Adam Lambert did an excellent job. Of course he didn't compare to Freddie, but it would be very foolish to expect him to, and he was great in his own right. I also think it's odd that the reviewer felt compelled to point out the use of the Bohemian Rhapsody video and  recorded track for the middle section as a 'cheat', when (correct me if i'm wrong) that's how it's always been performed."
queen,2ao2j7,bigexplosion,-5,Tue Jul 15 02:49:37 2014 UTC,"What a raging inferno of charisma, recorded at it's peak and  only had 5 minutes of performance time is remembered better than the guy who had to actually work the show?  shocking!"

queen,2ae7j9,small_town_nebraska,3,Fri Jul 11 03:16:41 2014 UTC,"It was a great show in Houston. I think Adam Lambert was great and felt from Under Pressure to the end of concert he just killed it and by not being Freddie it made it better since I felt like I was not hearing a ""cover band"" such as the current Journey.  It was great to see how much Brian and Roger seemed to be enjoying themselves onstage and how great they sounded."
queen,2ae7j9,geekstone,2,Fri Jul 11 13:30:48 2014 UTC,Saw them in Chicago and I agree on all points. I didn't go for Adam Lambert but he surpassed my expectations and did very well. He had an obvious respect for Freddie and his legacy and did not try to be or replace him. He stayed true to himself while staying true to Queen and I'm sure that was a very difficult balance. I commend him. It's a very difficult position he stepped into and I think he did very well.   Spoilers : I especially loved the little flashbacks to Freddie. I cried. Very sweet.
queen,2ae7j9,slothzy,2,Fri Jul 11 04:08:19 2014 UTC,"I think you've given a pretty fair review.    Music: Was great.  It was indeed Roger Taylor's son Rufus who was playing along on drums and even took over the main drum set for a few songs.   Song selection: A good assortment of the more popular songs, which I have absolutely no problem with, it's kind of what I was hoping to hear... what remains of the greatest rock band playing their greatest achievements.  I would say the set was fast, slow, and then fast... like there seemed to be a whole bunch of slower songs strung together (not a problem, I loved '39 and Love of My Life and being able to sing along to the latter like all the old concerts) but it was just something I noticed.    Vocals: Agreed.  Adam could hit some of the higher notes and was a better choice than their last frontman, I have to wonder if they could have done something akin to what Journey did and find someone who was a pretty good match (hardcore Perry fans will disagree about the Journey thing, but he's a pretty good copy imo).  Showmanship: Agreed.  Crowd involvement was so so or poor in many cases, but I think half of it is the crowd, not the performance.    Chemistry: I see your side and think you have a valid point. Brian seemed to be fine with Adam and they seemed to rock out well (leaning back to back on stage, performing from the couch etc...)."
queen,2ae7j9,ApatosaurusHans,1 point,Fri Jul 11 04:09:21 2014 UTC,"When did they come on stage relative to the time on the tickets? I'm going to the show in Toronto tonight and wonder how much of a wait I'm in for (seeing how tomorrow is a Monday...)...! Very excited for the show, though! :)"

queen,2abj2v,ZekeDiZurigo,2,Thu Jul 10 09:33:32 2014 UTC,"As an American it irks me that this article has so many videos that were not allowed in my country.  So I've recreated the list with US friendly links:  We Will Rock You - Germany's Pregame intentions  Under Pressure - That would be Brazil after Thomas Muller's early 0:1 ...  Another One Bites the Dust - 23 Minutes played and Brazil concedes another goal. Miroslav Klose scores and becomes all-time World Cup record scorer.  Don't Stop Me Now - You betcha the Germans are having a good time! Toni Kroos scores twice within just 69 seconds – and hey presto it's 4:0 for ze Vaterland.  I'm Going Slightly Mad - Brazil's losing it (pardon the pun): Barely played half an hour and 0:5 behind after Sami Khedira's goal.  Bohemian Rhapsody - Half time musings of the Seleçao: «Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.»  The Miracle - A bit of pep talk from Scolari: «Come on! All we need now is a miracle!» Unconfirmed reports claim Hulk (inbetween bites off his customary half time spit roast pig) responded by kicking Scolari in his sambas.  Radio Ga Ga - Meanwhile, Neymar's recovering from his injury, right? Afraid his nerves could not take the strain, he initially swore not to watch the game. After 63 minutes of reading comics on a reclining bed in the hospital garden, his curiosity gets the better of him. He cannot believe the news and immediately attempts to find the hidden camera filming what clearly must be a prank.  I Want it All - Giving up is not a character trait typically associated with the Germans. Hence André Schürrle's goal, putting his side 6:0 ahead.  Let Me Live - Insert dodgy comments about ""ruthless efficiency"" here – they might even be rather fitting, seeing that Schürrle scores again after 79 minutes upping the ante to 7:0. Oi – just say that out loud, go on: Seven-nil! Seven. Effin'. Nil.  Bicycle Race - Meanwhile, German keeper Manuel Neuer's thinking: «This is boring. I could've taken a nice little bicycle ride» ... moments before Oscar scores. 1:7 after 90 minutes? Better than nothing, I suppose. Not anything to write home about.  I Want to Break Free  - «I'm a celebrity ... get me out of here!» David Luiz' plea goes unheard. His compulsory post match interview goes ahead. Even after the worst defeat of his career.  A Kind of Magic - Football fans everywhere agree: What we've just witnessed cannot be of this world.  The Show Must Go On - Poor Brazil. No, they can't just slink off home and hang their heads. They have to take the walk of shame onto the pitch again where they will fight for the coveted 3rd place. Ugh.  We are the Champions - So Germany is the odds-on favourite for the finals, regardless who their opponent may be, Argentina or Holland. Hands up who thinks The Krauts will be singing Queens all time stadium fave?  And yes, not all of the videos linked in the article are restricted from the US, but I go for completion."

Granted, Brian was the one who actually wrote the lyrics and music to ""Save Me"", but I feel like Freddie's vocal performance on the song has a very genuine quality to it. I get the impression that Freddie is feeling the words he's singing. But then again, that may just speak to his acting skills.   Either way, using ""Save Me"" to discuss Freddie's ordeal with AIDS probably wasn't the best choice since the song came out way before."
queen,2a6nt4,og_penson,1 point,Wed Jul 9 15:05:27 2014 UTC,Yeah and wasn't it written by Brian anyways?
queen,2a6nt4,snakers,3,Wed Jul 9 12:48:57 2014 UTC,that's my point
queen,2a6nt4,MercurialNerd,5,Wed Jul 9 13:14:59 2014 UTC,"Yes. Yes, I know that.... now  whistles and slowly backs away"
queen,2a6nt4,Improved-Liar,1 point,Wed Jul 9 13:34:08 2014 UTC,"His solo work is a lot more autobiographical, e.g, songs like ""Living on my own"" and ""Your kind of lover"". I would otherwise list ""Life is Real"" as Freddie's most confessional Queen song."
queen,2a6nt4,og_penson,4,Wed Jul 9 18:07:56 2014 UTC,"Good article, but I'm not sure about this comment:   At the end of 1984, when nobody from Queen was invited to participate in the Band Aid charity recording of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" –  which had been organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money to alleviate famine in Ethiopia – Mercury was genuinely hurt.   My understanding (based on interviews with Geldof I've read, but can't remember exactly where...) was the Geldof wanted Queen on the Band Aid recording, but they couldn't attend due to scheduling?"
queen,2a6nt4,SchnauzerHaus,3,Wed Jul 9 10:22:29 2014 UTC,Yes you are correct. It says so in the books about the band and the books about Freddie.
queen,2a6nt4,elderpo23,2,Wed Jul 9 11:58:23 2014 UTC,"""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" was recorded on November 25 1984 at Sarm West Studios, London.  Earlier that month Brian, Roger and John had started work on ""Thank God It's Christmas"" in Sarm Studios (although that could have been Sarm West or Sarm East), before Brian and Roger joined Freddie in Munich where it was finished. The single was released November 26.  Freddie probably stayed in Munich. The ""Love Makin' Love"" Demo included in ""The Solo Collection"" was recorded at Musicland on December 9."
queen,2a6nt4,The_D_String,2,Wed Jul 9 13:37:38 2014 UTC,"I believe you're right about the Band Aid recording. And some of the comments on the article itself have pointed out some other inconsistencies and false ""facts"". So it's not perfectly written, but it's definitely a major improvement from the drivel Rolling Stone put out during Queen's height."
queen,2a9w1y,Siphari,1 point,Wed Jul 9 21:13:21 2014 UTC,"Queen isn't ""an artist"".. It's not the name or nickname of a singular person. What do you want to know about the group and it's members?"

queen,2a67ib,Fogram,-1,Wed Jul 9 13:37:09 2014 UTC,I'm 30 and never seen them either but I don't think I would spend my money on this. I saw a Queen cover band in Hollywood that was amazingly excellent and the singer was very very similar to Freddie's voice. Adam Lambert really doesn't even compare.
queen,2a67ib,Fogram,2,Wed Jul 9 15:01:43 2014 UTC,"True, but I owe it myself to at least Roger and Brian. Been a fan since I'm 11 and kinda have to. Especially since they are basically playing in my back yard."

queen,29f5qg,tinylaugh,1 point,Fri Jul 4 02:12:01 2014 UTC,They played for about 1:45 min to 2 hours. The set list in Vancouver was 23 songs long and they have been sticking to it pretty closely on other shows so you should expect around that many.

Although it makes me wonder, When Queen got put on the spot without any of that, in Live Aid, they still blew every other act out of the water regardless of fancy acts, but would Queen+AL be able to do something close? Are they still just as powerful without the light effects?"

Everything I've heard him preform so far I've enjoyed. So I'll have to wait and see.   Rodgers: I don't understand the hatred Queen fans have for him. I think he did all right with the band. But even still, probably my last choice as well. Actually, screw that Jessie J was the worst. No contest. ( Yes, I know she didn't tour with them, I stand by my opinion. )  Martel: I had the opportunity to see QE in 2012. Mark Martel was FANTASTIC. I think you're correct in saying his stage presence left a little to be desired, but his vocals more then made up for it.    So basically I pretty mush agree with you."

Adam Lambert would be my guy after seeing him tonight. He has the stage presence and his vocals are impressive. (For those Queen fans who says he sucks, you have to see him live. I was one of those people but now i have completely changed tune.)"

I'm real excited about Adam Lambert and have tickets to the Detroit show next month!   Paul Rodgers was a complete mismatch. What were they thinking?"
queen,28p616,gyropyro,3,Sat Jun 21 15:29:39 2014 UTC,"Lambert would def. be my number 1, and after seeing the videos from last night, there is no doubt.  He has his own voice and charm, and doesn't try to be Freddie.  The tour was almost completely sold out right away, so he has the draw.  Marc Martel, great imitator of Mercury's voice, but no showman.  He's very likable.  Paul Rodgers, can't hit half the notes required for Queen songs.  His tour was limited due to low ticket sales.

queen,28mzt3,randude,2,Fri Jun 20 19:07:35 2014 UTC,Was there an opening band or no...? I see by the set list they played 24 songs at their first 2 shows - i'm seeing them in Houston next month...just curious if there was an opening band

queen,28nz05,Darth_Bowie,3,Fri Jun 20 19:22:11 2014 UTC,"I always took it to be a metaphorical gesture of casting someone off. Like shooing someone away with your hand palm down and flicking it up like ""go away"". As it relates to the song, the narrator describes someone with great power/influence who can ""dislocate your spine if you don't sign"" etc. (a relative of the character in ""Death on Two Legs"" maybe?)"
queen,28nz05,tinylaugh,2,Sat Jun 21 05:54:14 2014 UTC,It's not a specific gesture. It's just a term used to portray that it's done quickly and with little effort and alot of skill.
queen,28nz05,Dr-Sardonicus,2,Fri Jun 20 19:40:55 2014 UTC,"I've always imagined it like how a movie serial killer would flick a straight razor to get the blood off it. Cause the guy is ruthless and doesn't care, it's a casual kind of thing.  Let's also look at context. ""Flick of the wrist, and you're dead baby"". Basically this guy has Freddie by the neck, knife at the ready, to kill him in an instant whenever the whimsy takes him. I have no doubt that the subject of this song is the same Death On Two Legs of the next album."
queen,28nz05,BlueShoeLover,2,Sat Jun 21 06:44:58 2014 UTC,"When I first heard the song back in high school I always thought the flick of the wrist was referring to a limp wrist (falsely) stereotypical with homosexual men.   I've always thought this song was written by Freddie wanting to be open about his sexuality but in the early 70's coming out would subjugate himself to open criticism which he didn't want. ""Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby"", the next line plays to my thoughts as well, ""Blow him a kiss and you're mad""."
queen,28nz05,MartynTheSpartyn,2,Sat Jun 21 19:14:54 2014 UTC,"I don't know what it's supposed to mean, but no, it's not masturbation."
queen,28nz05,belladonnic_haze,1 point,Sun Jun 22 19:40:47 2014 UTC,"I've always thought it was a phrase for signing something (a contract). It sounds like it's about the same guy death on two legs is about, their manager."

queen,28m64b,Arthian,1 point,Fri Jun 20 14:46:16 2014 UTC,"I think they said that they are going to try to keep the concerts ""organic"" and try to change it up, so maybe they will add it in."

queen,28m64b,jakdak,6,Fri Jun 20 14:09:46 2014 UTC,They have more rights to call is Queen than anyone else on the planet.
queen,28m64b,tinylaugh,-1,Fri Jun 20 18:23:20 2014 UTC,"Which still won't make it Queen.    Its not even ""The surviving members of Queen""."
queen,28m64b,jakdak,3,Fri Jun 20 18:37:17 2014 UTC,"So? They're in the band, not you, and not me. I am pretty sure that gives them the right to call it what they want, and gives you the right not to go to the shows. Easy as pie. It's laughable how serious people are taking this new formation of Queen. If it's that big of a deal, it's time to re-examine your priorities in life. (I am using the royal ""you"" there, not you specifically)"
queen,28m64b,tinylaugh,0,Fri Jun 20 21:09:44 2014 UTC,"If Paul and Ringo get back together for a show, are you seeing the Beatles?"
queen,28m64b,jakdak,6,Fri Jun 20 15:35:06 2014 UTC,"That's not even remotely similar....   Rodger and Brian didn't get ""back together"" for one show, they never stopped being part of Queen. And there's far more shows than one!"

queen,28ht5u,Garde,5,Wed Jun 18 21:12:56 2014 UTC,"I loved this song, my only critique of it was that I didn't think the style was very Brian May esque. The guy had a good impersonation of his tone, but I thought his note choice sounded more like Tom Scholz from Boston. Agree/ Disagree?"
queen,28ht5u,GeoffTheProgger,2,Thu Jun 19 01:18:25 2014 UTC,"Yup, same takeaway from me.  Especially that second [instrumental] portion.  That really sounded like a Boston solo."

queen,28el94,Mribby,1 point,Wed Jun 18 01:47:32 2014 UTC,"I didn't know what the point of the picture was. So i did a research. There was a statue of Freddie Mercury right under ""Dominion"" sign. Going back in time using google maps, its been there since 2008.  If you wanna see how it looked before, here's the link to Google Maps street view of the statue  from July 2012 (that's the last time the cars went past there i presume)."
queen,28d28d,WhatGodMeantToSay,1 point,Tue Jun 17 12:11:36 2014 UTC,Used to have the laserdisc of this concert . I was lucky enough to catch Brian when he came to Los Angeles and played The Palace.
queen,28c3c9,gyropyro,5,Tue Jun 17 02:31:48 2014 UTC,"Wow, he killed it. Perhaps I was able to enjoy it a bit more than Lambert's other Queen ""covers"" as a result of the fact that  I have no live frame of reference."
queen,28c3c9,snakers,3,Tue Jun 17 21:05:56 2014 UTC,"I really liked it, and it seems like a new Queen song albeit one written by Freddie. I think it helped that it is ""obscure"" so  they can put their own spin on it without being instantly being compared to the original lineup.I am starting to wonder if a new Queen + Adam Lambert album might not be such a bad idea. It can't be worse than The Cosmos Rocks."
queen,28c3c9,geekstone,3,Tue Jun 17 21:40:32 2014 UTC,Awesome!
queen,28c3c9,tinylaugh,1 point,Wed Jun 18 02:02:13 2014 UTC,Interesting spin on that one.  Did Queen ever play this song with Freddie?
queen,28c3c9,jakdak,6,Tue Jun 17 03:57:05 2014 UTC,No
queen,28c3c9,blamebravery,1 point,Tue Jun 17 05:33:34 2014 UTC,Wonder why they pulled that particular track out of Freddie's solo catalog.
queen,28c3c9,jakdak,1 point,Tue Jun 17 13:09:10 2014 UTC,Could be that they are putting it in the new album.
queen,28c3c9,blamebravery,0,Tue Jun 17 15:42:20 2014 UTC,I hope not- the new albums was supposed to be the last remnants of the old Freddie material.  This should just go on the Q+A live album.
queen,28c3c9,jakdak,2,Tue Jun 17 16:32:38 2014 UTC,"If they do make a live recording of this tour I hope it's the one I go to. But what they did  with love kills was good. I was not disappointed,  but a bit surprised they did the song ."
queen,28c3c9,blamebravery,1 point,Tue Jun 17 17:08:09 2014 UTC,"Just went back looking for the original version of that- forgot that they guitared it up for the version they put on ""Great Pretender"" and the original was just on the 1984 single from the Metropolis soundtrack.    I like the new Lambert spin on it, but think I still prefer the extended version of Freddie's original."
queen,28a84r,drowse,3,Mon Jun 16 15:01:15 2014 UTC,I really can't descibe how excited I am about this.  The bootleg versions I've had over the years show that these were an amazing set of concerts.. I can't wait to have an official copy..  Now if I can get my hands on that Live in Rio DVD that's part of the big DVD pack here in the US...
queen,28a84r,elderpo23,3,Mon Jun 16 15:02:24 2014 UTC,"So exciting, a really fantastic show that really highlights them at their best for the early years (more than Hammersmith Apollo at least!)"
queen,28a84r,elderpo23,3,Mon Jun 16 16:09:06 2014 UTC,"I agree.. Though the Hammersmith show, which I hope sees the official light of day also sometime soon, is interesting.. right after Bohemian Rhapsody is out, and no one really knows the song.. and they haven't even started walking away for the opera section.. its just part of a medley..  The Bo Rhap/Killer Queen/March of the Black Queen/Bo Rhap medley is, I think, particularly amazing.. those songs all together and the transitions are so great."
queen,28a84r,BurningFlame08,1 point,Mon Jun 16 16:23:32 2014 UTC,"That's true, it's fascinating seeing how they initially handled it. Personally though i think the greatest difference is In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited: Freddie nails it in the Rainbow! Also Brian referring to Freddie as 'young Mercury over there' is a live highlight for me for some reason:)"
queen,28a84r,paulosham,1 point,Mon Jun 16 21:10:29 2014 UTC,I just want Hyde Park to be released. We've had the Hammersmith 1975 concert on TV a few times already. The only things we've seen of Hyde Park (officially) is from the Days of our Lives documentary and the quality was great. Now we just need the whole show!
queen,28a84r,twistnroll,1 point,Mon Jun 16 23:26:08 2014 UTC,"The Hammersmith '75 concert may have been on TV a few times, but not in the US.. I have a bootleg DVD of it, but I'd like to see Queen clean up the sound and video on it mostly.  Earls Court '77 and Houston '77 are other shows that have been reported to be ready to release for a while, but I think sound problems plague those really badly..."
queen,28a84r,BurningFlame08,1 point,Wed Jun 18 19:44:47 2014 UTC,"The March show is one of my favourite Queen concerts, it was the first bootleg I got back in 88 and it has such a different sound to the studio albums from the same time.  That 4 LP edition is going to be awesome."

queen,28a8wd,pipi55,5,Mon Jun 16 16:32:00 2014 UTC,"This is sort of a ""pre-show"" - this is to a small theater in LA.  The real arena shows start in Chicago on Thursday."

queen,28a8wd,Batwaffel,2,Mon Jun 16 19:21:26 2014 UTC,"Yea and sadly its only 50% of the original Queen :( I know that we can't get Freddie back, but damn John, we'd like you  back!"
queen,28a8wd,geekstone,2,Mon Jun 16 20:20:16 2014 UTC,"Watching it now. Lambert has an amazing range but I feel like he's way too excited on stage. Granted, he's living the dream playing with his idols, but I feel he lacks professionalism on stage. He's far too excitable. :\  I think he could do a good job is he settles down a little. Lord knows he can't be worse than Paul Rogers was."
queen,28a8wd,gyropyro,1 point,Tue Jun 17 01:40:02 2014 UTC,The best part was Love Kills. There was some good stuff but I thought Adam ruined the chorus to We are the Champions and could have done without some of the cursing but Freddie cursed plenty too
queen,288ocq,Dadanoosh,10,Mon Jun 16 00:32:00 2014 UTC,"You know that Queen in in a league of it's own and no other band is ever going to make the same sound as them (See ""White Man"", ""Innuendo"" or ""The Show Must Go On"" if you don't know them yet). But I can try to recommend something for you...   Pink Floyd - ""Not Now John"" OR ""Run Like Hell"" Not as sharp but I think it's got a similar anger. Meatloaf - ""Bat Out of Hell"" Pure energy, though again, not quite as sharp or angry. Bruce Springsteen - ""Adam Raised A Cain"" Angry, sharp chorus, but very unlike the rest of his music.   And I can't seem to shake the thought of 80's metal...   Iron Maiden - ""The Trooper"" Consistently angry and energetic with a fantastic singer. (Here is a good place to go if you want more Maiden) Dio - ""Holy Diver"" Angry, great vocals, and the rest of the album is fairly similar. Dream Theater - ""The Ytse Jam"" Instrumental prog metal, but any deeper than this and it gets really progressive and really metal.   And when I think angry I think of Jack White and the White Stripes, all much less 80s but's quite agressive...   The White Stripes - ""Icky Thump"" Jack White - ""Lazaretto"" Those solos are nothing but anger.   Turns out this was a hell of a lot harder than I thought. Good Luck."

queen,283i0e,africannigger,3,Sun Jun 15 23:57:13 2014 UTC,"It hurts to choose one, but there's something about the Seven Seas of Rhye that just does it for me. That or Killer Queen. Or Bohemian Rhapsody. Or I Want It All. Or Don't Stop Me Now. Screw it, I'll just go for all of them ever."
queen,283i0e,MrRandomnez,3,Mon Jun 16 12:03:34 2014 UTC,Bohemian Rhapsody is probably my favorite song by anybody.
queen,283i0e,sweetthang1972,2,Sat Jun 14 05:00:34 2014 UTC,It's definitely Don't Stop Me Now. It's rare if a day goes by without me singing that song at least once. Perfect driving song also.
queen,283i0e,foxboy56,2,Sat Jun 14 07:05:57 2014 UTC,I have to post this video every time someone mentions that song.
queen,283i0e,KimberlyInOhio,2,Sat Jun 14 13:32:35 2014 UTC,"Somebody to Love.  Freddie's favorite, too, IIRC."
queen,283i0e,KimberlyInOhio,2,Sat Jun 14 13:32:56 2014 UTC,"I'm gonna split it in two:  70's Queen - My Fairy King  80's/90's Queen - I Was Born To Love You (band version, not solo)"
queen,283i0e,OscarTheTitan,2,Tue Jun 17 23:08:32 2014 UTC,"Probably a three-way tie between March of the Black Queen, Ogre battle and The Prophet's Song. All have such an epic feel and are incredibly well written"
queen,283i0e,Darth_Bowie,2,Wed Jun 18 07:29:27 2014 UTC,"Something eerie and romantic about ""You Take My Breath Away"" that has always given me goosebumps.   I love the song."
queen,283i0e,bluefoot55,2,Fri Jun 20 19:25:11 2014 UTC,"Keep Yourself Alive.  For second place, It's Late.   Third would be Crazy Little Thing Called Love."
queen,283i0e,juicessef,3,Thu Jun 26 19:51:07 2014 UTC,Bohemian Rhapsody!! But there are so many good songs that it makes me feel bad not to say they're all my favourites
queen,283i0e,BlueShoeLover,1 point,Sat Jun 14 08:30:38 2014 UTC,"Ask me yesterday, because it's '39. Ask me today, because it's You Don't Fool Me. Ask me tomorrow, because it's Ogre Battle. Ask me, ask me...."
queen,283i0e,dusmeyedin,5,Sat Jun 14 03:05:19 2014 UTC,'39 was a complete mind blower when I found out what it was really about. It went from being Flash Gordon style sci-fi to being 2001 A Space Odyssey style sci-fi.
queen,283i0e,BlueShoeLover,3,Sat Jun 14 11:26:52 2014 UTC,"I find myself heartbroken for the protagonist. Everything he loves, everything he ever knew, is gone. I bet the suicide rate for those 'volunteers' was pretty high."
queen,283i0e,Madtheswine,3,Sat Jun 14 21:39:03 2014 UTC,"Agreed! I liked it so much that I actually wrote a 3,000 word short story about it for a competition. Sadly, it didn't win, but my March of the Black Queen did."
queen,283i0e,jakdak,1 point,Sat Jun 14 15:22:34 2014 UTC,"Too many to choose from and many are favorites due to nostalgia from when I first got the respective album vs the song itself.  But if I had to pick one it would be ""I Want It All"""
queen,27yk1m,OscarTheTitan,14,Thu Jun 12 12:39:30 2014 UTC,Do we consider that Paul Rogers abomination a Queen album?
queen,27yk1m,jakdak,6,Thu Jun 12 14:23:01 2014 UTC,"Other than that one, ""Made In Heaven"" always struck me as being B-side filler they cobbled together off the cutting room floor after Freddie died."
queen,27yk1m,jakdak,7,Thu Jun 12 14:29:29 2014 UTC,"Hot Space. I remember watching a queen documentary and brian or roger was saying how most the album sounds like you just walked into a gay club. I do like life is real though, and the albums not bad, just not my style"
queen,27yk1m,gallowdp,1 point,Thu Jun 12 16:19:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it was Roger.  I actually like it though, even if most of it is nothing compared to... every album before it?"
queen,27yk1m,KumoNin,4,Sun Jun 15 16:50:35 2014 UTC,I would say the Hot Space is the de facto worst album mostly due to how it was produced more than anything else. Live as evidenced by Queen at the bowl many of those songs are vastly improved a hybrid live/studio Hot Space would be pretty good if you ask me.
queen,27yk1m,geekstone,3,Fri Jun 13 02:39:28 2014 UTC,"There's only a few songs on The Miracle that I like (I Want It All, Breakthru, Scandal), the rest are forgettable or downright awful. Every other album is either all around exceptional or has it's saving graces, but to me there is not enough to make up for the overwhelming mediocrity of this one. The lyrics are probably among their laziest too (aside from A Kind of Magic)."
queen,27yk1m,Louisxxii,2,Thu Jun 12 22:25:49 2014 UTC,Flash Gordon.   It's 3 songs and then the rest is all a score with pieces of the movie thrown in.
queen,27yk1m,jcphillips99,7,Fri Jun 20 06:27:08 2014 UTC,"A Kind of Magic is the worst album in my opinion. It's a half-assed soundtrack with some other songs chucked on. There are good moments, but overall it's a half-baked effort and doesn't come across as a coherent album.   Hot Space is often considered among the worst, and quite rightly so. However there are some lovely songs on there if you avoid things like Body Language. Hot Space was far better live, see the Live at the Bowl DVD for proof. Staying Power rocks, as does Back Chat."
queen,27yk1m,Dr-Sardonicus,3,Thu Jun 12 14:00:29 2014 UTC,"Gotta disagree. The guitar work and singing on that album is superb, even by Queen standards. Roger and John did take a bit of a subdued role, but they contributed some killer fucking songs."
queen,27yk1m,zerocoke,3,Fri Jun 13 04:45:38 2014 UTC,"Hot Space is overall garbage.  Although I have my guilty pleasures like 'Cool Cat' the truth is, it's horrible.  Almost nothing that makes Queen who they were before and after that album is present on Hot Space.  I always say though, if Queen, the greatest band in the history of mankind can put out a garbage album like that.... I don't feel so bad when I screw up here and there :)"
queen,27yk1m,innuen-doh,2,Thu Jun 12 21:25:14 2014 UTC,"Hot Space is rubbish, the whole thing."
queen,27yk1m,KimberlyInOhio,1 point,Fri Jun 13 01:39:13 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying that I dislike any Queen albums, but if I had to choose which were my least favorite, I would be torn between Innuendo and The Game. Ride the Wild Wind and Coming Soon are probably my two least favorite songs and the rest of the respective albums just didn't spark the same Queen feeling as their others for me.  On the other hand, I'm a bit odd in that Hot Space is one of my favorites for a reason I can't quite pin down. The same with Jazz, both of which are commonly put down."
queen,27yk1m,Madtheswine,2,Fri Jun 13 03:56:43 2014 UTC,"Funny, Ride the Wild Wind and Coming Soon are actually up there in favorability for me :) Also Jazz is fucking awesome"
queen,27yk1m,danarbok,1 point,Fri Jun 13 14:37:49 2014 UTC,"Made in Heaven. It sounds too cheesy and 80's. Hell, the second side of Hot Space is better."
queen,27yk1m,TheInsaneDane,1 point,Thu Jun 12 22:29:15 2014 UTC,"I don't really dislike any Queen album, but judging by how many songs of every album that i listen to regularly i'd have to say that Innuendo and It's a Kind of Magic has the least songs that i like. Some songs seem a bit filler to me."
queen,27yk1m,zerocoke,-4,Thu Jun 12 15:06:08 2014 UTC,"Queen II. tbh I just don't get it lol   Seven seas of rhye is one of my favorite songs, though. It set the tone for what Queen would become IMO."

queen,27a6ta,KimberlyInOhio,6,Wed Jun 4 21:00:33 2014 UTC,I'm so excited!  I really really hope they play Somebody To Love and Fat Bottomed Girls!  Going to the Detroit show next month. :)

queen,27a6ta,two,4,Thu Jun 5 04:12:38 2014 UTC,"I'm not looking for a particular song. I'm more so looking for performances that emphasize Brian and Roger. I mean, Adam Lambert may be good, or bad, or whatever, but I'm not going to see him.  So, you know, '39, LOML, TATDOOL, etc."
queen,27a6ta,BlueShoeLover,4,Wed Jun 4 23:06:10 2014 UTC,Took me a minute to figure out TATDOOL. :D

queen,2758ho,Exoguana,5,Tue Jun 3 01:09:16 2014 UTC,"I'm 14, been for about a year. I always loved classic rock, and my parents took me to a Garry Mullen (Freddie Mercury impersonator) concert for my 13th birthday   That was possibly the best night of my life."
queen,2758ho,nsqueen119,2,Mon Jun 2 21:38:05 2014 UTC,"That is awesome!  I went to One Night of Queen in Cincinnati. It was at the Aronoff Centre, and most of the audience didn't know that it was a rock show. I, on the other hand, sung and danced in the aisles. The show was great! The closest to Queen I've seen!"
queen,2758ho,SkaraBrae,5,Tue Jun 3 01:28:42 2014 UTC,"My older brother bought Queens greatest on LP when I was about 7. We only had the one turntable, so we all listened when it was played. Then he started buying the older albums... The Game... News of the World... Sheer Heart Attack... Then a Kind of Magic was released. Not long after that we had the whole back catalog. Then Live Magic, then the Miracle, Innuendo, Wembley. I also have CD's of ""the unobtainable royal chronicles"" 1 and 2 which have Larry Lurex and Smile songs, as well as some studio outtakes, 12"" versions and b-sides. There was a 20 years magazine that was released which I've got somewhere...  Then Freddie died. I was (and still am, over 20 years later) gutted. Something died in me, that day.  I was excited about Made in Heaven. I was not disappointed. I'm excited about the new material. I can't wait... I only hope that somehow John is involved. Without Freddie and John, it's not really Queen.  TL:DR I started listening to Queen in about 1985. Their music never gets old."
queen,2758ho,JustAChicagoGirl,1 point,Tue Jun 3 12:11:02 2014 UTC,"I was in high school when Freddie died. Although I knew of Queen, I was not yet the obsessed fanatic I am today (I only listened to classical music at that time in my life). This might sound bad, but I'm actually glad that I wasn't into them at the time. It saved my heart from being completely crushed."
queen,2758ho,jakdak,3,Tue Jun 3 17:02:33 2014 UTC,"Very young- my mom had GH1 on LP and I remember loving Bohemian Rhapsody as a grade school kid.  ""The Game"" came out when I was in 5th grade and for years this was the only 8 track we had in our family van.  Probably listened to that tape 1000 times.  ""Day at the Races"" was the 1st cassette I ever purchased.   ""The Miracle"" the first CD (in the old long style CD boxes)"
queen,2758ho,AnInsolentCog,3,Tue Jun 3 04:48:33 2014 UTC,"I always liked their stuff, from the time I was really young. My first memory starts allllllllll the way back when 'Killer Queen' came out, and was getting regular airplay, and hearing it in my dads car.. same thing for 'Bohemian Rhapsody', 'We Will Rock You', 'Bicycle Race'... but I had no clue who they were, let alone that it was all the same group. Plus I was a little kid, so I wasn't that interested in music yet. I just enjoyed it.  Years go by, and radio play of their songs in my area drops off, and I forget all about those songs.  I was about 13 when I saw the video for 'Play The Game', and I reallllllly liked the song (especially the heavy riff bit), and my mom bought me a copy of the album for my birthday. Then 'Flash Gordon' (movie and S/T) happened, and I liked both as well...  ..but it wasn't a big deal.. yet...   Shortly after that, my cousin was getting rid of a lot of old LP's he had, and among the ones he gave me was 'Live Killers'.. Cool! I'll take this home and check this out.. Put side one on the turn table, and, well.. my Queen-Matrix moment happened..   All those songs I heard as a kid came pouring into my ears.. not only was the memory recall intense, but these were all from the same band I only 'just' got into a little bit... (insert 'MIND BLOWN!!' image here)  Die hard fan and collector ever since, up until Mr. Mercury's death.   tl;dr : Since I was 5 or something. I am greybeard."
queen,2758ho,JustAChicagoGirl,2,Tue Jun 3 20:57:34 2014 UTC,"It was 1998. I was in graduate school. I was half watching VH-1 Legends and half practicing my clarinet. My attention was soon 100% on VH-1 Legends. After that, I bought my first Queen CD, Greatest Hits. Within weeks, I was saving up my money to buy all their albums, in chronological order."
queen,2758ho,ferncorre,2,Mon Jun 2 21:38:46 2014 UTC,"Sometime around early 1992. I was 8,going on 9 years old. Bitter sweet because it was right after Freddie died, but as a result, Queen was ALWAYS on the radio or on MTV or VH-1.  I had my older brother record the tribute concert on VHS when it aired on MTV. I wore that tape out by the end of the summer.  I also now feel kind of ancient talking about VHS. :)"
queen,2758ho,KimberlyInOhio,2,Mon Jun 2 21:55:10 2014 UTC,"I was in my 40s, about 5 years ago?  I had heard some casually but wasn't impressed, then heard Somebody to Love and was blown away.  Downloaded all the albums and listened to Queen non-stop for over a year.  I'm on to Rush now (I mostly only listen to one band at a time), but will be going to Detroit next month to see Queen + Adam Lambert.  I'm really looking forward to it!"
queen,2758ho,Batwaffel,2,Mon Jun 2 22:21:55 2014 UTC,"I was very young, I can't even tell you how old. Queen was a big part of pop culture back then (in the 80's) and they quickly became my favourite band. The Tribute Concert was really the turning point in my life that made me realize that I wanted to be a performer. Was already a musician at that point but was never really drilled in that it was what I wanted to do with my life."
queen,2758ho,NyuuTwo,2,Mon Jun 2 22:31:12 2014 UTC,"I've been listening to Queen for as long as I can remember (usually if my parents played the CDs in the car or something), but I really got into them when I was about 11 and a friend of my parents loaned me his copy of Queen II. Not long after that, I was listening to all of their albums and going to see Queen + Paul Rodgers in Jacksonville. Queen II is my favorite album to this day."
queen,2758ho,Babyhedgehog,2,Mon Jun 2 22:50:27 2014 UTC,"15 for me. In the two years since, it's been an uphill struggle to get my friends to recognize that true music is far superior to computer generated crap. It's good to see another young fan!"
queen,2758ho,Weed_n_Wisdom,2,Mon Jun 2 22:52:28 2014 UTC,Yeah probably around the same age. Maybe a bit younger.
queen,2758ho,StupidTVBeMoreFunny,2,Mon Jun 2 23:13:16 2014 UTC,"I'm in my late 30s. My earliest memory was hearing and loving Another One Bites the Dust on the radio when it came out. But it really started when I was 12 and my brother gave me a tape with vinyl copies of Greatest Hits and News of the World recorded on each side of the tape. Just fell in love with every single song. When Hollywood Records started releasing all their stuff on CD in the USA (where I live), I finally started picking up each album as I could afford them and, again, just falling in love with each one after the other. I had just reached a new level of my relationship with the band when Freddie died..."
queen,2758ho,nsqueen119,2,Tue Jun 3 00:50:34 2014 UTC,"I was a big 'Weird Al' Yankovic fan. He had released Alapalooza, and the final track on the album is Bohemian Polka, which is a polka cover of Bo Rhap. This was after Freddie had passed, but around the time that Queen popped back on the charts, due to the success of Wayne's World.  I had the cassette, and listened to that track over and over... Soon after, my Grandmother bought me a copy of classic Queen. Obsession start.  Queen penned the soundtrack to most of my life."
queen,2758ho,anothergamer,2,Tue Jun 3 01:36:47 2014 UTC,whatever my first baseball game i went to so that was 1996 i was 4
queen,2758ho,BlueShoeLover,2,Tue Jun 3 02:28:47 2014 UTC,"When I was growing up, my parents would put on the Greatest Hits record just about every Saturday morning. QUEEN has just always been.... there. Roger said in an interview that the band has become ""part of the wallpaper"" and I think that's very true. They're the soundtrack to our lives, even if we don't realise it."
queen,2758ho,RandolphMoneybags,2,Tue Jun 3 03:50:15 2014 UTC,My dad played the Jazz album cassette everywhere we went. My favorite song in kindergarten was Fat Bottomed Girls. Not much has changed.     Edited for autocorrect. Sorry.

queen,2758ho,miss_smash,2,Tue Jun 3 08:36:06 2014 UTC,"About 7. My parents belonged to a music catalogue where you ordered a CD every six weeks or so, and I'd been waiting and waiting to get the new Spice Girls CD (this was 1997...), but Dad ordered A Night At the Opera instead. I threw biggest shit-fit and sulked for days, until the CD turned up and Dad put it on...  The rest is history :)"
queen,2758ho,RJB6,2,Tue Jun 3 08:19:01 2014 UTC,Pretty sure I came out of the womb headbanging to Bohemian Rhapsody. My parents would put on the greatest hits at parties and all the kids would lip synch and dance around.
queen,2758ho,LeftHandedGuitarist,2,Tue Jun 3 09:11:41 2014 UTC,"I was 2 years old and Radio Ga Ga had just been released, it was on the radio a lot. My mum says I loved it and used to knock on doors during the bit with the low thudding synth in the middle. Some of my earliest musical memories are Queen on stage at Wembley which must have been broadcast on TV in the 80s.  I didn't really get into the band until about 1990. I can't remember what set it off, but I started collecting their albums either in the 2nd hand record shop in my town or by renting them from a mobile library that came near our house. When Innuendo came out I was on holiday in America and bought the album there.  I remember Freddie dying, I was 10 years old and my mum woke me up and told me the news, then I had to go to school. I really didn't want to."
queen,2758ho,ozzraven,2,Tue Jun 3 10:14:11 2014 UTC,13 in 1991. Thanks the awesome video of Innuendo.
queen,2758ho,belladonnic_haze,2,Wed Jun 4 03:17:18 2014 UTC,"Oh, I feel old! I was two when Bohemian Rhapsody was first released in 1975 - my dad was a fan, and as a toddler I would sit for hours with my dad's headphones on, listening to the vinyl over and over again. I've loved Queen for almost my entire life."
queen,2758ho,13striden,2,Wed Jun 4 08:58:33 2014 UTC,"i was about 3, in 1999.  my dad had all of the video tapes and used to blast them every friday night, particularly the wembley one.  no regrets there! safe to say i think i had a good upbringing."
queen,2758ho,elderpo23,2,Wed Jun 4 11:11:47 2014 UTC,"2 years ago, 14, in Barcelona (you can see where the connection came). Probably the first person to enter the Queen universe through Freddie's solo career!!"
queen,2758ho,Druston,2,Thu Jun 5 16:16:31 2014 UTC,"I'm going on 25 in December. You could say that I've been listening to them for that long. My mother raised me on four bands/artists: Queen, Nine Inch Nails, Pearl Jam, and Sarah McLachlan. Queen got the most play during my childhood."
queen,2758ho,zecgamo77,2,Sat Jun 7 09:30:11 2014 UTC,"I was making a 80's compilation in 2009, i was 13. I listened to ""Another one bites the dust"", and i fell in love with this awesome band ! However, AOBTD is no longer my favorite Queen's song"
queen,2758ho,OscarTheTitan,2,Sat Jun 7 17:17:04 2014 UTC,"Well, technically I listened to and enjoyed songs like We Will Rock You, We Are The Champions and Another One Bites The Dust when I was ~8 Years old because they were and still are cultural icons. It wasn't until recently in about 2012 when a mate showed me Bicycle Race. After that I was hooked. Every album, every DVD I bought and loved."

I'd always heard their hits on the radio and stuff but never got around to buying any of their albums. They always struck me as a band I'd probably really like, but for one reason or another I just never got around to getting into them. I bought A Night at the Opera used a couple years ago and that was it, man."

I had a crappy childhood and their music was the only thing that made me happy as a kid. Brian May was my boyhood hero."
queen,2758ho,dannfisher,1 point,Sun Jul 27 04:18:53 2014 UTC,"I know people will generally not believe me, but I remember when I was about 3 years old, in 1996, my dad had Greatest Hits on a cassette which we played in the old Renault all the time. I grew up with Queen. When we cleaned the house, the TV would go off and we would put the record player on and play News Of The World and Live Magic and Kind of Magic. I'm 21 now so for 18 years of my life, Queen have been a massive part of me. I was gutted when the cassette broke as a child so we made sure to buy the CD version! But I remember Brian May and Roger Taylor doing an interview/show on VH1 years ago which I recorded on VHS about the greatest Queen songs/videos when the show was over, they played a concert, it wasn't Montreal (i'm sure) but it had a fast We Will Rock You towards the beginning, if anyone happens to know, please let me know!!!!"

queen,272ern,og_penson,9,Sun Jun 1 23:27:36 2014 UTC,"Nigger sugar is an ancient expression for raw cane sugar. During the slavery period, sugar was brought from Africa, where it had been extracted from sugar-cane. This extraction process was done by the slaves, who stamped it with their feet. After this, the raw sugar was further processed to clear it. The cheapest sugar was not post-processed and thus kept its brown colour. However, people believed that the brown colour came from the feet of the slaves, and thus this sugar soon was referred to as ""nigger sugar"". Only the rich people could afford white sugar, and nigger sugar had to suffice for the poor.   source"

I Want It All - intro removed, awesome solo in the middle taken out Hammer to Fall - middle section removed, outro shortened Fat Bottomed Girls - intro removed, instrumental bit in the middle removed, outro removed Heaven for Everyone - short vocal section in the middle shortened Who Wants to Live Forever - entire orchestral ending and guitar outro removed   Strangely, the single version of I Want to Break Free has a ton of extra stuff which was not on the album version."
queen,270trh,OscarTheTitan,1 point,Tue Jun 3 10:21:07 2014 UTC,Probably because the single is more radio friendly because it doesn't take as long to get into the song. I think there is a similar situation with Fat Bottom Girls
queen,26y1bn,elderpo23,4,Sat May 31 08:47:28 2014 UTC,"This is possibly my favourite unreleased/demo Queen song. Would also love to hear completed version, it's just too bad there's no really 2nd verse, Freddie's just ad-libbing some da-di-da's there, maybe Brian/Roger could sing it then? The first verse by Freddie is magnificent, by the way!"

queen,26u8do,notesonthebrain,4,Fri May 30 02:10:44 2014 UTC,"70s, Queen II is my favourite album because of its more proggy stuff. Then again, I also like Innuendo because it goes in the same direction. Not saying I dislike any Queen song, these are my favourites."
queen,26u8do,JSW2K7,3,Fri May 30 18:23:53 2014 UTC,All of it! HUGE QUEEN Fan here!
queen,26u8do,89bmwm3,3,Fri May 30 14:32:42 2014 UTC,Definitely 70s for me; their compositions were much more complex and interesting.  The 80s/90s stuff was too conventional and dancey/synthy.
queen,26u8do,G581,4,Fri May 30 23:23:25 2014 UTC,"When I was younger,  I preferred 80s/90s. Now a days ill listen to SHEER, ANATO, ADATR, NEWS, & THE GAME from front to back at any given time while just choosing select tracks from everything else. What it really comes down to is the ""4 on the floor"" approach of the first 8 years. Meaning they all play together live and no synths or drum machines. For example: from Hot Space on you could probably count on two hands the number of tracks Roger played on an acoustic drum kit. I could go on and on but you get the point. The boys got a bit too complacent and didn't feel the need to push themselves creatively.  That all being said, Innuendo is probably my favorite album of the 2nd period."
queen,26u8do,Mick_Wyld,2,Fri May 30 06:30:56 2014 UTC,80s/90s easy! Love The works the best!
queen,26u8do,AlwaysDrunkLiterally,1 point,Fri May 30 04:47:46 2014 UTC,"I've evolved. For the longest time, I was purely an early-mid 70's Queen fan. I thought their first five albums were works of perfection. After that, they seemed to progressively go downhill. I only liked a handful of songs from the 80/90's. All their CD's after The Game just sat on the shelf collecting dust. But 15 years later, I'm really getting into their 80s/90s stuff. A couple of months ago, out of the blue, I decided that I needed to convert all my Queen CD's to mp3's (I previously had only converted their first 8 albums) and had the player on shuffle. All of a sudden, I hear this song that I quite liked, but didn't recognize. Looked up to see that it was Queen's Breakthru. So I decided to listen to The Miracle from front to finish. Still don't like the first 2 tracks, but ended up loving all the rest. So, I decided to give their other works a try. The rest is history."
queen,26u8do,JustAChicagoGirl,0,Mon Jun 2 21:54:26 2014 UTC,"Mercury's voice during the 70s was far superior to his voice during the 80s, so I strongly prefer 70s stuff."

queen,26pz8z,ozzraven,22,Wed May 28 19:30:53 2014 UTC,"Let's see what Steve Vai say about him:   ""I don't think enough is really said about the brilliance of Brian May's guitar playing, inthe sense that it's overshadowed by the music itself. The Queen II album was one of those pivotal moments that just nailed me to the wall.  ""He's probably one of the top identifiable guitar players, even more so than Beck, Page, and Clapton. They're all so identifiable, but Brian May has such a tone in his head and in his fingers. It speaks volumes. His contribution to orchestrated guitars is unprecedented. There was nothing like it before him. To me, it was like when Edward Van Halen came along and reshaped the sound of electric guitar. That's what I heard in Brian May's playing. It's something that's inherent in the brain of the guitar player.  ""I remember working with Frank Zappa for the first time. I had just moved out to Los Angeles, and nobody knew me. I was 21. I went out to the Rainbow Bar and Grill, and Brian May was there. I couldn't believe it. I mustered up every little bit of courage and went up to him and said, 'Thank you so much for everything you've done. I play guitar. I'm here in town with Frank Zappa.' He said 'Oh really? Why don't you come down to our rehearsal?'  ""I went down and he brought me up on the stage, and he let me play the guitar-the guitar that he built with his dad [the ""Red Special""]. I couldn't even believe that I was touching this instrument! He was so kind and so warm, and for who? This kid, you know? And I played his guitar, and it sounded like Steve Vai. Then when he played it, it sounded just like Brian May. It was very apparent to me that his tone is in his fingers and his head.  ""He's a class act from head to toe, and it shows in his playing. I can listen to any player and pantomime their sound, but I can't do Brian May. He's just walking on higher ground.""   http://www.queenonline.com/en/news-archive/steve-vai-on-brian-may/  http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/brian-may-20111122  That's enough for me.  And remember, May and van halen did an album together."
queen,26pz8z,two,14,Wed May 28 21:39:17 2014 UTC,"I would posit that the only reason Brian May is not as renown as other guitarists, even in the guitar community, is that what he did has never been done before, and has never been done since.  You can play like Jimmy Page. You can play like Eddie Van Halen. It's not easy, but it's doable, it's fun, and there's no better launchpad for discovering your own sound. That's why both of them single-handedly spawned legions of guitarists in their image. That's why both of their names echo throughout the galaxy.  But even if you can somehow play like Brian May, it's still difficult to wrap your head around how to apply that sound in practice, except in the context of a Queen song. And if you were somehow to do something original with it, inevitably it sounds like little more than a cheap imitation, thus further dissuading you from the pursuit."

queen,26pz8z,AnInsolentCog,9,Wed May 28 23:30:16 2014 UTC,"As much as I personally feel Brian is one of the greatest guitarists ever, I think his strengths are in the composition, production, and engineering aspects of his sound, both live and in the studio, more than his 'shredding' abilities.  That said, I think the man can shred with the best of them, and has. Brian was 'finger tapping' while Eddie Van Halen was still in guitar diapers. He just used it differently than Eddie. Also, I am fairly sure that both Eddie and Slash consider him one of their idols and inspiration for picking up the instrument. I'm not 100% on that point, though."
queen,26pz8z,AlwaysDrunkLiterally,4,Wed May 28 20:35:32 2014 UTC,Slash never shuts up about how much of an inspiration Brian May is hahaha

queen,26pz8z,og_penson,7,Thu May 29 13:49:13 2014 UTC,"Some say he is only famous because of Queen.   Of course he is. The only people who love listening to an instrumentalist on his own being virtuosic are people who play that instrument and/or have an obsession with virtuosity. Everyone else cares for the songs first and foremost. Solid / virtuosic playing is merely the foundation / icing on the cake.   What can I say to prove that Brian May is, or isn't, a good guitarist?   Why would you need to do that? Everyone is entitled their own opinion. Does your opinion on him depend on what other people think of him (or you)?   If we were to compare Brian May to, say, Slash or Edward Van Halen, would he stand a chance?   What exactly does ""good"" mean? Who is better, one who can play very fast but fails at tapping or one one who is a master at tapping but not as fast as the other one?  Music, like any art, is not a competition. And the appreciation of art is entirely subjective."

queen,265bi7,AnInsolentCog,6,Thu May 22 06:39:22 2014 UTC,"I'd rate Queen as one of my favourite bands of all time yet when I thought about it all I'd every listened to was Greatest Hits I and II.   I've just got into vinyl and was flicking through my grandparents collection when I came across a single of BoRap but on the B side was a song I'd never heard - I'm In Love With My Car.   Long story short I've decided to work through the Queen discography, in order, one at a time with the idea of expanding my vinyl collection and filling in all the Queen songs I've missed.  Trying to get each record in the best condition / lowest pressing without going overboard money wise.  Having a lot of fun.  My fav tracks so far are:  Queen: Keep Yourself Alive, Great King Rat  Queen II: Orgre Battle, The March of the Black Queen  SHA: Brighton Rock, Now I'm Here"

queen,25l8li,DaTigerMan,13,Thu May 15 01:31:17 2014 UTC,"I don't think anyone hates him?  Basically from what I've read/seen, he was very close with Mr. Mercury and took his death pretty badly. Also he was always a shy person and after Freddie died he felt like Queen also died with him. He doesn't want publicity and doesn't even keep contact with May and Taylor much."
queen,25l8li,Oldgrain,2,Thu May 15 05:44:33 2014 UTC,I read on queenpedia that he was actually invited to play on the Queen + Paul Rodgers album. That was in 2007/8. So it's not for lack of trying from the other guys.  http://www.queenpedia.com/index.php?title=The_Cosmos_Rocks  P.S. That's a great sight to really dive deeper in the behind the scenes and other gems.
queen,25l8li,stiggymarz,1 point,Tue May 20 03:11:30 2014 UTC,"I respect him. I think he knew when to quit.  Say what you will about Adam Lambert and Paul Rodgers, but it'll never be the same"
queen,25l8li,africannigger,6,Fri May 23 08:36:14 2014 UTC,"I don't get the impression that everyone hates him. Roger and Brian seem to only speak well of him when they're asked.  I think, because he's not in the public eye at all, it's very easy for us to ascribe motivations, intentions or feelings onto him. We've got no way of knowing exactly what's going on in his life, and it seems he's keen to keep it that way."
queen,25l8li,BlueShoeLover,2,Thu May 15 08:58:00 2014 UTC,"Ah, okay, I thought some of the fans disliked him. Thanks!"
queen,25l8li,AnInsolentCog,2,Thu May 15 11:21:24 2014 UTC,"I for one don't. I actually admire his stance and actions regarding the band after Freddie's death.   I am on the fence with Brian and Rodger, though. On one hand, they are keeping as alive in the public eye as much they can. On the other hand, they are milking it for every penny it's worth."
queen,25l8li,you_shouldnt_have,1 point,Thu May 15 14:20:32 2014 UTC,"I used to be of a similar opinion, and someone made the very valid point to me: music is what they do, and their whole life theyve been wanting to reach out to as many people as possible. They get told on a daily basis that their music has had a positive impact on people's lives. Why would they want to give that up?  Roger also makes the point that it's their band, and when Freddie was ill he basically said ""I dont give a shit what you do with my music, just make sure I'm not boring!""  Got to say, aside from the occassional dodgy GH release, they've been pretty fun.  As for the ""every penny its worth"" yep, youre probably right. That said, you can't fault Brian for putting his resources into making sure wildlife gets a fair go. Buying up countryside so people can't shoot animals - I can think of worse ways to spend your kids inheritance. (Plus if its considered farmland they wont have to pay inheritance tax. Very clever)."
queen,25l8li,AnInsolentCog,1 point,Tue May 20 13:10:17 2014 UTC,"I have no problem with them going forward and making new music (good or bad), but I do have problems with them doing under the Queen banner. To me, Queen wasn't any single person, Freddie included. It was the 4 of them. Queen are to me what the Beatles were to my parents. It's just how I feel. No slight against anyone else who feels differently. Please, enjoy.  As for milking it... I have no problem with that either, but I do have issues with them making highly overpriced boxed sets of their back cataloge, memorabilia, etc.. they have made gobs and gobs and gobs of cash over the decades, it wouldn't hurt them to not gouge their current and potentially new fans so much. I would, however, probably pay out the nose for any remastered stuff from the archives, particularly the stuff that was never released!  As for the work Brian does outside of Queen (Badgers, photography, astro / radio physics, etc...) I have nothing but pride for the man.   Personally, I think all three of them are fine people. But, Queen - as an active group - died for me back in the nineties. Any other configuration of those artists will never be the same to me."

queen,24wr73,tinylaugh,5,Wed May 7 00:05:26 2014 UTC,It's absolutely my favorite Freddie solo song. It has some of his strongest singing.
queen,24wr73,dreamerkid001,8,Wed May 7 03:44:50 2014 UTC,"No one seems to remember it.  I used to sing it all the time, and people kept asking me what it was.  Not one single person that I knew had any idea that Freddie sang it.  Shame.  It's lovely."
queen,24wr73,og_penson,3,Wed May 7 02:20:25 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't mind a ""Queen"" version of this. I always thought it was the most Queen-sounding song of his solo career but I guess the fact that he didn't write it has something to do with it."
queen,24wr73,dusmeyedin,3,Wed May 7 09:27:20 2014 UTC,"I love it, just instinctively, and I couldn't figure out why. So I sat down and puzzled out the chords on piano.  The piano prelude is based on the classic 50s progression (1 - 6 - 4 - 5, think of the chorus chords to We Are Young for a more recent example). Then as Freddie gets into the refrain (""I'm just a singer with a song"") the bass runs descending intervals from 1 down to 4 and back up to 5. The actual upbeat to Freddie's chorus (""I'm just a"") is a very common note progression - see Little Shop of Horrors (""But then there's Audrey, lovely Audrey"").  The song itself is from a stage rock musical too, so this tribute to ballads and power anthems is entirely fitting.  It's fun to play on the piano too!"
queen,24wr73,drowse,2,Wed May 7 14:16:42 2014 UTC,The 50s progression might make sense as Dave Clark (from the Dave Clark Five) wrote the song.  I do like this song quite a bit as well.

I learned my passion in the good old fashioned school of loverboys- Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely I will pay the bill, you taste the wine Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely Just take me back to yours that will be fine (Come on and get it)  Ooh love, Ooh loverboy What're you doin' tonight, hey boy - Everything's all right Just hold on tight - That's because I'm a good old fashioned loverboy"

queen,2459xw,SexWithTwins,11,Mon Apr 28 00:31:15 2014 UTC,"no offence, but this sounds like a bunch of crap stitched together from some gossip someone heard ""in the business"" and other bits he hadded so it made sense to him... I bet Jacky Smith from the official fanclub has had more contact with anyone of Queen then someone in music publishing...   It turns out that this was because of something that happened during the 1978 / 79 tour; which resulted in Brian and Roger basically wanting to kick John out of the group. John had become interested in electronic music, and MIDI sequencing, and wanted to head off into a more 'disco' sound. So did Freddie.   Roger was always the one interested in new technologies and was the one responsible for bringing synths to Queen and going more 'electronic' (although not 'disco')   BUT, they still owed the record company three albums   so what? there are a million ways out of a scenario like that...   and some concert promoters had also said they would sue if these albums weren't supported by a tour   that's just ridiculous, really   Fred Mandel — who helped John put together a little track called Another One Bites the Dust   Fred Mandel startet working with them in the Hot Space era (after the album was already done, IIRC) so that makes no sense   Once the ghost tracks were finished, and it was time for guitars, vocals, and drum overdubs, John simply wasn't around.   Another One Bites The Dust was constructed around a drum-loop (which if you listen to in isolation also contains faint bass guitar, so they definitely recorded it live together), and although Roger famously disliked that drum sound he was fine with trying out stuff like drum loops, etc.   He would come in at the end to make any changes which were needed to the songs he wrote, but it was always on days when Brian and Roger weren't around.   all of them were often working alone in the studio even in the early days   Even the drum track is a Roland (or possibly Linn) Drum Machine.   all of them (producers including) did drum programming from ""Hot Space"" onwards   John found out Brian had dubbed a guitar solo onto it and John wanted the whole track to be electronic instruments only. The compromise on the guitar solo was that Brian would play it on a MIDI guitar controller — hence that whacky 'dow dow dow dow daaaaaw' sound.  EDIT: I've just checked and Fred Mandel performed the synth solo on I Want to Break Free by layering over the solo Brian originally recorded, because the MIDI guitar controller Brian wanted to use had a timing issue.   Fred Mandel recorded his solo as a demo and everyone (but Brian) liked it so it stayed. He didn't record over anything Brian had done. (as he told in ""Days Of Our Lives"")   After The Works tour ended, they essentially split Queen up without making a press announcement. Then Live Aid happened   There were exactly 2 months between the last tour date and Live Aid, just saying... It is true though that they had planned a somewhat longer hiatus. 'The Works' was very successful everywhere but in the US even before Live Aid. Live Aid was more of a moral boost   If it hadn't have been for Freddie becoming sick The Miracle and Innuendo would have never happened. Freddie basically took John, Brian and Roger to one side and said, 'we're going to work together until I can't work anymore, and you're going to get on with one another come hell or high water' and they had no choice but to agree, for the sake of their friend.   He hadn't told them anything when they got back together for ""The Miracle""   and as far as anyone knows he hasn't even been to see it.   Roger said in an interview with MOJO in November last year that the last time he'd seen John, was in the early days of the musical when John suddenly walked in. And if you don't believe that there's still this If he was unhappy about it do you think he'd gone in to see it, let alone do it in public?   He simply wasn't asked.   Well, if he made it clear to them, that he was 'retired' and didn't want any more to do with anything why should they ask him? That being said, IIRC they mentioned asking him in 2005 with no answer or something like that.  Let's not forget that John and Roger were the driving force behind ""Made In Heaven"" (in the beginning). And even though one could argue that John only did this for Freddie, then why the hell would he come back 2 years after that for a live performance AND a brand new studio recording?  Even if you choose not to believe what Brian & Roger say (and maybe Jim Beach), your best sources are those who actually were with them in the studio and on tour: read the books written by Jim Hutton and Peter ""Phoebe"" Freestone and more recently Peter ""Ratty"" Hince, and read or listen to interviews with Fred Mandel, Reinhold Mack and David Richards. Neither of those has/had any reason to lie about things like this.  All of them (including Brian & Roger) acknowledge that there were problems within the band in their Munich days (first half of the 80s), as Brian said it so fittingly in ""Days Of Our Lives"" that they all got themselves in deep emotional trouble then.  Mack said in a German TV special last year that John did battle depression and losing a friend and the occasional drink certainly didn't help this."

For one thing, I Want To Break Free was based around John's acoustic guitar playing which is all in the final mix, no electronic instruments there."

queen,2459xw,89bmwm3,2,Mon Apr 28 05:32:13 2014 UTC,It's explained in the next sentence. It's the split in ideologies about future band directions.
queen,2459xw,strongbob25,7,Mon Apr 28 02:24:28 2014 UTC,"I see where the above user's confusion is, though. That sentence makes it sound like there was some specific event that happened that made Roger and Brian want to kick out John. After all, the next next sentence said that Freddie also wanted to go electronic. So if that was the only reason, wouldn't they have equally wanted to kick out both John and Freddie?  I dunno; the wording was just a little ambiguous to me."
queen,2459xw,dc880610,2,Mon Apr 28 03:21:27 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure all four members were well aware that Queen = Freddie. Despite the relatively recent change of heart of Roger and Brian, I'm pretty sure all three living members would still agree that this is essentially true."

queen,2459xw,bupmex,2,Mon Apr 28 16:17:43 2014 UTC,"Very interesting. Thank you for posting! I have a rough idea who it might be but I won't say anything. I've always assumed Deaky was simply content raking in royalties for the songs he wrote and didn't want anything to do with ""Queen +"". >Without giving too much away, and to cut a very long story short, I've just got back from a party / record launch for a band I've been working with, and I got talking to an old boy from the publishing company.  Turns out he used to work for Queen back in the day, and is still in touch with some of the people who work with them now.  Naturally I wanted to ask him a bunch of questions, but I didn't want to bore him to death.  So I thought to myself, 'what would /r/Queen want to know?', and so I asked about John Deacon.   We megafans don't really like to think about it too much, but it's already a matter of public record that Roger and Brian really didn't get on too well with John at all.  It turns out that this was because of something that happened during the 1978 / 79 tour; which resulted in Brian and Roger basically wanting to kick John out of the group.  John had become interested in electronic music, and MIDI sequencing, and wanted to head off into a more 'disco' sound.  So did Freddie.  So, Freddie took some time out to concentrate on his solo career (which ended up taking nearly 5 years to get together and lost a bunch of money), and Queen basically ceased to exist.  BUT, they still owed the record company three albums — and some concert promoters had also said they would sue if these albums weren't supported by a tour.  So, because Freddie had remained neutral in the argument with John, as of The Game / Flash / Hot Space, John only worked on the pre-production demos with Freddie and a friend of his, a production assistant / keyboard player / MIDI programmer named Fred Mandel — who helped John put together a little track called Another One Bites the Dust — which, much to the chagrin of Brian and Roger, became their first US number 1 hit single.  This gave John the room he needed to work almost independently from the rest of the group.  Once the ghost tracks were finished, and it was time for guitars, vocals, and drum overdubs, John simply wasn't around.  He would come in at the end to make any changes which were needed to the songs he wrote, but it was always on days when Brian and Roger weren't around.  The Works album, with producer Reinhold Mack, was the last album they were contractually obliged to deliver for EMI, and they basically worked on it without John, who recorded the majority of I Want to Break Free in his home studio.  They even managed to argue about that, because John found out Brian had dubbed a guitar solo onto it and John wanted the whole track to be electronic instruments only.  Even the drum track is a Roland (or possibly Linn) Drum Machine.  The compromise on the guitar solo was that Brian would play it on a MIDI guitar controller — hence that whacky 'dow dow dow dow daaaaaw' sound.  After The Works tour ended, they essentially split Queen up without making a press announcement.  Then Live Aid happened, and they went from being huge to being one of the biggest profit making groups in the whole music industry.  By the time Kinda Magic and the Magic tour were done, John had been trying to leave Queen for nearly 10 years — but they just wouldn't stop becoming a bigger and bigger band.  So at the end of the last gig of the Magic tour John snapped the neck of his bass guitar against his amplifier stack, climbed into his limo, and vanished.  For five years.  If it hadn't have been for Freddie becoming sick The Miracle and Innuendo would have never happened.  Freddie basically took John, Brian and Roger to one side and said, 'we're going to work together until I can't work anymore, and you're going to get on with one another come hell or high water' and they had no choice but to agree, for the sake of their friend.  That's why we don't see hide nor hair of John these days.  As of the Freddie Mercury tribute concert he effectively surrendered his voting share in the production company, and only retains the rights to the songs he wrote.  He makes next to nothing from the We Will Rock You stage musical, and as far as anyone knows he hasn't even been to see it.  He wasn't asked to join the Paul Rogers group, and isn't involved in the Freddie biopic movie, which was originally supposed to be made with Sacha Baron Cohen, at all.  He simply wasn't asked.  I could have talked to this guy all night, because he really has been there, seen it, and bought the T-Shirt.  His story about the time he hitched a ride to New York aboard Elton John's private jet was one of the most incredible things I've ever heard.  Two words; Midgets and Vaseline.  I can't say any more in case anyone out there might be able to work out who he is, but I just thought you guys would like to know what's really going on with John from someone who was actually there.  EDIT: I've just checked and Fred Mandel performed the synth solo on I Want to Break Free by layering over the solo Brian originally recorded, because the MIDI guitar controller Brian wanted to use had a timing issue."

queen,23hwo2,geekstone,1 point,Sun Apr 20 11:48:03 2014 UTC,"I am pretty uncultured, and didn't know he could sing until that. I was blown away. ""Holy shit, that dude can SING."""

queen,23e0e3,RJB6,2,Sat Apr 19 10:44:42 2014 UTC,It's a shame that the crowd was so boring
queen,23e0e3,BlueShoeLover,3,Sat Apr 19 00:55:49 2014 UTC,"I wonder if it's that whole ""Canadian politeness"" quality, just taken too far. Nobody wanted to be the first one to sing along, so nobody did!"
queen,23e0e3,MartynTheSpartyn,3,Sat Apr 19 04:43:00 2014 UTC,I think it was a more that they just toured South America where the crowds are insanely awesome and the pressure of their shows being filmed rather than the crowds being boring. They were pretty normal crowds.

queen,23brsu,Huskar,1 point,Fri Apr 18 23:51:17 2014 UTC,"Not sure why he decided to lead with ""We Will Rock You""- that's not a Taylor song and the slow/live version never really worked even when Freddie/Brian did it."

queen,22ec5u,MusicWithoutWords,4,Mon Apr 7 03:37:04 2014 UTC,"They were talking about good company or seaside rendezvous.  The start of Brighton Rock is a BBC pre-recorded track called carrousel or something... it is shared somewhere.  EDIT:   During A Day At The Races's into and at the very end of the second side, there's a climb with several parts going at once. Is that all guitar?  You've been really listening! Yeah, that's all guitar. I'll tell you exactly what that is: It was supposed to be the musical equivalent of that ridiculous staircase going around four side of a square, and it seems to always be going upwards. It's an Escher painting. It's supposed to be the equivalent of that because every part is going up, and each part fades into an octave below. It's also backwards, because I played it all descending. You're probably the only person in the world who's ever noticed it.

queen,222mwj,slothzy,3,Thu Apr 3 03:13:38 2014 UTC,Wow that lead singer reminds me a lot of Freddie in terms of showmanship and vocal range.  But musically I'd say they're quite different.
queen,222mwj,Garde,4,Thu Apr 3 08:57:07 2014 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. Other than the glam posturing, and range.. I'm not getting the Freddie comparisons. I get the Queen comparisons on some songs, though, because they use some of the same multi-tracking effects and whatnot."
queen,222mwj,AnInsolentCog,2,Thu Apr 3 14:50:39 2014 UTC,"Right - it's not that I don't understand the proposition, but I wish people would stop conflating ""Freddie"" with ""Queen."" Every time a vocalist approximates Freddie's voice, timbre, inflection, etc., the band as a whole is compared to Queen, and I feel like this conflation just expresses a profound ignorance of what made Queen the band that it was."
queen,222mwj,two,2,Fri Apr 4 02:37:24 2014 UTC,"Exactly.  From what I've heard of Foxy Shazam, their sound is great, but their songwriting is pretty plain.  In this song and others, for example, they use the four chord progression in the chorus, which Queen only used once (I think.)"
queen,222mwj,Garde,1 point,Fri Apr 4 03:11:52 2014 UTC,"Yes definitely, but the overall presence is very similar."
queen,222mwj,MartynTheSpartyn,3,Thu Apr 3 10:29:39 2014 UTC,"I mentioned this in a different thread -  Eric Sean Nally has said in interviews that he never drew much inspiration from Mercury, and that any similarities are probably because that he and Freddie both drew inspirations from the same things, such as theatre.    Just throwing it out there. Nally is an amazing frontman. If you have a chance to see one of their shows GO SEE THEM. Their first album, which is nothing like anything Queen did, is one of my favorite albums ever. I really wish they would have stuck with that style. But I still like their live shows."
queen,222mwj,Louisxxii,1 point,Sat Apr 5 23:49:04 2014 UTC,"Do you happen to have links to those interviews? I was under the impression that Foxy Shazam as a whole was greatly influenced by Queen, but that maybe more the other members and not so much Nally himself. Personally I don't see any comparisons between Eric and Freddie other than the bombastic showmanship and over the top theatrics, but even those are expressed in an entirely different manner."
queen,222mwj,AnInsolentCog,2,Mon Apr 7 04:33:27 2014 UTC,"Their newest album is free on Bandcamp, if you want to check it out.  I'm not a fan of them.. too retro-glam.. Kind of like The Darkness was.. not that I'm saying they stink or anything - they are undoubtedly talented, and I'm willing to bet their live shows are a ball of fun! The music (modern day retro-glam like stuff) just ain't my cup of tea."
queen,222mwj,snakers,3,Thu Apr 3 14:54:21 2014 UTC,"I agree. The guy comes off as trying too hard and being weird for the sake of being weird.   Freddie on the other hand, was just being Freddie. He was absolutely genuine and that's why he was able to enjoy such success and staying power (no pun intended)."
queen,222mwj,carl_with_a_k,2,Thu Apr 3 22:25:52 2014 UTC,I've met Eric Nally and I really just think it's his personality. Nothing was not genuine.

If anyone has the chance to see the ANATO documentary pay attention to when Brian isolates the guitar tracks. He used the multi-track guitars to make an entire jazz band.   I have so much respect for it. He made some insane sounds with his guitar. It really amazes me. Good Company is a great example of how much of a genius he was.

queen,21fbyb,JoeDawson8,1 point,Mon Mar 31 15:57:21 2014 UTC,They do a pretty decent cover of Radio GaGa.
queen,21fbyb,StupidTVBeMoreFunny,9,Wed Mar 26 21:12:51 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, Muse for sure. I think you hit the nail on the head with ""Madness."" But also the stomp-stomp-clamp of ""Survival"" and, of course, ""United States of Eurasia,"" which even contains the line ""there can be only one."" There's plenty of other examples too. I think that Muse definitely borrows from/pays homage to Queen very much, which I don't think is a bad thing. They are one of my favorite bands around today and are excellent in concert as well."

Just throwing that out there. There are definitely some similarities, though. It's cool to see Foxy Shazam mentioned. Nally is an amazing front man. I REALLY love their first album, such a unique sound."
queen,21fbyb,stevie_stormborn,2,Mon Mar 31 18:09:14 2014 UTC,"That's cool to know. But, any band that has operatic/theatre sounds AND a song about big butts must be lying about their Queen influence. :)"

queen,219icb,crypto_84,1 point,Sun Apr 27 07:14:49 2014 UTC,"Can someone please explain to me why Queen is teaming up with Adam Lambert? First of all, I hadn't heard of the guy until this tour thing came around, and when checking out his music on YouTube he seems just like a bland, boring pop artist with too much autotune and too little talent. How did it come to this?"
queen,219icb,jhs172,4,Tue Mar 25 08:43:50 2014 UTC,"I don't know who's videos you were watching but Lambert doesn't need autotune, he's actually one of the highest rated rock vocalists in the world. If you want to know how it came to this, Brian May and Roger were sent a video of him performing Bo Rap in his audition by one of their musician friends.  They asked to meet him and performed with him in the finale, not before Slash of Velvet Revolver, Guns 'n Roses, etc., saw him and asked the producers if he could meet him too.  The producers said yes, only if he would come on the show as a mentor for a night, so he did. (He later ended up doing guitars on a of his first album's songs.)  Meatloaf was also enamored with him as were several other rock musicians. Adam didn't want to sing rock at the time, he wanted to be a pop star.  I don't like pop music, never have,and I always hoped he'd sing more rock.  When Queen asked him to sing with them in Kiev, Moscow, Poland and the sell-out shows in London, it turned into something really fantastic and they could see the audience's reaction to his voice, and crazy range.  It's the first time they've been able to work with someone, other than Freddie, that can actually hit the notes in all of their songs and sustain their voice through such a taxing setlist. I hope that helps.  Be sure to look up their performances together in Kiev and London if you get a chance.  There were no good fan videos that I know of from Moscow or Poland. As you can tell, I'm a big fan.  I was also a big fan of Freddie Mercury's and Queen.  Adam has the range and flamboyance, but he doesn't try to be Freddie, and he certainly doesn't want to be.  I believe he still just wants to be a pop star, but with Queen, their shows have been something spectacular."
queen,219icb,AnInsolentCog,2,Tue Mar 25 12:12:22 2014 UTC,"unrelated...   Bo Rap   The fact that you can type this big ol' block of text, but can't be bothered to spell out 'Bohemian Rhapsody' cracked me up to no end."
queen,219icb,jhs172,2,Tue Mar 25 17:19:44 2014 UTC,"Alright, if this was /r/changemyview, I would give you +1Δ.  The songs I listened to by him on YouTube were this and this. They may not be autotune, but I stand by my opinion that they're poppy crap. But I'll take you on your word about his talent, and look forward to seeing the tour (probably online or DVD, they never seem to come as far north as Norway)."

Unfortunately I don't think we'll ever get a finished version - the lyrics are very much in their ""experimental"" phase, so I'm not sure if any of Freddie's recorded vocals are usable. I think Brian and Roger could whip up a decent finished instrumental anyway, but it wouldn't really be the same without Freddie's vocals."

queen,20qeo3,Arbennig,5,Wed Mar 19 00:03:48 2014 UTC,"I'd recommend Sheer Heart Attack/A Night at the Opera/Day at the Races/News of the World and Jazz. Most consider this their ""classic phase"", and they were able to have huge hits but still experiment quite a bit. The first two albums show a band gelling and the Eighties albums were pretty pop and polished. But on the albums I mentioned I think you'll find an incredibly creative band that was very diverse and at the top of their game."

queen,20qeo3,TheInsaneDane,6,Wed Mar 19 00:42:54 2014 UTC,"If you like the multivocal, multilayered wall of sound tracks with distinct style changes, like Bohemian Rhapsody, consider March of the Black Queen, Millionaire Waltz, and Innuendo. There's a very nice symphonic style ending to Was It All Worth It, as well. Late career pieces like We're All God's People and Breakthru showcase their classic ""choir of four"" sound.  Ballads with prominent piano parts over lyrics include Just You and I, Seven Seas of Rhye, Song For Lennon (Life Is Real), Jealousy, Love of My Life, and In Only Seven Days. For more retrospective pieces, try Sail Away Sweet Sister, All Dead, Spread Your Wings, and My Melancholy Blues.  Glass breakers with insane vocals include In the Lap of the Gods, My Fairy King, and '39 (which also holds the unusual distinction of being a song about the effects of time dilation upon the crew members of an interstellar journey).  More solid rock style songs, in the model of One Vision, include Scandal, Modern Times Rock and Roll, Dead On Time, Ride the Wild Wind, and arguably their closest offering to death thrash cannibal wingnut shotgun homicide metal, Stone Cold Crazy.  They do have a load of one-off tracks that touch on a genre or another: Who Needs You for a Latin-style guitar ballad (with adequate cowbell), Cool Cat for R&B, Bring Back That Leroy Brown for a bit of ragtime Dixieland, Teo Torriate for Japanese love song, Las Palabras de Amor for Spanish love song, and Mustapha for Arabic rock.  These Are The Days Of Our Lives is a farewell song from Freddie, featuring mellow introspective guitar riffs and a gentle drum section from Roger. It's also the last camera appearance of Freddie, who says goodbye to his fans with ""I still love you"", thus fulfilling the promise he made in ""Love of My Life""."

queen,2025vd,slothzy,3,Mon Mar 10 17:02:26 2014 UTC,"I'm a little late to the party, but I have two tickets to see them in Vancouver BC. As a grown man, should I be this excited?"
queen,2025vd,kevin-13,2,Wed Mar 19 17:59:19 2014 UTC,Yes- it's an exciting time!
queen,2025vd,ToniJabroni,2,Thu Mar 20 15:55:05 2014 UTC,"Congrats, I've been trying for good tickets to Madison Square using the fan presale all morning.  They went fast.  I'm going to try again for the general sale."
queen,2025vd,gyropyro,1 point,Mon Mar 10 17:15:53 2014 UTC,I got a pretty good seat... But I looked on stubhub and there are tons of massively inflated tickets on there already. Scalpers make me really sad and I hope someone figures out something to prevent that so people can get tickets to concerts. :(
queen,2025vd,hook_echo,2,Mon Mar 10 17:48:54 2014 UTC,Me too! I'm in Section 101 just right across from where you are.
queen,2025vd,aweshucks,2,Mon Mar 10 18:46:43 2014 UTC,I thought tickets went on sale on friday?
queen,2025vd,gyropyro,2,Mon Mar 10 19:20:32 2014 UTC,"This was the fan pre-sale.  Tickets were gone on first click for me, then they released some nosebleeds after about two hours."
queen,2025vd,aweshucks,1 point,Mon Mar 10 19:38:22 2014 UTC,"Oh, ok. Thanks!"
queen,2025vd,TheDerpyDonut,2,Mon Mar 10 19:39:20 2014 UTC,Does queen still make songs? Who does the vocals?
queen,2025vd,AlexHeyNa,2,Tue Mar 11 12:17:04 2014 UTC,They don't make new ones. The vocalist is Adam Lambert. But I'm going mainly to see roger and Brian. :)
queen,2025vd,ToniJabroni,2,Tue Mar 11 19:24:39 2014 UTC,"When Queen + Paul Rodgers toured NA in 2006, they had a new song called Take Love. I thought it was really good. Hopefully this tour will show at least one original. And with Adam Lambert as the vocalist, they have a lot more freedom to write the way they used to with Freddie."
queen,2025vd,Batwaffel,2,Wed Mar 12 21:12:30 2014 UTC,"I'm in for Chicago, section 3!!!  Can't wait!"
queen,2025vd,Batwaffel,1 point,Wed Mar 12 16:34:01 2014 UTC,They aren't coming to Pittsburgh this time around. Looks like I'm gonna miss it. :(
queen,200la1,slothzy,1 point,Mon Mar 10 02:36:10 2014 UTC,Thank you!!!!! Got a great seat! :) gonna be the best birthday ever.
queen,200la1,kiwimark,1 point,Mon Mar 10 16:23:18 2014 UTC,I may be wrong. But I don't think they will sell out very quickly.
queen,200la1,gyropyro,1 point,Mon Mar 10 17:00:11 2014 UTC,I want good seats. :(
queen,200la1,twistnroll,1 point,Mon Mar 10 05:26:02 2014 UTC,"For the pre-sale this morning, they were all gone in the first minute for MSG.  A few hours later they released some nose-bleeds but I'm going to hold out for something better."
queen,200la1,drowse,1 point,Mon Mar 10 16:05:43 2014 UTC,"Also, Jacky got really upset because some people shared the link and code on Facebook... I'm with u/kiwimark, Chicago shouldn't sell out too quickly. Just be ready when the tickets are on sale!"

queen,1ztmj0,lie4karma,6,Fri Mar 7 17:28:39 2014 UTC,And I'm going because I saw them in London and it was pretty fucking awesome.

queen,1ztmj0,mcdrunkin,3,Fri Mar 7 18:43:13 2014 UTC,Pre-sale tickets go on sale in the morning.  I expect them to go fast.
queen,1ztmj0,Nasalrelief,9,Sun Mar 9 14:18:26 2014 UTC,I'm not going because Adam Lambert really isn't a good replacement for Freddie
queen,1ztmj0,dantefl13,3,Fri Mar 7 21:11:51 2014 UTC,"I would agree with that, but not going because he is gay was pretty funny."
queen,1ztmj0,dreamerkid001,1 point,Fri Mar 7 21:22:40 2014 UTC,I will not be attending a Queen concert either.  Mostly because I would burst into tears when they took the stage and Freddie wasn't up there.

queen,1zq5mi,ferncorre,13,Thu Mar 6 15:55:00 2014 UTC,"Holy shit this is awesome. Being born after Freddie's death obviously made it impossible to see Queen live and now this may be my one and only chance to do so, and Adam Lambert will be with them? I don't know what other Queen fans think of the combination but I have nothing against it. I can't wait :)"
queen,1zq5mi,SMKM,12,Thu Mar 6 16:08:53 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'd rather have Adam Lambert than Paul Rogers, so I'm totally ok with this :)"
queen,1zq5mi,snakers,8,Thu Mar 6 16:11:19 2014 UTC,"I agree. I passed on the Paul Rodgers, but I'd see Adam Lambert, even though I've never been too enamoured with his past Queen covers."
queen,1zq5mi,two,1 point,Thu Mar 6 18:59:48 2014 UTC,"Really? I loved the chemistry between Brian and Roger and Paul Rodgers. I think I would have more reason to doubt someone who is not a rock musician and who has not proved himself in that role.  Being a great rock vocalist is different from being a great vocalist singing rock music. You have to learn to be a part of a well-oiled machine, whose sum is greater than its parts, rather than just a brilliant singer and a brilliant entertainer.  Great rock musicians, like Queen and Paul Rodgers, know this - which is why it is common for great rock bands to fragment and recombine with much success, and why it is less common for great solo vocalists to move on to fronting their own bands with any measure of success.  Queen wasn't great just because Freddie was a great singer, Brian was a great guitarist, Roger was a great drummer, and John was a great bassist. Queen was great because their individual talents thrived off each other.  I'm not saying that Queen + Paul Rodgers was the cat's meow, or that Queen + Adam Lambert will be anything but that. However, I am saying there are many factors other than whether we like or dislike the singer. I know it's not like they will be writing music, but this is relevant even when it comes to performing music."
queen,1zq5mi,beardlessdick,6,Fri Mar 7 01:27:16 2014 UTC,"Adam Lambert's hits might not be rock songs, but if you saw him on American Idol you would know why he'd be a great fit. Back then he was singing and performing classic rock and was amazing. I remember hearing tons of people saying his great it would be for him to tour with Queen."
queen,1zq5mi,two,-2,Fri Mar 7 12:53:48 2014 UTC,"I think you missed the thrust of my comment. I did not say he could not sing rock songs, or even that he has not proved himself to be a wonderful singer of rock songs, or even a wonderful singer of Queen songs in particular.  My point is, rock music is not about being good at singing rock music or playing rock music on rock music instrumentation. Rather, it is about the chemistry you have with the rest of the band. Those who have played in rock bands, such as Paul Rodgers, have that knowledge and experience. Those who have not developed success in a rock band, such as Adam Lambert, are untested. That doesn't mean he couldn't just come in and do an excellent job anyway; it just means we don't know what he can do yet - as opposed to Paul Rodgers, who demonstrated a sound understanding of band dynamics in his work with Brian and Roger, which was to be expected.  Singing in a rock band is not like singing karaoke, where vocal skills, or even performance skills, are all that matters. It's 90% synergy, 10% talent."
queen,1zq5mi,ToniJabroni,2,Fri Mar 7 22:59:15 2014 UTC,"Those who have not developed success in a rock band, such as Adam Lambert, are untested. That doesn't mean he couldn't just come in and do an excellent job anyway; it just means we don't know what he can do yet   I've seen him with Queen several times now- and he is most certainly not untested. Check out the Hammersmith gigs from 2012."
queen,1zq5mi,slothzy,6,Tue Mar 18 16:33:59 2014 UTC,How much do you think tickets will be?? I'm terrified they'll sell out.
queen,1zq5mi,gyropyro,2,Thu Mar 6 16:31:24 2014 UTC,"I saw one listing for $50 in Las Vegas and $90 to $120 in Ct.  I live in NYC so  it's going to be an arm and a leg I imagine.  It might be worth it to fly to Vegas, hang out and see the show."
queen,1zq5mi,gyropyro,3,Thu Mar 6 16:43:21 2014 UTC,The range for the Garden show is between $59.30-$171.75.  That's including all of the exorbitant fees ticketmaster charges.
queen,1zq5mi,geekstone,3,Thu Mar 6 16:51:58 2014 UTC,That's not bad at all.
queen,1zq5mi,slothzy,2,Thu Mar 6 17:06:44 2014 UTC,I am really happy in Houston tickets are at most $125. I think the pricing is extremely reasonable.
queen,1zq5mi,slothzy,2,Fri Mar 7 10:27:16 2014 UTC,That would be amazing. I totally think I'll be able to afford that.
queen,1zq5mi,slothzy,2,Thu Mar 6 16:52:58 2014 UTC,"Also, where are you seeing prices? I'm curious about the Chicago date."
queen,1zq5mi,slothzy,1 point,Thu Mar 6 16:53:42 2014 UTC,"If you click on ""more info"" for that date it takes you to the page where you would select the tickets.  Right under all the venue and date details, there should be a link that says ""price range"""

queen,1zfbym,Batwaffel,2,Tue Mar 4 00:43:36 2014 UTC,Same. So much.  I was too young when he was alive to have gone to a Queen show (and they never came anywhere remotely close to me anyway). I'm so glad for the internet sometimes. We can still experience him in some way at least.
queen,1zfbym,BarfFly,3,Tue Mar 4 10:48:42 2014 UTC,Great version. But this might be my favorite live version. Hmm Bowie & Lennox vs Mercury and no Bowie...

queen,1yuzi0,FOR_SPLENDA,3,Tue Feb 25 03:41:59 2014 UTC,"I own it. It could have been a decent game, but it came out far too late for its graphics and there were control issues. It plays a bit like a third person walkabout game with a few combat elements.  There are fun derivative plot and character elements from Queen songs, which I've plundered ruthlessly for my RPG campaigns though."
queen,1yuzi0,dusmeyedin,2,Tue Feb 25 21:50:18 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think the graphics were that poor. Sure, they weren't top of the line, but not bad either. The most frustrating thing about the entire game was that disc 6 was damaged somewhere, so I couldn't finish the game :X   They should remake The eYe with Unreal Engine or the Far Cry 3 engine. That would be epic."

queen,1ygr0y,iHipster,1 point,Thu Feb 20 20:09:55 2014 UTC,Its a trailer for Queen song DLC they made for the game. Its nicely done.
queen,1yftml,Kastain,6,Thu Feb 20 13:40:49 2014 UTC,This picture bests represents how I feel now that John doesn't perform with Brian and Roger anymore.
queen,1yftml,MercurialNerd,4,Thu Feb 20 13:56:42 2014 UTC,"I'd love to hear John play again, but part of me really respects him for not getting involved with Brian and Roger's later work - like the tour with Paul Rodgers (which was great btw) and the We Will Rock You stage show (which I've not seen).   I'm sure he's still getting some nice royalty cheques though..."
queen,1yftml,MercurialNerd,3,Thu Feb 20 14:28:51 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, I am sure John is quite comfortable. It would just be nice to get the three to perform together again. I have also gone on record as saying that it's actually a shame they couldn't work something out with George Michaels  The guy stole the show at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in '92, in my opinion, and would have made for a great lead vocalist for the band if they decided to tour once every three or four years or something like that."
queen,1yftml,PhoneJazz,2,Thu Feb 20 14:31:52 2014 UTC,"Have you heard any of the concerts they did with Paul Rodgers? He was pretty damn good in my opinion - the fact that he didn't try to ""do a Freddie"" and sang the songs in his own bluesy style was a big plus. And getting to Brian's guitar playing songs like Alright Now and Can't Get Enough Of Your Love was pretty cool.   I think poor old George has missed his opportunity..."
queen,1yftml,AnInsolentCog,3,Thu Feb 20 14:40:47 2014 UTC,"The ship has definitely sailed for George. No question about it. It just would have been cool to do throughout the 90's, probably. Something short term.  I have heard the Rodgers stuff. I like it and agree with your assessment on it as well. It would be cool to watch Queen turn out a new album every so often with a famous vocalist from different bands. Like, for instance, in the 90s they probably could have done a few with George, then Paul Rodgers and even the guy from the Darkness might have been fun to listen to with Queen as well.  Who is the woman that Brian works with now? Of course I cannot remember her name. But, I do enjoy her singing as well and think a proper Queen album with her as lead would have been cool to see."
queen,1yftml,MercurialNerd,4,Thu Feb 20 14:43:58 2014 UTC,"Kerry Ellis...they are doing ""candlelight concerts"" together across the UK this month. What I wouldn't give for a plane ticket over..."
queen,1yftml,AnInsolentCog,3,Thu Feb 20 19:26:39 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Kerry Ellis. She's fantastic. Imagine Brian, Roger and John working with her and doing a proper Queen album? Yes please."
queen,1yftml,MercurialNerd,1 point,Thu Feb 20 19:27:37 2014 UTC,The woman who works with Brian these days is Kerry Ellis I think.
queen,1yftml,AnInsolentCog,2,Sat Feb 22 01:26:48 2014 UTC,"I did appreciate that Paul didn't try to 'Do A Freddie', but i wasn't a fan of his interpretations of the old Queen songs at all. They just grated my nerves something fierce."
queen,1yftml,MercurialNerd,2,Thu Feb 20 19:13:26 2014 UTC,"Have to admit that I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Like I said I enjoyed his bluesy voice, the Queen sound playing songs by Free and Bad Company. I even liked that mellow version of a Hammer to Fall.   He did forget the lyrics to Radio GaGa though!"
queen,1yftml,Mick_Wyld,2,Thu Feb 20 20:10:04 2014 UTC,"|the Queen sound playing songs by Free and Bad Company.  Now, that, I did enjoy, from what little I heard.. I just didn't like his style when it came to singing Queen songs, is all.   I didn't really enjoy The Cosmos Rocks, much, either. :("

queen,1ycl4k,Mick_Wyld,5,Wed Feb 19 15:43:21 2014 UTC,"I love all of the albums Queen have made with Freddie, and I'm more of a fan of the earlier prog-like / glam 'phase' of their stuff.  That said, 'The Game' is the only one of their albums that, for me, is perfect, from beginning to end. There is not one single 'bum' track, or moment, on that album to my ears."
queen,1ycl4k,AnInsolentCog,2,Wed Feb 19 16:05:21 2014 UTC,"Another One Bites the Dust is always the track I blast loud to test out a new sound system.  The album is mixed almost perfectly.. NOTW & ANATO come close by, but AOBTD is the song I always go to."

queen,1xycfd,small_town_nebraska,4,Sat Feb 15 03:00:25 2014 UTC,Brendon Small (Dethklok) has mentioned the Brain May was a huge inspiration to him as a guitar player. His use of 3+ part harmonies is the most obvious example of this. This song specifically has a huge Brian May feel to it.

queen,1xycfd,jakdak,4,Sat Feb 15 05:00:01 2014 UTC,"For me, I haven't heard any songs that show off that influence better than ""Welcome to the Black Parade"" by My Chemical Romance.  (Bear with me here for a second.)  From the slow piano intro to the climatic guitar solo to the over the top ending, it feels every bit like the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" of punk music.  Granted, I don't have a lot of great things to say about the genre itself, but the whole over-the-top aspect of the song never fails to make me think of Freddie, Brian, Roger, and John."
queen,1xycfd,roofkelly,3,Sat Feb 15 03:05:11 2014 UTC,Influence doesn't always show in sounding similar. Queen is absolutely one of my favorite bands but I can draw lines in very few of the things I do.  Also I agree and love The Black Parade.

Went to the Queen Chritmass party in Shepards Bush, London, think that was 2000. And the Queen and Paul Rodgers , about 10 years ago ...   Highlight we're Under Presure and '39.   Glad to hear young Queen fans still emerging ! Im 38 now. I only got into them I'm 1989. Discovering their back catalogue back then was amazing! Have you heard all their albums?"
queen,1xvbyy,Arbennig,1 point,Fri Feb 14 16:53:31 2014 UTC,"I tend to think that I was born in the wrong generation. I am a young Queen fan as well and in interest of preserving the experience, I decided to pace myself by not listening to an album until I heard it first on vinyl. Though I have a wonderful record store near me, they rarely have Queen (at least ones that I don't already have- The Game for instance is rather common) and therefore I still haven't listened to A Kind of Magic, Made in Heaven or The Works in their entirety. I've still heard the popular ones because I bought Greatest Hits I,II,III before I started this policy. Hopefully, this way I won't burn through their music too fast."
queen,1xvbyy,Madtheswine,1 point,Fri Feb 14 18:46:31 2014 UTC,"I think thats a really good idea. If I had a bit more cash id buy a turntable and start buying the albums over again on vinyl, especially the 70's ones. Id say the best complete album to get is Made In Heaven. Might not be from their ""classic"" era, but all round better value for money, as it were. If youve not heard any songs from these albums, heres the one I think are the best : Princess Of The Universe, Machines, Made in Heaven. Oh, and the full versions of One Vision and Hammer To Fall. Enjoy! And Id also hugely recommend Queen: Live and Montreal on Blu Ray."
queen,1xvbyy,Arbennig,2,Fri Feb 14 19:07:55 2014 UTC,Hammer to Fall is one of my absolute favorite songs :) and I have Mr. Bad Guy on vinyl so I have that version of Made in Heaven. Princes of the Universe and One Vision were also on Greatest Hits.  I have Queen Hungarian Rhapsody video and its pretty great too!
queen,1xvbyy,Madtheswine,2,Fri Feb 14 21:37:59 2014 UTC,Mine too. Hammer to Fall live at Wembley one of Queen's finest moments for me. Enjoy discovering all the other Queen songs.

queen,1xvbyy,Arbennig,3,Fri Feb 14 22:28:33 2014 UTC,"I am 16 and I felt much the same way. When One Night of Queen came to town, I went and it was amazing. Though, naturally, it was not perfect, it was so close to the sound of Queen that I was swept up in the experience. Unfortunately, i saw it in a small theater and I feel like Queen should be experienced in a large arena with throngs of people but, alas, it shall never happen. I highly recommend them though, it was great. As was WWRY, albeit in a different atmosphere."

And the Prophet's Song was always a favourite of mine, but not sure if that would've been a commercial success.  And they should've released some live tracks from the Magic Tour as singles around the time Live Magic came out."

Not a fan of Rain Must Fall, huh? I can respect that. My buddy who is also an enormous Queen fan feels the same. It's not that he doesn't like the song, he's just kind of indifferent toward it. Regardless, I definitely respect your opinion and thanks again for researching Need Your Loving Tonight. Cheers."
queen,1xt5fp,MercurialNerd,2,Thu Feb 13 16:32:20 2014 UTC,"No worries, my pleasure.   That's the beauty of music - different people like different songs/artists/genres. Hell, there's Queen songs I loved a couple of years ago, which I'd skip over now, and ones I'd skip previously, but would listen to now."
queen,1xt5fp,jakdak,3,Thu Feb 13 16:42:44 2014 UTC,"Same here!   It's mostly, in my case anyways, because of media like radio or what not. Meaning, some Queen songs have just been played over and over and over again that they have been beaten to hell for me so occasionally I have to take a break from certain songs. It's how I discovered how epically awesome Queen II is. I ran into the obscurity of some of their other stuff (which over here in the States is quite easy) and developed a new appreciation for their earlier work that I hadn't had before."
queen,1xt5fp,Arbennig,2,Thu Feb 13 16:47:04 2014 UTC,"Totally agree on the media influence.   We Are the Champions gets played to death, so I find it difficult to listen to at times.   Queen II is fantastic. I believe Kurt Cobain listed that as one of his all time favourite albums - can't find the source though.  I've a real soft spot for A Kind of Magic since it was around 86 that I really got into Queen. Generally though, I find myself listening to their live recordings these days."
queen,1xt5fp,MercurialNerd,2,Thu Feb 13 16:55:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah their live stuff is incredible. Live Killers is a great album, in my opinion.  I find myself listening to Queen II, Jazz and Innuendo a lot. Sometimes a little Sheer Heart Attack and, yes, Hot Space too sometimes haha.  But yeah ""We Are the Champions"" is played to death. I feel the same about ""Another One Bites the Dust""."
queen,1xt5fp,Arbennig,2,Thu Feb 13 16:58:12 2014 UTC,"Live Killers is great, that was the first live album I got a copy of - ah, cassettes...  Hot Space ain't as bad as some people make out. The live versions of some of those songs on Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl are pretty rockin.   Check out some of the Queen Bootlegs - they were available as official downloads from their website a few years back, with money going to charity, but I'm sure you can find them on more nefarious websites..."

queen,1xt5fp,MercurialNerd,6,Fri Feb 14 10:58:14 2014 UTC,"Let Me Live would be an insane hit, I think. Not sure how it would've done back then, being a little different from their usual sound. But if it had been released as a single, nowadays it would be a classic. But I kinda like that my favorite Queen song doesn't have mass appeal. Makes it more special."
queen,1xt5fp,SarcasticVoyage,2,Thu Feb 13 21:05:09 2014 UTC,"This was a single, it peaked at #9 on the UK chart.  I remember hearing it in the rotation on the AOR format stations back when it was out"
queen,1xt5fp,snakers,1 point,Thu Feb 13 21:23:23 2014 UTC,"In the US though? If I asked 500 Americans if they've ever heard the song, I'd be lucky if I got one yes."
queen,1xt5fp,two,1 point,Thu Feb 13 21:45:15 2014 UTC,"Yes, I distinctly remember hearing it on AOR radio in the US- Specifically KDKB in Phoenix and WDVE in Pittsburgh.  Queen had the same problem as all of the classic rock bands in the 90s- noone was listening to AOR anymore.  If Queen released BoRhap today- what stations would it play on?   It would be buried and forgotten in a few weeks.  That song was released into the death throes of classic rock, after ""alternative"" had taken over, and before the internet/downloads became a thing."

queen,1vygbw,elderpo23,1 point,Thu Jan 23 17:45:06 2014 UTC,"This is really impressive. In summer I went to church to listen to a some kind of similar thing with an organist which name i forgot. He played ""The Show Must Go On"" very beautifully and the priest also talked about Freddie Merury. If I remember correctly, I think the sermon was about dealing with one's own diseases and own fade and death. I think that was the first time I actually wanted to go to church. I wish more services were like that."
queen,1vvbhs,Ayrgente,9,Wed Jan 22 18:34:39 2014 UTC,"Definitely yes. But why reducing this to a mere best song contest? Can't we break it down in some Oscar-like thing with categories and such? For example, we could vote for the best mainstream song, the best obscure song, the best non sung by Freddie song, the song with the best lyrics, the most overrated song, the best silly song, the most unexplainable song, the song that would have turned out so much better if only, that one song that hits so close to home you somehow manage to skip it every time you put on the album, the best live song and whatever other best song comes to our mind.  The profit in all this is that instead of discussing only a bunch of songs, we could end up discussing pretty much the entire catalogue, and this would result in the ultimate Queen bonanza"
queen,1vvbhs,Kit_Emmuorto,4,Thu Jan 23 00:19:41 2014 UTC,Great. Idea. I'll think about the best way to have a oscar turnament!  I'll be back soon to you guys on that!
queen,1vvbhs,ozzraven,2,Thu Jan 23 07:45:33 2014 UTC,That sounds great. We should agree in a number of categories first and then take the most voted ones to make the poll. I say 20 is more than enough.
queen,1vvbhs,Scoun,3,Thu Jan 23 19:17:35 2014 UTC,"Sounds great. Don't leave r/Radiohead out, though! We're just finishing one now and it was intense. Very interesting to see how it will turn out for this subreddit."

queen,1vvbhs,G581,2,Wed Jan 22 22:41:34 2014 UTC,You should find someway to determine the seeding order before making the bracket; that way potential winners won't square off in the early rounds.
queen,1vvbhs,jakdak,0,Thu Jan 23 01:15:25 2014 UTC,Or we could just save time and declare Bohemian Rhapsody the winner
queen,1vup0i,ozzraven,4,Wed Jan 22 14:36:53 2014 UTC,I wish John Deacon gave more interviews and would play some more shows with Roger and Brian.
queen,1vup0i,AnInsolentCog,8,Wed Jan 22 14:38:32 2014 UTC,"I'm with you regarding interviews, but as to performing, I kind of disagree.   I think John did the classy thing by walking away from Queen when he did. I honestly haven't enjoyed any of the bands output without Freddie (save for the tribute concert and the songs they did with George Michael).   I know a number of folks here enjoy any and all output from Brian and Rodger, but for me, Queen without any of the members, particularly Freddie, isn't Queen."
queen,1vup0i,snakers,3,Wed Jan 22 15:35:51 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that John was on board for collaborations in the early and mid-90's (e.g., queen ""ballet"" concert, ""Only the good die young"", etc).  Had queen re-formed at that time --with George Michael or anyone else--I  think he would have been interested. As time worse on, he obviously re-assessed matters, and perhaps wisely so.   Would you want your name on the Cosmos Rocks?"
queen,1vup0i,AnInsolentCog,2,Thu Jan 23 02:02:50 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely agree with you. Personally, I felt as though Queen (Roger, Brian and John) should have only done something with George Michael. The dude can sing and he writes catchy songs. I think, anyways.  But yeah, I can respect your opinion for sure. From what I have seen in interviews with Brian and Roger,when John is brought up, it's almost as if John is off still grieving, still depressed but just on his own. I don't know how accurate my perception of it is but that's why I say that it's too bad he doesn't do more with the two of them.  Plus! I really had hoped he would have at least performed with them when they were inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. If I recall correctly, he didn't."
queen,1vup0i,drowse,1 point,Wed Jan 22 16:27:53 2014 UTC,"Personally, I felt as though Queen (Roger, Brian and John) should have only done something with George Michael. The dude can sing and he writes catchy songs. I think, anyways.   I totally agree! I'm not a big fan of his stuff, but his version of 'Somebody To Love' was dead on, without being an 'impersonation'. I actually think he'd have been able to take over vocal duties for Queen, and not be silly or awful (Paul Rodgers - Great with Bad Company, terrible with Queen, IMO). Too late to do so now, I think.  I think John just had the good sense to bow out at the proper time. I'm sure he had his grieving period, but now I think (and hope) he's just enjoying his family and home life, after decades of rockstar work, and the loss of his friend and 'co-worker'.   Queen are to me what the Beatles are to my parents generation. If Paul and Ringo started touring and recording as the Beatles again, it wouldn't matter of the music was good, or not. It's still not really the 'Beatles'. I have the same opinion regarding the present day version of Queen."
queen,1vup0i,Mick_Wyld,2,Wed Jan 22 16:57:29 2014 UTC,"If anyone was wondering.. I saw this recently.. Roy Thomas Baker is currently in the studio working with Yes as they record their latest album.  He worked with Yes very briefly in the 70s after working with Queen, but nothing ever came of the album they did together.  Looks like a new one will be coming now.."

queen,1vv0ct,AnInsolentCog,11,Wed Jan 22 16:46:40 2014 UTC,Back Chat and Dancer for me. It took me a while to come around to it but Hot Space is an underrated album in lots of ways.
queen,1vv0ct,AnInsolentCog,5,Wed Jan 22 16:47:42 2014 UTC,"I learned to love Dancer, and it is one of my favorite songs, but Back Chat always makes my teeth grind."
queen,1vv0ct,AnInsolentCog,2,Wed Jan 22 19:48:32 2014 UTC,"The second half of Back Chat is much better than the first half, I think. But I can understand and certainly respect where you're coming from."
queen,1vv0ct,AnInsolentCog,3,Wed Jan 22 19:50:17 2014 UTC,"I'll.. have to give is another listen.. I never get very far before I 'Rage Skip' the track.  Some background.. My first 3 Queen albums were 'The Game', 'Flash Gordon' and 'Live Killers'. This last one nailed it for me as a fan, since it blew my mind that all these songs I remember hearing on the radio as a kid that I loved, and forgot all about, were from this band! I started spending my allowance, buying every album I could, building my collection.. this was the first band I ever obsessed over.   Then, 'Hot Space' was released! It had 'Under Pressure' on it, but that was the only song I knew.. I was so excited when I got it, and ran home to give it a listen..   .. well, you can imagine my disappointment... I cursed the hell out of 'Another one bites the dust' for become so popular and driving the direction of this album for years (the reasoning I had in my wee head for this weird dance band record that my favorite ROCK band made). It took me a very, very long time to listen to it again.. and I found that I did actually like a few of the tracks on it.. But Back Chat... and about half the tracks on that disc still get skipped.."
queen,1vv0ct,AnInsolentCog,3,Wed Jan 22 20:08:05 2014 UTC,Link to Back Chat for you...Just in case.

The solo(s) ARE pretty killer, but they are surrounded by the rest of the song..   But, hey.. I appreciate that you appreciate it, and appreciate that you went the extra mile to try and get me on your side of it. Sorry it didn't work, but still.. Queen Fans Forever and all that!!! :D  Also..

queen,1vv0ct,TheSpecialTed,2,Wed Jan 22 20:41:52 2014 UTC,hahah yep! Same here.
queen,1vv0ct,doxnrox,3,Wed Jan 22 20:42:51 2014 UTC,"I never get very far before I 'Rage Skip' the track.   Haha fair enough. I like the part from Brian's guitar solo to the end of the song. I think had they tweaked the first half of the song to be more like the second half, maybe it would have been met with more...enjoyment...by most other folks.  Queen was my first obsession too. I loved ""Crazy Little Called Love"" and, when I was little, also loved ""Another One Bites the Dust"", ""We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and, like yourself, when I finally put 2 and 2 together I couldn't believe it was all from the same band.  I can absolutely understand the dislike of Hot Space. Is it their best album? That's a laugh. But, I do think that songs like Dancer, Back Chat, Cool Cat, Staying Power and Under Pressure make the album respectable. There are some songs that I cannot stand, still to this day, on that album. Body Language, Calling All Girls, and Action This Day chief among them.  But yeah give Back Chat just one more listen. See what you think. At least listen to Brian's sweet, but short, guitar solo and up to the conclusion. You might enjoy it.  This is going to sound awful but I actually think News of the World is my least favorite Queen album. Yes, it has ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We are the Champions"" (and to a lesser extent 'Spread Your Wings', I think, is on there too) but outside of that? Meh.  But you can tell me if you think that's just me being crazy. There is ALWAYS a chance of that haha."
queen,1vv0ct,BumsArePooey,2,Wed Jan 22 20:14:32 2014 UTC,"Nope! Not crazy at all. Out of all the 'Classic' 70's albums, I think News of the World is my least favorite as well. Although, I do like pretty much all of 'side one' of that one.. it loses me after that a bit (Although, 'Get Down Make Love' I do like on Live Killers)"
queen,1vv0ct,ozzraven,2,Wed Jan 22 20:30:34 2014 UTC,Totally agree! On Live Killers it's fantastic.

And it made me laugh in spite of myself, partly because I wasn't expecting it and mostly because it's just so silly, which obviously is the point of it. So now I am able to appreciate it.  Conversely, I loved Ogre Battle the first time I heard it and now I can't really stand it."

Queen were the standout at the time, so it isn't just history that has made it seem that way. I'm a big fan of the Beatles so seeign McCartney for the first time was a huge deal (even with the mic cutting out). Geldof's stint and Elvis Costello's take on All You Need Is Love also stand out in my memory. And yes, there was a screen with the US show running. Funnily enough, my clearest memory of that day is lighting up a joint as The Who started up, only to realise a policeman was standing behind me. He just smiled at me and walked off. ;)"

queen,1vcwjt,og_penson,4,Thu Jan 16 13:26:11 2014 UTC,"It looks like Mountain Studios, and noticing the guitars and the telecaster I guess they are recording or rehearsing  Crazy Little Thing Called Love"
queen,1vcwjt,og_penson,1 point,Thu Jan 16 14:02:39 2014 UTC,Wasn't The Game recorded in Munich?
queen,1vcwjt,MartynTheSpartyn,4,Thu Jan 16 15:47:51 2014 UTC,"You're absolutely right.  Musicland Studios, Munich.  That would explain the angle of the picture since the studio was in a basement I think."
queen,1vcwjt,calon_lan,3,Thu Jan 16 15:51:43 2014 UTC,"it's definitely not Musicland, the room is way too big (just watch the One Vision video) and the angle wouldn't have been possible as the studio was indeed in the basement of the Arabella-Hochhaus  I also don't think it's the big room of Mountain Studios, the floor doesn't match, it seems to be concrete, more like some kind of big multi-purpose hall  and it's definitely not a recording session since there's a mixing-console right next to them and big monitor speakers between Roger & Brian and next to the piano (which is Freddie's touring piano)"
queen,1vcwjt,PorkHunt,2,Thu Jan 16 16:45:43 2014 UTC,"I first saw this photo on queenzone a long long time ago. I'm sure someone posted the information on this photo on the thread somewhere, If someone could find whatever post on queenzone I would bet the information isn't too far away."
queen,1v6p8g,MetallicNinja,8,Tue Jan 14 12:05:48 2014 UTC,"The variety of the sounds, genres and feelings in their songs. No Queen songs are similar to one another and yet they all are very recognizably Queen's. Freddie's voice, basslines, guitar licks and drum sounds, they all are very unique and very well thought out."
queen,1v6p8g,lagitech,2,Tue Jan 14 14:44:51 2014 UTC,"Because even their least popular album (Hot Space) is one that I enjoy - for the most part anyways. Plus, in my opinion, no one is, was or ever will be as great at performing than Freddie Mercury.  I just hope they don't drop the ball with the movie about his life that is slated to be released (hopefully) soon. I still maintain they should have stuck with Sacha Baron Cohen but I digress."
queen,1v6p8g,FoTMonly,3,Tue Jan 14 13:41:48 2014 UTC,"I love the 3 part harmony of roger, freddie, and brian. I love the sound of may's red special and how he layers the sound of his guitar in some of their songs. It's the only band where I can listen to all their albums and like 80% of them. I also think its really cool how all of them are such great song writers. They have a ton of unique sounding songs yet you can always tell its Queen."
queen,1v6p8g,Rebiff,3,Tue Jan 14 20:04:07 2014 UTC,"Queen has their own uniqe sound, and that sound is the best ever. It covers many genres and it is well-balanced with the right amount of everything. The lyrics are meaningful (except 'Mustapha'), the vocals are great, the basslines, guitar solos and drums as well. To put it short, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a great example of what I mean together with 'Innuendo', 'Spread Your Wings', 'Radio Ga Ga' and 'No One But You'. That is why they are amazing."
queen,1v6p8g,Madtheswine,2,Tue Jan 14 22:09:24 2014 UTC,Variety and skills.
queen,1v6p8g,Kit_Emmuorto,2,Tue Jan 14 15:29:27 2014 UTC,"I love Queen because of their sound, skill, personality and overall image. It is undeniable (which I think is safe to say in this subreddit) that they're one of the greatest bands, sound-wise, largely contributed to by their individual skill. Even if they were a mediocre band, I would still love their individual personalities. They may have acted like big stars (and rightfully so) but they also kept fans in mind and were relatable. For me, it is especially Brian May who gets me. I think it's amazing that he built his own guitar, became a rock star and still managed to finish his doctorate in astrophysics (which is what I want to do). Besides all that, Queen are simply a glamorous, fantastic, iconic band!"
queen,1v6p8g,G581,2,Tue Jan 14 22:51:20 2014 UTC,"Because they were what made me fall in love in music at eight years old. Seriously: aside from my parents, those four guys are possibly the ones who affected my life the most"
queen,1v6p8g,metman726,2,Thu Jan 23 00:29:24 2014 UTC,"I like them for their melodies and harmonies, which make me think of a million different colors.  Almost all my favorite music has that ""colorful"" quality but it's really difficult to find; so much music is a) colorful but insincere (most pop music) or b) sincere but has only one or two colors."
queen,1v6p8g,native-flute,3,Tue Jan 28 03:58:21 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of reasons:  *They're all talented musicians, even though it might not always shine through on every track like some other artists (which drives me crazy; Taylor is clearly a great drummer, why reduce him to basic, crappy beats on 2/3 of the songs?, same for Deacy.)  But then again, there's a lot of bands that could flat out rock.  None of them quite had the range of Queen though.  They experiment with so many different music styles, and it didn't always go well, but they could passably pull it off.  *I absolutely love the irreverence and meaninglessness of the lyrics.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when bands try to be deep and have lyrics that take themselves to seriously.  You don't get that feeling with Queen, because they didn't take themselves seriously.  Even a song like ""One Vision"" which is probably about as close as they came to a blowhard-ey message, they ended with the ""Fried Chicken!"" line which to me is a reminder that even though the song talks about this grandiose ideal, it's just a song, not something that is some inspirational mumbo jumbo (I hate the song ""Imagine"" for this reason).  Another good example of this is ""Don't Try Suicide"" - a song that has a seemingly heavy title, yet is light and whimsical.  They didn't try to change the world with their music, they just wanted to entertain.  They knew exactly what they were and were damn good at it."

It's usually regarded as one of the best, as it should be.   Just thought I would add since it wasn't on here :-)  Anyone who is interested, on queenzone there is a best of the best pittrek remasters torrent. Pittrek is a user who puts a lot of things together and he has remastered all the good quality/performance bootlegs and there is one torrent with them all. About 32 gigs though. Just an easy thing to do if you don't want to bother trying to find the best versions of the essential shows."

queen,1szsn2,metman726,7,Mon Dec 16 07:38:16 2013 UTC,"I'm going to answer your question a little differently. I'm going to highlight specific moments in specific songs that I think best highlight the essence of each member.  Freddie: ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" (1986) - ""And we can have forever..."" Such raw power. Yet refined. This is Freddie at his best.  Brian: ""Save Me"" (1980) - The emotional content of this guitar solo is unparalleled by anything before or since. George Harrison's guitar (or should I say Eric Clapton's) may gently weep, but Brian May's guitar wails.  John: ""I'm Going Slightly Mad"" (1991) - Just this silly little thing at the end of the song. I think somehow it really characterizes John's personality better than words can describe.  Roger: ""Keep Yourself Alive"" (1973) - Just the first of many of Roger's rolling drum solos that have become one of Queen's hallmarks. You never even recognize that you are listening to a drum solo.  And for some more traditional answers:  Brian: ""Good Company"" (1975) - One of Brian's more ambitious works. This time not because of the emotional energy he is able to wrest from the instrument, but rather for the intricacy of recreating a Dixieland-style jazz band with his guitar.  John: ""The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke"" (1974) - Classic John. 'Nuff said. (Since you have all mentioned ""The Millionaire Waltz"" - if you've somehow missed the bass line to this song, you're in for a treat.)"
queen,1szsn2,two,2,Tue Dec 17 01:10:47 2013 UTC,"I disagree with his best (obviously everything is subjective, and WWTLF is incredible). I think his most amazing moment was when he sang the extremely high falsettos in ""The Show Must Go On."" There was such power in his voice, and he reached notes he never had before. It's pretty chilling (as is WWTLF)."
queen,1szsn2,Only_Sleeping,2,Tue Dec 17 16:18:13 2013 UTC,"Small thing: those aren't falsettos, those are full voice."
queen,1szsn2,WheresTheSauce,4,Tue Dec 24 01:43:37 2013 UTC,"For Freddie, I really can't go past Somebody to Love. In an attempt to pick a song not already mentioned... and there are so many possibilities... but I always love to listen to Under Pressure for Freddie's soaring vocals.  The Prophet's Song for Brian. Not so much the guitar playing, but it's just an impressive song in general to me and really demonstrates Brian's skills as a versatile songwriter.  John. Millionaire Waltz also for the bass... but again to be different, Dragon Attack. Yeah, maybe the rhythm in a sense is pretty basic, but John's playing contributes to my feeling of wanting to dance whenever I listen to that song.  Roger... nothing really stands out, though I genuinely do enjoy his contributions. I'm In Love With My Car, perhaps? It's a funny song to listen to, but is an oddball contribution that fits in perfectly on ANATO."
queen,1szsn2,MolvanianDentist,3,Mon Dec 16 09:44:20 2013 UTC,"Freddie: Innuendo, there's just something i can't explain here with his voice that really gets to me. He hits a really high note too.  Brian: This is a hard one, but i think i'll say Brighton Rock. Really shows his creativity and skill.  Roger: I'm In Love With My Car. Brilliant drumming, brilliant singing. Shows just what he's capable of.  John: A Kind Of Magic. Shows that John could also be the one being most noticed in a song. Brilliant bass play in this one."
queen,1szsn2,TheInsaneDane,4,Tue Dec 17 01:21:12 2013 UTC,"Brian: '39, as vocalist and guitarist. Live it was Freddie who sang, but on the album it's Brian. Plus how many space-folk music is there? The lyrics are poignant and intelligent.   Freddie: In the Lap of The Gods/In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited, the solwed down, almost demonic, yet at the same time heavenly, voice on In the Lap of the Gods, coupled with the ever-catchy ""la, la, la-la-la"" on ""Revisited"" make these among my favorites in terms of listening.   John: This is cheating, but the version of ""A Kind of Magic"" used in the film Highlander, to me, was more striking, on the bass side, than the album version.   Roger: Tenement Funster, singing, performance, lyrics. This song is Roger in a nutshell, and the drumming is in such perfect time."
queen,1szsn2,Xantayu,3,Tue Dec 17 10:31:06 2013 UTC,"For me, Freddie's voice is mind-blowing on Love Of My Life, both on his amazing lead and incredibly precise harmonies  Brian for his playing obviously is best on Brighton Rock, but for using the full range of the instrument, it's gotta be Procession or The Millionaire Waltz!  Roger is best for me in his Dragon Attack solo, that's it!  John I think is best on Dragon Attack, or possibly the Millionaire Waltz for me!"
queen,1szsn2,elderpo23,3,Mon Dec 16 16:19:09 2013 UTC,Brian: Dead On Time  Freddie: My Melancholy Blues  Roger: Death On Two Legs  John: Breakthru  All of them: Liar

queen,1szsn2,MartynTheSpartyn,3,Fri Dec 20 01:37:59 2013 UTC,"Freddie: Bohemian Rhapsody purely for writing the song, all those intricate vocal tracks and Another one bites the dust from the sheer power. Oh so many others too... The Prophets song for the canon... Its a hard life, that intro... Love of my life live of course... Breathru. TOO MANY!!          Brian: Brighton rock duh and Show must go on... Writing and the amazing solo. Maybe even The hitman is a good contender.                      John: Under pressure and A kinda magic awesome bass riff                 Roger: Stone cold crazy, Sheer heart attack. Nice and fast :D Hammer to fall purely because its so essential"

queen,1szsn2,Bior37,1 point,Mon Dec 16 19:31:11 2013 UTC,"I think each member of the band hit a high point in ""It's Late.""   Between the lyrical creativitity of telling a 3 act play, innovative finger tapping, and amazing riffing in general, Brian is in top form(even if the solos are a bit shrill and dissonant at times(which makes sense in a song about an affair)), and John's Bass line not only manages to keep up, but add to the song. Roger isn't outdone either, with rolling drum beats. And of course, the singing is vocally stunning.   It may not be the best of all of them, but I think it is one of the few songs they all hit high points together on."

At the time, this was my least favorite album by a longshot.  A year or so ago I got the itch to revisit the entire library again and it was like listening to Queen II for the first time. My opinion changed completely.  There are so many great tracks that sound so early and raw, and yet every track has a moment that is pure Queen. At the same time it's like proto-Queen. It is fresh and new and old and antique at the same time."
queen,1sfbsu,strongbob25,1 point,Mon Dec 9 03:38:51 2013 UTC,I felt the exact same way.  It's so brilliant.  I believe Brian has said it is his favorite album.
queen,1sfbsu,Bothan_Spy,4,Mon Dec 9 18:00:20 2013 UTC,My favourite album!
queen,1sfbsu,elderpo23,3,Mon Dec 9 08:18:22 2013 UTC,"My favourite Queen album. It's such a shame though that this doesn't get the same recognition as the brilliant 'A Night At The Opera', I think that  'The March of the Black Queen' is on par with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' if not superior."
queen,1sfbsu,TrolleyMan,3,Mon Dec 9 19:05:54 2013 UTC,I think the band have referred to it as the precursor to Bohemian Rhapsody in interviews. Lots of similarities!
queen,1saihn,zerocoke,7,Sat Dec 7 03:02:33 2013 UTC,"Awesome. I was known as ""The Queen Fan"" in high school, in the early nineties. Everyone made fun of me for liking that ""faggot."" One of their favorite things to say was, ""the fucking band is called Queen, they're all a bunch of fags."" I had to defend the band time and time again against utter ignorance. Joke's on them, now. The brilliance of Queen has been touted a billion times, Freddie has been voted greatest lead man on nearly every poll.   Anyway, kudos to your friend. I'm glad he came to his senses!  ETA: Terrible typos needed to be fixed and the writing sucked. I should never respond before I've had a cup of coffee."

queen,1saihn,just_did_it,2,Sat Dec 7 08:02:57 2013 UTC,"i'm two years older but i guess i got into queen at the same age, maybe that is when we as humans start to be able to recognize greatness?^  all jokes aside, i have similar memories about people making fun of them for freddy being gay, i'm not gay but at this age i can safely say that freddy is a human worthy of being an idol, he wasn't exactly a role modle in all aspects of life but teens can look up to him for beeing brave and just beeing proud of who you are, i'm not sure if he ever acutally said that he was gay but he never lied about it either and for that time it was as much as you could ask from a decent human beeing who lived in the brigtest spotlight you can imagine.  €: and just for those few people that still think gay is a lifestyle choice (who probably won't read this sub anyway ...), there is this crazy little thing called love..."

queen,1rztew,Louisxxii,0,Tue Dec 3 18:02:42 2013 UTC,"Hey now, you say that like it's a bad thing. Don't let the name fool you - true feminism is about equality for both men and women. It just carries that name because in history, women have typically been the ones more disadvantaged and thus have been the ones to fight for their rights. A feminist is anyone who thinks that the sexes should have equality, and as such I would like to think Freddie was a feminist.  Seriously, I hate how Reddit gets so defensive about the terminology."
queen,1rztew,Louisxxii,1 point,Tue Dec 3 20:03:19 2013 UTC,"I'm sure you didn't, but there is a prevailing misconception about the term and unfortunately a lot of people make it out to be something shameful. I meant no hard feelings, nor did I mean to project that insecurity onto you."
queen,1rztew,1337haxx,1 point,Tue Dec 3 20:10:03 2013 UTC,"I don't hate feminism, I just hate feminists. Mainly because they think that they are better than men because of the men's history therefore defeating the very definition of feminism. I have yet to have an intellegent converstation with a feminist without being bewittled."
queen,1rya62,zvezdan,4,Tue Dec 3 00:13:51 2013 UTC,"I hope by ""a film"" they mean they've finally cast the Freddie biopic, and not another documentary.  Still bummed about Sacha Baron Cohen no longer being involved, but.. ..fingers crossed.  On a technical note, I hope by ""remastering projects"" this doesn't mean we're going to get ""now with super exciting saturated reverb"" and ""squeezed to buggery in pro-tools"" multi-band compression versions of tracks that are already near-as-matters perfect.  I'm hoping, instead, it means we're going to hear stuff from the original multi-tracks which never made the final mix — like alternative vocal takes, guitar parts, and songs left out because they were too long, or too saturated.  Something we take for granted in the digital age is that not only can a digital download or CD album be as long as the artists likes, but it can be as dynamic as they'd like too.  But in the days of analogue, decisions had to be made about the play order of certain tracks, because the spinning disc is faster on the edge, and slower in the middle, where the plastic is also thicker.    This meant that, unless the mastering engineer was super careful (many weren't) tracks with lots of wow and flutter towards the end of side B would cause the needle to simply jump out of the groove on the listener's record player at home.  Indeed, those of us who go back a bit, remember having to tape coins to the head of the needle arm, so that records pressed on cheeper quality plastic didn't constantly skip because of this effect.    Many bands, particularly those with a penchant for blasting out a big power ballad, had to leave out some songs that had too much dynamic range to stop this from happening — even though in many cases there was nothing wrong with the material they had to leave off, apart from that it simply wouldn't fit on the L.P. — many only later seeing the light of day as 45 RPM B sides.  Fingers crossed there's some Day at the Races / Jazz era stuff along these very lines waiting to be heard, and that Brian and Roger will be overseeing this process personally."

Reddit is awful sometimes."
queen,1rd6sl,Louisxxii,0,Mon Nov 25 00:22:35 2013 UTC,"Exactly, Queen is popular so every time they're brought up its only because they have a lot of bandwagon fans and not because they're a legitimately good band."
queen,1rd6sl,redspecial95,1 point,Mon Nov 25 00:52:27 2013 UTC,"Hmm. It always interests me though that whenever Queen or Freddie are mentioned in one of the bigger or default subreddits, how many people profess their love for the band but can only offer up a Red Special anecdote or participate in a Bohemian Rhapsody singalong. Also, that the membership of this subreddit is so small despite everything. To be honest, Queen's popularity on Reddit I suspect is due to most people being familiar with only the Greatest Hits. 'Le karma' circlejerk is a different matter.  /snob"

March of the Black Queen doesn't contain any direct references to Rhye, but I always kind of assumed it was set there.

queen,1qdcyw,acoodle_doodle_doo,1 point,Mon Nov 11 11:40:07 2013 UTC,I had a really small laptop screen and I made this as a wallpaper for it. Looking at it now I don't think it looks as good as I remember it looking when I made it. But I figured I'd share anyways. Feel free to edit it if anyone wants to.
queen,1qdcyw,MySuperLove,1 point,Mon Nov 11 11:42:09 2013 UTC,Fantastic.  If you made a 1920x1200 version I would throw it into my wallpaper folder.

queen,1q6x9l,drowse,0,Fri Nov 8 20:06:04 2013 UTC,Freddie Mercury meme.  r/queen will accept.    Should we send something back in return?
