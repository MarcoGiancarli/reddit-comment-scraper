He concludes that ""Mr. Pawlikowski has made one of the finest European films (and one of most insightful films about Europe, past and present) in recent memory."" David Denby of The New Yorker has called Ida a ""compact masterpiece"", and he discusses the film's reticence concerning the history in which it is embedded: ""Between 1939 and 1945, Poland lost a fifth of its population, including three million Jews. In the two years after the war, Communists took over the government under the eyes of the Red Army and the Soviet secret police, the N.K.V.D.. Many Poles who were prominent in resisting the Nazis were accused of preposterous crimes; the independent-minded were shot or hanged. In the movie, none of this is stated, but all of it is built, so to speak, into the atmosphere ..."" Denby considered Ida to be ""by far the best movie of the year"". Peter Debruge was more reserved about the film's success, writing in Variety that ""...dialing things back as much as this film does risks losing the vast majority of viewers along the way, offering an intellectual exercise in lieu of an emotional experience to all but the most rarefied cineastes.""

His wife wants a divorce and expects her lover, Harry, a philandering State Department marshal, to leave his wife. A diskette falls out of a gym bag at a Georgetown fitness center.

The Times, which gave the movie four out of five stars, compared it to Coen films Raising Arizona and Fargo in its ""savagely comic taste for creative violence and a slightly mocking eye for detail."" The review said the attention to detail was so impeccable that ""the Coens can even raise a laugh with something as simple as a well-placed photograph of Vladimir Putin,"" and complimented Carter Burwell's musical score, which it described as ""the most paranoid piece of film music since Quincy Jones's neurotic soundtrack for The Anderson Tapes."" Andrew Pulver, film reviewer for The Guardian called the movie ""a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy that couldn't be in bigger contrast to the Coens' last film, the bloodsoaked, brooding No Country for Old Men."" Pulver, who also gave Burn After Reading four out of five stars, said it ""may also go down as arguably the Coens' happiest engagement with the demands of the Hollywood A-list."" Pulver said Brad Pitt had some of the funniest moments and that compared to the other Coen brothers movies, Burn After Reading most resembles Intolerable Cruelty. The Hollywood Reporter reviewer Kirk Honeycutt complimented the actors for making fun of their screen personae, and said the Coen brothers ""have taken some of cinema's top and most expensive actors and chucked them into Looney Tunes roles in a thriller."" Honeycutt also said ""it takes awhile to adjust to the rhythms and subversive humor of Burn because this is really an anti-spy thriller in which nothing is at stake, no one acts with intelligence and everything ends badly.""

And, of course, who but Coppola would want to?"" Gary Arnold in The Washington Post wrote, ""It's virtually impossible to be drawn into the characters' identities and conflicts at even an introductory, rudimentary level, and the rackety distraction of an obtrusive experimental score ... frequently makes it impossible to comprehend mere dialogue"".

Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an ""A"" grade, hailing the film as a ""procedural thriller for the information age"" that ""spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still."" Nathan Lee in his review for The Village Voice wrote, ""Yet it's his very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, that gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory of life in the information age, it blew my mind.""

Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there."" David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote, ""Zodiac is meticulously crafted – Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film – and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish.

And the 2nd World War begins in Moscow. Boris works in a factory and he hasn't got time to speak with Veronica. He has to go to the war ... (IMDb)   Critical reception:   As film scholar Josephine Woll observes, the protagonist Veronika was instrumental in shaping the post-Stalinist Soviet movies by heralding more complicated, multi-dimensional celluloid heroines. It was not only Soviet audiences that accepted and sympathized with Veronika‘s story. The lead actress of Cranes, the beautiful Tatiana Samoilova, who was frequently identified with her role, took Europe by storm. Following the film's victory at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958, where it earned the event‘s prestigious Grand Prize, the world celebrated the film‘s main protagonist. Woll notes that the French Liberation commentator, for example, approvingly contrasted Samoilova‘s purity and authenticity with that Western female icon, Brigitte Bardot. Samoilova even remembered receiving a watch from her East German fans during a festival there; the gift featured the inscription: ""Finally we see on the Soviet screen a face, not a mask.""

He has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. He is too rebellious. He is too wild. He is going to try ""just one more raid"" on the three nastiest, meanest farmers that are Boggis, Bunce and Bean. It is a tale of crossing the line of family responsibilities and midnight adventure and the friendships and awakenings of this country life that is inhabited by Fantastic Mr. Fox and his friends. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Fantastic Mr. Fox received positive reviews from a vast majority of critics. The film currently has a 92% ""Certified Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 224 reviews, with the site's consensus stating ""Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightfully funny feast for the eyes with multi-generational appeal – and it shows Wes Anderson has a knack for animation."" The film also became the second highest-rated animated film in 2009 on the site, behind Up. It has an average review score of 83 (""universal acclaim"") from review aggregator Metacritic, which includes positive reviews from publications such as Rolling Stone and The New York Times. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it ""Excellent."" A. O. Scott called Fantastic Mr. Fox ""in some ways (Wes Anderson's) most fully realized and satisfying film. Once you adjust to its stop-and-start rhythms and its scruffy looks, you can appreciate its wit, its beauty and the sly gravity of its emotional undercurrents. The work done by the animation director, Mark Gustafson, by the director of photography, Tristan Oliver, and by the production designer, Nelson Lowry, shows amazing ingenuity and skill, and the music (by Alexandre Desplat, with the usual shuffle of well-chosen pop tunes, famous and obscure) is both eccentric and just right."" According to Time, the film is ""both a delightful amusement and a distillation of the filmmaker's essential playfulness"" and was one of the ten best films of the year. Cosmo Landesman of The Sunday Times said ""having a quirky auteur like Anderson make a children’s film is a bit like David Byrne, of Talking Heads, recording an album of nursery rhymes produced by Brian Eno""; according to Landesman, ""in style and sensibility, this is really a Wes Anderson film, with little Dahl. It’s missing the darker elements that characterise Dahl’s books. There you find the whiff of something nasty: child abuse, violence, misogyny. Gone, too, is any sense of danger. Even the farmers, who are made to look a touch evil, don’t seem capable of it. We never feel the tension of watching the Fox family facing real peril. The film certainly has Americanized Dahl’s story, and I don’t mean the fact that the good animals have American accents and the baddies have British ones. It offers yet another celebration of difference and a lesson on the importance of being yourself. But it does leave you thinking: isn’t it time that children’s films put children first?"" Amy Biancolli from the Houston Chronicle states that ""Anderson injects such charm and wit, such personality and nostalgia — evident in the old-school animation, storybook settings and pitch-perfect use of Burl Ives — that it's easy to forgive his self-conscious touches."" Ann Hornaday from the Washington Post calls it a ""self-consciously quirky movie that manages to be twee and ultra-hip at the same time, it qualifies as yet another wry, carefully composed bibelot in the cabinet of curios that defines the Anderson oeuvre."" Peter Howell from the Toronto Star states that ""[i]n an age when everything seems digital, computer-driven and as fake as instant coffee, more and more artists (Spike Jonze and John Lasseter among them) are embracing the old ways of vinyl records, hand-drawn cartoons and painstaking stop-motion character movements."" In 2011, Richard Corliss of TIME Magazine named it one of ""The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films"".

It is an ultimate statement of the science fiction film, an awesome realization of the spatial future ... it is a milestone, a landmark for a spacemark, in the art of film.""

He later put it on his Top 10 list for Sight & Sound. Time provided at least seven different mini-reviews of the film in various issues in 1968, each one slightly more positive than the preceding one; in the final review dated December 27, 1968, the magazine called 2001 ""an epic film about the history and future of mankind, brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick.

Throughout the entire film Cuarón always has our characters travelling through or past events that are already taking place, giving the whole world a sort of energy and presence outside of just serving the plot and main characters. Most importantly, the audience can discern a lot of information from it as to the political climate and social unrest by adopting the voyeuristic and reactionary viewpoint that the camera often provides us. Look at the graffiti on the walls, look at the ads playing in the world, look at the signs and posters - that sort of secondhand, unconscious exposure is what helps us as the audience flesh out how this world works and feels."

On the way, Welles plays a few tricks of his own on the audience. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   F for Fake faced widespread popular rejection. Critical reaction ranged from praise to confusion and hostility, with many finding the work to be self-indulgent and/or incoherent. F for Fake has grown somewhat in stature over the years as cinephiles revere almost anything the notorious filmmaker made. In that the film embraces everything from self-conscious notation of the film process to ironic employment of 1950s-era B movie footage, Welles thought he was creating not so much a documentary as a ""new kind of film,"" as he once told writer Jonathan Rosenbaum.

Critics praised the three lead performances. Karisma Kapoor in particular was applauded for her performance as a disillusioned sister. Vinayak Chakravorty from Hindustan Times gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing, ""Fiza is more than just about Khalid Mohamed's foray into filmmaking. It is about Karisma Kapoor's proving a point as an actress of some substance. It is about Hrithik Roshan's establishing that he doesn't need maximum footage or glitz to impress. It is about the return after a hiatus of the ever-delightful Jaya Bachchan."" Mimmy Jain of The Indian Express, in a positive review, wrote, ""Fiza is the kind of movie that every critic prays will never come his way. For a critic's job, after all, is to criticise. And Fiza offers little scope for criticism."" She further noted Karisma for delivering ""a superbly flawless performance"". Sanjeev Bariana of The Tribune labelled the film ""only a little above average"", but was highly appreciative of the performances. Chaya Unnikrishnan of Screen praised the performances and concluded that Fiza ""does live upto the expectations"". Screen magazine's critic Chaya Unnikrishnan, while disappointed with the film's second half, described it as ""a mature film"" and commended the performances.

Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3/4 stars saying ""Submarine isn't an insipid teen sex comedy. It flaunts some stylistic devices, such as titles and sections and self-aware narration, but it doesn't try too hard to be desperately clever. It's a self-confident work for the first-time director, Richard Ayoade, whose purpose I think is to capture that delicate moment in some adolescent lives when idealism and trust lead to tentative experiments.

Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged by the life they've eked out together and by the experiences they've had leading into their marriage. Dean, a high school drop out, comes from a broken home, where he never really had a mother figure. He never saw himself getting married or having a family despite falling in love at first sight with Cindy. He doesn't have any professional ambition beyond his current work - which he enjoys since he feels he can knock off a beer at 8 o'clock in the morning without it affecting his work - although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an example of a harmonious married or family life.

But also time of day of the posting (less important on smaller subs like this) and likes perpetuating themselves after a certain point are also things. So relative to yours, this post may be more like 12 points or whatever. There's several factors, really.   Edit: in looking at your post, there are some great ones in there, but also some redundancies I think (the 3 orange shots outside the plane for example). If I had to scrutinize, I'd say narrow down your shot choices to isolated moments, and make sure they're strong lighting or composition or both that feel evocative of the movie as a whole (to use the plane one again, the shots lack the same isolating quality and/or vivid framing that this movie shows a lot)."

In a provincial town, which is surrounded with nothing else but frost. It is bitterly cold weather - without snow.

This strange state of affairs - the appearance of the foreigners, the extreme frost - disturbs the order of the small town. Aambitious personages of the story feel they can take advantage of this situation. The tension growing to the unbearable is brought to explosion by the figure of the Prince, who is pretending facelessness. Even his mere appearance is enough to break loose destructive emotions...

What they don't know is that the SOS warning is not like any other ordinary warning call. Picking up the signal, the crew realize that they are not alone on the spaceship when an alien stowaway is on the cargo ship. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Critical reaction to the film was initially mixed. Some critics who were not usually favorable towards science fiction, such as Barry Norman of the BBC's Film series, were positive about the film's merits. Others, however, were not: Reviews by Variety, Sight and Sound, Vincent Canby and Leonard Maltin were mixed or negative. (Maltin, however, reassessed the film upon the release of the Director's Cut and gave Alien a positive review.) A review by Time Out said the film was an ""empty bag of tricks whose production values and expensive trickery cannot disguise imaginative poverty"". In a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews discussing science fiction films of the 1950s and 1970s, critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were critical of Alien. Ebert called it ""basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship"" and one of several science fiction pictures that were ""real disappointments"" compared to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, though he did compliment the early scene of the Nostromo's crew exploring the alien planet as showing ""real imagination"". However, the film later made it onto Ebert's Great Movies list, giving it four stars and stating, ""Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original.""

Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged by the life they've eked out together and by the experiences they've had leading into their marriage. Dean, a high school drop out, comes from a broken home, where he never really had a mother figure. He never saw himself getting married or having a family despite falling in love at first sight with Cindy. He doesn't have any professional ambition beyond his current work - which he enjoys since he feels he can knock off a beer at 8 o'clock in the morning without it affecting his work - although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an example of a harmonious married or family life. One of her previous serious relationships was with Bobby Ontario, that relationship which has a profound affect on many aspects of her marriage to Dean. Dean and Cindy head off on an overnight getaway together without Frankie, the getaway which may provide a clearer picture if their marriage can survive its many issues.

In the shadow of her flight, capture, confession, and burning at the stake, the young wife of the town's aging pastor falls in love with the pastor's son. Her confession of this illicit affair to her husband brings on her husband's death. At the funeral the pastor's mother denounces the young widow as a witch. Will the widow's lover come to her defense, or has the day of wrath returned? (IMDb)   Critical reception:   The film premiered at the World Cinema in Copenhagen on November 13, 1943 and received poor reviews and was unsuccessful financially, with many Danes complaining about the film's slow pace. It later gained a better critical reputation after World War II. Many Danes saw a parallel between the witch burning and the persecution of Jews during the Nazi occupation, which had begun on August 29. Dreyer always denied the film as being analogous to persecution of Jews. However, on the advice of many of his friends he left Denmark on the pretext of selling Day of Wrath in foreign markets and spent the rest of the war in Sweden shortly after the film's release.

Shot in documentary style on 16mm film from the perspective of an almost alien observer, the film is an exploration of the ravaged oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait, decontextualised and characterised in such a way as to emphasise the terrain's cataclysmic strangeness. An effective companion to his earlier film Fata Morgana, Herzog again perceives the desert as a landscape with its own voice. (Wikipedia)   Critical reception:   The film won ""Grand Prix"" at the Melbourne International Film Festival. At the close of its screening at the Berlin Film Festival, the audience reacted furiously to the film, rising to castigate Herzog, with accusations that he had aestheticised the horror of the war. The director waved his hands fiercely and protested ""You're all wrong! You're all wrong!"", and later maintained Hieronymous Bosch and Goya had done likewise in their art. The Los Angeles Times‍ '​ end of year review for 1992 recognised the film as ""the year's most memorable documentary"", describing it as ""Herzog's apocalyptic, ultimately ironic view of the Gulf War"". Critic Janet Maslin remarked that the director ""uses his gift for eloquent abstraction to create sobering, obscenely beautiful images of a natural world that has run amok""; her colleague J. Hoberman called it ""the culmination of Mr. Herzog's romantic doomsday worldview"". Academic Rachel June Torbett hailed Lessons of Darkness as both ""extraordinarily beautiful"" and ""deeply ambiguous"", interpreting the decontextualisation of the geopolitical background as an avoidance which meant that the intent of the work lacked clarity.

I hated Edward scissorhands because it felt so cheesy with elfmans score and the crappy set design.   So, does ed wood just look better? Or is it better in other ways too?"
CineShots,39cjml,MrGCar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton's films but I think he really did a great job with this biopic. It is engaging and very interesting to watch, both visually and with its narrative. Do not, however, expect a strong story driving it though, since it is a biopic, but it is still fun to see how Ed Wood made his films with such a low budget. So bonus points if you are interested in film history :)"

Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge but, under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit and dignity in adverse circumstances. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese commandant Saito. He is an honorable but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy.
