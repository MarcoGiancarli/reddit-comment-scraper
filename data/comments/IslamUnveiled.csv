The UK is and has been the basis of so much of America, that the fact this is being tolerated is awful.   These people come to your nation, have kids that go to your schools, shop in your stores and then proceed to say that you are the problem. That your laws are wrong, even though they fled their dangerous country to gain asylum in yours. Just makes one wonder what the point in helping at all is.  America has it's own illegal and normal immigrant struggles, but at least ours don't want to blow us up because God told them to.  I really just don't understand Muslims. Don't want to think the worst, but having a hard time not thinking they are just horrible."
