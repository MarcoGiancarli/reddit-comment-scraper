Like this While it's intention isn't to prevent sinking, so much as just keeping oil in separate tanks, it probably is what kept it afloat because water wasn't able to get into the other sections so the ship still had buoyancy."

The attacking tank's second HESH round hit the open commander's hatch lid of the QRL tank sending hot fragments into the turret, killing two crew members. The strike caused a fire that eventually led to an explosion of the stowed ammunition, destroying the tank. It remains the only Challenger 2 to be destroyed on operations.   wiki  x/post /r/DestroyedTanks"
DestructionPorn,3dgtgm,fernguts,16,Thu Jul 16 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"It's rather impressive when the only thing that's been able to destroy a tank is another tank of the same type, and even then only because the hatch was open.

Considering the round struck the open hatch, and started a fire, I think I'd be feeling a bit less secure, because what's stopping someone from running up with a molotov cocktail for example, and just throwing it at, or, if the hatch is open, in the tank?"
DestructionPorn,3dgtgm,fernguts,8,Thu Jul 16 13:09:24 2015 UTC,"Tanks are designed with Molotov cocktails in mind, and have fire extinguisher systems to help deal with them.    Also, it's important to note that the two crewmembers who died were killed by fragments from the HESH round that had ricocheted off the hatch, and not the ensuing fire or explosion.  The other two crewmembers survived."
DestructionPorn,3dgtgm,Bigcats30,10,Thu Jul 16 13:41:40 2015 UTC,You have no idea....  The two who survived were asleep on the back decks of the tank and were blown off by the explosion.

The two inside (the tank was on overwatch) one being the driver (sat in the gunners seat) and the commander.....were killed instantly by the explosion cause by the HESH round landing through the commanders hatch and striking the bag charge bins inside the turret.........The driver was never found  The commander was blown from the turret and was found some distance from the vehicle.....he was headless  The explosion as you can see blew the turret off onto the back decks of the tank........it then burnt for days.

DestructionPorn,3d9w1f,BoomShankaram,19,Tue Jul 14 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"The bombing of Dresden, the capital of Saxony took place three months before the eventual surrender.  Over 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city were dropped. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed over 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) of the city centre. An estimated 25,000 people were killed.  There has been marked controversy behind the decision to bomb the city so late in the war. There exist reports that justify the bombings as being of strategic importance, and opinions that claim it was unnecessary.  Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death (1969) used some elements from his experiences as a prisoner of war at Dresden during the bombing Vonnegut recalled ""utter destruction"" and ""carnage unfathomable.""

DestructionPorn,3d4xql,BoomShankaram,12,Mon Jul 13 15:40:17 2015 UTC,"Berlin was bombed by the RAF Bomber Command between 1940 and 1945, and by the USAAF Eighth Air Force between 1943 and 1945, as part of the Allied campaign of strategic bombing of Germany. It was also attacked by aircraft of the Red Air Force, especially in 1945 as Soviet forces closed on the city. British bombers dropped 45,517 tons of bombs; the Americans dropped 23,000 tons. As the bombings continued more and more people moved out. By May 1945, 1.7 million people (40% of the population) had fled.  Up to the end of March 1945 there had been a total of 314 air raids on Berlin, with 85 of those coming in the last twelve months. Half of all houses were damaged and around a third uninhabitable, as much as 16 km² of the city was simply rubble. Estimates of the total number of dead in Berlin from air raids range from 20,000 to 50,000; current German studies suggest the lower figure is more likely. This compares to death tolls of between 22,000 and 25,000 in the single attack on Dresden on 14 February 1945, and the 40,000 killed at Hamburg in a single raid in 1943.  Ruins of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church preserved as a monument."

DestructionPorn,3d4xql,LacidOnex,6,Mon Jul 13 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"Take into account how old and sturdy the buildings were and how lousy our weapons/guidance was.  The drop weights were reported higher than actuality, as many bombs didn't actually detonate or simply landed beside one another minimizing area of effect.  Add in the fact that air raid sirens, shelters, and of course more rural areas to flee to were pretty much everywhere, and you can get a decent headstart before the bombs get to you. Back then. And of course, many many bombs hit the same locations over and over, damaging building that were emptied a few raids prior.  Notice how intact most of the facades are. Hiding under a sturdy table next to one of those windows, you would be relatively safe. Hiding in a pre-selected structurally sound ""safe zone"" I imagine families could wait out the bombings in relative peace. Except top floor residents."

DestructionPorn,3cabmg,dsclouse117,-11,Mon Jul 6 12:33:13 2015 UTC,So a pretty small to medium size fire... why is there so much hype over it?
DestructionPorn,3cabmg,dsclouse117,6,Mon Jul 6 16:13:20 2015 UTC,"Because it's not the only fire, and we havnt had a good rain in a long time. http://imgur.com/hP2UwGY  Also, last week, this fire was only about 1500 acres in size, so it's grown very fast and it's near a town."
DestructionPorn,3cabmg,EggnogMan,3,Mon Jul 6 19:39:13 2015 UTC,"That makes much more sense then, with the number of fires and it being near a town.

DestructionPorn,3cabmg,MenacingVitamin,3,Mon Jul 6 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"100k acre plus.   Over 35k or so is a good sized fire, over 100k is where it gets notable."

DestructionPorn,3bnd38,RyanSmith,47,Tue Jun 30 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"The Russians have proved now by their destruction of the great dam at Dniepropetrovsk that they mean truly to scorch the earth before Hitler even if it means the destruction of their most precious possessions ... Dnieprostroy was an object almost of worship to the Soviet people. Its destruction demonstrates a will to resist which surpasses anything we had imagined. I know what that dam meant to the Bolsheviks ... It was the largest, most spectacular, and most popular of all the immense projects of the First Five-Year Plan ... The Dnieper dam when it was built was the biggest on earth and so it occupied a place in the imagination and affection of the Soviet people difficult for us to realize ... Stalin's order to destroy it meant more to the Russians emotionally than it would mean to us for Roosevelt to order the destruction of the Panama Canal.   More info"
DestructionPorn,3bnd38,ColdWeatherKarl,20,Tue Jun 30 16:39:29 2015 UTC,The destruction of the dam claimed between 20.000 and 100.000 civilian lives.   For the motherland? What a cost.

I do need to read some more about that as it's interesting that they weren't able to notify the civilian population downstream when they blew it.  From a couple of articles, it sounds like they didn't even try which seems like an odd strategy.  I guess at that point, anything to slow the German advanced even if it meant sacrificing thousands of lives including Red Army officers that were crossing downstream at the time."

DestructionPorn,3bnd38,rowdiness,5,Wed Jul 1 04:45:27 2015 UTC,"It would've been of the same use to the Germans as it was to the Russians who built it.

This was called Lebensraum."
DestructionPorn,3bnd38,JetsandtheBombers,6,Wed Jul 1 09:53:05 2015 UTC,"Well there is the power generation aspect but it's not solely the dam which would be useful to the Germans, it's the stuff that would be affected by the floods which would be. It helps if you think of a dam as a huge flood with a wall holding it back.   Floods are usually very effective at destroying infrastructure which is handy to armies, namely roads, airports, buildings and bridges."

One alternate theory is that the secondary explosion was caused by the Falcon 9 first stage flying into/through the fuel spilled by the second stage failure and igniting it.  But that's not confirmed, just a theory I've seen tossed around.  When I posted this (about 30 minutes after the anomaly) I didn't want to specifically call it an explosion until that had been confirmed, and either way, disintegration seems to still be an apt description, though Rapid Unplanned Disassembly might have been more accurate."

DestructionPorn,3b8rch,davematts,15,Sat Jun 27 00:04:14 2015 UTC,"this actually exploded because water reached the boilers, causing it to turn into steam rapidly enough to cause this explosion- modern cruises use either electric motors& diesel or diesel alone to drive their ships."
DestructionPorn,3b8rch,xpkranger,14,Sat Jun 27 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"Probably a mix of that and an ammunition cook off, which cruise ships also don't have."
DestructionPorn,3b8rch,Maddjonesy,4,Sat Jun 27 02:57:10 2015 UTC,ammunition cook- offs generally don't explode suddenly at once though- watch any video of it happening and you'll know what i mean.
DestructionPorn,3b8rch,Sempais_nutrients,18,Sat Jun 27 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"This was not a boiler explosion. It was the powder magazines encountering fire as the ship heeled over, as confirmed by the Wikipedia article.  As big as that explosion was it was simply too big to be anything but HE.  You aren't dealing with bullets or tank shells here.  You're dealing giant bags of of HE that are used to propel the projectiles from the ships 4 twin 15"" gun emplacements. These are massive guns and require huge amounts of explosives.  Once the magazines encounter fire, many ships do not survive.  A similar incident happened to the USS Iowa in 1989 (at least the Iowa didn't have hostile torpedoes to deal with)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qalJ9koob2Q"

DestructionPorn,3b8rch,thisiscotty,5,Sat Jun 27 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"...no, it was a magazine explosion:   A Royal Navy Court of Enquiry into the sinking ascribed the final magazine explosion to the detonation en masse of 4-inch anti-aircraft ammunition stored in wing passages adjacent to the main magazines, which would have detonated the contents of the main magazines"

DestructionPorn,3b8rch,gtrcar5,5,Sat Jun 27 20:30:23 2015 UTC,That massive explosion is NOT a torpedo. It's the ship's magazines exploding. The u-boat that attacked the ship was probably escaping the scene at the time of the explosion.

The funny thing is that in terms of engineering, this was fantastically useless.... Because the containers are so heavy, they destroy the train instead of the other way round, and the actual force applied to the container was only equivalent to dropping it a few feet onto hard ground. It's a spectacular proof test though, which is what is really important since the projects don't need to just convince their engineers that the solutions are safe, but the non-technical public as well."

Multi vortex structures happen a lot with large tornadoes and tend to cause sporadic damage like this where one home will have a lot of damage and the one next to it will be lightly damaged.

DestructionPorn,35tmyl,Dannei,8,Wed May 13 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"In case anyone was wondering what's going on in this image:  The only real practical way (russian jet-tanks will be discussed later) to put out an oil fire like this is explosives. Its common knowledge that oil and fire don't mix, and spraying the foamy fire-retardant used at airports doesn't work because no pump system can overcome the pressure and volume of fuel coming out of the ground.   The strategy is then to use explosives. The boom crane arm will contain a large explosive charge that is placed next to the flame source. Upon detonation, the explosion will consume all of the oxygen in the immediate area. Without an oxygen supply, the oil fire won't be able to sustain combustion and go out. Then a team can cap a gushing oil rig, not a flaming oil rig.   An alternative was developed by the Russians during the Gulf War in 1993. When Saddam's retreating army lit every oil rig they found on fire, the explosives method was not fast enough. The Russians responded by strapping two MIG-21 jet engies onto a T34 Tank turret and using the afterburner to blow them out like candles."

DestructionPorn,3578gg,Gaggamaggot,7,Fri May 8 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"I believe you're referring to the construction of land-based structures. With large ships they use steel in the hull, and aluminum in the superstructure where the strength - and weight - of steel isn't needed. That's how they build those over-sized cruise ships, though I must confess I know less about ferry boats."
DestructionPorn,3578gg,vtjohnhurt,3,Fri May 8 02:28:44 2015 UTC,I did not realize that the super structure of ferries was aluminum.  Aluminum is much more expensive than steel.  Both will soften in a fire.  I'd expect that the insulation placed around aluminum structure would be thicker to account for the lower melting/yield point of the aluminum such that it would function identical to steel in a fire.

DestructionPorn,34a87c,GeorgeAmberson,7,Thu Apr 30 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"Stupid question, but aren't they being exposed to insane amounts of radiation here?"
DestructionPorn,34a87c,umichscoots,7,Wed Apr 29 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"Depending on what type of bomb, the levels of radioactive fallout varies incredibly. I may be totally off base, but I'm remembering that most of the tests in done in Op. Teapot were Plutonium nuclear devices with relatively low yields (ranging from 1 to 40ish kilotons, with usually around 20 kilotons) which wouldn't have produced as much radiation as something like the thermonuclear Operation Castle tests (which dealt in yields in the megatons, with Castle Bravo reaching fifteen megatons). Also remember that the biggest factor in who gets irradiated after a nuclear device goes off is the direction of the wind."
DestructionPorn,34a87c,thingscouldbeworse,9,Wed Apr 29 20:18:59 2015 UTC,I think Castle Bravo was particularly dirty due to the Uranium tamper leaving large amounts of radioactive material in the resulting fallout dust.  I think modern fusion devices make better use of the fissile material so they don't leave as much radioactive contamination behind after the initial detonation.
DestructionPorn,34a87c,thingscouldbeworse,6,Wed Apr 29 21:00:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's what I was talking about. Radiation has a lot of factors."
DestructionPorn,34a87c,ichooseuinternet,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:04:05 2015 UTC,"iirc the initial detonation blasts the area with gamma rays. In that instant, everyone receives an amount of EMR dependent on the type of bomb. Fallout distributes and further decomposes and gives off alpha and beta particles.   Fallout is worse as it can be absorbed into the body and continue to expose it the more damaging alpha and beta particles but just by being line of sight of the bomb they should have received some measurable amount of radiation."
DestructionPorn,34a87c,triggoz,4,Mon May 4 01:52:05 2015 UTC,Not as much as conventional wisdom would lead you to believe.  Here's the official report on radiation levels received by observers of Operation Teapot

The inverse only evaluates as false if they are not a creationist and they believe in God. However for the original argument, it is true that there are non creationists who believe in God.

DestructionPorn,338es2,Jazzspasm,17,Mon Apr 20 19:55:55 2015 UTC,Top comment said this was from a Saudi airstrike though.
DestructionPorn,338es2,fidelitypdx,5,Mon Apr 20 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe they knew that's where the scuds were stored, perhaps because it had been a military base. The jets came over so they began filming.   It's also possible there could have been a strike earlier but less spectacular, so when the second one came in they immediately started recording.  I dunno - I'm speculating wildly."
DestructionPorn,338es2,LumpenBourgeoise,2,Mon Apr 20 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"It's also entirely possible that the military put out leaflets warning people exactly when the strike would be or otherwise kept circling the base in order to evacuate as many people (especially civilians) as possible. If they dropped flyers an hour beforehand, it's very unlikely any force would be able to mobilize and start moving military resources out of the way.    Edit, based upon other videos I've found, it's pretty clear that military operations (bombing or something) were going on in the area before the large explosion."

JDAMs are basically a guidance package, including computer guts, servos and actuators, fins, and a seeking head of one kind or another. The computer ties in targeting information and flight data (GPS co-ordinates, projectile current position and flight coordinates), and makes the fins on a bomb move to adjust accordingly. The seeker head acquires and follows the target either based on data uploaded from the plane, or from its own guidance and targeting systems."

DestructionPorn,338es2,Jazzspasm,25,Mon Apr 20 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"The country of Yemen is named after the Yemen River. Actually the river is really an artificial underground aquaduct called a ""wadi,"" which have been used all over the Middle East and Northern Africa since ancient times to bring water to cities and towns for agriculture. The Yemen is one of the oldest wadis in the region, and is the basis for the civilization in the southern Arabian Peninsula. This ""river"" is one of the biggest points of contention between groups in Yemen, because ever since the 1980s fish have been introduced to sustain the southern part of the country (where Al Quada in the Arab Peninsula is) but thus the water is left too dirty to sustain date/palm/wheat production in the northern part of the country (where the capital and Houthi control is.)  If you look on older maps you'll see that Yemen was once separated into 2 countries; this border roughly follows the Yemen Wadi."

DestructionPorn,31zgxx,Bill_Butt_Licker,2,Thu Apr 9 19:44:00 2015 UTC,I used the WoT term but this is a bit of an arbitrary formula they use for a phenomenon where the projectile velocity and hardness makes the resistance offered by sloped armor of little consequence

It's like how people say ""this reinforced glass is 10x harder than concrete!"", and sure it is 10x harder than it, but it's still a completely separate material altogether and will behave differently, and different rounds (within the same category, HEAT or KE) will react differently depending on what they're composed of, right?  Do you see what I'm saying or am I just confusing myself at this point? lol"
DestructionPorn,31zgxx,SmokeyUnicycle,2,Fri Apr 10 22:08:39 2015 UTC,"and different rounds (within the same category, HEAT or KE) will react differently depending on what they're composed of, right?   Not to a significant extent really, no.   The differences in rounds are typically pretty small, there are optimum trends in terms of penetrator length, shape and material and in cone aperture size that are pretty constant, while they do differ they don't differ much in terms of how they impact the functioning mechanics of the munition.   There will obviously be some variance, but you're looking at a number that's not considered significant enough to bother recording in technical military publications."
DestructionPorn,31zgxx,Boonaki,5,Sat Apr 11 00:12:35 2015 UTC,"Source without much context, judging by the lack of through-and-through penetration suggests that they could possibly be steel training rounds as opposed to the more capable tungsten or DU alloy penetrators actually used in wartime.  x/post /r/DestroyedTanks"

When an APFSDS round is fired, the sabot ""petals"" peel off to allow the 10 lb Depleted Uranium dart they were supporting to scream downrange at a velocity of around 5,000 feet per second.  The sabot separation can be clearly seen in this slow motion video.  Being so streamlined and dense, the dart loses velocity very slowly and will happily penetrate over a foot of armored steel even as far as four kilometers away.  The three men occupying the turret were likely killed by the impact, which not only would have projected a large number of high velocity fragments at the point of impact, but with DU impacts against hard targets result in local temperatures as high as 1,800°C, which results in a phase change in uranium from solid to liquid. At these elevated temperatures, the uranium reacts readily with atmospheric oxygen with a dramatic incendiary effect."
DestructionPorn,31zgxx,SmokeyUnicycle,5,Thu Apr 9 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"There's talk that the T-90 was immune to the first APFSDS round, they then modified the round, the Russians modified the armor to protect against it, then the Americans modified the round again.  Quite entertaining."

The crew may survive but there is going to be significant damage to the surrounding areas that could result in a loss of combat ability.  We also have absolutely no idea how a conventional battle between the U.S. and Russia would play out. Both sides have toys that are quite classified that could tip the scale one way or another. I also wonder if tanks would actually be shooting at each other.

DestructionPorn,31zgxx,SoManyMinutes,3,Fri Jul 17 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"Considering many tanks today can accurately engage helicopters with their cannon, I don't think so."
DestructionPorn,31zgxx,kraftwrkr,3,Sat Jul 18 07:20:26 2015 UTC,"I would think it would be a lot harder to shoot a fast moving small truck that is probably not in line of sight behind buildings and terrain than it would be to shoot down a helicopter that, in comparison with a light truck, has fairly predictable movement.  Although a helicopter obviously can move in three dimensions, they are a lot more cumbersome than a small pickup.  In a tank you are just a sitting duck asking to be blown up."
DestructionPorn,31zgxx,caltheon,3,Thu Apr 9 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"Helicopters in combat situations don't fly high, they fly at very low altitudes as fast as they can, meaning anything engaging them has to do so in a very short amount of time, and often at a very high rate of traverse.   A pick up is vulnerable to a .50 cal."
DestructionPorn,31zgxx,OneSalientOversight,1 point,Fri Apr 10 07:11:31 2015 UTC,"well if a helicopter is flying low and fast, it's gonna fly low and fast in a pretty straight line and not behind any cover.  Regardless, I'm comparing a truck to a tank.  I would think against a modern tank I would much rather be in a fast moving light truck than in a slow moving tank.  Honestly I don't know where you get that a tank can shoot down a helicopter.  Modern day tanks may have very good aiming software, but I seriously doubt any are designed to shoot down a helicopter, and I doubt any can."

Apparently NOE flight is not known to you.    I would much rather be in a fast moving light truck than in a slow moving tank.   See there are these things called ""trees"" and ""terrain features"" and they cannot be seen through...    I would think against a modern tank I would much rather be in a fast moving light truck than in a slow moving tank.   That's fine. You're entitled to wanting to die horribly.   Math time, because I'm on lunch and bored:  A pick up truck moving at 60mph off road (which is not some mean feat) is moving 26 m/s  Let's say a pick up is five meters long, like the Honda ridgeline for example. It's moving five body lengths a second.   A modern APFDS round moves at  about 1000 m/s   This means at 500m against a target moving perpendicular at 60 mph you'd have to lead just two and a half truck lengths, half a second ahead.  (This is a perpendicular target, the hardest type to engage...)   This is an incredibly easy shot with an automatic weapon, and entirely doable with small arms.   The nice thing about a tank is you don't need to fear every joe shmoe with a PKM or an AK.   Enjoy dying.   Honestly I don't know where you get that a tank can shoot down a helicopter.   From my knowledge of the FCS of the modernized 3rd generation and 4th generation MBTs  as well as the kinematic performance  and doctrinal implementation of GLATGMs."

The flood (caused by a failed dam) hit a railroad bridge first, regathering momentum, and adding debris. It then hit the industry town of Woodvale, including an iron works and barbed wire factory, which got tangled up in the debris.  Then the churning mass of wire and wood hit Johnstown with a depth up to 60 feet. The wave then hit the Johnstown Stone Bridge, rebounded, and hit Johnstown again.  Then the debris field caught fire, killing many more people who had somehow survived.  Positive fact: this resulted in the Red Cross's very first major disaster relief effort!"

Driving/riding in a car is significantly more dangerous than quite rare mutli-family catastrophe.    The increase in miles driven by car (instead of flying) after 9/11 resulted in almost as many people died in the attacks.  Of course you get to decide which risks you take, but from a rational stand point the safest thing for you to do is sell your home and move into an apartment. Today."
DestructionPorn,30exry,GungorTheGreat,2,Fri Mar 27 01:55:03 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I should have reworded that last line as people are misinterpreting it. I'm not fearful of dying in a fire, I'm fearful of losing my home because of somebody else's actions. I choose to live in the suburbs where a house fire would be most likely my own fault."
DestructionPorn,30exry,lachryma,3,Fri Mar 27 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"There's a couple things wrong with your line of thinking. Overall, you have a preference for living in the country. Nobody faults you that, but for some reason you want to defend that preference with the implication that living in a city isn't safe and because it's your own preference, you overlook the already-given logical reasons that's false.  There are so few cases where a house fire would be your fault that I worry you're planning for the wrong case. I don't understand how a fire is more likely to be your fault simply because you live apart from other people. We can all buy fire extinguishers and quickly address a fire that we start, but the house fire that burns your home down is more likely to start while you're not there. Electrical, gas, swamp gas refracting the rays of the Sun...  You're also looking at ""somebody else's actions"" wrong. A plane could fall out of the sky on your home. A Chelyabinsk-sized meteorite can level it. The Invasion of the United States might start in your backyard and a main battle tank might drive through your house. Your home isn't a special exemption from the laws of probability merely because it is in the country. In fact, I'd feel safer about the natural gas system in New York City because it's New York City. If any gas line is going to explode, it's going to be the one underneath your home because your state cut funding to the municipality for five straight cycles and there's one guy in charge of the whole gas system now.  You are correct that density has advantages and disadvantages, but you just make yourself sound a bit luddite justifying your preference for the country with hand-wavy reasons about cities being less safe. Just own your preference, man. You want to live in the country, go for it, and don't fault those of us who prefer otherwise."

DestructionPorn,2zrag6,kstorm88,3,Sat Mar 21 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"It would have been better for them to hit a brick wall, because a semi doesn't stop when it hits a focus. So the car would have probably gone from 70 to -30 in the time it took to crumple the car."

DestructionPorn,2zrag6,frosty95,6,Sat Mar 21 04:50:35 2015 UTC,99% of cars have plastic bumpers nowadays.

DestructionPorn,2zoxba,3rdweal,36,Fri Mar 20 12:15:18 2015 UTC,The turret was left in situ and is now preserved as a memorial
DestructionPorn,2zoxba,OldMadGoat,8,Fri Mar 20 12:16:40 2015 UTC,I just don't even understand how a tank could explode with such force as to blow the turret high enough to then come crashing through someones roof.
DestructionPorn,2zoxba,OldMadGoat,28,Fri Mar 20 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Think of all the propellant stored within the tank - on the T-72 there is enough to fire 39 shells - going off at the same time, that's a lot of energy which is more than enough to throw several tons of turret into the air.    You can see it in this clip, impressive stuff.  The missile that hits the tank has a relatively small warhead, but it's the ignition of the ammunition within the tank that causes the large explosion."
DestructionPorn,2zoxba,braneworld,12,Fri Mar 20 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"it's also considered a flaw in the soviet tank design - they keep their propellant under the turret ring, sort of like a large donut. That way the auto-loader can rotate the propellant in the carousel to get it to the rear of the turret to load it into the breech. But this leaves the soviet tanks incredibly vulnerable to catastrophic explosions like the one you linked, where the chance anyone survives is 0.  Western main battle tank design is much much different - we keep our rounds stored segregated from the compartment - the loader has to open an armored door to access them to load them into the gun. That way, if the compartment is breached, there is much less chance of a catastrophic explosion, and if the ammo storage is penetrated, we have blast doors that protect the crew and redirect the explosion out the top of the tank. It will, of course, ruin the tank, but it gives the crew much better survival chances. It also makes the tanks bigger than the soviet designs.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay7bOG2nD6k"

Instead of a compact missile possibly missing the plane, the warhead explodes just before impact and then the plane gets hit by a cloud of small pieces of metal.

It probably wasn't tied down right because you're supposed to do enough hand brakes that it won't move when the air lets out.   Air bleeding off is a term for pressure in the air lines lowering and letting the brakes release (same thing happened in Lac-Megantic killing a bunch of people.

DestructionPorn,2yt83l,khaddy,7,Thu Mar 12 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"They do. The difference between a truck and a train is that each car is like a separate truck, connected by an air line.  The length of train means it takes time to build up air pressure. Each car is equipped with a reservoir to help return the system to operating pressure after application.   The brake pipe that runs the length of the train does two things: it supplies air to the cars to release their brakes when in run and release and when it's in application, lap (and emergency) it's controlling the speed at which the cars release their air pressure.   If you didn't do it this way, you'd have horrible problems with applying and releasing the brakes (because the air pressure would be unequal for a long time) and you'd end up snapping the train all the time.  At least this is what I gather. I'm not in the industry, trains are just an interest. Maybe somebody in the industry can correct me if i'm wrong."
DestructionPorn,2yt83l,khaddy,4,Thu Mar 12 23:02:51 2015 UTC,"My background: Engineer designing electro-hydraulic and electro-pneumatic systems for heavy mining equipement.   Since preventing runaway vehicles is a high priority, mining equipment these days is usually done with a strong spring applied brake, that requires pneumatic pressure to release. This is done so that, any failure in the system, will default to stopping the vehicle.  I was surprised after Lac Megantic to learn that trains are the opposite - they require active pressure in the system to apply the brakes. After I thought about it, I wasn't surprised - that was the way mining equipment used to be done too, but due to accidents they went with the spring-applied, air-released approach.  I wasn't surprised in the sense that old rail cars and rail regulations were kept in operation because rail companies don't want to spend money on upgrading their systems and cars. The regulations probably haven't changed because of lobbying.   That is why I asked - I'm an outsider looking in to that industry, and I was hoping someone might know.   Accumulators on the cars makes sense for stable operation. And I know quite well how slow pneumatic systems are to react (compared to hydraulic or electrically actuated). That is all the more reason that they should be spring applied. Usually, starting the train and making it move is not done in a hurry... but stopping it often is! When the train wants to roll, they can charge the line, and all the accumulators on each car, and when the system is ready they can send a signal to release all brakes.   The only reason I can think of is that a failure in the system would have one brake (or one car's brakes) apply, but the train has  a lot of momentum and the other cars would still be released / rolling, so the failed car's brakes would wear out, get really hot, possibly start a fire, etc.   But these things are easily solved with some electronics, control system, or sensors.   All in all from an engineering point of view, the only reasons I can think of why we haven't gone to a more safer approach, is profit maximization by rail companies. All other reasons why the safer approach wouldn't work, are engineering problems that can be easily solved."

So in a way, it's the same as having spring-applied brakes.   The difference however is that the accumulators must remain charged - which in the Lac Megantic case, the fire and subsequent shutting off of the main engine, allowed that system to bleed out.   Still haven't found a reason why heavy springs aren't used instead of the pneumatic accumulator... the risk assessments probably weren't thorough enough to imagine such an event happening."

DestructionPorn,2yt83l,BucketheadRules,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"It was a tragedy of errors, and the people who were ultimately responsible will never be punished.   The traffic controller should have called another engineer (or the one that was on rest) to check the train after the fire.    After the engineer had departed, the Nantes Fire Department as well as a police officer from the Sûreté du Québec's Lac-Mégantic detachment responded to a 911 call from a citizen at 23:50 who reported a fire on the first locomotive; according to Nantes Fire Chief Patrick Lambert, ""We shut down the engine before fighting the fire. Our protocol calls for us to shut down an engine because it is the only way to stop the fuel from circulating into the fire."" The fire department extinguished the blaze and notified the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway's rail traffic controller in Farnham. MMA did not grant permission to the engineer to return to the scene, instead summoning a track maintenance foreman unfamiliar with the operation of railway air brakes.   Track workers know only a little more than the average citizen about locomotive operation and safety. This never would have happened if the traffic controller had done the right thing."

DestructionPorn,2yow60,Vranak,26,Mon Mar 30 01:48:26 2015 UTC,"For those interested in knowing the area a bit more, I-94 is a major east-west highway that runs basically from downtown Detroit directly to Chicago.  This particular stretch of it is in Dearborn Michigan, only a few miles from the western edge of Detroit city limits.  It's going to cause a bunch of problems because 94 is the major route between Detroit and DTW airport, as well as one of the main arteries from the city to the western suburbs.  If the infrastructure of the highway is seriously damaged, this could literally be hundreds of millions of dollars in eventual costs.  Source: I live nearby and work as a professional driver in the area.  Happy to answer questions if you want, but I'm going to steer clear of that area so that I don't get caught in the ongoing traffic nightmare.  Edit: apparently the damage to the infrastructure was fairly limited.  The highway was reopened this morning.  Ironically, a big chunk of it is shut down again further east due to damage caused by a totally unrelated accident.  That ones not too bad though.  Will likely open again in a couple hours."

DestructionPorn,2yk2v2,tomqvaxy,6,Tue Mar 10 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point. Being religious in and of itself is not the cause for this kind of behavior. However, many people who are mentally ill grasp onto religion which is why these kinds of incidents often have a seemingly religious impetus when it's nothing more than mental illness with a focus on religion."

DestructionPorn,2yk2v2,El_Nopal,2,Tue Mar 10 16:17:16 2015 UTC,Structure seeking is also why mentally ill people will come up with all-encompassing conspiracy theories that are internally coherent even though the individual premises are all batshit.

DestructionPorn,2yk2v2,phearnation,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"This can happen if the fire is hot enough, depending on the accelerant and the material around the accelerant. If it is a relatively small amount of accelerant and it burns extremely hot, it will burn up everything it touches, and then burn itself out quickly, leaving a partially burned mass. Of course if the surrounding material is very flammable it will go up as well. There are a lot of variables. Strangely, this kind of only-half-burned effect has been seen in humans, usually leading the public to cry ""spontaneous human combustion!"" but I expect the cause in those cases is more malign."

DestructionPorn,2xtj4m,candiedwhiskey,70,Tue Mar 3 22:44:14 2015 UTC,"Read the article.   In hindsight it’s clear that these troops were totally routed and didn’t pose any threat to the coalition forces at this point in the game. Also it should be emphasized that they are retreating. Retreating does not equal surrendered. If they haven’t surrendered then they are enemy combatants. Retreating or “falling back” is a tactical movement. The vast majority of the casualties of war occur in the retreat, and so effectively the object of battle is to force the opposing army into retreat, at which point you deal the true “’death blow”."
DestructionPorn,2xtj4m,OutToTrout,48,Tue Mar 3 23:14:37 2015 UTC,Retreating to their next fighting position.

It was the deadliest and costliest in the U.S. state of Illinois to occur in the month of November and fourth largest for the state overall.  The tornado outbreak caused over 100 injuries and eleven fatalities, of which eight were tornado related. Two tornadoes—both in Illinois and rated EF4 were the strongest documented during the outbreak and combined for five deaths. In addition to tornadoes, the system associated with the outbreak produced sizeable hail peaking at 4.00 in (10.2 cm) in diameter in Bloomington, Illinois, as well as damaging winds estimated as strong as 100 mph (160 km/h) in three locations."

DestructionPorn,2xnu2v,flfchkn,2,Mon Mar 2 19:42:15 2015 UTC,Looks like in the first 2 pictures they did a pretty bad job of saving the house. I guess that wasn't the point of the training exercise.   Either way I like watching stuff burn so thanks for the album!

DestructionPorn,2xnu2v,SchuminWeb,2,Mon Mar 2 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"I guess my beef with that style photo is that you dont stop till the work gets done.. and since the homes are still burning there's plenty of training to be had. Defensive op training, observation of collapse potential indicators, controlling defensive master streams/handlines. Organizing a group photo all for the sake of vanity while there's still good training to be had seems like one of the better reasons why I dislike this style of photos."
