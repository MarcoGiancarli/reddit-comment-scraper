football,3dis8c,VitalFootball,6,Thu Jul 16 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"First, the pitch dimensions are specified in the laws of the game but within ranges. So, it is not totally up to any team to do what they want. Then, the laws even specifies tighter margins for international matches. You may ask: Why these margins? Why not make one standard dimension for the game?. Well, to answer that we have to keep in mind that football is so wide spread and is without a doubt, the most played game in the world. So since everyone around the world wants to play the game, the rules must be flexible enough to allow everyone to play the game legally, since humans differ in there abilities and physical shape. I hope that clears the importance of flexible pitch sizes.  Now, to answer your question more specifically, you should know that most competitions (if not all) of high professional levels do have their specific limits on pitch dimensions, that don,t interfere with the laws of the game. For example, the UEFA champions league rules specify fixed pitch dimensions. So, this depends on the competition."

football,3d85zs,Skulltrail,2,Tue Jul 14 12:29:50 2015 UTC,"A striker for sure as suggested by Louis van Gaal during press conference. We all know Robin van Persie has moved to Fenerbache, we are now left with Rooney, Chicharito (probably will go to loan), Wilson and Pereira. So yes we do need striker, but there is no serious reports on media about top strikers linked with United."
football,3d85zs,mikefooty,0,Tue Jul 14 07:47:57 2015 UTC,Pereira isn't an out and out striker - he's an attacking mid at best.  I have a good feeling that depay will fill that role when Rooney is resting/injured.

Also a striker should be brought in, but I'm not sure that it has to be an established top class striker, a big talent is maybe more preferable. Rooney as number one, and Wilson and another talent to be the back ups."

An insulting one.   You can't offer less money for a teams two time POY than they paid for him as a youngster.  Madrid have kept quiet.    Utd would probably prefer things to be done sooner rather than later so THEY can get on with getting a replacement.  Which is why Madrid are stretching it out to annoy Utd and make them more desperate.  Basically everybody is bluffing and playing hardball right now.  Madrid are cool knowing the player wants to go there.  Nobody doubts this.    TL;DR Utd aren't being stubborn, Madrid are dragging it out on purpose"

football,3d39z4,Lycurgus396,0,Mon Jul 13 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"No, not in the case of Cech. His ability is undeniable and moving to Arsenal doesn't suggest that he is any worse than what he was, its just a case of Chelsea having two goalkeepers who were both too good. If Arsenal was a significant step down I might be more inclined to agree but this step away from Chelsea doesn't change his ability."
football,3d39z4,talkingbiscuits,-6,Mon Jul 13 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"But he went from a team that won the BPL to the team which finished 3rd. How is that not a downgrade, good players move in the other direction. Schneiderlin's move from 7th to 4th shows that he is a good player and moving in the right direction. How does moving to a lesser team not show that he is not the player he was and lets not forget this is about Hart Vs Cech and Hart will play next season competing for the BPL, Cech will be competing for 4th and celebrating a place in the UCL like its a championship."

No. He had good patches but someone of his ability at that price would not make the team if not for him being English and having the potential.

It seems like a lot of players who move to city do not progress there careers at all"
football,3cx3ja,Semuhtra,-1,Sat Jul 11 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"Micah was with us since he was 14, so making it into the first team and becoming a big part of City is hardly what I call not progressing your career. He got wrecked by injuries and Zabaleta took his place and kept it, fairly. Where do you think his career should have progressed to?  Milner got plenty of playing time, he wasn't good enough to be a guaranteed starter with the other competition there but it's not like it was a rarity to see him play.  I actually thought you were going for the 'City ruin English players' angle in your first post (still do tbh) but anyway, Nastasic was due to a manager change, Mancini gave a 19 year old CB a starting place for most of a season in a title challenging side. It's a mystery why Pellegrini didn't like him and most City fans aren't happy with how that went, myself included, but that's hardly the clubs problem.  Is your problem that the players don't get enough time on the pitch or that players don't do as well as expected? What as a club do you think we do wrong to players considering the examples you've named?"
football,3cx3ja,shitheap,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:41:57 2015 UTC,my main problem with the way man city and chelsea are run is that they buy so many over-rated and overpriced players that when they buy a promising english player they just get stuck on the bench and we end up with a dismal international team. Its a shame to see such a waste of talent.
football,3cx3ja,Semuhtra,0,Sat Jul 11 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"So we are talking about English players. I find the complaining about overpriced and overrated players quite funny and ironic when we're discussing English players.  Tell me how we wasted Milner and Johnson? They got a good crack of the whip. And Richards, well I don't know why you mentioned him.  The only players you could say that we left stuck on the bench throughout their time at City were Rodwell, who had plenty of injury problems and actually was given his chances too tbf, and Scott Sinclair who simply was nowhere near good enough. He couldn't even get his place for West Brom when we loaned him out, why should we have been playing him?  It's two players from one notoriously bad transfer window that we should never have bought and that's it. But their names are consistently churned out to paint this picture that isn't true. People also seem to conveniently forget about any English players who have had success with us when making this tired old invalid point.  Edit: a word."
football,3cx3ja,shitheap,0,Sat Jul 11 22:09:35 2015 UTC,Milner and Richards were poor examples to pick up on. Milner has nearly 150 apps in 5 years and Richards had a very good spell in the early part of his career. He's been kept out of the team by injuries and a world class superior.   No one seems to pick issues with players like Steve Harper who spent the vast majority of their entire career on the bench.   I think the main problem is with the system that forces City and such clubs to buy English players just to tick a box on the squad submission sheet. Although I'm yet to see an example of a potentially world class player being kept from their full potential. There's no way that Sinclair/ Johnson/ Rodwell were ever even close to being future £50 million players.
football,3cx3ja,idiotboy__,0,Sun Jul 12 12:41:14 2015 UTC,"Steve Harper was a goalkeeper, there are an endless amount of goalkeepers who spend the majority of their careers on the bench, i mean look at Cech last season, still one of the best keepers in the world and barely caught a ball. I think Harper was a bad choice on your part."
football,3cx3ja,Semuhtra,0,Sun Jul 12 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"Cech is world class and has been picked up by a top team within a year of being bench bound...  My point was that if the player is second rate, they will spend time on the bench if they are at a top club."

football,3cgchw,YM7,9,Wed Jul 8 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"You do realise there's a reason a team is called a ""team"" right? There's only so much an individual can do, no matter how talented that individual is. Sometimes your team mates have to step up and help you out. I mean look at Ronaldo, another supremely talented footballer of this generation. How far have Portugal gone in any recent tournaments? Shouldn't he alone carry the team to victory? I don't think so, a team is only as good as the sum of its parts."
football,3cgchw,paulistaKC,-8,Wed Jul 8 01:44:56 2015 UTC,"tell that to Maradona, Pele and Zidane.  and Portugal has maybe 1/10 the talent this Argentina squad does yet Ronaldo manages to frequently inspire his team to play well beyond their level. if you compare this Portuguese team to the rest of Europe there is absolutely no reason why they should be continously getting as deep into tournaments as they do. even Zlatan does the same for Sweden, who frequently does way better than they should because of him. one player can make a world of difference like Zidane in 2006. he came out of international retirement and carried the team through the qualifiers all the way to the final. they were useless without him."

Ronaldo single handedly carry a lackluster Portugal squad for the last 8 years or so to the point where they are way overrated.   you could even argue Argentina would be almost as good without him considering overwhelming amount of world-class attacking talent they have in Agüero, Tevez, Higuain just to name a few.   if Messi is the legend some claim he is then there is no reason why Argentina should not be dominating the way Barçelona does with the ridiculous talent they have. i know i am going to get downvoted to oblivion for my opinions, especially the next one but i could care less. if Ronaldo had been Argentinian and Messi Portuguese, Argentina would be steamrolling everyone but Germany.

QPR's mercenary period didn't truly begin until Warnock was sacked and Mark Hughes was hired in his place.

football,3bztn0,sam114,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I don't see the difference between Mannschaft Klose and when he plays on teams with quality. Bremen he was a beast, and he has since always hovered between ~.4 and ~.58 goals per game in league play. This does not make his national team performance at .51 per game an outlier in the slightest. The weird one is Bayern, though he played very well in the Pokal and Europe during the same stretch. I think the drop off was due to his fitness, and shorter appearances, in the last two seasons in Munich. At Lazio, he has continued to play strong, with a blip in 2013-14, which brought his GPG back to .4. I think this is due to age, fitness and shorter appearances again. Keeping your production between .4 and .6 GPG (Kaiserslautern aside) throughout your career is still pretty impressive. I guess the point being made here is the difference he makes during the World Cup Finals and Euro Cup Finals, and not the qualifiers of either tournament. When looking at it next to his Pokal/Coppa and Champions/Europa it's obvious his FIFA stats are higher, but are just another bit of evidence that his performance in elimination/trophy games, in all tournaments, Mannschaft or otherwise, is clutch and higher than his league play."

football,3bzsau,tehforsh,0,Fri Jul 3 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"So who thinks Falcao will do well at Chelsea?  I think it's hard for a player to come back from such a serious injury - there have been so many players who have gone from top quality to scrap heap after bad injuries.  I think though Man Utd are having a crap few seasons they weren't so bad that someone of talent like Falcao should only score 4 in 29 appearances.  I mean, RvP and Mata scored 10 in 28 and Rooney 14 in 37 - the chances were there.  So its a matter of management and injury.  Personally I think it is always going to take at least half a season to get back into the game after a bad injury and he was always going to be crap for the first half of the season, but he needed to delivery in the second half.  Unfortunately, due to poor management and media pressure he seemed to lose his confidence and never hit that top form.  The fans never seemed to lose faith, they wanted him to be given a chance and booed when he was subbed off.  A fresh season with a decent pre-season and a strong manager like Mourinho and I can see him doing much better BUT he will never be the player he was.  At 29 (and this is a player from South America which is notorious for falsifying players ages to get more money) coming from that injury and considering pace was one of his main strengths I can't see him ever being that player who terrorised defences around europe."

Football is gaining some popularity now thanks to our men's national team nicknamed the Azkals (street dogs) recent success.  After high school or college.

No mid/lower table team is going to spend £12 million on 1 player when they could get 2x £6mil players or even 4x £3mil players and get a better spread.  Thats aside from the obvious fact that he'd be giving up Milan and champions league football for ... stoke.  One high quality player in a team of lower quality (no disrespect) players won't make much of a difference and that player will be wasted.  2 or 4 moderately skilled players would deliver much more.

football,3bn3st,speculumfight,-2,Tue Jun 30 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"That article just wreaks of propaganda. You could look at any race and find players falling through the cracks. If you really look through the ""code language"", you can see that what they are really talking about is many illegal Hispanics in the USA having troubles playing soccer because they can't get official paperwork. Is that a fault of the system or a fault of the illegals? That doesn't explain the entire situation, of course, but it explains a portion of it. Combine that with sports being tied to colleges in the USA and it's going to be tough for non-English speaking players to come to the USA and play in college.  Also, consider that soccer is still a growing sport in the USA. While the national teams (both men's and women's) have very strong support, MLS is still lacking the support. The salary cap for an MLS team is around $3M. They simply don't have the infrastructure of a league like the NFL (American football) for scouting. (I'd also like to point out that there are all kinds of players in American football that slip through the cracks, even with tons of money and infrastructure in place. Simply put, scouting is difficult.)  Obviously, it would be great for MLS and college soccer to let as few players as possible to slip through the cracks, but at the same time, some of the blame has to be put on the players. On top of that, Mexico isn't exactly a powerhouse, so I'm not buying this argument that Mexico is going to have the better talent because we're missing out on all of these Hispanics."
football,3bn3st,atheist4thecause,7,Tue Jun 30 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"Or, just maybe, US Soccer and MLS have been slow to tap a potentially very fruitful Latino demographic, both because playing youth soccer in the US often requires paying lots of money and US Soccer focuses too much on physical attributes and not enough on technical skill."

However, you might be able to get tickets through a reseller (ticketmaster & viagogo are the two main ones here) for matches - although these can attract a premium & include various admin fees.   There are a few clubs that are easier to see - West Ham often advertise tickets for smaller opponents (West Brom rather than Man Utd, for example). Chelsea & Arsenal will often sell tickets for Carling Cup games as well.  If you're really tight on money, consider a Championship team - Brentford, QPR, Fulham & Charlton are all decent London teams.

I know everyone wants to go out there to win under the framework of rules but on most times I would want moralilty to win over a game of football. Di Canio who I have mentioned once stopped play when he was through on goal when he saw the goalie injured.

Liverpool know Sterling isn't worth that much now but he might be one day, if we have no reason to sell him now we might as well try and get as much money as possible. Also, QPR own 25% (?) of him so we won't get all of it."

All the clubs have different amounts they value each player depending on their existing players, style preference, ownership values, coaching bias, blah, blah, and blah.  This includes the fact that Manchester City can value players much higher just because... well... they can. Rather than mess around with negotiations, they just identify a player and bid £10-15 million more than others."
football,3ak2ni,tehforsh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:50:33 2015 UTC,"If Sterling was a foreign player he'd be selling for £15-20 million TOPS. It's the British status you pay for, especially in a domestic league that needs a quota of homegrown players.  To be fair Ferdinand was more proven. Sterling has literally had 2 seasons where he's shown he's very good but not superstar. He's just one of a long list of good wingers. Ferdinand was captain of a champions league semi-final squad and well established as a quality British defender - back when English players were half decent. Ferdinand was also bought by Leeds for a record fee so had to sell for a top fee, while Sterling cost Liverpool comparatively next to nothing."
football,3ak2ni,dearyleary,0,Mon Jun 22 10:38:41 2015 UTC,"As much of a douche as Ferdinand is, he isn't wrong. If someone actually pays it it would be a crime against the sport."

It was definitely on purpose, but it also could have definitely been a lot worse and more dirty. When the Nigerian woman Ugo Njoku elbowed Samantha Kerr in the jaw, that was a heck of a lot worse, and she was only suspended 3 games, albeit in the WWC (and received a fine). It's interesting to me how Solo got nothing and Njoku got 3 games and a fine, which seems to show that in general women are getting suspended for lesser amounts. I'd like to see it even up a bit more. I mean, Neymar obviously did it on purpose but he didn't put a lot of force into it where Njoku seemed to have an intent to injure."

Being in the 3rd division of your age group isn't really good enough to become professional, considering those players in the 1st division aren't in academies.

With that segregation comes different amounts of payment for players, just as you would have between different men's leagues.

football,39yqit,elastico,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The format makes it highly unlikely that a top team will get upset, which for the women's game, nobody wants to see upsets. It is a very forgiving format.  It's also crazy how much difference there is in the groups. Compare Group D (USA, Australia, Sweden, and Nigeria) to Group C (Japan, Switzerland, Cameroon, and Ecuador). That's not necessarily bad, just interesting."
football,39yqit,FelisLachesis,-1,Tue Jun 16 04:46:06 2015 UTC,"The way the draw was conducted, whichever group got Sweden was going to be a favorite to be the group of death. Add in The Aussies, and it's fighting season.  North Korea follows a similar pattern to the Soviets in terms of sport. They find the kids who are athletic at an early age and put them in an intense training program. They are behind on men's sports by about 50 years, or so, so I'm not sure how they'll catch up. Women's sports is still developing in most of the world, so they were able to get in on the ground floor at about the same time.   Using steroids doesn't hurt, until you get caught. That's what happened to the North Korean women; 5 ladies failed drug tests during the 2011 World Cup, so they were banned from this year's tournament."
football,39yqit,uknapp,0,Tue Jun 16 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"Just want to point out that Australia is part of the AFC (Asia) not the OFC (Oceania). Due to how qualification for world cups work it's near impossible for oceanic teams to qualify for the World Cup so we jumped over to the AFC in 2006. That's why you'll see New Zealand as the Oceanic representative in pretty much everything now, when they manage to qualify."
football,39yqit,uknapp,-1,Tue Jun 16 22:16:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I heard that Australia moved after I wrote that. My thought when I heard that was the first step towards dissolving Oceania. It's really an unnecessary region, especially considering that Russia is part of Europe."
football,39yqit,uknapp,0,Tue Jun 16 22:55:32 2015 UTC,The general skill level in Oceania is quite low and most of the nations in it are applying for membership into the AFC. The OFC was only formed because the AFC refused membership for Australia and New Zealand in the 60's. So they weren't eligible for any international competitions. The best solution would be just to fold the OFC into the AFC and be done with it.

As with the men's world cup, FIFA uses a system to ensure that refs come from all over the world.  That means you can get refs who have little experience officiating international matches.    On the other hand, the 2014 men's world cup had its share of blatant bad and missed calls as a quick google search would show.  They are part of the game.  Heck, it just recently came out that FIFA paid FAI $5,000,000 for the famous non-called Henry handball in 2009."

Having all women sends a message and inspires young women all over the world to play the beautiful game.   I know you're heart is the right place, but telling the women refs ""okay, you had your chance and you were shit.

If the men will make just as many mistakes they won't be able to beat out the female refs anyways, right?   I know you're heart is the right place, but telling the women refs ""okay, you had your chance and you were shit. Here, let some men do it since you're clearly incapable of good refereeing.""   Okay, so are you against women being able to ref the men's game as well because that will be uninspiring to men around the world?

Women getting into the men's game breaks down the barriers set by men. Men going into the fledgling women's game reinforces those barriers. You need to understand the difference. Once the women's game is professional, well-supported and self-sustaining, then bringing men into the game can be thought about.   And no, you're not doing the opposite. You clearly state that women officials are not good enough and need to be replaced by men. That is your argument, explicitly and clearly stated in your post.   So banning men from officiating the women's game but not banning women from officiating the men's game is not sexist? It sounds pretty sexist to me.   The issue is undermining the colossal achievements made by a group of people. It's not about sex but it is about a group of people whose opportunities within this career have been limited and who are now, themselves, developing those opportunities. They've put the hard work in and deserve to be rewarded by being allowed the opportunity to bring all that hard work to fruition. Getting involved can be helpful where that help is wanted - that help is most certainly not wanted when the premise is that they're not good enough to do it themselves.

The more you decrease the product of the game, the less soccer fans want to watch it.   Well soccer fans seem to love the game despite the shit refereeing produced weekly by male officials.   Regardless, women's football is growing pretty darned well without men's intervention so far. Your argument here makes no sense, anyway - you're original argument states that women officials are not good enough and replacing them with men will be better for the sport. Now you're saying that the pool of women officials won't be replaced if they're good enough. If even one man replaces a women based on any measure, whether that's merit or something else, that is a diluted pool reducing the opportunity for female officials who need and deserve opportunities to improve and develop their game.   Okay, so if you are to be consistent then do you think that women should be banned from the men's game? If so, I have no problem with your position of total segregation, but if you are arguing for men to be banned from women's soccer but women not to be banned form men's soccer than that is completely sexist.

Adding women officials to the men's game bears no relevance whatsoever to adding male officials to the women's game.   You need to address your understanding of sexism. Equality is about equal opportunity; currently the opportunity for women at any level of the sport is well below that of the men's game, and their inclusion within the sport needs to be supported, not diluted by replacing women with men at the highest level of the game."
football,39r2p7,EmpyrealSorrow,0,Sun Jun 14 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"This is fine for the men's game. Women getting into the men's game breaks down the barriers set by men.   This is getting into patriarchy theory, which is something I strongly disagree with. There is a story where one of the women playing in the WWC was brought to a psychologist by her mom because the woman wanted to be a soccer player. That is an example of a mother setting the standard on her daughter. The fact is that society grew up men and women working together and they developed rules together. Because humans are specialized, women developed their problems/inequalities and men developed their problems/inequalities. To say that only men set up rules of society is false and sexist. Also, if you consider the individual, a man who is denied a job in the women's game likely did not set a rule against women playing in soccer, so to punish that man with sexist policies is unjust. Sexism is not the right tool to combat sexism.   Once the women's game is professional, well-supported and self-sustaining, then bringing men into the game can be thought about.   Listen to your wording, because it shows one thing that I'm very worried about. You think that once the women's game is full professional, etc. that then we can start to THINK about bringing men into the women's game. You aren't even sure that you want men in at that point. I'm sure you won't argue for getting women out of the men's game at that point, either. What will happen, and we have seen this over and over throughout many societies (so often so that it's recognized by sociology) is that women will gain equality but the sexist policies put in place to help them gain equality will not be removed. This will result in extra rights for women, not equality among the sexes.  Also, I want to touch on your point again about men setting barriers for women. I want to point out that women are now setting barriers for men by banning them from women's soccer in officiating, but weirdly not from coaching (yet). If you are against sexes putting up barriers for each other, why do you support policies that do just that?   Regardless, women's football is growing pretty darned well without men's intervention so far.   If it's growing so well then why did you say that women's soccer is barely supported? I'd agree that it is growing, but it's also supported. I think it would be growing more quickly if men were allowed to officiate, though, and I think there are going to be long-term consequences for these policies. On top of that, I think that these policies put in place to ban men are unethical, just as the restrictions banning women were unethical.   you're original argument states that women officials are not good enough and replacing them with men will be better for the sport.   You're interpretation of what you perceive to be my original argument is false. I was stating that men were banned from officiating the WWC because people felt the men refs would beat out the women refs. My idea was to include men as well as women (not replacing women with men completely) so that the officials with the highest merit can ref the game. This, by definition, will create the best officiating product because it includes the entire pool of refs.   If even one man replaces a women based on any measure, whether that's merit or something else, that is a diluted pool reducing the opportunity for female officials who need and deserve opportunities to improve and develop their game.   I don't understand how you don't see this as sexism. How does a woman deserve an opportunity to be a WWC official over a man if the man beats her out on merit? What you are saying is that women are inherently entitled to the reffing positions because they are women, and men are not because they are men. That's a dangerous thought process.   Consistency is the wrong notion since the games are not consistent between themselves. The women's game is nothing like the men's game in terms of development and so the two should not be considered on an equivalent footing. Adding women officials to the men's game bears no relevance whatsoever to adding male officials to the women's game.   We just fundamentally disagree on ethics here. I don't think that level of development should equate to allowing sexism, racism, or any other type of discrimination that we can think up. This kind of thinking comes from thinking about groups as groups and failing to look at and see how the individuals within the groups are impacted. Consider that a male official at a lower level of women's soccer that is officiating can never officiate on the biggest stage even though he has been a part of helping grow the women's game. And this is based solely off of what sex he is. That's not moral or ethical.   You need to address your understanding of sexism.   IMO you need to.   Equality is about equal opportunity; currently the opportunity for women at any level of the sport is well below that of the men's game, and their inclusion within the sport needs to be supported, not diluted by replacing women with men at the highest level of the game.   I want you to consider why sports are segregated. They are segregated to help women play, even if they are not the best players at the sport. Many leagues allow women in. The NFL, for instance, has never had a woman make a team, but there is nothing banning women from making a team. Although it is often difficult to admit, women are worse at most sports, and most of it is biological. That's why we've seen men dominate sports over every single culture that allowed men and women to play together. Unfortunately, what this tells us is that women's sports will almost always produce a lower quality product on the field than men's sports, and because of that, fans will have a tougher time getting into women's sports because they typically want to see the highest product possible. That's why pro sports are almost always watched more than amateur sports. Less fans means less money. Less money means those working in women's sports will make less to keep the league going. (Payment is often based on a % of sales.) The segregation is the equal opportunity part. It's up to the women's game to build a bigger fan base to bring in more fans to make more money to pay players, officials, coaches, etc. more.  EDIT: And because I have some space left, about sexism being equal opportunity. Consider the man officiating women's soccer that is banned from officiating the WWC. How does he have equal opportunity?"

You cannot give one sex a 175 year head start, and then say, ""okay, we are going to be equal from this time forward"".  If you want to be ""equal"" here's what you do:  First, ban all men's soccer from the youth to the professional level for say the next 100 years.  No games at all.  And, you need parents, educators, politicians, religious and societal leaders of all types to advocate that boys should be prohibited from playing soccer, or any sports for that matter, on the grounds that it is bad for their health, and will make then unmanly (and, god forbid, probably turn them into homosexuals).  It will be okay to cheer for the girls and women playing, but no more.      After 100 years or so you could start to let some boys play ""refined"" versions of sports -- nothing as hard or fast as what the women are playing mind you as, again, that might make them ""unmanly"".  Do that for say another 40 or so years.  Then you could let them start playing in grammar and high schools -- certainly not college or professionally.  Because the boys' teams  will be unimportant - just to humor the kids you know -- the boys can use left over uniforms from the girls teams, and can practice whenever the girls do not need the facilities.  You can schedule games around the girls' games again so as to be sure not to interfere with the more important girls' games.  Do that for about 25 years.  Then maybe let the boys play in college.  Again -- don't allow them to use the main fields and equipment unless the girls do not need it.  Oh, and be sure and pay their coaches a small percentage of what the girls' coaches make.  For sure hire only women coaches because male coaches would not know how to coach.  After another 10 years or so you could suggest that maybe there could be a professional league for men. And you could even go out on a limb and have men ref those games - but be sure to have women refs around supervising, because the men would not be really be able to do it.  Give that another 15 to 20 years and you are back to our starting line ready to say everything is ""even"".     Or -- we can deal with the reality that there simply are not that many high level women's team matches so that a couple hundred or so women refs can generate experience.  When those matches do take place -- women need to be the CRs and ARs so that the gain the necessary experience to continue to develop their skills."

About your ridiculous thought experiment, I have acknowledge that there are cultures that don't accept women doing things, and I have stated that this is wrong. The problem is that you are using the extreme examples to benefit women that aren't in that situation. Women in the USA, England, Sweden, Australia, etc. didn't grow up in that situation for the most part.  and to get to your second paragraph, I feel like you don't realize that boys face a lot of these issues you are talking about outside of sports. Boys are taught to be manly. They are discouraged from all kinds of things such as cutting hair, cooking, putting on makeup, wearing dresses, etc. In fact, it is much more okay for women to wear ""manly clothing"" (such as jeans) than it is for men to where ""feminine clothing"" (such as a dress). Men have been forced into the military, pushed out of acting, music, and many other areas that deal with expressions because men are expected to ""man up"". On public transit, there are public campaigns to shame men into closing their legs. Men and boys have faced these struggles for hundreds of years. Do you see even one industry that has a quota for where men are underrepresented? No, you don't. There are not women being banned from being hairstylists and makeup artists so that men can get those jobs. And you know what? I like it that way. Why? Because sexism does not solve sexism. What needs to be dome is tear down the culture that benefits women such as elementary education, go after employers that hire on a sexist policy, etc. Your ideology would result in banning of half of the population for every single industry until we have a perfect split and that would create a very inefficient society that has very little freedom for individuals.   Or -- we can deal with the reality that there simply are not that many high level women's team matches so that a couple hundred or so women refs can generate experience. When those matches do take place -- women need to be the CRs and ARs so that the gain the necessary experience to continue to develop their skills.   A boy and girl are born in a Western society. What benefit does the boy have over the girl to officiate in the World Cup? He has none. The paths they choose over their lifetime will lead towards or away from the ability to ref a World Cup game, and if both the boy and girl lead a life that takes them towards officiating soccer, they will both have an equal opportunity to become a World Cup ref. This is the hard truth that you don't want to face."

Women officiating on the men's game is an entirely different issue and one I have no qualms about."

We're talking about segregation here. Should the sexes be segregated or not? Your arguments that men aren't needed to grow women's soccer can just as easily be flipped to say that women aren't needed to grow men's soccer. You called women's soccer ""their sport"", and by their you meant women. So does that mean men's soccer is ""their sport"", and by their we mean men? It's sexist to have a double standard where women are allowed into both men's and women's soccer but men are only allowed into one. That's literally the most sexist type of policy you can have."
football,39r2p7,redchilliprod,0,Sun Jun 14 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring the issue that the women's game is not yet developed and that sexual discrimination is still a huge problem. There is nothing wrong with getting women involved in men's football - men's football is not going to be affected one bit by female officials.   However women have put a colossal effort into building the sport up from barely anything. Women are still largely amateurs with very few professional players or officials. It's mostly women (with some men - there are numerous male coaches, for example) who are putting the effort into making this a professional sport. To get men in there to literally ""sort out the problems"" unravels all the work put into the sport by women."
football,39r2p7,redchilliprod,0,Sun Jun 14 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"and that sexual discrimination is still a huge problem.   Yes, sexual discrimination is a huge problem. That's exactly why I don't believe in trying to build women's soccer through sexual discrimination.   There is nothing wrong with getting women involved in men's football - men's football is not going to be affected one bit by female officials.   Do you really not see the double standard by banning men from officiating women's soccer but not banning women from officiating men's soccer? That's extremely sexist. If you think sexual discrimination has held women down, why would you be okay with sexual discrimination against men? We have seen the impacts sexual discrimination can have on individuals.   It's mostly women (with some men - there are numerous male coaches, for example)   So why allow male coaches and yet ban male officials? Do you see how you pick and choose where you want the sexual discrimination against men to be? If your stance is going to be that the women's game should be all women to help get women in the game, shouldn't that include coaching?   To get men in there to literally ""sort out the problems"" unravels all the work put into the sport by women.   This is a misrepresentation of my stance. My stance is that by allowing men and women to officiate women's soccer can pick the best officials regardless of sex. Even if women officials were as good as or better than the men officials, I would still have this stance. As a result of banning men, however, I did state that the women's game is suffering from bad officiating which is going to slow down growth, because soccer fans typically want to see the highest quality product possible.   However women have put a colossal effort into building the sport up from barely anything.   I really don't think you give women's soccer's current position enough credit. In some countries, there are severe cultural barriers, but that's not true with all countries. In the USA, the women are strongly supported. The USA vs Australia game had 3.3 million viewers. USA vs Sweden had 4.5 million viewers. Every single WWC game is being shown on cable TV, and Fox Sports is also streaming them all on the Internet. That's quite a bit of support.  EDIT: Also, and this is not meant to be offensive, but the women's game is maybe around what the U-18 game is at. Maybe U-20? Despite that, the women still get FAR more viewership than even the U-23 US National team. Most of the ""under"" teams don't even get on TV, and when they do they don't get nearly the viewership the women get. So this idea that the women are not supported very much is very false, at least in the USA."

I'm using both angles because both are true. How is it bizarre? If women were just as good as men at soccer it wouldn't be a segregated sport from a player perspective. From an officiating and coaching perspective, I actually have the angle that women can be just as good as men. Cutting out men completely, however, will cut out some quality refs, not because men are better than women but because you are cutting the talent pool down. The quality  would also go down if all brunettes were banned from officiating the women's game, but obviously brunettes are not completely superior to blondes and red heads in reffing."
football,39r2p7,murphmeister75,0,Mon Jun 15 15:55:23 2015 UTC,"I work in TV in the UK.   Recently, I attended a session at the headquarters of Channel 4 which surrounded the diversity targets that all the channels were committing to, after targets set 10 years ago had been woefully missed.   One person asked how production companies can square their ideas about discrimination with having quotas to fill. Aren't we just ticking boxes?  The response from the panel was 'None of us feel comfortable ticking boxes. But it is something that has to be done so we can look back and say we made a difference for the better.'  After this meeting, a programme that was in the process of being made for a famous white male presenter was recast with a man of Asian origin to host. I will not give any details, so please don't ask.   One person I spoke to suggested that this was wrong because the original presenter was a 'better tv presenter', with more experience and a proven track record in making good programmes.  So, why am I telling you this? Because I want to know what you think should be done in this situation. Because it is ultimately the very same question you pose about football referees."

Quotas based on race are racist and quotas based on sex are sexist.  I don't know the White and Asian presenters, but if the White presenter is better based on merit than they should get the job. I say this with a bit of a caveat because I am not a believer in seniority, but I also know that seniority exists in some places."

I don't understand the Swedish strategy at all as I think they needed a win more than the USA. From the USA's perspective, a draw puts us in the driver's seat to win the group. I don't think Pia Sundhage is a good coach at all. Her substitutions don't do anything, she overplays her starters, she wears her team out in practice, and strategically she leaves a lot to be desired. Oh, and she motivates the opponent by calling them out before the game, and not just as a team, but on an individual basis.

football,39hozu,adrianjherman,0,Sat Jun 13 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"You have to consider the entire situation. First of all, the Women's World Cup is not the most prestigious trophy in soccer. The Men's World Cup is. There is no question about that. If we're being honest, some of these youth teams bring a higher quality product to the field and play against stiffer competition. As much as I enjoyed the USWNT World Cup trophies, there wasn't a whole lot of competition at the time. And to be honest, some of these youth teams can beat the women's team. Now consider that the USMNT victories created history. We had never beat the Netherlands, for instance, and we had only ever scored 1 goal against them. We scored 4 against them in one game. Friendly or not, from a historical perspective, that's huge. And the friendlies for both elite teams in Germany and the Netherlands were on their home turf. So yeah, if we're going to be honest about these things that may be uncomfortable to admit and look at ALL of the team results, this very well could be the best week ever for the US National Teams.

Some day maybe that will change, but right now that is the case. The reason we have soccer segregated by sex is to give women a chance to play. If women were as good as the men there wouldn't be segregation. These things might be uncomfortable to admit, but they are the truth. I'm actually a big fan of the USWNT and they are the reason I started watching soccer.   So, yes, I am clear, you are not a lover of sports or competition.   This is just character assassination on your part. Just because I consider the Men's World Cup trophy to be a more prestigious award than the Women's World Cup does not mean that I dislike the sport or look down on the women. If the women improve and become better than the men then I will consider the Women's World Cup trophy to be more prestigious.   You only care about men's teams.   That's not true. As I said before, I started watching soccer because of the USWNT. They were my gateway into the USMNT. I've watched a lot of the WWC this year and by the end of it, I will likely have watched more of the women's games than the men's games. I don't deserve the personal attacks you are sending my way.   For those of us that value sports realize the ladies are up on the men.   The ladies are up on the men? What do you mean by this? Do you mean that the women are better than the men? I'm confused.   Quality in the women's game has a lot to do with sociological issues.   Obviously sociological issues have a lot to do with why the women's game has less quality than the men's game, but you have only given a reason for why it is. That does not change the fact that this is true. And so the more these sociological factors change, the more fans will be drawn in and the more prestigious the WWC will become.

Now 2 Years later I'm a real fan of the sport and follow all that i can"

football,39hwpa,demacho91,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"So I started with FIFA myself and started following the teams that I managed as I could. For a while I followed Walsall (Skybet League 2) until Tommy Mooney left. Then I kind of fell off, both of Walsall and FIFA.  I didn't consider myself a major football fan until I started playing Football Manager, and as a result, started keeping my eye on AFC Wimbledon (since they have a sponsorship deal with SI, the company that makes FM). I would highly recommend Football Manager, but only if you want to become addicted! You'll start to learn the rules of each league and the teams involved. If you play lower leagues (so Conference Regionals, teams like that) you'll know how much money is involved in each team and the hardships they have. You can raelly make Football Manager go as in depth as you'd like. Want to know more about teams 10-15 leagues down? There's an add-on for that. You can learn as much or as little as you'd like. Because of FM I watched the FA Trophy Final between North Ferriby United and Wrexham, two teams that could probably subsist on one week of Wayne Rooney's wages. Ask in any bar who those teams are and you'll get nothing but bewildered faces (I'm in the US)!  Since their good performance against Liverpool I've kept my eye on AFC Wimbledon (and that beast of a man Akinfenwa), and I'm going to make sure to watch as many of their games as I can next year. I use vipbox.tv to stream my games. firstrow.eu (or something like that) is another alternative. It's tougher for League 2 teams, but to me the Football League is where it's at.   EDIT: If you can, and you're not in the UK, go through a VPN (or download) and watch the Football League Show. Match of the Day covers the Premier League, but the Football League Show covers the Championship, League 1, and League 2. I watch it as much as I can, but sometimes my internet doesn't cooperate."

football,39hwpa,6180,0,Thu Jun 11 21:57:40 2015 UTC,"Its tough to explain it all in detail here, but here is the reddit version of however much I can explain to you about how football leagues work. Hope the points below make some sense...    A vast majority of countries have their own national football league system (English Premier League, Saudi League, Chinese League.. Etc). The biggest and most popular national leagues are in Europe, such as;   England - Premier League  Spain - La Liga Italy - Serie A Germany - Bundesliga    In the national leagues there are separate divisions of football. First division, second division and so on. The first division represent the best teams in that country. The next best play in the second division.. And so on into the third and sometimes even fourth divisions of football depending on the number of teams in the country.  Each league has approx. 18 to 20 teams competing. For example England has 20 teams while Germany has 18.  The whole point is to finish as high in the standings as you can. Number one is ofcourse the champion. Usually in football leagues, if you finish in the bottom 3, you will be relegated or demoted to a lesser division of football. For example from first division down to second. Conversely If you finish in top 3 you can be promoted from second division to first. There is no promotion in the first division as it's the highest league in that country. The intricacies of this can vary from country to country but the general idea is the same.  Each team plays one another twice (home game and away game) so that means teams will play 34 to 38 games a season depending on the number of teams in the league.  The big European leagues begin in August and end in May During the months of July and Jan there is a time called Transfer Period where players can be bought and sold from team to team. No other time in the year can this take place.  Teams usually play in multiple competitions during the months of Aug to May. These include local domestic cups such as the FA Cup in England or the Copa Del Rey in Spain. There are also larger and very prestigious continental cups such as the Champions League in Europe, where all the top teams from Europe compete to be crowned the best on the continent.    I hope that helps lol there's a lot to take in there. Hopefully it made sense to some degree. If you have any specific questions I'll be happy to answer them for you.   And I'm a Manchester United fan, since 2000. I became a fan cause I really liked David Beckham and Paul Scholes from the England national team."

Why didn't Messi just enter a plea bargain and settle the government owed taxes?  It appears to be based on the reports that Messi's father allegedly orchestrated a fraud to avoid paying taxes.  Messi's father could face jail time for this.    The incidents were fairly recent in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  Where Messi age would be 20, 21 and 22.  Its not like Messi was still a minor here."

SHARE The verdict came at the end of the retrial of 73 defendants in a case that sparked deadly riots in 2013 in Port Said, prompting then-president Mohammed Morsi to declare a state of emergency in the city. The court also sentenced 40 defendants to up to 15 years in prison and acquitted the rest. The verdicts can be appealed. The February 2012 riot began at the end of a league match in Port Said between Cairo's al-Ahly, Egypt's most successful club, and home side el-Masry.

You went through 20 years of ups (if you've been around longer enough to know your arse from your elbow) and now you are having a few years of little success you want to support a different team. Pathetic in my opinion.
