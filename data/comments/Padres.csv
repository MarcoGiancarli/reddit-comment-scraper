Padres,3e684z,justinjameswatt,5,Wed Jul 22 07:14:27 2015 UTC,"Nah man, this is just the box office price. They're much cheaper on stubhub. I've lived in SF for three years now and you can get bleacher seats for about $15 no problem for just about any game. I'm there whenever the Pads come to town.   As far as other seat they range from about 30-60 bucks, with the real good ones being in the hundreds. But still, not as unaffordable as the box office would lead you to believe.   Pretty sure its because they have tons of season ticket holders who are willing to regularly unload tickets for less than face value."
Padres,3e684z,robbybobbyboobybaby,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:40:44 2015 UTC,I have tickets to the Sep 11 game.
Padres,3e684z,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Wed Jul 22 07:44:49 2015 UTC,"those tickets are only that expensive because they're for the bay bridge series, it's a giveaway, and it's the week of the game. standing room is usually like $20 and bleachers are usually around $30-40."

Padres,3e4pq9,FriarBot,6,Tue Jul 21 23:00:11 2015 UTC,We'll get them tomorrow! The guys are fired up and OD isnt pitching!
Padres,3e4pq9,megustanlosyogapants,3,Wed Jul 22 05:02:36 2015 UTC,Just when we thought the pitching was getting dialed in...this game happened.
Padres,3e4pq9,BobTaco,2,Wed Jul 22 05:05:10 2015 UTC,I wouldnt put too much stock into an OD start. The rest of the rotation has gotten it together. Just gotta put up with OD until we can get morrow back
Padres,3e4pq9,megustanlosyogapants,2,Wed Jul 22 05:11:06 2015 UTC,Thayer wasn't himself either. And I hope Morrow can get back in top form. OD is best used in spurts anyway.
Padres,3e4pq9,BobTaco,2,Wed Jul 22 05:27:35 2015 UTC,Ha ha! Made you go to the bullpen...for 1 pitch!
Padres,3e4pq9,BobTaco,0,Wed Jul 22 05:02:06 2015 UTC,Sanchez got gum thrown at him? Did I miss that?

Padres,3e4pq9,Padreschargers7,0,Wed Jul 22 04:45:08 2015 UTC,The big issue is Sanchez running through the infield like a douchebag. You don't do that when you get out. He's instigating by doing that and the bat flip. Typical giants bullshit
Padres,3e4pq9,Striking_Gently,2,Wed Jul 22 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"In all levels of play we've ran through the infield after a putout.  You just sprinted to first, you aint about to take the long way back to the dugout, that's for the bat boys."
Padres,3e4pq9,Clint_Swift,7,Wed Jul 22 05:46:11 2015 UTC,Except Kelley was jawing at him before he was even out.
Padres,3e4pq9,SwoleBuddha,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:44:58 2015 UTC,Video doesn't look to show Kelley saying anything until Sanchez turns to the infield but could be wrong

Ugh, I'm just so sick of Enberg, Grant, and Sweeney just praising, admiring, and complimenting if not as much as ours. You don't see that ANYWHERE else."
Padres,3e4pq9,rileygmeier,3,Wed Jul 22 04:30:36 2015 UTC,This is because baseball has to do with individual accomplishments. If someone is doing well they let viewers know. Most of their complements are towards the individuals and not necessarily the team as a whole. It's more about the game itself instead of stroking the team...which happens all the time in other sports.

Padres,3e4pq9,JanitorOfSanDiego,4,Wed Jul 22 04:31:33 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. I like having announcers who call the game as they see it and aren't just homers.

When it was first announced he would most likely be leading off there was so much hate and speculation that he could even do it and then he ended up being a major staple in the offense.
Padres,3e0a2i,PolskaWonder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"He was our best player before his injury. Not a traditional leadoff man, but his power threat added a dimension to the top of the lineup. I'd slot him at 1B immediately."

Padres,3e1b2w,espo619,2,Tue Jul 21 05:21:11 2015 UTC,My go to is any seats behind the Padres dugout if you can afford it! Hit up Hodads on the 2nd floor for a burger or Pizza Port for a slice then the Craft Beer counter for the best beer for the buck! Go early and check out the Padres store right of the sales counter and see where they film the Padres Social Hour and maybe see a star getting interviewed. Check out the deck above the Western Metal Supply if you havent been. Cheer for the Padres and enjoy!

Padres,3dzqsq,brex2599,7,Tue Jul 21 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"I see nothing unique about blue and yellow. It's bland and rather common and I'm fatigued of it as any sort of team color. Interesting personal fact: every school I went to before college used blue and gold as it's school's color combo. I wasn't a fan of ""bring back the brown"" until recently and I'd be a bit disappointed if it's anything other than a color combo this team has used in the past."
Padres,3dzqsq,UserDrew,4,Mon Jul 20 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about that, another different colored jersey again loosing our identity. If we don't stick to a previous color we all look lost at the games."

Brown, as 80's as that is, is something unique and interesting. It shows ties to our community, and the history of Southern California. The question then becomes, if not Brown (while also staying away from black, white, royal blue, and orange. Oh also red, grey, and purple.), then what colors are open to us that have both historical meaning to San Diego, and offers a unique blend not seen in any (or most) MLB teams?"

Padres,3dzqsq,FriarFanatic,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"I had this image of 80sness stuck in my head. I didn't much like the styles, the cut of the uniforms, etc. People started posting concept images of the colors adapted to contemporary uniforms and I started to think there was something to it. I would probably keep the logos as they are or use a different font. Probably go with Brown, Yellow, White without the orange. I don't know specifically but the ""bring back the brown"" crowd made a good case for it and won me over.   Idig thesandandbluecolor."

Padres,3dzqsq,GodOfPopTarts,4,Mon Jul 20 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"I like the yellow SD logo on the hat, but I'm worried they will keep the all white SD based on the All-Star logo. I'm curious to see what a white S with a yellow interlocking D would look like."
Padres,3dzqsq,MrDL104,4,Mon Jul 20 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"To those saying you don't like the yellow jersey, have you seen the A's wear theirs? It's probably my favorite non-throwback uniform in baseball. However, I'm not sure if the blue secondary color will work as well as the green. Either way, a primarily yellow uniform isn't automatically bad."
Padres,3dzqsq,espo619,3,Tue Jul 21 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the effort, but I'm just not feeling any of these. They're honestly just not different enough. ""Padres"" script needs to go, and the gold ""SD"" on the same blue caps just isn't different enough for me. Also, I'm no fan of the way the ""San Diego"" letters are arranged.  It's like they wanted to go with a clean look for what we have now, but the Padres font is not clean at all. Our blue jerseys w/SD on the front is a much better look than the home whites.  Don't get me started on the camo.  If we could somehow incorporate gold into the uni Cashner is sporting in the page banner, with the brown hat, and make the Padres font less horrible, I'd be all for that.

Padres,3dzqsq,jasonwhatis,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but I strongly dislike the currently Padres cursive script. I'm ok with the capitals, but I'm biased towards the 80s brown script (and colors obviously).   I'm not over the moon about blue/yellow but it's better than what we currently have. I'd be happy with blue/yellow and more frequently used browns for alts or something. I'm also not a huge fan of pinstripes."

We can have an adult discussion on the matter.    after all these years of ""our team is ugly, brown is the best!""   I mean there is a reason they keep getting upvoted, it's not like it's a super unpopular opinion, if that were the case it would be downvoted into oblivion, so that kinda makes it a valid topic to bring up.  I personally would love to see the Brown back, not a retread of a throwback, but done in a modern way, I think it could look really good. That being said, I think most of us can agree that the current uniforms are just awful and bland. Nobody is saying it alters their onfield play, but you can't say a jersey isn't suppose to provoke some feeling of pride in a fan base, and these just are not doing that in the least.   So yes, I think that Brown is the best option for the Padres, but I am willing to see what they come up with for next season, they could look really good. I've also been thinking that if they absolutely refuse to go with brown, going with a city wide sports color scheme is not a bad idea... though their timing could have been better..."
Padres,3dzjj4,Clint_Swift,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"I know we can have an adult discussion about it. In fact, I am pretty sure you and I have in the past.  But what I'm saying is that he is lashing out because people who don't like the brown always get downvoted, and rarely get a retort. People just downvote our posts and  move on, we rarely get the chance for a discussion. So no matter how nice we are about it, we get downvoted into oblivion. So why not release some of that anger?  Not saying they are right for doing it, just saying that it gets frustrating when nobody listens."

I mean, no GM is ever gonna think, hey that guy on twitter/FB/reddit is right, we should pick up X for Y! But ownership might take into consideration uniform colors, as remote as that possibility might be. It's the human condition, we hate feeling like we have zero influence.

Padres,3duz7g,folettary,2,Sun Jul 19 20:39:21 2015 UTC,"I kinda got a question going back to Middlebrooks at SS  Isn't it easier for 2B to transition to SS than it is for 3B to transition to SS? If that's the case, then why wouldn't we be having Solarte be practicing and playing SS today over Middlebrooks?  Middlebrooks is absolutely fantastic at 3B, and is by far our best option defensively at third. So it doesn't quite make too much sense to me to move our best 3B to SS in favor of Solarte who seems like he could essentially play every single position in the infield."

Padres,3duz7g,HeadleysHobos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:21 2015 UTC,And back goes the tarp...
Padres,3duz7g,HeadleysHobos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:46 2015 UTC,Has your broadcast mentioned what the plan is for pitching? Will Cashner be able to go back out after that long break? He was dealing before the delay.
Padres,3duz7g,Karma_Chamillionaire,0,Sun Jul 19 23:23:55 2015 UTC,Nope. Not sure when or where the tarp is going to arrive.
Padres,3duz7g,brex2599,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:59 2015 UTC,Currently dry by Cowles Mountain.
Padres,3duz7g,Steameffekt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:42:55 2015 UTC,Not that I'm a big stats guy or anything but do the 2 kemp doubles still count towards his season stats? Basically the question is does anything about this game count?
Padres,3duz7g,Adbcpolo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"No, don't believe so. It's like it never happened"

Padres,3dsvaq,Chargers99,20,Sun Jul 19 03:18:23 2015 UTC,"While he hasn't been 100% what we wanted so far, he has not been TERRIBLE. He has just been very underwhelming. I scratch my head when I read articles saying he is terrible/washed up."
Padres,3dsvaq,folettary,6,Sun Jul 19 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"He had one long stretch of abysmal play, but early in the year, he was on fire. Obviously we'd want something more consistent on the good side, but in no way is he a washed up guy."
Padres,3dsvaq,milkchococurry,3,Sun Jul 19 07:22:55 2015 UTC,He was playing terrible for his contract
Padres,3dsvaq,Hancock02,5,Sun Jul 19 13:31:25 2015 UTC,The contract that was subsidized $30M by the Dodgers?
Padres,3dsvaq,MrDL104,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:56:17 2015 UTC,What I mean by underwhelming.
Padres,3dsvaq,folettary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"Uh, he was a top 5 worst starter in the NL in the first half. He's been on a good run recently and I hope he keeps it up, but he was really, really bad before."
Padres,3dsvaq,JolIyJack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:50 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Maybe based on expectations but there are plenty of players who played worse than Kemp in the first half.
Padres,3dsvaq,folettary,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"There really aren't. If he was getting paid league minimum he still would've been a disappointment. You have to keep in mind that not only was he a joke at the plate, he is also one of the worst defensive outfielders in baseball. It's not a good combination."
Padres,3dsvaq,JolIyJack,3,Sun Jul 19 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"Cmon there are players on the Padres that were worse than him.  Amarista, Gyorko, Middlebrooks. There are 3 just on our team. It's fine to call Kemp underwhelming based on expectations/ his contract, but he is definitely not one of the worse players. That is trying way to hard to hate Kemp.  You think a guy getting paid league minimum and hitting .250+ w/ 50 RBI is disappointing? That's good offensive production that even his defense can't ruin if he was paid league minimum."
Padres,3dsvaq,folettary,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:42:20 2015 UTC,".250 with few walks and little power is garbage. He's not Andrelton Simmons or Billy Hamilton. He has nothing to offer but his bat.  Based on first half splits, minimum 200 PA, out of 36 MLB RF he ranked 27th in BA, 34th in OBP, 28th in SLG, 35th in WAR. That is the definition of terrible.  The 3 guys you mentioned were also shit but none of them got nearly as much playing time so I would argue they were less of a liability overall."
Padres,3dsvaq,JolIyJack,2,Mon Jul 20 00:31:11 2015 UTC,"""Garbage""? Obviously I can't change your mind, I just think you are being WAY too harsh on Kemp. Go look through the rosters of all 30 teams and tell me you can't find plenty of starters that were worse than him.  Edit: Go here http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/ and sort by any stat you want. Look at players w/ 300+ AB (ie: playing time)and you'll see plenty of players below Kemp. I'm not arguing he was amazing or even good, but saying he is one of the worst is just wrong."
Padres,3dsvaq,folettary,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"As I said in my comment, statistically he ranked among the worst offensive players at his position and was arguably the absolute worst defensively. I'm just looking at the facts here. I don't have a vendetta against Kemp, but I think it's ridiculous to say he was anything less than absolutely terrible so far."
Padres,3dsvaq,JolIyJack,2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:44 2015 UTC,We must be looking at different stats.
Padres,3dsvaq,folettary,11,Mon Jul 20 00:50:19 2015 UTC,"Oh hey look, it's the regular second half Padres."
Padres,3dsvaq,EagleEyeInTheSky,9,Sun Jul 19 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"Go Pads, make that run for .500."
Padres,3dsvaq,rockyct,8,Sun Jul 19 08:00:34 2015 UTC,"He just had one month where he was literally awful, he's played pretty well the rest of the months but everyone just focuses on that one month though."
Padres,3dsvaq,weavdaddy,3,Sun Jul 19 04:16:26 2015 UTC,That one month and lack of HRs...even though RBIs are a bit more important imo
Padres,3dsvaq,BobTaco,3,Sun Jul 19 06:16:58 2015 UTC,At the rate he's hitting them now though he could easily get up to 20
Padres,3dsvaq,crimsontideftw24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:54:49 2015 UTC,Knock on wood.
Padres,3dsvaq,BobTaco,13,Sun Jul 19 19:18:14 2015 UTC,7 game hit streak with multiple hits in 5 of them.  I like!

Padres,3dsvaq,Mordkay,5,Sun Jul 19 06:08:31 2015 UTC,Hes the guy they brought as a face for the team hopefully he can keep it up and other bats follow.
Padres,3dsvaq,Infamous89,2,Sun Jul 19 03:56:41 2015 UTC,"The things that plagued Kemp so far were his one abysmal month and his thing with being a poor outfielder half the time, the latter of which honestly irks me more. In my crazy Jekyll-and-Hyde dream world, I'd consider moving him to the infield, but now would not be the time to do so. As long as he makes offense, the face of our franchise should hopefully help us find our stride again.  C'mon Matt, give me a reason to buy your jersey! Lol"
Padres,3dsvaq,milkchococurry,2,Sun Jul 19 07:20:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised, he is our guy now."

Also (at least from what I saw) not many Rockies fans, or at least not vocal ones, that was nice.

Padres,3dsvr4,HeadleysHobos,3,Sun Jul 19 04:43:37 2015 UTC,I didn't see any where I was sitting either. Lots of vocal Pads fans :)
Padres,3dsvr4,toferkris,5,Sun Jul 19 05:42:23 2015 UTC,"11 games until the Trade Deadline. I'm thinking the Pads have to go 7-4, 8-3 minimum to not become full-on sellers."

Padres,3drze8,I_are_facepalm,3,Sun Jul 19 02:23:34 2015 UTC,And then effortlessly hit a double into the gap with said dick.
Padres,3drze8,Beer-tick,6,Sun Jul 19 02:29:36 2015 UTC,Is Brett Wallace a terminator? Gets a pinch hit and no emotion.

Padres,3drze8,Strike3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:01:44 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced Benoit should remain as our setup guy.  He makes me damn nervous every time he pitches.  Edit- and he works sooooooo slooooooooooow.  He is the real world example of why we need a pitch clock in baseball.

Padres,3dqtky,TedDenslow,13,Sat Jul 18 15:49:59 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why anyone gives a shit about Buster Olney's opinion.
Padres,3dqtky,SnowmanOlaf,10,Sat Jul 18 18:52:41 2015 UTC,"""A rival evaluator""  He won't be moved, I guarantee it."
Padres,3dqtky,Padreschargers7,4,Sat Jul 18 19:09:42 2015 UTC,Only way it happens is if Melvin goes with him and we get some very high level prospects.  But it ain't happening.
Padres,3dqtky,buminatrain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:04:28 2015 UTC,"If anyone, I see us trading Upton, Kimbrel, and/or Norris."
Padres,3dqtky,AbideMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"I don't see Norris at all. He is under team control. Unless we are in contention by the deadline, which I think will happen, everyone whose contract runs out is gone. Kimbrel will be traded if there is a good enough offer."
Padres,3dqtky,Padreschargers7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:48:50 2015 UTC,I almost didn't even say Norris. But with the way Hedges has performed I wouldn't be surprised if Preller took a good offer if it came around.
Padres,3dqtky,AbideMan,2,Sun Jul 19 01:51:46 2015 UTC,Hedges isn't supposed to be up yet. When FedEx comes back he is getting sent down.
Padres,3dqtky,Padreschargers7,8,Sun Jul 19 02:04:05 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Man... I'm a big Shields fan. His drive and competitiveness is awesome and he's our Ace. It would suck on a personal level for BGJ as well I'm sure because he signed with us believing we are a team that wants him and the team wants to win now only to be traded to another team who might make the playoffs. I'm fearing this deadline but excited for it as well.  Edit: Whoops, BGJ!"

Padres,3dqtky,JOE619,2,Sat Jul 18 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad I didn't purchase one of those ""Rockstar GM"" tshirts."
Padres,3dqtky,Sbtoby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"For real though. Keeping the faith though!  ""One mistake does not unBased make."""
Padres,3dqtky,simboisland,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:24 2015 UTC,"yea, i'm not buying it.  First, Shields doesn't have a ton of value right now, coupled with the fact that he has a big, back loaded contract, and he's 33.  So moving him would basically be a salary dump, meaning we're getting nothing meaningful in return.  The team isn't really hemorrhaging money, so I don't think they're looking for pure salary dumps.  I think they're going to shuffle the deck a bit, but I think it's going to be moving secondary pieces for prospects, and maybe a pending FA for a MLB player (think Lester-for-Cepedes last year).  They're not going to blow up the team for 3 reasons: one, some of the pieces are basically unmovable (Melvin Upton, Kemp), two,  fetch too low of a return to be worth it (Middlebrooks, Alonso) or three, are cheap and team controlled, and therefore have no need to move (Norris, Myers, Quack, etc).  The team isn't really materially different if someone like Benoit or Venable gets moved, so they don't really qualify a 'blowing up the team'.  Kennedy is enticing, but he hasn't exactly been a stud, and unless Morrow, JJ, Kelly or Luebke is ready to step into the rotation, I'm not really sure how they would replace him (unless he brought a MLB pitcher back)."
Padres,3dqtky,anoff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"Damn, Shields has become my favorite player on the team for sure. I feel like we wouldnt get enough in return to warrant dealing him, and his contract isnt all that bad..idk though"
Padres,3dqtky,thebluedylan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:09 2015 UTC,This guy has a four-year contract. That alone is reason enough not to trade him unless some team is prepared to gut their farm system for him.
Padres,3dqtky,Foozartron,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"This is like the Redsox saying, 90% Chance the Yankees Trade CC. This means absolutely nothing. Buster Olney is just trying to get clicks/follows."

Padres,3dqtky,OBEYthesky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think they blow it up, but move some big money and refill the lower levels."
Padres,3dqtky,JolIyJack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"Hope we get something decent in return. Preller might just want to offload the salary though. Unfortunate that nobody is going to want Melvin or Kemp's contracts, we're really stuck with those."
Padres,3dqtky,Sane_Wicked,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"This doesn't mean we can't contend, this year or next. Depending on what returns we get (major league ready or not), those prospects are likely to be solid contributors. I would have been nice to have Ross or Hahn to shore up the spot, but Morrow should be coming back soon and OD is there as usual."

Padres,3dogbt,Clint_Swift,0,Sat Jul 18 02:55:18 2015 UTC,These downvoters don't realize that Kemp isn't all that. He's been like that all year... especially after Puig took a lot of his playing time last year in LA.
Padres,3dogbt,JasonKesler,2,Sat Jul 18 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"He's not. Even when he makes a good read he doesn't have the speed to get there. He puts a lot of effort in and I appreciate that. Hopefully his bat gets hot enough for me to overlook the defense. Also, He has a fucking cannon. No denying that"

Padres,3dp2jz,PsychicWarElephant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:46:45 2015 UTC,"People use ""Injury prone"" to describe some players far too often because it's applied broadly. Luebke is the epitome of it. He deserves the title."

Padres,3dn8te,hopatista,15,Fri Jul 17 17:25:07 2015 UTC,It's the same feeling of disappointment from Amazon Prime Day all over again.
Padres,3dn8te,afierro616,7,Fri Jul 17 17:35:53 2015 UTC,I think it's classy.
Padres,3dn8te,Beerbongbeau,5,Fri Jul 17 17:34:41 2015 UTC,WOW! /u/grimfindlookbehind called it!
Padres,3dn8te,Dladd12,9,Fri Jul 17 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"I like it. Simple, yet shows flashes of San Diego with the palm trees and the arch, which looks like the Gaslamp Sign. Interesting to see yellow."
Padres,3dn8te,JanitorOfSanDiego,11,Fri Jul 17 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but it's too simple to me. There are palm trees and an arch. It doesn't scream San Diego to me."
Padres,3dn8te,imperialslough,3,Fri Jul 17 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but palm trees aren't even native to San Diego. Might as well have put in Eucalyptus.   (yes, technically there is a palm native to the deserts, but not city San Diego)."
Padres,3dn8te,FriarFanatic,3,Fri Jul 17 17:39:32 2015 UTC,"If you look around the City, I don't think it needs to be native to San Diego to represent it... there are a freaking metric ass ton of them."
Padres,3dn8te,imperialslough,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:16 2015 UTC,This is valid and I realize that San Diego is often identified with this non-native plant. I am just looking to nitpick as a result of my disappointment.
Padres,3dn8te,FriarFanatic,5,Fri Jul 17 21:08:30 2015 UTC,I am just looking to nitpick as a result of my disappointment.   Talk about valid.  Can't blame ya there man.
Padres,3dn8te,Dladd12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, but they're what most people think of when they picture San Diego and it's beaches. I definitely get your point, it's all imagery."
Padres,3dn8te,MrDL104,3,Fri Jul 17 23:57:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that looks NOTHING like the Gaslamp Sign, besides the fact that it's an arch."
Padres,3dn8te,twinsfan94,6,Fri Jul 17 22:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yea I bet you guys are gonna get new uniforms by next year. The Twins added gold to their color scheme after gold was incorporated in the 2014 All Star Game logo, and we got new uniforms the next year."
Padres,3dn8te,JanitorOfSanDiego,5,Fri Jul 17 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"Well I guess that's kinda good, but that just means it'll take longer if we are ever to go back to brown."
Padres,3dn8te,twinsfan94,7,Fri Jul 17 17:36:10 2015 UTC,So is then a common opinion that brown Padres were the best Padres?
Padres,3dn8te,violaxcore,3,Fri Jul 17 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"Its a sizable vocal minority, but i think most of the local fanbase is ambivalent.  Theres also a small contingent that wants the pcl colors of white, red, and blue because we should look like the dodgers?"
Padres,3dn8te,espo619,8,Fri Jul 17 17:44:33 2015 UTC,You forgot the contingent that prefers the 1990s Mets color scheme unis.
Padres,3dn8te,gstutz176,4,Fri Jul 17 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"I am one of those.  I think a lot of it has to do with what you grew up seeing.  I associate the best padres years during the 90s but I was born in 1989 and never really saw the brown.  Therefore I don't associate the brown to the ""glory years"" with the padres quite like the navy and orange."
Padres,3dn8te,thebluedylan,3,Fri Jul 17 22:50:22 2015 UTC,yes
Padres,3dn8te,bossgalaga,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:05 2015 UTC,It strikes me that the primary colors are blue and gold (yellow) in a year the Chargers may leave -- especially if that's reflected in new uniforms...
Padres,3dn8te,SnowmanOlaf,10,Fri Jul 17 18:12:37 2015 UTC,wheres the brown
Padres,3dn8te,imperialslough,3,Fri Jul 17 17:31:23 2015 UTC,That is the question

Padres,3dn8te,padsboltssaints15,4,Fri Jul 17 19:52:35 2015 UTC,I love it. Fight me.
Padres,3dn8te,barshikins,5,Fri Jul 17 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"Looks similar to Charger's colors, so they are unifying the team color scheme with the team who is burning bridges and leaving San Diego."

Padres,3dn8te,JanitorOfSanDiego,2,Fri Jul 17 19:00:39 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/E58C6Or.gif  I wanted something special. And brown.

Padres,3dn8te,MantaMako,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:06 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I kinda agree with the people who say that it doesn't represent San Diego enough. I thought the Coronado bridge would've made an appearance."
Padres,3dn8te,enginedown,4,Sat Jul 18 03:49:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it was possible but they actually found a way to make it more boring than our current designs.  Also, are we blue and yellow now? lol  ALSO, anyone notice they used the same ""enlarged ends"" font as our road uniforms.... from 3 years ago? Jesus fucking christ this logo sucks."
Padres,3dn8te,FriarFanatic,3,Fri Jul 17 17:59:48 2015 UTC,"Well, let's be fair, we have not seen the uniforms yet. I imagine they will be blue and yellow, but hopefully there will be a little more personality than we currently have, and that would be a step forward... Not brown, but a step forward non the less."
Padres,3dn8te,Skeptical_Romulan,2,Fri Jul 17 18:20:49 2015 UTC,I actually really like the blue and yellow color scheme except for the fact that now we'll look like the Nashville Predators...
Padres,3dn8te,MrDL104,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:27 2015 UTC,Damnit. Being a Padres fan is so depressing.   This is weak. Boring. Not representative of SD or the Padres. Who thinks up this shit?
Padres,3dn8te,anoff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"would've been cool to use the 'SD' logo as the 'S' in Star, really brand it around the team.  I'm guessing MLB would've vetoed it though"

Padres,3dn8te,mrtylerb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:51:26 2015 UTC,What if the blue is representative of today's Padres and the yellow is hinting towards a change back to the brown and yellow? Or they'll look just like the Chargers next year... Who knows.
Padres,3dn8te,ClayJay751,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:18:56 2015 UTC,This is weak shit.
Padres,3dn8te,espo619,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:03:49 2015 UTC,Dumb.  But at least maybe that sand/yellow/wtf hints that they're adding a bit more character to the unis next year.

Padres,3doc14,tvreruns,5,Sat Jul 18 00:01:12 2015 UTC,Some are better than others. I'd prefer a scheme that is unique though. Navy blue and grey and navy blue and white is a bit too bland and common...
Padres,3doc14,BobTaco,4,Fri Jul 17 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"This. I dont care what color we are, just as long as we arent extremely similar to half of the rest of the teams."
Padres,3doc14,Beer-tick,4,Sat Jul 18 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so pretty bad is how most of us feel. The team has no continuity with the identity and the changes are not usually for the better."
Padres,3doc14,imperialslough,3,Fri Jul 17 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"On one hand I think it's kind of cool that the Padres constantly change their colors and identity. On the other, we haven't looked cool in about 20 years."

Padres,3doc14,violaxcore,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:28:32 2015 UTC,I made a post about our identity. If you go to our games it looks like we don't have a lot of fans at our games if you really don't know our uniforms from old to new. We don't have a real identity. Even if we go back to brown which I'm for I don't see a lot of fans buying the new jerseys until we are consistently winning.
Padres,3doc14,betonthis1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:56:41 2015 UTC,Imo. It's annoying. The team has no identity except us faithful rallying around the brown.

Check out the top of the western metal building too!  But really I usually stay in my seat and enjoy the game :)
Padres,3dlpyc,thatsricci,2,Fri Jul 17 08:13:16 2015 UTC,"I love the Western Metal building so much, I plan on going through it thoroughly. We haven't bought our tickets yet because we're not sure if a person is coming or not and my aunt said that there's always plenty of tickets available, but we're planning on being on the top deck somewhere, probably on the first base side."

Padres,3dj5ov,espo619,16,Thu Jul 16 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"The first comment there after the article hits the nail on the head-  ""Great read, can't believe he had the balls to say 'the tragedy is that Preller didn't have to do anything.' Shows he has no clue what has gone on at all with this organization the last decade and a half."""
Padres,3dj5ov,tyndall_blue,3,Thu Jul 16 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"seriously. if he'd come in, dumpster-dived like the previous GMs, and won 78? 80? games, missed the playoffs like normal...would anyone have even noticed?"
Padres,3dj5ov,krucz36,13,Fri Jul 17 07:56:37 2015 UTC,"The thing that really gets me about this whole thing is, this is probably the worst case scenario from the FO perspective.   EVERYONE gambles in baseball!! AJ took a chance yes, a dang good one in most cases (Kemp was in some respects the biggest gamble, and most expensive). If all of these guys just hit for their career avgs the Padres would be in a much better spot. The fact is these guys just haven't produced, is that Preller's fault? NO! He acquired guys that had a track record of success, they just haven't lived up to it.   That's the fact of the matter. At the end of the day, Preller did what was needed to get the franchise some real life. Did he make 100% foolproof moves, no he didn't but Hindsight is 20/20. For once we can't complain that the Padres are pinching pennies and aren't putting a AAA product out there. These owners care and they want to win as much as the rest of us."
Padres,3dj5ov,rowbearski,9,Thu Jul 16 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you had told me 1 or 2 years ago that the problem with the Padres is ""the pitching is not holding up, and the Matt Kemp/Justin Upton/Craig Kimbrel deals might have been a bit compromising for our farm system,"" I'd shit my pants, and probably be OK with our new problems after I had cleaned my pants and had some time to think about it.  On the flip side, if you had told me ""the new ownership group had a win-now mentality, fired Bud Black midseason after a bad Dodgers series, and the team has been a tire fire ever since"", well...that part sounds a bit more credible to 2013-me."
Padres,3dj5ov,rowbearski,4,Thu Jul 16 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you on both points.   To think that we would have made moves to get those guys was unthinkable a few years ago. That's what I think the Ownership group realized, they wanted to show the fans that, ""Hey we get it guys, we know in the past things have sucked and we want to change that"". They did something totally different.   On the other hand, the team has been a total mess since that Atlanta series. I honestly believe Buddy lost a lot of the guys after that series. That was really the make or break point for the team. If  Cashner comes back and drills a Brave that next inning, I think it brings the guys closer together and they have a rallying point.   That didn't happen and I think guys let that get to them. I think that for as much as some people don't like Shields, he brings an abrasive, ""Hey get it done!"" attitude that probably hasn't been there since Buddy was manager. I guarantee you that if Shields was pitching he would have hit a batter regardless of what Buddy told him and it's impact on the bullpen."
Padres,3dj5ov,Maxwell69,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:36 2015 UTC,We went 2-2 in Atlanta and I totally didn't get the vibe you did from it. At that point we were 6-4 in the last 10 games.
Padres,3dj5ov,b4sunryze,7,Thu Jul 16 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"I think the Grantland article should be posted all around Padres clubhouse, dugout, and in the Front Office. Prove the haters wrong and light a fire under the team's butts.  Cashner said the team was playing the best ball they've played all year heading into the ASG. Let's reel off some wins and right this ship.  Also, if Preller blows this up. I wouldn't want anyone but him - you know he'd be aggressive and that alone would make it exciting.  I'm also curious what the farm system will look like after a few more Preller led drafts."
Padres,3dj5ov,anoff,4,Thu Jul 16 20:48:24 2015 UTC,Haha like in Major League

Padres,3dj5ov,TheFake_,8,Thu Jul 16 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"There was a blurb on MLBTR this morning about the article, basically criticizing how it was not only a bit harsh, but how it fails to acknowledge the inherit unpredictably of  baseball.  I'm not sure anyone thought Maybin would have a OPS+ of 115, not after 4 years, nearly 400 games and almost 1,500 PAs of an 89 OPS+ with the Padres (and, let's not forget, he might just be a sample size hero, and regress over the second half)"
Padres,3dj5ov,pick6and1,3,Thu Jul 16 22:41:39 2015 UTC,I think that is the general view among most baseball minds that the article did have some points but was also unfair.  Keith Law was another one who I saw say as much and he was one of the more outspoken critics of some of Preller's early moves.
Padres,3dj5ov,krucz36,5,Fri Jul 17 01:01:24 2015 UTC,Has everyone given up already...we got a lot of baseball left.
Padres,3dj5ov,pick6and1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"but we don't have some key guys under control, and if this season looks like a close-but-no-cigar year, they have to get something for dudes who will walk after the season."
Padres,3dj5ov,CockTipAmputee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:58:38 2015 UTC,Upton is pretty much the only one.
Padres,3dj5ov,og_sandiego,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think both articles are correct, in the end you can paint either side with the facts. Either he took a dumb gamble given what we gave up and it hasn't worked out, or he took a smart gamble given the history of the organization and it hasn't worked out.    This team could just as easily be 49-41 as it is 41-49. I don't think we would've been any better than that if we hadn't made the deals, and I don't know that we wouldn't have been worse either."
Padres,3dj5ov,MrDL104,2,Thu Jul 16 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"Or maybe he’s going to return to his roots, rebuilding the organization through a focus on prospects and development in hopes to turn things around for good by the end of the decade   Had to make an argument for that point when we traded away the 13th and 41st picks in this years draft.    Other than that, good points.  AJ was trying and struck out on some moves.  Time will tell - but I do love the Norris trade although I liked Hahn a lot.  And Maurer from the Mariners for Seth was a good deal too.  But IMO we got fleeced by LA, and that's never good intra-division.  GOPADRE - we can still turn this around as J Up said today on espn"
Padres,3dj5ov,krucz36,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we also got Shields and Kimbrel (I think, maybe one of those was Upton) for those 13th and 41st picks. I'll take that any day of the week."

Padres,3djj25,pfjpie,15,Thu Jul 16 19:53:59 2015 UTC,"The fact that J-Up has said anything positive is a good sign. Do I think that this means we will resign him? No, but atleast he isn't out there saying the team is a mess and that he wants out."
Padres,3djj25,rowbearski,3,Thu Jul 16 20:01:39 2015 UTC,I hope we get surprised and he does sign. Oh I wish....
Padres,3djj25,Steameffekt,6,Thu Jul 16 20:11:23 2015 UTC,I hope we keep Justin Upton. I think he could be a franchise staple if he stays. Id rather not trade him and try our luck on him in the free agent.
Padres,3djj25,Steameffekt,3,Thu Jul 16 20:28:12 2015 UTC,"To add, I hope we keep Venable as well however, we just have too many damn outfielders. Someone's gotta go."
Padres,3djj25,tyndall_blue,4,Thu Jul 16 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"I think a best case for our roster (while healthy) looks like:  LF - Upton  CF - Venable  RF - Kemp  3rd - Alonso  SS - Barmes  2nd - Spangy  1st - Myers  C - Norris  Bench - Melvin, Solarte, Gyorko, Hedges, Amarista  Solid mix of lefties and righties with a good amount of speed and a better defensive look. Maybe I'm just overly optimistic still but I'd like to see what that kind of consistent lineup can do...  edit - this is all assuming we don't firesale and we can bring back upton, who I would 100% be okay with emptying the bank for"
Padres,3djj25,WarrenFCKINGHarding,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"See, that's actually a lineup I can get behind on. I just wish Murph would do the same."

Padres,3djj25,milkchococurry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:27:42 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. A lot of contracts are ending this coming year. I think the Pads are on the hook for $58M for next season right now IIRC, so re-signing a number of these players like J-Up is very possible.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong on that number btw, but that's what I remember hearing."
Padres,3djj25,HeadleysHobos,7,Sun Jul 19 07:27:48 2015 UTC,"Through the Ups and downs of this season, I've noticed that at the very least Upton at least looks like he really cares. Nice to see."
Padres,3djj25,BobTaco,3,Thu Jul 16 21:02:13 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Glad he likes it in SD...considering the circumstances...and the fact everyone new on the team isn't used to losing...  J. Upton is the shit. Hope he can find a way to stay. SD needs a player like him badly.

Padres,3djj25,anoff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:03:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe we can swing a 3 way deal with Upton and Cash, with Upton going to NYM, Cash going to MIL, and we get Segura and Gomez, with the Mets sending prospects to MIL.  Maybe it takes some $ or a prospect or two to balance, but who says no to this deal?"
Padres,3djj25,JolIyJack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"Mets don't seem likely to be able to extend Upton and they'd have to give up something pretty substantial to pry that package away from Milwaukee. I think Cashner's value is not much, particularly to a non-contending team. I think the Padres are the only ones saying yes in that scenario."
Padres,3djj25,anoff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:31:50 2015 UTC,"The Mets have expressed interest in Upton already, and Cashner is cheap and team controllable for another season and half.  It really depends on what the Mets are willing to part with, how money moves around and what second tier prospects get involved."
Padres,3djj25,JolIyJack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"They've expressed interest but he's a rental, which means his value is certainly lower than Gomez. The Brewers have no use for a short term asset like Cashner. That's the whole reason they're willing to part with Gomez. Really there's no reason why either team would find your scenario preferrable to a straight up trade sending Gomez to the Mets."
Padres,3djj25,anoff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"Cash has 1.5 years of control (plus, is eligible for a QO), so he's not exactly a rental, and MIL is trying to clear some of their middle infield glut.  The Mets need a corner OF, not a CF (they inked Legares to a long term deal before the season), and by involving the Padres, they have to give up considerably fewer assets.  Maybe the biggest hold is how relatively cheap Segura and Gomez are, so MIL doesn't feel a ton of financial pressure to move them (compared to something like the Melvin Upton deal)"
Padres,3djj25,JolIyJack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"1.5 years of control means nothing to the Brewers. Gomez has 1.5 years of control. They're not going to be competitive in 1.5 years. They do not have any use for Cashner. Gomez is better value than Upton even as a corner OF and Lagares can't hit worth a damn anyway so I'm sure his job isn't that secure. The Mets would be paying for Segura and Gomez, but they'd be getting Upton. That's a terrible deal for them."

It will be a kaleidoscope of nostalgia! Just kidding, please MLB gods, don't take that suggestion seriously. If I had to guess, staying w/ the navy blue and adding a secondary color. I'd say orange, but the Giants now OWN that color, maybe red (red, white, blue: further connecting to the military and america's finest city, i would hate this, not because i'm unpatriotic but just too many teams have this color scheme), outside guess blue/yellow, since the Chargers might be leaving town, why not (yellow is in our history too)? Lol. Honestly though, praying for a return to brown."

You’re going to have difficulty, disappointment, and discouragement. There will be times of suffering, sorrows and strikeouts. There will be times of frustration, failure, and fatigue. These are going to happen, but adversity can bring strength.” And ‘lo, they were 26-40 midway into the season, the baseball gods smiled upon their plight and gave them the power to find 70 wins in their final 89 games.

Padres,3dh4xo,espo619,2,Thu Jul 16 06:38:11 2015 UTC,"It's OK.  Best for large groups, really.  Kinda like box seats.  Bring a sweater, since you're exposed to the elements much more than you would be in most stadium seats."

Padres,3dc6ub,JasonKesler,18,Wed Jul 15 03:15:33 2015 UTC,Glad to see Upton get a hit... Sucks none of the dodgers could drive him in to score.

Padres,3dc6ub,dtrain165,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:23:57 2015 UTC,I really don't understand how you can hate on AGon.
Padres,3dc6ub,JolIyJack,6,Wed Jul 15 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"Not hate. Just despise when he shreds us alive every time. Dude threw a hissy fit over a strike call and even took to Twitter to ""prove"" himself. Matt Kemp has to be getting the worst called strikes in all of the majors. I mean it's bad how shitty his strike zone is when he's up to bat. Is it his eyes? Did he fuck the commissioners daughter ?  Adrian has no love for us so why should we for him? He's the enemy now."
Padres,3dc6ub,Snuffaluffakuss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"I like him because he contributed a huge amount to our team for years and has always seemed like a genuinely nice, upstanding guy. It's not like he turned his back on us, we traded him."
Padres,3dc6ub,JolIyJack,10,Wed Jul 15 21:18:32 2015 UTC,Save the hits for this weekend. Hopefully the break helps out. He's hitting .167 over the last 30 games.
Padres,3dc6ub,Lotuszx3,3,Wed Jul 15 03:34:47 2015 UTC,"It's something! I'll take it. Frankly, I'm just happy he got an AB."
Padres,3dc6ub,theorfo,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:02 2015 UTC,He got a nice ovation from the crowd too during the introductions.
Padres,3dc7wd,CameraInstructor,16,Wed Jul 15 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"Rub some salt in the fucking wound, huh? What a bunch of jerks. Reminds me of the Charger game against the Rams last year with the guy talking about how one of the teams was likely to be in LA soon."
Padres,3dc7wd,Leoric,11,Wed Jul 15 03:53:32 2015 UTC,"And gonzo and grandal both fail to bring him in, grandad sucks haha."
Padres,3dc7wd,Chrissun22,2,Wed Jul 15 05:45:39 2015 UTC,"Right, that's why he has 14HRs and is in the all star game."
Padres,3dc7wd,simboisland,9,Fri Jul 17 19:06:18 2015 UTC,So it's cool that grandal and Cruz used steroids but somehow voting Arod in is wrong? The double standard some people get over other positive testers is ridiculous
Padres,3dc7wd,PsychicWarElephant,2,Wed Jul 15 12:17:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on if the ""narrative"" says someone is loved or hated. A-Rod had the gall to be paid more than anyone and not deliver what people thought he should, ergo he's history's greatest monster. Yasmani was not in the national media's eye so much when he got tagged so they can shrug their shoulders and say ""Where'd this power come from?!"" Hint: probably steroids."

Padres,3db4pl,sdgrifter,7,Tue Jul 14 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"Hunter Renfroe and Jose Rondon. Renfroe because he's probably our best bat, and Rondon because, from what I've read, he sounds like a potential regular SS, which we've been crying out for for a long, long time."
Padres,3db4pl,PinkPantherParty,4,Tue Jul 14 22:32:02 2015 UTC,"Renfroe is the easy answer. Big time right-handed power potential, only a year or two away from hitting the show. Still has some plate discipline issues to iron out and the power hasn't completely translated to his playing yet, but I can see him as a future All Star if he figures things out. He had a slow start this year but his monthly splits show a steady improvement that makes me optimistic.  April: .184/.229/.263 5 BB/27 K in 83 PA  May: .255/.317/.372 8 BB/22 K in 104 PA  June: .286/.362/.536 8 BB/22 K in 94 PA  July: .368/.419/.684 4 BB/6 K in 43 PA"
Padres,3db4pl,JolIyJack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"Damn, those splits are really encouraging. I felt like Renfroe kinda dropped out of the picture for a while, but I'm glad to see that he's finding his bat. Anyone know how his fielding has been? Is he a future CF?"
Padres,3db4pl,black_krim,2,Thu Jul 16 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"After trawling through the 2015 data a bit more, I think it's worth highlighting Ruddy Giron. 18 year old Dominican SS playing in Fort Wayne this season. He's got a very solid 14.9 K%, .176 ISO, .329 BABIP so far this year despite being young for his level. Those are very positive signs - I think we'll be seeing him on some prospect lists soon enough."
Padres,3db4pl,JolIyJack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:30:57 2015 UTC,"He's cooled off a bit lately but yeah, he looks like a good one. I hope he can stick at SS."
Padres,3db4pl,pad_squad,2,Wed Jul 15 02:15:44 2015 UTC,Whatever happened to Taylor Lindsey? He seemed like a great prospect but regressed this year.
Padres,3db4pl,weavdaddy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:55:20 2015 UTC,"Not really a spot for him on the team. He's not better than Spang, and there isn't really anyone else you would send down to bring him up. He also hasn't forced us to bring him up because of his offensive production."
Padres,3db4pl,pad_squad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying to bring him up, no need to start his clock I'm just wondering what happened to him he did pretty decent in 2014 in aaa and then was in aa this year"
Padres,3db4pl,violaxcore,2,Wed Jul 15 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"Colin Rea is probably going to be the guy we see up soonest. If we trade a pitcher, I assume he'll be the first call up. He's been pretty dominant in both AA and AAA so far. Not a lot of strikeouts, but a WHIP under 1.00"
Padres,3db4pl,pad_squad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:24:30 2015 UTC,how can you say he's looked good in AAA? He's only pitched 5.1 innings and given up 6 ER. A little premature assessment.
Padres,3db4pl,violaxcore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:47:49 2015 UTC,Ah i think i looked at the long line on my phone. He should probably settle down
Padres,3db4pl,ShinichiChiba,2,Wed Jul 15 13:55:34 2015 UTC,Michael Gettys. This year hasn't gone to plan but we honestly don't have any major pieces anymore. When it is all said and done Jake Bauers is going to be the best player we got rid of out of all of these trades.
Padres,3db4pl,PsychicWarElephant,3,Wed Jul 15 02:54:15 2015 UTC,Renfroe is probably our biggest piece left. But I like this kid too.
Padres,3db4pl,ShinichiChiba,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:20:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hopefully he can make the adjustment as he moves up in the minors. Poor guy has been struggling too."
Padres,3db4pl,weavdaddy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree Trea Turner is going to be the best, I think Bauers will be a decent major leaguer. Turner just has all the tools needed to be a great player for years to come."
Padres,3db4pl,ShinichiChiba,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"Trea is turning into quite the stud! He is the safe bet, but everyone loves a good underdog!"
Padres,3db4pl,ShinichiChiba,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:00:31 2015 UTC,I'm not sure Gettys will make enough contact. Those strikeouts are out of control but he definitely has the athletic ability. I agree about Bauers. Seems like he really knew how to hit and was one of the youngest players taken in that draft.
Padres,3db4pl,TheRisingTide,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:36:14 2015 UTC,"Bauers = God. If you aren't hogging all his autographed/low numbered cards, now is the time to start! Gettys has been disappointing. His card prices were pretty high when he first hit the scene, not too sure after this season though."
Padres,3db4pl,black_krim,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:36 2015 UTC,Hard to be excited about players who will likely blossom for some other team when push comes to shove.

Padres,3db4pl,black_krim,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:43:50 2015 UTC,It's sad how conditioned we've become to think about future Padres. You think Cardinals fans are swooning over 18 year olds?
Padres,3da18q,CameraInstructor,2,Tue Jul 14 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"Technically Hedges was excluded for the same reason as Wisler. But yeah, that was kind of depressing to read, especially with all those Dodgers names.."
Padres,3da18q,JolIyJack,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:23 2015 UTC,I thought all the talk was how we still had our top 3 prospects going into the season? Or at least top 2?

Padres,3d98hr,klongbor,4,Tue Jul 14 14:20:25 2015 UTC,Sad very sad for San Diego. Who knows how it played out but we lost alot of good pieces that could have helped us win in the future..now we have close to the same record we probably would have with the same roster as last year.
Padres,3d98hr,Infamous89,3,Tue Jul 14 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"Watch out for Jake Bauers, that kid is going to be really really good. Only 19 years old and was just promoted to AA. Average AA player is 5 years older than him."
Padres,3d98hr,ShinichiChiba,2,Tue Jul 14 15:52:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really read much into this...a lot of those guys are putting up OK numbers in the very low levels, something that isn't exactly indicative of any real future success.  21% of them haven't even really played this year.  Joe Ross and Trea Turner sting a bit, but the flipside is we have Wil Myers, who not only has more upside than either of those two, but has also already proven capable of doing it a major league level.  Put another way, do you know which 2 current Padres hit for a high average and stole a bunch of bases in the minors?  Alexi Amarista and Cory Spangenburg.  So i'm not really impressed with all these 'sample size' heroes.  Be an All Star like Upton, or at least win ROY like Myers, and then we can start being upset these guys are gone.  The guys with the Braves in particular, should be looked at with a grain of salt: being moderately successful on a rebuilding team isn't really the same as performing in a pressure situation for a contender.  No where is that more evident than with the Padres pitching staff, which has regressed (withered even) under the pressure and expectations of contending."
Padres,3d98hr,anoff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:54:00 2015 UTC,Im excited for the second half. Hopefully this nice break rejuvenates the team and they come out strong. Regardless of the outcome i love this baseball team. Its brought alot great moments to me

Padres,3d3dgm,Alcohooligan,5,Mon Jul 13 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"I went to one last year. If you have a ticket you have access to the  beer fest. You cannot purchase beers with regular money, you have to purchase friar funds. When I went last you wait in a line and buy the friar funds and you can use those to purchase the beers. Just a heads up it will be pretty crowded."

Padres,3d3dgm,zyphaz,3,Mon Jul 13 06:52:59 2015 UTC,"Came in to second everything /u/pandanelson said.  I can't stress enough that you should come early.  They say first pour is at 5PM, make sure you're there at the Friar Funds booth no later than 5:01PM."
Padres,3d3dgm,Darth_Millhouse,2,Mon Jul 13 12:18:19 2015 UTC,"There are going to be people standing in line for Friar Bucks at designated ""Kiosks,"" that will take forever unless you get there early. There are also representatives walking around with iPads selling Friar Bucks. Look for them, the whole transaction is much faster and there usually is not a line. I also recommend buying two beers at a time if they have two beers you want to try, it minimizes standing in line time.  Any Friar Bucks you don't spend at Beer Fest are able to be used inside the park, but the best deal is to use them during Beer Fest. $5 ticket for 12oz of craft beer is better than what you'll pay inside the stadium.   Get there early/on time or it's not worth it. Also, if you have a beer you want to try or a favorite--don't wait. Some of the vendors were running out after an hour last time. I stood in line at Green Flash only to get about 10 people away before watching them tell everyone they ran out of West Coast IPA.  The Beer Fests later in the year are usually smoother than the first one, so hopefully they have worked out the kinks."
Padres,3d3dgm,n0teye,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"I went to the last one, it's a pretty good time but I echo those that have already mentioned to get there early. Not all tickets qualify you for the friar funds package but everyone with a ticket can get into the beerfest. They sell packages that also give you $20 worth of friar funds which is essentially 4 drinks ($5ea). If you find something you like make sure to get two at a time if you can because many of the best beers sold out before the event concluded.  There are girls standing around the beerfest area selling tickets and if you happened to get a package with friar funds included its best to either print the tickets from your e-mail or find a kiosk (there's on on the northwest side of the ballpark by the Lolita's entrance."

Gyrko is looking more like the Gyrko I wanted to see. I hope they're reaching their average so a hot streak would be better. The htting still needs to be more timely, though. The old curse with padres hitting: can't cash in on runners in scoring position."

Padres,3d4l6z,Steameffekt,6,Mon Jul 13 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"Starting to think that the biggest problem for the Padres hitters is coaching/player development throughout the organization. Just as so many pitchers come to SD and resurrect careers with the help of Basley, so many former Padres big league and minor league hitters flourish elsewhere."
Padres,3d4l6z,imperialslough,6,Mon Jul 13 15:39:21 2015 UTC,Is it time for our annual firing of the hitting coach?
Padres,3d4l6z,GaboKopiBrown,3,Mon Jul 13 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"Lol. I honestly have no clue how it works, organizationally. I imagine firing the hitting coach at the major league level is just finding a scapegoat. I meant bigger- like organizationally philosophy. I don't know how that is created, who sets it. For all I know it probably IS the major league hitting coach...My question is, how can one team consistently get so little production from draft picks and or minor leaguers traded into the the org and then have them leave and start producing with other teams?"
Padres,3d4l6z,imperialslough,2,Mon Jul 13 20:37:26 2015 UTC,That's cool and frustrating. The trend of major league AAA farm team continues. But I always liked Maybin.
Padres,3d4l6z,BobTaco,2,Mon Jul 13 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"How much of this is due to the fact that he's 1) healthy 2) getting consistent playing time?  Part of the problem of the Padres past - yonder, grandal, maybin - has been health and never really getting into a groove in san diego.   edit: not to forget that part of grandal and maybin missing time was due to PED suspensions"

Padres,3d1c8b,idioteque04,4,Sun Jul 12 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"For a Monday game, you should not have any issues. Since the Pads are playing the Giants it may be a little bit busier than normal however there will be plenty of seats. Especially since the Padres are not playing well.   It would probably be easier to buy them online and pick your seats with the interactive map, but I do not see a problem with buying tickets the day of at the ticket office. I usually sit 3rd base side, that is my preference. I think to get the ultimate experience you would want a seat where you can see the new scoreboard (which is in left field)."
Padres,3d1c8b,pandanelson,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"That's helpful, thanks very much."
Padres,3d1c8b,JasonKesler,2,Sun Jul 12 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"Pandanelson pretty much nailed it w/ the seating. Even though it's the giants, you can probably sneak down to field level. What I do is buy cheapest seats in the upper deck, and don't even go up there. The way Petco works is that you start at the bottom, and to get to the top you have to walk past the field level seats (the 100s)... so plop down in 115, 117, 119 on the first base side or 114, 116, 118 on the 3rd base side and just act like you know where your seats are. You might get bounced, but just act normal and move a few seats back or a section over. If worst comes to worst and an Usher asks you to leave, you can just switch baseline sides or go to your regular seats. Tickets like 315,316,317,318 aren't bad at all, just high up. Seats behind home plate in the upper deck (300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306) are also good, just high up. Great sightlines all over. I encourage you to use this link (http://aviewfrommyseat.com/venue/PETCO+Park/) to find accurate photos of what the view is from each level.   If you want medium price range tickets, go for the 200s. Great views from up there, tons of foul balls. Link to 207 view: http://aviewfrommyseat.com/venue/PETCO+Park/seating-chart/  Enjoy your stay and enjoy the park!"

Only Ross responded.   Wow, lol. People on the team seriously didn't like him."
Padres,3czqlm,violaxcore,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, if I received a text from a colleague asking how he can improve our relationship, I'd be a bit weirded out"
Padres,3czqlm,SnowmanOlaf,3,Mon Jul 13 17:30:34 2015 UTC,"would you have preferred a personal ""dude can i buy you a beer"" and only implying the ""so we can work on our professional relationship""? Props for Grandal for trying, I guess."
Padres,3czqlm,friarfangirl,7,Mon Jul 13 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"After he was caught with PED's I was over my excitement for him on the team. Plus the pitchers had issues with him, so I am not so upset about him being traded."
Padres,3czqlm,Maxwell69,6,Sun Jul 12 07:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not upset about him being traded, but I think the trade we chose was a pretty crappy one. We traded a young, very talented player that's still under team control for several years for an old, injury-prone, has-been outfielder with a fat contract."
Padres,3czqlm,JolIyJack,3,Sun Jul 12 15:30:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I am half a mind to agree the trade wasn't just uneven but also terrible.
Padres,3czqlm,Maxwell69,3,Sun Jul 12 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"If the team were successful, I'd agree with you. Given the team has not been successful for years, you have to question the overall atmosphere and philosophy...which may be illustrated by the way pitchers and other teammates interacted with him."
Padres,3czqlm,Maxwell69,0,Sun Jul 12 07:29:15 2015 UTC,I still would have issue with his PED use. Also the pitchers who had issue with him weren't the problem last year with the team.

Padres,3czqlm,folettary,5,Sun Jul 12 15:27:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree. He had a terrible attitude, got caught w/ PEDs, and his only redeeming factor was pitch framing. He couldn't throw out runners and allowed passed balls.   Yah the trade wasn't perfect, but Kemp is not ""old"" like people are saying. He is 30, and off to a slow start. He still has good years in him and he is showing it recently."
Padres,3czqlm,espo619,2,Sun Jul 12 18:15:16 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you, but man - Kemps play sure seems to suggest his hips are arthritic as fuck. That ain't gonna get any better."
Padres,3czqlm,JAYFL,2,Sun Jul 12 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"i don't think the hips have anything to do with it, but he seems to have a number of problems."
Padres,3czqlm,CameraInstructor,3,Sun Jul 12 22:17:11 2015 UTC,He wasn't clicking with the team so there's not a lot you can do about it. Getting him back in a good relationship with the pitchers was Blacks job and he failed there. Could've have been a factor in his firing now thinking about it.
Padres,3czqlm,FirstThings1st,2,Sun Jul 12 17:14:21 2015 UTC,Padres have fucking blown it with a lot of young players.  They give up so fast.   Anthony fucking Rizzo
Padres,3czqlm,STNbrossy,0,Sun Jul 12 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of Rizzo wasn't a bad move per say once you consider that Petco Park was the lowest park factor for home runs from lefties from 2005-2012, and second to last in 2004. It only improved once the fences were moved in for the 2013 season."

Padres,3ctrfi,MrDL104,7,Sat Jul 11 00:47:19 2015 UTC,Great in what way? Definitely hasn't shown in the on-field product.

Padres,3ctrfi,UserDrew,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:58:32 2015 UTC,Thought about this. But they saw him as expendable because of puig ethier Peterson so maybe he lost his confidence from that?

Padres,3cu6c4,TheLeeMan,3,Fri Jul 10 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"It's not what the Padres were hoping for, but it's still a more exciting situation than ""collect all the prospects, hope some of them pan out,"" which was the default for the last decade or so.   Ain't that the truth.  Also: depressing stat of the day? same record as last year at this point in the season."
Padres,3cu6c4,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:57:08 2015 UTC,So....hold all the players who could net you a return and trade......what exactly? The only substantial returns would come from Upton and Ross or Cashner
Padres,3cu6c4,Bob_D0bbs,2,Fri Jul 10 23:13:57 2015 UTC,"The point is, build the team around the pieces that you know could help you contend. Get rid of the rest. Guys like Venable, Kimbrel and Benoit are being tossed around that could still warrant some return. Kimbrel and Benoit particularly, given how desperate some playoff-contending teams can be for bullpen arms."
Padres,3cu6c4,n0teye,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:12:18 2015 UTC,I accept that the Padres are a shadow of what they were supposed to be but I still have faith that they will get it together to make a good run towards the post-season. Not saying they'll make the post season but I think it will be an exciting second half. Unquestionably the 1st half has shown some glaring holes and with a couple of key pieces added I think it should right the ship. I'm willing to have the sacrifice some of their more tradable pieces in order to make the the team better as a whole.
Padres,3cu6c4,MrDL104,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"Best outlook I've seen yet. No matter what happens, in Preller we trust."
Padres,3cu6c4,SnowmanOlaf,2,Sat Jul 11 01:14:34 2015 UTC,Keep Kimbrel.
Padres,3cu6c4,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,3,Sat Jul 11 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"He's one that could be dealt to a contender…I do know that dominant closers are hard to find, but at this point we could get a good return. Maurer could be a guy that could step into the closer role, I think he has the stuff."
Padres,3cu6c4,FirstThings1st,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:44:59 2015 UTC,I believe this is a contract year for him (right?). I say we trade him.  I have no problem platooning for a while until we develop our own closer but we need to restock.  It's absolutely killing me that we traded Trea Turner right now.

Padres,3ctjno,espo619,2,Fri Jul 10 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, WAR is a cumulative stat (it's lower in the beginning of the year than the end), so I'd imagine the 94 team would have had a higher WAR if they played a full season."

IMO"
Padres,3cuzhe,Clint_Swift,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:26:12 2015 UTC,Keep in mind Murph has also never managed at the big league level nor with most of these players. I think that warrants some slack for the odd lineups. Trying to see who fits where.
Padres,3cuzhe,n4ggs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:27:47 2015 UTC,No doubt that starting the season with  black was a huge mistake.
Padres,3cuzhe,Friar_Faithful,4,Sat Jul 11 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree with the thought that Black should have been fired before the season. The thinking was that Black had never actually had a lineup with talent in it before, so it only makes sense to see what he could do with a talented lineup. At the end of the day I don't think it mattered what manager we had this year, guys are playing awful."
Padres,3cuzhe,asarsfield,4,Sat Jul 11 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I would have liked to seen Buddy finish the year out, he's always been a second half manager."
Padres,3cuzhe,JAYFL,3,Sun Jul 12 04:34:02 2015 UTC,"As much as I disagree with the firing of black, I was mostly upset with the timing. I'll give Murph the benefit of the doubt with the recent results. I'd say it would be near impossible to turn things around without any major league exp. we gave Preller the reigns, have to let him do what he thinks best supplements his vision."

Padres,3cub5x,ClevelandBrownJunior,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:35:36 2015 UTC,His recent surgery should permanently fix the issue he was having with that wrist.
Padres,3cub5x,JAYFL,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:37:04 2015 UTC,I couldn't say it any better. Grandal basically stopped attempting to throw runners out near the end of last season because he knew he couldn't. Terrible player.
Padres,3cub5x,ayoooogalileo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"He's a great pitch framer. I guess some people mistake that for being a great defender, but he's definitely not."

Padres,3cub5x,Friard,3,Sat Jul 11 01:09:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what they've been doing with him all year...Norris comes in with a rep as a guy that wears down over the season.  And then, we have Hedges, who needs every AB he can get because he's so raw on offense.  Seems like a good opportunity to time share, keeping Norris fresh and getting Hedges some very desperately needed ABs (and let's not forget, the guy is damn near Molina on defense).  But instead, we've managed to simultaneously grind Norris into the ground by playing 9 out of 10 games AND completely stunt Hedges development by giving him around 2 ABs per week.  Dafuq :("
Padres,3cub5x,anoff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:32:03 2015 UTC,Agreed. Norris has also shown good range and quickness at first so it wouldnt be a big downgrade defensively. People underestimate how tiring playing catcher is. We need him to be productive at the plate and playing first is less of a workload.

Padres,3cub5x,Snuffaluffakuss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, why do you think Mauer or Kelley would be better as a closer than their current reliever roles? I understand they've pitched well lately, but Kimbrel has an incredible track record as a closer. There's a reason Preller wanted him."

Padres,3cub5x,JAYFL,0,Sat Jul 11 02:38:32 2015 UTC,He's been swinging for the fence every at bat for a while now.  Whole teams approach sucks right now.  If these guys just tried to put it in play they'd be hitting more line drives and getting on base at least.

Padres,3cvgkh,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:18:20 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why to be honest. I do know he did Texas Rangers TV before he got the Mets gig a couple years ago. It's probably so he has something to do when football isn't going on.
Padres,3cvgkh,commish94,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%, but unfortunately they'll have to wait till he resigns. You can't fire a legend, even if they're a shell of their former self."
Padres,3crbcc,TryMyBalut,3,Fri Jul 10 03:38:59 2015 UTC,Looking forward to one day taking the Tony Gwynn Freeway to Ted Williams Parkway.
Padres,3crbcc,MrDL104,2,Fri Jul 10 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"They need to just rename the city Tony Gwynn City.  Seriously though, they really should have renamed the 56 freeway since it becomes Ted Williams. I mean the 2 greatest baseball players to ever done a padres uni, who were good friends, it just makes so much more sense than a strip of the 15."
Padres,3ctae6,CaLyPtSo41,3,Fri Jul 10 16:28:40 2015 UTC,I saw some old 90's jerseys of his in the petco team store last time I was in it. It was the pinstriped home jersey. I don't know if you want to spend team store prices though
Padres,3ctae6,fixindsc,2,Fri Jul 10 17:10:18 2015 UTC,I'll have a look next game I go to... thank you!
Padres,3ctae6,fixindsc,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong guys, but I think the team store is open during non game days as well. You could probably just drop in and grab one."

Padres,3cr82r,needmoretape,2,Fri Jul 10 15:35:05 2015 UTC,Sounds like good news for the Padres. They could use the help of one of our starting pitchers too. Some package that brings back Mondesi would be awesome.   http://www.royalsreview.com/2015/7/9/8902391/mid-season-royals-top-45-prospects
Padres,3cr82r,JAYFL,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:22:18 2015 UTC,"They need anyone decent they can get at SS, but I would love it if they could find someone with a decent walk rate and not add more players who strike out a lot."
Padres,3cr82r,Maxwell69,2,Fri Jul 10 05:43:48 2015 UTC,I mean he is one of the top shortstop prospects in the game I would be thrilled if we could get him in a trade.
Padres,3cr82r,weavdaddy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:41:50 2015 UTC,Id trade upton for a good SS prospect and maybe a LHP starter prospect and a third player to sweeten the pot
Padres,3cr82r,Infamous89,0,Sat Jul 11 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"Why worry about Upton's inevitable departure? Just enjoy these last few games with the last competent hitting OF we'll have for a very, very long time."

Padres,3cojet,weavdaddy,6,Thu Jul 9 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything except trading Kimbrel unless we can either unload melvin also, or get a huge return.  the worst scenario is trading Kimbrel and being stuck with Melvin."
Padres,3cojet,PsychicWarElephant,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"but... but.... we rarely use Kimbrel, it's a waste. I would rather have 2 slightly above average players that in conjunction can help me win 12-15 games  and an average closer that can blow 4-8 games, than no players and  a star closer that rarely goes out and  it's is going to blow at least 2-4 games anyway,  maybe more."
Padres,3cojet,juanpapi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:29:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that that would sting, but a top-tier closer provides the least value to a struggling team and the most value to a team trying to make a run for it."
Padres,3cojet,MrDL104,0,Fri Jul 10 00:33:28 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see them move Melvin Upton and Matt Kemp since they are both terrible and grossly overpaid.  Also, barring a major turnaround, trade Justin Upton at the deadline for some talent."
Padres,3cojet,FoghornAZ,8,Fri Jul 10 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thing is that other teams do not want to trade for terrible and grossly overpaid players"
Padres,3cojet,ariguitari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:24:29 2015 UTC,"But if you do as the Braves did to Preller, tell them they can get Justin but they have to take BJ/Melvin or Kemp."
Padres,3cqkqi,Draper-Durden-619,6,Thu Jul 9 23:52:27 2015 UTC,"Tulo or Hamels are awful choices. Ideally, you get near MLB ready prospects for the cost control and talent potential. Who knows what kind of player Preller might be able to grab though."
Padres,3cqkqi,violaxcore,3,Fri Jul 10 00:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little late to add, we shouldn't bet on a playoff spot.  We could take advantage on some teams over paying for our players and balance out our lineup."
Padres,3cqkqi,JAYFL,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:17:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely understand what you're saying and agree that it's the logical route. However, I wouldn't be opposed to Preller not giving up on this season either. I think I'd be most dissapointed if we ended up doing nothing."
Padres,3cqkqi,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Fri Jul 10 00:21:26 2015 UTC,Tulo and Hammels are choices for teams that are on the brink and need someone to get them over the hump.  We are not that team.
Padres,3cqkqi,MrDL104,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"If we are buyers, it won't be a big buy like Tulo or Hamels, but I wouldn't be surprised if we trade a better player (Kemp, Kennedy, Cash, Kimbrel) for a younger talent in a situation with a lot of competition (so they're not getting proper playing time) -- maybe a middle infielder or OF."

Padres,3cmk3d,espo619,3,Thu Jul 9 02:01:47 2015 UTC,Chargers were at 1% with only a few games left a few seasons ago. It's possible!
Padres,3cmk3d,HeadleysHobos,2,Thu Jul 9 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"There's only a maybe of .500 or better. I would say don't hope for a post-season at all with how the team is, especially lately."
Padres,3cmk3d,Strike3,-5,Thu Jul 9 03:35:33 2015 UTC,"Oh please stop with the hope. Same record as last season through 87 games. Seldom, and I mean REALLY seldom, do teams suck for over half the season, then magically become great. This team just has not shown any talent. 75 games left. Need a low of probably 85 wins to make the playoffs.  The Padres going 45-30 is laughable."
Padres,3cmk3d,GoHuskies858,9,Thu Jul 9 03:35:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll just root for my team to suck.   That's a lot of fun"

If he's good then I see why Kennedy and Cashner's names are being mentioned for trade. It's hard to believe I'm saying that for a guy I've never seen pitch and who has been with the team for so long. To me he's an unproven player. May as well call up and start Ernesto Montas.

Padres,3clg37,CameraInstructor,0,Wed Jul 8 21:41:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think Murph has be given some slack considering he's never managed at the major league level or with a majority of these players.
Padres,3clg37,HeadleysHobos,3,Thu Jul 9 00:39:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like since murph took over, we've been diving closer to what our pythagorean record should be based off runs, etc.  Of course it's hard to say whether or not he has any effect on that.  Im really curious how the players feel about murphy, im sure guys that played for him may like him, but i dont know about guys like kemp, upton, and norris. His personality seems like the opposite of buddy's."
Padres,3clg37,violaxcore,4,Wed Jul 8 20:56:53 2015 UTC,I open to speculate over who those are. Last year I really think Grandal was one who didn't give any fucks.
Padres,3clg37,UserDrew,0,Wed Jul 8 21:08:41 2015 UTC,I honestly think it's guys that are used to the losing culture. I like Venable but he just seems like a card puncher who doesn't want to win. Yonder strikes out and gets heated. Venable just walks back. It's hard to tell on TV tho
Padres,3clg37,violaxcore,9,Wed Jul 8 21:16:06 2015 UTC,"Fwiw, will was our first ejection this year, and it was over balls and strikes. He's not the kind of guy to get hot headed over stuff, though i dont think that necessarily means ""losing culture."" Not to mention he's been putting up numbers as good as you'd hope from him this year, so its not like he's beem struggling"
Padres,3clg37,enginedown,13,Wed Jul 8 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, of all the players I'd call out, Venable would be the last. Dude hustles."

Padres,3clg37,anoff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was ever meant to be the long term answer.  I think the FO wasn't sold on BudBot coming into the year, and wanted someone capable waiting in the wings in case it went south.  That said, a team is hard pressed to keep a Joe Maddon-type waiting in the wings, so I don't think Murphy was ever considered to be great, but merely a capable stand in.  The argument for/against Buddy was that the team, statistically speaking, was incredibly lucky under him this season.  It might not seem it, but the team had actually outperformed (record-wise) their stats when he was canned.  The cluster luck (literally what the stat is called) can be looked at 2 ways: either he was pushing the right buttons and getting better results than the team should've based on their numbers OR he was doing a bad job, and was getting lucky, so the record was better than his performance.  Regardless, Murphy hasn't exactly brought the luck of the Irish with him, and his record shows it (7-13).  Plus, he coached at ASU, so i'll be glad he's gone.  BEAR DOWN!"
Padres,3clg37,HeadleysHobos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:01:52 2015 UTC,Blocking him from the Brewers makes me think he's a long term solution
Padres,3clg37,anoff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think of him as that veteran relief pitcher down in triple A.  He's not your first choice, and he's not going to win a cy young, but when someone is ineffective or injured, you could do a lot worse.  We blocked him from the Brewers because we knew he was a ""valuable"" depth piece, even if he wasn't necessarily starter material."

Padres,3cgklo,Maxwell69,17,Wed Jul 8 06:42:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. I see this team's inconsistency as a major issue why I don't believe they can right this season. lets be honest, they are the 11th best team in the NL (4th place in NL west 8.5 games from the lead). Their bats, starting pitching, bullpen are inconsistent. Their D makes great plays, but too many errors as well.  I support this team, and, unlike previous years, would still pay to go see them play, but I've given hope for post season in 2015. Time to retool and start thinking about 2016 and beyond."
Padres,3cgklo,surfingNerd,8,Tue Jul 7 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"The only reason why I can't be optimistic for 2016 is the fact that if they can't even be in contention this year I don't see it happening in 16, maybe 17 or 18 if they can hold onto a few pieces and the rebuilding effort works. But so far this experiment of a 2015 season is looking like a failure."

Padres,3cgklo,MySweetUsername,0,Thu Jul 9 15:27:35 2015 UTC,This team wasn'T complete from day 1. It's not about myers
Padres,3cgklo,Surgeicer,14,Fri Jul 10 10:04:07 2015 UTC,"First, I think we should all take this with a grain (block?) of salt.  This is literally the ONLY report i've heard about them actually being sellers, with almost nothing on all of the OCD hot stove sites like MLBTradeRumors.  Put another way, I've never been that impressed with 1090's coverage, period.  Second, let's pause and run down the list of all those guys, and realize what we do and don't have with each of them: -Kennedy is a serviceable mid rotation arm, but is a pending FA, isn't worth a QO (therefore, we lose him for nothing) and cost us almost nothing.  -Benoit has been hammered by LH, is old, and a bit expensive, plus a looming FA that isn't getting a QO.  Even better than the Kennedy situation, we have a number of pieces (Quack, Maurer) to step right in  -Upton: watching him every day makes it clear why this ""super star"" is on his 3rd team before his first FA contract.  He is a solid all around player, but completely disappears for stretches, and seems to only want to hit homers, which is madly frustrating because it causes him to K when all we need is a sac fly.  Beyond that though, we're not resigning; trading for Kimbrel and his worse half made that a financial impossibility.  So the options are to get a first round pick for him, or get a nice package of prospects from a desperate team (Hello, Mets calling).  Regardless of his performance this year, we get way better value trading him for a package then we do for a single draft pick.  -Cashner is the tough one, he's team controlled still, and keeps showing flashes.  But I think we sell high on him: he's crazy injury prone, and will fetch a nice return.  Maybe ship him back to the Cubs for Addison Russell so we have SS?  For all the doom and gloom talk though, long term, we're not that bad.  All those names above (plus Kelley) are the only FA we have in the next 2 years.  4 of the 5 'core' guys we got this offseason are here until at least 2018 (Norris, Myers, Middlebrooks, and for better or worse, Kemp).  And the Dodgers are giving us $18mil this year, and $3mil/yr for the remainder of the deal with Kemp, so he's not THAT expensive.  Losing all those farm hands in the offseason does sting a bit, but we'll see how many All Star games all those guys combine for in the next 3-5 years; the number will be a lot lower than you expect.  I hated to lose Trea Turner, but the fact is, until he's in the bigs, performing at a high level, he's nothing but potential.  You don't have to look very hard to find top SS prospects that couldn't do much in the majors (Profar, Baez, Lindor and Ramirez are but a few 'can't miss' SS prospects that so far, have done nothing but miss).  The fact is, we can make a number of moves that keep us competitive now, and put us in a better position in the future.  Shipping Upton out, moving Myers to LF, and platooning Venable and Upton in CF probably makes us a better overall team, and that's before you include the return for Upton.  Cash might be able net us a MLB-ready middle infielder, with only a slight drop off in the rotation (OD, Morrow, JJ, Kelly or even Maurer as possible stand ins).  I don't think we would even notice Benoit being gone, except we stop giving up 1 run leads on solo HR's by LHB."
Padres,3cgklo,anoff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:45:29 2015 UTC,"I think we still have the pitching depth to make the loss of kennedy, benoit, cash servicable. Colin Rea looks like he'll be pretty good. And some combination of Erlin, Morrow, Johnson might be okay for that 5th spot.  Relievers is a bit more sketchy, but moving out benoit should allow us to keep both vincent and quack in the majors, and both have varied from okay to solid"
Padres,3cgklo,violaxcore,9,Tue Jul 7 22:55:05 2015 UTC,Really hoping that somehow Upton stays.
Padres,3cgklo,ANON00OOMOUS,6,Tue Jul 7 21:25:37 2015 UTC,Doubt it. We need prospects and I think he'll get us a few.

Padres,3cgklo,ariguitari,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:56 2015 UTC,He's a default All-star.  Wouldn't be on the team if he wasn't a Padre. I think we can keep him but he needs to produce
Padres,3cgklo,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:50:34 2015 UTC,"Define keep him, as in this season or for years to come?"
Padres,3cgklo,weavdaddy,2,Tue Jul 7 23:26:01 2015 UTC,years to come.  it's not like he's setting the world on fire during his contract year.  he's still young too.  not even 28
Padres,3cgklo,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Tue Jul 7 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"People are expecting him to get a contract around 230~ million, if we are rebuilding there isn't really a point to doing that."
Padres,3cgklo,weavdaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Jesus, he's good but 230 million? No thanks"
Padres,3cgklo,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Tue Jul 7 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"He's young, talented the contract is going to be for a long time. That's what will make the contract be so expensive is the years not the amount."

Padres,3cgklo,polyphenus,6,Wed Jul 8 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks to the MLB.tv offer from a couple months ago I've been able to watch a LOT more Padres baseball this season than in years past. As such, I've gotten a little more familiar with this squad.   I have to say that I'll miss Kennedy, Benoit, and Upton if they indeed get traded away. I won't miss Cashner as so far this season every time I've seen him pitch he's given up some juicy hits/runs that have torpedoed that game. I know, the bats could always wake up to respond to Cashner's shelling, but it just didn't happen (at least, that I've seen).   I'm a die-hard San Diego sports fan who married out of my native San Diego, which makes me a rarity in these parts (Rockford, IL if anyone is curious). I love the Pads and I wish that this season's Cinderella story had played out according to the pre-season levels of hype. I'll still watch and support the team and I hope that the remainder of this season can end on a high note, no matter what happens with the roster.   Let's go, Padres!!!"
Padres,3cgklo,needmoretape,17,Tue Jul 7 19:30:36 2015 UTC,Cashner > Kennedy all day
Padres,3cgklo,Sane_Wicked,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yep. Rizzo is crushing, we need to squeeze whatever we can out of Cashner."
Padres,3cgklo,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Wed Jul 8 00:41:50 2015 UTC,Good thing the idiot in Russia selling knock off Upton jerseys never processed my order. Was hoping to wear it in ATL next week. This season is such a kick in the nuts
Padres,3cgklo,Snuffaluffakuss,2,Tue Jul 7 22:30:06 2015 UTC,wait....we're going back to the chop already?!!!!
Padres,3cgklo,brex2599,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"No. With the way scheduling is set up these days, a given team only visits teams outside of its division but within its league once a year."
Padres,3cgklo,CameraInstructor,15,Wed Jul 8 05:25:12 2015 UTC,"Going to get much uglier before it gets better.  This offseason has set the franchise back a good 3-4 years.  The Matt Kemp trade is beyond awful. He is a shell of a former self and clearly damaged goods when he was traded. Padres should have rejected the offer when the arthritic hips were found.   Grandal is now an all star and the Padres are stuck paying Kemp tens of millions for years to come. Unbelievable.   Trading Trea Turner was awful. I can live with shipping off Matt Wisler and Joe Ross. But I will not get over the Turner trade.  Baseball America just released their mid-season top 50 prospect list. There are zero Padres on it. 4 Dodgers (2 in the top 4). It's going to be a LONG time before this team can win the division.  Dark days are ahead, folks."
Padres,3cgklo,kermitsio,12,Tue Jul 7 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"Not to discount what you said, but I don't think the previous GMs really built up our farm system that much, or at least not in the way I think Padre fans saw it.  I believe they absolutely tried to but budget and other factors hindered them.  This offseason did far from dismantle what young prospects we had in the minors.  I thought the moves by Preller in the offseason were VERY welcome.  It didn't work, or at least has not been to this point as much as the expectations were which were ridiculous to begin with.  This is not a ""homegrown"" club like some of the NL Central clubs where they have tons of prospects in the minors just waiting for their chance.  Our minors were already fairly gutted before Preller took over."
Padres,3cgklo,violaxcore,3,Tue Jul 7 20:16:04 2015 UTC,"I think my impression of our farm system was a lot of quantity, but not a lot of quality. We had a lot of good pitchers, but none like the Mets excitement over degrom, harvey, thor for example.  As for position players, trea turner is the only one in  a long time that seems like he would turn out really, really good."
Padres,3cgklo,weavdaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:44:32 2015 UTC,There is still hope for Renfroe but I agree. Preller stacked the MLB team with players who would be here for the next 3-5 years. You don't really need a good farm system when your MLB team is extremely controllable for the long term.
Padres,3cgklo,Friard,2,Tue Jul 7 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"Dont forget Preller is an international prospect type of GM, he knows how to get farm system players. The problem was he didnt have enough major league talent which is why he made so many trades."
Padres,3cgklo,buminatrain,5,Wed Jul 8 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know that we're so far set back, we'll get pieces for Upton and whoever else we trade.  It's not as though Kennedy, Despaigne, or Cashner have been performing well anyways.  So no big loss if any of those go.    And come on you saw it, a JUpton, Myers, Kemp outfield is not viable defensively.  Myers will still be a stud with the bat and less of a liability in left.  Kemp has gone through long slumps many times in his career (this one being particularly long granted), but I think we're seeing some power return to him.  I believe he still has a decent amount of baseball in him.  Plus with a platoon in center if there is any rehab of MUpton we'll get to see a return on that hopefully.  Hopefully if we can correct our infield we should have the building blocks of a decent team well in place."
Padres,3cgklo,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Tue Jul 7 21:50:47 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, Logan White (who built the Dodgers farm) is with us."
Padres,3cgklo,kensal78,3,Tue Jul 7 21:52:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's the failure of the starting rotation, but we've had too many one run or shutout games on the offensive side. Puzzling how this lineup which had so much potential is playing like they're already out of everything. Yesterday I though Upton had just done a terrible job at stealing second - instead a botched hit and run call and Upton and Yonder getting into it? Disappointing. No sense of team in that dugout."
Padres,3cgklo,youreaturtle,3,Tue Jul 7 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"I scrolled through and Padres have lost 9 of 15 one-run games this season. At least half those losses were to ARI, COL, SFG. Win those 4 or 5 games and it's such a different story. :("
Padres,3cgklo,PolskaWonder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:27:38 2015 UTC,"Wow. That is kind of crazy. Like you said, win a few of those and you are most likely looking to stay put or buy."
Padres,3cgklo,krucz36,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"There seems to be almost no plate discipline for long, long stretches. Kemp seems to go through spells where he just hacks and hacks at balls kicking up dirt. It's maddening. I've already semi-checked-out since I can't stand the heartache."
Padres,3cgklo,BobTaco,2,Wed Jul 8 06:01:21 2015 UTC,Sounds about right.  Oh well. There's always next year.
Padres,3cgklo,TheRisingTide,2,Tue Jul 7 21:27:48 2015 UTC,"Surprised they don't want to deal Kimbrel as well. Have to imagine a top of the line closer would fetch a ton of money (and prospects, if this FO is even concerned with that)."
Padres,3cgklo,arribalospadres,2,Tue Jul 7 21:30:39 2015 UTC,Problem is that Kimbrel's era is twice that of any season dating back to 2011 and his k/bb rate has also dropped by 10-20%.
Padres,3cgklo,Northparkwizard,2,Wed Jul 8 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"Bandwagon went from ass-to-elbows, to ""HELLO IS ANYBODY HOME!?"""

Padres,3cgklo,RoyalAssassin1,2,Tue Jul 7 19:44:18 2015 UTC,Also caught the end of that segment. Real disappointing that we can't seem to turn the corner and play better than .500 ball this season. The fact that Preller is gonna save face and dump a few players to hopefully try again next year is a little bit of a joke. I too bought into the Rockstar GM and now I am just shaking my head. Still holding onto a sliver of hope but it's getting real dark ahead.
Padres,3cgklo,PMinisterOfMalaysia,22,Tue Jul 7 19:22:08 2015 UTC,You don't need to shake your head. If we could do it all over again I'd definitely approve of his moves. He did what our past GMs haven't. The fact that he's trying means he'll keep trying until he finds something that works for us.
Padres,3cgklo,jbraun04,2,Tue Jul 7 19:40:49 2015 UTC,"Preller got the pieces but they just never fit. Agreed, it was the right thing to do to finally give this team a shot at having a team actually worth something. Unfortunately it fell flat, but it was exciting to finally have something relevant go on with the Padres"
Padres,3cgklo,RoyalAssassin1,6,Tue Jul 7 19:53:25 2015 UTC,I have been a Padres fan my entire life and I hadn't been this excited for Padres season in a long time. That being said still have a lot more games to go... fingers crossed.
Padres,3cgklo,simboisland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:56:59 2015 UTC,This is exactly it. I'm very excited for what we could get at the Trade Deadline. No reason we can't get a good prospect for Upton.
Padres,3cgklo,RoyalAssassin1,2,Tue Jul 7 21:39:54 2015 UTC,All of the moves were great. I guess they didn't for see the inconsistency of the team being such a huge factor and also it didn't help that the firing of buddy black set them back a little bit. I am saying I am shaking my head in regards to being optimistic that AJ can continue to fix the situation.
Padres,3cgklo,PMinisterOfMalaysia,2,Tue Jul 7 19:48:39 2015 UTC,Why can't he fix the situation? It's not like he gets one shot to try and if it doesn't work it will never work.
Padres,3cgklo,RoyalAssassin1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"I am not saying he is COMPLETELY incapable but I don't have high hopes if his first attempt turns into a giant dumpster fire. I still have a lot of hope for my Padres. Still a lot of baseball to played this year, go Pads!"
Padres,3cgklo,HeadleysHobos,2,Tue Jul 7 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"Agree. If we had to do it all again, I would. Nobody expected Kemp to slump so hard after his monster second half of last year. Nobody expected Upton and Norris to fall into giant slumps or for the pitchers to get rocked. The plan was solid, the execution , not so much."
Padres,3cgklo,Maxwell69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:38:54 2015 UTC,The only move I really hated was Wil Myers for Tre Turner and Joe Ross. :(
Padres,3cgklo,Maxwell69,4,Wed Jul 8 06:45:23 2015 UTC,We can't even play .500 ball.
Padres,3cgklo,RoyalAssassin1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:34:32 2015 UTC,Yea exactly and it is getting a little embarrassing.
Padres,3cgklo,UserDrew,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"It's very disheartening. I do think Kennedy must go, I don't know his worth in a trade but a decent prospect would do just as well as he is. Benoit has been OK minus two melt downs in the same scenario against the same team. He's peaked and should be traded while he still has some trade value. Cashner would hurt, he hasn't been doing well but by trading him while the Cubs are loving Rizzo really makes that trade sting. Losing Upton, well, the Padres said they'd get a big name big salary player for a few years but by losing him it looks like that would be an empty promise.   Also, consider, that with the new levels of pay the Padres are still looking middle of the pack (22nd in the league) where they've typically been. So, ignoring all other factors, they're probably winning and losing at record that correlates with this. The price per win has shot up over the years and the Padres are still left, in this factor, dust."
Padres,3cgklo,weavdaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:15:43 2015 UTC,There is talk that we could force teams to take the horrible contracts of Melvin/Kemp but get nothing back by getting teams to take them.
Padres,3cgklo,herecomesjonny,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:59 2015 UTC,And why would teams even entertain taking them at this point even if we got back bubblegum those 2 have shown nothing this  season
Padres,3cgklo,weavdaddy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:31:56 2015 UTC,Because it would lower the asking price on the players that teams do want. It would basically be the same thing we did when we took Melvin in the Kimbrel deal. The asking price would have included Renfroe or Hedges if Melvin wasn't included in the deal as well.
Padres,3cgklo,herecomesjonny,2,Wed Jul 8 03:55:12 2015 UTC,"Those would be deals for the offseason. Teams at the deadline that are buying, only wanna add players that can help them down the stretch"

Padres,3cgklo,Infamous89,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"They need to just play with their AAA team and trade everyone else for prospects. I would only keep Myers,maurer,kimbrel,Alonso,hedges n maybe norris. Get some prospects or young controllable players for everyone else."
Padres,3cgklo,weavdaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is there are players that are going to be impossible to get rid of. We have to choose if we want to get decent returns for trading away players or get rid of Melvin and Kemp, which will greatly diminish any returns we can try to get."
Padres,3cgklo,Infamous89,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:29:58 2015 UTC,Id rather get rid of them and start fresh. Kemp might have potential to return to form but Upton Jr just sucks

Padres,3cif3e,elara760,10,Wed Jul 8 03:53:16 2015 UTC,The way Melvin Upton Jr. jogged to retrieve that last triple sums up our recent stench of losing. I would really love to be as excited for this team as the Pittsburg announcer is for his.

Padres,3cif3e,brex2599,3,Wed Jul 8 04:15:15 2015 UTC,Your lineup except switch Alonso and Norris. Don't want the two lefties back-to-back and Norris is faster than Alonso.
Padres,3cif3e,kensal78,2,Wed Jul 8 05:16:25 2015 UTC,A split at St. Louis. If we get 1 of 3 at Pittsburgh it won't be an awful two series. The issue is we're beating ourselves with errors and hit batsman.

Padres,3cdndg,FriarBot,10,Tue Jul 7 02:29:37 2015 UTC,Kemp blew it hard in a pivotal point. That shit is getting old.
Padres,3cdndg,LifeandLimb,2,Tue Jul 7 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"He is expanding his own strike zone as they say. He's been doing it for so a large part of the season, it's now the given strategy when he's at the plate. Because he hasn't changed, he's only giving opposing pitchers more reason to throw low to him. He'll try to pick a ball out of the dirt like Phil Michelson in a sand trap."
Padres,3cdndg,UserDrew,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:50:19 2015 UTC,It's getting very old. I'm thinking LA knew what they were doing with that trade.

Padres,3cdndg,gstutz176,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:58:45 2015 UTC,But it also doesn't hurt to buy more talent. I'm not saying they need to go out and trade everyone tomorrow but if it's the 31st and we are still 7 games under you have to at least think about trading some of the pending free agents.
Padres,3cdndg,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:40:52 2015 UTC,"The way Upton's been playing the last month, we can probably keep him. He's a strikeout machine"
Padres,3cdndg,gstutz176,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:10:48 2015 UTC,That's nothing new for him. He averages a strikeout a game for his career.
Padres,3cdndg,Sane_Wicked,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:41:54 2015 UTC,We really can't afford to let him walk. I think it's a foregone conclusion he gets traded. Whether or not Preller tries to get more prospects or maybe a starting shortstop is up for debate.

Padres,3cc91m,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:16:23 2015 UTC,Are the umps this bad throughout baseball or just against us? I don't watch any other teams but this is getting ridiculous!!
Padres,3cc91m,sneakAstroke,0,Mon Jul 6 23:18:16 2015 UTC,that was a strike to Kemp.  We take too many borderline pitches instead of protecting the plate
Padres,3cc91m,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:34:36 2015 UTC,Fangraphs had an article last week? We're effectively net zero on calls in favor vs. against us for both pitching and batting
Padres,3cc91m,violaxcore,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:35:29 2015 UTC,I agree we get shafted on a lot.  but i think we also need to be more agressive
Padres,3cc91m,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:40:44 2015 UTC,Do you have evidence or is that just your opinion?
Padres,3cc91m,sneakAstroke,2,Mon Jul 6 23:51:51 2015 UTC,of the strike?  pitch tracker on my app had it at a strike on the corner

Padres,3cc91m,Strike3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:58:18 2015 UTC,I wish we could hit. Then I could feel comfortable when we have great pitching like this.

Padres,3cc91m,Friard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:48:56 2015 UTC,Melvin thrown out at first. Norris swings and misses at strike 3 and it got called a foul. Singles next pitch.
Padres,3cc91m,Darth_Banal,0,Tue Jul 7 01:50:13 2015 UTC,"Burnett balked, no call, Melvin out at first. Norris struck out but Ump said it was a foul ball. Then he got a hit."

Padres,3cc91m,TeamATL10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:19:02 2015 UTC,That was clearly a balk. Horrible missed call.
Padres,3cc91m,SportsMind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:23:30 2015 UTC,Balking is not savvy. It is against the rules.
Padres,3cc91m,SportsMind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:24:44 2015 UTC,GONE! SIT THE F DOWN POLANCO!
Padres,3cc91m,T-nawtical,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:32:25 2015 UTC,Base running is straight up awful today. I get it was a balk but still
Padres,3cc91m,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:42:51 2015 UTC,"Norris at leadoff... what a head-scratcher.  Oh I miss those days of having a speedy leadoff hitter who can hit (somewhat) consistently.  In any case, GO PADRES! Win one for Shields and get him back on the W column."
Padres,3cc91m,SensationAzn04,2,Tue Jul 7 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"He really has no business leading off. You want a guy to have speed, or get on base quite a bit. He does neither this year. If they really want to get crazy, they would stick Upton at leadoff."
Padres,3cc91m,SportsMind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:06:19 2015 UTC,Justin Upton needs to remember how to baseball
Padres,3cc91m,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:11:46 2015 UTC,why melvin
Padres,3cc91m,pandajay24,4,Mon Jul 6 22:03:53 2015 UTC,Because it was a balk.
Padres,3cc91m,Padreschargers7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:52:16 2015 UTC,"It may have been, but he's been doing that pickoff attempt for years and as far as I know, he's never been called for a balk. The thing with balks, is they are subjective, and if a pitcher does the same thing every time, umps won't call it a balk."

Padres,3cc91m,Padreschargers7,2,Tue Jul 7 02:15:15 2015 UTC,Probably about that not being a foul. Don't think he's bitching about the balk
Padres,3cc91m,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:34:32 2015 UTC,True
Padres,3cc91m,Padreschargers7,2,Tue Jul 7 01:42:43 2015 UTC,Jerry Meals called an obvious strike as a foul tip which would have ended the inning.
Padres,3cc91m,kmhokies35,-2,Tue Jul 7 01:44:31 2015 UTC,That wasn't a great play to keep it out of left field. It was an ok play and a pathetic throw. Fucking pathetic infield defense
Padres,3cc91m,SportsMind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:45:33 2015 UTC,It took a terrible bounce off the lip of the grass. Shit happens. Game isn't over.

Padres,3cc91m,UserDrew,4,Tue Jul 7 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"2 more games in the series, fuck off sir."
Padres,3c9pui,T-nawtical,8,Mon Jul 6 04:58:46 2015 UTC,Tony Gwynn was the shit. Got creamed in World Series twice. The Padres have never pitched a no-no. Our eras of baseball are defined by the jersey colors rather than the records. Late 80s and early 90s were amazing though. It is a frustrating history for a lot of it because Padres basically functioned as a farm for other teams.  There were a couple good seasons after 98. It's been depressing since...I forget. At least 10 years. With one good season sprinkled in somehow.
Padres,3c9pui,BobTaco,5,Mon Jul 6 09:45:24 2015 UTC,"The Cardinals have eliminated the Padres from the post season more than any other team? The Padres were so bad once the owner apologized over the stadium PA? I dunno.  I was there to see this guy|do this to tie this.  I also saw Bonds go yard from a pitch by a reliever named Clay Hensley in August to tie Hank Aaron at Petco.   Best players? That's hard to say. A lot of good players have come through the Padres. Gary Sheffield, Fred McGriff, Andy Benes in the first half of the 90s.  Jack Clark, Roberto Alomar as well. High tier players in the 80s? Benito Santiago, came up with San Diego and was a ROY and several times an allstar. Steve Garvey, Dave Dravecky (not top tier but had a few good Padre Years), Oddly John Kruk (who wasn't known until after his Padre years, go figure) Bruce Bochy. Bochy is a ""meh"" player, but he'll be a Giants Hall-of-Famer. Ozzie Smith came up in San Diego in 1978-1981 before becoming a major player for the Cardinals. Though talking about curses is fun, it's not a ""curse"" to lose players who become greater after being traded and happens to all teams.  In the 70s the Padres had Dave Winfield (he's in the HOF as a Padre but only because Selig was an asshole and his absolute best years were in NY). My dad went to college with him. Other notable 70s players: Gaylord Perry, Randy Jones, Rollie Fingers. Fingers has more of an Atheltics heritage, however. Gaylord Perry spent most of his time as a Giant and then was frequently traded. He earned a Cy Young award, his second, as a Padre in '78. Gene Richards was a B, B+ player as well who spent most of his short career as a Padre. Post prime Willie McCovy was a Padre as well. And first big name player Nate Colbert in 1969-75ish. I think there is some debate over whether or not his number deserves retiring."
Padres,3c9pui,UserDrew,2,Mon Jul 6 08:11:35 2015 UTC,"I dont recall any debate about Colbert's number. The debate is about steve garvey who played most of his years as a dodger, sees himself as a dodger, but hit a cool homerun for us once"
Padres,3c9pui,violaxcore,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:10:35 2015 UTC,Right. I got them mixed up.
Padres,3c9pui,UserDrew,2,Mon Jul 6 16:12:57 2015 UTC,"I also saw Bonds go yard on a reliever named Clay Hensley in August to tie Hank Aaron at Petco.   I was at the game prior, wearing a t-shirt with a huge asterisk on it.  Got to yell ""Barr-roid!"" at the top of my lungs.  Made some SF fans a little salty.  It was glorious.  Also let's not forget the time that someone threw a syringe at Bonds."
Padres,3c9pui,espo619,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"Haha that moment was precious. I saw it on TV. ""BARROIDS"" caught on quickly, best way to irritate a Giants fan to date."
Padres,3c9pui,UserDrew,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:04:38 2015 UTC,I was at the game where Bonds tied it as well. Pretty cool to be there but fuck Barry.
Padres,3c9pui,OBEYthesky,5,Mon Jul 6 22:34:03 2015 UTC,"People get hung up on the steroids, but the late-'90s Padres had a lot of excellent players. Ken Caminiti, Greg Vaughn, Steve Finley, Kevin Brown, Wally Joyner, Andy Ashby, and Reggie Sanders are some of the best players that came through the team in that time period. Believe it or not, this team once had a legitimately powerful lineup. But I guess back then everyone had a powerful lineup.     In the following years, some of the Padres top contributors included Brian Lawrence, Brian Giles, Mark Loretta, Phil Nevin, Ryan Klesko, Mark Kotsay, and of course Jake Peavy. Also we had an elderly Greg Maddux for a little while, that was cool.     After Peavy went away and eventually found his long-term residence on the White Sox DL, it basically became the Adrian Gonzalez show. He was the best thing (sometimes the only thing) this team had for a number of years until free agency came knocking. The biggest bright spots the Padres had besides AGon were probably Chase Headley and Mat Latos (both traded later, justifiably). Our calling card in those years was our bullpen - even post-Hoffman, the Padres always seemed to pull together one of the best bullpens in the league without spending much money on it. Now we have a closer making 8 digits a year and a setup guy getting close to that. Not sure what to think of it.     The Padres have typically drafted and developed players pretty poorly, or just been unlucky, depending on how you want to look at it. There are only a few high Padres draft picks that have done anything at the MLB level this season. Unfortunately, they're all doing it for other teams - Logan Forsythe with the Rays, Joe Ross with the Nationals, and Jace Peterson with the Braves. C'est la vie."
Padres,3c9pui,JolIyJack,7,Tue Jul 7 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"Well, we were really good the year before you were born."

Padres,3c9pui,Clint_Swift,11,Mon Jul 6 06:44:00 2015 UTC,No no no you got it all wrong.  1999 was when I started FOLLOWING baseball.  I was born in '95.  So don't go putting that evil on me.
Padres,3c9pui,Clint_Swift,8,Mon Jul 6 06:48:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, then in that case I'll go fuck myself.  You're free to go."
Padres,3c9pui,UserDrew,5,Mon Jul 6 06:49:48 2015 UTC,In 1994 Tony Gwynn had the highest BA and probably could've been the first player since Ted Williams to hit .400 if they played the last week of the season. He finished .394.
Padres,3c9pui,Clint_Swift,3,Mon Jul 6 08:12:03 2015 UTC,But I didn't start following baseball when I was a newborn :c  I was born in '95. Then in '96 the Padres won the NL West. So...

Padres,3c8uls,betonthis1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:00:04 2015 UTC,Our fan base is horrible in getting active. It's like getting people to vote for anything that actually matters and they still don't participate. So frustrating!
Padres,3c8uls,runhigher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:04:57 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it's dependent on the team's success. The fans got Chris Young into the All Star Game from the final vote in 2007 when we were on pace to go to the playoffs for a 3rd straight year.
Padres,3c8uls,violaxcore,0,Tue Jul 7 00:55:30 2015 UTC,Probably doesnt help that he hit sub .200 in june
Padres,3c8uls,Kyletastic21,0,Mon Jul 6 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, wasn't he around 5th for a couple weeks?  That said, I cannot recall the last time the Padres were even this high in voting. He's also been struggling for a while now."

Padres,3c88vo,luv1138,4,Sun Jul 5 21:52:36 2015 UTC,Highlight: Kemp's RBI not a sacrifice.
Padres,3c88vo,Strike3,3,Sun Jul 5 20:49:44 2015 UTC,Anemic hitting against good pitching results in even weaker hitting. Hopefully Norris and Upton will be all rested and hot for the next series.
Padres,3c88vo,UserDrew,2,Sun Jul 5 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"A split against the team with the best record in baseball? And making it close in the other two losses? I'm totally okay with that. Wasn't expecting that to happen at all so, great. I really hope we can sweep or take the series against the Pirates/Rangers. We need all the wins and confidence we can get before heading into the All-Star break.  Go Pads!"

Padres,3c7jjj,herecomesjonny,3,Sun Jul 5 19:09:32 2015 UTC,That was a good move from Austin to go talk to the pitcher just to give the ump a rest after he got hit in the face mask.

My ""Ire"" goes where it belongs. IPK is a fastball pitcher who pitches at 91 mph. His fastball has no movement and his location is bad. The offense is perfectly fine, if it wasnt for a gold glove play by Wong the Padres would have 3 runs. But nah keep peddling your ""the offense is bad"" rhetoric since thats your thing."
Padres,3c7jjj,Friard,5,Sun Jul 5 20:03:30 2015 UTC,Based on what we've seen from our rotation all season no way in hell im gonna complain about 3 runs in 6 innings on the road against one of the best teams in baseball struggling offense or not.
Padres,3c7jjj,megustanlosyogapants,-1,Sun Jul 5 20:08:12 2015 UTC,The pitching staff has improved immensely. IPK is giving up hard hits to below average players. Just use your eyes he is not pitching well. If you want this team to improve they need solid production 1-5

Padres,3c7jjj,carmen_electralytes,2,Sun Jul 5 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how the Cardinals, every single year, seem to produce a useful position player from their farm system, while over the last 2 decades, the padres have only managed to produce Kalil Greene, Chase Headley, Jedd Gyorko and Will Venable (maybe Josh Barfield?).  Not exactly a star studded cast.  How is it that we are just that terrible at developing talent?  We seem to draft decent guys, seeing how they manage to produce elsewhere, but the production in a padres' uniform is almost always abysmal.  It's something that has persisted across owners and GMs, and I just don't get how we can be that consistently bad at it"
Padres,3c7jjj,anoff,3,Sun Jul 5 19:51:36 2015 UTC,I really like Spangenberg.
Padres,3c7jjj,Maxwell69,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"I like him too, but he was a first round draft pick (10th overall), that the org projected as a utility man, so you kind of hope he'd be better than that.

Padres,3c7jjj,JOE619,3,Sun Jul 5 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"You people are idiots if it wasnt for a gold glove play by Wong the Padres would have 3 runs. The offense is fine, the cardinals pitching staff is ridiculus, its why they have 53 wins with an average offense."
Padres,3c7jjj,Friard,4,Sun Jul 5 20:15:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. The negativity is getting a little insane. I think that's the main reason why game thread participation has gone way down.

Padres,3c4yq7,Mafun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:59:11 2015 UTC,It all came down to that line drive by Solarte that tipped off Martinez's glove and by a stroke of luck went right to Wang for the line drive double play. We got two more hits in a row after that which could have produced a couple of runs that inning.
Padres,3c4yq7,jedisloth,3,Sun Jul 5 02:33:45 2015 UTC,Tough loss to swallow. Cheers to taking the series tomorrow.

Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,3,Sat Jul 4 20:19:29 2015 UTC,Amarista continues to be my least favorite player.
Padres,3c42ey,folettary,3,Sat Jul 4 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, and Maurer looks freaking good. Damn it, Amarista."
Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,3,Sat Jul 4 20:42:28 2015 UTC,Maurer is a stud. Amarista has saved games in the past but this one's on him if we can't pull it out.
Padres,3c42ey,nahlakhai,2,Sat Jul 4 20:44:03 2015 UTC,No excuse for missing an easy groundball like that no matter how many games you have saved :/
Padres,3c42ey,folettary,3,Sat Jul 4 20:46:39 2015 UTC,alexi....blowing ANOTHER game. dude wouldnt be starting anywhere else
Padres,3c42ey,Snuffaluffakuss,3,Sat Jul 4 20:50:33 2015 UTC,Clutch Kemp time

Padres,3c42ey,couchmeister,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:47:13 2015 UTC,No I just meant if people think these uniforms are bad kind of controversial
Padres,3c42ey,T-nawtical,2,Sat Jul 4 20:08:17 2015 UTC,I don't like Melvin leading things off. Hope I'm wrong and he pulls some magic this game.
Padres,3c42ey,Steameffekt,2,Sat Jul 4 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"he's been better at drawing walks than a lot of our other players, and he's 3rd of our position players in terms of pitchers per PA (3.9) after Brett Wallace and Justin Upton. Of course, he also has trouble hitting."
Padres,3c42ey,violaxcore,2,Sat Jul 4 17:31:09 2015 UTC,THERE WE GO YANNY!!!

Padres,3c42ey,couchmeister,2,Sat Jul 4 19:03:34 2015 UTC,I've been loving Yan recently. Dude was busting it around the bases after the dinger. I love it
Padres,3c42ey,ImNotTheChris,2,Sat Jul 4 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah he always hustles, even on walks. I love it too."

Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,2,Sat Jul 4 19:39:53 2015 UTC,That double play hurt us ):

Padres,3c42ey,JanitorOfSanDiego,2,Sat Jul 4 19:58:05 2015 UTC,Just ordered my Mateo jersey
Padres,3c42ey,Holden_Caulfiend,2,Sat Jul 4 20:09:59 2015 UTC,I love how Murph is handling the staff lately. Not afraid to pull his starters and he clearly has trust in his guys. Mateo was his closer in El Paso.
Padres,3c42ey,HeadleysHobos,2,Sat Jul 4 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"FACK is right, Yonder ):"
Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,2,Sat Jul 4 20:24:27 2015 UTC,It feels weird to like Kelley after how much we used to despise him
Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:27:19 2015 UTC,Him and Gyorko.
Padres,3c42ey,Leoric,2,Sat Jul 4 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"Nice inning Kelley, now let's hit a home run and crush the dreams of the best fans in baseball"
Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,2,Sat Jul 4 20:31:32 2015 UTC,plz bby don't b like dat
Padres,3c42ey,ReturnOf_TheHack,3,Sat Jul 4 20:32:11 2015 UTC,A double and a single?
Padres,3c42ey,JanitorOfSanDiego,2,Sat Jul 4 20:33:14 2015 UTC,Those two errors just cost us the fucking game.... Ugh
Padres,3c42ey,Steameffekt,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:42:32 2015 UTC,We haven't lost yet.
Padres,3c42ey,JanitorOfSanDiego,2,Sat Jul 4 20:44:14 2015 UTC,I wonder how many games we have lost because of bad defense.
Padres,3c42ey,folettary,2,Sat Jul 4 20:42:53 2015 UTC,Well this ones all on Amarista now.
Padres,3c42ey,Strike3,2,Sat Jul 4 20:43:00 2015 UTC,Can we please turn this around? THIS IS GONNA BE OUR 40TH COME ON PADS
Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,2,Sat Jul 4 20:46:33 2015 UTC,REDEEM YOURSELF!
Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,2,Sat Jul 4 20:48:47 2015 UTC,Time to redeem yourself ninja  EDIT: k I guess not
Padres,3c42ey,TheLeeMan,2,Sat Jul 4 20:49:34 2015 UTC,TAKE US TO THE PROMISED LAND KEMP
Padres,3c42ey,carmen_electralytes,2,Sat Jul 4 20:50:36 2015 UTC,Fucking amarista.. so disappointing
Padres,3c42ey,thebluedylan,2,Sat Jul 4 20:52:52 2015 UTC,I AM UPSET WITH THAT OUTCOME.  unearned runs are the devil's food.
Padres,3c42ey,friarfangirl,2,Sat Jul 4 20:53:49 2015 UTC,Preller HAS to be looking for a SS right now. Unacceptable to lose a game like that.
Padres,3c42ey,folettary,2,Sat Jul 4 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"Every stat tells me we should lose this game.  However, the Gyrk and Venable are hot and Despaigne has been throwing well.  While Solarte has been are rock.  If we can knock out the starter early, we can make it three wins in a row and gain some ground on the division."
Padres,3c42ey,your_power_is_mind,2,Sat Jul 4 16:21:37 2015 UTC,Knock out the starter to get to the best bullpen in the mlb?

Padres,3c42ey,strudelalec,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:44:58 2015 UTC,Good reaction by Molina - but - Upton jr had a terrible jump and an even worse slide. Molina double clutched and threw off the bag and was still able to get him. Disappointing by Melvin.
Padres,3c42ey,kensal78,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:52:34 2015 UTC,I really don't want to see Melvin Upton in the lineup anymore..
Padres,3c42ey,ItAllEndsSomeday,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:23:50 2015 UTC,Well unless we somehow can give him away in a trade get used to him...he will..at least...be the rh side of a cf platoon for the foreseeable future
Padres,3c42ey,Bob_D0bbs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:24:48 2015 UTC,Was his contract apart of the deal too? Would make him incredibly difficult to move I would imagine...

Padres,3c42ey,Bob_D0bbs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:32:54 2015 UTC,Ouch...and I just filled up on Brats...
Padres,3c42ey,ItAllEndsSomeday,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:42:25 2015 UTC,Gotta play him in hopes he catches a spark so we can hopefully trade him

Padres,3c42ey,Snuffaluffakuss,0,Sat Jul 4 20:00:11 2015 UTC,Don't hate on Alexi. I've seen him make tons of game saving plays in the past.
Padres,3c42ey,JOE619,0,Sat Jul 4 20:42:55 2015 UTC,Let's take this series for the lulz!  I'm honestly a bit concerned though.
Padres,3c42ey,BobTaco,0,Sat Jul 4 17:00:33 2015 UTC,Plz anyone but Mateo.
Padres,3c42ey,JanitorOfSanDiego,4,Sat Jul 4 20:00:42 2015 UTC,Would rather have Mateo than Garces
Padres,3c42ey,pandajay24,6,Sat Jul 4 20:02:30 2015 UTC,Garces < Mateo < Amarista.
Padres,3c42ey,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Sat Jul 4 20:03:52 2015 UTC,HOW BOUT NEITHER
Padres,3c42ey,Snuffaluffakuss,0,Sat Jul 4 20:03:07 2015 UTC,Huge ass momentum killer.
Padres,3c42ey,JOE619,-3,Sat Jul 4 20:56:02 2015 UTC,Who the fuck is Mateo?
Padres,3c2cne,Mordkay,6,Sat Jul 4 02:54:27 2015 UTC,I knew he would carry us to the promised land.  Easter is here bitches!!! (Biblically speaking of course)
Padres,3c2cne,Clint_Swift,9,Sat Jul 4 04:59:48 2015 UTC,And you fuckers were so damn happy when he was sent to AAA
Padres,3c2cne,AbideMan,19,Sat Jul 4 02:55:03 2015 UTC,If he has turned the corner it is likely because he was sent to AAA.
Padres,3c2cne,jedisloth,7,Sat Jul 4 02:59:20 2015 UTC,That was more aimed at the perspective that he is a shitty player rather than he needed a turn around.
Padres,3c2cne,AbideMan,4,Sat Jul 4 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I always believed in Jedd if it is any consolation."
Padres,3c2cne,jedisloth,5,Sat Jul 4 03:04:26 2015 UTC,Same. He's a solid player all around and a decent dude.
Padres,3c2cne,AbideMan,4,Sat Jul 4 03:07:34 2015 UTC,I'm always surprised at the plays that he makes. He's easily the most surprisingly athletic person I've seen in a while.   He just looks too...doughy to move that fast. But he do.
Padres,3c2cne,Hiazm,5,Sat Jul 4 14:32:47 2015 UTC,Serving up some hot and steamy RBIs!
Padres,3c2cne,BobTaco,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:28:45 2015 UTC,I read that as ribbies.
Padres,3c2cne,your_power_is_mind,3,Sat Jul 4 15:58:59 2015 UTC,Good for him. Hopefully he found something he was missing when he was sent down. He seems a lot more confident now at least.
Padres,3c2cne,EnervateYou,3,Sat Jul 4 03:35:44 2015 UTC,He oviously wasnt going to down there for long. Your not paying your starting basemen 5m a year to hit in the minors
Padres,3c2cne,Infamous89,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"Happy for him, that was a big win last night!"
Padres,3c29pk,jedisloth,11,Sat Jul 4 02:24:46 2015 UTC,I was thinking that I haven't been pissed at him for awhile.  Glad he's pitching well.    Kimbrel's been solid as well. 0.63 in last 14.1 innings
Padres,3c29pk,SnowmanOlaf,5,Sat Jul 4 02:33:45 2015 UTC,"That is pretty dominant, and he has a very strong 21 SO in 14.2 innings as well."
Padres,3c29pk,Friard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:37:26 2015 UTC,"Maurer, Kelley, Benoit, Kimbrel could be our go-to Bullpen  mateo, quack, garces providing depth  Thayer on DL. Vincent and Luebke in AAA with Luebke possibly replacing Garces as LOOGY  Considering that last year the go-to bullpen was Thayer, Vincent, Quack, Benoit. Preller has done a good job stocking the bullpen with good depth and top end talent."
Padres,3c29pk,pad_squad,0,Sat Jul 4 05:09:58 2015 UTC,I think luebke is more than just a loogy I think he'll be more long relief
Padres,3c29pk,Infamous89,3,Sat Jul 4 06:43:29 2015 UTC,Bullpen and starting pitching is starting to live it up just in time for summer. Cmon Upton Brothers bring on the funk
Padres,3c29pk,duano_dude,2,Sat Jul 4 03:29:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's the haircut. Earlier this season he was being interviewed by Mark Grant and was asked about the mohawk he was sporting. Shawn deferred on answering the question, and only alluded to his starting off the season poorly, and needing to change things up to get on track. I think that was around the time he started having a better season. ... Mohawks for the whole rotation!"
Padres,3c29pk,Makuta,-2,Sat Jul 4 15:51:41 2015 UTC,"452 OPS, that is shit..."
Padres,3c2cpj,FriarBot,21,Sat Jul 4 02:54:58 2015 UTC,God damn these last two night have been satisfying. If we end up getting our first sweep of the season against St. Louis then I officially don't get baseball.
Padres,3c2cpj,AbideMan,7,Sat Jul 4 02:56:10 2015 UTC,Didn't we sweep Colorado already?
Padres,3c2cpj,buminatrain,8,Sat Jul 4 03:29:25 2015 UTC,Yes

Padres,3c2cpj,buminatrain,12,Sat Jul 4 03:39:12 2015 UTC,I assumed and looked up nothing. I'll take my downvotes
Padres,3c2cpj,Go_Home_Please,2,Sat Jul 4 04:02:17 2015 UTC,I'll give you some upvotes for that attitude.
Padres,3c2cpj,buminatrain,4,Sat Jul 4 04:05:07 2015 UTC,"I suggest preparing for officially not getting baseball, we are gonna sweep them!"

Padres,3c2cpj,padsboltssaints15,2,Sat Jul 4 03:57:11 2015 UTC,"I stopped getting it a long time ago. There's what's on paper and what happens on the field. Mark Grant said it last night ""It's the best reality show there is."" Stats only tell us what has happened so far and only give us a weak idea of what can happen into the future.  We make predictions, calculations, follow fundamentals, but we can never actually see the outcome. The moment the ball is out of a pitcher's glove to the moment the play ends any sort of chaotic thing could happen and we never really know until it's already occurred."

Padres,3c2cpj,brex2599,3,Sat Jul 4 06:29:20 2015 UTC,What is happening. Nice to see him NOT hit into another damn double play
Padres,3c2cpj,Stockholm_Syndrome,8,Sat Jul 4 03:42:40 2015 UTC,Padres are now the best team in baseball.
Padres,3c2cpj,JanitorOfSanDiego,7,Sat Jul 4 02:55:59 2015 UTC,Look at us. We're the best team now.

Padres,3c2cpj,LifeandLimb,7,Sat Jul 4 02:57:44 2015 UTC,Another solid win against one of the best teams in baseball right now. Go Padres!!
Padres,3c2cpj,V92131,6,Sat Jul 4 02:55:25 2015 UTC,I don't know what to say. I'm just here for the party. Feels good man.
Padres,3c2cpj,EnervateYou,5,Sat Jul 4 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"Gyorko and Solarte came up clutch. Great win.  Also, great recovery by Benoit after hitting the lead-off hitter and great pitching by Cashner"
Padres,3c2cpj,TheLeeMan,4,Sat Jul 4 02:57:43 2015 UTC,Upton struggling has been very frustrating. These next two games would be perfect for him to break loose.
Padres,3c2cpj,LifeandLimb,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"Ya I edited out my Upton slump part of my comment, but ya it has been frustrating."
Padres,3c2cpj,TheLeeMan,6,Sat Jul 4 03:11:06 2015 UTC,"I think this is the first time I give the ""Hero"" gold star to Gyrko this season. What we saw of him tonight, he looked more like the guy who got the big contract in 2013. At the of that year I thought we were going to have a .260/.330/.440 20hr type guy and since coming back up he physically looks a bit more like he has that potential. I still think he deserves to be held on formal probation, though.   I'm, and I'm sure everyone else, is happy to see Cashner have a good start. He didn't seem to be pitching for strike outs, he seemed more relaxed and mechanically sound. He didn't get the win, but threw eggs on the faces of the people in the shit talker's thread. From here, I hope he continues to be a stable pitcher. A mainsail of the starting rotation."
Padres,3c2cpj,UserDrew,4,Sat Jul 4 03:40:42 2015 UTC,Not gonna lie. Once i saw we were going to play the Cards I thought we were going to get rocked. Looks like our pitching might be getting good again.

Padres,3c2cpj,thebluedylan,2,Sat Jul 4 03:07:10 2015 UTC,Fucks aren't even that satisfying.
Padres,3c2cpj,LifeandLimb,2,Sat Jul 4 03:23:02 2015 UTC,GOD DAMMIT I AM SO FUCKING PUMPED!!
Padres,3c2cpj,LifeandLimb,2,Sat Jul 4 02:56:58 2015 UTC,The cardinals announcers talked constantly about how spacious Petco is and what a pitchers park it is. Seemed like there were a few hard hits tonite that would have left Petco Park yet somehow stayed in-play at Busch Stadium.
Padres,3c2cpj,Friard,4,Sat Jul 4 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"Radio or Television? On TV the Cards announcers were very generous, I felt like they were constantly talking the Padres up and had so many great things to say about Cashner and his mother. I really appreciated it."
Padres,3c2cpj,LifeandLimb,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:02:12 2015 UTC,"Not saying it was anything negative, they were just suprised how many home runs the Padres had given up considering how quality the rotation and bullpen are. Overall it was a great broadcast, but Busch actully plays bigger than Petco Park in my opinion."
Padres,3c2cpj,Friard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"I believe there's some speculation that the new scoreboard has created some sort of unexpected negative pressure air system in the park contributing to the offense this year.  Couple that with shortened fences and the high total square footage of Petco there's an argument to be made that we now have a hitters park.   However the Cards announcers are I'm sure basing their opinions on their past 13 years (roughly) experience with the park, and their opinions are completely accurate to what they've known here during that time.  If the dynamic at Petco really has changed it will take a few years to lose it's pitchers park reputation"
Padres,3c2cpj,buminatrain,2,Sat Jul 4 03:22:21 2015 UTC,"Yea for sure, i think the new surrounding buildings have changed things as well."
Padres,3c2cpj,Friard,-1,Sat Jul 4 03:34:59 2015 UTC,Idk who the Cards radio guy is but dear god he sounds like he was halfway in a coma. Sounded so bored. He also tried laughing and saying Cashner was an insanely slow pitcher and it was causing the defenders behind him to relax and that was why he leads the league in unearned runs. Tool.

Padres,3c1nyt,Friard,2,Sat Jul 4 01:00:50 2015 UTC,Ever play baseball? Sometimes you just go for the ball because that's what you're conditioned to do.
Padres,3c1nyt,UserDrew,0,Sat Jul 4 01:47:53 2015 UTC,Ever play pro baseball? Me neither. They are conditioned to know which plays are makeable and which are not. Falling into the first base line in front of a runner is not a play a pro should make.

Padres,3by6rw,kegman83,7,Fri Jul 3 04:20:06 2015 UTC,KELLEY 2 scoreless innings NORRIS game saving dive  VENABLE GW Homer  GG
Padres,3by6rw,Friard,7,Fri Jul 3 03:25:34 2015 UTC,"Just checked over at BrooksBaseball.com and in Upton's last 4 AB, Bob Davidson called 5 strikes that were actually balls.    Cooney had 7 balls (not touching a corner of the zone) called as strikes. Socolovich had 1 ball called as a strike. Choate had 1 ball called as a strike. Rosenthal had 2 balls called as a strike. Villaneuva had 2 balls called as a strike.    In total they had 13 balls called as a strike, and only 15 real strikes called as a strike. 13 of 28 called strikes were actually balls. That is insane."
Padres,3by6rw,SportsMind,5,Fri Jul 3 05:20:12 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Socolovich was worse because after that mound meeting he threw nothing but balls to the next 2 batters. The first pitch to each was a ball called strike. Both struck out...and I don't think they both went down swinging. That's around the time when Mudcat started to actually get angry at the strike zone. Unless it was Villaneuva...I don't really know anymore. The extra innings are messing with me
Padres,3by6rw,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 05:33:55 2015 UTC,"As far as technically bad calls go for Padres pitching:   Ross 8 strikes (2 pretty far out), 4 balls (2 right on the edge, 2 right in the middle of the zone) Maurer's zone was fine Benoit 4 strikes outside, 1 ball on the edge Kelley's zone was fine.  Kimbrel's zone was fine.   So over the course of the game, we had 12 extra strikes, but 5 extra balls.  Hedges appears to be an excellent framer this year in a small sample size. Yadier Molina has been historically good, though less so the past couple years."

Padres,3by6rw,Leoric,3,Fri Jul 3 04:16:55 2015 UTC,"What does everyone think the difference was that gave us the win? Whatever it what, I want more."
Padres,3by6rw,Mcspam,6,Fri Jul 3 03:24:16 2015 UTC,Maybe not the defining difference but 5 scoreless innings from the pen was  clutch. Pitched out of some huge spots.
Padres,3by6rw,HeadleysHobos,3,Fri Jul 3 04:03:47 2015 UTC,Clutch hitting capitalizing on mistakes! Hedges taking that 0-2 for a single is perfect example. Normally we just foul off those leaking fastballs or hanging curves. Today Hedges and Venable both took advantage!
Padres,3by6rw,pandajay24,2,Fri Jul 3 03:26:56 2015 UTC,That stop by Norris...my gosh. Totally saved the game. I was worried about him in those types of situations because it's literally nothing like catching. Good for him! Wanted a jersey...wasn't sure who to get. Norris is making a damn good case for my money.

Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 03:05:45 2015 UTC,That's a really valid point. The number of runs it allows is a far better statistic. Or at least a percentage to show how effective it really is.

I thought ""sure, maybe Barmes now looks better on average but Solarte is still a beefy hitter."" Whatever ""beefy"" means. I felt a twinge of disappointment that he hadn't hit more home runs. Worried that, with their pitching this year, 1 run would be all that the Cardinals need. But Noooooooo. Solarte on a 3-2 pitch hits a ¡¡¡GOOOOAAAALLLLL!!!."

Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,3,Fri Jul 3 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"Can't ever get too comfortable with the Cardinals, even with 2 outs, they're so good. Although y'all will win this game, good job Padres!"
Padres,3bwz5c,OneAppleBoy,3,Fri Jul 3 03:10:36 2015 UTC,FUCK YES!!!! HUGE WIN!!!! No more Bob Davidson behind the plate.
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,3,Fri Jul 3 03:11:14 2015 UTC,Based Kimbrel
Padres,3bwz5c,inevitablescape,5,Fri Jul 3 03:12:28 2015 UTC,Major stalling when Molina visited the mound. They shoulda just set up a damn coffee table up there lol
Padres,3bwz5c,JOE619,5,Fri Jul 3 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"So Wong can sprint to second after being ""hit by pitch""......lol"
Padres,3bwz5c,JOE619,4,Fri Jul 3 00:02:37 2015 UTC,That side view looked sketchy too...and he made it look like he got it in the thigh. Should have been a charliehorse...
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 00:04:59 2015 UTC,Well...I'm mentally preparing myself for a whooping this series...just in case.
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Thu Jul 2 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"I hope its like Terminator.  Keep the expectations low so we arent disappointed, then pleasantly surprised"

Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Thu Jul 2 22:53:37 2015 UTC,If Hedges gets a hit this guy is confirmed garbage.
Padres,3bwz5c,Padreschargers7,2,Thu Jul 2 23:42:06 2015 UTC,I had a dream the Padres took 3 out 4 for the series against STL. Let's hope it comes true!

Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 00:14:58 2015 UTC,Yea Hedges!!
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 00:17:21 2015 UTC,Tried to get too much from it but nice AB from Hedges. He's really starting to develop as a hitter.
Padres,3bwz5c,EnervateYou,2,Fri Jul 3 00:17:58 2015 UTC,Yea. A bit over zealous...but oh we'll.
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 00:19:24 2015 UTC,So much for an easy out!
Padres,3bwz5c,Leoric,2,Fri Jul 3 00:31:20 2015 UTC,Should have caught that...
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 00:38:25 2015 UTC,Ross has had some horrific luck this year.
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 00:48:15 2015 UTC,Only 3 HR allowed though. By far the best by the starters
Padres,3bwz5c,gstutz176,2,Fri Jul 3 00:50:52 2015 UTC,Horrific fucking strike call. Why the fuck are you running anyways with the best hitter AB.
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 00:57:55 2015 UTC,What the hell did solarte do to deserve being tossed? Yeah he yelled and threw his helmet but he never turned to the ump and did anything disrespectful

Padres,3bwz5c,couchmeister,3,Fri Jul 3 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"You technically aren't allowed to throw equipment, and he called him an asshole."
Padres,3bwz5c,Padreschargers7,2,Fri Jul 3 01:04:04 2015 UTC,Bob Davidson's ejection rate is twice as high as normal umpires. He once ejected a macot.
Padres,3bwz5c,Fargoleafy,2,Fri Jul 3 01:06:10 2015 UTC,Unreal
Padres,3bwz5c,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Fri Jul 3 01:03:51 2015 UTC,The fucking zone isn't even consistent. WTF is going on. Fucking joke.
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 01:04:35 2015 UTC,HOLY FUCKING SHIT? YOU AREN'T GONNA GIVE HIM THAT AFTER THE OTHER STRIKES. WTF
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 01:05:05 2015 UTC,95 MPH fastball for Tyson Ross  That's Hot Sauce!
Padres,3bwz5c,T-nawtical,2,Fri Jul 3 01:08:47 2015 UTC,Dang those upcoming pitchers..

Padres,3bwz5c,chrissytheblack,2,Fri Jul 3 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that was his pitch to hit. He will break out of the slump soon enough, hopefully tomorrow after the Padres win today."
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 01:50:51 2015 UTC,Archer has ruined my ability to maturely watch Joaquin pitch
Padres,3bwz5c,T-nawtical,2,Fri Jul 3 02:02:46 2015 UTC,I'm scared...
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 02:08:25 2015 UTC,Yeah...wasn't a strike but who cares!
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 02:12:08 2015 UTC,Jedd did all he could.
Padres,3bwz5c,JanitorOfSanDiego,2,Fri Jul 3 02:22:38 2015 UTC,Dicks...they walked Alonso and ruined everything.
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 02:23:03 2015 UTC,Gotta hold them here and go into extras...
Padres,3bwz5c,carmen_electralytes,2,Fri Jul 3 02:23:39 2015 UTC,Oh gosh...Kelley.
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"If you guys would take this in extras, would be much appreciated."
Padres,3bwz5c,alphadelt,2,Fri Jul 3 02:30:28 2015 UTC,Wait wtf? Norris is at first? I haven't been paying attention to game all this time..
Padres,3bwz5c,Sh1g,2,Fri Jul 3 02:30:42 2015 UTC,Dat stop by Norris...
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 02:31:53 2015 UTC,And we head into the 10th!!
Padres,3bwz5c,afierro616,2,Fri Jul 3 02:32:56 2015 UTC,This heart attack inducing game tho...
Padres,3bwz5c,EnervateYou,2,Fri Jul 3 02:32:57 2015 UTC,Wow... Thank God! Let's get a homer and end this quickly
Padres,3bwz5c,carmen_electralytes,2,Fri Jul 3 02:33:11 2015 UTC,"""That first ball was called a strike! Why are you surprised?"" Lol"
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 02:40:50 2015 UTC,"Come on Kelley, I believe in you."
Padres,3bwz5c,JanitorOfSanDiego,2,Fri Jul 3 02:47:00 2015 UTC,Hedges HR #2...please.
Padres,3bwz5c,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 3 02:55:27 2015 UTC,So I'm listening to the SD radio broadcast.   Your play-by-play announcer is.....eccentric.
Padres,3bwz5c,LtDarien,4,Fri Jul 3 02:57:50 2015 UTC,Lmao Teddy
Padres,3bwz5c,Padreschargers7,2,Fri Jul 3 03:00:47 2015 UTC,Great success!
Padres,3bwz5c,HeadleysHobos,2,Fri Jul 3 03:11:12 2015 UTC,Padres win!!

Padres,3bwz5c,pandajay24,2,Fri Jul 3 03:11:37 2015 UTC,Great win! And one last time:  Fuck Bob Davidson.
Padres,3bwz5c,hermolt,3,Fri Jul 3 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"And that's just one reason to say ""fuck the DH"""
Padres,3bwz5c,couchmeister,2,Fri Jul 3 00:32:56 2015 UTC,Rosssssssss
Padres,3bwz5c,JOE619,2,Fri Jul 3 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"Damn it, was hoping that would hit Davidson in the face."
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 01:14:30 2015 UTC,Not sure I like bringing out Maurer this early. Would've liked to see him either close or be the set up man.
Padres,3bwz5c,T-nawtical,4,Fri Jul 3 01:34:54 2015 UTC,we need to keep it as is now though.
Padres,3bwz5c,rurounijosie,3,Fri Jul 3 01:37:15 2015 UTC,Brought him in to face the middle of the order. Makes sense.
Padres,3bwz5c,SportsMind,2,Fri Jul 3 01:38:57 2015 UTC,"No way he would displace Kimbrel and despite some of the (unwarranted) hate, Benoit has been good in his role. Not a knock on Maurer, love him, but no need for a change."
Padres,3bwz5c,HeadleysHobos,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:45:50 2015 UTC,I hope Greg Garcia gets a start at 2B during the series. He went to Valhalla High out in El Cajon and is a good guy
Padres,3bwz5c,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Thu Jul 2 21:16:02 2015 UTC,Valhalla high with the all dirt baseball field out back?
Padres,3bwz5c,crimsontideftw24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:21:11 2015 UTC,"Hoping for a repeat performance from Tyson Ross' last start.

Padres,3bwz5c,gstutz176,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:40:04 2015 UTC,Well I guess that's why he didn't want to throw a fastball.

Padres,3bwz5c,pad_squad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:40:05 2015 UTC,We got a hit! And a good one at that!

Padres,3bwz5c,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:40:30 2015 UTC,I would rule that an error

Padres,3bwz5c,gstutz176,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:09:54 2015 UTC,Damn. I'd probably wear a caged hockey helmet after that.
Padres,3bwz5c,JanitorOfSanDiego,2,Fri Jul 3 00:10:50 2015 UTC,Yea Giancarlo does the same thing. Here's a link if you care to watch http://m.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/video-braves-heyward-takes-90-mph-fastball-face-article-1.1433111

Padres,3bwc7l,rpedersen1856,15,Thu Jul 2 18:10:31 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Go down with the ship...let it ride...weird stuff can happen. It's baseball.
Padres,3bwc7l,BobTaco,12,Thu Jul 2 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"even if it doesn't, at least they freaking TRIED."
Padres,3bwc7l,PsychicWarElephant,9,Thu Jul 2 19:30:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. Tried a different strategy instead of just trying nothing any hoping. It was worth a shot.
Padres,3bwc7l,BobTaco,5,Thu Jul 2 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"It paid off in that respect for me. This season has had a healthy (and the usual) dose of disappointment, but it's had a completely out of character fizz of character and possibility. I can't remember the last time I was this invested in the team without my safety net of alcohol and pessimism."
Padres,3bwc7l,friarfangirl,2,Fri Jul 3 05:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yes! If we went all out in the break to get players, why are we settling now. Just keep going. Don't sell."
Padres,3bwc7l,Mordkay,8,Fri Jul 3 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"Keep it going just for ticket sales. Unless someone calls at the trade deadline offering the house for upton, just let it ride."
Padres,3bwc7l,n4ggs,2,Thu Jul 2 19:52:37 2015 UTC,I wish I hadn't read this. I'm so depressed now. I always knew this was a real possibility but it sure was nice to have positive hype around the team after sucking for so long.
Padres,3bwc7l,FunknSD,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:16:37 2015 UTC,I'm a Giants fan but I've lived here in SD for seven years almost. It was so nice to see some hope at the start of this season in this city. I even bought quarter season tickets... :(
Padres,3bwc7l,Stockholm_Syndrome,0,Sat Jul 4 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"Don't read Dave Cameron articles.  He's been writing about how much he hates the Padres since last December.  The fact is that the pitching has been partly unlucky and partly bad.  The offense has been much better despite Kemp having an extremely bad year.  The team should be in contention, and while they gave up a couple of decent prospects in the offseason, they didn't give up anyone who was going to be a star.  Aside from all of that, it's baseball.  A team with an average level of talent can see its win total swing from about 72 to 90 just because of luck.  The Padres are better than they've looked this season.  Cameron is essentially taking every opportunity to gloat over calling a coin flip correctly."
Padres,3bwc7l,AliceTaniyama,4,Fri Jul 3 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so, I hung with assistant GM Josh Stein a week ago. He said Upton and Kennedy were gone in three weeks unless we ""really, really start winning some games.""  I'm betting Upton is a Met and Kennedy a Blue Jay by the 20th."

Padres,3bwc7l,juanpapi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"Because of how he is playing he is right now he is relatively cheap, his career numbers are much better than what he has shown this season. It would probably come down to if teams can agree on what to part with to get Kennedy. I don't think a deal will get done if Preller thinks he trading a fringe #2 starter, while the buyer things they are trading for a #4 who is having a bad season so far."
Padres,3bwc7l,weavdaddy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:52:14 2015 UTC,His ERA last month was under 3. Save for his last start he's been fairly hot.
Padres,3bwc7l,HeadleysHobos,2,Fri Jul 3 04:05:45 2015 UTC,"""in 2016, I estimate they have something like a projected +25 Wins Above Replacement in place for next year. To be a legitimate playoff contender, you need to be up closer to +35 WAR, and most teams that make the playoffs end up north of +40 WAR.""  Even this season they never had enough WAR to be a solid playoff contender. It was just close enough that if players over-performed the team could hope for a wild card spot... and for that the farm system was gutted. I think many fans didn't see this, they saw the stars on the team and expected too much from what was really there."
Padres,3bwc7l,Maxwell69,2,Thu Jul 2 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"My expectations were 'worst case scenario, our rotation and bullpen would keep us in the thing.'  Always thought it would be injuries that derail us."

It's just a place where a few game enthusiasts show off their creations.   So, I'd like to thank TNawtical, Clintswift, and Hight2Plus2 for allowing us to continue to communicate with each other without interruption."

Padres,3bz63r,TheFake_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"No one really knows for sure.  Someone with a ""source"" posted that it was because Reddit wanted to make AMAs more commercialized with things like video AMAs.  Victoria was said to be resistant to those changes.  Allegedly in response to her continued resistance to management's wishes, Reddit apparently decided to change how AMAs would be handled and eliminated her position (i.e. they aren't going to hire someone to replace her).  When you are let go in a reorganization it is generally viewed as a layoff, but considering she was the only one let go and her position was the only part of the reorganization, it was basically a firing."

Also cheap beers, $3 Busches all day every day and $5 local pints during happy hour. The food is pretentious but the nachos are decent and $5 during happy hour. The Oulde Sod a few doors down is a great Irish bar with good prices and will put the game on if they have nothing else going. If the game isn't on at either place just ask, they are cool.

Beyond that, Norris is basically irreplaceable (Hedges isn't ready, and there is no one behind him).  Kimbrel maybe has some value, but his contract is such that it doesn't make a lot of sense to move.  Venable and Solarte might be some nice bench pieces for a contender, but they're not going to fetch anything of value.  Middlebrooks isn't  really going to an upgrade for any contenders, and doesn't have the position versatility to be a bench piece.  Maybe Alonso to the Cards? But he's team controlled, BABIP fueled, and one of our few LHB worth starting."

Padres,3bs0kr,luv1138,3,Wed Jul 1 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"Mariners were favored by many to go to the World Series.  They've been disappointing, but they're a better team than us"
Padres,3bs0kr,Flesh_Lettuce,5,Wed Jul 1 22:47:48 2015 UTC,in many ways they are the Padres of the AL this year.  Picked by many to win but haven't done well.  They also had some big issues heading into the season (example- way to left handed batting order) but ultimately you are only as good as your record and theirs is worse than ours.  We should have won at least one game.  4 hits in the past 18 innings is pathetic.
Padres,3bs0kr,gstutz176,2,Wed Jul 1 22:54:09 2015 UTC,"Hardly any experts picked us to win the division, let alone the pennant.  We were projected as .500."
Padres,3bs0kr,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:57:48 2015 UTC,I didn't mean to win the world series.  I more so meant to have a winning record. edit: also how many times are experts actually right?  How many experts last year had SF vs KC in the world series?  In many ways their opinion is no better than yours.
Padres,3bs0kr,gstutz176,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:58:48 2015 UTC,"I get that, but the only people who had high expectations for the Padres were us (the fans)."
Padres,3bs0kr,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:01:44 2015 UTC,Not true at all. Plenty of writers had us as a wild card. Many others pointed out the issues but Padres were very much relevant in preseason forecasts
Padres,3bs0kr,gstutz176,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"Record shows otherwise. But I get your point, we suck at the moment"
Padres,3bs0kr,luv1138,3,Wed Jul 1 23:13:41 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine Shields having back-to-back horrible outings.  I expect a stellar pitching performance and a rejuvenating offense.  Finish strong Padres, you got this."

Padres,3bs0kr,JJ_Spicket,3,Wed Jul 1 22:48:37 2015 UTC,Serious question: is this team quitting?
Padres,3bs0kr,BeerFarts86,2,Wed Jul 1 22:43:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say quitting but they are definitely on a downward spiral.  I really am starting to question more than the manager on this staff though.  Fielding is atrocious, hitters never seem to make adjustments, and a lot of the times our shifts do not work.  Robinson Cano's two out single today is an example of this.  We play normal inning is over with no runs."
Padres,3bs0kr,gstutz176,0,Wed Jul 1 22:57:18 2015 UTC,"Murphy did today. Shields pulled way too late, Quack should have never been sent out for a 2nd inning and the 9th inning subs were bad."
Padres,3bs0kr,SportsMind,2,Wed Jul 1 22:44:26 2015 UTC,Shields after two walks and 100+ pitches is still far better than this lackluster bullpen.
Padres,3bs0kr,folettary,0,Wed Jul 1 22:46:22 2015 UTC,No it's not and you are doing your players a disservice hanging them out to dry like that.
Padres,3bs0kr,SportsMind,2,Wed Jul 1 22:49:38 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree and I think today was a perfect example.
Padres,3bs0kr,folettary,3,Wed Jul 1 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't blame AJ at all.  You can't fault the guy for taking huge risks.  He got us all excited for this team and this year.  100% of the blame is on the players.  None of them are performing.  All of them are below their career numbers.  It's still not over because the division is up for grabs, but going into St Louis on a slump is not the recipe to turn things around."
Padres,3bs0kr,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Wed Jul 1 22:53:02 2015 UTC,I agree. Every player is playing below expectations. Who thought Kimbrel would come here and be lackluster? I know people talked shit on Kemp but he played great at the end of last year and dropped off significantly in one off season. This is all on the players.
Padres,3bs0kr,folettary,4,Wed Jul 1 22:57:13 2015 UTC,We have twice as many hits AND runs as yesterday!

Padres,3bs0kr,lamada16,2,Wed Jul 1 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like if the Padres offense were hitting the balls they have hit the last two games at the Padres defense, a lot of these balls would be base hits."
Padres,3bs0kr,lamada16,2,Wed Jul 1 20:07:04 2015 UTC,"Even acknowledging his consistency issues, I miss watching Shields every five days. I shall live vicariously as a Padre for the next couple hours."
Padres,3bs0kr,AcrossTheNight,2,Wed Jul 1 20:22:33 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity are you referring to his inconsistencies this year or was he also inconsistent with you guys?
Padres,3bs0kr,gstutz176,2,Wed Jul 1 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"He was very inconsistent last year, especially in the second half of the season. He was very poor throughout the playoffs. He did eat a lot of innings though."
Padres,3bs0kr,AcrossTheNight,2,Wed Jul 1 20:53:26 2015 UTC,Yea I was aware of his struggles during the playoffs because EVERYONE talked about it during his free agency.  I just didn't watch enough Royals games to know that he was inconsistent with them.  Everything I after we got him was the anchor of the rotation.
Padres,3bs0kr,gstutz176,2,Wed Jul 1 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Welp, I was hoping that ball was going to go a bit farther than that"

Padres,3bs0kr,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Wed Jul 1 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"As bad as I couldn't stand Black earlier this year, I don't think he ever made as many mistakes as Murphy has made the last couple of games."
Padres,3bs0kr,SportsMind,4,Wed Jul 1 22:42:37 2015 UTC,"Gyroko had some good swings last night. I hope the results come today. We need Shields to rebound, and Walker has been prone to big innings. Let's put this one away early and coast to a winning homestand."

Padres,3bq26a,BobTaco,0,Wed Jul 1 07:49:24 2015 UTC,"It is not about just a run of 2 or more games dude, it about the other teams start loosing games too. We need several teams (the right ones) to start collapsing at the same time which is very very unlikely to happen.  If the second half ends up with a .550 win pct which is very good, we still end up with a .500 season, if for some reason we get a magical .600 second half, were are still at a .550 season, look at the Giants, Pirates, Cubs, and Mets, if any of these teams is capable or passing the .550 win pct, any of these teams can fire up and have a .600 second half, see what i'm trying to say?  We would have to play at the same level as the Cardinals to be able to compete and to be honest i don't see how that could be possible."

They are third worst averaging 8.5 strike outs per game at 22% for outs. I was happy just to see them not get no hit tonight.  Solarte gets the hero award, Kennedy gets to go home as the goat.

I dont know what it is, if players are pressing or what. The Seattle starter threw almost 50% balls tonite."

I can be pissed. This team gave up TOO MUCH to be sitting 5 games under halfway through the season.   The fact that I am pissed does not mean I am not a ""real Padre fan."" Rather, it means I understand how much we risked this season.   That is why I bother posting. I've seen enough to be convinced.

Our farm system was ranked 22nd with no star prospects. What did we really give up? Maybin? Hes a mirage. Wisler? He lasted 4 innings his last start. We got an Allstar catcher on a team-friendly contract. A shortstop hitting .290 in a league devoid of SS talent. A first baseman hitting .300+. Traded Seth Smith for a shut down RP. Signed the ace of the team that went to the world series last year. Signed The best closer in baseball. The Padres are trying to win which is more than I could say for the last decade.

Not sure where you are parking but it's always a better bet to park at a trolley station and take the trolley to / from the game as the trolley is $5 round trip and parking near the park is $15 minimum.

Padres,3bj6us,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Mon Jun 29 18:32:54 2015 UTC,I agree with most that the Rally Gorilla needs a hi-def update. I dont know why they don't play the Trevor Hoffman more since I havent seen it since the Opening Week. That one is really good.
Padres,3bj6us,betonthis1,3,Mon Jun 29 20:09:24 2015 UTC,I saw it at the most recent dodger series. That's a great one.
Padres,3bj6us,HeadleysHobos,2,Mon Jun 29 20:49:59 2015 UTC,They've played the Hoffy video at most of the games I've been to (including 3 in June).  The Rally Gorilla is lifted from a Cadburry commercial that's at least 15 years old. Hi-Def didn't exist then.
Padres,3bj6us,MrDL104,-1,Mon Jun 29 22:04:45 2015 UTC,I missed a lot of games this month unfortunately. I think they could film a new version for our screen at least.
Padres,3bj6us,betonthis1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:57:30 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand. The Padres didn't film that video. It's from a commercial made in 2007. That's kind of the point. All of the rally videos are just re-edits of popular music/ film/ tv moments.
Padres,3bj6us,MrDL104,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:07 2015 UTC,Man the video quality + phil collins definitely made me think it was much older

But then we lose and I feel disappointed and angry at myself for getting so drunkenly optimistic. It's been a long time since I emotionally invested myself this much in a Padres team, and I think that's why I'm still stoking those Fires of Faith. Having a new favorite player (Norrisaurus) definitely helps, as does my burning desire for AJ's ballsy actions to pay off so that we're not another failed ""dream team.""   Also it helps that I refuse to let myself hate anyone on my team for longer than one game. If I harbor ill will towards any players, it's just being a bad fan on my part. Staying optimistic for every new at-bat makes for a way better fan experience even if it leads to more disappointments.  Overall, I'm not following the team as religiously as I was in April, but I'm still hanging on every game and I believe we still have a great shot at the postseason. We've got a whole half of a season left and the team looks to be gradually figuring it out. 6.5 GB is a hell of a nice place to be. All it takes is one hot streak..."

I hold no hope of him being a hero. I don't think he's bad news, just old. He's been out for so long, there have been so many new players, he may not have the same abilities post-op/rehab, he's gone back to being an unknown factor. He'll be a free agent at the end of this year. Perhaps, a big perhaps, the Padres can resign him as a bargain bin pitcher with some type of performance bonus for 2016.

Padres,3bg4rh,pad_squad,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:40:07 2015 UTC,Especially sliders and some curve balls. That game showed me how much better those pitches are when it's righty vs righty or lefty vs lefty.
Padres,3bg4rh,Maxwell69,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:21:43 2015 UTC,"And he just hasn't been good against lefties which is supposed what he's here for. I wouldn't be surprised (I'd also like to see) if Luebke takes over that role when he's ready, which should not be too far off."
Padres,3bg4rh,HeadleysHobos,8,Sun Jun 28 23:27:51 2015 UTC,Messy show by the pitching was the only thing that kept us from winning. Glad our offense seems to be producing more. Doesn't matter; got the win. Let's knock two out against Seattle before we have to survive the Cards.
Padres,3bg4rh,padsboltssaints15,2,Sun Jun 28 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"Take away 3 mistake pitches and we win 4-0 and get a division series sweep at home.. Good series win though, let's finish the homestand strong"

Padres,3bg4rh,P1h3r1e3d13,3,Mon Jun 29 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"When do we get Morrow back? Sounds like Jedd ""GiDP"" Gyorko is on his way back after Middlebrooks injury today."
Padres,3bg4rh,n0teye,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:15:53 2015 UTC,"i want to say Morrow is on the 60 day DL, but I could be wrong, so we won't get him back for a bit   ok i just looked it up, he was placed on the 60 day DL to make room for Mateo but Morrow is progressing with his treatment for his shoulder"
Padres,3bg4rh,LilRomenHuhn,-1,Sun Jun 28 23:20:51 2015 UTC,First rule of /r/padres is dont talk about /r/padres. The second one is never speak ill of Gyorko lol.  I got you though.
Padres,3bg4rh,rurounijosie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:44:37 2015 UTC,So many Good HRs...for nothing. :(
Padres,3bg4rh,BobTaco,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"Not a good game, but a great series overall. Good starting pitching, besides a few HRs given up by Despaigne, and great hitting. I'm excited for us to fuck up the Mariners."
Padres,3bg4rh,Padreschargers7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:17:44 2015 UTC,Anderson was exposed all game long and the hitters we wanted to take advantage of it pretty much did. This loss rests on on the failing of Garces to get the critical out. Garces goes home the Goat.
Padres,3bg4rh,UserDrew,-1,Mon Jun 29 02:50:32 2015 UTC,OD can never figure out the dbacks it seems

Padres,3bfuig,betonthis1,6,Sun Jun 28 21:18:45 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I saw Upton whip as he was walking back into the dugout after his last night
Padres,3bfuig,HeadleysHobos,4,Sun Jun 28 22:01:39 2015 UTC,What the fuck is a whip? Lol
Padres,3bfuig,JOE619,3,Mon Jun 29 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"it looks like whip is slang for automobile, can't figure out the nae nae lol"
Padres,3bfuig,fvckinjmon3y,2,Mon Jun 29 19:19:55 2015 UTC,This is a cute version of Father Daughter doing the Whip and Nae Nae  Fixed the link the first one I added had no sound. I like this one because the girl does it right but there are a ton of these on youtube.
Padres,3bfuig,JOE619,4,Mon Jun 29 16:06:08 2015 UTC,So it's like a dance? lol I don't know this stuff.
Padres,3bfuig,JOE619,3,Mon Jun 29 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"Yes its hilarious because it's an ""Urban"" dance and Kemp immediately ran into the dugout but stopped and did the Whip and then when Norris came in from his first Homerun he did it in the dugout but obviously had the ""off-beat awkward"" look to his but just looked so funny and they were cracking up in the dugout. Love the atmosphere in the dugout."
Padres,3bfuig,MrDL104,2,Mon Jun 29 20:12:48 2015 UTC,That's awesome man. The fact that this team is struggling and the guys can still keep up that atmosphere in the dugout is fantastic.
Padres,3bf6n4,FriarBot,22,Sun Jun 28 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"Man these threads have gotten pretty dead since we started losing... Guys I think the Padres actually had a bandwagon for a while, I can't believe I'm saying that."

Padres,3bf6n4,Maxwell69,8,Sun Jun 28 20:00:41 2015 UTC,Murph has to get some credit for moving Kemp to leadoff. He looks revitalized
Padres,3bf6n4,el_conquistador22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:20:44 2015 UTC,I still don't think Buddy would have ever moved him.
Padres,3bf6n4,HeadleysHobos,3,Sun Jun 28 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"Me neither, but to be fair it's not an obvious change to make. I actually thought Kemp should've been moved down the order to 5 or 6. But Murph was able to change things up without messing with Kemp's confidence"

Padres,3bf6n4,Maxwell69,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"Actually I felt that way after we took the Angels series and went on a win streak. It was a little deflated when we lost that series against the Dodgers, and then it was crushed when they let Bud go. I still haven't really got it back yet."

Padres,3bf6n4,UserDrew,3,Sun Jun 28 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"Pulling out OD? Sure. Putting in Garces? Eh, I dunno. I'm not confident in him but I guess it was best to play the ""Lefty v Lefty"" strategy."

Good thing we have an off day tomorrow to evaluate."

Padres,3bf6n4,JOE619,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:38:57 2015 UTC,Yes! I wanted to see Pena get a run over here. Hitting .311 in El Paso
Padres,3bf6n4,Bob_D0bbs,3,Sun Jun 28 22:09:23 2015 UTC,That is not saying much in the PCL....everyone hits.... If middlebrooks misses time you have to call Gyorko back up and play him everyday
Padres,3bf6n4,JOE619,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:12:30 2015 UTC,10th best in the PCL...I just like the guy.
Padres,3bf6n4,JAYFL,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:31:03 2015 UTC,I think Gyorko is going to remain down for awhile longer. Once they call him up I feel they'd want him up for good and not be shuttling him back and forth the rest of the season. Most important thing for him now is consistent at bats.
Padres,3bf6n4,JAYFL,2,Sun Jun 28 22:40:00 2015 UTC,I've been waiting for him to get a chance as well. Another possible short stop may light a fire under our current options.
Padres,3bf6n4,HeadleysHobos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:38:16 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of Wallace at 3rd if Middlebrooks hit the DL. Also expect Gyorko to be the first one back.
Padres,3bf6n4,JAYFL,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:35:06 2015 UTC,I think a big knock on Wallace has been his fielding.
Padres,3bf6n4,HeadleysHobos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:37:19 2015 UTC,I was not aware of that. You may be right though!

Padres,3bf6n4,gstutz176,3,Sun Jun 28 21:41:20 2015 UTC,He had just hit a batter but there were two outs and he was only at 84 pitches. Lefty was up too but given hindsight we can see that didn't work out to well
Padres,3bf6n4,JOE619,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understood putting in the left hand specialist, but I think OD could've gotten out of this inning."
Padres,3bf6n4,gstutz176,2,Sun Jun 28 21:49:28 2015 UTC,Yea I was definitely surprised he was pulled given the pitch count and he seemed to have settled in
Padres,3bf6n4,CLSmooth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:51:18 2015 UTC,"He doesn't really have a true starters arm, so 84 pitches is pretty close to the most he throws, but I still would have left him in. He had put down 10 in a row before the hit batsmen and was still looking strong"

Padres,3bdka9,EnervateYou,13,Sun Jun 28 05:15:24 2015 UTC,Great game for Cashner. It's about time he got some run support and didn't give up 100 runs.
Padres,3bdka9,Leoric,11,Sun Jun 28 05:25:15 2015 UTC,Anyone else like Kemp batting lead-off?
Padres,3bdka9,Padres619,3,Sun Jun 28 05:53:17 2015 UTC,It's delivered good results so far
Padres,3bdka9,Hiazm,2,Sun Jun 28 06:08:37 2015 UTC,I like Alonso in the number 3 spot. I never would have thought of putting him there but now that he is it seems like a good place for him.

Padres,3bdka9,SdBolts4,2,Sun Jun 28 07:21:55 2015 UTC,PADRES WIN!
Padres,3bdka9,T-nawtical,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:25:49 2015 UTC,"Stat to watch: W-L involving the Dbacks with and without Bud Black. I guess I should include the Bochy years as well. On the flip side, the Melvin years, Gibson, Brenly, and Showalter years. I'll get on it eventually.   Question: When changing managers, did the specific W-L change between the teams? Does the trend indicate a different approach to earn those wins and losses all things being equal (on behalf of the managers and not the players)?   And it's not fair the Dbacks won a series after 4 seasons. The form of hate I have for this team isn't the irrational type that comes with rivalries but one fostered in envy. It's not fair. IT'S NOT FAIR. They had great players and their average guys turned good on their coat tails. Talk about a team carried on the wings of angels."
Padres,3bdka9,UserDrew,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:48:55 2015 UTC,Loved the loud Quacking at the end of the game for Quackenbush.

Padres,3bcl36,couchmeister,3,Sun Jun 28 03:53:27 2015 UTC,He got taken out on a double play break up slide and was limping around the bases later. They just announced he has a sprained left knee
Padres,3bcl36,pad_squad,2,Sun Jun 28 04:01:35 2015 UTC,Sprained knee

Padres,3bcl36,analoven,3,Sat Jun 27 23:07:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, the defense we have when Cash is pitching. There you are."
Padres,3bcl36,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Sun Jun 28 02:13:25 2015 UTC,So nice to see Cash getting some early run support.
Padres,3bcl36,JOE619,3,Sun Jun 28 02:32:29 2015 UTC,Well there goes our perfect game. We'll get em next time guys.

Padres,3bcl36,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Sun Jun 28 04:15:45 2015 UTC,So glad Cashner's getting some run support tonight. He's had a couple of ugly games but most of the losses aren't his fault.
Padres,3bcl36,sneakAstroke,3,Sun Jun 28 04:17:03 2015 UTC,Atta boy Cash. Give yourself run support.
Padres,3bcl36,analoven,3,Sun Jun 28 04:17:07 2015 UTC,Kemp is heating up!!!

Padres,3bcl36,warheart90,4,Sun Jun 28 02:14:47 2015 UTC,Imagine if Alexi hit .240.
Padres,3bcl36,Fargoleafy,4,Sun Jun 28 02:27:45 2015 UTC,"cash is throwing too hard...every game, he throws too hard, flattens out, loses his shit"

Padres,3bbx4c,JOE619,3,Sat Jun 27 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"Thought about going, but didn't want to deal with that.   I'm already a Cox customer though, so maybe I would have gotten that special treatment."
Padres,3bbx4c,SilentEngineer,2,Sat Jun 27 19:25:04 2015 UTC,The treatment was if you upgrade to a higher package or switch to cox.
Padres,3bbx4c,SilentEngineer,3,Sat Jun 27 20:00:42 2015 UTC,I wonder what they would have done if I went in and canceled my service.
Padres,3bbx4c,Hancock02,2,Sat Jun 27 20:26:33 2015 UTC,Fuck that shit. Glad I didn't go now.
Padres,3bbx4c,betonthis1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:38:28 2015 UTC,I'm wishing I didn't go lol
Padres,3bbx4c,WhatTheHorcrux,2,Sat Jun 27 20:01:13 2015 UTC,What time did you show up? How big was the crowd? And that's some BS about signing up. We have cox already but I would be mad as hell
Padres,3bbx4c,betonthis1,2,Sat Jun 27 19:44:40 2015 UTC,"I got there at 10:50, and the line was huge; it wrapped around the whole building. When we got close to the door, we were informed that it would go to 12:10, but at 12:05 they just suddenly cut off the line and told us we could still make it for an autograph if we signed up for some Cox thing."
Padres,3bbx4c,betonthis1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:57:23 2015 UTC,Anybody opt to sign up just for an autograph?
Padres,3bbx4c,betonthis1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:15:26 2015 UTC,Didn't see anybody. Pretty much everyone just walked out.
Padres,3bbx4c,BobTaco,2,Sun Jun 28 15:11:03 2015 UTC,Added some pics
Padres,3bbx4c,n4ggs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:10:16 2015 UTC,Man you we're close.
Padres,3bbx4c,glasshearthymn,2,Sat Jun 27 20:48:01 2015 UTC,Very close. I hopped out of line to take this pic and try to hand him my image but was quickly blocked by some guards.
Padres,3bbx4c,glasshearthymn,2,Sat Jun 27 21:01:22 2015 UTC,I was going to show up like 930 since it was limited to how many people they were allowing in. Tyson Ross's thing was mid week and it was a small group but we had time for a photo and got to pick one of the giveaways they had last year. More intimate but the crowds at the park show that it was going to be big crowd
Padres,3bbx4c,FunknSD,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah man I didn't expect the huge crowd. That wasn't my problem though. If I wasn't told a different time than when it actually ended, I would just blame myself for showing up late. Also one thing that really ticked me off was all the people walking out with way more than one autographed item, especially  because the people running it were repeating the ""1 item only"" rule 100 times."
Padres,3bbx4c,CameraInstructor,2,Sat Jun 27 21:38:00 2015 UTC,Dude that sucks
Padres,3bblhq,i-need-approval,3,Sat Jun 27 17:39:44 2015 UTC,search through the sub. this question has been asked a few other times. park at the park will be relatively easy to find and you should bring in some burritos from Lolitas because fries and carne asada go great in a tortilla
Padres,3bblhq,PMinisterOfMalaysia,2,Sat Jun 27 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"This! Bring in food to save cash or get yourself a huge plate of food at Phil's BBQ in the park, best deal in the park for a plate big enough to split."
Padres,3bblhq,LifeandLimb,4,Sat Jun 27 22:56:45 2015 UTC,Park in the park is the big grassy area behind the scoreboard
Padres,3bblhq,Friard,3,Sat Jun 27 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we could create a sticky or sidebar thread that has some basic Petco Pro Tips e.g. where to buy cheap tickets, where to buy the best food, where to take kids, transportation & parking tips etc.  /u/Clint_Swift  /u/T-nawtical   edit: ahem. i should read the wiki."
Padres,3bblhq,friarfangirl,2,Sat Jun 27 19:20:05 2015 UTC,We have a FAQ wiki that everybody could edit.  The problem is that nobody ever updates it(myself included)  When I have a day off I will certainly look into making that shizz top notch.

Padres,3bblhq,pad_squad,2,Sat Jun 27 19:23:45 2015 UTC,Get your kid signed up for Compadres Kids to do it get in line early it will be the corner of the grass area closest to the Tony Gwynn statue.
Padres,3bblhq,betonthis1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"Kidfest is tomorrow so they will have a few jumpers set up in the park as well as face painting and balloon animals, all for free with your ticket. Get there early and wear your kid out before the game starts."
Padres,3bblhq,FunknSD,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:39:30 2015 UTC,Cool thank you. And the players will sign for them also?
Padres,3bblhq,FunknSD,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:26:23 2015 UTC,I've never personally seen autograph signings in the park before a game. Maybe if you get there really early. I'm usually there only 1-2 hours before first pitch.
Padres,3b9rsq,Maxwell69,8,Sat Jun 27 03:42:17 2015 UTC,"I saw him at that Spring Training.  I didn't care about Garth Brooks.  My dad and I were trying to walk around the complex when we hit the Garth Brooks sea of fans.  We were about in the middle of the pack. His security guard split my dad and I to make a walk way for Brooks.  The fans were nuts.  Then, a moment later, Garth was walking right past me.  I got caught up in the moment.  I acted like a school girl for a second.  I reached out and in a broken voice said, ""Garth.""  Then the moment past and the shame kicked in.  I felt really stupid for losing it.  I got caught in the crowd and swept up in the excitement around him.  He really was a good guy there.  He signed as many autographs as possible.  He was respectful to the game, players, and fans.  I believe he donated $250,000 dollars.  I'm not exactly a fan of his music, but think he is a stand up guy."
Padres,3b9rsq,jcpinbkk,3,Sat Jun 27 08:32:32 2015 UTC,That's cool to hear! I'd had no idea about this but they are streaming every Jon Stewart episode of The Daily Show and there was a bit on one of the old episodes about Garth being on the Padres which was a complete surprise to me. Interesting to learn that it came the year of the fire sale.
Padres,3b9rsq,Clint_Swift,3,Sat Jun 27 17:03:39 2015 UTC,My dad still has my Garth Brooks Topps card in his attic.  I should go get my cards. Probably a lot of good stuff in those folders.

Padres,3b9r0y,Creux,2,Sat Jun 27 04:38:08 2015 UTC,I met most of them last year and my two favorites Medica is AAA and Cashner playing horrible this year. But I'm gonna meet Norris and hopefully get a photo. Got Ross's autograph and the Petco store meet and greet last year. Can't wait to get one more signed ball
Padres,3b9r0y,floyd631,3,Sat Jun 27 04:41:36 2015 UTC,Chris young came into my work when he was on DL and I told him that I can't wait to see him on the playoffs. We blew it to the Rockies and never saw Chris again.

Did you think Ross had his best stuff or something? He averaged almost a walk an inning. The fact he can still shut down a lineup without his best stuff is a good thing.
Padres,3b9yia,Friard,10,Sat Jun 27 05:06:57 2015 UTC,Niiiice we won. The win streak starts now!!!  maybe please pls

Padres,3bbzyn,Mordkay,6,Sat Jun 27 20:34:38 2015 UTC,It's already happening on Facebook. Non fans trying to blame everyone down the line
Padres,3bbzyn,betonthis1,5,Sat Jun 27 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, I just don't know what to say. I've been going back and forth deleting and adding things to this response. I went ahead and saw some of the comments on various places, and read some of the post here (/r/padres) I knew expectations where high, but as right now, many peoples expectations are just fucking ridiculous and no where near logical. Every one is jumping ship, and the ship is not even sinking."
Padres,3bbzyn,Mordkay,3,Sat Jun 27 22:05:25 2015 UTC,I agree especially with a sport where you could have unlimited money to spend and you still can't produce a World Series team. Baseball is completely unpredictable so for anyone to think we should be .1000 is crazy. I think with the influx of new fans they are going to talk out their ass
Padres,3bbzyn,betonthis1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:35:17 2015 UTC,I took about a week away from posting with any regularity here and the UT SD forum and I tell ha...it worked wonders....I stopped watching every game...went back to game day updates and box score reading and I am way less angry about the team....still a bit disappointed but hey....still a ton of time left and I am just going to enjoy the ride....if all else fails the fire sale may be spectacular ;-)

Padres,3bbzyn,UserDrew,2,Sat Jun 27 23:41:01 2015 UTC,The worst part is they made no mention of the other 4 candidates. If preller wasnt the right hire who did they have in mind. I expect this stuff out of ESPN but not UT
Padres,3bbzyn,Friard,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:59:28 2015 UTC,It really depends on if this crappy playing is because of a slump...or if it is because people are on the downswing. I can't imagine it not being a slump though. Kemp might be a bigger issue however.  So the issue could be with the scouts expecting more out of people than actually possible...and thinking some people were actually able to be salveged.
Padres,3bbzyn,BobTaco,-1,Sat Jun 27 22:11:58 2015 UTC,You cant blame guys underperforming on the GM. Maybe the manager but not really. Nobody guessed Matt Kemp would suck donkey dick. And upton is a strike out machine right now..so is norris n middlebrooks. Dont even want to mention upton jr n mazzoni...

Padres,3b7nhi,violaxcore,2,Fri Jun 26 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"I think the conclusion of this article can extend to the entire pitching staff. Every pitcher this year has had that ""melt down"" from not adhering to ""fundamentals"" but some of the big hits we've seen is because so many other teams know the tendencies of Ross, Kennedy, and company. I good indicator of one of these is when an announcers says ""Well, that was an excellent pitch but. . ..""  The next time Ross starts, he should just throw change ups from different arm angles until the hitters start to adjust then throw in a softball underhand fashion.    To continue the speculation, the early innning runs may be an indicator of the same problems. The Padres go in with their strategy and it doesn't work. The 5+ ERA for the starters in the first inning as exhibit A. Damage done, they adjust over the next few innings and this team has to play catch up."

Padres,3b3zvt,stopsucking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:08:00 2015 UTC,I am to the point that as long as the dodgers lose I consider it a good day.  Today they didn't so its a bad day.

Padres,3b3zvt,HeadleysHobos,6,Thu Jun 25 23:05:20 2015 UTC,RIP your inbox /u/PanicAtTheSisqo   The reason why there's no game thread is for some reason this game shows a 7:15PM start time in our sidebar. So I'm guessing around then /u/FriarBot will wake up and post a thread :D
Padres,3b3zvt,couchmeister,4,Thu Jun 25 23:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they said on the broadcast that today was supposed to be a night game."
Padres,3b3zvt,The_Aardvark,2,Thu Jun 25 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the reason. I didn't know todays game time was changed."

Padres,3b3zvt,megustanlosyogapants,4,Thu Jun 25 21:43:16 2015 UTC,We've been doing that for too long.
Padres,3b3zvt,folettary,4,Thu Jun 25 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"Seriously, people are getting way too butt-hurt. Yeah, its frustrating, but come on you can't expect a fantastic game every day. Especially against the Giants, they're a tough team."
Padres,3b3zvt,couchmeister,2,Thu Jun 25 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"you aren't going to get fantastic games every day cause that is baseball but this team over the last two weeks has looked shaky even in wins.  just take Tuesday for example, yea we won but the offense really struggled with all the strike outs.  I am totally fine with losing but it seems like this team makes the same mistakes over and over and over again without making adjustments.  Like swing at the first pitch after a walk, all the errors, matt kemp seems like he steps into the box with a 0-2 count every time, seven plus strikeouts for the offense nearly every game.  Like I said I am okay with losing as long as players are showing progress but it appears that they have stagnated."
Padres,3b3zvt,gstutz176,2,Thu Jun 25 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, bro. You can't say anything negative here. I did and was accosted. You become a pessimist and everyone hates your guts."
Padres,3b3zvt,gex_squad,2,Thu Jun 25 21:23:33 2015 UTC,Lol true. Becoming a pessimist is just the natural progression of padre fandom

Padres,3b3zvt,Flesh_Lettuce,6,Thu Jun 25 22:36:52 2015 UTC,I think Matt Kemp is a secret agent for the Dodgers
Padres,3b3zvt,Bob_D0bbs,4,Thu Jun 25 22:40:19 2015 UTC,Kemp is fucking useless
Padres,3b3zvt,thewhiteman80,4,Thu Jun 25 20:27:06 2015 UTC,Just sucks we suck but we've sucked forever but now we're actually trying and have no excuses which sucks even more.
Padres,3b3zvt,gstutz176,3,Thu Jun 25 21:13:19 2015 UTC,add in the fact that pretty much everyone we traded away is succeeding and it makes it suck even more.

Padres,3b3zvt,SportsMind,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:49:35 2015 UTC,It'll probably be Upton but he needs to step it up
Padres,3b3zvt,gstutz176,-2,Thu Jun 25 20:54:55 2015 UTC,1 month and Upton has been pretty unlucky. Fuck yourself.
Padres,3b3zvt,SportsMind,0,Thu Jun 25 21:04:49 2015 UTC,I still think norris is the padres' all star this year cause his numbers are great for his position but one month out of three is a pretty big portion of the season
Padres,3b3zvt,gstutz176,0,Thu Jun 25 20:41:48 2015 UTC,Go look at the other players and tell me if they were great for all 3 months.
Padres,3b3zvt,SportsMind,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"That isn't my point.  My point isn't in comparison to other padres players and like I said norris is our all star in my opinion.  However, one third of anything is a significant portion of anything.  That is the sole point I am trying to make."
Padres,3b3zvt,simboisland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about other Padres players. The other Padres hitters flat out suck. I'm talking about Jup's peers at his position and other catchers. Tell me how many of them have avoided the 1 bad month. Tell me how many of them have been good or great for all 3 months? Baseball is a game of streaks, very few players avoid bad months."
Padres,3b3zvt,gshortelljr,2,Thu Jun 25 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"Not gonna bother looking up exact stats, but I'm willing to bet there are players who have had two bad 2 week stretches, as opposed to bad months. I think that hides the slumps better. Baseball is streaky, and its important to keep the bad ones short, even if there are several."

Padres,3b3zvt,ClevelandBrownJunior,2,Thu Jun 25 21:29:51 2015 UTC,He's been about the only positive over the past two days and 5 Ks in 2 innings is a pretty damn good positive.

Padres,3b3zvt,gstutz176,3,Thu Jun 25 21:51:01 2015 UTC,I think it's time for Kemp to hit the DL.
Padres,3b3zvt,mikeb3rd96,3,Thu Jun 25 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"Woah this is getting interesting...We need to keep Barmes and Amarista in the line-up, bench Middlebrooks. I would like to see Wallace get a start too."
Padres,3b3zvt,carmen_electralytes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:53:44 2015 UTC,"I would not be opposed to a starting infield tomorrow with a combination of amarista, barmes, wallace, and alonso."

Padres,3b3zvt,carmen_electralytes,3,Thu Jun 25 22:28:59 2015 UTC,"Even if we don't make it, gotta give it to them for making it that close."
Padres,3b3zvt,gstutz176,4,Thu Jun 25 22:25:24 2015 UTC,yup losing by one is much easier to swallow.  obviously hope we can pull it out but one run is so much less depressing.
Padres,3b3zvt,stopsucking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:28:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. But man, getting me all excited, then being let down. Bah, still tough. No matter how much shit I say about this team, they're still the my team, and I'll never give up on them. Padre for life."

Padres,3b3zvt,bhahne,3,Thu Jun 25 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yah they haven't actually given up. That's just my way of airing out frustration with this team. They can't pitch, they can't score. We don't have much to look forward too this year."

Padres,3b3zvt,fryisadog,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:44:29 2015 UTC,I feel the same way.  I think a lot of it was the expectation to win.  Normally we expect to lose and then we go out and lose so its not a big deal.  Now that there is an actual letdown when we lose it just makes it so much worse.
Padres,3b3zvt,gstutz176,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. To me, seeing Upton, Kemp, Norris and those kind of big names on the field got me so excited. I think I just got to eager about it and thought we'd be this juggernaut but it's not looking like that. I dunno, man. I hope these guys find their groove but for now my expectations are gonna have to go down severely."
Padres,3b3zvt,fryisadog,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:56:50 2015 UTC,this team reminds me of the angels when they got pujols and wilson. (i live in orange county). everyone was expecting them to make a huge run that year and they played around .500 which was a disappointment and that team went on to underachieve.  it really took them a few years to put it together and gel.  i think that could possibly be what we are seeing.  a team that is taking longer than expected to figure each other out.

Padres,3b4npp,thefeistygoat,3,Fri Jun 26 01:21:36 2015 UTC,we can still turn it around. Blue jays just won like 12 in a row last week. We're due for a hot streak. Not looking forward to the Cardinals however

Padres,3b4npp,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Fri Jun 26 01:42:46 2015 UTC,Padres are 3-6 under Pat Murphy so far.
Padres,3b4npp,n0teye,7,Fri Jun 26 01:18:46 2015 UTC,"Pat isn't to blame. This team began to go into freefall mode before he was hired, and now they are in the middle of it. This is on the players not performing."
Padres,3b4npp,folettary,2,Fri Jun 26 02:03:32 2015 UTC,While I agree that Pat is not to blame entirely they were only 1 game back after nearly sweeping the Dodgers at home under Buddy.   Now they are fucked.
Padres,3b4npp,n0teye,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:46:26 2015 UTC,Exactly. I don't see how you can say this is on Buddy if it isn't on Pat Murphy either. Also I thought we lost that series to the Dodgers.
Padres,3b4npp,Maxwell69,3,Fri Jun 26 04:29:33 2015 UTC,"Not blaming it on either of them. Bud was bound to get fired though as a scapegoat. People in this sub put far too much stock in the manager. Yah a manager might be able to pump a team up, or find the right lineup, but if they players aren't producing its 100% on them."
Padres,3b4npp,folettary,5,Fri Jun 26 06:31:35 2015 UTC,It's so obvious can't compete in the West this season.
Padres,3b4npp,CuteWolves,9,Thu Jun 25 23:06:33 2015 UTC,"We're 15-12 against the division besides L.A. Over half the season still to be played. Okay, though."
Padres,3b4npp,EnervateYou,2,Fri Jun 26 00:47:13 2015 UTC,Only okay and after you eliminate our 4-8 record against the freaking Doyers.. We have to win division games if we want to compete.. We really should be better than just okay..

Padres,3b4npp,mittensthekhajit,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:47:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think there is any better way to put this than to say the team is an absolute bust, and it'd be pretty hard to disagree with that statement. Will Myers is on the DL for the next six weeks and so is one of our starting pitchers. Norris had a pretty strong start to the season, but besides his defense, he's a pretty mediocre player who came back down to reality. Upton has had the same results and if it's not a home-run, he's either striking out or hitting popups. Kemp has been atrocious for the majority of the season both on offense and defense. Middlebrooks, Amarista, Gyorko, and Solarte almost seem nonexistent and Hedges and Spangenberg have done squat. Likewise, Shields has been a complete joke this far as the only reason his win column is so high is due to his run support, but finally the tease is over. Ross, Cashner, and Kennedy have just flat out sucked this year and the bullpen shits the bed almost every other night. I honestly think the only two players on the team that have had a great year so far are Alonso and Venable. Nobody on the team is an all-star, period. I kept reading comments from elsewhere during the offseason saying that our acquisitions were meaningless due to the infield not being addressed, and it seems they were right. I swear it looked so good on paper but the chemistry just isn't present. The Padres are five games below 0.500 and the two probable teams who could win the division just keep on winning, because they know how to get the job done. :("
Padres,3b4npp,pacocapone,5,Thu Jun 25 23:17:01 2015 UTC,The NL West is a very good division. The Dodgers are one of the best teams in baseball and the Giants are the reigning champs. The D'backs are playing well and the Rockies are just barely worse then we are.   If we look at the Wild Card we have to deal with both the Giants and D'backs as well as the Pirates and Cubs. It isn't going to be an easy trip to the playoffs.   If we aren't back to .500 by mid-July I think it's time for Preller to start salvaging what value we can get out of this team.
Padres,3b4npp,Sane_Wicked,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:43:27 2015 UTC,What would be the probability of say Matt Kemp coming back next year?
Padres,3b4npp,pacocapone,2,Fri Jun 26 03:21:25 2015 UTC,No way anyone takes Kemp on that contract.
Padres,3b4npp,HeadleysHobos,2,Fri Jun 26 05:01:21 2015 UTC,Giants and Dodgers don't keep on winning. The bullpen had a rough day but has been otherwise solid. Your rant is just one more in a long line of knee jerk reactions on this sub. After Tuesday you'd swear we had clinched the division. We're in a rut but not out of it yet. No one is running away with the division. Just gotta keep the faith and hope they can right the ship. If pitching comes around we can still salvage the season.
Padres,3b4npp,Flesh_Lettuce,-7,Fri Jun 26 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"Are you fucking blind? A sane person can clearly see that either the Dodgers or Giants are going to take the division. The bullpen had been solid for about a week but over the course of the entire season, they've been dreadful. We are not in a rut because this has been going on the whole time. Why do you blatantly try and shrug off the problems like everything is going to gel in tomorrow's game?"
Padres,3b4npp,pacocapone,3,Fri Jun 26 03:20:04 2015 UTC,I'm just trying to enjoy the season. Did you really say autistic? You're a douchebag. Dodgers and Giants have losing streaks this month. I'm just staying positive and hoping for the best. I'm frustrated as much as anyone. But I'm not gonna argue with someone who says shit like that. I wish the Padres didn't have cunt fans like you.
Padres,3b4npp,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Fri Jun 26 03:25:06 2015 UTC,"You know what, shame on me for using that word. I apologize, man. I hate the Dodgers and Giants just as much as everyone else so I wouldn't want to stoop down to their level by using saying such a hateful comment. Let's go out and kick the Diamondbacks ass tomorrow. Stay classy, San Diego."
Padres,3b4npp,pacocapone,4,Fri Jun 26 03:30:29 2015 UTC,"apology accepted. There's nothing wrong with staying positive throughout the season. The Padres have sucked long enough to know that. The people in this fan base that are blindly optimistic are just trying to enjoy their baseball team in the rough times. Faith is something that is not proven, you just have to believe it will happen. Go Padres!  And like my mom says: don't be a cunt"
Padres,3b4npp,Flesh_Lettuce,0,Fri Jun 26 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the team has a really tough stretch of game before the all-star break, so those series are really going to be a test for this mysterious club."

Padres,3b1uk8,BobTaco,8,Thu Jun 25 08:44:29 2015 UTC,It threw me off at first also. He walked in talking on the phone and his voice is pretty distinguishable

I like the Padres and I will be positive and enjoy the season.  Or else what's the point?  Sick of this crap.  I've watched enough Padres baseball in my life to be stupidly positive, or else I cant enjoy it."
Padres,3b4oc9,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:41:01 2015 UTC,There's a difference between being optimistic and realistic.
Padres,3b4oc9,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Fri Jun 26 12:10:06 2015 UTC,"Most of us have been down this road before.  I get excited for every season of Padres baseball because you never know when something like 2010 can happen, and we out perform expectations.  I'm not going to sit in the dumps over every loss because I like to enjoy the entirety of a season, win or lose.  If you think those of us who are optimistic don't realize what's going on, than you are the naive one.  You should keep your negative vibes to yourself."
Padres,3b4oc9,simboisland,7,Fri Jun 26 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. You are correct. Those are different words, each with its own, different meaning."
Padres,3b4oc9,djc6535,4,Fri Jun 26 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"The point being you can be optimistic without deluding yourself.  This is a 500 team.  One that is probably best served by trading Upton away at this point.  It's a bummer to say that, but it's true.  I can still be optimistic about the situation and the squad in general.  For example, I'm still glad we made the changes we made.  It was incredible as a Padres fan to watch our GM actually TRY.  People are trying to tear those decisions down because they didn't result in a post season team, but I chalk that up to the fact that Preller ruffled a few feathers when he made his moves.  I'm fine, happy even, with a GM who doesn't care about ruffling feathers.  I'm happy with the improvement... and there HAS been improvement.  I'm glad to see some offense.  I'm disappointed in the way our pitching fell off the face of the earth, and in Kemp and Melvin Upton's contracts, but I'm still glad we made the moves we did.  I believe that we will continue to get better.  I believe we'll continue to work on adding pieces next year and will make a solid Managerial hire.  To me that's optimism without pretending we're better than we are and ignoring the reality of our situation."
Padres,3b4oc9,simboisland,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"I've always been an advocate of trading Upton. It feels like we tried to sublimate from losers to World Series Champion, skipping the middle phase. Not gonna happen. I wonder who would give us what for Justin?"
Padres,3b4oc9,BobTaco,6,Fri Jun 26 15:42:31 2015 UTC,500 is still an improvement over the last couple seasons. I think gelling was harder to do than people expected. One good run can change things...but racking up consistency seems to be impossible for some reason.
Padres,3b4oc9,Maxwell69,5,Fri Jun 26 00:45:57 2015 UTC,We aren't .500 though. The 2013 Padres were 2 games over .500 after 74 games and that team did it without trading away the farm system.
Padres,3b4oc9,Friard,3,Fri Jun 26 05:34:26 2015 UTC,"The 2013 team played above their talent level, they ended up with 76 wins. The 2013 team had a core group of players that had been with the team multiple years. This team is comprised of an entirely new roster with players playing below their talent level."

Padres,3b4oc9,BobTaco,3,Fri Jun 26 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"Of course we aren't .500 the season isn't over yet...and the division is very close still.   If people were playing to their ability, and weren't slumping...or suddenly getting the yips...this would be a different team. Nobody expected the pitching to suck balls this year when they kept all their good ones. That turning around would do wonders alone."
Padres,3b4oc9,Maxwell69,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"So you can't definitively say this team is a .500 team. Also there is the chance players will be moved in a couple of weeks, which would improve our farm system but make the big league club worse."
Padres,3b4oc9,BobTaco,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:21:39 2015 UTC,"I never once said they were .500 I merely said that .500 is a improvement over previous seasons. If they were to get to .500 or better, it would be an improvement even though they might not make the playoffs. The price for said improvement would be expensive, but it would be an improvement nonetheless. Now if this team doesn't make it to .500 or better...it is either a fluke, or a serious problem."

Padres,3b4oc9,Flesh_Lettuce,5,Fri Jun 26 14:21:59 2015 UTC,How the hell does hiring a manager fix anything?
Padres,3b4oc9,FunknSD,8,Fri Jun 26 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from based on the injuries and poor performance we are currently seeing. I disagree about Black though, he may not have been the cause of our shitty record but he wouldn't have changed anything if we had kept him.  Sick of all the blind ""keep the faith"" crap too. Can't a guy be disappointed by his team and still be a fan?"
Padres,3b4oc9,SunriseSurprise,3,Thu Jun 25 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"Firing Black was similar to firing Schottenheimer except it wasn't during or after a good season. Capable coach? Sure. Getting the job done (Schottenheimer's being winning any playoff game with that super stacked team, Black's simply getting back to the playoffs)? No. People looove to have fond memories of Schottenheimer, like the firing of him was absolutely impossible to fathom because he was the greatest coach since sliced bread. The fact is we won absolutely no playoff games with a stacked team at his disposal. He may have been a coaching embodiment of Nate Kaeding and you'd be hard pressed to find people with an overwhelmingly positive feeling towards Nate Kaeding as a Charger even though he was the most accurate kicker we've ever had.  Sure, there's always the notion that you could simply point to players not performing, but if it's seeming to be a pattern, you can't keep doing that. At some point, you need to try a change of scenery, or you risk keeping the coach, having nothing change for another 5-10 years and looking back and feeling like you just wasted 15-20 years with a coach that never really held the possibility of leading a contending team."
Padres,3b4oc9,FunknSD,-3,Sat Jun 27 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, we fired Black because we sucked. That is what you're saying.  Therefore, we are rebuilding for next season.  Also never said I wasn't a fan."
Padres,3b4oc9,HeadleysHobos,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"I never said you weren't a fan, I'm totally with you that being realistic about the team should not mean being ""downvoted to oblivion"". I'm just saying that the manager position is overated. In my opinion even if Bochy was still skipper our record would be pretty much the same."
Padres,3b4oc9,HeadleysHobos,5,Fri Jun 26 02:58:08 2015 UTC,Why do you think hiring a new manager is the answer? Murphy has been on the job a week but you already don't think he could be the right guy for the job?
Padres,3b4oc9,Snuffaluffakuss,-6,Fri Jun 26 00:02:02 2015 UTC,Please re-read what I said. I never claimed hiring a new manager is the answer. I said FIRING a manager mid-season who has been around for the past several years is no way for us to win this season. And we won't.

Projections are just guessed, that why they still play the game.   Even if they don't end up making the playoffs, I'm still going to watch & support them.

Padres,3b0glu,couchmeister,4,Wed Jun 24 23:50:47 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be the first time our acquisition of a big bat right fielder ended up hitting leadoff for us.
Padres,3b0glu,JAYFL,3,Thu Jun 25 00:11:45 2015 UTC,Bout time Upton was batting cleanup. After getting tossed yesterday this is another tick in Murphy's kudos column.
Padres,3b0glu,ZiggyILM,2,Thu Jun 25 01:14:31 2015 UTC,I think this is a fantastic idea.
Padres,3b0glu,thatkidcalhoun,2,Thu Jun 25 00:11:59 2015 UTC,Hmmmmmm.

Padres,3b1fgz,youreaturtle,4,Thu Jun 25 05:29:24 2015 UTC,This game was bleh. I want a damn win streak!

Padres,3b1fgz,HeadleysHobos,3,Thu Jun 25 05:31:05 2015 UTC,We're teetering on the edge here.

Padres,3b1fgz,BurritoCon,2,Thu Jun 25 17:55:21 2015 UTC,Well poop.
Padres,3b1fgz,ClevelandBrownJunior,2,Thu Jun 25 05:00:44 2015 UTC,"Currently I feel like we are the worst team in MLB and its time to panic, then I look at the standings and we're only 5.5 games back and our team can still hit its stride. Our record is representative of how our team has played, either our bats are doing well and our pitching stinks or vice versa. Lets go Padres, one game at a time."
Padres,3b1fgz,Burusu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:45:59 2015 UTC,Didn't someone post a link to an article or stat that said based on our performance our record was better than it should be?

Padres,3b0p38,luv1138,6,Thu Jun 25 03:18:03 2015 UTC,Aaaand now they give the outside strike.

Padres,3b0p38,DickLame,4,Thu Jun 25 04:08:40 2015 UTC,Upton has been struggling this month but he has had 7-8 balls that have been crushed and caught. sigh
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,3,Thu Jun 25 02:24:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, 2 strikes, and than right down the middle."

Padres,3b0p38,Steameffekt,5,Thu Jun 25 03:13:51 2015 UTC,Could have easily gotten out of that inning with 0 runs despite Kemp just misplaying/not catching that ball. All he had to do was field it cleanly and he likely doesn't go to third.
Padres,3b0p38,Strike3,4,Thu Jun 25 03:34:19 2015 UTC,I'm done. Night yall. Sucks living Midwest. I'll catch the rest tomorrow when I wake up at 430. Hopefully I'll have a happy time with my coffee.
Padres,3b0p38,Sane_Wicked,4,Thu Jun 25 03:35:55 2015 UTC,every starter except Norris had good career numbers against vogelsong. Even Kennedy was 2-4 yet dude has a 13 inning scoreless streak going.
Padres,3b0p38,thefeistygoat,4,Thu Jun 25 03:45:55 2015 UTC,Let'd do some damage this inning. Staying faithful!
Padres,3b0p38,Br1ngTheRayne,5,Thu Jun 25 03:50:53 2015 UTC,If this team could only fire on all cylinders. Upton does well...no one else hits. Starter is great...no runs. Bunch of hits...bullpen blows it.
Padres,3b0p38,couchmeister,4,Thu Jun 25 03:57:05 2015 UTC,We haven't been more than one game above .500 since May 14. The trade deadline is just over a month away and how much longer can we expect this team to suddenly turn it around? Preller has some seriously difficult decisions to make.
Padres,3b0p38,Friard,7,Thu Jun 25 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"Fuck, all of a sudden the stroke zone widens a ton when we're batting. Thanks blue, appreciate it"
Padres,3b0p38,couchmeister,4,Thu Jun 25 03:22:15 2015 UTC,Especially with RISP
Padres,3b0p38,Burusu,2,Thu Jun 25 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"Seriously, makes no sense. These umps make the game so damn frustrating"
Padres,3b0p38,Friard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:23:48 2015 UTC,Need robot umps asap. These umps have too much control over the game and they make things too arbitrary.

Padres,3b0p38,bhahne,2,Thu Jun 25 02:45:36 2015 UTC,Except Ron Fowler owns a booze distribution company and Petco is stuffed to the gills with booze ads.
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,2,Thu Jun 25 02:57:12 2015 UTC,Not behind home plate though

Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:07:58 2015 UTC,Just noticed that as well
Padres,3b0p38,warheart90,3,Thu Jun 25 03:24:39 2015 UTC,Can we stop taking the first pitch now?
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,3,Thu Jun 25 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"Rough fielding patch we're weathering, Middlebrooks. oi."
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,2,Thu Jun 25 02:47:13 2015 UTC,"He should have had it.  But, funny thing is, if amarista were 2 inches taller, it would have made the highlight reels. Haha but than he wouldn't be the little ninja."
Padres,3b0p38,Br1ngTheRayne,3,Thu Jun 25 02:51:39 2015 UTC,only the third inning and already my butthole is clenched and ive stopped breathing. baseball is rough on the body.
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,3,Thu Jun 25 02:55:16 2015 UTC,"Driiiiink, it relaxes the bumhole and airways lol"
Padres,3b0p38,rurounijosie,2,Thu Jun 25 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"i would be -for sure, but it wouldn't mix well with my current pain meds. I'll have to make do. painfully, with a dry series."
Padres,3b0p38,DickLame,3,Thu Jun 25 02:58:00 2015 UTC,The shit infield defense is costing us too many runs and pitches.
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,3,Thu Jun 25 03:00:17 2015 UTC,Kennedy don't do that to me :(
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,3,Thu Jun 25 03:01:47 2015 UTC,Ouch
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,3,Thu Jun 25 03:04:04 2015 UTC,Fuck
Padres,3b0p38,I_are_facepalm,3,Thu Jun 25 03:04:11 2015 UTC,I fucking hate the Giants
Padres,3b0p38,espo619,3,Thu Jun 25 03:04:14 2015 UTC,so.....is that nightmare unearned?
Padres,3b0p38,couchmeister,4,Thu Jun 25 03:04:21 2015 UTC,All of the runs are unearned. Inning would have been long over if Middlebrooks could make a play.
Padres,3b0p38,espo619,3,Thu Jun 25 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"story of our mother fucking season. Middlebrooks is close to making me miss Headley's defense, and that is a criminal offense."
Padres,3b0p38,folettary,3,Thu Jun 25 03:05:13 2015 UTC,¿Por que señor Kennedy?
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,3,Thu Jun 25 03:06:18 2015 UTC,"So I literally turned the radio on at the exact moment that Ted began to call that grand slam.   After stopping watching the game in the 6th last night, I'll take that as a sign.   I'm staying out of this series."
Padres,3b0p38,rurounijosie,3,Thu Jun 25 03:05:01 2015 UTC,"Or maybe it's a sign to watch from the start. We need the support, brother"
Padres,3b0p38,folettary,2,Thu Jun 25 03:06:29 2015 UTC,Eh I'll be at Petco on friday for the DBags
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,3,Thu Jun 25 03:09:10 2015 UTC,Middlebrook's defense has been a fucking joke.
Padres,3b0p38,warheart90,5,Thu Jun 25 03:12:09 2015 UTC,...but jokes are funny. Im just sad.
Padres,3b0p38,Friard,3,Thu Jun 25 03:06:53 2015 UTC,Our pitchers seem to shit themselves after a lead off walk or error...
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,3,Thu Jun 25 03:07:43 2015 UTC,This will be the second game this week we have lost because of defense if we lose. Second time (Sunday) a big inning has happened because Middlebrooks doesn't know how to do his job at third.
Padres,3b0p38,rurounijosie,3,Thu Jun 25 03:08:17 2015 UTC,How slow is Alonso? WTF
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,2,Thu Jun 25 03:09:18 2015 UTC,He is bartolo colon slow.
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,3,Thu Jun 25 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think trying yonder at  third would be worth a shot, he came up as a third baseman. Could put norris at first"
Padres,3b0p38,jbraun04,2,Thu Jun 25 03:27:02 2015 UTC,I'd like to see norris at first twice a week. Give him more rests and hedges more time.
Padres,3b0p38,anoff,3,Thu Jun 25 03:13:09 2015 UTC,Ya ease them both in.
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,3,Thu Jun 25 03:14:32 2015 UTC,That hasn't been a fucking strike all night long.
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,3,Thu Jun 25 03:15:58 2015 UTC,Nice job by Alonso to stay alive long enough for Venable to get to 2nd.
Padres,3b0p38,Steameffekt,3,Thu Jun 25 03:17:59 2015 UTC,fuck fuck fuck fuck
Padres,3b0p38,UserDrew,3,Thu Jun 25 03:20:51 2015 UTC,38 unearned runs in 74 games... Ugh
Padres,3b0p38,Burusu,2,Thu Jun 25 03:24:53 2015 UTC,clearly we are trying to set some kind of record. are we on pace?
Padres,3b0p38,carmen_electralytes,2,Thu Jun 25 03:31:07 2015 UTC,"I knew it was a lot, but 38?! That's crazy!"

Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,3,Thu Jun 25 03:32:41 2015 UTC,Im going to need my silver dinner platter back from the Padres after this one.
Padres,3b0p38,Friard,3,Thu Jun 25 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"Hey Padres, comeback wins are cool and all, but did you know its possible to get the lead first and win the game? Lets start the rally now. Commence Rally Gorilla : https://vimeo.com/62839747"
Padres,3b0p38,Steameffekt,3,Thu Jun 25 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"Don't swing, big willy."
Padres,3b0p38,carmen_electralytes,3,Thu Jun 25 04:00:25 2015 UTC,Kennedy has a 1.80 ERA for this game.......
Padres,3b0p38,ImNotTheChris,2,Thu Jun 25 04:00:44 2015 UTC,IPK has pitched very well outside of what happened after the error. Can't expect a guy to get an extra out in a game of inches.

Padres,3b0p38,warheart90,3,Thu Jun 25 04:28:58 2015 UTC,Let's go on a little streak these next 3 and tie it up at least... Cmon Friars
Padres,3b0p38,thewhiteman80,3,Thu Jun 25 04:07:50 2015 UTC,"Call me crazy, but I got a weird little comeback vibe right now. I think we can hit romo or whoever comes out"
Padres,3b0p38,carmen_electralytes,2,Thu Jun 25 04:11:42 2015 UTC,That's the spirit!
Padres,3b0p38,BurritoCon,5,Thu Jun 25 04:30:19 2015 UTC,"Hi, keep the faith."
Padres,3b0p38,Draper-Durden-619,3,Thu Jun 25 04:31:44 2015 UTC,Hi. I agree.
Padres,3b0p38,couchmeister,4,Thu Jun 25 01:40:46 2015 UTC,"I wish umpires had twitter accounts, so i could talk shit to them.  We had fat fuck last night, and apparently my blind chihuahua tonight."
Padres,3b0p38,Friard,2,Thu Jun 25 02:07:01 2015 UTC,Am I reading this right kemp leading off?
Padres,3b0p38,bhahne,3,Thu Jun 25 03:26:04 2015 UTC,Maybe a change of pace is what he needs?
Padres,3b0p38,Friard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:21:56 2015 UTC,can't get much worse
Padres,3b0p38,Snuffaluffakuss,2,Thu Jun 25 01:26:25 2015 UTC,Let's keep in going guys. Time to get hot!
Padres,3b0p38,couchmeister,2,Thu Jun 25 02:06:48 2015 UTC,Kennedy looks good tonight

Padres,3b0p38,warheart90,2,Thu Jun 25 02:38:14 2015 UTC,Yea that would be helpful
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:39:44 2015 UTC,We should stop saying that and just appraise the job when it's over
Padres,3b0p38,pandajay24,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:43:21 2015 UTC,Agreed...
Padres,3b0p38,Friard,2,Thu Jun 25 03:37:36 2015 UTC,"Hey ya'll. How are you, compadres?"
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 25 03:42:03 2015 UTC,Feeling hopeful
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 25 02:45:37 2015 UTC,Annnnnd again....2 strikes...right down the middle.
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 25 02:46:15 2015 UTC,I like it
Padres,3b0p38,Steameffekt,2,Thu Jun 25 03:05:03 2015 UTC,NOW they give the low strike.
Padres,3b0p38,pandajay24,2,Thu Jun 25 03:12:58 2015 UTC,What???
Padres,3b0p38,Br1ngTheRayne,2,Thu Jun 25 03:13:09 2015 UTC,I love hearing Grant decipher catcher signals. Interesting stuff
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,2,Thu Jun 25 03:17:56 2015 UTC,Another Alonso run down....maybe we have another comeback coming
Padres,3b0p38,n0teye,2,Thu Jun 25 03:18:06 2015 UTC,Not his fault. Hoffman told him to run on contact.
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,2,Thu Jun 25 03:21:07 2015 UTC,Why
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,2,Thu Jun 25 03:28:46 2015 UTC,God dammit
Padres,3b0p38,friarfangirl,2,Thu Jun 25 03:24:56 2015 UTC,Dang it WMB scalded that too. He's been getting really good swings lately.
Padres,3b0p38,The_Aardvark,2,Thu Jun 25 03:25:10 2015 UTC,This is no fun
Padres,3b0p38,SportsMind,2,Thu Jun 25 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"I've about had it with Kemp. Someone talk me out of it, I'm usually the optimistic one."
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,3,Thu Jun 25 03:29:18 2015 UTC,He is absolutely atrocious out there.
Padres,3b0p38,carmen_electralytes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:29:58 2015 UTC,and yet he's somehow in the top notch for outfield assists. I don't get it.
Padres,3b0p38,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 25 03:31:10 2015 UTC,Then they don't even give Kemp the error.
Padres,3b0p38,warheart90,2,Thu Jun 25 03:41:22 2015 UTC,oh for the love of the baseball gods
Padres,3b0p38,couchmeister,2,Thu Jun 25 03:31:16 2015 UTC,Oh man.

Padres,3b00rx,CommonAndCurrent,7,Wed Jun 24 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"It's tempting to dream, if for just a moment, about what the 2015 San Diego Padres might look like if they had deferred gratification just a little while longer and retained their prospects. The exercise is worthwhile, because the Padres should think about hitting the reset button unless the fourth-place team overcomes its mediocrity and starts to win very soon.  If the Padres hadn't traded for Matt Kemp, they'd still have one of the best catchers in 2015, Yasmani Grandal, who has a .382 on-base percentage and 10 homers -- more than twice as many as Kemp -- and also ranks among the leaders in some next-level defensive metrics.  If Grandal hadn't been traded, then the Padres wouldn't have had to deal Jesse Hahn for Derek Norris. Hahn has 14 starts for the Athletics and boasts a 3.40 ERA.  If the Padres hadn't made the trade for Justin Upton, they would have 25-year-old Jace Peterson, who is hitting .279 with a .360 on-base percentage for Atlanta. The Padres also would have center field prospect Mallex Smith, who is hitting .340 in Double-A with a .418 on-base percentage and 23 stolen bases; Dustin Peterson, a 20-year-old outfielder and former second-round pick playing well in Class A; and well-regarded pitching prospect Max Fried, a first-round pick in 2012 who is now recovering from Tommy John surgery.  If San Diego had remained patient last summer and held on to Huston Street, the Padres wouldn't have traded for the game's second-most expensive closer, Craig Kimbrel, and would still have 22-year-old right-hander Matt Wisler, who was among the players sent to Atlanta for Kimbrel. Last Friday, Wisler allowed no walks and one run over eight innings in his major league debut. Cameron Maybin, also a part of that trade, is hitting .288 for the Braves with a .366 on-base percentage, while earning $7 million; it appears his $8 million salary for next year could be a bargain. Without the deal for Kimbrel, the Padres also would have Jordan Paroubeck, their second-round pick in 2013. Joe Ross is 2-1 with a 2.66 ERA for the Nationals. Icon Sportswire/AP Images  If the Padres hadn't traded for Wil Myers, they would still have Trea Turner, their first-round pick in 2014 and one of the top shortstop prospects in the game. He has been chewing up Double-A pitching this year, and rival evaluators view him as a worthy heir to the shortstop position for the Nationals. If not for the Myers deal, the Padres still would have Joe Ross, the 21-year-old brother of Tyson Ross. Joe Ross has filled in for Stephen Strasburg in recent weeks and surrendered just two walks and six runs in 20 1/3 innings.  If the Padres hadn't gone all win-now for 2015, they probably wouldn't have signed James Shields, and wouldn't have sacrificed the 12th overall pick in the 2015 MLB draft for compensation. Maybe they would've landed somebody like high school first baseman Josh Naylor in the draft, or impressive prep outfielder Garrett Whitley.  The Padres also wouldn't be staring at a looming salary crunch after this year, as they are now. San Diego had a $70 million payroll in 2013, $85 million in 2014, and this year the team pushed that to about $110 million. But because the Kemp trade was structured in such a way that the Dodgers paid $18 million of Kemp's salary this year, L.A. will eat only about $3.5 million of his salary for each of the next four years.  In other words, the credit-card bill is coming due for the Padres; they owe Kemp, who turns 31 in September, about $18 million for each of the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 seasons. Kemp's .629 OPS is the fifth worst among the 60 MLB outfielders that qualify for the batting title, and his defensive metrics also place him among the worst outfielders.  The Padres back-loaded Shields' four-year, $75 million deal as well, giving him $10 million for this year, then $21 million for each of the next three seasons (with a $2 million buyout option in 2019). Shields can opt out of his contract after the 2016 season, although rival evaluators wonder if he would do that, considering he'll be almost 35 when he has to make that decision.  Kimbrel, whose performance has regressed this year, will make $11 million next season and $13 million in 2017, and in order to get him, the Padres took on the remaining salary of Melvin Upton Jr., who will make $15.5 million in 2016 and $16.5 million in 2017. All told, the Padres will owe those core four players -- Kemp, Shields, Kimbrel and Melvin Upton Jr. -- $65 million in 2016 and $68 million in 2017.  Additionally: Justin Upton, the Padres' best position player, is headed to free agency in a few months, with the industry fully expecting him to sign elsewhere for big money. Starting pitcher Ian Kennedy also is headed to free agency, fellow starter Andrew Cashner will be eligible for free agency after next season, and Tyson Ross can hit the market after the 2017 season.  The Dodgers and Giants haven't played well of late, which has helped keep the Padres in the NL West race, and if San Diego makes the postseason, well, then it's mission accomplished for a team that worked to make a splash during the offseason.  But the cost in prospects for San Diego's summer bash was extraordinary. Really, it appears that the Padres surrendered a generation of major leaguers. After the Diamondbacks effectively sold former No. 1 pick Touki Toussaint to the Braves the other day, and in the critique of that deal, Toussaint's value was placed somewhere in the range of $20 million. Apply that estimate to the boatload of players San Diego traded and you get a rough idea of how much value went out the door in the offseason moves.  The team's future roster holes are glaring, in the rotation, the infield, center field, catcher. The contracts of Kemp and Melvin Upton Jr. are viewed as dead money. None of it has worked, and some rival evaluators have rendered macro and micro diagnoses on the Padres' series of moves.  ""Total disaster,"" one high-ranked executive said.  Said another: ""Shipwreck.""  However …  As some of the rival evaluators have noted, the Padres still have an opportunity to recoup some value quickly in the next 37 days and put the team in a far better position for 2016 and beyond.  There's nothing they can do about the Kemp deal, and the Braves and Nationals certainly wouldn't give them their prospects back, and they almost certainly won't be able to retain Justin Upton. They also can't get back likeable and respected manager Bud Black, whose firing has some Padres players grumbling.  But if the Padres take advantage of what is perceived to be a market that is thin in sellers, there's still time for them to flip some veterans to restock their farm system and make the future payroll situation more workable.  They could introduce Justin Upton to the trade market as the best available slugger, at a time when teams are starved for power.  The highly respected Shields would have a niche all his own as a sale item: a veteran pitcher under contract beyond this year, as opposed to Johnny Cueto, and less expensive in terms of prospects and salary than Cole Hamels. They could move Cashner as well, although there is some doubt among other teams whether Cashner can be better than a No. 4-type starter given how he executes his pitches. Some rival officials wonder if the Cubs would be a perfect landing spot for Shields, or maybe the Dodgers (although the Padres would have to swallow hard to make another deal with L.A. after the relatively acrimonious Kemp negotiations).  Kimbrel could be a younger, hard-throwing market alternative to Jonathan Papelbon, for roughly the same price, and he doesn't carry the off-field baggage of Francisco Rodriguez, which is a concern for some teams.  Two things would have to happen for the Padres to take this dramatic right turn in the middle of a season in which they intended to win: Padres GM A.J. Preller's offseason makeover hasn't worked out to this point.    They'd have to give up on their dreams of last winter, when they led the majors in columnist kudos. They'd have to implicitly acknowledge their win-now plan didn't work, which is never an easy thing. They'd have to sell the idea of another midsummer fire sale in San Diego, where Padres fans are scarred by memories of that sort of thing. The team would have to articulate why it's a good idea to trade the club's best players this summer.   The Padres wouldn't have to execute the course shift right away, but the sooner the better, because the expectation among GMs is that by July 20, more and more teams will jump in as sellers, and San Diego's pieces wouldn't look quite so exclusive.  But this is the right thing to do, to get the franchise back onto a more sustainable course.  The work of the Pirates, Royals and Rays isn't dynamic; it doesn't get headlines, doesn't make for sparkling news conferences. But these are the models for a team with middling resources: Pick your players effectively, through trades or through the draft; manage your payroll dutifully, always avoiding the type of contracts that can turn into money pits; and remain patient and circumspect.  This is how the Padres should be thinking.  TL:DR - Offseason overhaul has been a disaster for the Padres in terms of $$$ and lost prospects. If the Padres don't turn it around by the trade deadline they need to trade whoever has value (Upton, Shields, Kimbrel) and salvage the long term future of this franchise."

Got our cable installed and today was the second game I've watched and it was very fun. The Padres and A's aren't doing very good right now but I'm excited to pick this team up as my NL team. Your broadcasters are cool and I love your park.  EDIT - Grammar
Padres,3axai6,fryisadog,4,Wed Jun 24 07:15:42 2015 UTC,Welcome to the fold brother/sister
Padres,3axai6,NappyG,4,Wed Jun 24 10:26:48 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Padres,3axai6,cryptic_mythic,3,Wed Jun 24 19:46:43 2015 UTC,A's are my AL team from living up there awhile
Padres,3axai6,NappyG,4,Wed Jun 24 09:49:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just moved from San Jose. No team is going to replace them, but I'm excited to go to a lot of games at Petco."
Padres,3axai6,klongbor,3,Wed Jun 24 19:48:09 2015 UTC,I'm moving up to the bay in August and I've always been an A's fan as my AL team!  team swap brosssss

Padres,3axai6,ShriekingFetus,10,Wed Jun 24 19:48:48 2015 UTC,It's nice to see us finally survive a game with some adversity. Things are lookin' up.  Obligatory FUCK THE DODGERS

Padres,3axai6,Padreschargers7,2,Wed Jun 24 06:53:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't leave, but thanks for the dedication."
Padres,3axai6,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Wed Jun 24 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"no but for someone who has Padres in their name, you sure are quick to lose faith and give up"
Padres,3axai6,daboo760,6,Wed Jun 24 23:14:54 2015 UTC,Nice comeback boys! All those strikeouts were rough but we got hits when it mattered most

Padres,3axai6,Skeptical_Romulan,5,Wed Jun 24 13:46:09 2015 UTC,It was definitely good to see some passion from the dugout. And dear god does Pat Murphy look frightening when angry...
Padres,3axai6,ectric,9,Wed Jun 24 15:42:56 2015 UTC,Nothing better than watching the game at Hooters surrounded by giants fans
Padres,3axai6,luv1138,4,Wed Jun 24 06:25:17 2015 UTC,and we back on 3rd place :D
Padres,3axai6,couchmeister,3,Wed Jun 24 06:28:44 2015 UTC,"Not quite, but almost!"

Padres,3axai6,OK_YEAH,5,Wed Jun 24 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"My favorite part of this game was Murphy getting tossed right before that Venable 2-RBI double. Sweet, sweet redemption. Ball never lies"
Padres,3axai6,UserDrew,4,Wed Jun 24 06:51:31 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, I love close games. I feel more on the edge of my seat when theese games comes to one player only having one bad instance for it all to go south. Fortunately the favored team here won. It was still a happless sort of game for the Padres with the poor hitting and the two infield snafus. A win is a win is a win and that's what we all want overall.   I remember one of the major complaints about Bochy when he was in San Diego involved him leaving players in too long. Fans were critical of him in San Fransisco for the same reasons. He also had this love affair for certain over-the-hill type players like Klesko and Nevin when they really were well past their prime. I guess he showed us  haters these past few years, however.   I think Pat Murphy looks like he'd be one of those ""tough guy"" character actors. You'd recognize the face, and maybe a few shows they've been in but never really the name. He looks like he'd play a role in Boardwalk Empire."
Padres,3axai6,fuckfiend,3,Wed Jun 24 07:00:19 2015 UTC,Goddamn Boardwalk Empire. I wish that shit was still on the air.
Padres,3axai6,Maxwell69,4,Wed Jun 24 08:06:04 2015 UTC,"Got this from the SB Nation Giants site: The game against Despaigne is mainly full of pain.  Kennedy is usually pretty good against the Giants, as I recall. Hopefully he brings his A game tomorrow."
Padres,3axai6,Maxwell69,10,Wed Jun 24 07:05:49 2015 UTC,"Here's another one from the SB Nation Giants site: When I told my grandad who was pitching, his face hardened, he looked into the middle distance, and said quietly, ""…Despaigne."" He said it with the air of a grizzled movie protagonist."
Padres,3axai6,Friard,3,Wed Jun 24 07:09:49 2015 UTC,Hahaha
Padres,3axai6,ZiggyILM,4,Wed Jun 24 07:13:34 2015 UTC,I've missed something... is Cashner really speedy?

Padres,3axai6,BurritoCon,4,Wed Jun 24 13:45:58 2015 UTC,yeah and he loves to run

Padres,3axai6,toferkris,3,Wed Jun 24 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"It was frustrating, but all that matters is that we got the W. Go Pads!"
Padres,3axai6,arvinarvin,3,Wed Jun 24 06:38:08 2015 UTC,It's games like these that make it worth staying up till 2am to watch 'em. Great pitching from both Despaigne and Bum. And our bullpen!  Edit: For clarification; live in FL.
Padres,3axai6,ArchonofFail,3,Wed Jun 24 07:06:07 2015 UTC,"A bit late on this, but Brandon Maurer now has more wins than any of our starters besides Shields, not that wins really matter but it's interesting to note."
Padres,3axai6,violaxcore,2,Wed Jun 24 16:13:20 2015 UTC,Joaquin benoit was mlb wins leader for like a week or two at the start of the season
Padres,3axai6,Loyal_Padre,3,Wed Jun 24 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Great win, the umpire was horrible. Posey was working him all game. We really need to put the ball in play more and cut down on the strike outs, although the umpire wasn't helping us at all last night. Derek Norris needs some more rest."
Padres,3axai6,Maxwell69,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:02:02 2015 UTC,I agree about Norris needing more rest. I posted something from the A's SB Nation site a couple of weeks ago about Norris dropping off in the last couple of months in last season. The guess is it was because of fatigue so I would like to give him more days off throughout the season instead of running him into the ground.
Padres,3axai6,Loyal_Padre,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's been great for us this year, but he hasn't been as good lately I think around .150 the past 15 games with about a 35% K Rate. I know Black played him a lot because he was trying to keep his job, but catchers need rest more than any other position player. They have to force Norris to rest, because he won't want out of the game if you leave the decision up to him. Still nice to see him get that hustle double to spark the 11th inning rally."
Padres,3axai6,we_are_all_turtles,4,Wed Jun 24 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry Kemp isn't producing, thank you for winning though."
Padres,3axai6,PsychicWarElephant,3,Wed Jun 24 06:31:36 2015 UTC,Dudes got a cannon and for his lack of hitting is still fired up. I love him.
Padres,3axai6,Maxwell69,2,Wed Jun 24 14:47:50 2015 UTC,Giants fans from the SB Nation thread were saying they saw stuff on the brim of Kimbrel's cap. Anyone else see this?
Padres,3axai6,BobTaco,5,Wed Jun 24 07:47:47 2015 UTC,Yea...the damn worn spot from grabbing it before every pitch. It does look a bit shinny but that's because it's on a dark surface.
Padres,3axai6,PsychicWarElephant,3,Wed Jun 24 07:53:19 2015 UTC,It's most likely oil buildup from his hand that's why it's shinny
Padres,3axai6,BobTaco,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:44:59 2015 UTC,That and spit from licking his fingers before every pitch.
Padres,3axai6,couchmeister,4,Wed Jun 24 20:37:22 2015 UTC,It's rosin + saliva. He always licks his fingers and wipes them on the brim of his cap. He had the same spot his whole time on the Braves too.
Padres,3axai6,Friard,2,Wed Jun 24 15:53:26 2015 UTC,Maurer and Ninja with clutch performances

Padres,3as3c0,broskiumenyiora,6,Tue Jun 23 01:40:51 2015 UTC,"I like the lineup choices, and I think it's an improvement.   That said, the one spot that I would change is Kemp in the 2 hole. His K rate historically and this especially is not that great. He's got a 23.7% K rate per Fangraphs. Aside from his lack of speed and proclivity to hit into double-plays, he could be a rally killer with that K-rate.   I'd rather have him in the 5 hole and switch him with Solarte who has a 11.7% K rate and can make more contact, move runners into scoring position and less likely to hit into double-plays or swing-and-miss strike-out throw-them-out plays with a runner on first."
Padres,3as3c0,b4sunryze,3,Tue Jun 23 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you said.  Then again, I also agree with a lot of the contradictory ideas submitted to this sub as well.

Padres,3as3c0,UserDrew,3,Tue Jun 23 05:20:56 2015 UTC,"Kemp has a .283 OBP and has grounded into 7 double plays (Tied for most on team with Alonso). Norris has a .299 OBP. Having 2 guys with a OBP under .300 at the top of the lineup is very bad.    I could see Alonso leading off as he can get on base, but then you have to follow him up with someone like Venable or Barmes. A big issue is that no one is drawing walks this season outside of Alonso and Upton."
Padres,3as3c0,SportsMind,2,Tue Jun 23 08:01:22 2015 UTC,"They have those OBPs now, sure, but I would suggest that their career numbers hold more predictive value than their numbers this season, as this season's number are more prone to statistical variation."

Padres,3as3c0,banksy_,2,Tue Jun 23 19:22:20 2015 UTC,"Ill give this a shot too, see if we can agree on some things.  1) OBP Guy, gets on base most often. One of the best 3 hitters on the team.  Y. Alonso (Myers when healthy)  2) Should be better than your 3 hitter, because he comes up in the situations about as important as the #3 guy, just more often. High OPB is a plus, and he should also be one of our best 3 hitters.   D. Norris (Yonder when Wil Myers is back)  3)Because he comes to bat so often with two outs and no runners on base, the #3 hitter isn't nearly as important as we think. This is a spot to fill after more important spots are taken care of.  M. Kemp (Same when Wil gets back)  4) The Book says the #4 hitter comes to bat in the most important situations out of all nine spots, but is equal in importance to the #2 hole once you consider the #2 guy receives more plate appearances. The cleanup hitter is the best hitter on the team with power.  J. Upton (Same when Wil comes back)  5) The Book says the #5 guy can provide more value than the #3 guy with singles, doubles, triples, and walks, and avoiding outs, although the #3 guy holds an advantage with home runs. After positions #1, #2, and #4 are filled, put your next best hitter here, unless he lives and dies with the long ball  Solarte or Spangy, whichever the matchup on a given day favors. (Norris when Wil gets back)  6-9) Spots 6-9 basically are filled out in decreasing order of skill but with a caveat. Stolen bases are most valuable ahead of high-contact singles hitters, who are more likely to hit at the bottom of the lineup. So a base-stealing threat who doesn't deserve a spot higher in the lineup is optimized in the #6 hole, followed by the singles hitters.  6) M. Upton for his prowess on the base paths (Solarte or spangy when Wil is back)   7) Middlebrooks  8) SS Spot  9) Pitcher"

I think Spangy is a key piece for the offense though, sort of a Myers type player, but has been struggling at the plate. Venable is obviously an upgrade over Kemp but I dont see them benching him anytime soon, so I was trying to be realistic."
Padres,3as3c0,banksy_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:32:21 2015 UTC,"You told us you wanted to go max defense, then gave us a batting lineup. At least include which positions they're going to play. Like Norris and Hedges, who catches? then the other is a defensive liability. Barmes and Ninja? They both play SS. I'm all for new and fresh ideas, but I am not in favor of this."
Padres,3as3c0,Friard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:16:17 2015 UTC,"Ninja at second, Norris at first I think u can figure out the rest"
Padres,3as3c0,banksy_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"Norris has 1 career start at 1st, to suggest he is better defensively than Alonso would be a reach. For no other reason than we cant draw conclusions on if D-No is a better defender at first yet."
Padres,3as3c0,Friard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:24:07 2015 UTC,"Hes not a better than Alonso, but I think it would be wise to give Hedges some starts at catcher to give Norris rest ."

Padres,3as3c0,Friard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:38:09 2015 UTC,Why i would put him at first. Keep him in the lineup without having to play catcher.
Padres,3as3c0,banksy_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"That isnt rest. 1st baseman dont play more games per year than any other position, so I dont think it would be a reach to say its just as taxing playing 1st as it is catcher. Maybe not specifically on the knees, but on your whole body, sure."
Padres,3as3c0,Friard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"To say playing first is as taxing is a reach. A giant one. Catcher is the most taxing thing you can do besides starting pitching. Youre involved on every pitch, its not even close. 1st is one of the least taxing. Its why the Giants want to start giving Posey starts at first, to prolong his career."
Padres,3as3c0,banksy_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:08:19 2015 UTC,"Then why don't first baseman need less rest? Everyone gets about the same amount of rest in term of games played. (or not played, depending on how you'd like to look at it)"

Padres,3arkjq,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with alot of this post. Fielding has a lot to do with the teams' pitching struggles.  However there are players on the team who can field well. Take Kemp out of RF and replace him with Venable and suddenly the outfield is well above average. Put Barmes at short and Ninja at 2B and the infield is servicable at worst. I think its a matter of trading off defensive value at the expense of offensive production. So I dont agree the flaw is a ""Fatal"" one. I also dont agree that the Padres have been ""lucky"" when it comes to their offensive production. They have played the most difficult schedule in the league."
Padres,3aqzhp,sdgrifter,19,Mon Jun 22 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, our pitching has been atrocious that's resulted in most of our loses this team is better than last year's offensively no doubt. As for all trades only time will tell but I can guarantee that guys like Maybin and pederson will greatly degress   Edit:fuck grandal guy is no stud I don't wanna hear that again"
Padres,3aqzhp,thewhiteman80,5,Mon Jun 22 21:16:29 2015 UTC,"Maybin is probably playing over his head but I feel Jace Peterson is playing pretty much at his talent level. He plays strong defense and gets on base a lot with little power. That's what he did all the way through the minors. As for Grandal, whether you like him or not he is undoubtedly talented. I understand the team's desire to unload him but I'm not sure the Kemp deal was the best way to do it."

Padres,3aqzhp,JolIyJack,2,Tue Jun 23 03:22:58 2015 UTC,Different management man
Padres,3aqzhp,thewhiteman80,10,Mon Jun 22 21:50:03 2015 UTC,"There are a couple problems with what you've presented:  1) hindsight bias  There is absolutely no way we could have expected Cameron Maybin to stay healthy, for example. Similar story for Yasmani Grandal, but add ""stay off the juice"" in there. In addition, nobody expected our team to perform this poorly. Our pitchers are largely suffering from outrageous FB/HR rates.  Some of the younger we gave up weren't really on scouts' radars as highly-ranked, star/starter-potential players. There are plenty of things that we couldn't have seen coming. And, all of us were absolutely stoked when all of these trades happened, so it wouldn't really be fair to pin it all on AJP.  2) small sample size  Not enough has really happened to call these trades busts. No way Kemp should hit as poorly as he has for a full season. No way Kimbrel maintains an ERA over 3 for a full season. Myers could have his bone spur removed and have great health for years. Frankly, I don't pin our pitching issues on Norris. And, a lot of the stats you posted are from the minors, which should really be taken with a grain of salt for now. Keep in mind Jedd Gyorko was a beast in the minors (career .319/.385/.529 slash) and hasn't really produced in the majors (not to say he couldn't, eventually, but just to say minors numbers don't mean enough yet). And, on the opposite side of the Kemp/Kimbrel point, there's not really any reason to presume that Cam, Jace, etc will continue at this pace.  In sum, it's too soon to call all these moves a loss. And, even if they end up being a loss, let's not pretend that we didn't love these moves before. None of us predicted this nightmare. Sure, maybe we were slightly worried about missing a few prospects, but NOBODY thought we'd be pining for Maybin or Jace and frightened at the thought of Kemp stepping up to the plate or Kimbrel taking the mound. Besides, we have the chips to reverse the loss of prospects, so let's see what AJP has in mind at the trade deadline. Who knows, between the draft and the trade deadline, AJP could give our farm system a complete makeover. We still have good individual talent whose value could pay dividends that we may not see just yet."
Padres,3aqzhp,broskiumenyiora,2,Mon Jun 22 21:13:08 2015 UTC,"Maybins regression has already started, look for his numbers to decline"
Padres,3aqzhp,Friard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:03:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry but, how is half a season a small sample size?"
Padres,3aqzhp,juanpapi,4,Tue Jun 23 03:08:13 2015 UTC,"Well, half the people on that list haven't spent the entire season in the majors. In addition, you might be surprised as to what constitutes a good sample size. Honestly, even a full season can experience quite a bit of variation. 1000+ ABs (holding things like health, etc. constant) would be ideal. The more the merrier. So, in sum, it'll take a little while before we can really say, definitively, who won and who didn't... Unless of course the Braves win the WS on the backs of Wisler, Maybin, and Jace, but that's unlikely."
Padres,3aqzhp,broskiumenyiora,4,Tue Jun 23 03:55:07 2015 UTC,"The sample size is way too small, and it is way too short of a time period for all the prospects.  We didn't have a particularly well regarded farm system: deep, but really lacking top end talent.  And we have basically proven to be worthless at drafting and developing talent; consider the short list of impact position players from the last decade or so: Chase Headley, Kalil Greene and Will Venable are pretty much it.  Peavy and Latos represent the bulk of the production for home grown pitching.  And then you factor in the Tommy-John-aggedon we've had.  We had all these great 'prospects', and no talent at the MLB level.  And we routinely got nothing meaningful at the MLB from these prospects.  So I was ok we traded two in the bush for one in the hand.  Trea Turner might be a stud, but Wil Myers IS a stud right now.  The guy the Royals drafted with the James Shields pitch might be amazing, but the smart money is on him amassing less career WAR than Shields will in this season alone (shockingly few picks every make it to the show, and even fewer spend any meaningful time there).  The one thing that has worked though, is the team is interesting again, you care to watch, you don't give up on a 2-0 game in the 5th like we used to.  This has been a very Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde team, and it's been intriguing to watch.  Maybe the most startling thing is how the pitching has basically collapsed (at least compared to recent performances) despite largely remaining intact while adding Shields, Maurer and Kimbrel.  Maybe Eric Stults was the glue?"
Padres,3aqzhp,anoff,2,Mon Jun 22 21:57:57 2015 UTC,Stauffer was always reliable. Wanted to resign him but noone thought the bullpen would be this bad.
Padres,3aqzhp,Friard,2,Tue Jun 23 02:06:50 2015 UTC,Stauffer was amazing! That was horrible trade.
Padres,3aqzhp,betonthis1,6,Tue Jun 23 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"Today we are 34-38  Last year on june 22, we were 32-44. (Josh byrnes was fired on that day).  So yeah, we're probably better. That's without the caveat of having one of the hardest schedules in the first two months of the season, and the past week of probably weird morale/mental states following buddy's firing and basically everyone slumping but Barmerista"
Padres,3aqzhp,violaxcore,5,Mon Jun 22 20:43:37 2015 UTC,I agree that the Padres MLB team is better. It's more exciting than it has been in years. I guess the part that worries me the most is the next few years. Padres emptied the minor-league cupboards and took on huge contracts and a one-year rental in hopes that this would be the year. I just hope it didn't ruin the chance for long-term success.
Padres,3aqzhp,violaxcore,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"The salary contracts are interestings, in that we took a lot of money, but im not entirely sure what exactly is the upper limit for spending for the current ownership."
Padres,3aqzhp,betonthis1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:40:30 2015 UTC,Last year we were hardly ever blown out in runs scored against us. Never at the degree of this year. But to me it seems like its across the board with all teams when we see the spread in runs by the other team. Weird how this is playing out.
Padres,3aqzhp,rowbearski,3,Tue Jun 23 14:11:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that Preller used assets others valued more than he did to us competitive this year and put us in place to get better via the draft.   The Padres will probably never be a major player in the FA market, but with the right mix of draft luck (which we have never had) and free agent pick ups you can win titles.   Look at how the Cardinals have built their organization. They draft well, keep those guys together and they just produce. They'll make trades for Superstars, i.e. Holiday and Hayward but they also develop amazing talent and depth.  That's what I believe Preller wants to build. Yes expectations were raised this year to a level we haven't seen in a LONG time but I think Preller has a plan that Ownership has bought into. Time will tell but for the first time I feel like even through the bad times, we have a path thru the darkness.  In AJ We Trust"
Padres,3aqzhp,HeadleysHobos,2,Mon Jun 22 21:13:36 2015 UTC,"At this point, I still say yes. Still not big enough samples to say that any of those trades were successes or failures, we don't know if guys that we got or gave up will keep up the numbers they have put up so far. I still take an Upton, Myers, Kemp, Venable outfield over Smith, Maybin, Quentin, Venable, anyday. Slumps and injuries are something every team has to deal with and we still have a better record than last year. Expectations are high, as they should be after such an offseason, so it frustrates everyone more when we don't perform to expectations.   The organization as a whole? I don't think we'll really know for a few years. But as right now I'd say we are a better major league team than a year ago."
Padres,3aqzhp,juanpapi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"Mmm yes and no.       In theory, yes we are better because Middlebrooks, Kemp , Myers , pitching staff ( starters and bullpen) , coaching, etc, underachieving at the same time were not expected at all, we fantasized about the the best case scenario were everyone played to its full potential and created very high expectations given the talent we know this team has.  I really don't think that Norris is completely responsible for the pitching fiasco, a pitcher should be as good regardless of the catcher,  you should not be an MLB pitcher if your performance depends on the person behind home plate.     No, we are not better , but that is because so many pieces broke at the same time (batting, pitching, defense , coaching), this was unexpected but is the current reality. Although the talent is still there is just EXTREMELY UNREALISTIC to think that all pieces altogether will perform as expected for a very very long time. To contend we don't need two or three players to  play well form time to time, we need the coaching staff to put their shit together and everyone to comeback ( and we know Myers wont by default) and play to their full potential on a regular basis otherwise it's just to late.     With that being said, Under the base case scenario being the team performing very well on every stage of the game like we know they are capable of, yes we are a better team following this off season, but at this point of the season we are not, and I don't see it possible to be turned around."

What's more, I love Norris, but I have to ask, is some of this his pitch management?    What I do know is even if we did make a better team this season, so did the Dodgers and Giants. There is no reason for the D Backs to be ahead of us. None."
Padres,3aqzhp,violaxcore,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"Last year, Norris's catcher's ERA was 3.14 (Oakland's overal ERA was 3.22).  This year it's 4.21 (San Diego overall ERA, 4.11).  Derek Norris was still a bad pitch framer last year, so I do think that factor is a bit overrated. Defense is definitely a factor for pitching, as is the quality of pitchers themselves.

But then again, the team had been essentially the same the last few years with little to no improvement.  With management change (namely the GM), the Padres felt like they couldn't stay the same anymore and so they took a risk.  And with the risk, I see our offense certainly improved (although it doesn't seem like that lately).  Pitching regressed though, which really disappoints me.  Overall, I'd say we're better, but not by much.  Pitching certainly has to improve for us to be competitive and I'm sure Darren Balsley, who's been w/ the team for a long time, has not given up on improving them."

We are four games ahead of the abysmal Rockies, we were supposed to be fending off the Dodgers and looking to make a run at the division. We will be lucky if we take 3rd at this rate.  I am tired of justifying my sentences with ""I am a fan, but..."" I dont give a shit anymore. Start winning and stop fucking around.

Padres,3amonb,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Sun Jun 21 19:38:31 2015 UTC,LOL
Padres,3amonb,CameraInstructor,4,Sun Jun 21 21:18:26 2015 UTC,The Padres will forever regret trading Anthony Rizzo.
Padres,3amonb,CameraInstructor,0,Sun Jun 21 20:49:39 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I have a feeling we are going to feel that way about most of the trades we have made recently. Except the Norris trade.
Padres,3amonb,Sane_Wicked,3,Sun Jun 21 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"Second inning and I'm already not paying attention to the game. Go padres, but quit digging yourselves such an early hole"
Padres,3amonb,kensal78,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:06:16 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, it's only the second inning. Plenty of time to rebound. Whereas if this was a 7 run 8th I'd be much more depressed."

Padres,3amonb,Friard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:02:48 2015 UTC,We gave up Rizzo for this shit
Padres,3amonb,gshortelljr,3,Sun Jun 21 20:45:54 2015 UTC,Fuck these piece of shit umps. It should be 0-0 if they weren't garbage.
Padres,3amonb,Padreschargers7,2,Sun Jun 21 20:56:04 2015 UTC,"Besides that throwing error, typical Cashner inning."
Padres,3amonb,rurounijosie,2,Sun Jun 21 20:46:26 2015 UTC,Defense makes an error and Cashner has a fit. What's new.
Padres,3amonb,n0teye,2,Sun Jun 21 20:51:14 2015 UTC,"7 more innings, just gotta get our shit together, don't lose faith"
Padres,3amonb,mikeb3rd96,2,Sun Jun 21 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"What if Pat Murphy just stock piles all the 2010ish Sun Devils like Sogard, Wallace, and Davis and starts piling up wins?"

Padres,3amonb,Friard,2,Sun Jun 21 21:53:21 2015 UTC,So disappointing that their only runs came in a single inning.
Padres,3amonb,JOE619,3,Sun Jun 21 22:32:44 2015 UTC,How long is it going to take to pull Cash from our rotation? He's had enough chances. He'd be better suited in the pen as a MR or LR... ffs.
Padres,3amonb,FalconTI,2,Sun Jun 21 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"Out at home. Strike 3 to the pitcher. But whatever hey it only cost us 4 runs, blue."
Padres,3amonb,PanicAtTheSisqo,2,Sun Jun 21 20:49:57 2015 UTC,This is just fuckin stupid.
Padres,3amonb,FalconTI,2,Sun Jun 21 20:50:11 2015 UTC,Cashner is probably the worst player at dealing with stress. He pitches well until he gets into trouble and then falls apart.
Padres,3amonb,folettary,-1,Sun Jun 21 20:56:46 2015 UTC,He doesn't have enough faith in our fielders to not make an error while he's pitching.
Padres,3amonb,JanitorOfSanDiego,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"Really though, do you blame him?"
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:59:42 2015 UTC,Fielding has been bad but he has to make his pitches. Hitting the pitcher to force in a run is just garbage pitching.
Padres,3amonb,folettary,2,Sun Jun 21 21:00:24 2015 UTC,BULL SHIT. He came off the bag with the tag still on. This is fucking atrocious.
Padres,3amonb,EnervateYou,5,Sun Jun 21 20:57:25 2015 UTC,3 blown calls in an inning. Pure garbage.

Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,4,Sun Jun 21 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"Pitching isn't good, fielding isn't good, umps aren't good."
Padres,3amonb,JanitorOfSanDiego,6,Sun Jun 21 20:59:52 2015 UTC,I have a hard time believing we should blame 7 runs on the umps.
Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,2,Sun Jun 21 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"More of a combination of pitching, fielding and umps"
Padres,3amonb,JOE619,2,Sun Jun 21 21:01:07 2015 UTC,That's why I included the pitching and fielding. Two challenge plays should have gone out way.
Padres,3amonb,JanitorOfSanDiego,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:01:21 2015 UTC,:( our fielding. How many of the 7 were unearned?
Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:05:43 2015 UTC,4 unearned runs
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,0,Sun Jun 21 21:08:25 2015 UTC,You're right
Padres,3amonb,herecomesjonny,0,Sun Jun 21 21:10:31 2015 UTC,Poor cash.
Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,0,Sun Jun 21 21:17:49 2015 UTC,I wanna say 3. Bad throw by middlebrooks scored 1 and barmes let one through the 5 hole that scored 2
Padres,3amonb,herecomesjonny,0,Sun Jun 21 21:07:57 2015 UTC,That's more aggravating than ump calls. Unearned runs are our own fault. :(
Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:19:58 2015 UTC,The inning was lengthened because of them you could say
Padres,3amonb,jbraun04,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, only so much blame can be placed on the umps. Bad fielding, and Cash not being able to bounce back is what I have to blame"
Padres,3amonb,thefeistygoat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"It should be 0-0, umps blew 2 calls, both of which should have gotten us an out. A shitty ball call on a 3-2 count, a terrible call at the plate, and an awful call on a steal of second(after it was 7-0)."
Padres,3amonb,Padreschargers7,0,Sun Jun 21 21:01:50 2015 UTC,Cory Spangenberg is my spirit animal.
Padres,3amonb,Padreschargers7,2,Sun Jun 21 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"They send Gyorko down for poor performance, maybe Cashner needs a stint in the minors too"

Padres,3amonb,jbraun04,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:39:18 2015 UTC,I think Cashner is a sleeper agent for our rivals.
Padres,3amonb,Strike3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:41:09 2015 UTC,Is that an earned run?

Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:47:56 2015 UTC,Awful fucking call he was out.
Padres,3amonb,Friard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:46:19 2015 UTC,Getting squeezed and getting fucked by that replay
Padres,3amonb,jbraun04,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:46:42 2015 UTC,Gonna be one of those games. Cash cannot catch a break
Padres,3amonb,Friard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:46:59 2015 UTC,For Fuck sake
Padres,3amonb,thefeistygoat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"Cashner definitely hasn't had a great inning pitching-wise, but the two errors certainly aren't helping either. This is a joint effort.   Edit: oh and let's them the officials in there."

Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,0,Sun Jun 21 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"Erlin for Cashner.  Does anyone know if Cash is liked in the club house? I have a theory that his lack of offensive support could be correlated to his club house reputation. I mean, this isn't the first year the team hasn't scored runs for him. I just don't know what else it could be."
Padres,3amonb,jasonwhatis,8,Sun Jun 21 21:28:53 2015 UTC,I don't think hitters try more/less to score runs for pitchers they favor lol. They're all fighting for jobs
Padres,3amonb,jbraun04,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:30:24 2015 UTC,Well.. Maybe it a sub conscious thing. Shields get a ton of support and he's well liked within the club house. Maybe people just don't get up for games Cash pitches in.  Probably BS idea... But don't know how this team doesn't score for the guy year in/year out.
Padres,3amonb,jasonwhatis,2,Sun Jun 21 21:32:53 2015 UTC,i think teams feed off confidence and Cash hasnt shown much this year
Padres,3amonb,Friard,2,Sun Jun 21 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"Cash seems like a good guy, just with shit luck when it comes to fielding and run support."
Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:32:00 2015 UTC,I haven't heard anything to the contrary with Cash. Just a crazy idea.
Padres,3amonb,jasonwhatis,2,Sun Jun 21 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"i think erlin is struggling in AAA, still its worth a shot. maybe Balsley can work on some mechanics"
Padres,3amonb,Friard,2,Sun Jun 21 21:33:27 2015 UTC,I was curious myself so I looked it up. Baseball reference has his era at 5.72 at AAA.
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:34:17 2015 UTC,"Leubke should be next in line, he's looked decent in rehab."
Padres,3amonb,Sane_Wicked,2,Sun Jun 21 22:14:38 2015 UTC,My understanding is that he has had three starts but pitched three innings and will be used as a reliever upon returning. Which is understandable given the back to back TJ surgeries.
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"Hasnt pitched a lot of innings though, it looks like he is headed to bullpen"
Padres,3amonb,Friard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:17:18 2015 UTC,"They've been saying that he's headed to the pen (although that was before Murphy but I'd be surprised if he changes that). Probably for the best, less innings for him, less Garces against LHB."
Padres,3amonb,HeadleysHobos,0,Mon Jun 22 00:02:23 2015 UTC,Cashner is doing this to himself
Padres,3amonb,gshortelljr,2,Sun Jun 21 20:44:19 2015 UTC,Hitting the pitcher is bad but middlebrookes fucked up an inning ending double play.
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,0,Sun Jun 21 20:46:54 2015 UTC,Did Middlebrooks walk two?
Padres,3amonb,gshortelljr,2,Sun Jun 21 20:48:20 2015 UTC,You are missing the point.
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,0,Sun Jun 21 20:54:51 2015 UTC,Cash needs to figure out how to get locked in again. He's better than this performance...
Padres,3amonb,BobTaco,6,Sun Jun 21 22:04:20 2015 UTC,They just said he's the victim of league leading 19 unearned runs. Much of this year's outcome isn't his fault.
Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,2,Sun Jun 21 22:18:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I know not all the 7 runs were his fault...and he has had crappy luck, but he still isn't dialed in as he can be. That could be because the bad luck won't let him find a groove. Who knows."
Padres,3amonb,BobTaco,2,Mon Jun 22 05:19:45 2015 UTC,Look at the Cincy game. 7 earned runs but defense failed him. Venable misplayed multiple line drives. Pop ups fell between everyone. The dude has rotten luck but is also putting plenty on base
Padres,3amonb,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:29:01 2015 UTC,I see those defensive miscues in my nightmares. I can't imagine what it is like for Venable. Hopefully that was a lesson learned.
Padres,3amonb,friarfangirl,4,Thu Jun 25 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"He only gave up 4 hits, the start was bad but not 7 runs bad."

Padres,3amonb,gshortelljr,-1,Sun Jun 21 21:10:06 2015 UTC,How many more games are we gonna let cashner start
Padres,3amonb,ectric,2,Sun Jun 21 21:06:23 2015 UTC,Who would you suggest replace him?
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,-1,Sun Jun 21 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"Colin Rea has been very good in AA. 10 starts, 61 IP, with a 1.18 ERA. He only has a 7.8 K/9, but his WHIP is .820"
Padres,3amonb,violaxcore,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:21:54 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty reasonable suggestion. Any idea how Erlin has been doing?
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,2,Sun Jun 21 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"Erlin has been pretty bad, I believe."
Padres,3amonb,Padreschargers7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:30:25 2015 UTC,Give Rea some seasoning in AAA and then we can take a look at him.
Padres,3amonb,Sane_Wicked,-2,Sun Jun 21 22:15:54 2015 UTC,Literally anybody
Padres,3amonb,megustanlosyogapants,5,Sun Jun 21 21:11:59 2015 UTC,I think Cory Mazzoni proves why that won't necessarily be better.
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,-2,Sun Jun 21 21:12:54 2015 UTC,Like cashners any better at this point?
Padres,3amonb,megustanlosyogapants,0,Sun Jun 21 21:14:14 2015 UTC,Not sure if you noticed but most of those runs are not due to Cashner.
Padres,3amonb,ColLeslieHapHapablap,-1,Sun Jun 21 21:56:12 2015 UTC,Didnt say they were. Im talking about the 2-8 record and era over 4 and the general lack of confidence most of us seem to have whenever he takes the mound this year
Padres,3amonb,megustanlosyogapants,0,Sun Jun 21 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"Didnt say they were. Im talking about the 2-8 record adn era over 4   So was I(talking about his 2-8 record).  Cashner has been decent with crazy bad luck.  Has he been as solid as last season?  No, but with pitiful run support, terrible calls and general bad luck he's had tough outings.  Nobody can replace him at this point and I seem to remember people calling for Kennedy's head 3 weeks ago.  Relax, have a beer, enjoy the show."
Padres,3amonb,ColLeslieHapHapablap,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"Make a trade or something, luebke is on his way back but he probably projects to be a RP at this point"
Padres,3amonb,Friard,0,Sun Jun 21 21:14:18 2015 UTC,making a trade would make sense but from everything you read right now most teams are still hesitant to make trades cause a lot still don't know if they are buyers or sellers.
Padres,3amonb,gstutz176,-1,Sun Jun 21 21:26:33 2015 UTC,Hopefully we can get luebke johnson kelly and morrow back in our rotation at some point this year
Padres,3amonb,megustanlosyogapants,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:19:15 2015 UTC,I know they are all injury prone but I expected at least ONE to be somewhat healthy during the season. Morrow was maybe our best pitcher while healthy
Padres,3amonb,Friard,0,Sun Jun 21 21:25:05 2015 UTC,Kelly?  Ummm no.
Padres,3amonb,Ifuckjesus,0,Sun Jun 21 22:13:50 2015 UTC,Casey kelly. Not shawn kelly
Padres,3amonb,megustanlosyogapants,0,Sun Jun 21 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Luebke will be headed back to the pen unless something drastic happens. I'd like to see Kelly back though, he's not far off either."
Padres,3amonb,spamolas,0,Sun Jun 21 21:36:42 2015 UTC,Luebke could be a much needed lefty in a righty dominant rotation though
Padres,3amonb,megustanlosyogapants,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"That's a good point but also unlikely, they want to keep his innings down after 2 TJs."

Padres,3aoogs,619Haida,21,Mon Jun 22 06:30:13 2015 UTC,Fire Kotsay after he's been the hitting coach for like 3 months? Oooook
Padres,3aoogs,Strike3,14,Mon Jun 22 07:01:12 2015 UTC,He has no options ergo can't be sent down without being DFA'd
Padres,3aoogs,pad_squad,10,Mon Jun 22 06:49:43 2015 UTC,He's literally not allowed to. Players that have been in the league for a certain amount of years can't go down. Only can be dropped or traded
Padres,3aoogs,Go_Home_Please,8,Mon Jun 22 06:38:05 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have any minor-league options. He's an all-star caliber player, going through a slump. You don't send a guy like that down. Even if we could/did, we don't have anyone better to replace him with."
Padres,3aoogs,MrDL104,4,Mon Jun 22 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"IMO Gyorko looked like a superstar next to the Pads team 2013-14, because it was a squad of mostly substandard hitters. It's easy to look pretty when you are standing next to a bunch of ugly people."
Padres,3aoogs,Sbtoby,2,Mon Jun 22 15:19:55 2015 UTC,And hitting 23 hrs as a second baseman
Padres,3aoogs,PsychicWarElephant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:51:14 2015 UTC,2 years ago. Last 2 years hitting .210. He is a serviceable off the bench utility player on any other team.
Padres,3aoogs,Sbtoby,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"hey i'm certainly not arguing, but he looked good his rookie year because he played well, his rookie year.  I am not a fan of his by any means. merely statign that he didn't look good just because the rest of the team was terrible."
Padres,3aoogs,PsychicWarElephant,2,Wed Jun 24 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the defense sucks and is taking everything down. Watching the game yesterday and saw those missed balls pitcher was doing his job keeping the balls on the ground , but our  infield sucks big time. That has to be frustrating for the other players seeing that. Black deserves to be gone, we are not even doing the fundamentals right."
Padres,3aoogs,bigBastardDude,4,Mon Jun 22 14:56:21 2015 UTC,"My understanding is Kemp has 10 years MLB service time. I am not certain if it would mean he would be given the chance to be released from his contract, or if it would mean he would get DFA'ed... but from what I have read he can't be sent down solely at the teams discretion."
Padres,3aoogs,Maxwell69,-3,Mon Jun 22 06:39:35 2015 UTC,10 years just means he can't be traded without his consent  EDIT: if he had 10 years of service time he would be protected under 5/10 rights
Padres,3aoogs,pad_squad,3,Mon Jun 22 06:50:46 2015 UTC,He doesn't meet the 5 aspect of that rule. Only way he gets a no trade is through contract.
Padres,3aoogs,front_page_hata,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:14:48 2015 UTC,"right, but i was just replying to maxwell69's argument of 10 years service time which i thought he had but i guess he only has 8"
Padres,3aoogs,pad_squad,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:48:48 2015 UTC,After six years of service time you can decline to be optioned and become a free agent.
Padres,3aoogs,JAYFL,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:24:56 2015 UTC,how does he not meet the 5? 8 years with the dodgers? i could seem not meeting the 10 with only 8.??? years of service.

Padres,3akvhm,Friard,4,Sun Jun 21 05:02:37 2015 UTC,"He has caught for Cashner the most, I believe."
Padres,3akvhm,Maxwell69,4,Sun Jun 21 05:07:40 2015 UTC,hedges has caught both Ross and Cashner 3 times. Which makes sense since they were the ones that pitched to Rene Rivera exclusively.
Padres,3akvhm,Friard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:54:22 2015 UTC,"Actually a lot of those starts were Sunday day games, so I think it was more because of luck of the draw."
Padres,3akvhm,Maxwell69,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:50:46 2015 UTC,"Actually he has started 2 Sundays out of a total of 15 starts, so youre completely wrong. Please never comment on one of my posts again."
Padres,3akvhm,Friard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:40:40 2015 UTC,I made a mistake. You may be correct. Maybe there was something to the number of starts he had with them.
Padres,3akvhm,Maxwell69,4,Mon Jun 22 03:27:01 2015 UTC,"The thing about Cashner is that his 2-8 record could, and should, be way better. While a 4.24 ERA is not ideal, the Padres have had 7 games scoring 2 or fewer runs when Cashner has started. 6 of his losses came when he had an ERA of 3.5 or under. Absolutely awful luck."
Padres,3akvhm,EnervateYou,3,Sun Jun 21 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"Cashner should be used to low scoring games after last year. The stuff is there, he is throwing harder than ever, which is part of the problem. His fastball tends to have more movement at 94-95 and flattens out around 97mph."
Padres,3akvhm,Friard,5,Sun Jun 21 05:27:11 2015 UTC,Fair enough but Shields is 7-1. He has 10 games where his ERA was over  3.5. There have been times where he has been absolutely bailed out by hitting and either get a W or a no decision. Cash just hasn't had the same run support.
Padres,3akvhm,EnervateYou,2,Sun Jun 21 05:36:02 2015 UTC,Norris and Cash were discussing through the last few innings so I suppose he's catching tomorrow.

Padres,3akvhm,BurritoCon,8,Sun Jun 21 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"Barmes needs to start every game at SS. I don't care about lefty, righty, or any of that shit. At this point, he's a way better option than Amarista."
Padres,3akvhm,Creux,7,Sun Jun 21 04:59:59 2015 UTC,"I like this lineup, lets keep it"
Padres,3akvhm,Friard,6,Sun Jun 21 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"Not as strong as Amarista defensively, IMO. His bat has been streaky too but over the past month he's really heated up."
Padres,3akvhm,EnervateYou,4,Sun Jun 21 05:03:04 2015 UTC,It's not like Amarista had a bad night either. Barmes at SS and Amarista at 2nd seems like a good way to keep the hot bats in the lineup.
Padres,3akvhm,violaxcore,4,Sun Jun 21 05:16:32 2015 UTC,Definitely. It's crazy but Amarista has been our best hitter this week and Barmes is right there with him.

Padres,3ajt2n,FriarBot,13,Sat Jun 20 22:05:31 2015 UTC,I was so prejudiced against Barmes coming to the Padres. He was worse then bad with the Pirates and I convinced myself his hitting slashes were the result of the Coorsfield effect. No if he just sort of stays the course I'd give him an underrated player award.
Padres,3ajt2n,UserDrew,5,Sat Jun 20 23:23:30 2015 UTC,yea his veteran presence and solid defense contribute something special to our team
Padres,3ajt2n,asarsfield,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:37:18 2015 UTC,I hope more fans realize his value. He's a necessary addition to this team.

Padres,3ajt2n,EnervateYou,3,Sun Jun 21 04:36:00 2015 UTC,1st RBI? I'm surprised Shields doesn't have any. He swings a better bat than a couple of our position guys.
Padres,3ajt2n,BeerFarts86,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:41:51 2015 UTC,Surprising as he's our best hitting pitcher. He's .206/.206/.235 with 7 hits but no RBIs.

Padres,3ajt2n,PMinisterOfMalaysia,5,Sun Jun 21 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"So I'm still a newer Padres fan so this is a question for you seasoned Padre fans.  What's our history with the Diamondbacks? I went over there and apparently there's no hatred on their end, and it doesn't seem like we hate them at all, but we're division rivals. We see each other each year just as much as we see the Dodgers & the Giants & the Rockies, so why isn't their any sort of rivalry between us and the D-Backs?  Sure some of us call them D-Bags but that seems to be the absolute extent of the hatred. Wasn't there any sort of hatred when Randy Johnson was ripping everyone he met apart? Was there hatred back in '01 when the D-backs got their world series win?  I dunno, I just always felt that if a team is a division rival, then that should like automatically put them in any team's top 5 (or in hockey's case, 6-7) most hated teams. I can understand that they'd be the least hated division rival, but from what I could tell, it almost seems like we treat the D-Backs just like we would with the Cubs or the Red Sox or some other neutral team.   So to repeat the question, do we have any notable historic moments with the Diamondbacks that could be used as evidence of a rivalry? Like how Holliday still hasn't touched home plate with the Rockies, and pretty much everything with the Dodgers & Giants, do we have something like that with the D-Backs?"
Padres,3ajt2n,T-nawtical,6,Sun Jun 21 03:07:30 2015 UTC,In 06 we clinched the division in their ballpark and we didnt celebrate in their pool so its been a pretty friendly rivalry in the short time theyve been around
Padres,3ajt2n,megustanlosyogapants,4,Sun Jun 21 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"dbacks have been pretty bad for awhile so its hard to build a rivarly. Tyson Ross first dominant start was against them, a 8 inning 2 hitter"
Padres,3ajt2n,Friard,6,Sun Jun 21 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"Both teams have had to endure Kevin Towers eras so mutual respect? Hard to have a rivalry when you have the pieces of crap LA Dodgers in the same division. Padres fans don't come to Chase and act obnoxious.  Dbacks fans likely don't even go to Petco. Both teams really haven't been ""good"" at the same time."
Padres,3ajt2n,SportsMind,5,Sun Jun 21 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"I think that actually makes the most sense because I was gonna say ""Oh the D-backs haven't always been terrible! They had the Randy Johnson era!"" but that was during the early & mid 2000's when we weren't really that great, and we had the Tony Gwynn era and {I'm not to up to date on my Diamondback franchise history but I'm going to assume that...} the Diamondbacks must not have been that great back then?   And when I went over to /r/azdiamondbacks pretty much all I said was fuck the Dodgers and they just about made me an honorary member of the sub. So they pretty much hate the Dodgers as much as we do."
Padres,3ajt2n,T-nawtical,4,Sun Jun 21 03:16:17 2015 UTC,The Diamondbacks missed out on the Tony Gwynn era as they didn't become a team until 1998. They quickly got good in '99 but at that point Gwynn was in the middle of his last AS season.
Padres,3ajt2n,SportsMind,5,Sun Jun 21 03:19:28 2015 UTC,They've been pretty bad and as far as I can tell their fan base isn't annoying to deal with or douchey like the Doyer fans that I can't stand
Padres,3ajt2n,SdBolts4,3,Sun Jun 21 03:11:47 2015 UTC,"I think for me, since they came into the league i dont think we both have had good teams in the same season, so not really a lot of important games between the two"
Padres,3ajt2n,herecomesjonny,3,Sun Jun 21 03:12:05 2015 UTC,I can't really hate them even when they had that ws year I liked them kinda. My order of hate goes like this in the nl west.   1.doyers -umm worst fans in baseball and they spend more money than the fucking Yankees need I say more?  2.giants - cocky snobby fans and they're fucking good  3.Colorado - the whole home plate thing  4.D backs - just by default
Padres,3ajt2n,thewhiteman80,3,Sun Jun 21 03:21:52 2015 UTC,That's accurate
Padres,3ajt2n,JOE619,5,Sun Jun 21 03:44:36 2015 UTC,I didn't really expect Barmes and Venable to be on the better half of our hitting lineup this season haha

Padres,3ajt2n,thewhiteman80,7,Sat Jun 20 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"Wins cure all but I think we had very high expectations for Matt, and he is not even serviceable at the moment. Hurts us badly to have him ""stuck"" in the middle of the lineup."
Padres,3ajt2n,sneakAstroke,3,Sun Jun 21 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"Considering how much he's getting paid, how long we're stuck with him, and what we gave up to get him, I have to think the answer would still be ""a lot""."

Padres,3ajt2n,Sane_Wicked,5,Sat Jun 20 22:16:47 2015 UTC,Have to give Norris a blow behind the plate. You'd pick his bat against a lefty over Alonso. Alonso will probably come into the game later for defense.

Padres,3agnne,sjj342,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:45:24 2015 UTC,Consistent offense.  Jace Peterson couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat when he was with the Padres.
Padres,3agnne,gstutz176,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"that's because they sporadically started him while moving him all over the field and all over the lineup (58 PA in 27 G, with a ridiculously unlucky .171 BABIP no less)... his minor league offense was consistent, and that minor league BB% to K%, that's what the Padres have been missing for ages"
Padres,3agnne,sjj342,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:45:20 2015 UTC,"And to add to your point. Not only was he not given opportunities, he was a young guy trying to figure out major league pitching."
Padres,3agnne,TeamATL10,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"When they traded Headley, he probably should've started every day for the rest of the season at 3B (or 2B with Gyorko shifting back to 3B)...playing Solarte so much was pointless. And they really should've traded at least Benoit and Kennedy last year for middle IF prospects. A guy like Addison Russell gets moved and he ends up going to your former GM's team."

Padres,3ag87m,espo619,10,Fri Jun 19 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"Im not really seeing a downside to this guy.  Said it before, but the Padres need someone who is going to go out and pick a fight.  Sounds counter intuitive, but you want the guy who is willing to go out there and push the rules of baseball, pitch at people that push your teammates around, and all around play dirty.  Im sort of new to NL baseball, and the Padres fan base, but I have never seen such a cutthroat division, and Im a Boston fan.  All we have to do is worry about the Yankees most years.  Here if its not the Dodgers shitting on you, its the Giants spitting on you and your fanbase.  You want to be competitive in this division?  Its prison rules baseball.  Go out there and find the biggest guy you can find and kick his ass.  Black could not and would not do this, and whether or not Murphy can pull it off is yet to be seen, but after reading this god damn if Im excited."
Padres,3ag87m,kegman83,5,Sat Jun 20 16:34:20 2015 UTC,"I have never seen such a cutthroat division, and Im a Boston fan.   Damn.  Strong words."
Padres,3ag87m,diegobomber,2,Sat Jun 20 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"This is turning into a lost season, so why not??  One of the things I hated about Buddy was that he always wanted to be the friend of the players/first among equals. Murphy definitely does not seem like that. Let's see how some old time managing does for this squad."
Padres,3ag87m,Padreschargers7,2,Sun Jun 21 03:48:06 2015 UTC,"Whether his Padres tenure lasts three and a half months or 10 years, Pat Murphy will be one of the most compelling figures we’ve seen in San Diego.  Compelling. Controversial. Complicated. Charismatic.  That’s Murphy.  He is one of the most polarizing figures you will ever come across. People either love him or hate him. Some see him as a master motivator, others as a master manipulator.  The fascination now that he has become interim manager of the Padres is seeing how Murphy does managing millionaires. It’s not nearly the same as the vice-like grip he had over the lives of 18- to 21-year-olds, whose futures he held in his hands during the 22 years he spent coaching at Notre Dame and Arizona State.  It also will be interesting to see how much Murphy has evolved as a person since he was forced out at ASU six years ago.  In 1997, two years after taking over at ASU, he already had gained a reputation as a win-at-all-costs, take-no-prisoners kind of coach who alienated himself from his Pac-10 peers.  Murphy told Baseball America at the time: “It scares people. I’m so driven. I need to be better at how I handle some things. I’ve handled umpires very poorly. I’ve handled some coaches poorly, because I really don’t have time for the B.S. glad-handling social hour.”  One coach Murphy handled badly was San Diego State’s Tony Gwynn, whose first series as SDSU coach was at Arizona State in 2003. ASU pulled out of its return series to open the 2004 season after Sun Devils closer Ryan Schroyer transferred to SDSU between seasons.  In canceling the series, Murphy said acrimony caused by Schroyer’s transfer could spill out onto the field. Others suggested it was a way for Murphy to get back at Schroyer.  “This is something that’s been mutually agreed upon by both schools,” Murphy said at the time.  Gwynn said nothing could be further from the truth, even flying to Arizona for an unscheduled meeting to discuss the matter.  Murphy was hoping to avoid adverse publicity. In a letter to Gwynn, he wrote: “I would like to put our heads together in handling the media in this situation. We are very aware that ASU could be accused of backing out of the series, and that is something we need to avoid. If we were to deal with that type of scenario in the media, then in fact we would most likely end up not being able to return the trip.”  Gwynn was extremely upset, saying, “I don’t need his help on how to handle the media. I’m trying to be cordial about it. The bottom line is, we’re getting screwed. If our contract had any teeth in it, this wouldn’t have happened. ... He doesn’t care about treating people right and doing the right thing.”  But Murphy’s methods produced results, his teams noted for their hard-nosed, successful play. He guided ASU to a runner-up finish for the 1998 national championship in the first of four trips to Omaha with the Sun Devils.  Murphy had the media eating out of his hand at the 2007 College World Series, conducting some of the more entertaining postgame press conferences anyone could remember.  “Some people read the philosophies of Plato,” Murphy said after an ASU win over UC Irvine. “I read Springsteen. His lyrics are unbelievable.”  Murphy demonstrated by singing “No Surrender.”  It was good stuff. But there were times where Murphy seemed that close to spinning out of control. He called out a reporter in another postgame session, puzzling some in attendance who couldn’t decide if the comments were serious or in jest.  In 2008, Murphy had two of his ASU players — Brett Wallace and Ike Davis —stage a fight before the Super Regionals against Fresno State as a motivational ploy. The NCAA later reprimanded ASU for the incident.  It was another run-in with the NCAA, amid a two-year investigation for recruiting violations and academic fraud, that led to Murphy’s forced resignation a year later.  Murphy has coached minor league teams in the Padres organization the past five years, including the last three seasons at Triple-A.  “The guy’s one of the best leaders I’ve ever met,” said Padres catcher Austin Hedges, who played for Murphy at Triple-A El Paso. “He really motivates. I think he’s a great addition for us.  “The guy knows how to win. He knows how to unite guys and make them play for each other and, ultimately, care about winning ballgames.”  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell, who played for Murphy at Notre Dame and was interested in adding his former coach to the Brewers coaching staff, believes Murphy has mellowed.  Maybe so.  “I realize so much more in hindsight,” Murphy told the Arizona Republic two years ago. “It made me evaluate what my weaknesses are, how a person that is always in control, always on top, sometimes doesn’t take the time to understand so much that’s going on around him. I wasn’t so good at any of that at the beginning, but this has been a great journey for me. It’s made me grow as a man.”  Murphy remains a compelling figure, as Padres fans soon will see."
Padres,3ag87m,Maxwell69,2,Fri Jun 19 22:41:38 2015 UTC,"""He doesn’t care about treating people right and doing the right thing.”  I remember when he left Mazzoni in, people were wondering if he did it to teach Mazonni a lesson, or if he did it to save the bullpen. Some were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he did it to save the bullpen. Now we have some evidence that it is in his history to do things that would hurt others."

Padres,3agex4,Clint_Swift,4,Sat Jun 20 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"Today is the day.  And then tomorrow will be to  And the day after that  But not the day after that  But after that we clean sweep undefeated.  Also, let's kick some poontang"
Padres,3agex4,Clint_Swift,4,Sat Jun 20 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"Weird thing about the lineup--everyone is batting right after their position mirror. 3B/1B, LF/RF, C/CF, 2B/SS, then P. :O  Guys we can't lose we have the beauty of symmetry on our side."
Padres,3agex4,pandajay24,2,Sat Jun 20 01:37:30 2015 UTC,Guys I really like Paul Goldschmidt...
Padres,3agex4,OBEYthesky,3,Sat Jun 20 01:55:48 2015 UTC,He's hard to dislike...unless he ever becomes a Dodger
Padres,3agex4,padsboltssaints15,3,Sat Jun 20 01:59:47 2015 UTC,He is a beast but is by far the most boring human being if you have ever heard him talk.
Padres,3agex4,SportsMind,2,Sat Jun 20 02:09:49 2015 UTC,Would be nice if the Padres could develop a player like that.
Padres,3agex4,JolIyJack,5,Sat Jun 20 02:09:57 2015 UTC,"Come on, this guy's name is RUBBY. Let's embarrass him more with some RBIS!"
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,4,Sat Jun 20 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"Bases loaded and the right Upton brother coming to bat?  Ooohhhhh shiiiit, I can smell something cooking!"
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,4,Sat Jun 20 03:21:05 2015 UTC,"Someone really, really thinks Upton sucks in attendance."
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 03:22:36 2015 UTC,A lot of moronic Diamondbacks fans out there.
Padres,3agex4,SportsMind,5,Sat Jun 20 03:40:19 2015 UTC,I feel like Kemp ALWAYS swings at the low and away balls.
Padres,3agex4,Lefkada,2,Sat Jun 20 03:28:09 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Ryan Howard in that regard
Padres,3agex4,Br1ngTheRayne,4,Sat Jun 20 03:29:05 2015 UTC,The can pitch around Upton and walk him with them loaded to get to Kemp
Padres,3agex4,Flesh_Lettuce,4,Sat Jun 20 03:31:39 2015 UTC,Jeez rally lights may be the stupidest thing of all time.
Padres,3agex4,ImNotTheChris,4,Sat Jun 20 03:43:31 2015 UTC,That was an error.

Padres,3agex4,JOE619,3,Sat Jun 20 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"Oh Friar God, To you I pray, Please give Kemp a motherfucking dinger, Yippity yay hooray.  Amen."
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,4,Sat Jun 20 04:48:24 2015 UTC,Kemp'ed
Padres,3agex4,Lefkada,8,Sat Jun 20 04:49:20 2015 UTC,Look at ninja's average creepin on up. Best hitting relief pitcher in the league.
Padres,3agex4,Beer-tick,3,Fri Jun 19 23:09:00 2015 UTC,He's been hitting pretty well since we played the mets at the beginning of the month. Had a few clutch hits against the Braves too.
Padres,3agex4,gstutz176,3,Sat Jun 20 00:13:12 2015 UTC,D-No really sold out to get that out
Padres,3agex4,Br1ngTheRayne,3,Sat Jun 20 02:44:20 2015 UTC,Hey we won a challenge
Padres,3agex4,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 02:45:36 2015 UTC,I just laughed after that double. Darude playing in chase field. Lol
Padres,3agex4,JasonKesler,3,Sat Jun 20 02:47:52 2015 UTC,Shields balls in the dirt looking like Tyson Ross.
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 02:51:50 2015 UTC,Goodness flippin' gracious.  And this is with Shields on the mound ;__;

Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 03:00:10 2015 UTC,The pitching this year... I remember being soooo excited to add shields to our stellar rotation I probably sound crazy saying that now.

Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 03:26:13 2015 UTC,Hey-Hey-Hey on the board baby!
Padres,3agex4,T-nawtical,3,Sat Jun 20 03:26:53 2015 UTC,Kemps turn?? Oh Jesus. This all started because of shields getting a hit.
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,3,Sat Jun 20 03:27:05 2015 UTC,Doesn't even look like he was trying
Padres,3agex4,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Sat Jun 20 03:30:28 2015 UTC,I think he's trying to hard..
Padres,3agex4,herecomesjonny,3,Sat Jun 20 03:33:07 2015 UTC,They play Peaches in the stadium there?  I'm kind of liking their music choices.
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 03:32:46 2015 UTC,Much better than Braves that's for sure
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"Oh fuck, now it's stuck in my head. I chanted it out loud and my brother immediately looked at me and told me to stop and never do that again."
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 03:36:55 2015 UTC,Shields with a super clean inning?  The tide is turning!
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 03:35:25 2015 UTC,Norris looks hardcore like a lawn gnome.
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 03:38:23 2015 UTC,I forgot about the phones...
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 03:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's weird. Why not just use lazers?"
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,3,Sat Jun 20 03:43:25 2015 UTC,that throw beat him
Padres,3agex4,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Sat Jun 20 03:52:58 2015 UTC,Looked like he had a pretty damn good jump too.
Padres,3agex4,gstutz176,3,Sat Jun 20 03:54:46 2015 UTC,"Garces, that was lucky as shit. I want to like you, I really do."

Padres,3agex4,Lefkada,3,Sat Jun 20 04:47:59 2015 UTC,hoo boy kemp's numbers vs ziegler...
Padres,3agex4,pandajay24,3,Sat Jun 20 04:48:56 2015 UTC,The team did fight back. It just wasn't enough.
Padres,3agex4,SportsMind,3,Sat Jun 20 04:49:26 2015 UTC,"Kemp you worthless mother fucker ಠ_ಠ  Sorry that had to come out of me, but holy shit he had two prime opportunities to do something and he finishes the fucking day 0-5"

Padres,3agex4,Fargoleafy,2,Sat Jun 20 01:50:54 2015 UTC,At work but checking in. Is Tomas ok?
Padres,3agex4,friarfangirl,2,Sat Jun 20 02:05:55 2015 UTC,Hit him right on the elbow. Looked painful but he stayed in.
Padres,3agex4,gstutz176,2,Sat Jun 20 02:07:58 2015 UTC,Shields made Castillo look foolish on that curve

Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 02:25:03 2015 UTC,I like who we have up right now. Lets get some runs
Padres,3agex4,JOE619,2,Sat Jun 20 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"Three pitches, three outs.  Making RUBBY look like an ace."

Padres,3agex4,SdBolts4,2,Sat Jun 20 02:41:15 2015 UTC,Hey a call went our way
Padres,3agex4,pandajay24,2,Sat Jun 20 02:44:35 2015 UTC,Might have gotten a break on that one...butttt the glove beat the foot there for sure.
Padres,3agex4,warheart90,2,Sat Jun 20 02:44:37 2015 UTC,I thought he was safe but my roomate who is not a Padres fan is absolutely convinced he was out.
Padres,3agex4,gstutz176,2,Sat Jun 20 02:51:15 2015 UTC,This team is depressing.
Padres,3agex4,folettary,2,Sat Jun 20 02:48:40 2015 UTC,"And super exciting, sometimes.  Just setting the stage to take advantage of Rubbys ERA."
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 02:50:23 2015 UTC,At least Shields hasn't allowed a homer yet.  And I like how Arizona plays big time when a double happens.
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 02:49:09 2015 UTC,knocks on wood
Padres,3agex4,Sh1g,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:50:42 2015 UTC,Almost spoke too soon. He usually good for giving up at least one tho.
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 02:49:48 2015 UTC,"I like you Shields, but, yeah. I'm ready for the not allowing runs part."
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:54:52 2015 UTC,Looks like he's going to be pulled soon.
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 02:55:31 2015 UTC,We just really need to get out of the field and gets the bats hot
Padres,3agex4,Br1ngTheRayne,2,Sat Jun 20 02:55:09 2015 UTC,So we're getting this De La Rosa aren't we? ಠ_ಠ
Padres,3agex4,T-nawtical,2,Sat Jun 20 03:02:29 2015 UTC,Nope its just our lacking offense. Our guys are swinging at everything. They do not know how to work counts.
Padres,3agex4,folettary,2,Sat Jun 20 03:03:36 2015 UTC,yea it's pretty hard to work the count when you swing at the first pitch.
Padres,3agex4,gstutz176,2,Sat Jun 20 03:07:24 2015 UTC,We love to swing early.
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 03:15:28 2015 UTC,44 pitches through five innings equals shit for plate dicipline.
Padres,3agex4,kensal78,2,Sat Jun 20 03:15:28 2015 UTC,SHIELDS IS A LEGEND
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 03:16:16 2015 UTC,"Don't you dare call De La Rosa's fastball Hot Sauce Enberg ಠ_ಠ  Ok... thank you. I know it's hot sauce, but that's supposed to be for our guys :c"
Padres,3agex4,T-nawtical,2,Sat Jun 20 03:16:26 2015 UTC,...yonder... The faith
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 03:17:52 2015 UTC,Some kinda nice here. Let's go yonder
Padres,3agex4,kensal78,2,Sat Jun 20 03:17:53 2015 UTC,would have loved a hit but I'll take the free run =D
Padres,3agex4,Sh1g,2,Sat Jun 20 03:26:14 2015 UTC,Let's go Kemp time to be clutch yo
Padres,3agex4,pandajay24,2,Sat Jun 20 03:27:02 2015 UTC,Is there anything Goldschmidt can't do?
Padres,3agex4,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Sat Jun 20 04:07:36 2015 UTC,He can't run red lights or punch babies. That's all we've found
Padres,3agex4,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 20 04:15:00 2015 UTC,he chooses not to
Padres,3agex4,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Sat Jun 20 04:17:40 2015 UTC,The 0-8 between upton kemp and Norris is saddening.
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 04:10:25 2015 UTC,Maybe something's in store?
Padres,3agex4,JOE619,3,Sat Jun 20 04:14:39 2015 UTC,Ha 0-10 but I'm not complaining about this inning so far
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 04:16:14 2015 UTC,lol yeah the two errors
Padres,3agex4,JOE619,2,Sat Jun 20 04:25:54 2015 UTC,That was not an error.
Padres,3agex4,SportsMind,3,Sat Jun 20 04:14:03 2015 UTC,Ehhh...
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 04:14:46 2015 UTC,Spangey ding dong dinger donger?  Let's get it!
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 04:22:41 2015 UTC,Show us what you got Wallace.
Padres,3agex4,bhahne,2,Sat Jun 20 04:26:10 2015 UTC,This would be special if Upton got it here.
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,2,Sat Jun 20 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"Oh God, not again.... Upton will get walked on then Kemp will strike out on 3 pitches low and outside.  Edit: Well, half of this is wrong so far..."
Padres,3agex4,Leoric,2,Sat Jun 20 04:47:19 2015 UTC,Until kemp makes an adjustment it's seriously time to consider moving him down in the order. 12 men left on base today and 6 were by him. Can't have that in the four spot.
Padres,3agex4,gstutz176,2,Sat Jun 20 04:51:43 2015 UTC,Yea I was trying not to be blunt. Honestly at this point sit him down for a few days. Enberg kept saying how kemp looked so uncomfortable against de la rosa but he refused to take a fucking pitch. Padres are only paying him $3 million this year because of the front loading by the Dodgers and he is sure as shit playing like it.
Padres,3agex4,gstutz176,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:53:28 2015 UTC,I need a drink.
Padres,3agex4,Leoric,2,Sat Jun 20 04:58:16 2015 UTC,Alright Upton. Now is the time. #ibelieve
Padres,3agex4,pandajay24,2,Sat Jun 20 04:53:49 2015 UTC,UPTON!!!!

Padres,3agex4,Snuffaluffakuss,2,Sat Jun 20 04:49:15 2015 UTC,That was...........quite frustrating
Padres,3agex4,JOE619,2,Sat Jun 20 04:49:18 2015 UTC,Shields no hitter today
Padres,3agex4,chrissytheblack,4,Sat Jun 20 04:50:38 2015 UTC,Lol

Padres,3agex4,LifeandLimb,4,Sat Jun 20 03:50:47 2015 UTC,Dude no
Padres,3agex4,FanDiego,5,Sat Jun 20 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"Look at our football team, man :("
Padres,3agex4,JOE619,2,Sat Jun 20 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"Damn, Dude, That's harsh. I'm a hockey fan. Undoubtedly they eventually loose the franchise"
Padres,3agex4,herecomesjonny,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:50:31 2015 UTC,Is shields just missing on his locations? His change seems to be moving a lot this game

Padres,3agex4,bhahne,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:38:58 2015 UTC,Redemption time kemp. No 0-2 from bad swings.

Padres,3ag3yl,pad_squad,10,Fri Jun 19 21:28:18 2015 UTC,What happened to Sexy Tommy Medica?  Did he give up on baseball and release a mixtape?
Padres,3ag3yl,Flesh_Lettuce,7,Sat Jun 20 00:25:59 2015 UTC,Played with Pat Murphy at Az St AND the entire season in El Paso so far. I'm interested in this call up and glad Cory is heading to minors.
Padres,3ag3yl,n0teye,3,Fri Jun 19 22:16:58 2015 UTC,Wonder if Murph is trying to built some clubhouse culture.
Padres,3ag3yl,rowbearski,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:27:47 2015 UTC,I thought he had a good AB tonight. Let's see what he can do with some more time at the plate.
Padres,3ag3yl,n0teye,14,Sat Jun 20 05:25:51 2015 UTC,Best news in that link: Mazzoni back to AAA
Padres,3ag3yl,ardifishul,5,Fri Jun 19 21:57:17 2015 UTC,"Cory has shown flashes of brilliance, just needs a bit more time to polish out the rough edges."
Padres,3ag3yl,MrDL104,-3,Fri Jun 19 23:30:05 2015 UTC,"If by ""a bit more time"" you mean ""a century or two."""
Padres,3ag3yl,n0teye,4,Fri Jun 19 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Look at his outings so far (3 poor ones, 2 bad ones, 3 great ones) and his AAA numbers.   It's a similar situation to Kelley; he just needs to iron things out."
Padres,3ag3yl,MrDL104,0,Sat Jun 20 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, seriously. He's not ready for the MLB for a long while.  In 8.2 IP he's given up 22R 22ER 2HR 5BB.  He's given up hits AND runs in 6/8 appearances. He's given up more than one run in 5/8 of his appearances. Not only can he not strike guys out or get outs he also lets inherited runners score.  Are you related to him or something? I don't understand how anyone can defend this guy. Remember, he's typically brought in to eat 1 inning and now has an ERA over 20. He has yet to consistently help the Padres win games and is unreliable at very best.  No thanks."
Padres,3ag3yl,n0teye,4,Sat Jun 20 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"ERA is a bad metric to measure relief pitchers, especially with such a small sample size. A few bad outings and you'll never recover.   I'm not sure when you can say he ""can't strike guys out."" Look at individual appearances.  5/21 2K in 1 IP 5/28 2K in 2 IP (albeit while allowing 2ER) 5/31 2K in 1 IP  In a AAA this year he has a WHIP of 1 and a K/9 rate above 11. Those are pretty fantastic metrics. That's why he got the call up.   Like I said, he needs to work on some things, but he's shown incredible potential and could soon be a great asset to our team.   All I'm saying is don't go skewering a guy over a few bad outings."
Padres,3ag3yl,MrDL104,6,Sat Jun 20 05:40:51 2015 UTC,No Medica?
Padres,3ag3yl,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,5,Sat Jun 20 00:50:15 2015 UTC,Seems like a better option than almonte off the bench I like it
Padres,3ag3yl,thewhiteman80,3,Fri Jun 19 22:53:27 2015 UTC,Anyone know about this guy? Possibly promoted because he was a player for Murphy?
Padres,3ag3yl,couchmeister,3,Fri Jun 19 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"seems like a lefthanded WMB with a league average BA, but hasn't played in the majors since 2013."
Padres,3ag3yl,MrDL104,3,Fri Jun 19 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"He actually hit pretty well in spring training. If we needed another corner IF on the bench, he might have made the team then.   He'll likely see some time at 1B & 3B as needed to spell Alonso/ Middlebrooks/ Solarte."
Padres,3ag3yl,JolIyJack,-1,Fri Jun 19 23:28:57 2015 UTC,Just your typical journeyman AAA caliber player. Hasn't shown the ability to hit major league pitching and plays below average defense at 1B.
Padres,3ag3yl,b4sunryze,2,Fri Jun 19 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"AAAA Player, but might help Murph as an ally in his corner to win the clubhouse."

Padres,3abtho,rowbearski,9,Thu Jun 18 22:43:26 2015 UTC,he has hit 2 HRs since Buddy left.   How many players have hit a HR for 3 different managers in 1 season?
Padres,3abtho,carmen_electralytes,8,Thu Jun 18 23:05:00 2015 UTC,I hope we can have Matt Kemp home run parties everyday!
Padres,3abtho,MattyLightttttt,4,Thu Jun 18 22:57:48 2015 UTC,I heard they helped him lower his hands which has allowed him to throw his hands at the ball. He's got great power and doesn't need his hands loaded so high.
Padres,3abtho,If_its_mean_downvote,2,Thu Jun 18 23:04:59 2015 UTC,You definitely see that in display with the home run today. It was almost a golf swing the way his arms were extended and how he went after the ball down and away
Padres,3abtho,bobby_runs,3,Fri Jun 19 05:43:07 2015 UTC,I'm REALLY hoping these get old

Padres,3ac121,enginedown,2,Thu Jun 18 23:25:18 2015 UTC,Oh ya I forgot about Edgar Gonzalez. I always liked him.
Padres,3ac121,BP619,2,Fri Jun 19 08:20:26 2015 UTC,I remember Marcus Giles on the Padres and am relatively certain he didn't have a hit.
Padres,3ac121,gstutz176,2,Fri Jun 19 03:39:19 2015 UTC,I will always remember marcus giles for jumping in between chris young and derek lee when they got into it in chicago.
Padres,3ac121,bhahne,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:47:05 2015 UTC,I was at that game. There were three Padres fans and we all looked at each other whenever anything went our way. Pretty cool
Padres,3ac121,gstutz176,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:26:22 2015 UTC,one of my favorite padres memories. even more bad ass to hear you were there!
Padres,3ac121,bhahne,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:49:14 2015 UTC,Ha yes one of mine too. Our seats were down the first base line so I had a good view.  I remember it fairly well the ticket was given to me for a late birthday present from a lady friend ;). Absolute chaos and surprisingly the fans didn't give me any shit. They were super pissed that it took a while to eject young and lee was out fast but other than that awesome experience.
Padres,3aa9za,pandajay24,11,Thu Jun 18 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"That's reassuring. Not the direct message, but his tweet indicates that he has an ability to take a bad loss without growing despondent. I see a good team leader for the next few years."

Ours is a treacherous path filled with monsters the likes of serpents and gritty rock and mountain. The titans rule our division having laid claim to the world thrice in 5 years. They continue to nip at the heals of the affluent pretenders who look to purchase the world and have it delivered to their so called 'city of angels' on a silver platter. But Lo, the tide is turning. Our new skipper will harbor a mid-season boon for the Padres. We will no longer skirt the depths of Davy Jones' locker but gangway to the top and lay anchor on golden shores."

Padres,3ac5g7,carmen_electralytes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:54:47 2015 UTC,I think he needs a bit more plate discipline though. He swung at the first 5 pitches he saw I believe. He needs to take a couple of pitches.

Padres,3ac5g7,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,5,Thu Jun 18 22:22:08 2015 UTC,100% guarantee if you are playing the Padres you are getting a truly awful ump.
Padres,3ac5g7,PanicAtTheSisqo,5,Thu Jun 18 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"That's my sort of game. Not high scoring so it feels both teams can win and any bad pitch could ruin it making it even more tense.

Padres,3ac5g7,UserDrew,3,Thu Jun 18 22:44:58 2015 UTC,If Upton Jr can hit .240 and Hedges can hit      .220 I really like how they mask two of our biggest weaknesses: corner outfield defense and stolen bases.
Padres,3ac5g7,MattyLightttttt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:02:17 2015 UTC,Stolen bases?  Norris is leading the league in throwing out runners.  I think you'd be looking more at the pitching staff to take more care in holding runners.
Padres,3ac5g7,BeerFarts86,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:27:10 2015 UTC,Norris has been great but at the end of the day he is right around average at catching base stealers while Hedges is superb (even though he's had a few poor throws lately). The weakness is that certain guys on our team take forever to deliver the baseball for sure.
Padres,3ac5g7,MattyLightttttt,7,Fri Jun 19 18:59:34 2015 UTC,weird having a manager that actually shows emotion

Padres,3aayxh,colspace,2,Thu Jun 18 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"Looks like he's made a slight stance tweak: closed his stance just a bit, so his hips have a little longer to travel when he swings.  The longer path seems to be giving him a bit more momentum on his swing, and is helping him drive the ball a bit.  I think it might also help him reach the slider down and away, to fight it off to RF, instead of whiffing on it."
Padres,3aayxh,anoff,2,Thu Jun 18 21:48:12 2015 UTC,Hopefully he keeps the pace up.
Padres,3aayxh,TenMinutesToDowntown,7,Thu Jun 18 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"Anyone else feel like there is no way we should leave OAK without Ben Zobrist on the plane as our new SS?  I'm not sure there is another player in the league that fits what we need: LHB with power, plus defender at multiple positions including SS, walks at a high rate, relatively modest price tag with no long term commitments.  I'm sure he'll cost some pieces, but if we want to compete for the 2nd wild card this season instead of next, I think it's the move to make."
Padres,3aayxh,anoff,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:44:14 2015 UTC,I'm just worried about what they'll want for him.
Padres,3aayxh,carmen_electralytes,2,Thu Jun 18 21:47:04 2015 UTC,Don't the a's have a terrible bullpen? maybe some bullpen pieces
Padres,3aayxh,DickLame,3,Thu Jun 18 21:50:16 2015 UTC,Maybe just not tell Mizzoni the bus is leaving 10 minutes early.
Padres,3aayxh,Strike3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"I think I would dangle Hedges, a bullpen arm, and a 2nd tier prospect.  As much as I love watching Hedges make Santiago-esque throws to 2B, Norris is still pre-arb, so he's going to be entrenched behind the plate for at least another 4 years."
Padres,3aayxh,anoff,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"Zobrist has missed a chunk of the season due to knee surgery, and he also hasn't been hitting well, except during this series."
Padres,3aayxh,warheart90,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"you mean he's hitting like a guy that is starting to get fully healthy after knee surgery?  I wished we had traded for him 2 weeks ago when he was hitting .210, might've saved a prospect or 2."
Padres,3aayxh,anoff,7,Thu Jun 18 22:24:43 2015 UTC,Quick bring in Amarista to close the game.

Padres,3aayxh,Leoric,4,Thu Jun 18 21:48:22 2015 UTC,What about Adrian/Edgar? Can't remember which bropair was more recent.
Padres,3aayxh,enginedown,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:49:36 2015 UTC,Oh man I forgot all about that. No idea.
Padres,3aayxh,Leoric,5,Thu Jun 18 21:50:53 2015 UTC,Here's to a good game. I really do hope you guys have better luck with the rest of your road trip.
Padres,3aayxh,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just happy no one on your team tried to kill Despaigne when he plunked Burns. You know, considering that we're blue like the Royals, I was concerned it might trigger someone. I guess they realized our pitchers have seriously been this inconsistent.  All jokes aside, thanks for the well wishes! I hope you guys have a solid rest of the year!"

I dunno what it is, but it makes me wish it to be 1970 even though I wouldn't be pulled into this world for another 15 years. The green and gold is one of my favorite color combinations in the majors, a good break from the blues and reds. Tony LaRussa, Reggie Jackson, Felipe Alou, Rollie Fingers, Mudcat Grant. That was a good roster year for the As.   edit: and Catfish Hunter. Those names, classic baseball player names."
Padres,3aayxh,UserDrew,2,Thu Jun 18 20:00:21 2015 UTC,Would love to see that in a game playing against some brown and mustard.

Padres,3aayxh,jbraun04,3,Thu Jun 18 20:32:11 2015 UTC,Our last 5 runs scored have all been dongers
Padres,3aayxh,pad_squad,3,Thu Jun 18 21:01:33 2015 UTC,I wonder what our pitchers ERAs are in innings after we score runs.
Padres,3aayxh,pandajay24,3,Thu Jun 18 21:06:29 2015 UTC,Mild Sauce
Padres,3aayxh,Leoric,3,Thu Jun 18 21:08:18 2015 UTC,It must feel weird to be playing one position and then shift to a completely different one in the same game. Epically 1st to Catcher.
Padres,3aayxh,JOE619,3,Thu Jun 18 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"Oh god, here we go."
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,6,Thu Jun 18 22:10:34 2015 UTC,Interesting line up
Padres,3aayxh,pad_squad,2,Thu Jun 18 17:14:20 2015 UTC,I totally missed yonder at 3b the first time through the lineup.
Padres,3aayxh,gstutz176,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:20:59 2015 UTC,Day games usually bring that sentiment
Padres,3aayxh,frakking-anustart,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"What word has the same meaning as interesting, but multiplied by a hundred. Several times."

Padres,3aayxh,friarfangirl,2,Thu Jun 18 20:59:22 2015 UTC,"Good job, Norris. Wow i just realized he and Yonder have very similar backside silhouettes."
Padres,3aayxh,friarfangirl,3,Thu Jun 18 20:18:06 2015 UTC,"Nice butt, Yonder!!!  Er...nice hit!"
Padres,3aayxh,PanicAtTheSisqo,2,Thu Jun 18 20:33:28 2015 UTC,it can be both.
Padres,3aayxh,friarfangirl,2,Thu Jun 18 20:34:22 2015 UTC,por que no los dos?
Padres,3aayxh,pandajay24,4,Thu Jun 18 20:35:33 2015 UTC,Lmao did anyone just hear the super buttmad A's fan?
Padres,3aayxh,PanicAtTheSisqo,2,Thu Jun 18 21:48:57 2015 UTC,Please please please let's have a solid game today and leave this series with a W. Go Padres were still rooting for you!
Padres,3aayxh,bhahne,2,Thu Jun 18 17:35:21 2015 UTC,Outfield D looks good. I'm really liking what I've seen from Melvin so far. Solid abs and aggressive base running.
Padres,3aayxh,JAYFL,2,Thu Jun 18 17:48:48 2015 UTC,Read that as Abs not At-Bats...wasn't sure when you saw his abs haha
Padres,3aayxh,wlayne13,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:17:25 2015 UTC,dude may never live up to his salary but he seems like a real terror on the basepaths and playing in CF.  that brings a shit ton of value to an NL squad.
Padres,3aayxh,gstutz176,2,Thu Jun 18 17:55:25 2015 UTC,I love this lineup. Also saves Solarte for clutch PH situations. Let's be aggressive and get this done!
Padres,3aayxh,pandajay24,2,Thu Jun 18 18:07:26 2015 UTC,"Calling it: Norris beasts out today, stopping every rip sent his way, diving left and right, then wins it for us going yard in the 9th, as a way to say to his old team, ""I loved you guys and appreciated you, but I've moved on to someone else. This is my catharsis."""
Padres,3aayxh,LivingAsAMean,2,Thu Jun 18 19:36:44 2015 UTC,I love seeing catchers play first.
Padres,3aayxh,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 18 20:22:15 2015 UTC,Norris For Gold Glove at 1st.
Padres,3aayxh,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 18 20:24:28 2015 UTC,Please let THE Matt Kemp be back!
Padres,3aayxh,billy_c,2,Thu Jun 18 20:32:54 2015 UTC,keep on keeping on Kemp...break outta that slump
Padres,3aayxh,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Thu Jun 18 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"IPK needs a quick inning here, keep the momentum on our side"
Padres,3aayxh,jbraun04,2,Thu Jun 18 20:35:16 2015 UTC,KC digs hehe
Padres,3aayxh,Fargoleafy,2,Thu Jun 18 20:38:09 2015 UTC,Why is Vogt's helmet so dirty
Padres,3aayxh,couchmeister,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:39:20 2015 UTC,Probably pinetar to grab during ABs
Padres,3aayxh,Fargoleafy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:40:27 2015 UTC,It's always like that. I'm pretty sure its pinetar.
Padres,3aayxh,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 18 20:43:06 2015 UTC,keep hitting the ball
Padres,3aayxh,Flesh_Lettuce,2,Thu Jun 18 20:42:22 2015 UTC,If Melvin could hit I would be all for him and Venable platooning in center. Speed demons that can cover ground quick
Padres,3aayxh,jbraun04,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:55:43 2015 UTC,that triple good enough?
Padres,3aayxh,Snuffaluffakuss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:48:25 2015 UTC,I'd prefer him being over the mendoza line tbh
Padres,3aayxh,jbraun04,2,Thu Jun 18 22:02:16 2015 UTC,there we go derek!!!!
Padres,3aayxh,Snuffaluffakuss,2,Thu Jun 18 20:58:20 2015 UTC,Yeaahhh Norris!
Padres,3aayxh,Leoric,2,Thu Jun 18 20:58:23 2015 UTC,NORRRRRRIS
Padres,3aayxh,pandajay24,2,Thu Jun 18 20:58:24 2015 UTC,Our lineup needs to give some better at bats. The opposing pitchers pitch count is always so low. Hurts us vs aces and teams with poor bullpens.
Padres,3aayxh,Fargoleafy,2,Thu Jun 18 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. They had great at bats against the A's pitcher in the second game of the series and they drove him from the game, then someone complained they were taking too many pitches. What?"
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,2,Thu Jun 18 21:13:24 2015 UTC,Why is Hedges being taken out of the game?
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,2,Thu Jun 18 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"Murphy wants to go for the win here, and hedges hasn't hit that well."
Padres,3aayxh,warheart90,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:20:02 2015 UTC,"With only a 1 run lead, I'd rather have Hedges still catching."
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"Probably Norris to C, Middlebrooks to 3B, Yonder to 1B?"
Padres,3aayxh,espo619,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:21:30 2015 UTC,Most likely
Padres,3aayxh,JOE619,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:21:54 2015 UTC,Yes I think that's exactly what's going to happen.
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:22:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm sure with only a 1 run lead, they want someone more familiar with 1st base than norris."
Padres,3aayxh,warheart90,2,Thu Jun 18 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"Enberg, Grant pls."
Padres,3aayxh,Fargoleafy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:20:17 2015 UTC,What happened? Wasn't watching
Padres,3aayxh,carmen_electralytes,2,Thu Jun 18 21:26:19 2015 UTC,Ouch... That one looked like it hurt. Didn't look TOO bad though. Hopefully he's alright.
Padres,3aayxh,carmen_electralytes,2,Thu Jun 18 21:34:56 2015 UTC,Maurer is fucking magical.
Padres,3aayxh,carmen_electralytes,2,Thu Jun 18 21:57:31 2015 UTC,Pretty epic that Oakland plays Epic Sax Man at full blast in theit stadium
Padres,3aayxh,deathsmaash,2,Thu Jun 18 22:04:01 2015 UTC,Something in the grass?
Padres,3aayxh,JOE619,2,Thu Jun 18 22:14:20 2015 UTC,Can we just get a 1-2-3 inning once in a while? lol
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,2,Thu Jun 18 22:17:31 2015 UTC,Congrats to Murph. Hope this is a turning poinh
Padres,3aayxh,JOE619,3,Thu Jun 18 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"please take Matt out of the clean up spot.  Put him ahead of Justin in the 2 spot, or the 5 or 6 spot.  He is having poor ABs.  Jesus do the coaches see something we don't?  is this an ego thing?"
Padres,3aayxh,Flesh_Lettuce,4,Thu Jun 18 19:46:23 2015 UTC,props to Melvin for keeping his baserunning head
Padres,3aayxh,friarfangirl,2,Thu Jun 18 21:42:32 2015 UTC,"That was beautiful contact, Yonder."
Padres,3aayxh,friarfangirl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:32:20 2015 UTC,Seriously one of the prettiest swings around
Padres,3aayxh,jbraun04,2,Thu Jun 18 20:32:39 2015 UTC,I love Yonder's swing.

Padres,3aayxh,klongbor,2,Thu Jun 18 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"Just noticed: Kemp has made an adjustment!  He has dropped his hands more into a hitting position, rather than having them so high.  His swing looks much shorter, and he is generating power!  I feel good about this."
Padres,3aayxh,BeerFarts86,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"Starting to square the ball up more, its encouraging"
Padres,3aayxh,jbraun04,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:04:30 2015 UTC,Pat Murphy Effect?
Padres,3aayxh,espo619,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:05:53 2015 UTC,Maybe. Sometimes a fresh set of eyes will do wonders.
Padres,3aayxh,BeerFarts86,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:06:33 2015 UTC,Can someone pull to screenshots of his swing together? I'd be interested to see if the Farter's observation is correct.
Padres,3aayxh,Friar_Faithful,2,Thu Jun 18 21:44:31 2015 UTC,Bring in amarista!
Padres,3aayxh,warheart90,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:55:28 2015 UTC,I'm liking this so far. Good way to keep Norris hitting while Hedges is catching. I'm also excited for Alonso to get more 3B experience.
Padres,3aayxh,couchmeister,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:51:38 2015 UTC,Very interesting lineup. It's going to be interesting to see Norris and Alonso at 1st and 3rd.

Padres,3aayxh,couchmeister,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:04:47 2015 UTC,One mistake to Butler did him in early but he was solid from then on
Padres,3aayxh,jbraun04,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:19:24 2015 UTC,What's with our players unable to make contact? It's starting to get pathetic.
Padres,3aayxh,folettary,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:14:12 2015 UTC,Alonso can pick it.  sick play on the foul

Padres,3aayxh,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:14:40 2015 UTC,lmao. Shades of Mad Bum right there. Some guy behind me at the Dodgers game a few weeks ago was calling an Agon homer that ended up being a double play.

Padres,3aayxh,Friar_Faithful,4,Thu Jun 18 21:39:16 2015 UTC,we should stop shaming Melvin for everything.  He's looking good for us.  We arent the Braves.
Padres,3aayxh,Flesh_Lettuce,5,Thu Jun 18 21:36:40 2015 UTC,lol not shaming him just thought there was a chance

Padres,3aayxh,billy_c,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:47:01 2015 UTC,Dude just isn't ready for the bigs. Is Quack back yet? I trust him more than Vincent or Mazz.
Padres,3aayxh,crimsontideftw24,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:04:29 2015 UTC,Me too. I think Vincent has lost velocity on his fast ball.
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:08:49 2015 UTC,He also looks skinnier but that might just be in comparison to Quack. Dudes huge and intimidating!
Padres,3aayxh,crimsontideftw24,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"Skimmed fangraphs. Its down slightly, less than 1 mph  He has more movement though, but also getting more contact. Babip off him is over .400 as well so he might be just unlucky"
Padres,3aayxh,violaxcore,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:58:20 2015 UTC,My impression is velocity is down and he has no control. So slower pitches going into the middle of the plate.
Padres,3aayxh,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"I get that Quack has a cool name, but he's not that effective either.  He's a thrower like Thayer, with little movement"
Padres,3aayxh,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:47:54 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, but preferable yet to someone serving up actual ducks at the moment like Mazzoni is."
Padres,3aayxh,crimsontideftw24,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:06:43 2015 UTC,Just the kind of shake up we need. Excited to see it in action.

Padres,3aayxh,DickLame,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:42:41 2015 UTC,Upton looks slow when he runs yet he has 13 stolen bases
Padres,3a9a62,JOE619,12,Thu Jun 18 06:25:12 2015 UTC,"As funny as this is, I feel bad for him his big league dreams just got done being shattered"
Padres,3a9a62,thewhiteman80,2,Thu Jun 18 08:22:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure why he is in the bullpen over Quackenbush, he has good stuff just could use some more conditioning at AAA. Although he does have the best ERA on our AAA team in the bullpen so I'm not really sure what is going on."
Padres,3a9a62,weavdaddy,2,Thu Jun 18 12:06:34 2015 UTC,Good point - he's only had <90 appearances in the minor leagues TOTAL. How can you say out of one side of your mouth that this team was built to win and then simultaneously send out Mazzoni to get pumped like nickel gas.
Padres,3a9a62,n0teye,2,Thu Jun 18 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think they would send him out if they didn't think that he wasn't ready. The reason you have people on the MLB roster is because you expect them to be the best option in the system. What is happening to him kinda reminds me of how Shawn Kelley was having trouble in the beginning of the year, the guy has decent stuff probably just needs some confidence."
Padres,3a9a62,weavdaddy,3,Thu Jun 18 22:05:58 2015 UTC,I think that he has proven unequivocally that he is not anywhere near ready for the major league at this point. Shawn Kelley had some adjustments to make after a couple of rough outings at the very beginning of the year (read: gave up a run or two in high leverage situations). Mazzoni has a 20.xx ERA and I do not believe he possesses the tools or the confidence to strike batters out / get outs. I dont understand why they don't drop him down to El Paso to work out the kinks and call up a proven arm from the farm rather than a guy we just got from NYMets.
Padres,3a9a62,n0teye,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:37:07 2015 UTC,Holy hell that was incredibly painful to watch. I felt horrible for the guy.

Padres,3a9a62,Flesh_Lettuce,4,Thu Jun 18 19:11:19 2015 UTC,why did we trade torres...
Padres,3a9a62,Infamous89,6,Thu Jun 18 07:19:45 2015 UTC,"Cause Torres had spotty control. Mizzoni has no business being on the team, I'm pretty sure he was in AA."
Padres,3a9a62,Strike3,5,Thu Jun 18 08:32:00 2015 UTC,"Because he was a left handed specialist that couldn't get lefties out, had serious control problems, and he wore a funny hat."
Padres,3a9a62,MrDL104,4,Thu Jun 18 16:21:22 2015 UTC,"Ok traveling for work, did we actually have Amarista pitch last night? What the hell is going on with our Padres?"
Padres,3a9a62,So-Cal-Mountain-Man,11,Thu Jun 18 10:31:50 2015 UTC,Yes he did. 2 pitches around 80 mph. Burns flew out. Why? I have no idea. They scored 7 in the eighth so why not let ninja throw some pitches?
Padres,3a9a62,bhahne,9,Thu Jun 18 10:47:35 2015 UTC,Better than burning another bullpen arm when down 14
Padres,3a9a62,OBEYthesky,5,Thu Jun 18 15:57:54 2015 UTC,Dude is rethinking his entire purpose in life just in that one moment.
Padres,3a9a62,TRITON808,6,Thu Jun 18 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"Well his specialty isn't offspeed like Little Ninja's.   But seriously. Mazzoni is the new Kelley. Bring back the Quack attack!!,"
Padres,3a9a62,BobTaco,2,Thu Jun 18 07:10:57 2015 UTC,Mazzoni is terrible why is he still on the team?
Padres,3a9a62,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,5,Thu Jun 18 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"He destroys AAA hitters, he probably just needs a good outing or two kinda like Kelley in the beginning of the year."
Padres,3a9a62,weavdaddy,3,Thu Jun 18 12:09:52 2015 UTC,"He's pitched 8 major league innings and you're rushing to judgement like that? Sure, he's gotten shelled pretty hard in his last two outings, but there's a much bigger picture.  He was lights out in AAA so far this year, so they gave him a shot in the MLB bullpen. Obviously, he's not quite ready and needs to work out some things (I'm guessing he'll be back in El Paso this week and we'll add a bench bat now that Myers is out), but let's not call a guy ""terrible"" based on a few bad games."
Padres,3a9a62,MrDL104,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:26:05 2015 UTC,Idk. Seems he gets shellacked every time we put him in is all.
Padres,3a9a62,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:04:53 2015 UTC,"You must be forgetting the 3 times he came in and didn't allow a hit.  All told, he's had 3 medicore-poor outings, 2 really bad ones, and 3 good-great outings.  Is he full time MLB ready? Probably not. Is he ""terrible"" or ""get shellacked every time?"" Definitely not."

Padres,3a8a9v,PanicAtTheSisqo,11,Thu Jun 18 00:36:06 2015 UTC,I'm glad he's having the surgery now. Let's hope he's back in time for a playoff push.

Padres,3a8a9v,chief-yeezy,2,Thu Jun 18 00:38:21 2015 UTC,Exactly that. Much better for him to miss a couple months now opposed to completely destroying his wrist.

Padres,3a936u,Maxwell69,2,Thu Jun 18 06:30:00 2015 UTC,What a game. I would want to forget this entirely if it wasn't for Amarista. Did we one up the Phillies with Francouer?   This is the 3rd time I've seen a person not pitch as a designated pitcher and the 2nd time this year. I think this has been the strangest MLB season I've ever seen. The first was in 2003 when the Padre's own Wiki Gonzalez pitched. That was a low point in a bad bad year.   Slide ends at 4. Win tomorrow.
Padres,3a936u,UserDrew,2,Thu Jun 18 06:43:17 2015 UTC,And yet the NL West still loses
Padres,3a936u,Flesh_Lettuce,4,Thu Jun 18 07:56:17 2015 UTC,I turned it off because I thought it would help. It made it worse. I'm so sorry!! :'(
Padres,3a936u,BobTaco,4,Thu Jun 18 05:24:25 2015 UTC,Wishful thinking...  If our current L4 streak was actually just a W4 streak we would be a game or so back of the Doyers because of their slide. FUCK
Padres,3a936u,jbraun04,2,Thu Jun 18 05:41:15 2015 UTC,"I was at the game tonight, and besides the bullpen sucking, the outfielders didn't look very good on defense. Will Venable was hustlin' like always but Kemp and Upton need to hustle a little bit more. It looked like Kemp was walking to every hit and foul ball, and like he just doesn't give a shit about anything. I know Upton and Kemp aren't the best outfielders but they need to at least pretend like they care....."
Padres,3a936u,PizzaPlanet95,3,Thu Jun 18 05:45:47 2015 UTC,We lost. That is all. Day game tomorrow!!!!

Padres,3a7r10,friarfangirl,2,Thu Jun 18 03:15:25 2015 UTC,Way to own it.  Nice to see some accountability around this team!!
Padres,3a7r10,BeerFarts86,3,Thu Jun 18 03:19:24 2015 UTC,It's lit now. We have plenty of time to make up for my grievous error.

Padres,3a7r10,megustanlosyogapants,5,Thu Jun 18 03:10:28 2015 UTC,Man who thought our pitching was gonna be this horrible looking forward after last season?
Padres,3a7r10,thewhiteman80,2,Thu Jun 18 02:39:32 2015 UTC,I expected some regression considering last year was literally the best staff in the history of the Padres but not this much.

Padres,3a7r10,Sadfrog_IX,4,Thu Jun 18 04:57:50 2015 UTC,I'd vote for the Coliseum as the worst looking ballpark in the majors right now but I'm open to suggestions for others.
Padres,3a7r10,UserDrew,3,Thu Jun 18 01:33:05 2015 UTC,Toronto is pretty ugly too imo
Padres,3a7r10,Friar-Faithful,2,Thu Jun 18 02:04:37 2015 UTC,For some reason I love the Coliseum. Kind of reminds me of Qualcomm
Padres,3a7r10,ry83,2,Thu Jun 18 02:23:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. I do get a perverted, oddly nostalgic vibe from it. I still think it's ugly, but it's an older stadium and it sort of embodies the westward expansion of baseball and football which inspired cities to save money by designing multi-use stadiums."
Padres,3a7r10,UserDrew,5,Thu Jun 18 04:00:10 2015 UTC,Fuck that UMP. I totally feel for Upton. He's been getting shitty calls lately and being cheated.

Padres,3a7r10,T-nawtical,2,Thu Jun 18 03:03:41 2015 UTC,Points?  SMOKEBOMB
Padres,3a7r10,Snuffaluffakuss,4,Thu Jun 18 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this could be a reason that Bud may have gotten canned.  Seeing Kennedy & Despaigne degress THIS badly is just straight up sickening. Despaigne was on a pretty good upslope at the end of 2014, and then he goes into 2015 and just turns into a complete joke, and then it took Kennedy up until the month of June to stop essentially allowing 5 runs in the first three innings of the freaking game. Then I don't need to remind ya'll about how much Thayer has degressed.  Seriously, how the hell have these two degressed this much? I'm starting to become happy with Kennedy again, but I am very disappointed in Despaigne & Thayer"
Padres,3a7r10,T-nawtical,4,Thu Jun 18 03:08:48 2015 UTC,Is that entirely on black or is it on balsley? Whenever a pitcher does well here everyone rightfully praises balsley but somehow the shitty rotation and unreliable bullpen is placed on blacks shoulders
Padres,3a7r10,megustanlosyogapants,2,Thu Jun 18 03:12:54 2015 UTC,"Huh. That is actually a really good point. It would explain why almost all of our inhouse talent {Ross & Maurer & Benoit excluded} from last year seemed to have degressed quite a bit from last year.   But there seems to be quite a few of our positional players who I've seen degress a bit as well. And then with just how bad Kemp has been doing, I was just kinda voicing why I thought was going through the Padres head when we let Black go."
Padres,3a7r10,T-nawtical,2,Thu Jun 18 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"I dont disagree with you. When it comes down to it all the shortcomings of this team are placed on blacks shoulders. Im sure the pitching was a big factor in eltting him go along with the struggles our position players are having although that is a struggle we know all too well so its a little less surprising. I just have to think that the struggles that guys who have been around with us for a while like cash, kennedy and ross are going through have more to do with balsley than black"
Padres,3a7r10,megustanlosyogapants,3,Thu Jun 18 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but the word you're looking for is regress."
Padres,3a7r10,Strike3,2,Thu Jun 18 03:48:03 2015 UTC,"Despaigne has had some good outings lately. Well, except for tonight..."
Padres,3a7r10,couchmeister,2,Thu Jun 18 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"OD has been awesome his last 5 starts. Yeah, tonight's a stinker, but you can't expect a lights out performance from your number 5 starter every time out. It's just not realistic."
Padres,3a7r10,BeerFarts86,2,Thu Jun 18 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"I know od is still new to the big leagues, but didnt Kennedy  go like 4-17 one year? I think this is just the way they are. Streaky, Up & Down. I honestly think only Shields and Ross will be holdovers from this current rotation to next year."

Padres,3a7r10,NAYARIT,3,Thu Jun 18 04:49:57 2015 UTC,Is Amarista the shortest player to take the mound ever? Please tell me we at least broke a record today.
Padres,3a7r10,crimsontideftw24,2,Thu Jun 18 04:50:10 2015 UTC,I don't think so but I think it's possible he could be one of the top 10 shortest pitchers in MLB history.

Padres,3a67rv,bobby_runs,7,Wed Jun 17 15:55:04 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure. I believe he had been offered a job with the organization in the past but turned it down. Though I'm sure if he wanted it they wouldn't have said no. Miss you Tony.
Padres,3a67rv,HeadleysHobos,4,Wed Jun 17 16:13:16 2015 UTC,He was offered the managerial job out of respect prior to the hiring of bud black but declined out of respect because he knew he was not prepared at the time.
Padres,3a67rv,gstutz176,7,Wed Jun 17 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Tony would be a good manager, don't know how he did in SDSU. I would have like him to be a hitting coach. Imagine that knowledge, instruction, patience, being taught to professional hitters."

Padres,3a67rv,JOE619,8,Wed Jun 17 22:05:32 2015 UTC,From what I have come to understand Tony Gwynn was not that great of a manager at all and he had a very splintered clubhouse.  I honestly don't think he would even be considered for the job if we are being real here.

Padres,3a7j77,b4sunryze,11,Wed Jun 17 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"This is why I think, if Murphy turns things around, that he'll be the manager long term.   Preller has said that he has a 1, 3 and 5 year plan.   Year 1 - Why they went and got Upton. Create buzz, have options if the team doesn't workout. If they do work out and the Padres get to the Postseason they will have some cash to spend on Upton. If they make a real offer in the off season they will not lose too much credibility and get a nice draft pick.   3 Year Plan - Why they got Kemp. He'd be a Veteran guy around for a couple years, for which the Dodgers would pay a big portion of, give the Pads some Star Power regardless if Upton stays or not. Also why they got Norris, who I think exceeded expectations and would be able to walk away and allow Hedges to take over.   5 Year Plan - Why they got Myers and Middlebrooks. He is under club control for another few years. Gives the Pads a young, controable talent that has a chance to be an All-Star if he stays healthy (Get Well Soon Wil).  I think Buddy wasn't capable of cultivating the talent to reach those 5 year goals. All the young talent the Padres have had the past 8 years, NONE of them have gotten better. Not a single one, there is one person that is on and that's the manager. He didn't provide these guys the tools to get better."
Padres,3a7j77,rowbearski,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:48:32 2015 UTC,Padres have not had a lot of young talent. They drafted terribly. My understanding is Spangenberg comes from the first draft class that can be attributed to the new draft team. He's made it and doing well. Unfortunately we won't see how Buddy could handle the talent from the new draft team.
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"In 2012 the Padres had the top minor league system. From SI, ""They might lack that one marquee name, but no system in baseball can boast of having as many players at the upper levels who project as average or better big leaguers"". Granted, injuries hit hard but the fact is the Padres had talent in the minors.   Grandal, Alonso, Rizzo all came over in trades and none of them lived up to the hype. Grandal and Rizzo are borderline stars and Alonso seems to becoming the player many of us envisioned.   I am not saying that getting the talent is on Buddy at all. But to say that he was able to get the most out of all of the guys he was given is totally ridiculous."
Padres,3a7j77,rowbearski,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"You said it yourself, injuries wrecked the players. Even non-pitchers were getting Tommy John surgery. Then Preller traded away almost all of that farm system, so we will never be able to say what would have happened with those players had they stayed in the Padres farm system."
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that the injuries to that class hurts my argument. The fact remains the same, none of the young players brought up during Black's tenure as manager reached their potential. Hundley, Venable, Blanks, Headley, Latos, Gyorko, Maybin, Forsythe, Kouzmanoff basically every single young player either stagnated or got worse."
Padres,3a7j77,rowbearski,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:03:44 2015 UTC,Eh? Not much of a fact if you have to concede injuries effected it.
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, totally on point.   Preller can't do it alone, he's got to have a clubhouse leader that is aligned with the front office that is hiring and leading a coaching team and staff that can develop players."
Padres,3a7j77,Friard,0,Wed Jun 17 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"Writer also forgot Forscythe, who has developed into the Rays best hitter. That brings the total to 4; Maybin, Forscythe, Grandal and Jace Peterson. All traded within the last year and playing exponentially better. That's not a fluke, thats a trend. Id like just one article that states firing Black was the right move. Not for any reason other than a different perspective.  Sports writers in my opinion have a reactionary and generally unresearched take on this move."
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,0,Wed Jun 17 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"All of them, with the exception of Peterson, were injured while they were here."
Padres,3a7j77,Friard,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:30:54 2015 UTC,"Not really much of an excuse, injuries occur. Maybin had long stretches of playing time and never showed the breakout potential he is showing now. Same goes for Forscythe. Really the only player that injuries  affected was Grandal."
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:49:13 2015 UTC,Maybin had hand injuries the entire time he was with us. Forsythe had Plantir Fasciitis.
Padres,3a7j77,Friard,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"Plantir facitis is a 3-12 month injury, he was with the club 3 years. Thats too much of a sample size to blame on a single injury. Maybin was a Padre for 4 years and had already shown breakout potential with the Marlins.  Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said he isn’t surprised by Maybin’s success in Atlanta.  “He’s really bought into (hitting coach Kevin) Seitzer and (assistant hitting coach Jose) Castro’s approach,” Gonzalez said before Monday’s game against the Padres. “There were spurts with him in 2011, 2012 when he was with the Padres. He’s carrying it over now and he’s doing it for a long time now.”  hitters under Bud Black rarely saw sustained success at the plate. They would have ""spurts"" of streaky hitting but nothing sustained over long periods of time. That develops with coaching discipline and philosophy. Do you think Bud Black was a good developer of hitting talent, is that your argument?"
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:06:29 2015 UTC,"My argument is he never had good players who stayed healthy. Maybin had hand injuries the entire time he was with us. Last season is when he finally had surgery on it.  Logan had 1 good year, then he was sidelined by Plantir Fasciitis the following year. The next two years he split with the Padres and the Marlins and he wasn't good. This year he has bounced back."
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty much reaffirms my hunch that there was more than just Black's recent in-game fails, but also about his players stagnating in their development.   I mean our farm system was high up there just a few years ago, and when guys don't develop in the bigs, but then thrive after they leave - that's pretty damning evidence.  Jedd has stagnated just as  Grandal, Maybin, Rizzo, Boxberger, et al did under Black's watch."
Padres,3a7j77,violaxcore,3,Wed Jun 17 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"Grandal had a terrific 1st year when he was on roids, then he was injured and out his second year, and his 3rd year was his recovery year. Can't really hang all that on Bud.  Maybin has had injury problems all through out his career. I am just waiting for him to regress.  Rizzo was never going to be the productive player here at Petco with the fences where they were before. Can't hang that on Bud.  Edit: the writers conclusion doesn't support your idea. ""For the most part, though, Black got the most out of what he had. Even this season, the Padres actually might be overachieving based upon their component statistics -- BaseRuns, which estimates the number of runs a team should have scored and allowed, projects that the team should be 27-40, not 32-35."""
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,0,Wed Jun 17 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"I believe sabremetrics stats still really liked grandal last year. Everyone thought we were giving up a really good player in the kemp trade. I think that was much more of a he didnt want to be here, and we didnt want him here kind of deal."
Padres,3a7j77,Hancock02,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree."
Padres,3a7j77,youreaturtle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, black should have stayed on the pitching side of things. There's a reason there are what 2 former pitching coaches that are team managers now?"
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,2,Wed Jun 17 21:44:07 2015 UTC,"The other one is in Boston, and he's on the hot seat as well.   Great point on hitter's development under Bud's tenure. Bud has had what like 5 hitting coaches? You'd have to think he had some say in the hiring of those coaches and his staff. The fact Bud couldn't figure out how to hire the right hitting coaches and also spoke volumes. A lot of that is Petco, but some of that goes back to the hitting coaches and the guy in charge of them."
Padres,3a7j77,violaxcore,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:50:53 2015 UTC,I'd rather have Bud than Farrell... :/
Padres,3a7j77,Maxwell69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:44:21 2015 UTC,A lot of it goes back to having crappy players. Let's see a hitting coach do something with Orlando Hudson and Jason Bartlett.

Granted, people expected a lot out of him, of course, but holy shit guys we need to stay up and not talk so much shit about our own players. There's always improvements to be made and more games to win and you never know what the hell is gonna happen. We can't be on the edge of leaving the damn team after a loss, no matter if it's our first loss out of 20 games or our 10th loss in a row. Stick with the team and don't just flop one day to the next. Away teams constantly fill up our stadium and it's about time we take some damn pride in this squad. Be proud of being from here, or being a fan of this team. Go to games and represent, even if you can't go to games, represent in other areas and be the best damn padre fan you can be.

Baseball is a great sport regardless of how well your team is going and if someone can't appreciate it otherwise then they're not going to be any fun. It seems harsh, but I insist it's true.   People build up their own expectations and there are people who can't manage themselves when those expectations aren't met. People for feeling frustrated when they get passionate for something and it goes wrong on a grand scale or when a single player isn't perfect in a tight scenario costing a game.   I'm getting fatigued by threads like this just as I am the bitchy spoiled types who say ""fuck this"" without giving any relevant insight. It's not something contained just within our own fanbase. We all want the Padres to succeed, we have different ideas how they could do it. If you're unhappy take the time to give us something with a bit more thought and not baseless expletives and we should let the people who take the time to put thought into something critical to say it. That's how I got sick of Zack. He'd flood GDTs with two word sentences without meaning."

I wish I could say I put it through that 5.5 hole too, but I went 0fer.   Another one of my fondest memories was meeting Tony for 30 seconds, and him making me feel like we were friends for 30 years. At a LB State baseball game, he was managing SD State and took time well before game time to recognize those who traveled to see him and support his team, and I was fortunate enough to be in that small group. Just shaking that man's hand is an honor that I will never forget. He will always be remembered for his genuine and humble personality that he shared with everyone. I miss you so much Tony, you will continue to be an example of excellence both on and off the diamond for every generation that proceeds you.   ""Heroes get remembered, but legends never die."""
Padres,3a1tg9,SunriseSurprise,3,Tue Jun 16 18:36:36 2015 UTC,Can't believe it's been a year. Truly a one-of-a-kind legend.
Padres,3a1tg9,Flesh_Lettuce,4,Tue Jun 16 16:00:09 2015 UTC,RIP Mr Padre
Padres,3a1tg9,FanDiego,4,Tue Jun 16 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"Love Tony. Played the sport the right way, gave to the community, and was a genuine role model.  Still miss him."
Padres,3a1tg9,banksy_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:54:10 2015 UTC,"Well said. I think I learned more from Tony off the field than on the field. Things how like how to relate to somebody in different circumstances than you, how to behave and conduct yourself like a man, how to win/lose with dignity and respect for the game. Tony was the complete package as a person, not just as a ball player. As a young man, I couldn't have made a better choice as far as a role model."
Padres,3a1tg9,kremss,2,Tue Jun 16 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Nor Cal as a Padre fan. I'm almost 40. My mom called me that morning and told me Tony passed away. I lived 400 miles away from San Diego and he was my childhood hero. It crushed me. I couldn't imagine what it was like for those of you that grew up watching him daily.  I would get so excited when he showed up on This week in baseball on Saturday mornings, or the baseball bunch with Johnny bench.  He is missed."

Padres,3a32ne,espo619,5,Tue Jun 16 21:04:55 2015 UTC,"This part struck me:   Before Opening Day, a combination of the ZiPS and Steamer player projections and the playing-time forecasts at FanGraphs yielded a .519 winning-percentage projection for the Padres. When Black was fired, San Diego’s record stood at 32-33, only 1.5 wins off their projected pace. From that perspective, one could spin Black’s ouster as a byproduct of unrealistic expectations driven by San Diego’s winter transaction spree."
Padres,3a32ne,Clint_Swift,4,Wed Jun 17 04:33:01 2015 UTC,Yep.  Weren't most reasonable people predicting something on the order of 85 wins?  How far below that pace is 32-33?  Not very.
Padres,3a32ne,b4sunryze,2,Wed Jun 17 15:23:35 2015 UTC,"This part struck me:   But the Padres’ underlying stats tell a more pessimistic story. By third-order record, Baseball Prospectus’s estimate of the record a team’s offensive and defensive stats would typically produce, the Padres have played like the worst team in the NL West. Their actual win-loss totals look borderline respectable because San Diego has enjoyed fantastic timing.   Followed by this part:   The other interpretation is that the underlying performance is more likely to last than the clutchness, in which case the Padres would be justified in acting before the bottom fell out — assuming, of course, that Black deserved some of the blame.    The above pythag record has more to do with cluster luck than Black's managerial prowess and tactical in-game decisions.   Fundamentals and the underlying numbers showed a regression in pitching from last year and incredible inconsistency on offense. You can't put all that blame on Bud over a small sample size this year - as there were key injuries, to go along with clear roster holes and spotty defensive players.   However, I don't think it's itchy-finger reaction. I don't think Preller was lying to us when he said that he was contemplating making this move for at least 2 weeks. If you read the tea leaves, when the Padres denied the Brewers request to interview Pat Murphy, that's evidence they've been evaluating Black for much longer and had a back-up plan in case they had to pull-the-trigger.   As an aside, I think a great point that was brought up during the Braves series that was pretty damning is the development of former Padres AFTER they leave the team with Maybin, Grandal, Rizzo, et al all thriving after joining another clubhouse.   Edit: Well connected Ken Rosenthal just came out with this piece, Click for article:""Did lack of player development lead Padres to fire Bud Black?"" That pretty much reaffirms my hunch that there was more than just Black's recent in-game fails, but also about his players stagnating in their development."
Padres,3a32ne,mrdov,3,Wed Jun 17 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"As an aside, I think a great point that was brought up during the Braves series that was pretty damning is the development of former Padres AFTER they leave the team with Maybin, Grandal, Rizzo, et al all thriving after joining another clubhouse.   I don't think this is a very truthful point. Yeah those guys have performed better elsewhere, but it's not because of Buddy.   Rizzo only got 128 (pretty bad, but still) ML at-bats as a 21 year old before the Padres decided to ship him off. That's more on the front office giving up on Rizzo too quickly and preferring Alonso over him.   Grandal was developing just fine with the Padres. People seem to forget a torn ACL ended his 2013 early and really ruined the first half of his 2014. In 2012 and 2013 before the injury he was doing really well. First half of 2014 was bad because he rushed back too quickly, but even the second half of 2014 he was back to normal. He only looks so good this year because it's his first time since 2012 staying healthy this far into the season.  Maybin is someone that always showed promise when he was healthy and getting regular playing time. His issue with the Padres was he couldn't stay healthy enough to stay on the field and find a rhythm. And that's what's happening for him now with the Braves. He's been given a chance to be an everyday CF and he's playing (and even improved) like he did with the Padres his last 2 fully healthy years in 2011 and 2012."
Padres,3a32ne,b4sunryze,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"Great points, nothing is black and white - especially when factors out of your control such as injuries come into play (although, how you rest players and when you take them out to give them a breather is the manager's call most of the time)   Agreed, Rizzo's sample size was too small to make an impact. But when was the last time a rookie thrived immediately under Black's clubhouse? Rizzo started slow from his call-up, Jace Peterson was the same way, Spangenberg did really light it up. Maybe it's the coaching staff's way of on-boarding new players and younger ones that was ineffective.  But Grandal also had communication issues and was basically blackballed by the pitching staff even though he was never told why- when there are communication break-downs in the clubhouse, I blame the Manager for fostering that culture and not facilitating enough dialogue between players.  Maybin - Injuries really muddled up his development. But even when he was healthy, he was very inconsistent. Bud could never add or help his hitters, he was a pitcher. The first reason that gets mention of Cameron's success is his work with Kevin Seitzer, and Maybin started this while as a Padre.   The best Black could do was have a say in the hiring of his staff and hitting coaches. Even then there was what how many different hitting coaches? All that can't be blamed solely on Petco, it goes back to hiring the right hitting coaches and having the right environment to teach and develop players.  The answer, btw, was 5 hitting coaches under Bud Black.    In the season’s first few weeks, I kept hearing the Braves broadcast crew, Chip Caray and Joe Simpson, talk about how much Maybin liked Seitzer’s hitting philosophy.  When Cameron was still with San Diego during spring training, he talked to Padres hitting coach Mark Kotsay about integrating some of Seitzer’s principles into his hitting regiment.  Two weeks later, Maybin found himself learning under the man he admired in Atlanta. Source"
Padres,3a32ne,Maxwell69,2,Wed Jun 17 21:36:03 2015 UTC,Spagenberg is doing quite well this year.
Padres,3a32ne,mrdov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"As far as impact rookies, there is a good deal of blame that needs to be given to the organization as a whole. As far as splitting the blame between Buddy/ML and the minors, I tend to say the minors should take more of the blame than Buddy but I really don't know how much is expected out of each level in player development. Gyorko is worth noting as well. He did really well out of the gate his rookie year before struggling due to injury. But then his development has more than stalled so that is probably one that's on the major league guys.  Grandal is a curious case because he's said a lot of negative things about the Padres since he left and I'm not sure how much is true or not. I do know he lost a lot of playing time at C and was pushed to 1B last year but I thought that was more due to trying to slowly bring him back from the torn ACL (for a while they wouldn't let him catch back to back games) along with the emergence of Rene Rivera.  I don't really have much to add about Maybin other than coaches really should be flexible for individual preference, and I hope Kotsay did listen to Maybin and incorporate some of that stuff."

Padres,3a32ne,b4sunryze,2,Wed Jun 17 14:15:18 2015 UTC,"Former Padre Yasmandi Grandal, who is thriving in LA BTW with 140 OPS+ and .863 OPS and gets raves from Kershaw, basically threw Bud Black under the bus if you read between the lines.  The parts bolded basically implies there was no communication between Grandal and Black telling him why he was taken off catching duty for our top pitchers.   And then the other part basically implies only the Front Office new of Grandal's work ethic and he was basically ignored by the coaches.   Grandal's a 26 year old, pretty young to be turning your back and giving him the silent treatment on a player with that potential, especially if you're the manager.   As Fox Sports’ MLB Insider Ken Rosenthal astutely pointed out last month, Grandal didn’t start behind the plate after July 18th when any of those three were on the mound. That speaks volumes, ...  Grandal said he loved the fresh start with the Los Angeles Dodgers and shrugged when asked about falling out of favor with the Padres pitchers.  “I thought my relationship was fine. Obviously some of them didn’t feel the same way. Nobody really came up to me and kind of tried to guide me to work or say something else, but at the same time,I thought I was fine so nobody really talked to me so the communication wasn’t there. Obviously that’s one of the reasons we parted ways.”  Clayton Kershaw has spoken glowingly of Grandal’s work ethic as have several of his teammates, but Grandal said that part of his game and work ethic has never changed.  “It’s always been the same, I’ve never changed. It just so happens when I did it here in San Diego, nobody really saw that. Probably the front office was the only people that would see me here at 9:00 working out every day and then going through the scouting report and then going home and coming back at 1. It’s the same routine, it hasn’t changed. I’m just glad that someone’s actually seeing the work I’m putting into it because I do like to work.” Source: Mighty 1090"

As much as we want to rip our hair out and shout at the Pads for being inconsistent, we just cant throw in the towel yet. Still a good 3 months to go . I mean , at least we are not the Phils or Brewers. I am still somewhat optimistic that we are still in this MotherF%ker . No easy road for the Midgets or the hated neighbors up the I-5 in SmelLA .

Our record was understandable because of how tough a schedule we had played. 3 of the last 4 series have been against sub .500 teams and we have won exactly one of those series.

Why would this be a change just to make a change? The starters are not getting the job done. Yet we know the talent is there, we have seen what this rotation is capable of. Maybe if a young starter came in and showed better results the vets would be inclined to pitch better. Simply ""hoping for the best"" is not a strategy when things are not going well. We need to change the dynamic of what we are seeing on the field."

Padres,3a3fsw,sneakAstroke,0,Tue Jun 16 23:25:33 2015 UTC,"Why do our managers insist on putting Kimbrel in non-save situations? When you take a closer out of that role, they lose their ""closer"" edge that makes them thrive in that spot in the first place. It's infuriating. One game into Murphy's career as a big league manager and he shows incompetence."
Padres,3a3fsw,jacobs64,5,Tue Jun 16 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"The thinking behind it is you want your best reliever in your highest leverage situations. The rest is on the players to perform, not the manager. It may not work out every time, but I certainly don't question the move or reasoning behind it."
Padres,3a3fsw,banksy_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:26:35 2015 UTC,"There are certainly higher leverage situations that can arise. Top 9 with no outs isn't that high leverage compared to what can happen later on. If you bring Kimbrel in when there are 2 on with 2 outs, that makes more sense. Being a closer takes a different attitude and putting them in when it is less high leverage is questionable. He has lost a few games now when it isn't a save situation."
Padres,3a3fsw,jacobs64,2,Tue Jun 16 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"How likely is a change at that point though? I think we saw it once this year in the 9th, tie game,  with runners on 2nd and third less than 2 outs, Buddy called Kimbrel in. Managers tend to put a guy out for the 9th that they believe gives them the best chance to win the game in that inning and sticks with him. For that, I would want my best guy."

Padres,3a20ty,myep0nine,2,Tue Jun 16 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"The Padres fired manager Bud Black on Monday afternoon, cutting short his ninth season as San Diego’s skipper. This moves comes despite the fact that the Padres’ winning percentage has improved in three of the last four seasons and in each month of the current season. So if Black’s team was winning more in 2015 than in '14 (in which it won more than '13) and more in June than it did in May (in which it won more than it did in April), why is Black, who won the National League’s Manager of the Year award in '10, suddenly out of a job? The answer is that expectations in San Diego rose faster this winter than the team’s winning percentage has this spring.  That’s not Black’s fault. Under the leadership of rookie general manager A.J. Preller, who was hired away in early August from the Rangers, for whom he served as assistant GM, the Padres made one high-profile acquisition after another this winter, adding, in rapid succession, catcher Derek Norris, outfielders Matt Kemp, Wil Myers and Justin Upton, righthanded starter James Shields and closer Craig Kimbrel. Those are some impressive bold-faced names, including the best closer in baseball (Kimbrel) one of the three best free-agent starting pitchers on the market (Shields), a former MVP candidate (Kemp), a former Rookie of the Year (Myers), an All-Star catcher (Norris) and a 27-year-old slugger with two Silver Sluggers in his trophy collection (Upton). It’s no wonder that expectations spiked in San Diego coming into the season.  However, a clear-eyed assessment of the Padres' radically rebuilt roster would have noted that Preller did little to bolster the team’s weak infield—busted third-base prospect Will Middlebrooks and veteran good-field, no-hit shortstop Clint Barmes were his only additions there—while his attempt to shoehorn Upton, Myers and Kemp into the outfield would have a deleterious effect on the team’s overall fielding performance. Those concerns were why I was the only SI.com baseball writer not to pick the Padres to make the playoffs, and the reality of the situation proved to be worse than expected.  The Padres' outfield defense has indeed been terrible. Expecting Myers to play a competent centerfield proved to be a pipe dream, the reality of which has led to Myers making five of his last six starts at first base, pushing Yonder Alonso to third base. Kemp, who was among the worst fielders in baseball in 2014, has been less disastrous as a full-time rightfielder, but remains well below average with Upton equally inept in left. As a result, the Padres have sunk from ninth in the majors in park-adjusted defensive efficiency a year ago to 23rd this year.  To make matters worse, Kemp has been below average at the plate as well, hitting a mere .249/.289/.340 (79 OPS+), making him a sub-replacement-level player on the year. Second baseman Jedd Gyorko was even worse (.210/.282/.311, 70 OPS+) before being shipped back to the minors for the first time since 2012 (not counting rehabilitation assignments). Black deserves credit for quickly shifting to rookie Cory Spangenberg at the keystone, but he has shown more patience, arguably too much, with Middlebrooks (.227/.259/.389, 83 OPS+) at third base. As a result, third base has been the Padres' second least-productive position this season. Middlebrooks, of course, was a Preller acquisition, whereas Gyorko has been in the organization since being drafted under Jed Hoyer in 2010.  The Padres have also had their share of injuries this season. Myers has hit, but the Padres announced on Monday that he is headed back to the disabled list due to the same tendonitis in left wrist that has already cost him a month of this season. Alonso seems to be having something of a breakout season at the age of 28, but he, too, spent nearly a month on the DL with a bone bruise in his right shoulder. In the rotation, oft-injured free agent Brandon Morrow lasted all of five starts before landing back on the disabled list with a shoulder issue, while oft-injured free agent Josh Johnson, whom Preller re-signed coming off Tommy John surgery, is still rehabbing from his April 2014 surgery. Meanwhile, despite pitching half their games in one of the most pitcher-friendly parks in baseball, the Padres pitchers have allowed the second-most home runs in the National League (75 to the Brewers’ 77).  According to third-order record, which calculates expected runs scored and allowed from the individual elements of run scoring then calculates an expected winning percentage from that, the Padres have played like a 28–37 (.429) team thus far this season. In reality, however, they are 32–33 (.492), thanks in part to an 11–8 record over their last 19 games.  Despite all of that, Black, who is widely regarded as one of the best managers in baseball and who, for years, has gotten more than expected out of lousy rosters thanks in part to his ability to rotate his lineups, massage his bullpen and put his players in position to succeed, has been fired on the heels of a 2–1 series loss to the Dodgers. L.A. is one of the best teams in baseball, but the Padres were outscored by a grand total of just 9–7 over those three games. This is nothing new. Sacrificing the manager for the sins of the players or the front office is an age-old baseball tradition, but let’s not pretend there was anything else going on here. To whatever small degree a manager can have a positive impact on his team’s performance, the Padres just got that much worse, while other teams contemplating a managerial switch or looking for a sharp, experienced baseball man for their front office, just gained a top candidate."

Padres,3a20ty,weavdaddy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that for some reason the Padres when they are way out of it always start to play extremely well in late August-September, ruining their chances for good draft picks. The Padres were 4 losses away from having their 1st round pick protected. I love what the Red Sox did last year, they realized they weren't going to be able to win so they basically blew up the entire ball team and anything that was of some value was shipped off, making them lose quite a lot more games in the process. This off season they signed two free agents with Qualifying Offers and still had the $7 pick."

Bud's in-game management has been questionable at best and his lineup decisions have held back our offense.  Finally, I don't think he's done a good enough job of holding under-performers accountable.   Currently reading Big Data Baseball by Travis Sawchick, a great book about the Pirates transformation to a progressive analytic team and it's absolutely imperative to have a manager that is aligned with the Front Office.   The Astros were quick to cut the ties on their manager and everyone thought that was a panic move, look at how they're doing now.   Bud's been given enough slack, Preller and the new owners still deserves more time."
Padres,39y4yu,b4sunryze,4,Mon Jun 15 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"Agree 100% with you! Buddy may be a great manager, but he is responsible for losing multiple games this year, notably two in this last series against LA. We could have swept this weekend, and instead it's another lost series on the season. Those two losses weren't on underperformers, Bud lost those games singlehandedly."
Padres,39y4yu,AllHailHisNoodliness,7,Mon Jun 15 21:14:56 2015 UTC,Bud lost those games singlehandedly.   so Buddy pitches now?    although i agree with you - to blame it on BB is not entirely accurate.  Team effort = team loss  Buddy needed to go after what AJ did though.  We need Dick Williams reincarnated
Padres,39y4yu,og_sandiego,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Bringing Thayer out the night after he blows it in a crucial series was the final straw.   Judging the last game as more important than the whole season is fecal-wipe stupid, and is the kind of failure in judgement that leads panicky morons to scramble around pissing on everything within reach just for the sake of ""DOING SOMETHING"". It doesn't work, and usually makes things worse."
Padres,39y4yu,no-fun-at-parties,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"I agree it is fecal-wipe stupid, if this move was made in isolation of this weekend's snafu's. But note I said that was the final straw. One that has been building for over 7 years of mediocrity.   Thayer shouldn't have come in the first place and wouldn't have to if Bud didn't exhaust the bullpen in the Atlanta series when he did not have to. That's just not one night's worth of mistakes, that's a series of mistakes building upon each other.   In addition, if you haven't heard the Derek Norris interview on 1360 last night, you should go check it out. He basically says He and James Shields thought Bud should've left our Ace in the game when he only threw 90 pitches at the time he was yanked for Melvin Upton...Melvin Upton. That's the crap you pull to lose the clubhouse.  I don't think it's a failure of judgment, I think this was a long time coming and was a pattern of repeated processes that lead to the same outcome. It just happens this weekend was Bud's comeuppance.  Note Preller's quote about contemplating this for 2 weeks and really evaluating Bud for 8 months.   General manager A.J. Preller said he made the decision after a couple of weeks of thought. He told the players he still believes in them and didn't put all the blame on Black.  ""It wasn't one magic thing. I made the decision last night and I slept on it,"" Preller said. ""At the end of the day, this was the direction we wanted to go. I've evaluated him overall for eight months when I was looking at everything. I've seen inconsistencies, ups and downs. This team is not bottoming out or playing poorly. Just too much inconsistency. We have not played to the level we are capable of.""   source: ESPN   Preller is right the team is damn inconsistent, they're capable of putting up double-digit runs but they were also leading the Majors in the most games of 1 runs or less, having done that 17 times.   source:ESPN"

Padres,39y4yu,jbraun04,15,Mon Jun 15 20:11:49 2015 UTC,"Buddy didn't fit these guys. They need a Fire and Brimstone guy, someone to light a fire under them. Buddy doesn't have that in him. That's what pissed Shields off yesterday, Buddy doesn't compete the way he should.   He got the horses and he couldn't get them to run, I don't care what other excuses people come up with. Bud was just too conservative to be a winning manager, and that's why we never made the playoffs under him."

Our season being over was coming quickly, and Buddy was not getting it done.  We added too many pieces and we likely lose Upton Funk at the end of the year.  It's time to do it.  It took balls.  Let's get some fucking wins, now.  At least, slightly more than we lose."
Padres,39y4yu,FanDiego,13,Mon Jun 15 19:31:39 2015 UTC,If Upton leaves having only spent half of one season in a Padres jersey....I think I'll cry tears of utter frustration and agony.

Padres,39y4yu,Sane_Wicked,2,Mon Jun 15 20:04:45 2015 UTC,Yup. Preller will look to get soe prospects back with an upton trade if this padres team cant turn it around soon

Padres,39y4yu,n0teye,11,Mon Jun 15 19:46:54 2015 UTC,You realize Bud Black was given the least talented teams throughout his tenure and Padres payroll was in bottom five for 90% of his tenure with the Padres right?

Padres,39y4yu,mrdov,5,Mon Jun 15 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"Those teams below the Padres in payroll but still succeed actually have success developing their own players. Padres are awful at developing draft picks, and Buddy has very little to do with that."

Padres,39y4yu,flying_monkies,0,Mon Jun 15 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"Bud managed for 9 years, Bochy managed for 11.

Winning percentage for each manager through their career with the Padres:  Bochy: .494 / Post season record .333  Black: .477 / Post season record .000  With the exception of the 2010 season, a Bud coached team never finished higher than 3rd in the west.

Padres,39y4yu,rurounijosie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:45:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly, just a matter of time.  The key is how close we get to that trade deadline.  Because even as a barely .500 team  I see them selling.  At least JUp, I'd love to keep him, but idk how deep the pockets are now."
Padres,39y4yu,BobFreakingSaget,6,Mon Jun 15 22:51:39 2015 UTC,FIRE BUD BLACK....oh.
Padres,39y4yu,chrissytheblack,3,Mon Jun 15 22:57:54 2015 UTC,DANG THIS IS CRAZY
Padres,39y4yu,cysticpage,3,Mon Jun 15 19:18:35 2015 UTC,Wtf
Padres,39y4yu,McRioT,3,Mon Jun 15 19:20:45 2015 UTC,Was I out of the loop because this came to somewhat of a sudden surprise?
Padres,39y4yu,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Mon Jun 15 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"I think people were expecting it later in the season, or maybe after the season. It's a surprise to most everyone that it was done so quickly."
Padres,39y4yu,SensationAzn04,3,Mon Jun 15 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man, a shocker that it happened during the season!  The emotions are probably too high w/ many of these heartbreaking losses as of late.  Tough to see Bud Black go, but he'll ultimately be fine and will not be job-less for long!"
Padres,39y4yu,ry83,3,Mon Jun 15 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"Always liked Bud, don't know how to feel about this but there seems to have been a lot of hate and thats understandable. Just wasn't expecting him to get canned so soon."
Padres,39y4yu,padsboltssaints15,3,Mon Jun 15 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"This is crazy. I've got mixed feelings now.   I've always had a soft spot for Buddy. He's been the manager ever since I became a fan. He's a great guy, seems like he'd be cool to chill and talk baseball with. I'm kind of sad to see that face go.  But I was definitely questioning his decisions more this year. Maybe it's because I'm paying more attention every game than I have for the past four years. But lately I'm finding myself wondering what he was thinking when he did this or that. Of course sometimes it's chalked up to players not doing their job, but he's still been questionable for me.   Sad to see him go. But if this means change, and if this finally lights a fire under the team, then I'm okay with it. We'll have to see just how much we really loved Buddy based on what happens from here on out."
Padres,39y4yu,PsychicWarElephant,2,Mon Jun 15 19:35:50 2015 UTC,Thus is the first year we have had some legit pieces. He didn't know how to use them.
Padres,39y4yu,gregesca,3,Mon Jun 15 20:12:49 2015 UTC,They should have at least given him till the all star break....

Padres,39y4yu,sneakAstroke,4,Mon Jun 15 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"I'm torn, he didn't have much talent to be successful throughout his time. But with this team he hasn't made great decisions at all! Which was evident yesterday. I hope this lights a fire under everyone's ass! Go Pads!!!"
Padres,39y4yu,WellonDowd,4,Tue Jun 16 06:06:38 2015 UTC,Ted Leitner should manage the rest of the season.
Padres,39y4yu,BobTaco,2,Mon Jun 15 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"This is stupid. Who is remotely better than Black? Nobody is available. And the team is finally healthy (for the most part). Black is always awesome after the allstar break. Should have waited until the end of the season.   If things don't take a dive, I'm going to be amazed. Imo, this is the Padres throwing in the towel in June."
Padres,39y4yu,krucz36,2,Mon Jun 15 19:33:13 2015 UTC,I kinda felt that he deserved 100 games. But ah well. Off goes Buddy.
Padres,39y4yu,BobTaco,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:56:18 2015 UTC,Yea. 100 would have been a good number.
Padres,39y4yu,meeorxmox,2,Mon Jun 15 20:50:36 2015 UTC,i dont know how to feel... i suppose happy but god damn didnt see this coming
Padres,39y4yu,Friar_Faithful,2,Tue Jun 16 05:00:46 2015 UTC,Thought they'd give him the year. Always liked Black but hey let's see how this move works out!
Padres,39y4yu,alexm5488,2,Mon Jun 15 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"I always had mixed feelings on BB. I never hated him, but this year has been extremely frustrating. I didn't expect him to get fired during the season though. Will be interesting to see Dave Roberts take over the role, and I'm definitely very curious as to who they will bring in on a permanent basis.  Who knows? Maybe this will be a catalyst for the team. It's definitely happened before, and obviously the talent is there. Even as mediocre as we've been, we're only 6 out with 100 games left."
Padres,39y4yu,couchmeister,2,Mon Jun 15 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised. I guess the Dodgers series was the last straw, but I still thought they'd give him the year or at LEAST until the all star break. Hopefully it ends up being a change for the better."
Padres,39y4yu,Maxwell69,2,Mon Jun 15 19:32:27 2015 UTC,I don't agree with this.
Padres,39y4yu,n0teye,2,Mon Jun 15 19:49:39 2015 UTC,Dislike.
Padres,39y4yu,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Mon Jun 15 19:49:53 2015 UTC,"Welp, let's hope Buddy doesn't go and take the D-Bags to three World Series or anything."
Padres,39y4yu,Hancock02,2,Mon Jun 15 19:52:34 2015 UTC,Bochy come back! You can blame it all on me!
Padres,39y4yu,KeepinItOneHunda,2,Mon Jun 15 19:57:40 2015 UTC,I stated in the offseason he was on the chopping block and 100% of the reaction was disagreeing with me. I think they fired him way too early but we should have seen it coming. Too soon though.
Padres,39y4yu,UserDrew,2,Mon Jun 15 20:38:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, I miss the big news when it's fresh in the hour! I'm surprised, more so than sending Gyrko to the minors. I understood and commiserated with the fire Bud Black camp, I thought he would go to the end of the year.   Even when the Padres weren't good ""on paper"", he did some questionable things and it's easy to blame him. The lack of development in projected talented players who never seemed to live up to their potential, lack of consistent play time, bouncing people around in the order, or keeping people in batting spots where their talent probably wasn't best used if they had the talent. Hell even in 2008-2010 when the Padres were probably their strongest this side of 2005 (excluding the current team of course), I remember some questionable calls. I wonder if, in retrospect, that August collapse what he could've done to prevent it. Putting in Thayer who, between this year and last, struggled against the Dodgers was a terrible call and I think last night after the game he knew (looking back on some of the post game commentary) that he was done. I think now that it's sad. A likeable guy, totally sold to the fans, and he gets cut. That's baseball. It's romanticized but it will also fillet the people in it."

Padres,39y4yu,Hiazm,2,Mon Jun 15 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"From what I could tell, the players didn't really have a whole lot of respect for Buddy. Shields was even caught giving Black some choice words in the dugout yesterday after being pulled mid-80 pitches.  As we've seen this season, the players really look up to Shields. They likely share the same sentiments.   I do agree partially with what you're saying though. It will be interesting to see how the series in Oakland feels without a skipper."

Padres,39y4yu,UserDrew,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of a manager is always the biggest news for any team. It's like the organization admitting their people on the field are bad and not living up to expectations. There are examples, I think (like the Dbacks a few years ago) were doing so did result in a major collapse, but with some of the go big players on this team I don't think it'll happen. Moreover, I don't think Bud Black was part of Preller's Padres and was probably going to be let go anyway before the start of 2016."

Padres,3a09px,Maxwell69,6,Tue Jun 16 06:01:42 2015 UTC,The A's are terrible everyone said...  This was another blowout. I'm getting frustrated.
Padres,3a09px,BobTaco,2,Tue Jun 16 05:34:49 2015 UTC,"The A's have a terrible record, but the starting pitchers and run manufacturing are there. They just don't work all of the time and/or the bullpen blows."
Padres,3a09px,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Tue Jun 16 05:42:29 2015 UTC,"According to BaseRuns, the A's have performed much better than the Padres this season, they've just been less fortunate in terms of sequencing. (http://www.tangotiger.net/wiki/index.php?title=Base_Runs)  Run differential tells the same story. They're not a terrible team."
Padres,3a09px,JolIyJack,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:35:17 2015 UTC,"Lots of 1-run losses, lots."
Padres,3a09px,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,3,Tue Jun 16 19:01:58 2015 UTC,The A's have still won 26 games. Chill the fuck out. The highs get ignored here and every loss gets treated as the end of the world.
Padres,3a09px,SportsMind,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:59:22 2015 UTC,"Being frustrated is chill. I didn't flip a car over and set it on fire. All I was hearing was that the A's defense and bullpen were bad. IMO, that means it shouldn't be a blowout loss. Keep it close. Fight back. That's all I'm asking."
Padres,3a09px,BobTaco,9,Tue Jun 16 17:34:12 2015 UTC,Lived down here for 5 years and you guys have always been cool. Fuck the Giants.
Padres,3a09px,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,9,Tue Jun 16 05:33:36 2015 UTC,You forgot the Dodgers.
Padres,3a09px,FanDiego,3,Tue Jun 16 05:34:47 2015 UTC,Do you guys hate the Angels? Because we can get a thing going.
Padres,3a09px,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,11,Tue Jun 16 05:35:58 2015 UTC,"AL team, outside of our division, and every game I've been to up there I've never been harassed.  No hate for the Halos.  Maybe others have it."

Padres,3a09px,EagleEyeInTheSky,8,Tue Jun 16 08:38:58 2015 UTC,Time to fire Dave Roberts.
Padres,3a09px,CameraInstructor,3,Tue Jun 16 05:33:37 2015 UTC,"2 games under .500 with a little under 100 games to play. Stop the bitching. Preller will make more moves. The Black firing was long overdue, especially with a new GM. Outside of the Kemp trade, every trade has looked good. Just take a look at the team leaders at the side of the page."
Padres,3a09px,SportsMind,3,Tue Jun 16 06:57:53 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to not say one negative thing for the rest of the season. No complaints, no nothing. Just gonna cheer for my team and know that anything can happen, this is baseball. Fuck every naysayer, let's win this fucking division and take this shit to the playoffs.   KEEP THE FAITH PADREBROS"
Padres,3a09px,carmen_electralytes,8,Tue Jun 16 09:13:15 2015 UTC,Such is the life of a Padre fan

Padres,3a09px,JL_muserwolves,-7,Tue Jun 16 05:38:52 2015 UTC,I'm going to the game tomorrow and I almost feel embarrassed to wear my Jersey.
Padres,3a09px,CameraInstructor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:58:23 2015 UTC,We've been awful - stinking up the league can't get a win if we bribed for it awful and I've never once been embarrassed to be a fan.  Performance is not an embarrassment. player attitude and actions on or off the field perhaps could be embarrassing one day (Sadly I will never wear a Giles jersey) but come on mate. being a fan is about wearing your team colors with pride despite a losing record.
Padres,3a09px,friarfangirl,-3,Tue Jun 16 05:34:52 2015 UTC,I was just talking about that with a friend kind debating wether to wear any Padre gear
Padres,3a09px,NAYARIT,11,Tue Jun 16 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"I understand the frustration, but never lose pride! I always show my padres fandom, win or lose."
Padres,3a09px,JOE619,3,Tue Jun 16 05:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am pretty frustrated and I as bad as I am a Padre fan and Keep the Faith lately they have been making it real difficult,hopefully they win tomarrow!"
Padres,3a09px,NAYARIT,2,Tue Jun 16 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"lol man I feel ya on the frustration, and it's getting hard to keep the faith, but we gotta stay strong. Maybe the El Paso manager will help us out here. I'm interested to see how this all plays out."
Padres,3a09px,JOE619,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:59:39 2015 UTC,Yeah hopefully it's the jump start needed.
Padres,3a09px,NAYARIT,7,Tue Jun 16 06:03:01 2015 UTC,Lot of season left to be acting like that already.
Padres,3a09px,lamada16,2,Tue Jun 16 06:13:51 2015 UTC,Every game counts it's gonna keep getting harder and harder to stay above 500 if they keep loosing especially to teams like the A's
Padres,39yei0,padsboltssaints15,19,Mon Jun 15 20:21:28 2015 UTC,Bochy had won two consecutive Division titles with the Padres before they let him walk. I think this situation is obviously much different.
Padres,39yei0,padressd,28,Mon Jun 15 20:41:59 2015 UTC,Mattingly gets fired after not winning the WS. Dodgers hire Black. Bochy & Black alternate odd & even WS titles. San Diego burns to ground.
Padres,39yei0,klongbor,8,Mon Jun 15 21:16:12 2015 UTC,I Lol'd. It's sad cause it's prolly what will happen. :/

Padres,39yei0,youreaturtle,5,Mon Jun 15 20:50:15 2015 UTC,"I've seen some Boston games this season. Not sure that even a manager change could fix whatever's going on over there  Edit: No offense to you personally, welcome to our sub!"
Padres,39yei0,Hiazm,3,Mon Jun 15 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"oh no none taken. that's the joke, for sure."
Padres,39yei0,youreaturtle,6,Mon Jun 15 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"Fans practically ran Bochy out of town. I remember calls for his head early in his last year here. Bud is getting much of the same but he's had ZERO success to back up his decisions.  1. Different lineup every day so no consistent offensive production.  2. If not for his botching of bullpen decisions this weekend (yes the pitchers should be responsible for their own performance as well) we maybe sweep the series The only thing FOR Black I'll say is our defense is horrific, and we desperately need a solid middle infield to replace our highly-suspect one atm.  Bring up Murphy, go get an elite young shortstop during the trade deadline, and we'll be in a MUCH better situation."
Padres,39yei0,Uncast,5,Mon Jun 15 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. And as a dagger in the back, that team will probably have Upton."

Padres,39yei0,frakking-anustart,2,Mon Jun 15 22:02:32 2015 UTC,"Well, Bochy did, so that must mean that every manager that gets fired from here on out will."

Padres,39z858,FriarBot,37,Tue Jun 16 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Last night I watched the Padres for four and a half hours and questioned why the hell I continue to root for this team. I woke up this morning and realized I can't not pull for them. I simply can't bring myself to not care for this team. I enjoyed watching them when I first moved to CA in 2002 and had no friends, I enjoyed watching them when I first moved to VA in the summer of 2008 and had no friends and I enjoyed watching them throughout college, especially during some times when my health went to shit. I love when they win and I go to sleep feeling awesome and I love having something to look forward to every day and every year. Sure the Dodgers have Joc Pederson and Adrian Gonzalez and Yasiel Puig but fuck them, they're not MY team. 99% of LA fans will never get the joy from a playoff win that I get from a regular season game. Enjoy the game tonight Padres bros, here's to stiff nipples and a San Diego W."

Padres,39z858,pandajay24,2,Tue Jun 16 03:48:40 2015 UTC,exactly how I feel
Padres,39z858,ry83,5,Tue Jun 16 03:49:50 2015 UTC,"Dude, I'm still here and my primary team is on a 7-game losing streak, dead fucking last in the AL East, ffs, with a $200 million payroll and one more win than the god-forsaken A's you're currently playing.  It's been a tough season. Yours will get better. I hope.  Edit: Aw, c'mon. I'm a Pads fan too. No need for that."
Padres,39z858,youreaturtle,3,Tue Jun 16 03:52:41 2015 UTC,No I getcha man. I actually live in Boston (dat student lyfe) so I know the Sox's woes. It's not the wins/losses over the season so much as this past week has just been extra exhausting for some reason.

Padres,39z858,ralbert,2,Tue Jun 16 00:46:16 2015 UTC,Last 7 days BA  Kemp: .190  Yonder: .143  Norris: .238  So norris-kemp-yonder but none of them have particularly hot bats at the moment
Padres,39z858,violaxcore,2,Tue Jun 16 00:55:21 2015 UTC,Alonso's OPS is .613.

Padres,39z858,FanDiego,2,Tue Jun 16 05:09:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry... But games like this happen, we A's fans get our hopes up, and then we struggle for a stretch.  Come on, we have the worst record in the AL."
Padres,39z858,carmen_electralytes,5,Tue Jun 16 05:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yo, Alonso, I like the fire, but that's a strike."
Padres,39z858,Flesh_Lettuce,6,Tue Jun 16 05:10:32 2015 UTC,"Man, what a day. It's getting hard to watch these games these past few series. Seriously hoping this ship turns around soon."

Padres,39z858,sneakAstroke,5,Tue Jun 16 00:29:26 2015 UTC,It's ridiculous how much baseball we have left. Anything can happen.
Padres,39z858,Friar-Faithful,9,Tue Jun 16 02:22:56 2015 UTC,I was really hoping for a lineup change. Specifically Matt Kemp down a spot or 2.
Padres,39z858,theruinswehold,4,Tue Jun 16 00:05:44 2015 UTC,Hes going yard tonight. I feel it in my bones
Padres,39z858,AbideMan,4,Tue Jun 16 01:11:39 2015 UTC,what. a. day.  Ill see yall at the game tho.  Keep the Faith.  Vindication will be glorious.
Padres,39z858,padsboltssaints15,3,Tue Jun 16 00:21:25 2015 UTC,The players look pretty shook up about Buddy in the pre-game interviews. They're definitely blaming themselves.
Padres,39z858,HeadleysHobos,6,Tue Jun 16 01:56:46 2015 UTC,That's not a good sign. Hopefully it doesn't negatively impact their confidence.
Padres,39z858,billy_c,2,Tue Jun 16 02:04:54 2015 UTC,Kemp didn't seem too broken up. He said they were surprised by the timing and that a lot of players feel like they aren't playing as well as they could be. Not a word about buddy.
Padres,39z858,couchmeister,5,Tue Jun 16 02:26:40 2015 UTC,Anyone else having MLB.Tv issues trying to load the game?

Padres,39z858,FanDiego,5,Tue Jun 16 03:05:54 2015 UTC,All of the interviews with the players are so dang depressing. Everyone seems to just have a vacant look in their eyes today.
Padres,39z858,thefeistygoat,5,Tue Jun 16 03:10:12 2015 UTC,Wait WHAT?  Are the umps fucking retarded?  It hit his uniform.  That is a hit.  What. The. Fuck.
Padres,39z858,JanitorOfSanDiego,4,Tue Jun 16 03:18:45 2015 UTC,"Fuck the replay system, but thank you..."
Padres,39z858,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Tue Jun 16 03:19:16 2015 UTC,I figured it out. All of us San Diego fans are masochists.
Padres,39z858,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Tue Jun 16 03:37:08 2015 UTC,I heard masochism prevents prostate cancer. So we got that going for us
Padres,39z858,FanDiego,2,Tue Jun 16 03:39:13 2015 UTC,Won't prevent a broken heart though.
Padres,39z858,Hiazm,4,Tue Jun 16 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"Man, you guys got shafted on that HBP call, but I guess you guys aren't complaining!"

Padres,39z858,HeadleysHobos,3,Tue Jun 16 03:41:11 2015 UTC,Whatever they're teaching our pitchers in El Paso is fucking fantastic. First Kelley now Vincent
Padres,39z858,espo619,4,Tue Jun 16 04:06:32 2015 UTC,At least the Dodgers lost.
Padres,39z858,rurounijosie,3,Tue Jun 16 04:27:56 2015 UTC,Melvin got a hit!? Praise Roberts!
Padres,39z858,FanDiego,4,Tue Jun 16 04:34:58 2015 UTC,Dave is basically the patron saint of comebacks as far as Boston is concerned. He may have some magic.
Padres,39z858,jbraun04,2,Tue Jun 16 04:36:32 2015 UTC,What a comeback that was.
Padres,39z858,SportsMind,6,Tue Jun 16 04:38:58 2015 UTC,"Oh RISP, you break my heart."
Padres,39z858,FanDiego,3,Tue Jun 16 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting. We signed our ninth rounder for $10k, $151k below slot. Either the kid needs a new agent or a new left arm"
Padres,39z858,FanDiego,3,Tue Jun 16 00:09:23 2015 UTC,Happens all the time. Was agreed to before hand and the only reason he was drafted inside the first 10 rounds.
Padres,39z858,bhahne,3,Tue Jun 16 00:59:48 2015 UTC,Ross looking like Ross.  A good inning... with some walks......
Padres,39z858,FanDiego,3,Tue Jun 16 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"I like the effort Spangey.  But, you were a wee bit late.  A weeeeeee bit."
Padres,39z858,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Tue Jun 16 02:30:18 2015 UTC,Mlb.tv still not working. I paid good money for this and most of the year has been laggy or just doesn't want to work at all. Every game works just fine except Padres.

Padres,39z858,CameraInstructor,3,Tue Jun 16 02:42:49 2015 UTC,Wow that's still just really weird seeing Hahn Solo pitching against us.
Padres,39z858,Flesh_Lettuce,5,Tue Jun 16 02:46:51 2015 UTC,This game feels weird
Padres,39z858,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Tue Jun 16 02:49:05 2015 UTC,It's just awful being a San Diego sports fan.  Chargers might movie.  Padres are a huge letdown.  At least we don't live in a flyover state. Amirite guys?
Padres,39z858,ry83,4,Tue Jun 16 03:07:34 2015 UTC,I'd watch a Chargers movie
Padres,39z858,gshortelljr,3,Tue Jun 16 03:08:39 2015 UTC,It's awful but I'll never root for other teams.
Padres,39z858,FanDiego,4,Tue Jun 16 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, if the Chargers move to LA I won't root for them anymore."
Padres,39z858,carmen_electralytes,3,Tue Jun 16 03:14:32 2015 UTC,really?!
Padres,39z858,FanDiego,3,Tue Jun 16 03:18:50 2015 UTC,"Uh. Alright. That worked out, randomly.  Nice job not getting down or annoyed by that."

Padres,39z858,Hiazm,2,Tue Jun 16 03:34:07 2015 UTC,Worst team in the AL still has 26 wins... they're not all losses.
Padres,39z858,youreaturtle,3,Tue Jun 16 03:39:04 2015 UTC,That Yonder GS feels like it never happened. I thought that would turn it around
Padres,39z858,SportsMind,3,Tue Jun 16 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Spangenberg is young. Pretty soon though, he's gonna need to learn that sometimes...you just watch the first pitch."

Padres,39ydwh,Maxwell69,5,Mon Jun 15 20:24:50 2015 UTC,Explains why we didn't give him up the Brewers.
Padres,39ydwh,gex_squad,3,Mon Jun 15 20:51:12 2015 UTC,Sounds like he will take Robert's place as bench coach.  But it would not surprise me if the Padres want to get a closer look at him as a managerial candidate.
Padres,39ydwh,Fargoleafy,3,Mon Jun 15 20:18:21 2015 UTC,Dave Roberts is fantastic but his whole coaching career has been under Buddy. I figure he won't be that different. Murphy is the way to go if you really want to shake things up.

Padres,39ywzz,b4sunryze,3,Mon Jun 15 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"Cross post from /r/baseball comment I posted earlier:  Murphy's adored by former players from Quackenbush to ASU guys that are gamers like Dustin Pedroia.  He's a winner at every-level he's been involved, both at the college and minor leagues. Bud never was the top guy for a team before he was promoted from being a coach on the Angel's staff.  I am particularly impressed that    At Arizona State Murphy won the Pac-10 championship in 2000 and consecutive Pac-10 championships in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Twice in that same decade, Murphy had teams finish in the Top 3 in the country; a feat matched by only ten other schools. Murphy's ASU teams were consistently present in the national Top 25, including a streak of 100 consecutive weeks in the polls that lasted from 2000 until the middle of 2005. Murphy led the Sun Devils to the postseason for nine straight seasons and 11 of 12.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Murphy_%28baseball_coach%29  source: http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/san-diego-padres-pat-murphy-triple-a-manager-bud-black-aj-preller-milwaukee-brewers-051915  http://sports.yahoo.com/news/minor-league-manager-pat-murphy-may-have-the-right-stuff-for-the-bigs-214550332.html"

The Dutch baseball fans will remember Pat Murphy as manager/coach of the Dutch National team. He managed the team in 1987 and 2000. He will be most remembered by the Dutch as the manager that led the Dutch to their first ever victory against Cuba in an official tournament during the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney Australia."

Somehow our team is ""fundamentally flawed"" because we didn't find a shortstop yet and we are dealing with injuries to good players. I don't even know what the deal is with that thread.  We were also somehow built as a "".500 team"" yet I'm sure if our center fielder and team run scoring leader(MLB run scoring leader before injury) wasn't on the DL, our bullpen wasn't under-performing and we hadn't lost the surprisingly well pitching Morrow we'd be doing a damn sight better.

Padres,39xsqj,jbraun04,3,Mon Jun 15 19:18:29 2015 UTC,Crazy. I thought they would at least give him till the all-star break
Padres,39xsqj,teeceli,13,Mon Jun 15 19:40:52 2015 UTC,"He is was under a much stronger lens this year with so much money invested in the team. No more excuses of he does what he can with a crappy team. It's part of the manager's job to motivate the team and do something when they aren't performing. I think he is was still doing a fine job as a manager but slip any further in the division and he's going to have a tough time keeping his job after the all-star break. It's unfortunate but that's generally how it works, Black is well aware of that. I was at the game yesterday and sending Alonso out to steal a base in a 0-0 game with no outs seemed like a bad move, especially when Alonso would have scored later in the inning. Not sure if it was a botched hit and run but stuff like that get people fired up.   Edit: is/was"
Padres,39xsqj,teeceli,3,Mon Jun 15 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"That and a lot of moves he has made in game have not gone his way. Putting in Kimbrel when it is not a save situation is a good example of something fans notice. There's several things I've seen so far like decisions to steal, bunt (or not), and some pitching moves that haven't gone well. Also it's easy to pick on the manager"
Padres,39xsqj,AbideMan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:21:21 2015 UTC,"I was their too,and I thought the exact same thing and was pissed because they got a few good hits after that stolen base witch would have brought him home and Padres would of won the game"
Padres,39xsqj,NAYARIT,8,Mon Jun 15 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like he left Shields too long in Atlanta to let him blow a 5-0 lead. Although that game had a lot of controversial plays at home that could've gone our way, of course they didn't. So I think he had a shorter leash for Shields in yesterdays game against LA. Where he pulled Shields after about 85 pitches in 7 innings. Then our bullpen lets LA tie it in the 8th, we would have still won the game if it weren't for a game saving catch by Pederson denying Upton of a walk off hit. On Friday, we had the chance to beat Kershaw but the management/availability of the bullpen led to the loss. Thayer lost both of these games, yesterday he basically loaded the bases for Gonzalez and Black still left him in and Gonzalez gets a 2 run single, then he takes him out for Vincent right after, I would have taken Thayer out and let Vincent/Maurer try and get Gonzalez out, not leave Thayer who was not on point and at about 30 pitches. A lot of people are probably like myself, wondering why Maurer didn't pitch in either of these games."
Padres,39xsqj,Loyal_Padre,6,Mon Jun 15 18:43:08 2015 UTC,Nevermind. So who's next? Roberts?
Padres,39xsqj,MrDL104,2,Mon Jun 15 19:51:40 2015 UTC,Roberts in the interim (and potentially in the running permanently).
Padres,39xsqj,Friar_Faithful,7,Mon Jun 15 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"I understand that people put him under more scrutiny this year because of the talent on this team. What I don't understand is why people choose to use him as the scapegoat before the actual players! Thayer blew two games this series and people are complaining about Black's decisions. I can be all for questioning someone's decisions but at the end of the day if you are on a big league club then you are expected to do your job when called upon, and if you fail that responsibility should be on you."
Padres,39xsqj,gex_squad,5,Mon Jun 15 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"Thayer was absolutely exhausted the yesterday and the day before. He had been used 5/7 games and had little to no gas in the tank.   Meanwhile they had Vincent, granted he has struggled, healthy and fully ready to go. I think it was a poor management choice to start Thayer over Vincent in yesterdays game given the result of the game the day before.  The particular reason I am somewhat exhausted with Buddy is he can't keep a consistent lineup and always switches to favor righty lefty match up.  Good hitters will hit a righty or a lefty, some not as well as others, but trust me, I would rather have Barmes in there ANY day of the week over Alexi.   We have no consistency in our lineup keeping our players from finding a groove."
Padres,39xsqj,MrDL104,7,Mon Jun 15 18:50:02 2015 UTC,"You know Alexi is hitting .333 over the last month, right?"
Padres,39xsqj,simboisland,4,Mon Jun 15 19:54:43 2015 UTC,Yeah but... Little Ninja
Padres,39xsqj,Maxwell69,2,Mon Jun 15 19:31:17 2015 UTC,And Vincent was the pitcher who gave up two home runs to Gonzalez at the start of the season. If he brought Vincent in people would complain that Bud had misplaced faith in Vincent in light of his past performance against that hitter.
Padres,39xsqj,UserDrew,2,Mon Jun 15 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"Thayer is good enough, but his track record this season against the Dodgers specifically is pretty bad. His inflated numbers are all a result of 4 REALLY bad innings all against the dodgers, otherwise he would look like an above average reliever. He wasn't stellar against them last year. Anyone who has a managing squad that follows an bit of baseball science would be cautious enough to go with any other reliever in a tight game."

Padres,39xsqj,surfingNerd,2,Mon Jun 15 19:30:16 2015 UTC,"he deserves a full year with a good team to show what he can do.   why? his credentials was, a pitching coach, so the pitching has been great since he arrived, except for this year. Last time I checked (~1 week ago), our pitching staff was leading the league in allowed HRs, our bullpen hasn't been great, and is giving up too many leads late in the game.  I didn't blame him for the hitting in year's past, because he didn't have the talent to begin with, but this year? if he can't help the pitching staff, can't get out more out of your hitters, and makes questionable decisions, than do we need him for?  good guy, I heard, but I want a winning team, so does the front office, and the fans. Sending down Gyorko, firing Buddy, they are sending a message.   Next, every HR you allow, you run an extra mile after the game."
Padres,39xsqj,Darth_Banal,2,Mon Jun 15 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"The biggest reason I thought he deserved a longer chance was because in past years with sub par teams they would usually come together and make a run in the second half. I give Black credit for that. Now that its done, I'm totally on team AJ. It may not work but I love the demand for accountability for a change. Hopefully they bench Kemp for a few games too.

He just never seemed like he would make guys accountable for the fact they are just complaining.   The fact that he was the one constant over the years of some of the worst Padres teams, tells me something. We never improved, nothing changed and Buddy kept the status quo."
Padres,39y9o7,rowbearski,2,Mon Jun 15 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"Unless Maurer had a dead arm, there was no reason for him to be unavailable yesterday. He was about to waste Tyson Ross instead of putting in a guy who had thrown 37 pitches (2 games) over a 4 game stretch."

Padres,39y9o7,OBEYthesky,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:38:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think Preller really wanted him around. Probably wants a coach with more of a hitter's approach than a pitcher's. 2015 would've been his last year regardless and some ultimatum must have been put out there even before today that he was facing termination. If true, that sort of pressure could've had a negative impact on his managerial psyche."
Padres,39y9o7,UserDrew,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"To your point about using both Benoit and Maurer in the Atlanta game, it's probably not a good idea to just throw in lesser relievers anytime you don't have a lead. That's more or less giving up on the game. The Padres did come back and win that game. May not have happened if those guys didn't throw two scoreless innings.   As far as bringing Thayer in for the 12th inning, one thing I've learned is you never know which relievers are available. Even if a guy doesn't pitch in a previous game, even if they get warm that's factored in to availability."
Padres,39y9o7,mrdov,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:05:24 2015 UTC,"Most likely because Preller wants his own guy, Black was in the last year of his contract and once Preller realized that he wasn't going to give Black another one there wasn't really a reason to keep him around anymore."
Padres,39y9o7,weavdaddy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:09:26 2015 UTC,"Preller and the front office are all in to win big this year and if bud couldn't pull off at least 1 series win over the Dodgers by now, there's not much hope of passing them in the standings. they needed to pull him and try to salvage the season. Yes it probably would have been better to find a new manager in the off season given buddy's record but he's very respected in baseball and Preller even said it himself: he wanted to see what buddy could do with a team that actually had talent.. I think the fact that our ace, who we just spent a shit ton of money on, wasn't too happy about getting pulled early on Sunday was just the straw that broke the camels back."

Padres,39yagf,I_AM_METALUNA,5,Tue Jun 16 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I don't think you look for that skipper until the offseason.  I'd be fine with Dave Roberts/Darren Balsley holding down the team until the end of the season.  I can't think of any manager w/o a job who can come in and all of a sudden give the team a boost.  Jack McKeon? Dusty Baker? Jim Tracy? ... yeah, just keep it internal promote from within the minor league system.  The team kept Pat Murphy from joining the Brewers earlier this year.  That's no coincidence."
Padres,39yagf,SensationAzn04,3,Mon Jun 15 19:58:14 2015 UTC,So if you think that it's alright to let Roberts/Balsley run the team for the rest of the season. Does that make us sellers?
Padres,39yagf,weavdaddy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"It certainly comes off like we're sellers, but I don't think there's any experienced manager at home who can come in and all of a sudden make the team better.  So in my opinion, I don't think that makes us sellers (at least not now).  With Roberts/Balsley, at least there's continuity to last through the season.  If Pat Murphy ultimately takes the helm the rest of the season, I'm fine with that.  In addition to head coach experiences, Murphy is familiar w/ the organization."
Padres,39yagf,SensationAzn04,4,Tue Jun 16 14:56:47 2015 UTC,I seriously want Mark Sweeney. No joke.
Padres,39yagf,padressd,3,Mon Jun 15 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"This conversation will probably last a while as I wouldn't consider it a great idea to bring someone completely new in mid-season. We'll see how Roberts does, though I doubt it will be drastically different. And, if it is drastically different, I think it will be because Kemp and co. start doing what they were supposed to do rather than because we handle the bullpen differently. I'm not a huge Bud Black supporter, but I kinda consider it more on the players than Bud at this point.  But, looking forward, idk if this is a popular opinion or not, but I want someone completely fresh. I want someone new-age who subscribes to sabermetrics and will break the mold of what's conventional in MLB right now. I want a lead-off who gets on and not care about speed. OBP all the way. I want our best batters 1, 2, and 4 instead of the conventional 3. I want to stop sacrifice bunting with non-pitchers.  I don't know... it's going to be interesting, but if we're going to move on, we need to really move on. I don't think Bud's specific management decisions were any different than anything we'd get with any old-school manager. I want to break the mold."

Padres,39yagf,pfjpie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:05:19 2015 UTC,From the UT: Who might be the Padres' next manager?
Padres,39v8cm,n0teye,8,Mon Jun 15 02:06:01 2015 UTC,I'm with you man. I believe in this team. Plus our schedule has been made up of 80%+ winning teams. We can do it guys.
Padres,39v8cm,JanitorOfSanDiego,7,Mon Jun 15 02:12:28 2015 UTC,The perspective that I have is that when black has players he out coaches himself. Should have won 2/3 if not sweep but our manager had something to do with it. Fuck this one was a hard pill to swallow. Only good thing was listening to bevacqua  go off on Harry black in the post game
Padres,39v8cm,fryisadog,5,Mon Jun 15 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"I think Bud deserves every bit of heat he gets for this series and I think its good that San Diego media is now questioning some of his managerial decisions. Do I think he's the right man for the job, though? Yes.  We gotta give Bud a year with this squad to see what he can do. We almost swept a series from one of the best teams in baseball. As long as we are showing progress and still in the hunt for the wild card, I'm happy. Anything above that is icing on the cake, imo."
Padres,39v8cm,CameraInstructor,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:01:16 2015 UTC,But the Padres are not showing progress. They've been hovering at .500 for a month and a half
Padres,39v8cm,pad_squad,6,Mon Jun 15 04:23:24 2015 UTC,As compared to what? Although the bullpen faulted them this series all aspects of the club have improved. Just look at the starting pitching in the last 20 games. If I told you two weeks ago that Ian Kennedy is going to nearly pitch a complete game and only give up one earned run would you believe me?   If anything I think Padres have a couple more moves to make to strengthen the depth of the bullpen and it was encouraging to see Nick Vincent called back up.
Padres,39v8cm,fryisadog,2,Mon Jun 15 05:48:12 2015 UTC,"I missed it, what was he saying? I know last night before the game he was getting riled up about the play and some the decisions."
Padres,39v8cm,FalconTI,2,Mon Jun 15 02:45:45 2015 UTC,Basically every team wins 60 games and loses 60. Games like today fall on managers and how we could be a game or two out if black hadn't mismanaged the series and the past dodgers series  Edit-me gud spilling
Padres,39v8cm,stopsucking,4,Mon Jun 15 03:39:06 2015 UTC,They need to play hard the next couple weeks because last away series' in beginning of July are gonna be tough.
Padres,39v8cm,stopsucking,3,Mon Jun 15 03:44:32 2015 UTC,Biggest fear is losing Upton at the deadline. Can you imagine if he was not here? Norris is awesome and is certainly helping but it just seems like Upton is the one who even keeps us in a lot of these games. We'd have been swept this weekend without him.
Padres,39v8cm,rurounijosie,3,Mon Jun 15 16:53:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think they keep Upton around to at LEAST the end of the season. He has been so crucial to the Padres resurgence this year. If only Joc had missed that ball yesterday ..."
Padres,39v8cm,enginedown,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:04:40 2015 UTC,Cursed Joc.
Padres,39v8cm,TheRisingTide,2,Mon Jun 15 18:35:57 2015 UTC,I think the frustration is that we really don't have until the end of the year. We really have up until the deadline.  If we're too far out I'm sure we'll start moving pieces.
Padres,39v8cm,TheRisingTide,2,Mon Jun 15 05:16:57 2015 UTC,I think if the team continues on the same trajectory and the team is around .500 by the all-star break we will be setup well. I say that because this will force the hand of ownership to make additional big plays before the trade deadline to fill in the gaps that have been identified thus far.
