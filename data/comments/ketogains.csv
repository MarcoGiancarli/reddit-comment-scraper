ketogains,3e38px,DannySteel,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"Hi, could you post what your meals would be on an average day? and at what times of the day you work out along with any pre/post workout supplements.  I'm trying to build the perfect nutrient schedule, but a lot of the literature is based upon a high carb diet."
ketogains,3e38px,VC96,6,Tue Jul 21 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"For meals, I usually eat 2-3 per day depending on what they are. I also loosely follow an IF protocol where I try to keep my meal window around 8-9 hours. An average day would be something like:  Breakfast: 4 fried eggs, 5 pieces of bacon  Lunch: Chicken melt (canned chicken breast, cheddar cheese, maybe some bacon)  Dinner: NY steak or ribeye, small salad  That's on the higher calorie side though. Usually ""lunch"" is more like a snack, like fried cheese and pepperoni, pork rinds with Cholula chili garlic (my favorite), or just some pecans and a Quest bar.   I work out 4x a week around 10:30/11:00am. I mix a tablespoon of MCT oil into my tea when I wake up, and as of a few days ago actually, I started taking 3g of beta alanine and 6g of citrulline malate about 20 minutes before my workout. Post workout, I take 5g of creatine mono, and a protein shake with one scoop of whey, a cup of almond milk, splash of heavy cream, 2 tablespoons of flax meal, a spoonful of almond butter, and usually a small splash of sugar free flavored syrup (lately it's been banana or maple). On these days, my shake is obviously my breakfast, as I lift fasted (other than the MCT oil).   Hopefully that helped!"

The other big problem I have with artificial sweeteners is that it's very difficult to control the consumption levels.  Just looking at that recipe again I could see that I could easily demolish 4 or 5 pieces in one sitting and that may well have contributed to poor ketone results having blown my carb budget and perhaps I'm blaming the stevia unnecessarily.   It's much harder to over consume eggs for example vs something sweet.

There are different rules for supplement labels and nutrition labels and all kinds of loop holes for both. I have a bag of pumpkin seeds that claims the carbs are entirely made of fiber. Obviously not true. My guess is that the experiment they used to create the measure of a calorie only tested carbs, protein, and fat. Since they don't have the information on calories in amino acids, they can legally not count it. As far as I know, the leucine in BCAAs will have a potent effect on insulin.

A lot of people use preworkout or generally caffeine to get them stimulated, which I have quit as of 4 weeks ago. Not gonna lie, it is difficult. It tires me out before my other lifts, meaning they don't progress as well. I also cycle 4 miles to and from work every day in a windy, hilly city, and the constant leg workouts meant my legs were always knackered.  2) I would get serious depression / anxiety 2-3 hours after a big gym session no matter what I ate or didn't eat.  3) ICF workouts take a ridiculously long time  Especially while trying to cut body fat, I basically can't handle the volume.

ketogains,3e2fo0,the_straylight_run,2,Tue Jul 21 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"You have already been pretty successful, but continuing from this point, the general recommendation would be:  24/M/6'1"" | CW 184 | 17% BF | Mostly sedentary   1801 kcal Goal, a 20% deficit. (1416 min, 2251 max) 25g Carbohydrates 122g Protein (92g min, 152g max) 135g Fat (93g min, 184g max)   (With maybe only a 17% deficit if you are really hungry or active.) And then increase your protein by 25g-30g on your three weight lifting days.  This would equate to about 1850 calories per day over the week, while your current 1500/2500 diet results in 1930 calories with a lot of carbs.  I'd say to just revert to the standard recommendation and continue cutting until your next plateau, which might be at about 175 lbs, and then you might need to decide to move into a bulk cycle.  The 1500/2500 diet is probably good for leptin, but it is also a type of recomp diet, and they can be very slow and frustrating as you have discovered."
ketogains,3e2fo0,bidnow,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:25 2015 UTC,"He was already eating less than this 4 days a week, while lifting.   His cheat days were only 250 calories / day more than the max at his current weight, without adding any aggregate weight gain."
ketogains,3e2fo0,the_straylight_run,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed - He had reached a maintenance level diet with higher carb intake than required.  So now move back to SKD with less calorie variability and added protein/calories on lifting days.  I think that we pretty much agree, but I may be suggesting a lower calorie target knowing that most people underestimate their own BF%, overestimate their activity level, and underestimate their calorie intake."
ketogains,3e2fo0,bidnow,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think your latter is the true one.   We put people onto 'sedentary' for diet composition purposes because of the reasons you list. But with 3-4 lifting sessions per week, and even a normal amount of activity, sedentary likely doesn't fit.   Lightly active with a lifting session puts, using the latest calc for this sub, him at 2909 kCal / day TDEE. 1500 kCal is half that. So in 4 days, he's eating 4500-6000 kCal under maintance, while adding 0 extra on his cheat days.  By all accounts realistically he should be losing 1-1.5 lbs / week on this diet.   But that's assuming his BMR hasn't compensated for the reduced calorie numbers and dropped to meet the number of calories he is ingesting. So from that he gets no gains, nor added fat loss.  Personally, I think if he's actually eating as indicated, he's past the point of usefulness in cutting--or that in doing so he'll get diminishing returns. He could add 500 calories and still be 900 under on lift days, and 600 under on non-lift days. That would be better metabolically than cutting further to 1800.   On a regular SKD, I'd aim for 1 lb weightloss / week. Any more and one is likely to see BMR compensation and diminishing returns from cutting.   Oh and a huge urge to cheat.   That's what happened to me."
ketogains,3e2fo0,bidnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"I think that most of this thread is much ado about nothing.  OP estimated that he was 17% BF, and at that height and weight, I expected a much more skinny-fat physique than his posted picture.  Darth said to use 15% BF, but he looks closer to 13%-14% to me.  Probably the better question for OP to be asking is if it is time to move to bulking or continue cutting.  Darth's comment to just eat at maintenance suggests to me that he thinks that OP is ""thin enough"" and should focus on adding muscle mass instead."
ketogains,3e2fo0,mandingoBBC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"My thoughts follow a similar path to his.  I don't see the benefit of added cutting, and I see diminishing returns in the gym from keeping cutting down so far, both in terms of effectiveness and QoL."

From what I've seen, OP is young enough and has exercised well enough to avoid that occurrence and may now be one of the ""lucky"" first time dieters who get to drop a lot of weight like it never happened.  Now the task of moving down to 8%-10% BF from 13%-15%-17% with probably no insulin resistance issues is somewhat of a different problem, and these opinions/suggestions vary wildly.  I hope he follows Darth's suggestion and continues to keep carbs low, because I think that most of us would agree that unwanted weight regain can happen very, very quickly if you lose control of your carb intake."

If you've been on 1500 for a while now, your BMR has compensated for the reduction in calories. You now get both low strength gains and low body fat loss because your body has created a new equilibrium to minimise the fat loss and to adjust to its level of work.   and doing a 3 days refeed from friday to sunday   I also suspect you are wasting your time doing this if you aren't also doing your lifts on the same days.

It's not bad and your abs can easily withstand the weight you were benching with. (i.e., if you're strong enough to bench 225 for your work set, your abs are likely more than strong enough to roll a 225lb bar over them).  If you're going for a PR, just ask someone in the gym to spot.  I've never been denied a spot if I asked...  Go for it.  I almost always work alone.  Also, just about any strength training in general is good for fat loss, so long as your diet is in order."
ketogains,3dza59,Arete73,4,Mon Jul 20 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"I lift 5X5 when I did my Keto cut. You can do alot of the exercises solo and with out injury.  The Compund lifts are great and for something like Bench then I might use dumbells if I dont have someone to spot.  After being a newbie myself and just""pushing weight"" there is a huge difference between going through the motion and constricting the muscle.  The main thing being Keto and starting lifting I found was since I did not eat enough protein(ate around .6 gram LBM) i lost srength and muscle mass while losing the 30#.  Now reading more I think eating enough protein especially on lifting days (more like 1gram LBM) would help you gain or preserve muscle mass.  Take the time to have someone with good form show you the big movements(deadlifts, squats, shoulder press, bench) so you dont get hurt.  Your doing great if your here and in the mix.  Keep it up!"

ketogains,3dza59,Bierfreund,5,Tue Jul 21 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"You read too much into a lot of these things without just trying for a week or a month. Yes, diet > weights > cardio for sure. If you work your weights hard enough, you will not only burn the same or more calories, you will also concentrate your muscles.  It's not impossible to grow muscle on a deficit. Has a lot to do with how new you are. You will absolutely see some muscle development on a cut but it's more like muscles are growing that haven't ever grown before because of lack of usage AND concurrent weight loss that brings out the muscles slowly.  5x5 is fucking rough if done correctly and can be effective with good diet and cardio. I did it with my friend but we never wanted to push ourselves to the point of failure. We were close to spot each other but rarely have we ever needed to save each other (1x on bench press after 6 months). We want to lift heavy and good, not just heavy. My suggestion to you that a lot of new people never hear or ignore is to focus just on form, flexibility, and mobility until you execute the movements beautifully and comfortably. Spend 1-2 weeks using just the bar to learn how your body should move the barbell. You won't need a spotter for a while. I've seen people who just started try adding weights when their squat/bench is not even 25% deep or they round their lower back like fucking crazy on deadlift. Watch all the form videos non stop, absorb the knowledge, and try to emulate what you see. At the gym, take notice of people who do compound lifts or strength training. Watch how they do it or even ask them for some quick tips on form.  Progression of weight will come with time. Build a STRONG good foundation of excellent form and technique and it will seriously pay off."

I'm currently around 160 lbs, at probably 8 to 9% BF.  More protein = / = more muscle.  Please read and re-read our FAQ, in the protein chapter.  My advice: stay between 0.8 to 1.0g / lean lb."

ketogains,3dzcd0,Hibagon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:33 2015 UTC,What I found from testing was that eating to much protein at a sitting can knock you out of Keto.  One technique that you might think about is fasting in the morning and then when you do eat not overeating the protein in a single meal (like 20 grams) until the dinner meal where you can consume a majority of your calories.  I do believe if you dont get your LBM worth of protein you will loose muscle and have seen it personally through DEXA scans.

Check out the FAQ and wiki at /r/bodyweightfitness to get some ideas to round out your routine.   FYI you will never see great progression in the ""big"" lifts: squat, bench or deadlift without a barbell. Maybe consider a power rack, Olympic set of weights and a barbell as a ""goal"" investment once your Dumbbells get too easy!  Also random opinion: I think sit-ups/crunches are dumb...

Cook up the peppers, onions and beef with some taco seasoning (chili, cumin, cayenne, paprika, salt, pepper). I don't drain the beef for extra fatty goodness.   It's super easy to eat 600-800 calories of taco salad in a shot and never gets old. Filling the rest of your calories with shakes, BPC, etc., is much easier if you have a go-to meal.   Also good: mass cooking bacon, using it to dip in homemade guacamole as chips; all sorts of salame, wrapped around or with chunks of cheese (1 cheese stick and 5 slices is about 200 caps with perfect macros). Anything can be made better with a fried egg on top (pan fried brown butter ribeye with fried egg on top with a side of broccolini covered in a heavy cream cheddar cheese sauce weighs in at 1200 calories and is amazing).   tl;dr: get 5-6 go-to meals and snacks and eat like you've gone to heaven.

I eat nuts, string cheese, smoked fish, pork rhinds, or even scoops of coconut oil for snacks. A lot of people just eat a ton of meat when they start keto because they have a poor diet to start with and can't bring themselves to eat a proper amount of veggies without failing. If you already have a healthy diet and good discipline, keto will just be the transition from complex carbs and starches to fatty foods and veggies. Your protein probably won't change much.

ketogains,3dqi7z,rickamore,5,Sat Jul 18 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"I would argue against dismissing soma types entirely.  I definitely agree that we shouldn't lump people into those 3 groups as if people are 100% their soma type, but I like to use the terms for fast reference.  It's easier than sitting down and explaining to people genetic predispositions toward NEAT reactions to certain calorie types, exercise, and other genetic X factors and their effects on various metabolic functions.  As for bulking with keto, I probably could, but I enjoy a more carb-oriented and excess protein approach to building weight.  More enjoyable for me.  I'm also a believer in regular switch-ups for metabolic states for health.  That's mostly inference and anecdotal on my part."

If you still have more fat to lose then you shouldn't consider bulking or a TKD. If your goal is to just get strong, perhaps.  It seems like if you get your calories up to a stainable amount (1500 is way too low) you can perform in the gym better. Stick to SKD, but just eat the necessary calories to make strength progress. Stick to lifting heavy and you will get stronger. Your pounds didn't come off overnight, neither with strength gains, you already know consistency is key."

I'm on day 3 of eating 2300 calories and 180g of protein, still finding it difficult to eat that much.  Ate a dozen eggs today, among other things.    As far as TKD, I felt a little hypoglycemic today after the dextrose yesterday so I don't think I'll be doing that until my muscles grow and can handle the amount of weight required for it.

ketogains,3dpt9d,darkbyrd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:12:03 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble with even getting that much protein tbh. I take Vyvanse and it makes me not have an appetite so I sub breakfast and lunch with BPC and have a big dinner. If I eat chicken breast then it takes around 12 oz to get the 102g of protein I need which fills me up to the point of bursting almost. Maybe I should mix a protein powder with my BPC...

ketogains,3dotwn,Oni1jz,3,Sun Jul 19 00:09:14 2015 UTC,"Calorie management is a big part of it, but it's also about having your body run in a fasted state. While fasting, your body runs almost entirely on your stored fat, instead of the food in your stomach."

ketogains,3dotwn,Oni1jz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:03:01 2015 UTC,"After you eat something there is a period where insulin levels will rise. I can't remember the exact number but let's say about 6-8 hours. After that time period, your body is running on stored body fat for energy, and will continue to do so, until your next meal.   When you eat multiple meals a day, you never get out of the elevated insulin mode. When you IF, you are in the coveted ""fasted state"" for several hours of the day. Great for using up that stored body fat."

Darthluiggi knows what he is talking about and he is the one behind the ketogains calculator.   Basically it's a method of eating in a surplus on workout days and deficit on rest days.   Being that you workout 5-6 times per week I would only eat at a surplus on your 3 hardest days if you don't want to do a lean bulk but do more of a maintenance recomp!

ketogains,3dmhuu,Johnnie_Karate,5,Fri Jul 17 13:54:07 2015 UTC,Use the Keto Calculator at the top of the page.  FOr me a quick and easy reference for keto at a 65%fat/30% protein ratios is equal portions of fatgrams to protein grams.  I think you should eat a bit more protein to what ever the calcualtor says for you.  I myself went form 230 to 200# last time i was in keto and i did this in 5 weeks.  I purposely ate more fat like you are to stay at about 75% to 80 % fat intake.  What i found was that when i lost weight i still looked very similiar because i also lost muscle mass and not to much BF% overall.    Since you are lifting keep your protein at your 1gram to Lean body mass.  If you make fat the same youll be in the calorie range to loose weight calorie wise.  I am doing this myself to stay constant at around 65-70% to keep calories lower to see the effect so its a N1 for me as well but I do know i lost that much weight eating 3000 calories a day instead of the 2200 it tells me.  Good luck.
ketogains,3dmhuu,Arete73,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:32 2015 UTC,"Welcome to /r/ketogains!    First off, the ketogains calculator is your friend.  It will help you get your diet dialed in which is more important than anything else.  It can tell you what you should be eating to begin with, and then you evaluate your progress based on that.  If I guess you are 35% BF, at 205lbs, you have 133#LBM, and a TDEE of 2120kcal.  You will want to eat a respectable deficit (~20-25% at your BF), which brings us down to 1600-1700 calories.  You should lose around a pound a week this way, which is nice and sustainable.  your macros break down to 133g protein, 20g net carbs, and ~110-120g of fat.  Try this to start, or download the calculator and play around to see what you think.  As for lifting, did you create the program yourself?  Did you get it from somewhere?  What program is it?  If you created it yourself, I would recommend getting one that is ""proven"" effective and efficient (ie. SL5x5, ICF 5x5, Starting strength, the novice program from the ketogains calculator, plenty of options out there, all good choices).  This takes the uncertainty out of the equation because you KNOW what your doing is going to work if you stick with it.  saves you from wanting to maybe change things around, and definitely saves you from glaring muscle imbalances if your program is missing something.  Lastly, cardio... I don't do it personally because I find it easier to control my food intake to make sure my deficit is correct, than doing a bunch of HIIT and being starving and not sure how many calories to eat.  If you enjoy it though, have at it, but be careful of eating back calories as it can be easy to eat too much back and defeat the purpose (if your purpose is to burn fat).  Good luck!"

High trp low weight is good for endurance, but poor for muscle development/maintenance.

ketogains,3dmhuu,ctuck239,2,Fri Jul 17 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"IIFYM, then go for it, but two reasons come to mind right away for why you might want to reconsider a quest bar for breakfast.  They aren't cheap, first off, but if that's not an issue then whatever.  The other reason is that you are currently eating lunch and dinner, which is essentially IF, which is good for burning fat.  eating a quest bar for breakfast means you aren't intermittent fasting anymore, and you lose that benefit, so you would likely see better (how much better, who knows, but better) results wrt fat burning if you don't eat breakfast.  If you just need to add some protein, there are lots of good options.  When I need protein only I usually just eat a chicken breast that I have pre-cooked.  You could easily add this to your lunch and get where you want to be.    edit: clarity"

Not exactly. The body needs 20-30 g glucose a day which yes it makes from protein or glycerol or gets from carbs you eat. Keto is not a high protein diet, it's adequate protein and for same protein intake as other diets it's muscle sparing, eating more protein does not spare more muscle   that implies that BG levels will spike after meals since some of the protein is converted to sugar.

That is where set point is kinda ok if you think of it that way, but to say that someone's ""set point"" is anything over a normal BMI is completely bogus  It does get harder to lose weight when you get close to that essential BF% number, but that is because the body cannot lose weight as quickly when there is less of it available, so you just have to be patient, consistent and very strict. Exercising really helps, since adding on lean mass will up your BMR and allow you to burn more calories and usually get you more insulin sensitive which is great for fat burning and appetite control."
ketogains,3dnkhm,Steelblueback,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not trying to say having a lot of excess fat is OK. I'm talking about a natural leanness, e.g. if you can stay at 15%bf? My BMI is 27 and I'm around 13%bf, and it would require me to be at 10% to fall into the normal range. While a lot of skinny fat people are considered normal.  I'm also OK with exercising and putting in effort. I can see the results. But isn't it just unneeded stress?"
ketogains,3dnkhm,Quatroux,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"Stress is important. Obviously, overtraining is bad but as long as you eat healthy and exercise moderately during a deficit, you shouldn't ""damage"" anything.  Hormones are the key here... As long as you eat a decent amount of dietary fat your hormones shouldn't be affected too much. I have PCOS and I believe my leptin/insulin was messed up for a while because I was more hungry than I needed to be. I switched my diet to a very specific pure protein breakfast (via whey shakes), zero carb lunch (fatty meats) and only have some carbs at dinner time. I now eat below my TDEE and I don't even get cravings that much anymore - I found what worked for me!   I am assuming you don't have any hormonal issues but some people can increase their leptin/insulin sensitivity with consistent exercise, diet and meal timings (like IF or my particular protocol as examples). Once I get rid of my belly fat I am confident in being able to maintain my lower weight and BF% without much issue now that I know what works for me."

Set a 20% deficit, do a caloric refeed every 2-3 weeks (one day at or slightly above maintenance), you may throw IF in there if you're up for it. It shouldn't take you too long to get there if you're serious about it.  At this point you may want to toss the LISS, bump HIIT to 3 times a week. It sounds like you're doing something similar to PHAT which should work fine to cut with. If you say you're bored with your program I'm not sure what you'd rather do, if you're looking to cut down you can always switch to 3 days of all heavy such as SL 5x5 + accessories.

ketogains,3dj410,aaronnii,2,Fri Jul 17 01:37:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would say eat more.  You're at a fair sized deficit, and if you've been cutting for a while a diet break could do you some good.  I used to cut hard, but realized that I actually lost weight faster when I ate a more reasonable deficit.  Based on what I typed into the macrocalculator for you, you can eat 1400kcal a day, every day, and theoretically drop 1 lb per week.  100p/20c/100f will get you around there.  this also gives you around 1g protein per pound LBM, which you said you wanted.  When cutting, leaning to the heavier side of the protein range is not necessarily a bad idea, but you can drop that if you want and see how you feel."
ketogains,3dj410,aaronnii,-5,Thu Jul 16 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"reverse dieting? seriously.. Also at your current weight you should be eating about double your current protein (1lb per lb/bw)..

Alternate that two times a week with the high rep weights and short rest, as similar to PHAT."

ketogains,3diypd,capkato,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:03 2015 UTC,I believe chicken breast is going to give you the highest protein to lowest amount of calorie ratio.  Of course you are going to get some fat calories with chicken too.  The amount differs depending on the source you choose to use.  You can probably hit even the high end of your protein macro and be at about 850 - 1000 total calories with chicken breast.  That will give you flexibility to fill in the rest of your calories with other foods.
ketogains,3diypd,capkato,2,Thu Jul 16 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"Shrimp actually has one of the highest protein to calorie ratios, getting as low as 4 to 1 depending on how it's prepared. This is followed closely by halibut, salmon and tuna (depending on how lean the cut is) and then chicken, which is between 5 and 6 to 1. All of these will easily get you to a 12 to 1 ratio along with your fats, carbs and such.  Protein powders and bars rarely even hit your 12 to 1 ratio by themselves and are wildly less efficient than good lean animal protein."

I know it's always overstated everywhere but this can make a hue impact on your thoroughput at the gym.

ketogains,3ddi4p,darthluiggi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:54:14 2015 UTC,I think calories and macros are good (see EDIT above) and I suspect rest is the issue.  I've been blaming electrolytes but I'm not sure if they are a problem (though I was way under-ingesting potassium until a few weeks ago).
ketogains,3ddi4p,HotSeamenGG,2,Wed Jul 15 14:13:00 2015 UTC,"Are you working to failure for every workout? If you work to failure every workout, I can see why your body hasn't really had time to recover. If you work hard but not to failure, it'll allow your body to recover faster IMO. Personal opinion. I say this because the idea behind SL 5x5 is to lift below your max, but still obtain gains. Working to failure on SL 5x5 isn't recommended since you'll be too sore to make progress the next workout day (2 days later). Also recommended to de-load if you're feeling pooped."
ketogains,3ddi4p,HotSeamenGG,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:24 2015 UTC,"I do almost every set to failure. Soreness wasn't really a problem with 2-3 days between working the same muscle groups until the last few weeks, but perhaps recovery was never quite as good as I thought it was."
ketogains,3ddi4p,HotSeamenGG,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:14:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I mean working to failure has it's place, probably not every day though. Might be over training and then it caught up with you. Maybe just work just below max beginning of week, to failure near the end of the weak, so you have 2~3 days to fully recover. Cause I know when I work to failure, I'm sore for the next few days. It's a mild soreness, but it prevents me from putting 100% into it. Just my two cents."
ketogains,3ddi4p,eb11b,2,Wed Jul 15 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"The research I've read suggests that maximum hypertrophy comes from working to (or nearly to) failure, with more sets generally yielding more growth regardless of load/rep combination (so I tend to mix that up from week to week). BUT there's no doubt that's contingent on adequate rest, and maybe isn't compatible with 5 workouts per week."
ketogains,3ddi4p,eb11b,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm not completely familiar with the research, so I wouldn't quote me but yeah you're probably right about that. Lifting to failure than having adequate rest. Could just tone down on some days and see how it affects your overall gains in a 2~4 week time frame."

Tire flips, sledge hammer to tires and some running. If you feel like you need to rest or take a day off do it but dont let your resting heart rate dictate what you should do. You can also test your grip strength for signs of overtraining. Personally when I feel tired or overtrained I still make it into the gym and do light sets.

If you eat real foods you can get pretty close to that daily with out so much whey protein.  Also Since Whey is so bioavailable a 30gram portion will also knock you out of ketosis.  Maybe keep it at about 20 grams.  Just with the chicken breasts and keto friendly dinner you are hitting 100grams+ the eggs.

By lowering your protein you can increase your fat, which will give you more energy and strength for your workouts. If you think you are losing strength from not enough protein starting keto, then this is just the adaption process to keto. Also fiber is not necessary, in fact I have found that eating more fat and lowering my fiber intake has been better for my bowel movements."

Eating 2 meals a day is OK (I do IF without issues) - what matters more is total calories for the day. Waste on keto is less. So your visits to the WC are going to be less.

Think about it a cave man didnt have toilet paper so it wasnt about wiping so much and I find that to be the case with less fiber and regular every day.

ketogains,3dda4w,HotSeamenGG,2,Wed Jul 15 13:14:16 2015 UTC,"Check the TKD protocol if have you been on keto for 6-8 weeks. And if you need carbs for the burst energy, eat some kinda glucose, but avoid fructose 15~30 minutes before the match, but just make sure it fits your macros. Glucose refills your muscles glycogen, fructose does not and will most likely kick you out of ketosis and you'll be in some crappy limbo of fat/carb burning. Also try MCT oil or coconut oil pre-match about 15~30 minutes w/ hot coffee prior to a match BEFORE you decide to resort to using carbs. You might be undertrained or you might not be fat adapted. People on keto do typically have slightly harder time for activities w/ high intensity, like sprints. However, since it's soccer... it's mainly endurance except for the occasional sprint. TKD would prob work if you're fat adapted. Also are you on a cut? If you're cutting too much you could feel weak. Could try eating maintenance calories or a little more prior to the match."

There is no requirement anywhere that one not experience ketonuria.  Imagine that your ketones ramp up to 5 mmol/L. At some point the ketone levels will overload your acidic buffering and insulin will be released to keep everything in check.  It's entirely possible that you are simply creating too many for your body to use.  It doesn't matter, regardless. Literally no reason to care other than curiosity.  EDIT: Stop using ketostix.

ketogains,3d7tft,DownhillYardSale,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:48:46 2015 UTC,I misspelled it. What does that have to do with anything?
ketogains,3d7tft,DownhillYardSale,-2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:25 2015 UTC,"Indeed.   I haven't used ketostix for months. I'm talking about the smell.   What does that have to do with anything?  You stated you are having ketouria. You are claiming you are discussing the smell of your urine. Ketouria isn't a word. You don't ""have"" it because ""it"" ""doesn't exist.""  So basically this entire conversation turns into a convoluted attempt to understand what your point is because you don't appear to understand what you are saying.  I assumed you meant ketoNURIA, the only condition ending in URIA I am aware of related to ketones.  Apparently you weren't.  So what is ketouria???"
ketogains,3d46d6,billyjoebobnyc,10,Mon Jul 13 11:24:40 2015 UTC,"Tape measurements, calipers.  If your waist measurement is going down, or staying the same, and you are gaining weight, its usually good."
ketogains,3d46d6,darthluiggi,6,Mon Jul 13 13:32:25 2015 UTC,"Buy a pair of really tight, goalsize jeans. From thrift store if you lack confidence in your process ;) or cheap, tight underwear. I find that clothes are my truth serum !  Edit: Forgot to say, take pics of your love handle above the jeans for reference later. Sadly I didn't do this in January to prove my recomp. With clothes you instantly feel which way your body is trending. Skinny jeans never lie!"
ketogains,3d46d6,Foamrrroller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:48:42 2015 UTC,I will say that the problem with skinny jeans as a measurement tool is that when you are squatting your legs tend to blow up and make it hard to put the jeans on.  So it's hard to use that to gauge whether you are gaining muscle or fat.  I know that I hurt my knee and stopped squatting for a month and all of a sudden all my jeans starting fitting REALLY well.  I started squatting again and within a week they were tight again.
ketogains,3d46d6,RowdyRoddyPipeSmoker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, you're taking it too literally:) The idea is to have a clothing item that is too tight, especially in the lower waist, where many people have their most stubborn fat...or wherever it is for you. If jeans doesn't work for you, find something else. The point is to have a very tangible yardstick for the body's trending. I find that even measurements do not tell the whole story. My hips bones don't magically get narrower. Yet the muscles in bum have changed to the extent I can now fit into size xs in underwear, which is a new alltime low for me. Ty for your input anyway. Cheers."
ketogains,3d46d6,Foamrrroller,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:58:59 2015 UTC,No I get it I'm just saying that clothes also don't always tell the full story especially if you work out a lot.  Honestly the only thing I feel that TRULY tells the tale properly is a dexa scan.
ketogains,3d46d6,RowdyRoddyPipeSmoker,2,Tue Jul 14 23:03:15 2015 UTC,I never said clothes as yardstick is the whole picture. For those of us who can't afford or don't have access to numerous dexa scans... tight clothes are a very cheap and fast tool for TRENDING.
ketogains,3d46d6,Foamrrroller,5,Wed Jul 15 07:53:34 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to offer my experience and echo some of the other poster's comments.  I have been eternally frustrated when reading posts here by other keto-gainers that don't ever seem to mention any kind of a slowdown/stall in scale numbers when they are lifting.   I have hovered between 184 and 190 for the past month and a half or so after getting back to lifting around 197. The weight, which was likely mostly water, slipped off fairly quickly, but my scale hasn't made any really noticeable changes for 6+ weeks. That said, my girlfriend has noticed vast improvements in my physique. My chest is significantly larger and my man boobs look a lot closer to pecs. My shoulders, biceps, triceps and forearms are all significantly larger. My waist has trimmed down. My legs have significantly trimmed down. All of this has been w/ a deficit while eating 110g of protein.  So clearly there have been changes that aren't going to be reflected on the scale.  TL;DR: Tape measure if you need to see results once the scale stops responding how you're accustomed to."
ketogains,3d46d6,anamespeltwrong,2,Mon Jul 13 14:27:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your info. Out of curiosity, what kind of deficit did you maintain?"
ketogains,3d46d6,anamespeltwrong,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"Currently, I'm running a ~1000kcal deficit/day. My TDEE w/out exercise is between 1900-2100kcal or so. The rest is keto protocol - 10-20g of carbs, the rest is fat. I know I'll need to reassess protein in the nearish future.  900 kcal, 100-110g protein on non lifting days  1200 kcal, 110-130g protein on lifting days.  I lift 3 days a week - no meaningful cardio really.  This is not going to be sustainable for long. I can already tell (8 weeks or so in) that recovery is taking longer than I'd like. I'll probably add in ~100kcal per week till I get to something more sustainable while I continue to cut. I was in bad shape when this all started. I've still got a spare tire now, but if you only saw my upper body, you'd think I was solid.  Best of luck. Feel free to PM if you've got any other questions. We can figure this shit out together."
ketogains,3d46d6,quantumfox64,2,Mon Jul 13 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've been sitting between 187-189 now for a few weeks, perhaps more, and virtually no weight changes. It seems that people just fail to mention how prevalent weight stalls seem to be, while body composition continues to change."
ketogains,3d46d6,anamespeltwrong,0,Mon Jul 13 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"I would offer, that if you are not seeing the physique changes, to independently try 2 different approaches.  1) No count weekend/day - dont count your calories for a weekend/day. Come back on Monday and carry on. Some times you may have to remind the body that everything is okay.  2) Drop your calories to increase deficit. I have been using a 40-45% deficit and seeing results, but I've also seen the recovery issues with my approach. If you're doing a 20% deficit increase it by 5% for a week. Maybe 10%. See if the scale or physique seem to pick up.  Remember - one or the other. Not necessarily both. Just take a scientific approach of only changing one thing at a time and allow it to play out. If no changes, revert, give time to establish a base, and make a different change to test with.  FWIW - I also intermittently fast. More out of convenience than necessity. I feel like it gives me consistent weigh-in points. And hunger is not an issue for me."

ketogains,3d46d6,anamespeltwrong,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:47:10 2015 UTC,I hear ya! It's just frustrating because our expectations all along were based on continued progress on the scale. We just didn't know what we didn't know. Best of luck to you! I hope the progress keeps up.
ketogains,3d46d6,Stinkynugs,2,Tue Jul 14 13:17:47 2015 UTC,"I still use my scale, its the only way I can really make sure I am not losing weight to fast. Especially important for me right now As I am nearing 10% body fat. Although I only really take my weight in seriously every 2 weeks or so."
ketogains,3d46d6,Stinkynugs,2,Mon Jul 13 12:27:36 2015 UTC,But how do you reconcile your weight and account for muscle gains?
ketogains,3d46d6,AZ_Steve,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:41:09 2015 UTC,"Just kind of try and keep track of your body fat percentage as much as you can, its not 100% accurate but there is not real other way of doing so. Also if your cutting weight your muscle gains are going to be negligible unless you are still having ""noob gains""."
ketogains,3d46d6,hornwort,2,Mon Jul 13 12:52:09 2015 UTC,"I should have mentioned that...I'm pretty sure I'm benefiting from a period of noob body recomp.  Never really worked out before, so I'm trying to exploit this period for the holy grail of fat loss/muscle gain.  That's why I'm having such a hard time tracking my continued progress..."
ketogains,3d46d6,RowdyRoddyPipeSmoker,2,Mon Jul 13 12:57:10 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the slow down on the scale doesn't happen until you reach a certain level of leanness.  For example I hope that I can build about 1/2 a pound of muscle a month, but was losing at least a pound of fat per week (in the beginning)  You just can't build the muscles as fast as you can trim the fat.  Then if you are getting to a point where you are lean and you do build a pound of muscle and lose a little fat then the scale isn't moving.  Combine that with fluctuations in water retention, food volume, waste, etc. It is real tough to count on the scale to provide much meaningful information.  I tend to weigh myself often, but only to reinforce what I expect it to say.  Once for shits and giggles I weighed myself before and after  a workout.  I had lost 4 pounds in 33 minutes.  Certainly that was 98% sweat.  Put things into perspective though about how much water I need to drink to keep hydrated."
ketogains,3d46d6,Modotti,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"I've used a scale exactly once in the 2 years I've been on keto -- when I went for a physical, about 1 year in. Was happy to see I'd lost 60lbs despite having increased my lifts dramatically (DL from 180 to 295 at that time) -- but not nearly so inspiring as when I started wearing medium shirts."

Go get one done every 3 months or so (more if you have the time and money) and you'll see your TRUE progress both in muscle and fat.    I have withings scale that does body fat % and connects to wifi to record all your stats and I just get on it every morning at the same time.  I don't really care about the BF% being accurate just that the graph over time shows that it's going down, that's all that really matters.  Get something like that and at least you can easily track those numbers using one source that will automatically graph everything for you.  Also if your lifts are going up and you think you look good and feel good that's all that matters really."
ketogains,3d46d6,vexorg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"One great way to determine body composition if you don't trust measuring tapes is a bod pod - google it for location near you.  The place near me is like 75 bucks for one, and some lesser amount to get 2 or 3 of them - you can go in and put on a suit that covers your body and it very accurately measures your lean body mass and bf% - do this every couple months or something while you are working out and you'll see your bf% drop and lean mass go up showing that it is working.  This is especially good for those people who are already under 15% BF which is probably where it becomes even harder to know the difference - good for people who really like their #'s.  You could also focus not on the body itself but on increases in the gym, how much more can you lift or how many more reps are you able to do, etc."

Also, http://examine.com/faq/can-eating-too-much-protein-be-bad-for-you   Don't worry about it if you have healthy kidneys and control your protein intake if you have damaged kidneys. It may be prudent to gradually increase protein intake to higher levels rather than jumping in both feet at a time, but there isn't much on this topic.  In healthy persons and rats, there is no evidence to suggest a relatively normal style of protein intake is harmful to the liver when habitually consumed as part of the diet. There is some preliminary evidence, however, that very high protein refeeding after prolonged fasting (>48 hours) may cause acute injuries to the liver."

Why not just eat a normal amount then, and skip the worry?  So unless you are prepared to take the stance of singing the praises of high-protein diets being awesome and more people should partake in them... I fail to see why you are arguing with me."

Depends on type of protein, and what else you eat at the time.  Also, +300g protein, in relation to what body weight?  Context is very important, and your question is very general.  There is really no use in going over 1.2g protein per lean pound you weight - unless you are doing a PSMF.  Going ovet 1.2g requires a lot of food, which most people will find hard to consume, and then you start to relly more on whey shakes and also, probably experience protein farts, which very often means your body is not primed or used to that much protein (does not mean that it will not be used, though)."

I am beginning to be of the opinion that a protein intake that is optimal for being lean and healthy is not likely to simultaneously be optimal for building muscle mass and strength.

On a cut, especially any major cut, you will lose #'s off your lifts but this doesn't mean you've lost strength. As your weight goes down, you will not be able to lift the same weights just because the mass to support it isn't there. Your lifts compared to body weight may stay similar.  If you drop 30 lbs in weight while lifting 2x bodyweight you'll lose 60lbs off your lift while keeping similar levels of strength.   Edit.

Then, once you have done that for a while you can consider doing a more specialized workout once you know what you want.   Whatever you decide, try and focus on getting in one horizontal, vertical push and pull movement (so bench, row, press and pull-up or any variation of those) and please consider adding squats and deadlifts. The reasoning behind doing these 6 particular movements is that it ensures your body is well-rounded and less likely to get injured or get muscle imbalances. They also will synergize with whatever other exercises you decide to add to mean you will improve much more consistently."

In my case, a large volume of cardio (a half marathon every weekend plus short fast runs 2-3x a week) combined with lifting resulted in significant muscle loss and only very moderate fat loss (measured via DEXA scans). Had I not stopped, I would have been in skinny fat territory by now.   In my view, prolonged cardio (not HIIT) just sends the wrong message to your body: dispose of unnecessary weight but hold on to your fat reserves to fuel these long sessions."

ketogains,3d0q2s,rburgundy69,5,Sun Jul 12 17:38:39 2015 UTC,The only reason I don't think it is a waste is because I question the cardio fitness of weightlifters for things like cycling.  It's a personal preference but I keep doing cardio so my CV fitness improves while I lose weight.
ketogains,3d0q2s,charliemike,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"You can do high intensity weight lifting which has cardio benefits. I do a kettle bell routine (with almost no rest) that nearly kills me and I'm no slouch in the cardio area.  This way you get strength and cardio benefits all in one.   Doing cardio without weight lifting while cutting leads to being skinny fat.    When it comes to cardio my personal rule after much trial and error is ""not at the gym"".  I find gym based cardio caused me more injuries, and took to much time and left me skinny fat.  I do cardio stuff as part of regular life. For example I ride my bicycle to work 10 miles each way, 2-3 times a week.  That way I get cardio benefits without the wasted time in the gym."

ketogains,3d0q2s,charliemike,8,Sun Jul 12 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"Cardio is mostly a waste of time.   Cardio allows you to eat like a human so you can continue to squeeze in some extra protein.   Cardio keeps your heart in shape and improves stamina.  Cardio is not a fucking waste of time.   Lifters who say this shit annoy the ever living fuck out of me. Look, if you don't want to do it, fine. But cardio is important. Your heart is the most important muscle in your body. You're not going to magically waste away if you run a couple miles every couple of days. Of course you're going to lose a bit of mass.. expect that. It's going to happen with or without cardio during a cut. Why not make the cut as short as possible and do a clean rebulk afterwards?   All that strength means jack shit if you can't do shit with it for longer than a few bursty seconds at a time.  I'm not saying I'd advocate going out and marathon train.. but abandoning it altogether during a cut? Who the fuck does that?   ""Cardio is bad for a cut"" is copout logic. Plain and simple."
ketogains,3d0q2s,PaperStreetSoapQuote,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"As I state in another comment below, it's not that cardio is bad for you. It's just that cardio alone is a waste of time.  You can do a high intensity weight lifting routine with minimal rest between sets and get the same results as slogging away on a treadmill for an hour.  As I also say working cardio into your day to day life is great; ride your bike to work, take the stairs, etc etc.     Personally I have a limited time I can spend in the gym per day.  The benefits of plain cardio are massively outweighed (no pun intended) by weight lifting."
ketogains,3d0q2s,rburgundy69,2,Mon Jul 13 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"cardio alone is a waste of time.   I'm still not feeling it. Sorry man..   I can understand that time is an issue for you. And I've honestly gone through periods where I've told myself that I can just up the intensity and minimize downtime in the weight room. And actually even with cardio, I still do a combination of both (while cutting).  I guess maybe a caveat to the cardio addition would be necessary if you generally don't live a sedentary lifestyle. I have a desk job where riding my bike to work really wouldn't be an option. The only real cardio I would get is every 4 days when I mowed my lawn, and that's obviously not going to cut it (pun intended).  Cardio is important (at least as part of my own routine) because if I try to go too hard on my body to make up for a lack of cardio, I'll end up with crazy joint issues which tend to fuck me me up far worse than a few well placed runs during the week. I find that this way, I can avoid the usual repetitive use injuries associated with beating the shit out of my body on the weights with an over the top intensity on a deficit.  The only days I usually forego extra cardio are DL days because a good deadlift day will leave me completely drained.   I usually set one day aside for HITT cardio and fill in the rest for very modestly paced runs. I usually even slip something in on rest days, depending on my energy levels.  I've tried it the other way and have attempted to omit cardio from my routine and I personally see the best results when I force myself to include it. There are just too many benefits for me to ignore."

ketogains,3d2qbz,Doc_Haus,2,Mon Jul 13 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know your stats but suspect that your caloric deficit may have been too large to maintain the level of physical exercise. The fact that your performance was tanking indicates that, and looking for food (including other than keto) suggests that you were hungry, which would have also lead to your deteriorating mood.  I would recommend reviewing your TDEE and setting a realistic deficit (10-20%) which will slow down your fat loss but which will also make it easier to maintain in the long run."

ketogains,3d1j6l,Connor1021,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, start off with sedentary unless you are on your feet all day (and by that I mean minimum 6h/day), then do lightly active.   Check out the ketogains Excel spreadsheet, or use any type of exercise calorie calculator for your cardio and weightlifting, like this one  If you want a daily amount, add up all your activity for the week and divide by 7 to add to your TDEE, or vary it if you prefer eating more certain days.   Once you have that number, subtract 30% or whichever percentage you choose.  Also, easy and more accurate but long way to do it: count calories for a FULL MONTH and track exercise, and weigh yourself consistently. At the end of the month, do all the maths and you should know that how much you lost / gained will equal how much under / over your TDEE was, so you can extrapolate from there to know what works for you."

ketogains,3d0ji5,heavystrong,2,Sun Jul 12 14:14:12 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, fiber does not count towards net carbs, so nuts and stuff like that are okay. Sugar alcohols can be tricky though. Some people can actually be knocked out of ketosis from them I've heard, but they're processed differently so they wouldn't count towards net carbs either. It's still not a great idea to go overboard with them though. Plus they can cause some pretty bad gas/diarrhea if too much is eaten at once, so that's no fun. If someone else has something to change/add please do so because this is just my understanding from what I've read. I don't want to give you the wrong info."
ketogains,3d0ji5,Lanigangam_style,0,Sun Jul 12 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"ha!  nevermind, i finally found my answers.  it probably only would have happened if i got the guts up to finally post to reddit.  here is the answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq  What about sugar alcohols?  It's important to note that there are lots of different types of sugar alcohols. Some of these are compatible with a low carb approach, some of them should be avoided due to high glycemic index or may have nasty side effects such as constipation, laxative effects, bloating, flatulence, indigestion and heart burn.  An individual's ability to digest certain sugar alcohols can depend the gut enzymes of each person and the manner in which the sweeteners are consumed.  It is important to note that even if a granulated sweetener uses a sweetener with a GI of 0, it may be bulked out with another sugar alcohol such as Maltitol with a high GI.  If you are have a sensitive gut or can't kick a plateau, ditch sugar alcohols.  What are NET carbs and how to I calculate them?  The NET carbs for a food are TOTAL CARBS - FIBER. Example: 100g of avocado contains 9g carbs. 7g of these are from insoluble fiber and don't elicit a strong insulin response; you don't count them. 9g - 7g = 2g NET carbs per 100g avocado."

ketogains,3cqi0g,Darkbl00m,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:21:57 2015 UTC,"My thought process was that burning around 1500 calories a day would easily burn through the 50g of carbs and then some, keeping me in keto."
ketogains,3cqi0g,Darkbl00m,2,Fri Jul 10 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"You should be (more or less) fine with 50g of carbohydrates but the ""then some"" part could knock you out of ketosis. If you are adding carbs for additional energy, consider swapping them out with more fats. There is nothing essential about carbs.  How long have you been following a KD? If only for few weeks, you are probably not fat adapted yet, and higher carb intake might be keeping you in limbo land which is worst of both worlds.    Depending on your stats, though, I suspect that a 1500cal intake is likely too low for the level of physical exertion you describe. The  ""lethargy"" you mention in another response is a reasonably good indicator for running out of energy.  TL;DR: Check your TDEE and, if necessary, up your intake; reduce carbs to <20g/d and, if applicable, wait for fat adaptation to happen."

Spine scrapes = not tightening your lats.  focus on rotating your elbows down and then back, with an open palm grip on the bar. you MUST maintain the tightness of your lats and shoulders all the way through the motion - you will notice that your upper back will feel much more tired after a workout doing this properly."

Can we build much muscle on a keto diet ? if we couldn't our ancestors who ate this way would of withered away and died so its a safe bet we can do just fine."

On a SAD diet in the past I would cut back on foods/eat more efficiently and work my ass off, mostly getting fitter with some drop in weight but this requires a different approach one im still getting use to.  I think at-least for the time being getting to 15% bf would be where my original goal was and still over all is hence the deficit but as a secondary id like to be able to either fit in some variation of sports if I can. If its just advised that maintenance or re comp eating is best to sustain that activity level then ill happily do that."
ketogains,3cnr4b,ctuck239,2,Thu Jul 9 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"I interpret that as #1 goal is fat loss, #2 goal is variety in activities.    Your best bet then is to eat at a small deficit and do what makes you happy.  If you start to feel overtrained, or just tired, eat a little more.  Do the typical stuff to reduce your chances of burning out (water, electrolytes, sleep, etc.), but if you are simply not taking in enough calories to fuel your body to do all the activities you want to do, then you have to eat more as the exercise is probably increasing your deficit too high.  If you are quite active every day, I would suggest just doing a VERY small deficit off your TDEE, like even just 200 calories or so, and let your exercise do the rest.  Track your weight/measurements/pics, whatever you use to track progress, and in a couple weeks if you don't like the rate of loss, cut calories more.  If you are too tired to do your activites, eat 100 more calories a day.  Repeat every couple weeks.  IME (lifting 3x a week, playing hockey 2-3x a week, and softball 1x/wk), the smaller the deficit, the happier/healthier I am.  That makes it easier to keep up the pace.    Good luck!"

I mean I hate to say it but like you said I just have to track even more but concentrate on the primary goal first and take it as it comes on the secondary.

That's the best combinaison possible. You are gonna put on serious muscle mass.  Go with a 500kcal surplus maximum, if you gain too much fat, go with 250kcal surplus. (measure your waist/hips every week to see what happened).  Don't lose your time doing biceps curls and other isolation movements. Go with the big lifts (Squat, Deadlift, Dips, Pull Up, Overhead Press, Bench Press). Learn how to do these movements properly, that's crucial.  3 times a week full body workout will be good.

Once I balanced my macros and tracked then. That all went away.   Also try the juice of 1 lemon in 16 oz of water. That seemed to help a little

Not true.  You make it sound like eating carbs continually adds water weight.  In my experience, going low carb usually sees me drop 2-3kg in a week.  Eating carbs sees me gain 2-3kg back and then my weight stays constant  Keto isn't going to add more muscle than a carb based diet, in fact, the anecdotal evidence and opinion of most body transformation experts is that lack of carbs might actually hinder muscle growth  See http://m.imgur.com/Fi6O9Pu for more details.  And anyone doubting this should probably check out Phil's credentials first  If your stats are accurate, I would use Keto for 2-3 weeks and make a strict effort to lose weight.  As you get leaner I would start carb cycling which is a form of tkd.  Carbs in one post workout meal only."
ketogains,3cn3fb,BrandonUCSC,3,Thu Jul 9 04:44:35 2015 UTC,"While you cut you should lift heavy to preserve muscle mass, worry about building it after. You're NOT wasting your time lifting heavy while cutting.  Maximizing fat loss is almost entirely going to be done by reigning in your diet."
ketogains,3cn3fb,rickamore,2,Thu Jul 9 05:16:13 2015 UTC,"My understanding, for what it's worth, is that full body routines 3x/wk are better when cutting.  This is supposedly because hitting all your muscles 3x a week reduces the risk of muscle loss at a deficit (where your risk increases) because the muscles are being used more frequently, so the body knows that they are important and doesn't want to ""eat"" them.    Again, just my understanding, I could definitely be incorrect.  I've been on full body routines for the last 10-11 months since I've been cutting this whole time, but I started out a noob.  I can also tell you that I spent 4 months on a pretty decent deficit, 3x/wk full body, and didn't lose an ounce of muscle.  Actually lost 21lbs of fat    and gained 0.2 lbs of LBM.  Anecdotal, but still... I'm happy.  EDIT: just re-read your post and realized I didn't answer your question.  The answer is no, the type of program you choose will not have much effect on your fat loss, your diet is MUCH more important.  The program you choose WILL have an impact on how much muscle loss you have though, which I am guessing is just as important to you."

ketogains,3cjpak,theGIRTHQUAKE,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:31 2015 UTC,"Best (expensive + requires space): Get a power-cage, a bench, a olympic-size barbell, some olympic-size weights (4x45lbs and down to 2x1lbs). With that you can perform the basic lifts to build strength and develop your physique.  The doorframe pull-up rack is also a good suggestion. A set of looped bands can give you support for pullups and work as resistance for other exercises.  Besides that a cheap and thin yoga mat won't hurt to have. Good for stretching, warm-ups and floor exercises.  All in all check out body-weight exercises. You can do a lot with them, no need for weights.  If the barbell solution is too expensive or takes up too much room, you could also look into kettlebell training. They are more sturdy than dumbbells and you can perform more dynamic exercises with them (swings, squats etc.) without the fear of them falling apart.  You should absolutely check craigslist, ebay and alike for the weights, racks and bench. No need to buy new gear."

ketogains,3cd9ra,satanismymaster,2,Tue Jul 7 04:05:46 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of both heat and cold therapy.   Have you ever heard of M.E.D.? Minimum effective dose is the minimum amount of stimulus required to induce a response. For example, water at 100C is boiling, 0 C is freezing.  In terms of biology, there are responses in the body that show when the MED has happened for any given activity. When tanning, your skin turns red when a melatonin response has been induced.   In the same regard, with cold therapy, when your skin gets cold enough to induce a response, it turns red. This means you've hit the point where your body starts producing hormones and impacting the CNS in response to the cold.   For heat stress, I think it might be red skin too but this one is a little bit more linear. I'd say sweating is a better determinant of heat stress and the response involved, assuming the sweat isn't exercise or humidity induced, which is why dry infrared sauna provides the best results in studies.   Basically your method is not enough stimulus to induce the response you're expecting."
ketogains,3cd9ra,Naonin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"Those type of showers are great for blood circulation, but you can't just drink instead, blood circulation to the organs is not the same.  If you're looking to cut calories just start counting them, or cut down on fat a little and up your lean protein."
ketogains,3cd9ra,Solieus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:34:02 2015 UTC,There is no need to alternate hot and cold when drinking water. In showering the hot water is to bring blood back to the surface of the skin so that the cold water cools the body more efficiently. When drinking cold water the body uses energy to bring it up to body temperature. Adding hot water just reduces the amount of energy required to bring the water temp up to body temp. You can actually calculate the amount of energy the body will need to expend bringing a x oz of water from 32 degrees to 98.2 degrees.

ketogains,3cb2c9,TimmyAgewood,3,Mon Jul 6 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't think I was going to write this much, but I need some support too so I put my thoughts down.  The TLDR is that DEXA scans do have assumptions built in.  Specifically regarding hydration level.  When I had my last DEXA scan I might have been dehydrated a little.  Look I wanted a good score.  It was an important scan for me.  I didn't know at the time that water weight is considered LBM.  So you might have a better % if you were also dehydrated a bit for your scan.  The doc scolded me a little because I had drank some coffee before my scan and he thought I would be dehydrated and it will affect the test.    I wish I could help you more with your specific situation.  I am also trying to figure out how to bulk properly.  I am finding it difficult to eat surplus calories.  Heck I am possibly still trying to figure out my maintenance calories.  For me once I lost all my weight and was pleased with how I looked I haven't been as consistent with logging my foods.  I'm still on point with keto foods.  I've still certainly been in ketosis except for a day here or there (typically holidays).  Side note - I've come to the mindset that if I can't have a piece of cake to celebrate with someone on their birthday then I am probably taking this too seriously.  I was insistent about not cheating when I was trying to lose weight, but now that I reached my goal I don't need to be such a prick about my foods when in a group setting.  Anyway I am finding the bulking process to be more difficult both psychologically and in practice.  Am I eating enough?  Is the weight gain on the scale muscle, fat, water, or poop?  Is an extra 200 calories enough?  What if my NEAT was higher today and 200 calories isn't enough?  Was my workout hard enough?  Did I burn too many calories and I need to eat more?  Did I recover adequately from last time?  Is my program right?  Even if I did track my food today did I really eat at an excess?  (All logs are estimating calories.)  I found it easier to cut once I understood SKD.  All I had to think about was are my macros close and am I under calories.  It didn't really matter if my workout program was correct.  I was burning calories.  It didn't really matter if I wasn't exactly 500 calories under for the day as long as I was under.  500 calories was a big enough buffer that there was wiggle room.  200 calories to bulk is a much smaller window to work with.  As long as the scale was going down I assumed things were working as intended.  Yet if the scale is going up you really have no idea what is happening.  The difference is in the specificness of the goal.  At first I just wanted to lose weight.  I sort of expected to lose a little muscle, but I was so overweight (in my mind) that I didn't care.  Now I want to gain weight, but I want to specifically just gain muscle and in specific spots.  I know you have to expect some fat gain as well, but I'm still not sure if I am mentally ok with that.  It's been such a short of amount of time that I have been lean.  It's tough man."

I didn't know at the time that water weight is considered LBM.   To add to this, if he was taking creatine at the time of the first scan, and not at the time for the second there's posibility that the water stored in muscle during the first scan way not present in the second, further reducing lean mass."
ketogains,3cb2c9,rickamore,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:45 2015 UTC,I hope that's the case. Visually I think I've put on some lean bulk. I've gotten several comments this past month or two that I'm looking better. Disappointed but stubborn as a mule and will keep on picking up heavy things. Eventually after a couple of years when I have a stack of these DEXA scans graphed I hope that variation from hydration will be eliminated as noise from the data.
ketogains,3cb2c9,Foamrrroller,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:15:35 2015 UTC,"I think that it's sort of a slippery slope when doing SKD or any ketogenic diet. To do it right you need a level of attention to detail that borders on obsessive behavior. That's mainly why I can only do it strictly for a quarter at a time, maybe once a year. I'm healthy, I continue eating the same basic way and enjoying the benefits of no carbs (constant energy and the ability to work right through lunch if needed are what I notice), and like you I eat a slice of birthday cake with no guilt. Hell I did that even when on supposedly strict keto and it still worked. Don't let life get in the way.  I really tried to curb that obsessive aspect to SKD this quarter during my bulk attempt. I didn't track macros, I weighed myself weekly instead of daily, and I skipped caliper and measuring tape data for the whole quarter instead of weekly as during the cut. I'm open to the idea that my lack of strictness was to blame for my lack of bulking success if one of the gurus wants to make a case for that. Everything I've read says that for hypertrophy you need sufficient protein, enough sleep, be anabolic (caloric surplus) and provide sufficient physical stimulus through progressive overload. I stuck to those principles very well even if I didn't track macros. Sigh."
ketogains,3cb2c9,Foamrrroller,3,Mon Jul 6 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"and a allowed myself occasional craft beers (well maybe more than occasional).   Cut the beer.  What's your primary goal?

ketogains,3cb2c9,TheDisillusionist,2,Mon Jul 6 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"Oops, I skimmed your OP too fast :) Yup, dexa counts water weight as LBM, sooo there's the inconsistencies from your 2 scans...which means you can't really quantify the success/failure of your bulking. But if there is an increase in your measurements and you're certain you're picking consistent spots to measure... AND you can visibly see difference. There's an indication for you. This is why I usually recommend to take pics with too tight clothes. They often give a much more tangible yardstick of trending, IME.  If you have no problem with ""gaining"" 11 lbs of fat (but again the dexa might be inconsistent) ...then that's your choice :)  If you really weren't able to hypertrophy at all, then that would possibly be a matter of training protocols, less about diet... I would think. But there are much more knowledgeable people on this board regarding lifting than me! Good luck :) If you have doubts about keto and gaining, I think this video with Jacob Wilson with Dymatize and bodybuilding.com was very interesting. He talks about difference in results regarding keto vs standard lifting diet among other things. Increase in testosterone, muscle sparing qualities and keto being beneficiary for people who tend to have metabolic syndrome. Mind you, he is affiliated with the protein shake business and as such, take some of the opinions stated in this video with a healthy scepticism."
ketogains,3cb2c9,Bosona,3,Tue Jul 7 09:18:49 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents but some of that dexa shit and water issues could be part of it but the heart of the matter seems to be that you're not in a bulk at all. You're doing some kind of crazy hybrid bulk/cut You're in an extremely strenuous cut. 15-20 miles of hiking that you aren't accounting for in your burn and you upped your volume. Add to that you being a hard gainer.   You're a hiker that fucks around in the gym without a nutrition plan to support what you're doing and guess what? Your body is putting on muscle exactly where you're telling it you need it most (your legs) within the bounds of the material you're giving it (which seems super low).  Oh, and alcohol completely hijacks your metabolism into fat storage. So if you're doing that a lot there you go. Also cortisol from overtraining/undereating/underresting will jack up your anabolism and water balance completely and throw you off track.   Just my two cents, but your narrative has two glaringly huge holes in what you're tracking (sloppy diet and huge amount of cardio you aren't accounting for) that I would address before I relied on a highly nuanced explanation."
ketogains,3cb2c9,Bosona,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:07:48 2015 UTC,You're in an extremely strenuous cut.   You raise some good points: walking in the woods on the weekend might be killing some of my gains and even before posting there was no doubt that my sloppy diet caused me to gain more fat than needed for a bulk. The idea that I'm on a strenuous cut after gaining 11 lbs and going up in my lifts just doesn't compute though. I doubt eating more calories to get out of the supposed cut is the answer!
ketogains,3cb2c9,AZ_Steve,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"You say that but I personally have kickstarted new weight loss by bumping intake. Wouldn't last forever but it can happen IF you have a cortisol issue. It sounds to me (untrained opinion) that you do. Excess cortisol inspires belly far accumulation and screws with muscle gains.  It would be hard to say if you're not tracking everything, at least roughly and for a while. My gut tells me you're running a very slight deficit during the week and a massive deficit on the weekends. So what are you telling your body? 3-4 days out of 7 is leg workouts. Build legs if you can. Which it has done. Every week you're going into a massive deficit. Store up calories to get through that. Which it is doing with the abdominal fat.   Just something to think about."
ketogains,3caqn4,Russel_Hobbs,6,Mon Jul 6 13:03:55 2015 UTC,"That's delayed onset muscle soreness (also known as DOMS) and it's normal.

Light activity, epsom salt baths, and foam rolling seem to work well for me, but everyone is different."
ketogains,3caqn4,Hibagon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"1) That's a good soreness, embrace it. Make sure to stretch very well, it'll make most of the soreness go away and once you start lifting you'll get this great warming sensation.  2) Make sure to rotate your muscle groups. Don't work on the same group two days in a row. I swap between upper and lower body but core is every day, EVERY DAY.  3) Keep a log. It'll help you understand your growth, define straightforward goals, and show that you actually have progress.  I use a shorthand system to remember what my lifts are since I'm limited to machines at the moment. I work up to repping my max weight once by doing reps of 12-9-6-3-1. Once I can get 3 reps of my max weight, I move the bar up. This way, I only have to remember my max and I can count up in 5- or 10-lb increments.  I.e., if my chest press max is 200 my routine will look like this:  Reps - Weight  12 - 160lb  9 - 170lb  6 - 180lb  3 - 190lb  1 - 200lb  This is my personal system for easy mental management of my workout. I'm no fitness professional but I dropped 45 lbs. in 3 months on keto and have built another ~20-30% increase in lifting capacity after already being acclimated (football in high school). I'm currently on my final push to drop another 35 which will finally move me into a ""normal"" BMI."

ketogains,3cc8rf,darthluiggi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:24:11 2015 UTC,"Well...   I suppose you are using a Tanita / Bio impedance body scale.   These scales are somewhat innacurate, even more so wiht low carb diets, as water / glycogen / electrolyte changes do affect the readings.  This is why the usual approach here in ketogains is to focus on three things:   tape measurements+caliper readings+visual comparisions  Weight by itself is not the best way to track progress. Water retention, food bolus, etc can cause innacurate readings. One can have big differences in body weight at differnt times of the week, and even on the same day.  Now, in regards to your personal results, and even with what was said above:  Overall, the trend is very positive: you are gaining weight, but also muscle, and losing fat. So this is important.  Probably not gaining really 14 lbs of muslce in +3 months, but still, I'm sure some muscle has been gained, even more so if your lifts are progressing.  So yes, the trend is positive. Paired with tape measurements, I'm guess we can get a better picture.  Anyway, the idea is to keep on grinding and tweak along the way, as needed.  Cheers!"

ketogains,3c8cnp,flourjess,23,Sun Jul 5 21:17:37 2015 UTC,Everyone is different. Genetics play a bigger role than anything. My advice is to:   Give it time (up to 2 years) Drink lots of water Moisturize your skin Keep lifting to fill in the excess space   If that doesn't work then your genetics are the issue and you will need to get surgery if you want to change the appearance. Good luck.

Often people think they have excess skin when they really have a small layer of subcutaneous fat under there which seems to give the skin bulk. Everyone is different but if you feel the skin and it doesn't feel particularly thin, there may be more fat for you to lose which could help with appearance.

Once skin is damaged though it will never go back no matter what anyone wants to think, who you are, how long you wait.  I've talked to plastic surgeons about this because I have stretch marks and loose skin and every one has said the same thing once skin is stretched and damaged it can only be fixed surgically.  There are a lot of people whose skin expands when fat but never ""stretches.""  Those people can go back to normal, but if your skin stretches it's damaged and only surgery will fix it.  Too many people on here think that you can fix it, you can't.  It sucks, but it is what it is."

ketogains,3c7hp3,Solieus,3,Sun Jul 5 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"I've been doing the 5 day split and doing basically the same exercises in the same rep range and steadily improving in strength.   If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Especially since you are on a deficit, any gains is great. You do a lot of volume, so you could cut some exercises out if you feel you don't need to do them (you could transition to a push/pull/legs for example) IF you feel you want a change, spend to much time in the gym, or otherwise feel you need to do something for a reason OTHER than progressing. You are progressing, so you can't use that excuse bud, sorry :P  I would encourage you to make sure you are doing as many of your exercises with free weights (barbell or dumbbell) as you can to help build good stabilizers and prevent injury. For any other critiques, you need to state a problem first: ""I feel my [insert muscle/movement here] is not improving as much as I would like"" or something like that."
ketogains,3c7hp3,thebuddhasits,2,Sun Jul 5 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"Unless you are a bodybuilder on gear, dedicating an entire day to arms is a waste.  Ditch the machines, especially leg extension and rear delts.  If you want a machine for quads: hack squat.  Ditch the bro-split.  Doing one body part per week might have worked while you were expertly dropping 80 lbs, but that format becomes less relevant as you progress.  Ditch decline press.  It's not a total waste, but dips are infinitely better.  Plus, your workout program seems over-chested unless you're trying to be arnold.  Trade standing calf for donkey calf if your gym has one.  Or hit the leg press and keep it in the locked position while you toe press.  If you do legs 2x per week, just alternate.    Do OHP standing.  This is not a joke.  Your traps and shoulder crown will thank you.    Ditch front raises.  With all the pressing, it's way too much.  Get off the cables as soon as you can.  They are a good tool, but just that, a tool, so you need to do barbell rows and pull ups.  You are obviously strong (according to your lifts) so the fact that you are doing cables may be slowing you down.  Or do cables because you like the squeeze.  But squeezing doesn't really build...  Anyway, those are some opinions.  You are already progressing so kudos for that.  And always take advice on the Internet with a grain of salt.  But next time if you would be more specific as to what your goals are, the opinions might be more helpful."

If OP would rather something with slightly higher volume, Ice Cream Fitness 5x5 is another good option.

Started off on TKD and was making relatively steady progress. At some point I realized I was overdoing carbs (which was causing me nausea during workouts ) so I switched to SKD. It cured my nausea almost immediately, but it seemed I couldn't gain an ounce any more despite keeping the same caloric intake.  Increased metabolism? Selective memory? Auto-suggestion? Magic? I have no idea. Like anything else diet related you'll have to self-experiment until you stumble upon a unique combination that works for you."

It was awful and didn't go away until I stopped keto.   At the time I assumed it was my bodies reaction to having so few carbs in my diet (I usually stayed under 15 a day). But the me I've thought about it, is possible I was having a weird allergic reaction to the amounts of keto friendly food I  was eating. Now I always ate eggs, but I was eating a ton on keto everyday. Also I never had an issue with dairy, but on keto I was eating a lot of cheese and also using heavy cream in things to curb my sweet tooth.  I definitely want to go keto again,but I obviously need to plan out my food better to avoid the all consuming rash I experienced last time."

Sometimes it can be attributed to a food allergy; a lot of people find that they get it from too many eggs/too much dairy. I had it pretty bad for a while, but it inexplicably went away. It flared back up not too long ago and I realized that there was a correlation between the rash and chicken for me."

ketogains,3bwlje,Koheaghra,2,Thu Jul 2 19:18:58 2015 UTC,"Try fasted cardio before lifting. Include yohimbine. Yes you can do HIIT, then   I like your diet plan. I'd suggest to include more red meat and seafood (Even if it's canned). You'll likely recover better with those than without.   I'd suggest to do the ketogains novice program as your lifting program too. You've still got some strength to build and the auxiliary exercises will help you get a bit bigger.   The difference between the bodyweight exercises vs the auxiliary exercises is how you'll progress with load. I like pullups but they aren't curls. They won't work just your arms as hard. In the same way, wide grip pull ups can be included since there isn't much lat work. But don't modify the program drastically. Just include wide grip pullups on the day you do rows.   On rest days during the week you could do more fasted cardio (HIIT hill sprints followed by MISS), but if it starts to impact your lifts, back off. Diet > lifting > cardio. My cut worked well because I followed that order.   Are you looking to workout more than 3 days a week? You could look up a 5 day split. I did a 5 day split for my cut but I was already lifting at least 3 days/week for 6 months.   Also, how long have you been ketogenic? Are you fully adapted?"
ketogains,3bwlje,Naonin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the quick reply! I was already eating paleo for a long time before starting ketosis, so I imagine I've been it for most of the past 2 months since I started. However, I have not measured ketones.  I'm curious why you recommend fasted cardio before lifting. I feel like that would compromise my lifting. I'm also slightly unsure about introducing a lot of cardio, because my legs often feel heavy already. I'm already pushing my max for squat, so I don't know if I could introduce any more cardio without stalling.  You say to add sprints during the week, do you recommend completely taking the weekend (or possibly two non-adjacent days?) off? I'm not very strong, what advantages do you think a 5 day split would have over 3 lifting days with 2 cardio (doing no cardio on lifting days since I'll be adding in the auxiliary lifts)?  How much cardio do you recommend before lifting? I jog to the gym, about a mile.   I don't mean to sound rude, I just have a lot of questions and really appreciate the help. As you can see, I'm hesitant to add much MISS or LISS cardio, because I did a ton of it earlier in my life, and it barely did anything for me. Sure it burned some calories, but didn't help me lose fat and get in shape like lifting has.   Finally (sorry for another one), do you think it is more advantageous to burn more calories through running and risk hurting my lifts, or to simply lower my calories and miss out on the benefits of running?  These questions are keeping in mind that cutting body fat and building the muscle to keep off that body are my primary goals right now. I like food, and would like getting to the point where I have enough strength to warrant eating it. Thank You! (and great results btw)."
ketogains,3bwlje,Naonin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why you recommend fasted cardio before lifting.   I asked the same before I did it but it works. Not sure why, but it does. At first it does compromise the lifts a bit, but that's cause you're a bit tired from cardio. If you check your strength any other day without cardio, you'll be stronger.    You say to add sprints during the week, do you recommend completely taking the weekend (or possibly two non-adjacent days?) off?   And you say you want to get your cut over a fast as possible. To reach a goal weight quickly, you gotta put in a lot of effort. The more you work, the more you'll get out of it.    I'm not very strong, what advantages do you think a 5 day split would have over 3 lifting days with 2 cardio (doing no cardio on lifting days since I'll be adding in the auxiliary lifts)?   More work. More total volume lifted and more time in the gym. Therefore, better results.    How much cardio do you recommend before lifting?   10 min HIIT then jog to the gym."
ketogains,3bwlje,Mavec2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:57:20 2015 UTC,So you are actually recommending fasted cardio AND fasted lifting to follow? Just curious as I am in a similar position as OP and have similar goals.
ketogains,3bwlje,Naonin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:06:32 2015 UTC,"Yes I am. I know what the literature says regarding risk of muscle loss and power output etc. But there is also literature talking about how ketones spare muscle and how much power output there is with ketones+ glucose+ insulin (TKD).   I was usually about 5-6 hours fasted before doing cardio followed immediately by lifting. All my lifts have gone up and my cardio has gotten better as I've got leaner.   For a ketogenic body, fasted cardio seems to work miracles. There might be something there with fasted lifting also."
ketogains,3bwlje,Naonin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to add much MISS or LISS cardio, because I did a ton of it earlier in my life, and it barely did anything for me. Sure it burned some calories, but didn't help me lose fat and get in shape like lifting has.   I was too, but it works. Fasted cardio is good shit. There seems to be some synergy with fasted cardio and keto also that is something special.    I'm hesitant to add much MISS or LISS cardio, because I did a ton of it earlier in my life, and it barely did anything for me. Sure it burned some calories, but didn't help me lose fat and get in shape like lifting has.   If you're pushing injury from running, definitely skip it and decrease calories. Diet > lifting > cardio. But if you're worried about a number on your lifts, then that's your ego you need to get over. Nobody knows your numbers but everyone can see your body. Would you rather look like you can bench 300 but only hit 200, or actually bench 300 but look like you can't bench 200? Both are possible and plausible depending on your training. Strength and muscle mass are only moderately correlated.   The body doesn't know numbers. It only knows what fuel it had and what amount of work its being pushed to do. If you're not going over calories while maintaining adequate protein, you can work as hard as you can handle and lose fat.   Looking at my results, let me tell you, it was hard. There were many days I felt like I couldn't do it but I wanted it really fucking bad. You gotta want it dude. Push hard and then push a bit more."

I'll take some time to figure out exactly what I want to do, but you've definitely given me a lot to think about. Currently I'm thinking I'll switch to the Keto Novice workout and begin to add cardio on the non-lifting days, increasing as my weight loss stalls. If my lifts stall, should I just keep repeating the same lifts while I cut? (And I'm definitely going to try to eat more fish.)  I'd like to know if anyone else has a take on this.

By the time you get back to the same weight once or twice you might have finished your cut."

ketogains,3buej6,darthluiggi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"Could be, and also electrolytes, especially salt ;)"
ketogains,3buej6,SeekingMC,2,Thu Jul 2 14:03:44 2015 UTC,"2 cups of broth, a can of mushrooms and an avocado a day should keep things in check. Right? Besides adding salt to almost anything :))  l.e. So after a couple of weeks of TKD, insulin should improve. Does this mean that I could feel ok when my birthday comes? (the inevitable carbs and alcohol consumption)"
ketogains,3buej6,darthluiggi,2,Thu Jul 2 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"Lol...  Birthday.  Well, eat your cake, drink in moderation, try to avoid fat on that day."
ketogains,3buej6,Darkbl00m,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:02:36 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of drinking, but a couple glasses of wine are due. So no worries that the carbs will make me jittery?  I brought up the birthday thing because I can't avoid it as much as I wanted to. I need to know what to expect (yeah, basically a control freak). For example, it didn't even cross my mind to ""avoid fat"". I expected to lower it to a ""medium"" at most."
ketogains,3buej6,famasfilms,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"Carbs don't make anyone ""jittery""... In all, what one does experience after a carb load / binge is lethargy and sleepiness.  Try to keep fat as low as possible.   Wine should be fine."
ketogains,3buej6,darthluiggi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing that up. And also, thank you for your patience with my noobie questions."
ketogains,3bu7g7,Darkbl00m,2,Thu Jul 2 04:43:56 2015 UTC,"Is that measurement via DEXA or hydrostatic tank? If neither, it's irrelevant   As for your question, depends on rate of gain + training status"
ketogains,3bu7g7,jammie2015,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:40:17 2015 UTC,"It's based on DEXA scans, at same time of day on rest days, with same breakfast and pretty much same state of hydration. I am fairly confident that I can use the measurements on a comparative basis.  Not sure I understand your second point: the rate of gain is 5.4lb/month, training status, as per Strength Standards, is around intermediate."
ketogains,3bu7g7,Bosona,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:24:37 2015 UTC,I'd personally cut those surplus calories in half. If your DEXA scans produced accurate results your LBM gain is about as good as most current literature claims you can get. Why pile on the extra fat then?
ketogains,3brs73,deathsythe,5,Wed Jul 1 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"I've found that not abandoning the lat pull down machine has really helped. Lighten the weight, really widen your arms and focus entirely on squeezing the shit out of your lats. They'll explode. Mine did :P"
ketogains,3brs73,fidderstix,3,Wed Jul 1 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"Once you can do 25+ at BW across 3 sets, buy a belt and start adding weight, and watch your strength explode.  Chins and dips are by far the best assistance exercises I've added to my routine."
ketogains,3brs73,Stinkynugs,3,Wed Jul 1 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"Try L-sit pullups on rings instead, murder!"
ketogains,3brs73,Danco3636,2,Thu Jul 2 07:05:45 2015 UTC,I love me some weighted chins with 100 lbs on keto
ketogains,3brs73,Correctrix,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yay, they're pretty fun.  I did four yesterday, and I'm not even really working on arms (I'm a weak girlie working on lower-body strength and marathon training).  When I see guys doing it with weights at the gym, it's pretty impressive stuff."
ketogains,3brw36,bgdish,6,Wed Jul 1 17:27:34 2015 UTC,I buy it from bulkapothecary.com  love that site.
ketogains,3brw36,pure___poppycock,3,Wed Jul 1 18:44:46 2015 UTC,I want to see someone buy the 412lb drum of MCT
ketogains,3brw36,Tripleberst,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"Boom. That site is great, thanks for the recommendation. Great price on cocoa butter too. Can't wait to explore it more. Do you get this? It's a great bargain but I'm wondering if it is essentially the same product like the one offered from NOW foods or viva labs. Do you know?"
ketogains,3brw36,pure___poppycock,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I buy the 7.5 jug. I also buy avocado oil for high heat cooking from there. I don't buy their third party stuff like Now, it's usually cheaper on amazon. I've cooked with the cocoa butter before too. Good stuff."
ketogains,3brw36,applevinegar,5,Wed Jul 1 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Just get coconut oil, it's about 90% MCT."
ketogains,3brw36,rickamore,7,Wed Jul 1 18:37:02 2015 UTC,Coconut oil is 60% MCT.
ketogains,3brw36,applevinegar,2,Wed Jul 1 18:43:04 2015 UTC,"You're right, I was thinking saturated fats.  Still, I find that coconut oil is good enough."
ketogains,3brw36,rickamore,5,Wed Jul 1 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"For most it's fine and cheaper, I find I don't even use MCT."
ketogains,3brw36,abdada,2,Wed Jul 1 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"Oh jeez I totally mis-interpreted the word ""bulk"" here, lol."
ketogains,3brw36,rickamore,2,Wed Jul 1 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"If you get a case of it, how many years will it take you to go through it?  In all seriousness, try emailing one of the companies that produces it, if they can't sell you a flat they may direct you somewhere that can. Or you could try and sweet talk a local store into ordering it for you."
ketogains,3brw36,SeekingMC,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"I go through about 8-10 tbs a day while bulking, so it tends to go pretty fast."
ketogains,3bqrx8,chisey,15,Wed Jul 1 11:51:21 2015 UTC,You might be drinking too much water and diluting your electrolytes. I would back off the water
ketogains,3bqrx8,anbeav,6,Wed Jul 1 11:58:40 2015 UTC,Definitely is. A pinch of sea salt in every few cups of water will help with absorption and retention.
ketogains,3bqrx8,Erikthenomad,2,Wed Jul 1 14:44:08 2015 UTC,Is there a rule of thumb re: water intake for a keto gainer?  All this time I thought I was drinking so much water and it still wasn't enough . . . it would be a relief to drink less.
ketogains,3bqrx8,anbeav,3,Wed Jul 1 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"Listen to your body, don't just drink to drink. It's highly variable. I drink more than a gallon but I sweat out a few liters a day, so have to listen to your body, like now I think it's telling you...too much water. It sounds like you're diluting sodium and water doesn't work without sodium, you just excrete the water. Cut back and see if that helps"
ketogains,3bqrx8,TwinEclipse,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"Well this is where I feel like an idiot then, possibly making the problem worse by trying to make it better.   I'll also look into lite salt, as I still think I'm short on potassium."
ketogains,3bqrx8,callmejay,3,Wed Jul 1 18:49:08 2015 UTC,I have the same problem with hydration.  Maybe add some salt or baking soda with  lemon before sleep?
ketogains,3bqrx8,T_Rash,3,Wed Jul 1 12:20:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure about hydration, but slathering on the chapstick before bed helps with the cracking."
ketogains,3bqrx8,cleofus,3,Wed Jul 1 13:03:49 2015 UTC,I wake up dehydrated every morning. I keep a quart of powerade zero next to the bed. If I wake up to pee I drink some of it. When I wake up I drink the rest.
ketogains,3bqrx8,T_Rash,12,Wed Jul 1 16:11:45 2015 UTC,I don't think drinking your pee is going to help in this situation.
ketogains,3bqrx8,radixmalorumest,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:15:43 2015 UTC,Lots of sodium to help with water retention.
ketogains,3bqrx8,Tw1987,2,Fri Jul 3 02:24:04 2015 UTC,You got good advice. I think if you do need that much water (due to say working or exercising in the heat) then you might want to double your electrolytes. It sounds like you might be low on salt anyway.
ketogains,3bqrx8,lorilr,2,Wed Jul 1 19:41:59 2015 UTC,This happens to me when I first started keto and also when I got back onto keto after a vacation.  It goes way for me after that.
ketogains,3bqrx8,voidptr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:04:55 2015 UTC,I put salt and/ or lite salt in nearly every glass of water and still having this issue.  And leg cramps.  Today I'm trying just eating 1/4 tsp of salt during the day
ketogains,3bqrx8,The_Wac,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I forgot to even mention the middle-of-the-night calf cramps.  If this is an electrolyte issue I need to get it solved. I take potassium citrate throughout the day, magnesium citrate at night, and average around 4g of sodium per day via food. Not enough? Could it really be too much water? I worry sometimes that it isn't enough."
ketogains,3brwoy,Panke,6,Wed Jul 1 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"This all depends on adaptation to keto. If you're just starting the transition to keto, recovery will likely be reduced due to lack of glycogen and that your body has not adapted to burning fat as yet.   If you are fully adapted (8-12 weeks in), you shouldn't have any trouble recovering between sets/sprints/intervals, provided your body is used to this exercise load. If you've never performed sets/sprints/intervals, you will also need to adapt your muscles to this. Keto does not make you an Olympian."
ketogains,3brwoy,Motorboat_Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"I am very well aware that you can lift on keto and recover and didn't expect keto to make me an olympian. I was hoping for a more detailed insight into how recovery works in general and how this might be effected by keto.   I've read that a ketogenic diet increases a the number of mitochondria. If mitochondria oxidize lactat into ATP, this might have an positive effect of the recovery between sets.  Something like that."
ketogains,3brwoy,Motorboat_Jones,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"There's nothing supernatural about keto. You won't recover anymore incredibly than if you were following any other diet. As I said, it's due to adaptation. It's not a magic bullet.  I've never heard this theory about increased mitochondria. I do not have any studies for you to support this as I do not believe any exist. If they do, I hope someone can post them with references."
ketogains,3bqquh,anbeav,5,Wed Jul 1 11:37:20 2015 UTC,"If it fits your macros but many find even if that's true alcohol stalls loss, ymmv"

ketogains,3bqquh,anbeav,5,Wed Jul 1 11:50:27 2015 UTC,"Find a balance. I cut out beer for keto-- and I love beer-- but I drink bourbon sometimes socially, because evenings out are better with a little buzz. Just don't overdo it.  I actually found that once I became passionate about improving my body, I didn't want to drink as much anymore."
ketogains,3bqquh,darthluiggi,2,Wed Jul 1 11:57:16 2015 UTC,Not all just some do have to see if it affects you
ketogains,3bqquh,Danco3636,4,Wed Jul 1 11:57:02 2015 UTC,"What I usually do, is calculate each drink at around 100 kcals and reduce fat grams accordingly.  2-3 drinks won't mess up your cut - if done responsibly.  Also, when drinking, try to just have meat / protein / veggies."
ketogains,3bqquh,turbophysics,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:50:56 2015 UTC,That's what I do and works great....  Also try having your drinks post fasting....  You get more feel good for your money and burn it off quickly... :-)
ketogains,3bqquh,bobdickgus,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Isnt alcohol converted to sugar by the body? I did a little research a while ago but what I remember was that alcohol, regardless of other sugar in the drink, is itself a carb. It seems cruel, I love alcohol."
ketogains,3bqquh,turbophysics,2,Wed Jul 1 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"No, the liver converts it to mostly acetate which fuels peripheral tissue. While you are metabolizing ethanol you down regulate fat/carb utilization so food intake is mostly stored. Ethanol tends to remove inhibition so makes controlling food intake more difficult while under the influence. Ethanol acts abit like an MCT, under a deficit will not have a negative effect on fat loss overall and possibly a benefit, but unlike MCT the tendency to remove inhibition can cause problems. Talking ethanol as in vodka here not sugary drinks where most of the issues are the sugar."
ketogains,3bqquh,bobdickgus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:21:15 2015 UTC,So you're saying vodka is more or less harmless as long as you dont break diet while intoxicated by it?
ketogains,3bqquh,turbophysics,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:56:13 2015 UTC,Ethanol has pronounced negative effects on muscle protein synthesis at around 1.5 g/kg body weight. But moderate consumption shouldn't be to bad for fat loss. Provided diet followed.
ketogains,3bqquh,Correctrix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:43:45 2015 UTC,"So no alcohol if I'm bulking but I'm fine otherwise. Hey thanks for the advice, pal."
ketogains,3bqquh,Motorboat_Jones,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:25:44 2015 UTC,"No, the liver converts it to mostly acetate which fuels peripheral tissue.   Are you saying it gives me ketones even when not in ketosis?  Yay!   Ethanol tends to remove inhibition so makes controlling food intake more difficult while under the influence.   Oh jeez, tell me about it.  People say that weed gives them the munchies.  Give me a glass of wine or beer, and I am shovelling every source of starches into my mouth as fast as possible.  Such cravings.  Potato curry on a bed of lovely cardamom basmati...  This is one big reason why I rarely drink."
