Here's me today: clumsily pregnant and bereft of pockets. Not like ""oops my belly ran into that thing"" clumsy, but like I can't control my arms and legs for some reason and I'm leaving a trail of destruction behind me. I desperately want to listen to good music all day and think about just how awesome this good music is, and then I would feel feelings besides irritation. Kid got up today and let me sleep until 8am without waking me up. Holy shit is this a big day. I composed a bit of poem in my head this morning that started ""why are there so many spiders in our shower?""  We could have a full-term baby in a month and holy cow is that crazy. Exciting, scary, amazing, and crazy. Life keeps happening."

InfertilityBabies,3e7a1a,jaina_jade,2,Wed Jul 22 14:42:29 2015 UTC,Is that how it typically is for singletons after twins? They just act like it's no big deal? It's still a big deal!
InfertilityBabies,3e7a1a,jaina_jade,3,Wed Jul 22 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"Had someone just reach out and touch my belly today - and my hands were full with papers so I couldn't do anything about it.  Today is also #bumpday so people at work are asking if they can take pictures of my bump for facebook.  I feel like the Grinch, but nope not happening.  At least I'm in a 4hr training course this afternoon, and I'm teaching it so my stomach should be safe.  Then just one more day of work before wedding, then another day of work (Monday) before GenCon!!!!   Is anyone else going this year?"

InfertilityBabies,3e7a1a,DookieSandwich,3,Wed Jul 22 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"Your cake is so amazing!! Did you just do fondant cutouts? What about for his mouth? I'm sooooo interested in your process!    Today husband is supposed to be taking the day off to spend it with us before he goes out of town for business this afternoon since he won't be back until the weekend. Guess who is holed up in his home office working? Even better, he just texted me (from the other side of the house, mind you) that he has an important meeting to go to before he leaves and needs me to go get his dry cleaning.... Like right now with the toddler who is supposed to nap very soon. Sigh...    In baby news, S was eating cereal the other day because that's what she asked for. I made myself a taco and she totally gave me stink eye when I sat down to eat with her. So I asked her ""do you want some? Taco?"" And she goes ""Food??.... TACO!!!"" Now she keeps asking for tacos. She'll eat anything as long as it's a taco. Guacamole, black beans, and roasted corn? Sure! Beef fajitas and cheese? Yep! Eggs, potatoes, and cheese? Breakfast tacos! :)"
InfertilityBabies,3e7a1a,HerVoiceEchoes,2,Wed Jul 22 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's mostly fondant cut outs. I just bought a big box of white fondant, dyed it to the colors needed, rolled it out and cut shapes out with a knife. The black mouth outline and whiskers are just fondant rolled out. Took about 4 hours including baking the cake from scratch and blending up some frosting. The cakes stuck to the pan and basically disintegrated from being too moist so I had to shove it all back together with frosting. It's a war zone under the fondant. Unfortunately the fondant imparted a weird taste to the cake so even if you peel it off to eat just the cake it tastes off. My kid still loved it though so that's all that matters.  That's hilarious that your child asks for tacos, and now you get her to try new things simply because it's a taco. Tacos are like a top 3 food for me so I totally get it."

InfertilityBabies,3e7a1a,healthylurker,2,Wed Jul 22 15:05:22 2015 UTC,Hopefully if he's allergic it turns out to be mild and something he grows out of.
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,gizmo_love,3,Tue Jul 21 21:47:24 2015 UTC,I've heard the roughing it up thing doesn't really work or matter. I would suggest taking a breastfeeding class before the baby gets here. Our hospital offered one. We did one before my twins were born and it really helped. It helped me understand how it should look and though we couldn't really practice I learned holds and stuff.  If possibly have your partner go to. My husband remembered stuff and was able to support me better since he went too. In the hospital see if there are Lactation Consultants that can come in and work with you. They helped also. Though we supplemented a bit in the beginning we just made it to 6 months and our now EBF.
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,krodjerz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:36 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the consensus. Alrighty, off to book a breastfeeding class!"
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,pamplemousse2,3,Tue Jul 21 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I were going to do it again, I'd have taken a breastfeeding course ahead of time. It SUCKED at first for me - I had inverted nipples, so they were NOT used to seeing the light of day. But it was bearable (there was a whole lot of naked boobies at first), and now it's not an issue (unless my child bites me. Whole other story).   I've heard that the roughing up recommendation is old timey an generally not a thing anymore.  So like... yeah, a good latch doesn't hurt, but also yeah it'll be sensitive at first. Worth it for us though."
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,mrswhiskerson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"But cracked and bleeding? Those are the horror stories I'm getting. Sensitive is one thing, an open wound a whole different issue haha."
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,messofletters,3,Tue Jul 21 23:27:54 2015 UTC,Small cracks can be normal but anything more is almost always related to a less than ideal latch. Minor pain also not unexpected but terrible pain is probably the same thing and I tell all the moms I work with to please please see a LC sooner than later if it really hurts or you have more than a small crack because it's easier to fix bad habits early and boob wounds can get out of control if not addressed in a timely fashion.
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,pamplemousse2,2,Tue Jul 21 23:57:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any issues with cracking or bleeding, but I was told applying lanolin during pregnancy could help prevent it."
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,female_engineer_here,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"Mine don't get that bad. Cracked and bleeding does happen though, usually due to a bad latch (is my understanding). Lanolin works wonders, and ideally you'd get some help before it got to that stage."
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,socphd,2,Wed Jul 22 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"I've wondered this same thing.  Is there any way we can prepare?  You can't really practice.  I have no idea how you'd go about ""roughing them up"" but I like the idea of finding a way to be more prepared for the pain!"

InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,hopefaithandlove,2,Wed Jul 22 00:38:09 2015 UTC,"I have very sensitive skin and I agree, the first few times nursing were not very pleasant -- as far as the tweeking is concerned. Overall it's a great feeling to be able to feed your child. That feels miraculous! That makes you forget the nasty feeling quite quickly. It's only the first few draws (correct English word?) that feel nasty, anyway, and I intentionally don't use the word ""hurt"" here, so don't worry. You're gonna curl your toes and that's it. Be aware of the fact, though, that you will have little contractions during the first few times you breastfeed. That's important for the uterus to contract again. Scared the bejesus out of me, because nobody told me!"
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,Peachmaru,2,Wed Jul 22 10:09:23 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, the first few sucks,  where the baby is establishing the latch, feels really strange,  and it's a STRONG sensation,  similar to pain,  but somehow different.    I find if the latch is 'easy' at first, then ivf_babe only has my nipple and it's gonna get painful real quick.   Our Pre-natal and parenting class had one session on breastfeeding and positioning the baby,  talking both about traditional holds (crosscradle, cradle,  football, etc) and laid back positioning (which I find MUCH more comfortable).   We also had a mandatory breastfeeding session with an LC (as a group) before we were discharged from the hospital, and a 1-on-1 session because the babe was low weight. I live in Ontario,  but who knows what the standard is where OP is..."
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,cheshirecat99,2,Wed Jul 22 12:55:56 2015 UTC,No personal experience but my SIL just went through this. Most of her pain is caused because he doesn't latch properly due to flat nipples. The lactation consultant gave her this clear shield that suctions over her nipple. She said this has saved her nipples and causes so much less pain.  I think I even saw them at babies r us.
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,GrammaMo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"That's good to know, I've heard of those. I'll have to pick some up just in case. Thanks!"
InfertilityBabies,3e4ftr,socphd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"I have pretty sensitive skin, and my nipples were really sensitive during pregnancy to the point of general pain.  Plus I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in the past and sometimes things that should feel nice cause me pain.  That said, I did not do any kind of toughening up as I had never heard of that, and I nursed for 12 months, and pumped for about 10 of those months.  I'm not going to say it was easy or even particularly enjoyable, but it wasn't constantly painful.  A good lactation consultant can help if things hurt early on (or so I'm told, I never found one)."
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,septicidal,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"We hired a doula and she was worth every penny! We paid $800. We hired her at around 20 weeks. I have a platelet disorder and can't have an epidural. My choices for labor were unmedicated or unconscious (general anesthesia c-section). We didn't find out the sexes of our twins and I wanted to start skin-to-skin and nursing right away so we went for it! We were lucky. Both babies were head down and I had a very supportive OB. We went full on hippie with a doula, birthing stool, low lighting, essential oils, etc! Our delivery room was next door to the OR should anything have gone wrong.  She was amazing before during and after birth.  We have an agency in town. We met with the director and told her things we preferred, esp. someone with experience with twins. She matched us with 4 people ranking them based on who she thought would be best. We met with the first one and fell in love! I give my doula credit for my ability to deliver my twins unmedicated.   Good luck! Ask any questions if I left anything out."
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,NBPTS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:38:11 2015 UTC,"We picked our doula at 35 weeks or so. Most of the ones in the area weren't available because we were so late! But the one we went with was wonderful, had worked with our midwives and at our hospital, we had a great feeling on her when we met, etc. She did not do post-partum (she wanted to focus on labor and has kept to it) but had women to recommend if we needed.   Contact your OB practice to see if they have doulas they work with - that's how we found ours.   Mr B found our doula invaluable. He didn't have to try and translate what I needed, help with positioning, or even remember to get food (she brought him breakfast and ordered us a meal immediately after labor!) He said if it weren't for her, watching me be in pain would have completely broken him. So she did exactly what you're thinking - be an extra support so he could be a part of the labor without being overwhelmed.   She was $1150; my MIL paid half as a shower gift. Best gift ever. We have decided if my SIL ever has a baby that will be our shower gift to her.   If you want, PM me - I can send you the info for ours and for another who came highly recommended by our midwives and a friend (she was unavailable for ours though.) There are SO MANY in the area."
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,larabair,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"For my first pregnancy, I scheduled the doula pretty early (around 15 weeks or so). I found her by asking my doctor for a recommendation, and then a friend of mine also recommended her (so it seemed like a perfect fit!). But then the baby was breech, so I ended up with a planned c-section and got my money back from the doula.   Factors that were important to me were: someone who would be neutral about type of birth plan (epidural vs. natural, etc.), recommended by doctor/friend, lots of experience (over 1000 births), massage therapy background and a focus on positioning of the fetus for a faster delivery. And in general, I liked her personality and felt comfortable talking to her. I think that's an important part of the equation too."
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,slumlord2001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"Do it, do it, do it! Our doula was immensely helpful, and was an amazing support for my husband so he could help me. We got a recommendation from a friend, met her, liked it (it was important to me to have someone I liked), and hired her. We paid $700, and an extra $50 for her to take some photos. I'd have paid more. If we have another, I'd definitely hire her (or someone else if she's not available) again.  It was important to me to have someone who was DONA certified, who had worked in our hospital, and had worked with midwives before. Asking for recommendations on how to proceed is a great start - and yeah, now sounds like a good time to be interviewing!"
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:03:59 2015 UTC,"I found my doula by looking through profiles on doula match. Hired her around 17 weeks. Planned to interview 3, but one of them cancelled because she booked out my due date month (which is what doulas in my area seem to do, don't care what actual due date but due month and only take on so many clients per month)."
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,mrswhiskerson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:51:46 2015 UTC,I've hired a doula. This is my first pregnancy and my husband is super uncomfortable in hospitals. I did a ton of googling and found a few in my area; checked their certifications and then interviewed. I decided to go with a group who gives you two doulas so one is always on call and rested for you. I can contact them anytime with questions throughout my pregnancy not just right before the birth. We had an awesome get to know you session and I text them updates after every appointment.   I booked mine early because I'm due around the holidays and I know availability will be more limited. I think it's more common to wait till you're out of the first trimester. Me and my husband love our doulas so far and I feel better knowing we'll have the extra support.   It can't hurt to interview some and see if you find one that clicks.
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,FireyLily,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:24:45 2015 UTC,"We considered a doula but as long as my EDD is on Thanksgiving I'm ""not eligible"" - plan to talk to my OB Thursday and see if she can move it up a day so that I can at least get a consultation.  If I wind up delivering on Thanksgiving, the doula won't be there but we get all the money back.  This is for the doula group partnered with our hospital, there are a few independents but most of them still have Thanksgiving blacked out."
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,jaina_jade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:41 2015 UTC,My OB shifted my due date to 11/28 (based on my NT scan) though in reality I know I ovulated 48 hours earlier and had the IUI 24 hours after that... But on record they've adjusted things to 11/28.  So I think maybe I have that going for me?  But I am concerned I would be in labor on Thanksgiving and then not have the support I want.  I was hoping finding a doula I liked would give me some more confidence about the birth but if the person I likes won't guarantee to be there... Ugh.
InfertilityBabies,3e3e50,jaina_jade,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:10 2015 UTC,"I was shocked when I found out that most of them don't do the big holidays.  Unless you are getting a scheduled c-section, baby is going to come when it's going to come."

My son no longer accepts any bedtime story other than ""The Little Blue Truck"". He won't even accept the sequel. No, it has to be that book. If I try to read him a different bedtime story and he can spot that book, he fights tooth and nail to get out of my lap so he can grab that book and then demand it be read to him. If I hide the book, he has a complete meltdown, which is exactly the opposite of what I want to happen at bedtime, so I don't even bother trying a different book at this point.  I'm at work and just realized I have the book entirely memorized. I'm starting to hate that book. And that this complaint feels good to have...

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,kat_loves_tea,2,Wed Jul 22 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"My eye just twitched when you started that. But it's a cute book the first 50 times or so!  I DEFINITELY hide books when I'm getting sick of them. Mostly just shelve them backwards so the spine isn't out (and we have a TON of books in our house). But that doesn't help when the kid is super focused on one thing. My kiddo has gone in and out of phases of wanting to listen to ""Hey Mickey"" over and over and over again while dancing in the last few months. I think she listened to it 10-12 times in a row last night while I cooked dinner. This morning for (almost) the first time ever she got out of bed on her own and actually tried to entertain herself and get out cereal. It did involve playing ""Hey Mickey"" 3 times on full blast one room away from where we were sleeping, so it's not like we got to sleep in, but she was doing the right things so we layered on the praise anyway."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,lancealittle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:39 2015 UTC,My friends kid has that book and I love it!  But I could definitely see it getting old as a parent reading it all the time.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,female_engineer_here,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:46 2015 UTC,I totally hid a book this evening. I can't take some of them anymore. Beep! Beep! Beep!

We were able to get a date night Saturday because he actually got home on time. Jurassic World was pretty good. Parker's ""party"" went well, I'll have to post some pictures tomorrow for his birthday...can't believe my baby is going to be 2."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,ThatGreenSolGirl,4,Tue Jul 21 15:56:32 2015 UTC,The right side of my mouth is numb for the second day of dentist work in a row!  But at least it's somewhat distracting me from obsessing over the fact that our anatomy ultrasound is tomorrow. I can't believe it's almost here. I so want to find out if our baby is healthy and growing! And I want to know the sex! Tomorrow is just going to be such a big day pregnancy wise!

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,logisticaladventure,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:37 2015 UTC,I puked last might while brushing my teeth. Horrible thing was I was peeing while brushing and I had to leap up to spit it out in the sink.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,dizzyvonblue,2,Tue Jul 21 22:21:45 2015 UTC,You can't even multitask in peace! :(   One thing that helped today was mouthwash beforehand.

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,logisticaladventure,2,Tue Jul 21 22:34:42 2015 UTC,Hooray for clean teeth and hair. That stuff makes such a huge difference.  Hopefully this is the start of a good trend!
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,MrsDragon,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:32 2015 UTC,Hopefully this is the start of a good trend!   I hope so! Did you hear that baby?
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,logisticaladventure,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"Woot, congratulations!"
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,pamplemousse2,4,Tue Jul 21 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"First, thank you all so much for the kind words about my kitty baby.  I really appreciate it.  Second, just another example of how when it rains it pours... I just found out I have gestational diabetes.  Waiting for the specialist to call to set up my first appointment.  I was literally in the middle of eating what was left of my birthday cake and had to throw the rest out."

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,lancealittle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:42:26 2015 UTC,Well said.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,TigFan15,4,Wed Jul 22 00:17:12 2015 UTC,"Our nanny had her pregnancy confirmation appointment/ultrasound today. It's so crazy to me that her attitude about it was, ""This is just part of the process"" and my head all day was, ""I really hope she doesn't get bad news today. Please let there be a little baby on her ultrasound."" She even bought baby clothes as a way to announce to her parents this weekend. It's bizarre and it makes me a little sad and jealous but her excitement is so genuine. There's nothing conceited about it so it's nice to be around."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,RositaYouBitch,3,Tue Jul 21 21:24:48 2015 UTC,Wow...So that's how normals do pregnancy.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,Iamagnu,2,Wed Jul 22 02:14:41 2015 UTC,It just seems so foreign and different than what we are used to but it's good that it's genuine!
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,kat_loves_tea,3,Wed Jul 22 03:16:07 2015 UTC,After 5 days of increasingly worse all day sickness.. I woke up feeling normal. Which is nice considering I have things I need to get done today... but it's slightly unnerving. I know symptoms coming and going is normal. But still. Shit is weird.   My FIL is here until Saturday and I have never in my life met someone who can consistently talk or make noise every second that they are conscious. It is insane. My husband and I are generally quiet people... so it's been an interesting couple of days. We told him yesterday we are pregnant and he talked for 3 hours about everything I should expect. My husband snarkily asked if he was going to be our obgyn  now. He also told me my hair dryer is the biggest electricity expense. I've probably dried my hair twice in the last 3 months. Like... what?  This is going to be a sloooooow week.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,Semirelatednonsense,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:27 2015 UTC,"Oh God. I'm not a particularly quiet person at all, but people who chatter every minute drive me nuts as well. Good luck."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,Iamagnu,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:13 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be nice if your hairdryer was your biggest electrical expense though? Sounds like you'd have the cheapest electric bills ever if that was the case!
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,GrammaMo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:45 2015 UTC,It's like feeling foreign in your own body hey!

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,Semirelatednonsense,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, any chance he'll quiet down once he's got it out of his system?  I know, the symptoms coming and going will really throw you for a loop!"
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:10 2015 UTC,God I hope so. He's here until Saturday and I might snap if I can't just sit in the living room in peace for 30 minutes.

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,PrincessCBHammock,3,Wed Jul 22 12:47:45 2015 UTC,After our loss a month and half ago i still have HCG in my system and it is slowly starting to go up. Scheduled for a sonohysterogram for Thursday with possible endometrial biopsy. I am just so ready for this failed IVF cycle to be over so we can try again.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,FartWalker,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:51 2015 UTC,Your HCG is going up?  Did you mistype it?  Should it be going down to zero before you can start trying again?
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,vibeee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:52:51 2015 UTC,Yup it is going up. Not by a lot but my clinic is worried there is leftover tissue from the miscarriage that is still producing HCG. Right now my HCG is sitting at 32 or so. Enough so that if i were to take a pregnancy test it would show up positive. I am just ready to get the HCG down to 0 so we can do a FET.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,FartWalker,2,Tue Jul 21 22:32:35 2015 UTC,Sounds like they are keeping an eye on you.  I had two ectopics so I know this issue can get out of hand quickly if not monitored.  I hope it goes down for you soon so you can move on!
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,vibeee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:09:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I hope so too. My clinic has been awesome about the whole thing so I can't complain about them. I have a history of ectopics so they have been moving quickly to keep on top of things."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,FartWalker,2,Wed Jul 22 01:05:37 2015 UTC,I can only imagine your frustration.  Hopefully the shg figures out whats going on?
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,female_engineer_here,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:30:13 2015 UTC,A week ago I was frustrated. Now I am just in a foul mood. It has been a month and half since the miscarriage and I am ready for it to be over.
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,FartWalker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:24 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I'm sorry. I've been there (retained tissue after a D&C) and it sucked."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,Iamagnu,2,Wed Jul 22 02:12:23 2015 UTC,"So yeah. Croup. No sleep. But making all this worse? Mr. H's new university still hasn't processed his benefits paperwork, almost two weeks after he turned it in. So now I'm playing all these nightmare scenarios in my head where we have to take her to the ER for croup and we have zero insurance. We already owe her pediatrician for the 18 month check up but billing let it slide because we assumed we'd have insurance info to give them by now. Anyway so Mr. H has to call HR and bitch them out today and I'm entirely expecting that they'll say they never got the paperwork even though he commuted a fucking hour down there two weeks ago and turned it in in person because they refuse to take it by email because IDK WHY I JUST REALLY HATE THEM RIGHT NOW!!!  ....deep breaths...  So...he might have to commute down there again today and I'll have to call the peds office to see if they want to see her and have another totally awkward, wholly unnecessary conversation with billing. I know the benefits are going to be retroactive but I'd rather not pay out of pocket up front if I don't have to. Ugh. I hate this country's healthcare system and the state university's total inability to not drop the ball on every damn thing.  UPDATE: Apparently we missed a form we were supposed to fill out but they didn't let us know until we called them to ask what was up. They said we can email it but ""it takes longer."" I don't know wtf that means because Mr. H doesn't know how to deal with stuff like this. He didn't even get the name of the lady he spoke to on the phone. We don't have a land line so we aren't able to fax it easily, so we just went with email. I told him he has to call tomorrow to confirm that they received the form and are going to process the fucking paperwork now. Thank g-d we only have to do this once.   I called the ped's office and the billing rep was super nice and said to give her another call in a week since I'm hoping it will all be ironed out by then."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,traveler5678,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"Aww, I'm sorry about poor Z and hope she feels better soon!  I had a similar situation when I was first hired.  Make sure Mr. Z is getting everything in writing."

My MFM said I could take up to 3000mg of Tylenol a day. the first 1000mg does nothing. I have to wait hours to take the second 1000mg and by then it's so bad I want to cry. Working a full time job and having a 2 year old is not conducive for this set back. MFM said when I start maxing out the 3000mg a day without relief, we'd talk about a next step, which is a narcotic, which is not what I want. Suck.   EDIT: I drink close to 120 ounces of water a day"
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,cakegroove,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:37 2015 UTC,I am so sorry. Headaches are the absolute worst! When mine are at their peak horribleness I use a cold compress (usually just washcloth) on my forehead and lay down...but I don't have a 2 year old! I hope it gets better soon!!!

My OB prescribed Reglan and it's the only thing that helps (although Tylenol with a little caffeine kick sometimes sort of takes the edge off). Call your doc about the Reglan! It's been a lifesaver for me.

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,messofletters,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:18 2015 UTC,I had a dream that I woke up in the middle of the night and made myself an omelet.  And then I actually woke up in the middle of the night because my patch of probably-ringworm itched so badly I scratched myself awake.  Upside: all of my cabinets are in!  And fit correctly!  One of the doors got a little dinged but I think with a tiny bit of touch-up paint it won't really be noticeable.

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,SJP8,2,Wed Jul 22 02:28:10 2015 UTC,I'm starting to feel slight amount of morning sickness - not the I'm gonna puke type but more just feeling yucky - we have our 2nd ultrasound on Thursday at 7 weeks. A lot of ladies talking about anatomy scans this week. We know the sex of our baby from doing PGS on our embryos. Anyone else in the same situation? I'm curious how that changed things for you? I guess we don't have the surprise half way through pregnancy - the surprise for us was more when we got the results of our PGS testing back - I get to plan from day one that we are having a boy
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,GrammaMo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"We didn't have the PGS testing, but we did find out the sexes at 12 weeks thanks to the ultra high def ultrasounds at our maternal fetal specialist's office. So not from the beginning, but it almost felt like it, since I was holding my breath until the miscarriage risk dropped around that same time."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,SJP8,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:51 2015 UTC,"Day 3 of heatwave.  I think tomorrow will be below 90 so yay!  Despite awful heat, I managed to be somewhat productive by doing laundry (yay for the Lillebaby carrier!) and went to the drugstore for some anti gas meds lol.  For those of you who are breastfeeding, my girl is changing her feeding habits. She's now eating every hour (during daytime only, night time she wakes us up once if at all) and would only latch on for 5 minutes tops on a boob.  This os making me uncomfortble, and I don't want to pump every hour because thats exhausting and I dont want to mess with my supply.  Am I doing something wrong?  Is this normal?  Edit: she is making lots of wet diapers, pooping slightly less frequently, but I think thats normal right?"
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,gizmo_love,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:56 2015 UTC,"You are not doing anything wrong. Your baby is being fed and has a good amount of wet diapers so everything is ok. Don't worry (easier said than done, I know!)  I think you have the right idea with not wanting to pump so often. It seems like baby might be trying to increase your supply, so you probably don't want to also do something to increase it too and end up with oversupply issues.    Do you have a la leche league group near you? It might be good to hear these reassurances in person. They also have group leaders who you can call or email at any time for advice or support.

Then I had to laugh at myself, I used to get this excited about the latest palette from Urban Decay or brushes from Sigma.  I love how our paths in life change. It makes me giggle.  Edit: But for reals, that's a sexy stroller."

InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,healthylurker,2,Wed Jul 22 04:34:30 2015 UTC,"Feeling much better about the whole finding out our baby is a boy (thank you everyone for all the support yesterday - I appreciated it!).   I did forget to mention that a small trace of glucose showed up in my urine at the Drs office. They said it could be a sign of early GD, but they didnt seem concerned since my blood pressure was great, I didn't have a history of it in my family and everything else looked good. Still made me worried. They thought it could have been what I ate prior to the appointment (I had cereal that was a little sugary with blueberries) and a small blueberry muffin.. so I dont know. I will still be doing the glucose test at 24-26 weeks.. has anyone else had this experience? I'm nervous I'm not going back for another month."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,traveler5678,4,Tue Jul 21 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"I think the glucose is something you should follow up on before your next appointment.  I have GD and most doctors want blood sugar below 120-140 mg/dL 1 hour after eating.  My understanding is that glucose doesn't show up in your urine until your blood glucose levels are ~180 mg/dL.  GD tends to become more severe as pregnancy progresses because the placenta is producing more hormones that cause insulin resistance, which is why the test isn't usually given until 24-28 weeks.  However, it can develop earlier. The glucose in your urine this time could be a fluke, but if you do have GD, it's better to start monitoring and treatment sooner rather than later.  Can you call your doctor and ask about doing the 1 hour GTT early (you'll probably have to repeat at 24-28 weeks), or about getting a prescription for a glucose monitor and strips so that you can monitor your levels for a week or so?  Also, GD isn't necessarily accompanied by high BP and many women that develop GD don't have a family history of diabetes.  I read that ~1/3 women with PCOS develop GD during pregnancy.  ETA - I believe there are other reasons that glucose can show up in the urine but I can't remember what they are."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,septicidal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info! I appreciate it. It's always the fine line of trusting your OB office and then advocating for yourself, right? I saw the nurse practitioner and she was pretty certain there was no reason for concern at this point. I go back on August 24. Do you think it's really harmful to not do anything this next month? Is there anything over the counter I can purchase, such as strips to test? I just know my office and I think they'll say""its fine, dont worry"" which is frustrating."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,Iamagnu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"Well, if I was in your shoes, I would be proactive about this rather than wait a month.  This test could have been a fluke, but if it isn't then your blood glucose is usually fairly high for glucose to be detected in your urine.  It does sound like you ate some sugary foods prior to the test but even so, your blood glucose shouldn't be spiking that much.  It's not ideal for your little one to be exposed to higher glucose levels and the sooner GD is treated the easier it is to avoid potential complications (macrosomia, premature aging of the placenta).  Also, the little one's pancreas has to work extra hard if the mother has high blood glucose.    You can definitely purchase a meter and strips over the counter to test.  The only problem is that they can be expensive and it's possible you don't need them.  That said, my insurance didn't cover a meter and strips from the same company so I ended up buying the meter out of pocket (AccuChek Compact Plus for ~$75) so that the strips were covered by insurance.  The strips for this meter aren't very expensive out of pocket (http://www.amazon.com/Accu-Chek-Compct-Plus-SIZE/dp/B001AXPJUW).  I think there are also cheap meters and strips you can buy from WalMart, but I'm not sure how accurate they are.  Obviously be very careful about borrowing someone else's meter b/c there's blood involved.    If you just want to test on your own, let me know and I can share my testing schedule with you.  On the Babycenter Gestational Diabetes Mamas forum, there is a really informative sticky at the top of the forum as well."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,GrammaMo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"This. Because I have PCOS and insulin resistance prior to pregnancy, I did the 1-hour GTT early, failed it miserably, went on to do the 3 hour and couldn't complete it because I projectile vomited all over a bathroom after the one hour blood draw.  I've been monitoring my blood sugar 4x a day at home and had to meet with a nutritionist - I don't meet the diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes yet, but my insulin resistance has clearly gotten worse and I am following the GD diet recommendations as much as possible (which gets tricky without a functional kitchen at the moment). The earlier dietary and lifestyle adjustments can be put in place, the better.  Many women with GD can avoid further intervention until toward the end of pregnancy, when the pancreas/insulin production is under more stress."
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,kat_loves_tea,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:55 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're feeling better. :) I don't know anything about the trace of glucose...but since it sounds like the doc wasn't concerned and you're going to be tested for gd in a few weeks anyhow, it's probably nothing to worry too much about. If your urine starts smelling sweet give them a call, but otherwise try not to dwell on it too much (I know how hard that can be though!!)"
InfertilityBabies,3e2kdz,GrammaMo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about the croup and the lack of sleep.  I hate to say it, but mini-gnu actually slept fairly well last night--she went 6 hours at a stretch! This comes after many days of 3-hour stretches, so yay!  We told the original daycare that we're out. Unfortunately, they're making us pay prorated for the next month since we didn't cancel at least 30 days beforehand, and the new daycare is making us pay starting a week earlier than we are actually sending her--but we still come out way ahead money-wise in the end. The difference between the university daycare and the one we were going to use amounts to $5,000 a year, and that's not factoring in any income-based discount we might get."

InfertilityBabies,3e29o2,septicidal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:24 2015 UTC,"My OB insisted I stay on Metformin throughout pregnancy.  If you have diagnosed insulin resistance pre-pregnancy, it may help prevent or lessen the impact of gestational diabetes.  My OB is actually considering increasing my dosage in the next few weeks.  I would recommend having a bigger conversation about the Metformin, because there are other benefits beside the lowered miscarriage risk (which they don't actually understand the mechanism of, it seems to have more to do with being on Metformin for 2-3 months prior to conception rather than during the first trimester).  Sorry, I'll step off my Metformin soapbox now.  I've just been frustrated because I was told different things by different medical professionals, and finally just dove into the research I could find and determined there was possible benefit to staying on it throughout pregnancy and no possibility of harm that my OB could articulate.  I am having some blood sugar issues now but it's well below the threshold of gestational diabetes, we are just monitoring it to ensure that if it gets worse and progresses to that point, it's caught early so any effects on the baby are minimal."

I also did my own research and found a great review article discussing Metformin's effects reducing miscarriage and GD, and stayed on it the entire pregnancy - and am still on it while breastfeeding. I credit it for me not having GD and not eating everything in sight - and for a healthy Bitty Bair."
InfertilityBabies,3e29o2,cakegroove,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:56 2015 UTC,I stopped baby aspirin pretransfer - switched to Lovenox.  All the others I stopped cold turkey at 10weeks (estrogen and PIO) per doctor orders.  Once I switched to the OB/GYN they had me stop the Lovenox at 12wks due to HG with the plan of putting me on heparin around 32wks.
InfertilityBabies,3e29o2,razzertto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:59 2015 UTC,The only thing I cold turkey'd was the PIO shots. That was at week 9. I continued the prometrium suppositories but stepped it down from twice a day to once a day then to nothing. I stepped down my estrogen also to every other day then to nothing.  the last thing I weaned off of was heparin and baby aspirin. I stopped the heparin a little sooner than they asked me to because I don't think I had a clotting disorder. It was mainly a precaution since I had two m/c last year and I refused to pay the money for an RPL panel.
InfertilityBabies,3e29o2,apanda1084,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:22 2015 UTC,"They said if I was really bothered by the PIO I could stop them now at 8 weeks, so I'm considering giving it one more week.

InfertilityBabies,3e29o2,dancer331,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:10 2015 UTC,I stopped progesterone and Metformin cold turkey at 13 weeks. Metformin helped regulate my cycles and they thought I might have insulin resistance as well. The MFM I saw doesn't want you on Met after 13w bc he said its not known how much is passed onto the baby or how it's sugar levels are affected. So far I've had no problems at all. Met in the first trimester is supposed to lower your chance of miscarriage if you have PCOS (which I do also). Hope this helps!

I get being disappointed, but I find it helpful to remind myself that no one is having the exact ""average"" boy or girl. So even if boys, on average, are more active there's nothing saying that your boy will be active. He could be a sensitive bookworm. Or your daughter could have been a rough and tumble type who wanted nothing to do with dress up and play dates.  We had our check up with the maternal/fetal specialist this morning. Both boys are doing great--wiggling like crazy and 2lbs 5oz each, so staying on trend for being a little bit bigger than average. No cervical check, apparently after 24 weeks they don't want to disturb the cervix without cause and just being on bed rest is not enough cause. Fair enough. : ) We did get some better profile pictures though, since Baby B was NOT cooperating at their anatomy scan last month, so that was nice."

Diphenhydramine is considered very safe for pregnancy. It was on my list of approved meds given by my RE so I feel perfectly safe taking them. Each pill is 25 mg so I take 1 or 2 before bed and sleep like a log. Otherwise I get shit sleep like you."

InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,vibeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I used to be able to sleep anywhere, anytime, with no problem. Not sleeping isn't an option since I have to work and don't function well on lack of sleep. I think you will feel much better once you give it a shot. Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,WhateverYouSay1084,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"I take Unisom, which has the same active ingredient. I'm not drowsy but I might be used to it by now. It does put me right to sleep. I had insomnia prior to pregnancy too. My doc said I could go back to taking ambien but I'm hesitant."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,Marie197,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:51 2015 UTC,Good to know.  I will try Benedryl first but if it doesn't work I'll get Unisom.  Thank you for the tip.  I'm pretty miserable...
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,vibeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"I have been taking Benadryl to help with cold symptoms (since actual cold medicine isn't good) and if my allergies ever go into asshole mode right before bed. It's totally safe from everything I have read and has helped so much with the two colds I have had this pregnancy, without sleep I would have been sick for much longer."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,revangelfire,3,Mon Jul 20 21:56:37 2015 UTC,I'm stopping at the pharmacy on the way home from work.  I'm looking forward to some sleep.
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,vibeee,3,Mon Jul 20 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad. I think gender disappointment is/can be normal. I didn't even want a girl that badly, and I still almost cried during the scan and felt sad for a few days after. I just felt like u didn't know what to do with and how to relate to a boy. But especially now, after Finn was born, I couldn't imagine not having a boy. He's just so wonderful and I'm madly in love. Didn't spend another sad thought about not having a girl once!   Speaking of which, he started giving kisses this weekend. Or more whole-face-slobbery-smooches. He'll grab my face with both of his little chubby hands, pull me close, and smush his face into my cheek, with his mouth open. My heart about exploded in a bazillion pieces."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,hamandcheez,2,Mon Jul 20 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"When I worked at a preschool, all of my favorite babies were boys and it was because of what you just described -- they are so sweet and loving and just want to smooch on you and give hugs all day. For some reason the girl babies seemed much more independent."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,WhateverYouSay1084,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:11 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I definitely can understand where you're coming from with the disappointment, it's ok to feel that way when reality isn't matching up with your dreams. Absolutely natural. We all know you are grateful and love your boy lots but reframing your dreams can take a little while. Give yourself time and I'm sure you'll be excited!  Going on day 5 with my mom. Love her lots but she does so many things that annoy me and I'm finding pregnant me gets annoyed easier. She talks to my belly (in a baby tone) and I find it so annoying. I don't mind when my husband does it but find it really gets under my skin when she does it. That's just really the tip of the awkward annoying iceberg but I need to drop it. Hope that going to lunch will provide enough distractions."

InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,MrsDragon,3,Mon Jul 20 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad. I had gender disappointment too.  We both wanted a little girl but found out that we were transferring a boy embryo.  But I have to say, my little toddler is amazing.  Boys love their moms and you'll save a bunch of money on clothes.  I'm done having kids so no girls for me.  :("
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,curiouslywanting,3,Mon Jul 20 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"It's ok to feel disappointed even though you're grateful to be pregnant at all, seriously.  I will tell you that my little boy is the sweeter of my two twins.  Every time he hears my voice or sees my face, he turns to me and smiles for Mommy.  It absolutely melts my heart.  I think we may be starting the 4 month sleep regression.....they are still sleeping through the night, but naps are becoming a bit more disjointed as they consolidate their sleep.  I am having a hard time finding the balance between being strict with nap environment (which means they get great sleep but I'm tethered to the house) and more flexible (more fractured sleep but I'm doing things - baby classes and play dates and such).  Peeps who've been there...... What did you do?"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,yearofthecat,3,Mon Jul 20 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"Second comment to update on boys and myself.  Sebastian is doing great. He's in an open crib, down to 1L on the nasal cannula, and taking 4 bottle feeds a day. Today one of his ""bottle feeds"" was at the boob. He went to town! He's gaining weight like a little piggy and we love it. He has the occasional episode of apnea with bradycardia, but by the time the nurse silences the alarm he's already recovered on his own.  At this rate he will be the first one to come home.   Asher isn't doing poorly, he's just taking his time. He was in a crib for a couple of days but couldn't stay warm so he went back in the isolette yesterday evening. He's also been having a lot more apnea/Brady episodes; they'll happen in clusters, meaning he'll go down, recover a bit, go down, recover a bit, etc. He's still on 3L nasal cannula because of his trouble breathing. He's taking the bottle like a champ though, and he's up to 3 bottle feeds a day & gaining weight well also. Nursing him has gone a little slower but I'm hopeful tomorrow will be a good day!   We've got everything set up and ready for them to come home!  Hopefully just another 2 or 3 weeks and both boys will be home :)  I'm just tired because this is all emotionally and physically exhausting, but I can't imagine it's any more exhausting than having two newborns at home so I'm not complaining too much yet!  My apologies for any typos as I typed this on my phone while pumping!"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,spankyjubblies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:21 2015 UTC,Way to go boys!
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,MrsDragon,4,Tue Jul 21 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"Gender disappointment is far more common than people talk about. You are far from a horrible person. It won't take you very long at all to love the idea of having a boy. Boys are amazing! They are sweet and kind and you get to play in the dirt! You can still play dress up and have tea parties they just might look a little different than you envisioned. Major bonus, you can wipe any which way you choose when cleaning up dirty diapers! My husband is so loving and kind to his mother and I can't wait to have that relationship with my boys. Congratulations!"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,LowOnHope,3,Mon Jul 20 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"I was convinced through my first trimester that I wanted a girl. So at our 14 week 3D scan I was really afraid of having gender disappointment and ruining the experience for myself (seeing as how this may be our only one). Fortunately I was happy either way, but for husband it took some getting used to, because he also really wanted a girl. Sometimes I see super cute girl outfits and am disappointed I won't get to dress my baby in them...but I remind myself how lucky we are to even be in the position to be preparing for a baby at all, and it usually goes away. It's still in the back of my mind though -- ""Well, maybe #2 will be a girl..."" And I know several other women who cried when they found out they were having boys, but when those little boys arrived, and they saw those little faces, they couldn't imagine having anything else. You aren't a bad mom for having a preference, and you will love that little boy more than you can imagine once he's here and more ""real""."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Mon Jul 20 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"See I'm hoping for a boy as I'm not a girly girl and have many more guy friends than gal pals.  Plus most of my primary activities are more in the ""boy realm"" tho happy to report that the number of ladies attending gaming conventions are going up so that might not even be an issue once our little ones are ""of age"".    We decided to not find out at the anatomy scan but that's more for fear of the explosion of pink or blue that could follow.  While my in-laws are very gender role neutral that is not the case with my family and I can only imagine the purchases that would follow.  Nice and neutral and non-frilly (can you tell I really don't know what to do with a girl?!?) :-D"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,jaina_jade,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"We didn't find out until Isaac was born. We were both kinds hoping for a girl... But now I can't imagine having anyone else but him. I will admit that i do still hope we'll have another, and that baby 2 is a girl. What you're feeling is so normal. Congrats on the great scan though! And on your baby boy!  Nice Monday here. My sister and Isaac had a great time while I was at some appointments, including a training session at the gym. I crushed my workout - awww yeah!  Now my sister is it getting my dogs' nails trimmed, and I just spent 40 minutes getting Isaac to take a nap. So frustrating. Although now I get baby snuggles, so... Worth it!"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I feel like I might have some mixed feelings when it's gender time which is why I'm going to find out before we reveal anything and can have my own private reaction. Today I was told I can stop estrogen patches and one of the pills so yay, but still on the PIO and crinone. Can't wait for those to be over with."

And honestly, I would have felt that kind of disappointment/fear if I had been told I was having a girl. I think it is totally normal and it's why I had to find out the sex, because now you have time to process it and accept it. You'll get there and you'll love that little man to bits."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,ReindeerPoopRVA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on having a normal anatomy scan!    Today is day 2 of 5 of insane heat here in NY.  Yesterday was in the low 90's, today will be 95, tomorrow will still be in the 90's and it will drop to high 80's by Thursday.  I am officially on lockdown with baby for the rest of the week in the AC, unless it cools down in the evening.  My electric bill is going to be out of control.  Edit because math hurts"

I am so anxious to see what our electricity bills look like for this year... We have electric heat.  Plus window AC units, which we normally only keep one on during the day for the cats, but since the contractor is installing cabinets the downstairs one is on all day too.  And we have to keep the heat up in the winter once we have a baby to keep the baby warm (usually we keep it pretty chilly and wear sweaters/layers to save money in the winter)."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"We dont have to pay for heat thankfully, however we have window ACs.  We were very spoiled in our old building in regards to AC, because the building itself had been kept cool and the cool air would get into the apt.  But now we live in a prewar, meaning that its a brick building, thick concrete walls, etc (I love the aesthetic actually), but it makes for brutal summers.  I just wish the temp would drop down to the mid 80's so I can at least get out safely."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,SJP8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:17 2015 UTC,Same. I live in the Philly area and it is hot as Hades here. I'm working from home today and my husband came home early to watch K while I go to a doctor's appt later. There is no way I want him out in this heat! I am also worried about our electric bill!!
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,nfgchick79,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:42 2015 UTC,"I felt a little shocked because I had two anatomy scans and at the first one they said the baby was ""probably"" a girl (they couldn't get a clear look between the legs) and at the repeat scan, we are very obviously having a boy!  So I had mentally begun to adjust to the idea of having a girl, and got thrown for a bit of a loop.  I knew the initial scan results weren't definite because they couldn't get a perfect view, but it was still disorienting to be told girl one week and boy one and a half weeks later.  Also my mother had the audacity to relay (through my father, who should know better than to repeat her bullshit) that she was disappointed she wasn't getting a granddaughter.  Like, thanks for being disappointed in my child before he's even born.  All because you have some dream of buying frilly baby girl dresses or something.  Anyway... My new kitchen cabinets are starting to go in today! Hooray! Hopefully they will be in place enough to have someone come out to give us a quote for countertops on Wednesday night, but if not I'll have to reschedule the countertop person for Thursday.  I'll see how much progress gets made today before I reschedule.  In other news, my family is being kind of ridiculous about my grandmother's furniture.  She's being moved to an assisted living facility today, and can't bring her furniture with her.  The whole thing has been a gigantic game of telephone because my mother is only talking about it with her younger sister, who is getting information from their older sister, and then my mom and dad are relaying information to my sister and me... It's a mess.  I finally called my mother's older sister directly last week, because she's the one dealing with everything, but my mother is still the primary person dealing with my sister.  It's just... Exemplifying everything frustrating with my family.  Everything could be so easily resolved if my mother just re-learned how to use email and sent an email with my aunt's contact info and the list of stuff they are trying to re-home.  But nope, not happening.  Why make anything simple when it can instead be a clusterfuck of miscommunication?"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"can't wait to see pictures of your new kitchen!    Your family drama is causing flashbacks to when my Grandfather went in to a home.  It was the same insane telephone game with certain people not speaking to others and constantly feeling like a monkey in the middle. Is an excel sheet an option, one that aunt could fill out and you could then print for mom?"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,jaina_jade,2,Mon Jul 20 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"THE CABINETS ARE IN. Well, the contractor is still putting in filler bits, etc. and the doors aren't on, but there are CABINETS in my kitchen! I am so incredibly excited."

InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,jaina_jade,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"Part of the issue is that the primary person dealing with everything is not very tech-savvy.  The aunt that is tech-savvy lives several states away and isn't directly handling everything.  And my mother has mental health issues, so nothing is really going to make anything involving her that much easier.  My mother is currently making all sorts of excuses for why she can't email (my aunts will both use email, just not as obsessively as the younger generations) which I think is part of the issue.  I think my dad is attempting to stay out of it which isn't helping anything - at least he uses email."

Uh, what? I love it when people make comments like that. EWhat exactly does she expect you to do about it?  HOORAY on getting the cabinets installed today! :D  Not that you want to take on the task, but is there someone who can (even verbally) give you a master list and you could send the email? Family stuff is tough and people go a little crazy when it comes to moving elders to be more dependent.  Edit: Because cabinets are not equal to counters, even if they both start with 'c'."
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:49 2015 UTC,Apparently after all the back and forth my dad decided it would be too expensive to ship furniture so there was zero point in my sister trying to take anything. So... Yeah. Logic is not strong in my family.

InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:23 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the good scan!  And I agree that gender disappointment is totally normal.  I originally wanted a boy, but then I found out Mr. Z wanted a girl.  So then I was totally on board with having a girl, of course.  And we ended up with a little boy.  A beautiful, perfect, darling, amazing, wonderful baby boy.  I am so delighted by everything about him that I truly don't miss the little girl I'm not going to have.  Speaking of that darling boy Zed, he's got his first baby cold!  It's so pitiful, and yet so cute, and I'm just glad I'm not worried about him.  He's sneezing a lot of snot out, and I've tried the NoseFrida but he is NOT a fan.  Right now he's taking a really long babynap.  I put him down at 9:10 and he's still asleep.  Poor guy!  He didn't nap at all well yesterday, so I'm going to let him sleep as long as he can, especially since I'll have to bundle him into the car so I can run a quick errand (need to drop off some things at the post office).  I expect he'll have a pretty good day other than occasional sneezes.  His dad and I are feeling much better this morning, so hopefully he'll be all better soon, too!  In babywearing news, I just picked up the most AMAZING wrap.  I was not expecting to ever run across it, so I pounced.  It's Natibaby Circuits, and yes, it does look that amazing IRL.  I can't wait to get it.  :)"
InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,Zoraptera,2,Mon Jul 20 18:27:03 2015 UTC,Does Zed love baths?  That's when I NoseFrida mine since they are relaxed and happy (otherwise they haaaate it lol).  Bonus is that the warm water seems to loosen stubborn boogers.

It worries me somehow that if I have a boy first it could turn out the same way...even though it's not totally logical.   My anatomy scan is Wednesday so I'm nervous and excited about that! I had a dentist appointment today and have another tomorrow so I guess that will be my distraction til then."

InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,female_engineer_here,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yay for a good scan!   I also was shocked and disappointed when we found out we were having a boy. You can see by these replies that it is super common. I would never have admitted it to anyone IRL.   I had expected a girl as my sister and two cousins all had girls this year. It didn't take me long to get over myself and be excited about a boy but I am still nervous about raising one as I do not know much about taking care of boy parts. There are some totally adorable boy clothes out there and I can't wait to make my little guy into a mini version of his dad. :P  Also I was super worried about telling my MIL as she so desperately wanted a granddaughter as she had two boys. But she took it very well and I think after some adjustment is also very excited to have a grandson. What matters most is that I have a healthy child!  Edit: As for me, I am nearly over this stupid cold and back at work. Also I just wanted to say I love our portable air conditioner.

InfertilityBabies,3dy4eo,revangelfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:36 2015 UTC,When we got our PGS results on our 4 viable embryos we had three boys and one girl. It was a sad moment for me because I was very worried our only girl might not make it if we transferred her first. My husband and I agreed we would try a boy first since we had three and if the first try didn't work we would have two backup boys still - we might go with our girl next time and then remaining boys for next times after that. At this point in time I'm happy we are having a boy because I feel like we still have our girl waiting for us a couple years from now but if our next transfer doesn't work and we lose that girl one day I will be devastated.

I want to start treatments again soon and I want a little girl soooo bad. I know I'll be ecstatic for another baby but I have dreams of a little girl too."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,TigFan15,9,Sun Jul 19 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"Hugs to you!  I'm so sorry about the loss of your sweet cat.  I actually did some research into this myself while pregnant, and there is absolutely no conclusive evidence out there that grief by itself will affect the baby as long as you continue to take care of yourself (eating properly, attending prenatal appointments, getting enough sleep).  Take the time to grieve and don't worry that your grief will affect your baby girl!  Grief is a normal part of human existence, and if women needed to be happy their entire pregnancy to have a health and well-adjusted baby - well, there would be maybe 100 healthy and well-adjusted people in the whole world."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,traveler5678,2,Sun Jul 19 23:19:04 2015 UTC,ETA - I should add that enough sleep is relative - lots of pregnant women have trouble sleeping their entire pregnancy.
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,traveler5678,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:24:49 2015 UTC,Thank you.  This really helped me let go and give out a few good cries over the last 24 hours.  I really appreciate it.
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,RositaYouBitch,8,Mon Jul 20 22:35:06 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry dear. We had to let our kitty Charlie go when I was 35 weeks pregnant due to kidney failure. I was a mess. We only had a week with him from diagnosis to the day we put him to sleep and I was extremely stressed the whole time. I wasn't sleeping or eating right. I tried my best and I did make sure I was still drinking all my water. My boy was born healthy just 3 weeks later. I think your little one will be ok. There's something to be said for letting yourself cry and release your feelings too. Stifling them isn't a good thing. If you're really having trouble there is no shame in speaking with a counselor too. All of us have a lot of complicated infertility emotions tied up in our pets since they became surrogate children in a lot of ways. Take care.
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,RositaYouBitch,2,Mon Jul 20 00:13:29 2015 UTC,Thank you - I'm gulping as much water as possible.  I really appreciate the kind words.
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,Puppiesandcupcakes,2,Mon Jul 20 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"She was beautiful. Your story reminds me so much of my Charlie. We got him when he was just a tiny baby and he was my little shadow. He was my comfort through all of our infertility struggles and I was so looking forward to him meeting our little boy. I was devastated to lose him so close to my son's birth.it's been 3 months and I still get sad about it, but I hope it comforts you to know that we're doing ok now. The birth of your child fills some of the void and it is certainly a distraction. Eventually you'll remember the good things and not so much the pain at the end. Take care. Fay was lucky to have found you.   ETA: Char played fetch too! Kitty-puppies are the best!"
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,Puppiesandcupcakes,6,Tue Jul 21 02:03:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this will help at all but I loved the comment /u/RositaYouBitch made regarding the emotions we have in our pets as surrogate children and it made me think.  What if Fay's purpose in life was to bring you, her favorite person, comfort and healing during this whole draining fertility drama?  And now that you are pregnant she's able to let go since her purpose has been fulfilled.  Something to think about :)."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:15 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this a lot today.  I won't lie, it's made me start crying on more then one occasion, now being another one.  I love this thought.  It's very comforting.  She was such an amazing first daughter for me and I just love the idea that she filled her purpose.  Thank you."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 20 22:36:53 2015 UTC,Well that just made me tear up!! You are so welcome.  And in a couple months you can tell your little one all about sweet Fay and the amazing memories y'all shared <3.  Much love to you!
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,messofletters,4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"I am so, so sorry. Losing a pet is so hard.  For the grief, I only have an anecdote - when she was very newly pregnant, my aunt ( and entire family) suffered an incredibly devastating loss. The details aren't important - what is is that the baby she was pregnant with, my cousin, is just fine. Let yourself feel your feelings, sweetie - Fay deserves for you to grieve her, and I believe that that's they only way to get to a peaceful place, anyways.  Maybe telling us more about her will help you feel better? Lots of pet lovers here - I'm sure we'd all love to hear more about your sweet girl when you want to share.  So many hugs."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:54 2015 UTC,Thank you - I added some things about her in the edit above.  I really appreciate everything you said.
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 20 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"Oh man, thanks for sharing - Fay DOES sound like pretty much the best cat ever! She actually is QUITE like our big grey furry guy, Magellan, who has also been known to play fetch! We call him ""puppy kitty"" - hooray for cats who are like dogs!  Good call taking some time off of work."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,mrswhiskerson,4,Tue Jul 21 01:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. It's the hardest thing, letting a pet go.  We had to put Atticus down when I was 36 weeks pregnant. We had about 1 month from diagnosis to putting him down. Unfortunately stress was a contributing factor to his health issue, so moving to a new house, introducing a new family member, and driving back and forth to the pet hospital was probably going to aggravate it more.   I still cry about it. We put him down at the end of February. He was our first baby, and he got me through all of the infertility crap. Cuddled me on the bathroom floor while I cried through each miscarriage.   You can feel all the overwhelming feelings that come with grief and your baby will be fine. Just try to take as best care of yourself as you can (I know that's easier said than done). And like /u/RositaYouBitch said, don't be afraid to reach out for counselling if you need it.   Feel free to PM me if you need to just let it out. I'll listen <3"
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,revangelfire,2,Mon Jul 20 04:19:15 2015 UTC,Thank you - this is very kind.  I'm sorry about your Atticus.  Going into premature labor is actually my biggest worry but I'm still letting myself be sad.  I appreciate the kind words.
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,cakegroove,3,Mon Jul 20 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"We lost our beloved Milkshakes a couple months ago. After a decade together, her unending sweetness and support during every trial and tribulation of our fertility journey, she had a very aggressive kidney cancer that took her just a bit over a month from diagnosis. Losing a fur-baby can be so gut wrenchingly sad and emotional and feeling those feelings is important for the healing. I think as long as you continue to care for yourself and baby, you'll be ok. I still get sad and miss her terribly but I'm thankful her suffering is over and that we had such a fulfilling time together. I hope you are able to find peace in your heart about it some day."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jul 20 11:58:48 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry about your Milkshakes.  Thank you for the kind words.
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,MrsDragon,4,Mon Jul 20 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"You need to vent your emotions however works for you.  As long as you are taking care of yourself (eating properly, getting as much sleep as you can, etc.) the baby will be fine.  I am so, so sorry for your loss.  I feel like a lot of people don't understand the huge places in our hearts that our furry companions occupy, and the holes they leave behind when they are gone.  My cat has been sickly (horrible recurring eye infections) since January and I am terrified that something will compromise his health to the point where we have to put him down.  He is such a lovebug and was my closest companion through a very difficult time in my life."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,logisticaladventure,2,Mon Jul 20 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so so sooo very sorry Tig! I don't know an answer to your question but I do understand your immense grief and my heart breaks for you! You'll be in my thoughts. The next few months will be very hard, but as time goes on the grief will become softer, but I know you'll miss her forever. (hugs)"

InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,magical_realist,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:37 2015 UTC,"Others have already given great advice and I can't add much. Just wanted to say I am sorry for your loss. I had to put down my darling little cat about a year ago and we had only a couple of days between diagnoses and putting her down (kidney failure, we thought she was slowing down due to her old age and arthritis but it was kidney issues). It was incredibly hard and it broke my heart. Grieve all you want hun and don't stress about hurting your baby, just do your best to stay healthy otherwise."
InfertilityBabies,3dvsn5,hopefaithandlove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:27:59 2015 UTC,I'm sorry about your kitty.  Thank you for the kind words.  We were lucky to have the extra time with her but watching her go downhill was very hard.  She was a great cat.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,GrammaMo,9,Sun Jul 19 12:44:52 2015 UTC,"We are home!  I'm working on a birth story, but right now, just enjoying being in my own home, with my new family.  Having some (minor!) complications, which should work themselves out, it just  makes it very hard to get around easily/on my own.  Babes are both sleeping right now as my husband is washing out the bottle sterilizer.  We might have to go right to formula, because as of Day 4, still no milk and I'm already bleeding despite LC/nurse help on figuring out a good latch. Totally cool with that, as we were supplementing in the hospital, and they were discharged having only lost about 3%!  Have to make an appointment this week to go back to my OB (problem previously mentioned) and their first ped appointment.  Gah, 10 months and this still isn't real!  So far this weekend, I've caught my very passive (but adoring) husband doing with our children: singing Imagine Dragons as lullaby, taking selfies with them, and getting grumpy that I offered E her bottle because ""I already got to sit with her and breastfeed"""
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,dutchqueen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:24 2015 UTC,I hope your complications are not serious and that you heal quickly!  It is very real!  You are a mom to two beautiful kids!

InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,PrincessCBHammock,14,Sun Jul 19 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"I think that is a healthy response, history of IF or not. For me modern baby showers represent this lovely idea (a community coming together to help celebrate and support a new family) completely perverted by consumerism, performing, and pinterest-inspired competition. You know what new parents don't need? A million brand-new cute onesies. Not even a top-of-the-line travel system. If we, as a society or as smaller communities actually gave a shit about how new families fare, we would be screaming for sane parental leave, affordable child care, accessible healthy food (maybe even prepared or processed food that's not total shit, since so many families need to have all adults working), and public spaces beyond parks that are welcoming to young kids.   That's my rant. If baby showers were more about loving and supporting one another and less about buying shit I'd be into it."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,lancealittle,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:23 2015 UTC,Got it in one.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 19 16:13:58 2015 UTC,"100% agree.  Also those policy ideas would help all parents, not just women (at least around here, men thankfully don't get invited to showers) or disproportionaly first-time parents.  But I fear it's not to be anytime soon."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,jos9143,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"Oooooh my goodness, yes, I feel so bad for parents in the US - maternity leave is bad enough, and dads really get the shaft."

I think people weren't sure how big they'd be and held off.  And the ones who did buy clothing made sure say that that bought something bigger anyways because after 0-6 months, babies never have clothing lol"
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,dutchqueen,0,Sun Jul 19 20:58:32 2015 UTC,That's why I wanted a blessing way but everyone said it was not PC. Wahwahwahhhh
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"Eh, you can have an awesome get-together with friends where people share stories, kid's books, sign up to make you meals after delivery, and generally celebrate how awesome your growing family is and call it whatever you want. I had a friend ask everyone to bring a bead she could string and use to help her during labor. There are really sweet ways to make a ""shower"" work, we just need a better name for it!"
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,lancealittle,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:26 2015 UTC,I hope it turns out better than you expect.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,3,Sun Jul 19 16:13:26 2015 UTC,It was OK. The food was not good but the cake was!
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sun Jul 19 18:10:01 2015 UTC,The food was the only reason I tolerated my own baby shower.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,messofletters,2,Sun Jul 19 18:46:39 2015 UTC,I know! I hated mine. Blah showers.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,PrincessCBHammock,3,Sun Jul 19 20:23:32 2015 UTC,I wasn't happy with the cakes I made yesterday (they look suspiciously dense) so I decided to try out a different recipe this morning since M woke me up at 6 am and then fell back asleep. I left her on one side of the bed (we have a bedrail set up) with my husband on the other side. I kept checking on them while doing dishes and baking and every time I peeked in the room they had moved a little closer to each other. M is now lying on her side facing him and he's facing her with his hand on the top of her head. It is the sweetest thing in the world. My heart just melts looking at them <3
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,TigFan15,2,Sun Jul 19 12:49:24 2015 UTC,That's such a sweet image!!

I love that man!"

Of course, I was wide awake at 3:30 but hopefully this trend will continue! We followed up that success with a poop mess though. He decided to let it all go in the 4 seconds between the removal of one diaper and placement of a new one. Lol."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:58 2015 UTC,"Oh man.. I remember the days of poop explosions and illicit peeing. We still keep a chux pad on the changing pad, just in case. We also use them to lay down on public diaper changing surfaces. Congrats on the quiet night!! Hope there are many more!"

InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,RositaYouBitch,3,Sun Jul 19 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"Yes! He's like a little person now, not just a little lump of cuteness!"
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,Iamagnu,3,Sun Jul 19 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"It is just wild how she's growing! She is so vocal now and so responsive! She smiles and laughs and makes all sort of wonderful baby sounds. When I sing to her she starts going ""Ooooo, ga-goooo!"" along with me, it's just amazing."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,Iamagnu,3,Sun Jul 19 15:37:16 2015 UTC,The little sounds are the best. Even his hungry cry is getting more pathetic because it has more to it than just crying. He's adding inflection or something. It's heartbreaking but also hilarious.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,Hopecat,3,Sun Jul 19 15:45:50 2015 UTC,Yep! I'm convinced M just experiments with different crying sounds because she's bored. And sometimes when she's crying because she's tired she'll do that lower lip jutting out thing and it is the more adorable sad face haha
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,Iamagnu,3,Sun Jul 19 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my munchkin keeps doing ""eh!"" and ""heh!"" She used to hate diaper changes and now she digs them because we can ""talk"" together throughout."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,Semirelatednonsense,2,Sun Jul 19 16:55:42 2015 UTC,That sounds so cute! I made up a diaper change song the other day (side-effect of being childcare worker is constant spontaneous songs) and M thought it was too funny. Such an improvement from when she screamed and fought every diaper change.

They only contain their birth certificates (non official footprint kind) and their birth announcement so far... But it's a start, which was a goal of mine!  It's supposed to be close to 100 degrees today, so we'll be hiding out inside. But I started the day by sleeping in, while daddy took care of the kids (I did it for him yesterday!) so I've got that going for me!"
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,Semirelatednonsense,2,Sun Jul 19 16:46:07 2015 UTC,Hooray for baby book! I started mini's scrapbook Thursday. I haven't scrapbooked in ages.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,3,Sun Jul 19 17:12:42 2015 UTC,Is it normal to feel so damn winded and like my heart might blow up this early on in pregnancy? I can hardly get up the stairs without feeling like I'm out of breath and ran a marathon.   Maybe I'm just out of shape in general? I don't know. It blows.
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,serendipity37,2,Sun Jul 19 17:57:56 2015 UTC,It's usually just your increasing blood volume. First couple of weeks stairs killed me!

InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,nfgchick79,2,Sun Jul 19 19:02:33 2015 UTC,Our heat index is supposed to be in the 100s today with an excessive heat warning. I was going to take K to the pool today but I am unsure about the idea now after walking a few hundred feet outside!
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,kat_loves_tea,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:17 2015 UTC,"Oh it definitely feels over a hundred outside today. We considered pool time but I'm just not sure. Also, the number of hot mom's I'm bikinis at our neighborhood pool make my soul hurt. They'll have a toddler and a tiny baby in tow and still have slammin' bodies. I just wanna slouch in my dress/cover-up far away from them."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,nfgchick79,2,Sun Jul 19 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah we decided against the pool. Man, I would jump off a cliff if our pool was like that! Ugh! My neighborhood is full of a mix of moms and most have what I would call ""normal"" (I say ""normal"" because there is no normal) bodies. I bought a tankini and the bottoms have like a little skirt thing. I feel ""okay"" in it but not great. I say fuck it though because seeing him enjoy himself in the pool makes me (almost) forget what my body looks like."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,kat_loves_tea,2,Sun Jul 19 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"I think we're against it too today. Too much housework and we had a HUGE brunch so we're all sluggish. I'm already in stretchy pants and doing a Korean skincare mask on the couch lol. I have decided though that I need to go get new flip flops after she wakes up from her nap. Exciting!    Oh yeah, the neighborhood pool is quite the affair. Lots of displaying of domestic and family perfection. Good thing my kid is cute enough to fit in lol. And I'm kind of in love with her floppy beach hat. Did you see it on FB last time?"
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"Your day sounds nice :) We had breakfast with my parents. My husband watched K while I grocery shopped. I tried a 3rd stage baby food with him a bit ago and he threw it up everywhere so that was fun :/ We've mostly been hiding in the A/C'd house! I thought I was going to melt grocery shopping!  Aw yes, I did see the hat! It is super adorable! I'm so glad my neighborhood is pretty down to earth. I'm certain though that the surrounding communities are just as you described (I'm in a middle class development surrounded by er, some upper class peeps)."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"What kinds of stuff is stage 3? We mostly did fruit and veggie purée with some finely chopped meat mixed in. Or I'd make a veggie soup (like carrots, broccoli, onions, and potatoes in chicken stock) and kind of partially mash the veggies and then do just fruit purée for a separate meal. Then slowly phased out those for more whole steamed veggies with a side of meat. For instance she'll have half a salmon burger patty all cut up with a side of peas and carrots for dinner and an applesauce pouch for dessert. Oh, at K's age she LOVED the Ella's Kitchen baby biscuits and the cookies from Target. They're great for teething, have no added sugar, and they make her face smell like gingerbread. The nibbly fingers and toddler cookies have been a huge favorite since she was like 10-11 months (we started them a bit early but she was super ready.)"
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"The food we gave him tonight had carrots, corn and squash. There were tiny chunks of carrot and corn. It was still a puree though. He kept gagging on the chunks. He ate some of it and then out of nowhere, PUKE! That was a big nope. He has two teeth and two more coming in so I thought it would be okay. The packaging said 7+ months and the other one I bought said 8+ months. He'll be 9 months on the 29th.   Thanks for the cookie suggestion! I'm having trouble finding snacks because a lot have yogurt and he has a milk protein allergy. He is not a fan of puffs yet."
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,kat_loves_tea,2,Sun Jul 19 21:31:03 2015 UTC,The plum organics brand teething crackers are also good. They're a bit messy but they're wafers made of the same stuff as the puffs. Good luck!

InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,female_engineer_here,2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:17 2015 UTC,We are finally getting together with some friends of our today. The last time we were supposed to get together was the day I had to be induced. Lol. I sent her a text at 9:00am (just after my water broke) saying I wasn't able to hang out because something came up. Ha ha. I am so excited for them to meet Nicky and to see them!!  Night time is getting so much better!! I'm actually sleeping through part of the night while he makes his strange little noises. Lol. Yesterday my husband and I were still in bed at 8:30am and snuggled... We haven't  done that in over a month! It was delightful :)
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,vibeee,2,Sun Jul 19 16:23:38 2015 UTC,"Baby SJP is 1 month old!  She decided to give me A FULL NIGHT OF SLEEP as a gift (I heard her make a few noises then go back to sleep quickly, so I didn't wake her up fully).  Unfortunately, my boobs were incredibly engored and felt like bricks in the AM. Ao I pull out my medela manual pump and there's no suction!  After much troubleshooting, we realize there's a problem with the o-ring...a teeny tiny overlooked part on the pump that can render the pump useless if lost or damaged.  And of course, Medela's customer service line is closed on Sunday.  The bright side of all this, is that I got to use my Spectra pump and it's sooo comfortable! I hope I can fix my manual pump asap, because its so useful at night.    Today we are going to see my extended family at my mom's, hopefully will be fun.  It will be over 90 degrees so I'm going to enjoy the AC there."

InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,vibeee,2,Sun Jul 19 17:13:43 2015 UTC,One nice thing about bed rest is that I'm pretty impervious to the weather outside! It's apparently 100+ degrees and humid or something?   Today is the last day my friend from CA is here and she is knocking out projects for the nursery (because she is awesome!) Tonight is breakfast for dinner and crafts. : )
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 19 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"I'm 8+1 today. I think my nausea is getting better then I move and start gagging. I'm slowly working on cleaning today. I've done a load of laundry, on the second load of dishes. Swept, mopped, cleaned out the fridge and I'm about to tidy the bathroom. I just have to take breaks because all the movement makes me so sick.  We have our next ultrasound on Tuesday. I'm so excited.

Tonight my mother has invited herself and her two old lady friends to our house for dinner...so I guess we're having them over for dinner.  Which means I guess I should clean, and clean to old lady standards (which are much more intense than mine!)"
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,pamplemousse2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:28 2015 UTC,Should I add spare Medela pump parts when I finish up my registery(discount)?  I am going to use Spectra and hack it with Medela parts.  Is there something I need for sure that wears off?  What parts do I need to order?
InfertilityBabies,3dtwz7,try_new_stuff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good idea. You'll need spare membranes (which usually come with valves) like this: http://www.amazon.com/Medela-87088-Spare-Membranes/dp/B0001CTZ8K/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1437355360&sr=8-8&keywords=medela+parts or http://www.amazon.com/Medela-87089-NEW-Valve-Membrane-Kit/dp/B00DVP7JEQ/ref=sr_1_77?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1437355793&sr=1-77&refinements=p_4%3AMedela.  Where are you registered?   You'll also need tubing (I guess spare might be useful), the connectors, and the flanges. See the examples in this kit: http://www.amazon.com/Breastpump-Membranes-Breastshields-Personalfit-Breastshield/dp/B00D2NCE3S/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&qid=1437355360&sr=8-18-spons&keywords=medela+parts Usually the standard 24mm flanges come with, and then you can buy bigger or smaller ones depending on your nipples.  I also suggest registering for some breast milk storage bags and some steam clean bags http://www.amazon.com/Medela-Quick-Clean-Micro-Steam-Bags/dp/B00S0U5X18/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437355650&sr=8-1&keywords=medela+steam+bags which is what we use rather than a whole microwave steamer thing."

InfertilityBabies,3drg76,revangelfire,3,Sat Jul 18 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad the trip went well! One of my twins had a marginal cord insertion, I delivered early, but it was due to preterm labor not any growth issue. The twin with marginal cord insertion was within two ounces of his normal cord insertion brother."
InfertilityBabies,3drg76,erinrae0814,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:15:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Interesting, well it seems like the more stories I read about marginal insertion the more I hear about how it didn't affect the baby at all. I hope the same will hold true for my little guy."

But still, excited to have this recipe in my arsenal!"
InfertilityBabies,3dqrt1,GrammaMo,2,Sat Jul 18 20:49:29 2015 UTC,How do you make Swiss meringue buttercream vegan? The main ingredients are egg whites and butter!
InfertilityBabies,3dqrt1,GrammaMo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:18:26 2015 UTC,Through the magic of chickpea water! I've also managed to make meringues with it too! Indistinguishable from the egg-based ones.  I used this recipe for the buttercream and it turned out amazing. Earth Balance is way more like butter than margarine so the frosting still has really good flavour and texture.

InfertilityBabies,3dqrt1,TigFan15,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:30:12 2015 UTC,We've actually started trying out the natural breastfeeding position. He kinda thinks it's a game so he feeds for a bit then props himself up on his elbows and smiles. Then smothers himself in boob again. Repeat as desired.  Maybe it'll be different when he's sleepy!
InfertilityBabies,3dqrt1,Blankety_blanks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"That sounds super cute! But not great for 2am, so hopefully it'll be different then.

The cloth diaper service people are coming over in a bit to discuss their starter pack/system/etc and then I have a whole wild afternoon of open!  I'll probably work on stuffies for The Beans, read a bit, and work on thank you cards for our shower. At some point I want to do some crafts with my friend who is in town helping us (and is currently finishing some woodworking nursery projects for me because she is awesome!) Oh, and we are going to rearrange my table set up by the bed so it can hold more things a bit more efficiently. :)"

Was ok this morning after half a pb sandwich but then I spent 3 hours on the boat on some pretty choppy water. I peed about 10 times and drank 3 bottles of water while trying to get in some vitamin pretzel stick to keep the nausea at bay. It did not work. I'm sure I look like a giant asshole to my husbands family who do not yet know. I ran off the boat as soon as I could, showered, and in bed again.   The worst part is I KNOW I'm hungry.

This is great for us), and then husband took the kiddo so I could sleep more. Yay!  Went and visited a lady who is opening a home daycare near us. She's opening in September, and we're looking for January. She seemed perfectly nice, and while I wasn't AMAZED, it's near us, she's an ECE, has been working with kids for 5 years, charges a reasonable rate... so like, we're going to keep looking as we JUST started, but it's nice to at least have a reasonable option.   Today we're working on rearranging our basement, and my sister and her fiance are coming over for dinner. Should be a good day!"

Fell asleep on the couch last night, woke up and went to bed around 1, thankfully I was able to get back to sleep after my kitty settled in! Still dealing with back/pelvis/rib pain but I think it's improved some since Chiro appt.   Worked outside this morning, soccer game tonight (man I hope we win) and trying to keep house from turning into an oven in between."

On weekends it's the same thing he pops in our room to let us know he's awake. And usually he likes pancakes for breakfast on weeks so I'll hop up and throw those together.  Having a baby that requires me to not only get up in the morning, but during the night to is gonna throw us all for a loop!!"

InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,smsolo,18,Fri Jul 17 19:30:11 2015 UTC,"This is fucking horrible and I am furious at these people that I have never met for doing this to you. They are trying to benefit and make money from your losses. That's unforgivable. I understand their concerns about health and as far as compensation, yes, you'd pay for travel, meds, etc. But to offer and then as for a fucking thank you gift, hell no. Jesus, I'm so sorry. This breaks my heart that you have to deal with betrayal like this on top of everything else."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,RositaYouBitch,3,Fri Jul 17 20:01:52 2015 UTC,I'm glad to see you are as angry as I am about it! At first I thought maybe I was over reacting since she is giving me something that no one else is willing to. But I would never do that to someone in my situation and I just can't believe she would do it to me!!
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,MrsDragon,6,Fri Jul 17 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"You are not over-reacting! This is incredibly shitty, full stop."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,MrsDragon,13,Fri Jul 17 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"Anyways, then her husband asks how they will be compensated. He wants dollar amounts as well as a 'thank you' gift. And by thank you gift I mean a fucking Hawaiian vacation for a family of 4!   Um, what? I think a polite ""We seem to have misunderstood each other. We would be paying for all of the treatments, but that's really all we can afford. I totally understand if you feel you need to be compensated for the risks involved with surrogacy, but in that case, I suggest that you work with an agency and help another couple.""  Sounds to me like she may have offered before talking to her husband (or before he realized that you would take her up on it!). Have you talked to her about it? Is she the sort of friend you can be upfront with?  This is a really shitty position to be in and I am so sorry you are having to deal with this."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,MrsDragon,5,Fri Jul 17 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"I told her that I didn't know how to respond to her request. I told her that we will take care of all the medical care and travel expenses. My husband and I planned on giving her about $300-500 to help her out a bit. But that was out of the goodness of our hearts. When it's expected, it's a whole other situation. It's not a generous favor anymore. It's a business transaction and if they are going to expect to make an income off of us, then we might as well go through an agency so that we aren't screwed. I'm afraid that when we start off being generous with everything we have, they will tack on more. Like delivery food service because she's too tired to cook, or to put her two kids in daycare because she's too tired to keep up with them. I feel like this will be more complicated than it has to be."

Yup, 110%. If it's going to be a contractual, business deal then you should absolutely be protected. This just doesn't seem like it will in any way end well."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,kat_loves_tea,8,Fri Jul 17 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"""He wants dollar amounts as well as a 'thank you' gift."" See, I could see where maybe she had a rush of generosity and agreed and then maybe had regrets OR her husband was worried about her safety and wanted to make sure she is covered.  But bartering and asking for vacations and shit tells me they are taking advantage of your situation. How do you say that shit to someone who's lost 3 babies...recently?! I am so sorry.  :("
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,ThatGreenSolGirl,3,Fri Jul 17 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are looking at our situation at all. I think all they see are dollar bills. She's donated her eggs randomly before to an agency and it was a quick $10,000.  She's never had a job before. She lived w her parents when she did that and then she married an army man and has been a stay at home mom ever since.  I don't think she's doing this from her heart."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,cakegroove,5,Fri Jul 17 20:37:26 2015 UTC,I don't think they're doing this from their heart either. They see an opportunity and are choosing to lunge towards it under the guise of friendship. That is inner ugliness coming right out and they should be ashamed of themselves. I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this on top of everything else. I agree with /u/MrsDragon and think you should apologize for the misunderstanding and walk away from this atrocity you call a friend. You can do better and you deserve better!
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,Sweetmusic_01,2,Fri Jul 17 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"Oh hell no. They're looking at your situation as a get rich quick scheme. Tell them no thanks, you can find a surrogate that isn't such a money grubbing cunt face."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,logisticaladventure,7,Sat Jul 18 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"awe honey I think you're going through too much right now. It seems like this offer happened too soon and it sounds like their intentions were not right.  I am shocked that the wife let the husband speak for them about this if being compensated was not what she wanted.  I know that I had friends offer their eggs to me and did not want a penny, only wanted to see us have a family.  it really is inconceivable that your friend and her husband BOTH feel this way. Even if they said nevermind about the compensation and nevermind about the thank you gift, I would say nevermind to them. This does not seem like good intentions to me on their part. I think they're looking for a buck, which has to hurt so badly knowing she is your friend.  Peoples friends really suck on here today!  What is the matter with people!  Big hugs to you my cyber friend"
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,dizzyvonblue,2,Fri Jul 17 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you. And you are right, they don't have good intentions. We've been best friends since 5th grade. I'm her daughter's godmother. I just didn't see this coming. I don't know what else to do."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,messofletters,5,Fri Jul 17 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"You've gone through enough already to be dealing with this crap. I'd definitely talk to her, thank her for her offer, then say for legal reasons you're going to go through an agency. Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,messofletters,3,Fri Jul 17 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea. I started to write her a message explaining that it wasn't going to work out if she expected to gain an income while doing this, but your idea sounds much better than mine. I'm not very tactful. Lol."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,jaina_jade,6,Fri Jul 17 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. Your experience with your friend is wrong on so many levels! Who offers to be a surrogate with the pretense that it's a favor, then yanks it away? I also feel really gross hearing that her husband is now trying to broker a lucrative arrangement, which makes him sound like her pimp honestly. And then asking for a thank you gift? This guy doesn't have the gene for shame. What's next? Naming the baby after him? I hope things get easier. I'll be thinking about you."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,jaina_jade,3,Fri Jul 17 21:31:17 2015 UTC,I agree. It's sickening that woman even describes herself as a friend.
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,pamplemousse2,4,Fri Jul 17 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"You know what would be a great gift if I became a surrogate for a friend? Seeing them have the family they always dreamed about. Offering to become a surrogate should be a selfless act, not something you expect to make money from.  You don't need to validate going on a cruise for yourself and not compensating your friend with a vacation for 4 to Hawaii. You saved for a fresh transfer and your own trip. Just because they decided to get greedy doesn't mean you need to suffer for it. Go on that vacation and tell them you're going to go a different way with surrogacy, because you both have very different ideas of what it all entails."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,pamplemousse2,4,Fri Jul 17 22:00:20 2015 UTC,Thanks. you are right. I'm going on this trip. My needs come first. Fuck them.
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,Ishslittleone,3,Fri Jul 17 23:08:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Tell them to go fist themselves. I can't believe how selfish they could be, especially with how fresh your grief is."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,reginalove84,5,Fri Jul 17 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"Pardon my french but fuck Her (and him!).  I had two couples offer to surrogate for us back when we thought it was an autoimmune issue, one of whom is now in an official surrogate system in TX, and they only asked for medication compensation.  Oh, and one husband suggested that their names would be awesome middle name options.    What she did is not something a friend would do - it's horrid and mean and makes me want to punch a pillow (working on ""anger"" issues)."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,absinthevisions,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:42 2015 UTC,"You have some awesome friends! We had a few offer but we didn't get into specifics. They said they would do it after they have all of their kids, and they aren't even pregnant or planning the first one yet. I need a better plan while I wait for them."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,eliwhi,2,Fri Jul 17 23:11:45 2015 UTC,"They are awesome people - the other couple is also planning to surrogate but are currently on assignment out of country.  All have already reproduced, one couple is done (he had the great snip right before they moved) while the other is debating.  The one couple we sort of expected to offer (TX) because she had mentioned doing it before we even knew we had issues.  The other couple was a total shocker, we were at a holiday party when they pulled us aside and told us.  About hit the floor while repeating are you sure - they had it all figured out down to showing us books they had got to explain to their daughters why the baby wouldn't be coming home with them."
InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,TigFan15,3,Fri Jul 17 23:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry. This fucking sucks. I agree that it seems that she's not meant to be your surrogate. And I know you want to move on to expanding your family right away. This is so frustrating. It doesn't mean you won't find a surrogate though! But maybe a little bit of breathing room between getting the embryos frozen and finding the surrogate won't be a bad thing? Does it help to think of it as breathing room?   No matter how you think of it, though, it fucking blows. I'm really angry on your behalf. Even if they just changed their minds, they should have been honest - and if they view this as income, she should never have offered without being specific. It's despicable you spring this on you."

InfertilityBabies,3dnprl,robyn_sparkles,2,Fri Jul 17 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, yes. This doesn't mean it is the end for you - but it does mean you'll have some time to get used to where you are now, on your way to where you will be.

I think she is too - we have air conditioning and it's supposed to be wicked miserable next week.  We are planning an outing with another couple and their 2yo! It should be on Sunday. She is pregnant with their #2. I am mostly not bitter that we were trying before them and that they are lapping us.   Otherwise I am so in love with my baby and with Mr B.

InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,lancealittle,4,Fri Jul 17 21:20:57 2015 UTC,"We have an aggressive-herb cage match going on in a corner of a raised bed among chives, thyme, and mint. Surprisingly, the thyme is kicking ass and taking names -- it has taken over much of the bed, and I'm gonna need to rip out about 80% of it to keep it from killing off the more delicate things we have. The mint is making a valiant late effort with a few runners coming up in the thyme and the chives, but the chives look sad. It's not actually a fair fight, because the chives were invaded by ants this spring so they have an ant hill instead of a root system."

She's been trying for ages, but hasn't been coordinated enough, so her efforts usually resulted in hitting herself in the face or sucking on whatever she could get near her mouth like her wrist or fist. So proud of her! She must be happy too, I never gave her a pacifier but let her suck on my finger whenever she really needed to so I guess she was extra motivated to figure it out on her own?

InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,yearofthecat,3,Fri Jul 17 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"My insurance told me  I get a free pump --- but which one to choose? They sent me a ton of suppliers, and the ones that keep coming up are:   Medela pump in style advanced starter kit  Ameda purely yours express  Evenflo Deluxe double pump  Spectra S2  Help!! Which one do you have?"
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,lancealittle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"The medela in style is pretty standard. Easy to use, fairly ubiquitous, and they sell replacement parts at Target so super accessible.     I used the hospital grade Ameda and I liked it. Less accessibility as far as tubing and parts to replace worn bits which is frustrating. Husband modded it to get me through an emergency though! Also their bottles are weird so they don't fit interchangeably with others. I couldn't just put a nipple on and feed after pumping, I transferred the milk to storage bags, then later transferred them to bottles to feed which can grow cumbersome.    I hear good things about the spectra and I believe their parts are interchangeable with the medela in style. I think /u/sjp8 and /u/zoraptera have experience with this one?"
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,septicidal,2,Fri Jul 17 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"I have yet to use the Spectra, but I do have it. I needed larger flanges as the standard 24 mm is too tight, esp when I feel engorged.  I ordered new flanges by calling Spectra directly (they deal with some company called Mothers Milk Inc) the larger flanges were not cheap, they were 15 bucks a pop after shipping.  There are ways you can hack the spectra to make it compatible with Medela parts, but I want to use the backflow protector to maintain the closed system. So I decided not to do that.  I would also recommend that you purchase a manual pump for the middle of night pumping (I use it to relieve engorgement).  The one I have is the Medela Harmony, it costs $30 on Amazon and I love it.  I would think its easier to use a manual pump in the middle of the night than an electric.      Also for those who don't know, I'm pretty sure all insurance companies are required to pay for a pump!  So before you go out and shell out hundreds of dollars on one, call your insurance company first!  Edit:  you can use some bottles with the Spectra, I can't recall which ones (either the Avent or the Tommee Tippee), there might be another brand too.  So you don't have to rely on Spectra only bottles with the pump."
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,septicidal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:29:07 2015 UTC,I got the PISA and also rent a Medela Symphony.  It's good and it's the one everyone has so parts are very easy to find.  I've heard good things about the Spectra though - it's hospital grade which makes me wish I'd taken a second look.
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,MrsDragon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"I had the Ameda purely yours last time (still have it). Kinda loud, but very reliable and useful. We used glass bottles and they were compatible with the pump parts, so I could just pump into, freeze, and feed from all the same bottles. This time I got a Spectra from my insurance co (arrived in the mail YESTERDAY!), and it's quiet as hell but the parts no longer fit our bottles :( I might be able to just swap out the flanges & tubing I have for the ameda onto that one, as they have a different backflow prevention system but it's the same idea."
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,septicidal,2,Sat Jul 18 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"Working more on my kitchen stuff... We have to prime the walls this weekend so the cabinets can start going up on Monday.  I also have to do two coats of paint on the sides of the cabinets that will be visible (around where the range hood goes).  Other than that... We won't have power for most of the day tomorrow because the electrician is doing a panel upgrade.  So the plan is for me to sleep in as much as I can, and then we're going out to see Ant-man in the air-conditioned theater, followed by hanging out with some friends at their place.  We should have power back by mid-afternoon, if all goes smoothly (which I expect it will, our electrician is awesome).  The new panel is HUGE, double the size of our current (which is maxed out), so once it is in it will be easier for us to correctly wire up the basement. (The previous owners mostly finished the basement but did EVERYTHING wrong, especially the electrical work.  So in order to do things correctly, we have to gut the space before re-finishing it. It's going to be expensive and a giant pain in the ass.)  Oh, and I bought the crib I wanted and am kind of freaking out about it.  I know it's on the early side to buy a crib (21 weeks now) but the one I like dropped in price and my instinct to save $30 is greater than my fear of jinxing things by buying too early.  Mostly."

I'm a little more detail-oriented when assembling things than my husband can be... Hence why I was the one to assemble all of our kitchen cabinets at 20 weeks pregnant.  I think it will be very hard to do that sort of thing in a few more weeks!"
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,apanda1084,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"Indeed! Especially since the pieces for the crib are so big, they get a bit unwieldy."
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,Iamagnu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"I think I bought a crib around the same time too, it seems early but really you're more than halfway through now!  Enjoy Ant Man! There's a baby-friendly showing of it happening next week that I'm hoping to go to."
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,jaina_jade,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"The daycare that's run by the university where we both work has an insane waiting list that we put mini-gnu on back in November, but they won't be ready for her until...well, we don't know when, because somehow whenever we call to check they have literally no idea how many babies are ahead of her on the waiting list, or how their brand-new infant facility will affect things. No idea why they can't so simple math, but whatever. It's really high-quality and subsidized by the university, so relatively affordable. For now though, we have mini all set at an alternate daycare, to start in a few weeks. Mr. gnu pointed out last night that the monthly fee for the non-university daycare is more than our monthly mortgage payment.  EDIT: Well, how about that? We just got the call for a spot at the university daycare!"
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,Marie197,3,Fri Jul 17 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"I hate how daycare/childcare of any sort is so fucking expensive in this country.  For a part time nanny, we're looking at at least $1800 a month, not including taxes if the person is on the books.  We don't even have a day care in our neighborhood, which would cost even more than that on a full time basis.  I'm kind of envious of those who can be SAHM's, but it's probably not good for my mental health, and the way things are going during mat leave, I'm probably not built for it either."
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,Iamagnu,2,Fri Jul 17 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"What a cluster with the university daycare! I hope they get this shit together. Did they say when the new section will be opening?  I am not at all looking forward to day care prices when we move at the end of the year. I guess with waitlists and all that jazz, I should start looking once we nail down what side of town we will be living."

Three days a week for Z is still going to be more than half the value of our mortgage payment. I can't remember what the rates were for infants at our center, but when I was researching costs, the median cost in our county was something like $1800 per month. How does anyone afford having kids these days?"

Plus, after everything I've been through, I don't know if I will be able to easily trust someone else to take care of my child. I used to do daycare for 8 years in centers and 2 years in my own home. I would be more inclined to go with a home provider after having done it myself, but I will be very meticulous and asking an obscene amount of questions if we end up going with a daycare and I continue to work, but I don't think I would make enough money to cover the cost of daycare and bring any money home after paying for it."

InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,kat_loves_tea,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:06 2015 UTC,Sometimes I feel like I'm so inundated with information about milestones that I worry so much about what Pond should be doing that I don't cherish what he is doing. How do you find a good balance between being aware of developmental stuff and not getting hung up on comparing your kid to others and getting upset about it?
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,cakegroove,4,Fri Jul 17 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"I tried not to dwell so much on other kids. I read about milestones and tried to keep tabs on things based on the documents the pediatrician gave me every two months but I wanted to make a conscious effort to focus on what she was doing. I write her a long monthly email that I start at the beginning of the month and keep as a draft until the end of the month. When a new exciting thing happens, I write a tiny blurb in it to add to it almost like a journal. I attach pictures I take at random on my phone during that month and send them to her email account. That way, I can go back and read over the month anytime I want and someday she can too. Maybe in the future when she has a little, she can reference them and she what she was up to at that age. I talk about my feelings, what our family life is like, her current favorite things, etc. Sometimes even current events make it into the email if they impact our daily life."

InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,vibeee,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:12 2015 UTC,Been going a bit stir crazy. How long after a c section did you wait before driving? I'm looking forward to feeling some sort of normal again.
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,logisticaladventure,2,Fri Jul 17 20:09:38 2015 UTC,"I put myself of pelvic rest for the first tri. Then my handsome husband comes in here, and dammit we had this non-intercourse sex. With all the sickness and anxiety I've had the past 2 months I just wanted to feel like myself again.  I feel like I did something so wrong and cruel. The last time we miscarried we had sex, I went to clean up and started spotting right away.  I. Am. Terrified. That it's going to happen again. I am so upset."
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,OrganizedSprinkles,3,Sat Jul 18 00:16:58 2015 UTC,I'm very nervous about sex as well. Last week I had some blood after the one time we've had sex since the transfer. I momentarily freaked out but it stopped right away and by morning there was nothing. At our ultrasound this week the pea was right on track with a great heartbeat. It's just a mental game we have to push through. Unless told otherwise by a doctor sex is safe for us.
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,sroethele,2,Sat Jul 18 01:44:40 2015 UTC,"It's not going to happen.  You are fine!  My first MC I started bleeding the next morning after having sex.  I was convinced that's that caused it.  Since then I have seen 3 different RE's and read a lot of research and nothing is pointing toward sex causing a MC's.    I was just bad luck, it was bound to happen in my case.  Take a deep breath!  You are fine!"
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,MrsDragon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:21:44 2015 UTC,It's just hard!  We have another ultrasound on Tuesday and then one on the following Monday. Because my OB does not need to know I had a scan less than a week prior by my RE. MOAR ULTRASOUNDS.  I'll be almost out of the first tri by that second scan and I feel like I can relax then.  Thank you ♡
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,cakegroove,2,Sat Jul 18 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"I know it's hard but the best we can do is to rationalize it.  No terrible cramping, no bright red blood flowing down your legs, no sudden sharp abdominal pain = everything is fine.  Best of luck with your scans!  I had scans every week until I hit 12 weeks.  It would have been hard to go on without the weekly reassurance.  After 12 weeks I turned into just another boring patient. I begged them twice for an ultrasound but they deemed it unnecessary.  I just had to face the fact that everything is so good they don't want to do it. Period.  Few more weeks and things are going to get easier again!"
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,MrsDragon,2,Sat Jul 18 00:35:31 2015 UTC,"I am terrified too, but it's totally irrational. It's like how sometimes your period starts after sex. You know sex didn't cause it, but it may help it present itself. That being said, I'm 13 weeks and there's been no sex since before transfer. I have to get it together and just go for it."
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,cakegroove,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"Suppose to have sinus surgery today. Last week baby bright home cold. Mine turned into sinus infection, hubs who had the same surgery a few months ago was sick for 12 hours, promising. So they still said I'm okay since I started antibiotics. So I did pre blood test and came back with low TSH. Same it was when I was going through fertility treatments. Back then I went to an endo and they said it was fine, just a special snowflake. Now a year and a half later they said they won't vouch for me so I have to see them. Right now the surgery is postponed until next Friday. Here's hoping. So babe is in daycare and as soon as I get blood drawn we're going to do lunch and a movie."

(??) uhh...because I was scheduled for a checkup?  She said somebody must have read my chart wrong because they only want to see me every 4 weeks after week 20.  Today I am 14W. I don't go back now until Sept 3. But we will be able to find out what we're having then!
InfertilityBabies,3dmqnk,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:15:44 2015 UTC,Weird. We had appointments ~ every 2 weeks between testing and the cervical checks (which they started at 17 weeks) so going to appointments every 4 weeks has been really strange! Did you at least get an ultrasound for your trouble?  Hooray for finding out the sex at your next visit though! :D

InfertilityBabies,3dkgyr,apanda1084,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:30 2015 UTC,"No. As of right now the growth is very close to the outer edge of the uterus. It's close to growing beyond my uterus and onto other organs. This next surgery will be extensive and we are anticipating a lot of scar tissue and for the uterus to heal in a way that is not favorable for implantation. And even if we were to try to risk it, my cervix would more than likely not be able to hold a pregnancy to term. The safest thing for myself and for any baby would be to have a surrogate.  It is tempting to try one more time, but there are so many risks. It's not worth losing my life over."

Hope she's swimming in all those gooey feelings that come with those new baby snuggles.    So, at home when we're done playing, I sing a cleanup song and S and I pick up toys to put in her storage baskets everyday. Well we did a play date at the children's museum and the sing song lady came to the toddler room. She dumped out a bucket of sealed plastic eggs filled with beans for the toddlers to rattle and she started singing. I guess her song sounded similar because S started picking up the eggs and putting them all in the basket. She even convinced her play buddy he should do the same. The moms all kinda looked at me and I felt a bit embarrassed, but my inner sass wanted to be like ""We keep a tidy house, y'all! Even my toddler knows. What of it?!?"""

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,messofletters,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:08 2015 UTC,"Ha, it's probably more effective since I'm doing most of the cleaning. ;)"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,4,Thu Jul 16 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"High five!  I sing a cleanup song to my son as well. I didn't know any cleanup songs actually existed when I started, so I just rewrote the lyrics to the Fraggle Rock theme song.   Put your toys away! (clap clap)  Play with them another day,  So put those toys away (clap clap)  In the [last name] house!   It works like a charm. He claps when I do and then goes and puts his toys away. Sometimes they make it into the toy box, sometimes on the floor right next to it because it's a little tall for him still, but I'll take it!  Does S ever take her toys back out, just to get you to sing again? Booger does and it's hilariously cute and mildly irritating all at once."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,HerVoiceEchoes,3,Thu Jul 16 20:58:34 2015 UTC,"Ahhh! I'm so glad I'm not the only one!! :D    Yessss!! If she's not ready to be done she takes some out so I'll keep singing and clapping with her. Little stinkers!! She even giggles when I'm like ""Hey! No no.."""
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Thu Jul 16 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely not the only one. Booger responds really well to song, so I sing constantly to try to get him to do things."

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:15 2015 UTC,That is AWESOME! Nothing to be embarrassed about! I love that she convinced her buddy to do it too!  When did you start singing the cleanup song with her? That's a routine I'd like to get into when my kiddo is old enough.
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,pamplemousse2,5,Thu Jul 16 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"He was definitely confused but she was like shoving the bin towards him and going ""Help! Help!"" Lol.   So we started singing the song at the end of bath time around 6-8 months. It would signify that we were getting out soon and it was time to gather her toys into their drying bin. It also prevented melt down because she loves baths and never wants out. This kind of gave her some time to warm up to the idea that bath time was winding down. Then we started doing it when we were done with floor time and she watched me put up toys. Now we do it together everyday and it's great. At the end we throw up our hands and go ""YAY!"" together and she really enjoys the praise."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Thu Jul 16 19:54:38 2015 UTC,"Man, I need a routine for the end of bath time. Every night he gets so upset when I take him out of the bath. Now it is a HUGE struggle to get him in his jammies afterwards. I feel like I am wrestling a wee alligator! I know this sounds silly but I feel like a dumbass and self-conscious singing songs to K. My mom tries to sing K songs sometimes and he puts his hand over her mouth! Lol."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,nfgchick79,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:13:04 2015 UTC,"Oh I know that plight!! We have a special toy for jammie time, lavender massage and some warm milk before nursing and bed. It used to be a total mess getting her out of the bath and they're so sticky and hard to dress when they fight fresh from the bath!!    That's hilarious he covered her mouth! Such a critic already! Lol"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Thu Jul 16 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"Ugh yes! Hey, btw speaking of a special toy, when did you introduce a bed time lovey? K has a few loveys but I haven't been comfortable letting him have them at bed time. AAP recommends one year but I mean he is sitting up, rolling over and crawling. He's almost 9 months old. I thought a lovey might help with the night time struggle.  My mom is a terrible singer too so that makes it extra funny!"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,nfgchick79,2,Thu Jul 16 23:41:50 2015 UTC,"We did 8 months but I didn't leave it with her ALL night. Just for the going to sleep phase. Then I moved it to the side. If she wanted it, she could still get to it but she seemed happy enough just seeing it there close by."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Fri Jul 17 00:33:53 2015 UTC,Ah okay. I'm a bit paranoid (you don't say?!) and anxious so I haven't been quite sold on the idea yet. Perhaps soon though as he is starting to have issues with separation anxiety and I read that a lovey can help with that. He already has one that he loves that helps calm him in the car.
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,nfgchick79,2,Fri Jul 17 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"It definitely helps with separation anxiety. Hopefully you figure something out that works for both of you. There's no point in doing something if you're going to be up all night, checking in, and worried ya know?"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Fri Jul 17 01:36:25 2015 UTC,"Right, exactly :) Thanks as always for your advice and wisdom."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,nfgchick79,2,Fri Jul 17 10:17:28 2015 UTC,Don't be embarrassed. That's awesome!

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Thu Jul 16 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"Her OCD is adorable. My niece used to sing their ""clean up"" song when she came to my college apartment. Getting called out by a 2-year-old stung, but she was right."

The best prepared thing at our weggies is particular to this store only (but I'm sure they could make a killing if they expanded it to other places): the Wings of Life Salad. If you get everything, it has romaine lettuce, broccoli, marinated tofu, sprouts, kalamata olives, shredded carrots, chickpeas, brown rice, black olives, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, bleu cheese, feta cheese, and your choice of dressing. The best one is called ""rugged garlic"" and makes you smell like garlic all day. Drool."

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"People are just assholes in general. I also got mad because yes they make the aisles super wide, but they also made the carts twice the average size so there's still not much room when people stop.  And Dillon's car seat was on the top and I'm short and could see over it. So I couldn't see, everyone was in my way and I was hangry. Perfect storm of suck.  We bought popcorn kitty litter and left because we just couldn't make it much further"

Asher  will be in a crib by the end of the week. Both boys are taking two bottle feeds a day and they each take the boob for about 10-15 minutes before getting tuckered out and falling asleep. Things are moving along a bit faster now and I'm optimistic we'll get our get out of jail card around the end of the month.   Bonus: the babes meeting outside of the womb for the very first time.

He's also taken to asking after them every few hours ""How are the beans doing?"" and I give him activity reports. :)  Oh my gosh, I had no idea urine could do that.

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,vibeee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:43:37 2015 UTC,I imagine that was tough. :( Hooray for almost being there though. It'll be even more special when it's his little one kicking. : D
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,spankyjubblies,3,Thu Jul 16 21:44:40 2015 UTC,My husband had a couple of wisdom teeth pulled Tuesday. You'd think they cut his damn arm off...the man is driving me CRAZY. I love him dearly but he can be a big drama queen baby.    I have an ultrasound at my MFM today! Can't wait to see the little ones squirming around.

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,JoeBidenBot,3,Thu Jul 16 16:23:03 2015 UTC,I keep forgetting to switch out my vivelle patches - the reminder I put on my phone isn't working - I must not have set it up correctly - maybe at our appointment Monday they will say we don't have much longer for progesterone shots and the patches  This is the third time I've forgotten to switch them in the morning - I'm going to go home for lunch in an hour - hopefully I don't forget again ugh - why can't things just be easy? I find myself supremely annoyed at anyone who gets pregnant naturally and doesn't have to deal with all these needles and following a calendar and all the anxiety that goes along with it - we've done so good about not messing it up except for my forgetful brain this last week about switching patches - hoping it's all been worth it to see a heartbeat on Monday
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,logisticaladventure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:16 2015 UTC,I hear ya.  I was so worried I was going to forget to do my progesterone shot and that it was going to cause me to miscarry.  Ridiculous thing to have to worry about.
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,JoeBidenBot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:23 2015 UTC,Luckily my husband is on top of that! He's done all of my shots - even the stomach ones I was freaking out too much to do them myself

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,JoeBidenBot,3,Thu Jul 16 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"I scored a Medela breastpump with accessories for $272 (down from $464) yesterday on Amazon. One of my mom friends text-bullied me into it, and upon reflection, I'm pretty happy about it. First baby purchase: done.  Going to try to get to Trader Joe's for delicious tiny heirloom tomatoes once this morning sickness lets me brush my teeth. I'm also obsessed with their honey goat cheese (pasteurized) with red grapes on toast these days.  Good luck to /u/dutchqueen today!"

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,2,Thu Jul 16 18:26:04 2015 UTC,I never got far enough along to look into breast pumps so I never realized how lucky I was to have received two medela pumps for free from friends. One is a pump in style advanced with a tote & it's my favorite to use out of the three I've tried (the third being the Ameda pump I rented for the first month because the hospital told me to).
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,logisticaladventure,2,Thu Jul 16 21:02:52 2015 UTC,What great friends! How are you finding breastfeeding? The idea of it feels pretty daunting right now.   I might have jumped the gun on buying the pump. It turns out that my insurance will give me one AND my SIL is going to give me her medela freestyle (the exact one I bought).
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,3,Thu Jul 16 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, insurance coverage for a free pump is generally mandatory these days (thanks, Obama). Maybe cancel your order?     Also, that honey goat cheese with their fig jam is a staple in our house. Love it!!    Eta: sometimes if you buy one on your own, insurance will just reimburse you instead of making you go through a medical supplier to get one!"

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,logisticaladventure,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"(thanks, Obama).   I said this to the insurance person over the phone today. I'm going to keep the Amazon one until the free pump from my SIL materializes (who knows, whether this is ACTUALLY her last child), but will still try to claim it through insurance--because let's face it, they owe me after not covering dick for IVF.  Fig jam...yes. I have some fresh figs I smuggled from my parents' house. What a lovely idea. I'm going to up the ante and add a bit of balsamic too, because I only puked once today."

We nurse for about 15 minutes, but most of the time they're falling asleep at the boob and practicing suck-swallow-breathe. So it's slow going and they're getting regular feeds in addition to our nursing time, but I absolutely love those moments with my babies."

Amazing hearing mine, then it's heartbeat fluttering behind it.   So. Tired. I volunteered ages ago for a runway production where my polytechnic provides the hair and makeup for the models. I was hoping to skip out as it was too much work for someone in early pregnancy, especially in the days leading up to the end of our term holidays (I go back to school on Monday). Well 6 girls pulled out, so I had no choice and now there's 3 hairdressers for 30 models plus performers. I had today off as it was dress rehearsal, but it's been 2 huge days before that and I'm shattered. Friday is 12 til dinner and Saturday is the show, 9am start for show at 3 plus touch ups and after party... Amazing experience but I'm exhausted."

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,becabecaful,2,Thu Jul 16 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"When did you ladies start buying baby clothes?  We are (hopefully) finding out the sex on Monday, and people are already asking me - aren't you excited to start shopping?! Honestly I would love to (I actually havent bought anything yet..) but my infertility PTSD brain is ruining it for me. 19 weeks.. almost half way seems like a good time to pick up a few things?   I was looking online at baby stores (Carters) and noticed though that nothing is in season for my baby yet... it's all summer clothes, so maybe I will have to wait."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 16 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not really planning on buying many. We are having two showers and I made a point of only registering for some basic white onsies. Sure enough at our first shower we received a pile of baby clothes. Everyone just seems to love buying them. : )  Although, I guess I should add, we did provide white onsies/bibs for people to decorate, so maybe that counts as us buying them?  I figure once the second shower is over, we'll take stock of what we have and fill in the gaps as necessary. I've also got a friend with a truckload of baby clothes she wants to send us as soon as we know how big they are.   There are a few things I want to buy just for the cute factor, but otherwise, I'm not really planning on building them a wardrobe.  Now shopping for nursery stuff... :D"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,becabecaful,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"Heh yeah I'm not going to go crazy, but I'd like to at least buy a few cute things. Then comes the whole sizing issue... no clue what to even get. A few new born outfits, 3 mo? 6 mo?"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"That's a large part of why I want to wait. If they spend their first few weeks mostly in diapers and blankets, it probably won't hurt them. But all baby clothes look ridiculously tiny, so it's so hard to gauge. And with twins, they could be born early and be preemie sized or be born on schedule and be about where my husband and I were (7+ pounds). So, no clue."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,septicidal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:47:38 2015 UTC,we're hopefully finding out tomorrow- my plan is to buy next year's summer clothes soon since they'll be on sale.  I love sales.
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 16 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"With our first we bought some symbolic shoes while we were on vacation right after a reassuring NT scan, but almost all of her clothes have been second-hand and hand-me-downs. I LOVE not feeling like I have to somehow recoup my investment on little things she wore for only a few weeks. Plenty of her baby clothes are still usable with #2, but it is freeing to be able to toss or pass along things that wear out or aren't as useful as they seem.   This time around we've simply had to haul some boxes out of the garage and do a bunch of laundry. Not as exciting!"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,bandgeek_foreves,2,Thu Jul 16 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yes! I love hand me downs so much! Plus, it frees up money to the budget to buy the ""OMG so cute I have to have it!"" stuff, guilt free!"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,septicidal,2,Thu Jul 16 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"I purchased a few things after my first anatomy scan attempt at 18 weeks went well (they had trouble getting some views, including between the legs, so they had me do another scan at 20 weeks).  It was a HUGE step for me, I freaked out a little when I placed the order.  Carter's had some warmer winter stuff on sale earlier this week and I ordered a few things... But the sale might be over now.  I got some deals on a few cute things via Target as well, they had a selection."

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 16 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"We bought a few things probably around 27 weeks? I remember buying sale stuff after New Years and making sure they were the right size for the season.   But we also have a nephew 4 months older than D so we have a lot of hand me downs coming, so we haven't bought a lot of new clothes. Just really cute things that catch our eye."

Once we know the gender I will do the shopping. Clothes are out of season here too for me, but we're in winter here and I'm having a summer babe.   It's incredible how different the culture is for you guys with your showers, we mostly get clothes, bibs, toys at ours, we don't do registries or anything."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,bandgeek_foreves,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"It's incredible how different the culture is for you guys with your showers, we mostly get clothes, bibs, toys at ours, we don't do registries or anything.   It varies a lot from group to group. Our gifts were probably 50% clothes, bibs, blankets, etc and the balance small to medium things off our registry. To be honest, the only reason we even put the larger things on the registery is for the completion discount the stores offer (usually like 10% off or so). Some people think registries are horribly tacky, but as a baby shower attendee, I love them. Even if I don't buy something off the registry, I can usually figure out what colors they are doing in the nursery and their personal taste, even if I don't know them super well."
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,ivf_lizz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"So once you've had your shower, you get a discount on the items left on your registry? I'm sure shops here probably do registries, but it's not something I've encountered personally. I can definitely see how they'd be beneficial for seeing personal taste though!"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,hopefaithandlove,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"Yup. : ) The stores want to encourage you to buy all the things, so anything that's not purchased by a certain time (not sure if it's your due date or a bit before), they give you a discount on. Plus they do other offers.  Like Babies R Us, one of the big shops here, gives you 10% as a completion discount, plus everything that's purchased off your registry before that (by you or other people), once you reach your due date, they give you a gift card for 10% of that amount. So, basically as long as we put it on the registry before we buy it, we get 10% either as a straight up discount or in a gift card. They also offer a multiples discount which is great for us, because 2 car seats, 2 cribs, etc gets spendy in a hurry. Combine it will sales/coupons and you can get some pretty good prices."

Our kitchen renovation is on track, but now my husband is shooting down my ideas.  I'm getting really frustrated.  Other than that... Chugging along.  The perinatal psychiatrist doesn't like the anti-nausea medication I'm on, but it's the only one that helps.  I'm trying to go without it today to see how everything goes.  The drywall should be mostly done today, so we can let the kitties out of their quarantine in the master bedroom either tonight or tomorrow.  The cats are really sick of being cooped up, but we have to keep them away from the construction work (obviously) and didn't want them loose while the walls were opened up.  Edited to add: Obviously kvetching on the internet is productive because my husband agreed to my original plan.  I found an affordable B&B in Bar Harbor, ME, and we'll stop on the way up in Portland so he can have beer and whatnot."

InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jul 16 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"So my pump came with this awesome hands free contraption... it is hysterical!! I'm all hooked up now and pumping as we speak :P  Things have been getting a bit better each day for the most part. Nicky is taking most of his feeds at the boob now, but I think he gets tired out really easily. Does 20 minutes of feeding sound like enough time for him to get everything he needs? He's been up about ever 1.5-2 hours to feed, and I can't tell if he's  heading through a growth spurt or he's not getting quite enough. My milk suply seems to have picked up a bit with the extra breast feeding. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice.   The last thing that I'm finding really difficult is sleeping at night when he is sleeping. I'm just so paranoid. Every little sound he makes keeps me awake, but then when he isn't making sounds I'm awake worrying if he's still breathing. I miss the nicu where he was hooked up to machines and I didn't have to worry at all :( I don't think he sleeps well in the bassinet because he makes SO much more noise there than anything else he has slept in, so I'm going to try moving the pack n play upstairs and see how he does in that. Someday I'm going to have to sleep again... lol  On the agenda today - COSTCO!! I am so getting an ice cream :P"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,messofletters,3,Thu Jul 16 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"I've always liked this image: Size of newborn baby's stomach, birth to one month  As long as he is having the appropriate amount of wet diapers (and his urine is light yellow, not dark yellow), he's getting what he needs.  It sounds like you are doing a great job!  As for sleep... Is there any way you can leave your husband with pumped milk for 3-4 hours and go sleep in another room?  You could relax knowing the baby is being looked after, and get some much needed rest.  My perinatal psychiatrist recommended trying to have my partner do at least one feeding a day while I get some extra sleep, to help cope with the hormonal changes and minimize the possibility of postpartum depression."

I'd always wondered how the poor things got enough food if it took several days for milk to come in, so that explained it!"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,messofletters,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"20 minutes?  That sounds great!  Mine only stays on for 5-10 minutes a boob...and she often unlatches and protests.  The best way to know if your baby is getting enough is if he is gaining weight.    We were terrified when we first went home with our little girl.  She was not eating much, and her weight dropped below the 10% so we had to supplement a couple times.  But babies are resilient, and she's doing well now.  As the days pass, I feel a bit more confident and less freaked out about her safety.  You're doing fine!  I love going to Costco during the week!  No crowds and lots of snacks!"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"I feel better about that, thanks for the reassurance. We're back at the doctor next week so I'm anxious to see if his weight has gone up. It wasn't as high as he would lave liked earlier this week, but since then we've upped the breast feeding, so I'm feeling hopeful!  We are going to get a ton of pre made, easy to cook things, plus snacks and stuff.... It's time to get some real food in this house! :P yay Costco!"
InfertilityBabies,3di5l6,hopefaithandlove,2,Thu Jul 16 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"My ivf_babe was 'under weight' when she was born (2.29kg/ 5lbs,1oz) and the LC recommended no more than 10 minutes per side,  and then spoon or cup feeding her another 5-10mL.  This is because at that size  it can take more energy to get the colostrum out than it has in nutrients.   Once my milk came in,  I started to feed her until she was was 'done'  on one side,  then offered the second side (for 'dessert', which sometimes takes as much time as 'dinner'  now.  sigh)"

The fact he demands and then seems satisfied after is all good signs he's getting what he needs. Obviously weight gain is the only true test but he sounds like he's doing great.

InfertilityBabies,3dht9e,traveler5678,3,Thu Jul 16 11:38:49 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about Braxton Hicks contractions (the ""fake"" ones, that feel almost real, but have no real pattern, and don't keep up for long), they help your body prepare for true labor.  AFAIK, they don't help the baby descent and lead to dilation/effacement of the cervix.  But I may be wrong, so someone correct me if I am!  Hope this is what you were wondering about."
InfertilityBabies,3dht9e,SJP8,2,Thu Jul 16 11:46:52 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I believe they are still Braxton Hicks contractions.  (These guys don't feel remotely real.)
InfertilityBabies,3dht9e,rbrvwv,2,Thu Jul 16 12:53:02 2015 UTC,"FWIW, for me the difference between BH and honest-to-goodness labor wasn't how the contractions felt, it was how regular they were. I went in to L&D at 34 weeks because my BH were coming every three minutes and sure enough, I was in actual labor.  If you're not sure what kind of contractions you're having, change what you're doing. (People usually say ""lie down"" but I often got BH when I was resting, so getting up and moving around made them go away.) If they're coming regularly and changing your activity doesn't change that, then call your OB. Much better safe than sorry."

InfertilityBabies,3dht9e,effingeffstick,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:33 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm weird but I never had any painful contractions outside of real labor. The only way I knew I was has having fake ones was my belly would feel hard. I could never tell anything was going on unless I touched it.
InfertilityBabies,3dht9e,curiouslywanting,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:23:29 2015 UTC,"I usually have to touch both sides of my abdomen to make sure.  Otherwise, it's hard for me to differentiate contractions from certain baby movements."

InfertilityBabies,3ddrwi,ThatGreenSolGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 15:00:01 2015 UTC,I have a diaper bag and a few cloth diapers.  Lots of interest in the diaper bag. And all those people who show interest don't show up to view or buy ಠ_ಠ

Our local diaper service offers a ""starter kit"", so I'm thinking that might help? And another local mom gave us a generous stash of cloth covers to get us started."
InfertilityBabies,3ddrwi,Zoraptera,2,Wed Jul 15 15:16:39 2015 UTC,We are cloth diapering. I don't know if I would give anyone advice for starting out your stash because I didn't listen to what everyone said about buying a few different brands because you don't know what you'll like.  I bought omaiki mini Ös for newborn stage and applecheeks otherwise. I figured resale was good so if I didn't like them I'd get most of my money back.  Luckily they work and I love the fit.

I've felt a lot of random pins and needles in my stomach, but maybe that just a sensation when skin is stretching? My dr said most first time moms dont experience movement until 20-22 weeks. I had quite a bit of belly fat prior to getting pregnant.. so maybe thats even more extra cushion?  I go in my for anatomy scan Monday and of course even though I just heard the heartbeat last week, my mind is totally thinking horrible things... ugh. I just want to enjoy this dammit."
InfertilityBabies,3ddrwi,mrswhiskerson,3,Wed Jul 15 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"My OB said not to be alarmed until 24 weeks or later, especially because I have both an anterior placenta and ""extra cushioning"" pre-pregnancy.  They'll be able to tell you at the anatomy scan if the placenta is anterior.  I'm almost 21 weeks and occasionally I feel things that might be baby but it's hard to tell.  Remember that compared to your body, the baby isn't very large and is cushioned by both the placenta and amniotic fluid.  It isn't until later, when the baby's bones and muscles are bigger, that it will be able to give you movements strong enough to feel consistently.  My OB said not to worry about consistency/frequency of movement until after 28 weeks."

I've been scared to do an introduction because my situation had been so precarious, but now that I'm two weeks passed viability, I'm forcing myself too!  I am pregnant with twins (boys) from my third IVF (this time with ICSI!). They are due mid October. I had bleeding from about 8 weeks on, had a CVS at 12 weeks that may have brought me close to miscarriage (bleeding, contractions for a bit -- doctor warned me the risk was high for me because I was spotting before hand, but for complicated reasons, the CVS was still necessary). 19 weeks I had a hemorrhage in public, ambulance to ER, told I was miscarrying, maybe should think about scheduling D&C, otherwise I would be hoping for a miracle. A day later I was diagnosed with placenta previa and told I was fine. Babies at 26 weeks are healthy, progressing, ahead of the growth curve, and now I'm a model twin pregnancy? It's been a crazy journey.  I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I think that may be common for the infertility pregnancy experience?  So that's my story! Sorry for the delay!"

InfertilityBabies,3dalxr,Iamagnu,7,Fri Jul 17 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"I'm 5 weeks pregnant after our first IVF+ICSI cycle. My husband's sperm lacks the enzyme to penetrate an egg. It turns out I'm actually quite fertile. But for 26 cycles, we may as well have been shooting mustard in there. I had all sorts of tests and small procedures. We even removed a teeny tiny polyp just in case that was the issue. It wasn't until we'd already signed up for IVF that our RE ordered the sperm penetration assay and bingo, no eggs fertilized. Now we know we'll never make a baby in the bedroom, we'll have to show up at the clinic with our wallets out, but at least we have closure.  And at least, so far, that first cycle has worked and we have two more embryos on ice. (We implanted one, I'm 30, I didn't want to take the increased risk of multiples, figuring I have good odds and time to try again if need be.) Anyway, I'm anxiously awaiting the ultrasound two weeks from tomorrow and trying not to worry about having very few symptoms. I should be counting my blessings on that front!"

Every step feels like light years apart from each other (and it doesn't help that pregnancy itself isn't exactly glamorous or fun) BUT I felt my little girls head (which is still in my tummy) on my hand a second ago and it makes the wait so worthwhile.  Good luck!!!!

I'll be 17 weeks on Friday, and I'm due on Christmas day!  I admit I've been a little hesitant to join in the conversation because I feel like I've had things pretty easy - I got pregnant on our first IUI, and I've had an easy pregnancy so far, no morning sickness, feeling good in general.  But it's so nice reading all of your posts and hearing what's going on, getting my baby conversation fix without boring all the people in my life.

We earned this damnit! Being here and still participating in Infertility reminds me all the time of how insanely lucky I am to have had success with just one IUI when my RE was pushing for IVF.

And I, too, am so grateful for the options that we had, the aggressiveness of our doctors, and that our plans actually worked. It's nice to be around people who you know are grateful for the chance, and who don't take this for granted - even when things get hard sometimes."

InfertilityBabies,3dalxr,vibeee,5,Wed Jul 15 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"I'm new here as I just saw this subreddit yesterday. I got my first BFP ever last Friday so I am now 4 weeks 4 days pregnant. My husband and I had only been trying for a year but I am anovulatory, have pcos, and hashimoto's hypothyroidism. I literally had a 199 day cycle after coming off bc that was only cut short by provera.  I did multiple rounds of clomid and femara which finally made me ovulate but I didn't conceive while taking them. In the beginning of June we had a SA that came out great but then I had my HSG which showed my right fallopian tube was completely occluded. At that point in time we were reffered to see a RE and our appointment was scheduled for August 17th. My doctor did not want to do anymore rounds of clomid or femara while we waited for our appointment.  So unmedicated we conceived our first child. I am really nervous that it will not stick because I had horribly low progesterone (0.13ish) at every 21 day draw until I ovulated and on the medicated cycles it only got up to 10. When I ovulated on my own this month my 21 day draw was only 6. We have our first appointment next week and I am going to push for progesterone supplementation and hopefully it's not too late to start it.  Sorry for the long intro and I know we didn't go through as much to get here as a lot of you ladies but I am soo happy to be here."
InfertilityBabies,3dalxr,jjohnson13112,2,Wed Jul 15 06:35:28 2015 UTC,Can you push for supplementation earlier?  I lot of doctors will subscribe it without seeing you if they know your history.    I wouldn't wait a week.   Those first few days are so crucial.  Congrats on your pregnancy and best of luck with everything!
InfertilityBabies,3dalxr,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:55:55 2015 UTC,You're right I should call and see if they will draw a progesterone level now and hopefully start supplementation sooner. My doctor is out until the 20th unfortunately and idk if someone else in the office will do anything since they don't know me or my history. I guess it doesn't hurt to ask right? Thanks
InfertilityBabies,3dalxr,TigFan15,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:39 2015 UTC,You don't even need them to do the draw.  They should prescribe it as a precaution.  I have a pretty short luteal phase and my progesterone doesn't get high enough around and after ovulation.    Extra progesterone can't harm you or the baby.   It can only help if you are not producing enough.  If you have any friends who are pregnant or were recently pregnant I would ask around - that's if your OB office doesn't want to prescribe it to you without your doc's approval.  I've done it before.  They may be upset with you next time you see them but your pregnancy outcome is more important.

InfertilityBabies,3dbdul,MrsDragon,3,Tue Jul 14 23:27:08 2015 UTC,"I was on paid maternity leave for 4 months (technically, we get 12 weeks paid by the government, but I added vacation time to that because I needed to strech it for a spot in daycare to open up). I loved it at first, but it dragged on and I have to admit that I'm not made to be home with a baby all the time. I felt terribly guilty about that (after all, I finally got what I always wanted, a baby, right?) Anyways, I was actually really looking forward to getting back to work. The transition was rough (it took a while to get adjusted to the new routine, to leaving my baby at daycare, to getting used to be a working mother), but it's good now. For the past few months, I finally feel like my old pre-infertility self again (happiness, yay!), but + baby. Awesome. And while juggling working and babycare has its challenges, I'm really happy with the way that everything went."
InfertilityBabies,3dbdul,Aventurijn,2,Wed Jul 15 08:17:47 2015 UTC,"I work for a small company that does not fall under FMLA. Company policy is six weeks. If you want to get paid, you use your paid time off plus you get one week of short term disability at 50% pay for each year you have worked there. I went ahead and asked for twelve weeks anyway - they blessedly gave it to me. I wanted that time with my baby and we could take the financial hit. I do not regret it. If anything, I wish I could have taken more.   Transitioning back to work was rough for me. He wasn't sleeping through the night yet, I was struggling to pump milk each day. But you figure it out, get your bearings. Like anything, it takes time. Someone said to me the first year is full of transitions. You figure one thing out and then everything changes again. Now that we are 1.5 years out, I can say that advice was absolutely true. Take it in stride and you'll be fine. Actually, you'll be awesome because you'll have that baby."

I did 6 weeks of disability (though one was taken from my vacation) then I had 2 weeks for Christmas shut down (came back to work for 2 days to get back into the system to get holiday pay and cookies) then 3 weeks unpaid FLMA. Maternity leave was not for me.  I'm much better at work and he's much better being a rock star at daycare. I still had 15 FLMA days left to use and have been doing so throughout the year. I'm glad to have them. I also came back at 32 hours. It's a minimal hit to the piggy bank and just gives me some flexibility and a touch of sanity. If it gets busy at work I can work more (paid OT) or if not I go home. It's a good deal.    Don't worry if you don't love maternity leave. Remember many people pay people to do it."

InfertilityBabies,3dbdul,DisembodiedJen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"I worked past my due date. My original plan was to work until I went into labor but the Friday after my due date (which was a Monday), my boss strongly urged me to just start my leave. The following Monday I had an OB/GYN checkup and she said the same thing so I twiddled my thumbs at home for a few days. I used PTO for that week, had a c-section on Friday, and the following week my short term disability started. Since I had a c-section, I had eight weeks of leave.  I returned to work the day my son turned two months old. I dropped him off at daycare, sobbed in the parking lot for a while (I actually budgeted 'crying time' into my morning that day, knowing I wouldn't be fit to drive for a while), and then went to work.  At the time, my workplace didn't have pumping rooms. I work in the IT department and my boss let me use our storage closet as a room to pump in, which made for some awkward times when my all-male co-workers would forget I was in there and need supplies. My son also didn't sleep through the night until he was ten months old. All of that together made transitioning hard for me.  My son wasn't phased at all by going to daycare. He spent his first month away from me in a commercial daycare center and was well taken care of and happy. Then an in home daycare that I really liked (run by a family friend) had an opening and I moved him to there. The lady who runs it loves him like he's family and it shows in how well he's taken care of."

I wish I'd known that it'd take so many attempts; that just because the doctor is optimistic doesn't mean it'll happen right away. I wish I'd developed a failure plan earlier. After an IVF which didn't result in transfer, and a FET resulting in miscarriage I came up with a ""reward list"" - if I wasn't getting a pregnancy I'd get the next thing on list: a trip, a dog, etc.   I got pregnant from my third FET! I'm holding one of my twins as I type this - so ultimately I wish I'd known that there'd be a good outcome, but that's the one thing no one can promise. Infertility is so unfair and the experience robs us of so much of the joy and hope. Try to find a way to stay positive.   Good luck!"

InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:09:16 2015 UTC,it does but this clinic is already so insanely expensive (especially compared to our only other family member's IVF experience in the south- which is apparently the least expensive in the country) that we haven't even discussed spending more for the insurance. we meet with the finance office people on friday. maybe it will come up then.

I feel very fortunate I've made it this far (26 weeks) and I love my twins in utero, but I also have had a couple close calls.  The only other thing I wished I knew was that it is perfectly possible to have a couple bad runs and then one fantastic run where all eggs are good eggs.

InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,Rudysgoldfish,3,Tue Jul 14 22:18:55 2015 UTC,"Hey this is a really good question! I wish I had known to expect pain from the ER and transfer. Of course everyone is different, and most stories I read did not turn out like mine. But I had bad bloating pain after my ER. I had to stay home from work for a week, and only Gatorade (replacing all water) and salty snacks helped.  For transfer (5day), my bladder was way too full and that combined with the residual ER bloat was painful. Drink what you need (for me it should have been 16 oz an hr before, 24 max) and then let your bladder fill up...give it time. I kept drinking up until transfer so they had to use a catheter on me in the OR. That was traumatic for me because it was painful and my husband was in there with me. I still get a really angry and vulnerable feeling if he ever brings it up.  Find a way to make the day special. Afterall ER is your conception day and transfer is a huge day too. We went into the collection room together and had a nice moment. We took pictures in our hospital gown and scrubs the day of the transfer. The hope-fear combo in our eyes is clearly visible and I do cherish those moments. Even if it was never the way I intended or frankly wanted things to go.  My clinic appointed 24 hr bedrest with bathroom privileges only after transfer. There is much debate on whether this is necessary but it worked for me.  Also, we were in the IF closet for a year before IVF. We decided to come out of the closet right before we began our IVF cycle, and I was truly humbled, encouraged and inspired by all the well wishes and support.  Best of luck to you!!"

It's hard to see the numbers go down and down. For me I had 25 eggs retrieved, 11 mature, 6 fertilized and only had one blast on day 5. I expected to have some to freeze, my amh and afc were great, egg quality in the end not so much. I'm very lucky and grateful my one blast made it and I'm 26 weeks currently!"
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,Bibbityboo,3,Wed Jul 15 04:12:19 2015 UTC,"So I'm going to come in from a bit of a different perspective since a lot of the pre-IVF stuff have been mentioned (fear, unknown, preparing for both success and failure)....  I don't want this to sound ungrateful, because I'm so so so grateful to be pregnant now. I was very lucky and got pregnant on our first try. But what I hadn't actually prepared myself for was being pregnant. I mean, when we first started trying, I was full of hopes and dreams, and I eventually just really focused on infertility, IVF and all that went with it. I think I just thought everything would be over and a-ok once I did get pregnant.  But that wasn't the case in my case (lots of people go on to have normal pregnancies!). I wasn't prepared for the way that infertility took away my excitement. That's not quite right, but instead of shouting it from roof tops and feeling great, I was cautious. I waited to tell people, I very much took things one day at a time. It was hard to enjoy everything because nothing had come easy so I was constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop -- I see this a lot here.  And then the other thing? Turns out I don't get to have a standard pregnancy. I've had a lot of complications, and I'm on my second round of bedrest at 19 weeks. Originally at around 6 weeks I had a subchorionic hematoma and I was told to be prepared for a miscarriage -- amonth of bleeding later and it resolved. I now have a tear in my placenta, and again, bleeding and hoping it will resolve. I Was mentally unprepared for all of this, and my reactions haven't been the best, I've struggled to be optimistic, I don't know how to just enjoy being pregnant, and I was so emotionally drained from everything leading up to this that I don't think I had the emotional reserves to deal with this.  So, I wish I knew going into all of this that after IVF comes another phase. Its not over. I so wanted the IF to go away then, and to be ""normal"" but we don't get that. Absolutely this is all better knowing that right now I'm pregnant, and I'm very grateful for that, but i wish I had been aware enough to know the next stage wasn't without its fears and worries. I don't think I""ll ever feel like things worked until I hold a healthy baby (and yeah, as a parent I'll then have new fears).  Good luck! I hope everything works for you sooner rather than later, and you have a smooth and boring pregnancy."
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,revangelfire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:54:41 2015 UTC,This is a really good point. I was prepared for standard pregnancy woes. I wasn't prepared for the way infertility would color things.
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,Bibbityboo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:20:04 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with you here! After a miscarriage from our first FET we couldn't celebrate being pregnant and it was all caution and worry. Now I have complete placenta previa with a marginal insertion and am on pelvic rest and decreased activity. The worry will never end. I had hoped so much for a normal healthy pregnancy after what we went through and was robbed of that too which was been very upsetting. Some people are lucky to have healthy pregnancies after IF but be prepared that there could still be more issues down the road.
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,revangelfire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about the placenta previa! They told me I had this initially but wouldn't tell me if it was complete or not. Turns out it must not have been because at the anatomy scan it had moved. BUT it was really scary -- ended up in emergency after pacing a large clot and found out I had a tear in my placenta.... Anyways, long way to say, I understand your fears! I'm sorry you've got it, but really pleased to hear everything is still staying as it should.  Is the decreased activity driving you crazy?"
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Really hope the rest of your pregnancy is smooth and uneventful!   Well what's really bugging me is that I don't know what's ok and what's not ok. I wasn't given guidelines, just vaginal rest and ""take it easy"". Since I have had a cold this past week I didn't do anything really, but now that I am better what's ok? No exercise? 15 min walks? But I should still somehow be healthy? I don't plan on trying crazy exercises but I will likely try gentle short walks because I don't see how it could really hurt, with everything that I have read. And that way if I do bleed I will still be close to home.  Do you think that sounds reasonable?"
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,female_engineer_here,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"I think that sounds reasonable. Honestly, I think they don't know what is best! When I had the tear in my placenta I honestly don't know what caused it. We'd gone up to Victoria to tell my family so it was drive in a car, take the ferry, sit in someone's livingroom, drive to the next house. We didn't really do any walking, we didn't do any excersize, it was a really lazy weekend. ANd bam, bleeding. And yet, I'd done more than that on other weeks with no problems -- I have to go up and down a flight of stairs at work to go to the washroom or use the boardroom or to the staff kitchen, so other days  were more eventful.  So in someways, I sort of think they don't know what will prevent something from happening, and just want us to be as cautious as we can. For me, they originally told me not to do anything that would get my heartbeat going. Said no yoga even, but that walking (at a slow pace) would be fine.  I do think you're being reasonable, and at some point, we have to get out and do a few things -- I feel so weak from being on bedrest, so I'm sure my lack of muscle tone is just going to make other things hard!"
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,female_engineer_here,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I have read other stories where the baby kicked the placenta or the person was just sitting and eating when they suddenly started bleeding heavily. So I think you are right, they aren't sure what to do and yet it seems like it's not preventable, at least to a certain extent. I'm pretty week after this cold and taking it so easy on vacation, stairs make me winded! It can't be healthy either so I'm glad you agree that gentle walks should be fine."
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,motherofdragoons,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"We were very fortunate in that our first IVF attempt was successful. I wish I had known more about the blastocyst grades and that it was possible not to get any embryos to freeze though. I had assumed that any, or at least the majority of fertilized eggs would be available for transfer/freezing. Instead we had one pretty good blastocycst (high B), one borderline blastocyst (low B, high C), and no others left over. We transferred both (and thankfully both took!) but getting the call during our TWW that we had no blastocysts to freeze was terrifying.  We are still unexplained so I don't know if our infertility is related to the low blastocyst count/quality or if it was just a fluke.  Also, as someone who hates needles, the idea of the shots was scary. I certainly wouldn't say they were fun, but it was manageable. It got better as my husband learned to be quicker. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,MrsDragon,2,Tue Jul 14 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"Same here.  We had 12 embryos, basically a mixed bag of quality but I never did a lot of research about the quality and never understood it.  We transferred two, and I was pretty surprised that none of the remaining 10 made it to freeze.  With that many I was really hopeful we'd have some frozen!  It was very hard to know that if it failed, an FET wasn't possible."
InfertilityBabies,3dahqz,attackflamingo,2,Tue Jul 14 22:02:21 2015 UTC,"I'm with the other posters who mention some of the pain from ER.  It was not only the surgery (which kinda sucked), but the recovery for my ovaries.  I was bloated and they felt heavy and painful for a while after.    Also, I'm hydration obsessed, I usually carry water with me and I pee all the time.  But when they say full bladder for transfer, they mean FULL BLADDER.  Mine wasn't full enough so once they got me into that room they had to take me back out and make me walk around while drinking a bottle of water.  I felt pretty bad for wasting everyones time putting me in and out of the room twice (especially because my transfer was on a Sunday morning).  So, drink water until you really feel like you're going to pee your pants."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,healthylurker,3,Tue Jul 14 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"We registered for classes as if our due date was a month earlier. Then the twins came a month early, so we're actually still playgroup friends with one of our classmates! Unless you have a good reason to expect to go early (like twins) Id register for the ones they suggest so you can make friends with babies the same age.   That said, the classes were dumb. We spent two classes on female anatomy. Dude, I know where my cervix is already! I might feel differently if I'd used any of the birth stuff, but I had a c section."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,rbrvwv,2,Tue Jul 14 16:26:45 2015 UTC,Also expecting twins (12/24) and am debating childbirth class. I've ready that twins have a 75% c-section rate so I'm seriously thinking about not doing it... except for maybe a CPR class.  Do you feel that they helped you prepare for anything at all regarding the C-Section?
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,kml327,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"Not really. My A was breech all along. If your A turns, you might have a much better shot at a vaginal birth, so it might be worth hedging your bets?"
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,rbrvwv,3,Wed Jul 15 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can really take them too early unless you are worried about forgetting the information by the time you go into labor. And you never know! I was due at the beginning of February, signed up for classes starting at the end of November and never got to take any of them because I ended up on hospital bed rest at 27 weeks. :/ So personally I'd probably plan a little earlier for my next one (maybe 24ish weeks or so?) if I was going to take classes."

InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,effingeffstick,2,Tue Jul 14 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"We went to 4 evening classes, plus a Saturday CPR class when I was around 7.5 months.  I think it worked well because it was fresh in my mind and I didn't get overwhelmed with an 8-hour drink from the fire hose class."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,traveler5678,2,Tue Jul 14 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"I did the one day childbirth class and really loved it.  Our instructor really knew her stuff and my husband and I learned a lot from it.  We couldn't do the 4 week class because it was at the same time as a different class that I take.  I'm due Saturday and we took the class mid-May.  I definitely find that I need to review what we learned because it was a couple of months ago now, but if we had taken the next class offered (mid-June) I would have worried about going into labor before then.  I think taking the class from 10/13-11/3 sounds perfect.  They'll give you lots of take-home information so you can review that and practice in the interval between when the class ends and when you give birth.  Also keep in mind that when you are in labor, you'll have a nurse helping you - they won't expect you to have perfected the techniques on your own."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,RositaYouBitch,2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"We did the full day intensive class. It was a lot but with our work schedules it was necessary. I enjoyed the classes. I don't know that I learned a whole lot that blew my mind with knowledge but I did like having everything presented and organized. Plus it was comforting to realize how much I either already knew or at least seemed like common sense. We took ours when I was 32 weeks but I signed up at around 18 weeks. That was the only class open because they filled up so fast. You're not going to be too early going a month ahead. Plus, then you'll have those later weeks closer to your due date to focus on baby prep around the house."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,MrsDragon,2,Tue Jul 14 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"We took ours back in May and I'm not due until October. We did this for several reasons:   We wanted to stick with Saturday classes, and there were only so many Saturdays we had available which the classes also fell on. I wanted to take 4 classes (childbirth, parenting, csection, breastfeeding) and wanted to be able to spread them out. We're expecting twins so I'd rather have the info too early than too late.   I was around 18 weeks when we took them. Most people were between 32 and 38(!!) weeks. Our class included a tour of labor and delivery, which was really great to see, and those that were close to delivery could even pre-register so they would have less paperwork to do while in labor.   It worked out really well that we took them when we did. We completed the childbirth class and the first half of the parenting class before I went on bedrest. I'm still bummed we missed out on the other classes, but I feel like we got the most important stuff (how our hospital does things, newborn care, infant CPR).  I don't think those classes sound too early, I think it sounds about right. You'll want time to absorb what you learn."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,HerVoiceEchoes,2,Tue Jul 14 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"I took my class in early December. My son was due in late January and I didn't deliver until a week into February. I still had all the info fresh in my mind, especially because they sent me home with a book full of material and I flipped through it pretty often.  I don't think the class you want is too early. I'd go ahead and register for it because like you said, they fill up quick.  I did a one day class on a Saturday because I had hella exhaustion during my pregnancy and all of the series of classes would have been weeknights after work and I didn't think I could handle working eight hours, eating dinner, and going to a two hour class afterwards. I think I would have fallen asleep mid-class."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,shermanators_wife,2,Tue Jul 14 18:58:17 2015 UTC,Register early. I didn't get the info in time and the classes were already full until after my due date. :(

InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,Marie197,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"My OB/hospital doesn't let you take them prior to 32 weeks, so ~6 weeks before ""term"" at 38 weeks.  I think it's to help you connect with other patients who will be delivering around the same time, as well as to keep information fresh in your mind.  The classes they offer also include a tour of the labor and delivery ward."
InfertilityBabies,3d9lsk,robyn_sparkles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"I signed up for mine earlier than 18 weeks. My OB gave me a timetable for when to sign up for them but I wanted to time them with my SIL and my husband also has a wacky work schedule. So we are doing ours 2 months before due date. This is due in part to them not having the full schedule worked out yet so the class we were looking at didn't have an instructor scheduled so we had to choose an earlier one. Even though my hospital, like yours, recommends to sign up for the class ending 1 month prior to your due date. We decided to do the one day class instead of the 4-6 week night class so we didn't have to rearrange our schedule so many times. Because of this, we are going to a separate breastfeeding class (it's not covered in the one day version of the class)."

InfertilityBabies,3d9kgw,AwkwardOrangeHippo,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"My current shows are Asian dramas, so I doubt many people will find them of interest, but since you asked:   Hanasaki Mai ga Damattenai  (Mai Hanasaki Won't be Silenced/Won't Shut Up) is a Japanese drama about a woman who works as an ""assistor"" for the main office of a big Japanese bank. Basically she and her boss go handle any non-compliance or sticky bank issues with individual branches around the country. It's a typical ""plucky main character goes around solving everyone's problems while fighting The Man"" Japanese drama but that's the kind of fluff I'm into right now. Also it's kind of a big deal that she's a woman working for the home office of the bank. There are definite feminist undertones, which I find really cool (I did a lot of research on Japanese feminism in college). Oh My Ghost is a Korean drama about a meek/shy girl who gets possessed by a virgin ghost whose sole (pun intended) mission is to get laid by a ""man of vitality"" so she can go to heaven. Hijinks ensue! It's cute, but the pacing has been realllllllly slow at the beginning. There are signs that it will pick up next week though, so here's hoping.   The Jdrama isn't available to stream anywhere afaik. If anyone wanted to try out Oh My Ghost, it's on Dramafever."

InfertilityBabies,3d9kgw,Midonyah,2,Tue Jul 14 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"I can't get into Dr Who. I watched ""blink"" which was really good, so I tried watching more episodes, but they just felt like they went on forever.   Are there any other episodes you'd recommend to get me to try and stick it out?"
InfertilityBabies,3d9kgw,jaina_jade,2,Tue Jul 14 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"Ah. ""Blink"", although vastly considered one of the best episodes, is tricky. You can't really recommend it to somebody that doesn't know the series, because... it's not really a Doctor Who episode. You hardly see the Doctor at all, and to truly understand the implications of time-travel inside, it's better to have a little back-story about who the Doctor is.  So, true, it's a great episode, but not the one I'd recommend for first-time viewers.  I'll try to list a few that are good, represent the Doctor and what he stands for, and are.... Spoiler-free. I hope. Because there's no point in getting somebody in a TV show by spoiling it all away in the first viewing.  I think the best place to start is with the 2005 reboot. The series has been running for 50 years, so the main characters is actually the Ninth Doctor (the Doctor regenerates and the lead actor changes, along with his personality one in a while). After watching the reboot, you can have fun, go back in time and watch it from the beginning, but I'd wait a bit and see if you really get into it, as those 50 years of viewing can be tedious, and some of those old episodes are... well, old.  The 2005 relaunch is a good starting point. However, season 5 which is the first season with Matt Smith as the Doctor is also a good starting point. The Doctor just got a new regeneration, so it's a new face, and a new companion. They wrote it such that this season is a good jump on point for new people, with less continuity going back to the last few seasons.  Let's give it a go:   The Doctor Dances / The empty child (Series one, Ninth Doctor, Series 1, episode 10) You get to meet the Doctor, see him save what's important to him, see him goof around and also be dead-serious, the episode introduces some great characters and has scary moments. The girl in the Fireplace (Tenth Doctor, Series 2, episode 4) A little wibbly-wobbly time-travelling with feelings and droids (along with a sense of the Doctor's character--the boyishness and the loneliness) The Eleventh Hour (Eleventh Doctor, Series 5, Episode 1) Intended as a ""break in continuity"" (usually either the Doctor or the Companion from the previous ""era"" sticks around, you hardly ever change both at the same time), this episode can be a great first-timer. New Doctor, new personality, new screwdriver, hardly any references to the past series, you don't feel like plunging into the middle of a show without any idea who the characters are, or what they're doing here. Vincent and the Doctor (Eleventh Doctor, Series 5, Episode 10) After watching stuff about droids and time-travelling madness and earth-invading aliens, it's also nice to make new viewers watch that the Doctor can also bring some joy and feelings in some episodes, and that you do not need a big time-war full of galaxies exploding to make a great episode. Bonus: Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead (Tenth Doctor, Series 4, Episodes 8 & 9   I put those as a bonus because they're not ""introduction episodes"", but still really important and meaningful. Watch them after you've watched the first ones, if you're still unsure.  All of those episodes are available on Netflix. Series 8 (the latest) is available on Netflix Canada. The rest should be available wherever you are. Or just download the whole thing, maybe find some streaming site where you can watch those.  Every whovian has their own list of episodes to show first-time viewers, but a lot of us tend to forget that most of us started with watching the 2005 reboot's first episode, which is frankly not one of the best, and we stuck around after that, watching anything and everything, up until the 50 years old episodes, and we love it! So really, watch a few episodes, the ones I've recommended or simply... I dunno, the ones with cool titles (Dinosaurs on a spaceship? The Vampires of Venice? Let’s Kill Hitler?!?), maybe the ones with the Doctor you find the most attractive, the ones with ominous cruel and serious villains, or the ones with green farting aliens and burping garbage bins.... It really doesn't matter.  I truly feel that the show has something in it for everyone, and that you can find something great in what others don't really enjoy. For example, I do not like the latest series 8. But I've had so much fun during the previous ones, which others did not enjoy as much, that I feel it's my time to step down and let others have their favorite Doctor, or favorite Companion have a little sunlight. I don't mind, we're all fans anyway, that's what's so great about the diversity!  So enjoy yourself, watch some episodes, like it or don't, it doesn't matter, and keep on enjoying life and having fun! \o/"

Oh, yeah -- on the rare occasion I have a lot of free time during the day, I've been watching season 1 of outlander."

InfertilityBabies,3d9kgw,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:38 2015 UTC,We really don't watch much TV.  We also only have crappy cable so when we do it's either food shows like master chef and hells kitchen or animal planet reality shows like north woods law and river monsters.  We do try to watch movies on my kindle together in bed sometimes but usually can never agree on what to watch... So it always winds up being Austin Powers and we fall asleep halfway through.  My hotel though did have hbo on demand and I managed to get hooked on true detective.  I binge watched season one over the course of a couple days.  I also watched a few episodes of game of thrones but couldn't really get into it.  As for porn... I don't know what you are taking about. I'm as innocent as a baby lamb

InfertilityBabies,3db208,Pamzella,2,Tue Jul 14 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"I traveled at the height of morning sickness (later diagnosed with HG). I was on Zofran, but I was still stupidly working with my insurance's default prescription requirements that left me with 9 pills every 8 days. I wasn't really vomiting but I barely was eating and was miserable all the time.  I traveled to a conference for work via train at 8 weeks. I don't know what I was thinking. I spent the whole time sick as a dog, and now I have a Pavlovian nausea response every time the topic of the conference comes up. :( But somehow I managed it.  I always made sure I had ginger chews with me and crackers. Somehow I powered through it, which to me seems almost unbelievable given at that point I spent most of my weekends in bed. Being prepared did help, not only to keep my nausea ok enough to not be obvious to my bosses, but somehow psychologically.  I know this isn't specifically helpful, but I guess I just want to say it's possible to do! And your steps at being prepared now will help! Good luck!"

InfertilityBabies,3d9s2e,reo12312,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"They do! One of my twins was an expanded blast, the other was early :-)"
InfertilityBabies,3d9s2e,rbrvwv,2,Tue Jul 14 18:03:33 2015 UTC,Yay! Thanks
InfertilityBabies,3d9s2e,enchilada83,2,Tue Jul 14 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"Hi there, in embryology terms, a pre-implantation embryo is considered an early blastocyst when the blastocele (inner cavity full of liquid) is smaller than 50% of the size of the embryo. So, if you were to look at it under a microscope, you would see a a little ball (of cells) with what seems like a clear hole on one of the halves. If the hole doesn't reach the ""ecuator"" of the ball, it is consider an early blastocyst. If the hole reaches to the ecuator or further, so the ball looks like a plump balloon, then it is a blastocyst. Also, a hatched blastocyst (or expanded) is when the blastocyst is getting ready for the invasion phase, so it gets out of the zona pellucida (protein encasing leftover from the egg) and it is ready for implantation. Now, since there are actually conditions which can prevent a blastocyst from getting out of the zona, thus impeding implantation, an expanded blast is considered to have more chances to implant in your endometrium, because they have overcome one more crucial step. However, that does not mean an early blastocyst can not end up implanting. They are just considered developmentally delayed, but they can still catch up, get out of their encasing and implant succesfully. In some cases, it is known why this delay in early development happens, and it is usually a sign that there is a lower chance of implantation. But at the end of the day, the possibility is still there. Hope this helps and best of luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3d9s2e,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure what the formal definition of ""early"" is, but one of our two blastocysts was borderline ready to transplant, and both took. :)"

Anyway, it wasn't so bad, just boring.  Hope yours is uneventful.  Edit:  My tip is to drink lots of water during if they allow you to.  Staves off that really gross feeling.  We moved Baby A out of our in-room bassinet and into her nursery crib for sleep last night . . . . And she still slept through the night.  Success!!  Then we moved Baby B into the bassinet (previously I had been sleeping with him in the the guest room while he was in a swing do as not to wake up his twin since he woke so often) and he slept in a 6.5 hour block and only woke once to feed.  What is this magic that is happening???  In other news, I had to switch away from The Honest Company for our supplemental formula since it was constipating them.  I'm now feeding them imported European formula and I feel like a total pretentious douche doing it, haha.  But whatever, they absolutely love it and it doesn't smell gross AND it mixes perfectly in the Baby Brezza (which HC didn't) so I call it a win."

InfertilityBabies,3d8y7s,septicidal,3,Tue Jul 14 16:23:44 2015 UTC,Pregnancy brain lingers. I ordered a crib mattress from BRU online...and shipped it to my California address. I hadn't updated the billing address for our credit cards so somehow I must have used the billing address as shipping too. Sigh...and it's being delivered today so I don't know what to do. I'm hoping my change of address catches it and sends it down here to Florida. Otherwise my old neighbor is going to grab it and we'll figure it out from there.

Also going through episodes of boob strike, I'm pretty sure that's induced by the pain. It still feels like a knife right through my heart every time he turns his head and cries when I try to latch him. There's no rhyme or reason or a pattern...

My mom left this morning, concluding her two week visit. Despite some odd comments and annoyances, it went pretty well, which is good. Lots of stuff got done and we ended on a high note attempting to use her selfie stick to take silly pictures. : ) Still, the house is so blissfully quiet today and this introvert is soaking it up.  The boys are kicking much more, both more often and harder and they are regularly making my stomach jump, which is fun to watch. When we can get the timing right, my husband can really feel them, but for the most part it's my own personal gymnastics show. It's kinda awesome. : ) (Except for last night when Baby A decided my bladder was an excellent punching bag. Oof. Aim higher baby!)"
InfertilityBabies,3d8y7s,septicidal,2,Tue Jul 14 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"Ugh, the three hour is horrible.  You only have to fast for 8 hours beforehand.  My OB said it was fine to drink water after drinking the glucose stuff.  Tell them if you feel icky, and ask if there's a quiet place you can lie down after drinking the stuff.  If you puke it up you either have to do the entire test over again on a different day or monitor blood sugar at home 4x a day for 2+ weeks, which is a pain in the butt and the test strips for the glucose meter are expensive.  Edited to add:  Today is a stupidly bad nausea day.  I took Reglan AND Zofran, on top of my reflux medications, and I am still struggling not to puke.  This is the pits.  I just want to lie down but have to get things done at work.  On the upside, my kitchen is formally under construction! Hopefully after today, they will be able to start putting things together (today is electrical and plumbing rough-in, and then the building inspector has to sign off on both before insulation and drywall go back up).  I also applied veneer to two cabinets last night and didn't screw it up! I was worried I would botch it but I think it came out really nicely."

I figure if things turn out very nicely I can see about taking better photos of the finished process.  It's amazing to me how easily construction projects get delayed - it's all explainable in one way or another, but I wish more contractors would just over-estimate the time needed to complete it instead of giving an unrealistic timeline.  Things ALWAYS come up to delay things.  I feel like our contractor was very realistic about the timeline for everything and my husband keeps thinking it will take LESS time, when really that's not going to happen.

My cell phone is a great example of this as is one of our calphalon pots.    We had a major communication issue between the PM and the lead contractor, if not for that we would have finished on time.  The biggest issue were our floating shelves, PM said they wouldn't be an issue and to buy x brackets while lead contract said they were way too heavy and would never work blah blah blah.

Or the last week or two might be tolerable enough to manage at home.  I think the most frustrating part of our renovation will actually be the down time between getting the cabinets installed and getting the new counters in, since the sink can't been hooked up and the backsplash can't be done until the counters are in place. But in the meantime, we will have most of our regular living space back because the new cabinets won't be taking up room and the fridge can go back to its normal location.  I see a lot of grilled food in my future, though..."

InfertilityBabies,3d66oj,magooey,3,Mon Jul 13 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"We had a routine, but not in the sense that everything happened at the same exact time every day (i.e. wake up at 7, eat at 7:30, sleep at 10, etc), but that we would have around the same span of time between each ""thing."" For example, the routine would be wake up, eat, play until we hit ~1-1.5 hours of awake time (this was all she could handle), nap, rinse, repeat until bed time (usually around 6-7). In a way it was ""baby led"" because the timing depended on when she woke up, and also if she was hungry at a weird time or sleepy early, I would just go ahead and feed her or put her down for a nap. It was a ""flexible schedule"" based around her sleep schedule (which I based loosely on the book The Sleepeasy Solution, which we used for sleep training).   We did baby led weaning/feed on demand all the way, though I didn't read any books on it or anything. It just seemed natural for us to do it that way. When it came to introducing solids, at 6 months I did sit her down with me at least twice a day to have her try out foods. Since the goal at that point was just to get her used to the idea of eating food and not actually getting a ton of nutrition from it, I didn't go out of my way to make sure she was super hungry at these times and I think they did tend to be around the same time every day (can't remember exactly).  Not sure if any of that is helpful at all... For us, figuring out the sleep schedule just kind of made all the other stuff fall into a routine that we stuck to pretty well.

There is a schedule in the sense that he goes to bed and wakes around the same time every day (he's so used to it our weekends now mimic our weekdays). We start our bed routine at 8. We do bath time, move into his dim lit room and dry off then a lavender lotion massage. We offer a bottle, usually he's due for a bottle, if not we offer one and he eats what he wants and that's it. We rock for a little of the bottle didn't put him out. If none of this puts him completely out he will pass out within minutes of hitting the bed.   For the most part he's fallen into a slight routine through the day as well, but we don't push it. I feel like he'll sleep and eat when he feels like it."

InfertilityBabies,3d66oj,Zoraptera,2,Tue Jul 14 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"I'd be a little happier with a little more structure, too, but we're definitely baby-led right now.  Roughly, Zed's schedule looks like this:  7:00 - 7:30 -- Wake up. 8:00 - 8:45 -- Playtime and snuggles, sometimes a walk. 9:00 - 9:30 -- Nap #1!  If I'm lucky this is an hour long.  If not, a half-hour.  Sometimes this is on me. 10:15 - 10:45 -- Often this is where the walk happens. 11:15 - 11:30 -- Nap #2!  Again, if I'm lucky it's an hour, if not, a half-hour.  Usually he takes this one in his crib. 12:00 or so -- More playtime and snuggles. 1:30 or so -- Nap #3!  If he's going to have a long one, this is usually it. 3:00 - 3:30 -- Playtime, snuggles... if I'm going to get overwhelmed and stressed, this is when it happens. 3:30 - 4:30 -- Mr. Z gets home and gives me a baby break.  Sometimes we go for a walk together! 4:30 -- Last call for naps.  If we don't get him down around here, we might not get him down before bedtime, which can be harrying. 7:00 - 7:30 -- Baby bedtime!  Add nursing before and after every nap, before bed, and usually during some of the playtime sessions.  We nurse a lot.  I am often willing to let him nap right on a boob if it happens to be naptime and he falls asleep, because he spent the first four months of his life not napping during the day at all, and that sucked."
InfertilityBabies,3d66oj,Aventurijn,2,Tue Jul 14 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"R goes to daycare full-time. That means that we leave the house at 7.20 AM and we follow a strict schedule because we have to. At 6 months, the schedule was as follows:  06:00 - 06:30 -- Wake up, diaper change, getting dressed, etc. 06:45 - 07:20 -- Food! (bottle) + playtime, getting ready to leave the house  (we take the bus, he loves it) 07:45 ---------- Drop-off at daycare 07:45 - 09:00 -- Playtime at daycare, crawling around, etc. 09:00 - 10:00 -- Nap #1 10:30 ---------- Food! (solids, vegetable puree + soup) 10:30 - 12:30 -- Playtime! 12:30 - 14:00 -- Nap #2 14:30 ----------  Food! (solids, fruit puree) 14:30 - 16:30 -- Playtime! 16:30 - 17:00 -- Nap #3 (which he skipped, 50% of the time) 17:30 ---------- SO picks up R from daycare 18:00 ---------- Food! (bottle) 19:00 - 19:30 -- Baby bedtime! (+ sometimes extra bottle)    For us, the schedule helps. We are not that strict about it (neither is the daycare, thankfully) and we deviate up to a half an hour/an hour or so depending on whether or not he's really hungry or sleeply or rather wants to play. If one nap extends for half an hour, we extend the entire schedule for half an hour, etc. But it gives some structure to the day and I like structure because I then at least know what he's crying about if he cries. I can look at the time and go (Oh, I bet he's hungry/tired). If he skips his nap #3 and gets crappy at 6 PM, we know that it is because he's tired and not necessarily hungry.  It works for us and R seems to be happy (the downside is that he tends to get up at 6 AM on Saturdays and Sundays too, but I can live with that because he at least sleeps through the night)  EDIT: also, regarding parents. When R had the chicken pox recently and my parents watched him because he was not allowed to go to daycare, they asked me for his schedule because they then at least knew what to do and when to do it. I also told them that they could deviate from it as it happens, but it gave them something to 'hang on to'. They felt more supported if I provided them with the schedule. I guess it made them feel more secure, and less ""OMG what am I doing with this grandchild - it has been so long since I did any of it!"""
InfertilityBabies,3d66oj,larabair,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:17:32 2015 UTC,"I thought we were all over the goddamn place - I'd feed him when he was hungry, put him to bed when he was tired, etc. My mom spent a day with BB though and documented everything that happened (it was before daycare started).  Then a friend spent the next day and did the same.  I sat down and carefully looked over it - and he already had a routine without us doing anything!   Our rough routine is nap every two hours, offer boob right after waking and whenever he's being very ""whingey"" as Mr. B puts it, and ensure to change diapers every 2 hours during the day."

In addition to my 100% unpaid leave (during which I will need to pay OOP for my benefits, FUCK YOU EMPLOYER), my partner teaches adjunct and so either would have had to start a semester right when the baby is due and work through or take the entire thing off.

I agree that academia can be awful with regard to benefits.  It is an especially brutal system for adjuncts.    If I were having my baby during the semester I would have to use my sick leave as maternity leave, but I would not have to pay OOP for benefits, which makes a world of difference.  Luckily, I'm having the baby during the summer so I am just taking an unpaid summer and will return when the semester starts, when the baby will be ~7 weeks old.  I would like to spend more time with her but I would have to use my sick leave, and my husband is a contract worker w/o any benefits or leave, so I need to save my sick leave in case the baby gets sick during the semester.    Your employer sounds like quite the asshole too.  Making you pay OOP for benefits during your unpaid leave is a slap in the face.

Our nanny-helper will be here at 330 so I can join in for my company meeting at 4. I'm so nervous. Pond will not take a bottle. We worked on it all weekend with several different bottles and nipples and he just refuses. He kicks the nipples out of his mouth with his tongue and/or he chews on them. He just won't latch on and suck. I hope maybe if a stranger is trying instead of my husband or me that might make a difference. Ugh..I don't know what I'm going to do if I can't work because I need to feed him. :/
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,RositaYouBitch,2,Mon Jul 13 15:33:46 2015 UTC,I've heard that sometimes babies will take a bottle if mom isn't around. like they can smell the milk or something.   Hopefully you have a smooth transition.
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 13 15:39:05 2015 UTC,Sometimes he'll do ok for my husband if I leave the room but it still takes forever to get even just an ounce into him. He plays around and fights and fusses and will suck here and there for maybe a minute or so. Maybe we need practice? I read online about people that basically got into a battle of wills with their kid and waited it out until the kid gave in and ate from the bottle. But he seems so little to stress him out like that. I don't know.
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,Zoraptera,2,Mon Jul 13 15:46:33 2015 UTC,"I get it, but he wont turn away the bottle just to prove a point to you, like some angsty teen ;) He'll take it if he absolutely has to. If you're not around and he's hungry, I'm sure he'll eventually get it. I used to struggle when babysitting my nephew. My SIL didn't/couldn't pump so he had formula for those few feeds. He wouldn't take it initially, but after a bit of a struggle he figured it was better than starving, even if it wasn't his first choice of food."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,PrincessCBHammock,2,Mon Jul 13 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"That's comforting to hear from someone I know, not just a random internet story. Thank you"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,kat_loves_tea,2,Mon Jul 13 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"If he really really won't do a bottle (and remember, he's got to LEARN that the plastic nipple gives him food - it's totally different and weird, right?), you could try a cup. A friend of mine's kiddo is 3 days younger than Isaac, and he WILL NOT do a bottle, but he'll drink from a cup (with help, obviously!). People have also used spoons. If you need them, you have options! http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/feeding-tools/alternative-feeding/  I hope the meeting goes okay!"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,DisembodiedJen,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"What /u/pamplemousse2 said.  Cups (medicine cups!), spoons, even finger-feeding with a little tube.  There are many things that have worked for babies, even very stubborn babies!"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,RositaYouBitch,2,Tue Jul 14 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily a battle of wills -- if you're going back to work, it is how he's going to need to feed (unless he can hold out till nighttime). If the outcome of fussing and struggling = mom comes home with the boob, then he learns the bottle is not a necessary part of life."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,jaina_jade,2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Good luck! Hopefully nanny will have some tips or tricks, I agree with seeing if he'll take it if you're out of the room."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,jaina_jade,2,Mon Jul 13 15:48:49 2015 UTC,"Good luck today, mama! I agree with the others, it might help if you're away so he knows this is what's available. Plus he might learn to associate it with the nanny, ya know? Mama gives it fresh from the tap which is awesome, but the other nice lady has a pretty good bottle service, kind of thing?"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 13 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"I had that same issue with my child when she started daycare. What helped us was using the same kind of bottle for all feedings (Tommee Tippee), having her father feed her while I am not in the room, and giving her a bottle during the weekend to keep her used to it. She did lose a pound initially, but she is now back to what she was and is taking bottles like a champ. Also, the daycare wraps her up in the same blanket each time they feed her and I think that has helped as well since it is a blanket that I wrap her up in when she is home. I hope that helps :)"

InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,MrsDragon,7,Tue Jul 14 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"I'm thrilled that I'm pregnant, beyond grateful that I'm pregnant - but I'm fucking tired of throwing up!!!  The only thing keeping me from going bonkers is the fact that baby has taken to kicking right after I get sick which I take as an ""I'm sorry mommy, I love you"" sort of thing.  Still, I want to put on an outfit and not have to wonder if it will hide any potential vomit stains - tho good practice for the future."

InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,traveler5678,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:47 2015 UTC,thank you - i just feel that I somehow lost my right to complain about pregnancy.
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,jaina_jade,6,Mon Jul 13 15:23:54 2015 UTC,"Nope nope nopenopenope you totally get to complain about the shittiness of pregnancy. Just because you want to be pregnant does NOT mean you have to enjoy throwing up.  Think about it this way - let's say you want to buy a car. You're sick of taking the bus an hour and a half each way for the commute, you really want to buy a car. You finally buy it! You're ready for payments, insurance, gas, parking... and then after only 10 000 miles it needs thousands of dollars of repairs. Is that a part of car ownership? Sure... but it doesn't happen to most people, and it still really sucks. No one would tell you that you should enjoy THAT, right?  <3"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:05 2015 UTC,that is a great way of looking at it - thank you.  I just keep getting crap from family (not husband) about how I signed up for this.  I totally signed up for pregnancy and the normal symptoms - I sure as hell don't remember signing up for HG and if I did then I demand to see those forms!
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,jaina_jade,2,Mon Jul 13 18:02:20 2015 UTC,"I vote that anyone who plays the ""but you signed up for this"" card gets moved to a ""tiny doses"" person or a ""no doses"" person until after the baby is born. Wanting a child does not mean you want (or deserve!) to deal with HG. /u/pamplemousse2 's analogy is spot on."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"RIGHT? No, you actually DIDN'T sign up for this!  I'm really sorry you're getting crap from people."

InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,TigFan15,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:15:20 2015 UTC,"I'm already doing that with the diclegis and the zofran - when they tested the reglan in the hospital it didn't work.  Currently, I take 1 diclegis when I wake up, then a zofran at 10, then diclegis at 2pm (optional zofran), another zofran at 6pm, and then 2 diclegis at 10pm (optional something else that I can't remember but stronger than zofran).   To make things even more ""fun"" my insurance will only give me 12 zofran at a time, so constantly going to the pharmacy to get more."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,jaina_jade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my insurance is fighting me on the Zofran and only allowed me 9 pills to begin with.  I find with Reglan, it takes over an hour for me to really feel a difference but it does provide some improvement."

Sorry I couldn't respond to people on my last post - I was to busy preventing her from feeding our 3 month olds Apple pie and ice cream; defending naps and breastfeeding choices; and explaining why I'm not letting them cry to strengthen their lungs. ALL TRUE THINGS!!! Omg. So glad it's over.  Today an ant exterminator is coming so I have to prep the house and get kids out of it.

Hearing her sing her ABC's at the top of her lungs to her new baby sister was completely priceless! I loved it!   Can I just say... my husband is so amazing!! last night he wanted me to get some sleep, so he took care of Dominic, woke me up every three hours to pump, cleaned all the pump parts/bottles in between uses, and let me catch up on my sleep. Around 4:30 he finally came to bed, got Dominic into the bassinet, and he actually slept in there for another 2 hours! So I was in bed from 9:30-6:30 (and sleep most of it, other than pumping times!!) and I feel pretty fabulous today!! I married a keeper... he's amazing!!  The only thing that is kind of stressing me out right now is my milk supply. I'm JUST pumping enough for him for each feeding session, and he's not doing well on the boob. I'm trying to do a ton of skin to skin time, and I'm trying to pump longer and longer each time to convince my boobs I need more. I found some Mothers Milk tea, so I'm going to try that, and maybe make some lactation cookies. Any other tips and tricks??  Edit: bonus baby skin time photo!!. Sweet face!!"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 13 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"have you tried power pumping?  10 min on, 10 min off x3, I did that twice a day for a few weeks and it helped.  Then I switched to doing the power pump just once a day.  Other than the power pumping I religiously pumped every 3 hours for 15 minutes for the first 2 months.  Jude never did take the boob, good luck."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,bandgeek_foreves,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:03:51 2015 UTC,I've never heard of power pumping. Maybe I'll give that a try! I think Nicky will end up taking the Boob more often as he gets a bit older. I have to keep reminding myself he is ONLY term now... 37 weeks...

And honestly putting baby to the boob even if you do end up pumping instead for that feed, something about the hormones with crying baby trying to get on the boob makes your body go ""oh no!! Gotta crank out some more milk!"".   I still ended up supplementing 4oz a day for the first year. I did everything I could to move heaven and earth to make more milk and that's where I ended up. Good luck!"

And remember that your supply is still ramping up! And yeah, getting that baby on the boob as much as possible. AND remember that the pump is NOT as effective at baby at getting the milk out - so there's more milk there than the pump will show you (which he can only get if he gets better at BF, but try to remember the pump doesn't necessarily show the whole story).  YAY for your husband. AWESOME job!"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,bandgeek_foreves,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:29:07 2015 UTC,I didn't realise the pump wasn't as effective. We haven't tried breastfeeding at every feed.... But I am going to now when I can. It's time to crank this into full great!!

Next on the list is applying veneer to the sides of two of the cabinets, then priming and painting the veneer to match the doors.  If I have enough veneer left over, I'll also apply it to the side of one of the cabinets (which will only be visible when the stove is out of place, but for the sake of my own sanity I'll do it anyway).  I had to get a respirator so I can safely use the contact cement for the veneer, oil-based primer, and enamel paint.

InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,larabair,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"Cloth as an item of consumption can be overwhelming, but remember babies don't even NEED diapers -- adults do. If you have something reasonably absorbent, like old t-shirts, and something to prevent a big leak, like a felted sweater, it'll work. Everything else is just cake. I speak from having the most widely varied diaper stash of anyone I've ever met, and I found most styles useful at some point for something. Seriously, cheap-o prefolds and covers will work beautifully 96% of the time.  But if you want to know, the simplex diapers by Blueberry are my favorite favorite for fit, home-washing, line-drying, and cuteness. Expensive and sized, so they'd be pricy for an entire stash, but I LOVE them."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 13 14:49:51 2015 UTC,Your first sentence makes me feel much better!  I think the first thing I try will be pre-folds and covers because of the cost.  I've decided to hold off on any of the more expensive options until we know the baby's size and whether cloth diapering will work for us.

Pockets are annoying to worry about stuffing and if your little is like mine and a heavy wetter, you'll have to spring for bamboo inserts because pockets come with microfiber.

InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,larabair,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:01:14 2015 UTC,Thank you!  These are very cute and I like the size range.  Do you need to buy extra inserts for the diapers or could I start with the inserts the diapers come with?
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,traveler5678,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"They come with both a newborn size and a regular, both bamboo (dark colors will include charcoal bamboo), they snap in place and the newborn stacks onto the regular size for easy doubling.

InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"I'm planning to at least partially cloth diaper (after the newborn phase, I figure there will be enough insanity to deal with and my husband is a little scared of cloth diapering) and figured out that my biggest limiting factor is my washing machine.  We have an all-in-one washer/dryer that is great but takes longer to dry and I want to limit the bulk that goes in the washer.  This eliminates all-in-ones and pockets, so I'm planning on pre-folds and covers... Bonus - prefolds and covers are cheapest!  And easy to customize with soaker inserts, etc. depending on what you need.  The few people I know in real life who have cloth diapered have wound up doing prefolds and covers at least part of the time.  I'm planning to use disposables when outside the house or on trips to limit having to carry around dirty diapers, but I should still save money in the long run and cut down on a lot of trash, which are my main goals with cloth diapering."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,messofletters,2,Mon Jul 13 15:20:55 2015 UTC,Check out diaper lab! They have an experiment to own program so you could play with other kinds without the commitment. We also loved their newborn diaper rental program!
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,curiouslywanting,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"Flats are much easier to dry (and line-dry in a snap), and I think they're way underused. Easy to pair with soaker pads, work EXTREMELY well with snappis (sometimes they don't catch the prefolds as well), and can be used with bigger babies/toddlers. Just a plug if your washing & drying is limited :)"

InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,Zoraptera,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:33:20 2015 UTC,"Fully agree with lance.   While he was bitty bitty, we liked infant (not newborn) prefolds and covers. We would fold down the front or back and secure with a snappi. For nighttime we rotated between a size 1 thirsties and a size 1 bamboozle fitted, and often put in soakers as he got bigger. I recommend you invest in two newborn covers - they will fit much better than one-sizes until they grow!  Now that BB is bigger we use Best Bottoms and snap inserts for daycare, GMD prefolds and fitteds for home, bamboozle and kissaluv fitteds for bedtime, and a variety of different covers (plus my mommy keeps sewing more!) Newborn and infant prefolds are now way too small, so we mostly use them as burp cloths.   Also - best bottoms are very similar to lilhelpers (a la panda). We bought them through our local cloth diaper store because we want to support them - but if they weren't around we probably would have gone with these!"
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,Iamagnu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"Good to know about the infant size (esp. since I'm anticipating a good-sized baby) and I had never heard about of snappis before.  I am definitely going to order some!  I'm a little confused about the covers - are the thirsties and bamboozles considered covers, or do you use separate covers in addition to them?  Thank you for the advice!"

They're a little pricey for being a pocket system, but their resale is amazing, and those ruffles are just too cute! Plus the community is really warm and friendly, but kind of fanatical.   And for washing, check out Fluff Love University to get your diapers squeaky clean. Don't fall for the ""cloth diaper safe"" detergents, you need real soap, Tide is great and it wont cost near as much as what those cloth diaper ones do!   don't be afraid to buy used, you can save a lot of money that way, and just have fun!

So... what do you stuff with? Hahaha. And do you use them as pockets or as covers (I've only used them as pockets but apparently that's not the only way?)  Also, what design is that? I've just got a couple of solids so far."
InfertilityBabies,3d4jzy,Iamagnu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"I use them as pockets, and I use the ACs 2ply bamboo trifolded during the day. No leaks yet, but while using the microterry inserts we would get some compression leaks while he was in his carseat. I don't really like using microfibre anyway, so we sold those.  Overnight we use a bamboo booster folded in half and stuffed in the front of the trifolded 3ply and still no leaks overnight (we have a tummy sleeper)  You could try the burrito fold with a 3ply since he's a heavy wetter, and you'll get more absorbency up front.

Sometimes I wish they had a little more support, but the support is pretty good considering there's not underwire.  I ordered mine on Amazon.

Also yes to having a hard time with pooping - I feel more burpy than usual some days and my boobs hurt off and on. For me I feel anything I am experiencing is due to the estrogen patches and progesterone shots and doesn't really feel like true pregnancy symptoms yet. My first ultrasound is next Monday.   We did IVF with ICSI and PGS so I feel pretty confident we are going to have a good ultrasound and see a baby growing in there but it would be reassuring if I felt something more - that feeling is exactly how I'm feeling too. I was pregnant once two years ago but we lost the baby at 5 weeks - I felt nauseous one day (which probably was from being excited/scared) so I really don't have much to go off of either.

That's another thing that makes me optimistic, despite not having symptoms. And I don't get the chalky suppository residue. Hearing that I got to stop doing those was almost as great as finding out my betas were positive!   Good luck to you!"
InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,traveler5678,2,Mon Jul 13 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"I actually had no symptoms my entire first trimester.  I really wished I had symptoms for reassurance so I completely understand where you're coming from, but rest assured that a lack of symptoms doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem!"

InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,healthylurker,2,Mon Jul 13 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I didn't have any symptoms at the beginning of the second trimester except for a belly that was beginning to grow.  I am sitting here at 39 weeks still feeling fine, but with a huge bump now.  I think some people just don't have many symptoms."
InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:11 2015 UTC,I'm hopeful this will be me but I probably jinxed it with this post... ;) Good luck on your upcoming adventure!
InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,dutchqueen,2,Tue Jul 14 03:35:17 2015 UTC,"I had no symptoms that early. It was frustrating because I would go crazy symptom spotting while ttc, but then when I FINALLY got pregnant there was nothing. For example I used to stare at and analyze my nipples to see if they were dark. When I finally was pregnant, they weren't any darker. Lol! The waiting for the ultrasound sucks but it's still a much happier wait than the two-week-wait. :)  Edit - Colace didn't work for me but metamucil did."
InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,dancer331,2,Mon Jul 13 21:01:50 2015 UTC,"Ha! I know. In the TWW, it was all symptom-spotting. Now I'm like, where are all these SYMPTOMS I've heard about? I'm trained to spot them so...let's go! A saner person would, I imagine, be GRATEFUL that they feel so great, but not this little anxiety-riddled lady!"
InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,jaina_jade,2,Mon Jul 13 21:05:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't feel pregnant at all in the beginning. Just a little bit of sore boobs, but I usually got that before my period was about to begin. Cramping and sharp shooting pains were probably my first real symptom, but besides that I honestly didn't feel much until week 8 (that's when my morning sickness kicked in.. and it was just extreme nausea, no puking).  I always thought then when I finally got pregnant, I would KNOW and it would feel so different. For me, it wasn't like that. Even now at 18 weeks, I often don't feel pregnant.   Enjoy the lack of symptoms for now - they're coming! :)"

InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,sroethele,2,Tue Jul 14 03:34:24 2015 UTC,"I never had morning sickness/bloating/etc. (I feel sicker now than I ever did early on).  My biggest issues were being tired (all the time), headaches from ~10-13w, and then at 16w I developed some heartburn.  No boob issues, even the bathroom issue was temporary!  Drink lots of water! I've also been taking a metamucil-like substance every day since the beginning, just in case.  I have no idea if it helped, because I haven't NOT taken it...  And, welcome :)"

It's a blessing and a curse. I'm 8w4d today and have a whole lot of nothing. Some sore boobs off and on but I still expect my period to start anyday just because nothing feels different. My doctor says I'm lucky to have no symptoms with twins, but I totally get the level of anxiety that builds up."
InfertilityBabies,3d5tqe,Ishslittleone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:22:52 2015 UTC,That must be a total trip. I hope you either get a few reassuring twinges (just enough!) and/or get out of the anxiety zone of the first trimester soon.
InfertilityBabies,3d57ou,237millilitres,4,Mon Jul 13 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to comment on what you wrote over at /r/infertility over here.  I don't feel like I belong over there, though I don't feel like I belong here much of the time anymore, I probably belong most at /r/secondaryinfertility now, but I'm in a weird limbo.  Anyway, enough about me.  I've been through all of this.  I was here on day one when this was started.  This was started as the place to go after you got the positive test.  We felt bad talking about our anxieties about finally getting pregnant on /r/infertility but we were too anxious for /r/babybumps and /r/cautiousbb wasn't a thing at the time.  Now I have a nearly 2 year old and much of the topics here are pregnancy and newborn related.  Everything goes by so fast, I have a harder time relating to the newborn stuff with my toddler who defies me by putting his feet up on the table.  And I have a hard time reading about pregnancy again, secondary infertility is more painful than expected.  I have a hard time understanding the cautiousness that would make a person with a newly positive test anxious to post here.  But at the same time I get it, there are so many more people here than when I started.  When I started we were all pregnant and scared, posting here with beta results wasn't weird at all.  And we were so supportive if there was a loss.  Now there's so many people, it's started to feel like announcing to strangers which no one wants to do for a while after a loss or feeling like this could never happen.  So those are my thoughts, as a person who has been here a long time to see the ebb and flow.  Maybe the group needs to be fractured, maybe what you need is similar to a due date group, a small group of people to become friends with due around the same time, like how I felt when this subreddit was started.  Or maybe it all needs to stay together.  Whatever you decide to do, I wish you luck."
InfertilityBabies,3d57ou,Peachmaru,3,Tue Jul 14 02:31:37 2015 UTC,OK I commented in /r/infertility by accident because you didn't say it was cross-posted! Now I feel like I shouldn't have posted there

I know this is anecdotal but my daughter was born at 34 weeks exactly and you would never be able to tell now at 1.5 years. I know many others with very similar stories, too. And the statistics are good."
InfertilityBabies,3d2al2,honmamichin,2,Mon Jul 13 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes, I'm so happy to be past 34 weeks which is when my doctor said she would stop trying to prevent me from going into labor (I've been having lots of contractions along the way). The last few weeks are so hard for me, it's really ramping up my anxiety!"
InfertilityBabies,3d2al2,honmamichin,2,Mon Jul 13 01:09:31 2015 UTC,I completely understand. Of course you want to hang on as long as you can! I'll have my fingers crossed for you!

One thing it might also help to keep in mind is that until recently 37 weeks was considered full term."

We're not watching tennis, but our 18 year old neighbour is volunteering for the PanAm games at the moment, and we did see her on TV last night (she was very officially guarding a door to make sure the divers didn't go through, and the cameras would pan by her when the followed the divers when they were leaving the deck. it was neat.)  Baby slept through the night last night! Of course, he didn't go to sleep until 10 o'clock... but still! Just after 10 until almost 6, and then back down until almost 7! Amazing!   Also, we tried oatmeal this morning, and he is NOT a fan. I had suggested giving him something to chew on (a la baby led weaning) but husband wanted try oatmeal...

It's kinda been my thing, to find the perfect bears.  Because when my dad turned 7, he got a big teddy bear.  I still have it.  Then, when I was born, my dad bought me a bear and it was in the crib waiting for me.  Still have it! So, it just feels right to pass that on.  I put the bows on, just for fun...they're not permanent.  Now they're in the crib for homecoming (to be removed when babies are also in crib).  No sports today...don't care for tennis.  But it is crock pot/freezer meal day, and given how much I hate shopping AND cooking, it's kinda like a sport for me.  Needs focus, perseverance, and probably some swearing."

Or wanted him to just choose the one he likes from the ones he randomly gets. Or something. I don't know. I feel like she should have talked to me about it.

InfertilityBabies,3d0erb,TigFan15,2,Mon Jul 13 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"No problem! A couple of tips:   Cut some cardboard to fit inside the onsies so they don't bleed on the back Put up a little placard or something asking people to sign them. For some reason, although we were verbally asking them to sign, they all initialed them?  Buy some stencils. Even though most people didn't use them, a LOT of people really appreciated having the option   Once I get some good pictures, I'll have to post them. Our friends rocked this, way more than I anticipated.   When is your shower? :D"

InfertilityBabies,3cze30,Got_the_giggles,6,Sun Jul 12 04:31:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. :( For some reason people don't think it's inappropriate to ask others about their reproductive situation/choices/whatever even though it totally is.  If it helps, I understand where you are coming from. My pregnancy also ended up being complicated; I went into preterm labor, was on hospital bed rest for 7 weeks, had my baby in the NICU for a couple weeks because she was 6 weeks early, and then the newborn stage was just a complete nightmare (low supply, lots of guilt, very probable ppd). I just don't know if I'll ever feel up to going through all that again on top of the anxiety of dealing with infertility.  But people don't want to hear that stuff, and they just keep asking."
InfertilityBabies,3cze30,sleepingrozy,7,Sun Jul 12 04:32:22 2015 UTC,This makes me feel less guilty about realizing I just don't want to try for another kid with our remaining embryos. The stress of trying and hoping and then my struggle with PPD and sleep deprivation is just too much to make me want to go through any of it again. I feel sad because we always wanted more than one child if possible but because it took me until my late 30s to conceive I feel like I don't have the energy to do it all again.   I'm so sorry you had to endure that. What is it with people thinking you automatically want another kid anyway? Like it's a sin to be happy with one perfect angel?
InfertilityBabies,3cze30,lancealittle,5,Sun Jul 12 06:29:05 2015 UTC,"My family thinks that since I had my son I'm someone fucking cured, nope still broken. I have to remind them all the fucking time it's not that easy. Oh and my MIL cornered me last time they were over and flat out asked me if I was pregnant. It's the third time in a fucking year she's done this.   She asked because she though she had seen ""baby stuff"" in the kitchen. I keep my prenatal vitamins in a basket on my counter with my IVF drugs from the last round that I recently did (I had found out it failed about 2 weeks before). They were not in plain sight and you would have to have been snooping to see them.   I specifically didn't tell her we were going through the last round partially for the same damn reason. Stop asking even if I was, I would lie and not tell you until I was damn ready to."
InfertilityBabies,3cze30,larabair,4,Mon Jul 13 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"It took us until my daughter was almost 4 to conceive our second child. Most of our friends and family were pretty sensitive, but from my coworkers is was almost a daily question from the time she was a year old. At first, when we weren't trying, I didn't mind as much. Eventually I would answer ""right now, if you want to pay for it!"" As we're a queer family, most people have at least some sense that it's not that simple for us."

InfertilityBabies,3cze30,RositaYouBitch,3,Sun Jul 12 20:47:39 2015 UTC,I am forever explaining the reasons we won't be trying for another baby. I have a 2 year old and I don't mind the asking so much but then people want to debate your answer and even the reasons. Of folks would just take a hint and accept my decision and leave it at that it would be great.
InfertilityBabies,3cx9t6,DoopleSmog,6,Sat Jul 11 16:22:35 2015 UTC,"I think this is a fear in everyone who needs a donor. I needed donor eggs. Let me tell you, I have a 6 week old (on Monday) sitting on her daddy's lap making silly noises while dad talks to her in a baby voice. She is 100% mine. I love her with all of my heart. Do you want a baby? (yes) Will you do anything to have one? (yes) Then you won't care how s/he came to be. Trust me it will go out the window!"
InfertilityBabies,3cx9t6,talula79,6,Sat Jul 11 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"For another perspective, I am the product of donor sperm conception. My dad is completely infertile, so they didn't really have another option. My parents didn't tell me until I was a pre-teen, by which time I had three internationally adopted younger siblings. For me, it has never been a huge issue. My father is the man who raised me and loves me and shows up to play with my kid and helps me out with random household projects and tells me more than I ever wanted to know about beekeeping. I am of course somewhat curious about my biological father and if anyone from that side showed up and wanted to meet me, I would at least have coffee, but I'm not looking for a replacement.  I think that before going the donor route, you need to do some of the same processing and mourning that needs to happen before you adopt. It is ok to grieve for not having your husband's biological child. It is ok for your husband to grieve. You can still love a child who isn't biologically related to both of you.  Also, if you haven't had all of the tests done, don't borrow trouble. The issue might not be with him."

InfertilityBabies,3cx9t6,run_jenny_run,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:48:26 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for sharing this perspective. It's always comforting to hear positive stories about donor conception. May I ask you a question? What would be the ideal age you would have wanted to know about your conception? How did your parents bring it up to you? Thank you!
InfertilityBabies,3cx9t6,run_jenny_run,3,Sun Jul 12 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"We have a beautiful baby girl thanks to the help of donor sperm. My best advice to you is to be very careful of your language when you are considering using a donor. Using terms like ""my husband's baby"" or ""child of my own"" won't help anyone come to accept using a donor. Our donor baby is just as much my husband's child as she is mine even though they don't have a biological connection. We learned this when we adopted our first baby. They are both my children regardless of whose is whose biologically. I'm only telling you this because you mentioned you are still coming to terms with using a donor. Hopefully it helps! As far as telling her she is a donor baby, we plan on telling her as soon as she is old enough to understand. We chose a donor who is open to the idea of communication. You can chose when you buy donor sperm if you want an open or closed relationship. We picked open because we want her to be able to know where she came from. If she has questions, they can be answered. We have a very open relationship with our adopted son's birth parents and the research we have done suggests children adjust better, are more self confident, and have better relationships with their parents when they have access to information about their history. Knowing your donor doesn't make you any less of a parent. That being said, if it's something you are not comfortable with, that is just fine and you can choose an anonymous donor.  Lastly, I wouldn't even worry about your husband being detached. When I gave birth to our daughter, my husband cried. We've been married six years and it's the second time I've ever seen him cry. He loves his little girl more than life and she has him wrapped around her little finger. It's easier on him because of our adoption and we already understand that family is much more than a biological connection. Our daughter is just as much my baby as our son is. I don't love her more because she is biologically mine.  Anyways, I hope I was able to provide a little insight. If there is any other questions you have please feel free to ask! I'm an open book and I love talking about my babies so I would be more than happy to keep going :-)  Whatever you decide, I wish you the best of luck on your journey!"
InfertilityBabies,3cx9t6,jaina_jade,4,Sat Jul 11 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"I'm currently expecting thanks to a donor egg and it took me a bit of time to come around to the idea - mostly a donor vs adopt thing. I knew that regardless of the end method it would be my child but it was hard to know which was the ""right"" path.  In the end being turned down by multiple agencies sealed that for us (feel free to read my post history for more on that) and now I couldn't be happier.  While biologically this little one doesn't ""match"" me, it does belong to me and is OUR baby.    We plan to tell them when they are old enough to understand, and found some fantastic (books)[http://www.amazon.com/One-More-Giraffe-Kim-Noble/dp/0692005781]  to help us in telling the story.  We're also registered on the sibling/donor registry but our donor isn't on their and (so far) neither are any of the half siblings - of which we know there is at least one.  Our clinic doesn't really encourage relationships with the donor, seeing it more related to a tissue donation than adoption but they also required us to talk to a therapist about all of those things before we qualified for the program.      Feel free to PM me if you want more information."

Once the bleeding stopped and I went back to bed, I could not stop my right ribs from having the weird pregnancy parasthesia I get and I couldn't breathe on my back, but I wasn't falling asleep on my left quickly enough. Finally some benadryl kicked in (for sleeping and my constant sneezing) and I fell asleep, prolly after midnight. But my 4-year-old woke up with a bad dream at, like, 3. She only needed a firm ""there, there"" and it wasn't a big deal, but guess whose toe was throbbing and whose entire trunk was one big mass of uncomfortable? This guy! Once the earliest birds started singing I just burst into tears because I knew I was fucked. I did eventually make it back to sleep, but it was almost light out and then the kid came and woke me up a little after 7, like usual.  And I'm on parent duty all day so my partner can get some academic writing done. I'm guessing we have a trip to the SPCA to visit kittens in our future, because I don't think I'm up for much else."

But my doctor keeps blowing it off, chalking it up to ""pregnancy issues.""  But, the wikipedia definition sounds familiar...."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,becabecaful,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"It's not a formal diagnosis, it's just how I know how to describe it (I work in medicine so I know a fancy word here and there). It is certainly nerve in origin because it feels like someone hooked up my rib cage to a car battery, and it is positional (mostly happens when I'm slouching or when I'm lying on the affected side). It started earlier in my first go-round, like 5.5 months, but resolved with delivery. I know it's not a spinal nerve compression (radiculopathy or disc problem) because I have NO neck/upper back pain and it only happens when I have a big uterus. Just some cutaneous nerve getting pissed off by the spreading ribs and whatnot :( I'm sorry you've had such a hard time with the discomfort, but it's really not long for you now! I had good luck with an ice pack last night, but I've got a couple moths left . . ."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,lancealittle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"This sounds so familiar, but I guess if it's normal, and will go away after delivery, I can wait it out.  At first I thought it was my bone dislocating or something, but it's changed now.  It's a horrible burning/almost tearing pain on some body part (rib muscle, maybe?).  Sometimes it itches, and the outside is getting numb to the touch.  Sitting, in any position is painful, and I'm usually up a couple times a night needing to roll over to a different side.  Sometimes my back-ribs hurt too, but that could also just be baby kicking me (she's still sitting SO high).  Ice packs have been my life heh.  Sorry you have so long to go :(  While I'm super thankful I'm not having any hip/lower pack pain, I wouldn't wish this on anyone either."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,becabecaful,2,Sun Jul 12 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"I'm 39 weeks today and will hopefully be having a sexy Saturday.  It's time for my husband and I to begin the joint-effort labor inducing activities.  We've been very paranoid so it's been a long time.    This may sound strange, but I'm feeling really sad about even naturally trying to induce labor. While I'm excited to meet our baby, I just don't feel that my daughter is ready to come out yet.  Ideally, I'd like to just let labor begin when it begins, but I have an OB appointment this Wednesday and I'm worried that the doctor will insist on scheduling an induction at 40 weeks since I have GD.  The GD has been very well controlled by diet and exercise and the baby is growing well (49% and very proportionate) and really active.  I haven't seen the doctor for a few weeks now, so I haven't been able to ask her where she stands on it.  I also asked for a prescription for Metformin a few weeks ago for after I deliver, since I read that it's supposed to help with breastfeeding in women with PCOS.  I'm worried the doctor will review my chart and think that I'm currently using the medication for GD.  I'd like to avoid being induced if possible since the increased risk of some complications associated with it make me nervous, esp. the increased risk of shoulder dystocia."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,RositaYouBitch,5,Sat Jul 11 14:35:43 2015 UTC,"While you should listen to doctors because they're medical professionals, it is your body and you can always say no. It's not like they can forcefully induce you. My midwife tried to recommend induction at 40 weeks because my baby was measuring big, I definitely told her no. I ended up going into labor at 39+3, and naturally birthed my 10 pound 9 ounce baby.   I hope you get what you're looking for!"
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,pamplemousse2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:55:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Your story is really inspirational and your not-so-little guy is so cute in your pictures.  I think for me one of the difficulties about this issue is that opinions really seem to vary across the medical community, at least in the US."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,Zoraptera,2,Sat Jul 11 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"I did my research. For me the potential risks of inducing were higher than the potential risks of attempting natural birth. It's hard sometimes, we all want what's best for our babies, but that isn't always black and white. Know your facts and trust your gut. You're having your baby soon either way!"
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,pamplemousse2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right - it isn't black and white.  There isn't really that much research on what's best for diet-controlled GD out there - most of the research is for mothers with Type I diabetes or much more severe GD with very high blood sugar.  We are all set for the baby to come home though.  I just finished sterilizing the bottles, which was the last thing on my to-do list.  Hopefully I'll go into labor by 39w3d too and won't even make it to my appointment!"
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,Zoraptera,2,Sat Jul 11 16:45:16 2015 UTC,You finished your pre baby to do list?! You're my hero.   I'm sure things will be just fine either way :) new babies make me so excited!
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,larabair,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:31:11 2015 UTC,"I hope you can bring it on early. My understanding is that here GD is usually induced by 40 weeks regardless. I could be wrong, but my experience with friends has been induction at 38/39 weeks. There are also increased risks with GD on labour/baby if gestation goes too long iirc. All the best! They do say what gets them in there, gets them out ;)"
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,Zoraptera,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"I like that line, what gets them in gets them out!    There are so many variables and factors at play and it's hard to know what's best.  Here, some doctors and midwives are fine with going to 41 weeks for diet controlled GD, and I had a consultation with a midwife a couple of weeks ago who thought it would be fine to wait as long as it remained diet-controlled.  At any rate, hopefully I'll going into labor on my own.  At the end of the day what's important is a healthy baby!"
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,larabair,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's definitely hard to know what's best, and we put a lot of faith in our Healthcare professionals to hopefully do what's right. If you're diet controlled that's an accomplishment in itself sometimes!   A little tip my SIL and her friends shared was apparently using evening primrose oil capsules as a pessary for 5 nights in a row can help bring on labour. 3 of them did it and didn't need the full 5 days. My SIL was terrified of being induced again and it did the trick. Try all the wives tales!"
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,Zoraptera,2,Sat Jul 11 15:13:03 2015 UTC,I'll give the primrose oil capsules a try!  So far I've been drinking red raspberry leaf tea and walking lots.  We're also going to blow up an old yoga ball of my husband's so I can bounce on it.
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,MrsDragon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"Total anecdote, but I was using EPO vaginally around 40 weeks with my last pregnancy, and my water broke but labor wasn't starting so I wound up with an induction that led to fetal distress that led to an emergency c/s. While there are (and were) many factors at play, I do think the EPO played a significant role."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,pamplemousse2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for the warning.  In that case I'll skip them."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,MrsDragon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"I will remember this, thanks for sharing."
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,pamplemousse2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:59:23 2015 UTC,My bff sent me her leftover EPO pills but I asked my OB before taking them. She said there's no evidence that they really help but they can cause a rash on the babies when they're born. I decided against using them and my water broke on its own at 39 weeks on the dot. The only thing I did that day was a lot of activity (groceries and cleaning the house) and I had a sip of beer.
InfertilityBabies,3cwupt,MrsDragon,2,Sat Jul 11 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I've decided not to use them."

We named her after hurricane Fay because she was found as a kitten scared, dirty and alone right after it by some students where I taught. She's a fighter! I hope your Fay is doing well!"
InfertilityBabies,3ctde8,becabecaful,2,Sat Jul 11 01:04:37 2015 UTC,"Aww that's great! I love a good kitten rescue story :) Our Fay is doing quite well, if not a bit weird... she's a polydactyl, which is a sign of inbreeding, and I'm convinced she's a savant. She does things I've never seen other cats do (like use a mirror) but she also has no idea what the ""rules"" of being a cat are and that drives our other cats crazy."
InfertilityBabies,3ctde8,TigFan15,2,Sat Jul 11 02:50:27 2015 UTC,Cute bump!
InfertilityBabies,3ctde8,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jul 10 22:06:16 2015 UTC,Thank you :)

InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,Notaprettylush,3,Fri Jul 10 18:48:12 2015 UTC,I'm 29 with stage 2 endo and pcos and we were also dealing with severe MFI. 4 years of ttc before we had success with IVF#1 (our success is currently 4.5 weeks old). I had surgery for my endo 9 months before we started our IVF protocol (short one with less than usual dose due to my AMH being insanely high). We collected 19 eggs and implanted one AA grade and froze four. I was 100% convinced it wouldn't work. I had heaps of cramping the last week before our beta at 9dp5dt and none of these 'early pregnancy symptoms' that I thought I would have. Just about fell out of my chair when I got our first beta of 255. In four years I'd never once ever had a positive pregnancy test so went and peed on a stick the next day haha. Thankfully I had an uneventful pregnancy for the most part but I never thought I'd get there. All the best for your IVF journey :-)
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,Indirya,2,Sat Jul 11 03:09:31 2015 UTC,"I had a lap for my endo prior to my fertility treatment, including IVF.  Although we had to use donor eggs because I also have DOR, our first fresh IVF with one embryo worked and resulted in my 2+year old son!"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,cakegroove,2,Fri Jul 10 18:54:44 2015 UTC,"We had combined male and female factors and had success on our first round.  Even with my DOR (Low response, I'm 37) and relatively few eggs and embryos.  I just posted my twins' pictures to another thread.  They were my only two embryos and both successful!"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,yearofthecat,2,Fri Jul 10 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"Both my husband and I were 32 at the time of our IVF cycle. Unexplained infertility. On our first round of IVF we only got 2 viable blastocysts. We chose to transfer both and I'm currently 25+ weeks with twins. : )  Does your clinic offer any shared risk programs? We opted for a program which included up to 2 IVF cycles and as many FETs as you had embryos for for a fixed cost. They also offered some money back if none of those worked. Since we got lucky the first time, we ended up paying more than if we had only paid for the single IVF cycle but it was incredibly reassuring to know that if it didn't work at first, there wasn't a price tag attached. We were okay with the idea that we might pay more, because we figured if we got lucky the first time it was (a) worth it and (b) the ""extra"" money would be covering other couples who hadn't been so lucky. I don't regret it at all."
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,MrsDragon,2,Fri Jul 10 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"We had success our first round.  We had (have?) pretty severe MFI and I had had 2 rounds of lap to clear out cysts and polyps.  We had only two make it to transfer and only one was given the okay from a genetic POV.  (We were told the second might be okay, but that they wouldn't feel comfortable transferring it without a lot of testing first.)  We did a day 5 fresh transfer.  Luckily, he stuck around and baby boy will be 6 months at the end of July.  :)"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,sonirose,2,Fri Jul 10 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"I have bad Fallopian tubes and PCOS, but I'm 24w3d with IVF#1.  Also, one of my IRL friends is about 12 weeks along with her IVF#1 after multiple failed IUIs and a surgery to remove uterine polyps.  Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,ghoastie,2,Fri Jul 10 20:21:00 2015 UTC,"I had a lap about a year before our first IVF for my endo (also have PCOS), we saw success from our first round of IVF. Thank goodness, because we would be able to do FET from any leftover embryos but we couldn't (probably still wouldn't) possibly afford to do another full IVF cycle. I was 29 with AMH that would indicate about ~33 years old at the time as far as reserve."
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,apanda1084,2,Fri Jul 10 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you all SO much. The time you spent reassuring me just makes me feel so good. And the success stories boosted my confidence more than I anticipated. I know everyone is different, but it sure helps.    Also, my AMH is 3.4 so I'm hoping that is a huge help too _^"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,handywife6,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:49:59 2015 UTC,My amh is down to .25 with one ovary and I ended up with 4 viable embryos from my 8 eggs retrieved. So if I can have success so can you
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,NBPTS,2,Sat Jul 11 13:01:43 2015 UTC,"Endo here! SA also excellent here. My endo is technically unconfirmed since we didn't do the surgery but I have every single marker including a diagnosed primary relative. I also have cervical stenosis.   We did 5 rounds of clomid, 2 rounds of letrizole, IUIs, estrogen, progesterone, ovidrel, an HSG, you name it. All failed. We were given the option to do the laparoscopic surgery followed by more IUIs or go to IVF. I was ready to try something different.    First IVF was a success!  My twins were born March 2014 and we have four frozen embryos. We plan to do a FET when the babies turn two for a sibling.  Good luck!  p.s. I was also 31 when we did IVF."
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,NBPTS,3,Sat Jul 11 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"This makes me smile :)   EDIT: your struggles are nothing to smile about, of course. But our similarities and your success gives me hope. I'm sure you knew what I meant, but I had to edit because it looked so wrong."
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,mrswhiskerson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:40:34 2015 UTC,I knew just what you meant! I can't wait to hear how it goes!  Ooh! One more similarity! We got our positive beta in August 2013! August is a great month for IVF!
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,effingeffstick,2,Sun Jul 12 04:45:16 2015 UTC,"Currently 25+ w with the one blast we had left at day 5 from our first IVF. I'm 30, he's 32, MFI was the only diagnosed thing (I didn't ovulate regularly though) but my egg quality wasn't as good as anticipated, our attrition was terrible, but we're still in it! Good luck to you!! Hope you get your one hit wonder!"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,a_b_dubbs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:35:16 2015 UTC,Severe MFI and DOR here and it took us a bit to get here but we finally found success. I hope this won't be an issue for you but if you find yourself having to do another full cycle there are some places(including mine) who can break out the payments over a 12 month period.  That made things easier for us.
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,handywife6,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:21:07 2015 UTC,IVF #1 worked for me! My b/g twins are now 5 months. I was 32 when I got pregnant.  Wishing you all the best!! :)
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,reidiate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"I have 5 weeks 2 days with our first ivf / fet. We did genetic testing on our embryos. I posted last week an intro that has all my story - I have one ovary, low amh - hubs had low motility, we did ICSI and PGS - we did higher dose of cetrotide protocol and we ended up with amazing results of 4 viable embryos - we transferred just one and so far so good - have my first ultrasound next Monday.   I recommend the genetic testing and doing ICSI as well if you might end up with fewer eggs retrieved. It was worth the extra money so we wouldn't worry about having multiple failed transfers due to abnormal embryos. I feel less worried we will miscarry"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,pamplemousse2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the next step in your journey.  I really really hope that the surgery and the IVF work for you. I think one of the hardest things is the anticipation you feel before each new attempt.  It can drive you nuts thinking about it. I found it useful to think of each time as a step forward. With every try we learned more and could disgard an element that wasn't working. Just focus on the fact you're getting closer to the goal.   I have heard a lot of first attempt success stories but don't become disheartened if it doesn't happen first go. A large part of the process is ""hormone tinkering"" as my RE says. It can take a few times to see how you respond etc."

InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,tina3times,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:38:58 2015 UTC,We are in our early thirties with unexplained fertility. We had our first ivf transfer with an elective fresh single embryo transfer (also my insurance which is Aetna) covered an extra fresh cycle because there is such a success rate - you might want to ask about that. But as I was saying- we are will be 6 weeks pregnant on Wednesday. We have had low HCG the entire time but it keeps on doubling! Fingers crossed for you and I.
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,robyn_sparkles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm 31, hubby is 32. We haven't been actively trying because I have not gotten my period since Oct 2013 (so we knew it was pointless to ""try"".) We started going to a fertility clinic in March after my last endocrinologist said there was no answer to my amenorrhea, and if I wanted to get pregnant I should go to a fertility clinic.  According to clinic I have hypothalamic amenorrhea and my husband also has low morphology. I responded ""too well"" to my meds, so fearing OHSS my doc decided we'd do a retrieval then wait to do a FET when my body calmed down. Retrieve 34 eggs, 22 fertilized, 5 made it to blast and 3 graded super well (chromosome-wise).  We transferred one healthy embryo June 5th and now I am 8 weeks pregnant :)! We hope to ""graduate"" from our clinic on Friday and begin seeing a regular OB.  The first time can stick :) Keep faith, but also keep rational. A nice healthy balance is key :)"
InfertilityBabies,3cttgq,razzertto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"IVF #1 worked for my husband and I (both 32), we had previously done IUI's and clomid etc with no success whatsoever.  We are unexplained IF I was terrified that IVF wouldn't work.  I had to manage my expectations- my mindset that success for the first round of IVF would be that we had something to transfer or more information about what is ""wrong"" with our fertility.  So one successful fresh transfer (Due Dec 17) and 4 frozen blasts put me over the moon.  Best of luck with your IVF- I hope it goes perfectly for you"

Going to talk to RE /nurse next week at ultrasound appoint and get recommendation - there are a couple other OB's at that office but I don't like them at past appointments I had there before we moved to RE. Why did she have to move???!!! We will be at RE for a few more weeks so I have a little time at least.   Do you typically just go to a regular OB after IVF or do they consider IVF babies high risk? We transferred a single embryo and very low chance of splitting to twins so it seems like it would be treated as normal pregnancy right? (Except for the PIO shots I have to take)
InfertilityBabies,3ct1de,Iamagnu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"I stopped seeing my RE at week 10, and saw my new MFM the same week.

So I will be seeing my MFM every month, which will also include an ultrasound every month and my OB every month as well.  I only saw my OB with my son, who was also an IVF baby.

InfertilityBabies,3ct1de,honmamichin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Right! There is nothing inherently high-risk about an IVF pregnancy, though I suppose it's possible that there could be something about why you had to do IVF that might make it high-risk."

I've made it through having a filter installed in my vena cava to catch any other clots headed to my lungs, and today they removed 78% of the leg clot, which my Dr was very impressed with. They also found more old clot in my hip, which explains my excruciating pain when walking. I seem to be out of the woods, but I will likely be on blood thinners for the rest of my life.

InfertilityBabies,3ct1de,Zoraptera,4,Fri Jul 10 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"Mom just got out of OR from an appendectomy. Almost my entire family is coming over tomorrow for family reunion and staying at my parents place so we're going over tonight to clean.  I also came out on facebook as being pregnant. It went fairly well (wrote up a novel) until both my mom, my MIL, and my SIL decided to do their ""I am so happy to announce I'm going to be a Grandma/Aunt in November!!"" announcement. O_o  My mom said she's happy to announce she'll be choosing a grandma nickname and she's DUE in 20 weeks to choose. She also keeps commenting on EVERYTHING saying she's excited for her new chapter. My MIL and SIL are even worse. I get that they're excited, but the whole message of my post was ""this is just another type of journey and not worth announcing like I'm now someone special"" sort of thing. Mainly because we became SO close to not being parents/looking into adoption. I had already came pretty close to accepting that fate that I really just can't say something like ""I'm going to be a mommy!!"". Oh well. It's done. People can stop bugging me about it.  Next obstacle, explaining to the family that I am not allowing photos of my son plastered all over instagram, twitter, or facebook. I never had that mentality until at work someone sent out a birth announcement with a photo, I saw one of my bitchy co-workers save the photo to their personal file (she didn't ever even talk to the mom). At that moment I realized how easily someone can take these personal photos. Just made me really uneasy personally."
InfertilityBabies,3ct1de,kat_loves_tea,2,Fri Jul 10 22:23:05 2015 UTC,Re photos: we have a shared iPhoto album that is family only so we can all add to it. We have a very small limited other one which we have given links to friends. I know some android families doing the same with g+. So that's an option. But if your family is as crazy-selfish as they sound something tells me the fuckers won't listen when you say no.
InfertilityBabies,3ct1de,gizmo_love,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:13:18 2015 UTC,That's kind of creepy.

InfertilityBabies,3ct1de,AwkwardOrangeHippo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"My mother was the same way. In fact, she announced as a grandma before I had gone public with my pregnancy and I was furious. Then she blew up the internet with pictures of my child. Texting them to people in other countries whom I've never met and all. I had to have it all out with her about taking it all down and for a few months now, she's not allowed any pictures of my child. She tries to sneak her phone out and take pictures but I watch her like a hawk and don't let her.    What really set me off was that a stranger came up to me in a parking lot because she recognized me from the pictures my mom showed EVERYONE SHE MEETS. Then she asked if my daughter was in the back seat, I awkwardly said yes she was with me and this lady reached over and opened the car door. I about lost it and hightailed it out of there. So now I'm VERY selective of who gets to see any pictures."

My husband asked me the other day (after our second anatomy scan) if I really feel ""pregnant"".  I replied that I mostly feel gross, and my pants don't fit.  I think that's about 90% of pregnancy...  I am trying really hard not to freak out about buying furniture.  I found a good deal on a vintage dresser via Etsy (being sold locally so we can pick it up) and managed to get the toddler conversion rail for the crib I want (which is only available direct from the manufacturer at this time).  I guess in the next few weeks I will order an actual crib?  Eek.  My ankle is still decidedly sprained.  I got a different ankle brace and am using a cane today to help take some of the stress off of the joint.  Happier news: my cabinets are here!  I assembled my special little cabinet for trays, since it's smaller and I wanted to practice assembling one of the base cabinets.  My rolling pin fits perfectly in the little drawer, just like I had planned!  My husband was excited too, he has hated having to sift through my baking supplies when getting out other things from our ""miscellaneous"" drawer.  Tonight I'm going to assemble the two upper cabinets I need to put veneer on (the sides will be on either side of our range hood, so they'll be exposed but I didn't want to lose storage space by using the premade end panels) so I can get paint and paint them tomorrow.

One one hand, free live in baby sitter. On the other, there's no room here so she's living in the living room, there's literally nothing to do here, and I enjoy being by myself during the day. And since she will be staying in the living room my husband will be keeping to himself in the bedroom. I just don't forsee it being a fun time."

I'm pretty sure I'm also starting to dilate, which means absolutely nothing, but I'm just glad something (anything) is happening.  I scheduled another NST for Tuesday, but honestly, I don't really want to make it that far.  I want to breathe again.    Packing still...always packing.  I need to get as much done between now and next week as possible.  Hubs and I have a busy day tomorrow running around the state (its a tiny state) doing some errands and getting last minute prep stuff.  I can't believe I've been off work for 3 weeks!!! I feel guilty about it, because I've been feeling so good (physically), nothing is happening, and I miss my kids!  But, with all the packing, now it makes sense."

He's also spitting up an hour after a feeding.  I'm concerned that he might have reflux.  But on the good side, he's starting to coo and really look at us which is really fun.  I can't wait to see a real smile from him.  Anyone have experience with reflux babies?  I'm starting to feel semi normal again.  I'm slowly losing weight.  I've stopped wearing my belly binder to retrain my back muscles and abs.  My hemorrhoid is shrinking down - whew.    I do have diastasis recti where my ab muscles separated around my belly button giving me the mommy pooch.    Anyone gone through PT to resolve this issue?  I only have 6 weeks left of maternity leave.  Going to try to make the best of the time that I have.  I'm planning on doing lots of small projects around the house before I head back to work.

InfertilityBabies,3crb94,socphd,10,Fri Jul 10 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"Knitting. Planning home improvement projects. Pies.  I'm especially proud of my pies. I have read far more about the science of baking than I probably should, but suffice it to say my secrets to good pie crust are: using frozen vegetable shortening in lieu of lard or butter (measure by weight), letting the dough rest for 2+ hours prior to rolling out, using a silicone pastry mat for rolling (needs less flour not to stick), and baking in stoneware pie plates. I find it's less mess just to use a pastry blender to cut in the shortening by hand - it may be faster to use a food processor, but it is a lot more cleanup and not that much faster.   For fruit pies, I put together the filling and let it sit for 4+ hours (preferably overnight) before assembling the pie. This helps give a better syrup - I use a slotted spoon to transfer the filling into the pie crust so I can control how much liquid goes in. For custard type pies (pecan, pumpkin, etc.) I make the pie crust the night before but make the filling immediately before baking.  ... I go a little crazy when it comes to pie. But they always turn out beautifully! So I feel like the effort is worth it."

InfertilityBabies,3crb94,kat_loves_tea,2,Sat Jul 11 20:15:09 2015 UTC,"IMO yes.  I make all butter crusts so the rubbing in trick melts the butter too much for my liking.  The cutter is really fast, a few flicks of the wrist and I'm done."

InfertilityBabies,3crb94,RositaYouBitch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:32:38 2015 UTC,The patient communication is such a great skill.

InfertilityBabies,3crb94,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:36:41 2015 UTC,"On the baking front, I felt the same way. All the measuring utensils were tiresome to me and the excess cleanup was a deal breaker. Then I discovered the bowl on a scale method. Just add things by weight in grams, zero out, add next item. Works out so much better and as it turns out, is the preferred method by pastry chefs because it's much more precise (I learned this in a class.)    And the patient communication is an excellent asset to bring to the table. Things like health and finances (my field) can be very emotional, complex, and overwhelming. It provides a perfect storm for hostility, ill feelings, and challenges in processing the next steps of your action plan. Communication in a clear but genuine (and calming) fashion can achieve so much more."

Plus, at work, I've been presenting to senior management for a long time (for my age). In my current organization, I presented to the President a LOT before I went on mat leave, and never once got raked over to coals - which is saying something. He can really give it to you if you're not telling him good news - he's got VERY high standards.  I'm super proud of that. I guess I'm also good at taking responsibility for things - which is how I was an exec before I turned 30 (two days before my birthday... I definitely chose to start on a Thursday rather than a Monday for that specific reason, hahaha. But still!). It's a huge accomplishment in my field, and I'm really proud of hitting that milestone before most of my peers.

I am really good at taking a messy pile of data and feelings and experience and intuition and everything else people will throw in and logically sorting and classifying it. Identifying the common threads, defining the underlying problems, unearthing root causes. This also means I'm great at organizing papers, proposals, etc in a way that clearly and concisely addresses the goals and reads well for a variety of audiences."

All done by hard work, never got anything from anybody.  But what I'm good at is planning awesome vacations with hiking, good food, awesome places to stay at, adventures!

My mom was a nurse, and I grew up reading her textbooks in the bathroom.  Now I'm in nursing school and work as a nurse's aide with really medically complex patients.  I love figuring out medical puzzles and telling my husband all about the crazy illnesses people have at work.  I spend hours on Wikipedia and WebMD, learning everything I can about a given disease.  In other words, someday you'll want me as your nurse.  I know too much for my own good."

InfertilityBabies,3cr910,thrillhouse13,3,Fri Jul 10 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"I went to Dr. Hinckley at Reproductive Science Center and I loved her! What's nice is that although she was my doctor, all the doctors in the practice discuss results and plan your care together each day ... so lots of great minds looking at things! I was assigned a financial planner and a case manager who were both very responsive to any emails or calls or questions I had. I was given all costs in writing prior to each cycle and everything was very clear.  They order your meds for you in the way thats cheapest for you and do all your labs and ultrasound on site.  Their office is also very specific about when they will call and everyone always called when they said they would. (Even to say they didn't have results yet but would soon). I would by far recommend their practice! I did try Alta Fertility for a brief time. While I did like the doctor and one of the nurses, their billing process was a nightmare.  I felt like I was just another patient there and was given to direction in how to order meds, where to go for lab draws, etc ... and they don't use computers ... Good luck!!"

InfertilityBabies,3cr910,RositaYouBitch,2,Fri Jul 10 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"I worked with Dr. Ratcliffe at Advanced Fertility in Santa Rosa. I cannot say enough good things about her and her staff. Dr. Ratcliffe herself is a no bullshit kind of lady. She doesn't sugar coat and she doesn't do procedures that are going to waste your time. Bonnie is the coordinator and she is an absolute star. I wouldn't have survived my cycles without her and all of her detailed calendars. Each new med came with a very detailed sheet with injection instructions and they waited to discuss each new medication until it was actually needed in the cycle. This was so helpful because that big box of meds was overwhelming. Whenever I would call into the office the person I spoke with either knew exactly who I was or had my chart and it was detailed enough for them to help right away. We did one round of IVF with ICSI with assisted hatching. Bonnie helped us apply for and get financial assistance since we qualified as ""low income"" so that part was about $9K. Then each of our two FETs were about $2500 each. The cool thing about them is they run ""sales"" every once in a while. Actually, our last FET was $500 off for a summer special (pay before Aug 31 and you got a discount). I credit them with our success on our final FET. My son was born happy and healthy in May."

Our IVF there was successful (almost 3 years ago). We're actually looking at scheduling a FET with them sometime this fall.  Meet the office staff if you can; the nurses are also super important to your experience.

Heart palpitations all day, nauseous, exhausted beyond comprehensive. Thats today too (sans palpitations). Morning sickness is a complete tease.

InfertilityBabies,3crqrj,female_engineer_here,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"Symptoms come and go - it's something I've slowly had to accept throughout my pregnancy. And everyone truly is different.  There were weeks when I felt absolutely nothing and honestly at 18 weeks now, there are still a lot of days where I don't feel pregnant (unless I look down at my growing bump!).    My boobs went from being sooo sore to absolutely nothing for days at a time. I'm experiencing that now actually.  I'm sure you're completely fine - hormones fluctuate all the time and your body starts getting used to them. Feel lucky you feel good right now. I had the same thought ""where are the symptoms!"" and then around 8-9 weeks I felt like death. Your time will likely come :)"
InfertilityBabies,3cqqgi,dizzyvonblue,3,Fri Jul 10 00:39:26 2015 UTC,"I only know a small part of your story but, if I were you, I'd skip it. Normal fertile pregnant women don't even see any doctor until 8, sometimes 10, or even 12 weeks. If you're confident everything is looking good and you can mentally handle any anxiety that would come from delaying your appointment, I'd say skip it.  We saw our RE for ultrasounds at 4, 4.5, 6, 8, and 10 weeks before moving on to our OB. But I did IVF, had ohss, and was having twins. I needed lots of eyes watching me constantly. I dreaded going to the OB because I loved all the extra care. If you're not dealing with any of that, I'd say you're fine."
InfertilityBabies,3cqqgi,NBPTS,2,Fri Jul 10 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"Well the RE Appt is scheduled for 8 weeks, so that's why I was thinking of just seeing an OB.  Our doctor isn't personal. She had a good sense of urgency and an aggressive treatment plan, but no bedside manner."

She's about an hour away. While I LOVE her and the office, it's just not going to be practical for me as a teacher to drive there frequently, especially towards the end of my pregnancy. On top of that, I don't really want to spend an hour in labor driving across the world when it's time to deliver. I am going to her for my 6 week appointment then I'll be asking her if she has any references closer to my side of town. If not, I'll be looking for another doctor.

InfertilityBabies,3cpizq,kat_loves_tea,2,Fri Jul 10 05:57:22 2015 UTC,"Amelia is AWESOME.  I can't believe she's about to be a year old!  I'll update more in the daily thread today, promise!  I miss you wonderful ladies!"
InfertilityBabies,3cpizq,jmdtova,3,Fri Jul 10 14:14:54 2015 UTC,"It feels like we went through hell and back already with IF so I do feel like my husband and I are very strong and can handle this.    My heart goes out to you. It never seems fair when infertility wasn't enough payment to the universe and we still have to deal with other issues.   My only experience with club feet is anecdotal, friend of a friend type thing. For what it's worth, she had twins, preemies, one had a club foot, they are ~2 and the little girl is totally out of casts/braces with no lingering effects. Hopefully others in this sub can give you more first hand info. :)  Edit: Typo"
InfertilityBabies,3cpizq,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 9 21:08:05 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, I'm sorry that your little one will need to go through club foot correction and that you have other concerns. I'm not familiar with either issue but my heart goes out to you as none of us need the stress on top of having done through what we've all been through...  I hope you find support and courage for the coming experiences and that your son recovers quickly!"
InfertilityBabies,3cpizq,Hopecat,3,Thu Jul 9 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"Oh hi!  My daughter was born with a left clubfoot.  She's now 11 months old.  Her foot required 7 weekly casts, surgery with another cast for 3 weeks, and then one last surgery and 3 week casting.  She is now in boots and bar 18 hours a day, with a custom AFO while she's out of her boots.  If I were you, I'd research the Ponseti Method of clubfoot treatment and find a good doctor in your area!  Where are you located?"
InfertilityBabies,3cpizq,jmdtova,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:32:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I am in the Midwest. Does the method depend on the degree of club foot? (I don't even know if they distinguish degrees, this is all extremely new to me)   How did you handle the surgeries and castings emotionally? I'm a wreck just thinking about my poor baby going through all that. Dr Google says it's a painless process for babies but I hardly believe that. Did you have to make special considerations for clothing and gear like strollers, swings, bouncers, carseat at all due to the braces/casts/boots and bar?"
InfertilityBabies,3cpizq,jmdtova,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:51:10 2015 UTC,"The method is fairly universal, the number of casts and whether or not they need surgery is based on severity.  If you're in the Midwest (I'm in Cincinnati) you might want to consider either Dr. Morconde (not sure if the spelling is right) in Iowa City, or Dr. Dobbs in St. Louis.  They are, far and away, the best in the country.  We see Dr. Tamai at Cincinnati Children's and he is phenomenal.   My daughter took the castings really well.  It's not painful, though it is uncomfortable as most clubfoot kids don't like having their affected feet manipulated.  The surgeries, well, I was a mess.  Amelia came out just fine, though, and pain was well controlled with Tylenol.   Emotionally, it's rough.  You kinda have to mourn the baby you thought you were getting, and there is definitely a period of acceptance.  It's hard work.  Amelia is now 11 months old.  She never crawled, hates being on her belly, and scoots around on her butt.  Her gross motor skills are slightly delayed, so we just started physical therapy.  Despite the physical setbacks, she is the happiest baby I have ever come across.  She is a bright light in a dark world, and I love her more than I could ever express.  You'll understand soon!!!  This is the most important piece of advice I have for you--Babies are RESILIENT.  Your LO won't remember casting or surgery, and will thrive and figure out ways to do things when it seems their braces are holding them back.  Sometimes I have a bad day and think to myself that I'm simply not strong enough to be Amelia's mom.  Then I remember that her sun rises and sets on me, and I smile at her and carry on.  She doesn't know anything other than this life, and I am her guide through it.  Stay resilient, and so will your baby.    Please don't hesitate to ask more questions or PM me!"
InfertilityBabies,3cpizq,jmdtova,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:10:04 2015 UTC,"Oh and as far as clothing goes, we did a lot of onesies and baby leggings when she was being casted.  Footie pajamas are great, but once your LO is in braces they either won't be able to wear them or you'll have to cut them.  We've managed just fine with no footie PJs for about 8 months now."

InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,spankyjubblies,7,Thu Jul 9 21:41:06 2015 UTC,"I've taken my first two doses of reglan (last night before dinner and this morning). I didn't see a change at my 3am or 6am pump, but I got an ounce more at my 9am pump, and I'm currently in the middle of my 11am so we'll see how that goes (husband broke one of my pump parts and we're not home, so I'm stuck pumping one boob at a time and it's taking forever). No real side effects other than possible increased production. Haven't felt tired, sleepy, dizzy, or had any GI issues. About 30 minutes after I take it I feel a little agitated (like when I take adderall or migraine meds) but it only lasts for 15-20 minutes and then I'm fine. I'll count that as a win for now.  In baby news, Sebastian is back down to a high flow cannula from the c-pap and he's doing great. Also, I love my babies and they're adorable. Also also, Asher has been rocking his daily bottle feed. He's really got the suck-swallow-breathe thing down. Now he just has to stop falling asleep and finish a whole bottle instead of just half."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,robyn_sparkles,2,Thu Jul 9 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"If you're only agitated for 15-20 minutes then that's not bad. I'm agitated almost all evening when my husband gets home, and i'm not on any meds ;)  And I'm glad the babies are doing really well! D was a sleepy eater too."

InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"The thing about chimineas is that they are uber directional -- you need to be sitting RIGHT in front of it to enjoy the fire. Entirely cool for 1-2 person use, but not much fun if you want to have a bunch of people sitting around toasting marshmallows (BTW, I can totally be hired for home visits with my guitar to lead Woody Guthrie and John Prine and Joan Baez campfire singing).

All that's really left to unpack is our books, but there's still quite a bit of organization that needs done. All of our flannel sheets and winter coats are getting stashed in space bags in rubbermaid totes in the garage. They were necessary in Detroit...not so much in the Keys :) I'm also putting off finishing Pond's room until his crib mattress arrives. We did find a potential nanny though! One of the people from care.com finally responded so she's coming over tonight for a meet and greet. The background check from the site looks good and she works as an advocate for foster kids so that seems to be a good sign. I hope this is the solution I'm looking for."

InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:17 2015 UTC,Boy....I have a combo of few different brands/ideas.   For newborn I have 2 small thistied due wraps and 24 newborn/infant prefolds.  I also have 6 THX all in ones(liek Happy Flute china cheapies) and 2 Lil'Joeys.  Everything else is in OS:   4 Happy Flutte covers 3 Flips covers 6 Happy Flutte AIO 4 AI2 Little Helpers 2 Fuzzibuns 3 hemp fitteds for overnight - THX brand and 10-12 more of some Zuliliy nonsense that I didn't ask for and I don't know what to expect(MIL's doing) - mix of pockets and AIO's   I think that's all.  The concept was to try 2-3 brands for OS and see what works for us but it looks like I may have enough.  I helped take care of my younger brother when he was a baby(he is 13 years younger) and we did prefolds and literally had 3 covers for him.  Snappis didn't exist by then.  I am kinda excited about using modern fluff!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Iamagnu,3,Thu Jul 9 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"Mini had her 2-month appointment today. She cried during her shots, but that happens. The doctor said she looks like a very healthy baby, but he did say he is a little concerned with her weight. Today she measured in at the tenth percentile in height and the second in weight. He wants her back for a quick weigh-in in a month. I feel so crappy about this! Everyone on /r/breastfeeding posts pics of their chunky babies, but mine may be too skinny! (For the record, I'm thin and was definitely a little underweight for my whole childhood. I nurse her every 2 to 2-and-a-half hours during the day and on demand at night. We did a weighed feed after her appointment today and she took in around 2.5 oz, but at a weighed feed 2 weeks ago she took 4! She does spit up an awful lot after she eats.) Anyway, I'm going to order some fenugreek from Amazon now..."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,traveler5678,4,Thu Jul 9 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"I've been there. D isn't even on the chart still at 4 months. At a weighed feed he only took in 1.7 oz.  There was a long struggle between me and the nurses, but I just followed my gut. He went from 7lbs 8oz to just over 10lbs from 2.5 months to 4 months. And they're still not too happy with that since he's not on the charts.  You know your baby and your body. Trust yourself!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:50:32 2015 UTC,Thanks-this helps to hear.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Iamagnu,5,Thu Jul 9 17:54:05 2015 UTC,I haven't had my baby yet (and it's looking like she's going to be a chunky monkey from the get go) but both one of my sisters and I were really skinny as babies and children.  Neither of us had the typical baby fat as babies.  To try and fatten us up we used to get dessert after both lunch and dinner (which I wouldn't recommend - it was a hard habit to break as an adult).  I think some babies and children are just naturally skinnier than the norm.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,kat_loves_tea,4,Thu Jul 9 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"It will be okay.  Think about doing blessed thistle in combination with the fenugreek. Check out what Dr Jack Newman has to say about herbs for lactation.  My kiddo didn't start to plump up until his 6 week growth spurt, and then it was probably another month till he got some rolls. Like mess said, trust yourself.  We did some supplementing with bottles of breast milk for a little bit - supplementing is always an option if you want it. Hang in there."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the doc did suggest supplementing with bottles of pumped milk occasionally, so we'll try that. And I actually ordered product called mother love, which has fenugreek, blessed thistle, and some other stuff. Thanks for the encouragement!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,LowOnHope,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"I have the motherlove tincture! It totally helped even though I felt like it tasted like death.     S was so under weight that we had daily weigh in checks for two months after our NICU time. The bottom line is if mini keeps growing, eating, having dirty diapers, and meeting the developmental milestones then you are doing fine. Supplementing with pumped milk is definitely an option so you can see the intake.    Here's the thing, babies are all different and while it's great they're doing their due diligence to ensure you have a healthy child, you are the mama and it's up to you to know your child. If you feel something is wrong then speak up, research, get clarity, etc! But if you see continual growth and development (even if it's trending on the lower side of the chart) then your baby is growing. At 17.5 months, S is only 22lbs which is small, especially since she's almost 3ft tall (99th+ percentile). She's just a long and lean lady but she's smart as a whip and developmentally ahead, I make sure of it."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Iamagnu,2,Fri Jul 10 03:54:04 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for sharing your experience. This really helps to hear.

My baby B is around 14% but my Baby A bounces around between 2 and 6% He's perfectly healthy and growing well. Both are exclusively breastfed. I always thought babies needed to be little chuncksters but tall and slender is ok too."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,tina3times,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. :-) I was always the little guy as a child, both short and skinny, but skinner than I was short. Maybe mini-gnu is just going to take after her mom--and not after her 6'1"", 190-lb. dad."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jul 10 03:22:19 2015 UTC,"It took me a while to wrap my head around it, too. I was a little in the hefty side as a kid. Not sure why I was surprised as my husband is 6'3"" and all of 165 lbs. I feel certain that they are indeed his kids and there wasn't a mix up at the lab!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,healthylurker,3,Fri Jul 10 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"I just posted in CautiousBB but UGH. Yesterday I felt SO much better, no hunger every 1-2 hours, no real nausea... a bit ""dizzy"" and off balance but more funny than anything. I was so pumped my morning sickness was on its way out... nope! This morning I woke up -- heart palpitations, exhaustion, hungry/nauseous. Can I hire someone to reschedule the rest of my work day so I can go home and go to sleep? I need my pillows :( I have dinner with a friend after work too, luckily for only an hour or so, but I don't even want to do that at this point. I wonder if anyone will catch me napping under my desk?"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,tina3times,3,Thu Jul 9 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"Dude, does the friend know you're pregnant? Pregnancy is pretty much carte blanche to bail on stuff if you're feeling rotten. Give yourself permission to get the rest wherever possible. <3"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,healthylurker,2,Thu Jul 9 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"That stinks :( I had a lot of heart palpitations the first trimester. It freaked me out so much but I've been told it's normal since you're heart is working overtime now. And I totally get the not even wanting to hang out with your friend. When you feel sick, you have no desire to do anything. Even fun stuff feels like a chore! Hope you feel better soon!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,spankyjubblies,2,Thu Jul 9 15:44:24 2015 UTC,Its good to hear that someone else experienced them first hand -- I do get a bit worried! I think it may be a combo of PIO shots and my body producing progesterone as well... they still haven't gone away! Good grief :( If they don't by this afternoon I may email my nurse tomorrow!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,tina3times,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:05 2015 UTC,I had them on and off for prob 3-4 weeks then they stopped completely (though i wasnt on PIO shots). Def email your nurse if you're concerned! They are such a scary thing.. whether they are normal or not.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,handywife6,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't get palpitations but I did have tachycardia basically my entire pregnancy. Every time a nurse took my pulse she/he would say ""you're heart rate is high. Are you feeling dizzy or out of breath."" And I'd reply ""Is it 110? That's my new testing heart rate. I'm fine."" The day after I delivered my boys both my blood pressure and heart rate we're back to normal!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,cakegroove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:36:31 2015 UTC,"What was your heart rate prior to pregnancy? Mine is actually very, very low... like 50bpm low. Its naturally that way and actually helpful (I have very good endurance from it) I am wondering if the extra blood, etc is slightly raising my BPMs and I'm so used to being low that it feels like palpitations. Ill speak to my nurse about tachycardia!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,handywife6,3,Thu Jul 9 17:43:18 2015 UTC,My husband I went for a walk last night after dinner (we have a nice bike path that goes through our neighborhood) and I was showing him this ovia app I fiddled around with at work. I told him we were 5 weeks today and it became a big debate on why is it 5 weeks and not 3 from when we had our transfer - I made him go back and read in the app where it explains the first week starts at the beginning of your cycle and they start counting from there and not from when you actually get pregnant. I have to admit I agree with the way of calculating in some ways - especially since we know exactly how many days old our baby is - weird - but when I put in due date of March 9 and then look on the app for the date it says egg was fertilized it perfectly matches up to five days before our FET. After that realization he conceded and agreed on the five weeks.   This has by far been a period of the strangest conversations with my husband. Add that to the list of things you never thought you would ever have a discussion on  - but #1 weirdest convo this year has been deciding what sex embryo to transfer - how many people get to choose - it's just so strange - really we did PGS to try to lower miscarriage risk and knowing the sex was a bonus - just sooooo strange.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,cakegroove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:18:55 2015 UTC,My husband always called it fuzzy math :-) Definitely an added bonus to knowing what you're having!!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good way to put it - my husbands engineer brain can't get around the ""fuzzy math"" he wants accurate and precise, I told him that's just how it is"

InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"1 weirdest convo this year has been deciding what sex embryo to transfer - how many people get to choose - it's just so strange - really we did PGS to try to lower miscarriage risk and knowing the sex was a bonus   Did they give you the option of not knowing the sex? I've always thought it would be so weird to know the sex that early, but then the whole IVF process is weird and filled with strange conversations and circumstances."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,handywife6,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't ask if we would keep it a secret - they just told us and then a few days prior to transfer at my lining check she asked what sex we wanted to transfer. Since we had 3 boys and 1 girl we chose to do 1 boy and then would have done two of the boys if this hadn't worked the first time. I hope we get to have all of them eventually, but mostly I just hope we make it to the end with this first one"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,septicidal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting! I had assumed they would ask first.   I hope we get to have all of them eventually, but mostly I just hope we make it to the end with this first one   Totally understand! We only had two viable blastocysts to transfer, so we did both and I was thrilled both took. If only one had stuck it still would have been fabulous (yay baby!) but it would have been a little sad too, to know that one didn't make it. I dunno, it's weird maybe."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,cakegroove,2,Thu Jul 9 20:52:50 2015 UTC,"I find that I don't know how to feel most days - everything seems too surreal - I don't think there is a ""normal"" way to feel about any of this"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,3,Thu Jul 9 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"So, I definitely sprained my ankle. I can only walk without pain if it is immobilized. But the swelling isn't too bad so I am hopeful as long as I'm careful it will heal quickly. At least I already took today off to deal with the cabinet delivery.  My OB is also worried about my blood sugar... She wants me to do some dietary modifications and reassess in two weeks, possibly increasing my Metformin dose. She thinks my insulin resistance is probably in overdrive but it's not full blown gestational diabetes. I get to see a nutritionist tomorrow.  In better news, I finally got up the nerve to do a Facebook announcement: http://imgur.com/O1biLc8"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,GrammaMo,2,Thu Jul 9 15:19:38 2015 UTC,oh my gosh look at those superman outfits! what an adorable way to do that announcement!!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 9 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"Your Facebook announcement is fantastic! Congratulations! That's a big step.  So sorry to hear about the ankle. Rest up, you! Hope the cabinets are super fucking magical, after all the nonsense trying to get them!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,robyn_sparkles,2,Thu Jul 9 19:15:41 2015 UTC,Awesome announcement!! I love how you guys both happened to have pictures in superman outfits!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,female_engineer_here,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"Oh yuck on the ankle sprain. What a PITA.  How did the cabinet delivery go? After all the running around, I'm hoping it was super smooth!  What a sweet announcement! :) Super baby!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 9 22:35:15 2015 UTC,I'm 17 weeks now and I swear when I lay quietly in bed I can feel my stomach/uterus pulsing.  is that just the extra bloodflow? Am I just crazy? lol
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,skunk-works,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"OMG me too!  I've been convincing myself it's my heart, which often times I can feel beating harder than usual.  But sometimes it really does feel like it's in my lower abdomen too.  So weird.  I'm also 17 weeks."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:11:24 2015 UTC,Not crazy. : ) I feel my pulse like crazy in my hands and neck. It's a very odd sensation.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,PrincessCBHammock,3,Thu Jul 9 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"I'm currently in Huntsville on a business trip. It's actually been a really good (and productive) trip, but my wife put me on speaker phone earlier and both boys crawled over to get to the phone saying ""Hiiiiiiii dadadada"".    So we did a video call so that could see me and they both fought over who could be in front of the phone. That is until O grabbed it out of my wife's hand and hung up on me when he put it in his mouth."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,cakegroove,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:15:42 2015 UTC,That's so adorable!!! Hopefully it warmed your heart instead of making you homesick.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,traveler5678,5,Fri Jul 10 04:29:12 2015 UTC,"I'm reaching the ""EAT ALL THE THINGS"" part of the pregnancy. Fluffernutter sandwiches and Cape Cod reduced fat chips are my JAM.   Also A is saying ""mama"" on command about 25% of the time, the other 75%, I say ""ma-MA"" and he says ""DOGGIE!"""
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,spankyjubblies,3,Thu Jul 9 13:36:38 2015 UTC,I had to google fluffernutter.  Now I wish I hadn't because I'm going to have to get some marshmallow fluff now to make that!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,PrincessCBHammock,3,Thu Jul 9 14:15:52 2015 UTC,"Dawwww talking!!  Yknow, I bought marshmallow fluff once, to make rocky road ice cream with. And I saw my husband eating a Nutella and fluff sandwich.   I just can't do the fluff thing. I feel like I'm missing out."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jul 9 14:17:10 2015 UTC,We used to have fluffernutters for lunch when I was little.  Your post brings back memories!  I don't think I've eaten one for over 20 years.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 9 15:21:52 2015 UTC,I still can't believe you're pregnant again!! Does that mean I need to send back all the cute baby things? ;)
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,becabecaful,3,Thu Jul 9 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"No way! It's going to be totally opposite seasons anyway (and maybe a girl???). I can't believe it either. Like at allllll, I still can't believe I'm a mom to the boys!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,lancealittle,2,Thu Jul 9 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"""The Baby Who Thought His Mom Was a Dog""...seriously, though, awwww."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,PrincessCBHammock,2,Thu Jul 9 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I guess you know where you rank... Kids really know how to take it out of you, eh?"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,larabair,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"Holy crap that sounds incredible.  We can get marshmallow fluff in our international aisle (I'm in new Zealand) I might have to try it!   I've been craving savoury mostly. I ate a bag of cheese and bacon flavoured puffed corn chips called Rashuns the other day. So, so good."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,PrincessCBHammock,2,Fri Jul 10 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like I've had barely any sleep this week. It's probably all self inflicted from binge watching Netflix.  I also had a weirdo positive test yesterday afternoon. I took it after sex, just because I test randomly as I haven't had a period since we're bfing. It was all smudgey, but so pink and I got stupidly excited. Tested again later that evening because I knew it was invalid and it was definitely negative. I'm waiting on another test this morning just in case because my brain is being an asshole and playing ""what if"" with me. I know I'm not but hope sucks.  And I'm 90% sure my kid is already getting teeth."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 9 13:01:14 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Teeth at 4 months are SO unnecessary. My kid got her bottom two at 4 mos, then top two at 6."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,lancealittle,3,Thu Jul 9 13:21:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, so it happens. People keep telling me I'm nuts and no baby gets teeth this early.  But I feel something little and sharp poking sometimes during nursing."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,4,Thu Jul 9 13:31:51 2015 UTC,Oh it happens. Stock up on Tylenol.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,RositaYouBitch,2,Thu Jul 9 13:34:29 2015 UTC,For me or him? (We are in a similar boat.)
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,3,Thu Jul 9 13:49:50 2015 UTC,Him! Alcohol for you. The nip bites don't get too bad until they have both top and bottom.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 9 14:01:38 2015 UTC,He's not mad about it (yet) and I swear one has already broke through. He just chomps down on anything he can.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,lancealittle,3,Thu Jul 9 13:55:46 2015 UTC,Mine cut both bottom teeth before 4 months. He just got his top two. FOUR teeth. SIX months. It happens.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:00:25 2015 UTC,his two bottom are poking through. He'll be awfully cute with those 2 little teeth though.  He seems to be a good teether so far!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,montanadoodle,2,Thu Jul 9 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the two-bottom-teeth grin is adorable."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,montanadoodle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:32:04 2015 UTC,"I thought I would really miss the gummy smile, but the 2 bottom teeth are really stinking cute. Glad yours is a good teether! In the grand scheme of things, pretty sure mine is too. He really liked chewing on cloth - burp cloths and bibs went straight into his mouth!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,montanadoodle,3,Thu Jul 9 19:06:16 2015 UTC,I'm no expert but it seems like teeth do whatever the fuck they want. My SIL's little boy is 13 months and has no teeth. They are only just starting to think about coming in.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,montanadoodle,2,Thu Jul 9 14:54:31 2015 UTC,Hahaha that seems to be the long and short of it!
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,larabair,2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:59 2015 UTC,my niece on my husbands side started teething at 4 months and the first poked through at 7 months. my nephew on my side didn't start getting teeth until 11 months.   So clearly he's taking after my husband's side.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,cakegroove,2,Thu Jul 9 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"Apparently your kid sent a memo to my kid, because he's on the same damn tooth schedule. I swear, teeth at 4 months should be illegal."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:04:22 2015 UTC,"I used to ask her, ""what do you even NEED those for?? you're not eating food for MONTHS, kid!!"""

InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,yearofthecat,2,Thu Jul 9 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"Thinking about getting pregnant again gives me lots of feelings.   You're not nuts with the teething thing. Mine is teething too. Hasn't cut teeth yet but we're at chew on everything, drool like crazy, swollen gums, no sleep, etc."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:30:28 2015 UTC,It's messing with my head. I got so stupidly excited last night and told my husband that both babies would have close to the same birthday. He told me there likely isn't another baby so don't get my hopes up.  I'm glad he's rational for me.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,slumlord2001,3,Thu Jul 9 15:52:37 2015 UTC,Are you guys trying? Or just not not trying?   We do need rational sometimes.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,Semirelatednonsense,2,Thu Jul 9 16:02:32 2015 UTC,"Not like super seriously trying, but only because i know I'm not ovulating. But we want it to happen already.  My GP is going to talk about metformin again at 6 months and see if that helps, since clomid is a no go during nursing."
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,slumlord2001,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:09 2015 UTC,"You're brave. We're not using birth control at all, but I'm not sure I'm ovulating. I did get my period at 10 weeks postpartum. Just not quite ready to fully commit. More seeing how things go. We were in the unexplained infertility camp so I don't really know what to expect.   Did you not ovulate on your own before or is it because of breastfeeding?"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,cakegroove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:37:12 2015 UTC,Nope. No period no ovulation before from pcos. I thought I got my period but maybe not. Just weird light spotting for a few days in the past 2 months.  We really wanted a big family with our kids close in age. Hopefully we won't need another 4 years.
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,yearofthecat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:50 2015 UTC,"I've heard of postpartum periods as spotting. Mine were the opposite. Periods from hell.   We want the same thing. I still haven't quite decided when we're really going to start trying, probably somewhere in the 6-9 month range. I hope you get your babies sooner rather than later!"
InfertilityBabies,3co6yx,female_engineer_here,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"I hope so too. Not that I'm not enjoying this little boy, but I just want him to have lots of siblings like I did. I had such a fun childhood, and always had someone to play with."

I totally agree about the cooped up feeling though. And anytime you want to go somewhere it has to be a tour, which is $$$. My favourite vacation spot now is Costa Rica. We stay by the beach in a place with a kitchenette and can go into town for groceries or to check out local restaurants, which I like a lot better than constant resort buffets."

InfertilityBabies,3cl76v,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  particularly since most of us aren't high risk,  so there's no follow up until the NT scan at about 12 weeks. A lot of us find the drop off in monitoring really stressful.   May you have the most boring of pregnancies! But,  if something DOES happen, it's not worth calling  telehealth Ontario  - they think that all IVF pregnancies are high risk ( I had a bleed at about 10 weeks,  when I was coming off the estrogen,  and... It was a bit of a comedy of errors because they asked me the colour of my discharge and I said blue). Just call the clinic.   Hugs! I'm so happy you're here!"

They have way more hair than Isaac does, even now! Is that a ""we were always going to have lots of hair"" thing, or related to being preemies somehow? I always assumed that hair on the head grew at the end of gestation!  Edit to clarify my question."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,spankyjubblies,2,Wed Jul 8 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"I know! They're not the cutest pictures I have, but I think they're funny because they both look so skeptical.   I don't think it's typical because all the nurses are so surprised by how much hair they have, but I don't know for sure. They've had a full head since they were born."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,mrswhiskerson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:22:27 2015 UTC,I love the pictures of Isaac making ridiculous faces. The ones you shared are hilarious. So much personality in your little bubs!  Sounds like they were always going to have lots of hair. That's so cool!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,traveler5678,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:50:34 2015 UTC,Hair grows pretty early but just like at birth it really depends on the baby how much hair will be on the head. Many preemies have really hairy bodies for a while too but that falls out by term usually.

I know it's a good result, but I have this horrible voice in the back of my mind telling me something will go wrong. My husband wants to tell his dad next week when he's in town from Virginia, but it's so early and I'm so nervous I'll disappoint someone. I know how exciting it will be for his dad and we don't see him often. Just battling with myself over what the right step is.   Our first appointment is the 22nd and I'm so antsy for it to get here!"
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Semirelatednonsense,2,Wed Jul 8 15:44:41 2015 UTC,Congrats on the rising beta! sounds great!  here's how I felt about telling family early on.  I would want their support if something went wrong or if everything went just right.
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,GrammaMo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:42:21 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way... but I have one of the loudest mouth mothers on the planet. Everyone and their dog will know before I even get the sentences out. I feel like if I'll be telling my husbands father, I really just need to go ahead and tell everyone. Just to avoid any accidental incidents. I don't know. I've got a week to figure it out!"
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Semirelatednonsense,2,Wed Jul 8 16:45:54 2015 UTC,If you aren't ready to tell yet that's alright. I actually didn't tell anybody until 10 weeks because I was so nervous.
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"I love my mother. But it's hard to decide if I want to tell her until I'm sure. If something does go wrong, I don't know if I want to deal with her ""It is what it is time to move on"" attitude she has towards difficult situations. It's not her fault. It's how she's always dealt with things. But I'm decidedly more sensitive regarding these matters and she has a real hard time relating to it. I'm leaning towards letting my FIL know sooner, then telling my parents and MIL at a later date."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Iamagnu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:07:23 2015 UTC,That is totally a legit way to do things! I'm assuming your FIL can keep it to himself? It is totally fair to protect yourself and not share the news until you're ready!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:17:26 2015 UTC,He definitely will keep it to himself. He may tell his mother but shit she's 101 years old and I'm totally ok with her knowing as well. Husbands parents are divorced and there's sadly zero relationship between them so I know there won't even be an accidental slip. That and he's just a man of his word!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"I'm glad your betas are rising well! And so you know, I think everyone on this sub has had that feeling of nervous dread that something would go wrong. Totally normal. Keep breathing..."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Semirelatednonsense,3,Wed Jul 8 16:52:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've just spent way too much time around r/infertility and I'm all too aware of the risks. It would be nice to be blissfully unaware of all the things that could go wrong and be one of those people that doesn't find out their pregnant until way into it... but such is life. One day at a time!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,MrsDragon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"Wahoo! Good luck!  For us the litmus tests were (a) is this someone I would be comfortable telling if something went wrong and (b) will they tell the world. For us, that meant not telling all of the family at the same time, which was a little weird, but the right decision for us."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,handywife6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:03:29 2015 UTC,Thanks! I am excited and terrified all at once! I've had sore boobs and cramps since I first found out (no spotting) and I've started to find them somewhat comforting. As if it means everything is trucking along!   I think we will probably wait until after my first appt at least to tell his dad. He will still be in town and I'll be comfortable knowing things are well. It's just keeping it in until then!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"That sounds like the best of both worlds! It's so tough to keep happy news back though, especially when it's taking over your brain. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,handywife6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:57:34 2015 UTC,Hey we are right at the same stage! I had my 2nd hcg Tuesday went from 137 to 333! I have my first u/s on the 20th - according to calculations from date of 5day transfer baby is due March 9th for me. I bet you are due right around the same time! Fun to have someone right at the same timeframe as me!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:41 2015 UTC,Yay! Based on my wonky ovulation I'm due around March 14th! I'm sure I'll get a better idea when I meet with my doctor. I hope all is going well for you so far!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,handywife6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:03:25 2015 UTC,Weird how it's calculated differently when you do ivf - I think your due date may be different if you know exactly when you ovulated - otherwise if went my your period the date can be a week or more later - we'll see how it goes!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,becabecaful,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:21:14 2015 UTC,My last period started 5/31. But I went in for cd21 labs and they indicated I had not ovulated by that point. Cue me having a break down.   Something in me told me I was going to ovulate later though and we kept it up.. had lots of lower abdomen pinching around cd28 so I'm assuming I ovulated somewhere in there.   I'm still not 100% sure where I'm at week wise! Hoping the doc will fill me in a little better!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,razzertto,2,Wed Jul 8 20:35:36 2015 UTC,Wow what a contrast - before my ivf I was usually ovulating on day 10 or 11 and had 24 day cycles - we had all sorts of problems to get sorted out to get to this point  I bet at the first appointment they will do u/s and measure and know exactly how far along you are and give you a more accurate due date that way

InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,TigFan15,4,Wed Jul 8 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"Today's mantra is ""she means well"".  My mother hired a cleaning lady to deep clean the house (which is well intentioned) so yesterday was a flurry of ""Where does this go? Do you want this? Can I throw this out?"" which is really annoying when you can't just show her/put it there. This morning the cleaning lady arrived and I'm listening to my mom giving her the walk through in our bathroom and talk about what needs to be cleaned. ""The windows need to be cleaned. Like here, I'll show you (pulls up blinds). See? And they are all like that. They really need to be cleaned."" Uh? I'm sorry my house isn't up to your standards? Then she was apologizing that our bathroom counter had too much stuff on it. Yesterday she was squicked out that our front door had cobwebs on it (""And it's not Halloween!""). In Alabama. Living next to undeveloped property. Ugh.  I'm trying to take deep breaths and focus on the sweet intent (She wants our home to be comfortable! And to be clean for the baby shower this weekend! Much of this is her anxiety talking, it's not about judging us!). But it still feels very critical and rude."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's really irritating. She obviously does mean well, but ouch."

I saw in another comment your mom is coming for 3 weeks. Good luck! We're just over halfway through a 2 week visit and I think that's going to be about as much together time as I can take.

InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,RositaYouBitch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when she comes she stays until we both are annoyed with each other. This usually only happens once a year, however she'll come out again in October for the baby and stay who knows how long. I'm afraid that's not a large enough gap and she'll annoy me on day 2. In a perfect world she'd come out the day the baby is born but we'll see how I manage to plan that."

Now I'm considering the care.com one but don't love the $1k price tag!! I'm not comfortable doing it myself I think, so I was hoping others had found cheaper options for nanny taxes.   For the nanny herself I met her through an elderly friend who had a stroke and requires 24/7 caregivers. She's a substitute for her other caregivers when they're going on vacation etc."

Husband and I are going to take a trip for our anniversary and I'm drawing a blank on ideas.  Sanibel is the top contender right now.  On the flip side, I'm freaking out about being away from the boys for 4 days and I think this is a horrible idea. We NEED this vacation but is it too soon? It's in September."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,jos9143,3,Wed Jul 8 19:05:00 2015 UTC,they'll be nearly a year old by then...are they very comfortable with whom you'd be leaving them with?
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,LowOnHope,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, and yes. The one benefit of living with the in laws is the boys are perfectly content with them. I think I'm worried about enjoying myself too much and feeling guilty."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,kat_loves_tea,2,Wed Jul 8 19:49:34 2015 UTC,ohhhh....I would go!!! go go go!!!
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,jos9143,2,Wed Jul 8 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"Agree with kat loves tea. Also consider North Carolina if you are going Atlantic Coast.  Otherwise imo you can't go wrong with SoCal - the beaches are fantastic although the water is colder.  If you can splurge and it's reasonably close by flight, I strongly suggest Hawaii.  Btw only slight prob with September beach holidays on the Atlantic/Gulf/Carribbean is the small risk of a tropical storm or hurricane.  So get some travel insurance."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,kat_loves_tea,2,Thu Jul 9 00:34:09 2015 UTC,I hadn't considered tropical storms but that's a good point. I'm flying from St. Louis so I normally go east coast but there's nothing stopping me from going to the west coast I guess. Any cities in particular you recommend?
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,LowOnHope,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"I commented above about it, but Wooo! SoCal! Ok, I'll calm down now. I'm so excited for you guys!"

Kat should be your authority, not an East Coaster like me :)  Though if you want a bit more variety in terms of things to do besides the beach, San Diego has decent beaches and lots of sun, craft brews, and fish tacos.  However, I'd save the zoo for a visit with the kids someday."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,TigFan15,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:39:43 2015 UTC,"Oooh I love a good beach vacation. I think you totally deserve it! We've been everywhere as the beach is my Mecca and I return to it whenever possible. If you're thinking East, might I suggest South Carolina? Hilton Head island is gorgeous. Though, Florida is nice too. Or you could get crazy and fly into Houston/Galveston to go on a cruise for a few days to Mexico. Endless possibilities!!"
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,mrswhiskerson,2,Wed Jul 8 22:16:56 2015 UTC,Hilton Head made the short list. I'll have to look into it more. My husband has NEVER been to the beach. Ever. This is going to be big for him.
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,cakegroove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:50:10 2015 UTC,"Omg, never?! That's incredible sadness. The beach is most glorious. When my heart aches, the sound of crashing waves and sunlight kissing my skin will always soothe me. There's also California? Though I'm biased; we go every 6 months because my heart will forever live in California (as do a lot of my family and my bestie). Seal Beach (you'd fly into Long Beach) is so quaint and gorgeous but close to Huntington Beach which is busy and super surf territory. Little boutique shops, a small pier, close to lots of great food and things to do since Orange County is huge and gorgeous, etc. If you want pictures of S at Seal Beach having a glorious time, check my FB from February (further back and you get Mexico, Bahamas, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, etc etc beach junkie! lol.)    Hilton Head is gorgeous and slow paced for sure. Think Martha's vineyard mixed with southern charm. We rented a beach house there years ago. If your hubs likes golf, long walks, and quiet dinners this will be his jam!"
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:05 2015 UTC,"Walked into the biggest stressball at work today.  One of those days where my boss thinks I can read minds and gets mad that I didn't anticipate a problem I knew nothing about.  12 more weeks... just have to make it 12 more weeks then I'm out of here!    Side note, I'm 26 weeks now, does/did anyone else find the mornings are super difficult at this point?  My drives to work are agony (my back hurts, I'm tired from getting very interrupted sleep all night and my stomach is always upset, plus her kicks are getting stronger so that's a fun new pain) and then my walk across campus, which I used to love, seem like a marathon.  I seriously take 3 breaks now (it's Pittsburgh, so it's a hilly walk).  PHEW.  Pregnancy.... am I right?  Ok, rant over!  The good news is always that I'm even at this point and I'm thankful for that!!"
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jul 8 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"Getting paid for another US today! Hope she puts her hands down a little but even if all of the pictures are crummy I just enjoy watching her move and yawn and just be for those 30 min.   We finally finished painting our bonus room last night so we're close to being able to move the office in there to make room for this baby. But, we have to repaint several of the baseboards because the tape pulled off paint, ugh! Feels good to make progress especially since my mom is coming (in a week) and staying for three weeks, don't know how much we'll get down while she's here."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,cakegroove,2,Wed Jul 8 15:53:52 2015 UTC,"I bought new bras last night. I needed them even before I got pregnant, so it was a good excuse to buy some.  I thought I would buy underwires but they dug into my rib cage when I sat down.  Exchanged them at lunch today for non underwires. Oh and 2 cup sizes smaller because the lady that measured me last night measured me too big!  Tried to tell me I was an F. I about DIED"
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,Hopecat,6,Wed Jul 8 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"An F is not crazy huge! Some of my bras are 28 or 30F, and I don't have gigantic boobs. If you like, check out /r/abrathatfits and read their sidebar."
InfertilityBabies,3ck1gy,GrammaMo,2,Wed Jul 8 16:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yea, remember that cup size scales with back size! Volumetrically, an F cup on a 30 back is VERY different from an F cup on a 40 back. It's not like measuring cups where they stay constant. :) I've actually lost weight before and had my cup size go up because my boobs didn't change much, but my back size went down."

I was planning to go back 8/16 but may have to return sooner.   We're in the process of finalizing a nanny and general in-home childcare, and it turns out we have to pay employer taxes for it, so I've been researching that aspect and different programs. I think I'm going to use Intuit, but would welcome any suggestions. What do you folks use who have in home childcare?   Oh god I'm not ready to pay someone else to raise my kids. I'm freaking out."

Baby G measured exactly at 20 weeks, although was a kicking and punching wiggle monster that sat back towards my spine making it very difficult on the technician. He was doing very well, we are doing another scan at 24 weeks to check his heart again since we didn't get a very good look this time due to his position.  Apparently my uterus is tipped back towards my spine so that explains why I just have an itty bitty bump. We'll wait and see if I pop out eventually or if Baby G grows up under my ribs (oh joy).  The tech never even mentioned my blood clots so we can take a big breath of relief. HOWEVER, I do have marginal placenta previa, we're hoping at the 24 week scan that it'll have moved up and out of the way.  All in all, a very positive appointment. I may have to come out on FB now. Even Hubby is saying we should. I'll continue to think about it :)"

I am destined to spend my life surrounded by male creatures (we have three male cats, it's a trial at times since they all want to be king cat).  Other than that, on the way to the scan I tripped and wrenched my ankle. At least it was the good ankle, which hasn't had fractures and reconstructive surgery. It's sore but I can walk on it so it can't be that bad."

Anatomy scan was this morning and assuming no news/reaction from the tech is good news.  Baby is still measuring ahead so I've been officially moved from 11/29 (based on transfer) to 11/26 (based on EVERY exam) with the chance of it being adjusted again in the future.

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,cakegroove,3,Tue Jul 7 15:33:00 2015 UTC,"I'm all right.  Nothing super consistent but I am not feeling well.  Everything comes and goes so I haven't made another trip to L&D.  I honestly doubt I am dilating but the cramping, belly pain, insomnia, contractions have been an everyday thing for over a week now.    I'm assuming this is all normal for 3rd trimester and if I'm not able to time anything, or passing mucus plug, or bleeding - I am just OK.   I have a growth scan today at the MFM office.  If there is something wrong with placenta(I'm assuming there isn't but who knows at this point) they should be able to see something.  I will also get a piece of mind that the babe is growing right on track etc. so even if I go into labor early I won't be horrified.  I am also seeing my OB next week.  I bet she'll want to do another cervix check. Bleh...  Thank you for checking in on me!"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,vibeee,4,Tue Jul 7 16:02:52 2015 UTC,"Guys I was worried for nothing, M handled her vaccines like a champ! Didn't even flinch during the first shot and briefly cried after the second, but stopped before the nurse was even done putting the bandaid on! I think the doctor may have thought we might have been anti-vax at the beginning of the appointment because she talked about how she recommends doing all the vaccinations and doing them on the regular schedule.    We also asked the doctor about the safety of the Sophie teething toy because MIL was VERY concerned about the natural rubber exposure causing a latex allergy. I wasn't concerned, but wanted to be able to tell er that the doc gave it the ok. My doctor said it was fine and then added that she is only very strongly against amber teething necklaces. She works in the ER as well and saw an infant asphyxiate from one. So tragic, I can't even begin to imagine how awful that must be."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,GrammaMo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yay on the shots! Good job M! Do you think she maybe assumed about the vaccines because you're vegan?

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,pamplemousse2,2,Tue Jul 7 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure if she even knows I'm vegan. I've only ever mentioned that I don't eat dairy when talking about M's rash. But I mean, I had her at home with a midwife, I mentioned how I wanted her back in cloth diapers, I was wearing her in a ring sling and my shoes are made entirely out of rope. I guess I am like a walking piece of crunchy granola haha!  And yeah, I didn't realize how awful the amber necklaces could be. I thought they were like ""probably don't help, but can't hurt"" but didn't realize people would leave a baby unattended with something around their neck! So sad, especially being entirely preventable."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,GrammaMo,2,Tue Jul 7 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"Are you in an area where anti-vaxxers are common? I know our pediatrician has made a point of mentioning it, but that's because apparently we are having a whopping cough outbreak here so they are pushing to get the info out.

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jul 8 02:55:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's too common here. I'm Ina pretty small town and we haven't had any outbreaks, although the closest city to us has had a few cases of measles. I think I just seem too crunchy, but I am 100% in support of vaccines!"

It's a good thing I have work because otherwise I think I'd be getting very little done. My mom is here visiting and she's very ""go-go-go"" and it's helpful but also really annoying. She keeps deciding things need to happen (like apparently our guest bathroom was not up to snuff because we ""needed"" new towels, hand towels, washcloths, and a rug) and then wanting me to make decisions (what type of rug? what color do I want?). And I'm sitting in bed going ""I didn't even want the stupid rug in the first place!"" But I can't get too mad, she's only trying to help and she is getting a ton of necessary stuff done too."

I can't imagine how big they are going to be closer to the end of my pregnancy. Lord help me! I miss my small titties :(
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,TigFan15,3,Tue Jul 7 21:52:59 2015 UTC,Funny you should post this because I must be going through a boob growth spurt or the ducts are doing something crazy but MAN have mine been throbbing lately.  Feels like when I first got pregnant all over again.  Can't wait for breast feeding...
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,spankyjubblies,3,Tue Jul 7 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"I squeeze them for 20 minutes 8x a day to try and get more milk out!

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,pamplemousse2,2,Tue Jul 7 14:34:56 2015 UTC,Would one of the OBs at the hospital write you a script?
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:43:13 2015 UTC,I finally got through and they sent it to my pharmacy. Hopefully it'll help because I've been stuck at 10-12oz a day for weeks.

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"Sebastian came off c-pap early on Thursday, but yesterday he started having trouble again so after trying a high flow cannula for a while he went back on c-pap. Seems like they'll reevaluate in a few days. Asher came off on Sunday as scheduled but he only lasted about 2 hours before needing to go on the cannula - but that's still forward progress and the cannula is much less uncomfortable for him and easier to do kangaroo care with."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:14:17 2015 UTC,Yay! Glad that there's some forward progress! Isaac was on nasal cannula the whole time he was in the NICU (his discharge condition was to be off of it for 24hrs). Definitely easy easier to manage than cpap. Here's hoping both boys are if the cpap in a couple of days!

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,dutchqueen,2,Tue Jul 7 15:33:24 2015 UTC,My boobs have shrunk since I got pregnant with #2. I think it's because my milk seems to be drying up at an alarming rate. WTF boobs? This wasn't supposed to happen until 20 weeks.
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,justcurious12345,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:06:03 2015 UTC,"I never even heard about drying up, people keep telling me the taste will change and the babies will reject it. How are you feeling?"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,healthylurker,2,Tue Jul 7 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"Just starting to feel vaguely crappy most mornings but usually okay by the afternoon. It's still really early though. I have my first ultrasound in a couple of weeks, so I'm treating the nausea as a good sign that things are okay right now. I saw that you're not feeling well either. It sucks to feel bad when you have a baby (or babies!) to chase around all day.  The milk drying up was pretty disappointing. I went from low/medium supply (~0.8 oz per hour) to pretty terrible (~0.4 oz per hour). I've been supplementing with some leftover formula samples and topping off daycare bottles with whole milk, since the baby will be one in a week and a half."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,justcurious12345,2,Tue Jul 7 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"For those currently pregnant, how much weight have u gained? In my 17th week, and I'm up 10 pounds. That sounds like a lot upfront.. no?"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,healthylurker,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm 17 weeks tomorrow and I've lost weight , not gained yet. The doctors dont seem worried about it yet."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,justcurious12345,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"38w, 30 lbs on the dot so far. They measure right on track.  I never worried about it, and my doctor hasn't either.  I just ate when I was hungry (and early on, I was hungry alllllllll the damn time).  It fluctuates.  You might gain a whole bunch at first, slow way down, then gain more at the end.  Or, nothing at first and then gain rapidly in the middle, and nothing at the end. etcetc.   Keep on doin' what'cha doin'.  It's better to eat when hungry.  You need it for you!  It's liable to slow down anyways as you may find you can't eat as much when baby is bigger."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:41:58 2015 UTC,"It depends on your starting BMI too, I think.  I'm fat enough to start that if I only gain 11-20 lbs for the whole pregnancy that's healthy.  If you're underweight to start, that would definitely not be enough."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,becabecaful,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty average, so I think I'm in the 25-35 pound range (though most people I know never stay within that limit.. eek)"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,TigFan15,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:54:30 2015 UTC,"Then 10lbs halfway through seems reasonable to me, but I'm not a doctor :)  Did you lose weight during your first trimester?  That could influence things too."

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"Dude, during survival mode, anything goes. I was eating so much at first just to try not to puke. Like the options were ""eat while not hungry"" or ""throw up"". Loooots of snacks. So I totally feel you. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,ReindeerPoopRVA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"No gain yet, I've lost around 9lb (4kg) in 5 weeks. Mostly contributed to not eating so much crap food and struggling to eat big meals. Hopefully gain some back soon. I struggle to think in pounds, but pregnancy does weigh a lot so your gain is probably totally normal?"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,HerVoiceEchoes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:48:15 2015 UTC,I'm 26 weeks up 20 lbs but I lost 7 my first trimester. If you were a healthy weight to start then the goal is 25-35 lbs overall. My dr said everyone has a big jump in gaining at some point. I think you're doing just fine at 10 when you're almost halfway.
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:10:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is a useful comparison (because twins), but I'm at 25 weeks and I've gained just under 30lbs. It's pretty much all belly and I'm trying to eat only when I'm hungry/what I'm hungry for (trickier than normal when you can't serve your own portions for most meals). My doctors have pretty much ignored my weight. I mean they check it, but no one has mentioned it as a concern."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,HerVoiceEchoes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:59:40 2015 UTC,"My last pregnancy I gained so much so early and had no belly until I was like 22 weeks, I just kept eating. As long as your OB doesn't voice concern, I wouldn't worry too much."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,pamplemousse2,2,Tue Jul 7 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"I'd like it if my boobs grew again. They've looked like sad pancakes ever since I weaned my son. And now that I'm losing weight (over 10 lbs beneath my pre-pregnancy weight!), they are sadder than ever. 36A/34B. D:  My son (17 months old today, ohmigod time has flown!) has been weaned for six months now and tried to nurse last night (either that or he just thought it'd be funny to bite my boob). He has 13 teeth and I wasn't expecting it. Fucking ow.  He's a cutie though so I forgave him immediately. When I yelped and told him ""Ow, that hurts!"", he looked at me with sad eyes, asked ""Momma?"" and then threw his arms around my neck to hug me. Then he leaned down and banged his mouth against my boob and then gave another hug and smiled. I think that was him kissing me better. Totally cute."

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,HerVoiceEchoes,2,Tue Jul 7 16:35:06 2015 UTC,I was just talking about how sad mine look this weekend... I can't believe you guys tried to nurse last night! Our babies are turning into little boys!

InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,Iamagnu,2,Wed Jul 8 13:06:58 2015 UTC,"So, please please please try not to worry about your boobs right now. Half a cup size to a whole cup size is probably what mine grew in pregnancy, asking with nipple changes. This is another one of those bridges that you don't need to cross until you get there (the good news being that there are some measures you can take to boost supply of need be). If your really concerned though, look into supplemental nursing systems - so you can get the experience of nursing why supplementing if need be.  Hooray for cabinets! I hope there packing goes well!"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,dutchqueen,2,Tue Jul 7 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"Just got back from getting an X-ray of my foot. They had me sign a disclaimer about whether or not I could be pregnant. I checked off the 'no' box but evidently missed the section below asking how I was sure. It listed things like birth control, hysterectomy; obviously infertile was not one of them, so I had the little doe-eyed med student check off the 'other' box and I just said I was still breastfeed. A lie. But so much easier than the truth. She seem stumped but marked it down anyway. Crazy that they would require you to disclose so much detail."
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,septicidal,4,Tue Jul 7 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"They have you disclose it because if you're just guessing you aren't pregnant, get an X-ray, and there are any complications in a pregnancy because of the X-ray, they can be sued. The disclaimer with the reason the patient says they know they aren't pregnant is what they will whip out if they do ever get sued for a pregnancy complication someone is claiming was caused by an X-ray.  I got a MRI 4 years ago at a place that didn't take ""I'm infertile"" as a valid reason to know I wasn't pregnant and made me test. I was angry for years about it, up until I got my positive pregnancy test (my son was a natural surprise). They can't afford to take chances because of how litigious our society is. It sucks. It really does.  I hope your foot is okay!"

I'm already decorating the new place in my head (and pinterest).  I have one more NST this week...then bloodwork next Tuesday, followed by a final NST.  My friends have all started taking (non-official) bets on whether I'll make it all the way to next Thursday (scheduled c-section, 7:30 in the morning!).  They asked what day I wanted.  I picked Thursday lol.  No one thinks I'll go past the weekend, but I'm pretty sure I might as well sign up to run a marathon on Saturday.  Edit: also, no boobs during pregnancy! But I'm ok with this.  They've always been a big...larger than I'd like, and I worked hard to lose 30lbs about 6 years ago.  I was actually really worried they'd come back.  As long as they function, I'm good with where they are!  I'm also not even leaking or anything, so I tend to forget about them most of the time :)"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,justcurious12345,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, all this talk about Reglan makes me wonder if that's what's been up with my boobs the past few days.  The water pressure during my shower this morning was super uncomfortable, let alone anything else.  The Reglan does help with my unrelenting nausea but I've been concerned about having very little breast change with pregnancy.  Between PCOS and fitting the visual markers for hypoplastic breasts, very little breast change during pregnancy can be a sign of insufficient glandular tissue and primary lactation failure.  I would really like to breastfeed, if only partially because I want to save money and formula is expensive.  I know formula feeding is fine, but I would like the experience of breastfeeding and I feel like I've had so many other ""natural"" aspects of this road to motherhood denied to me.  I've gone up half to maybe a whole cup size, but nothing that dramatic and nothing like everyone else seems to experience.  My nipples look crazy different though, so that's something.  In less angsty/fretting over my boobs news, MY CABINETS ARE BEING DELIVERED.  On Thursday! Ahead of schedule by an entire DAY! After all of the delays and nonsense, this is a very good thing.  Now I have to work on packing up my kitchen tonight and tomorrow, and separating out stuff to donate/get rid of. My husband picked up tons of boxes from friends who just moved last night, so we have plenty of packing supplies.  Plus tomorrow (just 25.5 hours) is attempt number two at figuring out the baby's sex.  Here's to hoping he or she decides to cooperate this time."

I just don't know!  It's driving me mad!  I want to feel my baby and be reassured it's alive!"
InfertilityBabies,3cfdt2,Hopecat,3,Tue Jul 7 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"For sure crazy! The baby is soooooo tiny right now! I had my anatomy scan at 18 weeks and she was fully karate kicking me almost the whole time and I didn't feel a thing.

And I think probably 60% of what some people claim to feel at 16-18 weeks IS gas, it's just that some of it might not be. My first pregnancy I didn't feel anything until after 20 weeks, and this time I think I felt movement that I could be more confident was movement around 18 weeks, but it was fleeting and then days would go by without anything.

It's all black magic, just have to hang in and try your best. Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,OrganizedSprinkles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:45 2015 UTC,What does gonal f do compared to clomid or femara?
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,larabair,2,Tue Jul 7 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"The major thing for me - it had no side effects to my mental health, (the theory is it's targeted to the location required instead of being whole body oral) unlike clomid which made me go a wee bit crazy. Oh and I got pregnant on gonal f and an IUI instead of my two failed clomid cycles. ;)  Note - I had more follicles on clomid and only one on GF. There's a lot more dosing control with injectibles.   Also note - not unexplained. PCOS but still ovulated and had somewhat regular cycles (thank you metformin.)"
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,handywife6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:05:22 2015 UTC,"Gonal f is an injectable vs clomid and femera being oral medications - injections like gonal f and follistim will make more follicles mature - they are usually combined with a trigger shot.   We did four iui cycles - 2 with clomid and 2 with femera - they didn't work  My ivf cycle we used gonal f, menopur, ganirelix and ovidrel for trigger shot - with the higher doses of that I got all eight follicles I have left to produce an egg - on the clomid I only ever got one on each side (that was before I lost my ovary and suffered damage to my left ovary) if I hadn't lost my ovary we may have still had success with iui"
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,handywife6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:21:02 2015 UTC,So it sounds like gonal F is an FSH instead of clomid and femara being a estrogen blocker?

InfertilityBabies,3cfows,rawkfemme,2,Tue Jul 7 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"I was largely unexplained,  but probably PCOS. At the time i didnt ovulate at all. Too many years of BCP and depo shots screwed my system up. We did clomid  (150 mg), then a trigger shot, then IUI followed by crinone. I was also on synthroid, cabergoline, and a prenatal. We got pregnant on our  3rd round and I now have a 3.5 month old son."

I'm quite over weight which I've also read can have some effects on egg quality.  I'm hoping my 'actual' diagnosis might be annovulation due to poor egg quality.

InfertilityBabies,3cfows,justcurious12345,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:50:51 2015 UTC,"They offered us the option of TI instead of IUI, but my health insurance is really good, so we figured why fuck around (pun intended) when we can have science on our side? We had already been trying on our own for 2 years (which I was never actually ovulating for. grrrrrr) so we were impatient. IUI gave us the best statistics,  so we went for it."

InfertilityBabies,3cfows,Bhotel21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"Have you been tested for insulin resistance? (Checking A1C or fasting glucose only will not shed any light on insulin levels, you need fasting insulin and fasting glucose done at the same time, and/or a glucose tolerance test with insulin levels.) If you do have insulin resistance, Metformin may be helpful with weight loss and restoring ovulation/follicle quality.  I was evidently insulin resistant for years and no one checked me.  There's a lot of talk about insulin resistance being formally added to the PCOS diagnostic criteria. With hormone levels and trying to conceive... My RE (who specializes in PCOS) said that while the cutoff for ""high"" testosterone is officially 50, she likes to see it closer to 35 for natural conception.  If your testosterone is between 35-50 it would be borderline high and contribute to a PCOS diagnosis based on some endocrinologist's assessment.  DHEA-S also needs to be checked, not just testosterone.  My testosterone was higher than the cutoff but it was my DHEA-S that was more than double what it should be.  Some REs only check testosterone and not DHEA-S.  I will say that I had much better success with Femara than Clomid.  It didn't dry up my CM, and I responded well with just one follicle per cycle (I was over-responding to Clomid).  We did IUIs because it was advised with Clomid (since that dries up CM) and we needed the pressure to perform off of our sex life.  They still had us do timed intercourse the night of triggering with the IUI 36 hours later, but my current pregnancy was definitely from the IUI (based on dating ultrasound and the fact that my husband's total motile count was inexplicably lower than normal, way too low for a natural conception to have occurred that cycle)."
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,Bhotel21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"My RE, an endo about 6 years ago, and 2 OBs have all ruled out PCOS and insulin resistance. I still think met would be fantastic for me, but no one will prescribe since I'm A-ok! Can't complain about not having issues, I guess.   We've done 3 monitored rounds of 150 clomid + Ovidrel. I do dry out like whoa so I am hoping that is part of the issue and the IUI will do the trick. It could be any number of other issues that we don't know about though, unfortunately. I guess that's my fear right now. My RE never said anything like ""it could be genetics, etc."" It wasn't until a friend mentioned that ""unexplained"" really meant ""It's something we don't know and can't easily find out yet"" that I really started to panic about things.   Congrats to you.  I hope to be over here some day with good news."
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,Bhotel21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:20:34 2015 UTC,My doctor really encouraged IUI with clomid because of how it messes with your cervical mucous.
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,Bhotel21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:45:59 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that will be the missing link.  I did use a bit of preseed a couple times but my clinic told me not to.
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,Bhotel21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"And that's only on the outside of the cervix.  The sperm have to get through the cervix, and you can't really get preseed inside of it!"

InfertilityBabies,3cfows,Iamagnu,2,Tue Jul 7 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"We did IVF and were successful but I wanted to speak on ""unexplained."" It may give you some hope. Something like 50% of infertile couples under the age of 35 are ""unexplained."" Clinics don't often spend a lot of time trying to find a true diagnosis unless the condition is causing other symptoms that need to be addressed like PCOS or severe endometriosis or if the condition is easily identifiable like MFI.   I most likely have endo. I have every single marker including a diagnosed primary relative. However, it can only be diagnosed through laparoscopic surgery. I didn't have the surgery but instead went straight to IVF so I'm technically marked as ""unexplained.""  The good news is the unknown feeling of being unexplained does not mean you're out! Many, many people are unexplained and find success through all kinds of methods besides IVF. You're not even close to alone being diagnosed as unexplained and you're certainly not out!"
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,Iamagnu,2,Tue Jul 7 18:15:56 2015 UTC,I'm also unexplained and I suspect endo is the cause.  Never had the laparoscopic surgery to prove it though.
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,reidiate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:40:01 2015 UTC,"I guess it is true that it's kind of a broad range. But so is the range of things that could be ""wrong"". And like you said, unless it's something clear its not likely that a cause will be found.   But that doesn't really change the fact that they give 2-3% success rates for unexplained at my age. Those are SHIT numbers."
InfertilityBabies,3cfows,healthylurker,2,Tue Jul 7 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"After many failed rounds of clomid, then femara with timed intercourse, a cocktail of gonal-f, trigger shot, IUI, and progesterone support did the trick!

InfertilityBabies,3cfows,healthylurker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:15 2015 UTC,Were you growing follicles on clomid and femara? It kind of sounds like gonal-f might help the eggs mature better?

It was a lucky cycle all around."

For me it's a weird uncomfortable feeling, maybe not a burn but a super tightness in my lower belly. It seems to correlate with a major bump growth spurt. I googled it and it sounded normal but if you feel super uncomfy then it's definitely worth calling your OB!"
InfertilityBabies,3cf8rm,kml327,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:59:35 2015 UTC,"A major growth spurt is my theory too!

InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,RositaYouBitch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:44:30 2015 UTC,"I need this info too. We're just getting settled so I'm curious if we can even be in a routine. Pond does not nap during the day. I finally got a swing yesterday so I got 1 45 min nap out of him today but otherwise, he'll doze here and there but no real naps. As far as bedtime, his witching hour starts around 630 and he'll scream for a while. Then around 730 he calms down enough to feed him and during that feeding he gets very sleepy. That has become bedtime. At 8pm, almost on the dot his crabby time is done so we do diaper and jammies and lay him down. Eventually I plan to add a book and a snuggle in the rocker but his room is still not unpacked. He was letting me sleep about 5 hours at a stretch when we were in PA but since we got into our new house we're back to about 3 hours. I'm hoping he'll adjust soon and get back to sleeping longer."
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,messofletters,2,Tue Jul 7 01:15:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing what you do! I hope he goes back to better sleep habits soon.  My kid sometimes flips out at diaper and wardrobe change times, so I don't think we could lay her down right after that,"
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,messofletters,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"D is almost 4 months, but we started really timing naps and bedtime about 2 weeks ago. Maybe we waited too long, who knows.  We co sleep with him, and haven't attempted to transfer him to his crib. Not even for naps. He sleeps in the middle of our bed with a pillow on either side. He goes down for his first between 9-10, then has his second around 1-2. His bedtime starts at 7, and we do a quick bath before putting him to sleep.  He will sleep anywhere though. Living room, bedroom, kitchen. We tried to not be quiet so he can sleep through the noise.  I used to just let him sleep on my chest citing it was because he wouldn't go down anywhere else, but really I just liked the cuddles.  EDIT: I had no idea how to do any of this, one weekend my husband just took him and put him to sleep in the morning. We did some chores. He woke up. Then he was getting cranky again so my husband put him down again. I was worried it would affect his sleep at night but it hasn't. So it was completely his idea."
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,razzertto,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks--this makes me feel a little better that we're just starting to better observe her sleep patterns!  I often see people talking about a bath right before bed and it makes sense, but, while my baby loves baths, she cries a lot afterward, during the drying phase. Not sure I could get her down directly after. Any tips?"
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,messofletters,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:13:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have any tips :( he loves baths and he almost loves getting his hair (what small amount there is) ruffled and dried afterward.  He's most happy during and after a bath that I've seen actually. And I just got curious, turns out he's a Pisces lol"
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,Aventurijn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:42:09 2015 UTC,"I know diddly-squat about babies and I'm just going to tell you what I'm doing as of now. LL is about 3.5 months at this moment, so I'm just ahead of you.   Starting about a month ago, I shifted LL's nighttime routine to begin at 9:15-9:30. I put her in her little sleep suit (I love the sleep suit that I'm using these days), take her into our room that's been prepped so the white noise machine is on, the lights are off, and the ac is running cool. I nurse her for probably about 30 minutes or more and she typically falls asleep and I put her in her cosleeper/bassinet thingy (we do not bed-share, we only room-share). Most nights this routine is successful and she's out by 10:30 at the very latest. Once in a while she'll wake back up and want to nurse for another 10-15 minutes and then she goes back down. Then, about 3-4 am either I wake up engorged and in pain and I do a dreamfeed or she whines a bit to wake me up and feed her. This feeding typically takes no more than 15 minutes and she goes back to sleep for at least four more hours. I also take this time to pump off milk from the other breast with a manual pump, this typically takes 2-4 minutes. I know we are about to enter a sleep regression phase that I can see on the horizon because she's not staying asleep quite as well most mornings but I'm working on it. I'm still wondering if I should move her routine up and get started a bit earlier but I really don't want her getting up at 7 am if I can help it because it would just be horrible for my mental health.    As for naps, I used this chart (link to google doc, not mine) to determine how long she should be awake. I notice that she gets cranky if she's awake longer than 1.5 hours, shoot, at 1.25 hours she's already getting a bit whiny, so I stay on top of it and make sure she gets her naps in. A typical day will have four naps varying from 1.75 hours to 35 minutes. The morning nap is the longest and most reliable. She will go down for a nap 1.5 hours after waking up and sleep until noon, I put her in the swing for this nap and I try to keep the house quiet because she's a light sleeper. Then begins our cycle of naps for the rest of the day. Some of these naps will be in her bassinet, some will be in her carseat if we're out and about (but I never let her nap in her carseat at home, it's dangerous), some naps will be when I'm wearing her. I follow her sleepy cues and try to get her down when I see her yawning or her eyes look heavy, or she's doing that whiny cry that is not at all her hungry cry, if you listen you can tell the difference. I'm also ok with rocking her or nursing her to sleep for naps.   I can't say that this will work forever, I'm sure shit will change tomorrow but this is what has worked for us for roughly a month, so... take that for what it's worth."
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,cakegroove,2,Tue Jul 7 02:36:03 2015 UTC,Oh wow thanks for the chart! That's super helpful! Family keeps giving me mixed messages (baby needs to sleep to grow! Keep him awake during the day so he sleeps at night!)  Knowing D should generally only be awake 1.75 hrs at a time makes sense. Maybe his 2 long naps aren't enough! I just feel bad because when husband comes home it seems like he gets to put him to bed and then that's it.
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,Aventurijn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"Some of these naps will be in her bassinet, some will be in her carseat if we're out and about (but I never let her nap in her carseat at home, it's dangerous),   What's dangerous about it? If R fell asleep in his carseat, most of the time, I would just take the carseat out and carry him inside and let him sleep. I know that it's not good for him to spend too many hours in there (because the position is not flat, yadie, yada), so I never put him in his carseat intentionally for naps... And when he was a really tiny newborn I would get him out. But after a while, I didn't bother anymore. If he fell asleep and did not wake up? I would just let him sleep. Why mess with a sleeping baby?"

InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,razzertto,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:20:04 2015 UTC,"Ow. Really? But that could happen in the car too, right? How is that safe... Does that happen with infant car seats too? But you're right, it's not a bed. It's not flat. So it's not a natural sleeping position. I always put him in a corner of the room so that I could still have an eye on him - just in case..."
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,Aventurijn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"In the car, when properly installed, they are kept at a specific incline.  When the carseat is being carried around and set on various surfaces inside, the correct angle may not be maintained which is the cause for concern."
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,Aventurijn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:19:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's infant car seats. They're designed to have a specific angle that is achieved in their base. When you take them out the bottom of the seat does not sit properly on other surfaces to achieve that angle so a baby can lean forward and cut off their airway."
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,Aventurijn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:22:52 2015 UTC,"I see. Gosh, I never read the instructions properly, I guess. We have one of those isofix bases, with a flexible incline so I thought it didn't really matter. Today I learned!"
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,skunk-works,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:01:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't know this either! Like you, if she falls asleep in the car, I carry the carseat in and let her keep napping. If it's an incline issue though, we can probably safely bring the carseat with sleeping babe in, then snap it in the stroller base, no?"
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,RositaYouBitch,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"I would assume so. If the risk is air blockage, that could happen too while you're holding the baby, or if it falls asleep in the bouncer, or in a sling or any sleeping position that is not absolutely flat.  Anyways. I was told that the main issue with sleeping in carseat is the curve of the spine and that's why it's not good for a baby to spend too much time in there. And also because people tend to put carseats with babies on couches and tables which is dangerous once the baby wakes up.  I always just put the carseat on the ground in the living room where I could keep an eye on him. I would also keep the straps on, so that he could not slide down. And if he did not wake up on his own after 30 min or so, I would wake him up gently. But at least he got a good nap by then."
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,skunk-works,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:52:41 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for all this detail! What's the source for the chart?"
InfertilityBabies,3cd2oy,montanadoodle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"At 2 months, R's schedule was something like this: sleep from 11 PM - 8 AM, feeding/boob and then I put him back in his bassinet to sleep some more, which he did 75% of the time, until 10-11ish. Then I fed him again, he was awake for a while, and after two hours or so, I put him down for a nap. Then he slept, when he woke up, I fed him. Etc. The feed-play-sleep cycle took about 3-to-4 hours in total and was repeated throughout the day. Always stick to the feed-play-sleep cycle! If he was awake for more than 1,5 hours, I put him down for a nap. If he would not nap, I would carry him or put him in a sling to get some sleep. Because if he did not nap, he would cry because he was tired.   This did not always work, mind you. Some afternoons, we spend on the couch because he would not nap but get so tired that he just cried and cried and cried. And in the evenings, he would cry from 8-10 PMish often, because he was tired but would not sleep. Or was hungry. Or whatever. Anyways. We got into the schedule because I wanted to stay up late so that my SO could get some sleep (he gets up really early and goes to bed early too, and the baby's schedule was off with his schedule, so yeah, we improvised...), and then I brought him up at 11 PMish to feed him in the bed and he would sleep until 8. Yay.   The best advice that I ever got was NOT to keep your baby awake during the day. Baby needs to sleep during the day in order to be able to sleep at night."

I would sit your husband down and tell him to help mediate with his mother, and if things can improve in X amount of days/weeks, you're moving to an apartment with or without him until you have a new house.  You don't need to deal with this sort of stress on top of house hunting and day-to-day raising of twins."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 6 16:31:17 2015 UTC,Holy shit balls. Can I get a punch in?
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,lancealittle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:52:49 2015 UTC,Please do. I've punched her so many times in my mind.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,LowOnHope,2,Mon Jul 6 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm so sorry! Throwing your food away?!? I'm angry for you! Living with family can be hard but this lady has a real chip on her shoulder. Good luck with dealing with her, I just don't even know what to say."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,mrswhiskerson,2,Mon Jul 6 13:56:58 2015 UTC,That last one made my blood boil!!  Wow!!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,TigFan15,2,Mon Jul 6 13:57:36 2015 UTC,I've got a cool hundred waiting for you. Take her out!   PS. When are you moving out?
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,razzertto,2,Mon Jul 6 14:31:02 2015 UTC,Still looking for a house. Ours just sold so hopefully not too much longer!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,LowOnHope,2,Mon Jul 6 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I am so sorry you have to deal with that. Do you know when you will be moving out or is it more open ended?   This won't help with bail money, but it might make you feel better, the blog Captain Awkward is full of letters from people with parents and in-laws doing similar things. http://captainawkward.com/ (Did I already share this with you? I know I linked it for someone not too long ago.)"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:32:29 2015 UTC,Captain Awkward is sooooo good!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:55:01 2015 UTC,Yes! She has a way of breaking things down so well.

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,jaina_jade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:25:49 2015 UTC,Oh good! I'm glad you've found them useful. :)  I really like the way she breaks stuff down. It's like free therapy.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jul 6 19:02:37 2015 UTC,Can I get in line for helping??? Holy fuck - she's actively awful! How long is THIS situation going to last?
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:54:29 2015 UTC,We are house hunting now. So hopefully just another month but I'm not sure I'm going to make it.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,LowOnHope,2,Mon Jul 6 14:57:57 2015 UTC,"Can you air bnb a place? Like, seriously..."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 6 19:34:41 2015 UTC,Holy shit.  How much longer do you have to take it?  She is obviously nuts!!!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,vibeee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:00:02 2015 UTC,Maybe just another month but maybe more. Not knowing is the hard part. If she gets much crazier I'll be on the hunt for an apartment.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,LowOnHope,3,Mon Jul 6 15:50:00 2015 UTC,Hang in there.  Sounds like confronting her may make things worse.  She definitely has some issues and they won't get resolved in a month.  I feel for you.  I really do. Hugs!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,vibeee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:50:03 2015 UTC,"OMG, some people need serious help. I wonder if family realize that their involvement in YOUR child's life is by choice and isn't something you HAVE to do. Ugh. She sounds like a vindictive self-centered twat who enjoys being in control and so when she doesn't get her way takes it out in ridiculously petty ways."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,11,Mon Jul 6 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"He's signing! He's signing ""Milk!"" He mostly does it when he eats (boob OR bottle, my smart little boy!) - he's like ""Milkies! Dudes, there's milkies here! Miiiilkies!"" but he's starting to ask for it too (an part of me suspects he does it as a delaying tactic at nap time - is that even possible at 6 months???)  I'm preeetty damn excited."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jul 6 15:01:17 2015 UTC,That's when S was starting!! So exciting! Communication is so helpful and it's such an exciting journey. Congrats mama!!    Also the signing for milk at nap time is totally a thing. It's a comfort nursing request and they sneak it right in there... So sweet.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,kat_loves_tea,4,Mon Jul 6 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you! And that's good to know... he'll sign for milk at nap/bed time, even when he CAN'T be hungry (like, he just ate), but always when my husband is putting him down. Makes so much sense! And omg my heart is melting."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jul 6 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"Oh girl, just you wait. It gets cuter! Today S ran over to the dishwasher where I was rinsing and loading and signed and said help. I thought she needed something so I was asking like help with what? She kept saying mama. She wanted to help me! :D"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,kat_loves_tea,2,Mon Jul 6 20:12:20 2015 UTC,Omg I would have died from the cute! How sweet!!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,GrammaMo,2,Mon Jul 6 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"I can't even. So much cuteness. And your other comment where she's hungry in the morning. Any more, and I think I'll explode from teh cuuuute!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:17:26 2015 UTC,Hahaha.. She sure knows how to work it!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"That is exciting! He's communicating!   LL is nearing four months, I should really start with the signs. Did you use any specific resource? And when did you start?"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,razzertto,3,Mon Jul 6 15:28:25 2015 UTC,"SUPER exciting.  /u/kat_loves_tea shared a link for the sleep sign with me to this site, and it's pretty great. You might want to start here: http://www.babysignlanguage.com/dictionary/first-signs/ We started with milk when eating, more to get ourselves in the habit than anything else. We did it a little bit when he was 4 mo (I think!), got out of the habit, and have been doing it pretty consistently for a few weeks now. He's started signing way sooner than I thought he would!  Right now we're using milk, more, all done, up, sleep. I want to introduce a sign for diaper changes soon, but don't want to do too much too fast!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"Yay!! So glad it's helping! Loved that site! We used a modified sign for diaper which is both hands patting the top waistline of her diaper (before we started potty training). Also, when we did solids she started signing for hungry. Now every morning when I go to pick her up from her crib it's ""Mama! Foooo!"" and she signs hungry lol."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:16:19 2015 UTC,"Intentional communication!! Brilliant!! You have a really smart little guy, especially since he's signing to ask for it too.  Totally impressive."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,GrammaMo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm a proud mama, for sure!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:39:46 2015 UTC,That's so neat! Did you start by signing it to him every time you gave him milk?
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,becabecaful,2,Mon Jul 6 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"Yep! We both sign it to him when asking him if he's hungry, and then I sign while he's eating so he understands what I'm talking about. This site http://www.babysignlanguage.com/dictionary/first-signs/ is pretty great. We started really doing it a few weeks ago, more to get ourselves in the habit than anything else. He's signing back way sooner than I expected, but it actually makes a lot of sense - he's way more verbal than physical, and has been since birth!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"It's something I'd like to do too, I think. Is this website in ASL? I know it differs slightly to the sign language we use in New Zealand, but it may be irrelevant which one you use if it's mostly for when they're babies."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,becabecaful,2,Mon Jul 6 20:59:19 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not sure. There's also ""baby sign"" which is different too. I've heard that baby signs can be easier for babies to master than ASL, and unless there's a reason to teach them ASL (or another sign language), then it shouldn't matter, as long as you all know what you're talking about!  One thing is that I know some daycare providers will sign with kiddos, so that might be a good reason to use baby signs, as I'm assuming that's the most popular option."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"Awe yay!! Congrats on the accomplishment! And yea, my BF's 2 year old son used every nap delaying technique in the book when he was little. Edit: still little and still delays away haha"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,8,Mon Jul 6 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"Anatomy scan is tomorrow morning - can't believe I'm almost halfway there!  Survived weekend with the in-laws, most of it was fantastic but there were a few moments that I could have done without.  I just wish my SiL would respect my opinions regarding child birth and what comes next.  It's fantastic that they did certain things and that it worked for them, but that's not us and that's also okay!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,jaina_jade,3,Mon Jul 6 14:14:01 2015 UTC,"OMG, so many people seem to assume that if you choose to do something differently from how they did, you think their choice was wrong. Dude, that's not how it works!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 6 19:48:35 2015 UTC,Exactly!!! It's not an attack on what you did it's just doing what's best for me.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,jaina_jade,8,Mon Jul 6 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"I'm down to double digits! 98 days left until 40 weeks pregnant! I'm 26 weeks pregnant today. So close to the third trimester! We're picking up a carseat/stroller/base combo today. Still gotta clean out our soon to be baby room. We have a disassembled crib in our living room and we're picking up tons of baby stuff next weekend from family. Still so much to do before our little girl gets here! But I still feel like we have so so much time, but I know it will just fly by and she will be here before I know it. Gah! I'm so ready and yet so not ready at the same time!  I gotta write a paper today for my class and I'm putting that off because I really just don't want to. No work today but a long day tomorrow. Every single one of my weekends is now booked up until the end of August, I usually love this time of year because I always have something to do, but because I'm going to be pretty darn pregnant and still nauseous and throwing up, I'm worried about the next couple of months."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,futurecompanion11,2,Mon Jul 6 14:36:30 2015 UTC,OMG  - is that all the times that's left?!  I'm due 10/13 and no clue...  Wow!  Thanks for the number :)  And now I shall begin to freak out.  Sorry you're still sick... that's not fun at all.  Hang in there mama!

I'm just a week behind you, double digits is awesome! :D   I still feel like we have so so much time, but I know it will just fly by and she will be here before I know it.   Yes. I keep alternating between ""how am I only halfway through this pregnancy?"" and ""red alert! So much to do!"". :D   I usually love this time of year because I always have something to do, but because I'm going to be pretty darn pregnant and still nauseous and throwing up, I'm worried about the next couple of months.   Oh, yuck. : ( Hopefully the nausea will let up a little!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,MrsDragon,7,Mon Jul 6 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"No more cervix checks, no more office visits.  Locked in a battle of wills with these little minions.  I feel I'll go all the way to the 16th (39+1)...given she's literally poking her head outside and upwards of my ribs right now (as opposed to, you know, dropping lower where they belong), I feel they're in there for the long haul.  I turned in our notice to vacate to our leasing office this morning.  So excited to be done with these people! C'mon August 1st!!  Also, I have chocolate ice cream at home.  I am excited about this, because I never let myself buy ice cream.  Pack one box, have some ice cream...repeat until house is packed!"

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,Hopecat,5,Mon Jul 6 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks, I have my moments of despair, but I'm definitely lucky that they're sitting so high.  Sitting and laying down hurt my chest and ribs (no more sleeping for me!), but I'm having no lower body issues (hips/back/etc).  So I can actually get things done and move around, which has been great for me mentally.  I realized I can now start saying ""next week"" when people ask!  It's not just a date, it's a ""next week""!"

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,cakegroove,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"Only because if I buy it, then I eat it.  All of it.  All at once.  Sometimes it's just easier to hold off"

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,curiouslywanting,7,Mon Jul 6 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"Today is husband's first day back at work, so I'm on my own!  Well, my mom is coming over this afternoon for lunch, and hopefully to watch baby while I shower.    I'm a little frustrated because it's supposed to be really hot and humid this week (mid 80's and very humid) so that limits my time outdoors with the baby.  I'm starting to feel a little bit of cabin fever, hopefully I'll be able to get out this evening when it cools down."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,SJP8,2,Mon Jul 6 14:09:03 2015 UTC,"This is my constant frustration: the heat. It's too hot to take LL out midday and even if I wanted to I can't put sunscreen on her yet. So I'm stuck in the house or going to the mall and walking laps. I am so freaking sick of malls, I hated them before I got pregnant and I hate them now. So what am I supposed to do? Just stay at home all day long? UGHH."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,razzertto,2,Mon Jul 6 14:33:56 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that if I walk for more than 10 minutes, my bottom feels like its on fire.  I'm trying to increase the amount of movement/walking day by day, but it is still hard at 2 weeks pp.   I'm watching a lot of Jacques Pepin cooking shows the past couple days.  His knife skills are off the hook.   Right now, I'd kill for a walk in the mall...even if it is boring and full of recycled air."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,SJP8,2,Mon Jul 6 15:42:23 2015 UTC,Oh god this is me too! I'm so sick of the heat and being stuck inside.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,Hopecat,2,Mon Jul 6 15:49:22 2015 UTC,Oh gosh the first day alone can feel really hard. Hang in there momma!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,Hopecat,6,Mon Jul 6 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"My boy might finally be napping! He does not nap. If he falls asleep anywhere but on one of us, he wakes up about 15 minutes later screaming. But I found a used swing on Craigslist yesterday and he's in it right now. So far so good. Fingers crossed because I need a nap too. Last night was a nightmare. We lost power at about midnight, so I grabbed a flashlight and walked out to the living room to talk to my husband. I am terrified of the dark, by the way. I get out to the hallway and kitty is staring at something up on the wall...that's never good. I shine the light to find the biggest cockroach I have ever seen. I made my husband kill it but I didn't sleep all night, fearing that there were more just waiting to crawl all over me."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,RositaYouBitch,3,Mon Jul 6 14:46:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Florida, where our cockroaches are about the size of rats and they FLY!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,razzertto,3,Mon Jul 6 15:46:07 2015 UTC,"And where the locals try to pretty things up by calling those flying cockroaches ""Palmetto bugs."""
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,Iamagnu,2,Mon Jul 6 15:57:14 2015 UTC,Yeah...I am so stressed out by this. I'm already a clean freak but I think it's going to become obsessive. That thing made my skin crawl
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,RositaYouBitch,3,Mon Jul 6 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"My favorite part of not living in Florida anymore is almost no bugs (and no roaches). Just so you know, what you saw was probably a palmetto bug and no amount of cleaning will keep them out, your best bet is to spray, good luck! They are so icky. I spent many nights of my childhood holding vigil after seeing a bug on my ceiling (shiver)."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,mrswhiskerson,3,Mon Jul 6 15:59:25 2015 UTC,Palmetto bugs are crafted by the devil himself. We get them when it's really wet (like it has been) and they totally freak me out. I scared S because I screamed in the bathroom when one popped out of nowhere. Mr came running cause we were both shrieking lol.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,kat_loves_tea,2,Mon Jul 6 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I've never really encountered them before and last night was a bad night to get blindsided with that, between me being emotional about other stuff and the power outage. I just keep picturing the worst case scenarios - waking up with one crawling on me or finding one in the baby's crib. I'm anxious about it getting dark tonight. :/"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,RositaYouBitch,2,Mon Jul 6 23:11:21 2015 UTC,Might be worth spraying for them. It could give you peace of mind!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,kat_loves_tea,3,Mon Jul 6 23:25:31 2015 UTC,"This is really really not a thing you can 'clean' out of your house, it has nothing to do with how clean you are. You have to spray the outside to form a protective barrier. Also, make peace with the lizards, they eat the bugs. Let your kitty go after them too."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,razzertto,2,Mon Jul 6 17:37:21 2015 UTC,"Yay for napping!  Baby girl (I really need a reddit nickname for her) hates her swing 50% of the time.  I hope she will enjoy it when she's a bit bigger.  My cat does that too...we didn't have bugs in our old apartment, but now that we are lower to the ground, we get the occasional beetle and she hunts them down in a heartbeat."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,SJP8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"So my baby hated the swing from about 1 month to 2.5 months. Now she'll tolerate a nap in the swing first thing in the am. Not after that though, not once."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,razzertto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:55:27 2015 UTC,M hated the swing until she was a little over a month old and now she loves it! It's pretty much the only place I can put her down now without her complaining. Hope your baby girl likes it soon too!

I'm rounding 13 weeks with the little wiggle worms, so I guess it's to be expected. My husband rounded the corner this morning with a big smile on his face with his hand covering his smile and said ""when did THAT happen?"" Uhh...last night I guess?!  EDIT: why did I use the words rounding and rounded both in this post? weird."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,cakegroove,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:18:51 2015 UTC,Do you happen to have tilted uterus?  That happened to me kinda overnight at 16 weeks. He popped out from the back of my abdomen.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,vibeee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:57:09 2015 UTC,I'm not sure? I don't think I've been told that ...
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,cakegroove,4,Mon Jul 6 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"Guys, M is going to be two months old tomorrow!! How did that happen?? She has her two month appointment tomorrow and I'm nervous about her shots. I think I'll see if it's possible for me to nurse her while it happens since that's supposed to help babies deal with pain. Any advice or reassurance is appreciated :)  Other than worrying about shots my day is awesome! I woke up and fed and changed M and left her in bed to snooze with my husband while I did a bunch of chores. Feels good to be productive. I'm definitely a morning person and if I don't start getting stuff done in the morning then the whole day is usually a write off.   In laws are coming for a visit later today and want to bring takeout- any suggestions? I can't figure out what I want."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,GrammaMo,3,Mon Jul 6 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"My advice on the nursing is wait until after the shot. I tried nursing during the shots once and then next feed she became skeptical of my boob meaning incoming pain. After is always a sure shot though. They have two nurses double team her with shots in both legs to get it over quickly (which you can always ask for, they're happy to keep baby tears at a minimum) and then I scoop her up and nurse. It comforts her pretty quickly and we snuggle while I hum to her. The ride home is a toss up so I'd usually bring her a fun toy to distract her. Good luck, mama. Be brave!"

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,jaina_jade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:54:41 2015 UTC,We just did Pond's shots on Friday. It was unpleasant but the doctor was super fast about it. There was about a 5 second delay and then he screamed. But the last vaccination was an oral medication that must be sweet so that calmed him a little and then as soon as I picked him up he settled down pretty quick. If you want to nurse I'd wait until it's done. That's what we did after Pond had his tongue clipped and it definitely helped him feel better. Good luck. It's no fun but it's quick.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,RositaYouBitch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:33:56 2015 UTC,I agree with nursing after the shot.  Ask for a real bandage - my pediatrician would use the spot bandaids that don't stick and leave traces of blood on me and the baby clothes.    How your baby deals with the shot(s) will depend on their personality.  My older son when he got shots as a baby would only cry for maybe 15 seconds.  Easy.  My 1 month old newborn got a second Hep B shot last week and was crying bloody murder off and on for 15 minutes.  He wouldn't let go of the pain and shock.  So hang in there if you have a screamer like I do.  I'm hoping that your baby is like my oldest.  The best thing that you can do is hold and soothe your little one through their reaction.    For food - how about rotisserie chicken with sides?
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,curiouslywanting,4,Mon Jul 6 18:58:33 2015 UTC,Uh oh. Too many of the e-books y'all recommended to me a few weeks ago have become available all at the same time. Better get to reading...

I will be 6+3  My symptoms disappeared the middle of last week, but then over the weekend, every time I would stand up I would get ill. I can't eat anything other than popsicles. So that made me feel better, but today those symptoms are starting to fade away too.   I am just having so much anxiety. I'm scared they won't see a fetal pole, just an empty sac, or no heartbeat. Man, tomorrow CANNOT come fast enough.   I'm just trying to find reassuring things online."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,dizzyvonblue,5,Mon Jul 6 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the Morning Sickness roller coaster. You hate it when you have it and you want it back when you don't. So annoying. Mine would stick around for about 4-5 days and then I'd have 2-3 days nausea free. The anxiety comes as part of the IF pregnancy welcome kit. And honestly, if I REALLY couldn't stand the anxiety, I just would call my OB and request an ultrasound. They've never turned me away once I explained my medical history.   I know it's nerve wracking, I'd avoid Dr. Google. He should be sued for malpractice because most of the time he's wrong. hugs"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,2,Mon Jul 6 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't graduated to an OB, we are still seeing our RE, and she's over 2 hours each way. Husband and I discussed elective ultrasounds today, and decided that if needed I could go pay to have one every other week for the remainder of this first trimester.  My sickness lasted all of Saturday and Sunday. I just have some food aversion and my stomach feels light today. I don't like being sick, but I agree ithat provides some anxiety relief."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,dizzyvonblue,2,Mon Jul 6 22:55:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, it really comes and goes. And it's completely normal to have days where you're sick but not as sick as usual. I had ultrasounds with my RE every 1-2 weeks. It brought so much peace of mind, I could always remind myself I just had to get through __ more days before I could check in again. I worked so hard to not get attached, I can't say if that helped anything in the long run but I don't think it hurt anything (I'm 20 weeks now and still haven't announced... so perhaps not). The whole phrase ""right now you're pregnant"" never really worked for me. I did a lot better with just telling myself I needed to just get through that day and then I would be 1 day closer to my next appointment.  It's hard, but time will pass. However it'll never pass fast enough. That's why we're here though! I love this group."

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,3,Tue Jul 7 04:22:36 2015 UTC,"Baby stuff... do you guys Craigslist?  I'm trying to save money and I've been looking on Craigslist and I'm trying to get the best deal for decent quality stuff. How would you gauge a good deal? 50% of the listed price for new? 40%? For instance, I found a jumparoo on Craigslist that goes for $77 new on Target's website. I offered $30 but the owners want $40 for it. I'm not sure if that's a decent price...  What are your guy's thoughts?  Used boppy pillow: $10, $5 for an additional slip cover  Bumbo with tray: $10  Wipe Warmer (I'm thinking for night time changes): $5  Avent Bottle Warmer: $10  Avent Bottle Sanitizer: $10.  I just hate the idea of spending a bunch of money to find later that I could've gotten for cheaper. I'm hoping some of you ladies have had experience with this?"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,6,Mon Jul 6 18:23:02 2015 UTC,"I am 100% a bargain shopper. One thing I do for Craigslist, is most of the time their location will be on a map, not their exact location, but the neighborhood. I will look at the quality of the neighborhood. I am not going into the slums to buy a used boppy pillow. I also look at the photos, if people have dirty ass floors, I won't buy from them either.  For pricing you need to use Ebay. Click on ""Advanced Search"", type in the item you are looking for, click ""completed listings"" and it will tell you what items actually sold for. I use that to make offers on CL."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,dizzyvonblue,2,Mon Jul 6 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"I like this a lot, thank you for the level of detail! Using this strategy for sure!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,4,Mon Jul 6 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"I love Craigslist!   I've gotten great baby bargains from there.  I don't have a hard and fast rule, but I like anything that is at least 50% or more off of the original price, but it depends on the condition.  I got a new uppababy g-luxe umbrella stroller for 70% of the original price which I thought was a great score.   For the jumperoo, I would agree - you should get it for $30-35. The other prices that you list are totally reasonable.  I've seen those prices on mom/parent bulletin boards locally."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,curiouslywanting,3,Mon Jul 6 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"I would also add that you have time. You can watch the sites to see what similar items go for (I think you can set up alerts for craigslist search terms?). You can also bump your price over time. So say right now you only want to pay $30 for a jumparoo and no one is offering them at that price. Wait and if by September or so you still haven't found one, then consider going to $40.  My max prices depend on condition, how long I've been looking for that item, if it's the color/pattern whatever that I prefer (if I care), etc.  Also, once I've bought an item I stop looking for it. It does me no good to find out that next week I would have gotten it $10 cheaper. If I'm happy with the price I paid? Then it's a done deal and I'm onto the next thing. If I can't square with paying that much? Then I don't.  Also, if you will be having a baby shower, keep in mind that you can always register for things as well. :)"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jul 6 19:30:47 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with the you have time idea.  I treat Craigslist like eBay.  Watch what prices things list for first.  Then you get a sense of what people are selling items and know when you see a bargain.    Yes, stop searching once you bought your item!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,curiouslywanting,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"haha, yea I backed out of the deal. Like you said I have plenty of time. I'd prefer to watch and wait and balance just how much I'm willing to pay.  I'll have a baby shower most likely but probably about 5 people will show. I'm not one to have a lot of friends so not really banking on any of that. Plus my MIL keeps buying clothes (even though we've told her over and over that we're good on clothes) so not expecting anything from her either.  Thank you Mrs. Dragon!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,3,Mon Jul 6 22:34:46 2015 UTC,"I bought almost all my baby stuff used. Generally I like to pay a third of retail price, but if it's something I really like then I'll pay up to 50%. Check out local Facebook groups too, I got most of my stuff from a baby/children's items sale group. I like how you see their fb profile too so it's less of a faceless stranger than Craigslist is."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,GrammaMo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:35:34 2015 UTC,Good to know! Thanks G'mo :)
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,gizmo_love,3,Mon Jul 6 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"I'll second the idea of a FB group for baby items. I've gotten most of our stuff from there and in turn sold it after we were done on the same group months later and even for the same price (swing, jumperoo, Moby wrap, etc). It's so easy, and you have a name and a face for who you're meeting to deal with. It's easy to peruse during a few minutes here and there and I've gotten some STELLAR deals on there. Sometimes I buy from the same people over and over because they have a daughter just a bit older than mine so if they have really good stuff, they know me and will message me before posting. It's worked out lovely. For instance, I got all her 18 months pajamas in one go from one lady. They're in great condition and clean and I'll probably sell them all in a bundle when I'm done."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,kat_loves_tea,3,Tue Jul 7 02:41:21 2015 UTC,"I bought stuff from craigslist!    I can tell you that you wont need a wipes warmer though (they dry them out, and some are unsafe), we're doing just fine without one."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,SJP8,3,Mon Jul 6 19:34:47 2015 UTC,"Used boppy - sounds fair. Buy the water resistant cover on Amazon.   I'm anti Bumbo. We skipped the wipes warmer - he's fine with cold and we have not needed to do too many night changes after about 2 months old. We don't use a bottle warmer - for formula feeding, we bought the doc brown pitcher, make it double-strength, and mix it with hot water immediately before serving. And our sterilizer is called a pot of boiling water. So I am not a helper for the rest. :("

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,ThatGreenSolGirl,2,Mon Jul 6 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, totally. I have more success with craigslist than I do the facebook garage sale groups. Speaking of which, garage sales in nice neighborhoods are awesome for baby items. I got my son a baby einstein jumper for 20 bucks with the box off craigslist. They're like 90 from Target. Most of the people are no different than you and just want to get rid of the stuff they aren't using anymore. I tried selling a few baby items on the facebook groups and it was a total nightmare with people setting meet up times then just never showing up. Haven't had that issue with craigslist. I do keep a flip up knife in my diaper bag just in case though ;)"

He got his first bottle feed today and did a good job with the whole suck-swallow-breathe thing. He had 15/28ml from the bottle before he got too tired to continue & he didn't have any major desats or any apnea/bradycardia episodes during the feed. Though, watching the nurse feed him & put him up to her shoulder to burp brought up a lot of feelings about all I've missed out on with my boys. Especially since I was already struggling with disappointment over not being able to nuzzle today like I was told I would.   When it was Sebastian's turn to try the bottle  we had a setback. He was tachypnic and not tolerating the attempt to bottle feed well, so the nurse stopped. He continued breathing fast after getting settled back into the isolette so he got a high flow nasal cannula. He seemed to be doing ok but I got a call from the nurse about an hour ago letting me know that he continued with the tachypnea so he's back on bubble c-pap.   I'm terrified he's getting sick again. I just want my boys to be happy and healthy & it kills me to think Sebastian might not be feeling good and I don't get to be the one to comfort him.  We're going back for kangaroo care tonight & I hope that'll settle the both of us."

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 6 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"Daycare parents - what do you use for a baby bag? I don't mean diaper bag, but the bag you bring spare clothes, bottles, (cloth) diapers, etc to daycare, drop off, and pick up.   Currently we are using a cloth shopping bag. We put in a box that holds six cloth diapers, two wet bags, a cooler that holds three 5oz bottles of breast milk, and sometimes plastic bags with his powdered formula, bottles for formula, spare clothes, pacifier, etc. we have a tendency to forget stuff so I was thinking something with pockets (to store stuff in) and a big middle (for them to chuck stuff into) would work. Thoughts?"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,Hopecat,3,Mon Jul 6 12:53:45 2015 UTC,"Since the bags with tons of pockets tend to get pricey, would using something like a purse organizer go well inside the cloth shopping bag? I'm referring to something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Periea-JNB18RE/dp/B00LM8WI4A/  The other idea I have is to get a checklist laminated and hang it on the bag like a tag - that way, when you empty the bag after coming home, use a dry erase marker to check off what's already in the bag and you can see at a glance in the morning what you need to add before heading out the door. (Or if you set the bag down in a place where you can put a cheap whiteboard, that would work too.)"

InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,septicidal,3,Mon Jul 6 16:06:43 2015 UTC,I hope that your tiny human gave you time for a good nap.  Sounds like you needed it.  Hope that your nipple and your hand are feeling better.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,jaina_jade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Hope you are surviving babyhood. Are you already back at work?  I am... About the same.  Which is to say not great.  Especially since I forgot to put my Reglan in my bag today. Whoops. Getting to my therapy appointment after work may be an adventure in trying not to puke all over Cambridge.  I'm hoping that since my blood glucose levels have all been pretty normal/stable, I won't have to keep checking blood sugar four times a day.  I'm really sick of it, especially since the latest batch of super-expensive test strips had several defective test strips in the batch (wasting a good $5+ of my dollars)."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 6 13:02:02 2015 UTC,I left my diclegis at home one day last week and it was horrible - had to keep talking myself down before giving up once I got in my driveway.  Thankfully we got a good rain storm that night so no evidence by the next morning!
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,jaina_jade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"Ack, that sounds awful!  I am lucky in that despite the violent nausea, I don't actively puke that much, but attempting to eat normal-ish meals is next to impossible.  I've been having trouble consuming over 1200 calories a day if I'm not well medicated.  The reglan definitely helps a lot, even though it makes me dizzy.  I think at this point I almost match my pre-pregnancy weight.  I had someone comment on how my face looked thinner and I must be losing weight... Not really ideal right now.  But at least I was overweight pre-pregnancy so my OB isn't concerned about my lack of weight gain at this stage."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,traveler5678,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"I've got the puke and rally down - need just a few moments to clean up and I'm good to go again.  I'm still below my pre-pregnancy weight but I was a good 10lbs heavier than normal thanks to an extra long suppression cycle so my doctor isn't concerned.  However I'm having issues with insurance saying that I need to see a nutritionist or some b.s. unless I show ""marked improvement"".  I'm hitting all my calories but on average vomit about 50% of that so it's hard to put anything on - but I finally have a bump so I'm happy!"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:11:01 2015 UTC,Did you complain to the company about the test strips?  Those strips are expensive.
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,0,Mon Jul 6 13:12:42 2015 UTC,"The glucose monitor user's manual says the test code that is showing is from ""applying the blood sample too early, before the meter is ready"" although that's bollocks.  I always wait for it to be flashing the sign to apply the blood sample before doing so.  There is a customer service number I can call so I might try to do that, I just hate sitting on hold with customer service, especially during work hours when I have things to get done around the office."
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely call. My office has a closed door, so if I have to be on hold I shut the door, put the phone on speaker and work until someone picks up - is that an option?"
InfertilityBabies,3cap1u,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I work in an open office with lots of foot traffic from students/etc.  My boss is out this week so I could technically use her office but then I can't be at my computer dealing with other things while on hold."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,dutchqueen,7,Mon Jul 6 01:37:33 2015 UTC,"The latest I've heard is that there is done research showing that babies might trigger labor by releasing hormones, possibly to do with the readiness of their lungs (ie lungs are ready, baby releases hormones, labor is go!). But as /u/lancealittle said, they're really in the dark about what causes labor. So.... Yeah."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,pamplemousse2,6,Mon Jul 6 02:27:38 2015 UTC,"In the end, no one really knows what triggers labor, so of course plenty of women with transverse babies go into labor, while plenty of women with perfectly vertex babies don't. Could the cervical pressure be helpful? Probably. I don't think that the two nurses are necessarily being inconsistent; fetal positioning is only one of many, many factors in the whole shebang. There are definitely some fetal and maternal hormones at work, and obviously physics matters."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,lancealittle,2,Mon Jul 6 01:55:46 2015 UTC,I think they can still trigger labor but are less likely to cause preterm labor.
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,rbrvwv,2,Mon Jul 6 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"FWIW (and this is anecdata), I had tons and tons of cervical pressure and pain, my little one was right on my cervix pressing it and had been for months. Know what? It never triggered labor for me at all. It did nothing. I had to be induced at 41+1. I think they don't really know what triggers labor at all."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,razzertto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:11:02 2015 UTC,"This makes me feel so much better. I'm on bed rest for a shortened cervix (which bed rest is helping, yay!) and one of the boys insists on sitting right on my cervix. In fact, he spent a good 10 minutes this morning thumping on it. I was kinda freaking out, not wanting him to get this party started. So I feel better knowing that babies can do that and it can still be okay."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jul 6 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"Once labor begins, pressure on the cervix intensifies it... But cervical pressure alone doesn't seem to trigger labor. It's really a medical mystery at this point. There are theories floating around about hormones from the baby signaling lung readiness and all that, but nothing has been proven yet."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:27:14 2015 UTC,"I would not think that it matters, but to be honest I'm curious too..I have no idea what triggers labor."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,female_engineer_here,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"That's a really interesting question.  I don't have a direct answer or much knowledge on the subject, but at my last appointment the NP told me that my baby's head was engaged and that the resulting pressure on the cervix should really help things to move along."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,traveler5678,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:31:57 2015 UTC,My boys made a capital T in my uterus and I was never dilated or effaced. My water broke just hours before 38 wks and my scheduled C section. Every body is different.
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,eliwhi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"She said that yes, of course they can, it's more to do with hormones than physical pressure.   That's correct. Going into labour is a hormonal process. Your baby release some kind of hormones into the amniotic fluid once it's lungs are ready to breathe air."
InfertilityBabies,3c95bc,tittypuncher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I was not at all dilated at my 38 week checkup and was holding my daughter less than 48 hours later. She wasn't transverse but I just wanted to throw out there that not everybody is out there waddling around with their cervix slowly widening!"
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,probablyanalienbaby,4,Mon Jul 6 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"Although our children ultimately did come from my husband's sperm, we went through the process of accepting that we'd need to use donor sperm and choosing a donor. We went with California Cryobank, partially on the recommendation of trusted people at our clinic and partially on my own research.   At first Mr. V took the stance that he'd rather adopt than use donor sperm because it would be unbalanced to have our children genetically connected to only one of us, but he came around.   Definitely do the couples therapy. It made a huge difference for us."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,rbrvwv,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Can I ask: were you ultimately able to conceive naturally or through IUI or IVF?  We've had pretty extensive conversations about my desire to have a biological connection to a family member. My husband is also very excited for me to be pregnant because pregnancy can help to lessen the severity of rheumatoid arthritis, which may help me to avoid joint replacements in the future. That's a win for everybody.   I'm not really sure how to look for a therapist who specializes in infertility. We aren't seeing an RE yet or I'd ask there."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,rbrvwv,3,Mon Jul 6 14:45:13 2015 UTC,"Even if you're not with a clinic, I bet you could call fertility clinics and ask for recommendations. My clinic offers therapy but none of the therapists took our insurance. They were able to recommend a wonderful therapist who does take our insurance, though.   We needed IVF to conceive. It took us three rounds. My husband has severe oligospermia (single digit counts), so for the first round we tried micro TESE surgery, which didn't work at all. From there we went with the very few sperm they could find in his samples. For our third round he had 300,000 sperm, which was unprecedented for him, and we got two blasts to transfer resulting in twins.   If you go the IVF route, I can't recommend Shared Risk strongly enough. That wonderful program is why we have the children we do."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,rbrvwv,3,Mon Jul 6 15:15:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Our clinic doesn't offer shared risk. The nearest one that does is 8 hours away. We will discuss it more, I'm sure, but we would be looking at $30K for the first round with the shared risk, not including travel costs. So even if we got to take a baby home...we would then have a baby and a $30K loan to pay off. I'm a teacher and my husband makes $12 an hour. We'd be pretty screwed.   I'm so glad that IVF worked out for you. I'm hoping we can find a way to make something work for us. I just booked his urologist appointment for Friday. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a ""duh"" solution (like, ""did you try turning your testicles off and then turning them on again?"") but I know it's not likely. Either way we will have more information-and information is power."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,rbrvwv,3,Mon Jul 6 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"If you can find that testicle switch, let me know! I hope you find a magic answer :-)"
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"It's got to be there somewhere, right?"
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 6 16:06:44 2015 UTC,Exactly!
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry to hear IVF is so much in your area. The financial side of infertility treatments always makes me angry. I understand that the business side of it, and I don't blame the doctors, but it just feels patently unfair for cost alone to put options out of reach of people who want and need them. And having the costs vary wildly based on location and the vagaries of insurance just makes it even worse. I just...ugh.  Here's hoping the urologist turns up some useful information and you all have a clear path ahead."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you. The costs of both IVF and adoption are likely out of reach for us. If we can't reach natural conception or IUI numbers I will talk to my husband about using donor sperm. I know he'd have a hard time with it but really, genetically speaking it wouldn't be that different from adoption. Since I was adopted, the child wouldn't be genetically related to anyone on my side of the family, either. It would be like an inexpensive adoption with the bonus that I would get to carry the child, so we would get to experience the pregnancy and birth together. I think we both agree that's more important than genetics-and if we're honest, other than looks my husband's side of the family didn't win the genetic lottery. Lots of illness there. My family is just as bad-but I'm not actually related. I just really hope that if it comes to it, my husband won't feel that he'll be less of a parent for not providing the genetic material. We will be looking for counseling, for sure."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,dutchqueen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, but it's worth mentioning that once you get pregnant there's virtually nothing insurance won't cover. I could terminate as many pregnancies as I want free of charge-I just can't get any help getting pregnant. Assholes."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jul 6 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"So, there is a therapist associated with my clinic - check the web pages of some clinics near you. You don't need to be a patient to see her.  I also googled ""infertility therapist [my town]"" and found a good database here: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php. This is where we ultimately found our (awesome) therapist. Something to note is that I found a LOT of people listed ""infertility"" as one of the kinds of counselling that they do, but in their description of their services, they didn't even mention it. Like, what - you had a patient once who was infertile, and now you're an expert? So I decided that they had to specifically mention infertility in their description of their services, as a main area of expertise. I think that narrowed it down to about 6. Then husband and I chose a few to email, and ours was the clear best fit.  Be prepared to visit more than one person if you don't click immediately, but hopefully that gives you a couple places to start."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,springbound,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:52:25 2015 UTC,Thanks. We only have one RE in our area (large city in a large state-you'd think we would have more options) and their website is woefully uninformative. I'll try google again and make some calls.
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:55:45 2015 UTC,Good luck!
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,motherofdragoons,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:34:54 2015 UTC,Can't speak to the sperm issue - we have MFI but not zero sperm - but I definitely recommend a therapist!  Couples counseling and maybe individual sessions.
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,motherofdragoons,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:47:10 2015 UTC,"Also don't have much to contribute as for as donor sperm, but I second this.  Especially the individual sessions.  The couples meetings are great, don't get me wrong, but sometimes, there are just things you can't say in front of our partner, no matter how close you are, until you can figure out what you really mean/want.  I know, dealing with MFI, that I had trouble even talking about it around him, because it was so sensitive.  So we'd end up...just not talking about anything.  But going alone, I could sort of unload while trying to work my way through my own feelings before talking to him.  Good stuff.  Would do again (the therapy.....not the infertility crap)."
InfertilityBabies,3c9puv,bellebridge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"YES. And I had so much anger about the fact that it was MFI, but I was the one going through all the treatments... The therapy has been key!"
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,healthylurker,5,Sun Jul 5 20:51:23 2015 UTC,Call your OB!! Hugs!!
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,larabair,5,Sun Jul 5 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"Call your OB (they'll probably tell you to go to the hospital).  I don't know if this is reassuring at all or not, but sometimes bloody mucus can look like tissue once it's in the toilet (I know bc I had a lot of it after my cerclage). So hopefully something just irritated your cervix a bit & what you saw is just a result of that.   Also, if you're not having cramping & heavy bleeding that's a good sign too! But definitely call your doctor!   Hoping all is well. Hugs."
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,spankyjubblies,7,Sun Jul 5 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds like pieces of your mucus plug???  I doubt it's a MC.    But yeah, call your OB."
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,vibeee,3,Sun Jul 5 21:40:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't hesitate to call the OB on call
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,cakegroove,3,Sun Jul 5 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"If you don't hear back from your OB (I'd all them again!), go to L&D not the ER. ER will probably send you to l&d anyway because of how far along you are but it will take longer. Much better use of your time and more specific care if you just go straight to the source. Good luck and I hope it's nothing!"
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,mrswhiskerson,2,Mon Jul 6 00:30:29 2015 UTC,Would it be worth it to go to ER?
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,SJP8,4,Sun Jul 5 21:07:10 2015 UTC,I would call your OB.  Hope everything is OK.
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 5 21:28:10 2015 UTC,"Hopefully mucus. I echo the ""call your doc"" chorus though. Lots of hugs!"
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,Iamagnu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:43:38 2015 UTC,Sending you hopeful thoughts! I hope this is a whole bunch of nothing.
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,NBPTS,6,Mon Jul 6 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you everyone. An OB finally got back to me and after going through my list of symptoms (which basically was nothing besides the actual tissue), he didnt think it was an emergency. He said if it were a miscarriage, typically there would be a lot of cramping, bleeding and both would get worse over time. But honestly, he had no idea what it could be. It's been 8 hours and I ihave yet to see any more tissue, still no blood, I am slightly crampy (but what else is new).   I'm going to call my OB's office bright and early tom... I'm hoping they will let us have an ultrasound? So upset and worried. Will def get no sleep tonight. I just know tissue is never a good sign :( I feel like everything I'm reading say if its light pink tissue, its over."
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jul 6 02:26:25 2015 UTC,I came back looking for an update. I'm thinking about you! Here's to getting some sleep tonight and some answers tomorrow!

InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:24:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you ladies. You all have been so good... I appreciate it.  Update: I called the nurse at my practice this am and she didnt seem hugely concerned when I explained. She wanted to just monitor me and keep an eye on things since I haven't had anything happen since.. but that made me so upset (cue fighting back tears). I begged to be able to go in and at least hear the heart beat (my husband thinks its silly because he said that doesnt show the whole picture of whats going on), but hey, its something. If it were a miscarriage, the baby would have technically passed already, right? She's checking with the doctor and is going to call me back. No one in the medical field (OB on call and now the nurse) seems concerned over this.. what the heck."
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,cakegroove,2,Mon Jul 6 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"When this all passes over, and I'm not a professional so I don't have anything on that end to add to this, but I think you're ready for the doppler purchase.  17 weeks your little one is big enough to pick up the sound.  It gives me SO MUCH sense of mind when I have my freak out days.  Hang in there... it's a good sign that everyone is so unconcerned but you're doing the right thing to push.  You know your body more then anyone."
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,cakegroove,2,Mon Jul 6 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"Hey so I'm just seeing this now, so it seems like you've already been through most of it.  But I too passed tissue at different stages. Or it looked like tissue, but strangely enough when I talked to my fertility doc he said that sometimes clots can look like tiissue if you're not used to it (be more pink or not). I'm not sure I totally buy it BUT I just wanted to let you know its happened to me and it turned out to be NOTHING. It sound slike in your case too, its not anything that you need to worry about but that fear just grips you doesn't it??  I do recommend getting a home doppler. For me, its really been calming tobe able to check the heartbeat briefly when I get up or if something like this happened.  Hang in there! Pregnancyis STRESSFUl!"
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:35:37 2015 UTC,I have been thinking about you! Could not wait to get in to work this morning to see an update. Hope you can get in for an ultrasound today
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,TigFan15,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:28:04 2015 UTC,Thank you <3. It doesn't even sound like they want to do an ultrasound... ugh. Nurse hasnt called back yet for final verdict. I figure checking for heartbeat (and maybe an exam) would at least calm my fears a little bit. I'll take ANYTHING!
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,spankyjubblies,2,Mon Jul 6 12:40:12 2015 UTC,"You'd think they'd understand how scared you are, and bring you in for that reason alone.  Ugh! Not like you're asking for a freebie..."

Im contemplating going to ER but what would they do for me there?? At least check for heart beat? Still no bleeding or no more tissue. Just light cramping but I get that a lot anyway. Praying its nothing.
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,Ishslittleone,5,Sun Jul 5 23:21:14 2015 UTC,Call back!
InfertilityBabies,3c89kp,Ishslittleone,2,Sun Jul 5 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"Call again!  Or you might try calling L&D at your hospital and asking them for assistance. Unless your ob has office hours on Sunday I assume they would send you to L&D for anything serious anyway. If you can't talk to your ob, see if the nurses/on call at the hospital think you should come in."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,GrammaMo,15,Sun Jul 5 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"Guys, the boys are doing so great. I love them so much I feel like my heart is bursting.  They are both officially off c-pap today. Asher has a high flow nasal cannula to help him remember to breath, but it's just room air (no extra oxygen). The cannula is much less cumbersome than the c-pap was! Sebastian is doing great on his own (no cannula). It was amazing to hold them without worrying about the c-pap. We could actually see their faces and they didn't have to wear hats so I kissed their little heads as much as I could.   They both have a headful of black hair like me (I hope it says that way) and their eyes are getting lighter and lighter like husband (hope it stays that way). On the 3rd they were 3lbs and today they're 3lbs 3oz.   They're just so perfect and I'm in love."

InfertilityBabies,3c7181,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:30:30 2015 UTC,So exciting! Looking forward to the update. : )
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,lancealittle,5,Mon Jul 6 04:25:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, BTW -- we DID make it to a cat cafe in Montreal! It was so sweet; I was kind of expecting all the cats to be hiding somewhere and not up for interacting, but they were mostly splayed out on their sleeping surfaces and very friendly with anyone who wanted to give them a good ear scratch. Thanks for the suggestion!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,handywife6,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:54:05 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'm glad you enjoyed it!
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,lancealittle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:22:19 2015 UTC,This sounds so fun! I wonder if there are any other places that do something like that? Did you end up with cat hair in your food? We have a long haired cat and am always finding cat hair everywhere
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 5 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"There was no hair anywhere, but there was an employee cleaning all the cat trees. I'm sure my one cat at home would leave less of a hair carpet if I actually brushed him once in a while and/or cleaned some furniture."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,spankyjubblies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:14:42 2015 UTC,Awesome!!! I'm pretty jealous!
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,MrsDragon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:39:09 2015 UTC,That sounds fun! A cat cafe just opened up in DC (or is opening up soon). One of my best friends loves cats and I want to take her when she comes home to visit.

InfertilityBabies,3c7181,Iamagnu,3,Sun Jul 5 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"Baby girl went to the pediatrician and is finally surpassing her birth weight.  She is now a whopping 8 lbs 2 oz, which means that she is getting enough food! Yay!  The dr also says I dont necessarily have to wake her every 2-3 hrs at night anymore, just feed her at night when she lets us know that she's hungry.  Which means no more dealing with a super sleepy baby that refuses to eat, and I can pump at night instead."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,SJP8,2,Sun Jul 5 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, this is great! We stopped waking mini-gnu to eat at night at around 5 weeks (I can't believe we waited that long), and it has made a huge difference to my sanity! Nice job fattening up your kid!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 5 17:08:13 2015 UTC,I'm so happy about getting in some more sleep...and getting the doc's all clear to do so!  Just in time for the Mr too..he goes back to work tomorrow :/
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,SJP8,2,Sun Jul 5 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"Oh thank goodness! The not waking her up will definitely be a relief! And think about giving yourself a break on the pumping... I was told to pump every 3 hours, but could go for one 5-hour overnight period. If that results in engorgement when she tries to latch, I had good luck hand-expressing a bit to soften up the boob before kiddo latched.  But most of all - yay weight gain!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,pamplemousse2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"My best feeds are right after taking a shower, that way I can hand express without worrying about getting milk everywhere, and she eats the longest without latching issues.  I usually pump once at night to relieve engorgement if she only eats from one boob."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,Iamagnu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"OK, I get it - I guess I assumed you were still going every 3 hours (thank goodness that's not the case!)  I have to be careful after a shower to get a bra on right away, or I'll leak EVERYWHERE (I think it's the hot water) - never made the connection that that's the perfect time to feed the kiddo!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,RositaYouBitch,5,Sun Jul 5 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"Well, our first airplane trips with mini are booked. We're going to do a three-legged trip early next month--to Florida to see my parents and grandmother, then up to Pennsylvania to attend Mr. gnu's sister's baby naming. I thought we'd bring her as a lap child, but Mr. gnu insisted on buying her a seat."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,Iamagnu,2,Sun Jul 5 17:10:53 2015 UTC,Even if it ends up that you hold her in your lap it'll be nice to have that extra seat.
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,RositaYouBitch,2,Sun Jul 5 18:28:19 2015 UTC,Did you get a seat for Pond in all your travels last week?
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,septicidal,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:58:02 2015 UTC,No but I lucked out with first class seats on both of our trips so we had the extra room. I think breastfeeding was the toughest thing. It was hard to find a comfy position. Changing him wasn't easy either. There is a table in the restroom but its so small. From SF to PA we were in the front row so I actually extended my kegs and propped them against the wall and made a table. And from PA to Miami I just changed him before we took off and as soon as we landed.
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,MrsDragon,3,Sun Jul 5 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"My husband sold the poker table we've been trying to get rid of for ages! We have so much more room in our basement now.  Today we are going to a birthday celebration/housewarming at our friends' new house. And I am eating more of the strawberry rhubarb pie I made yesterday (with rhubarb from my garden). It turned out so well.  Other than that... My husband started working on some of the non-kitchen-related tasks around the house, including doing some patching and touch up paint in our bedroom. I am trying to distract myself from thinking about anatomy scan 2.0 on Wednesday... I really hope the baby is more cooperative and opens its legs for us. I know in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter if there are boy parts or girl parts, but I just want to know."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,Vexwyf,3,Sun Jul 5 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"I know in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter if there are boy parts or girl parts, but I just want to know.   I blame this on a failure of the English language. I didn't care what sex the babies were, but it's so nice to be able to say ""he"" instead of ""it"". It sounds more human, you know?"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,HerVoiceEchoes,3,Sun Jul 5 19:47:21 2015 UTC,"I can't decide if I'm milking this being pregnant thing for all the laziness I can, because the one pregnancy book I have read so far says first-trimester exhaustion is supposed to be easing up by now (12w). I slept from 10 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. this morning and even now, with plenty of stuff that needs doing, am still sitting around in my pajamas like a lazy bum. I could 100% go get back in bed and sleep another couple hours right now, no problem.  My husband is going to come in here and make his ""What's for lunch?"" face at me, so maybe I should get dressed and do something worthwhile."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,MrsDragon,8,Sun Jul 5 17:07:56 2015 UTC,My first trimester exhaustion didn't let up until well into my second trimester. I had pregnancy fatigue more or less for my entire pregnancy. So you're probably not milking it. Growing a placenta and a baby can be extremely draining.
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,PrincessCBHammock,5,Sun Jul 5 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"I spent the first trimester EXHAUSTED. I'm now on the brink of the third trimester and I've never gotten that energy ""boost"". I just got less exhausted and more generally tired. I used to be good with 8-9 hours of sleep. Now, if I get 8-9, it's hellish dragging myself out of my bed, it's more like 11 hours to make my body happy. And I'm on bed rest so it's not like I'm doing anything physically taxing!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,Iamagnu,2,Sun Jul 5 19:49:37 2015 UTC,"Pregnancy energy boost with twins is a total myth! I maybe had one week of nesting but I took so many naps all 9 months! Growing one baby is so much work, growing 2 is just hard labor."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,mrswhiskerson,3,Sun Jul 5 22:14:38 2015 UTC,I was also exhausted well into the second trimester.
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,RositaYouBitch,3,Sun Jul 5 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"My exhaustion lasted until 15-16 weeks and while I'm at a normal energy level now, it certainly isn't a super energy like I'd heard would happen in the second trimester. Rest all you need!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,pamplemousse2,3,Sun Jul 5 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"If you're tired, rest. Even if you just feel like sitting, do it. You're growing a person. That's hard work!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,vibeee,3,Sun Jul 5 18:29:39 2015 UTC,My 1st tri exhaustion also didn't let up until well into the 2nd tri.
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,PrincessCBHammock,3,Sun Jul 5 18:42:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't get that second trimester boost of energy until I was almost into the third trimester. If you're tired, you're tired and should rest. Enjoy it (and hey, milk it a little bit too- you deserve that!)"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,magooey,2,Sun Jul 5 23:31:30 2015 UTC,For me it was more about 14-16 weeks when I got my energy back.  But then a couple weeks later a hit a spot of frequent headaches and sleepiness.   The most energy I had is between now and about 20 weeks.
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,dizzyvonblue,2,Sun Jul 5 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"Your body doesn't have any sort of timer that says ""oh, 12 weeks is up, let's get back to normal"". With the twins I was exhausted the whole pregnancy, with this pregnancy - also 12 weeks - I am still exhausted and nauseated as I was a couple of weeks ago. Literally every pregnancy is different and you just have to listen to your body and do what you feel is right."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,RositaYouBitch,2,Sun Jul 5 22:13:01 2015 UTC,Vex! I missed your post the other day and this is the first I'm seeing you here. Welcome!!

InfertilityBabies,3c7181,RositaYouBitch,3,Mon Jul 6 15:24:07 2015 UTC,"I'm finally getting to unpack and set up our real nursery. I got all weepy looking at the clothes Pond can't fit into anymore, especially the outfit we brought him home from the hospital in."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,lancealittle,2,Sun Jul 5 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"Aw, congrats on getting the nursery together! Do you have any plans for those special clothes?"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,razzertto,2,Sun Jul 5 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I'm hanging onto them for now. We decided we are done with treatment but we haven't ruled out adoption and since we never had a great diagnosis, there is still a chance of another biological child."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,lancealittle,5,Sun Jul 5 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"Shoot -- I was going to say ""Soccer Sunday,"" because team USA has a rematch with Japan in the world cup today!! I realize that ""football"" is more cosmopolitan, but then one loses the alliterative properties :)  We're headed to Quaker meeting, hopefully seeing some friends who moved away and are back in town visiting, and watching some women's football/soccer this afternoon -- but we don't have a TV, so we'll probably be crowded around a laptop hoping that the online streaming doesn't go down. It should be a beautiful day, so my main goal is to simply enjoy my last day of vacation before a busy week."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,razzertto,2,Sun Jul 5 13:52:15 2015 UTC,Go Team USA!!! I watched the heartbreaker last time and I really want us to beat Japan this time!
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,lancealittle,2,Sun Jul 5 15:02:13 2015 UTC,USA!! USA!! USA!! Color me surprised when I tuned in about 9 minutes after the game started and the US was already up by 2 goals . . .

Shower, pack for our trip, clean up the house (jeez, I never realized how much of this I did before I had a baby).   My husband spilled instant coffee in the silverware drawer and didn't clean it up right away, and it sort of melted all over anything it touched. I'm so annoyed with him for not taking care of it immediately."

InfertilityBabies,3c7181,MrsDragon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:55:09 2015 UTC,I can't wait for my husband to do a brisket again - they are just so stinking expensive. We did ribs in the smoker yesterday - my husband has got it down
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,messofletters,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:46:22 2015 UTC,"I barely had a piece of the brisket because with the hot dogs, hamburgers, corn, fruit, and chips there was just too much to eat... WAY more than 8 adults and 3 kids could eat!"

InfertilityBabies,3c7181,Vexwyf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"How is it going? I'm kind of dreading it, actually."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,vibeee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"It's not so bad. I mean last week was frustrating because he would take 10 minute naps after taking so long to fall asleep. And he's snacking more than eating.  But I read about it and it turns out his brain is just getting its shit together. He took about 20 minutes to fall asleep last night, slept from 11-4:45, ate then slept from 5:30-8. So not as bad as it could be. I think just realizing he needs that help to stay asleep or get back to sleep is going to be helpful.  He was waking up around 5:30 and wouldn't go back to sleep (easily) last week, so now I realize he just wasn't fully ready to wake up. He just needed that extra help.  Hopefully it's not a long regression. I read it can be months long for some babies."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 5 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"Husband is going running all day (literally) so I'm going to try to be productive, not sure what that entails. It's so hot and without AC I'm sort of limited to what rooms I can be in (like the bonus room that needs to get painted is over the garage and gets blistering!). Probably just clean. Also definitely watching the world cup! I really really hope we win!!!"
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 5 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I had a pretty chill day yesterday even though I had to work.  I didn't do much, checked the club every hour and set at my desk.  I got home, had dinner and laid down.  An hour later I started having contractions again.  I already had about 100oz of water by then but decided to force more water so I don't have to go the L&D again.  They were not BH, they were the same ones I had Tue-Thu.    I have to work today, only 5 hours or so, but I am off tomorrow.  If they come back tonight I may have to go back in.  I really don't think they are doing anything to my cervix at this point but they really stressed it out to come in if they make their come back.  Ugh...don't like hospitals.  They are boring and uncomfortable."
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,MrsDragon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:35:42 2015 UTC,Hospitals are the worst. How long did your contractions go on for last night? Did the water help?  I'm stressed for you. I hope this is a distressing thing you have to get through but not a run-up to preterm labor.
InfertilityBabies,3c7181,Zoraptera,2,Sun Jul 5 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is pre-term labor.  They lasted for 3 hours or so.  Thye feel like medium/strong period cramps.  I was in a out of sleep till about 2:30am because of super frequent bathroom breaks and I forgot about them so I'm assuming they went away.   I feel off today too, just a dull semi-strong belly pain.  I'm about to leave for work.  I 'have' to be there till at least 3pm.  My hospital is just across the street so I don't have far to go.    I am not really worried but I want them to go away.  I will hydrate today like it 's my job and see what the afternoon brings."

Success!!! He did say it's harder to get her in and out of this one, but I know after he gets some more practice it'll be super easy for him!   M was so great at the wedding yesterday, she slept right through dinner and then woke up and was all smiles and coos later in the night. She is such a little charmer! My Mr. got to catch up with some of his old friends there too, which was really nice. One of them had literally never held a baby before in his life and he held M and was so sweet, it was pretty cute!

Which is weird, cuz it was HOURS after eating/drinking.  It was very odd.

InfertilityBabies,3c6pkn,ReigningPotatoes,5,Sun Jul 5 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you're hungry, you eat. The baby is not hungry but growing a baby is a lot of work and you obviously need to up your caloric intake - PROTEIN - and eat when your body tells you to eat.

InfertilityBabies,3c6pkn,PrincessCBHammock,3,Sun Jul 5 12:27:51 2015 UTC,"Agree, the baby isn't hungry, you are because you are growing a baby. I kept a box of protein granola bars in my nightstand for whenever I needed a snack."

InfertilityBabies,3c6pkn,Vexwyf,2,Sun Jul 5 16:59:59 2015 UTC,I made strawberry pie with vegan whipped cream for the fourth and totally thought of you!

Some ideas:  cheese sticks  yogurt (preferably full fat or at least low fat, not non fat)  a glass of 2% or whole milk  spoonful of peanut butter  apple, carrots and celery and peanut butter  energy bar w/a good protein:carb ratio  hard boiled eggs  cheese and crackers  1/2 peanut butter or almond butter sandwich  toast with peanut butter, almond butter or cheese  trail mix"
InfertilityBabies,3c6pkn,traveler5678,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"100% this! I also love baby bell peppers (they are a little sweet and refreshing), dried fruit, presliced fruit, sliced tomatoes, olives. Not protein, but sometimes (esp in the morning/afternoon) it was good to mix it up. I've eaten more hardboiled eggs this pregnancy than any other time in my life."

InfertilityBabies,3c6pkn,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sun Jul 5 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"My rule for myself was that if I got up to eat in the middle of the night, it had to be something healthy. I typically did some nuts, fresh fruit, or dried fruit. I was dairy-free during pregnancy, but a yogurt or string cheese would also be a great option!"
InfertilityBabies,3c6pkn,Iamagnu,2,Sun Jul 5 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"I'm also 12 weeks, and this has been happening to me a lot lately, but I chalked it up to being a fat glutton, so I'm relieved to hear that I am not alone, and that the likely cause is pregnancy, not unrepentant gluttony.  I've been on a granola kick, so have been making myself little cups of granola with trail mix, just like 1/4 cup, to tamp down the beast and go back to sleep. I have felt guilty, when my husband catches me in the morning sleeping on the couch, with obvious snack detritus on the coffee table."
InfertilityBabies,3c6pkn,Vexwyf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"I always found a yogurt helpful or something like a banana or some grapes or something. Crackers never seemed to do it for me...

InfertilityBabies,3c4fyi,dobberkins,6,Sat Jul 4 18:05:02 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear you have to worry.   I don't have very specific advice.  Nothing you do or don't do will change the outcome.  The best you can do is to stay distracted and try not to think about it.  I'm assuming you are going in for another scan next week to determine if things have improved.   I'll be thinking about you.  I'm sorry you have to go through it.  Nothing about it is easy.
InfertilityBabies,3c4fyi,vibeee,2,Sat Jul 4 18:58:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  And yes, the doctor said there's nothing we can do at this point but wait.  I have another ultrasound on Tuesday to see what the status is so we're just waiting till then."
InfertilityBabies,3c4fyi,vibeee,2,Sat Jul 4 20:09:20 2015 UTC,I hope it turns out to be positive.  Fingers crossed.
InfertilityBabies,3c4fyi,exilius,3,Sat Jul 4 20:26:13 2015 UTC,"A lady in my local ivf group is still going through this. At 27 weeks the baby is measuring 4 weeks behind. Her fluid levels change but are always super low. They are talking about inducing her in the next couple of weeks. Her Harmony test came back inconclusive and of her 2 obs 1 thinks it's just a very small baby with placenta issues and wants to push out delivery and have a csection, the other thinks downs, wants to deliver ASAP and vaginally as she believes the baby will be born sleeping either way.  So essentially she's been given 50/50 even now.   I hope and pray everything is good for the pair of you"
InfertilityBabies,3c4fyi,exilius,2,Sun Jul 5 09:47:51 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness, I'm not sure if I'd be strong enough for that especially with two conflicting doctors, I always trust that they know what they're doing and wouldn't know which to go with."

InfertilityBabies,3c4fyi,bordertrilogy,3,Tue Jul 7 12:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you are going through this.  I had a pregnancy after my first IVF last year. At every ultrasound-- 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks-- the baby measured very small, about a week behind. A heartbeat was detected the first couple times, but ultimately did not make it.   We had a D&C so a genetic test could be done, and the baby had trisomy 6.  I'm sorry, I know that is not a heartening story, and it doesn't mean yours will go the same way. I just want you to know I understand how terrifying this is. There's nothing to do but wait and the waiting is excruciating. My heart goes out to you and your husband."
InfertilityBabies,3c4fyi,pamplemousse2,3,Sun Jul 5 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your story, I appreciate it.  I'm the type that appreciates any and all information, even if it isn't positive.  I keep switching between being ok and sobbing, but I'm going to guess this is fairly normal.  If things turn out poorly I plan on taking next week off work to take some time to myself and throwing myself into some craft projects."

It went much better than my first one for many reasons, but chief among them: I am not sick right now! Also the course was not short like the last one! I set a PR and shaved almost 3 entire minutes off my best 5k in training. I did have to walk a couple of times but I totally made it yaaay!  For the rest of the day I have not much planned. BBQ this afternoon at a friend's house. That's it. We might go check out the fair today but we might not. We'll see how we're all feeling.   Happy 4th everyone!"

InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,honmamichin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This race is called the ""fastest"" in the state because it's almost all down hill and they basically bill it as a race to set PRs in, so that helped for sure. After doing the math I was actually only 2:47 minutes faster than my best training PR, so not quite ""almost 3 minutes"" but still a big improvement! :) I am still pretty slow though, haha. I only ""beat"" 49 other people out of almost 450 runners and I came in 34th of 37 people in my age group, haha. My official time was 35:47.  I'm surprised how much I like running since I started! I'm definitely going to keep it up. I think I am going to try to train for a 10k in December and then maybe aim for the half marathon series my city's running club puts on next year."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,skunk-works,2,Sat Jul 4 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"Still, that's almost a full minute per mile improvement... Probably more since you said you walked a little.  That's not too shabby.  I love love love longer distance.   Its so nice to be able to go out and do a 60 to 90 minute run.  It's surprisingly relaxing.  It takes a while to get there, but once you are..."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,traveler5678,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"YES. I ran a half a few years ago, and in training learned I HATE the half, but LUUUUURVE a 10-12k run. No running for me this season due to the ankle (although I might pick it up again in Sept/Oct depending on how I'm feeling), but I really want to get back to being able to head out for 60min runs.  So much better than the 20k+ runs. So relaxing, and you're not destroyed for the rest of the day (me, anyways)."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,Iamagnu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"It's still an accomplishment though!  One of the things I've always liked about running is that it's something where I know I won't be near the best, even if I give it my all.  (Not that I'm the best at anything else either, but with running I'm really really far from the front of the pack.)  It's nice to have something that's so purely for yourself!  I can't wait to hear about your 10k training and half marathon plans.  Hopefully I'll be training soon too!"

My aunt kept passive-aggressively mentioning they'd love to meet the babies today even though when they asked (via my dad) a few days ago we said we weren't having any visitors yet. Otherwise it was uneventful, which is all I can ask for when that side of the family comes to visit (they're a bit awful).  After brunch we went and spent some time with the boys. They're still tiny but 1lb makes a big difference and their little faces are started to look fat. I love it. Tomorrow they come off c-pap and the neonatologist said to get ready because after that things go really quickly! Everything we need for them to come home will be here by Tuesday, and I've got most of their ""nursery area"" in our room set up. I hope it's not sitting empty and unused for too much longer!!"

Trying to finish up some work work, house work and baby work before the baby comes today and then we're going to see the fireworks tonight.  I'm 38 weeks today and getting bigger by the minute.  I think this is going to be a big baby!  I'm still following the GD diet and exercise plan prescribed by my dietician, but for some reason I seem to be packing on the pounds even though my blood sugar looks really good.   I'm so excited but a little nervous about birth injuries if the baby is too large."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,traveler5678,2,Sat Jul 4 14:50:10 2015 UTC,"I gained quite a bit toward the end of pregnancy too and I think most of that was just water weight. My face, legs, fingers, etc were all quite puffy and I didn't really realize it until I compared pictures of myself late pregnancy to how I look now. Hopefully baby stays a nice reasonable size for you!   No harm is starting some perineal massage and reading about birthing to help prepare yourself though :)"
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,traveler5678,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"I just looked up perineal massage and I am going to start it tonight.  Thank you so much!  I've read Birthing from Within and it had a lot of really useful information in it.  I wonder if the weight gain is from water weight.  I've been using my wedding ring as a gauge and it seems to still fit the same, but it's hard to tell for sure.  I don't mind if I gain non-water weight myself, just hoping the baby isn't gaining too quickly."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,traveler5678,2,Sat Jul 4 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"M wasn't huge, but she was big enough (8lb 3oz) and I managed to not have any perineal tearing! I haven't read that book so not sure if you already know this, but when you're pushing if you do it gradually and let the baby's head slip back up a little after each push it'll help things to stretch and reduce the risk of tearing. My midwife also used a warm damp washcloth on the perineal area while I was pushing and I think that really helped, might be something you can do too?  Sorry for the unsolicited TMI lol!"
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,cakegroove,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:07:54 2015 UTC,That's awesome and no worries about TMI here!  I would love to be able to do that while I'm pushing but I going to a pretty traditional OB practice and am not sure who will be doing the delivery.

But that doesn't mean it's going to be easy to stop worrying! If it helps, one of my cousins was 10lbs when she was born, had a shoulder dystocia, and it got hairy for a couple of minutes, but they got her born JUST FINE.

I'm contemplating making a new imgur account because I have no idea what my login is, and I'm not sure when I will be home again to get to figure it out!   My LC is phenomenal. We have made such progress in a week. Nicky actually took some from the breast today! We are using a nipple shield because he's been using a soother and I think my nipple wasn't stimulating him to suck. It's been so rewarding and fun to watch him latch.   One thing that's driving me crazy is my husband. Lol. He's so interested in what's going on that he hovers and just wants to know everything about my boob. He stares in there and tries to get in and help. I had to tell him today that he was distracting Nicky and to back off. Seriously... Lol. I know he just wants to help, but how about he learns to change a diaper instead?? Mmmmkay? Thanks.   Yesterday I went home for the afternoon, had a nap, and showered. While I was doing that, my mom put my nursery together. It looks so awesome, I can not wait to get home and get in there. It gave me such a great boost of positivity, which I needed.

I know what you mean about the husband. Mine too, especially early on - he wanted (and still wants!) to help, so he'd be all up in my grill, trying to help get the kid latched or what have you, and it was like DUDE. BACK OFF. Kiddo and I just need to handle this. When I was already stressed getting the kid to eat, it did NOT help to have my husband touching stuff and getting in the way!  Stuff your husband can do... absolutely, change diapers. Mine changed most of the diapers early on. It was awesome. Get you food/drinks. Get you hot packs for your boobs if you're using them (or cold packs for after you nurse). Be in charge of washing the nipple shield after you nurse. Learn to swaddle like a pro. The NICU nurses will help him, and then he'll be the expert at putting Nicky down. (My husband really liked that, and was always the better swaddler of the two of us.) Burp Nicky. Make sure the formula is ready if you're still supplementing, and feed him his formula. Get you food and water.  All of those things are things that Nicky needs, and ones that he can totally do!  And yeah, selfishly, I'd love for you to make a new Imgur account - I wanna see your handsome boy!!!"

Not quite sure on the best advice regarding your husband.  It sounds sweet but I can understand how it would be very distracting. Maybe make a list of things that you need help with (diaper changes, bathing, etc.) to help him feel involved?"
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,revangelfire,3,Sat Jul 4 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"Went to MIL's bbq yesterday...I expected it to just be them, my two BIL's and husband's aunt, uncle, and cousin, but she also invited some of her friends to come over to see the baby, which meant that she barely got to sleep, was way overtired during our way back home, and hasnt been fed properly (as in my schedule was way off).  She seemed to get confused when we bottle fed her during one instance, so I was hesitant to do that again.  And in the middle of the night, I missed a feeding by almost 1 hour, because I was so tired and slept through an alarm.  I still feel bad about that, because I was so engorged she had a hard time latching on and I'm not sure she got enough milk.  I secretly wish I could just say fuck it and formula feed, because at least I will know how much food she is getting, but I feel guilty, even though I know nothing is wrong with ff.    Also I found out my cousin is pregnant.  She got married this past February I think, and literally got knocked up right away.  I'm glad they don't have fertility issues, but getting pregnant right away still baffles me.  They are Orthodox Jews, and she's in her mid 30's so they have pressure to get things going, but still!  That's not the way I wanted to start a family, but I'm jealous of her fertility, and scared of the possibility that because I don't know why we had a hard time conceiving, and because ART/IF tx failed us horribly, our little girl may be our only child.  This whole sotuation brings up a lot of mixed feelings for me."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,honmamichin,4,Sat Jul 4 14:54:27 2015 UTC,":( it is really hard to learn how to keep your baby on a schedule when there are so many people who want to see them. I think it's a bit uncool of your MIL not to have informed you that more people were coming...  On the breastfeeding, I know - the lack of metrics is hard. She'll let you know if she isn't getting enough though, by fussing and wanting to eat! And try not to stress about the bigger gap between the feeds - she would have woken you up if she were really hungry. Basically: babies are resilient little beasts. They're designed to survive while we figure out what the hell we're doing. It will be OK. For what it is worth, breastfeeding is TOUGH at first, but then (starting around 6 weeks for us) it gets SO much easier. Way easier than formula feeding. And the engorgement goes away. So if breastfeeding is what you want to do, hang in there! It gets better!  And your cousin... It sucks how it fertility is so much at the forefront for us! I'm always thinking about it. So I feel you."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,revangelfire,3,Sat Jul 4 15:58:05 2015 UTC,"Doing nothing sounds relaxing! We are having our friends over for the  4th for a BBQ, and I am so excited! It is our first one and is going to be like a test run for our pre-baby BBQ/ diaper party. Our neighborhood is like 50 feet outside city limits, so the entire neighborhood goes crazy with the fireworks and I love it!   Today I am 22 weeks, and we are so close to the point of viability that it is making me crazy! I don't really feel like there is anything wrong or that I will go into labor, but we have had a few babies born between 25 and 30 weeks in my family so I can't help but count down until baby New can survive if the worst were to happen. Anybody else feel this paranoia?"
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,female_engineer_here,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:55:41 2015 UTC,Yes to the paranoia!  I hope tonight is a blast! Be safe!
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,dutchqueen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:58:44 2015 UTC,Yes! It was such a relief to hit 24 weeks this week. My next mental milestone is 28 weeks and I'm actually excited to take the glucose screening test because if I get to take it that means we made it to 28!
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,try_new_stuff,3,Sat Jul 4 16:52:58 2015 UTC,Happy 4th and Happy Saturday!  I get the day off so we are soaking in the family time. We went out to breakfast and to a farmers market and now we are off to a bbq. My husband and I work opposite hours so family time is very precious!

InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,GrammaMo,3,Sat Jul 4 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"My husband and I told my parents Friday night. We were so excited but expressed to them NO ONE ELSE knows, just my best friend, and that we are keeping it quiet. By 12 noon the next day my parents told about 7 people. My husband seems pretty pissed, though he is very calm and mild mannered I can tell. We are only 7 weeks tomorrow and although we did chromosomal testing, this is obviously a very, very sensitive time. I expressed that to both parents individually and hope they got it.  Ugh. I love their excitement but they did go a bit overboard. I'm too sleepy to get angry at this point!  Ps happy 4th of July! We are cooking steaks and being lazy. It's rainy where I am (Poconos) so no fireworks for us!"
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,GrammaMo,2,Sat Jul 4 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"Noooo! I mean, yay sharing with family, but I'm really sorry that they didn't respect your wishes. (Also, not to be a Debbie Downer, but I'd think carefully in future about sharing any info with them that you might not want to share broadly, such as name, sex, etc.)  Hope you have a lovely lazy day!"

Mine told so many more people than I ever realized, though I didn't know that until much later in my pregnancy. Hopefully it's coming from a place of love and excitement and not narcissism. Try not to worry too much. Today you are pregnant. Enjoy!"

Enjoy your cruise! Take it easy! We appreciate you too!"
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,ThatGreenSolGirl,4,Sat Jul 4 16:30:09 2015 UTC,I'm glad you were able to come to a solid decision about the cruise. I would expect that the doctor would have told you to stay home if there was a legit concern. I bet you're going to have a great time!

InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,MrsDragon,2,Sat Jul 4 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"Happy 4th y'all!  Of course, because we're going to be out until probably midnight tonight, I did not sleep at all last night.  Going to speak to my doctor on Monday about just having my entire rib cage removed.  Its one of those unnecessary body parts, right?  So, I'll be napping before we go!    Also, I downloaded/purchased Kindle Unlimited.  It's like, 10 bucks a month, and there are soooo many (free) books available.  Not anything necessarily anything of great value, but when you blow through books like I do, it's awesome!  Also, things that make me hormontional lately: everything :)"
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,lancealittle,2,Sat Jul 4 15:53:39 2015 UTC,I have kindle unlimited and it is AMAZING! For me books tend to be quantity over quality because I go through them so fast. It is frustrating that a ton of the books are actually short stories that are only 30 or 40 pages.
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,MrsDragon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah yeah, totally! I'm super sorry your ribs are bothering you so much. It's almost over!!!  Kindle unlimited sounds like an excellent idea. Hhhmmm..."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,becabecaful,2,Sat Jul 4 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"No real plans today (yay). Heading to gym with my husband at some point, hopefully getting to the store to order glider/recliner and maybe some house projects (really should try to make progress on something). This week got derailed for us as we were helping BIL move yesterday and the days before helping a friend whose kid is really sick in the hospital and his wife was out of town. We drove her from the airport Thursday and Thursday night they finally figured out /decided what the kid had. I had been worried about it being a weird virus I could catch but they were mostly thinking autoimmune. Well sure enough, get a call Thursday that he has parvo (fifth's disease) and an autoimmune. I'm so grateful my OB tested me for antibodies for that early on and that I'm immune or I would have been freaking out all weekend (even though only 5% of pregnant women that actually contract the virus have serious complications with the fetus). My husband felt so so bad because it was his friend. All's well that ends well."
InfertilityBabies,3c3skn,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sat Jul 4 16:23:55 2015 UTC,"Congratulations (?) on the negative pregnancy test, I was definitely waiting to see your results! I think I need to order some internet cheapies soon too. I had a period at like 5 weeks postpartum so I know I'm going to be constantly wondering if I'm fertile/pregnant.   We're off to a wedding today! M isn't really welcome at the ceremony so we'll be dropping my husband off and picking him up after to go to the reception. Coincidentally, there's somebody selling a used baby carrier at a really good price near the church so we'll be trying it on to see if we like it. Hey, gotta kill time somehow eh?   And speaking of carriers, my husband is in a purple shirt and tie today and suggested I wear M in my new purple (beautiful!!) mei tai so we'd match and because he thinks it looks fancier than my ring sling. Maybe he's starting to see the appeal in having a stash of baby carriers?"

If it were even a month from now, I might be a little bummed about not being pregnant, but it's just too soon, in an ideal world. We're just starting to get our shit together!  I hope you guys have a great day today! Super exciting that your man is starting to see the appeal of carrier options... There may be hope yet! Hahaha."

I had been waiting to play that song for my baby for so, so long, and I just couldn't believe I was finally doing it. I was so happy and overwhelmed.  I've never heard that one - it's beautiful!"

InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,revangelfire,16,Fri Jul 3 20:22:27 2015 UTC,"First I would wait to find out the degree of the previa, and then talk to your doctor more about what they think, if possible.   At first I was going to agree with everyone else and say just go, but basically every medical source I can find on this strongly urges women with major placenta previa not to travel at all and especially to remote areas or by boat because, in the rare case that it does start bleeding, there is a much higher risk that the mother's life could be put into grave danger in a very short amount of time and medical transport may not be able to handle that sort of situation en-route. So if it's major, I would say don't go.   If it's minor, try to get some idea of the actual risk from your doctor and whether they think pelvic rest would be enough to lower the risk to an acceptable level for you. Also consider whether worrying about it would be worth it (are you going to be able to enjoy yourself, or will you just be freaking out the whole time about ""what if""?)."
InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,honmamichin,3,Fri Jul 3 21:48:47 2015 UTC,And then you show up with the best advice here!
InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,pamplemousse2,6,Fri Jul 3 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"For my circumstances. I wouldn't go. I have a history of losses and when I was pregnant with the one that ""stuck"" I didn't even want to travel 5 hours from home for a weekend. My concern wasn't that anything was going to happen, but rather that IF something went wrong I would be in a strange place with strange doctors, and that would elevate my anxiety and stress in an already complicated situation (I am diabetic, and hypothyroid, in addition to having many risk factors for preeclampsia -which I wound up actually having after the baby was born) But, everyone is different. In the end it comes down to your comfort level, and ultimately how comfortable you would be in the care of new doctors in the rare case that something does go wrong."
InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,SuperRacx,5,Fri Jul 3 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"My only thought from my one cruise experience.... Incidental walking far exceeded what I would expect just for meals and stuff.   My Fitbit numbers surprised me.   If you are really supposed to rest, that could be harder without staying in your stateroom."
InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,Pamzella,4,Fri Jul 3 23:38:48 2015 UTC,I would go - there's nothing to be done about it at home! Maybe take it easy on any excursions you may take? But I don't know much about it. Good luck!
InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,Hopecat,3,Fri Jul 3 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it is really an issue with delivery, and a lot of the time the placenta moves on its own as the uterus expands more. They will likely continue to monitor you to see if it moves enough to safely attempt vaginal delivery, and if not will schedule a c-section. Your cervix is sealed up tight by the mucous plug, so you really don't need to worry about swimming. Did the doctor say anything about pelvic rest? If not, all other normal activities (including sex) should be fine as well.  As far as insurance goes... You already had a pre-existing condition: pregnancy. If you were to go into labor early, you would need medical transport regardless (which is why cruise ships typically don't let women past a certain number of weeks pregnant on the cruise). Just listen to your body, stay well-hydrated, and have a relaxing trip! Your doctor's hesitation is most likely due to the fact that medical school trains them to always prepare for the worst-case scenario. Yes, there is a risk - there is always a risk - that if you travel you could go into labor without immediate hospital access. But that would be a serious problem with or without placenta previa if you're not at full term."

InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,ky_grown90,2,Fri Jul 3 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound bitchy: if you want a second opinion you need to ask another OB and not a bunch of strangers on the internet. I think you're looking for people to tell you what you want to hear but your Dr already advised against it and with everything you went through to get this pregnancy, why would you want to do anything that even has a slight possibility of putting you and or baby at risk?"
InfertilityBabies,3c14iw,PrincessCBHammock,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:48:15 2015 UTC,"I think I'd probably go and just take it really easy, which is really what a cruise is about anyways.  Maybe order more room service and less trips to the dining hall, always use the elevators, etc."

InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,curiouslywanting,3,Fri Jul 3 15:25:57 2015 UTC,I'm so thrilled for you. I remember two years ago we were both so in the trenches... And here you are with a third on the way! Yay!!!
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,vibeee,2,Fri Jul 3 20:35:45 2015 UTC,You know. You're going to have so many babies. It's awesome. Good karma from all the shit you went through! Yay!
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,Vexwyf,3,Fri Jul 3 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"Freedom Friday only because I'm taking it easy.  I will go in for two hours just to set up some stuff for the weekend.  I work both Sat and Sun.  Well, after two bags of saline(I wasn't dehydrated in the first place), one procadia pill they finaly let me go home.  I was contracting every 2-3 minutes regularly for 4 hours until I took a pill.  It took an hour after taking the pill to slow things down.  It looks like I was contracting pretty regularly the past 3 days.  It didn't feel like contractions.  It felt like semi strong period cramps.  I was told I wam not in early labor but that these are real conrtactions and they may eventually trigger dialation so they had to be stopped.    I think I had a stomach bug for about 3 days before all of those events happened.  I had diarrhea (sorry TMI) for 3 days before the soreness and cramps started.    They definitely want me to come right in if is happens again today.  If everything dies down and it happenes again lets say next week I can try to wait it out for and hour or two but if it doesn't stop I have to go back again.    And yeah, cervical checks are no fun.  Very uncomfortable.  Good news my little boy is head down(he was transverse until just about a week ago) and my OB could feel his head in the birth canal!  He also hates the monitoring.  He wasn't moving much if at all befire I got to the hospital and the minute they put the monitor on him he just started playing with it and hard!  Thank you ladies for all of the support yesterday.  You are awesome and so caring!   One last thing, I didn't realized my husband was really stressed through out this whole process.  They talked about keeping me overnight etc. just to watch me and I think it really freaked him ot.  He appread cool as a pickle but shred with me later on that he was scared for the baby.  I knew things are more or less under control so. I wasn 't very worried.  Talk to your SO's if you are in similar situation.  They don't know much about dialation, protein in urine etc.    Sorry for a wall of text but I'm hoping this help somebody one day.  I don't want to make a whole new post.  Edit to add:  my BP was 159/95 when I walked in.  They got it down to 120/85 by the time I left."
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:45:37 2015 UTC,Glad to hear that you got the help that you needed.  I hope that you don't feel more contractions so your little one can bake longer in the oven!

InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, stressful! I'm so glad they were able to get the contractions to shut down and sent you home. How many weeks are you now?"
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:40:22 2015 UTC,31w3d.  It was a bit much.  I almost ignored it.  I mean I did for the first 2 days.  I really hope it doesn't come back because spending a holiday in the hospital is the worst.  We don't have big plans but we can easily get stuck in the hospital because there is not enough doctors etc.
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:51:52 2015 UTC,Did they ask you to keep an eye on your BP?
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,becabecaful,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:13:02 2015 UTC,They actually didn't but they did all of the testing for pre-aclempsia and it all came back negative.
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,Hopecat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"That's excellent. If they didn't say to watch out, they must not be concerned. That being said, when my BP was super high post partum (the start of my pre-e) I was feeling sick - REALLY nauseated - and thought it was just exhaustion or something. It responded to gravol. I know now that I should have gotten my BP checked, but had no idea that could be a symptom. So if all of a sudden you feel like you've got the flu, you might want to get yourself checked out. You will probably NOT, but I wish I had known!"
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:00:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for the tip.  I am a great candidate for pre-e.  Pre pregnancy my BP was always on the high end of normal 135/90 - around that mark.  I was never put on any meds but I was always told to remind my OB during pregnancy to keep an eye on it.  I won't be surprised if it becomes an issue.  I hope not but I know it is a possibility.
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,razzertto,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:06:32 2015 UTC,"That super sucks. But in that case... Know that you can develop pre-e up to 6 weeks post partum! Again, this is rare, but good to know. Pre-e, caught early, is definitely manageable, and I do not want to stress you out about it. But I do think that it's good to know what to look for, generally, especially if you're a candidate!"
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"Woah vibeee , glad you went to have it checked out. Good to hear it's sorted for now, let's hope it stays that way."

InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,futurecompanion11,2,Fri Jul 3 22:23:36 2015 UTC,Question:   The four month sleep regression. What were your strategies? How did you get through it? I have a pretty decent sleeper right now (at 3.5 months) and I'd like to be prepared. Book recommendations? Anything at all to help would be appreciated.
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,pamplemousse2,3,Fri Jul 3 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"Uh, we went the ""white knuckle and try to give reach other naps"" route. Not helpful, sorry!"
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,futurecompanion11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much just used the mantra ""this too shall pass"" and ""whatever it takes to get through the day"". We had sleep regressions but they really truly were not long or horrible, promise."
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,RositaYouBitch,2,Fri Jul 3 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"Woke up with a migraine this morning. Have been weirdly sensitive to smells a couple of times. Told husband to come home from work with a pregnancy test. Ugh. I don't think I'm pregnant, but there's this little bit of doubt...  Talked to BIL's ex last night. It was really good to talk to her. I was secretly hoping that she was going through some kind of other crisis, and she didn't really want to break up, but nope. It's over. So sad. Going to try to be in Toronto this summer though, and have a visit with her.  On the baby news, we are SO CLOSE to top teeth! I was trying to get a pic of the teeth buds, and kiddo reached for my phone and managed to take a picture, so at 6 months and 2 days, he had officially taken his first selfie."
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jul 3 16:47:12 2015 UTC,No GD for me! Found out this morning. I do have low iron though so I have to start taking iron supplements.
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,dutchqueen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"Congrats! Sorry about the iron. I found that a slow release version played less havoc with my stomach. Taking with vitamin C helps increase absorption, and avoid tackling with calcium which blocks absorption. Also, liquid iron is awful and should be avoided at all costs."

InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,ky_grown90,2,Fri Jul 3 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"You guys, it is SO NICE to be back with my husband and out if my parent's house. I'm eternally grateful to them for helping us out and letting us stay there but things are so much easier in our own space. I got to manage witching hour the other night on my own. I bumped the temperature in the house down so we were comfy in the moby wrap and I didn't have to also comfort my mom's fretting and suggestions.   In not-great news, I am only not quite 9 weeks PP and my period arrived already. I feel like it's messing with my supply too. I don't feel letdown at all for the past 2 days. Is that a thing?"
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,Sweetmusic_01,2,Fri Jul 3 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yay being in your own space! My supply totally takes a hit when I get my period, that's definitely a thing. Don't worry, it will bounce back up."
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,Iamagnu,2,Fri Jul 3 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"After very low movement the last two days, both passed the NST (as usual), with no issues.  Not a single BH the entire time.  Now, for the last two hours, I've been having BH's every 15 minutes or so.  Makes it hard to breathe, but they're just not doing anything useful! Both are over 6lb now.  In other news, we now have packing boxes! Packing a little tomorrow morning, 4th party in the evening, and then packing a bit more on Sunday.  We have a month, but there's so much to do!"
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,messofletters,2,Fri Jul 3 22:31:30 2015 UTC,Had another non-stress test this morning. Everything checked out alright. They had to use an acoustic stimulator to wake him up. So they sent me home. Dealing with lower back period like cramping and non-painful contractions. I don't wanna wait 'till my OB appointment on Tuesday. :(
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:02:39 2015 UTC,Keep an eye on that period like cramping- especially since it's lower back. That was the feeling at the start of my labor! Hope baby decides to come soon!
InfertilityBabies,3bzs9j,messofletters,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:18:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. :)  Been feeling the cramps since Wednesday night. I don't mind waiting till after the holiday at this point.

I think she cheated a little, though--she was doing tummy time on the bed, and she rolled in the direction of her 190-pound dad, who was sitting next to her. Also, she is definitely out of newborn clothes now! She's still a little peanut (8.5 pounds-ish, at a guess?), but she's growing well!  I'm thinking of starting a catalog of things I've dropped on my daughter's head while wearing her in the Lillebaby."

InfertilityBabies,3bypty,RositaYouBitch,3,Sat Jul 4 02:39:15 2015 UTC,"I had a low PAPP-A protein with Pond. It can be indicative of Downs but in my case, the other two markers for Down's were normal so it was just the PAPP-A. The big risk, as I understood, with the low PAPP-A is that it can restrict growth. My pregnancy was very smooth. I had the normal scans and then at 32 weeks I began weekly non-stress tests. I'd go into the hospital and lay there while they monitored Pond's heartbeat and my contractions for about 30 minutes every Monday morning. They also checked my amniotic fluid levels which was kind of awesome because I got to see him every week after 32 weeks. I also had two more growth scans at 32 and 36 weeks. Everything turned out just fine for us. Pond arrived on his own at 39+1 at 7 lbs. 6.5oz. It sucks that there's one more thing to worry about but you'll be monitored closely and hopefully it'll be nothing to worry about for you guys too. I'm so happy to see you back here. Congrats again!"
InfertilityBabies,3bypty,PrincessCBHammock,2,Fri Jul 3 09:04:13 2015 UTC,Oh thank you for sharing your story! From what I've read and people I have spoken too it's not an uncommon thing to have show up in your blood tests. Here's hoping for a smooth run! Thanks again :)
InfertilityBabies,3bypty,exilius,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"I was all freaked out but my OB was totally casual about it. Like, ""we'll monitor you but it's totally not necessary.

InfertilityBabies,3bypty,pnut,2,Sat Jul 4 02:39:50 2015 UTC,Low papp-a can also indicate placenta issues (high risk for pre e) and is very common with ivf. More than half my irl ivf friends had low papp-a and we all had higher than background risks due to our bloods. Only one of the 20 or so 'higher risk' pregnancies was a downs pregnancy and her combined risk had come back as 1 in 15.
InfertilityBabies,3bypty,larabair,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"Ohhh thanks for sharing! Yes our risk of downs went up but is still considered low risk. I'm more concerned about the scary placenta issues but I'm really trying not to worry, we have an awesome OB who I am sure will take good care of us. I didn't know it was more common with IVF, I wonder why that is?"
InfertilityBabies,3bypty,LowOnHope,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but it's the reason many OB will treat ivf pregnancies as high risk and why we're meant to deliver before 40w.

InfertilityBabies,3c0yhm,zinnia86,4,Fri Jul 3 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"Have a full bladder for the IUI. There's a small increase in success, and it can make inserting the catheter easier/less uncomfortable. Ask for a thinner catheter if the first one they attempt hurts. Tell them if you cramp up with the catheter insertion - if the do the insemination while you're still cramping the cramp/pain may last for a while.  I will say to try not to put any stock into odds. I had two IUIs with a projected 20-30% success rate (multiple follicles, excellent post-wash count) and they both failed. The one that worked had only a 5-7% success rate - only one follicle, and the post-wash count was abnormally low (possibly due to a fever my husband had a little while before the IUI). For me, I honestly found it easier not to hope for things to be successful. It still hurt when my cycles failed but it hurt more when a piece of me believed it would work.  Focus on keeping yourself busy during the two week wait, it was one of the few things that helped me cope."
InfertilityBabies,3c0yhm,septicidal,3,Fri Jul 3 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"The one month I did nothing extra was the month we conceived.  I had tried pineapple, taking the day off work to ass the couch, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember.  For the IUI that worked I went to the office after it was over, worked the rest of the day and came home afterwards as if it was any other day. Little did I know that sperm was meeting egg and I now have an almost 4 month old son.  My IUI was actually 1 year ago today."

I didn't give up alcohol or caffeine because the RE told me not to, we had a less than 5% chance of it taking and she didn't want me to get my hopes up. I did the ""boy diet"" just for fun and had twin boys but I think it was coincidence. (Now I really want a girl and I hope the girl diet works haha!)   I also tried really hard not to think about it and let myself stress for about 30 minutes a day when I did a daily pee test to test out the trigger. After that I didn't think about it as much as possible. The trigger shot wasn't bad at all. I iced the area and honestly couldn't feel it but it was a mindfuck of anxiety beforehand!  Best of luck to you!!!"
InfertilityBabies,3c0yhm,x2effect,2,Fri Jul 3 20:39:15 2015 UTC,"What is the ""trigger""?"
InfertilityBabies,3c0yhm,pnkpanthr25,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:32:54 2015 UTC,Ovidrel trigger shot. It forces ovulation after the clomid helps the eggs mature. It's an injection you do at home in your stomach.
InfertilityBabies,3c0yhm,Marie197,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"I did acupuncture and had a massage the day before the second IUI that worked. I also took CoQ10. Who knows what really worked though? I exercised like normal, which included boxing classes (great coping skill for me). I had been limiting caffeine and alcohol but didn't completely remove from diet.We didn't have a good chance of success either but here we are, 30 weeks pregnant with twins!

InfertilityBabies,3by0as,Bhotel21,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:01:12 2015 UTC,"That's a good tip!   I have been icing, but in just 3 days, damn, I am purple.   The red puncture marks are even more weird...  The Arixtra never did that."
InfertilityBabies,3by0as,Bhotel21,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:04:02 2015 UTC,"The marks are crazy looking. I must have hit a vessel last night because I had a bleeder. A couple of weeks ago, my midwife looked at bruising and told me I was injecting wrong. I was totally defiant and insisted I was doing it with the bevel down. Clearly I wasn't as most of my giant bruises have cleared up and I just have baby bruising now. I also wasn't expecting to do the shots 2x a day, so my belly is quite colorful. Thank god for these meds though. The regiment makes me feel like I am way more in control!"
InfertilityBabies,3by0as,OrganizedSprinkles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:16:16 2015 UTC,"Trying it your way!   I was prepared for bruising, but it's like sore where it touches my clothes /when I lay down.   Not cool."

InfertilityBabies,3by0as,larabair,3,Fri Jul 3 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!! That's quite the journey you've had, so that's great that things seem to be working out this time around and that you were able to get your progesterone numbers up. Fingers crossed for your scan on Thursday!!"
InfertilityBabies,3by0as,Zoraptera,3,Fri Jul 3 14:08:42 2015 UTC,Nice to see you here!  Congrats!  I also love hiking.  I was really sick during first trimester so I didn 't do much.  From about 14-26 weeks I was back to normal.  The past few weeks have been a challenge because I get tons of BH anytime I got uphill or take the stairs.  Just listen to you body and you'll be fine!

I am 12 weeks today, and just had an ultrasound (the nuchal fold one) and it looks like everything is on target. So... Maybe #8 is a keeper?  I don't know what else to say, except holy shit I am still scared but today I feel like the luckiest woman alive and maybe that's what made me feel daring enough to come post here today.  Hi!"

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,skunk-works,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:16:49 2015 UTC,Ya I know but last week someone posted under a throwaway that she had a ten month old and is pregnant. Meaning she was a member here.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,8,Fri Jul 3 15:20:47 2015 UTC,"O started waving!!  As i was leaving this morning, my wife called me urgently back into the bedroom.  When I got there, she said that when I walked out, he looked at the door and started waving at me.  So I waved to him and he got a huge smile and waved back.  It's absolutely adorable."

It's adorable and husband is over the moon that my first baby purchase involved his beloved Orioles.    We're heading off to the shore this weekend with in-laws so will be interesting.  I still need to find some pajamas or something that will work just in case my sleeping space gets invaded (again!)."

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,spankyjubblies,7,Thu Jul 2 21:24:45 2015 UTC,A month ago today I went into labor.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,NBPTS,3,Thu Jul 2 15:22:07 2015 UTC,That's a big milestone. How are you feeling?
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,spankyjubblies,6,Thu Jul 2 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"I've been feeling pretty ok, but I woke up feeling sad today. I think partly because a lot of my friends have had babies recently and they got to bring them home while I'm still trying to make 3 hours of kangaroo care feel like it's enough.   Of course I'm happy that the boys are healthy and growing, but being apart from them is hard."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 2 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"It's not just hard, it's inhumane. It's unnatural. No mom should ever be separated from their baby/babies. I always knew they were very sick and needed the care and were just where they needed to be but, damn, it sucks.  The absolute worst day of my life was the day I was discharged without my babies.   I'm so sorry. There are so many benefits to NICU after they get home (scheduling, oblivious to noise, etc) but this separation is the worst.   I'm sorry."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,HerVoiceEchoes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"It is unnatural. That echoes exactly what I've been thinking/feeling since I came home without them. I'm so glad for the excellent care they're getting, but that doesn't make it less hard to not be able to have them with me."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"Aw. : ( I'm glad you are doing mostly okay, but I can see how being surrounded by people who are taking their babies home would be especially rough. Visiting is never enough when what you really want is to be with them."

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,spankyjubblies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:18:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're going through this because it sounds so hard. I'm with /u/NBPTS and think it's just cruel to be separated from your babies so early on. S was in the NICU for only a couple weeks but even though I was discharged, I got to stay and ""room in"" with her the whole time and I am so grateful. You're doing what it takes for your guys to have the best care so hopefully you have peace in your heart about that aspect."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 2 22:32:11 2015 UTC,Where has all the time gone? Crazy. How's the boys?
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,apanda1084,5,Thu Jul 2 15:27:50 2015 UTC,I know. It's gone by fast but not fast enough! The boys are well. Sebastian's back to himself and in 3 more sleeps the c-pap masks come off.

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,spankyjubblies,3,Thu Jul 2 15:39:06 2015 UTC,How are they doing? Updates on Sebastian? How's Kangaroo care going?
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,vibeee,5,Thu Jul 2 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"Sebastian is back to normal, thank goodness. He's on antibiotics for 5 more days but that's it. Kangaroo care is great for everyone. Though sometimes Asher loves it too much and forgets to breathe because he's so cozy."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,curiouslywanting,6,Thu Jul 2 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"Apnea is scary but you keep snuggling that baby. I had a nurse tell me I shouldn't hold my daughter after her bottle because it was too over stimulating and that's why she was spitting up. The neonatologist told me that was flat out wrong and he didn't care who told me that. He said this in front of the nurse. He said the very best thing I could do for my babies was be there and let them know I was there. He said a mother's touch can do more to encourage development than any doctor or nurse.   I needed to hear that. I had become scared to hold my babies. I had started asking the nurses to do the feeds for fear I was doing it wrong.  Don't fall for that. You love and rock and hold those boys as much as you can. Not to mention how much YOU need it right now. They're on monitors. You'll know the second the apnea starts. And it can start if they're in the bed or on your chest so they might as well get all the kangaroo care benefits, too.   I'm sorry to be so passionate about this but I don't want you to blame yourself like I did and miss out on those precious moments."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,SJP8,3,Thu Jul 2 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"No, this is something to be passionate about. I want to echo this past about a bazillion times!"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,vibeee,2,Fri Jul 3 00:44:01 2015 UTC,"Thankfully the hospital we're at really encourages kangaroo care, so the nurses have been pretty great about doing what it takes to make it happen. There have only been two occasions when I decided along with the nurses that it would be best not to move & agitate a baby. Otherwise husband and I get our time in every day."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,cakegroove,6,Fri Jul 3 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"Just called my doctor.  They are on lunch but somebody shoudl call me back in 30 min or so.  More medium cramps, more feeling like I have to poop but it my belly(TMI sorry) and weird sharp pain when I pee or poop on the left side kinda by left ovary, maybe a little bit higher.  I had so many different symptoms the past few days I am at a total loss. None of them are super strong but something is going on and I don't know if it's normal.  Ugh...don't like calling doctors.  Edit: in L&D. I have been contracting every 2 minutes when I came in.  It's down to maybe every 5-6 minutes.  I didn't even know they were contractions.  It felt like medium period cramps.  Baby is doing great.  I also had really high blood pressure when I came in 159/95.  It did go down by now.  No protein in urine, no signs of pre-e.  Not dialated.    This is all great but I have been contracting for 3 days in a row.  It sucks to not get any answers.  My OB is on call today assisting with a c-section.  She will come talk to me when she is done.  For now I'm getting fluids, chlling and getting hungry!"

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,traveler5678,3,Thu Jul 2 19:38:57 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Me too.  I am going to L&D.  I have been contracting again every 5-7 minutes or so for the past hour.  Nothing super painful but I had it.  I want to make sure everything is fine.  I could wait it out again but if it comes back again I don't want to go to L&D on 4th of July weekend.  No thank you.

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,slumlord2001,7,Fri Jul 3 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"My husband told our neighbor that I'm pregnant, and the neighbor told freaking everyone. I met some random other neighbors and the original neighbor even announced it to them. I haven't even told my parents yet, since I haven't had any blood draws or ultrasounds or anything to even indicate that this thing might work out. I could not be more pissed."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,septicidal,2,Thu Jul 2 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"Aww, I don't blame you one bit for being upset."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,cakegroove,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's good to vent to people who understand."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,SJP8,2,Fri Jul 3 00:25:38 2015 UTC,"UGH, that is the worst! I am so sorry you are having to deal with the backlash.  I had to sit my husband down and have a very specific talk about who we weren't going to tell (uh, everyone) and when we would share, because I discovered that he was all set to start announcing things! Every so often, I still get surprised (like he told his parents the names we were considering, where as I'd be happy to not tell ANYONE until the babies are born. Yikes!)."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,SJP8,2,Thu Jul 2 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"I told him there was like a 30% chance of miscarriage at 4 weeks, but I guess he didn't believe me or didn't understand that meant it wasn't a good idea to tell everyone. I think he also didn't realize this neighbor (who is also a good friend of his) would blab to so many other people."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,PrincessCBHammock,5,Fri Jul 3 00:25:16 2015 UTC,"Also, can we talk about childcare providers? I hired this woman to come a couple of times a week to help me out so that I can go to the gym and do some errands. Yesterday she came for the first time and I swear to god, I hated having her in the house and couldn't wait to get my baby away from her. I don't know why it was so awful for me, but I really couldn't stand it. My husband said perhaps it was my sixth sense going off but... :::::shudders::::: I ended up just having her clean and only watching LL when I was showering. Am I being too much of a momma bear?"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,larabair,5,Thu Jul 2 14:09:41 2015 UTC,"If something doesn't feel right, just go with your gut.  You won't be able to enjoy yourself if you go out and don't feel like you trust the person watching your little one 100%.  If you are worried about hurting the woman's feelings, just go with something along the lines of, ""I thought about it some more, and I'm just not ready to leave the baby with someone other than family right now, I really appreciate your time.""  If you decide to look for someone else, maybe suggest a interview/playdate first so you can observe the person with your baby first before committing to pay them anything.  (Maybe you did do this, but if that's the case it might help to think about what was different between feeling okay about it and not feeling okay about it, if that might help you better screen people going forward.) Hopefully that will help you feel more comfortable."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,cakegroove,3,Thu Jul 2 14:17:56 2015 UTC,I had her here for an interview and I was uncomfortable but I just thought it was me being awkward about hiring someone to work in the house (which I have done before but always makes me feel weird). But yesterday when I was giving her instructions I felt like she wasn't really listening and there was something else that I couldn't put my finger on but it bothered me.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,RositaYouBitch,6,Thu Jul 2 14:37:26 2015 UTC,Don't have her back!!!
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,jaina_jade,4,Thu Jul 2 15:04:15 2015 UTC,Did she actually follow the instructions you gave?
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,RositaYouBitch,3,Thu Jul 2 15:15:03 2015 UTC,"Mostly? But, I didn't leave her anything difficult to do. One thing she did that bothered me was I told her not to wake the baby up from her nap and just to watch her while I went outside to water some plants and come get me if the baby woke up. She didn't do that, she just picked LL up and when I came in she was fussing. It immediately bothered me a lot."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,OrganizedSprinkles,3,Thu Jul 2 15:20:47 2015 UTC,Yeah...I can see why you're frustrated/fed up/don't like this lady.  It may be time to interview new people.  Do you have an online parents group in your area?  We have a yahoo parents group for our neighborhood and people make a lot recommendations/requests for nannies and babysitters (and posts to sell/give away stuff).
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,GrammaMo,3,Thu Jul 2 16:48:50 2015 UTC,Ya I'd keep looking. Just keep having people come while you're doing errands around the house and you'll find the right fit.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,5,Thu Jul 2 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"We lost a well over $1k deposit because I cried for 48 hours after bringing BB to our first daycare.  So now he's in another (very, very expensive) daycare.  If you're a momma bear I'm a momma bair."

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,becabecaful,3,Thu Jul 2 14:19:58 2015 UTC,"I'm considering having someone come in a few days each week too. I work from home and, for now, I'll be working 2-8pm so I need someone to look after Pond until husband gets home. I was thinking 2-6 three days per week. I checked out care.com and some of the leads were promising. I just don't know."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 2 16:13:34 2015 UTC,We've just started the process of looking at daycares and I've been less than thrilled with what we've seen so far.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,curiouslywanting,7,Thu Jul 2 16:38:48 2015 UTC,Pond's belly was doing so good. I made a few changes to my breastfeeding and started giving him gripe water and I cut out dairy and his crying fits were almost gone. Then I was an idiot and thought I'd try some ice cream the other night since everything I've read said dairy is very rarely an issue for infants. Yeah...he's been a mess for the past 2 days. :( Fuck you Ben & Jerry. Fuck you and your delicious ice cream that is making my kid a crying mess.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,SJP8,6,Thu Jul 2 16:16:35 2015 UTC,"Almond ice cream, little dreamers sandwiches. Hits the crave, without the dairy issues."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 2 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"The coconut ice cream (something Dream, I think?) is also amazing."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,vibeee,2,Thu Jul 2 18:49:10 2015 UTC,So Delicious makes a cashew ice cream now that's supposed to be amazing too!
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,GrammaMo,2,Thu Jul 2 22:58:51 2015 UTC,"Welp, at least you know what the issue is... I'd give it two weeks to a month before trying dairy again. Glad to hear Pond is feeling better at least!"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,6,Thu Jul 2 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"I love when babies start to get all that character with smiling and giggling!  My lab seems to have lost BOTH of my beta results from Monday and Wednesday. Neither have been posted on the database for my midwife or sent to my GP as requested and yesterday they didn't know why Mondays weren't even up. They should only take around 3 or 4 hours to post. I just want to know if everything is how it should be before my scan on Monday :(  EDIT: Results are in, don't know the numbers but midwife says results are great so my little seedling is staying put and I'm just going to be one of those people who spots. Can't wait to see it on Monday!"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,GrammaMo,3,Thu Jul 2 18:09:51 2015 UTC,How is this even possible? OMG. I would be screaming to high hell at someone by now. You're a saint.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,3,Thu Jul 2 18:52:33 2015 UTC,"I am not sure. It may be because they are paper lab forms my midwife has to fill out as opposed to printed ones, or they've got my hospital index number wrong or.. Who knows! Midwife is ringing them today to hunt them down. Thankfully I have only had a tiny bit of spotting once since Monday, so I'm not feeling as worked up as I was before. But very frustrating none the less!"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,dancer331,6,Thu Jul 2 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"Had an awesome morning - did some shopping with /u/GrammaMo and her awesome baby M, and then baby and I each had an eye appointment - everything looks great, and our eye doctor is AWESOME with babies.  Heading to the gym soon and then a phone call with BIL's (ex) gf... I'm looking forward to talking to her - I'm pretty sure she just needs a sympathetic ear."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,lancealittle,2,Thu Jul 2 18:23:17 2015 UTC,How do they check a 6-month-old's eyes? Curious minds would like to know.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jul 2 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"Not the OP, but my pediatric ophthalmologist dilated my 1.5 month old's eyes and then used a prism to look at his eyes. I don't know exactly what he was doing but he was able to declare that my son's eyesight was 20/20 despite the lazy eyelid that he inherited from me.  The doctor that I went to wrote a book on pediatric ophthalmology.  I'm headed back there next month to have my toddler and newborn's eyes checked out."

He looked in his eyes with a red light, and then checked to see that Isaac could look around and keep track of him (Sheldon moved from side to side watched to make sure Isaac was tracking him) and looked at his eyes with a light through a series of prisms (? I think). It was similar to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4wm_EX2Gbo."

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"YES! She'll be like a fancy English lady! That's awesome. Also, Isaac's eye exam was covered by OHIP and totally non invasive, so if you or your husband were heading in anyways and inclined to bring her with, it might be worth asking your eye dr about!"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,apanda1084,6,Thu Jul 2 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"Just had our first ultrasound and found out we have twins. I'm so in shock and don't really know what to think. I know we're not in the clear yet since we're still early on. I feel like we've been in the minority the whole way. Infertility-minority, unexplained-minority, failed IVF-minority, twins from a 2 embryo FET-minority. I'm angry that this happened when I wanted one transferred and they thawed 2 so we ended up going with it. But I'm also super excited to be pregnant and know that we didn't lose either of them. I know I'll be so happy when I meet them but I'm a very practical person and am already worrying about things like getting a new house, paying for tuition and basically everything double at the same time, and them being born close to christmas which is a lot of presents in a short timeframe. It's stupid and once I get passed all that I know it will be great, but sort of just in shock I guess. Also figuring I'm gonna get huge now!"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 2 21:28:07 2015 UTC,Congrats!
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,apanda1084,2,Thu Jul 2 21:43:08 2015 UTC,"Wow! Congrats! I'm sorry you're feeling overwhelmed, though. I bet some of the other twin parents on here will be really helpful as you sort through the anxiety and frustration."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 2 22:51:07 2015 UTC,I know twins seem overwhelming because to be honest they are. However they are also amazing! When we found out we were having twins we just didn't speak about it for like a week. There are so many what ifs and uncertainty.  You don't need to figure out everything right this minute. You will make it work. Just getting to this point shows you are a strong person and that strength will help once your babies are here. There is a great subreddit [/r/parentsofmultiples ] and look into joining your local Moms of Multiples group for support and advice. We are only 6 months in but I couldn't imagine not having both of my girls. Our girls were born on December 28th so I feel you on the Christmas/Birthday thing but we are just going to do the best we can. Let me know if you need to talk and congratulations! FWIW I gained less then 30 lbs with them so you may not be huge after all.

L started giggling too, it is the best sound ever.   Question time. How do you all unwind at the end of the day? I think I pinpointed my reason for not being able to fall asleep. I can't unwind. Normally, say with my job, there is a quitting time - but with a kid, there is no mommy shut off, I am and always will be mom. The last week he has been fussy before sleep, so there is no light drift off like there was before, so I am completely on edge even past time his eyes shut because he's been waking a bit more. Sorry this got rambly, but I need sleep!"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,apanda1084,5,Thu Jul 2 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"No joke, get a coloring book and some colored pencils or markers.  They make books aimed at grown ups and it seriously so satisfying. I find its a great way to get your brain to slow down."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,healthylurker,4,Thu Jul 2 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"That could be fun! Between that and trying to read before sleep, I think I found my main issue.

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 2 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"Does reading help? I find that if I stay in front of a screen, I stay awake. But reading a paper book helps me unwind and allows my body to recognize that ""hey, I'm tired"". Not sure that that would help with the ""always on call"" feeling though. :/"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,spankyjubblies,2,Thu Jul 2 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing or not. I have been just laying in bed awake a lot. I need to remember to take something on my ""off night"" (we alternate nights), but that really isn't a solution and I hate taking anything."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 2 15:26:57 2015 UTC,Oh yuk. That would be really frustrating! Have you talked to anyone? I know anxiety can affect sleep patterns.

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,septicidal,2,Thu Jul 2 17:04:12 2015 UTC,I unwind by doing about 20-30 minutes of yoga and then reading or knitting for about another 20-30 minutes. Or some nights lately I've been getting a glass of wine and then soaking in a bubble bath.
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 2 20:31:55 2015 UTC,"I read a book in the bath.  It distracts me from the regular thoughts and it's gotten to the point where I just don't feel right going to bed without my bath (and I swear my eyes are droopy afterward, guess I've trained my body well).  My other go-to unwind is a glass of wine or two while watching TV...pretty typical.  But, I'm definitely a person who needs an evening routine."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jul 2 22:54:49 2015 UTC,So basically I need to pick up my book hobby again. I can deal with that.   ETA: I'm also a super routine person.

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,jaina_jade,4,Thu Jul 2 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"Yesterday marked 3 weeks of bed rest. It was also the first day that was really difficult. Generally I share pretty well, if someone is in a common area of house and uses something, that's fine. They put it back in the wrong spot, also totally fine. But yesterday my mom started work sewing curtains for the nursery which meant she was in my craft room and it was making me horribly anxious. Someone! Touching my stuff! Moving it all around! Putting it back who knows where! I feel bad, it's super sweet of her to be making the curtains at all and it's not like she can help needing a sewing machine or a pair of scissors. I'm just surprised by how strongly it affected me. Apparently I am a wee bit territorial."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,PrincessCBHammock,6,Thu Jul 2 15:14:40 2015 UTC,Oh God I hate people all up in my stuff. Just. Stay out of my kitchen. And my office. And no you can't borrow my movies or books! Get your own copies!

I know it's largely irrational (what is he going to do, download my music that he doesn't like and therefore doesn't already have on his computer?) but I think it's a somewhat normal-ish thing."

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,4,Thu Jul 2 15:40:18 2015 UTC,as long as the baby cooperates :-D Mine was to take 15 minutes and wound up closer to an hour as baby kept wiggling/flipping/stretching.  Hoping it will be a little more cooperative during our anatomy scan on Tuesday
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,cakegroove,3,Thu Jul 2 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"Ya seriously, NT scan with the boys took almost 2 hours. They had me dancing and coughing and jumping. This one was like 5 minutes, the baby has so much room for activities!"

And was also uncooperative during the anatomy scan last week!  Hopefully you will have better luck there. My little most-likely-miss decided keeping their legs tightly clamped together was just the best thing ever and refused to give us a good enough look to confirm.  All of the other views - heart, brain, kidneys, spine, etc. all looked good/normal, but the OB ordered an additional ultrasound to attempt to confirm sex and recheck one or two other views just because the positioning was non-ideal."

InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,talula79,3,Thu Jul 2 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"I am so, so glad tomorrow is a work holiday!  I barely slept last night - I stayed up too late trying to finish a knitting project (ALMOST done) and then could not get comfortable enough to sleep until after 2am.  It did not help that my cat has decided it's just lovely to sleep on my already overheated feet in this hot weather... normally I love having him sleep on/by my feet (I can feel him purr through the covers, it's adorable!) but my hands and feet are constantly hot these days and even with the AC blasting it was just not okay.  But he came right back if I kicked him off the bed, he was really set on sleeping with me.  On the good news front of things - we found people to take some of the stuff we're clearing out of our basement! My husband found a buyer for the bumper pool/game table that's been awkwardly occupying a section of our basement for 4 years, and a friend is taking the baker's rack that has been sitting down there for ages."
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,3,Thu Jul 2 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"Last night I slept without waking every two hours to pee.  The trick was I had to limit my water intake at night, which of course was obvious but surprisingly hard for me!  It's been one week since my last appointment and I'm already nervous that something has happened.  Why can't I relax??"
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,female_engineer_here,3,Thu Jul 2 17:25:15 2015 UTC,More to the SIL story:  MIL told me last night that the baby's head is measuring small and they saw a shadow on it's lung during Monday's scan.  I would really like to be supportive but I can't because we're not supposed to know she even had a scan! We all see each other every single freaking day. It's not like we're the family that only sees each other on holidays. We all live within a quarter mile radius of each other and see each other EVERY DAY!  Ugh........  I feel bad they're having anxiety right now even though I'm furious they lied
InfertilityBabies,3bvgxi,pamplemousse2,3,Thu Jul 2 17:31:38 2015 UTC,"Well, and that your MIL shared information that she was, in theory, supposed to keep to herself. It puts YOU in a really awful situation. Everyone gets to set their own boundaries on the information they want to share about their pregnancy - but I agree that your SIL didn't manage to do that very gracefully."
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,Semirelatednonsense,5,Thu Jul 2 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"73 is very good for only 11dpo! Even at 15dpo that would be a positive result. It's all about how the number progresses so I am assuming you are going back for more tests.   Cramping is also ""normal"", I had a lot early on. As long as it isn't accompanied by blood then you don't need to worry (well if it extreme, like perhaps appendicitis extreme, go see a doctor).   So congrats and welcome! You will notice that worry is a constant here. Post-infertility it is impossible not to worry. I still have moments at 19 weeks where I feel like this is all so surreal as at a certain point through the process I mentally gave up and thought it would never happen. But then I feel some gentle kicks and I feel so blessed. You will get there... But the worry doesn't disappear completely."
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,revangelfire,2,Thu Jul 2 13:02:40 2015 UTC,There's just years and years of hearing pcos is going to make it impossible to get pregnant and that when I do I'll probably miscarry. I'm just so surprised that the meds even worked and I'm convinced it will all go wrong! Because story of my life... haha. The pain certainly isn't appendicitis bad. Right now they're very minor and may occasionally radiate through my thighs but nothing that's going to knock me on my ass. No bleeding. Just scared and I probably won't believe it's real until I'm giving birth!
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,digitabulist,3,Thu Jul 2 13:08:59 2015 UTC,Are you on Metformin for your PCOS? That is supposed to help with the miscarriage risk as well.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,digitabulist,3,Thu Jul 2 15:52:07 2015 UTC,Yes I am. I was never technically insulin resistant but my fasting glucose always sat at the high side of normal. I'm on 1000mg XR a day. Last time I had my hormones checked everything was normal other than my fsh:lh ratio and DHEA being a tiny bit high. So I'm hoping knowing I don't have mega insulin or testosterone problems I'm in a good spot to maintain this little pickle!
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,Pamzella,2,Thu Jul 2 15:57:36 2015 UTC,Good. Your RE should want to keep you on Metformin for the first trimester. You may be watched more closely for gestational diabetes given your high-side fasting glucose.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,Pamzella,2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:22 2015 UTC,Keep me posted on the metformin....  I have non PCOS insulin resistance and would so rather stay on the metformin and do sticks and all and just be sure.  My SIL stayed on it so I know it can be done.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,healthylurker,2,Fri Jul 3 00:17:57 2015 UTC,So far my doc has said nothing about me coming off of it so I assume I am to  continue taking it. As soon as I get my next hcg labs back and figure out when my appt will be I'll ask them about it!
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,justcurious12345,2,Fri Jul 3 00:53:36 2015 UTC,Many are taken off at 12 weeks.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,Hopecat,2,Fri Jul 3 00:55:41 2015 UTC,That's what I've heard. I wonder if there's a reason for coming off of it.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,ghoastie,3,Fri Jul 3 00:59:51 2015 UTC,"My beta was 58 or something like that around 11 DPO. Honestly, as long as initial hcg is above 20 and progesterone is over 15, you are good. They just need to see it double every 48 hours. That's what matters. Everyone is so different.. you can't really compare. Even progesterone can fluctuate a ton from hour to hour. Some clinics wont even keep track of it for that reason.   Cramping is also normal. I had a lot of sharp shooting pains and normal cramps as if my period were to arrive any second. It freaked me out but everything turned out okay (at least for now). At almost 17 weeks, I still say that.. the fear never goes away. Ugh.  I will keep my fingers crossed for you!! Keep us posted.. today you are pregnant :)"
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,effingeffstick,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:23:03 2015 UTC,The cramping is just so unnerving! I had them check my progesterone just because I literally have not had a single ovulation in over a year and I was afraid it may have been weak. Apparently it was not! I'm just in total shock.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,healthylurker,2,Thu Jul 2 14:20:53 2015 UTC,"So not only is your uterus stretching to make room for the embryo to grow, but also your ovaries are growing huge corpus luteums to make progesterone.  It can squish your bladder a little.  Plus, if you're at all constipated, that can cause some cramping :)"
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,MrsDragon,3,Thu Jul 2 17:49:54 2015 UTC,Welcome and congratulations! Check out http://www.betabase.info for beta number info and reassurance.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,digitabulist,3,Thu Jul 2 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"I also had MAJOR cramping and spotting throughout my first month or so.  But here we are at 23w2d, and baby is now kicking so hard I can see my belly move.  I know it's INCREDIBLY difficult, but try your best to stay calm. (I know, I know.  I rolled my eyes at that advice, too.)  Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,vibeee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:51:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! Just staying positive for the time being and trying to take care of myself. :)
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,female_engineer_here,2,Thu Jul 2 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"Welcome! 73 @ 11DPO sounds great to me.  IIRC, it doubles every 48 hours, right?  And, most places don't run the HCG test until 15 dpo, where they are looking for anything above 53 to call you pregnant.  You have a good progesterone number, too.  I won't tell you to just relax because I was afraid every single day of my pregnancy with my son.  I spotted, I cramped, I went to shitty ER where they told me I had a hematoma and would miscarry.  Fun times.  Anywho, congrats and keep us posted!"
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,razzertto,2,Thu Jul 2 12:49:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm trying to stay calm and busy but it's so difficult. I'm just convinced I'm not going to stay pregnant. I've probably taken 15 pregnancy tests just to make sure it's still there and I'm not insane. I need to stop! Ahh!
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,becabecaful,2,Thu Jul 2 13:19:06 2015 UTC,You sound like me :) I did that too! Try and enjoy a little bit.. i know it's tough!
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,becabecaful,2,Thu Jul 2 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"Welcome! That sense of surrealness lasted for a long time for me, Even at 20 weeks, I would almost forget I was pregnant because it didn't seem real. Once I could feel the Beans, and as my belly has gotten heavier to heave around, it's subsided some. I think worry is just part of having been through infertility. As /u/healthylurker said though, today you are pregnant!  Good luck! Keep us posted. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 2 15:18:14 2015 UTC,I had cramping around 5-10dpo that was more intense than my normal period cramps and it really had me believing IVF didn't work.  But here I am 21w1d! Hang in there and stay positive.
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 2 15:50:55 2015 UTC,Hello and welcome!  I wish you an uneventful pregnancy!
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 2 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"So, around that same time (it was between my betas) I had a cramp so severe I had to lie down still for about 10 minutes.  It scared me shitless and I really thought that was the end.  I""m now 16 weeks along.  I had a lot of short, period style cramps in the beginning but that one severe cramp was what had me worried.  I think sometimes it's just your body adjusting!"
InfertilityBabies,3bv3t2,WhateverYouSay1084,3,Thu Jul 2 22:49:09 2015 UTC,"They've really been on and off all day. Worse when I need to pee or I'm standing. The last hour they've been a bit painful and it hurts to keep my muscles pulled in on my stomach.  Like it seriously feels like I have a big blob squishing around in there. I guess I'm just worried because severe pain is so subjective. Before this, I hadn't had a natural period since I was 14 years old. All of my bc or progesterone induced periods were cake walks. So maybe what most people would consider mild cramps I'm just a weenie over because I haven't experienced any in years? I don't know. I'll hear about my next beta by Monday (when I'll be relaxing happily on a Jamaican beach) and hopefully the numbers are still good. It'll make me worry a lot less!"

Freelance was getting thin and his biggest client is traveling and conveniently forgetting to pay. Things were getting stressful for us and we were both looking for work but this job has come just in the nick of time! It's more money than he was making before so I'll get to keep staying home with S until after she's 2 like we intended. So thankful!!    In baby related stuff, we went to the children's museum and had a blast. S is finally at an age where she's really blossoming her personality and it's so interesting to see. Another kid came up to where S was playing and pointed to a chicken while saying duck. S giggled while she wagged her finger and goes ""nooooo... Ticken."" Ha!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,3,Wed Jul 1 14:32:04 2015 UTC,That IS wonderful! Congrats Mr. Tea!! I'm so glad you get to stay home with S. I know you were disappointed at the thought of giving up time with her.

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,2,Wed Jul 1 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! I'm so thankful and the timing is such a blessing. It's been terribly stressful worrying about finances but our reserves and his freelance work was just enough to get us through. And the silver lining was that he got to be part of so many milestones while he was home. Her first steps, her first potty success, the first time she outright told me no, etc etc. Facing this situation has brought our family together and now the tide is changing. Very grateful!"

It's all so amazing and overwhelming at times.  I hadn't really had the pregnancy exhaustion in the beginning but I'm more then making up for that now.  I had to take a nap at my desk and when I got home from work yesterday.  Soooooo.... sleeeeeepy...."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,razzertto,2,Wed Jul 1 13:25:11 2015 UTC,25 weeks! Congrats! I'd go through spells where I would be very tired too. I always thought maybe the baby was having a growth spurt during those times.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,cakegroove,5,Wed Jul 1 13:27:48 2015 UTC,"We are supposed to be traveling in eight days and I am freaking the fuck out. Where is she going to sleep? What clothes should I bring for her? Bring her car seat or buy a special one for travel? Bring a stroller or not? How are we going to bathe her on the trip?   Holy fuck, we should never leave the state."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,razzertto,2,Wed Jul 1 14:03:33 2015 UTC,"If you are staying at a hotel, when we have traveled in the past, I have packed a big box of stuff and had it shipped to the hotel for us to pick up at our arrival, which included an inflatable tub. are you flying? we have gate checked our stroller and checked the carseat/base before. It's tough to travel with a new little one, you really do take every single thing with you. take a backpack full of just what you'll need until you get to your destination. pack the rest of it in a box and ship it."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:30:47 2015 UTC,"People have horror storied me on the gate checking the car seat thing, so I don't want to bring our nice, expensive one on the flight.   I can't really ship stuff to this cabin, it's too remote."

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,razzertto,2,Wed Jul 1 15:24:59 2015 UTC,"Where are you going, for how long, and how are you traveling? Are you staying in a hotel or with someone? I have a little bit of baby travel experience so let me know a little bit more about your plans and maybe I can help!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,Zoraptera,2,Wed Jul 1 14:31:33 2015 UTC,We are staying in a cabin with limited amenities (we have to bring our own towels). We are flying and we will be gone for 6 days.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,3,Wed Jul 1 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with /u/Rositayoubitch on the bath business. If there's a tub you can bathe with her which I've done when traveling or if you feel she's too little you can get one of these. We have this one and it's super easy to use and dry. Back when Mr Tea traveled with his last job, we'd come with and this was nice and easy to pack because it flattens. We also kept it at my mom's house for when we'd spend days there because it was so easy to store."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,razzertto,2,Wed Jul 1 19:50:36 2015 UTC,Do you know if there is a bathtub where you're staying? You could get in and bathe with her. You'd be in there to support her and that would negate the beed for a tub. Just take her soap with you. I bought a gatecheck bag off Amazon and it protected our seat pretty well. I second Kat with taking the stroller and seat through security. Its so nice to have them handy. The wrap is great in the airport too though. Nursing during ascent and descent helps with the pressure in their ears. I'd also use a backpack as my diaper bag if I fly again. The shoulder bag was a pain in the ass bit kept bumping into things. Plus it was stuffed full. A backpack would be nicer.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"We just got back from a weekend trip to Canada, and things worked out a lot better than we'd hoped. We brought Zed's usual car seat, we brought a pack 'n' play and regretted it (big and awkward and heavy AND it was a mini one which it turned out he'd outgrown), but the hotel crib was unusable because I was too short to reach into it. We don't do strollers since we babywear... if we didn't, we would have brought one for sure. Sponge baths maybe?  One thing is for sure: I will never ever travel without a Boppy. Words cannot express how useful that thing is.  ::hugs!::"

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,revangelfire,2,Wed Jul 1 17:23:00 2015 UTC,"Whoa! You should breathe for a minute and try and clear your head. I freaked before traveling but it was much easier than I thought. We brought our stroller and car seat and gate checked them. They were super helpful and even though I wore her in the airport, we stuck the car seat and stuff in the stroller to help push stuff through the airport. He pushed most of the stuff in the stroller and then I pushed one rolling carry on while wearing baby. It was perfect! You can do this!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jul 1 15:00:54 2015 UTC,Did you bring your regular stroller or a cheap one you bought just for the trip?
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,revangelfire,2,Wed Jul 1 15:12:01 2015 UTC,We brought our regular stroller. It folds easily and is pretty lightweight (britax b agile). It worked perfectly for us and the gate check was easy as pie.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,revangelfire,2,Wed Jul 1 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"We have the b-agile too, I'm just worried about it getting beaten up by the airline."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,DisembodiedJen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"They really took care of ours. The gate check folks were really nice and when we disembarked, they brought it right to us. We flew JetBlue and always have the best experience with them. In fact, there were 3 other babies on the plane so as they brought out strollers and car seats to us, someone had left a baby hat in theirs that had fallen out. They were even nice enough to bring the hat and ask us which baby it belonged to."

I think I was a bit crazy when I decided to go to school part time to get a degree (I already have a diploma) when I am also working full time and going through infertility and now pregnancy. Anywho, today is a day off and a day to get caught up. Tomorrow is our anatomy scan and I cant wait to see baby boy again.

So I'm sitting at 40+6 waiting for this little boy to make some sort of indication that he wants to come out. OB says we wait and see, and that we'd talk about induction/c-section on Tuesday. He's guessing that there will be a 95% chance that the baby will be born before then. Going in on Friday for another NST. Why do I have this feeling that I'll need to be induced?"

My husband's aunts will be taking us out to lunch, I have no idea how this will work out.  Fortunately I pumped enough milk before so I don't have to feed her in public (I'm not quite ready for that yet) but I'm scared of her being a raging crazy girl in a restaurant.  Especially since she was so good yesterday, I feel like she's just full of pent-up screaming.  Fortunately, its not a Saturday night, so at least I won't be stirring up too much trouble.    I also managed to get my eyebrows and upper lip threaded and my armpits waxed the other day, so I no longer look like a man :). I can't wait to get a bikini wax!"

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,turtle1111,3,Wed Jul 1 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"So I have a question for those who delivered...  I am 31w1d today.  The past 3-4 days I have been feeling crampy.  Not all the time but at least 3-6 hours a day I have been having mild to medium cramps.  My belly feels sore, mostly the pelvic floor.  Yesterday I started feelign like somebody kicked me in the belly 50 times.  So sore. Then I started having those shooting, burning pains going down on both sides of cervix.  And on top of it I felt like I am about to have bowel movement but that pain was concentrated in the the belly region not in the back.   I had some contractions but they were not very distinct.  I thought they were just BH on top of everything else that was happening but those shooting pains down my cervix also felt like they came and went.  Could it be signs of early labor?  All of it went away after about 2.5-3 hours.  I was getting ready in my mind to go to L&D but it just subsided.   I guess I just want to know if this is what the early labor sounds like?  All of it was definitely more painful than regular BH which just tighten my belly.  If it happens again I will definitely call my doctor.  I just want to get an idea of what I'm dealing with.  I am not ready for my boy to arrive yet."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 15:04:29 2015 UTC,The cervical pains and feeling like you need to poop concern me the most. Labor can feel like constipation/cramps. We had a mom recently that delivered prematurely in an ambulance after being in labor all day but she just thought she was constipated and was taking laxatives and such. Glad you're going to call your ob if it happens again (hope it doesn't)!
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,turtle1111,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:39:08 2015 UTC,That's my biggest fear. Missing it or not recognizing it. I am a bit stubborn and don't like drawing attention of others if not necessary.  That's just how I am.  I hope it was one time episode but overall my body was going through a shift the past few days so something is definitely happening.    I will call if it happens again.  You kind of scared me... in a good way!
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:44:56 2015 UTC,I didn't experience early labor only had Braxton hicks before my water broke. I hope that someone can help you here.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,pamplemousse2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't delivered yet, so I don't know what real labor is like. But I felt like I was almost going into labor at 31w3d (contractions lasting a minute every four minutes for over an hour). It was really scary! I called the on call doc and she said to try a bath. I think it helped (I couldn't feel the contractions as strongly), and about 3 hours later they were only every 20 minutes or so.   Anyway, just wanted to tell my story because I was super worried about it, but here I am 3 weeks later and it hasn't happened again and my cervix is still high and closed (although the doctors seem to want to check it all the time, oh the pain!).  Thinking good thoughts for you!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 15:39:08 2015 UTC,"I ended up laying down and putting a wet, cold towel on my belly and it helped after a while.  It was also a very hot day here yesterday and I live at high elevation.  Sounds like we went through the similar ordeal.  I'm glad it subsided.  I know the baby would be fine.  I just don't want any NICU time if I can avoid it."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,pamplemousse2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:43:19 2015 UTC,"Totally! And my doctor's office said to be very proactive about calling in if it didn't subside so they could give me steroid shots, try to hold off labor a bit (which they do until 34 weeks at my clinic)."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"If is happens again I will definitely call my OB. I just wanted to know if that' what early labor feels like.    I had tons of BH since 20-22 week, sometime as frequent as 2-3 min apart for 1-2 hours.  What happened yesterday felt different."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jul 1 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"My OB said that anything that feels out of the ordinary or is concerning is a good enough reason to call.  They would rather get 10 phone calls about nothing than not get 1 phone call about a real problem.  Hopefully your doctor's office feels the same way - mine has a 24-hour on call service, it goes to whoever is on duty in labor and delivery so the responses are pretty prompt and you're not disturbing anyone from their sleep or anything like that.  I've called about a couple weird things that happened after hours and they were super nice and reassuring."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,Hopecat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:38 2015 UTC,I know I'm terrible about it.  I don't want to have them make me go in if there is a chance I can wait it out.  My biggest problem is that I have a really high pain tolerance so I don't want to miss anything.  I will call next time it happens though.  I was a bit worried it can snowball into real labor and then there wouldn't be much they can do to stop it.   I know I should take it more seriously now.  I also try to play it done with my husband because I don't want him to worry.  I guess I'm doing myself a disservice by doing so.    I will call next time.  Especially if there is pain involved around cervix.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"The nicest thing about the on-call service with my OB has been that they have really talked things through with me to determine if I need to come in, so hopefully if it happens again you will have a similar experience - something like, ""try X, Y, and Z and if it continues or gets worse come in"".  And that way they can note that it's been happening so your regular OB can review it at your next appointment.  If you're worried about alarming your husband, you can just say you want to be cautious and were advised to call in if you experienced these symptoms. I think the idea of going to Labor & Delivery is very stressful but my OB has everyone go through Labor & Delivery after hours because the wait times will be shorter than an ER and that way, all of the test results and records are immediately in their systems for the regular OB to review.  If your OB's practice is similar, maybe talking about this beforehand with your husband would help relieve some of his anxiety if it happens again and you do have to go in.  Going to Labor & Delivery does not automatically mean you're actively in labor and having a baby right that second. Thinking about it... I should probably have this talk with my husband at some point, though they did review it a bit in the initial OB appointment when he was there.  Hopefully it's nothing and all will stay calm and uneventful for a good long while!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,Hopecat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"I am terrible about calling stuff in too! The two times I've called in it's because my husband made me (and I angry-cried about it/at him a bunch beforehand). But I do always feel better after I call. So I guess my tactic is to tell my husband about things and he's read the list of reasons to call in, so then he forces me to do it. I don't know if that will work for you, but I guess it's working ok for me so far. It's hard to change!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Thu Jul 2 01:45:16 2015 UTC,"It is hard to change.  I difnitely don't feel 100% today and I didn't call in again.  Back pain, 3-4 semi painful contractions per hour, weird soreness in the belly.  I told my husband that if I keep complaining an hour later to MAKE me call the doc.  I did lay down on my side and everything slowly subsided.  Next goal is to call tomorrow if the same thing happens.  I also asked my husband to MAKE me call tomorrow if there is a daily repeat pattern.  I really don't know why I don't want to call.  I guess I don't want to sit in triage for a couple of hours if it's something that will go away on it's own.  I had an appointment a week ago and I didn't have an infection, BP was fine.    But I will call tomorrow if this continues. I also wonder if it can have something to do with the baby dropping down and transition for future birth.  Yes, these habits are hard to change!  I'm glad you understand me!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,Hopecat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry you are still feeling crummy. Yeah, I don't know why I'm terrible about calling in as well. Whenever I'm actually in the doctor's office, I always want to talk to them about a billion different concerns and weird feelings I have. One thing I have noticed is that at least my doctors are super nice when you call in, so thats a plus. Argh, for me at least the last 10 weeks are seeming to be the hardest (pregnancy stress wise). I don't know why, I thought things would be easier by now. :)"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,bandgeek_foreves,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:50:14 2015 UTC,I'm not much help with early labor signs. The only thing I had happen before my water broke was I lost my mucus plug. No contractions beyond normal BH. Later in my pregnancy I did have aches in my pelvis though. I assume that was the baby dropping and my hips spreading. It probably started after 30 weeks so it sounds like your body is just prepping. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water and not overdoing it. I'm sure you've already slowed down but you may need to scale back even more. And definitely call the doctor if you're the slightest bit worried.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 15:58:47 2015 UTC,If it happens again I'll definitely call them.  I was a bit scary to feel that way at 31 weeks.  I am not ready!

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,septicidal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"Super frustrating. But yeah, you'll probably just have to listen to your body - definitely too soon! That baby needs to keep cooking."

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,razzertto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:27:24 2015 UTC,I am pretty much doing work and bedrest untill this thing blows over.  My body is going through a new phase and I really hope it is very temporary.  I just want thing to settle down for few more weeks.    I had 3-4 semi-painful contractions when I got back from work but they went away again.  I told myslef if they are here by 6pm I am going to call the doctor.  Of course things have settled down.  If I have any contractions tomorrow I am definitely going to call.  I don't like playing this game of not knowing what's going on.    Can you remind me why your son ended up in NICU at 37 weeks?
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,nucleusaccumbi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:35:05 2015 UTC,"Essentially it can be summed up as wimpy white boy syndrome. He had breathing issues complicated by it being a csection rather than vaginal birth (which can squeeze the fluid out of their lungs). Then he had bloodsugar issues so they put him on an IV, and then he was not gaining enough weight (born at 5lbs 3oz 18"" long) so they put him on a feeding tube, and he got jaundice.   He's fine now and outweighs his sister by a pound already but it was scary. You just want them to gestate as long as possible!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,DookieSandwich,2,Thu Jul 2 01:18:48 2015 UTC,I really want to avoid NICU but it's not always up to us.  I am taking it easy even though I have plenty of energy to do stuff.

Nicky is 4 days old and doing amazing. He is completely off all breathing help, and is starting to look so much more alert. He sleeps a lot, and has a feeding tube. He's having a hard time being interested in  breast feeding,which the nurses say is so normal for his age. Hopefully a few more days of growing and he will be ready to latch ! My milk started coming in today and we are up to about half breast milk, half formula for each feed, which I'm so happy about.   I've been staying at the nicu and haven't been able to get home to post any pictures (not sure how to do it on my iPad, as I have no idea what my imgur login is, lol). I am hoping to spend the night at home tomorrow for a little break and to recharge.   I've started feeling achy today and I'm worried about some infection in my stitches, so off to the ob tomorrow to get that checked.   That's all for now, I miss reading about your lives every day!"

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,nucleusaccumbi,3,Thu Jul 2 03:51:25 2015 UTC,"Hooray for baby almost-giggles!  I have a two-day work week this week because I took Monday and Tuesday off, and Friday is an observed holiday for the fourth of July.  So, that's pretty great.  I also finally allowed myself to buy something baby-related - I got a Superman onesie.  With a tiny cape.  It is amazing and adorable.  My husband and I both have childhood photos of us in Superman/Supergirl gear, so I really want a photo of our tiny person in something super-themed.  My nausea is still really awful.  I'm on Reglan now, which seems to be helping quite a bit, but about an hour or so after taking it I get ravenous, like I have never eaten before in my life.  Probably because I haven't been eating much at all thanks to the nausea.  Last night, after my pre-bedtime dose, I wound up getting up and making boxed mac and cheese at midnight.  I felt like a crazy person but I NEEDED that mac and cheese."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,3,Wed Jul 1 13:27:37 2015 UTC,I told myself no baby stuff (or maternity wear) until July 1 - so bring on the shopping!  First maternity item is going to be a nightgown and pretty sure the baby item will involve Star Wars or the Orioles.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,nucleusaccumbi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"I had to cave and buy a few maternity clothes a few weeks ago - some of my regular stuff fit, but was uncomfortable and looked awful.  I managed to find stuff that doesn't look obviously ""maternity"" (nothing clinging to the abdominal area) so people don't know until I've told them... It helps that I am tall and overweight to begin with, so I won't look obviously pregnant for a good long while.  The Liz Lange maternity stuff through Target has been consistently great, and I got some stuff for cheap through Old Navy as well."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,slumlord2001,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"I'm planning to check out Old Navy and Macy's, I did a bit of looking at Target and at least at my store they are heavy on pants which aren't my thing.  I tend to wear dresses that are either empire or shift style so most of them have continued to work out - only a few that are more skater/drop waist have been retired."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"I had to get everything online, the stores have ZERO selection of anything actually useful. I am also big on empire waist dresses, which have helped a bit but a few started looking really awkward in the past few weeks. I got three great maternity dresses that don't look maternity online at Target. Shipping and returns are free if you spend over $25, and you can do returns in store which I've done without issue in the past.  Being tall and plus-size, I learned a long time ago that I can virtually never buy clothes in stores.  In a way that makes things easier all around, I don't waste time traveling to stores that have nothing for me, and I've found which places have really good/easy returns.  Old Navy, Kohls, Land's End, and Target are pretty much my favorites in general.  I've looked at Old Navy, Kohl's, and Target in person and they all have zero selection in the store.  Kohl's has a ton of online maternity stuff but had literally two racks of mismatched, overpriced maternity things when I went there a few weeks ago.  I am planning to convert one of my pairs of dress pants to maternity by sewing in a panel, but I have to go thrift shopping to find a nice panel.  The ones you can buy through sewing supply places are supposedly crap, and it's cheaper to just thrift pants with the right size panel but wrong size everything else and repurpose it."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,Peachmaru,2,Wed Jul 1 19:28:53 2015 UTC,Yay for buying things. It's a huge step. My husband I bought our first things at the same time.

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,curiouslywanting,2,Wed Jul 1 13:37:33 2015 UTC,We also bought the superman and batman onsies with capes. I can't wait until they're big enough to wear newborn clothes!

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,slumlord2001,3,Wed Jul 1 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"baby sleep question: we started sleep training our 9-month old a week and a half ago. She went from bed-sharing and nursing all night long to sleeping through the night in her crib surprisingly easily. We have a bedtime routine- dinner, bath, pajamas, brush teeth, quiet play, read/nurse, place in crib when she's visibly sleepy but not asleep. The problem is she cries hard when we place her in her crib. The second I put her in there she stands up and cries. It only lasts between 2 and 5 minutes before she calms down and falls asleep, but I feel bad about even that relatively small amount of crying. Is it normal for her to hate being put down so much? Anything I can do?"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,nucleusaccumbi,3,Wed Jul 1 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"I used to be in the no crying at all camp.  Then we had some serious sleep issues around 11 months and my doctor suggested we let her cry it out.  She told me to listen to the crying.  If it's nonstop, continuous crying with no lulls or pauses, she's in distress or pain and I should go to her.  But if there are pauses in the crying, if it kind of builds then stops for a second before she starts again, she's ok and I should let her cry. In the beginning she went longer than 5 minutes (with checks at the regular intervals).  That only lasted about a week, now we put her in drowsy and she doesn't cry.  As much as I used to be against CIO, it ended up working for my kid.  She sleeps great now."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,ktbell,2,Wed Jul 1 15:07:02 2015 UTC,"very good to hear. I can tell her cry is definitely in the non-distressed, just annoyed and sad category. Last night it lasted only 2 minutes. I'm hoping soon she'll be feeling more OK."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jul 1 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to handle that cry, hence we co-sleep. sorry I can't be of any help"

I still bring her into the bed when she wakes up in the morning to nurse and cuddle. I miss cosleeping, but I like the thought of getting her a sibling more (trying to get my period back!)"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jul 1 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not at this point in parenthood yet but based on what I observed with my best friend, this seems normal. Her kids would lay down and cry for just a little bit and then pass right out. It happened when mom/dad put them down and it was pretty much the same when I put them to bed when I babysat. Definitely listen to the other pros around here though too."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,septicidal,2,Wed Jul 1 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"thank you- it's good to hear it's probably normal, but I am realllly looking forward to the day she can fall asleep more peacefully."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jul 1 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"We have a special lovey for when we put her down after we give kisses and hugs. So when she lies down we hand her hello kitty and she hugs it, we cover her with the blanket and turn on rain sounds. She now happily lies there and falls asleep on her own."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,AwkwardOrangeHippo,2,Wed Jul 1 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"we use a lovey too but so far she has made zero connection with it! I try to introduce it into our cuddle time, and she used it when we coslept, but when it's in her crib she completely ignores it. When did yours start being interested in it?"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"We got the baby a big stuffed dog from Ikea (way bigger than the recommended size for sleeping in the crib of course) that she bonded with instantly at around 9 months old. When I put her down to bed, she immediately turns on her side and gazes lovingly into the stuffed dog's eyes.   BUT that's only if I hit the sweet spot of sleepiness perfectly. If she's too awake or too sleepy, she'll often cry for 10 seconds or so."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,pamplemousse2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"She's always had loveys for different things. Diaper changes, car rides, etc. This new one for bed only started very recently since we've always co-slept. Initially when we transitioned to her sleeping alone, only the first night was a fussy one. Always the same routine and it just worked (bath, nurse, kisses, lay down, dark room and rain sounds) but recently she's learned how to say no. It was awful putting her down while she clung to me saying ""no no no... Please mama!"" So on a whim, I offered her stuffed hello kitty that she recently fell in love with. I gave tight hugs and extra kisses and signed sleep. She signed sleep back to me so I laid her down and she went to sleep. Maybe it was a comfort thing? No idea... But the signing is really reassuring because she's telling me she's ready to lie down and it helps me feel better about it, I guess."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,GrammaMo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:56:38 2015 UTC,My son didn't care for any kind of lovey until like 15 months. And then it was Elmo. But there are still nights he'll stand up and cry. Usually because I only read him 5 books instead of all the books.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 16:13:06 2015 UTC,A little bit of crying is normal. Some babies need it to release any tension or stress before settling down.  My toddler still does this once in a while and he's developing well.

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"We sleep-trained around 6 weeks ago, and the baby only cries occasionally for 10 seconds or so when I put her down. I think it took us a little while to get to that point, but she's mostly been pretty agreeable with the whole process. A week in, it seems reasonable to expect a little protest crying though.  Also, are you still nursing her when she wakes up at night? One of the problems we ran into with sleep training (started at 10 months old) was that the baby got confused (or maybe she knew exactly what she was doing) by me going in to feed her at night. She would go down just fine but then wake up and cry for a while after just an hour or two, so definitely not hungry. I solved that problem by doing dream feeds instead of going to her when she cries.   She was 10 months old, so the goal was to get down to one night feed. We started with three (12:00, 2:00, 4:30) because that's how often she was eating at night. I would set an alarm and get up and feed her, but I wouldn't go in if she cried. Then over the course of a couple of weeks, I gradually worked it down to just one 3:00 dream feed (and that's more for my milk supply than for the baby). She's been doing great with just the one night feed. She sleeps so much better at night, and she's happier and less moody during the day too."

She has been sleeping through the night from 7:30pm until 5am with no awakenings/crying. At 5am she wakes up and I bring her into the bed to nurse and cuddle. I'm reallllly hoping that the crying levels off- even just that couple of minutes feels too long now."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:03:46 2015 UTC,"My girl does the cry for 2-5 minutes about half the time, and it used to be almost every time. She's 17 months and it's been going on since she we sleep trained around 10 months. She just has to let off steam. Now she sleeps 12 hours at night, will tell me ""night night"" when I lay her down with her lovey, and still will fuss for a minute or two.   Some babies cry. But if you're super worried you can always go back in there."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,cakegroove,3,Thu Jul 2 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"Awww, that all sounds so happy! Hurrah for the unpacking!   Today is day 4 of my mom being in town and we're muddling along. I've realized that part of the reason I was anxious about the visit is because she can't stop mom-ming while being a guest. (Which is especially special since I'm on bed rest and can't really ""host"".) For example, yesterday she was running errands for us and came home having bought laundry detergent (which we had plenty of), fabric softener (which we don't use), and a giant bottle of clorox stain remover (which we also don't use). I mean, she'll be here two weeks, if she wants something special to use to wash her clothes, she is more than welcome to buy it and use it, but WTH are we going to do with these giant bottles after she leaves?   Then this morning she asks me if I know anyone who uses a cleaning service. I say yes and she says that she'd like me to get recommendations because she wants to pay to have someone clean our house--because our house really needs it. It's dirtier than she thinks she has time to clean while she is here. THEN she tells me we need to pay for a cleaning service, at least monthly, especially once the babies get here because you can't have mobile babies and a dirty house.  Uh, thanks? I know she means well but yikes. There was just so much wrong with that conversation."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,2,Wed Jul 1 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"Ooof. I'm sorry the visit with your mom hasn't been ideal.  As for a cleaning service... I would just be a bit confrontational and tell her that this is your house and your children, and you will take care of them as you see fit.  If you want to be more polite, something like, ""that's an interesting suggestion, I don't think that will work for our budget but we will take it into consideration"" or ""well, it will be much easier for both of us to clean once I am not on strict bed rest"".  I constantly remind myself that good intentions do not completely excuse rude behavior.  You can phrase things in a much more pleasant, less judgmental way if being helpful is really the goal.  That aside, my husband and I started having a cleaning service come once a month back at the beginning of the year because we were both so busy and stressed out with work and infertility treatments.  And it has been glorious.  I don't think we can afford to keep doing it after we have the baby, but for now it has continued to be wonderful.  It really helps me to feel like my home environment is more under control, and it is delightful to take a bath in a tub that I didn't have to scrub first.  As for the giant bottles of stuff... If you know where she got them and they remain unopened, you should be able to return for store credit.  If they have been opened, you can see if there is a freecycle type list for your area and offer it up, or see if you have neighbors that could make use of them."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,cakegroove,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I will keep those in mind. I just sort of stammered something about not wanting to spend the money until we had our student loans paid off. (Which is the truth, I would LOVE to have a cleaning service, but ugh.)   I constantly remind myself that good intentions do not completely excuse rude behavior. You can phrase things in a much more pleasant, less judgmental way if being helpful is really the goal.   I need to work to remember/apply this. I feel bad getting snappy when I know she wasn't trying to be rude. But if I don't say anything, I just get more and more irritated. Blegh.  The freecycle idea is a great one! Hurrah for not having more crap cluttering up the house! :D  ETA: TBH today is just not a great day for these shenanigans. I'm tired and crabby and really feeling the part of bed rest where I have no idea what's going on in the rest of the house and I don't know where anything is and people keep asking me questions about how to find things and I find out that everything's been moved and nothing is where I left it...and crabby. And I'm dreading what I'm going to find when I come off bedrest. Maybe I'll get a pass to stand a little before delivery and I can pick up and organize a bit before the babies arrive. Otherwise, it'll be next year at least before I have my spaces back in order. Blah."

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,septicidal,3,Wed Jul 1 16:09:27 2015 UTC,Questions #2:  butter cream made out of raw cashews.  Has anybody tried making it?  Did ti taste good?  Is it east to decorate cupcakes with? How does it sustain the heat when served outside?  I am considering making my own cupcakes for my baby shower.  I know I can manage to bake the cupcakes themselves but I'm not sure what to do to icing.  I HATE store bought butter cream as it is the most processed nastiness you can buy.  I don't have to limit it to being vegan but it sounds healthy and good.   Any thoughts?

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,septicidal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm letting you guys down! I've never made a nut butter based frosting before. I better quickly link some recipes for /u/vibeee to earn my street cred back lol  If you want to avoid regular buttercream, then you could try a tofu or coconut butter based frosting instead?  Here's a recipe for tofu-based chocolate mousse frosting  Here's a recipe for homemade coconut butter (aka: just blend shredded coconut) and some FAQs on it.  Here's a coconut butter-based recipe.  Oh! And I just realized I lied, I have sorta made a nut-butter frosting, with macadamia nuts. If the cashew one is similar to this, it'll be delicious on cupcakes!"

Edit: Just realized the tofu mousse recipe has a recipe for cupcakes.
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,jaina_jade,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"I think that's the same recipe Sept recommend too, from Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World. It's my go-to for chocolate cupcakes. And for vanilla, I use the recipe from the same cookbook. Both are delicious and fail proof!  And if you make the mousse frosting, pipe the cupcakes and let the frosting set for a bit in the fridge they'll likely hold up pretty well in the heat, just leave them inside as long as possible and don't put them in direct sunlight."

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,handywife6,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"raw cashews, soaked overnight and blended...  Never tried it.  I wonder if it works/tastes good."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:07:53 2015 UTC,interesting! Let me know how it goes if you do it!
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like cashew butter? If so, it's the same consistency as something like peanut butter but tastes like concentrated cashews. I love cashews, but cashew butter is too cashew-y for me.   ETA: Unless the soaking changes something, it seems like it would be a little weird as a frosting, only because you would be expecting sweet and get salty. That said, I expect it could be super tasty on chocolate cupcakes. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:21:59 2015 UTC,It's something along the lines of the filling in this recipe.  http://www.contentednesscooking.com/sandwich-cookies-with-strawberry-cream/  I just don't know if it would work as frosting/butter cream replacement on cupcakes.  Then they would be almost guilt free!
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"Ooh, that makes sense. The moisture in the strawberries and the juice would help lighten/loosen up the mixture. I'm not sure about the strawberry/cashew flavor combination (one of those where you have to try it I think) but the texture looks dreamy. It certainly looks like it would work for frosting and be more stable to boot!"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"Raw, unsalted cashews actually taste quite different.  Roasting and salting them really changes the flavor.  Virtually all of the cashews you get in regular nut aisles have been roasted.  Soaked, raw cashews actually make some good nut milks and creams, and I've even known people to make vegan cheese from cashews that tastes pretty good."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"Oooh, that makes sense! I wasn't thinking about the roasting process. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:53:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't risk cashew frosting without extensive testing beforehand.  Every time I've tried to do stuff with cashews, it's turned out really weird.  I was vegan for a long time and the frosting recipes from Isa Chandra Moskowitz (Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, Veganomicon, etc.) are amazing and everyone I have served them to has loved them.  I've had very good experiences adapting this recipe to various flavors - cookies and cream, add crushed Oreos (which are dairy free!), for strawberry I boil down sliced fresh strawberries until syrup-like and strain, and add the resulting syrup a little bit at a time until the desired color and flavor is reached: http://www.chow.com/recipes/10856-vegan-fluffy-buttercream-frosting.  The vegan chocolate cupcake recipe linked in the frosting recipe is also one of my go-tos - it never fails me, and doesn't taste vegan at all.  So much easier than a lot of other cake recipes I've made.  I also really love the recipes in Sinfully Vegan, which is a cookbook entirely about vegan desserts.  The puddings and cheesecakes alone are worth the cost of the book.  I've made some of the puddings for my husband and he's enjoyed them, despite being in the firmly pro-dairy camp.  It also provides nutritional breakdowns for the recipes, which is really nice."
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:32:54 2015 UTC,This is great!  I will definitely give it a test run before the event.  I despise the store bought buttercream and refuse to serve it to my guests.  Thank you so much!  I'm excited about trying it out!

InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,cakegroove,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:29:07 2015 UTC,Thanks! It was a labor of love for sure lol. It was my first attempt at a frozen buttercream transfer for the image and I was so sad the whiskers broke off. But the frosting tasted delicious! I used vanilla bean paste (more true vanilla than extract) from the local bake supply shop. I loved how it gave those tiny black flecks of vanilla bean throughout the frosting. Can you tell I'm a cake nerd? :)
InfertilityBabies,3bqy32,septicidal,2,Thu Jul 2 01:06:07 2015 UTC,Nice!  I worked as a bakery manager for a couple of years at a fancy grocery store like whole foods.

I just have to find an easy recipe and master it.  I am not a good baker but I will give it a shot!
InfertilityBabies,3bob4k,Bibbityboo,4,Tue Jun 30 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness. I had a partial previa very early on, but it quickly ""moved"" away. But, as a recently pregnant woman, I think that all of your questions are completely reasonable and should be answered by a doctor. Don't feel bad for calling again- tell them what you've written here and that you're not sure if it's normal or what to expect. Ask what will be normal and what you should call about going forward. Ask if they will monitor you more closely because of the previa. Ask literally anything you can think of. I hope everything is ok!"
InfertilityBabies,3bob4k,ky_grown90,3,Tue Jun 30 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"I had complete previa diagnosed at 22 weeks, and it stayed. I had bleeding at 25 and 27 weeks that lasted 3 days the first time, an initial gush followed by less and less each day and I was monitored in the hospitsl for the 3 days. Once it was clearly lessening they let me go home. At 27 weeks I had lots of bleeding that slowly lessened and then I began to hemorrhage he next day in the hospital, probably an abruption. I delivered at 27+3 and my son is in the nicu now. That's pretty rare, but my point is, call your doctor. I was tols to expect spotting, but for a lot of bright bleeding I was told do not pass go, do not collect 200, call and then show up in labor and delivery and announce I have previa. I was put on pelvic rest, told not to exercise, snd put on couch potato rest. Get a second opinion if need be, i was referres to a high risk doctor ehen they noted the previa. Best wishes to you."
InfertilityBabies,3bob4k,IHaveAFunnyName,2,Wed Jul 1 05:35:14 2015 UTC,"Oh dear, I'm so sorry you have to deal with this.  I'm surprised they diagnosed you so early. I had spotting from 10 weeks on. I'd go in, they would check for a source of bleeding. But they would never check for my placenta in relation to my cervix. Too early, they would say. Even when they finally had to make a diagnosis at 19 weeks, all they would say to me is ""low lying"", and then they would describe a placenta previa situation but never actually using those words. When I talk to someone outside of my doctor's group though, after consulting my medical records, they will come out and say ""placenta previa"", so I'm not sure what the deal is. Maybe they just didn't want to freak me out? But the sense I get is that because most of the time it moves, doctors (or at least my doctors) want to wait until the third trimester to make a diagnosis.  But my official diagnosis is partial placenta previa. I have had a bleeding incident once every one to two weeks -- generally a small flow or gush of red blood that becomes brown within hours. I had a hemorrhage at 19 weeks that landed me in a hospital for observation for 5 days. The doctor says that it's unlikely I will have another one of those again. The amount of blood loss was so massive, I thought (and the ER doctors thought) I was miscarrying, so the placenta previa diagnosis was a relief. I immediately became anemic because of the loss of blood (not anemic enough for a blood transfusion), but the babies are totally fine from it. He gave me a 90% chance that my placenta will move up in time for delivery, but I'm skeptical, because I have had a number of issues leading up to this.  My doctors haven't prescribed bed rest for me yet, and I doubt they will unless I have a major event and am on the verge of preterm labor. They have asked me to reduce my activity -- no lifting my 3 year old son, no long walks. Reading online, it sounds like their reasoning is justified. There's no super strong evidence that bed rest actually benefits placenta previa, so they are trying to make the best decision possible (bed rest can lead to depression and isolation and muscle loss, so it's a matter of balancing benefits against costs for each patient). I'm 24 weeks now and still having bleeds. They told me that I do not need to inform them if they are short of ""soak a pad"" bleeding level, and it was only bad that one time where a pad would have not done anything. It's assumed I will spot and have light bleeds at this point.  I wouldn't worry about a hemorrhage event before the third trimester -- I couldn't find many online that experienced what I did so early on (I had a lot of time in the hospital to stew on what happened to me). I tend to always be on some medical edge case anyway (yay, infertility and other weird minor health issues). What you are explaining about the stringy bits are typical for me when the bleed is dying down. It sounds like what you are experiencing is perfectly normal for placenta previa.  A couple of weeks ago, I found this page: http://www.westsounddesign.com/clubhouse/members/  It's not updated, but it's a good collection of stories women have written about their experiences with placenta previa. If you'd like to get a good sample of what women experience with it, this is a good resource.  I hope this helps!"
InfertilityBabies,3bob4k,afikomeme,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"My SILs BFF did, complete previa, and bed rest and wheelchairs were prescribed for her when it was identified and she was spitting.  It did in fact clear up in the third trimester, she didn't go into labor with it, which I understand is not necessarily common.  It's probably not what you wanted to hear, but if it helps...."

My best guess was always a surge in hormones but I never really pressed the issue. As soon as one symptom ends I seem to get a new one. Currently it's heartburn and it's TERRIBLE. Still, I have to remind myself that I wouldn't trade this for anything :) But venting about it does help!!"
InfertilityBabies,3bp34e,TigFan15,2,Wed Jul 1 01:42:13 2015 UTC,yep - mine died down from wks 14-15 and then came back with a vengeance to the point that I almost wound up back in the hospital.  I'm now 18+4 and still vomiting (on average) four times a day.

To be honest about our bedtime routine, I'm too lazy to do something elaborate. I tried doing a nightly bath and such, but it just didn't happen. So, we do quick and easy.   His last nap of the day is usually around 6pm. The bedtime routine starts between 8:30 and 9:30, whenever he shows signs of being hungry/tired. He gets his diaper changed, I put him in his Halo Sleep Sack (totally changed our sleep game, he sleeps so much better and longer in that thing and his arms aren't even swaddled). Then I nurse/rock/sing until he's asleep and move him to the bassinet in the bedroom. I turn on white noise and let him be.   Sleep was going really well for us, like 7-9 hours that first stretch. We're having some hiccups now and are down to 2-3 hours at a time, but it's either the dreaded 4 month sleep regression or the insane heat we've been having."

I think it might be time to check with my doctor about it, but I feel kinda dumb about having to do that. I'm also kinda banged up from the fall, bruised knee and scraped shin and I'm embarrassed about that too. Ughh  In good news, I got a haircut today!! My hair was at the point where there was no way to style it to make it look good, so I'm really happy about the cut :)  I also picked up more hand-me-downs for M today. I'm pretty much not going to have to buy clothes for her for at least her first year!"
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,GrammaMo,3,Tue Jun 30 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"The first time we did an IUI, we collected the sample at home. I stuck it in between my boobs because it was freezing cold outside. I tripped on the porch stair on the way out to the car to deliver it to the doctor's office. Tore myself up good. I was so worried about losing/damaging the sample that I had no idea I even ripped my jeans and that my knee was bloody until I got to the doctor's office and someone asked me about it!

InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,GrammaMo,3,Tue Jun 30 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"Aww, hahaha. Too funny! And that's adorable that your husband tried to bring you ice cream! Mine is super sweet when I'm hurt or sick too."
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yay for haircut! Sorry about your wrist situation. Is it along the edge of your wrist by the thumb? If it is, I hate to break it to you but it might be what they call ""mother's wrist"" or more specifically De Quervain's tenosynovitis. I had it as well and it got pretty extensive because I thought it was silly and refused to bring it up to the Dr. My Dr noticed it at Tiny Tea's 6 month vaccinations and told me I should've said something sooner (also /u/HerVoiceEchoes urged me to say something and I should've listened.) Hopefully yours goes away on its own but if not, definitely say something. Mine ended up requiring a splint/brace and shots! Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,kat_loves_tea,2,Wed Jul 1 03:35:11 2015 UTC,"Ouch, did yours go away with the brace? I think you've further convinced me that I need to see the doctor about this. I'll have to make an appointment specifically for it, which still feels a little silly, but I'll do anyway."
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,GrammaMo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:13:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's all better now! I can't even remember the last time it hurt so it's definitely been a while. Definitely get it checked out. You could always wait and ask at your baby's next appointment if you feel silly making an appointment just for this though."

We set up a water table and kiddie pool in the yard for her even. She'll splash forever while I share snacks with her, soak my feet, and we watch Mr Tea prune trees or garden. Best family time ever!"

I was so excited to put the crib together...wait what no screws in the packaging??? Ugh...  Luckily MIL took care of it already - go Wayfair - and they are on their way!!!  I can't wait to start putting the room together and wash all of the baby clothes! I can't believe it's happening!

InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,SJP8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:55:11 2015 UTC,I would never spend that kind of money on a crib.  I was looking at $75 cribs on craigslist but my MIL got this one for use:  http://www.wayfair.com/Nursery-Smart-Oslo-Crib-NYT1068.html  There is also a slight chance that my husband threw the screw out with the box.  We'll never find out.  He has to take it apart to take the crib upstairs by himself so it might have gone missing then.  How are you doing?  How is being a mom?
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,vibeee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:01:28 2015 UTC,That must make it feel so real!  I can't wait til there is a crib in our house...

InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,pamplemousse2,3,Tue Jun 30 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"It was SO GREAT! It's at a local rec center. They have these awesome little floaty boats (made out of thick foam, like a Flutterboard) to put the babies in. Mine lasted about half the class, and then I held him. Probably about half the babies were out of the boats by the end of the class. It wasn't an intense workout, but we both had a blast. Can't wait for next week!"
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,GrammaMo,2,Tue Jun 30 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"I really hope I can find something like that near me! That sounds fantastic. I also would love to do baby yoga as well... Its wild how flexible we are as infants and then we become crampy, inflexible messes... :)"

InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,dancer331,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:06:42 2015 UTC,"You will be! Hey, it was a lot but just because I overstimulated. Of those we got 3 healthy lil embies! Its quality not quantity :)"
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,MrsDragon,3,Tue Jun 30 15:11:20 2015 UTC,Every day I'm just amazed at what science can do - this just feels so crazy sometimes - it's always interesting to hear what other people experienced and realize we are more similar than different
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,female_engineer_here,2,Tue Jun 30 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome and Congrats!!! So exciting! It def feels surreal, doesnt it? I dont think that ever goes away. At 16 weeks,  I still feel like it might be a cruel prank (even though theres no denying it - I have quite a bump and saw our beautiful baby at 12 weeks, heard heartbeat again last week). It just feels WEIRD to finally say... wow, we're pregnant! Try to enjoy this awesome time!"
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,cakegroove,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:09:25 2015 UTC,I didn't realize but my husband had no idea that today we'd hear the heartbeat... I was SO nervous up to this appointment but I guess he just thought I was regular ole me nervous. He told me he almost lost it when the heart beat came on!!! It was so wonderful... it gets more real everyday (especially when morning sickness kicks in... ha)
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"You should like me!  Also 16 weeks and I swear its still hard to believe.  I want to feel baby move, I'm hoping that will help me feel more secure in this pregnancy."

InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,MrsDragon,2,Tue Jun 30 15:16:10 2015 UTC,Congratulations! I think I'm pretty much the exact same time along as you but will find out on Thursday when I also have my heartbeat. Excited to go through this together.

InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,LowOnHope,2,Tue Jun 30 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"We had a regular OB appointment today and learned that at our next appointment I'll be getting my TDAP shot and doing the 1hr glucose test and bloodwork. I know everyone hates that test, but I'm so excited to have that appointment scheduled because it makes 28 weeks seem so close! (Currently 24 weeks) It's like they wouldn't bother scheduling the appointment if they didn't think I was going to make it that far, you know? So yay!   My doctor was also really encouraged to see that the bed rest was working so we had a little happy moment. Babies' heartbeats continue to be good. And yesterday someone kicked me so hard I actually jumped a little in surprise. Def building up some muscle there.  My mom's visit is going well so far. She's been doing a lot of running around/errand type stuff which is excellent. Though sometimes I wonder if she realizes she has a smart phone? She keeps asking me to look up addresses/phone numbers of places she needs to go and I'm like ""you have google, literally at your fingertips. You could have looked it up just as quickly as texting me..."" Ah well."
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,dutchqueen,2,Tue Jun 30 19:55:37 2015 UTC,My mom is the same way.  She cannot figure out how to use the GPS on her phone..despite the fact that I have showed her literally dozens of times.

InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,apanda1084,2,Tue Jun 30 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"Nuchal scan.  Used mostly for checking for chromosomal issues, like Down's Syndrome.  Edit: More info.  Usually done from 10-14 weeks."
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"I know, I totally could have googled but I felt like asking :) Ha! Thanks!"
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,Hopecat,2,Tue Jun 30 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"NT scan aka the most stressful thing EVER!   The scan is crucial because they look for markers that suggest chromosomal disorders like downs syndrome (they measure the back of neck for example). BUT then you usually have a blood test that you have to wait a lifetime for... they combine both the blood test and ultrasound results to come up with stats (ex: 1 in 10,000 chance of downs). It's just a screening, not a sure yes/no. But for me it gave me a lot of peace of mind. Plus one more chance to see your little baby :)"
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,SJP8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:45:59 2015 UTC,I'm wondering since I received chromosomal testing to my embryos if my risk is less/non-existent based on results?
InfertilityBabies,3bmlnn,razzertto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"Down's is chromosomal, so you should have zero risk if the PGS tested for it and was clear."

At 11am on a Tuesday. Because that is apparently a thing that happens. Waiting for a police officer to arrive to file a report before I clean it up. (My condo complex is back to back with low-income housing and we've had a long and storied history of issues with broken glass, rocks, etc. being thrown over the fence, the trustees advised calling the police to report incidents.)

InfertilityBabies,3bkurm,stoptheapartheid,5,Tue Jun 30 01:21:48 2015 UTC,"Is that Chelsea/Far West Side?  I have friends who have done something like that in their one bedroom on the UES and are managing ok.  I'm sure the people from the rest of the country/world shake their heads about these kinds of arrangements. Of course, you could always move out to the boroughs/Jersey and get a second bedroom for the same price you are paying (still too much though).  Good luck - plant to take lots of walks - but that's part of the fun in Manhattan."
InfertilityBabies,3bkurm,jos9143,3,Tue Jun 30 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, Chelsea. I grew up in a European capital city and never saw people live in a ""bedroom-per-person"" type housing arrangement until I moved to the States. We live on top of the High Line park and have a 550-acre park that runs all along the water one block away. I love the art galleries and museums... I think NYC is an awesome place to raise a family."

InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,DookieSandwich,5,Mon Jun 29 23:25:28 2015 UTC,I just want to respond to the part where you said that pregnancy has become really personal and you aren't shouting it from the roof tops because I so identify with that. I'm getting a lot of pressure to be more visibly excited and I'm about ready to stab my mil. I'm a reserved and private person at the best of times.  Now I'm just super cautious. Of course I'm excited but I'm excited my way v
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,Bibbityboo,2,Tue Jun 30 12:12:04 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I am also not a ""shout it from the rooftops"" person and ""exciting announcements"" like these always make me uncomfortable. I was excited to get engaged, but having to call all the far flung family/announce it at dinner/etc was AWFUL. I kinda wished we could just wake up and have everyone who needed to know, already know. For this pregnancy, once we were comfortable telling people, I sent out an email to all my coworkers. I think some people saw this as a bid for attention, but I just saw it as a way to have it over with quickly. It's so awkward. And then apparently I'm ""not excited enough"", such that I've had several people ask me if the pregnancy was planned. Which, I just....WHY would you ever ask that?! Let me have my quiet happiness! I know they don't know what we went through to get these babies, but I do, so please trust me when I say that we are excited.  ...and apparently I needed to rant about that.:P More on topic--I empathize! I'm sorry your MIL is pressuring you to behave differently because that sucks."
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:21:26 2015 UTC,"Rant away! Sounds like you and I are two very similar people, facing the same pressure! Mine happens to be my MIL but it sounds like you've got your pressure too!  I hate the attention and I just want to hug my belly and smile to myself, you know? I want to share in small groups, and not talk about it all the time beause I understand its not as big a deal to everyone not involved!"
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,Bibbityboo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, yea we're constantly being asked by family if we're going to post to Facebook. Honestly, I don't think I even want anything to do with Facebook. I've slowly told friends and family in person since those are really the only ones that I really care about.   I'd also rather keep a bunch of pictures of my son off from the internet. So that's going to be a fun conversation one day too! haha"
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,Bibbityboo,2,Tue Jun 30 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"If it was up to just me, I'd be a 0 facebook pressence. Im' trying to negotiate with my husband. We're private people for one, but I find it weird that our children get no choice in their privacy levels, I worry that I'll be raising a child who needs external validation for everything (i.e. likes and comments), and I also want an identity outside of being a mom. I mean, I can't wait to be a mom, but I also know that I will need my adult time, away from that! OH, throw in that half my friends are child free by choice OR dealing with infertility? Yeah, makes it seem like facebook isn't the best idea."
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,Hopecat,2,Tue Jun 30 20:29:08 2015 UTC,Oh god that'd drive me insane too - and yes she's probably just fishing. Good for you for keeping calm and not saying something you'd possibly regret later.
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jun 29 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"In high school, someone came up to me on a Monday morning and said something like ""I know what happened with [someone] at the party on Saturday."" and I said ""You know [whatever]???""  She had no idea what happened, but tricked me into spilling beans. (I don't remember the specifics anymore, because high school, but I DO remember her pulling this.)  Your Mom is totally doing exactly what this girl did, as you suspect. It's NOT nice of her to do this, even if it's ""just"" because she's excited. She knows you don't want to share, and she knows how to piss you off enough to get you to tell her just to get her to stop bugging you. That really sucks.   The good news is that this IS your news to share, and people WILL be excited for you when you decide to share with them. And if they'd withhold their love from you because you didn't include them in YOUR pregnancy on their timeline, then fuck them.  <3"

InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,effingeffstick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"Cryo-freeze, so I believe that means vitrification (flash frozen correct?)  I'm trying to find in his blog where he discusses euploidy, would you have a link?"
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,cakegroove,2,Tue Jun 30 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, flash frozen.  I think the survival rate goes from the 70's to 90's with the new freeze process.  It is not the same question he answered that I saw two years ago but here is a link where he is essentially saying the same thing about euploidy, embryo grading, and what most determines an embryo's competence: http://haveababy.com/fertility-information/ivf-authority/staggered-ivf-using-cgh-eggembryo I'm not sure what day(5 or 6) yours turned into blasts but a lot of labs will say anything turning into blasts after Day 5 is of lesser quality. Not true.  That is only because there is a small window of uterine receptivity.  When you time everything by FET that goes out the window.  My perfectly healthy son was a day 6 blast. Here's some research on this subject, too:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578475"
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,yearofthecat,2,Tue Jun 30 17:45:56 2015 UTC,I ditto your positive end note! I wish we could have a gathering!   I'm sorry your mom is over the top about things. Is this her first grandchild? Nobody really ever understands the sensitivity that goes along with all of our situations until they've stood in our shoes.
InfertilityBabies,3bkapg,Semirelatednonsense,2,Tue Jun 30 12:49:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, first grandchild. It's been a joy... My older sister (and oldest sibling) has severe cerebral palsy and seizures, you would think my mom WOULD understand after all that she's gone through. And honestly she's been great to talk to, I just hate how she can't stand not knowing every minute detail. It's all or nothing for this lady. I'm so close to just shutting her out, but she's my mom. It's just so hard with family."
InfertilityBabies,3bl3ji,traveler5678,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:34:20 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. Pump parts should be washed after every use (or kept in the fridge), and washed and sterilized every 24 hours. They're designed to withstand the process. Boiling is one way to sterilize, but we microwave. You can get pump part and bottle steamers. We use a steam bag for the pump parts, and use our dishwasher's sterilize setting for bottles and caps.  Tubing doesn't need to be sterilized because it doesn't come in contact with milk. Remember to take the membranes off of the valve when washing and sterilizing. (Membranes do need periodic replacing but should last at least 3 weeks!)"
InfertilityBabies,3bl3ji,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:20:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!  So for the first time use, do you take the membrane off and boil it separately?"

InfertilityBabies,3bl3ji,effingeffstick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:20:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice and cake day wishes!  I just looked up the steam sanitizers and they look really useful.  I may buy one of those for use once I have my baby because it looks like they would save a lot of time compared to boiling.

Just make sure the outfit offers some fabric where the car seat straps might touch their skin.    Bring a muslin blanket for sun cover in the car.  The baby won't need a blanket with warm weather.

InfertilityBabies,3bkveu,larabair,2,Tue Jun 30 13:17:27 2015 UTC,We brought our August baby home in a short sleeve onsie and blanket. It was over 90 when we were headed home so she was pretty toasty.
InfertilityBabies,3bkveu,Peachmaru,2,Tue Jun 30 12:36:53 2015 UTC,Thanks!  It's a little hard to predict what the weather will be since I'm fairly far north.  Hopefully not over 90!  I packed a short sleeve onesie as well as some pants and lightweight long sleeved pajamas.  I'm going to put in a lightweight blanket as well.  Luckily the clothes are so tiny they don't take up much room.
InfertilityBabies,3bkveu,apanda1084,2,Tue Jun 30 13:08:10 2015 UTC,"We have air conditioning in the car, so I would have probably chose the same thing regardless of season. It was 85 the day we took my son home and he wore a long sleeved pajama."

InfertilityBabies,3bjxfn,TigFan15,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:45:42 2015 UTC,"I just had to check your name again to make sure I wasn't reading a post I had written. I am also 3 years married, anniversary in August and 2 1/2 years trying. I ALSO had a fresh embryo transfer, eSET (just one) the day before you. I leave tomorrow for work and went in to the clinic to ask for a blood test today. Its positive, but I was told the hcg is very low and now I have to increase my progesterone (just a cream that is inserted vaginally) and retest at a clinic in Atlanta on Wednesday (the original day that I was supposed to blood test). I actually have to bring an injectable progesterone with me just in case. Trust me, I know how you are feeling, and probably the same down to the hour. I have taken 5 tests. Two digitals came back ""pregnant"" one digital came back ""not pregnant"" and who knows with the other two pee sticks - not much to see there at all, probably more negative than positive on those. Its certainly depressing. We even have a name for a boy, it just happened. We thought it, we loved it and now I am just struggling to hold on and not go crazy.   When is your blood test? Or beta, i think they call it. I don't stick around this sub too much cause it makes me depressed - so I havent learned all the acronyms.   What did you think of the chromosome testing? Worth it? Its so expensive. Was there a reason you wanted to evaluate? How are you feeling besides the shots and not eating? Also, you can take the shot in your thigh right? Might help for when you want to lay down - which I seem to be doing a lot of."
InfertilityBabies,3bjxfn,larabair,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"Test day is this Sunday - seems like an eternity. I didn't know about the thigh for shots, the nurse marked my hip area with a sharpie so I thought that was the only spot. It doesn't really bug me that much - I think I can tough it out for the next 8 weeks as long as we get a baby at the end!"
InfertilityBabies,3bjxfn,female_engineer_here,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:46:05 2015 UTC,Oh about the pgs test - we decided to spend the 6k on it because I only have one ovary and we weren't expecting to get many embryos. To have 5 to send to testing was a miracle for us. It was worth it to me to not have to worry about losing a baby due to genetic abnormalities - we really wanted to give ourselves the best possible odds and even though we paid for everything out of pocket this was worth it to me to not have to try multiple embryos - we were happy to transfer one and hope one day we can do the remaining three. I don't think we could afford a second egg retrieval cycle.

InfertilityBabies,3binu1,MsZuko,9,Mon Jun 29 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"I was at shady grove too. Fresh transfer failed so we decided to transfer 2 embryos for our first FET. I turned 28 the day before my FET. Both embryos implanted and I carried the twins until 27+3 when I went into labor that couldn't be stopped and I was delivered via c-section (baby A's water broke 2 weeks prior to that). According to the NICU nurses and neonatologists my boys have done exceptionally well (no brain hemorrhage, no need for intubation, eating and growing, etc), but you can look at my post history and see how hard of a journey it's been.   There's no knowing what'll happen either way - you could have twins and have a great pregnancy and carry to term like some of the girls on this sub, or you could have a singleton and have a difficult pregnancy, or any number of scenarios in-between. I'm not trying to discourage you from transferring two embryos, but I would caution you to think carefully about how much you're willing to go through.   ETA: we didn't have PGS and all our embryos  were high quality."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,spankyjubblies,6,Mon Jun 29 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"I had same experience. Failed single embryo transfer, decided to do two for my FET. Both implanted. Had a normal twin pregnancy until I was admitted to the hospital at 28w due to preterm labor. I spent three weeks on hospital bedrest, delivered at 31w, boys spent 4 weeks in nicu.   I agree with spanky that you never know how a twin pregnancy will go, plenty go to term, but plenty don't. It's a really tough decision. If I could go back in time I would do eSET but hindsight is 20/20 and I would be glad to not have had the experience of watching my two boys that tiny hooked up to so many tubes and wires. But on the other hand you could transfer two and still end up with a singleton or carry twins to term, it's a tough decision."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,erinrae0814,9,Mon Jun 29 17:56:28 2015 UTC,We did one(PGS'ed) and I have a singleton pregnancy.  Please read about all of the compilations that arise from twin pregnancies.  I highly advise you against transferring two unless you fully understand the risks.
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,vibeee,7,Mon Jun 29 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"My clinic pushes for single embryo transfers too. They're fairly strict about it unless you're over a certain age or already had a number of cycles that didnt work.  We ended up transferring two but it took a lot of convincing to make it happen. We ended up with a singleton. I did a lot of research and budgeting first because I needed to be able to know I'd be ok with it, and that I could make a case for two.  To be honest, now that I've got the one, and we've had complications, I'm kind of glad only one took. I see a lot of posts about twins and can see how many fears and complications can happen. Not all the time of course, but there is the reality that it is just higher risk. Seeing that, I think maybe my research didn't give me a realistic view of what to expect.  I would have loved twins, but now, I""m glad I've got my one."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,Bibbityboo,5,Mon Jun 29 15:41:29 2015 UTC,"Age dependent. I'm only 30, and we only had one embryo survive the 5 days. My RE only would have done one anyway (also shady grove, that's their policy). I'm currently 10 weeks with my one embryo. We didn't do PSG testing either, didn't see a need.  My mom had twins when I was a teenager. She was on hospitalized bed rest from 24 weeks to 33 weeks when they came weighing not quite 4 lbs each. They were in the NICU for about 4 weeks. They are happy, healthy 17 year olds getting ready for college now, but I never would have even considered putting more than one embryo in. I know some women are lucky and carry twins to twin term and go straight home, but the majority do not, and shady grove tries their best to avoid these scenarios. If you look at the statistics, eSets are no less successful than double transfers if you are young."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,sunlightonwater,4,Mon Jun 29 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"We put one in with our fresh IVF which resulted in my 2 year old son.  We put one in with our first FET last year and ended up with a mc.  We put two in with this last FET and I'm currently at almost 12 weeks with both of them! Nobody strongly encouraged me one way or the other.  I just always wondered if we had put two in last time would one have them survived, so that is why I opted for 2 this time.  We didn't have any PGS testing done either."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,cakegroove,4,Mon Jun 29 15:25:37 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to say either way. We kept putting two back, having one stick, then losing it to trisomy.  I got tired of it so went to PGS.  When our Dr's saw we had PGS-normal embryos, they said hands-down do a single transfer because the sticky-rate for PGS-normal FETs are so high(around 87 percent) and like vibeee said twins can come with complications. Some do some don't but it is definitely a risk to consider."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,effingeffstick,4,Mon Jun 29 15:45:15 2015 UTC,We had one embryo transferred.  After research the additional risks associated with a twin birth I wasn't comfortable transferring two right off the bat.  (ETA: given the quality of our embryos)
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,traveler5678,3,Mon Jun 29 16:26:34 2015 UTC,"Because of my older age at the time (38), my RE was comfortable transferring 2 without PGS.  It was likely that the embryos wouldn't stick due to my age.  We ended up doing PGS for my two successful rounds and only transferred one normal embryo each time.    If you are younger and don't show any signs of premature ovarian aging, then I would go with the SET.  Twins and triplets pregnancies have additional issues.  You have to accept the risks that could arise if you are successful."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,curiouslywanting,2,Mon Jun 29 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"I am 42, which is why nobody bawked at me putting in 2"
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,cakegroove,3,Mon Jun 29 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"My first three attempts  (all failed) we did 2 embryos - one fresh transfer, 2 FETs.  Then with our next retrieval we did PGS and after finding out it was chromosomally ok, we transferred one and that's the one that stuck."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,Blankety_blanks,3,Mon Jun 29 16:03:32 2015 UTC,"We had a successful fresh transfer with our first round of IVF. I was 24 at the time, and chose to transfer two embryos. My Dr strongly recommended one, because multiple pregnancies are high risk and being young and healthy (unexplained infertility, so no idea why I hadn't been pregnant before) a twin pregnancy was more likely.   In the long run, I was right. Transferring two very high quality embryos resulted in a single pregnancy. There are so many factors that go into the choice. I think for me I crunched numbers. I was more likely to get pregnant if we transferred two embryos. Whether it was a single or twin pregnancy. We have two frozen embryos left, and if/when we do a FET I will transfer both. If you want to chat in more specifics you can definitely pm me!"
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,montanadoodle,3,Mon Jun 29 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"Even though I would have been overjoyed with twins, we decided to transfer one embryo for the following reasons.   It was our first try and we have 7 high quality embryos. We may have tried two the second go-around. I am petite (125lb, 5'1"") and was concerned about my ability to carry twins. Risks of premature labor and birth defects increase with twins. Someone on /r/infertility mentioned the cerebral palsy rate can be as high as 30% with twins (they had a source but not sure at this time).  My RE gave us a 5-7% increased chance of implantation if we transferred two embryos vs one. Online sources (recent studies) said as low as 0% increased implantation rate. This was not high enough for us to consider going through with the above.    It's easy to say since we did achieve pregnancy but I'm very glad we transferred one. I had moments of regret that we weren't carrying twins though, which i can't really explain other than my SIL went through IVF at the same time and is pregnant with twins. She is 2 weeks behind me and has had way more issues with losing weight (already underweight) and morning sickness.   The main advice I can give is make the choice you know you can live with. It's a very personal and important decision. Best of luck to you!  EDIT: I wanted to add that my diagnosis was PCOS and I am 29 years old, currently 20w5d along with my fresh IVF baby boy."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,digitabulist,2,Mon Jun 29 19:05:58 2015 UTC,"We put in one for our sucesseful fresh cycle. I was leaning towards 2 as well, but with the high quality of our embryo the doctor was extremenly against it so we went with one. My 10 month old girl is very healthy :)"
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,AwkwardOrangeHippo,2,Mon Jun 29 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"For our first FET we did 2 (resulted in a CP). We were comfortable with the idea of twins and my RE didn't have any major concerns about multiples based on my age and health history. A twin pregnancy is higher risk than a singleton but as far as I know, it's extreme. If your doc has concerns I'd definitely listen to them though. Your age and history may factor in differently. Good luck. It's a tough decision but make but make sure it's your decision. Don't let the doc bully or scare you."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,RositaYouBitch,2,Mon Jun 29 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"We (also SG) went into our first IVF with 3CPs (all natural) as well as 1 failed TI and 3 failed IUIs.  For our first IVF, we had two 8 cell blasts transferred on day 3 after poor fertilization (hard shells).  This resulted in CP #4, but was too early to know if one or both took.  IVF #2 we froze our only blast in the hopes of doing batch PGS testing.  IVF #3 was a total bust with none of our 15 fertilized embryos being viable for transfer or freezing on day 5.  We did a FET without PGS last August which resulted in CP #5 - at which point we went to DIVF.  We had a fresh transfer at the very end of last year, and I wish I had pushed for two but in the end I caved and 1 was transferred and 1 was frozen.  The cycle was a total bust but FET worked and currently 19wks pregnant.    I wish I had gone for 2 during the fresh one because we wound up with 2 embryos on day 6 (1AA and 1BB) but the BB did not survive the freezing process and I feel like I somehow cheated it as that's the one that would have transferred along with the original day 5 AB. However, had we been able to successfully freeze both of them, I'm not sure if I would still have that guilty feeling."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,jaina_jade,2,Mon Jun 29 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'm 39. We did three transfers prior to my third IVF (transfer #1 Fresh: 1 8 cell; transfer #2 FET: 1 grade 3-4 blastocyst; transfer #3 Fresh: 2 8 cell embryos). Two of these transfers took, both ended in miscarriage.   My doctor was frustrated and told me I should go for three. Part of the reasoning was a suspicion that my eggs were poor quality and had trouble freezing. I'm currently pregnant with twins. If I could do it over again, I would only have gone for 1, though I'm sure I will love both babies deeply when they arrive.  I'm 24 weeks now, and this pregnancy has been awful -- severe morning sickness and placenta previa. Being pregnant with multiples I'm also higher risk for a bunch of other conditions like pre-term labor and gestational diabetes. But the fear of complications once they are born is what makes me most hesitant about my choice. My pregnancy has been exceptionally difficult though. The only thing that keeps me sane is the amazing MFM team that is seeing me through this.  One thing to keep in mind -- especially if you do assisted hatching -- is that if you put two in, you can end up with three. You may want to consider what you would do if you ended up with triplets."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,afikomeme,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"A brief glance at your history tells me you're 33yo and ""unexplained""? My two cents would be that eSET for your first FET would be reasonable, but here's my experience:  I was 31yo and unexplained when I had my first IVF (had already failed 6 cycles clomid with 4 IUI). Like most clinics (as in your situation), the policy was to just transfer one, which I was happy to go along with (the risks of multiples scared me). Unfortunately, we had zero fertilization, so we never got to the transfer part.  We then added ICSI. IVF#2 and #3 we transferred two each time. After the failure of IVF#1, I had changed my tune and was gung ho to transfer two, and the clinic didn't give me a hard time (I was at MGH in Boston). I had a very early m/c with #3.  Then I moved to DC and transferred care to Shady Grove. I did have two frozen embryos still available at MGH but for insurance reasons, I chose to keep doing fresh (maybe a bad decision) and save the frozens.   For IVF#4 we transferred two which failed. For IVF#5, my RE was on the fence for transferring two vs three, and I pushed for three-- that failed.  Finally IVF#6 went really well but my RE decided to not do the usual fresh transfer and instead freeze everything (he based this on some particularity of the hormone levels, particularly the progesterone I think). For the FET, my RE wanted to scale back to transferring two (since he thought the cycle went well), but given that I was on my 6th (and last) IVF retrieval, I pushed to transfer three again, and he relented.  Of course, that was the cycle all three took! We ended up doing a selective reduction down to two (can search my history for details on this), which was the right decision for me, but not easy to go through. And we now have beautiful almost 4mo old twins. They were born at 34wks, spent two weeks in the NICU, but knock-on-wood are mostly healthy so far.  As vibeee said, I would definitely research the risks associated with twin pregnancies...with modern medicine, most do well, but there are some scary possible complications.  Also, be aware, of the low risk of both embryos taking and then one splitting, so you end up with triplets. It's unlikely to happen (though I have seen a user on reddit with this situation), but I think it's important to know what you would do in that situation (i.e. reduce or not).  Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,m_c_escherichia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:47:29 2015 UTC,"We transferred two embryos, one high quality blast and one low quality 9-cell. If I had it to do over again, I think I would have just transferred one. The extra low-quality embryo didn't increase our chances of success much (maybe 5%), but it took our chances of twins from ~0% to around 10%). On the other hand, that was the only shot that 9-cell embryo was going to get, since no way was it good enough quality to freeze. If we'd had two good quality blasts, I'm pretty sure I would have done a eSET. It's hard to be objective though when you've got some unsuccessful cycles under your belt, and you just want to be pregnant immediately."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,slumlord2001,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:11:26 2015 UTC,"We didn't do genetic testing either.  We ended up with three good quality embryos. During fresh IVF we chose to transfer 1.  Didn't last.  FET, we transferred both remaining embryos.  It was definitely an emotional decision, as well as medical.  In the event of twins, we had to factor family/friend ability to help, monetary issues, juggling two schedules, etc, etc.  We chose two.  And got two.  As far as medically, I have to say, I'm sitting here at almost 37 weeks, and a c-section scheduled for 39+1. There have been no signs of growth issues, medical issues, or medical distress in either baby.  No signs of premature labor.  So yes, early labor definitely CAN happen, and it can be traumatic, but it doesn't always end that way either."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,dutchqueen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"I had no choice in the matter, but for what it's worth, I did single embryo transfer and my 7 month old is a crawling maniac!  The other end is a high profile case of the Gardner Quads, 4 beautiful baby girls from 2 embryos. They are doing great now but obviously had an early birth.  Either way, best of luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,biogenmom,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"I transferred two embryos.  Only one took and I am currently pregnant with a singleton.  I'm glad we transferred both, but I'm also glad only one stuck.  I'm 29 if that matters."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,female_engineer_here,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:27:52 2015 UTC,"I just posted an intro, thought I should before commenting first.  We just did an eSET FET on Tuesday the 23rd. We really went back and forth since we have had so many failed IUI's and I have been through a lot medically in the last year. After talking with out doctor we decided to so a single embryo. We had PGS testing done so we knew it was a normal embryo going in. Our RE told us based on my age and the number of embryos I had that were normal he recommended 1 for the first try. If it didn't work he said next time we would do 2.  I was really on the fence, I was just really mostly worried about having complications in pregnancy above and beyond a normal person based on the major abdominal surgery i had last year. I also didn't want to go through all we had been through and end up with babies in the NICU. It was hard since he told us 60% chance of success with 1 embryo and 80% chance with 2 embryos. In the end that extra 20% chance just wasn't worth it to us for the first try."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,handywife6,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"After our fresh cycle resulted in a CP, our RE recommended transferring 2 but as we only had 2 left, I wanted to do 1 at a time. Apparently there was some miscommunication and they thawed both. Lots of crying and anger and them telling me it was risky to refreeze one so we transferred both. We'll find out Thursday how many we have in there. I'm still really angry my choice was taken away and I have no future chances saved up. So my advice is that whatever you want to do, make sure it is clear and in writing."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,dancer331,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I cannot imagine. I hope you get the outcome you want and that the clinic can provide a good explanation of how that happened. I can't imagine how upsetting that would be."

InfertilityBabies,3binu1,dancer331,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to just be happy about the result and won't let myself have regrets in the future. But honestly, I do wish I had transferred one. That would have given me one child now and one in a few years like I wanted. Now, I'm worried about losing one and about the health risks to me and the babies. I'm also worried that if/when we want another down the line I'll have to go through IVF all over again. I'm happy to be pregnant and won't let this get me down but I was angry and frustrated when we were told we had twins. I'm perpetually terrified of losing one now and eager to go in next week to find out they're still there. As much as I didn't want 2, I don't want to lose a child."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,dancer331,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"So hard... I'm sorry they took the decision out of your hands. I wish you a successful and healthy pregnancy.   I'm still trying to decide if we're going to put in one or two, I change my mind daily. My fear is if we put in one and it doesn't take, and if we put in two maybe one of them would have stuck. I hate having to make this choice.   The husband is on board for two- but he'll let me have the ultimate decision."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,Aventurijn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:18:29 2015 UTC,Not sure if this would affect you but our original thought process was partly driven by cost. I knew we had enough insurance left to help cover 2 transfers so I wanted to do one at a time. I also worried something was funky with my hormone levels and maybe they could learn from the first try to make a second successful. But ultimately I also had to consider if I could really handle going through it 2 more times and that was the one thing that made me sort of consider doing 2.
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,Hopecat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"Just one and that one is a 8-month-old baby now. I'm 27, in my country  it's illegal to transfer more than 1 under age 35 unless there are severe medical reasons (regular infertility is not one of them). In my case, we did IVF/PGD. I'm a low responder, first IVF there were only 6 embryo's harvested and only 2 were eligible for PGD. No transfer, fail. My second IVF, we got 6 embryo's again, but 3 blasts that survived the PGD. Because I'm such a low responder, my RE exceptionally allowed a transfer of 2. However, I'm a petite girl  (160 cm, 50kg) and the idea of twins was daunting, not only for me but my SO was really worried about that too. Ultimately, because it's my body, my SO let me decide. Because we got three embryo's, I decided to first try a single transfer and if that would fail, to transfer both remaining embryo's together in a FET.   In hindsight, I'm glad that my RE offered me the option but I'm relieved that I didn't take it. It was an uneventful pregnancy, a happy healthy baby as a result. We'll try for a sibling next year and I'll probably do single transfers with the frozen embryo's, depending on how well they thaw.  It's your decision but if you only did 1 transfer and got 4 embryos left, you've got options. Depending on your age, you've got time. Please inform yourself about the risks of twin pregnancies."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"I'm the reckless voice of pro-twins. Transfer the number your heart tells you...  I transferred 3 after a long journey of losses and failures. All 3 implanted. I had a selective reduction and while I'm sad to have to make that decision I have happy healthy twins. I wouldn't change anything now in retrospect, even with my son in NICU for 13 days after they were born at 37+1.  Best wishes and good luck."
InfertilityBabies,3binu1,Ishslittleone,0,Mon Jun 29 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"I'm 32 and we were doing our first IVF cycle for unknown infertility. We did not do PGS testing. We completed our cycle with just two viable blastocysts, one of okay quality, one rather borderline. We took our RE's advice and transferred both and were delighted when both took. (Even though even just one sticking would have been wonderful, it would still have been sad to lose the other). For the first 10 weeks or so, twin B was always a few days behind twin A in measurements, although he's since caught up. I firmly believe that if we had implanted them singly, only twin A would have stuck. Our RE did indicate that when implanting two, you have a higher rate of twins than you would expect and that they do seem to ""help"" each other in some as of yet unknown way.  The pregnancy was totally normal until 21 weeks when I was placed on bed rest due to a shortened cervix. I will remain on bed rest until I deliver, which we hope is a good ways off! So far, the boys both look perfect--they have passed all screenings and tests with flying colors, their anatomy scan was great, they were in the 66th and 71st percentiles at the scan. Membrane looks good and they never stop wiggling. So our focus right now is just keeping them cooking for as long as possible."

InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,RositaYouBitch,5,Tue Jun 30 01:39:02 2015 UTC,"Holy shit yesterday was a long day. The flight itself went pretty good but our bad luck continued upon arriving into Miami. We had to circle the airport for a while due to storms so that delayed us about 25 min. Then our baggage took about 45 minutes to come out because everything was on hold for lightening. Then Pond started screaming to eat the minute we tried to get on the road. And the genius I married didn't bring the car seat base and felt like relying on our 8 year old gps instead of the clearly marked road signs was a good idea so we got totally lost trying to get out of Miami. But we made it to the house finally and it's so nice! And Mr. R grabbed me a yummy chocolate cake dessert after he dropped my parents off at their hotel so all is forgiven. Kitty seems happy here. We have a little gecko that lives in our car port and coconuts in the tree right outside. As soon as all the boxes and clutter are organized, I think this will be our little paradise."
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,razzertto,2,Mon Jun 29 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"Oh... pics of the house?   So much has changed with Miami's highways in the last three years that I would basically chuck that GPS for use here. It'll work fine in KW though.  Did you enjoy the view on the way down? You probably had shitty weather so it wasn't that pretty and you were tending to a newborn so that was hard, but if you get a chance to enjoy the drive once, do it. It's really beautiful."
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,RositaYouBitch,2,Mon Jun 29 14:47:18 2015 UTC,The house is a bit of a disaster still but here is our gecko friend. I'll post house pics later this week.

Our kitty is much happier in this space, and stopped compulsively scratching her ears to the pount of bleeding.  No gecko friend though, but I'll take whatever I can get :)"

InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,cakegroove,3,Mon Jun 29 21:33:49 2015 UTC,"My BIL and his fiancee broke up. He called us last night. I am SO SAD. Apparently she just... fell out of love. Apparently it's pretty amicable, but they're 5 hours away and there's nothing I can do. I just want to do something, to fix it or make it better somehow. My heart hurts so much for both of them.  In other news, in a remarkable feat of self-restraint, I passed up the opportunity to get a Jules BumGenius diaper. It still hurts.   It also hurts that my kid woke up at 5.52 this morning. WHYYYYY??? Sleep continues to really suck. Parents with older babies, was the 6 month sleep regression a thing for you? We moved his crib into our bedroom last night, and I was planning to work on napping him in the crib and at least starting the night there... but he's going to be 6 months on the 1st, so I'm wondering whether it's worth the effort at this point. (He will strongly resist. This boy likes to be cuddles to sleep and while sleeping.)"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:04:42 2015 UTC,I felt like we've had a sleep regression with our son since he was born!  I can count on one hand the amount of days he has slept entirely through the night.  We co-sleep but this is going to have to change soon.
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,GrammaMo,2,Mon Jun 29 11:34:43 2015 UTC,"Ugh, mine has never slept through. I actually really love co-seeping, except that we really should have a different mattress is we're going to co-sleep and I just can't keep cuddling him for the entirety of every nap. It's ridiculous. Sigh. Good luck to both of us!"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:39:25 2015 UTC,"We also co-slept and I'd keep trying to sleep train her to separate us. It was AWFUL and every sleep regression or bout of teething would set it all back. I felt judged constantly because I just couldn't do it. Then one day it clicked and we'd start signing for sleep and she signed it back like she was ready. So I put her down in the crib, tucked her in, and gave hugs and kisses after nursing. We turned on rain sounds and turned out the light but I sat there with her until she fell asleep. First night there was some fussing but only about thirty minutes on and off. Did this for about a week and by the 3rd day no fussing happened, almost as if it was OK because she knew I was still there. Then the following week we'd do it but when I put her down and tucked her in she'd go to sleep immediately so I could just turn out the light and leave. Now she sleeps through the night all by herself every night from 8pm-8am. It can be hard but do whatever works for you guys. I tried a couple CIO or modified CIO methods but transitioning from co sleeping was just different and harder for us, I guess. Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,kat_loves_tea,2,Mon Jun 29 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"Signing for sleep is such a good idea! I'm not even close to introducing baby signs yet, but I'll have to remember that one when we do start. I did baby sign language at daycare when I worked in the infant program but somehow never thought to use ""sleep."" I'd even sign ""blanket"" sometimes, so no idea how I blanked on ""sleep"" haha"

Now at night it's just become constant and I love it. And recently she's started to sign and say it for naps. Yesterday, when I asked if she was ready for sleep, she did say no and asked for her stuffed hello kitty so the bargaining has begun. Fun!"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,TigFan15,2,Tue Jun 30 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I feel like he's just not there yet. Although he has been in the crib this evening with his usual levels of wake ups, so that's something I guess.  For sleep did you use the baby sign or ASL sign?"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,slumlord2001,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:29:21 2015 UTC,We use this sign for sleep and she does it easily. I definitely felt like I was behind on the sleep training but she was clearly resistant to the methods we were trying. This is what worked for us and I'm just so happy she adjusted to it easily. My big girl is happy and a great sleeper now and we're so thankful.
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,razzertto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:42:58 2015 UTC,I started out by napping in the crib in their own rooms and very quickly transitioning to full time. Also I found they just started waking up earlier when they started to sleep through with no pacifier fixes or anything. 5 is pretty standard here.

She's a pretty agreeable baby, so for us that meant letting her cry for 30 minutes once, then for 10-15 minutes a few times. She'll still wake up and cry for 1-3 minutes occasionally, but she goes back to sleep on her own. I also do a dream feed at 3 am instead of letting her wake up for food, since I think that was confusing her."

InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,TigFan15,3,Tue Jun 30 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"Let me paint this medical picture for you all and see what you think.  I was in Tahoe this week, which is much higher elevation then my normal midwest lifestyle.  I had a ton of bloody noses while I was on vacation.  The day I left we had to get up super early (3:00 am) and on the way to the airport I started noticing that my blindspot of my vision in the right eye wasn't really filling in all the way.  It was bizarre.  The most notable vision issue was I was sitting across from this man and his face was like a swirl.  I feel asleep on the plane and when I woke up it was gone.  I woke up this morning around 4:30 with a pretty big headache but that could be from not drinking enough water yesterday.  What do you think, anything big?  Is it all elevation related?  Just normal pregnancy stuff or worth a trip to the Dr?  I know I can just call, but I really hate doing that because they almost alway say ""If you're really worried, go to the ER,"" when I'm really just looking for an opinion from a medical professional.... I need to find a new OB but that is a problem for another day.  I have an appointment next Thursday... think I'd be ok to wait until then?  Baby is kicking and feels fine, by the way.  Edit: Dr. sent me home from work, which I'm not too upset about.  She just wants me to rest and if my headache is still there tomorrow to call back, but I already feel better.  She made it sound like it could be an elevation change thing but either way I just need to rest.  I'm all over that!  Thanks for the help as always :)"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,cakegroove,2,Mon Jun 29 12:52:21 2015 UTC,"Everything sounds fairly normal considering your circumstances. You probably had an optical migraine. I've had them too and they're unsettling. That said, I'd still see the doctor or at least call the nurse line and talk to someone. Changes in vision are absolutely a reason to get checked out. Don't feel like you're being paranoid. Better that than regretting getting looked at if something is wrong. Take care!"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,TigFan15,3,Mon Jun 29 14:22:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a optical migraine.  Yes, these are dehydration related so totally can be caused by elevation where the air is drier.  But definitely go to doctor."
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,cakegroove,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:33:33 2015 UTC,I caved and called already.  Waiting for a response.  I hate going :(  Makes me feel like a hypochondriac every time.
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,ThatGreenSolGirl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:47:49 2015 UTC,"It's better to be safe than sorry, but based on what you described I would bet that you experienced an optical migraine.  The first time I had one it freaked me out so I can understand your worry.  I thought that it was a sign that I had a brain tumor or something just as bad."
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,vibeee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to lie, that was my first thought this morning... I was pissed thinking that I finally get to have a daughter and I get a brain tumor.  I'm glad I have people to talk to me down! :)"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,montanadoodle,2,Mon Jun 29 16:21:02 2015 UTC,"Glad that I can help.  It's such a weird experience.  It's easy to think of the worst case scenario when you've been through a lot of medical crap!  But still go to your doctor just for piece of mind.  When I had my first one, I called an ophthalmologist and they told me over the phone that it was a migraine and not get an appointment unless it comes back frequently."

Eventually I was put on bed rest for my BP, but didn't have to be medicated for it  Edited to include:  We found out when they delivered my son via emergency c, that my placenta had been deteriorating which was the cause of my BP issues"
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,lancealittle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:39:49 2015 UTC,Yikes.  How long were you on bed rest?  And what kind of bed rest?
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,futurecompanion11,2,Mon Jun 29 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"For 2 weeks, just advised me to lay on my left side when I was in bed. I wasn't on strict bed rest, but I should have been because any time I got up to do anything it shot up, and I could feel it. So I really did not much of anything besides binge on Parenthood on Netflix. I have similar concerns with this pregnancy but I guess that's a good reason why I'm seeing an MFM."

She's been taking measurements from curtains and is currently out at the upholstery shop getting fabric samples so we can get a couch recovered. PLUS she reminded us that our hand-me down couch is actually a fold out bed so she has something much better than our usual air-mattress on the floor approach."

Also the first morning in a while that I haven't thrown up. So that's a good start I guess.   Almost finished with the baby registries!! Hoping that people follow them, because I only put the stuff on there that we actually really need! Baby showers are on Aug 16 and Aug 22. Seems so close yet so far away. I'm getting pretty jealous of people and friends who all just recently had their babies. I just want to hold and snuggle my own!"

InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,SJP8,2,Mon Jun 29 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"Baby has shifted her witching hour from a more reasonable 6-9 pm to a now 8–11 pm, so last night we were so desperate to get her to calm down, that my husband took her for a walk at 10:45, which barely worked.  She didnt eat much through the night, which left me feeling super engored, and fucking Spectra wont return my call to order new flanges.  I would try to rig it up with Medela parts, but my brain is so non functional to do this.  Plus, I think another one of the stitches prematurely popped open in my perineal area, now this is starting to burn a lot.  I know I should expect pain from grade 2 tearing, but the pain has gotten worse since last week.  Calling the doc asap and hoping he can see me before July 1st when my insurance changes ....  Edit:  good news is the perineal stuff is normal and to be expected.  Hormonal changes apparently can also do that.  That being said, she suggested that if the pain is getting worse, to call and make an appt.  I'm glad that this is normal stuff, and that nothing is actually ""wrong""."

InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,apanda1084,2,Mon Jun 29 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"Oh sweetie, that's brutal.  I HIGHLY recommend hacking the Specta to use Medela parts. They're so much more available. Remember, you don't have to be the one to do this - you can totally outsource this to a non-exhausted person in your life who has offered to help you. Send them this linkhttp://www.reddit.com/r/InfertilityBabies/comments/36elio/spectra_s2s1_users_out_there/ and ask them to make it happen.  I had grade 2 tearing, and when things got worse rather than better it's actually because the stitches were ready to come out. Either way, yes, a visit to the Dr is in order - I really hope he can squeeze you in!"

InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,Bibbityboo,2,Tue Jun 30 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"Take the medela line and cut it near the tip so it's a short line with the special tip. Then shove it on the front side of the plunger and then the tip into the parts. Then attach the regular spectra tube to the backside of the plunger and the other end to the pump. I use medela parts, I like them better.  Tears stuck. Are you using the spray? I stopped using it prematurely and it hurt. Got back on it and felt so much better. Used it for probably 3 weeks pp."
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,GrammaMo,2,Mon Jun 29 12:25:17 2015 UTC,"Still using the spray, which tingles and burning comes back again.  The pain gets worse in the evening, and its not getting better with xtra strenght tylenol and otc motrin.    I feel like such a bitch.  Usually, I can tolerate pain/discomfort better than this :("
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,SJP8,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:07:28 2015 UTC,Are you still using the warm water squirt bottle when you go to the bathroom? I also had a 2nd degree tear and used that for a long time. The spray helped but the new mama bottom balm was really great too.
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,apanda1084,2,Mon Jun 29 16:20:08 2015 UTC,Yes!  It helps a lot!
InfertilityBabies,3bhxv6,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party - had a 3rd degree episiotomy and the spray burned me too. Sitz baths helped the most. At least twice a day, water as hot as I could stand. I got bad hemorrhoids & it helped with those too.   Also it took at least six weeks before I felt healed down there. Probably longer but it's pretty hazy now. Be easy on yourself - some women give birth and run marathons a month later or some crazyness. But just like every baby is different  every recovery is diffrrent."

Kitty won't stop whining, it took forever to get checked in and through security, the TSA guy was a dick to me about my stroller being to big, Pond went from zero to banshee when he got hungry and blew out of his first outfit, I forgot my carseat protector bag, and the airport thought this was a good day and time to test the fire alarms. They were loud as fuck. Deep breath and thank the sweet Lord for my wonderful parents who have more patience than God himself."

I am hoping I'll be rewarded for this kindness somehow.   Also, his GF revealed she wants to have a baby with him. He's nearing 70, she's 28. I'm sufficiently grossed out and kind of horrified at the thought of LL having an 'aunt or uncle' younger than her. Am I the only one who thinks this is fucking weird?  They're leaving in a few days, I like having them around but I'm ready for them to go."
InfertilityBabies,3bet4m,razzertto,3,Sun Jun 28 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"I can't say I'm surprised that a 28 year old wants a baby...but yeah, it's weird that she's with a 70 year old.  Eek."
InfertilityBabies,3bet4m,female_engineer_here,2,Sun Jun 28 22:25:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the part about an aunt/uncle being younger is not super weird for some cultures. It happens a few times in my family just because of the sheer size. For instance, my oldest uncle is now 74 and has ten kids, each being a few years apart. His oldest (now about 50) had her first child about 25 years ago while his wife was pregnant with their last. They literally went to the same schools and grew up together. Same on my mom's side (she's one of 10 kids) so my older cousins were getting married and having kids when I was starting in elementary school.    The part that would be sad to me is that hypothetical kid could potentially grow up without a father for a large portion of their life. Though maybe it's just a mindset thing for me lately. My parents are in poor health and I realized recently that they'll likely not be around to see S graduate high school or get married."
InfertilityBabies,3bet4m,kat_loves_tea,2,Sun Jun 28 17:34:39 2015 UTC,It's unusual that's for sure. One of my close friends through high school had an uncle a few years younger than her. She had a big family so I think he just blended in with all the similar age cousins.
InfertilityBabies,3bet4m,ThatGreenSolGirl,2,Sun Jun 28 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, /u/female_engineer_here makes a great point that a 28 year old wanting a baby is no surprise - the age difference is what weirds me out. LL would probably just be more like cousins with the baby, right?  Also, no matter how great they are, I'm pretty much always ready at some point for house guests to leave. Hang in there!"

But mine came at 37+1 per doctors and the NICU time for my son was heartbreaking. I have so much guilt for not holding on longer. My doctor told me early on in the pregnancy that every day inside at the end is like three in the NICU in terms of health and development.   Do your very best to hang on, but also get ready - they'll be here so soon! On the flip side, 37 weeks is considered full term for twins by my doctor, and yours may feel that way too.

I haven't been yet, but it's been highly recommended, and all the cats are adoptable shelter cats, which is nice :) https://www.facebook.com/cafevenosamontreal  And if you decide to leave Montreal and head toward Gatineau, there is the BEST children's museum inside the Canadian Museum of History. It was a favourite of mine growing up, it's all hands on and interactive and you learn about all different cultures from around the world. (And that just happens to be near Ottawa, just sayin' haha) http://www.historymuseum.ca/childrens-museum  And I totally sympathize with your partner, Canadian French is like a completely different language from ""real"" French.

InfertilityBabies,3bau1l,PrincessCBHammock,12,Sat Jun 27 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"We're going to give Asher a bath today (Sebastian already got his)! He's had them before but the nurses always do it when we're not there. Yesterday the nurse asked if we wanted to give Asher his bath, so he told night shift to hold the bath so we could do it when we get there today. I'm so excited.   Sebastian was doing better yesterday. They stopped two of the antibiotics and they're weaning him off the ventilator & he's doing well (no episodes of apnea & bradycardia all day). He also started getting breast milk again and might be back up to his full feeds and off IV nutrition by today. Hopefully he'll make a full recovery by next week when both boys are supposed to come off c-pap.   ETA: one of my parents' friends was a total asswipe yesterday. He was joking about how we need to have twin girls next and I said that we can't wAit for more kids and we definitely want a girl, but that I'm done with twins because it's been too hard. He the proceeded to tell me all about how pregnancy is the easy part (because he would know right?) and that if I thought that was too hard that I'm in for a big surprise. I calmly informed him that if it were just the 17ish weeks of constant nausea, the BP high enough to send me to the ER at 14 weeks, or the constant discomfort of being huge so early on, that I'd do it all over again in a second, but that I never want to go through preterm labor like that again and put my babies and myself at risk. He shut up after that and I went back to making my chicken soup. What a moron."

Maybe you're daughter is just a fucking bitch, lady."

InfertilityBabies,3bau1l,talula79,2,Sat Jun 27 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"It's true that I popped early and really started feeling movement before 20 weeks this time (and had another pregnancy to compare it to), but I would totally be one of those people if I were straight and clueless. Until I got big fetal movement, I really had no clear physical indication I was pregnant."

It wasn't until she felt something (both times) that she went to a doctor and they're all like ""yep, baby""."

All of the organs, spine, etc. were just how they expected them to look.  The little one was a bit uncooperative so they had trouble giving a definitive answer on sex but both the tech and doctor thought it's most likely a girl.  They scheduled an additional ultrasound in two weeks to try to get some better views of a few things, but for now everything looks good and just how they want it to be!  I think my husband was most amused when the tech commented on the long leg bones... I'm 5'10"" and he's 6'3"", so we will not be surprised at all to have a long-limbed baby."

Sebastian has been sick since earlier this week. Long story short - they found e.coli and another gram negative bacteria in his blood. He was so tired from fighting the infection that he basically stopped breathing on his own and being able to digest food. He was put on a c-pap that expands his lungs for him at a set rate per minute & that helped (he didn't require oxygen), and they stopped feeding him and put him on IV nutrition again. He's also being given 3 types of antibiotics.   It's been a scary week but the neonatologist assured us that we're experiencing the best-case scenario: it was caught early, Sebastian responded well to the new c-pap and didn't require oxygen or intubation, and subsequent blood cultures and a lumbar puncture have all come back clear so the antibiotics are working. But damn if it doesn't break my heart to see him so tired and struggling so much and not be able to hold him (he doesn't tolerate being moved well right now) and make him feel better."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,lancealittle,2,Fri Jun 26 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm so scary about the infection -- I'm glad he's doing well, but I was worried that we hadn't heard from you. Sending lots of healing thoughts your/his way!!"

We did not know each other outside of the group, and we had nothing other than infertility in common, but we bore witness to some of each others' most private sadness. She was a member of the group from its inception, and she was still a member when I got pregnant and left. She never got to build her family."

InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,becabecaful,2,Fri Jun 26 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"I love the cleaning lady idea, but he is kind of resisting. My Mom has offered to come in and help, but it's making him feel inadequate.   I reminded him that I didn't want him burnt out before the baby comes... I'd rather we be able to comfortably spend that time together, not worrying about the house. He just brushed it off. I think we will chat again about it this weekend. :)"
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"Aww, poor guy. Is there any room in your budget for a cleaning service? Anyone who can drop him off some food?"
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,becabecaful,2,Fri Jun 26 15:56:43 2015 UTC,Someone needs to drop him off food for sure.... Maybe I should organize that! He doesn't like the idea of a cleaning lady.... He's crazy in my opinion! Lol
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"Can he tell you why? It took some doing to convince my husband. Turns out he felt bad spending the money on something we ""should"" be doing ourselves. Even though we can afford it. Finally he agreed that it was better to spend the money and have that time together and not fighting about those chores. Maybe he'd be willing if he saw it as a stress reducer/way to make the rest of life easy target than an indulgence. For what it's worth, ours comes every 2 weeks."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,becabecaful,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:18:31 2015 UTC,"Possibly related: I've discovered that my husband never feels comfortable spending money unless it is specifically budgeted for. So when we had general discretionary household income, he resisted taking vacations. Once I added a specific budget line for vacations savings, then he was totally fine with spending the money and we took a vacation! I know that, for sure, if we ever get a cleaning service, it will have to be handled the same way. Otherwise, he feels bad about spending the money."

InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,becabecaful,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:34:09 2015 UTC,I think even a once over of the house would be helpful. I'm going to try and chat with him this weekend and see where he is really at :)
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:50:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe give him ""permission"" to take some down time? Suggest that he call up some friends or go to an event or play video games or whatever he does to blow off steam. Stress that the house can wait. It sounds like he may not be giving himself permission to veg, so maybe hearing it from you will help?  I also love /u/MinnieErva 's suggestion of a cleaning person. Even just someone to come in and do the stuff he hates doing once in a while. If it's out of the budget, maybe you have some friends who would come by and have a ""cleaning party"", if he's okay with that?"
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,cakegroove,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he does a bit of that, and I've cut back on having him come see me, but he wants to do it all.... I think it's a pride thing. He has a hard time letting go of control.   Maybe he just needs to hear it all again!"
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,MrsDragon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"I have to remind my husband, often several times, that it's okay to go out or to sit down or accept help. What I sometimes do is brainstorm ways people can help and then run them by him. For instance, I would think getting help installing child locks would be awesome (they are a PITA and those kids will be mobile before we know it). But he is insistent that they require a delicate touch and he doesn't want anyone else doing it. But he's okay with people coming over to help him put up meals. He would hate someone else mowing the yard, but he's okay with someone else putting together nursery furniture. Lots of people have offered to help while I'm on bedrest and I can coordinate via fb, but finding out what he wants/is willing to accept help with is key.   I also find listing it all at once is helpful. If I ask him if he wants help with task x, then y, then z individually. He will say no, it's no big deal. But when I discuss that we need to do tasks x,y, and z, he's more likely to be willing to accept help with at least one. I gently stress that there's a lot to do and he's doing a TON since I can't help and that I don't want him to have to stress out. It's important to acknowledge that I'm not trying to round up help because I think he can't do it, but because it's a lot to do for anyone."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,apanda1084,2,Fri Jun 26 19:23:48 2015 UTC,Great thoughts here. I'm going to try and have this conversation at home this weekend.... Might be easier when I am in the house and can see everything.   He's taking tonight off and looking forward to sleeping in tomorrow. Hopefully that helps him relax a bit!
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,jaina_jade,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:49:31 2015 UTC,"About your husband - is it possible that's he's more stressed out about your health, baby's health, imminently being a father, new roles, loss of control etc. but displacing those anxieties onto focusing on more mundane tasks like cleaning the house and food prep? And maybe that's why he's resisting a cleaning lady (which would be altogether appropriate)?  Does he have anyone else he can talk to about these things?  Practically he may benefit from a chance to feel in control of something or discussing what actually needs to be done to avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,dancer331,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"I know he's stressed about all those things... Who wouldn't be?   I'm hoping we can chat and get things figured out this weekend. I think it's hard too because his standards of acceptable. Clean are a lot lower than mine, and he knows it. I've been trying my best to emphasize that it's all okay, and it will be fine no matter what. (Ie, not get all judgy on the state of things)"
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,dancer331,3,Fri Jun 26 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"My Friday was all good til I got home from my parents late. Got heaps of stuff done at hair school, watched a movie with my parents. Came home to go to bed and felt a little gush and had some red spotting. I have slept and don't have any cramping but it's still hard not to worry. Midwife says it's normal and is hopefully nothing. If I spot thru the weekend she will check my betas next week. But for now I wait.."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,SJP8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:16:51 2015 UTC,I agree with hard not to worry but it sounds like everything is back to normal.  A lot of woman bleed early in the pregnancy.  I hope it's nothing... Take care...

InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,GrammaMo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:42:11 2015 UTC,It's fairly common to have small pockets of blood that pop and look like you are having a period.    Staying busy is the best thing for your mind.  If it continues on Monday I would ask them for an ultrasound.  They may be determine where the blood comes from.  I'll be thinking of you!
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,MrsDragon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:31:28 2015 UTC,"Ah OK,  I did wonder where it comes from when people spot. Thanks for your thoughts xx"
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,SJP8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:34:56 2015 UTC,It called subchorionic hematoma.  I'm assuming that what it is in your case.  Might be too small to even see it on an ultrasound.   http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/complications/subchorionic-bleeding.aspx
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,SJP8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:38:05 2015 UTC,"I did have brown spotting last week too over the weekend. I have an ultrasound on the 6th once husband is home from work, so hopefully it will settle down and I can get until then. I might ask for bloods next week anyway just for reassurance."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,SJP8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:46:57 2015 UTC,Ask them also about progesterone suppositories.  They may want to add it your protocol.

We're both hoping his birthday present is good news on my progesterone level so should get that later today. Volunteering all day tomorrow at a local gold tournament and though we'll have pretty crappy weather this weekend, at least it's the weekend.

InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,lancealittle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:59:52 2015 UTC,We'll try to figure out something to do together. A lot of things are sort of hanging on if this all works out or not. Plus we're visiting his parents tonight and he's babysitting tomorrow while I volunteer so we'll delay our celebrations a bit.
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,vibeee,2,Fri Jun 26 16:24:23 2015 UTC,"So now that I'm on leave, I can watch all the happenings in my neighborhood, including the toddler day care that is RIGHT NEXT DOOR to my apartment.  As in 25 seconds away from me.  We heard a bunch of kids hollering outside (totally fine, they sound like they're having fun), then they scream, ICE CREAM!    It is 11 AM here.  I really wanted to send my kid to this place when she's older, but I'm thinking of ruling this one out now because of 11 AM ice cream.  Hopefully this is not a daily occurance (god knows I have the time to watch now), but still...ice cream before lunchtime?  Am I being petty/pretentious?  My husband thinks this is a bad habit to instill in 2-3 year olds...I'm inclined to agree (unless they do this very rarely, then I'm willing to bend).  I am ok with occasional ice cream after lunch time.  Thoughts?    FYI, today, is a coolish perfect summer day, it is 73 F outside."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,lancealittle,3,Fri Jun 26 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"Depending on their schedule, 11am may be lunchtime. They also may want to give them the sugar now, while they can run it off, rather than after lunch, right before a nap? It really depends on the schedule. Or it could be a special treat someone brought in for a birthday/etc/  I agree that I wouldn't be thrilled about daily ice cream/sweets at daycare. I wouldn't want my kids thinking you get dessert after every meal (or even every day) and if they are getting sweets every day at day care I wouldn't want to do them at home, which would annoy me."
InfertilityBabies,3b6tsq,honmamichin,2,Fri Jun 26 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was going to say! Also ""ice cream"" might not be ice cream either. At my centre, puréed frozen fruit was ""ice cream"" too."
InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,Surprizethrowaway,24,Fri Jun 26 00:18:58 2015 UTC,"Wow. Just wow. I have such mixed emotions about reading all these ""Wow, I'm pregnant!"" posts.  On one hand, there is not another group of people in the world I could be happier for. You've walked my road. You've had hope and you've had it crushed. You've been through hell and succeeded. Then succeeded again! It's amazing and I'm so happy for you!   On the other hand, fuck. Just fuck. I started my goddamn fucking period yesterday. We've been trying for 9 months after our twins. I feel guilty even writing this because I am forever grateful for my twins! Not only did IVF work but both embryos took! We are the lucky ones!  But fuck this fucking endo. Not only does it prevent me from getting pregnant, it slaps me across the face with unbearable pain and cramping just days after crushing my hopes.   Honestly, I am thrilled for you and it gives me a strange sort of peace to know you've been able to get pregnant. Like all the wrongs of your struggles have been righted. But it is also a reminder of my failure. It shouldn't be. Your news literally has nothing to do with me but I don't know how to make my brain realize that.  I'm sorry to shit on your post. I don't mean to take away from your news. This is huge! I guess I'm just hoping I'm not the only one feeling so confusingly mixed about all these announcements."
InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,NBPTS,9,Fri Jun 26 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"Fucking PREACH! My kid's a year and a half, no birth control that whole time and here I am, on my period again."

InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,socphd,5,Fri Jun 26 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? (Edit: As in, ""No shit. Me too."") I feel like for the rest of my life there's always going to be a little bit of ... something else... lurking for me around pregnancy announcements.  Last night (and I shit you not) I told my husband that there are all these surprise pregnancies lately, and I know it's not rational, but I feel like there's ""something in the water"" and we should have unprotected sex because I want another kid eventually. WTF? There's no causal link between this sub and pregnancies! Our marriage has barely survived the past 6 months, why the hell do I think we're ready for another one?   I will forever be fucked up in my thinking about how to (and when, and if we can) get pregnant."

InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,NBPTS,5,Fri Jun 26 00:47:52 2015 UTC,"Please don't feel guilty. You have an absolute right to feel any emotion this brings about. Of course it's exciting! And of course it's scary!  Let me let you in on a little known, rarely published secret about having 2 under 2... It's amazing! Don't get me wrong, the first 6 months were intense but I feel like I'm the lucky one now. They entertain each other and already know how to share. My daughter has a special laugh she shares only with my son. He makes her giggle in a way no one else can. They play hide and seek and chase each other. They even talk to each other but not in a weird, creepy way!    And put them in the same room as soon as you can. They wake up from nap and in the morning and giggle when they see each other. They play and play for as long as I let them. I've gotten an extra 30 (and sometimes 45) minutes of ""me time"" because they're so happy in there.   You can do this. And we're here to help you navigate! Congratulations!  ETA this link:  http://youtu.be/rifHuJjYRfs  I took this video yesterday. This is the laugh she saves for him. It's so incredible to see them together. Your babies will be the same way in no time!"

InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,cakegroove,2,Fri Jun 26 12:01:39 2015 UTC,I've been using OPKs for months now. I bought a big pack from Amazon and I already have to buy more. The one thing saving my sanity is that I'm the most regular I've ever been without any drugs. It's really weird. Though now I just wonder why it's not working if I'm apparently normal now.
InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,NBPTS,2,Fri Jun 26 12:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry :-( Nevermind the infertility issues, but the crippling bring you to your knees pain is just adding insult to injury."

They were still in the nicu when I had it placed and I wasn't in a good place mentally. I'm going to see about getting it removed and see when we can start treatments again and I have a lot of mixed emotions. What if I get my hopes up and it doesn't happen? What if we have twins again? Can we survive infertility hell and treatments with kids? I didn't even realize how much I wanted more until I felt so jealous of all these posts!"
InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,positivelywaiting,2,Fri Jun 26 13:33:31 2015 UTC,"Those are totally reasonable feelings, and I can't imagine anyone faults you for posting about it.

I didn't expect to be hit with these emotions again and I am grateful that I have one to snuggle when I feel overwhelmingly sorry for myself.  I still stupidly get a tiny glimmer of hope every month that ends with me being pissed and in pain (though nothing like ending pain).   I can't even bring myself to officially start trying again but I still know in the back of my head that we haven't used a bit of contraception since Emily was born so, yea it ain't happening."

That's the exact age difference I was hoping for. But, alas. This month has come and gone.   Ok, truth time for some much needed comic relief. I was actually counting the months on my fingers by tapping on my husband's shoulder while we were having sex!  That's how hopeful I was! I was planning my maternity leave before he even came. Geez!

A lot of female fertility issues can resolve themselves after a pregnancy.   I'd love to be one of those lucky women, but our issue is a very low sperm count so it's practically impossible for me to get pregnant without going through IVF again"

InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,razzertto,6,Fri Jun 26 13:37:50 2015 UTC,Sooo can you tell us who you are? I'd like to be able to be happy for one of us
InfertilityBabies,3b4x46,MrsDragon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:37:04 2015 UTC,11 weeks! I still can't/don't believe it.
InfertilityBabies,3b5495,tumbleweedss,2,Fri Jun 26 01:22:08 2015 UTC,Good luck!
InfertilityBabies,3b5495,JaneDarkmagic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:29:30 2015 UTC,Thanks. I know my post was kind of ramble but I just need to get my feelings out sometime.
InfertilityBabies,3b5495,septicidal,2,Fri Jun 26 01:31:22 2015 UTC,"The odds I was given for my cycle with 3 mature follicles and a post-wash count over 50 million were 30%... And it failed.  The IUI that was successful had only a 5-7% percent chance because my husband's count was inexplicably low and I only had one mature follicle.  But I am 18+1 with a healthy baby!  Something another user said to me really resonated... Whatever odds you're given, it comes down to whether it works or it doesn't. Luck/chance/your body doesn't care about a 95% chance of failure or a 50% chance of failure.  And nothing we do can influence whether it works or not - we've controlled all the variables we can, but at the end of the day part of it is luck/chance.  It helped me a lot to get through those unsuccessful cycles by having a plan for next steps.  If the current cycle failed, knowing I would be doing X or Y next helped.  It also helped to have talked about a long-term plan with my RE, so I knew no matter what happened a single failure would not be the end of the road for me, at least not now."
InfertilityBabies,3b5495,SJP8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:16:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  It sucks, but so much of this is luck.  There is nothing you can do to control the outcome of a treatment cycle, but having a plan-both short and long term is very helpful."

I was also considered ""young"" when we started trying when I was 27. Definitely far better to discover issues when you are younger as you have more time to figure things out... And you are right, the older you get the harder it is. I will be almost 30 when we finally have our first child but our issues are way different from yours so don't worry."

InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,AwkwardOrangeHippo,7,Thu Jun 25 11:52:00 2015 UTC,"Screw them, dude. Enjoy the shit out of your kid. Few people know what to say or how to have a genuine conversation. Whether it's because they're too busy or don't know how or just don't give a shit, a lot of people default to trite cliches rather than real thoughts. I kept getting ""warnings"" while I was pregnant: how this baby would basically destroy my life so I'd never sleep, read, have sex, etc ever again. You know what, I'm doing just fine. The sleep thing is maybe the most true but it is already getting better and I'm only 7 weeks in. When people say stupid stuff now sometimes I just smile and nod but more and more I say something like, ""I fought long and hard for this baby. I'll gladly take a week to read a book as opposed to a day or two. Plus, I have a supportive husband who loves his kid so he doesn't mind spending time alone with him while I have time for myself."" That usually takes the wind out of their sails and results in some pretty funny backpedaling."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,RositaYouBitch,2,Thu Jun 25 12:46:44 2015 UTC,"""I fought long and hard for this baby. I'll gladly take a week to read a book as opposed to a day or two.

InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jun 25 15:08:43 2015 UTC,That is AMAZING. Good for you! Making a mental note of your response...
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,pamplemousse2,6,Thu Jun 25 15:10:05 2015 UTC,"People have this uncanny ability to pick only the most negative advice and experiences to share with pregnant women and new moms. If someone asks how I'm feeling and I say ANYTHING other than ""Great!"" I get to hear about how I'm only going to feel worse as I get bigger. One nurses aid at my grandma's nursing home told me about how her bladder ruptured during labor and she almost died. Hoooookay, thanks so much. Had never met her before in my life. All you can do is smile and nod and tune them all out."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,4,Thu Jun 25 12:22:48 2015 UTC,"The terrible labor stories angered me. Yes, labor can take turns for the worst, and surely not very many are super textbook; but damn can you let me worry about myself and my baby without unloading your crap?"
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,apanda1084,2,Thu Jun 25 14:20:27 2015 UTC,Seriously!! It's actually really upsetting now because labor terrifies me. All I can think is that women still die from childbirth and these stories make the fear so much worse. I have no idea why they think what they're saying is a good idea.
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,3,Thu Jun 25 16:21:48 2015 UTC,"They don't think. Therein lies the problem. : /  I honestly think most people operate like story computers. They hear a relevant keyword and out spits their story, whether it's appropriate or relevant or not. I know I catch myself doing this sometimes and have to reign it in."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:47:54 2015 UTC,Exactly - why not just let people live in the moment without other peoples baggage.
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,RositaYouBitch,3,Thu Jun 25 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"I was with a group of women who were sharing labor stories. Most were along the lines of, ""It was exhausting and painful but it was so worth it."" Cool! That's great to hear. One bitch though insisted on telling me how awful it was. Painful and horrible. Then because she was a nurse she added on other people's horror stories. I got up to walk away from her and my water broke :/"
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,4,Thu Jun 25 15:15:28 2015 UTC,"HAHA okay I laughed out loud at that. Perfect timing for water to break -- right when your anxiety is high from hearing terrible birth stories. It's like ""What, you're worried about your own labor being painful and scary? Well fuck you, it's go time."""
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jun 25 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"Yup. My two most favorite conversations right now:  Them: ""How are you feeling?"" Me: ""Tired"" (True and socially acceptable, do they really want to hear the other stuff? No.) Them: ""Hahahaha! Oh, well expect it to be that way for the next 18 years!""  and   Me: ""....twins."" Them: ""Oh. Twins. I could NEVER do twins!"" (Especially when said by parents who have more than one child.) Me: ""....""  Um, thanks? So I'm never going to sleep again and my life will be hell? I appreciate the vote of confidence, but perhaps they could just go back to not saying anything."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Thu Jun 25 15:07:43 2015 UTC,Yeah what the actual hell? I'm pretty sure they COULD do twins since you don't really have a choice. You don't just neglect one cause one is all you can handle. Those statements are just idiotic and not remotely helpful. Twins will be awesome. I almost hoped for them myself.
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,MrsDragon,6,Thu Jun 25 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, I keep wanting to ask them what they think the alternative is. ""Oh, would you like to take one then?"" ""Yea, we're planning to give it a few months, then pick our favorite and leave the other for the wolves...""  I've settled for saying ""Well, better me than you then!"" as brightly as I can and walking off. I think twins are going to be awesome! A ton of work? Yes. Different than one at a time? Yes. Totally worth it? Yes."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Thu Jun 25 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"You're going to get to watch them grow together and interact and form that twin bond. Sure, it'll be hard. But it'll be amazing."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:26:56 2015 UTC,WOW - a bladder rupture. Feeling very grateful no one was that graphic with me. :/
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,3,Thu Jun 25 12:49:55 2015 UTC,"I'd really like someone to tell me a GOOD birth story because I am scared to death of birth. Like can't someone just say, ""It was great, I got an epidural and had some snacks while watching Harry Potter. Then I pushed for a little while and out he came with minimal tearing."""
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jun 25 21:29:41 2015 UTC,"I had a c-section due to some risks, but it went really well. SO much faster and calmer than I thought. And - this was huge for me - I got to see and touch BabyHippo withing minutes of them pulling her out AND when they were stiching me up she was only out of the room with Mr. Hippo for about 2 minutes. The anesthesiologist talked to me the whole time to let me know what was happening and what I would feel, so it was really cool rather than scary and she told me where BabyHippo was and what was going on anytime a nurse had to clean or weigh her (not long, but nice reassurance).  So, there is my positive story although since I didn't go through the normal channels of labor I'm not sure it's what you're looking for.   My friend just had a baby and did get an epidural and watch reality TV and nap up until she pushed. Pushed for 10 minutes and had a beautiful healthy girl with no tearing or complications. She was up walking within a half hour. This friend was not allowed snacks in the hospital but as soon as her daughter was out was munching beef jerky with her baby on her chest - such cute and silly photos!  Edit to say friend says 100% epidural is the way to go and it is her new best friend ;)"
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,WhateverYouSay1084,3,Thu Jun 25 22:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with ANY positive birth stories, c-section or otherwise! You never know when you're going to end up needing one and frankly it almost sounds less scary to me. The whole thing is over and done with much quicker than vaginal delivery it seems."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, a c-section delivery is super fast. I was terrified before I had mine but it was not bad at all...recovery from it was slow for me because I never do well with pain meds and have an existing back issue. BUt all in all I would totally do it again :D ;)"
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,RositaYouBitch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"I spent literally years before/while we were trying psyching myself up for labor and delivery. I really liked the book Baby Catcher. There are some scary stories, but also some really positive stories. Mostly it just realized normalized birth for me. Like this is something LOTS of women do! And it doesn't always have to be traumatic. Granted, it's a book about a midwife, so they are all homebirths, which may or may not be your thing, but I didn't find it overly preachy."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,lancealittle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:28:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I work with a girl whose baby went into distress, aspirated meconium, and died during a homebirth. Soooo yeah, hospital all the way! I think you're right and it's not that big of a deal in the end. It's just fear of the unknown."
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:04:35 2015 UTC,"Ooh yea, I wasn't personally considering home birth, and with twins? Definitely nope. We're insisting on delivering not only in the hospital but the one with the best NICU we can find (and let's hope we never need it!) But I did really like the stories because of how varied they were and how normalized the whole process was.  I'm also a giant wuss and so the pain aspect scares me half to death. I mean, obviously, people do this all the time but...yikes. I did recently learn that our hospital's epidural rate is 90% so...I'm guessing I'm not alone in these feelings. :)"
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,ktbell,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:32:23 2015 UTC,"For me, after the epidural it was mostly boring, especially because they weren't checking me at all because my water was broken. We didn't watch Harry Potter but we did watch a Marvel marathon. And Modern Family was on while I was pushing. No snacks though...they wouldn't let me eat incase of emergency surgery. It's the shortest part of pregnancy so even though it feels like forever, you're so close to meeting your baby!"
InfertilityBabies,3b2an0,pamplemousse2,3,Fri Jun 26 14:42:12 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, make sure you feel REALLY GUILTY if you're not enjoying that day when your toddler makes life a living hell and you're doing it on your own and you have to cancel all your plans because the kid puked on you (twice) and just when you thought nap time was starting you get banshee howls instead . . . yeah, make sure you enjoy EVERY FUCKING SECOND because that's what the motherhood myth is all about. I swear, people have absolutely zero memory of what it's like to have young kids. I am one of them -- I'm having a hard time remembering just what the good and bad parts were of having a 2 month old or a 5 month old. I get a huge kick out of my preschooler, and I love her to pieces, but no I don't want to ""bottle her up"" at this stage, because then I wouldn't get to see her grow and develop and continue to become her own person, even if that means picking fights with me and increasing emotional distance. It is amazing to watch, even the painful parts, and I have not yet had any desire to hold her back so I can keep my identity intact and my needs met.   That said, I haven't survived a 14-year-old yet."

InfertilityBabies,3b2z9s,OrganizedSprinkles,3,Thu Jun 25 16:11:31 2015 UTC,I gained 10 lbs before we started trying a year ago.  With that in mind I have been 'conscious' of not going overboard.  So far I'm 11lbs from my pre-pregnancy weight and I'm pretty happy about it.  I hope I cap it off at 20lbs however I am growing a big baby.  He has been consistently measuring ahead and I was told to expect a 9lbs baby. 9 lbs of baby plus amniotic fluid and potential 20lbs weight gain doesn't scare me.  Sounds like I should be able to get back to normal fairly quickly.  I hope you have a boring rest of your pregnancy too!  It's so nice not to deal with anxiety while going through this life changing process.

If everything goes well, I will have two babies 19 months apart come next March. I also feel bad that I'm reinforcing that stupid old wives' tale about how once I did IVF I was sure to get pregnant naturally with a second."

InfertilityBabies,3b2z9s,apanda1084,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:53:29 2015 UTC,"I feel good so far. Just hungry and thirsty. I'm still breastfeeding (although my supply has definitely dropped the last couple of weeks), so that just makes it worse. And I totally know how the pregnancy symptom spotting goes. I've taken several (negative) pregnancy tests since the baby was born just due to paranoia."

He assured me that he would only be looking for a temp to fill in if I was gone long enough to warrant one, and that he had no intent or interest in bringing someone in to replace me. And the comment about ""I'd hate to lose you"", was meant for me, meaning that he is concerned having a 3 year old and twins will be too much for me to come back to full time work.  He may be right. But I feel much better after having talked to him"
InfertilityBabies,3b2z9s,vibeee,3,Thu Jun 25 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"Yay! I know that was a point of anxiety, so I'm glad to hear that. Maybe you won't go back, but its good that that can be YOUR decision and not be forced into one."

InfertilityBabies,3b2z9s,LowOnHope,2,Thu Jun 25 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"Especially since they never give this flak to their male employees. I'm pretty sure my boss expects that I will quit and not come back once I deliver. Despite the fact that I've told him that's not the plan. Sigh.  Not to mention the number of people who ask me if I will return to work. Compared to the exactly 0 people who have asked my husband that. It drives me crazy that ""balancing work and family"" is presumed to be a female responsibility. I wasn't aware that penises rendered you incapable of caring for your children."

I'm not much of a help with naps other than after the newborn months, sticking to a schedule helps and figuring out sleep cues and triggers (dark room, white noise, 5S, clean, fed) are important."

So my one consolation for things happening in the office is the count down until my mat leave (we get a year here, Im' so very grateful). I'll be job hunting once I'm back, but until then.... just remember....soon. (Yes, just had a very frustrating staff meeting. The issue is completely management not staff).  I have tomorrow off which I'm really glad for. We're going to visit the clinic and drop off a thank you gift, then go tell my family. There's been some drama leading up to this, but I've noticed my husband really trying the last few days. Hoping we can really just enjoy the trip and have a break from everyone.  My hip pain was pretty bad last night, but thankfully today I am doing well! Do/did  you guys use one of those big U shaped pillows? Right now, I'm sleeping with a pillow between my legs and its helping a lot."
InfertilityBabies,3b2z9s,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jun 25 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"Ugh, you have my sympathies on the job front. :/  I'm glad your husband has been making an effort! Are you going to be able to tell your cousin/family before the big event with your in laws?  I've been eyeing the pregnancy pillows but not bought one yet. For now, I have a regular pillow I've been using as belly support--it's my sides that ache when I don't. I've been putting off getting something bigger since I hate having even the one pillow between my husband and I though, he feels so far away!"
InfertilityBabies,3b2z9s,lancealittle,2,Thu Jun 25 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Well, we're skipping the big event with the in-laws completely. I really put my foot down (through tears, I'm not that strong!) and made it clear that I didn't want my weekend that we'd planned to tell my family co-opted by family. That that was really dismissive of my family and unfair to me. I also really stressed that I need a break from my in-laws. We were going to tell a couple of his family members who live in this city, but one-on-one. So I've conceded to rearranging some of the times of things, so we could tell those key people face-to-face so that at the event people can talk about it (I don't care, I won't be there). Its made the time a bit weird (really busy and then some downtime). But that seemed fair.  I'm glad its decided, and just really want to have a relaxing weekend.  Its weird, normally I want to be as close to my husband as possible, but its been pretty hot lately so we've been in a ""no-touch"" zone for most of the night. We're also on pelvic rest, so I think some of it is my husband trying to keep from jumping me (he's really into my bigger boobs). I do miss spooning though."

I do miss spooning though.   I think this is some of what's going on here too. We're also on pelvic rest (booo) and I'm really missing cuddling/spooning."

We're dying over here -- we've only had one week free of being on pelvic rest since the IVF (so March?). Its weird, its definitely not the sex itself I miss, but the intimacy. Cuddling and spooning is so important, isn't it? I want to make mroe of an effort, but I go to bed soo early these days that its hard.  Always something to work on!"
InfertilityBabies,3b2z9s,jaina_jade,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:17:45 2015 UTC,"Its weird, its definitely not the sex itself I miss, but the intimacy.    Exactly. Sex is wonderful, but it's all the other stuff that comes with it that I miss the most. And I'm a touchy feely person to boot, I get out of sorts with not enough physical contact.  We've only been on official pelvic rest since the bed rest started, but early in the pregnancy we had sex and it resulted in spotting and that made us really gun shy, so there wasn't much going on. We were just starting to maybe be more comfortable again when I got put on bed rest. I'm just thankful I haven't been hit with the amped up libido some women report while pregnant, that would be just miserable!"

That way, when you need a break, you can ask her to do something (exchange this outfit for something, buy these things, etc.) and get yourself a little breathing room.  If you like her cooking and she's willing to help make freezer meals and such, you could also get a bit of a break while she's in the kitchen and you're resting in another part of your place.  Today I am... Horribly underdressed.  I forgot the luncheon honoring someone was today, and am wearing maternity jeans and a very casual maternity top.  If I had remembered I would have worn a dress or something a little nicer.  Oh well!  If anyone gives me any trouble I can just start rambling about how nothing fits me properly and I have a ton of things in the wash (true, actually).  My anatomy scan is tomorrow morning.  So incredibly, horribly anxious.  I am hoping I will feel a lot better once it's done.  I think I may actually have to take an Ativan to cope with the rest of today, though.

InfertilityBabies,3aynu7,BeefyKat,13,Wed Jun 24 15:43:20 2015 UTC,"Well, and maybe you could team up with the gay advocacy group? I'd bet that lots of their members would be interested in access to fertility treatments too."
InfertilityBabies,3aynu7,pamplemousse2,4,Wed Jun 24 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"Yep -- me and my gay spouse are 1000% infertile and dropped too much money on our family, even the first one that was ""easy"" to conceive."
InfertilityBabies,3aynu7,lancealittle,3,Wed Jun 24 17:22:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't pursued it because I work for a tiny company that I know can't afford it. But, its an interesting question and I would think really depends on the community and culture of your business. On the one hand, I know exactly what you mean about the transgender issue. Its not that you don't support that, but I would think that the percentage of people who would need that assistance vs fertility would be quite different and a bigger impact could happen through fertility coverage. Maybe I'm cynical, but that makes me wonder if its partially lip service -- they can offer it, but really its not going to come up much so its not like they'll be paying out often? But I'm cynical  I do think that if you have a large LGBT community in your company that that can help your cause. Because its not just straight people who need assistance, a lesbian couple would absolutely benefit as well. A gay couple may as well (though I don't know if stuff like surrogacy would be covered. What about adoption?"
InfertilityBabies,3aynu7,Bibbityboo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"You are cynical, I am cynical, I was thinking the same.   For the most part, for example, this is testosterone or estrogen coverage, the insurance companies listed by the HRC say no cosmetic stuff.   And they consider top surgery to be cosmetic.  The NHS in the UK that has had this coverage a long time does not consider that cosmetic."
InfertilityBabies,3aynu7,Pamzella,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"I second your cynicism, which is maybe why in part I never approached them at first?  I don't know... I feel like maybe it can't at least hurt to try - see what happens.  And you and /u/pamplemousse2 have good ideas to partner with the LGBT group."

InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,Hopecat,7,Wed Jun 24 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"For five years now my main goal in life was having a baby. Everything revolved around how to achieve the goal. Now I've reached that goal, and have the chance to reframe my life. It feels powerful and really helped it sink in that holy shit I have kids now.  I sat down and started a new goal list of 1/3/5/10 year goals. It feels amazing to be thinking of my life in terms of not just myself but my family. Wow.  One of my more vain goals is losing weight, so I started by signing up for myfitnesspal this morning. I've struggled off and on with weight throughout my adult life so in part it feels like getting back on a merry go round - but it's also to have a healthy mom for my kids. A new level of motivation! I'm currently classed as ""overweight"" based on my BMI and would like to get to ""normal""."
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,messofletters,7,Wed Jun 24 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"My kid weighs 9lbs 11oz. Wow. He used to be so tiny (I know he still is but let me have this!)  Also my GP said don't worry about supplementing, he's on his own curve and there may be some variation scale to scale, but going from his birth weight to now there's no problems that he can see.  Also, he sort of tried to roll over in bed last night. Kept flailing his legs to one side and when we gave him a bit of a push he got the biggest smile going from tummy to back. I've noticed little nubs on his front bottom gum line so I'm worried he's going to be an early teether and early mobile."
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,larabair,3,Wed Jun 24 14:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah! So happy your GP said to screw caring about the growth curve. :)  Sounds like your guy and mine are both similar in the ""let's be on the upper part of the bell curve and freak our parents out."" BB has been trying to crawl for nearly three weeks, and his head strength scares me. I'm so not ready to even think about baby proofing!"
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,messofletters,2,Wed Jun 24 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I haven't even considered baby proofing!  Maybe I'll just wear him until he's ready to go to school."
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,razzertto,2,Wed Jun 24 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"Aww... 9 lbs 11 oz is great! He's growing really well. I'm not looking forward to the rolling stage. I'm not ready, not at all."
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,messofletters,2,Wed Jun 24 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone keeps mentioning how well he holds up his head, and all I've been thinking is that he's been doing it pretty much since birth.  He loves being on his tummy and is starting to scoot when he kicks. and the drooling is out of control. He's not cranky but my husbands family are early teethers."
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,razzertto,2,Wed Jun 24 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"LL has learned to scoot on her back (we're not that diligent with tummy time). And yeah, the drooling it's over the top. Plus, she's always got her hands in her mouth!"
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jun 24 15:06:21 2015 UTC,"Good big baby! Good job D putting on that weight!  If he's an early teether, you have my sympathies. And empathy, since Isaac was in a hurry for his first teeth, too!"

InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,MrsDragon,5,Wed Jun 24 16:34:31 2015 UTC,"Ferberized my 9-month old! She had been 100% bedsharing and breastfeeding to sleep every single night since she was born. She was a good sleeper, but we recently went on a vacation with her and our system didn't really work anymore (i.e., she could roll off the bed; I wanted to hang out with my friends at night!). Plus, I am planning on doing an FET to give her a sibling as soon as possible and need my period back for that to happen. I figure cutting out the nighttime feeds will help in that.  Good news is it has worked incredibly well! I comforted her the 1st night in 3, 5, and 10 minute intervals, and she was asleep after about 25 minutes with non-hysterical crying. Last night, she was asleep within 5 minutes, woke up only once and cried for less than a minute, then slept til 6:30am! I am so proud of her. This was waaaaay less painful than I thought it would be. I do feel a little bad, but just keep telling myself this is the best way to get her a sibling, which we all really want.   I start a new job in November, which means I can switch to an insurance that will once again cover fertility treatments. How the fuck did I get so insanely lucky?! I am so grateful for all we have. It's seriously nuts."

And everything was great! :D My cervix is back up to 2.8cm, which is enough that no other interventions are necessary, we can just stay on the bedrest and progrestreone supplements! Wahoo! :D  The boys both wiggled constantly, the poor techs had a time of it trying to get all the measurements. But persistence eventually won out! They are both 1lb 7 ounces, but distributed differently--one is in the 66th precentile and the other the 71st. Both have all organs present and accounted for and their fluid levels look good.  And that ""debris"" near my cervix seems to have been knocked out by the anitbiotics. I forgot to ask about it, but my husband said he didn't see anything on the scan and last time he could see it.  We picked up lunch on the way home and then watched an Agents of Shield while eating before my hubby headed into work. All said, an excellent morning. :D"

InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,septicidal,2,Wed Jun 24 15:08:20 2015 UTC,He works in IT and from home so I think home time vs work time boundaries aren't clear enough for him. He's definitely gotten better since the kids were born but still has trouble taking vacation time without working and generally puts in 60+ hours a week so a true vacation day or two next week will be huge if he keeps his promise of no working.

But yeah, we've got lots of good brains around here to help you out. :) my biggest tip would be to not bother using cloth with a newborn - is certainly doable if it's important to you, but you change SO many diapers with a newborn (as you know!), and you need newborn sized stuff... So yeah. Isaac's NICU stay pretty much answered that question for us anyways, but if we have more, I don't think I'd use cloth until they're big enough for the one size diapers we use."

And we get enough rain here to make outdoor clothes-drying a bit of a roulette experience. But I'm excited to do diaper laundry again, at least until we're buried under snow :/"

InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jun 24 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, when I first moved into this apt, the smoke detector was so brilliantly placed outside the bathroom so when we took showers, the damned thing would go off.  I moved that thing in a heartbeat.  Scared the crap out of me the first time it went off, then I realized the steam triggered it.  Glad there's no fire and everyone is safe.  Baby has been screaming ALL morning since her last feeding.  Husband took her on a walk, which helped, but the minute she came back the screams began again.  Shes not hungry, her diaper is clean, so we decided to let her CIO with a swaddle (which she broke out of!) and white noise maker.  Apparently this is normal, which is why I am ignoring her (not really) and I'm on reddit."
InfertilityBabies,3ay3rh,dutchqueen,2,Wed Jun 24 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"Ugh, baby, quit that!   We used an unbreakable swaddle aka batwing swaddle - check YouTube of you're looking for something to keep her contained. Isaac would hulk out of regular swaddles in no time flat!"

But crawling into bed was the comfiest I've felt in a while.  (Until the rib pain set in, however).  I was up and down all night with body aches, ribcage pain, and a mild headache.  Woke up this morning feeling like I was hit by a truck.  Took an almost-hot with epsom salt bath at 7:50 in the morning, for like, an hour.  Popped a Tylenol, and kinda doing better now.  I'm just so wiped, winded, and otherwise feeling icky.  Then, turning into Starbucks this morning, I started crying for no reason?? What???    My (last?) ultrasound is Friday, and an OB on Monday at 36+5.  I might ask if we can't go ahead and move up eviction day, as long as they're doing ok still.  I'm kinda just done."

My ob is giving me a 4 hour pass out of the hospital tomorrow, so I get to go say goodbye to the kids at work! Then we are going to go home so I can see my kitties a little. Super mega happy face there!!  Update on Grandma  - as we speak she is undergoing a triple bypass heart surgery. It won't be over until well into the evening. I'm trying not to think about it too much so I don't totally stress out, but it's on my mind and I'm nervous. As always, send your good vibes her way. :)"

I'm starting a one-year teaching position in the fall and have a ton of prep to do for my 3 (!) courses. Syllabi,  lectures, everything. How in the hell do I get all this done with a 6.5 week old? It's not feasible to wait until she's in daycare to start prepping."
InfertilityBabies,3azx30,vibeee,2,Wed Jun 24 21:13:48 2015 UTC,Let me chime in and say I think six is more then enough. I hardly used the muslin swaddlers. I found the halo sleep sacks much much more useful. The muslin ones make good light blankets and are food for sun protection.
InfertilityBabies,3azx30,razzertto,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:00:44 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it you might be right.  I will be washing things at least every other day.  6, maybe 8 should be enough.  I just like them so much!  And my baby is coming whne it's going to be hot out.  I will be using them for breastfeeding covers, sun protection, you name it."
InfertilityBabies,3azx30,MinnieErva,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:27:02 2015 UTC,I had 3. 3 was definitely not enough. I think maybe 6 or 8?
InfertilityBabies,3azx30,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"I just counted - we have 9 A&As plus some random ones. I would say 10 is good - possibility fewer, but we used a swaddle technique that required two blankets, so I guess it depends on your kid. (Also, level of puking, whether you use them when our and about, etc. I never wanted to run out, so it was nice to have lots.)"
InfertilityBabies,3azx30,Hopecat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:39:46 2015 UTC,I will get 10!  I absolutely love them!  And maybe a couple more for gifts!

We use it to sit on outside, as a light stroller blanket, as a sun shield, as a light bed blanket, as something to lie on on the floor...   We bought an awesome Aden and Anais ""Dream Blanket""- highly recommended! So soft and comfy."

InfertilityBabies,3avo5i,PrincessCBHammock,5,Tue Jun 23 22:23:35 2015 UTC,Oh what a strong woman you are. I know there are days where it will not feel that way. I saw a counselor for many years due to my recurrent pregnancy loss and she was right when she said it was like a wheel...grief circles back around from time to time. Talking about loss is hard. Please consider a counselor or something if talking with your husband doesn't improve. My husband wouldn't bring it up at all. I thought he didn't care. He said he cared too much and didn't want to hurt me by talking about it. I am so sorry for your losses and that you have crap friends.

We all scramble to the internet to find things to relate to when things go wrong and I know this will help someone, somewhere, at some point in time.  Take care"

It made me cry too but I am so proud of you for staying so strong after going through something so incredibly awful. When I had my miscarriage I found that my family was distant too. They thought I wouldn't have been able to handle a phone call. And it was rough at first but I would have still liked to have had a call even if they just said ""feel like talking? No? Ok well I love you and will call later."" That's all it would take to show support. But I guess it's hard, especially when they understand. And they can only understand if they go through that and you don't want that of course.   Anyways if you do want to chat anytime, please PM me and I can even give you my BBM if you want. Take care, and keep being strong. Distractions are the best and it sounds like you have a bunch. Big hugs, and I am so very sorry for your loss."

I don't have personal experience of loss but professional (that affects me personally and very deeply). As a nicu nurse, I've helped far too many moms through similar experiences. I bring this up, only to say that I'm not uncomfortable talking about loss and I know what your babies looked like and know how beautiful they were, so if you need someone, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm so glad you had someone come and take pictures. Thank you so much for sharing your birth story. My thoughts will be with you.

InfertilityBabies,3avo5i,pacsunmama,2,Wed Jun 24 04:54:44 2015 UTC,"This is kind of a tricky question. My husband and I agreed not to name them. But after they were born I felt bad for them not having names. He doesn't talk about it. He hasn't mentioned the pregnancy at all. They have names but it's just for me. I feel like if I brought it up to him, he would be upset with me for talking about it. He didn't touch them, hold them, or even look at them.  I feel like I have to hold onto them more to make up for him.  I named them Benjamin and Henry."

InfertilityBabies,3avo5i,LowOnHope,2,Wed Jun 24 05:10:14 2015 UTC,That was so beautifully written. Thank you for sharing. I'm sorry that you have to experience this at all but it sounds like you are a strong woman who has chosen not to let this experience define you.  I'm sorry your friends and family let you down. We are here for you. You belong here. You are one of us. I understand if it's difficult to post here but know I'll be thinking of you.

InfertilityBabies,3aukor,cakegroove,7,Tue Jun 23 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"Ack! It certainly sounds like the company may be planning to do something similar again... Bastards.  I would have a sit-down with your boss and ask him to clarify what he thinks will happen, both during your leave and once you return.  Leave the length of the leave out of the conversation - if he tries to badger you about the length of the leave, redirect back to talking about how things will be covered.  In the scheme of things, covering things for 9 weeks versus 10 weeks is not THAT different from a managerial perspective.  I would also get a little nasty and say that if he so values having me in his department, then certainly he can understand the importance of allowing me time to heal from childbirth and bond with a newborn before returning to work full-time.  Every time I think about how awful maternity ""leave"" is in the US, I start getting stabby.  Everything is so backward and horrible, and companies get away with the worst stuff."
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,septicidal,3,Tue Jun 23 17:42:11 2015 UTC,"Yes this sounds like a plan. I'm having twins...so who knows how long I will REALLY be off...I would hope I can carry to term, not have any complications or bed rest...he has two children under the age of 3 so he has to know this is going to be up in the air...  Yes our maternity leave is HORRIBLE!!!"
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,hopefaithandlove,4,Tue Jun 23 18:08:51 2015 UTC,Maternity leave in the US is scary. In Ontario they can't ask you when you are coming back as you are guaranteed your year off. As a teacher my union further protects that I go back into a similar position to the one I'd hold when I leave.   I hope you figure this out and get a lawyer if there's anything illegal going on. Or at least hint that you will consult one if they continue to give you grief.
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,revangelfire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"I second this, hearing stories like this one makes be grateful for Canadian mat leave even if it still isn't the best out there. Seriously, no company would get away with something like that after a year even. It isn't even a question.   So I can't offer OP any advice, only that I hate her bosses for doing that and it's awful she only gets 10 weeks!"
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,MrsDragon,3,Wed Jun 24 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"Is your company large enough to be covered by FMLA? If so, that gives you a little bit of protection.   I agree with /u/septicidal that you need to sit down and talk with him about expectations. I don't know what your relationship with him is like, but be prepared for a fingers in ear response. I have a pretty good relationship with my manager and I've been really surprised by how uncommunicative he's been around my leave. Every time I try to bring up planning, he just shuts down. In my case, I honestly think that he's expecting me to quit and he just doesn't want to think about it. (He has a stay at home wife.) It's VERY frustrating.   If you have a good HR person, it might also help to have them in the conversation. Play that as ""I just want to make sure we are all on the same page"". That way they can have the conversation with your boss about ""we can't legally fire her..."" and it doesn't have to come from you.   Also as part of the conversation, discuss your plan for coverage. ""Hey, [boss] the other day it sounded like you were concerned about making sure my tasks would be covered while I was out. Let's plan to sit down and talk about how that will be handled. Hearing that you have some specific ideas may put his mind at ease.  I am so sorry you have to deal with this. I get so angry at the way parenthood is approached in the workplace in general and the way the US deals with new parents is infuriating."
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,MrsDragon,3,Tue Jun 23 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"yes we have FMLA. It only protects me being an employee here though, not keeping my current position.    I actually did go talk to our HR manager. I like her, and she was a good listener but not very helpful. She understood my concerns but said that it really all did come down to how long I was going to be out. I share a high traffic/visibility position with one other person and it really would be difficult for him to do it on his own"
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,ThatGreenSolGirl,3,Tue Jun 23 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"FMLA also says that they have to give you your same position--or one that is equivalent--when you return from leave. So it's a small protection, but it is something to keep in mind.  I understand that your company has to keep things moving, but the only thing how long you are going to be out for should be a factor in is in how to cover the position. For instance, for a two week vacation maybe they could skate by without doing anything. For a month, maybe your duties get divided among other employees, for 2-3 months maybe they bring in a contractor/temp agency. But it should not impact whether or not you get to keep your job and it's shitty that they are making you feel that way!  One way to look at it, what is the cost of ""letting"" you take the leave vs the cost of hiring and training a new person? Since your boss has said you are valuable, that should be an argument in favor of leave with a temporary plan being better for the company in the long run. It's really awful to play the ""not fair to everyone else"" card. You would cover for them if they needed back surgery or had to care for someone in their family, people just like to pretend that pregnancy is somehow magically different."
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,marieelaine03,2,Tue Jun 23 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"Couldn't they hire a temp to fill in the gaps? I know that's something that companies do but not all. In my case a permanent hire was made to replace me and I was relegated to being her assistant. When she no longer needed my help (when my child was 6 months old) I was let go. My boss/company owner was a sexist old man who told me that I wouldn't want to come back when I told him I was pregnant.  I was back in my office at 6 weeks but doing a lot of work from home, which was preagreed upon. No FMLA since it was a 10 person company, so I just took my unemployment and decided fuck it, we'll make it work on one income because I'm not doing this again. The law guarantees that you get an equivalent position, so I would ask for your official job title and duty sheet so that when if they try to stick you with something else you can show them it is not equivalent. Maternity leave in the US is BULLSHIT. And yet you have so many women drinking the kool-aid squawking ""it's not your company's duty help you"". /rant"
InfertilityBabies,3aukor,healthylurker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:16:45 2015 UTC,"Ok I just want to say that in Canada we get 12 months maternity leave and all companies plan for this and deal with it. Also, men get 5 weeks paternity leave. Companies also accept this and deal with it.  There are 3 women on maternity leave in my department now. Guess what? We had 3 temporary job postings and found 3 temporary replacements.  One woman even made a deal with our boss....she will take 2 years of materniy and her job is still guaranteed when she comes back.   I know each job environment is different, but I can't help feeling that your bosses are gigantic asses. They are punishing you for having children, and that is ridiculous!  I don't have any advice but wish you the best of luck!!  edit do people never take off 3 -4 weeks in one shot? Someone in my department got married and took 4 weeks off for the wedding and honeymoon.  We all had a bit of extra work on our plates but you know what? That month flew by and we were ok!  I can't believe your boss is giving you a hard time for 10 weeks!   Makes me angry for you!"

I did some emailing HR yesterday to start really planning for my ""maternity leave"" (in reality it feels like maternity punishment, or ""fuck you for wanting to have a baby""). I love my workplace, but I HATE HATE HATE the shadowy multi-national greedy corporation that's probably run by Dick Cheney that actually employs me. What I wouldn't give to be an actual hospital employee. Grrrr."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,lancealittle,2,Tue Jun 23 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"They are starting to ask me my plan for maternity leave and I'm not even due until the end of November!  We also discussed the potential for bed rest towards the end, because of my clotting disorder there is strong possibility this could happen.  However it's so frustrating as part of it feels like a guilt trip - that I should feel bad about my ""poor company"" being in the lurch for 6-12wks."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,jaina_jade,6,Tue Jun 23 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"I'm doing well -- just had my 15 week prenatal appt and the heart beat was there again (RELIEF!). Of course this makes me so happy and then 3 days later after every appointment, I'm back to ""something must be wrong"" mode. Last time at 11/12 weeks  I believe the heart rate was 150 bpm, it's now down to 130-140ish bpm. Is it normal for it to decrease?  And don't beat yourself up about the baby weight - I think we all are in denial a little bit (whether we're pregnant or not), aren't we? I thought I was looking alright at 15 weeks, but I caught a glimpse of myself in a video and omg the double chin is already making an appearance. You'll get to where you want to be no doubt! Sounds like you're doing all the right things."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,healthylurker,4,Tue Jun 23 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is normal for that fetal heartbeat to be all over the place, and I believe it peaks sometime at the end of the 1st tri and gradually slows (basically all the way until adulthood!)."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,lancealittle,5,Tue Jun 23 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"I had an unexpected appointment yesterday (all fine). I'm just a week ahead of you. The heart rate was reading between 145-151. I asked if that was a good one and she said as long as its over 110, and under 170, its considered normal. Seems quite the range to me!  Either way, our babies are very very close in beats per minute!"
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,Bibbityboo,3,Tue Jun 23 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"Fetal heart rates are just like ours, they go up and down with activity. As long as they are in the 125-150 range, it's totally normal. I know it's hard not to obsess over though. I still twitch a little when the boys' rate varies by just a few bpm."

InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,3,Tue Jun 23 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"Gals, talk to me about fenugreek. Did it work for you? How much were you taking (and in what form)? Did you have any side effects? Did your baby?  I started taking two 610mg capsules 3x a day (with food) yesterday morning. I've read it can start working in as little as 24 hours. I don't know about waking up to an increased supply, but I definitely woke up to an upset stomach. I'm worried it'll cause GI upset in the boys too."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,apanda1084,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"It worked a little for me, but it wasn't enough to overcome the hormone issues because of PCOS. But, I was told by my LC that it is basically like Metformin getting into your system - meaning GI issues, but it will level out. Make sure you are getting enough to eat and try to take them ~30mins after a decent meal. From what I have read, it doesn't transfer to the milk. That could be wrong, so just keep an eye on their poo."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,2,Tue Jun 23 15:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'm worried my supply is a lost cause and I'll never get to nurse. I'm battling against PCOS too, and preterm labor and a c-section. Boo :("
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,apanda1084,2,Tue Jun 23 18:15:07 2015 UTC,"Don't beat yourself up too much. You have a lot against you, but even if you were to stop now, your boys have received benefits from what you were able to do for them. FWIW, lactation cookies helped me the most out of everything I threw at the BF cause, and they were the most convenient, I forgot to take the fenugreek now and then."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"They get donor breast milk too, so they're getting benefits regardless of whether my supply is enough or not. And I'm so happy for that! But I really really want to nurse my babies. So I'm trying to do all I can :)"
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,traveler5678,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:35:37 2015 UTC,Are you on Metformin now?  I haven't breastfed yet but I got a prescription for Metformin from my doctor for when I have my baby because I read that Metformin is supposed to help with milk supply issues caused by PCOS.  Only trace amounts of Metformin are transferred to the breast milk.
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:37:21 2015 UTC,No. I can't handle metformin (even extended release). It wreaks absolute havoc on my digestive system unfortunately!

InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,nucleusaccumbi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:55:53 2015 UTC,are you trying to up your supply? I never took fenugreek but had success with other methods. Let me know if you'd like any advice :)
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:40:58 2015 UTC,Yup! I'm not producing much because I've got everything going against me! I'm eating and sleeping and hydrating and pumping almost every 2 hours -- just started fenugreek at my LC's request.
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,nucleusaccumbi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"ok here is what worked for me: CALORIES! Like not just eating healthy meals, eat LARGE meals, even with junk. The extra fat and calories sent my supply through the roof. Like ice cream every day, chips, etc. In addition to healthy stuff :) Plus high calorie dark beers- pump a few hours later when the alcohol's out of your system. Totally helps with supply! Good luck.   eta: oh, also eating a TON of lactation cookies!"
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"I definitely think part of my problem is not eating enough calories. I've added an ensure shake every morning, so at least that's 350 calories I wasn't getting before, but I'll try eating bigger meals and adding snacks between. Any suggestions other than chips and ice cream lol? I'm not good at eating (hence why I gained zero weight while pregnant)."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"Oooooh, yeah, eat lots. Smear peanut butter on the lactation cookies. If you're eating fresh veg, dip then in hummus. Larabars/cliff bars. Oatmeal for breakfast. Honestly, that's going to make a bigger difference than the fenugreek, if you're not eating ""enough"". Your caloric requirements for nursing are HIGHER than when you're pregnant.  Hang in there! Do you have an estimate on when the boys can try nursing?"
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,nucleusaccumbi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"Guess I'm going grocery shopping tomorrow!  In two weeks when they come off c-pap they'll start bottle feeding them (but the feeding tube will still be in place), and at that time I can start letting them nuzzle. They won't be strong or coordinated enough to nurse yet, but it'll at least get us used to each other. After that it's kind of a play-it-by-ear scenario as to when the feeding tubes come out and we can start replacing bottle feeds with nursing."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,razzertto,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:10:10 2015 UTC,"Aaaaah. I see. It always helps me to have a timeline! I bet it will be nice to have them at least hanging out with your nipples, and that won't be very long at all!"
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"oh man I am an eating EXPERT ;) Well, a vegetarian one anyway.  Like sandwiches? Why stop at one? How about whole wheat pizza with lots of veggies? oatmeal cookies! Mountains of homemade stirfries with brown rice. Scrambled eggs with cheese. Add olive oil LIBERALLY to everything! Rice pudding, Indian food, Thai food, Vietnamese- eating out will get you typically more calories than homemade! Seriously, it will help a TON. More than fenugreek I would guess. And it can be fun if you find the right stuff!  When I was home with my newborn and alone with her allll day long I'd go to whole foods with her and baically buy myself whatever the heck I wanted; whatever looked good. This definitely included on one occasion an entire box of chocolates, all for ME.   I gained 27 lbs while pregnant and lost every lb, even while eating like this. I do need to still lose my IVF weight, though, oh well."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:57:12 2015 UTC,Eat all the avocados (that's my trick)! And full fat dairy. I'm having a love affair with cheese and sour cream.
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,LowOnHope,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, fenugreek worked for me. I didn't notice any GI issues, but I started taking it right after baby was born, so my body was still all fucked up anyways. I take it with blessed thistle (jack Newman's recommendation). You need to be taking a whole lot more than that - 4500-6000mg a day. I take 2000mg 3x per day, with 1500mg of bt ( also 3x day)."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,spankyjubblies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:21:42 2015 UTC,Hm. I'll ask my LC about blessed thistle. She didn't mention it. Also the dose of fenugreek I'm taking is what she recommended. She said we'd reevaluate after a week :)

InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,SJP8,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:18:33 2015 UTC,I notice a huge difference with oatmeal. When I ate it daily I was at my max production.
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,talula79,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"When I first started having supply issues, I took 3 600mg capsules three times a day until my sweat smelled like maple syrup, then I went down to twice a day.  It would make me nauseous if I didn't take it with food, so I always had it with a snack. Empty stomachs and fenugreek don't mix.  That being said, while the fenugreek helped my supply, the Reglan I was taking helped more.  Hugs."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,Iamagnu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:26:23 2015 UTC,My LC said if the fenugreek doesn't do anything I should think about reglan next. Side note: my phone autocorrected reglan to rehab lol.
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,try_new_stuff,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"On top of eating more and the herbal supplements, really push for skin to skin time with your boys. I don't know your nicu's policies but skin to skin is good for them and good for you. Pump right after you put them back in bed to get the most out of the hormone boost. Also, make sure you are tracking total daily volumes not just looking at individual pumping vol because small increases per pumping can be hard to see but make a big difference to you overall supply. Also, as long as you keep up some pumping, even if you don't have a full supply for them, you'll be able to nurse at least some. Good luck and so glad your boys are doing well!"
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,Bibbityboo,2,Wed Jun 24 03:38:25 2015 UTC,"I have never been so happy to see a poop/pee explosion in my life.  We have been worried about feeding/dehydration issues because it would take her forever to latch on,and my milk is only just starting to come in, plus we had to supplement with formula a few times.  But this morning, after only 4 minutes on the boob, I hear a distinct farty noise, and she starts to freak out, she stinks, and, we saw poo in the diaper, which was fine, until she starts pooping again, and projectile urinated everywhere.  Boys aren't the only ones who pee everywhere!  If any of you plan to get the Hemnes dresser for your babies (highly recommended, its cute and cheap), get the optional glass top cover.  So glad I didnt let my husband talk me out of that decision."

InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,PrincessCBHammock,4,Wed Jun 24 03:09:55 2015 UTC,"So, I just need to rant. Sorry for the outburst.  I'm feeling so much pressure to be a certain way while pregnant, and I find you guys such a relief. We've only been telling people over the last couple of weeks (waited for the harmony test results). We've told my in-laws, my bor & SIL, my husband's closest aunt and uncle and a handful of friends. We haven't told anyone in my family because I was waiting for my closest relative, my cousin. He's a marine biologist and is out on the boats.  Well, my MIL is really, really upset that I""m not letting her tell any more family members or anything (and we're the ones telling, sorry). But, I don't think its fair that my family be the last to know after all the extended family on this side knows, you know? So I've told her she has to wait. She responded with ""Well, someone has to find out last!"" Sorry, its not going to be my family. And she was literally in tears. She did apologize about an hour later, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm feeling SO MUCH PRESSURE. I am disappointing them in not being excited enough, in not being showy enough all of that.  Flash forward a week. I get word my cousin will be back from the ships this weekend. Great! I make plans to see him (& wife), and my Aunt (I only have 6 family members), my husband has some relatives who live close to them so we'll tell at teh same time AND its by the clinic we used so we'll be off to give them a thank you. I""m really looking forward to this.  Oh wait. What's that? My In Laws happen to be going that weekend too?? (I do think its a coincidence). So my MIL talks to Hubby, who caves at the drop of a hat on EVERYTHING, and suggests we come to a lunch they're having with all his extended family so we can make the announcement. Now, these are people we were planning on telling that weekend anyways. BUT I do not like being the centre of attention. I was really looking forward to telling one-on-one. ANd I really need a goddamn break from my in-laws. I wanted to treat it as a weekend away (I work and commute with my FIL and we are living in their basement suite while we house hunt. I literally cannot go more than 10 hours without seeing one of them).  Cue hormonal crying. Quiet husband who thinks I should be flexible and if we don't do it when MIL wants it, then we'd be lying because we have no reason not to. It was a long fucking night. In the end, he conceeded that we didn't have to, but I can tell he's upset about it. I feel like once again, I'm a disappointment to everyone because I don't want big dramatic announcements, I don't want to be the centre of attention, I just want to have a nice visit and tell individually. Ugh.  Sorry, just really needed to rant."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,Bibbityboo,3,Tue Jun 23 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Hell, at this point I'd almost consider just sending MIL's family a Facebook message to tell them so she can't keep up the dramatics. It's your pregnancy, not hers. If she gets her way on this, what's next? Big flashy baby shower? Demanding to be in the delivery room? Husband really needs to do whatever makes it easiest on you. You don't need this nonsense right now."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,apanda1084,2,Tue Jun 23 16:24:59 2015 UTC,Husband really needs to do whatever makes it easiest on you. You don't need this nonsense right now.   I agree here. Maybe when things are calm for a moment pull your husband to the side and try to get him to understand how you are feeling and express he really needs to get on board or start meeting you in the middle.
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,apanda1084,2,Tue Jun 23 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"But, I guess I struggle because its also my husband's first child, so do my feelings trump his? On the one hand I think ""Hell yes."" I""ve gone through all the IVF procedures, I'm the one going through all the hormones and strange body experiences.... but then, is that fair? I do really want him to start meeting me in the middle though (and without it feeling like a struggle).  Once we move out, I know it will be a million times better. Sadly, that's af ew months away."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,SJP8,3,Tue Jun 23 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"To an extent, yes. You cannot walk around not getting enough rest and with high BP or not eating enough, ect. How important is this to you? How much stress will caving in cause you? This is really one of those pick your battles moment, but from what I can tell this is very important. It is your call on how far you chose to push, but I can see resentment (at least from what you have shared), forming a mile away."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,apanda1084,2,Tue Jun 23 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"I do feel resentful, and I hate that. I hate that I feel less close to my husband in this moment, which is something completely new. I hate that I grew up alone (child of abuse), and now that I'm married, I should feel like my husband will always have my back and I don't have to be alone. But I felt so alone last night, when we were arguing about this.  I'm also frustrated because I spent my whole childhood trying to be a people pleaser because I thought then everything would be ok (hint, it didn't work). So now, I feel like I""m being pushed into that role again and it feels...bad.  I've tried to tell him before how his family can be sufficating. They're not bad people overall, its just they are so close and they always do everything together and always do everything according to their traditions... When you grow up very independent, it feels like you get swallowed up in that. I don't think he can understand.  Honestly, there's a part of me that wonders if we shouldn't get some therapy. He thinks once we move out into our own space again that things will resolve themselves."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,vibeee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"I relate completely to coming into a close family when mine was not, (I was also forced to be independent), that took years to adjust to. If you feel like you cannot express how you feel effectively or he just will not fully ""get"" it, you may need some couple's counseling. Make sure you do it before the baby because that will be another stress on your relationship. In the mean time, stand your ground, if you're a people pleaser normally maybe he will see this as not usual behavior and begin to take you more seriously."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,becabecaful,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"I very much recommend therapy! It should help you sort through your feelings, understand where each one of your is coming from, and give you some tools to work together on this.

InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,vibeee,3,Tue Jun 23 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"FUUUUCK your MIL. I don't care how excited she is, this isn't her announcement to make and you do it on the way you want, with whom you want, when you want. Someone needs to tell her that asap or I will!,"
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,becabecaful,2,Tue Jun 23 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"Dude, rant away. That really fucking sucks. It really sucks that they're being assholes and not respecting how you want to do things. In my book they're the ones who are the disappointment. This isn't about your MIL, and how dare she try to make it about her???  Also, I suspect this won't be the last time this kind of shit happens - so you and husband need to get on the same page NOW about them pressuring you guys and how to deal with it."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,Iamagnu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't want to let her make it about her. Really, really don't. And she's not a bad person when there's nothing going on, but the minute I got pregnant... BAM.  I also feel guilty though, because its my husband's first child too. So I worry I'm being selfish by wanting to do it my way. But honestly, I don't know what way he wants to do it truly. He is ALWAYS swayed by his folks."
InfertilityBabies,3au0ni,messofletters,2,Tue Jun 23 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"You are not a disappointment. You are allowed to do things your way without that being a disappointment. Your MIL had her baby/ies. She's probably trying you show her excitement and doing it wrong. But that is her mistake, not yours. You don't have to be the one to suck it up.  Look, my experience is that most husbands have fee things that they really care about during the pregnancy. So we basically did things the way I wanted to do them, except for the things my husband cared about, then we did them his way or compromised. You know who has a day in how you do things? You and your husband. You know who doesn't unless specifically asked? Your MIL. Period.  Will she like it? No. Does she need to get over herself? Yes. This is really good training for when you'll get all kinds of ""nice"" people telling you how to raise your baby, and you're the baby's only advocate (with your husband). It's really good to start practising setting those boundaries now.  With my husband, what worked for us was to agree on things beforehand, and then when my MIL tried/tries to convince him otherwise, he knows he needs to stick to the plan. Or at least talk to me before making a commitment. We've also had to work on him being willing to put my feelings before his mom's. Not easy to do, but we're getting there... And it's really been worth it to us."

My husband has been staying up late playing video games and subsequently getting up later-than-ideal for our morning routine.  It's really frustrating, especially since I haven't been sleeping well and getting up in the morning has been extra difficult for me.

My mat leave doesn't officially start until Friday,  but I'm going to ask for a sweep anyway,  because if the placenta isn't good,  I sorta figure it'll do better out than in at this point.   Anyone else have a case of a mysterious shrinking baby? (I know it's not actually shrinking, but falling off its growth curve) care to share some stories?

InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,healthylurker,6,Tue Jun 23 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"I have heard horrible things about Babies R Us registries getting screwed up, not being useable, etc.  The advice I was given about bottles was to get just one of a few different types (with the slowest flow nipples) because some babies don't like certain bottles, or if you are breastfeeding, it may be difficult to switch from one type of bottle to the breast. Purchase more once you know what works for you and the baby.  Clothing wise... If people buy clothes they will usually buy whatever they think is cute and ignore the registry. Plus the clothes you register for now might not be available in a few months when people are buying things from the registry."
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,septicidal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:59:02 2015 UTC,Great advice thanks! I've also heard mixed reviews on babies r us but where I live there really aren't a lot of other extensive options. Where are you registering?
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,septicidal,2,Tue Jun 23 01:02:47 2015 UTC,"I'm only planning to do an Amazon registry.  My relatives who prefer to shop in physical stores all live in a different part of the country, and don't have the same store options available. And I know most of the people who would want to give us something would just write checks, because that's just how our families are.  If I felt compelled to register at a physical store, I would register at Target because supposedly they are much better about accepting returns/exchanges without receipts, and their store band formula and diapers are generally well liked."
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,DookieSandwich,6,Tue Jun 23 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"Totally cool to add books.  We read to our daughter way before she could even see the book.  She really started enjoying looking and listening around 5/6 months, so books fit in your birth to one year plan."
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,ivf_lizz,5,Tue Jun 23 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"The reason for multiple nipples is because as the baby gets older, they will want/need to get at the milk faster.  But you'll only need the slow flow ones at first. As for how many bottles you need,  it depends on how much you're planning on breast feeding vs bottle feeding.  If you can figure out how to pump directly to freezer bags,  you can warm up the milk faster, and need fewer actual bottles.   If you want to use both Amazon and babies are us and also other places,  take a look at babyli.st"
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,larabair,3,Tue Jun 23 01:15:49 2015 UTC,"Babyli.st!! I swear by it. Then people can buy what they like from Amazon, Target, BrU, Buy Buy Baby, etc.  It also prevents things like a shower I went to where the parents to be registered for something at BrU that was $5 cheaper at Amazon, and I had to ask the dad to delete it from the BrU list so at least the mom would be surprised. You can also ask for general things - we asked for hand-me-down clothes, to borrow stuff, for any books - and people could register for such things without us specifying.   We also registered for one each of multiple bottles to find one that works best for us, our daycare, and bitty bair before buying a specific set. We have friends who picked and registered for brand x, and it turned out their baby hated the nipples, so they had to start over from square one.   Also check out Lucie's List for more ideas.   We have a separate hidden Amazon wish list for things we hope family can get BB as he gets bigger.   Don't register for clothes unless you have specifics in mind. We didn't tell people his gender and said on our baby list that if people bought clothes and they were not organic cotton we would return it. We were sort of asses about it. But that's because every shower we know of, all people gave were cute pink or blue outfits, and nothing from the registry!   Likewise make sure to have a LOT of stuff on there. My sister in law made some comment once about how she always buys something not on the registry if nothing ""speaks to her,"" which pissed me off - but I guess is normal. So register for a lot of stuff."
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,larabair,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:12:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the info!  I've heard so much about babyli.st but I'm still a little confused. I get its a universal list, but let's say I have an item from BRU and I add it on there. But it's so much cheaper at target or amazon. How does that work? It still allows the person to buy it elsewhere? Do I have to add it from all 3 stores?  And I wonder how it works for those who aren't exactly technologically-savy...."
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,nucleusaccumbi,2,Tue Jun 23 01:21:48 2015 UTC,"You register for an item. It will check Amazon, BrU, etc and give links to all the stores to buy it from. The purchaser has to mark on baby list that they purchased the item. If you have someone who is decent with the internet you can just ask them to help folks out. My SIL isn't really techy and had no issues getting folks to use it - and we didn't have any dupes or issues!"

InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,honmamichin,3,Tue Jun 23 13:38:57 2015 UTC,"I would think your favorite childrens books would be appropriate, guests would understand. I'm guessing the worker at BRU tipped you off about the clothing? I used to work at a TRU/BRU store and the reason we tell people that is because the clothes are always changing (especially if you register more than a couple months before your shower), the registry doesn't print pictures for most clothing, and the names given are impossible for non employees to decipher. So yes, don't register for specific clothing, let your guests pick out whatever they want for clothes. I just put a note on my registry that I wanted any clothes up to 12 months.  Also if you've heard anything ""bad"" about BRU registries it's usually due to a few reasons. One is someone was scanning items incorrectly. ONLY scan the UPC printed on the box itself, not the shelf tag and not stickers on the box with other barcodes. Some bigger boxes, like for strollers and such have so many different bar codes it gets confusing. Another is that the inventory seems to churn a lot, so something you scanned 2 months ago might be clearanced out and impossible to get in store. In my case that was maybe 5% of my registry, but I'd asume the same happens at other stores. Also depending on the store cashiers don't always know how to take the items off registry correctly, causing other problems. Sometimes it might be due to a crappy scanner that crashes without saving, but this almost never went down at my store. The registry itself is no different than doing it at Target, I did mine at BRU and it went off without a hitch, so don't let people scare you out of it. If you don't want to do it with a scanner in store you can also do it online, or start it in store/online and add to it in store/online vice versa all that good stuff. Most people seem to do the big 3, Babies R Us (or Buy Buy Baby if it's closer), Target, and Amazon."
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,cakegroove,3,Tue Jun 23 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"My advice on the bottles has been covered pretty much.  On the children's books--add them!! Z was into books way before she was 12 months and a bed time story has been part of her bed time routine since...I actually don't even remember. Probably around 4 months (when we really finalized a bedtime routine). She loooooooves books now and we read one or two before every nap and bed time. I do highly suggest choosing board book copies to start with because they are going to get chewed/drooled on. Also it's easier for babies to turn the pages once they are able to do that. We registered on Amazon and Babies R Us. I generally decided which list to put things on based on price and availability, but did put some things on both lists. Most of the people buying us things were out of state anyway and many didn't have a Babies R Us near them so we got stuff from both. If you don't mind doing a few returns and doing twice as much work, you could just duplicate the list on both sites. But it's a hassle. If you want to put clothes on the registry, why not? I personally don't see a problem with it! But people will likely buy whatever they want."
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,nucleusaccumbi,2,Tue Jun 23 02:00:04 2015 UTC,"I have nothing to add about bottles that hasn't already been covered here, except for that your baby will determine whether they like a certain brand of bottle/nipple. Don't go crazy with buying a lot of one brand because you may find yourself switching brands. When I had my shower for my son, I asked that everyone bring a book instead of a card, and to write a note inside of the book.  I still find it neat to break out a book and see a handwritten note from someone who was at my shower in it. Cards get lost. You'll keep the books a long time. I recommend Amazon for registering!  Although older people in the family don't frequent the internet and want to physically see the stuff in a store.  People will buy whatever clothes they see that are cute! I wouldn't bother, except for maybe some multi-pack onesies and socks"
InfertilityBabies,3arxs6,larabair,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"we registered on babyli.st and amazon only. There is no necessity to do BRU, but it is slightly more convenient for some people who aren't big online shoppers. We were very happy avoiding it!  We got a whole bunch of bottles and regret it. Our baby was huge on nursing and wasn't big on the bottles we bought, and we had to try like 6 different brands before finding one she liked for daycare. Then we only needed like 3 of them. We're left with a shit-ton of glass bottles we just don't need! We've also only ever used slow flow. If I could do it again, I would've just bought like 2 bottles and 2 nipples and figured out things from there.   We put barely any clothing on our registries, just like maybe 5 super adorable high quality things that we realllllly wanted. We got SO much clothing otherwise! So yeah, don't put a ton on.   I started buying books from my childhood years before she was born. Go for it!"

I registered (privately) at individual stores for the completion discounts at the end and babyli.st allowed me to keep items organized so I was buying them from the cheapest source. Target had the best prices 9/10 times, Amazon was a close second, but not all of their items allow for the completion discount and even though I didn't like BRU's prices, I am so glad I decided to register there because I ended up with a ton of their gift cards and was so relieved to at least get my completion discount to offset the pricing a little.   Also, no, don't put clothes on there unless they are a just for you to buy kinda thing. 1. The season might not be appropriate for the item when your LO can wear it. 2. No one, I repeat NO ONE will buy the ones on your registry. 3. That item may not even be available even a week or so down the road. It is just a waste of time. The only clothes I put on mine are those packs of white Gerber onesies, those never go away. Oh and the books thing, I put my childhood favorites on there and did the request books instead of cards - I trash greeting cards, so they are such a waste."

InfertilityBabies,3aqufm,MrsDragon,4,Mon Jun 22 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"My HR person sent me FMLA paperwork that my OB's nurse filled out. This was for when I went part time. Then, when put on hospital bed rest, she filled out another copy of the same paperwork updating it to full time. It read something like, ""effective immediately until delivery."" This meant it didn't need to be updated again.   I'm pissed for you. Bed rest is stressful enough. You're already worried about baby not to mention feeling like you're letting everyone down. I knew my focus needed to be on keeping my babies in and not worrying about work. Nothing pissed me off more than hearing from my boss. She sent emails saying things like, ""If you're up for it, please do blah, blah, blah. No pressure!"" WTF? Back off, bitch. I'm in the scariest situation of my life. LEAVE ME ALONE! She was fired while I was on leave which was very satisfying!   FMLA paperwork is there only to protect you. Request that form and have your doc fill it out.   I'm sorry you're on bed rest. That's when I started watching Orange is the New Black and House of Cards. Check those out if you haven't already!"
InfertilityBabies,3aqufm,NBPTS,2,Tue Jun 23 01:14:13 2015 UTC,"When you filled out the FMLA paperwork, esp for going part time, did that count against your 12 weeks total leave?  Part of the reason that I want to work from home right now is that I'm a little nervous that if I use up all of my FMLA time before I deliver, they may just decide it's easier to fill my position. (It's not a major concern, but it does make me a little uneasy.)  I like the ""effective immediately until delivery"", that sounds like it saves much running around. :)  I actually like working, it fills the time nicely and keeps me on a schedule (I tend to turn vampire with no fixed schedule and I need sunlight to function well, so it's not a good combo.). I just find the administrative hoops obnoxious. We're really shorthanded right now, so you would think they would be super accommodating to keep me working, but it's like they want to push me onto short term disability."
InfertilityBabies,3aqufm,NBPTS,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"I never had the chance to work part time. My doc filled out the paper work and I had one important date I needed to get through so I kept working full time for 5 days more than my doc wanted. I'm a teacher and I felt like I owed it to my students to press on as long as I could.  Then I went into preterm labor at school and that was it. I was on hospital bed rest for the next 4 weeks. I'll forever regret not listening to my doc sooner.   My plan had been to use my sick days as long as I could. I had enough saved up for two weeks of part time at full pay. Then, they would start docking my pay based on my hourly wage figured out by my salary divided by the number of contract days.   It's my understanding that FMLA cannot be part time. Once you are on leave, you are on leave. They can't ask anything of you. That is your time with your family. If you're working part time, your FMLA hasn't really started. I ended up taking 13 weeks before my contract time was up. Work said they weren't going to hire someone for that last week so they just gave it to me. I went into labor on Valentine's Day and didn't get paid until the next august.  Does that make sense? Maybe they can pay you part time until you deliver at which point your FMLA would begin."

Five nights in the hospital and released with vague orders of ""take it easy"".   I rely on public transportation to get to work, and I have no clue if all the standing I did waiting for various buses during the day triggered something, so I asked my doctor if he would be willing to sign a letter if needed to allow me to work from home. He said he would.  Work was very accommodating and never asked for any paperwork from my doctor. For what it's worth, I work in the IT field, so the type of work I do is easily transferred and the culture supports it.  I'm so sorry for the stress that you've been given over this.

Generally speaking at least 85% of my job is pure sitting in front of my computer and it's not the end of the world (imo) to reorder tasks so that I handle some more computer stuff while someone else takes point on the eyeballs on details. I can do webex meetings, call the guys in the shop, review photos, etc. We've had an engineer work from home for something like 6 weeks before when he had back surgery, so it's not unprecedented, even within our department. We just had a little less forewarning this time.  Passive aggressive is my company's communication mo for sure. It's something that's driven me crazy for years, but management doesn't recognize it as a problem so it's never addressed."

I'm sorry to hear that. : / I've been appalled by the state of maternity/paternity leave and support for years on general principle alone. I have to say, actually being pregnant and dealing with the bs that is coming with it, is making me even angrier. And then people wonder why STEM's pipeline is leaking women. Hey, maybe because y'all are being asses? Grrrrr....  So far so good! I surprised my doctor by having my cervix lengthen back out a little after two weeks of bed rest so they told me to continue on. I have my next follow up appointment next week, so fingers crossed!"

I've had several moments of doubt during all of this if it would be better to ditch everything and take up a new career. I'm lucky that the place I work for actually has maternity leave. The state of maternity/paternity leave in this country is shameful though, and having to figure out childcare to return to work on top of this? I don't know if you have planned it out yet, but I still don't have a clue what we will do with our littles. So stressful."

I can echo with my uneducated ""they'll probably just supplement you"" and that over 10 is good enough to prevent loss right now, but holy shit you are pregnant!! Fantastic!

InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,lancealittle,4,Mon Jun 22 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't introduced myself over here yet, but this happened to me. Betas were good, but my progesterone was dropping despite suppositories 3 x a day. Now I'm on suppositories and PIO injections. That did the trick, and I'm now 9 weeks. My pharmacist said that some people just don't absorb the progesterone in certain forms, and it's pretty common."
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,logisticaladventure,2,Mon Jun 22 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of PIO for this is better than just ""a chance"" since I am terrified of it."

InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,logisticaladventure,2,Mon Jun 22 16:27:46 2015 UTC,How many times did they test before they decided on that?
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,logisticaladventure,3,Mon Jun 22 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"It wasn't until my progesterone dropped below 10 on the third beta. It started at 12, and went down to 9. I wish they'd started the PIO at beta #1. Maybe you can push for it?"
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,eliwhi,2,Mon Jun 22 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"It's what I am going to do, yes.  They didn't want to test until Thursday but I had a vacation planned and I want a contingency plan and there was no time to get results let alone get a plan together.  Did they test yours 48 hrs apart?   They said that was too close to see if 3x would work.  (I don't think it will and since this was our last chance, I will be a bitch if I have to.)  wish they had tested my P with the first beta like they did last time, we would have two numbers by now.   At what dp did you end up starting the PIO?"
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,larabair,2,Mon Jun 22 23:53:29 2015 UTC,"I started PIO at 16dp5dt, and they had been comparing numbers 48 hours apart, but I have always been on suppositories 3 times a day. It's a bit inconvenient, but I'm relieved it's worked. I'm done when I reach 10 weeks this Friday.  Good on you for being a strong advocate for what you feel is right! Starting supplements will probably fix all of this. Keep me updated, and congratulations!"
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,hopefaithandlove,3,Tue Jun 23 02:44:49 2015 UTC,Do you lay down after you put the suppositories in? My first time using them no one told me to so I put them in and went to work where they would ooze out and my body wouldn't absorb any. Second time the nurse told me I was suppose to be laying down for a minimum of 30 minutes after putting them in. She suggested I set an alarm for hour-45 minutes before my normal wake up time and put them in and go back to bed. Then find time to lay down after I took them in the evening. You think this would have been something they told me the first time (second pregnancy). It just added to my list of what ifs.
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,dizzyvonblue,2,Mon Jun 22 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. I woke up a touch early, put them in, went back to bed for 15'. Then put the night dose in right at bedtime. I still had some leakage but nothing too bad."

I don't generally feel any oozing for a while after."
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"Can I ask you about this, my pro. level today at 17 DPO was 13 so they started me on those suppositories twice a say.   I inserted mine, then took a nap for around 2 hours. When I got up I felt like lots of it came out. Is that similar to how it was for you?  My husband gets up around 5-5:30 and I get up at 7am so I plan to insert mine each morning when he gets up then lay back down."
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,vibeee,2,Tue Jun 23 01:45:02 2015 UTC,They told me to shove them way up here with my second time using them. My third time using them they gave me an applicator which was like when you have a yeast infection and you put that little egg in. You sat the suppository in it and inserted it up there. If you don't have an insert I would try and push it back as far as you can.
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,vibeee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"I don't have an applicator, but I do think I have some 5ever old sealed preseed applicators. The little capsule is small, and I bet it would work."

InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,larabair,2,Mon Jun 22 23:59:11 2015 UTC,You can't cause any harm by taking extra progesterone.  Better be safe than sorry.  Your number is not even alarmingly low but you don't want it to start dropping.  I am really excited for you!  I hope it works this time!  Edit: a letter
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,dedicednu,3,Tue Jun 23 01:52:23 2015 UTC,Was the progesterone level taken while fasting? The blood levels of progesterone fluctuate wildly throughout the day and are more reliable if done before eating in the morning.  They will likely recommend that you go on additional progesterone in some form since higher levels of progesterone can't hurt an early pregnancy but if the levels are too low it can.  Sending lots of hugs and support!

InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,tina3times,3,Mon Jun 22 23:56:49 2015 UTC,My RE has always said that my progesterone levels would test low always when on a suppository. But he said it wouldn't matter because the progesterone was going straight where it mattered most.
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,becabecaful,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:28:20 2015 UTC,Were your numbers like mine? Under the 20 they expect non-medicated?
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,longsnapper,2,Mon Jun 22 22:59:45 2015 UTC,I never had a blood draw for progesterone. Their reasoning being that it would be low so why test it?
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,Bhotel21,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:26:35 2015 UTC,Interesting.
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,SJP8,3,Tue Jun 23 13:40:10 2015 UTC,"Did you hear back from the nurses?  I was on suppositories and they never checked my blood level - in this case the progesterone stays below and doesn't really enter the bloodstream. But PIO might be on the agenda.   Also CONGRATS, I am crossing all my fingers and toes for you!!"
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,SJP8,2,Mon Jun 22 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"I had low progesterone levels, too. I don't remember how low, but I was the maximum allowed dose for about two or three weeks. I was taking suppositories twice a day and an injection every other day (it started out every day but I passed out during one injection so the doctor changed it).  Once I hit the second trimester, though, the placenta (forgive me if that's wrong) takes over and progesterone doesn't really matter anymore.  It's not something a lot of pregnant women need to do, but at least it's short term and I have a healthy baby boy because of it! It's nerve wracking, for sure, but you're doing everything you can and it'll be worth it!"
InfertilityBabies,3aq0wc,KatiexS,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"That's right, it only matters now.  But it matters a lot right now.   The nurse, the one you only talk to in the phone, wanted to know if I had forgotten to take my P, so it may not be absorbed but I still need double blood levels to not be totally stressed it'll fail again."
InfertilityBabies,3aqhmh,RositaYouBitch,3,Mon Jun 22 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"You just stop breast feeding and start pumping. You can keep breast milk at room temp for up to 4 hours so if you are going some where you could pump right before and take that. I would just talk bags and ask for hot water wherever we were at if we needed a bottle. Milk heats faster in the bag than it will in a bottle, fyi. We had 6-4oz bottles and 8-8oz bottles with our oldest and used the same with the twins. I personally feel that was too much for us because we hand washed the bottles right after use so we could have done 4 each and been good. As for when to pump, you just do it when your boobs hurt. If you are trying to build a supply start with maybe every 2 hours. My bestie when to a class on increasing supply and the LC said to pump during commercials for a 30 minute period off and on during the day. You'll find what works and you will do it for as long as is right for you. We stopped pumping with my oldest when we had no more room for the milk in the freezer. With the twins we stopped when I couldn't keep up with one bottle to feed them in a day and we were mostly formula.   Edit: additional information  I used a Freemie to pump in the car and at work. It just goes in your bra and hooks to a Medela pump. Before I had the Freemie I would just take my pump and sit in the backseat. Maybe pump while husband drove, or I would skip a pumping and be uncomfortable for a while."
InfertilityBabies,3aqhmh,eliwhi,3,Mon Jun 22 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"You can also pump after a feed (so you know you're not shorting him) and use that to get ahead of him (depending on your breast storage capacity, you may need a couple pumps to get to a feed). Then once you give a bottle, pump to make up for the feed.  Remember that dairy takes 2 full weeks to come out of your system, so if the gassiness continues with the bottle and it hasn't been 2 weeks, don't start eating dairy again yet! (Although true dairy intolerance is apparently rare - I did need to cut out onions, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, stuff along those lines for a bit when Isaac was smaller because they gave him gas. I think I cut it out for 3 weeks, and then he had grown enough when I tried them again that he was ok. My ped recommended trying that first before dairy. She also said some babies can be sensitive to garlic.)  If you're interested in possibly coming back to BF, try paced bottle feeding (actually, with a gassy baby you probably want to do paced feeding anyways). We did this with Isaac when he was getting a lot of bottles. We use Medela Calma nipples - supposed to be like the real thing (good if you want to come back to boob), make them suck, etc. That's not the only model that is supposed to be like a nipple, so something to consider.  For cleaning bottled and nipples, we use the dishwasher on the sanitize setting, and got a little basket for the top rack for nipples, caps, etc. Super convenient, and way easier than washing it all by hand and then sterilizing.   I pump into bottles, measure it out into feeding sizes or freezing sizes, and put it in the fridge. I don't usually freeze milk every day, but every few days, in batches (I warm the milk first to mix it back together - breast milk separates in the fridge. Don't be freaked out!)  Remember that you can totally add milk to a bottle on the go, but it needs to be the same temp - so, warm to warm, cold to cold.   I really like the Kellymom site for info! http://kellymom.com/category/bf/pumpingmoms/  Good luck! I pump and BF - would be happy to send you my long list of ways to make pumping better if you're interested. <3"
InfertilityBabies,3aqhmh,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jun 22 23:38:59 2015 UTC,"I had twins and had to exclusively pump for my daughter after a while. I kept nursing my son then I'd pump for my daughter. If he takes a bottle well, just stop nursing. I remember the last time I nursed my daughter. We were both in tears. I finally just said, ""that's it."" I gave her a bottle of a mix of breast milk and formula and pumped right then. That's how I got ahead. Whatever I pumped went to her next bottle. I pumped every three hours during the day and every 4 hours at night. I did this even after she started sleeping through the night. It was the only way I could make enough for the two of them. Every morning I'd have a little stash in the fridge and we'd go through it throughout the day. Usually her last bottle needed to be topped off with formula. Then I'd catch back up again overnight.   By about 6 months, their demand got higher and I started skipping one of my night pumpings so I could sleep more. I continued pumping but had to top off all their bottles with formula. For a while she'd get about 70% breastmilk, then 50%. We did this until they were 13 months old. I figured some breastmilk was better than none.   Good luck! It was a very emotional decision for me but I don't regret it one bit. Breastmilk in a bottle was the best option for her."
InfertilityBabies,3aqhmh,NBPTS,2,Tue Jun 23 01:30:59 2015 UTC,I pump at least 4-6 times per day and the babies are 50/50 bottle and boob. I have a Medela symphony pump rented from the hospital and a pump in style advanced for when I go back to work.   Pump right before you leave the house if you're going out. As eliwhi said you can leave milk out for 4-6 hours (use a sniff test after 4 hours). I find that bottles themselves can start to smell so I run them through the dishwasher. I have about 20 bottles and usually go through 10 per day (5 each).   I'd recommend a bottle warmer if you start to keep a fridge or freezer stash. I also recommend freezer bags and keeping 1 bottle worth of milk in fridge but the rest frozen - this gives you a cushion but doesn't risk spoiling as much milk if you forget to switch it out.  Since baby knows how to breastfeed you can always use it as a backup - if you're out longer than expected or spill a bottle.   Good luck!
InfertilityBabies,3aqhmh,Hopecat,2,Mon Jun 22 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"I know the food restrictions thing is really hard, but my SIL had this with both kids.  The first just dairy, the second, nuts too-- so when she cut dairy a lot of things got replaced with nuts and the problem didn't go away.  But the second time, they tested my niece, not just trial and error, and that helped my SIL immensely with safe stuff to eat.  Just if that helps-- because they also tried pumping exclusively for overactive letdown and it made her nuts."

Luckily my hunger is generally for healthy food. I look forward to getting the green like to start exercising again because I am just feeling so not myself!!!
InfertilityBabies,3aqwgf,traveler5678,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"I was the same way early on.  I didn't have a lick of morning sickness and was hungry all the time.  I think I had gained 3 lbs by my first OB appointment ~9 or 10 weeks.  When I asked about weight gain at that appointment, the nurse told me that I should eat when hungry as long as I did so healthfully and that some women tend to gain more earlier on.  Sure enough, the weight gained evened out in the second trimester.  Make sure you're getting enough protein and water!"

Now in my 15th week, it has slowed down a little. I still get hungry of course (esp when I first wake up omg - I have to eat immediately), but I feel a little bit more normal.

I also have hip/back pain that makes it almost impossible to sleep without Benadryl. Mine seems to be pelvic girdle pain, so maybe see if that sounds like what you've got? Pelvic girdle pain can start as early as the first trimester and is caused from ligaments loosening up unevenly."
InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:32:15 2015 UTC,"That might be it -- the pelvic girdle pain, the symphis pubis one seems to fit a bit more, but some sites consider them one and the same. I think that fits better then the round ligament pen. And we're due within a week of each other, so if ou've already got it... its completely possible I do too. Bummer. lol. I wonder if it will go away in a few weeks? I'm goign to have to do some more googling.  And yeah, the CM is out of control. I've never been one for pantyliners, but pregnancy has made me see the light!"

InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"There's a few commenters who said it went away after 20 or so weeks. Hopefully that's how it'll be with us.

InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,WhateverYouSay1084,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:27:41 2015 UTC,Same here...I would much rather have the pain than the pukes. It's good to know that it does go away for some people though! Maybe soon I can actually go shopping without needing to sit down.
InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,lancealittle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"It started getting bad for me about 15-16 weeks, but it's mainly right under my mons (symphysis pubis pain). Definitely the hips and low back get looser and more achy, and I don't think you're too early for it. I discovered today at the gym that I can. not. sit. in. a. straddle. stretch. anymore. OW!

InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"Did it get any better for you (the symphysis pubis pain?). I'm not loving this (but of course, it could be much worse!).   I can't wait until my anatomy scan as I'm under ""no excersize"" rules due to them saying I have placenta previa, and I'm hoping at that scan the placenta will have moved enough. I'm feeling more and more out of shape, adn I was in bad shape to start with! Throw in bedrest and bam. I'd love to start working on getting a little more fitness just to help with labour!"
InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,lancealittle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"It actually did -- I would say it peaked around 20-21 weeks, which I thought meant I was doomed for the rest of pregnancy, but then it really lightened up fast. Last pregnancy I mainly had pelvic pain in the final month."

InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,lancealittle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:25:21 2015 UTC,I highly recommend taking 1 colace everyday and 2-3 on bad days.  I eat a vegetarian diet and the amount of fruit and veggies I eat doesn't cut it.  I am also aiming not toward 96 oz of water now in the third trimester due to heat and elevation(about 3 big Nalgene water bottles).    It gets better.  I promise!

I'm never able to be very specific about what I want, just a generic short dude haircut that looks boring and professional. Also, I only get it cut every 3 months or so, so I usually have to talk them into cutting it short. So I had a typical conversation with the stylist -- ""yeah, it's been 3 months. I like it short -- we usually use clippers on the back, but I don't remember what size. I think 2 or 3."" She proceeds to snap on the #3 guard and run a HUGE swath up the back and side of my head and say ""well, see if this is right!"" Then, as I'm fumbling to put on my glasses so I can look, she just keeps zooming away all over my head.   The upshot is I have a really short summer cut now! you can almost see my scalp"

I'm 15 weeks and want to feel the baby soooo badly, but I'm sure I'll be like you and worry that it's not quite right.  So typical of us infertiles, huh?  On a positive note, I went to Buy Buy Baby with the hubs yesterday and we browsed!  I went out in public to look at baby things!  It felt like a huge step for me, and it felt awesome.  I felt like I was finally letting some of the excitement in, which was scary but nice.  I'm kind of tired of being a ball of anxiety about this pregnancy, and yet I can't stop the worry."
InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,dancer331,2,Mon Jun 22 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Ugh, second post in the thread!  So the maternity clinic just called and asked me to come in today. Didn't want to wait for my next appointment which is one week Friday and the only thing they would say was they wanted to offer me additional testing and review some results. So I shouldn't panic right?  I did a urine test, thyroid test and the SIPS blood work a week ago. The urine test was because I can't do a pelvic exam (placenta previa). The SIPS is the free chromosome testing (maybe like what you call quad?). But if its with that, I'm not worried as we also did the Harmony test and came back low risk for all that. So, I can only think its a fasle positive for SIPS, or maybe my thyroid has suddenly gone wonky (monthly testing). Its kind of nerve wrecking though!  I'll be there in two hours, so not enough time for a full blown panic."
InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,Bibbityboo,2,Mon Jun 22 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't be one to talk right now but try not to panic just yet. When my husband and I did the genetic testing before we started treatments, one of his tests came back positive for hep C. So they had to do follow up bloodwork. Nobody really explained it so we were freaking out for weeks about what that meant and what we do next. Turns out the first test is cheaper but gives lots of false positives, so insurance will only pay the expensive, definitive test if the first one is positive. It was negative with the expensive test and all was well but we lost it for a while. Hopefully you get good results. Will be thinking of you!"

So, I paid for the Harmony NIPT test becuase it was far more accurate than the one that BC med covers (SIPS), but then the doc said I should also do the SIPS as it checks the placenta while Harmony doesn't.  We got our Harmony results back at the beginning of the month (1 in 10,000 chances for everything, very low risk). For some reason the clinic did NOT receive a copy of this test, when they should have. Meanwhile the SIPS (5% false positive rate) came back as 1 in 14 chance for downs. So that's why they wanted me to come in!  SHe was planning on giving me the option of the Harmony test or move straight to amnio. Since I'd already done the harmony, she said I'm good and no need to test at all. If they had had the results like they were supposed to, they wouldn't have even bothered calling!  What a relief."

In fact, I have very distinct memories of having to lie on my belly for a good 5-10 mins just to feel a slight tap.  Sorry you still feel like shit though.  I personally, found the all day nausea to be somewhat reassuring, but I didn't have it at 17 weeks, so I get that you just want to get shit going and feel normal again.  I swear I will get to writing a birth story one day.  But most importantly, all three of us are alive, and baby peed TWICE today after we have been freaking out about dehydration/feeding issues.  Hubs is extremely supportive.  I feel like I am not doing enough, I am so grateful to him.  The doc we saw today was also reassuring of her current health so I feel much less stressed now.  She has been sleeping soundly in her pack n play for a nice stretch of time.  This is the quietest the apartment has been since we got home yesterday afternoon."

Now at 23 weeks, I get little flurries of movement for an hour or two and then radio silence for hours at a time.  Our weekend was lovely. My birthday party was Saturday. It started off sadly, since everyone that came early/on time decided to hang out with my husband in the kitchen and so literally no one came up to say hi for almost an hour after the party started. Which, I figured what was going on, but pregnancy hormones were not helping, so I was sitting in bed being weepy. However! Once people did come up here, we had a good time, playing games and eating tacos.  This week I have my follow up with my MFM on Wed to see if bed rest is helping and if the antibiotics cleared up whatever that debris was. Fingers crossed! We've got some friends coming by this weekend and then on Sunday my mom arrives. So I'll be spending some time this week making a ""honey do"" list of nursery stuff she can work on."

InfertilityBabies,3aq0ha,jaina_jade,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"Awesome cakes! Also I am 17w7d and still haven't felt anything. Well I have felt the odd thing that I think might be movement but I can't say for sure as this is my first. And those maybe movements have been rare. It's totally fine if you don't feel much for a while, especially as I saw you noted that your placenta is hanging out in front. So don't worry!  So I had a jealous and petty moment this weekend when my husband and I ran into DH's physiotherapist and wife, who was also pregnant, at Old Navy. She looked like she had at least a month left, but she was only 5 days away from her due date! 5! She must have been thin prior to getting pregnant plus had not gained an ounce of fat. Ugh I was totally jealous (ok still am) because I know I will be lumbering around at that stage because hello, 5 days. And like I always have a borderline normal BMI and now I have a borderline normal weight gain for this pregnancy and there she is, all perfect and will likely pop back to normal post-pregnancy in less than a month. So yes super jealous, and feeling super petty and lame because I felt that way. Also she didn't smile or say hello and that bugged me too.   Also I got my final grades back for one of my courses and one of the comments for the final essay was that it was written at  a university level and should have been grade 8-10 for better reading comprehension for all. Uh what? It was for a university level course and was supposed to be ""written to the privacy commissioner of Canada"". So confused. My mark was still great, so I guess I can't really complain.  Edit: it's stuff like this that makes me re-think my decision to go back to school part time to get a degree while also working a full time job."

It sucks to have that strike you, especially when you don't want to feel that way. :/   That is a weird comment. Were the comments from your professor? Everyone seems to have their own weird bug-a-boos which they had drilled into their heads and they'll bring that forward into situations where it doesn't apply. At least it didn't seem to affect your grade!"
InfertilityBabies,3anorh,dancer331,3,Mon Jun 22 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"Your worries and concerns and anxiety are all valid. We've all felt that horrible worry and the hesitant happiness, then the guilt for not feeling the way we think we're supposed to once we did get a positive. A lot of us even had that terrifying spotting, bleeding, and clotting.   At this moment right now you are pregnant. Remember that. Pregnant!!! Take a deep breath and remember that beta number. But also remember you're allowed to feel every emotion that comes with this. You've been through a lot and it's not over. But right now, you're pregnant!  Congratulations!"
InfertilityBabies,3anorh,NBPTS,2,Mon Jun 22 01:05:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I keep trying to tell myself I'm pregnant and I WILL have this baby. But my brain isn't listening to my mouth very well. I told my husband since we went through hell just to get pregnant that the next 9 months would be smooth sailing. I lied!"
InfertilityBabies,3anorh,Bibbityboo,3,Mon Jun 22 12:35:47 2015 UTC,"Hey you.   I had spotting, a lot. At first the fertility clinic told me it was incredibly normal, especially with IVF (and I'm assuming that would also include fet). For me, I was eventually diagnosed wish a sub chorionic hematoma and bled for a month solid -- clots, brown, pink, dark red etc. one day filling pads rapidly. In the end it all cleared up (finished draining) and I'm now at 16w3d. It was so scary and I was nervous every time I went the bathroom. But every thing turned out ok.   I was told to watch for painful cramping combined with filling a pad within an hour. With yours being old blood and your betas so high, I think it's really promising. See if you can get in for an ultrasound for peace of mind.   Hang in there. The first few weeks scared me so much."
InfertilityBabies,3anorh,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:31:55 2015 UTC,Hey! I'm an uncontrollable ball of anxiety. I noticed this morning that the brown was mixed in with a ton of CM when I went to the bathroom so no idea what that means but eager to ask the nurse when she calls me back. I'm hoping it's nothing and I've googled way too much only to find that it seems to result in positive outcomes half the time and negative outcomes half the time. I have bloodwork tomorrow which I'm hoping can calm me down and then an ultrasound on 7/2 so hopefully everything can keep moving along the next week and a half.

Has the nurse called back.  I found the same thing -- it was so inexact finding stuff out on google. It didn't seem to help at all. But it can absolutely work out for you.  Blood work and an ultrasound soon sounds great. I have found since getting pregnant that my CM is out of this world -- so much more than normal!  Hope you're hanging in there."
InfertilityBabies,3anorh,sunlightonwater,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"I'm ok. Less spotting but lots of CM. I think the brown spotting on top of all that mucus made it seem worse but no idea. The nurse said I could come in today for blood, but since it was kind of late and they wouldn't have results until tomorrow anyway, I figured I'd just wait. This way I can give my body some time to make a decision on what it's gonna do and have an accurate reading tomorrow. She agreed that it sucks that there's really nothing I can do but hoping for the best. Really want to make it to my ultrasound next week."

InfertilityBabies,3aobb7,PrincessCBHammock,2,Mon Jun 22 09:44:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty normal, especially with how close you are to your due date. I've been told not to worry unless your hands/face start swelling--that's an ER visit stat! For comparison sake, at 19 weeks my ankles and feet were so swollen that I could feel the top of my feet jiggle when I walked and a finger press would leave pitting. Keeping them elevated and drinking lots of water helps. Oddly enough, I found the swelling was better on weekends when I was standing/walking as opposed to sitting at my desk. (I will say this for bed rest--I no longer have any swelling ;)"
InfertilityBabies,3aobb7,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:47:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's normal sadly, but definitely check with your doctor.

It was amazing to put my footprint-card-making skills to work with MY baby for my husband!! I also gave him two framed pictures of him with M, made him breakfast in bed and yesterday I made him some treats (frozen s'mores!) Father's Day has been good so far.   We're going for lunch with in-laws, including some people who haven't met M yet, so that should be fun.   FIL has his own business and has t-shirts with his company logo embroidered on them. We found a onesie in our hand-me-downs that totally matched the shirts (navy blue with a pocket on the chest) so we had to bring it to the shop to get the logo put on it. M is wearing it today and I am so looking forward to seeing FIL's reaction!"

Their layers are: graham cracker crust, semi-sweet chocolate, a few spots of marshmallow fluff, chocolate pudding and marshmallow fluff on top! Sooooo good! I make the pudding and fluff from scratch (super simple and easy recipes that only involve a mixer or a blender) if you want the recipes just let me know :)"

I'm thinking I will get Mr Beca a book on becoming a dad then, as we aren't doing antenatal classes.  Today I was wiped out. I had my hair competition model do some training in salon, then napped. Did nothing much and a little housework then slept some more."
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,vibeee,2,Sun Jun 21 18:50:47 2015 UTC,Napping sounds amazing! Good for you!
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,MrsDragon,2,Sun Jun 21 20:24:51 2015 UTC,I'll take any nap I can get atm!
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,vibeee,4,Mon Jun 22 06:20:21 2015 UTC,We are not celebrating yet.  I want to hold the baby in my arms before we get the mom/dad title.  Few more weeks/months to go!  I have been getting a lot of BH contractions lately.  I know it's not an indication that the baby will come early but I won't be surprised if it does.    I'm at work and it's freaking hot here!  We didn't need an AC last summer but this year we may have to look into buying one.  Off tomorrow and out to buy some paint for the nursery!  I am excited to get this project started!  Edit: a letter
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,MrsDragon,4,Sun Jun 21 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"We didn't celebrate last year either, when I was pregnant.  Also, I know you meant paint, but your post totally says you're buying pain for the nursery... Which strikes me as funny. Like, no, don't worry, baby will make it painful enough with the no sleep and the poopsplosions, you don't need to buy more."
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,PrincessCBHammock,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:46:03 2015 UTC,LOL  I will edit it right now!

InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jun 21 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"Totally understand, we're approaching it the same way. We'll have our first mother's/father's days next years. I got a few texts from friends this year wishing me happy mother's day and I was so confused. : )  Hooray for getting the painting done. I always LOVE the result but eh, the process!"
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,MrsDragon,2,Sun Jun 21 20:31:52 2015 UTC,A lady from my husbands work volunteered for free so she can use pictures for her portfolio.  We will probably pay her something but it look like I won't be allowed to do much.  My hubs is the overly cautious person and now that I'm pregnant he took it to the next level.  My hat it off to you!  I can't imagine being on bed rest...My nesting instinct is slowly kicking in and I want to do things.
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,female_engineer_here,2,Sun Jun 21 21:17:58 2015 UTC,"That's great that you have help! : ) I can empathize on the overly cautious husband. Thankfully I can usually talk him out of the more overboard stuff, but he wouldn't be crazy about me painting anything while pregnant either.  My saving grace is that my mom and a friend of mine are coming out for most of July and they are both handy and want to help. So I'm planning projects for them. ;)"
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,vibeee,2,Sun Jun 21 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"We didn't celebrate when I was pregnant either, it didn't feel real enough yet.  Next year you'll get the whole experience"
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,spankyjubblies,3,Sun Jun 21 20:15:06 2015 UTC,I hope so.  I just don't feel entitled to do it yet.  I know the baby will make it here but IF is robbing be of the innocence and unquestioned happiness.
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,MrsDragon,4,Sun Jun 21 20:32:36 2015 UTC,"I have totally dominated Father's day. Made Mr.P a daily card, got him some geeky presents and ( best part) I made this awesome journal - saw the idea on beyondthebump, I think. I got this super fancy journal, stamped kiddo's hands and feet in it, added some pics, and wrote a little list of the things the baby lurks likes and does. I'll do it every year. He LOVES it. Yay!   We also went out to brunch, and I'm making a super yummy dinner and strawberry rhubarb crisp for dinner. Yay!"

This year it was so freaking refreshing to not dwell on the loss of my father, but instead celebrate that my husband is going to be a father!  He didn't want a big show so I didn't do anything much, but we had brunch with his family and the restaurant gave all the dads some coffee, and he got to be included!  It's so cool to me.  Happy Fathers Day all!"
InfertilityBabies,3alw4p,MrsDragon,2,Sun Jun 21 20:26:23 2015 UTC,Sorry about loosing your dad.  It must have been hard.  My dad is my rock and I can't imagine my world without him.  I like your new perspective though!  I'm glad you got to enjoy it!

He seems to feel a lot worse than me though , complaining of dizziness and generally acting like he's going to die or something. I'm trying not to stress out about it. It's likely just exhaustion.   In happier news, Z seems to be going through her ""language explosion."" She is definitely using two word phrases now, and she's picking up new words like crazy. It's really awesome to watch. :) But we're also seeing more frustration over not being able to communicate exactly what she means/wants."

Like smiles and laughter and more smiles and more laughter. It is the most amazing, beautiful thing in the entire world.   Con - my arms can only do so many reps with this 12+lb baby, and when I stop he gets angry and sad.   Going shopping with a friend to get high waisted pants for work; I have lost close to 22lbs since I was still pregnant but my work pants are too small and my maternity pants are just a touch too big. I am going back to work on Wednesday. :("

He's being totally awesome about it though and a couple of our friends are coming early with tables/chairs to help him set up. We had planned on doing board games and tacos, so when bed rest hit, we decided to just move people into the bedroom. We usually do board games with our friends every week, so I'm extra glad to have had this planned since I'm missing seeing everyone and doing that.  While he preps, I'm trying to get some more work done to make up for the days last week when I wasn't set up for work yet. Should pass the time at any rate. : )"

Ideally, we would like to drive back home to have the baby in case she needs to stay at the hospital for awhile.  As a first time mom I know it should take awhile, but it's hard to know since these things can be unpredictable.

We found out that our issue with the water pressure was due to a break in the pipe between the house and well.  So while we don't have to drill a new well (yay) we do have to replace the entire pipe, which involves digging up the front yard and ripping up the front walkway and all the bushes.  Luckily, my wife works for a farmer who had excavating equipment.... so he's doing all the digging and we are paying him in pie."

We also went a couple of days with only a hose connecting our water and luckily it happened to be right when we had -10 Celsius weather when typically it stays above 0 Celsius in the winter here so the hose kept freezing. The whole endeavor cost us thousands in order to dig up the driveway, replace the line, put gravel back temporarily and put concrete there many many months later. I wish we were like some provinces where the water meter was at the house in which case it wouldn't have cost us a penny.   Edit: but vs put"
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,revangelfire,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:03:03 2015 UTC,Woah that sounds like an expensive drag. I'm glad for you it's not drilling a new well though!

I had a check up with the doc who did my c-section today. She told me that it's always a hard decision to deliver someone as early as I was but that she's glad we went that route; when she opened me up there was a clot the size of a softball because Asher's placenta was abrupting. That's so scary! I'm glad we didn't wait any longer! I was losing a lot of blood during labor but everyone thought it was due to the cerclage. No one suspected placental abruption because neither of the babies were showing signs of distress. I guess we dodged a huge bullet! She also said that when they took the cerclage out after the c-section that my cervix looked completely intact and normal. I'm really glad everything ended up ok."

InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,curiouslywanting,3,Fri Jun 19 16:40:17 2015 UTC,Yeah! We got to start holding them when they were 4 days old. We do 2-3 hours of kangaroo care every day. In 2 more weeks they'll be off c-pap and we can start bottle feeding too :)

Today...I do not want to go to work for the same reason that I absolutely want to go to work.  It is my last day, and it means I have to say goodbye to my kids.  Some of them will still be there for the next school year, but not all.  There will be tears.  But, after work I'm meeting up with my childhood best friend, who hasn't been back to the state in at least 15 years (and only for a visit).  She moved when I was about 7.  We've kept in contact via FB for a couple years, we're not close or anything, but she brought her son (and her other son, due in September!), so I'm sure we'll gab about that.  Plus, we're going to lunch, and I'll be having clam cakes and chowder, and it will be awesome.  Then I guess it's home to sit on my butt (and/or wash cloth diapers) until A and B feel the need to show up...a lesson in patience..."

InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,revangelfire,4,Fri Jun 19 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"I was supposed to graduate from my RE's office yesterday. We had another ultrasound yesterday at 9w2d. The gummy bear baby we saw two weeks ago is doing really well--measuring at 10 weeks, heartbeat of 174 . Then we got a surprise when we went in the doctor's office to talk. We had another much smaller sac that we thought was empty at my last ultrasound two weeks ago.  Now there's a tiny fetus with a heartbeat of 102 in there. Baby b is measuring much further behind at 6 weeks, 5 days, so I'm trying to be realistic about its chances. I have to go back for another scan next week and then I'll be released to my ob. It just sucks because my wife will be out of town for the next scan and I'm scared that something awful will happen.   We had transferred three embryos so we knew that twins were a possibility.  I had really settled into the idea of just one so this is a big surprise. I'm kind of shocked and I'm not sure what to think yet. Twins frighten me but the idea of losing one is scary too. I just wish this pregnancy could have gone easily."
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,springbound,2,Fri Jun 19 12:39:59 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm so sorry. I hope they even out growth wise quickly, it sounds like B is 1w4d behind expected?

Flying to Lake Thaoe to meet him and a 3 other couples for the week :)  We're staying at a cabin on the lake and I'm so freaking excited I couldn't sleep last night!  I'm SUPER worried about being pregnant on the flight so I switched from window to isle seats.  Anyone have any good tips beside the obvious 'get up and walk around once in a while' one to help me get through my 2 three hour flights???
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,larabair,4,Fri Jun 19 13:13:21 2015 UTC,COMPRESSION SOCKS!   I flew cross country twice during my pregnancy and I freaking blew up like a balloon both times even with the getting up bit and drinking plenty of water. Compression socks saved my butt big time.
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,gizmo_love,2,Fri Jun 19 13:35:27 2015 UTC,Where can I get those last minute??  Any ideas?
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,HerVoiceEchoes,3,Fri Jun 19 13:59:13 2015 UTC,CVS has them! And drink lots and lots of water!

InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,razzertto,3,Fri Jun 19 15:23:04 2015 UTC,There was a section with heavy duty ones for like diabetics. I found another section I think with the pantyhose that were compression but not as intense or expensive.
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 19 15:37:08 2015 UTC,Maybe Target? Or a medical supply store (people with diabetes use them to improve circulation).
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,razzertto,2,Fri Jun 19 14:04:43 2015 UTC,Annnnnnnd purchased!! Thanks for the tip :)
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 19 21:04:35 2015 UTC,That sounds amazing - have a blast! No tips unfortunately.
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,jaina_jade,2,Fri Jun 19 13:50:23 2015 UTC,Drink lots of water. Lots. Wear slip-on shoes and take them off on the plane. And definitely compression socks. But make sure you don't get a sunburn because compression socks over a sunburn is incredibly painful.
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,lancealittle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:59:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, is that sunburn comment from experience ;)  Slip-on shoes is a good idea.  I was going to wear my running shoes, but I think you're right."

InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,gizmo_love,2,Fri Jun 19 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"ohhh, that sounds so relaxing (the cabin on the water part anyways). I've read about flying and you've got it right. Perhaps take frequent potty trips so that you get up AND hopefully avoid an emergency pee situation."

InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,MrsDragon,2,Fri Jun 19 13:17:36 2015 UTC,Oddly enough the doctor explicitly said no doughnut pillows or the like - apparently it's not good post surgery!

Also got to freak out the husband last night, I took a nap and like a ""good"" preggo was on my left side.  When I woke up, I rolled on to my back and it looked like I had a tumor - baby was all on the left.  Called husband in to see Mt. Baby and he was not nearly as amused and made comments regarding Alien(s). I think it's hilarious as well as a confirmation that lil one is still growing and moving as it should."

I'm sorry you are in so much pain, but I'm glad the issue is getting addressed, so hopefully it's all up from here!  As for me, I'm learning that attempting to work from home, in the bedroom, on a morning when your husband is trying to sleep in because he doesn't have work...makes it really hard to stay awake! Thankfully he got up about an hour after I started working and opened the drapes to let in some sunlight. :)  The babies are kicking like crazy and I'm loving it. They're still tiny enough that it's adorable and giggle inducing instead of rib bruising. These two sure get around though, kicks from every which where. Hubby was able to feel a good one last night while we were watching Agents of Shield (omg, Season 2!!!) and was surprised at the strength. Hands down my favorite thing about pregnancy so far.  We have our follow up with the maternal fetal specialist on Wednesday to see if the bed rest is working and I'm getting increasingly anxious about it. It needs to be Wednesday already! We'll be 23w4days at the appointment and my first ""mental milestone"" is 24 weeks, so getting news that the boys are okay at that appointment will do a lot to put my mind at ease."

InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,Iamagnu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"I love to hike but since about 25 weeks I had to slow down.  The elevation and going  uphill gives me BH right away and a lot of them - like every 2-3 minutes.  It freaks my husband out and he makes me turn around.  So yeah, no more hiking...even though I have the energy to do it.    We tried doing a 2 mile hike(4 total in/out) but had to turn around half way.  My husband is a cautious man.  I wasn't happy :("

It's my husband's birthday today - I caved and gave him his present last night. I got him a gift certificate for a beer brewing session at this cool place a friend told us about, and he was so excited. Tonight I am baking birthday cake, and tomorrow he is going brewery hopping while I assemble and decorate the cake, and then we're having a bunch of people meet us for dinner at the fancy German place my husband loves. After dinner, people are coming back to our place for cake, board games, and more beer.  Whew, I get tired just thinking about tomorrow. But my husband will get to enjoy all of his favorite things, and that's what is important."

As a follow-up to my excitement yesterday about the prospect of taking mini-gnu in the pool, can someone offer some practical advice on taking a small baby to the pool? Lucie's List points out that exclusively breastfed infants have very liquidy poop that's tough to contain in a swim diaper, so she advises not even trying a public pool before 6 months. She suggests the beach instead. Since we're landlocked here, that's not an option. Has anyone here taken an EBF newborn in a public pool? Swim diaper-wise, how'd you do it?"
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,pamplemousse2,3,Fri Jun 19 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"Hrm, I have not tried yet so no tips here - but maybe try them out in your tub if you're concerned? Then you can test for leaks!"
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,lancealittle,2,Fri Jun 19 14:02:06 2015 UTC,Good idea!
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,lancealittle,2,Fri Jun 19 15:58:09 2015 UTC,"We've been swimming a few times, with reusable swim diapers, and Isaac has never pooed. Can you tell when mini-gnu is working on a poo? I think you should go for it."

Pond is simultaneously in a growth spurt, a leap week and cluster feeding. Plus our lives are in upheaval in general living here with my parents and being away from daddy for 3 weeks. This really was the best way to handle our move but fuck it's hard. The past 2 days Pond has had crying fits that lasted several hours. It's hard to listen to him be so upset. I think he's really gassy so I'm worried about my dairy intake and overactive letdown. Plus, yesterday husband texted from his hotel in Tampa that our car got broken into in the hotel lot over night. They made off with 2 Xboxes, one dress uniform shoe -seriously...- and some jewelry. I'm so sad about the jewelry. One piece was a ring my grandmother gave me. And they ate half of a roll of Ritz crackers. Thankfully the car is fine and husband and his dad are safe. It could have been much, much worse. I'm just so tired and ready to be in my own space, back with my husband. I'm so out of practice being a military wife. Lol."

Is it 3 more weeks until you're into your new place, or it's been 3 so far? I'm not remembering what the new situation will be for you, just that it was a far move!"

Sorry your doctor had to rip you a new asshole :( Pain relief with hemorrhoids is so hard, because narcotics make your shit constipated (ouch), but on the other hand you have horrible post-procedure pain (double ouch). I hope you strike the perfect balance and heal up well.  As I have been dreaming about for years, I have the next 4 days to myself. I do work tomorrow, but otherwise it's just alone, unstructured time. Holy shit. This did happen once 2 years ago, but I think I had to work all but one of the days. Otherwise it's been, what? 6 years? 7? since I routinely had alone time?? The stupid thing is that I'm already getting anxious. I don't do that well with wide expanses of time to myself, but I do need a break from the constant hectic-ness of family.  I'm making a list of stuff to do, and a comical proportion of it is simply cooking/baking now that I have time and no 4-year-old around to interrupt every third thought. Chicken parm, strawberry rhubarb pie, garlic scape and white bean dip . . ."

InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,becabecaful,2,Fri Jun 19 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"Strawberry rhubarb is my family's favorite! My tips are to pre-cook the rhubarb - pour boiling water over it and let sit for 2 minutes, then combine with the strawberries and other filling ingredients. Let the filling sit overnight before baking to get the best filling texture.  Now I need to make strawberry rhubarb pie! I planted rhubarb this year but can't harvest it yet because it needs to establish."
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,bandgeek_foreves,3,Fri Jun 19 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Ooh, those are good tips. I forgot you're a big pie-baker, right? Like 10 at a time for thanksgiving?

How come our house didn't come with hidden edibles??"
InfertilityBabies,3ae4fw,AwkwardOrangeHippo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"Oooooh, thanks for the tips! I can definitely make that happen. I think I'm going to do crumble rather than pie... It will still be delicious.  Edit to fix autocorrect stupidity."

InfertilityBabies,3aeotz,larabair,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:08:31 2015 UTC,"Colorbox Chalk, bought at Paper Source but available at others. If I hadn't handed off all my scrapbooking stuff to my mom I would have used a normal Colorbox or a Stampin' Up pad.  I picked the Chalk because it dries wicked fast.  I wiped his hands down immediately after with a bunch of wet wipes, made sure his pacifier was in easy reach the rest of the day, and scrubbed his hands a few times.  I don't think there's anything really toxic in it but I didn't want to take a chance.  So Daddy and Great-Grandma got cards ""signed"" by Ben for their birthdays, and Daddy gets another one on Sunday.  I did all three at once.  The first one was smeary, second was perfect, third was very little ink.  So definitely try on scrap paper while your guy is woozy."

We haven't been in to see the boys yet, and I haven't even showered or changed out of my PJs, BUT I finally called to make arrangements for my student loans AND I finally scheduled my first PP OB appointment. I also ordered a pumping bra and a nursing cover so I can pump in public if I need to. May not sound like much but the last two weeks have literally been a blur of pumping, sleeping, and NICU time ... and before that it was hospital bed rest ... so it feels like a lot to me!   I'm starting to feel less tired and getting more into the swing of things. My abdomen isn't as sore anymore and the tape is starting to come off the incision (things look good). Pumping is still kinda meh. I'm getting about an ounce every 2-3 hours, and then overnight when I have my 5 hour breaks I get a little over 2oz. It's not much but every little bit is helpful to my boys.  Asher & Sebastian continue to do well. They are NICU favorites even though they are trouble makers and always take off their c-pap masks or pull out their feeding tubes. In 2.5 more weeks they should be able to come off c-pap and then kangaroo care will be so much easier (plus we'll get to see their sweet little faces all the time).   Thank you guys for your continual support. It makes everything a little bit easier to handle!"

One place they love to explore is under the dining room table.  So I'm sitting in the living room watching them explore the dining room, when I notice O playing with something dark which is scattered across the floor.  It was dog poop.  My asshole dog decided to pinch a fresh one off right then and there and (of course) O was curious enough to play with it.  I managed to grab G away before he could get any, and luckily O didn't decide to eat it, but he was smashing it in his hands and rolling in it.  Yesterday was my daughter's kindergarten Olympics (field day) too, so I volunteered to help so I could surprise her.  I was the only dad there... I couldn't believe it.  Do dad's not do these things?  I even had one mom say ""oh, did your wife have to work?"". No....I actually enjoy doing things with my kids...."

He's already talking about all the things he wants to do.  This should not be unusual, this should be the norm!"
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,Bibbityboo,3,Thu Jun 18 16:49:20 2015 UTC,Did you see the shit-eating thread on /r/parenting yesterday?
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jun 18 16:28:50 2015 UTC,I really didn't need to read all that today lol.
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,SJP8,2,Thu Jun 18 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"Omg, this is a major pet peeve of mine. My husband kinda shrugs it off but I get irate at how often it's assumed that he is incompetent/uninterested/uninvolved just because he is male. I work in a male dominated field (engineering) and the shit I see dads get is so much worse that anything that would ever be allowed in the workplace today. It's depressing how far we have yet to go."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jun 18 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"Oh god. I know I have to brace myself for poo painting, and poo-splosions, but I had forgotten the pet factor. We have cats who don't poop outside of the box but every so often seem to engage in some magical game of ""Poo Hockey"" in which the puck is a hardened turd! Add to the list of things to watch for!  I'm glad you're involved inyour kids! And screw anyone who comments. We're not officially parents yet, but that would make me sad if my husband had that kind of response. I know he wants to be super involved. I have no intention of treating it as a big deal when he does things, he's just parenting just like I am.   I know he wanted to take some of the paternity leave (in Canada we get 1 full year!), but we've decided that it may be wiser if I take it due to breast feeding and logistics. Plus he only works 4 days a week, so at least 3 days a week it'll be two parents on board."

InfertilityBabies,3aa929,lancealittle,2,Thu Jun 18 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Omg, I don't know  either! It ends up in the weirdest of places and inevitably on a day we have company so that we look like gross people. We may have solved this though -- we've recently replaced our litter boxes with rubber made totes --high sides. Why did we do this? Because we have one dumbass cat who doesn't know where his ass is! He sometimes (maybe once a month or so) would pee with his ass hanging out of the door to the litterbox. We kept a mat there that caught it, but come on! So far the totes seem to solve this problem AND make it harder for the poo pucks to escape.  (This particular cat is pretty...but not clever)"
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,Bibbityboo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"wow, I might have to do that! my cat doesn't really miss too often but my dog LOVES catbox crunchies, so a big tote would keep her out of it."

Rather than spend the $40, we figured, why not try making one for $8? We've skipped the lid, for now, but with a dog, that may be the way to go! They love the tootsie rolls!"
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,Bibbityboo,2,Thu Jun 18 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"My husband has had the comment a few times, ""you look so natural doing (xyz)"". What the hell is that supposed to mean?"

InfertilityBabies,3aa929,larabair,24,Fri Jun 19 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"So I noticed my downvote ""fairy"" is back and that's fine because it's the internet and it means actually nothing and as I've said before, if she's taking the time out to follow me to different sub's and pay that much attention, fine. But I have to say, I'm done calling her a ""fairy"" because downvoting when I commiserate with someone over a loss or hard day or when I congratulate someone for a triumph actually makes you a giant, pathetic CUNT.  I'll add that I love this community and was seriously blown away by actions of everyone coming together to support someone dealing with a loss and how we all recovered quickly from ""drama""."

That is not a life I was made for.  My FIL was in the Navy and would gone for 6-9 months at a time while my MIL was pregnant.  I hate hearing the stories because they fill me anxiety even thought it was years ago.   Side note, this baby girl must be having a growth spurt because she slept almost all day yesterday and has been mostly asleep today.  I feel her once in a while and have the doppler for extra assurance, but it freaks me out every time she does this.  Just kick your mom, kid!  I'm not going to like it as much once you're out!"
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,revangelfire,3,Thu Jun 18 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"I also cannot imagine being out of touch with my husband. Military families awe me, how do they do it?"
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,TigFan15,3,Thu Jun 18 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"Military wife here. My husband picked a military career that would keep him home the majority of the time so it's not too bad... He does have to travel for training sometimes but it's usually only up to 3 months, and he is still in the country and can call or Skype or text. The hardest was basic training when we were still dating as the first month he was not allowed a cell phone and could only sporadically call  using a pay phone. The other two months of basic were a bit easier but still hard as he had way less freedom.   But those military families with someone who goes off to war or on a ship for 6-12 months, that would be crazy hard. Also this is my first child, I can't imagine doing it with any children. I know my husband will have more training to do at some point and I am not looking forward to that."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,revangelfire,2,Thu Jun 18 16:40:52 2015 UTC,What was really sad for my MIL is that she had a miscarriage at around 10ish weeks while my FIL was gone.  He had no idea and there was no way to contact him.  She had to go through it all alone.  He came home expecting to see her big belly and she had to tell him the whole thing and relive it.  It's a tough life they choose but I know they would both say they wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,TigFan15,3,Thu Jun 18 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"Oh wow that would be really hard. :(  Same with us, it currently works out well for us, I just hope our next posting is closer to come as we currently live across the country from our families, which means we will have little support for our first child."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,jaina_jade,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:04:49 2015 UTC,Ditto on the long distance thing.  We're a lot closer then we used to be but still 5 hours to our closest set of parents.  It's a big part of why I'm not going back to work after having her.  I hope you get to move closer!!  It's hard to be far from family.

I was told that once I can go a week without puking I can stop taking the 530 zofran, and then if I can go another week they'll drop the afternoon zofran, than repeat until only doing the nighttime dose.  I don't generally get nausea - just straight from normal to vomiting.    I'm just glad there is medication available, thank goodness for modern science - in more ways than one!!!"

She wasn't overly excited about him, which I expected but it was still weird. She's never been a kid person, plus her life is very much not in a settled-with-kids place. I was a little sad that things felt weird between us though. She's still here through Sunday and neither of us has made the effort to make more plans. I hope we don't drift too far apart."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,curiouslywanting,2,Thu Jun 18 14:34:39 2015 UTC,": ( That's so hard. Maybe make an effort to reach out and specifically talk non-kid stuff (which is tough when they are taking over your life)?  Do any of her other friends have kids or are you the first? When my husband and I started dating, we were the first ""serious"" couple in our friends group and people got weird, fast. So we learned to way dial back on the coupley stuff and over time as they (a) saw that we were still individual people and (b) more people got into serious relationships of their own, it normalized. But it was extremely awkward at first. I think that applies to all life changes--getting married, having kids, etc."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,Peachmaru,2,Thu Jun 18 15:18:52 2015 UTC,It is sad when your friendships change when you are in different lifemodes.  I hope that you guys can continue to connect despite the fact you are in different places.  I've felt the same way with a few of my friends.
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,talula79,2,Thu Jun 18 16:35:18 2015 UTC,I understand. When my sister met my son and now when she visits it's a similar thing. I'm sorry this is happening.
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,septicidal,2,Fri Jun 19 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"So my little giraffe baby Matilda, as we affectionately call her because of her long legs, thought it was funny when dad woke up to see me sleeping on the couch and she was in her mamaroo swing next to me. He asked why we were that way and I said ""she has been up all night. I just needed to sleep a little"" and as soon as she heard my voice she got this big grin on her face. Lolol What a stinker! Now she's sleeping in her bassinet. And I am wide awake... For now."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,gizmo_love,3,Thu Jun 18 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"At what point do you try to talk to your OB about alternate nausea medications?  I've been taking Unisom and B6, which was helping quite a bit, but around 3 weeks ago my nausea has gotten worse and worse.  I'm having trouble sleeping because I'm so nauseated.  Actual vomiting episodes are few and far between, but eating is a struggle and I feel so, so awful all of the time.  I need to focus at work but can't because I'm spending so much energy trying not to vomit.  At this point, I'm 17 weeks today and my nausea is the worst it has ever been.  I can't snack constantly (which seemed to help in earlier weeks) because I have to track post-meal blood sugars and therefore have to wait 2 hours after eating so I can get a blood sugar reading before eating again.  I'm having trouble sleeping because I'm so nauseated.  I feel like OBs don't want to prescribe any anti-emetics if you're able to keep down food/fluids, and I signed up for this, y'know?  So I am just being a whiny crybaby.  My husband is trying to urge me to go home and lie down but A) we have cleaners coming to the house and I can't be in their way and B) I evidently forgot my house keys, so I couldn't get inside even if I did go home."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,TigFan15,4,Thu Jun 18 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"That sucks, I have nothing to really add but I saw both you and Jaina both still feeling icky :( I have bad days still but I just figure baby is having a growth spurt or something. Hope you find relief soon, my friend had a lot of nausea and she got on Zofran but had to take it as a suppository and ONLY when she was continuously throwing up and not before (sort of a last measure kind of deal).  Have you tried switch your prenatals maybe? Perhaps try some gummies? I dunno, I want to help but nausea is such a finicky thing."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,septicidal,2,Thu Jun 18 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about all of this - morning sickness sucks and there is just no way around that.  I'm not sure about meds, I wish I could help you out, but I was so paranoid after my MMC that I didn't take anything and was just miserable all the time for weeks.  I don't recommend it.  I did take a sick day at least once a week, would do nothing but rest the minute I got home and all weekend.  Driving to and from work were the WORST parts.  I'm just sorry you're so sick and I hope you feel better soon :("
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,TigFan15,2,Thu Jun 18 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the sympathy.  My OB had previously ok'd taking Unisom (I take it at night and it does seem to make a difference for the next day, if I forget to take it things are much worse) but said they like to avoid prescribing other medications like Zofran unless patients are having difficulty keeping down fluids and other nutrients.  My sick time is quite limited and likely needs to all be saved for my OB appointments to come.  Plus my office is short-staffed and there's a lot to get done.  Partially functional but pukey me is better for them than if I'm just home sick and getting nothing done, though obviously it's not ideal."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jun 18 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"I was non-functional at work so I give you kudos for even being partially functional!  Seriously, that's rough.  I was prescribed zofran and took it for my first pregnancy around the same time we lost the pregnancy.  It wasn't related but I just never got past that.  To be honest, I never really noticed that it made a difference for me anyways."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,septicidal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"My OB's office said much the same--as long as you are eating/drinking it's ""fine"". They mostly seemed concerned that I was gaining weight. If I hadn't been gaining weight, then it would have been a different story.   I'd be talking to them about it for sure. Not being able to snack is probably making it worse and not being able to sleep is rough. I have a prescription for Zofran and I take dicliegis at night (basically unisom and B6 prepackaged together), but would take the zofran when things were really bad. The dicliegis takes the edge off but the zofran would knock that stuff out totally."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,robyn_sparkles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:15:31 2015 UTC,I've lost weight over the last few weeks but was very overweight prior to pregnancy so they haven't mentioned any concern.  I can't afford to use sick time for another emergency appointment at this point. I guess I can try calling once I can find a private place to call from.
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,larabair,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:46:23 2015 UTC,Can you get Diclectin?   It has been my sanity saver thus far.
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,jaina_jade,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much the same as unisom and B6 I think, isn't it?"
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,robyn_sparkles,2,Fri Jun 19 00:15:31 2015 UTC,"I would talk to them, if it's getting worse the last thing you want is for it to get the point where you have to be in the hospital - and it doesn't take long to hit that point.  I'm at the same point (literally) as you and I noticed that my vomiting has increased over the last week to the point where I'm taking two zofran a day in additional to the dicliegis.  See if they can at least start you on the night dicliegis and then go from there, you can have up to 4 of those a day - generally 1 in the AM, 1 in the early afternoon, and then 2 at bedtime."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,afikomeme,2,Thu Jun 18 15:25:19 2015 UTC,feeling nauseated is horrible and it sounds like it is negatively impacting your life.  Maybe try pushing the matter firmly with the OB?  I hope you're feeling better soon
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,razzertto,2,Thu Jun 18 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your doctor. Nausea hit me hard and early on, but I wasn't vomiting (at that point). My RE prescribed Zofran partly because I couldn't take Dicleglis/Unisom for allergy reasons, and my OB/GYN continued the prescription. They are more concerned about how I feel now and me being able to take care of myself than the possible risk of a pregnancy class B drug. I guess it's a judgement call. For what it's worth, I'm pregnant with twins and my OB/GYN is in the MFM division at a major hospital.  I'm 23 weeks tomorrow and still nauseas, just not as bad as before. I hope it lets up a bit for you soon too."
InfertilityBabies,3aa929,krodjerz,4,Fri Jun 19 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"You're not being a whiny baby, being sick fucking sucks. Yes, you wanted oregnancy, but you don't have to like the shitty side effects. Call your doctor today and talk to them. I suffered through this same bullshit for 25-26 weeks and it is miserable, so I know how you feel. Everyone wants to say it's no big deal if you aren't actually vomiting but it's horrible for your mental health. You have my sympathy.   The only thing that helped me, even marginally, was making sure my stomach was never fully empty. I snacked all day long."

InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,jos9143,7,Wed Jun 17 11:08:05 2015 UTC,"They mentioned a ""compassionate transfer."" I'd never heard the term before this article but my clinic told us about it. It was a big part of why my parents were ok with us doing IVF. They're hard-core Catholic. Their opinion wouldn't have swayed my decision but it was nice to know they didn't totally object.   Basically, the clinic transfers all remaining embryos into the woman at a point in her cycle when pregnancy is unlikely. She is totally unmedicated. My clinic says they do this often for their Catholic patients. It offers the embryos a chance but, in over 20 years, this procedure has only resulted in 1 pregnancy.   It was an interesting read. Thank you for sharing!"
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,NBPTS,3,Wed Jun 17 12:09:52 2015 UTC,"TIL, wow, never knew about that. We did not have any left over but were prepared with letting them go into the donation pool."
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,ThatGreenSolGirl,2,Wed Jun 17 14:58:33 2015 UTC,This is an option our clinic gave us also. It is the one that feels the best to us.  We will be doing this
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,cakegroove,2,Wed Jun 17 12:42:03 2015 UTC,"Whoa, that is really interesting.  I'm going to look into whether our clinic does this or not.  We only had two make it to transfer day.  One is now my 4 month old-yay!  The other had some issues that makes them want to test it before they would transfer it.  I'm really not sure what to do with the other one and for now I'm just not thinking about it."
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,sonirose,2,Wed Jun 17 13:42:19 2015 UTC,Interesting! I've never heard if that before. I feel like that is an awesome way to end an IF journey if you have embryos that would otherwise be left hanging.
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jun 17 16:24:28 2015 UTC,Ive never heard of that! I love that idea. We never had any leftovers but it's definitely a tricky topic.
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,PrincessCBHammock,2,Wed Jun 17 14:05:43 2015 UTC,Do you still have a down vote stalker?? I upvoted this like I do with anyone that takes the time to reply to me but it is sitting at +1. What a weird thing to down vote!
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,NBPTS,2,Wed Jun 17 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"Oh God probably, I stopped noticing but I wouldn't be surprised."
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,PrincessCBHammock,3,Wed Jun 17 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"I strongly suspect that we'll have embryos we chose not to use.  I've been contemplating embryo donation, but my husband isn't comfortable with the idea.   He's worried that if we were to get an 'open' donation,  there would be questions about why some were kept,  and some were given up.  That if they grew up and were exceptional (either good or bad) he'd feel like somehow that was 'our'  fault.   I've seen so many people on this board and /r/infertility struggling with failed IUIs,  IVFs,  and FETs.  I can't help but want to help. But it would also be so strange to have my and my husband's biological kids raised by someone else...  It's a really tough decision to make."
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,ivf_lizz,3,Wed Jun 17 15:13:15 2015 UTC,We tried embryo adoption first but it failed and our clinic basically ran out of donated embryos as there weren't many.  ultimately we decided to go a different route
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,VegelantyJustice,2,Wed Jun 17 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. Embryo adoption is one of the options we discussed with our RE when we went in for our consult for the cycle that resulted in Pond. We had come to terms with being childfree if it had failed but then she presented this. I was really curious about how it worked, especially legally but I wasn't ready to research yet. California is very pro birth parents so I worried about the risks of that. It's one of the reasons we pursued IVF over traditional adoption while we lived in CA."
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,RositaYouBitch,2,Wed Jun 17 12:41:08 2015 UTC,So far the comments on this are much better than the those on the similar Washington Post article last month - but this one is also more science less emotion.
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,jaina_jade,2,Wed Jun 17 13:30:17 2015 UTC,"We have 6 frozen good quality embryos. We are not comfortable with our child/ren having siblings out there somewhere or with someone else raising ""our"" child. I've never heard about ""compassionate transfer"" but to me it is no different than discarding, and I worry I would be the 1 that got pregnant somehow with 6 or something. It was important to us to know what we would do with extra embryos before we embarked on IVF, and our decision is to donate for research. I'm not 100% on that and wish we never had to make this decision and still wonder if I'll change my mind once my LO arrives. It's a tough subject."
InfertilityBabies,3a5fr8,digitabulist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"Now that I have LL and we're maybe considering going for another, I would legit do this if my first transfer resulted in a pregnancy/birth. I have three embryos, I'll only be transferring one at a time. That would leave two (potentially) and I feel like letting someone else give them a chance would be something I'd consider. But we will see how things go."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,revangelfire,11,Wed Jun 17 13:24:20 2015 UTC,"had a ultrasound at 13w6d , baby is perfect .  She checked spine / neck everything came back perfect , baby is measuring a little bigger 14w5d .

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,AwkwardOrangeHippo,8,Wed Jun 17 17:11:30 2015 UTC,Hooray healthy baby!  Today is my SIL's egg retrieval - she just called and told me last night because she was freaking out (totally justified). I gave her all the reassurance and tips that I could. This will be a FET later this summer due to some other complications so I'm just hoping it goes well and she has lots of embryos to choose from when the time comes. If you all could please keep your fingers crossed for her I would greatly appreciate it.
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,razzertto,2,Wed Jun 17 13:48:02 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed!

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jun 17 15:02:44 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed! That was such an emotional day. I hope all goes well for her.
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jun 17 16:03:11 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed for your SIL.

Think I might have felt the baby kick last night from the outside but not 100% confident.  Although if it wasn't that I'm not quite sure what else it might have been.  I know it's a bit early but ""thanks"" to HG I'm still well below my pre-pregnancy weight and I am petite to begin with which generally points towards feeling stuff earlier - but who knows :-)"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,futurecompanion11,3,Wed Jun 17 13:34:28 2015 UTC,Ugh! HG is the worst! Baby kicks are adorable though and help you feel better when you feel like crap

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,dutchqueen,7,Wed Jun 17 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"Today was our graduation day.  I cried.  Yes, these kids are three, and yes, I will have most of them in my preschool class next school year too.  Did that stop me? NO!  Too be fair though, I cry every year.  Having a small in-class party this afternoon after rest-time for one last celebration.  My last day of work is Friday and we have a lot of military families leaving this year.  I'll cry then too.  One of the mom's came up to me at the ceremony to double check I would be there Friday.  Because, apparently, her son picked out two toys for ""the babies.""  Because, apparently, he was very very worried that I hadn't bought any toys for them yet.  I'm very glad this is one of the kids coming with me to preschool next year.  Edit: generic boring update: 35 weeks today.  OB appt tomorrow, general checkup, and probably to see if these ""contractions"" (as they like to call them...I'm on the fence) are doing anything.  And, given he won't let me go past 38 weeks, I'm assuming I'm going to have to start scheduling my c-section soon (two transverse babies, yay!)? AH!"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,septicidal,5,Wed Jun 17 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"Hooray for good checkups!  My next one isn't until July 1st but I have my anatomy scan on the 26th, so only 9 more days until that.  I find myself getting very anxious every now and again because I don't have anything to go on to reassure me everything is okay - I'm hoping this will be better after I can feel definitive movements.  I'm gearing up for my husband's birthday on Friday.  We're having a day of festivities for him on Saturday (it's his 30th so I wanted to make it a bit more exciting than what we usually do) and I have to bake/decorate his cake in the next couple days.  Every year I make him a cake from scratch, decorated based on a different internet meme.  Last year's was really good (both in taste and decoration) so I feel the need to be extra ambitious this year."

I don't remember visiting a small town where every restaurant was just great!  I didn't get to do much hiking because at was all at 10,000 feet and my contractions kicked in every time I starting walking uphill.  I may have to come back to this region after having the baby.

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,TigFan15,4,Thu Jun 18 00:14:49 2015 UTC,150 - whoot whoot!!  Glad things are going well.  Every time I go in I think I'm going to get a weight lecture but they always say I'm still in the healthy zone.  The last time she said to do whatever I was doing before I got pregnant to keep me at a healthy BMI but what I did was run 5-10 miles 3-4 days per week.  I can't really do that now!!  Oh well.  I have terrible guilt over my lack of exercise but pregnancy is tougher then expected and I'm just happy to be able to walk to and from my car at work ;)  Day 2 of my hubby being without any comminution access and I hate it.  He's my best friend and I have so much to catch him up on.  :(
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,futurecompanion11,2,Wed Jun 17 14:27:08 2015 UTC,"Yep I definitely can't run anymore either :/ and I kinda miss it, but then I lay in bed and don't want to get up for anything lol"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,TigFan15,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, right?!  I do really miss running but every time I try my heart-rate jumps to 150ish before the first quarter mile and I just get frustrated.   Plus being sick as a dog for the first 17 weeks and not be able to do anything didn't help. I'm happy to hear someone else chooses the bed over running these days ;)"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,bandgeek_foreves,4,Wed Jun 17 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"Just got home from a two day stint at the hospital! Long story short, my BP was sky high, and it turns out I have Pregnancy Induced Hypertension. We had a few scary moments of thinking maybe it was Pre E, but all my bloods and urine came back totally fine, so now I'm just medicated twice a day for the blood pressure issue, on modified bed rest (feet up a lot, but no problem going out for some small outings) and trying to keep baby in there as long as I can.   As wonderful as hospital beds, hospital food, and being woken up in the middle of the night to check my blood pressure is (can you feel the sarcasm?? :P) I'm so glad to finally be home. :)  Oh, and update and my Grandma - she's in pretty rough shape. Her test came back not very good (her heart arteries are all blocked more than 90%) and she has to start dialysis due to the extra stress on her kidneys. They are getting together a team of doctors to figure out a plan, but it looks like she won't be strong enough to have any surgery. All I'm doing right now is hoping she makes it long enough to meet her Great Grandson. Send any healthy vibes you can our way!"

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,3,Wed Jun 17 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Still feeling appalled/grumpy from yesterday, when I was questioned by both a coworker (apparently on orders from her supervisor) and my boss about my bed rest. Apparently someone (no idea who) got the idea that I was not following doctor's orders by working from home and they weren't wanting to spend any money/do anything to refine my set up until they had an email from me in writing with what the orders were.  I am pissed. First that my (several) conversations with my boss apparently weren't good enough. Second that they were assuming that I would do anything to put these beans at risk! Granted, they don't know what we went through to get them, but I DO and the thought that I would risk their health and safety for work...there are no words. I just...grrrrrrrrrrrr! The more I think about it, the angrier I get."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,pamplemousse2,3,Wed Jun 17 16:02:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, that is SO inappropriate. Do you can have an HR person you can talk to? I mean, it is one thing for your boss to say ""we require x paperwork"" but it doesn't sound like that is what happened. Plus, the coworker? Totally not okay."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jun 17 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad it's not just me!  No, our HR person (who was awesome) recently left and they haven't replaced her yet. Which is part of this mess, no one has any idea what they are doing. (Going out on leave is going to be fuuuuun.)  It would have been fine if my boss had just told me ""hey I need to get this in writing, can you send me an email?"", but instead it had to be drama and getting people involved who have no business being involved. Ugh."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,traveler5678,2,Wed Jun 17 16:54:37 2015 UTC,Just wanted to weigh in - I completely agree with u/pamplemousse2.  That was handled inappropriately.  That sucks that there's no HR person right now.  I would document everything just in case.

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,gizmo_love,3,Wed Jun 17 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's just frustrating since I'm so afraid of miscarrying but he gets so stupidly paranoid so I have to brush him off and tell him it's fine (lately it's that he won't play his bluetooth radio because the waves might hurt the baby).

My husband was getting weird about food stuff and I was like, here's the book, we're not discussing it further until you read this section. My husband won't really sit down and read the whole thing, but being able to point him to the relevant bits has helped some.   She does talk about sleep positions (though I don't think stomach down, just cause, most very pregnant ladies don't want to be a teeter totter). But the whole back vs side, left vs right, and she has scientific data to prove her point (that it doesn't matter, just sleep however is comfortable for you.)"

I'm starting to find it uncomfy to sleep on my stomach, but have zero bump (overweight and tall, I won't have anything vaguely resembling a pregnant belly for months).

I told her that it was weird, things had tapered off and then started up again and described it. She (very apologetically lol) said it sounded like I'd had a period. wtf?! I don't ovulate or get periods at all pre-pregnancy and now I get one like 5 weeks post-partum while EBF.

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,becabecaful,3,Wed Jun 17 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"I had to have the day off my work placement today, I slept solid til midnight then could only doze until the morning. I ended up feeling sick as anything and with a headache. Then to top it off I was in bed for the night, coughed and threw up on myself a little. Argh."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,Iamagnu,3,Wed Jun 17 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"I had my 6-week PP appointment this morning, and all looks good! When I got back, though, I deadpanned to Mr. gnu that the doc said we needed to wait longer for sex, though, and then pulled a ""just kidding."" Seriously, though, even though we are cleared for sex, I'm a bit nervous about it. Anyone have any positive first time postpartum stories?  We are having our horrible kitchen floor ripped up and replaced, starting this morning. (It was supposed to happen months ago, but the guy handling the order screwed up massively and then left the company abruptly.) We didn't want mini breathing the floor dust all day, so I took her with me to the doctor this morning while Mr. gnu was at home with the workers, and then I came home and he took her to work with him. Apparently she's a big hit with his coworkers. Plus, we kenneled the kitties this morning to keep them away from the flooring work, so I am all alone in the house! (Well, except for the workers. And my trusty breast pump.) All I want to do is nap, but I can't do that with the workers here. Bah.  I never posted after mini gnu's baby naming the other day--it was awesome! We had tons of friends and family there, and it felt so wonderful to have everyone celebrating with us and exclaiming over her cuteness! My brother, his wife, and their 7-and-a-half year old couldn't make it to the naming but they came Saturday night and stayed with us until this morning. It was terrific to have the extra hands around to hold the kiddo when she was fussing, and it turns out my brother, who is not exactly a warm and fuzzy guy, is kind of the baby whisperer. He's an expert in the 5 Ss! And it was so cool to see my little niece, who is the most wonderful kid, with her baby cousin.  Hey, the guys are done for the day! Naptime, here I come!!!"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,montanadoodle,3,Wed Jun 17 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"Our first time postpartum wasn't terrible. Lube was definitely necessary, but it didn't really hurt. It was uncomfortable the first few times, but was back to normal fairly quick.   I'm glad baby gnu's baby naming went so well! I love seeing family interact with babies."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,Hopecat,3,Wed Jun 17 19:12:30 2015 UTC,Our first time postpartum I did have an orgasm - it took some attention but it literally brought me to tears (in the best of ways). Just be slow and take it easy!
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,jodi15,3,Wed Jun 17 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"Today was my very last appointment at the fertility clinic. It was so bittersweet! I  now will only see my regular gyn. Such a long journey for my husband and I.  I can't explain the feeling of separation I felt walking out of the clinic.  I wanted to cry like a child being dropped off at daycare,  but refrained.  I didn't want to seem unstable.  Lol.  I  did,  however,  go to a bakery called Nothing Bundt Cakes and purchased them a chocolate chocolate chip cake with cream cheese icing! They were happy to see me return,  and I got to hug them all and say a heartfelt thank you.  I'm 11 weeks now,  and will be 41 years old next month.  I will miss them a lot,  but am happy to have ""graduated"" and progressing forward."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,cakegroove,2,Wed Jun 17 23:50:30 2015 UTC,I love the cake idea! My last RE appt is next week. I think I'll borrow your idea! Congrats on graduating!

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,razzertto,4,Thu Jun 18 14:17:17 2015 UTC,"Tried to have sex yesterday for the first time and it was... painful. We used a lot of lube and yet, ugh, it felt like I was being ripped apart. I ended up needing to stop. For you postpartum ladies who are still nursing, does it get better?   Lately we've been talking about having a second child like it's a given. Which is weird because I FUCKING HATED BEING PREGNANT with all of my might but yet we're still considering it. What the hell, stupid evolutionarily-designed-to-procreate-brain?  In other news, LL is on the mend. Her cough is nearly gone and the pimple thingy is staph but not the super serious kind. So, yay! Also, she's been in bed since 11 pm last night with only two tiny feedings. I feel amazing."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,montanadoodle,3,Wed Jun 17 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"The sex gets better. Lube is your friend. Our first time was 5 weeks postpartum, and at this point things are pretty much back to normal.   I'm glad LL is feeling better!"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,jaina_jade,2,Wed Jun 17 16:02:29 2015 UTC,happy to hear that LL is doing better - and that she let you get some sleep!
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jun 17 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yay LL!   Yes, sex gets better. But everyone has a different pace. Maybe try everything but P in V for a bit, and try again in a couple weeks. Not worth worrying about at this point! (Although frustrating. For sure.)"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,lancealittle,2,Wed Jun 17 16:18:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely was dry as hell the whole time I was nursing -- all 2.5 years of it, even when it was once per day. Lube certainly helped sex, but I don't remember if we tried that early. It's all a haze . . ."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,OrganizedSprinkles,2,Wed Jun 17 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"Use this for anything you want to do down there on either, your choice.  I don't get the preggo thing either, getting pregnant was awful, being pregnant was awful, labor was awful, still struggling with some post labor effects. Can't wait to do it again. Really brain."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,Hopecat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Oh god I thought it was just me. We're having sex frequently but it's harder for me than pre-baby. Also, afterwards it feels fairly uncomfortable regardless of lube or not.  I'm both happy and sad to hear I'm not alone in this side effect!"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,larabair,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:20:08 2015 UTC,"It gets better. Slow, shallow, and Slippery Stuff. But with BB's schedule my libido has tanked, and I feel awful about it. Glad you're not having that problem too!"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,PrincessCBHammock,4,Wed Jun 17 20:57:30 2015 UTC,"I'm finally starting to feel better after  the UTI and having some serious morning/all day sickness. I actually cleaned the house and got some bills paid and caught up on everything that went on the back burner last week while I napped when the boys napped. Of course now that I feel better, there's obviously no way I can be pregnant anymore. Hashtag lifetime infertility problems"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,razzertto,3,Wed Jun 17 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're feeling better and I'm in awe that you're able to manage twin boys (under 1, what the heck), be pregnant and still manage to clean the house. I can barely manage to cook dinner with a three month old."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,PrincessCBHammock,2,Wed Jun 17 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"Aaww thank you but well, that's the key, I seriously maybe cook once a week, if that. I just can't."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,pamplemousse2,2,Wed Jun 17 14:48:12 2015 UTC,Of course you can't! That's too much. Pretty much the only way I cook dinner is if husband is watching the kiddo. That you do it once a week is huge! Good work!
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,magical_realist,2,Wed Jun 17 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"I have three more days of work including today, then I will be off work for over a year -- sick leave for chronic hypertension until I give birth, then a year of maternity leave. I'm not sure how to feel about it... I mean, I'm thrilled about the maternity leave because it'll be awesome to have so much time with baby, but there's still a couple months til he arrives (hopefully) and I'm concerned that I can only do so much cat petting and baby clothes folding. There's also anxiety about my job... how will it change with me being gone so long? Will they still want me when I get back, or will they be looking for excuses to get rid of me? Will we be okay on my reduced salary? And so on. Overall I know it's a good thing but I can't help but feel a bit anxious about it."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jun 17 15:10:23 2015 UTC,I think it's natural to be anxious about such a big change! Especially with the time off before delivery. Do you have any small projects you can tackle? I definitely feel you on the concerns about work. It's such a big part of our lives and then to have so many unknowns thrown into the mix is tough.
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,magical_realist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"I have a few little projects in mind, I'll have to scope out a few more! You're right, work is such a huge part of life that right now I'm having trouble picturing my life without it."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"We can swap project ideas. ; ) Do you sew at all? I'm planning to make some stuffed animals while on bedrest. Maybe do some embroidery. I find handwork relaxing, so that's a nice bonus benefit. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,magical_realist,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not very good at sewing, but I have made a sock monkey before so I was thinking of making some sort of sock-based animal. I also really want to do a mobile like this: http://www.peekaboopages.com/2012/05/hello-nap-time-crafters-my-name-is.html though maybe with double-sided tape instead of sewing every edge."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"With basic, high contrast designs like that you could even paint them, since sewing isn't your thing.  A mobile is an excellent idea! I'd been planning to buy one for over the changing table. Hmmmm. : )"
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,magical_realist,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"True, painting on cardstock could work well. I've read that black and white mobiles absolutely entrance babies, and it's good for their eye development."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"I've heard that as well. Plus, they have such a graphic punch. I think they are really fun designs. : )  You might find that the cardstock curls on you when you paint it...I wonder if you could find a pack of cheap coasters--wood or stone or something--to paint on. Or, even better, craft stores usually have small, thin wood shapes. It depends on the look you are going for, but it might be an easier way to get there. : )"

InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,OrganizedSprinkles,2,Thu Jun 18 18:54:28 2015 UTC,In the US we get about 3 months and is hard to deal when a person goes out. How do you handle it there? Also what country is this magical year long leave?
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,magical_realist,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"Canada. Basically how it works is your job is obligated to allow you up to 52 weeks of unpaid leave, then EI pays you up to 55% of your salary during the leave. So, you do take a financial hit and not everyone can afford to stay off work that long -- I do recognize that I'm definitely lucky in that regard. It's split into 15 weeks of maternity leave which can only be taken by a mother immediately after giving birth, and then 35 weeks parental leave which can be taken by either parent after birth or adoption, or divided between the parents. We decided my husband wouldn't use any of the parental leave because we can't afford for him to have his salary cut in half.  It's up to the company how they want to cope with it -- they could temporarily move an existing employee to cover your role, hire someone new on a temporary year-long contract, hire several people on shorter contracts, etc. I think my work is planning to hire someone on a four-month contract and then extend it if it goes well because my boss doesn't want to be stuck with someone for a whole year if they're not good at the job. When you come off the maternity leave, they're obligated to give you back your old position OR one of equal or better status. It's not easy for the company, but it is fairly accepted/expected and there are laws in places to protect women from pregnancy discrimination."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,ivf_lizz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"Almost every country except the US has paid maternity leave of at least 6 months.   Of note is Norway, which has 16 months of leave, 3 of which MUST be taken by the father."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,OrganizedSprinkles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:13:55 2015 UTC,Ugh I would love if my husband could have done the first 3 months with me. Instead nectar he got really sick at the beginning of the year and has no time left he could only take one day off. Conveniently babe was born on a Friday afternoon.
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,female_engineer_here,2,Thu Jun 18 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"I'm 14 weeks now, and I'm still nauseated pretty often (and vomiting at least once every other day).  Did anyone else experience this?  I'm so tired of the updates telling me I'm probably feeling better...when will I feel better???  Otherwise, life is good here."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,jaina_jade,2,Wed Jun 17 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"I'm the wrong person to ask as I'm 17wks tomorrow and still vomiting on a regular basis.  I'm on two different medications and my ob/gyn is now hoping to have my off at least one of them by 20wks, however they won't discuss that until I've gone at least a week without throwing up."
InfertilityBabies,3a5sdr,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jun 17 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"I was queasy everyday, but only vomitting about once a week. The last time I actually threw up was week 16. Still get occasionally queasy. I'm on diclegis for the nausea and am just now (Week 22) considering going off it."

InfertilityBabies,3a1r7u,Bibbityboo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:04:21 2015 UTC,Darn! My original intention was for Canadians because I know insurance doesn't cover them but I didn't put it in the blurb....twice. So sorry! Hopefully you can track on down. I see them on Craigslist and our local FB seller page from $50-99. If you want me to keep an eye out to nab you one and mail it let me know. I'd be happy to help.
InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,TigFan15,15,Tue Jun 16 15:42:53 2015 UTC,On Saturday night my blood pressure skyrocketed and did not go down with medication. The doctors put me on magnesium sulphate and then the baby's heart rate showed some decels. It was decided then to do a c-section at 28 weeks 4 days. My little girl born 6:16am on June 14th. She is now in the NICU and seems to be doing okay. The toughest part was not being able to see her for 24 hours as they had me on magnesium sulphate to prevent seizure or stroke.  I know I haven't really posted much but I really appreciated the support when I was going through this tough time.
InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,petite_chou,2,Tue Jun 16 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"Thinking about you and sending all my love to you and your little girl.  Good luck and keep us posted, please."

InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,petite_chou,3,Tue Jun 16 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I am feeling better. Just waiting for my blood pressure to be stabilized then I won't be tied to check-ins every 4 hours. The meds they put me on, magnesium sulphate, put me in a honeymoon period for my blood pressure so they won't discharge me for a couple more days to ensure it doesn't spike again. The nicu is stressful, constant change and things happening around her. I have only been able to touch her once (she grabbed my pinky finger). It's so surreal that I'm no longer pregnant and am trying my best to connect with this baby who I love more than anything but can't touch or hold."
InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"I had a really hard time when my kiddo was in the nicu too.

Hang in there. It's a total 180 from where you expected tool be at this point. Feel free to PM me if you need to chat."
InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,spankyjubblies,2,Tue Jun 16 21:47:13 2015 UTC,Sending you good thoughts. I know how hard it is! How long before you get to do kangaroo care? It makes all the difference in the world.
InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,petite_chou,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure how long. Right now she is on a limited contact order but they are doing something to her every 30 minutes or so. They change her position, fix her lines etc. Right now they are starting a blood transfusion because she wasn't born with enough blood.   I hope we get to kangaroo care soon. The only thing I can do for her now is to start pumping."
InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,pamplemousse2,2,Tue Jun 16 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"And you can be by her side, and talk to her, and rest up so that you're in good shape when she's running you ragged at 3 am. I mean it - she knows when you're by her bed. Just being there is doing a lot for her."

All negative, because, of course. I just can't stop the what ifs. I hate that it is drilled in our heads that we will just suddenly become pregnant after giving birth if our SOs even look at us. According to my app I have 15 more days to my next period, if the first one was one, maybe with two under my belt my brain will stop being stupid? Maybe?  Enough ranting, to make me somewhat happy, I have turned to Cheetos. I have been wanting these damn things for like a week now! Not the path to weight loss, but I give not a fuck (at this moment)."
InfertilityBabies,3a1s6h,larabair,3,Tue Jun 16 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"Things are just chugging along here. Been mostly focusing on sorting out finances so we can finally start looking for a new place. Getting a bit worried that things are taking longer and longer -- I don't want to be signing for a mortgage at 38 weeks! I want to be settled.  Sadly, this means riding my husband a bit. Taxes need to get filed, then rental unit mortgage renewed, then qualify for the new mortgage. I hate organizing all this stuff, but also secretly enojy checking things off a list!"

I feel like I'm constantly on the cusp of just like, giving out.  My legs and ankles are tired and sore.  My mid-back/rib areas, well nothing new there.  Even more arms are tired from carrying/folding laundry.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but I think I might finally understand why people say they're happy with everything, but just DONE with everything.  Kind of just want to float in a cold pool and watch the clouds go by.    Monday is cloth diaper prepping day.  An all day project, just can't wait!  Also, in general, washing (and more so, folding) baby clothes is obnoxious and tedious."

Right now we still have our newborn rental stuff but I just went through the local store's experiment-to-own and picked up a bunch of covers with snap-ins (e.g. Growvia) because I am wary of pockets but they are sort of like pockets. At home I want to stick with fitteds and prefolds (because cheap).  Would love to hear what you think of alvas - they seem cute and affordable! Also are you at r/clothdiaps yet? It is dangerous.

InfertilityBabies,3a0j6a,reidiate,4,Tue Jun 16 07:27:18 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Blood is scary. We totally get it.  I had a subchorionic hematoma and I bled for a month. It was probably one of the hardestthings for me to go through, I was scared every single day. So I completely understand your fear.  If you are not experiencing pain (and my understanding is it would be significant pain), and constant cramping then this is a really good sign.  If the bleeding is easing up, this is a really good sign.  Brown bleeding is a sign of older blood, this is a really good sign.  At this point, I can't tell you that everything is going to be ok. I can tell you that everything you've described is sort of ""best case"" scenario if you have to have bleeding. I can also tell you I bled a lot more than that adn am now at 15w4d and everything is good. Right now, its just about keeping yourself busy, trying to manage your fears, and remembering that a lot of people make it out ok.   Hang in there!"
InfertilityBabies,3a0j6a,Bibbityboo,3,Tue Jun 16 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"So I had pretty much the exact same bleeding around week 9. It was just enough to really stain my underwear bad but not enough to fill a bad and then it stopped. Just a teeny bit of leftovers when I wiped and finally a teeny bit of brown blood. I went for an emergency ultrasound the next day and baby was there, perfectly healthy, heartbeat normal, measuring right on track.   It's entirely possible that everything is totally fine, especially as you didn't have any further bleeding. My baby (boy!) is still doing great at 17 weeks!"
InfertilityBabies,3a0j6a,revangelfire,2,Tue Jun 16 13:32:02 2015 UTC,"Spotting can be completely normal.  I had it with both of my pregnancies.  The first pregnancy, I had it twice:  once at 5 weeks and once at 16 weeks.  Both times it was unexplained, but everything was fine.  With my second pregnancy, I had it around 28 weeks.  Again, unexplained but fine.  I can relate to the anxiety you are feeling; it's completely normal.  I remember telling myself over and over:  ""One day at a time.  I can get through today."""
InfertilityBabies,3a0j6a,sonirose,2,Tue Jun 16 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"I had filled an pair of underwear with blood in one day. Turned out it was a hemorrhage/blood clot which my U/S technician said are actually common with IVF pregnancies (and can happen with non-IVF pregnancies also so don't worry). As long as the bleeding is slowing down that's a good sign.  Just take it easy, basically put yourself on bed rest. If you work an active job try taking a couple of sick days. If you work a desk job you should be fine, just no lifting or taking a bunch of stairs. I had to wear a pad all that day and a panty liner all the next. I know it's hard, but just take every precaution that you can control. Just rest, drink lots of fluids, and keep your mind busy/stay off Dr. Google (although, you may want to just briefly google subchorionic hemorrhage to show yourself how many women have it.)"
InfertilityBabies,3a0j6a,gizmo_love,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:56:59 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. It's great advice. Dr Google is killing me for every post I read about someone being fine I read one about missed miscarriage or molar pregnancy. I wish I liked in the time before Internet search engines.
InfertilityBabies,3a0j6a,gizmo_love,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:41:04 2015 UTC,"haha, don't we all. The hardest thing is the waiting. So many women go through bleeding, a lot of the time around the very beginning of the first trimester. It is the scariest experience when you don't know what's happening and if you should have any hope or not. Just one more day and then you'll know. Until then just rest and drink plenty of water."
InfertilityBabies,3a0j6a,PrincessCBHammock,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"How many embryos did you transfer? I had pretty much the exact same scenario and it ended up being twins and the bleeding was just my uterus making room. This time I'm pregnant with just one and still bleeding, sometimes there's a hematoma and sometimes they just have no idea what causes it. If you aren't feeling any cramping and it's just spotting you're probably totally OK.   ETA it is pretty early so you MIGHT not see a heartbeat yet."

If you're worried you can always message your clinic. I do that for every little worry I have. Basically I'm told to keep an eye on it, if it continues then make an appointment (depending on the issue, for them ""continues"" was 3 days for an all day issue or 3 occurrences for singular issues that come and go).  Just make your OB aware, they're used to first time pregnancies and I've always warned my clinic that I'm a first timer with a history of miscarriages and multiple IVFs so I'm admittedly high maintenance. They never seemed grumpy about my questions. :)"

I'm just sort of assuming this is some major stretching going on and hoping this means I'll be showing soon. I""ve also noticed that rolling over, coughing, sneezing, sudden laughs etc. are kind of painful.  Also, sometimes when my belly hurts, peeing is all I need to do to relieve it."

I think this has been the bulk of the gigantic mess of emotions that infertility causes, at least for me - not just its effects, but that my choices and actions don't mean that I will get the outcome I want.  So much in life, especially in American society, there is this mentality that if you work hard at something, you will achieve success... And that is a big fat lie, especially when it comes to infertility."
InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly!  Like, literally you can try until the cows come home and you're blue in the face, but if you don't have thousands of dollars at the ready to shell out, well, it's all for naught.  So like you said, you can be ready and willing to try, try, try all you want, but even if you do get a chance, it doesn't even mean it's guaranteed to work."
InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,septicidal,2,Mon Jun 15 13:33:43 2015 UTC,"One thing that has helped me cope with difficult stuff is to envision the worst case scenario and figure out ways that I would deal with it.  It helps me feel like, even if the absolute worst happens, I know I can figure out a way forward.  My husband and I definitely want more than one child but I don't know how easily I could go through more treatments once I have a little one.  Especially since my husband and I are talking a lot about me leaving my job (financially it looks like we would come out very similarly, after taxes, etc. if I stopped working vs. keeping my job and paying for childcare), my insurance would cease to be the awesome plan through my employer which covered most all of the costs for medicated cycles, except for high co-pays on some of the medications.  I know there is some coverage through the plans available through my husband's work, but I don't think it's as good as the coverage I have now, and if our budget is already tighter I don't know how we would afford the extra costs.  I am lucky in the sense that I have a very treatable cause for my fertility issues (PCOS) and there have been times I've ovulated without medication, it's just infrequent and with short luteal phases (which suggests poor egg quality).  There is a chance that if I lose weight and continue to control my insulin resistance, that could improve, but there are no guarantees."
InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,apanda1084,7,Mon Jun 15 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"That every stage I pass through with my son may be the very first and very last at the same time.       I have this thought constantly and it breaks my fucking heart. I am always reminding myself to try to enjoy every moment with this little dude, because of the possibility of never experiencing any of it again, and then a little part of me dies, then I kick myself for being sad - basically I am caught in this vicious loop of being happy he is here and looking at him terrified he may be the only one.  I have always wanted a second in the very least, three was my ideal before this bullshit. I could have written pretty much half of this post. Even if I wanted to stop at one for some reason, I want so bad for it to be my husband and my choice. Sucks so bad."
InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"Same - I hate being so sad during times I should be so happy.  I have a horrible temper and of course, lack of sleep can do a number on you, so I hate to say that I've been so cranky lately and even snapping at a freaking baby when I can't take it anymore.  That just makes me feel even worse because I'm being so horrible when this may be the only time I have such a small baby.  I'm the type of person that really regrets missed moments, so it just hits me really hard."
InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,Bibbityboo,4,Mon Jun 15 14:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm still pregnant with my first but I completely feel the same way already. We had a talk not too long ago, acknowledging that we were so lucky that our first IVF worked. My husband brought up that he didn't know if he'd be ok paying for a second round for a sibling, and I can completely see where he is coming from. It's a lot of money that we don't have. If we suck it up and find a way, would we be denying out first child something? Coukd that money be better paying for classes, sports or university? How do you weigh it all out?   I'm going through this process with the feeling that this will most likely be our only child, despite our druthers. If I have a girl, I will mourn never having a son. If I have a son, I will mourn never having a daughter. I feel that no matter what the out come is, I will need to grieve for the future I dreamt of but can't have.   We have one embryo frozen and I'm worried about how much pressure I will be putting on it."

I hate how much money we've spent on this shit and will continue to spend, especially when we live comfortably, but are nowhere near ""well off.""  Every bill worth hundreds of dollars hurts and I do think about my son each time; how much that money could go towards his future schooling or a new toy I'd love to get for him or a family vacation we could take."
InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,kat_loves_tea,2,Mon Jun 15 14:13:00 2015 UTC,It definitely doesn't feel fair that's for sure. I think it's ok and completely possible to be happy and grateful for the kid(s) you have and still struggle with not having the numbers you want.

InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,MrsDragon,3,Tue Jun 16 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I have sixteen month old twins and I'm pretty sure I don't want more kids, but I don't feel sure enough to put my remaining embryos up for adoption. It's $700 a year for storage, we can afford it, but it feels wasteful to keep paying it when I don't think I want more (twins have been hard). On the other hand what if in two years I want another and I can't have one because we decided not to keep storing the embryos. I hate that finances have to play a part in these decisions."

InfertilityBabies,39wr3l,motherofdragoons,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"That's been my way of thinking, too, but our storage fees amount to $1060 a year, though.  As much as that is it's still too difficult to think about donating them.  If we donate the embryo, we can used the frozen sperm, but have to go through a fresh IVF cycle all over again (which then may result in more freezable embryos.)  If we destroy the sperm, then we can pursue an FET, but if that fails and we want to keep going, we have to have my husband go through another aspiration procedures which could fail THEN go through another fresh cycle.  The storage fees are definitely worthwhile right now, but I don't want to keep paying $1k a year for the next X number of years because we can't decide what to do."

InfertilityBabies,39x39j,WhateverYouSay1084,3,Mon Jun 15 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"My husband and I just had this fight last night actually. He seems so detached from the entire experience and hasn't once mentioned wanting to go shopping or look at baby stuff. Even at the gender scan ultrasound on Sunday, he didn't have a lot to say.   It turns out he just doesn't really know HOW to act because he hates being the center of attention and it makes him really awkward. He also has a sister who puts herself in the spotlight with every pregnancy she has, so he is determined not to be like that and is taking it too far. I told him he is ruining this experience, which may be the only time we ever get to go through all of this. I think it kind of opened his eyes that he needs to loosen up a bit and not be afraid to show excitement.   I think it's great that you talked it out and came to a resolution. I also think that, for men, it's a little harder to become attached to the idea of a baby because they aren't experiencing the signs and symptoms like we are. For now, the baby is just a hypothetical blurry picture on an ultrasound machine. It may not feel real to him until that baby is actually out and he gets to interact with him/her. I totally understand your disappointment and I think you did the right thing by voicing it before the resentment built up too much."
InfertilityBabies,39x39j,jos9143,3,Mon Jun 15 16:29:20 2015 UTC,"Husband here. I think this is definitely true, though it begins to feel more real when your wife starts to overtly show.    Also, it is common for men to suddenly be afraid of the imminent arrival of a child and what it means for their future, relationship, finances, role, etc.  Many men react to that kind of turmoil by detaching. I think this is true for fertile people as well, although it is accentuated in infertility when many men already choose/feel compelled to be more emotionally ""strong""/detached so as to help out their wives.  Also, some guys (like me) just aren't into the baby shopping experience.  Like I don't really like going into the big box baby stores - something about all those pastels creeps me out.  And I find all the theoretical things one can buy to be unnecessarily overwhelming...so I tend to let my wife handle this stuff.  Whereas putting together the nursery, ikea shopping, etc tended to get my creative/home improvement juices flowing.  TL;DR Give it time, men tend to get more excited later. And just because they don't like shopping doesn't mean they won't like being a father."

My husband got excited when he heard the heartbeat for the first time, saw the baby on the ultrasound and felt kicks. I hope the ""realness"" doesn't wane. He just doesn't have a preference about a lot of the baby gear and is easily overwhelmed right now. He's also one that needs a lot lot lot of praise and recognition when he does do things so when my pace drives me to move on quickly to the next thing, he needs to have more time to bask in the accomplishment of the last task."

I try and do the home doppler with him around so he can hear too, but he's just indifferent. I try and ask him to research things (like car seats) and he just isn't motivated. And then he acts confused when I have a break down because there's so much goddamn stuff that needs to be sorted -- we have a mortgage to renew on our rental, a second mortgage to qualify for and a townhouse to buy before the baby gets here ON TOP OF all the standard baby stuff. I feel like I can't seem to light a fire under his butt, and he seems genuinely flustered when I get frustrated. Yes, I'm normally the organizer. Its what I do for a living, I'm just better at it than he is, but I need help right now. I need help with that, and I need help embracing the baby thing. I can't do either on my own.  I wish I had friends around me pregnant so that we could at least go out together. We can't afford most of the baby things, so will be going with basics, but like you, I want to pick up the cute things, I want to hem and haw about them, then I want to find reasons why I don't want them.

He cleared out the office furniture to make way for the nursery and is doing a lot around the house to get things ready. He just doesn't have a huge preference about baby gear.   I want to bask too!

I wanted to be joyful but instead I am just anxious and cranky from feeling so gross.  Is there someone other than your husband who can go coo over baby things with you?  Maybe a friend or friendly coworker?  It's helped me a bit to have other people be excited for me."
InfertilityBabies,39x39j,female_engineer_here,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:59:16 2015 UTC,Are you wearing any maternity clothes yet? I gradually started around 12w and it was so much more comfortable.
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,KatiexS,4,Mon Jun 15 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"I've been to terrified to post an introduction here (I've always had bad anxiety) but we had an US today and I'm 6w3d and I saw the heart beat.  It was amazing, then he turned the sound on and I heard it, I started sobbing.    We saw the sack last week and it didn't quite feel real yet but after today I feel much much better about everything."
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,dobberkins,3,Mon Jun 15 21:21:31 2015 UTC,You may see the heartbeat flicker at 6 weeks but not always.  They can start measuring the crown-to-rump length to date the pregnancy but it can be off given how small a fetus is at 6 weeks (smaller than a lentil). It's more accurate by 8-10 weeks.  I remember the 6 week US as being mostly to rule out an ectopic (which you don't have - yay!).  Good luck with the betas
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,jos9143,2,Mon Jun 15 20:02:04 2015 UTC,"If you don't see the heartbeat, don't freak out!  It can still be too early at 6 weeks.  I saw heartbeats at both of my 6-week ultrasounds, but they were actually done at 6 weeks and 3-4 days."
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,sonirose,2,Mon Jun 15 20:40:44 2015 UTC,I saw the heartbeat at 6+5 but 6 weeks exactly may be just a bit too early so don't panic if you don't see anything. You will probably also see a tiny kidney bean looking thing with a balloon attached -- the balloon is the yolk sac and it's quite a bit bigger than the embryo at that point.
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Mon Jun 15 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks, and we could see the heartbeat on the screen.  You can't hear it yet though.  And mostly, it looks like a little white blip in an otherwise giant black space.  Not a whole lot of cute yet!  But, it's there :)"

InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,cakegroove,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"Our 6 week was 6+ a few days. We could see yolk sacs, blobs which were babies and, if you squinted just right, faint flickering heart beats."
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:52:19 2015 UTC,"There wasn't a ton to see when we went, you could see the balloon of the yolk sac, a bean for the baby (really couldn't tell one end from the other!) and we saw the flickering heart beat (heard as well). We were a couple of days past 6 weeks so don't panic if you can't hear the heartbeat, it starts right around this time, so its possible you'll be just a couple of days early"
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"I had my first ultrasound at 6w2d.  Bean was measuring 5w6d, we had a fetal pole, yolk sac, everything looked great but no heartbeat (CRL of 3.21mm).  So I had the most anxiety/panic week of my life, went back at 7w1d.  Measured 7.92 mm and had a heartbeat of 119.  Graduated from my RE to my OBGYN.  I know that it's impossible not to freak out, but try not to stress if there's no heartbeat.  Now I'm just sitting antsy until my next appointment at 10 weeks.  Edit:  numbers are hard."
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,GetOutYourCane,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:32:04 2015 UTC,I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks 3 days and saw the flicker of the heart beat. It's totally possible but don't freak out if for some reason you can't see it yet. Good luck! It sounds like everything is going well :)
InfertilityBabies,39y6yt,healthylurker,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"We were able to see both sacs and hear both heartbeats at 5w6d at my RE's, which my ob/gyn told me they wouldn't be able to do at his office that early.  It's less about how far along you are and more about if your doctor has newer equipment or not."

Apparently, this makes it the best day ever lol.  Watching them practice their graduation day songs made me tear up.  Im gonna be a mess on wednesday, even though most of these kids are moving up to PS with me (just got offered the room change, so excited!)  Also, my MIL offered to pay my certification fee to the state.  We definitely have the money,  I was just pouting that they were making me pay again.  Whatevs, I'll take your money!  NST again today.  So silly.  Im cancelling the one on Friday, Id actually rather be at work for my last day.  Today, after that, is bathroom purging day.  Everything must go!    Edit: NST showed two bigger (felt, but not painful) contractions in 50 minutes, so much better than Friday.  She said I was showing some ""irritability"" on the screen.  Still not worried, and I'll be checked on Thurs for dilation.  But, my doctor does want bi-weekly now...so, sigh."
InfertilityBabies,39xk8u,SJP8,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:59:47 2015 UTC,Free money is the best!  I have an NST scheduled for tomorrow assuming baby doesn't come.  What should I expect?
InfertilityBabies,39xk8u,dutchqueen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Being bored, probably :)  But in all seriousness, they just put one little sensor over baby's general area to catch the heartbeat, and one nearby to catch potential contractions.  Theyre usually looking for baby's heartrate to accelerate because of movement at least twice in a 20 minute period.  The nurse recommended having some juice before to make sure baby is awake and moving.  Then you just kind of sit and stare at the wall.  Bring something to do!  They say its only 20 minutes, and I know I might be a special snowflake, but mine have been 40m, 1 hour, and 2 hours (that one was yucky)."

I'm not a fan of storms to begin with but him being gone made it so much worse.  I put both cats into their carrying case just on the chance the tornados actually touched down and I'd have to rush to the scary, yucky basement.  They were not pleased with me.  Needless to say, I'm very tired today.  I think I managed maybe 5 hours and it was all up and down.  Boo for this weather."

But...today, I looked down at them and noticed what I thought was dry flaky skin on the tips. I rubbed it off (the skin, you pervs!), and realized it wasn't like skin, per say, but more like little white, dried threads coming out of the nipples. I'm 90% sure its not just dry skin.

InfertilityBabies,39xc29,cakegroove,3,Mon Jun 15 15:50:26 2015 UTC,Your mfm and ob will work together. Usually your ob handles delivery and mfm just provides more monitoring. Every time I went to the mfm I had a growth check via ultrasound. I saw my mfm monthly until I went into hospital bed rest and saw them almost daily.
InfertilityBabies,39xc29,erinrae0814,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"I can tell you what our experience has been:  Our OB is considered our primary doctor. She will deliver the babies and does checkups on her regular schedule of about once per month. She handles routine pregnancy concerns and prescribes things like prenatal vitamins.  Our MFM is looking specifically for issues. They did a detailed ultrasound at 12 weeks to check for down syndrome (bonus, they were able to tell us the sexes). They did the blood work for both down syndrome and tris. They are doing ultrasounds every two weeks to check cervical length and, as we get further along will be doing growth scans to check that the boys are developing evenly. They are the ones that put me on bed rest and prescribes the progesterone and antibiotics based on the results of my cervical check.  We get an ultrasound every time we go but not pictures. The cervical check is transvaginal and you can't really see the boys that way anymore. They do also check heartbeats with a quick traditional ultrasound, so we do get to see them and they will tell us which way they are laying etc if we ask, but it's not like the early scans where they are taking their time and printing pictures.  A lot of this depends on your MFM, some people's MFMs only do cervical checks every 3-4 weeks, in which case you wouldn't be seeing them as often."
InfertilityBabies,39xc29,MrsDragon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:24:29 2015 UTC,"Your MFM can be your primary OB - you don't have to have two separate doctors. At least that's how it worked for me - my MFM was the only OB I saw after my RE. I always had ultrasounds, and my MFM delivered the twins."

InfertilityBabies,39xc29,Ishslittleone,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what we did. I had a choice since it was twins. I loved my OB so I chose to continue seeing her and designated her as my primary doc. My MFM was for anatomy scans and consults only as long as things looked good. The minute I showed signs of danger, like twin to twin transfer or slowed growth or gestational diabetes or anything, we agreed he would take over.   I stayed healthy and my OB delivered my twins. But it was nice to know I had an extra set of eyes on us. I was high risk for a blood disorder, too, so I saw my OB, my MFM, and a hematologist throughout my pregnancy.   I never went more than 2 weeks without being seen. I loved that.    ETA our schedule: I saw each doc once a month until 28 weeks. We made sure to offset all appointments so I didn't see two docs in one week. That meant I was being closely watched almost every week. I suggest doing this. Those few times I had to go two weeks without seeing someone made me a nervous wreck."

We've seen them without their c-pap masks on a few times now & Asher looks just like me while Sebastian looks more like husband (but still a bit like me too).   Husband has taken to fatherhood so well. He is so involved and has charmed all the nurses with his enthusiasm and obvious love for our boys. During kangaroo care he sings and tells stories. It's the sweetest thing.   My belly is all gone (which makes me sad) and I'm down 15lbs from my pre-pregnancy weight (which doesn't make me sad), putting me back at my pre-IVF weight. I've been eating pretty healthily (healthfully?) and I'm hoping that that combined with pumping will help me shed some more pounds. I'm going to try wearing real clothes today for the first time since being admitted to the hospital. Hopefully I'll be pleasantly surprised at the fit."

A good friend of mine had her baby boy just after viability, he was definitely born under 2 lbs, spent nearly 3 mos in the NICU, and he is thriving.  He is now 3 years old and an all-around awesome kid.  I'm not sure if hope stories help any, but your boys are on the right path.    I'm sure you'll be back to your fabulous looking self in no time :)."

InfertilityBabies,39sq68,honmamichin,9,Sun Jun 14 19:22:45 2015 UTC,It's a BOY! I was afraid I would be disappointed because initially we both wanted a girl...but I'm not at all. Time to start shopping!
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Sun Jun 14 18:50:47 2015 UTC,Congrats ! How was the ultrasound? I guess it was pretty noticeable? Lol got me even more excited for Tuesday !
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,Queen_Red,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"Very noticeable once he was in the right position, even with simple 2D. They may be tiny but you can still tell what you're looking at. It was so neat! He was in there making these gasping gestures and the tech said he was practicing swallowing or something. So cool. You will love it."

That's how I felt too... always thought it would be a girl, but it's a boy and we are SO thrilled..... hubby can't wait to raise his mini me, and I can't wait to have my Momma's boy :P  Congratulations, what a great day!"
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,WhateverYouSay1084,3,Sun Jun 14 19:14:17 2015 UTC,"Aw. I'm so glad it all works out. I know a couple of people who experienced extreme gender disappointment and I was really scared that I would feel it too and ruin the experience...but I think this whole infertility experience just makes you so grateful to get this far, it doesn't really matter what you end up with. And when I worked at a preschool, my favorite babies were always the boys. They were so so cuddly. We are lucky ladies, you and I."
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,revangelfire,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:30:18 2015 UTC,Congrats on the boy!! We expected one too because three couples in my family had girls this year and were shocked at first at finding out we were having a boy but now are so excited! It's amazing how many people ask if that is what we wanted and I honestly just keep saying that after all the stuff we went through we just want a healthy baby.

Its hot as hell here early in the season, amd we live in a building that is primarily brick/concrete...great for winter, sucks in the summer.  So excited to finally get this going.  I did a lot of random stuff this morning that I've been pushing off, so I feel like. i actually accomplished something.    Also, my MIL's friend who is a nurse gave me reusable chucks!  I posted about chucks a while ago, but these for whatever reason, make me really really happy."
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,razzertto,2,Sun Jun 14 13:25:28 2015 UTC,What are chucks? The only ones I know are the shoes.
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,WhateverYouSay1084,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:24:16 2015 UTC,They're kinda like puppy pads but for humans...reusable ones are made of cloth and can be washed. We had them at the nursing home where I used to work. Super useful!

I think baby clothes on baby hangers is the cutest thing I've seen thus far! it was a bit of a pain to get it all on there, so I'm not sure how long I'll keep up with it, but I'm enjoying how oragnized it feels at the moment.   Grandma is not doing well, but also not quite on deaths door. Her heart is only working at 25% and her kidneys are not doing well either. They are doing some kind of test to determine what they can do to help tomorrow. It's a dismal thought, but I'm just hoping she will make it long enough to meet her first Great Grandson.... :S"

Even on diclegis and promethazine, yesterday I threw up twice and this morning once. I'm currently laying on the couch, doing everything I can to keep my breakfast down. I know I need more water but it tastes icky.  Oy, I'm ready for the second trimester!!"
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,missintent,2,Sun Jun 14 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"Seltzer with a slice of lemon or lime really helped me with fluid intake in the extreme nausea phase - also flavored seltzer (especially by Polar seltzer). I have found ice water, consumed with a straw, really helps me get more fluid in me. I definitely feel much better when I am well hydrated. I also made homemade ginger syrup to have with plain seltzer - it also helped, but I really love strong fresh ginger flavor.  I hope you're feeling better soon!"
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,TigFan15,2,Sun Jun 14 14:57:15 2015 UTC,Prego pops and ginger gum are awesome in a pinch.
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,missintent,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:12:27 2015 UTC,What are prego pops?  I've gotten to the point where even ginger is repulsive :(  I did make some very icy water and that tastes better. Morning sickness is so weird.
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,talula79,2,Sun Jun 14 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"I feel you on the ginger. I tried so many ginger products for nausea in early pregnancy that even now I get a little queasy at the thought of ginger.   If icy water helps, you could try crushed ice too? I always found it easier to eat that than to drink water. Or even a slushy drink?"

A friend called yesterday afternoon and I was able to get some work done while talking to her which made the time fly by. Then another friend came over for dinner and stayed and chatted for a few hours. _^ Today I tried to open the file I was having issues with yesterday and it popped right up. :D  Going to try to get some work done and then see about getting a sewing project prepped so I can work on it in down time. I find hand stitching relaxing and while hand sewing their quilts may be a little much, I think I can manage a stuffy for each of them. :)"

InfertilityBabies,39sq68,GrammaMo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:17:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, last night was the scariest night since LL was born. She was coughing in her sleep occasionally and at one point the coughing got pretty pronounced and turned it to gasping/gagging. We picked her up and she kept having these episodes of gagging. I think she has her first cold or some kind of congestion. I called my pediatrician's line last night and NO ONE FUCKING CALLED ME BACK. I was finally able to suck out a bunch of the snot and get her settled back down but she's clearly still sick or... I don't know? Something is up with her for sure. I don't know what to fucking do. It's terrifying to listen to your baby gasp and gag."

He said as long as she doesn't have a fever, is eating, and isn't turning blue then he just wants to see her in the office tomorrow. If any of the other stuff happens I have to take her to the children's hospital.   Ugh, sick babies are the saddest things ever! Ever!"

Anyways, it's what our doc advised when the baby had a cold, he was coughing and gagging all night long because the snot kept running down his throat. You clear out the nose first with the water, and thèn you use the nose sucker. You get WAY more snot out of the nose that way :P"
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,talula79,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"We are using saline solution, probably the same thing. So the spray and then snot sucker.  Thank you though!"

We decided not to get an infant bucket car seat, so anytime I take M anywhere I need to have her in a carrier, so a quicker and prettier one is going to be great!  Today my sister and her girlfriend are visiting. My sister has only seen M a few times and her girlfriend has been out of the country until recently so it'll be her first time meeting her.

Matilda sucks between feeds too. We are supplementing half or a little more in formula. I am eating and drinking everything they say brings in the milk but it just isn't happening. I had visions of feeding her breastmilk and saving money but that is out the window. It's really frustrating and I feel like why does this have to be a problem with my fertility issues also? Ugh! Ok I got that out there now I can move on.
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,talula79,3,Sun Jun 14 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, that's rough. If you're up for it, remember that breastfeeding isn't an all or nothing game. Keep feeding and pumping - you're only 12 days out! It took me longer than that to get my supply up, but we're there now. Are you doing fenugreek? How much? Are you combining with blessed Thistle?"
InfertilityBabies,39sq68,traveler5678,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:00:39 2015 UTC,Yes and tons of oat foods. So you eventually caught up? There's still hope? I am just feeling hopeless I guess. I am not going to quit but this struggle wasn't in my vision. :-/

InfertilityBabies,39sq68,razzertto,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:55:30 2015 UTC,Her pediatrician has her at 2.5-3. I usually average less than 1.5 but get to 2 if I don't let her suck in between feeds or if I skip a session.
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,KatiexS,13,Sun Jun 14 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"I feel comfortable saying that everyone on this sub felt this way in the beginning.   I had the sore boobs, the nausea, etc. in the first tri, but didn't ""feel"" pregnant. I was bloated from 12-20 weeks, but just felt bloated. I felt a little more connected when we had the anatomy scan.   But honestly the first time I really truly connected and thought ""omg, we might take a baby home"" was when I felt movement at 20 weeks exactly.  So you're not weird. It will probably get a little easier at each appointment, when you can see/hear a heartbeat. It really is a gradual process of it becoming more real.  ETA: a slow rising beta is still a rise- today you are pregnant. I hope it sticks! Do you have an ultrasound scheduled?"
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,ky_grown90,5,Sun Jun 14 01:07:54 2015 UTC,"I came in to say I felt /feel the same way but I think you're right -- almost all of us feel that way. It's taken so much to get here that it doesn't feel possible that it worked.   Op, I'm 15w1d and I don't feel excited. I have felt what I think might be first movements and that was the first time I felt a connection to my baby but it was fleeting. It's not that I have changed my mind but that I can't believe it's a possibility."
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,Bibbityboo,7,Sun Jun 14 02:09:08 2015 UTC,I have an ultrasound scheduled for this Monday to check placement. I'm a nervous wreck. I'll definitely post an update about it.

These early stages are the worst!  It's one of the unfair things about infertility.  You think you'll get pregnant and boom, be happy right away.  For me, being pregnant caused my anxiety to get worse, because I was always so worried about something going wrong.  It sounds like the pregnancy is on a great track!!  And the beta is looking good, too!"
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,NBPTS,5,Mon Jun 15 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're struggling with this right now. I can totally relate to how you're feeling, so please know you're not alone. I've waited 3years to get a positive test. I found out Thursday I'm also 5 weeks pregnant. I so want to be happy but I'm terrified.  The advice I would give is take it day by day. Even hour by hour if you have to. Keep reaching out to other expecting mom's. Maybe you can find someone to be excited for you. I'm excited for you!!!!"
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,Peachmaru,4,Sun Jun 14 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"Nothing is going on. You are absolutely feeling the exact way so many of us feel. For me, it didn't feel real until I had morning sickness. Even then, it seemed like it was wishful thinking, like something bad would happen. I swear I had a sense of impending doom until they were like 4 months old. Even after my twins were born it felt surreal. I was absolutely over the moon with joy but people would use the terms ""mom"" and ""son"" and ""daughter"" and I would wonder who they were talking about. Those terms felt so out of reach for me for so long that they actually took some getting used to!   We've been through a lot of hope and disappointment. We've built walls to protect ourselves. Those walls are strong. It took a lot more than a positive HCG for me to feel like a mom. But I was. And so are you.   Take your time. Don't try to make yourself feel a certain amount of joy because you feel like you're supposed to. Screw anyone's and everyone's expectation of feelings. You and your husband are the only ones that have walked your path and your feelings are valid and normal.   Congratulations on your positive!"
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,bandgeek_foreves,4,Sun Jun 14 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"For me I don't think it felt real even when I was giving birth.  Like they were going to see I wasn't meant to have a baby and they were going to take him away.  It's better now that he's a toddler and specifically asks for me.  Enjoy being pregnant today as much as you can, do this each day, but don't feel like you have to be as happy as other people expect you to be.  If you're not pregnant tomorrow, you can figure it out then.  Just be kind to yourself."
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,sonirose,4,Sun Jun 14 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"I spent every moment of the beginning of my pregnancy (and still sometimes now) shielding myself because I was sure it wouldn't work out and I wouldn't end up with a baby. After all the shit we went through to get here, we deserve to be a bit reserved and cautious.   I just tried to take each day as it came, and not hold onto any kind of thoughts about the future.   Then, one day, things started to shift and I felt more and more positive. Now my negative days are so far and few in between, and I really feel like maybe, perhaps, I might be a mother at the end of all this!   Hugs to you.... infertility is such a bitch, and doesn't go away after the positive. We're all here for you!"
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,in_your_ears,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:09:13 2015 UTC,Yep.  I spent a lot of time shielding myself too.  I didn't register or buy a single thing until a friend of mine told me I had too (I was about 30 weeks along at that point).    Also wanted to say that Aug 3rd is my husband's b-day too!
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,talula79,3,Mon Jun 15 17:44:57 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the pregnancy! I have a similar feeling, I'm 12 weeks and only felt really confident immediately after a scan (had one detailed one with the RE at 8 weeks and a brief one at my first OB appt) and then as time passes, I feel nervous and totally not pregnant again! It doesn't help that I have few symptoms at all, no morning sickness and only sore breasts for a few of the early weeks. I guess it just takes time and I'm hoping when I start showing or feeling movement I'll feel better, but until then I guess it's ok to be cautiously optimistic."
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,serendipity37,3,Sun Jun 14 03:12:23 2015 UTC,I have a 12 day old love bug and it still doesn't feel real. Infertility really messes with your ability to embrace the now. I had zero pregnancy symptoms. It was completely unreal. Try your best to tell yourself you have a baby in you unless told otherwise. It's easier said than done. I've been there. Good luck!
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sun Jun 14 07:19:27 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat...12 weeks, really no symptoms other than sore breasts early on (which has mostly gone away at this point).  We had an ultrasound at 6w4d where everything looked fine, but have had nothing to actually confirm what's going on since then. We've started telling people, mostly because of some gatherings this week where it just made sense to share, but I still don't feel like this is real, that I'm actually pregnant. Our next appointment is next Friday where we should hear the heartbeat, and despite having no negative symptoms to indicate anything is wrong, I'm really anxious about it. There's this voice in the back of my head telling me that I've been foolish to be happy, to tell people and talk about it like it's actually going to happen. I'm hoping the feeling goes away as more milestones are hit (for all of us here!), but I wanted to chime in that you're not alone in how you feel."

Rest assured that whether it feels real or not will not change the future. It's a totally normal feeling. If you can, enjoy being pregnant today! <3"
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,MrsDragon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Could it be the Dr in your ear about your HCG that is making you feel meh? It's hard too as we have expectations of how we will feel once pregnant, but those are often knocked down by the reality. I'm 6 weeks tomorrow and it still feels very surreal. I haven't had any bloods so have no numbers to worry about, but I'm just trying to enjoy every day I wake up and am pregnant. My incoming morning sickness is definitely reassuring that I am pregnant! I hope you feel better about it all soon x"
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,effingeffstick,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:11:41 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel any better, I'm currently 21 weeks, have had morning sickness, my belly is growing, I'm feeling kicks...and I still don't feel ""really"" pregnant. I'm not really sure what it will take for the switch to flip. I'm over the moon excited and I have moments that are so cool, but then other times I almost forget. It's really a surreal experience. Somehow it's like I'm not pregnant enough? You are definitely not alone. You get so used to the negatives, I think it's hard to really believe the good news."
InfertilityBabies,39rfp9,reidiate,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:16:56 2015 UTC,"Hi Katie! I'm sorry you're still stuck in IF limbo.  I'm hoping you have great news at your ultrasound.  If it's any consolation on the value of HCG numbers, I had the best HCG values 3x in a row only to find out they stopped growing at my ultrasound.  My son's values had less rise than my m/c's."
InfertilityBabies,39re07,salty-lemons,2,Sun Jun 14 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm sorry about the first IVF cycle!  Can you clarify why your RE thinks that you didn't respond as predicted?  Is it because of the number empty follicles, the number of mature eggs, or the fertilization rate?  At this point, I really think it's premature to say that a change in protocol isn't going to make a difference.  As you say, the fact that at least one egg was found outside the ovary indicates that ovulation had already occurred to at least some extent.  A change in protocol could help with both egg maturity and early ovulation.  As far as the fertilization rate, with only two mature eggs I don't think you can draw a conclusion about egg quality affecting the fertilization rate.  The sample size is just too small.  Keep us posted on the results of the karyotyping blood work and the next cycle!"
InfertilityBabies,39re07,traveler5678,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"He expected better numbers throughout.  He expected more follicles (closer to 15 than 10), he expected a higher mature %, a better fertilization rate, and I think is worried about the empty follicles.  He isn't sure if all of them were ovulated or some of them were simply empty.  My talk with him today was brief but I think he's being proactive with the karyotyping, which I do appreciate.    You are right about saying that a change in protocol won't make a difference is premature.  I'm panicking a bit.  I thought I was prepared because I knew that my first or second transfer might not work, which is why we opted for the two stim/retrievals, but I never expected stimming/retrieval not to work so I'm panicking.  I thought we'd at least have more data at this point but the premature ovulation ruined that.    Thank you so much for taking the time to write me back.  I appreciate the perspective in this sub so much."
InfertilityBabies,39re07,traveler5678,2,Sun Jun 14 02:49:52 2015 UTC,"I can understand why you're panicking and frustrated.  With IVF, I think we all hope to at least get answers if we don't get results, and it sounds like the only information you are getting from this cycle is that this isn't the right protocol for you.  Unfortunately, since everyone's body is different, the first IVF cycle is often a (very expensive) experiment.  If you are interested in going forward with the second IVF cycle (and it's totally fine if you are not), I wouldn't give up hope yet!  There have been several members here and on r/infertility who have seen very different results upon switching protocols or clinics.  The most extreme case that comes to mind is a poster on r/infertility from my early days on the board.  Unfortunately, I can't remember her username and she doesn't post anymore.  With her first cycle, she had a 0% fertilization rate using ICSI.  She switched clinics, and her second cycle produced more embryos than anyone would ever need (~25).  I believe her first FET led to a pregnancy.  Her story always stuck in my mind as an illustration that ART really is an art as well as a science.  A current poster on this sub who also saw very different results upon changing protocols and clinics is u/zoraptera.  You might check out her comment history if you aren't familiar with her story.        Karyotyping does sound like a good idea as well."
InfertilityBabies,39re07,Zoraptera,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:36:43 2015 UTC,It was always the plan to do two stim/retrievals even before my first FET so we are moving forward with the plan.  I think we are planning on sticking with my current clinic.  I will check out zora's history.    Thank you.
InfertilityBabies,39re07,afikomeme,3,Sun Jun 14 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, hey, I just saw /u/traveler5678's mention of me, so let me give you a brief rundown of my issues and how they resolved!  We were diagnosed with severe MFI and severe low AMH by our first clinic.  My husband's semenalysis showed dismal stats across the board.  Volume, count, live count, motility, all were awful.  I think after he saw the numbers, he calculated that he had about 2000 good sperm to work with per ejaculation.  As a result, we were sent straight to IVF w/ ICSI, do not pass go, etc.  We then did some tests on me.  My AMH was nearly unmeasurably low.  0.17 on a scale that only went as low as 0.16.  My FSH was very mildly high (don't recall the numbers now).  When we did a cycle day 3 antral follicle scan, I had only 5 follicles showing.  My first clinic's most aggressive IVF protocol was the microdose Lupron (also known as ""flare"") protocol.  In this protocol, micro-doses of Lupron (10IU a day) were given along with 450IU a day of Gonal-F and 75IU a day of Menopur.  The stims went about 11 days and then we got to retrieval.  7 eggs were retrieved, 5 were mature, 3 fertilized.  By day 5, only 1 embryo was still around, and it was a morula, in the process of arresting.  We transferred it with no results.  They made no changes to my protocol for the second cycle.  I believe stims went for 12 days in that one.  In the second cycle, they retrieved 12 eggs, of which 4 were mature and only 1 fertilized.  That one arrested by day 2 and we had nothing to transfer.  We stopped treatment, but continued taking OPKs.  I think I may have had a chemical pregnancy in January 2014, but we can't know for sure because I never had a beta.  In any event, we restarted treatment with a new clinic in February 2014.  The new clinic re-did our basic tests.  My husband's semenalysis was still roughly the same.  Nothing he had done (selenium and zinc, avoiding hot tubs, changing from briefs to boxers, CoQ-10) made any difference at all.  I had been taking CoQ-10 but had made no other changes.  My AMH somehow measured 1.6 at the new clinic -- we really don't know why or if it was even accurate.  But I did have 8 antral follicles on my day 3 scan, the most we'd ever seen.  The new clinic decided to do an antagonist protocol.  In this one, I was given 450IU per day of Gonal-F and 10IU a day (I think) of hCG -- the purpose of the mini-doses of hCG was to try to keep my follicles growing at the same rate.  This worked, and after about 9 days of stims we used Ganirelix (one shot per day) to prevent early ovulation.  My stims lasted 15 days this cycle.  We retrieved 12 eggs, of which 10 were mature and 8 fertilized.  By day 5 we still had 6 growing blastocysts, so we transferred two.  On day 6 they froze 3.  I got a negative beta after that.  We did not take any time off, just went straight to my first FET.  They thawed one of the three blasts, transferred it, and it was successful.  After 8 months of pregnancy I developed pre-eclampsia, but still delivered a healthy baby boy at 35w3d.  He did not need extra time in the NICU and went home with us pretty much as soon as I was recovered from my c-section (they kept us all one extra day for observation but he did not need special treatment of any kind).  He's now nearly 5 months old and doing fine.  I firmly believe that the things that made a difference were 1.) a different clinic with a better embryology department, 2.) a new protocol, and 3.) the FET instead of the fresh cycle -- I believe my uterine lining was insufficient/not ideal for implantation in that first cycle, due to the length of time I was on stims (I think it was 14-15 days).  Had I known then what I know now, I think we would have chosen to skip the fresh transfer and only do FETs with the new clinic.  Fingers crossed for you that a new protocol will be as helpful for you as it was for us!  My husband and I were very much done with our first clinic after our second failure, and were not interested in doing a cycle with that same protocol no matter where we went.  But hearing from our new RE that she had an idea of where things might have gone wrong and that she wanted to try a different approach gave us enough hope that we were willing to try.  And, of course, now that I'm on the other side, I'm glad we did!  Good luck to you!"
InfertilityBabies,39re07,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jun 15 04:10:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with another poster -- it's probably too early to worry that a change to protocol won't work. I'm sorry this round didn't go as planned. It's awful to put so much time, energy, and money into a round of IVF and have it be largely a bust. :(  I don't know if this helps, but I had three rounds of IVF with wildly different results. #1 -- only three follicles, all three mature, transferred 1, froze 1 (result: early miscarriage). #2 -- 14 eggs retrieved, only ten mature, only 5 fertilized, only 3 were where they needed to be at transfer, 2 transferred, no frozen (result: trisomy 22, miscarriage at 8 weeks). #3 -- two follicles took the lead, nothing else was growing, crazy max hormone doses finally budged the smaller follicles though sacrificing the larger ones, 7 eggs retrieved. 5 fertilized with ICSI, only 3 were really good at transfer, 3 transferred, 1 frozen (currently 22 weeks pregnant with twins).  The switch from #1 to #2 was a switch from antagonist to agonist. #3 was almost identical to #2 with low dose generic HCG added in. #3 was the most successful (knock on wood), but it was the closest I've gotten to cancelation too. I have no idea why two follicles took the lead, suppressing the others. The best I can gather is that I can have a wide variance from cycle to cycle that's not necessarily related to my hormone regimen. I really have no clue though.  What was the time gap between trigger shot and egg retrieval? Were they running behind? I haven't had experience with early ovulation. I hope they can find some easy answers for you though. So sorry you have to deal with this."
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,razzertto,4,Sat Jun 13 15:02:11 2015 UTC,Extra sleep is so nice.  Tomorrow we are going to a private 3D ultrasound clinic to find out the gender! I will be 14 weeks exactly which is the cutoff for their moneyback guarantee. And they accept HSAs for payment which is great. Can't wait to start buying stuff.

They didn't hurt, at all, just made it hard to breathe from pressure.  So I ignored them.  Left the house around 10:30, and haven't really noticed any since.

It did not- maybe a day or two? FWIW I still have frequent uncomfortable contractions (mostly pressure and tightness like yours). But I'm not dilating, so my Dr has shrugged them off.  Point of the story: I feel you, and it is kinda nerve wracking when you're wondering if this is the start of the real thing every time.

Our sellers were amazingly nice people, but they made some really dumbass decisions. Particularly about letting trees grow wherever, and weird electrical stuff. Example: two days ago the light fixture over the bathroom mirror/medicine cabinet fell, and it wasn't until we were taking it all the way down that we realized just how they had gotten the cord and plug into the cabinet to use the outlet there; they had drilled a hole on top of the cabinet, cut and stripped the electrical cord (basically cut off the plug), threaded it through the hole, twisted the wires back together, and then wrapped it in electrical tape. I never noticed before because I don't know, I guess I never considered that someone might be that freaking dumb. Thank goodness the thing fell down before it started a fire.   I'm also pretty sure the drains under the patio don't actually have an outlet anywhere and that's why they back up and the patio is all buckled and weird looking.

Since she found out my IVF was a success she started acting weird. It seems like she's jealous- which I totally understand. I've been there.  So I haven't talked about my pregnancy unless asked and have just tried to ignore her antics and be sensitive.  But it seems like she's trying to get digs in wherever she can.  Last night we were at dinner with some friends and she told me in front of everyone that I was going to get ""disgusting"" when I start to show.  She actually used the word disgusting.  Then she proceeded to go on and on about how she wished she was pregnant so she could ""eat whatever she wants"". Meanwhile I'm eating a salad?? Wtf.  Afterwards one of my friends came up and said how the other girl is just jealous but her constant digs made HER upset on my behalf.  So it's bad enough other ppl are noticing.   I wanted to throat punch her for real when she made the ""disgusting"" comment. Does anyone else have experience with this?   I don't care how jealous of someone I got, I would never have told someone how disgusting they were going to get.  Argh.  It totally hurt my feelings."

InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,MrsDragon,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"I think I was just shocked at the time so I didn't call her on it.  I Think I'm going to try to politely call her out in the future. Ie: saying ""what do you mean by that"" or ""did you really just say that"".   Ugh."
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,effingeffstick,2,Sun Jun 14 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"I had a mini panic attack this morning thinking about all the things left to do! Lucky Mr. Geek was able to calm me and we knocked a couple things off my list. He's really good with that, and suggested we go out and buy a few more things this afternoon - ah - a man who understands retail therapy :P  I'm feeling better about yesterdays L&D visit - baby geek has been SOOO active today, which I always love.   My grandmother is in the hospital with heart issues at the moment - it would appear that she had a heart attack sometime in the last month but didn't realise it. I am not so patiently waiting to hear if there are any test results or any news. They were waiting on results yesterday but I haven't heard anything, and that makes me really nervous. I think my Mom doesn't want to burden me with anything that might stress me out.... but not knowing is stress enough. Hopefully everything was minor and they are able to send her home soon with a good prognosis. :S"
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,MrsDragon,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:51:02 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry about your grandmother. I hope she's ok.
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,effingeffstick,2,Sat Jun 13 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"Hooray for sleeping! Boo for stressed out spouses. Hopefully it's not for too much longer.   Day 4 of bed rest: I'm attempting to get work done, but the files are not transferring over the network...I'm starting to feel very annoying having to ask the hubby for every little thing. And I'm worried that he's going to take on too much and not want to ask for help. I have probably a dozen people who have offered to do stuff, but I don't want to coordinate help for things he doesn't want help with. I'm thinking we need to make a list of everything that needs to get done and then he needs to let me know what he really wants to do himself and what other people can do.   And I'm annoyed because we usually divide and conquer precisely because different things are important to each of us. But that doesn't work so well when I can't do anything. Today is the second half of the parenting class we signed up for but clearly I can't go and he didn't go because he wanted to tackle yardwork. He didn't even want to go and just explain to the instructor what was going on. UGH. Even if we could reschedule, there really isn't a point since I'm likely to be on bed rest from here on out. I wish he would have just gone and finished out the class.   /rant  Anyway, in happier news The Beans kicks are getting stronger. I got some good double kicks yesterday where I could very clearly tell it was two babies! : ) And I've started my way back through the Harry Potter books which I've been meaning to re-read."
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,rbrvwv,4,Sat Jun 13 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"Does anyone think a Lessons Learned sticky post would be a good idea?  I was thinking about this the other day and how I wish present me could talk to pre-baby me about all the stuff that made life easier, the cheaper products that ended up doing a better job than the expensive products, and the overall stuff I ended up never needing but was marketed to me as a must-have.  Thoughts?  :)"
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,effingeffstick,3,Sat Jun 13 20:53:04 2015 UTC,I would be interested in reading this. : )
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,PrincessCBHammock,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:46:44 2015 UTC,Cool! Thanks! /u/rbrvwv do you think this would be a good idea for a sticky?
InfertilityBabies,39pmkw,ky_grown90,2,Sun Jun 14 22:36:08 2015 UTC,"It would, but unfortunately we can only have one sticky, so it would mean losing the due date roll call."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,healthylurker,3,Sat Jun 13 12:22:14 2015 UTC,"I started doing ones just for me to see (kept them ""private"") around 12 weeks or so. It made me feel connected to the pregnancy. It was like my ""happy time"" to add stuff to it. Once we had the anatomy scan and my in laws said they wanted to throw us a shower, I made them public and adjusted whatever may have changed.  I used a BRU registry for the shower bc it seemed easiest for everyone, but I made Target and Amazon ones for me bc I knew whatever we didn't get I would want to buy at the best price (also completion discounts).  So that's my advice!"
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,ky_grown90,5,Sat Jun 13 13:09:21 2015 UTC,"We started about 20 weeks in and did a Babyli.st - we only shared it with two people, one who had a miscarriage and another who had pregnancy issues the first time around, so we knew they wouldn't spread the info. We used it as a placeholder for ideas and such, and finalized it at about 30 weeks in.   If you haven't looked at Babyli.st yet I highly recommend it!  ETA - seconding Lucie's List. We borrowed a Chicco Keyfit 30; I love the car seat and despise the stroller. We were gifted a nice Chicco pack and play; it's really convenient, but if we had bought ourselves we would have gone with a less expensive Graco. We bought an IKEA crib ourselves. We registered for and received a Dropcam - best baby monitor ever (though we also use a cheapie audio only!) If you'd like to take a look at our Babyli.st for more ideas send a PM.   We will swap to a convertible car seat when BB is 5-6 months old (keyfit owner is having a second baby!) and are very likely getting a britax for most travel and two Graco seats as backups (grandparents, aunts, etc)  Also if you're interested in trying out cloth you should look into Diaper Lab; it's just outside Boston and they have a newborn cloth diaper rental program. It's not listed on their site."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,larabair,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:11:06 2015 UTC,We borrowed a Chicco Keyfit 30; I love the car seat and despise the stroller.   Which stroller?
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,digitabulist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"The one that comes with the travel set.  http://www.chiccoshop.com/gear/travel-systems/full-size/cortina-travel-system---graphica/07060796460070.html Hate hate hate   Eta it is probably a nice stroller, but I am short and small and weak, and it is big and heavy. Once he is bigger I'll look for a lighter folding stroller but for now I prefer my woven wrap."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,larabair,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"We like the Chicco frame stroller (not the travel system).  It's basically just a frame that the car seat clicks into.  It's incredibly lightweight and durable.  When he was old enough to not need the car seat for the stroller, I just switched to an umbrella stroller (also by Chicco)."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,sonirose,3,Mon Jun 15 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"I committed two major mistakes in regards to our registry.  The first was ""Hey, we've just started trying, I'm gonna be all cute and put together one now, assuming this will go super easy.""  Yeah, no. So, I've actually had one for about 3 years haha.  Second mistake: IVF #1 worked.  So at 6 weeks, we went back to BRU and re-did it.  Then lost the pregnancy.  Sigh.  This time, I didn't even touch the registry until around 12, maybe 14 weeks.  But we had our shower early'ish (28 weeks).  Unfortunately, I can't really give great advice on big gadgets, because we need accommodations, like a double stroller, that doesn't work for everyone.  That said, I went with Graco stoller and carseat (clickconnect 35) because they're very versatile and have good reports.  The carseat we got also goes down to 5lb, which was important to me, just in case they're little."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,dutchqueen,2,Sat Jun 13 12:32:22 2015 UTC,"Ugh that's terrible.  Getting spammed with BRU emails is bad enough but going through a m/c AND getting daily baby emails must have been awful.  Congrats on your twins, though!"
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,effingeffstick,3,Sat Jun 13 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"I started mine around 12 weeks as a way of making everything real for me, but I think you should do what feels right for you. If you think you want to start one, but don't want people to find it most places have a way of keeping it private (that's what I was afraid of most for some reason)  I like babyli.st because you can combine stuff from different places.  As for what to register for I found Lucie's list really really helpful."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,girl_of_bat,2,Sat Jun 13 12:40:15 2015 UTC,Yes Lucie's List was great!
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,pamplemousse2,3,Sat Jun 13 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"I decided not to have one for several reasons.  For one thing, a lot of Jews don't have one before baby's birth.  If we wanted to take it a step further, we would not have bought a thing before baby is born, but I personally think thats a bit too extreme.  I also think personally, that its strange to have a party for a nonexistent being, but thats just me, and thats also based on my history of infertility/miscarriage.  We do not have a registry, but will have one after baby's birth.  In the meantime, I started a private wishlist on amazon and bbb to add stuff until I'm ready to make them both live registries.  We ended up buying a lot of the necessary stuff ourselves, it felt right for us.  We started buying baby stuff around week 30, bought the bigger stuff around week 34ish.  We just bought a dresser last week at week 39.  We did a lot of research through babygearlabs is I think the website, lucies list helped some, and the baby bargains book is excellent.  Anyway, there's no rule about when you shoukd or if you should, just do what feels right to you.  I don't have any regrets about how I/we decided to go about this process.  Except for buying that first dresser from Babies r Us.  Never again."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,SJP8,3,Sat Jun 13 13:40:06 2015 UTC,I honestly wish I could've done it this way; you really don't know for sure what you're going to need and what won't work for you until the baby gets here. And I hated having a shower oh God I hated it so much. Definitely makes more sense to celebrate them when they're here.
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sat Jun 13 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"and here I am on the opposite end of it. I'd MUCH rather have the shower before (but I enjoy my family, despite how large it is and how small my DH's family is). This way I don't have to worry about 30-40 old women without the TDAP passing my child around before she is vaccinated!"
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,ReigningPotatoes,2,Sat Jun 13 17:08:17 2015 UTC,Ha who said anything about letting anyone touch them?!
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,PrincessCBHammock,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same page as you! At 31 weeks we still haven't bought anything (but we are thinking about it!). And we plan to do a registry after the baby is born. After all my struggles, it just feels more natural for us to wait."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,turtle1111,3,Sat Jun 13 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"I put one together at around 6ish weeks to make it feel more real, but now at 13+6 I haven't looked at it since. It was so overwhelming I just stopped messing with it because I don't know what we will really need and what's just excessive. It wouldn't hurt to start it now and add to it as you think of more things!  Also, the carseat/stroller thing was too much to think about. I know they all have to conform to a strict set of standards so I trusted in that and picked a set based on quality of materials, design, and ease of transport. I made sure to look at reviews before deciding and am super happy with what I picked out."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Sat Jun 13 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"Mine was way late because like you said IF PTSD.  I didn't want to jinx it.  It was around week 20-ish that folks started asking me why I hadn't setup my registry yet and one lady noted I should be doing it around the time of the gender scan. Oh, we went with the Chicco KeyFit30 set and love it. And if you are looking at pumps you may want to look at the Spectra S2.  I had a lot better results from it than the Medela one.  It is supposedly hospital grade and way cheaper. Congrats!  :)"
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,effingeffstick,2,Sat Jun 13 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"Also, if you have health insurance, Google your insurance provider + breastpumps.  For me, it took me right to a 3rd party site that did all the work for me.  My doc had to write me a prescription and then I got my pump for free.

InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,sonirose,2,Mon Jun 15 20:45:57 2015 UTC,I still really haven't started mine and I'll be 23 weeks on Monday. We're making 24 weeks our official let's get this party started time.
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,futurecompanion11,2,Sat Jun 13 12:50:28 2015 UTC,"I did a private baby registry list on Amazon starting around 16 weeks.  I didn't have a baby shower until 28 weeks.  I made the registry public at 24 weeks when the baby shower invites were sent out by my friends.  I liked the book Baby Bargains for a guide on what to purchase.    I also tried to leverage Craigslist and eBay to minimize the amount of stuff that we would accumulate for the baby.  Many of the items that you think you need might not work for your baby/babies.    For example, I bought two Velcro swaddlers and my infant hates it.  My first son didn't like the fisher price swing that everyone loves -  it was a good thing that we got it off of Craigslist and resold it for the purchase price."
InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,curiouslywanting,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yes yes yes to Lucie's List! I started off by reading a bunch of threads here and at BabyBumps about what to register for/essential gear/stuff people didn't need, and Lucie's List. And then I made my registries - one on Amazon for the universal registry, and one at Sears because some people like bricks and mortal stores. Probably early 2nd tr? We had our shower pretty early too, which changes the timeline.  Your baby, like mine, is a winter baby. So I highly recommend getting a bucket car seat (we debated going convertible, but at our prenatal class the instructor pointed out you don't want to be messing around strapping your teeny in in the cold). We got the carseat we liked (Britax B-Safe because of the higher height rating), and didn't get a stroller until March - it would have been later if I hadn't broken my ankle. I figured I wouldn't want to be out and about with my teeny baby in a stroller in the winter anyways - we used the carrier for walks and stuff. We decided we'd get the stroller we liked and the carseat we liked, and let the chips fall where they may. We ended up with a Britax seat and a Britax stroller (the B-Ready, because the option to be parent-facing was super important to me and we liked it) so they're compatible and it was super convenient when I was in the cast, but we haven't used the carseat on the stroller much other than that.  So my other big tip would be to get a nice baby carrier! We love our Manduca.  Edit: Large muslin swaddling blankets. It used to be Aidan and Anais was the only brand, and those are the ones we have - but now there are others out there too. You want big (I think ours are 47"" square). They're awesome and super verstile."

InfertilityBabies,39p7u0,megalynn44,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:50:40 2015 UTC,"When we found out we were having twins, my husband's first thought was ""We need two names!"". My first thought was ""we need 4 carseats!"" So...clearly the baby gear stuff was a worry for me. We found out the sexes at 12 weeks and we're planning on a shower at 26 weeks, both because that's when my mom and friend (who are across the country) could make it, and because we worried that things might move a little faster with twins.   Between those things, and my own anxiety about making sure that we were ready for the babies early, I started researching things by 14 weeks and we made our registries between 16 and 20 weeks. We did a trip to Toys R Us to get the lay of the land, started registries online and then did another trip back to use the gun and add everything off my check list.  Toy R Us/Babies R Us had the best deal by far. 1 year returns, 10% cash back on registry purchases, 10% registry completion discount, and a 10% multiples discount. So if they had it, we registered for it there. Anything they didn't have, we've done through an Amazon registry.  We registered for the Chico Key Fit 30s. They are much beloved in /r/parentsofmultiples because they are smaller in width (so you can fit more carseats in a given space) and they go down to 4lbs (important when the babies may come early). We're not doing a travel system simply because there aren't any for twins, and instead have a snap and go. We'll add a larger stroller as well--we're looking at the Baby Jogger City Select, but can't find anywhere to try it out."

InfertilityBabies,39kg46,SJP8,2,Sat Jun 13 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"That's nuts.  Congrats though!!!  Although seeing that our lives appear to be in parallel, this news does slightly concern/excite me."

Apparently, it's a swanky place with a spa and fancy places to eat so I'm hopeful! It's the first time seeing or talking to my MIL since the big shower invite blow up, so wish me luck!! Hope everyone has a great weekend!"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,ky_grown90,2,Fri Jun 12 11:58:28 2015 UTC,That sounds fantastic. I hope it is great!
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,SJP8,2,Fri Jun 12 14:15:07 2015 UTC,Oooh glamping sounds much better than sleeping on the ground. Husband is always trying to get me to go camping but that's just not how I roll. Ten years and he's still trying to nudge me into it! Hope you have a good time.

Went to the OB today, he wants me to go to the hospital for an NST on Tuesday, then to see him right afterwards, and unless things get moving naturally, I'm set for an induction on Thursday.  We did an ultrasound today and he checked my cervix, which is getting softer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Baby is looking good, moving around, fluids are good, so at least baby is healthy and safe.  I just want her out so I can finally meet her!"

InfertilityBabies,39kg46,yearofthecat,2,Fri Jun 12 14:49:40 2015 UTC,I have the exact opposite problem with OITNB! I just couldn't get my husband into the show and he's at home so he's gonna be  annoyed about watching it. Especially since he has only seen half of the first episode (seriously!! I think he decided not to like it before he even watched any of it and then only made it through that much of it) so he'll have no idea what's going on this season.
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,SJP8,2,Fri Jun 12 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"I had the first two seasons on all week in the background, so even if he didn't rewatch he can kind of recall what happened.  I am watching without him though. He's not near invested as I am."
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,razzertto,2,Fri Jun 12 15:35:54 2015 UTC,That's unfortunate because the first half of the first episode is the most boring part of the whole show.
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,larabair,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:28:09 2015 UTC,"That's what I tried to tell him, but I wasn't convincing enough apparently. I don't think he trusts my tv judgement ever since I tried to get him to watch true blood haha!"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,curiouslywanting,4,Fri Jun 12 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Seeing my grandma with mini - gnu is awesome. My grandma is soooooo happy, and mini is really responding to her. Yesterday, she held mini on her lap for what she called ""girl talk,"" and the baby was giving her constant smiles while she talked. I have never seen so many smiles from this kid! It was so sweet.   On another note - - we were told early on to wake mini at least every 4 hours at night to breastfeed, especially since she needed to pack on some weight. I'm wondering if it's now ok, at 5 weeks, to feed on demand overnight rather than scheduling. I think she'll sleep longer at a stretch, which would be amazing. Can others whose babies were little at birth weigh in on when you moved to nighttime feeding on demand?"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,dutchqueen,3,Fri Jun 12 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"I survived the in laws. They were pretty blasé about the kids which was annoying, but it's my FIL's 7th and 8th grandkid so I guess I understand.  My mother in law still will be coming (husbands parents are divorced so I have two sets). It will be interesting to see how she acts.  In other glamorous news, I'm having a hemorrhoidectomy next week. I'm glad to get it taken care of but worried about being put under and away from babies all day and then what recovery will be like. My husband can't take any time off so my mom is helping that day with babies and a friend is dropping me off and picking me up from hospital.   I'm sure it will all be fine, it just sucks."
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,larabair,2,Fri Jun 12 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh Cat.  I'll be interested to hear how the surgery goes.  I'll be needing it myself seeing as how I've had these 'roids for about a year now (the entire length of the pregnancy, ugh).  Just won't go away.  Hope your ass gets feels better soon."
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,Bibbityboo,2,Fri Jun 12 17:51:13 2015 UTC,Hope the surgery goes well and you get some relief!  Sounds like the babies will be well cared for while you're having the procedure and during the recovery.
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,ivf_lizz,6,Fri Jun 12 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"Why is it that your baby will always wake up WAAAAAY earlier than normal when:  1.) You've slept like absolute shit, barely clocking in five hours.   2.) Your partner had to leave super early for work and can't help you.   3.) You're on solo baby duty for the next few days.   4.) You wake up with a headache."

InfertilityBabies,39kg46,cakegroove,3,Fri Jun 12 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"NST today.  Working half days was definitely the right choice.  I do feel some guilt, but slowly but surely Im getting things done.  And napping more, which I dont normally enjoy, but Im no longer sleeping well at night, so its worth it.  Ive gotten to the stage where people do double takes when they see me...its kind of amusing.  Goal for today: write these gosh darn shower thank you cards!  It was 6 eeks ago, I suck :(  Edit: Nurse was asking a bunch of leading questions about how I was feeling, and then pointed out I was having some contractions about 5 minutes apart.  Just felt like BH and I barely, if at all, noticed any of them.  One big one that I felt, but again, a zero on pain and maybe a 2 in discomfort.  But, the oncall doctor wanted me to have a shot to make them stop, and now I have to do biweekly NSTs.  Aside from the shot making me shakey, I still feel fine.  Babies look great though.  Very active."
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,gizmo_love,3,Fri Jun 12 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"He's 10 weeks old and I just started writing thank-you's. Don't feel so bad, people get it!"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 12 13:34:54 2015 UTC,"No guilt! People get it!  Heck, I'd be tempted to start now and work through it, but wait because then you can include PICTURES. Which everyone loves. Pictures makes anything forgivable."
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,GrammaMo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"I had my shower on Saturday,  and ON THE DRIVE HOME my mum started getting on my case about the thank you cards. Seriously.    I told her I wanted to send them after the baby was born because,  as you said: pictures!  She was very adamant that I send them off within a week.   My plan is to write them all,  address them all,  and stamp them all.  Then wait til we have the goddamn pictures before sending them out. My mum's going to have a fit in the mean time.    Oh well."

InfertilityBabies,39kg46,pamplemousse2,3,Fri Jun 12 11:55:13 2015 UTC,At 16 weeks (and a few days) I finally stopped taking my Unisom every night. Now I feel like I might be sick. Ugh.
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,Bibbityboo,2,Fri Jun 12 14:43:34 2015 UTC,this week I started sleeping like crapola. (9 wks w/twins). unisom helps eh?
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,lancealittle,2,Fri Jun 12 17:59:00 2015 UTC,"It does help, although you may start feeling pretty tired soon. I had the same issue between weeks 5-9/10ish(I think) but suddenly I could hardly get out of bed. BUT in the meantime, Unisom 25 mg is very helpful. Especially if you've been feeling queasy. I take this before bed along with my prenatal and it help the nausea along and made me sleep like a rock. (sometime I'd only have to pee once in the middle of the night since the Unisom put me into such a deep sleep)"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,Bibbityboo,3,Fri Jun 12 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"Uuuuuugggghhhh sooo tired. Child usually wakes up several times in the night, eats, goes right back to sleep. Last night he was up for like... an hour and a half, from 3.45 to 5.15. FUCK. I thought we were at least past this nonsense.  At least it's almost the weekend. Plumber is coming to replace our janky tub (did I mention there's a tub in a box in my living room? Yeah.), we're going to a babywearing meetup on Saturday (/u/GrammaMo are you going?), and my midwives are having their annual picnic on Sunday! The midwife who attended kiddo's birth actually hasn't seen him since he's been well (the last time was at his 4 week appointment when she sent us to the hospital for the cold he had), so I'm hoping she'll be there."

InfertilityBabies,39kg46,Hopecat,3,Fri Jun 12 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, for those of you who had your thyroid monitored, did you notice a big drop once pregnant? They've got me monitored monthly right now. In the public system, they don't tell me hte results (so annoying), but I noticed my last set was cc'd to the fertility clinic so I could see it in my profile. The result was TSH .75 mU/L. Which seems lower (my last one before that was 1.5 and 2 prior). Is this something I should ask about or let go?  In othernews I think I need to begin the struggle for maternity clothes. Its starting to get really warm out and my summer clothes all feel snug. So may as well accept I'll need maternity wear! Pants are also getting tight!"

InfertilityBabies,39kg46,MrsDragon,3,Fri Jun 12 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"I fully intend to! I have huge body insecurities, and never feel very attractive or feminine or like I have a style. But I've decided that pregnancy is goign to be a time to deal with it and move on. I'm going to only buy maternity wear that makes me feel good. I'm going to say fuck it, if its fitted rather than my normal baggy, and I'm going to look at my body for its ability to do amazing things, and sustain me. I don't want to pass on my body issues, and frankly its too time consuming to keep them! We'll see how I do though, I'm plus-sized and that really limits selection!"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,cakegroove,2,Fri Jun 12 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've found pregnancy to both calm and inflame my body issues at the same time. I love being able to be all belly-out-there and feel confident in what my body can do. I also for almost the first time ever can actually find women's clothes that fit me ok -- there's something about my waist to hips to leg ratios that seem to be off in non-pregnant clothes. But that's not usually a problem because when I'm not pregnant I wear about 98% men's clothes anyway. Suddenly throwing my gender expression (and a little gender identity) into this flux of shit going wacko through pregnancy, and I get all new body and identity issues."
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,MrsDragon,2,Fri Jun 12 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"I gained 20 lbs through the infertility process and have never hated my body more.

InfertilityBabies,39kg46,GrammaMo,3,Sat Jun 13 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"Well, had my first trip to L & D today! I went for a biophysical profile ultrasound, and they sent me right to the hospital because ""baby wasn't moving the way they would have hoped at this stage"". Scared the SHIT out of me! So we get over there, get in, and the nurse looks at my chart/ultrasound report. She giggles and says, you failed the ultrasound by 2 points... because baby wasn't practice breathing enough. She told me right away we would be totally fine, and hooked me up to the NST monitor. It was all so uneventful, and baby looks great. Cervix length, fluid, blood flow... we are all good :)   Hey, I got the day off work, so that's fun! This has definitely kicked me into gear to get my hospital bag packed!!! :P"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,montanadoodle,2,Fri Jun 12 16:34:45 2015 UTC,My son failed a few NST but passed every biophysical 8/8 and we had two per week for the last five weeks of my pregnancy. He ended up in the NICU with breathing issues.   I absolutely don't want to scare you but I encourage you to do kick counts and/or any other precautions and monitoring they're willing to do. Are you with a MFM doctor?
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,traveler5678,2,Fri Jun 12 20:33:34 2015 UTC,"Not fully. I'm mostly working with my ob, the mfm won't be seeing me again until little guy is born. (Kidney related issue)   I definitely feel him moving around a lot... The nurse said he was probably just sleeping and that is why we didn't see the practice breaths on the bio physical profile. Passed the nst no problem :) we go for another ultrasound in two weeks... I'm not super concerned yet because I'm only 32 weeks. I will definitely push for extra care if I feel nervous though. :)"
InfertilityBabies,39kg46,becabecaful,3,Fri Jun 12 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"Day 3 of bed rest: My boss came by last night with a laptop so I could work from home. My husband is currently getting me set up in the recliner so I can have a work station and the bed can be a ""at home"" station.  My antibiotics have to be taken 4 times a day with restrictions on when you can/can't eat, which is interesting to navigate with my every 2-3 hours snacking.  Woke up this morning to what the nurse thinks is round ligament pain. Ouch! But both boys are kicking more and this morning my husband was able to feel them for the first time! :) Plus the bed rest is solving my foot swelling issue, which is nice.  Now to see how much I can actually get done.  ETA: The answer to how much I can get is apparently nothing beyond email. UGH. My files are not cooperating and everything is downloading super slow. Plus this reclined position makes a nap seem really attractive while staring at that stupid loading dial....Ugh.

And partial proceeds go to ASD charities. :)  and now I have reason to buy that cute applecheeks mug. oh god my husband will kill me.

InfertilityBabies,39fx27,tittypuncher,2,Thu Jun 11 16:06:43 2015 UTC,I'm too excited for this! But some people are mad because it's going to drive down market value for the older htfs.
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,messofletters,2,Thu Jun 11 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"Well it IS really close in colour, and I don't think that's very cool of applecheeks to do, why not a new print instead?  So you're an applecheeks fan then? I ahve a few, all of our nap diapers are applecheeks."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,tittypuncher,4,Thu Jun 11 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"Our 4-year-old had a well check today. Guys, she's 95th percentile for height and 90th for weight. I know she's been a big kid her whole life, but damn! She also go two vaccines today (she asked beforehand if they would poke her ""with a pin, like they always do"") and she just stoically watched. Once she got the Strawberry Shortcake bandaids it sealed the deal: she rushed into the waiting room and announced loudly to everyone present, ""that was FUN! THAT WAS SO FUN!""  In baby news, we had 3 separate appointments a Far Away University Hospital yesterday in 2 different buildings. We were away from home from 7:30am until 5:30pm. Nothing's hugely different, but we're getting a better idea of what is likely to happen after birth -- we'll probably only see the kid for a few minutes before she goes to the NICU for observation, but my partner will likely be able to stay with me or the kid as long as either of us is in the hospital. Through the 6 different providers we saw yesterday (no joke -- SIX), we got 6 different versions of ""it's probably going to be fine, but it might not be. We know a lot about this problem but we have no idea what will happen once your child starts breathing. Don't stress, but BE PREPARED FOR SUDDEN DEATH AND NEWBORN SURGERY."" The thing is, I totally get it. While there is no way to know our individual outcome, the condition is well-understood. Statistics don't dictate isolated events."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,lancealittle,3,Thu Jun 11 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"I've been MIA for a bit while dealing with things, but if you ever need to talk, just message me.  Our Baby B just had open heart surgery at 11 weeks and spent 6 in the NICU and I get how rough it is."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,yearofthecat,2,Thu Jun 11 15:28:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It's really odd for us, because at the same moment everyone is saying ""these defects are usually not a big deal and can get taken care of later on,"" they're also reminding us that it could be really severe. Who knows?? We're hopeful for a short NICU observation at birth, then prepared for a likely lung surgery later on that would probably involve a week or so in the hospital. I hope baby B is doing well! Home yet?"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,lancealittle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"Got home yesterday!  Surgery was on Thursday so it's pretty amazing how fast they start to heal up.  It was like that for us - once they made the diagnosis (""just"" a VSD (hole), but one so large it was a big problem) everyone was saying how it's the best kind of heart defect to have, etc etc.  but then, lots of drilling from the nurses about watching for signs of worsening congestive heart failure (which is scary as fuck!  What if I miss something?).  Felt very mixed message."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,yearofthecat,3,Thu Jun 11 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yay for being back home! It's hard to live in that place of ""everything is fine until it's not.""

Really hope you get the best case scenario and if all looks great at delivery I know we often give parents a little more time than just a few min, hope your NICU does too!   Your 4 year old is awesome, btw, love that response!"

InfertilityBabies,39fx27,traveler5678,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:15:42 2015 UTC,Keep your head up.  Sounds like there is a good chance everything will be just fine.  I know the baby will need a surgery but babies are so resilliant.   I know you have some rough time coming your way but staying level headed before you know for sure will save your sanity.  I really hope for the best outcome for you guys!  Fingers crossed!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,vibeee,5,Thu Jun 11 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"So, baby B had his heart surgery on Thursday and it went really well.  He came home yesterday so he spent less than a week in the PICU.  It was incredibly hard to see my tiny baby like that, but it's OVER and surgery isn't hanging over our heads anymore.  A question for everyone : has anyone switched pediatricians because they weren't happy?  I feel like our current one isn't taking my babies' reflux seriously enough."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,yearofthecat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:24:05 2015 UTC,Yes I've switched! They called me afterwards and wanted to know what went wrong but I never returned the call. Much happier with our new pediatrician!!   Glad your baby is doing well after such a scary surgery
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,cakegroove,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:10:49 2015 UTC,Cat!! I'm thrilled to hear your baby B is home again and doing well. I hope you're all doing great?   I totally feel you on the reflux issues. My pediatrician is great but also isn't prescribing anything. My boy is really struggling with it - but she said since he's gaining weight well that it's not concerning and that meds won't necessarily help.   I keep hoping that at 3-4 months it will clear up! I hope it does for you too!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Hopecat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:49:19 2015 UTC,So glad to hear that surgery went well!!!!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,curiouslywanting,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:52:06 2015 UTC,So glad baby B's surgery went well!  I agree that it's worth interviewing other pediatricians if you feel uneasy with your current doctor.
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,traveler5678,4,Fri Jun 12 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"Great results on your NT test! I know passing that milestone helped me feel a little more confident and optimistic about my pregnancy, so I hope that's the case for you as well.   We've got the baby naming this weekend, so today starts the deluge of family from out of town. My parents arrive this morning, and they're bringing with them my 97-year - old grandmother. She doesn't travel anymore... But she is for this. She's beyond excited about her new great - granddaughter."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Iamagnu,4,Thu Jun 11 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome, if a bit overwhelming. I'm not familiar with baby naming ceremonies, can you tell me more?"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:46:49 2015 UTC,"In the Jewish tradition, boys have a bris (ritual circumcision) at 8 days old. It's a little party with food and alcohol and lots of mazel tovs. At that time the baby's name is officially bestowed, too. At some point in recent history, someone noticed that we didn't really do anything to celebrate a baby girl's arrival, so the baby naming tradition was created. The child's parents get called up to the Torah for an honor during Saturday services and a blessing is said for the child. Usually, the parents talk briefly about the girl's name and why they chose it. It's traditional to honor a deceased relative with the name, so the parents might explain who the baby is named for. In our case, her middle name is to honor my husband's late grandfather, so he'll probably say a couple of words about why we wanted to honor him. Then after services, there's a lunch, because Jewish celebrations always have food!"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Iamagnu,2,Thu Jun 11 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"That sounds lovely! I didn't realise there is a ceremony for girls, too - that's awesome."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jun 11 21:18:15 2015 UTC,That's so sweet about your grandmother! I hope you enjoy the weekend :) Take a couple minutes here and there to just hold mini gnu away from all the visitors if you need to get away from it all for a bit too.
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,GrammaMo,2,Thu Jun 11 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds great (as long as you have good family, that is . . .) and totally exhausting. I love that your grandmother's coming! My partner's grandmother was alive when our first was born and got to see her many times before she passed when our daughter was 3. I'm so glad we were able to make that happen for both of them."

We're going to see a movie with M during a matinee showing catering to babies (quieter sound, dim lights, change tables provided, etc)  I guess it's only sort of a date though, because we are visiting the in-laws for an early dinner after afterwards. But hey, it's technically dinner and a movie so I'll take it haha!"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,GrammaMo,2,Thu Jun 11 14:15:49 2015 UTC,I didn't know that exists! I should check my cinema and see if they do this!

InfertilityBabies,39fx27,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it! The lower volume was actually nice in general compared to how crazy loud movies usually are. M pretty much slept through the whole thing, but it was nice  knowing that it wouldn't be totally rude if she made some baby noises (she's a bit of a grumbly, grunty baby lol) They also have change tables set up right outside the theatre with extras of anything you'd need (diapers, wipes, etc) and a microwave."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,GrammaMo,3,Fri Jun 12 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"So... I've managed to completely offend my FIL. We work together, and for the most part its ok. Lately we've been having some trouble, and its because he's hit a wall and ready to retire but has no plan in place. It hink its just sort of hit him, and he'll sort it out. In the meantime, he's been really cranky. He's very sensitive.  But, I've just started telling people, and I took the staff members aside one by one to tell them I'm pregnant. I don't like being the centre of attention so no big announcement just a ""Hey, so, I'm pregnant."" There's only 6 other people here so no big deal.  Today in the car, he said ""Its going to be so fun in the office now that everyone knows.""   My response: ""No, it won't. We need to keep it professional, and this is personal. I don't mind it coming up once in a while, but its going to be low key. I won't be making an announcement to clients, and I will not tolerate being made the centre of attention.""  He didn't say another word the rest of the ride (20 minutes).  You see... When I married his son, he started pointing out in meetings that I had his last name but its not because I married him, its because I married his son! Hahaha, isn't that funny? This would be in meetings where I might have been meeting someone for the FIRST time. Way to be unprofessional, and undermine my reputation.  Then he wanted grandbabies and started to talk about that in meetings. If we ran a focus group and someone said they had grandkids he'd turn to me and make a big show of saying something like ""Did you hear that? FOUR grandkids! It must be really nice to have grandkids.""  Again, completely humiliating, unprofessional, sexist, and undermining my professional image.   Prior to this I was too unsure of how to deal with it, I'd change the subject, make it clear that it was over, and move on. So now, I'm nipping this shit in the bud. I'm not having the ""Hey guess who had unprotected sex with my son!"" kind of conversations, because that's what it comes down to.  I don't know if I should sit him down and out and out say that he's completely humiliated me in the past, and be blunt, leave it with what I've said or what? But right now, he's acting like a puppy that's been kicked, and I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm a moody pregnant lady who is not letting him be excited. And I just want him to be fucking professional at work.  Grr."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,2,Thu Jun 11 16:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah on the NT! Congrats!  Had a pretty nice morning. Baby let me sleep until 7, then we walked my husband to the bus stop, came home, and he went down for a nap! Of course, he's been napping way longer than I expected which is messing up my plans since I have to be in bed with him or else he'll wake up... But oh well! We roll with it.  Oh, also - husband has a work dinner tonight, so I'm on my own until after bed time. Thank goodness I get a break while my sister watches him when I go to the gym, but it's going to be a looooong day!"

InfertilityBabies,39fx27,messofletters,2,Thu Jun 11 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"Read your phone and let the baby be. The laundry will wait. That's my mo anyways - you're not going to get much laundry done with an overtired kiddo! Besides, he's probably getting some milk, so I'm sure the horrible LC would approve! ;p"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jun 11 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"Haha that's true. I did end up going to the appointment. It was just a weigh in, but he's at 8lb7 now.

InfertilityBabies,39fx27,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jun 11 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"Hooray for a good NT scan!  Today is my parents' last day here and my dad is finally tired enough to just spend time at our house with us. He's in the dog house with me because last night for dinner he went out to the grocery store and bought a bunch of stuff he wanted to eat (some steaks, asparagus, mushrooms, and other stuff), comes over to my house with it and just leaves it on the counter while he goes and sits down on the couch. I was like, ""Uhhh...are you expecting me to cook this now?"" He goes, ""Well the short answer is yes."" I told him that was extremely rude and if he wanted a nice dinner at home he could have mentioned it earlier and given me time to prepare a meal. I told him I wasn't going to cook his steaks for him. So then of course my super passive mom says she'll do it. -.- Ugggghhhhh.   Then we forgot to put out water during dinner so instead of asking nicely for some water my dad waits until halfway through the meal  to ask whether we're ""going to get some water or something?"" like my house is a fucking five star restaurant and I'm some errant waitress. He's really the biggest dick sometimes. And it's because no one ever challenges him on anything. My family is sooooo passive and then just bitch to each other after the fact. I'm remembering now why I so desperately needed to get away from all of them after high school. I also thanked Mr. H last night for not being an asshole."

I'm one day away from my newly assigned due date (this date is based on LMP), and I suspect I'm not going into labor any time soon.  I'm still at work, but getting mentally burned out from things, but don't want to take time off because it takes away from PTO on the other end (thanks USA).

InfertilityBabies,39fx27,SJP8,2,Thu Jun 11 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"The morning of the day I gave birth, I was driving to work and just felt insanely sad. Like sentimental sappy sad. A song came on the radio that reminded me of a trip my husband and I took years and years ago before we got married, and I cried. Sobbed. So, watch out for any big hormonal changes! (I know that's easier said than done when you're pregnant, but it was out of character for me, I was pretty even keel throughout my pregnancy and that feeling was completely out of norm for me)"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,hamandcheez,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:53:58 2015 UTC,Interesting to know!  Makes sense given that your body is releasing all of these hormones to signal that baby is ready to get out.
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,SJP8,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry one last thing...did you feel like your body went from 0-60?  As in, the real contractions just started out of ""nowhere"" and kept going?   I feel like even though I'm having a lot of braxton hicks, they go away after I calm down (usually after 5-10 minutes), and then I feel fine but sad/disappointed because my body is not moving along :("
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,SJP8,2,Thu Jun 11 19:49:42 2015 UTC,I'd say yes to this one. But I never noticed any Braxton Hicks.

I thought it was just vaginal discharge as it wasn't bloody at all and just little bits of mucusy goodness at a time.   I had also planned to work until the least possible day.  Funny that you ask because I was at work when my water broke at 3pm. Yeah, awkward. Thankfully, no contractions. Went home, took a quick shower. Stepped out of the shower and the first contraction hit. About 2 minutes layer the next one . That was at about 4.15pm. Yelled for my husband, grabbed the bag,  got to the hospital at 4.30pm.

InfertilityBabies,39fx27,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:07:27 2015 UTC,"Haha! Yeah...  Looking back, it was kind of nice that there was no time to think, no time to make any decisions- I actually asked the doctor as she was introducing herself to me while running next to me down the hallway to the delivery room if it was too late for an epidural. She laughed and said yes. I then asked what I could have to waste the pain and her response only was ""have the baby.""  They actually never even took my shirt off or put a gown on me, just took my shoes and pants off an threw me on the table.   I still get pissed when people tell me I should be lucky to have had such an easy labor...  Because the flip side of this quick delivery were a couple bad second and third degree tears since my body didn't have time to properly prepare (I was very very close to a fourth degree tear). I got my epidural after delivery when they wheeled me off to get stitched up.   But all in all, all went well...  And it makes for a good story, especially since it all happened new year's eve :-)   I was really freaked out about giving birth... But now I think it's an incredibly empowering experience (and not only for natural deliveries). It doesn't matter what way the little one comes out - it's amazing that and what we go through  out of love for our child/ren who we've never met. You guys are going to rock it <3"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,hamandcheez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:53:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing.  Wow!  That 's a crazy story especially on new years eve! Wow!

I have a pretty high pain tolerance and would love to labor at home until I got into active labor.  I do have to take under cosideration situations like yours though.    Third degree sounds pretty painful.  I am only realy scared of episiotomy. It makes me cringe...I almost would rather have c-section than have it done.    There is no way of predicting how my boy will enter the world!  I am just excited to meet him no matter the cost!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,vibeee,2,Fri Jun 12 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"No signs at all. I mean, I had a bit of cramping and soreness in my lower back and felt like I really wanted to go home, but that was just before my water broke and in retrospect, I was totally in early labour without realizing it haha!  So don't give up hope! I was certain I was going to go overdue (I'm pretty sure I complained about it here the day I went into labour lol) and M came on her due date! I had a stretch and sweep too, it's worth doing if it's offered to you."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,GrammaMo,3,Thu Jun 11 21:07:10 2015 UTC,You did! And then you ended up going before me anyway! ☺
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Iamagnu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:41:57 2015 UTC,Yup! I felt very triumphant hahah!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,GrammaMo,2,Fri Jun 12 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"My water broke in the early evening but that morning I had my bloody show (TMI: LOTS of pink/red mucus every time I wiped). Other than that, no contractions or anything. I'd been nesting for a few day prior too. Just cleaning and super anal about everything being in place."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,RositaYouBitch,2,Thu Jun 11 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any signs with my first.  My water broke one day after due date when I felt a low pop in my pelvis.  I did have BH contractions, but nothing else."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,curiouslywanting,2,Thu Jun 11 22:54:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Nothing. Admittedly it was my busy season at work so things were crazy, but I went to bed and woke up when labor started at 2AM. Seven hours later, the little man was here."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,ReindeerPoopRVA,2,Fri Jun 12 00:14:23 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at the stage where I'm convincing myself that this pregnancy is going to fail, and I'm only 4.5 weeks along. My beta numbers went from 85-150 in 2 days and my nurse didn't seem too thrilled about that. I go back tomorrow morning for a third beta draw. It's completely messing with my mind, and right now I'm SO regretting buying some baby onesies. Aside from that, I'm tired and my boobs hurt (which I'm actually loving because I have wanted to experience pregnancy symptoms for sooo long!). I'm going to try and distract myself as much as possible today by doing lots of cleaning."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,KatiexS,3,Thu Jun 11 14:09:42 2015 UTC,"My beta numbers didn't actually double, and my nurse was less than reassuring for me. However, everything turned out well and I'm currently being kicked. So try not to fret (easier said than done) and enjoy being pregnant as much as possible! I'm sending as many good vibes your way as I can!"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,NeonHairedSqueezle,3,Thu Jun 11 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, the uncertainty is just the fucking worst. I'll keep my fingers crossed for tomorrow!"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,messofletters,3,Thu Jun 11 14:32:37 2015 UTC,"I worried so much in the beginning as well. I think its so normal, especially amongst people like us -- it took so much for us to get pregnant, that its hard to let go of that feeling that ""the other shoe is going to drop"". I'll be 15 weeks tomorrow, and I still feel that way. I keep thinking that it'll get better with each milestone, and it sort of does, but its not really leaving.   hang in there! Take lots of deep breaths and practice self soothing. When the anxiety rises, just reassure yourself ""Right now, I'm pregnant. Everything is going ok. Today, we're pregnant."""
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,2,Thu Jun 11 16:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, I remember constantly checking that my symptoms were still there during first tri.  Good thoughts for tomorrow!"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,sonirose,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:58:00 2015 UTC,I'm 13+4 and still grab my boobs throughout the day to make sure they still hurt. Infertility brain just makes it impossible to live in the moment and hope for the best. I would be just as stressed in your shoes but at least you don't have long to wait for the beta. I really hope it turns out okay!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,WhateverYouSay1084,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"So glad to hear your results came back as low-risk!  I just finished dealing with allergy shots, and am now heading home. I now have 3.5 days with NO PLANS. And no obligations - I took care of some stuff for work yesterday. We might get together with my husband's cousin and his fiancée on Sunday, and some friends are hosting a casual get together that afternoon. But other than that, I can sleep, play video games, and catch up on Orphan Black at my leisure.  Oh - and I am stupidly excited that some of the grass seed I put down has sprouted! It's patchy and not the greatest looking, but there is grass where there was brown dirt and weeds so I am calling it a win. I'm planning to put down some fertilizer and re-seed in September once the hotter weather has passed."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,septicidal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"jealous of having no plans! That will be amazing. Also, Orphan Black is sooo good. I'm super behind and want to binge watch it."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"Just left my 38 week appt. Still Fort Knox in there.   And we'll see what happens between now and my appt next Friday, but assuming the status quo keeps, I have decisions to make about inducing on the 25th. My Dr happens to already be on call that day, so that's a pro. If I'm not dilated yet then they want me to come in the night before, which is ok, but I'm worried that if I'm not dilated am I trying to force him out too early? So I could wait, but then I have to figure out what to do about work, and who knows when my Dr is on call again. And also, what if I don't dilate any even after waiting? I worry about baby getting bigger the longer we wait, and problems with placenta coming up too. Plus I'm really ready to get this baby out. Does that make me a terrible mom? I want to make the best decision for both of us, but I'm struggling to figure out what that is.  Sigh."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,ky_grown90,2,Thu Jun 11 15:11:46 2015 UTC,I know what you mean.  The induction decision is so difficult.  Is your dr. giving you an option or does (s)he saying you have to be induced by a certain date?
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,traveler5678,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:46:04 2015 UTC,"He's giving me the option, I'm just struggling because there are pros and cons both ways!  I think right now though, because we expect him to be big, I'm leaning towards going ahead with the induction. No research I've found has been definitively positive/negative either way and I think that I'll feel better not waiting longer."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,ky_grown90,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'll have an option or not, but I'm totally with you on the pros and cons both ways.  It makes it really hard b/c it seems that the growth u/s can be really far off."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,traveler5678,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:36:29 2015 UTC,"My doc hasn't even actually done a growth u/s bc he doesn't trust them. We're just going off of my fundal height and the GD. I think that's why he's being more lenient.  If it weren't for the GD, I'd wait another week. But I think we've decided that the potential risks of waiting outweigh the possible benefits of my cervix deciding to cooperate.   That's how I feel today at least, hah!"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,ky_grown90,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"Also congrats on the good NT results! And yes, I would kill for a Margarita."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,ky_grown90,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yay for good NT results!!! I had mine on Tuesday and won't get the blood results back til next week, but the ultrasound was totally normal and the doc said everything looked great. I know what you mean about feeling convinced that something will go wrong...my husband is having a hard time even talking about anything pregnancy related and doesn't think he will feel safe until viability. It does tend to put a damper on things but after so much previous failure I guess I can't blame him too much."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,WhateverYouSay1084,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"Mine had his ""moment"" the other night when you could clearly look at my belly and see that the baby had shifted all to the left side.  He was all ""awwww, there's a baby in there"" and now he's started to get excited."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,jaina_jade,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"So uh, guys? Question?  I was sitting at my desk and felt something strange. I was sitting very still, sort of lost in thought, and I felt, slightly to the left, a sensation... it was like... ok, you know when you're in the pool and you push something underwater that traps air, and big bubbles float up? If you were to hold your hand in the water so the bubbles hit your hand, that's what it felt like. Not small bubbles but a gentle feeling like bigger loose bubbles. I felt it like a series of bubbles internally and it lasted for maybe 5 secs and then stopped. I've never noticed a feeling like that.  Is it possible it was the baby?  I'm 15 weeks tomorrow, which isn't unheard of to feel it, but not as common for a first time mom. I'm also a bit overweight, so I've sort of assumed it would be closer to 20 weeks before I felt anything. I'm also wondering if its a bias as when I check for the heartbeat, its always off to the left, so maybe I'm putting two and two together and getting 5?"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,3,Thu Jun 11 20:39:26 2015 UTC,Sounds like baby flutters to me! : )
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,MrsDragon,2,Thu Jun 11 21:44:12 2015 UTC,Holy crap! I really hope so! Now to wait and see if it comes back again
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,2,Thu Jun 11 22:04:55 2015 UTC,Totally sounds like little tiny baby kicks! How exciting!!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,GrammaMo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"I'm thrilled! I thought I'd have to wait a lot longer. You know, with all the fear in the infertility and struggle, feeling that was the first moment that I genuinely felt a connection."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,2,Fri Jun 12 16:00:01 2015 UTC,"How fun!!! Baby movements are so great! You'll start to notice it more but not all at once, so don't let that worry you (like it did me!)"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,TigFan15,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:46:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up about not feeling it all the time at first! I haven't felt it since, but I'm still basking in it!"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:59:34 2015 UTC,Totally sounds like a baby!  Have your hubs listen to your belly when it happens. It's pretty amazing!
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,vibeee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:11:25 2015 UTC,"Its so cool! I haven't felt it since, but I'm assuming that's just because its early. When I used the doppler at home, the heartbeat was right where I felt it (though it was hours later!)"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it definitely could be baby! I felt first movement at 15 weeks, and got told I couldn't be feeling him that early. A coupleasure weeks later and I was sure it was him in there."
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,montanadoodle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:26:05 2015 UTC,"That is so cool! I definitely felt it shouldn't be him this early, but if you felt it too, that's really reassuring. When I got home I used the doppler in the same area I felt it and there he was with his heartbeat! (though it was hours later and he could have moved around)"
InfertilityBabies,39fx27,Bibbityboo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"You'll know for sure soon, if it's baby you'll start feeling it more often!"

InfertilityBabies,39bf87,MrsDragon,10,Wed Jun 10 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I am in your boat as we speak, twins and all! I measured around 3.8 at 16w, around 3.3 at 18w and dropped to 1.5 at 20w with massive funneling. I also have a history of pre-term birth that resulted with months of hospitalization and delivery of my son (who didn't make it) at 32w. It was terrifying to say the least, we were told all sorts of things and it a lot of it made it sound like we might not even make it to viability.  I did TONS of research and luckily, since I was so high risk going into the pregnancy, we have a team of doctors rather than just one that were able to answer all of our questions.  Firstly, you are not in hot water, yet. Anything around a 2.5 is worth watching, but it's not considered too serious until it shortens to 1.5 or below. The bed rest is cautionary at this point.  Secondly, the bed rest works in most cases. I am now 31w5d and was just taken off of full bed/pelvic rest and moved back to modified bed rest. I have also been taking vaginal progesterone, but since that only has a proven success rate of about 30% in singleton pregnancies, I am putting more stock in the bed rest.  It is probable that you will deliver early, but that could mean that you deliver at 35 weeks instead of the twin 38. Are you going to do a cerclage? I can answer questions about those if you have any, I was not a candidate for a number of reasons but I had several meetings with top docs to discuss them.  It can get better. We were so scared...more than scared, actually. However, at my last cervical length check, I actually had grown back a little length and measured about 2.0cm again! This happens frequently.  Bed rest sucks, you will be so bored and at times you will feel helpless. I actually cried one day because my SO ""had"" to do the dishes....again. I hate not being able to do my own laundry, or cook, or dust or work or go out and socialize, but you can find ways to entertain yourself, at least somewhat, haha.  I started off thinking this would be a great time for me to catch up on all of my documentaries and foreign films, to read my heart out, maybe start a blog. I did start out strong, but I was binge watching ""16 and Pregnant"" last week on Netflix, so for me at least, I did not accomplish what I thought I would, hahaha. I did do some crafting though, some painting of little figurines and such. I also gardened, I had my SO bring me flowers and potting soil and planted flowers from a seated position outside on our porch. Simple but therapeutic.  Don't be afraid to let people know you are on bed rest. I personally kept the reasons pretty secretive but I did let out that I was on bed rest and people were so wonderful. I loved getting visits and so many people brought us food, it was such a pick-me-up.   Don't beat yourself up for the little things. At the beginning I was scared to even get up and refill my water and the frequent trips to the bathroom were super guilt inducing. Life has to go on at some point, just stay down as much as you possibly can and try not to sweat the little things.  If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask! I sincerely hope you are a part of the lucky majority that lasts many many more weeks from where you are currently. I will be keeping my fingers crossed for you."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,Idem22,2,Wed Jun 10 21:56:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! This is really reassuring to hear. My husband has put together a great little set up for me--I have one of those water jugs with a pour spout and a mini fridge with snacks so I can be reasonably self sufficent while he's at work. But it's a little nerve wracking since I'm not really sure what is ""bed rest"" position and what isn't. My nurse said I could sit up, but sitting 90 degrees seems like it would be very similar to standing? So I'm trying to stay reclined which is a little awkward. I'm sure I'll get it figured out with practice.  My doctor hasn't mentioned a cerclage yet; I suspect they want to see where we are at the scan in 2 weeks. But I may very well be back with questions! : )  I let people know I'm on bedrest and got several offers of  ""let me know if you need anything"", which is awesome, but I'm not really sure what to ask for? I think the biggest thing would probably be some help for my husband who is now going to have to be doing everything, but I'm not sure if he wants the help? Or what would be most helpful. It may get more obvious with time. What was most helpful for you?  How far along are you? Any tips for neck support? That's been the worst part so far, figuring out a good way to recline without my neck killing me."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,Idem22,2,Thu Jun 11 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"Pillows, pillows and more pillows, haha. That is what helped me with my neck. I moved from couch to bed as well, and thank goodness because even that little bit of change of scenery contributed to my not going insane.   I am 32w now, I was just taken off of the full bed rest this week and moved to modified. I celebrated by going to a local trivia event and taking a trip to Target and riding in the mechanical wheelchair (my SO insisted). It was pretty glorious to be out of the house! I had cheated a few times before, once I got near 28 weeks, I went to my grandmothers for Mother's Day (seated as much as possible of course) and another time my dr's gave me permission to get a pedicure after a dr appointment, otherwise, I was pretty much down-down, especially before hitting viability day at 24w.  People helped with meals mostly, that is what worked for us. I had another friend offer to pick up our laundry, but I just wasn't comfortable with him cleaning my skivvies, if you know what I mean. We also allowed my sister and my nephew to come and mow the yard once or twice. I am SO lucky that my SO didn't seem bothered with the chores at home while working his full-time job. Of course, the dishes were minimal since he doesn't cook and the laundry tended to be put into a pile rather than hung up or folded, but that is a little thing in the scheme of things. Another friend came over to help my SO paint the nursery when I relented to allowing baby things to happen again once we hit 24 weeks.   Be sure to encourage your SO to get out of the house when he can (even little errands etc). Just because you are stuck at home doesn't mean he is, and letting him have little breaks will keep you from driving each other crazy. I was pretty needy at first and had to learn how much this helped us the hard way.  You are probably already pretty uncomfortable with twins at your stage, this will only get worse. They said I was measuring as if I were full-term with an 8lb baby - when I was ONLY 27 weeks, omg. I keep hitting the point where I think it can't get any worse, but it always seemingly can! (this is funny, right? haha?)  I started contractions on the regular at about 21 weeks, too. At first they scared me and I hoofed it up to OB ER a few times, but my now they are just a regular part of my day. Once, they were only four minutes apart, even on the monitors at the hospital, but they went away on their own. I hear this is fairly common with women who have shortened cervix's, so be sure to watch out for those. They CAN cause you to dilate, but they don't always...I have been ""a fingertip"" only for over a month now.  Being in the hospital like I was with my son was much, much, much worse, but being on bed rest with a shortened cervix with twins is pretty bad. It's boring, it's terrifying, it's emotional, it's scary. I only told a few people outside of my family how serious it was because it felt safer somehow, but you will know how to handle that for yourself. I did let out on social media that I was on bed rest, though, but let people assume it was because I am pregnant with twins.  When you go to your next appointment, ask if you can tour your NICU. I am hopeful you will last a lot longer, but just in case, this will help you get an idea of what your world will be like if you deliver before 35 weeks.  Please, please, let me know if I can answer anything else for you, or if you just want to chat. I was so scared when I got the news you just got, I would have loved someone who had just gone through it. <3"
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,spankyjubblies,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:30:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, this is very helpful! We've done a tour of L&D but they wouldn't let us tour the NICU. Which makes sense from the standpoint of they are doing important work in there. I have a lot of faith in our NICU though, it's a level III so it's where all the babies from the region go. As much as I'd like to avoid the NICU, I also know that if our babies need that level of care that they will get great care there.  I didn't realize contractions went with shortened cervixes (cervixi?) but that makes sense. Def. keeping any eye out for anything unusual!  I imagine at 32 weeks you are very uncomfortable! I keep forgetting how pregnant I am until I try to do something wild like sit up or pick something up off the floor. :) I was really looking forward to waddling around at crazy pregnant size and making everyone do double takes that I was still up and going. So much for that plan! : D  Hooray for being put on modified bed rest! : D   There is still enough going on/getting worked out that the bed rest still feels pretty novel. Working from home will help too (if I can ever get this stuff set up right!). I have a feeling I'll start crawling the walls soon enough though."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,apanda1084,6,Fri Jun 12 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"I was put on bed rest for the same reason at 22 weeks (with the same privileges as you), had a cerclage done at 24 weeks, went into preterm labor at 25 weeks which they held off until 27+3 when I delivered my boys via c-section. I was in the hospital on bedrest from 25 weeks onward.   When I was at home I watched TV, read, napped, played games, whatever I could do from the couch or bed. Husband would take me out on drives in the evening before it got dark (my favorite time of day) - I would just recline the seat back so I wasn't upright. Those car rides helped keep me sane because I got to see sunshine and feel the breeze. If there was more shade in our yard I probably would've taken our zero gravity chair and reclined out there too.   When I was in the hospital it was harder. I really missed home and husband, I was bored and never got to go outside. I didn't want visitors. I didn't cope well. Hopefully you'll be able to do fine at home without any complications.   Anyway, feel free to read my comment/post history. I'd be happy to offer and advice or insight I can."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,Wolf_Lady,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:12:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I joined the sub while you were in the hospital, so I hadn't realized you had been on home bed rest at first. I greatly appreciate the support!"
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,robyn_sparkles,4,Thu Jun 11 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have bed rest experience, but I can tell you I totally relate to the feeling cheated out of my experience, not trusting my own body and feeling like I should be given some sort of break because of what I went through to even get pregnant.   I'm so sorry. Hang in there and know those boys will be worth every bit of it. I promise you that."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,Bibbityboo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:08:33 2015 UTC,Thank you! This means a lot. It's nice to know other people can relate to this cocktail of feelings.
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,honmamichin,5,Thu Jun 11 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry.  Bed rest sucks and the feeling of your body betraying you is even worse.  I only have half a uterus and unfortunately my cervix is very weak because of it.  They found my cervix shortening at 21 weeks (measured 8mm) and placed a cerclage the following week, I was 2cm dilated.  That put me on bed rest until the cerclage was removed at 36+2 and my daughter was born at exactly 37 weeks.  My best advice is keep yourself busy and set small goals.  I watched a lot of Netflix, did a ton of online shopping, played games, and was able to work from home for a while.  For the goals we would celebrate when I reached 24 weeks, then 28 weeks, then 32 weeks, etc.  My restrictions were the same as yours until I reached 28 weeks.  After that I could sit at the table for dinner and be on my feet for 30 minutes.  As I got further along they would lift more restrictions.  By 34 weeks I could get out of the house as long as I took it easy and didn't walk around a lot.  A friend of mine who also experienced shortened cervix with twins had a lot of success with the progesterone suppositories and bed rest.  Her restrictions were lifted bit by bit and in the end her babies were very stubborn and she had a scheduled C-section (breach) at around 38 weeks.  Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,honmamichin,2,Wed Jun 10 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's so good to hear these happy endings. :) I'm still holding out hope for a ""boring"" pregnancy as much as possible."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,ky_grown90,3,Thu Jun 11 20:00:03 2015 UTC,"Oh bed rest just sucks.  I used to think it sounded awesome... hello snacking and watching Netflix all day, but I found out quickly it's not all it's cracked up to be, particularly during the nice weather compared to cold snowy days.  My survival strategy was created on the fly, but it involved having lots of visitors.  My best friend would bring snacks and we would have a movie marathon, talk, play games etc.  I was definitely getting depressed, so just pay attention to how you feel. And don't be afraid to tell friends what you want/need from them.  In my experience, people don't want to feel like they are intruding.  I hope that it's not terribly boring for you- getting set up to work, even a little bit, sounds like a good thing to help keep you occupied.  Hopefully they will let you off, or change it to modified bed rest after your two weeks."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,spankyjubblies,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"Haha! Yes, bed rest sounds awesome when you think of it like a snow day. (And tbh, if I could be sewing, I'd probably not mind as much. But it's hard to operate a sewing machine from bed! :)  Yea, even as introverted as I am, I figure it won't take too long before I'm dying for some company! Vists sound awesome."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,ky_grown90,3,Thu Jun 11 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Aww, I'm so sorry you're stuck on bedrest, that completely sucks. This is my first pregnancy and I'm not as far along as you, so I can't speak to what it was like at your stage. I did do 3 weeks of bedrest with a SCH starting around week 6. I was miserable, but part of that was my own fault for not planning better. My advice:   TELL People. Part of my issue was I was lonely and beyond bored. I needed social interaction, but wasn't comfortable telling people. So I suffered, and got crankier and crankier and more miserable. Now that you've told people tell them how they could help. Like, your best friend ""Hey, what if we made Thursday nights our thing? I'd love to play cards and hang out?"" People want to help, they don't know how. Get a set up going if you can. I found having an ipad really helpful, so I could internet, and I figured out a system of what I needed around me -- water, chargers, blankets, etc. Get movie recommendations. You will run out of things to watch. Mindless tv shows become very welcome. Your husband is going to have to take over everything. Including meals. I found that if I could plan ahead what I wanted, and think about easy to grab things, it made it easier for when he was at work. He was also a bit lost. So direction helped. Continuation of above -- let go of things. My husband doesn't clean like I did. He doesn't prep for the next day, do all the ironing at once (he irons every morning while rushing to get ready for work. Quite the system). At first, it really, really bothered me. I had to accept that I couldn't change things. Stupid things -- best day of bedrest? We played hookie. Couldn't do anything, so my husband took me for a car ride. Drove along a scenic route, ice cream cone at the drive through, and then home and back to the couch. It was such a peaceful break after a number of weeks. If you can get permission to do something like that it really, really was a nice break.   Hang in there!"
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,spankyjubblies,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you! My husband has made me a very nice setup! I've got a mini-fridge with snacks and one of those 2.5 gallon water bottles with a spigot so I can ""Self-serve"" while he is at work.   I imagine not wanting to tell people would be tough! And especially so early, that makes things really difficult! Thankfully, we'd already announced the pregnancy, so that makes it easier to at least let people know what is going on. We're getting lots of offers of help, it's just hard to know what to ask for just yet. I feel bad that my husband now has to shoulder everything. It was bad enough when I was doing very little because I was so tired, but now it's literally ""your job is to incubate, stay put!"" : / Poor guy. We were just getting rolling with nursery set up and everything else."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,becabecaful,3,Thu Jun 11 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"I think it will depend on a lot of factors whether you have to stay on bed rest until delivery, but in my experience obs and mfms generally take the most conservative measures possible in these cases, so I'd lean toward it being likely that you'll have to at least limit your activity until labor, though your restrictions may ease up with time.  I was on hospital bed rest from 27+1 until my delivery at 34 weeks due to preterm labor (my cervix somehow went from normal at 24 weeks to 3cm dilated 80% effaced at 27 :/). Originally there was a small chance that I could have been sent home (still on bed rest) once labor had been stopped, but that went out the window when I tested positive for a rupture of membranes (water broke early).   I remember being very frustrated because the doctors couldn't tell me why this was happening to me--it turns out the whys of preterm labor aren't very well understood and they can't diagnose something like incompetent cervix unless they've monitored you for it throughout pregnancy I guess. Anyway, I just remember being confused and annoyed about that, but it did help to talk with my doctors about my confusion and what they were thinking for the direction of my care. So I definitely suggest calling your doctor and communicating with them about what your treatment from here on out could look like (I.e. is there a chance you will be able to be more active after a while, etc?). That might at least give you a better idea of what to expect.  Overall bed rest was fine for me, but I'm not sure how well I would have done at home vs. the hospital. In the hospital I was getting monitored 4 times a day by nurses, with doctor's rounds in the morning and meals delivered to me in bed. There were plenty of opportunities for interaction with other people even when I had no visitors, so I wasn't super lonely. At home I wouldn't have had that, and a lot more temptation to get up and move around more than I was supposed to. :/ As it was, I spent a lot of time watching Netflix and doing word puzzles and that sort of thing."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,mrswhiskerson,2,Wed Jun 10 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you! The mystery of it all is rather frustrating. I def. plan to ask more questions, I was rather blindsided by the whole thing, so I wasn't braining as well as I could have been."
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,TigFan15,2,Thu Jun 11 21:22:02 2015 UTC,I completely understand! It took several conversations with my MFM doctors to really absorb everything that was going on and what they were thinking. It's a lot to take in.
InfertilityBabies,39bf87,vibeee,2,Thu Jun 11 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"I know that /u/spankyjubblies is busy with her sweet boys but I hope she'll be able to chime in here. She posted pretty regular updates during her experience, so a quick search of the sub would probably be valuable too!"

InfertilityBabies,39apfy,kml327,8,Wed Jun 10 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'm so glad to hear about your twins! Sadly though, you're finding what many (most? All?) of us do, which is that a pregnancy, and live birth, don't erase what you've been through. Be gentle with yourself - it is totally normal to still have complicated feelings like this.  If you can, I'd suggest giving your mom a head 's up that you may need to step or of the room, and then give yourself permission to the care of yourself first. You can always use the excuse of getting coffee, ice water, snacks... And when you're feeling done, leave the hospital. Take a cab or uber if you need to. ""I'm so happy for you guys but just exhausted "" is totally reasonable, even if your weren't pregnant!"
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,pamplemousse2,3,Wed Jun 10 14:05:38 2015 UTC,"This and if you do start crying, no one is going to question the tears. They will just assume you are hormonal or happy like a non-infertile. Just be easy on yourself and know your own limits."

InfertilityBabies,39apfy,ky_grown90,6,Wed Jun 10 21:32:14 2015 UTC,"The only reason I was able to attend a recent baby shower was because I was pregnant...even then it was difficult.  If I hadn't been pregnant I wouldn't have been able to go.  I still have a hard time with people who conceive easily ie: ""it was our first month te he he"" or gloat on facebook.  eff that."
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,robyn_sparkles,3,Wed Jun 10 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"I completely get this. My husband has a cousin and I thought we were friends. She got pregnant on her first try and knew we were having trouble -- I had told her we were now going to the fertility clinic. She started to gloat, and rub it in my face! Told me I was doing things wrong. Then she told me she's decided to tell my MIL that she wanted her called Grandma (making three grandmas). She said this was because we couldn't give her a grandbaby (to me not MIL). She acted like it had all been some sort of competition, which I had never felt. I won't ever cut some slack for her because that's not something you say by accident, and then throw in that she's a psychologist? Bitch knows better. Her baby is now just about a year, and sure enough...MIL is all happy being a grandma. It hurt so much and I didn't handle it well.  It also means a lot of time hearing all about the baby, and having no polite way to be like ""Don't talk to me about that bitch's parenting choices."" There's somethings I""ve learned:   People are self absorbed, they mostly don't notice your pain, so you can fake it, even if your'e bad at it. If you cry, blame your hormones, or say you're just so happy for them, if you say the right things, people willsee what they want to see Keep yourself busy -- make sure people eat, see if the couple need anything from home. Go into a nurturing mode. It will keep yourself busy, potentially give you things to do that give you breaks, AND people will see you as being helpful and kidn and won't notice if you're hiding your pain. Use your pregnancy as an excuse ""This is so wonderful! I'm so happy for them....I just need to step outside to clear my head,I've been fighting morning sickness all day...."" Hormones, morning sickness, back pain, they are currently your friend. If youc an tell your mother so you have an ally do it, but I understand if you can't. No one in my family gets it. If you can go on your own so you can controlwhen you leave do that!    Its hard, it really, really is. And its ok. Even if the day is just about surviving."
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,Bibbityboo,4,Wed Jun 10 14:29:04 2015 UTC,That cousin? What. A. [insert nasty word of choice here. I can't pick just one.] I can't even.  Your advice is great though!

InfertilityBabies,39apfy,robyn_sparkles,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"I will definitely never forget. If she wasn't family, she'd have been cut out completely. Now, I'm just going to silent out do her on everything, and let the family gossip rave about what we do so it silently rubs it all into her. Plus, I'm secretly hoping she gets a divorce (second marriage, I wouldn't care about anyone else being married more than once, but I'm looking at the flaws now!). It would make me feel sooo good to see her fail."
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,Bibbityboo,2,Wed Jun 10 16:46:18 2015 UTC,"Nothing to add, because everyone else pretty much nailed it:  those painful feelings take a long time to go away.

InfertilityBabies,39apfy,sonirose,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"Oh girlfriend, I totally get it!  My brother told me 2 weeks after my MMC that he and his wife were pregnant... with their 4th... and it was an accident.  He then proceeded to tell me that if I would just relax I could get pregnant, too.  Two weeks after my MMC.  People that aren't in it, just don't get it.  To say the least, I had a lot of mixed emotions about this new addition.  My SIL ended up having a lot of issues with her pregnancy including passing a blood clot the size of a hockey puck Christmas morning.  That kind of changed my attitude.  Their baby was born a couple of weeks ago, 4 weeks premature, but he's doing well.  I'm very happy for them but it took a lot to get there.  At one point my mom had the NERVE to suggest that she throw them a baby shower and I lost my shit.    You are allowed to feel however you feel!  Just remember that.  I've found in my family that it's best to just not engage with my brother, he's never going to get it, so I just vent here and to my husband and I put on a happy face around him and the family.  Good luck and hang in there!  Just think of how much more exciting TWO will be!!  Also, you can always Lord that over your SIL when she tries to complain about how hard raising her one is ;)"
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,TigFan15,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry this is hard for you but congrats on your pregnancy. Your feelings are definitely justified. Maybe when you get there and see the baby, things will feel different. I always had a really hard time with pregnancies but when the babies actually arrived it didn't seem to matter so much. I ended up loving the babies as their own person. But, if not, if you do break down, that's ok. You can be honest about your feelings with everyone or you can just blame it on your joy and hormones. I agree with the suggestion of letting your mom in on how you feel though. It might just be nice to hear her say out loud that she's going to love your babies just as much as this one. Good luck!"
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,RositaYouBitch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"The jealousy and anger doesn't go away quickly, if ever.  I've seen folks post pregnancy stuff and big belly pictures on facebook WHILE HOLDING MY BABY and been swept with waves of rage.  Fertiles just don't get it, but we all do.  Does anyone in your family know about your twins? (PS what a fantastic due date!) Can your mom cover for you? Definitely seconding pamplemousse2 - take breaks.  If you're visiting just after baby is born she'll be wiped out too - I didn't really want visitors but we had to let the parents in and no one stayed long. And if you can't hold it together don't try. Let the tears out."
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,larabair,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"I totally get your feelings! I'd say they are normal. MY SIL is pregnant with her 3rd oops and she is extremely upset about this one. She still doesn't ""know how to feel about it"".  Even though I am also pregnant right now I still have issues processing it.  You feel what you feel and don't feel badly about it.  I'm sorry :-("
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,cakegroove,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:27:00 2015 UTC,Nope completely understandable! IF and its effects don't go completely away with a live birth.  I have a beautiful baby boy and I am still bitter that my drug addict SiL is easily pregnant.
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,effingeffstick,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:28:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think they ever go away. I got ragey when a friend of mine posted on facebook at New Years that her goal for 2015 was to get pregnant. We got pregnant at the end of January and she got pregnant about a month and a half or two months after us. Even though I was already pregnant at this point, it totally pissed me off that it was that ""easy"" for her. Everytime she posts anything baby related I get grumpy. But she's my friend! I totally want to be excited for her and she's had her own share of health issues, so it's not like everything's just been easy for her. But I'm just not there yet.  I think the other suggestions are great--go for a bit, stay busy, and then excuse yourself. She'll have lots of other people who are 110% excited and you'll have gone and been supportive."
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,MrsDragon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel. My brother got a gal pregnant within weeks of knowing her, while I was struggling and ultimately found out  I have nonfunctioning fallopian tubes. The real kicker was when she stole my baby name, but that's a whole other story. It's so hard to smile through a baby shower you're expected to throw and even love your niece or nephew when you such a black hole inside of you. The day Amelia was born, I fell in love instantly. I was more upset about the pregnancy than anything. Fast forward 3 years and an expensive IVF cycle, I have my own sweet pea and another niece.  I'm still dealing with a lot emotionally but it has gotten easier. I still mourn for the 2 ectopic pregnancies, 1 miscarriage, and Abbey's twin I've lost along the way. I still stress out about if I will ever have other kids or if we will adopt and how we will pay for it.  It does get easier, I promise. But there will also be bad days. Just realize it gets better and it's not our families fault. hugs"
InfertilityBabies,39apfy,lealuo,2,Wed Jun 10 17:58:04 2015 UTC,I just wanted to say that I LOVE the name Amelia and pushed for it for a girl name.  (Ended up with a boy.)

InfertilityBabies,39apfy,montanadoodle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"I went through this. My sister was 9 years younger than me and got pregnant without a problem. She was young, in a uncommitted relationship and lived with my father. It stings a little bit definitely. However, when I held my nephew and you hold your new little niece I suspect those feelings will go away like they did for me. You'll be so excited about the bundles of joy that are coming to you that you wont even be able to contain it. You'll be happy for them when you see it, and you'll be happy for yourself too.   My nephew is now three and I am in my first IVF cycle. I can't imagine how good it feels to be pregnant with twins and I am jealous of you, Sistah!"
InfertilityBabies,39bgz1,KatiexS,5,Wed Jun 10 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not useful on the numbers but I will say this about the nurses' demeanor. They spend all day long having to go back and forth from good news to bad news to routine tests/checks/etc. I find many of them simply adopt a default ""neutral/cautious"" tone. Which always freaked me out because it made me think bad news was coming. Even when she called with our positive pregnancy results, from her initial demeanor, I thought it was going to be negative. That may or may not be true for your nurse, but I did want to throw it out there."
InfertilityBabies,39bgz1,MrsDragon,6,Wed Jun 10 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"Depending on how far you are right now, you are still in normal range. Don't fret until there is a reason to (I know this is nearly impossible). betabase.info"
InfertilityBabies,39bgz1,apanda1084,4,Wed Jun 10 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"The numbers are rising so that's positive right?  From what I've read on hcg numbers the ""normal"" is a huge range and everyone is different.  Hopefully the beta on Friday will put your mind at ease."

Yours went up 76% (doubling time of 58 hours, assuming drawn at same time of day). So hopefully all is well and Friday will bring reassurance!"
InfertilityBabies,39bgz1,sroethele,3,Wed Jun 10 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say as a nurse we are tired, over worked and usually doing 100 things at once.  Taking my demeanor of how I give a lab result means absolutely nothing, we just give you the facts, I know you're anxious but you can't base results on how happy your nurse is when she tells you.  She might have just left a room with a bad situation."
InfertilityBabies,39bgz1,sonirose,0,Thu Jun 11 11:28:13 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you're saying, and I get that nurses are humans too and have good days and bad days. I just really wish she wouldn't have added ""its too early to tell whats going on"" after giving me my results, because it made me feel like something was wrong. I put so much time and emotions and money into this, and I don't want to feel any more stressed out than I have to. That might just be ME as a patient and person, though. Shes a great nurse and I'm really happy to have her - that phone call just made me feel weird."
InfertilityBabies,39bgz1,sonirose,2,Thu Jun 11 13:53:20 2015 UTC,"Rising is good!  Your number isn't quite doubled, but it's very close.  My second number didn't double my first, but by my third it was rising steadily.  Was there something particular that the nurse said or was it more intuition/gut feeling on your end?    Keeping positive thoughts for you for Friday!"

It gave me an uneasy feeling. I hung up the phone with her feeling very upset  - like it wasn't good news. It's rising, which is positive news, but I just feel ""blegh"" about the whole thing. Now I feel like I'm going to be obsessing and full of anxiety until Friday. I really thought the two week wait would be the worst part :/"

That does seem a bit negative, but my nurse was always very positive and reassuring, so I could just have a different expectation.

I'm still not feeling great, but she made me feel a little less panicky. I really don't like how so much emphasis is put on betas. I see how they can be helpful, but I really think that they just cause more stress on the patients part than anything else. Thank you for your feedback. I really appreciate it :-)"
InfertilityBabies,39bgz1,WhateverYouSay1084,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you were comfortable following up! I really think they do sort of distance themselves emotionally from their work (probably for their own sanity). Honestly, they have no idea what will happen. Sometimes great betas have sad endings and vice versa. They have to be able to let it all go at the end of the day. Don't take it personally.   FWIW, I had HPTs and symptoms as my only reassurance until my 8 week ultrasound and I still nearly lost my mind. Beta or no beta, we all find a reason to worry :)"

They're a week old today (already!) and are getting ultrasounds to check for brain hemorrhage. The doctor is confident that there is minimal hemorrhaging because of how active the boys are and how well they're tolerating being born so early.  I don't know if I'm doing so well though. I basically haven't been able to stop crying since leaving the hospital yesterday. Whatever time I get to hold my boys is so precious, and it's never enough. I'm constantly scared that something will happen when we're not there and we won't get the phone call, and we'll show up to the NICU and one of the babies will be gone. I'm just so miserable without them and I know we have weeks and weeks to go before I can bring them home. My heart is breaking.   ETA rant: Sebastian's neighbor in the NICU is a baby who was born early & tiny because mom is a smoker. She's still a smoker and shows up reeking of perfume because she's trying to cover up the cigarette smell. She smells so strongly it's giving me a headache. The nurses have already talked to her several times but she is combative and (obviously) non-compliant. I hate people."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,spankyjubblies,14,Wed Jun 10 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"You NEED to tell your OB or even one of the NICU nurses, anyone who can point you in the direction of support. You're going through so, so much and you have to take care of you first."

I think we often have a hard time asking for help, some how we're conditioned to ""be strong"" and to power through. But I think the real strength is letting people know you need the support -- and then returning the favor when you're back on your feet.  Spanky, you've gone through SO much, and now you're in recovery too -- please get all the support you can."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,RositaYouBitch,4,Wed Jun 10 16:36:38 2015 UTC,Oh honey I'm so sorry. Please reach out for support. I felt a little silly getting into therapy at a week post partum but I'm glad I did. I need(ed) help and you've got so much more going on. Please make sure you're eating and drinking too. Both will help regulate your blood sugar and will help somewhat with your emotions. Definitely talk to someone though. There is no shame at all.

InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,vibeee,2,Wed Jun 10 14:16:08 2015 UTC,Hang in there and try to talk to somebody.  Your boys are doing so great and they are in great hands!  I can't imagine how hard it must be to keep leaving them behind everyday but they will come home with you in few weeks and all of this will be behind you.  Take care.  Hugs!

I've always been impressed by how you have gone through everything you have, but, you're not expected to go at this alone.  Do they have on site support groups for moms or a service where you can receive some sort of therapy at the hospital?"
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,jaina_jade,8,Wed Jun 10 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"Found out last night my mom is engaged (marriage #3) and that she and her soon to be husband have already narrowed down to two dates: 11/21 and 12/5 of this year.  So either 5 days before my due date or 10 days after.  I just don't even know how to process this bit of information.  While I know the world doesn't revolve around me, I figured that the birth of her first grandchild might possibly rate high on her list."

Not that her upcoming nuptials aren't special and important, but this is such a huge deal for you. Plus, marriage #3? I don't mean to offend, but why can't she wait for a bit? So sorry you have to deal with that."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,jaina_jade,4,Wed Jun 10 14:09:20 2015 UTC,I have no clue why they can't wait - especially since my littlest sister is living overseas til the end of March and can't afford to fly home for the wedding.  Logically one would think sometime next summer would be perfect.
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,ky_grown90,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, that would be logical...your mom seems to be picking an inconvenient time on purpose, is she the type who will guilt you and your sister for not being there even though it's absolutely ridiculous?"
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,jaina_jade,2,Wed Jun 10 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, and bring it up whenever - growing up I called it martyr mom mode."

InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,septicidal,2,Wed Jun 10 14:15:52 2015 UTC,"Oh she realizes it, right before she told me the date I made a joke about waddling around in formal wear at 8 months pregnant.  She then giggled (!) and said actually we're looking at 11/21 and 12/05 at which point I retorted with ""oh, so when I'm 9 months pregnant - got it.""  Her response was just ""well those are the dates we think work best"", conversation ended shortly after."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,jaina_jade,4,Wed Jun 10 14:17:47 2015 UTC,"Is it possible your mom wants to upstage you? Maybe I spend too much time thinking about my parental crap and projecting, but... Either she cares about having you there or she doesn't. It seems very strange to insist that those dates are ""best"" without giving any rationalization.  I felt really bad when my wedding wound up being a few weeks after my sister's due date, which meant there was no way she could come - but the wedding month and narrowing down to a few dates had occurred before she got pregnant. I still talked with her and was sad she couldn't be there, but knew that she needed to be home safe with her baby and not flying across the country.  If I were in your shoes, I would be firm about not going. Don't agree to drag a week old infant to a wedding, just say something like. ""Well, I am happy for you but it's too bad we won't be able to attend."" And just keep saying that."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,tittypuncher,6,Wed Jun 10 14:45:01 2015 UTC,"We're not going, even if I haven't had the baby yet there is no way I'm leaving an hour radius of my hospital/doctors especially when my delivery will be considered high risk.  I don't know why they aren't doing this next spring/summer and can only hope that they will reconsider.  Beyond the issue with my dude date, unless they cough up the money to bring my littlest sister home from Australia, she won't be there either as her program doesn't end til March.    It would be totally different if they had been engaged and planning before we got pregnant but at the time we got pregnant they had only been dating a few months - heck even at this point they've still only been dating for months! I think she wants the attention, she's always been a rather selfish person but I never thought she would do something like this.  Just one more reason why I'm thankful for my fantastic MiL"
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,pamplemousse2,6,Wed Jun 10 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"GOOD FOR YOU! Seriously, it's awesome that you're not just going along with it. Having a baby means putting their, and your, needs way before everyone else's, especially just their wants."

InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jun 10 15:05:09 2015 UTC,"I know it will turn in to something - this is the same woman who didn't speak to me for 4 months after I ""dared"" to ask her for a nut-free birthday cake so as not to kill the (then) boyfriend (now husband).  Oh, and the cake was for our joint birthday celebration and I offered to either bake/bring it ourselves if that was easier.  However, it just proved to her yet again how selfish and self-absorbed I am.  The story continues from there but needless to say I'm not that surprised by this - tho it still hurts like hell."

Especially when ta your mother and her 3rd marriage. I hope for all of your sake she comes to her senses and picks a different date as it isn't set in stone yet but from the sound of it it isn't likely. :S"
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,razzertto,3,Wed Jun 10 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Also! My grandfather got remarried like... 12 years ago. He told his 5 kids that they were going to his hometown in PA to get married, but there would only be a minister, him, his wife, and a witness, and there was no celebration, and they were not to come. At this funeral this past summer, they find out that there was a whole ceremony and party, with his siblings, my mom's aunts, uncles, cousins, etc,,, and NONE of my grandfather's kids. And no explanation. So of course everyone thought my mom and her brothers and sister were boycotting, didn't like the new wife, etc etc.   So, apparently parents can be nuts about weddings. You're not the only one!"

I really liked the place for all the reasons** but they are expensive as fuck. Did I mention they are expensive? like my entire paycheck expensive?  ** All the reasons includes they'll throw poop off of cloth diapers, are on board with glass bottles, use real cribs, have indoor and outdoor play spaces, have a dedicated pick up and drop off that isn't on a busy road, good communication with families about their babies, all the babies we saw looked happy and not sitting there crying, later pickup that I should be able to get to, etc etc."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,larabair,2,Wed Jun 10 14:17:01 2015 UTC,I am looking at daycare for my twins and want to cry every time I think about it because we can't afford the great daycares. We can barely afford the OK daycares. Ironically we also can't afford for me not to work. I feel like I'm settling on mediocre for my kids which is the worst feeling in the world.

No joke I was fine one minute and within an hour I have fever, chills and just generally felt weak. Husband let me nap when he got home and I felt much better. I called my provinces health line to see if it was an urgent care kinda problem and the nurse said yes.   Took a hot shower to try and help. And it did but it was too hot and I threw up after.   I'm going to urgent care after my stupid appt with the LC, and I'll tell her it's all her fucking fault."

Finally nursed my 14 month old for the last time the other night and ever since I've been gritting my teeth and hoping I don't get it again. Good news is antibiotics tend to knock it out rather quickly.  I've felt better after 2-3 doses each time.  Tylenol until then, and warm compresses help.  They tell you a wet compress, but I got the most relief by taking a heating pad and wrapping it around my boob. Feel better soon!"

We exchanged a couple of comments recently about our breastmilk-loving babies. My almost 16-month old still shows no interest in food. The pediatrician and dietician want us to night wean via cry-it-out, which I just can't do right now. Did you try something that worked, or did she just start eating on her own?"
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,DookieSandwich,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:00:15 2015 UTC,"Not weird!  This is such a frustrating problem and I don't know if you've felt the same, but I feel super judged by other mothers who don't have picky eaters.  Like its my fault or I've done something wrong. She's still extremely picky but the list of things she'll eat is slowly growing.  She started eating banana last week (first fruit or vegetable ever!) and I cried I was so happy. I've noticed a few things that have helped.  If we don't give her food and just start eating ours in front of her, she wants what we're eating.  I give her a bite and 9/10 she spits it out and I end up making her chicken nuggets.  But sometimes we find something new she'll eat consistently.  Also, she hates her high chair.  She will eat more on my lap than in the chair.  She still refuses to be fed, she has to pick it up and feed herself. The list of what she'll eat is pathetic, and I worry she's not getting all the nutrients she needs, but I don't know what else to do.  We see the doctor again next month.  She eats: Cheerios, bananas!, goldfish crackers, deli turkey, cheese, chicken nuggets, French fries, prune juice, and milk.  And that's it. So you've seen a dietician?  What things have they had you try?"
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,curiouslywanting,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:07:01 2015 UTC,"Also, the night feed was the last to go for us.  Instead of breast feeding her right before bed, my husband rocked her and tried to give her a bottle of whole milk.  She refused the milk but went to sleep and slept through the night.  We did that two nights and then I tried, and she drank the bottle from me.  Go figure?  So she's been drinking a good amount of whole milk before bed like she had been nursing.  She drinks from sippys during the day, but I thought a bottle at night would be ok, and more of a gentle transition for her.  Seems to be working? I just hope she's gained weight at her next visit.  She's always been a 95th percentile baby, last time she was down to 80th, which I know is fine and normal, I just hope she's not starving all the time, you know?"

I'm freaked out by how much negativity there is out there about this choice.  I'm just scared.  How do I know I'll like it?  How do I know we'll be ok financially?

I always thought that's what I wanted to do but now that it's closer to becoming a reality I'm starting to freak out.  I've gotten lots of push back from people, how I'm ""sending woman back to the 50s"" and other less than pleasant comments but if it's the right thing for my family - how can it be wrong?  I figure if it goes to hell, I can start subbing again picking up jobs on days when husband can work from home.

Actually, I was a teacher before we moved out of state and I never got certified in our new state (I just wasn't in love with Florida education and it soured me for the career).  I like your idea of getting my masters... definitely something I'll think about."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,ky_grown90,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"You have nothing to feel guilty for. If this is truly what you want to do, (you aren't being pressured into it) and it works for your family then there's just nothing else that matters. I know it can be very hard not to care about what others think, but as a parent there are always going to be people who will have an opinion about your parenting decisions and think you're doing something wrong. Doesn't matter if you work out of the house or stay home. Just don't listen to any of them. You know what's best for you.  As far as the insecurities about what could happen... Any time you're starting a new endeavor there are going to be fears like this. We can't know everything. Just take it one day at a time and try not to get caught up in what ifs. And there are some things you can plan for. For example, I highly recommend putting a monthly budget together if you don't already have one. Not just because it can keep you from going overboard on spending, but because it can make you feel better about how much you can afford if you're like me and constantly worried about not having enough.  Anyway... I have been a sahm for a year and a half because we haven't been able to afford childcare even if I work (I am in a creative field that is not very lucrative--actually I meant to work from home while taking care of her but I realized that was impossible pretty quickly after she was born). Staying home with her full time is not for me it turns out (she's starting part time daycare in the fall), but even so I am really happy I've spent this time with my daughter. It's been amazing to see her grow and develop into a toddler. So even as a person who didn't plan to take this path, I have a lot of great memories. And there are always new opportunities out there. If you decide it's not for you, you can definitely see about going back to school or looking into other options if going back to your old career doesn't pan out. This is not a life ruining decision!"
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,septicidal,2,Wed Jun 10 21:43:19 2015 UTC,"You've got to do what is best for your baby and your family. If that's staying at home, then that's staying at home. The only person whose opinion matters is your husband. Everyone else can shove off.  And remember, it's not a forever thing. If you try it and it doesn't work, you can try something else. There doesn't have to be one right choice, only the right choice for right now."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jun 10 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"I have been back and forth on both sides of the fence on this one. I'm still back and forth. It's a hard choice, and nothing that anyone here will fault you for. We've got a great mix of working mamas and SAHMs."

I have another appointment in a month to check in and talk more about developing action plans in case I have mood/depression issues after delivery.  I also got in a nice walk in the sunshine, bought some cute Father's Day cards, and am meeting up with a friend during her lunch break.

It feels like a relief, like I've been lying or something! My best friend is an amazing quilter, and I bet is making something right this minute!  My husband's aunt had the best reaction and wouldn't stop hugging me and saying ""We're going to have a baaaaby!"" which made me feel really special. My MIL is sort of driving me crazy, because she knew due to the IVF (I work for my FIL) so she's known for a while and was like ""FINALLY! I can tell everyone!"" Uh no, no you can't. I told her she could tell her bridge friends only, because I dont' know them but that other than that they have to wait for us to tell those that we want to tell. Then she demanded I tell a certain cousin because she wants to talk to her about. I think that cousin is a grade A. Bitch, so she's finding out last. Sorry MIL. Also, my husband's family knows now due to proximity, but MY family hasn't found out yet, so its important to me that people I'm close with find out sooner rather than later."

InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,RositaYouBitch,5,Wed Jun 10 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"Yesterday was my husband's birthday, one of my mom-friends came over and babysat for us for two and a half hours. It was so nice of my friend and, jeez, amazing to go out to dinner without worrying if LL was going to cry the minute my meal came. LL was very well behaved while we were gone, so that worked out.   Also, what's the deal with sleeping like crazy one day (hello four hour nap?) and then fighting sleep the next day? Babies be crazy."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,tittypuncher,6,Wed Jun 10 14:09:25 2015 UTC,"that needs to be a onesie design ""Babies be Crazy"""
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,RositaYouBitch,2,Wed Jun 10 14:56:43 2015 UTC,You said it. Babies be crazy.  Yay for going out! Isn't it nice to do grownup things and not worry about your babe?
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,tittypuncher,3,Wed Jun 10 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"I have an email in to my OB but in the meantime, does anyone know how long you have to wait after giving birth to go swimming in a pool? At my checkup last week she said my cervix was closed but my stitches aren't quite healed yet. I'm 5.5 weeks postpartum."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,GrammaMo,3,Wed Jun 10 15:00:28 2015 UTC,Once you can have sex you can swim. I'd wait until at least 6 weeks pp.
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,GrammaMo,3,Wed Jun 10 15:10:52 2015 UTC,"She did specifically say no sex, or rather it's good we are going to be apart because we shouldn't be having sex anyway. My bleeding is 99% done but maybe I'll just dangle my feet to be safe."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,MrsDragon,2,Wed Jun 10 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, keep stuff away from your vag while it's healing!"

Man, I am not in shape! I was almost relieved when my dad brought a hungry M to me so I had to stop jogging haha! Felt good to do even a bit though, and I totally enjoyed checking out my husband while he lifted weight ;) so it'll have to be something I continue doing.   In rash news, things are FINALLY starting to clear up! Her rash almost looks the same as it did before we started trying creams and stuff on it! I can't wait until she's healed and we're back in cloth diapers. I think I'll need to get liners in case we need to use creams to prevent rash, debating between the disposable ones or just making my own reusable ones with microfleece."

InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,razzertto,4,Wed Jun 10 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"Uh oh.  My SIL is 36+1 today, and apparently 100% effaced and starting to dilate.  Her first daughter was born at 38 weeks, and they're worried enough to put her on bedrest.  (With a toddler, how does anyone do that?).  We've never been BFF's, and probably won't (for reference: see any past post in the last couple of years about her), but I'm worried.  Her husband is a Marine, and is training down in New Orleans right now.    Though, we have more in common than I thought.  She's on full bedrest (as full as possible), and yet decided to make two matching taggie blankets for Em+M!  I said thank you, and then yelled at her to get back to the couch.  Edit: I realized we're due at (almost literally) the exact same time.  My doc doesn't want me going past 38 weeks, which puts me at 7/8.  Her due date is 7/7.  These cousins are gonna be suuuuper close."
InfertilityBabies,39aoo7,RositaYouBitch,5,Wed Jun 10 19:22:24 2015 UTC,"Parents are visiting and of course my dad needs to see all the touristy things so we're constantly on the move. I kind of prefer when my in laws come because we mostly just sit around and visit while they dote on Z. But my dad is all go-go-go even though he has a bad leg and doesn't like to walk much. So we'll go somewhere and then he'll spend most of his time sitting down and not seeing whatever it is he demanded to see! Frustrating.  Otherwise...Z is saying two words together now! I hesitate to say she's using two word phrases yet, but she says things like ""fall down"" and ""all done"" and ""more <whatever>"" instead of just saying ""down"" ""done"" or ""more""+pointing/signing. She is picking up words all over the place and pointing everything out to us. She also does ""conversation"" babbling like crazy. It's just really cool to see her developing language."

It's more of a mental tired, I find I just have to push through it and then it's fine"". He is still alive today but barely. I asked him if he'd ever spent an entire day alone with the boys while also growing another human inside of him then dropped the mic and punched him in the balls (in my head)."

InfertilityBabies,398yx6,healthylurker,7,Wed Jun 10 02:57:18 2015 UTC,"In addition to what's already recommended, I've found the belly band to be really helpful. I use it when I leave my regular pants/shorts unbuttoned or zipped but also very useful to hold maternity pants up since they're made for bigger bellies and tend to stretch out throughout the day."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,mrswhiskerson,6,Wed Jun 10 03:45:34 2015 UTC,"I got two pairs of pants at the thrift store - $4.99 each.  I also got a couple of capri pants, yoga pants with the hugh belly top at Ross.  I already had a couple of maxi skirts.  Everybody recommends Old Navy and Traget for budget buys. Motherhood Maternity has well fitting stuff but it's more expensive.  I will be honest.  I was quite pissed when I had to go maternity pants shopping at 10 weeks.  I wasn't ready mentally to make that leap.  I had no choice though as I couldn't button my pants anymore."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,vibeee,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:37:00 2015 UTC,I was also maternity pants shopping at 10 weeks and I felt like a fraud. Everyone else in the store was huge and I was barely showing at all. Plus we hadn't told people yet and I was terrified that someone I knew would see me. It was a bit of an ordeal.
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,MrsDragon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:35:58 2015 UTC,Yup...It didn't agree with me.  I just wasn't ready.  I was actually surprised but how soon I needed new pants. Never heard of needing new pants at 10 weeks!
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,vibeee,4,Wed Jun 10 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Target has decent maternity jeans for like $25. I don't know that they will last me all the way through this pregnancy but they were a life saver when I couldn't button my regular jeans! I also picked up a couple of shirts at motherhood maternity and mixed in some larger t-shirts I had.   Consignment shops/markets or moms/parents groups can be a great resource too. I was asking where to buy maternity clothes locally and one kind lady up and have me her whole maternity wardrobe. It doesn't all work for me, but it was a great start."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,MrsDragon,5,Wed Jun 10 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"Belly band!!  They were most useful before 15 weeks.  I got a 2 pack at Motherhoid for$25 and they are well worth the investment.  At 39+ weeks, I still use it for a pair of regular jeans that were a tad too large before pregnancy (to be fair, I need to adjust all the time, but I'll take that over buying another pair of jeans at this point.  I can wear those jeans with tshirts so ot does limit me.  I did buy a pair of maternity jeans earlier, but I hate them.    Otherwise, I have a lot of stuff from gap maternity, old navy, motherhood (when they have sales)"
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,SJP8,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:35:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have a belly band but I hate it. Maybe im not using it correctly but its uncomfortable and doesnt seem to help much. It still seems obvious that I have my pants unbuttoned esp with the zipper?
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,ky_grown90,2,Wed Jun 10 11:40:08 2015 UTC,"The brand I tried was Bella Band off Amazon, and I felt kind of weird at first but ended up liking them once I was too big to have a choice."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,septicidal,3,Wed Jun 10 12:45:17 2015 UTC,"I found a great dress and shorts at Target that don't look obviously maternity, they are just comfier and less clingy than my non-maternity clothes. I also got a few things for cheap at Old Navy."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,curiouslywanting,3,Wed Jun 10 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"I really like Gap maternity jeans and Old Navy maternity leggings.  I did buy some Gap jeans on eBay for $20.  The big question is what kind of maternity pants style do you like.  I hated the over belly panels so I liked the under belly panels.  My bump was too pointy to be comfortable, but other women love the support from an over belly panel.  Leggings, fold over yoga pants and stretchy knit skirts are the most comfortable.  Maxi dresses and a line dresses are super comfy during the summer."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,effingeffstick,3,Wed Jun 10 07:02:36 2015 UTC,I think you're definitely right about not wanting to buy a ton right now.  My belly size went gangbusters around week 24.  Up until then I was using a hair tie as an extension on my pants. Target has a nice pair of maternity jeans that actually look like regular jeans and are comfy.  :)

InfertilityBabies,398yx6,nucleusaccumbi,3,Wed Jun 10 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"I went shopping at 6 weeks and ended up wearing all the same stuff throughout the duration of my pregnancy- good quality maternity stuff will grow with you!  I really liked Pea in the Pod clothing- it's made of relatively luxurious fabrics and flatter the pregnant body a lot. That being said, it's expensive as hell. I found that my nearby Macy's had a Pea in the Pod section within the store, and had an awesome clearance rack! So I got stuff that retailed for for $100 for like $25. I probably only bought 1 thing at full price.   Also search for a maternity consignment store near you- it's a little more curated than a regular thrift store and can be a goldmine!"
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,ky_grown90,3,Wed Jun 10 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"Just throwing in, Target has some stretchy jersey maxi dresses from the Merona brand that I have worn the heck out of.  They're regular women's, not maternity but the stretchiness makes them versatile. They were $20-25"

InfertilityBabies,398yx6,jaina_jade,2,Wed Jun 10 02:59:14 2015 UTC,I'm about the same as you 14w4d today. I've found that I can get away with a bunch of my shirts still. So I've just ripped my toe in with a pair of maternity pants and will be grabbing more. I'll slowly add shirts but the pants are amazing. So comfortable. I strongly recommend trying on a pair.   As for where I won't comment. I'm Canadian and plus sized.
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,Jamiechurch,2,Wed Jun 10 05:01:27 2015 UTC,"I caved this last weekend and got some knit skirts at Target that were on sale, all have elastic waist bands and super comfy.  Also got a shift dress on clearance a size up from my normal but it's a style that doesn't look ""too big"" and should work for a few months."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,cakegroove,2,Wed Jun 10 13:05:31 2015 UTC,My belly didn't get hard until like 8 months lol!  I kept waiting and waiting..my babe was only 6 lbs on her due date tho.
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,Min_Sedai,2,Wed Jun 10 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"For my previous pregnancy, I really liked Motherhood and Destination Maternity. But I also bought stuff from consignment stores and Ebay. I will be 9 weeks with twins on Friday and while I'm not showing, I'm definitely bloated from the estrogen & progesterone. Also I am on Heparin shots twice daily, which has my stomach bruised and knotted, which really hurts with regular pants. The belly bands are also bothering my stomach so I broke out my maternity pants last week for the simple reason of comfort."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,larabair,2,Wed Jun 10 14:14:04 2015 UTC,"This is a great question . . . we are due on the same date and I am having the exact same problem.  I bought a pair of maternity jeans from Target (below the belly) and a similar-style pair of khakis from Old Navy (for meetings and stuff where I can't wear jeans).  They are great.  I've been in them for two weeks now.  Not sure if they are going to last the whole way through (will I need full panel?) but totally worth the price (like $20 each) for now.  The Target jeans, in particular, have been a lifesaver.  I also have a few elastic band skirts that are still fitting fine.  For shirts, I've been wearing peasant blouse styles (with camis underneath) that were already in my closet."
InfertilityBabies,398yx6,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Wed Jun 10 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"You're in nh, right?  I know there is a Destination Maternity in Nashua and Manchester. Some Macy's locations also carry their stuff. Go and buy one pair of decent jeans, one pair yoga pants, one pair leggings, and one pair light pants. You need to go there so you can try them on for size; I am a med petite in their jeans but a small in everything else, and only found out after trying it all.   If you hit up Nashua also check out buy buy baby.   You won't find much else in central or north nh. Source - that's my hometown.   ETA - I found them a million times more comfy than target or old navy and am still wearing them two months after BB was born, in awesome shape. Shirts are mostly old navy and target with a few DM tanks I got at BBB for cheap."

I've had ER pushed out by 2 days due to slow follicle growth.    I was on an antagonist protocol as well and my typical stim timeframe was 8-10 days.

I just spent way too long trying to assess of the amount of space covered by white out looked like it would fit ""Male Fetus"" or ""Female fetus"" Verdict? It looks too short for either!! haha.  We told my best friend yesterday which was really, really great. It was nice and I've felt so bad not telling htem. Turns out there's a family dinner tonight though, that no one (husband or MIL remembered to tell me). And I""m scared my husband will want to tell then. I don't really like being the centre of attention. I'd so much rather tell people one on one, and not in a place where everyone is staring at me, you know? But getting my husband on side may be hard. Ugh."

Thankfully everything I've had this morning has been of the soft and gentle variety so not a repeat of Saturday night (bruschetta) but it's still frustrating.  I just want to eat

Kitty was quiet as a mouse the whole flight. Pond did great too. The pressure changes didn't seem to bother him but we were able to time his feeds to happen during takeoff and landing so I'm sure that helped. He mostly slept but when he was awake he just looked around. At one point he gave a HUGE smile to the lady across the aisle which was frickin' adorable. We're pretty settled now. Kitty was busy exploring the house all night but seems pretty content. Pond slept ok but is super gassy, poor guy. Now we begin the fun introductions to a whole new group of people!"

Not nearly as bad, but we are finally cold turkey-ing on swaddles (after wussing out before) so there were lots of wake ups last night, and kiddo has been SUPER fussy for the past few days - I think he's teething AGAIN, fuck. And he has managed to scratch my nose and draw blood (so I cut his nails this morning, take that), AND gnaw my right nipple enough that there's a little chunk of skin out. No wonder it hurt so much when he eats on that side. Plus he started a leap today. And its raining.  I'm really hoping tomorrow will be better."
InfertilityBabies,395qjb,mrswhiskerson,2,Tue Jun 9 15:30:27 2015 UTC,"I feel for you. At my 3 hour I puked, peed, and passed out 30 minutes after the drink."
InfertilityBabies,395qjb,Iamagnu,2,Tue Jun 9 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about your test. I know if I'd had that reaction I wouldn't take it again but just do tests at home for however long I needed to. That's actually my plan anyway, if I need the 3-hr test I'm going to opt out. Hope you get back to feeling normal soon.  Other than heading to the farmer's market for the first time this year, I haven't really decided what the plans for my day are. I have some errands in the city, but I dread going in and woke up with a headache so I think I might put those off."
InfertilityBabies,395qjb,MrsDragon,2,Tue Jun 9 15:55:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear you had such a terrible experience at your GD test! If you do have to retake it, I might have your doctor prescribe some zofran for you first. That might mitigate the nausea.  My kid was pooping after every feed, but now it's like she's on a poop strike. She is only pooping once or twice a day, but it's an epic one. Is this normal? I know it some point it's normal for kids to stop pooping so often, but it seems a little early for that..   Also, anybody have recommendations for books I can read on my Kindle app while I'm feeding her? Preference to things that are not super new or super popular right now, so that I can take them out from the library without a wait. I like all sorts of books. Bonus points for really well written stuff!"

I love the Shopaholic series by Sophie Kinsella, actually anything by her is usually light and cute and easy to read. I've been reading the classics lately too. Pride and Prejudice was really good, as was Wuthering heights. I also love The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova was excellent - very similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula. If you want something more literary try Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss."

As long as  your LO is still pooping and not in pain she should be good. If concerned of course say something to the Dr.   As for books if you like mysteries/thrillers Gone Girl, Girl on the train, and Reconstructing Amelia."

You're lucky on this front, my baby is still pooping like crazy all the time. Easily 7 or 8 times a day (at most feedings)."

I suffer from anxiety (I have a good handle on it and am unmedicated) but I don't eat much sugar and have not had soda in years because it tends to make me very agitated. I'm so nervous that I'm going to get all light headed and anxious if I have to do it since it's SO sweet. There's no declining it, right? It's something you have to do?"
InfertilityBabies,395qjb,healthylurker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"No one will compel you to do a 3-hour. Hell, no one can make you do any prenatal care, but it's still usually a good idea. I told my providers from the outset that I have better things to do with my time and insulin than a 3-hour GTT. They said no problem, I can do fingersticks instead. Also, if you fail the 1-hour by enough they can just diagnose you with GD. First line of therapy is simply dietary management for many people."

I am also doing a part time bachelor program and one of my courses had an assignment due on Sunday but I came home late from my trip and thought I would submit it a day late as I thought it was only a 5% penalty. Nope it's a 25% penalty on an assignment worth 20% of my grade. :( Luckily my my grades so far in that course are excellent but wow I'm so disappointed.   Edit: words."

I had my anatomy scan today, which just confirmed the genetic results. We got to see her stretch, suck on her thumb, and punch herself in the face. She also has my feet. It sounds weird that I can tell, but I have long toes except for my pinky toe which is so tiny that I call it my humpback whale toe. You know, because they are practically non-existent...

Today is a nice change of pace. Yesterday I was grumpy and felt like throwing a temper tantrum all day. But I did manage to finally get a post up on my very neglected blog and my husband spoiled me with an awesome dinner, so I started feeling a little better. This morning I managed to actually get out of bed at a reasonable time and my pregnancy hormones have kicked over to aggressively happy.

I'm dealing with shower drama.  My MIL is being VERY WIERD about sending over names to my Mom for who to invite from my husbands side to the shower.  She sent 3 names.  THREE names.  My husband called her and asked why, she said she would send more, she sent 3 more.  She isn't inviting her own mother, a couple of sisters, a TON of cousins or any of her friends... and we can't get her to tell us why.  She says things like ""I know she has her hands full with her kids"" or ""She's having financial issues.""  Everyone had an odd excuse and I've never heard her say stuff like this before.  She's being just bizarre about it and it's frustrating.  She kind of did this with our wedding but we just don't get it.  I'm giving up - if she doesn't want them there then I have no issue telling them it was her fault they weren't invited when they get pissed about being snubbed.  I just wish she would tell us the real reason she doesn't want anyone invited.  It's like she doesn't understand showers or something - you can invite people you know won't attend because it's polite.  I mean, your own mother?!  Argh - so annoyed."

First pole fitness class was a lot of fun, but I guess there's a chance the studio is closing later this month. They're trying to sell the business to someone who owns a crossfit place in town and if they don't they're just shutting down.

Mine flared up three times - after retrieval though we didn't catch it, 3 days after transfer (yay, because I was pregnant with twins!), and again around 9 weeks.   If I remember correctly, your HCG levels stop increasing around 10 weeks and begin to level out over the course of the next few weeks. This is why people feel relief from morning sickness around the beginning of the second trimester and why your positives HPT can get more and more faint.   I had relief around 11 weeks and my bloat started to recede. My belly pics were quite the roller coaster ride, huge then normal then huge them normal then finally a legit baby bump around 13 weeks.   Keep up the normal ohss routine - Gatorade, salty foods, and rest. If your ovaries are as big as mine were, they've gone from walnut-sized to softball-sized and they're dumping fluid into your cavity like no tomorrow. You're oddly dehydrated and your skin is dry but you're full of fluid. Seriously, rest.   Take it easy, eat what you can, and call the doc. They'll want to measure your ovaries again if they haven't recently.   Again, I'm so, so sorry. It's a nasty symptom of a wonderful condition - pregnancy!  ETA that your username made me smile!"
InfertilityBabies,394291,NBPTS,2,Tue Jun 9 02:59:24 2015 UTC,Thank you SO much for this- I'm happy to know I'm not going crazy and that this can happen.
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,shelikescolors,3,Tue Jun 9 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"My OB/GYN has practically forbidden any pregnancy attempt until I'm 18 months postpartum. My original plan was to start trying again around my son's second birthday but I'm not sure at all anymore if we will try for Kid #2. Between some personal issues and my endo going haywire, it just may not be in the cards for me."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,HerVoiceEchoes,3,Tue Jun 9 16:38:02 2015 UTC,My OB said 18 months since I went through an emergency c-section for my first.  I didn't start trying until 23 months.  Partially because I was scared to go through IVF again and didn't know if we were prepared to have a toddler and a newborn.  I was fortunate that my first IVF + PGS worked for #2 and he's a 1 week old newborn now.

InfertilityBabies,3944vs,exilius,2,Wed Jun 10 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"I gave birth in march 2014, my first fs appointment is august 10th. Both of the ladies I cycled with who had live births are pregnant again (one is giving birth in the next 7 days, her first took 7 years to concieve, the other is due in a few months and it will be her 4th child).  From my non-IVF group a number are pregnant again and my fertile friend is delaying ttc so we can 'cycle' together."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,Aventurijn,2,Tue Jun 9 06:27:38 2015 UTC,"I gave birth to my little girl in may 2014, my first appointment with my RE is September this year."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,sroethele,2,Tue Jun 9 12:16:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I gave birth in October 2014. It was a c-section, so we have to wait at least a year before my clinic will let me try again. Furthermore, we can't afford two kids in daycare at the same time and my experience has taught me that I need to work to keep me sane. So we'll probably make an appointment with the professor by the time R turns 2 years old. I'm not in a hurry to have another (I'm 27) and it took us 2 years to get healthy embryos, but we have two embryos frozen, and I'm hopefull that at least one of them will take... (maybe that's naive, but oh well)."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,sroethele,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:02:42 2015 UTC,"I think its safe to say generally the people here wait about 1.5-2years before trying again, plus a few months to a year secondary infertility treatment time before success. Generally."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,futurecompanion11,2,Wed Jun 10 16:40:03 2015 UTC,"We are trying again and our first is 9 months old, because of our age and how long it took us to get him, we definitely wanted to try again quickly."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,Peachmaru,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:05:00 2015 UTC,Are planning going to try naturally first or go directly to the doc?
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,ReindeerPoopRVA,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:41:04 2015 UTC,We went back to RE
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,Peachmaru,2,Wed Jun 10 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"Ideally I would like to try again right away because I'm not sure how our infertility will progress over the years, but I have HG with this pregnancy that basically left me inept to do pretty much anything for 13 weeks and we can't afford to do that again for probably a few more years. I'm 24 and husband is 25 so we do have some time (hopefully)."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,try_new_stuff,2,Tue Jun 9 11:34:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""normal fertile woman."" I know that before finding out I had infertility I wanted to wait 4-5 years between children. Now that I know it may take longer to get pregnant I started trying without the help of an RE when my son was 15 months old. We've been trying for over 6 months so we have secondary infertility now, we will probably go to the RE this summer. So yeah, I guess I'm trying sooner than I normally would if I hadn't had infertility.  When I was in the hospital the midwife stressed that I should not get pregnant within 12 months or it would be considered high risk, and I gave birth vaginally. I heard recently that the CDC recommends waiting 18 months. I found this article as a source, it links to the CDC study which is a pdf. The article says the average wait from birth to the next conception is 2.5 years, so I guess I'm trying sooner than that as well."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,ReindeerPoopRVA,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:09:58 2015 UTC,"Mayo Clinic has some good info on the 12/18 month debate as well. I know you're out of that window, though!"
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,ReindeerPoopRVA,2,Tue Jun 9 13:32:04 2015 UTC,"That pretty much said the same thing that I had read, though I didn't know about the risk at more than 5 years. Hopefully I don't have to think about that."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,HerVoiceEchoes,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"Thank u for the link. I am also going to try again when my baby is 1.5yrs, plus a margin of one year.."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,septicidal,2,Wed Jun 10 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"Well, it took 4.5 years to get pregnant the first round but now that we know what works so hopefully it will not take as long the second time around. I would like to conceive about 15 months after this one is born, but we all know how plans work out with infertility.   Infertility has a way of changing so much about the way we think of ourselves. Instead of ""Oh I'm still young, I have plenty of time"" it is I may be youngish now, but if I want a second baby then I have to get lucky now so that I have time to squeeze a second one in before it becomes riskier. We change our plans to fit the IF schedule"
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,MrsDragon,5,Tue Jun 9 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"My midwife recommended not trying again before 18 months postpartum, so I'm going with that. The Mayo Clinic has some pretty good information which backs this up. Of course infertility complicates things, but my health and the health of my potential future baby are my highest priority."
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,sleepingrozy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:29:36 2015 UTC,"Good plan, when will 18 months be up for your case？"
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,sonirose,0,Wed Jun 10 16:36:35 2015 UTC,Eighteen months is scarily less than two months away for us!
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,nucleusaccumbi,2,Wed Jun 10 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"....holy fuck, you're right. I'm only a week behind you!"
InfertilityBabies,3944vs,slumlord2001,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:57:30 2015 UTC,"My husband and I have touched upon the subject a bit. If I wing up with a vaginal birth and few complications, we will likely start trying again around six months. If I have a c-section we will have to wait a full year. I have already decided that I will never go on hormonal birth control again. It just masks PCOS and doesn't allow for better monitoring of what my body is actually doing."
InfertilityBabies,393ojp,KatiexS,4,Tue Jun 9 01:02:08 2015 UTC,"My first beta was 67 and I was kinda worried because it was a little lower too, but the number doubled correctly and now I'm 22 weeks along. As long as the number doubles in 48 hours I think you're in the clear."
InfertilityBabies,393ojp,futurecompanion11,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Congrats! I'll be stressed until my next beta but I'll try and stay positive, ha!"
InfertilityBabies,393ojp,futurecompanion11,2,Tue Jun 9 01:29:34 2015 UTC,Those first few weeks are so stressful. I googled pretty much everything I could think of and actually convinced myself that this wasn't a viable pregnancy multiple times. It does get better though! Good luck and I will be looking for your update post :)
InfertilityBabies,393ojp,MrsDragon,3,Tue Jun 9 01:34:22 2015 UTC,"Good luck!  I never found out exactly what a ""good"" number was and google is all over the place. I think the key is the upward trend, but perhaps some other people in here will know better?"

InfertilityBabies,393ojp,razzertto,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:28:55 2015 UTC,"At my beta (after a 3-day transfer) my first hcg level was only 22. It made me pretty nervous, because I thought it would be higher. Then it tripled two days later. So the first number doesn't mean as much as the increase during your next draw."

Mine was 55 when I was in the 4th week and then it went to 202, etc etc. Now I'm in my 13th week and all is good so far! Today you are pregnant :) Congrats and best of luck!"

InfertilityBabies,3928f0,chels213,6,Mon Jun 8 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"So the thing is, you may have PTSD, or something like it. When I talk about IF trauma, and NICU trauma, in regards to me, I'm not actually kidding. So if therapy/counselling is an option for you (full disclosure: I love therapy), I'd highly encourage you to consider it - your therapist can help you actually process that trauma.  So that's my big tip - call in the pros. If that's not an option, lots of deep breathing, taking things one day at a time, and distractions to keep yourself busy?  I'm sorry. This sucks, I know. But just because you have ""no reason"" to be terrified, doesn't mean your feelings aren't real. You know what I mean?"
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,pamplemousse2,4,Mon Jun 8 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, yes on PTSD. There is no doubt in my mind that I suffered from antepartum and NICU PTSD. And it lingered for a very long time as I didn't really have time to address those emotional needs. Caring for twins was priority and my PTSD lingered in the background until they turned 1. Then all those anniversaries hit me like a ton of bricks - the day we went into preterm labor, my month in the hospital, the day they were born, the day I was discharged without them, their month in NICU, their discharge day, etc.  All the same fear and worry and excitement and joy and anxiety all showed back up.   I had to sort of mourn the loss of the image of a typical pregnancy and newborn phase. I felt so guilty for their rough start and so cheated at the same time.   Pregnancy, labor, delivery, and newborns are highly emotional and stressful even in the healthiest, most ideal situations. Add in even one complication and some PTSD is a completely normal and understandable result."
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,NBPTS,2,Tue Jun 9 01:05:26 2015 UTC,"<3 I mourn the loss of the newborn phase, too. I had daydreamed about this blissful time home with my baby and husband, and that was NOT AT ALL what I got. I've actually started thinking about having a second already, specifically so I can hopefully do it ""right"" this time. And of course I know in my mind that it wouldn't have been like that anyways, but my heart doesn't listen."
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yes again! We started trying when my twins were 7 months old. We knew it was a long shot. They're now almost 15 months and it hasn't worked yet (shocker). We plan to see the RE when they're two about a FET.   I don't feel like my family is done yet and I desperately want more. But these aren't the only reasons I want a third. I also want to know what it's like to be pregnant without fear (well, I know it won't be totally without fear but, you know what I mean). To be miserable at home during the last trimester rather than the hospital. To go into labor and be excited rather than terrified. To do skin to skin immediately. To try to exclusively breastfeed. To never have to let go or watch my baby get rushed off to NICU.   I may never let this poor hypothetical third child out of my arms!  I want this for you, too."
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,NBPTS,2,Tue Jun 9 02:43:13 2015 UTC,I believe we'll both get there! ♥
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"I went to therapy after my 4th loss and while it helped in the beginning, the therapist started focusing more on my past than my current situation (what I needed work on). I think maybe I should reach out and try to find a therapist that specializes in fertility - I loved it, and the first few sessions really helped me process my emotions.   Yes, I completely get what you mean. I was told this fear was motherhood :)"
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:41:25 2015 UTC,Our therapist specializes in fertility and relationships - she's a really good fit for us.  That's a good way to think of that fear! At least when they're born there's more you can do than just worry. Xox
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,healthylurker,5,Tue Jun 9 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way... and honestly just reading this I thought ""omg she lost it at 15 weeks? That could be me soon!"" I don't know how to get past this fear.. I think it's absolutely normal, especially with what you've been through.   I would think once you start feeling the baby move (which is in a few weeks, right?) it will give you peace of mind.  My husband won't let me rent a doppler (I'm kind of crazy so he thinks I would go nuts with it and he doesn't know if there are implications of using it so regularly). I'm driving myself nuts right now with the same worry and having to wait 1 month between appointments is just SO tough.  Also I keep being told -- worrying won't change a thing. Whether you worry or not, the outcome is the outcome. So try to stay positive, even though I know that's impossible. Hang in there!"
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,ky_grown90,2,Mon Jun 8 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"And my friends have gone through some horrific stuff in their pregnancies too (no details, no need to give us another thing to worry about) and when I get in this funk I just can't let those escape my brain!   I should hopefully start feeling baby move anyday now, but my OB said the way my placenta is I may find it harder to feel anything? I am going to ask her about that at my next appt next Wednesday.  I love the Doppler, and honestly it has helped me a lot. I only allow myself to listen to the baby once a day for about a minute. It's enough to give my peace of mind. I got it from my friend though so I didn't have to rent it/buy it.   You are so right about worrying - it doesn't change anything. I will keep telling myself this. THANKS!"
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,sonirose,3,Tue Jun 9 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"Home dopplers are finicky. I am 37+ weeks and whipped mine out the other day just out of curiosity. You would think I could stick it anywhere and get a strong heartbeat immediately, but no. It still takes finagling and depends largely on baby's position.   FWIW, stories of people losing babies near or at birth still send me into a tizzy. I think it's a natural reaction to hearing about something bad happening to someone you can identify with."
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,MrsDragon,6,Mon Jun 8 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"I have two boys (one from IUI, one from IVF) and many things still send me into a tizzy and down a spiral of worry.  I think it's an unfortunate side effect of  infertility.  Infertility struggles take a long time to heal."
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,shelikescolors,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:28:14 2015 UTC,Well I am glad to know they are finicky! That makes me feel so much better!
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,bandgeek_foreves,3,Tue Jun 9 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"I have been trying to avoid all stories where people lose babies, though sometimes they are unavoidable and they scare the crap out of me everytime. My coping mechanism is distraction and denial. (Not saying it's a good one, just where I am). So I try to stay busy and focus on other things. One nice thing about twins is that they consider us ""high risk"" so we get lots of extra ultrasounds, which are very reassuring.  Does the doppler reading change with position? I know that babies that are either anterior or posterior (I can't remember which) you tend to feel less because of their position, so perhaps the same is true for doppler readings?  If it makes you feel any better, at ~16 weeks we had our first appointment where they tried to find the heartbeats by doppler. Neither the nurse nor the doctor was able to find the heartbeat of the second baby. So we went to the ultrasound and there they both were, wriggling away with nice strong heartbeats. And these are professionals that do this all the time!"
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:43:34 2015 UTC,"I am trying to stay busy as I am also high risk so I can't do much. I can walk and do yoga. Plus, my husband is SUPER protective, so he doesn't even want to take me to the mountains to go fishing or anything (which I am also struggling with his over protectiveness).  I have no clue what position baby is in. I go for my 20w US so hopefully I get some answers then.   I can't imagine what you went through at your 16w appt! This making baby(ies) thing can get pretty scary at times!"
InfertilityBabies,3928f0,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:37:20 2015 UTC,I had the same PTSD :( Just keep yourself busy with things and fun hobbies to keep your mind active doing something else other than overthinking your situation and doing statistics on the decreasing pregnancy loss risks.

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,spankyjubblies,13,Mon Jun 8 17:27:47 2015 UTC,Just checking in. Boys are great. Up to 9ml feedings every 3 hours & off the bili lights. We got to start kangaroo care yesterday and it's the best. Pumping is coming along slowly but surely. I'm exhausted but healing well & getting more mobile by the day.

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,LowOnHope,7,Mon Jun 8 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"Toders scare me. I hear they can smell fear, too.   I'm struggling with feeding my boys. Nursing them or giving them a bottle was so simple. Now we are deep into finger foods and purées and I feel like I give them the same damn thing every few days. I need some ideas for more finger foods.  We eat mostly diced up fruit and a few puffs. They get meat and vegetables in their purées. Maybe I'll back off purées and focus more on finger foods? My boys are 8 months old. Any suggestions?"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,kat_loves_tea,5,Mon Jun 8 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"It's still early but if you wanted to, you can slowly remove some of the veggie options from purées and partially cook them for finger foods. S loves baked chunks of butternut squash still so I make them like baked fries for the whole family. But I'd steam carrots, broccoli crowns, cauliflower, etc. She also loved black beans and roasted corn (still does). So then she'd have like a little purée first to ensure she ate well (maybe some chicken and spinach usually), and I'd put some cut up fruits and veggies on her tray.    Seems so long ago already.. My toddler is so big now. Last night after dinner she just hopped up on the couch next to me and reached in my bowl of grapes like she was ready to snack and watch TV with me. Then when I told her it was bed time, she hopped down, flashed a big smile to clearly distract me while she took my grapes and ran away giggling. Little stinker.."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,LowOnHope,3,Mon Jun 8 14:33:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll have to give all of those a try. They go ape shit over sweet potato and squash so maybe I'll start there.   It sounds like she is turning into quite the little lady. A sneaky adorable grape steeling lady, mind you. ;)"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,kat_loves_tea,2,Mon Jun 8 17:08:08 2015 UTC,Thank you. It goes by so fast! I'm all emotional as I'm packing away winter fleece jammies that don't fit today. So fast!!

You just offer them table food cooked really well and cut into bite sized pieces. We started when he was 6 months old and followed a chart of which foods to introduce based on age. He loves mushrooms, beans and blueberries.  So far the only thing he wont eat is cucumbers"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,2,Mon Jun 8 14:29:44 2015 UTC,He won't eat cucumbers because they are repulsive. Heh.

Add some cumin or thyme or Rosemary for seasoning if you want.  Roast in oven at 400F until tender and soft.  Cool.  Perfect for babies trying out new textures and grasping food if the have the hand skills."

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,LowOnHope,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely try a steaming veggies until they are just shy of mushy. Let's see, our guys don't do dairy yet, do yours? If so you could try tiny pieces of smushier cheese. Also toast is always a winner and with the new recommendations you could put a smidge of peanut butter on there. Avacados are a hit or miss here too."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jun 8 18:29:16 2015 UTC,Props for using the word smushier in a sentence.
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,ThatGreenSolGirl,2,Mon Jun 8 20:52:31 2015 UTC,No dairy here yet either. Peanut butter is a big hit but I haven't tried toast yet. I'm steaming some zucchini now to try. We'll see how it goes!
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,honmamichin,6,Mon Jun 8 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"Had a lovely weekend! Brunch with a friend from undergrad and her lovely family - we have gotten back in touch since having our babies. Turns out they were at our same fertility centre - 3 unexplained miscarriages before her kiddo. I've never had a loss, and my heart really goes out to her. But yay she's got her rainbow baby!  And then I moved a tooooon of mulch. I'm almost done! It is raining and raining and raining here today, so I won't be finishing up today, but that's ok.  Husband and I have decided that this is our forever home... and therefore my mental list of renovations has all of a sudden become a very real thing for me. Hahaha. We're going to have to look at our monies and our priorities... but I'm super excited now."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,5,Mon Jun 8 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"They run around and disregard their parents and they get into EVERYTHING.   Haha oh yes, toddlerhood is absolutely insane. Getting into everything and not listening are 2 things they do best. BUT, they can also give hugs and kisses (at least mine does) so it's a fair trade off :D  Tonight is my first pole fitness class. I'm excited to see what it's all about and hope it becomes my once a week escape from mommyhood."

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,ThatGreenSolGirl,2,Mon Jun 8 15:23:18 2015 UTC,Ahh thanks! I've watched some competitions and the level of strength displayed is extraordinary. Those girls are ripped. I'm looking to strengthen and get my flexibility back and this definitely fits the bill.

Actually, Mr SJP is the one who did most of the work, so I'm really impressed in his ability to put together something that works and actually looks good from Ikea.    Otherwise, just waiting patiently (but less so day by day) for baby.  All I want is for her to come out safely and be healthy."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jun 8 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm glad you got the ikea stuff built already.

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,vibeee,3,Mon Jun 8 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"We've been doing a lot of last-minute getting stuff together for baby stuff as of late.  It's insane.    The RE gave me a due date of 6/15, which is probably close to what it really is, but my OB's due date is 6/12 based on LMP.  So...basically, sometime this weekend?"

I was up for two hours then managed to go back to sleep for almost an hour. No wonder I'm so tired during the day. I wish I could be productive in the morning but I have no desire to be up and about.   We made some progress this weekend on painting the bonus room (only a few rooms left to paint and builder beige will be gone!). Realized we'll need more paint, so I'm off to Sherwin Williams today, thankfully we realized this before their sale ended!"

We cut off more than four inches of length, then she layered the hell out of it. My pony tail is now half the thickness it was. And I have bangs again! I feel human again! Hoping it helps with the hot flashes too.  I'm also doing something very exciting -- filling out paperwork to renew mortgage on the condo (rental unit). Then once that is done we can get our pre-approval to get into a second mortgage so we can buy a townhouse and get out of my in-laws basement! My life has been on hold through trying to sell the condo, giving up and renting it, doing IVF etc. etc. And its been leading to some depression. This is a huge step and I think it will really be a turning point."

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,Blankety_blanks,3,Tue Jun 9 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"After a crazy busy weekend we are having a lazy not leaving the house kinda day. Works well too, because it's a rainy, dreary day.  MIL was visiting the other day and she is starting to get a little pushy about babysitting M. She said ""whenever you start pumping, whenever you're ready, you can leave M with us and go on a date. Like, next month."" She continued and told us how parents are supposed to leave their babies and have a date night by the time the baby is two months. I have no intention of bottle feeding nor leaving M anytime in the foreseeable future. And when I do start pumping it'll just be an emergency stash (like in case I end up in a freak accident and in the hospital or something.)   Even if I was planning on having somebody babysit M, my MIL wouldn't be who I'd choose. Even when visiting, I feel like she ignores M's needs and prioritizes herself. For example, M started rooting and fussing yesterday and I said she was hungry and went to take her and MIL was trying to make me wait so that she could take off M's socks and show off her feet. Sorry lady, you can look at her feet all you want, but I'm not making a newborn baby wait to eat. She also argued with us about how we're dealing with M's rash, trying to say that regular wipes would be better than the cotton cloths and water we're using currently that have also been recommended by all medical professionals we're seen about the rash. I just don't trust her and I also don't understand why the push to babysit. We aren't limiting her access to M at all, she is welcome to visit often and we visit them too. I feel like there's going to have to be an uncomfortable conversation about this soon, ughhh."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,3,Mon Jun 8 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"Whyyyyyyy is it that MILs want to take care of our babies with us out of the house, like RightAway when they're so fresh? And whyyyyy can't they take a hint when you tell them ""Thanks, we'll let you know when we want you to do X"" that you don't want them to do it right now so stop asking!!!!  I totally vote for your husband to have that conversation, and for him to be like ""We really appreciate the offer to babysit, and will definitely consider it when we're ready for that, but I have to tell you that we will not be leaving M until she is at least 6 months old. I just want you to understand our timelines so you don't think we forgot about your kind offer!""  And then leave it at that. And then if she brings it up again, he can be like ""Mom, I really don't want to talk about this until November at least. Thanks for understanding!""  (Also, SO MUCH EASIER to put together scripts for other people than for myself, hahaha.)"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,curiouslywanting,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:06:46 2015 UTC,"Seriously! I don't understand what she wants to do with M that she can't do while I'm around.   That script sounds good, but she'd hear it as ""the second M is six months old we will be dropping her off to be babysat by you."" I've tried saying less blunt stuff like how we're in no rush, but I agree that it's time for my husband to step in with clear boundaries. Luckily he has no problem with that, and the two of us are on the same page with all of this. It'll just be uncomfortable, since she's really not good at respecting when people say no."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, she definitely will be on your doorstep the day M turns 6 months.

I've been hesitant to take Unisom, even though my doctor said it was OK, but I feel like I need to cave to help my sanity.  I'm 30 weeks now, and I know I'm only going to get more uncomfortable as time goes on... may as well do what I can to help myself now."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jun 8 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"Unisom is one of the few A rated meds for pregnant women, iirc. In other words, it's been proven not to harm the babies. Try it and get some sleep! Exhaustion is no good for anyone."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,3,Mon Jun 8 14:34:13 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that you aren't getting any sleep.  Sounds like you should take the unisom if it's an A class drug that is safe for pregnancy.  Hope that you get some restful sleep soon!!!

They wear me out just watching them. :)  This week we have another cervical check (and a peek at the babies!)and I'm going to be talking to my friend who is hosting our shower.   This morning, I'm tired and grumpy and trying to figure out why it seems like everytime I try to share info about our prep for the beans with my mom it feels like an argument. Last night she was expanding on the benefits of them sharing a crib (I had mentioned laying out the nursery)  and insisting that our babies would never choke (I was telling her about the CPR and choking parts of our parenting class). Which WTF. It's exhausting. I know she's excited and wants to help but I can and am doing my own research. I don't need half formed opinions and heresay from her friend's second cousin's whatever. And I'm sure part of it is because I'm tired anyway, but bluh. She's coming out to visit for 2 weeks next month and I'm bracing for impact."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,curiouslywanting,5,Mon Jun 8 14:43:14 2015 UTC,Power struggle? You're becoming the mom and she's not in charge any more and has to learn a new role where her direction is no longer the rule of law.
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jun 8 15:06:06 2015 UTC,I think it's hard for parents to have adult children. My mom has never really learned how to be a mom to us now that we're grown.

I think that's a really hard transition and you are right, that sounds like something she struggles with. I can tell sometimes that she's trying really hard not to say the wrong thing, but I don't think she gets WHY the wrong thing IS the wrong thing, so that makes it hard to avoid.   I also think she really wants to have this ""best friend"" type relationship with me, but that just doesn't work for me. I mean, she's my mom, I love her, but there are just certain things I don't ever want to discuss with her (like our sex lives, just no)."

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe. This has been a recurring circumstance for years, but it gets worse everytime there are changes on the horizion. I think she honestly tries not to interfere/step on toes, but she's just such a ""problem solver"" that if anything even vaugely hints of ""problem"" then she has to jump into solve it and doesn't realize how poorly that can come across. Mix that with some empathy issues (she assumes that my reasons must always be HER reasons and can't imagine any others) and it can be maddening.   The good part is that she lives across the country, so most of the time I only have to deal with one call a week. The downside is I think not having the physcial cues makes it more aggravating.  We all need to settle into a new normal, I'm just trying to take deep breaths until we get there. :/"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,curiouslywanting,2,Tue Jun 9 00:15:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry that your mom wouldn't drop it.  Just an FYI, my mom and I have been butting heads since my son was born 2.5 years ago.  She thinks that she knows better and will unfortunately nag me to death if I don't follow along.  It's hard.  I want her to see her grandchildren, but I don't need the unwanted advice.    I've told her she can make suggestions, but don't expect my husband and I to follow her advice.  She needs to respect the fact that we are the parents.  I keep pointing out to her that our son is happy, growing and thriving.    I've also had to refer her to parenting books so she remembers what it's like to have a toddler.  She and my dad thought that our 2 year old was supposed to follow directions and not meltdown?!  I had to reminder her that it's been 38 years since she's had a toddler."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jun 8 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"Hah, my mom tried to put my kiddo down for a nap (he was like, 4 months old at that point), and I go in to the bedroom, and she'd on the bed, talking to him in a soft voice. Pretty sure he was sitting up, too. I was like ""um, has it been a really long time since you put a baby down for a nap?"" And she was like ""yeah, and I always just nursed you guys to sleep!"" So.... yeah. It was funny because there was NO controversy or unwanted advice, but also, my Mom was like ""yeah I can do that"" and totally no longer had that particular parenting skillset."

She also has Opinions on how things ought to be done. Sometimes I agree, sometimes I don't. But I also understand that a battle plan doesn't survive contact with the enemy and my husband and I may very well find ourselves doing things we never thought we would do because they work for our kids.

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,apanda1084,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:50:15 2015 UTC,"FWIW With all babies but especially with twins you have to do what works for you. If your parents didn't have twins it is going to be very different. As for the cribs, we had our twins in Rock n plays until 4 months when we transitioned them into cribs. They lasted 1 week maybe in the same crib but we had to separate them because they would roll and clobber each other in their sleep. The breaking point was when I woke up to one of my girls screaming cause she was stuck in the crib slats. They now sleep great in their own cribs.  YA for getting to see babies!"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,TigFan15,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you. My parents did not have twins but my mom has ""talked to people"" so apparently she now has opinions. eyeroll   What you are describing is pretty much what we are planning to do, so I'm glad to hear it's worked well for you! The rock n plays get so much love over at r/parentsofmultiples/ that we planned to start with those, probably in our room, and then transition them to cribs around 4 months. Right now we are thinking separate cribs, just to give them room to grow (and thrash if they are wiggly sleepers like I was). If it turns out they prefer one crib, then we can always revise."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,apanda1084,3,Tue Jun 9 02:39:43 2015 UTC,"Toddlers are crazy, but they are just as adorable in their own way.  Mine is hilarious when he's not being defiant.  And I agree that they give the best kisses and hugs.  :)  Week 2 with a newborn!  My boobs are still engorged so I'm trying to figure out how to deal with that, but JP is a lovely newborn.  He's very chill and sweet- so I'm hoping that this lasts.  Our toddler is going to daycare so it's a nice break for us to be able to focus on JP.  My mom is here helping out, but she has a bad cold now so we've had to quarantine her away from JP.  :(  She's been coughing a lot.  I just hope that JP doesn't get sick.  I've been a total handwashing and disinfecting freak at home."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,TigFan15,3,Mon Jun 8 15:44:26 2015 UTC,"My cat is at the vet's this morning, he isn't keeping weight on. He's only 6 and the doc is suspecting hyperthyroid or feline leukemia. I have no clue how or where he would have contracted the leukemia from. I am all kinds of stressed right now. Between the cat and waiting to hear back about a job interview from Friday I'm just ready to climb back in bed to reset this day."

Please keep me posted, I'm sending all of my kitty love your way.  Also, good luck with the job thing!  That's very nerve racking but potentially very exciting."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,TigFan15,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Thyroid is ruled out, they called back with the results on that. The dog's annual skin infection has added $300 to the bill for their checkup. We will see what they tell us when we pick them both up later."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,apanda1084,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm especially sorry for the financial aspect.  I don't want to scare you but I'm going to share my experience if that's ok.  We have 2 cats and found out one had breast cancer in October.  We had the lump removed and 5 rounds of chemo which cured her but in total cost us around $4,000-$5,000.  The other kitty was diagnosed with lung cancer in February and we can't operate on it because it's too far gone but we've done I think 3 or 4 rounds of chemo and lots of tests and xrays.  We're at about $3,500-$4,000 with her.  I don't know how much more we can really take as a hit since I'm not going back to work once the baby is born but these were our first kids so it's hard to make that choice, you know?  Plus the chemo is helping to give her a good quality of life.  Best of luck and I'm serious about keeping me posted.  I'll be thinking about you guys."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:06:25 2015 UTC,Thanks. Vet ruled out all kinds of stuff but we are left with either Lymphoma or slight possibility of IBS. Honestly it is probably lymphoma. :(
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,apanda1084,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:22:30 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry :(  How long do those results take?

I will do all I can to keep his weight up and keep him happy for as long as he is not in physical distress. :( I feel bad that we just won't be able to do anything to help, but I can make sure he has a great life for as long as he is able to keep on going."

InfertilityBabies,390ztn,SJP8,3,Tue Jun 9 00:33:16 2015 UTC,"I have 12 toddlers!! You just have to find the right combination of battle gear, bribes, and (for non-pregnancy) after-hour alcohol!!  As long as your ok letting them be a little nuts now and then, I actually find the 18m-30 month olds to be better behaved and tolerable than the almost-preschoolers!!  My doctor called today (personally!) to see if I'd want to do IV iron transfusions.  I said that I'd rather just try the iron supplements, because they've always worked in the past, but I'd be willing to do another round of bloodwork and if it's still bad, then I'll sign up for anything.  I realized today that when people ask me when my last day of work is, I don't have to give the date anymore.  I can just say ""next Friday.""  That's so scary (and exciting, not going to lie!)"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:13:15 2015 UTC,Good luck with the iron supplementing. Iron always destroys my stomach.  Less than two weeks of work left? Woah. Babies before you know it!
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,PrincessCBHammock,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"Ick, good luck with the iron! Stupid iron levels. It's coz the babies are stealing all your haemoglobin. Nice that your doc called personally though!"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,6,Mon Jun 8 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"Had my first midwife appointment today. At first she seemed a little negative about my being pregnant so quickly (it's higher risk, etc) but then as we spoke I think she warmed up to me.   A few disappointing things: hearing that this pregnancy is higher risk because I had a c section last year, also that there is no chance of vbac (I figured but hearing it stung a bit). I have an US this week though, she gave into my IF anxiety and was really nice about knowing that I needed it to feel better."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,larabair,3,Mon Jun 8 15:29:30 2015 UTC,"I think I need to up my lurker game, this is the first I've read about you being pregnant. So, a belated congratulations. I'm sorry about the c-section, but happy that she warmed up to you!"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,PrincessCBHammock,2,Mon Jun 8 20:51:01 2015 UTC,Ouch on the c-section bit. That sucks. I'm glad that the midwife warmed up to you though.
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,lancealittle,2,Mon Jun 8 16:07:49 2015 UTC,Sorry about having to have another c-section.  How are you feeling otherwise?
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,PrincessCBHammock,2,Mon Jun 8 19:44:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, there's a huge part of me that thinks ""well you won't get that far anyway"" so I guess one day at a time. I feel mehhhh the midwife suggested I might feel worse this time because with IVF you're already on a ton of hormones."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,lancealittle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can predict how this pregnancy will go, even if it was a natural.  how far along are you?  Do they know if its a singleton?  (I think I remember you mentioning that twins run in your family?  I could be mistaken though)."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,tittypuncher,2,Mon Jun 8 22:54:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, that's rough. Is this the same person you had with the twins? Or did you have an OB for them?"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,tittypuncher,2,Mon Jun 8 20:11:13 2015 UTC,"So my place has you meet with a midwife for the first visit, always. I had not met this particular midwife and will see my OB next time."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:33:45 2015 UTC,Oh! I see. Interesting!
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,2,Mon Jun 8 22:24:24 2015 UTC,Same as montanadoodle - I completely missed this! Holy moly! Congrats!
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's crazy isn't it?"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,kat_loves_tea,3,Tue Jun 9 10:22:47 2015 UTC,Did she say why no chance of VBAC? Is it just the tight turnaround time or your hospital policy?
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,tittypuncher,4,Mon Jun 8 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"She said no way, it's a 12 month minimum (from c section to getting pregnant). I also pushed for 3 hours so she said they probably  wouldn't even after a year."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jun 8 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"Well, boo."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,lancealittle,2,Mon Jun 8 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right. This doesn't in any way mean you can't vbac in the future though, your body just needs time to heal!"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,TigFan15,6,Mon Jun 8 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"Dude, toddlers are scary. They run around and disregard their parents and they get into EVERYTHING.   TELL ME ABOUT IT. We were at BIL's on Saturday, he has a pool. It was nuts. At one point the kid walked away from me in the kitchen, and I watched him walk past all of the adults who didn't notice him, even though they were holding the door open, and he just ran straight for the pool! I ran out and caught him just as he was about to fall in, NOT EVEN EXAGGERATING!"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,healthylurker,2,Mon Jun 8 16:50:06 2015 UTC,Toddlers and their self-destructive streak freak me out even more! Traffic scares me!

My uncle (I think? Someone, anyways) fished her out by her overalls, but holy crap. I am so not looking forward to my kiddo being mobile."
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,ky_grown90,2,Mon Jun 8 20:13:10 2015 UTC,I have a whole new appreciation for overalls now.
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,pamplemousse2,3,Mon Jun 8 20:19:38 2015 UTC,Overalls are FANTASTIC for scooping toddlers out of harm's way!
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,Stitch-a-holic,2,Mon Jun 8 21:09:21 2015 UTC,"This should be their new sales campaign. Also, I'm totally gonna need some overalls for baby girl!"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,2,Tue Jun 9 01:18:23 2015 UTC,"Um, yeah, I think my kid will spend his childhood in overalls now. Plus they're so cute!"
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,becabecaful,2,Mon Jun 8 20:58:41 2015 UTC,Right???
InfertilityBabies,390ztn,MrsDragon,2,Tue Jun 9 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"Lol toddlers. Yeah. They're so much fun, though! And honestly, my kid didn't start having tantrums until she was 3. She had an agenda that included messing with every single item within reach, but we're in the screaming fits now at age 4 (they're definitely improving lately, but they're more rage-inducing than from a 20-month-old who truly can't control themselves).  My plan this week includes eating Ethiopian food TWICE -- Tu & Th. Unless I'm still so full from the first time that I can't even do it the second time. I didn't have problems with breathing the first time around, though I did have some pretty nasty rib pain & parasthesias. This time my ribs have been ok but I'm getting really short of breath when I'm gassy or full. Whelp, it'll get me to stuff my face less, so that's something."
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,dutchqueen,9,Sun Jun 7 15:26:05 2015 UTC,I've baked two loaves of bread so far today and have yet a third rising.  Lesson learned: Never sign up to bring homemade bread to a family get together before hearing the head count.  I want a nap
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,HerVoiceEchoes,2,Sun Jun 7 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"Baking bread while sleepy is the worst because it just takes soooo long and there's so much downtime with the rising and the baking, but just not quite long enough to sneak a nap in, eh?"
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,GrammaMo,8,Sun Jun 7 20:24:21 2015 UTC,The daycare we are planning to put Z in is having an open house today! We'll finally figure out how much it costs (they are brand new and don't open for a few more months so it makes sense that they didn't have the info up before)! Praying it will be around the price we're thinking we can afford...
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,honmamichin,2,Sun Jun 7 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that would be so stressful! I hope the open house goes well and you get the information you want/need!"
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,MrsDragon,3,Sun Jun 7 18:45:46 2015 UTC,It went well! Full time care is right at about the max amount we had decided we can afford. :D So now we just have to decide whether we want part time or full time... they both have pros and cons so we'll have to think on that.
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,honmamichin,2,Sun Jun 7 19:27:10 2015 UTC,Whew! :D I'm glad to hear that!

We couldn't afford any childcare on Mr. H's old salary, but with his new position that's changing! I'm really excited to get back to work on my own projects."

InfertilityBabies,38wylz,Iamagnu,7,Sun Jun 7 21:42:34 2015 UTC,It's so hard to get here and post now that baby is here! OMGosh you just don't believe it until it happens! Haha  today's goal is to keep her awake lost of the day. The nights are killers because she wants to be awake all night and I am losing my mind. She's inconsolable and fussy or crying for hours. We are trying to breast feed but have to supplement a lot. She is a hungry baby. I can't wait for our newborn pediatrician appt tomorrow so I can make sure we are doing this right. P. S.  I love her so much.
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,talula79,4,Sun Jun 7 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"Oh momma! Every baby is different but I'd strongly suggest not trying to keep her awake. I think she shouldn't be awake more than an hour or so at a time this early. The more she sleeps the more she'll be able to sleep - don't get her over tired!  I know it's brutal. My twins have reflux and are huge fans of ""the witching hour"" - they fuss every evening. Hang in there! Try white noise, swaddling, side lying nursing, co-sleeping, whatever it takes!"
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,Hopecat,2,Sun Jun 7 19:45:52 2015 UTC,I guess I should be more clear. I just want to keep her alert a little more today. Not really keep her up all day. She sleeps every minute of the day except when eating and even then she'll fall asleep. She screams from 1 am to 4:30ish and there is absolutely no consoling. We have tried everything. We see the pediatrician tomorrow for her first new born check up so hopefully we get some more suggestions.
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,talula79,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:59:45 2015 UTC,Might be worth asking whether she might have her days and nights mixed up.

InfertilityBabies,38wylz,magooey,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Oh man, the newborn/recovery period puts new meaning to the words tired. My husband said it was way worse than boot camp! One tip (and feel free to ignore if you already know this) is to make sure baby is getting lots of sunlight during the day (not direct but open blinds, etc) to help set her body clock. Our bedroom is a bit of a cave cause I need dark to sleep but when she was napping during the day I'd make sure the blinds were open. I had a winter baby so it got dark around 4.30 which was not helpful!   Also if you have a baby who sleeps on you all the time (like mine) I highly recommend baby wearing. Good luck!  Hope the ped visit goes well."
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,ktbell,5,Sun Jun 7 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"I'm getting a hair cut for the first time in close to two years! (Well, two years August). I cut out every conceivable expense when we were saving for IVF, then going through IVF, three weeks of bedrest with a SCH etc. etc. it just never happened. I prioritized everything and everyone over me.   I've been struggling with feeling really depressed lately. Part of it is social isolation -- bedrest combined with not telling people about the pregnancy, combined with 'temporarily' moving into the inlaws basement to save money (one town over, and I say 'temporary' as its been over a year now). Did I mention I don't drive?  So, I thought a hair cut would maybe make me feel human. Something for myself, to make me feel attractive again.... We'll see but I'm really, really lookign forward to it."

InfertilityBabies,38wylz,Bibbityboo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"It is hard to make new friends.  I met a couple of people from reddit who happen to live in my new town but I didn't connect with anybody in the way I used to connect in the past.  I don't know if it's the age or if the infertility made me such an outsider that I don't care for friends the way i used to do.  I also work with people everyday, lots of people and all the time.  I think I also developed some sort of aversion because I'm always talking to people.    I will do my best to go to some new mom meetings, hangouts.  I need a friend or two!"

I'm not quite ready to wear them yet, though my pants are getting tight. But, I never prioritize me, and I've decided this pregnancy is going to be the time that some magical things happen. 1) I'm going to make peace with my body. 2) Since I have to buy new clothes, I'm instilling a rule that I buy ONLY things that make me feel cute. Might make it harder to do, but I think it'll make me feel better."

InfertilityBabies,38wylz,Iamagnu,2,Sun Jun 7 18:30:01 2015 UTC,Hope the outing went smoothly and that the carbs were delicious!

InfertilityBabies,38wylz,kat_loves_tea,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"Have fun at your outing. And when you're ready to nurse in public, it will be ok. I've done it a bunch of times and you're so focused on feeding the baby that someone else's reaction seems so unimportant. And I've never had anyone give me the side-eye or say anything to me."
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,razzertto,5,Sun Jun 7 19:08:25 2015 UTC,Working today.  I have a big event outside by the pool and then a birthday party right after that.  Long afternoon ahead me.  3 more workdays after today and I'm going on my baby moon!  New Mexico here we come!
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,vibeee,6,Sun Jun 7 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm currently sitting in the back of my husbands truck nursing while he's in marshals looking at diaper bags.  Pumping 4 times this whole week has made me engorged. Yeah, no supply issue here. I want to punch that LC in the face. It had calmed down and now I'm back to square 1."
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,messofletters,3,Sun Jun 7 19:09:17 2015 UTC,I hate bad advice from LCs!  Glad your engorgement calmed down.  Sorry that you are back at square one.  I swear after going through this that there has to be a better way to give women breastfeeding advice. They don't consider oversupply as a bad thing and tell you to pump for no reason.  They don't think about anatomical issues like your nipple size versus your baby's mouth size (my issue that caused my blisters).  They don't advocate for the mom's sanity or feelings- just for mom feeding baby/babies with boobs...sorry for ranting off of your post.  This is something that is very fresh for me.  I found the hospital delivery/postpartum nurses gave better advice than the LCs that I saw in the hospital.
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,curiouslywanting,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"The LC we had in the nicu was amazing! The two I've seen through public health have been less so. Strictly going by the book. I understand they're only human and doing their job, but it hasn't been great for my sanity.  They really need to learn that not all cases are going to be textbook. I had insane oversupply initially. He was a tiny, term baby. There's lots of factors that they didn't look into or even ask about. How can they help if they don't even really know anything about our situation?"
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,messofletters,5,Mon Jun 8 10:54:47 2015 UTC,"I did some baby room organizing today which made me feel accomplished :) I also got all of my clothes and my husbands extra clothes sorted out and boxed up.  He's a bit of a pack rat and hates to throw stuff away. He has a bunch of pants that are two or three sizes too small - he refuses to donate them, but hasn't ever fit them in the 6 years I've known him. Ah well - he has a dream he'll make it back to them some day.   In the mean time, we are going out shopping for him today because all his shirts are fraying at the top and he has nothing nice to wear (probably because he hasn't bought anything new in 3 years) and he's going to look for some shorts and pants perhaps too - there's a good sale at his normal go to store, so we will see what we can find!   ALSO  I've posted in a couple places that my anxiety has been really high lately - just so nervous about something going wrong. Unfortunately, reddit often triggers that with so many loss stories out there. I've decided to take the next week to be pretty absent and try and get my thoughts together. Sorry if I'm not around too much! Never fear, I'll be back though :P"

I may be able to go home today, or tomorrow. The plan is still to take our my gall bladder on Wednesday. I spiked a fever yesterday night, so I made my husband stay away with baby. It sucks. At least the hospital is really awesome about supporting my continued pumping. They are also being really good about not giving me anything that is dangerous to transfer through the breast milk.   I think I can official say I have horrible luck. Like, really bad. But at least it's me that is sick and not BabyBoyKat."

InfertilityBabies,38wylz,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sun Jun 7 20:56:25 2015 UTC,So far I am happy with my choice to switch to the Spectra pump.  It could be coincidence but my milk pumped has gone up and it doesn't feel like I'm ripping off my nipples like it did with my old one.  Are there any other ladies here who use the Spectra?  What do you think of it?
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,effingeffstick,2,Sun Jun 7 20:18:18 2015 UTC,I have the Spectra S2 and there is apparently quite the fan club here for it.  Hopefully I will like it too!  only thing that makes me nervous is the replacements/working out the hacks if I want to use Medela parts.
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,SJP8,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yep! I have the S2, too.  I couldn't really justify paying that much more for the S1's battery option.  I haven't tried the Medela hacks yet but so far the pumping motor seems to draw out more milk with less effort and noise than my PISA. Plus, the massage feature seems to start more let downs, which is nice.  Is this the first one you chose or did you move to this one from another model?"
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,effingeffstick,2,Sun Jun 7 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"This is the first one I chose.  Before I did some research, I just assumed I would buy the Medela because thats the standard, but ehen I read about how quiet and efficient the Spectra is (that and it being a closed system theoretically making it easier to clean), I chose to buy the S2.  If breastfeeding works out for me, I'm looking forward to using it...as much as one can look forward to using a breast pump, that is."
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,SJP8,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:27:56 2015 UTC,"True. Yeah, I went with Medela first because I figured the most expensive = the best. Oh well, lesson learned.  :)   I hope breastfeeding works great for you!"
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,effingeffstick,2,Mon Jun 8 12:40:05 2015 UTC,I've got a Spectra! Love it. Good choice!

InfertilityBabies,38wylz,effingeffstick,2,Mon Jun 8 12:36:40 2015 UTC,Is it normal to have lower back cramping at 13 weeks pregnant? Its been achey today and cramps off and on. Should i be worried? I would assume its my uterus growing but who knows..i cant help but think of the 'm' word 😞
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,healthylurker,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:55:59 2015 UTC,My lower back has been achy since the day I got pregnant (probably initially just from stress).  I doubt its anything too strange!  I'm 13 weeks too :-)
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,female_engineer_here,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:58:50 2015 UTC,I've got an oversupply issue - and I'm starting to try to fix it. My boobs are not happy! I'm reducing pump time by 1/3 and trying to breastfeed as much as possible (instead of bottles).   In other news my father in law and brother in law are coming to meet the babies this week. It will be interesting!
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,Hopecat,3,Sun Jun 7 18:26:27 2015 UTC,Total newbie question here: how do you know when there's an oversupply?
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,Iamagnu,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I'm a newbie too! But mainly it's that I've got a chest freezer full of milk after 10 weeks, and adding approx 25 ounces of milk per day to it. I looked at a consumption calculator and it estimated 19-30oz of milk per kid per day until 6 months and that then it'd drop due to introducing foods.  Aside from that, even after I breastfeed I'm still uncomfortable due to my breasts being full. I know I'm walking a fine line of having enough vs having to much, so it's a little scary.  I welcome any suggestions!"
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,Hopecat,2,Sun Jun 7 19:40:34 2015 UTC,I wish I had that problem! Ahh I cannot produce enough. I think it's getting better though.
InfertilityBabies,38wylz,talula79,2,Sun Jun 7 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"Yeeeah,  sometimes it takes a while to get production up. Keep nursing that baby!"
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,connie_knoxville,13,Sat Jun 6 14:21:07 2015 UTC,Everything about this is wonderful.
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,tittypuncher,12,Sat Jun 6 16:44:55 2015 UTC,I am a recipient here.  I didn't give birth yet but it looks like after 7 miscarriages I will finally be able to bring a baby home.  Thank you for what you did.  Without people like you I wouldn't be able to carry a baby and give birth.  I'm really curious how this meeting goes.  I hope you post something afterwards.
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,vibeee,5,Sat Jun 6 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! That must have been a long and hard journey for you, and I'm stoked that you have a result!"
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,july_time,6,Sat Jun 6 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to keep this short, but basically we chose an egg donor who looked a lot like me, but then she turned out to have the cystic fibrosis gene like my husband and we had to choose another. The next woman we chose looked nothing like me but we seemed to have a lot in common.   Meeting was complicated but great. We really hit it off, spent the whole time laughing. I was so grateful to her, and anxious that she come away from meeting us with the idea that we'd be good parents. The complicated part was that for me, this donation (that totally worked) was part of a 3year long horrible story of heartbreak and lost innocence. For her, she was stepping in during the ""resolution"" of the story so she got to be part of the happy piece. Since then we've become incredibly close, it is as bizarre as it sounds, but somehow it all makes sense to us. She feels like my sister in a lot of ways. But we struggled in the beginning to understand one another because she was so young and optimistic and felt so positively about the experience, whereas I'm still working through some sadness about how hard and unprivate it was for us to make a family.   I hope this helps, we are a very unusual case. Feel free to PM me with more questions."
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,talula79,3,Sat Jun 6 18:17:12 2015 UTC,I'm so glad for you that things are going well! I look nothing like the intended parents in my case - different ethnic background plays a major role in that. I was surprised in some ways how well we seemed to click and how excited for them I was - I was prepared for more complexity and sadness but that hasn't come up yet... but now that it's resulted in a pregnancy the stakes are super high if it does. I genuinely just want the best for their family and want our relationship to just support their chosen ideal really. How come you feel unusual?
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,talula79,5,Sat Jun 6 23:49:43 2015 UTC,A friend gave me her eggs when she found out I could not have children. She has been so amazing I will never be able to express my gratitude. My girl was born on June 1st. She will be known as auntie.
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,marieelaine03,3,Sun Jun 7 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"That's really awesome! How did she broach the subject with you? Was it weird having that offer? As I said I know people struggling with infertility but didn't want to offer directly, though they aren't super close to me, and as I'm single with no kids and am more into crazy adventures than family stuff I'm not a person they'd share their infertility problems with in detail.... so I didn't discuss it with them to avoid awkwardness / suggesting it prematurely / getting hopes up if I couldn't / them wanting to say not but feeling obliged to say yes... So many possible pitfalls, with a lot of emotion attached. So I just went and donated, to move that wait list along :)"
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,ThatGreenSolGirl,4,Sun Jun 7 06:10:53 2015 UTC,I was very open with our struggle on social media. I was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure. We went to a baseball game together and she said I'll give you my eggs I don't need them right now. I said I wouldn't know how to accept that kind of gift and let her know what would be involved. Anyway I let her offer one more time to be sure and made us an appointment to make sure it was best for her. I would understand if she changed her mind.
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,ThatGreenSolGirl,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:36:44 2015 UTC,Oh that's really great! What an awesome friend!
InfertilityBabies,38sqlx,becabecaful,5,Mon Jun 8 05:34:46 2015 UTC,Oh wow I have Turner's Syndrome too and have to rely on a donor as well. We're in the process now of doing tests to hopefully do IVF in the next few months.  I live in Canada where donation is altruistic as well. I can't even begin to explain how I felt when a donor offered to do this for us.  I was almost in shock...I couldn't believe someone would be so incredibly nice enough to do this. I'm eternally grateful:)

InfertilityBabies,38sikd,ky_grown90,14,Sat Jun 6 12:58:56 2015 UTC,I got discharged from the hospital this morning. C sections are no joke guys. I don't know how you moms that had sections and went home with babies did it! I'm exhausted and having a hard time & don't even have babies exclusively in my care.   It was so hard to leave the boys but they're doing so well in the NICU. My mom made me a big pot of nutrient rich soup and I'm drinking lots of water and napping. Hopefully all those things combined will help my milk come in soon!
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,spankyjubblies,2,Sat Jun 6 18:00:45 2015 UTC,I hope you recover quickly. Is it far for you to head in every day to see them?

InfertilityBabies,38sikd,pamplemousse2,10,Sat Jun 6 21:42:25 2015 UTC,They're doing well. Still on c-pap but breathing room air & they increased their feedings from 3ml to 4ml every 3 hours. Asher is down to 1 bili-light (he had two) and Sebastian is off the lights completely. I got to change Asher's diaper today and he pooped and peed on me. I cried because I was so happy lol.
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,spankyjubblies,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"Woo! poop and peeeeee!! I'm so glad they're still doing well. Breathe and grow, little ones!"
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,lancealittle,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"That's AWESOME that they're making such concrete progress! Isaac HATED the C-pap; I was really glad when he came off of it (since he was there for persistent o2 requirement, they could do it with the nasal canula). Another huge step for us was when he came out of the isolette. Although of course it never came fast enough... I had to keep telling myself that he wouldn't be 5 years old and still in the NICU. Hang in there, mama - your boys are ROCKING IT!  On the being happy to be pooed on - I totally get that. When we were in the NICU, it was SO emotional any time something ""normal"" happened. I remember one day Isaac had a blowout poop when we were still at the hospital where he was born (where we loved the nurses) and my husband was there to change his diaper. He leaked through his diap, and 2 swaddling blankets. The nurses were impressed. Hubs was so proud. He took pictures and everything. It was just SO FANTASTIC to be doing a usual newborn thing! We were also really excited when he peed out over the side of the bassinet when he was getting his diaper changed, hahaha.  Congratulations on your first anointment! I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. <3"

InfertilityBabies,38sikd,LowOnHope,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:54:35 2015 UTC,Make sure they x ray. Good luck!
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,razzertto,2,Sat Jun 6 21:54:50 2015 UTC,I've been avoiding the dentist...this is a reminder why I need to go...
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,becabecaful,2,Sat Jun 6 14:10:45 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I feel your pain."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,GrammaMo,5,Sat Jun 6 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all your suggestions regarding the bottle yesterday. After a battle of wills, my husband finally got her to take it. I hid in the master while he camped out in the nursery.   Today's battle of wills is being fought over my left breast. She has taken a disliking to it recently and screams when I offer it. Today was a near complete rejection.    I apparently have a very choosy child, I foresee this being interesting as she ages."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,razzertto,3,Sat Jun 6 14:22:24 2015 UTC,Glad you managed to get her on the bottle! I have had some friends have babies go off a specific boob because they have like a crick/muscle pull in their neck and it is uncomfortable for them. So it could be something like that?
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,pamplemousse2,3,Sat Jun 6 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I mentioned to my midwife that M was favouring one side she told me to try different positions because it might not be the boob, but the way she's being held. Sure enough, she only liked football hold on the left but I had to do a different hold on the right."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,bandgeek_foreves,3,Sat Jun 6 19:52:11 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.. hadn't thought of that, but I'll try repositioning her."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,razzertto,2,Sat Jun 6 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"Mine decided he didn't like the right for a few days. I could usually sneak it in the night when he was half asleep, and he got over himself in a few days. The suggestions to change position are really good too."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,RositaYouBitch,4,Sat Jun 6 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"Good morning! I was up nice and early today (can't sleep, I keep waking myself up snoring. HA!) so I went out to the market and had a lovely morning! I got lots of yummy fruits, and some plants for the garden. My parents are coming today to help plant them and get my garden looking nice (it's a bit overrun with the weeds at the moment :P).   It's a beautiful sunny day today - no clouds and not too hot!   I have a super busy week at work next week, so I'm hoping this weekend can be somewhat restful so I'll be full of energy!"
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,razzertto,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"I've been waking my poor husband up with my snoring...I'm often up by 7 or 8 and ready to go though! He hasn't adjusted yet, we used to be lazy bums who slept until 10 or 11 on weekends :)"
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,magooey,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:13:39 2015 UTC,My husband thought it was hilarious that I would wake myself while snoring (I always do). It sucks though because you're tired and want to sleep but the noise is awful.   Have fun in the garden!
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,OrganizedSprinkles,4,Sat Jun 6 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"We have a busy day today. The neighbor's girl is turning 1 so we have to stop by. Then this evening our friends are having a graduation party for their daughter. Both serve as a nice, selfish opportunity for me to see a bunch of people and say goodbye before I leave. I can't believe it's time to go already! I'm sad but also ready. I'm excited about my time at home and I'm even more excited to start our next adventure in Key West!  ETA: wrap question: when I wear Pond in the moby in the hug hold, his head and my chest get so sweaty. I don't think he's overdressed. I just have him in a short sleeved onesie. First, is it ok that he's that warm and second, is there anyway to prevent the sweat? The shirts I'm wearing are low cut for breastfeeding so a higher collar makes sense but that makes BF harder. Thoughts?"
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,pamplemousse2,2,Sat Jun 6 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"I sometimes put a burp cloth in between LL's face and my chest, just so the sweat doesn't make us stick together. As for being warm, the nature of strechy wraps is that they're REALLY HOT. He's fine being warm against you, it actually serves to regulate his temperature.   Key West is beckoning! It's going to be a sticky summer there for sure, but I hope you love it."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,Rudysgoldfish,5,Sat Jun 6 20:12:59 2015 UTC,When did your babies start rolling over? Mine is 5 months and it's still not happening. Is it because I'm a failure with doing tummy time?  KY...only 3 weeks to go?  Eeeeeee!!
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,pamplemousse2,3,Sat Jun 6 18:35:48 2015 UTC,Mine hated tummy time so much he learned to roll to get away from it. And to watch TV.
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,healthylurker,2,Sat Jun 6 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"Eh, Isaac has done it one time each way, and has no interest in rolling over anymore. I wouldn't worry about it."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,rawkfemme,2,Sat Jun 6 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"Mine started at 5 months, sort of, but he is now 6 months and still is really bad at it.  Sometimes he rolls over in the night by mistake and gets stuck, and I have to rescue him."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,healthylurker,4,Sat Jun 6 21:01:47 2015 UTC,"Had a great, romantic evening last night! And today I hit up a bunch of garage sales/free piles and brought home a ton of baby stuff. Most of which the husband will probably object to... which will be fine as I got most of it free anyways!  On the bummer side, we need to replace our tub, and we only have one tub/shower. So that'll suck. It needs to be done ASAP... I'm tempter to just renovate the whole damn bathroom while we're at it.  Also, my child seems to be going through a growth spurt. SO MUCH eating, and his already poor napping has gone to shit. Sigh. Hopefully he'll be done with this in the next day or two!"
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,septicidal,3,Sat Jun 6 18:55:14 2015 UTC,I've shown my 12 week ultrasound pics to a few people and my family keeps commenting on how big the baby's belly is. Now of course I'm googling like crazy and I'm worried. Does this image look normal?The ultrasound tech didn't mention anything.. is it normal for it to be extended like this at this stage? http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll40/healthylurker/b540f698-cc87-4a72-bc35-a081aec2f071_zps6tkvovmp.jpg
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,magical_realist,3,Sat Jun 6 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look abnormal to me, but of course my only experience is looking at my own ultrasounds. It could always be the left arm on top of the belly or a shadow too."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,healthylurker,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:15:47 2015 UTC,thank you for the reassurance!
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,pamplemousse2,3,Sat Jun 6 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty identical to mine, which I was told was textbook normal."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,jaina_jade,2,Sat Jun 6 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"Looks normal to me, according to my own ultrasounds and others I've seen. Even at my last one, around 22 weeks, baby still had a round little belly. I think it's just because they don't have much actual flesh yet, so the newly forming organs have to go somewhere. And even after they're born lots of babies still have a cute little pot bellies."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,KittyL0ver,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:14:29 2015 UTC,thanks for making me feel better!
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,PrincessCBHammock,2,Sat Jun 6 16:16:33 2015 UTC,Looks like what mine looked like.
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,KittyL0ver,2,Sat Jun 6 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"Looks identical to mine and only thing I was told was ""big baby"" and ""healthy little one""."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,PrincessCBHammock,9,Sat Jun 6 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"Today was the first day of swimming lessons.  Little A cried most of the time.  I hope he gets used to it.  He really enjoyed it last summer.  Edit:  In the interest of healing this sub, it would be nice if the downvote trolls would lay off."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,pamplemousse2,5,Sat Jun 6 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"Huh, I wonder why they're targeting you? I get why Titty and I attracted them but I didn't see anything controversial from you."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,KittyL0ver,2,Sat Jun 6 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"I only said one thing in the thread posted over here that I guess made someone mad.  Honestly instead of rehashing this awful week, I'd rather everyone just move on.  We should all be supporting one another, not tearing each other down."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,lancealittle,6,Sat Jun 6 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think everyone has moved on, it just sucks that trolls have been attracted to our little community thanks to the SRD cross-posting."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,GrammaMo,2,Sat Jun 6 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"We've been swimming a couple times with the kidlet and he really likes it. Our neighbours are putting a heater in their pool, and we're invited to go swimming whenever - I can't wait!"
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,rawkfemme,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:44:46 2015 UTC,"We're taking lessons at the Y.  Last year we had lots of fun, so I hope Little A can get over his discomfort and enjoy himself again.  I go there during the week to swim laps as well.  It's nice because they have child care in the mornings, so you drop your child off while you exercise."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,MrsDragon,2,Sat Jun 6 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"On the good side, I peeked at my glucose screen draw yesterday and it seems I passed (against all odds, if you ask me).   In crummier news: I took myself out for coffee and a breakfast burrito before work this morning, and discovered my key in the front seat of my locked car when I was done. Fuck. We only have one key to that car because I've been putting off getting a second made. Double fuck.   So now I'm at work waiting for the locksmith to call me back, then I'll need a ride back to my car while he gets me in. I'm tempted to see how much him making a key would be and just biting the bullet right now."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,GrammaMo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"Congrats on passing the glucose screen! You definitely didn't need another thing to worry about, so I'm happy for you :)"
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,septicidal,2,Sun Jun 7 03:26:40 2015 UTC,Emmett is meeting a ton of extended family today. Hopefully all of his bodily fluids stay in his body and not on aunts/uncles/cousins and he's a happy boy.
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,GrammaMo,2,Sat Jun 6 16:04:03 2015 UTC,"Today is do all the things day. Drop off  household hazardous waste for recycling. Shop for a dining room table. Grab lunch. Take the first of two parenting class sessions. Discuss shower plans with a friend.  Naturally we've gotten a late start and now there is a huge line at the recycling centre (which we've not seen before). Sigh. And my feet have spoken enough that I'm having to wear my tennis shoes, not my cute shoes, and wear them so opened up that I have no laces left to tie. It's a very odd sensation when the top of your feet jiggle.... Whine, birch, moan.  In happier news, I'm getting little baby wiggled every so often and we have another scan next week, so well get to see the little beans again! :D And we should get a little bit of downtime tonight."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,MrsDragon,2,Sat Jun 6 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"Perfect day so far here! M has started smiling recently so the day started with cuddles and big smiles from her. Then we went to a wild foods walk, which was basically a two hour walk through forest trails with the guides identifying various plants. The weather was perfect, sunny but not too hot, I got a bit of exercise and I learned some fun stuff! Best part of all this is that it's my husband who found out about this event in the community newspaper and planned to go! It was awesome to see him get excited and put together a little family excursion.   My husband's parents and siblings are coming for a visit this afternoon/evening and I made a delicious strawberry rhubarb upside down cake to serve them (we're ordering pizza, so I don't have to make a huge dinner) Life is good."
InfertilityBabies,38sikd,septicidal,2,Sat Jun 6 17:11:14 2015 UTC,Can I drool over your strawberry rhubarb upside down cake? One of my goals for my time off this week is to get a ton of rhubarb and local strawberries from the farmer's market.
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,razzertto,22,Fri Jun 5 18:46:54 2015 UTC,"I love you all and I hate that trolls are fucking with some of our members. I may not always agree with all of you, but you're my people.  To whomever crossposted, FUCK YOU. You're causing people lots of pain. No one deserves that, especially if they're here hurting and looking for support.   Also, hugs all around for our hodgepodge family. Kisses too."

InfertilityBabies,38pd59,PrincessCBHammock,6,Fri Jun 5 21:05:17 2015 UTC,So shitty. It should have been able to go unspoken that we don't hold each other up for the ridicule of others. :-(
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,honmamichin,9,Fri Jun 5 21:17:10 2015 UTC,The IF family of subs is one made up of people who either were or still are in pain. You don't go looking for an infertility sub unless you know about infertility.  Making that pain into a spectacle is abhorrent.
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,ThatGreenSolGirl,4,Fri Jun 5 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Ugh the more I think about it, the more I want to throttle whoever it is."
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,HerVoiceEchoes,6,Sat Jun 6 00:25:46 2015 UTC,"When people link us to subredditdrama, members of our sub become victims via PM to trolls...   Wow that is fucking fucked."
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,messofletters,6,Fri Jun 5 19:03:43 2015 UTC,"It really, really is. People are just unbelievably cruel. I can't fathom what would make someone think it was okay to do that sort of thing to anyone. I really can't."
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,larabair,6,Fri Jun 5 19:08:46 2015 UTC,And the PMs are unfathomably mean and aim to cause pain. We hope the person who was doing the posting didn't understand that SRD attracts these kinds of trolls. There's no excuse now.

InfertilityBabies,38pd59,tittypuncher,6,Fri Jun 5 19:06:12 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that when she did it she didn't realize what she was doing to us.
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,apanda1084,5,Fri Jun 5 19:07:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I just went back and realized we lost some folk from all the drama. That is heartbreaking.
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,rawkfemme,3,Fri Jun 5 20:00:51 2015 UTC,It really is :-(
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,rawkfemme,4,Fri Jun 5 20:15:35 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I saw this on /r/infertilitysucks as well.  I felt like this sub has been almost drama-free but I don't want it to be open to that bullshit that was on /r/infertility recently.
InfertilityBabies,38pd59,Zoraptera,3,Fri Jun 5 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"Luckily we have never been posted there, but with the new rule we're trying to keep it that way."
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,Stitch-a-holic,6,Sat Jun 6 01:30:03 2015 UTC,Wow. I'm super impressed that you sent a list but more impressed with your mom's reaction. That was very big of her.   I'm sorry you're in such limbo right now. I'm glad you have a strong support system and I'm hoping only for the best!
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,NBPTS,6,Sat Jun 6 13:06:35 2015 UTC,"I took a gamble, as I knew if I didn't speak up early, I'd end up listening to a lot of well-intentioned thoughts that actually hurt. Resolve had a good list, so I sent it to my family (we're all pretty close). I didn't realize how much my mom took it to heart.  I can't wait to be half as awesome of a mom as she is."
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,revangelfire,4,Sat Jun 6 14:57:18 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you are going through this. For the HCG it doesn't keep steadily climbing, it will slow down and stall at some point and bounce around a bit. So don't stress about that. Also 6 weeks can be too early to see the heartbeat. Never heard of the debris before so I don't have any thoughts on that. I hope your next ultrasound shows better results or at least a clearer picture of what's going on!"
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,pamplemousse2,3,Sat Jun 6 05:39:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like everything I've read about HCG boils down to ""there's a crazy range of normal, and very little of it actually means anything."""
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,magical_realist,6,Sat Jun 6 14:58:50 2015 UTC,"That seems to sum up almost all of pregnancy, from conception. ""probably normal, but could be terrible. Just wait and see. "" It. Sucks."
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,ky_grown90,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"So true. The word ""normal"" is meaningless when it comes to reproduction."
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,ky_grown90,4,Sat Jun 6 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"I think what your mom said (at the end) was really sweet. Most people really don't know what to say, but the fact that she's obviously trying is wonderful.  The holding pattern obviously sucks, and unfortunately I don't know anything about debris so I can't offer any insight there.   But right now you are pregnant, so something went right! That's the positive for now."
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,MrsDragon,3,Sat Jun 6 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"For sure--and I'm trying to tell myself that in and of itself is a big deal, as now we know that I can at least get pregnant, and we've got two more embryos ""on ice"", as my hubs says."
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,curiouslywanting,2,Sat Jun 6 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, sometimes just knowing it CAN happen is half the battle. Best wishes xoxo"
InfertilityBabies,38qwkj,becabecaful,3,Sun Jun 7 12:43:33 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry! It's horrible to be expecting to finally have an answer and then not get one. I hope that you are able to get some clarity this week.
InfertilityBabies,38pdy3,sunlightonwater,3,Fri Jun 5 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Congrats!! The terror doesn't end, but it eases and takes in a different shape as time goes on. Good luck! I hope your pregnancy is smooth sailing."
InfertilityBabies,38pdy3,razzertto,3,Fri Jun 5 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"Congrats! Very similar to my experience timeline and IVF wise (we also only had 1 day 5 embryo to transfer and yay it worked!).

InfertilityBabies,38phcu,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 5 21:08:08 2015 UTC,She took it. I had to hide in the back of the house.

InfertilityBabies,38phcu,ky_grown90,3,Sat Jun 6 17:42:48 2015 UTC,I agree that it is best for your sanity that she takes one. Have you tried any different brands? That's my best advice. And I'm so sorry :(
InfertilityBabies,38phcu,Zoraptera,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you. She ended up taking it. My husband has a very strong will, stronger than a two-month-old's."
InfertilityBabies,38phcu,its_bloody_raw,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:48:52 2015 UTC,Whew!! So glad she managed. You definitely need that freedom!
InfertilityBabies,38phcu,HerVoiceEchoes,3,Sat Jun 6 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"My niece did this to my brother and SIL. We babysat for a couple hours and they left a bottle just in case she'd take it and she took the whole thing.   I think with her parents she knew if she held out she'd get what she wanted but with me it was like ""well I'm hungry and I guess this is my only option."" She faught me for a few minutes but then caved."
InfertilityBabies,38phcu,pamplemousse2,3,Fri Jun 5 21:48:38 2015 UTC,"You may need to leave the house for her to accept the bottle.  My son would refuse the bottle if I was home. Didn't matter if I was upstairs and he was downstairs. If he caught a whiff of my scent or heard me even sneeze, he would reject the bottle and want his momma. He would drink his milk from a bottle but if he knew it was possible, he demanded it fresh from the tap. It made night feedings kind of rough because they were all me but c'est la vie.  If he couldn't sense me, he'd drink from the bottle without issue."

InfertilityBabies,38phcu,pamplemousse2,3,Sat Jun 6 22:12:56 2015 UTC,"He could try holding the bottle so that his fingers hit her face, kind of like boob around a nipple.  Helped with us, but my daughter never really took to a bottle."
InfertilityBabies,38phcu,krodjerz,2,Sat Jun 6 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"Bwahaha, that is awesome! I would never have thought of that!"
InfertilityBabies,38phcu,ReindeerPoopRVA,3,Sat Jun 6 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"We have/are dealing with this with one of my twins. First supposedly babies can smell their mom if they are within 20 feet so you may have to leave the house. Here are some things to try: different bottles, different nipples including flow, different temperatures, warming up the nipple as well as the bottle, using fresh milk, nursing with a shield so they get used to the different feel, feeding before they are hungry and stressed, and trying other vessels like cups, spoons, syringes. I kid you not we have tried it all. She has gotten better using a transition cup and a quicker flow nipple but it is still a work in progress. I also was in a wedding and away for a night and she took a bottle though she was not happy about it. Find someone who is really calm to try it cause stress begets stress. I also found it easier to try outside because the crying was less crazy. It is soooooooo hard when they stop taking a bottle and made me feel even more overwhelmed as a nursing mom then I was to begin with. Patience is the key and also giving yourself permission to have her try the bottle.  Let me know if you want to commiserate or if you find the magic bullet."
InfertilityBabies,38phcu,mrswhiskerson,2,Sat Jun 6 02:36:24 2015 UTC,I had a girlfriend go through this. Just keep trying different kinds until you find one that works. Hopefully you've got some friends that can loan you different ones so you don't have to go out and buy them??
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,mwbysw,3,Fri Jun 5 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"No. We did one round clomid with timed intercourse and one round with IUI. I had poor reactions with clomid (I already have bipolar disorder) despite some great looking follicles. We elected to try a round of injectibles and IUI, which was successful."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,larabair,2,Fri Jun 5 21:47:06 2015 UTC,I don't have bipolar but have situational depression and some minor anxiety. My brain will not shut up and I'm overanalyzing everything. Ugh.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,larabair,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:19:14 2015 UTC,Are you medicated? Don't go off your meds - or clomid's effects might be much worse.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,larabair,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:39:23 2015 UTC,Not for a long time.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,MrsDragon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:12:45 2015 UTC,OK - well then - please make sure you are seeing someone or have someone keeping a close eye on your mental state.  Clomid can really mess with your head sometimes.  I had no issues with injectibles.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,H0neyBr0wn,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:27:59 2015 UTC,Thank you. Will do.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,H0neyBr0wn,2,Sat Jun 6 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"We tried Femera first, for 6 months with no result other than me feeling like crap for a couple of days every month. At that point we were referred to a specialist, who put us on Clomid in conjunction with IUIs. We did one IUI with no Clomid and 3 more with. Again, the only result was feeling like crap for a couple of days each month. We then went with IVF, which is what finally worked.   Hopefully it works better for you! Good luck! :D  ETA: I see you are asking about HSGs, I had one done about 3 months before we started any meds. I had not heard that it was supposed to improve results. As part of our IVF treatment, they did put small scratches/biopsies of my uterine, which is supposed to promote implantation."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Fri Jun 5 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It took 4 cycles on Clomid.  We would do one cycle on it and then one off, alternating until we got it.  So altogether, 8 cycles which ended up being a year and some change."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,WhateverYouSay1084,2,Fri Jun 5 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, a whole other year. How come you alternated cycles?"
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,fuzzywuzzypenguin,2,Fri Jun 5 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"The side effects were too much for me to handle constantly, so we would alternate so I could keep my sanity. lol."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,fuzzywuzzypenguin,2,Fri Jun 5 22:54:32 2015 UTC,That's totally understandable.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,messofletters,2,Fri Jun 5 23:09:48 2015 UTC,"I did Clomid for four cycles (max 150mg) and Femara for four cycles (max 15mg) before my ob/gyn sent me to a reproductive endocrinologist. Our first cycle with Follistim/Ovidrel trigger plus IUI was successful. I think it depends on what's going on with your body. For me, I had such weak ovulation that Clomid and Femara weren't strong enough to push my body to grow that egg to maturity. A lowish dose of Follistim was just what I needed to get those eggs mature enough to fertilize. I hope Clomid does it for you!"
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,honmamichin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:56:42 2015 UTC,I see. My OB said that my ovulation is okay but she thinks Clomid will make it better and produce more follicles. I had one that showed on the ultrasound and my 7dpo progesterone was 9.9.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,honmamichin,2,Fri Jun 5 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"That's good then! Hopefully that's all it takes. If money is not a concern or you have good insurance coverage, you could also ask for a trigger shot like Ovidrel to guarantee ovulation."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,lancealittle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:21:19 2015 UTC,Yeah.. I think past Clomid or similar drugs insurance doesn't cover it.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,Peachmaru,2,Fri Jun 5 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"2 cycles! I also took estrogen because I already had a thin lining, and did progesterone suppositories.   Hope it works for you!"
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,Sweetmusic_01,2,Fri Jun 5 22:35:37 2015 UTC,Only two! Apparently my lining and progesterone are good. Did you get an HSG beforehand?
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,donnamatrix79,2,Sat Jun 6 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yes I had an HSG. It's supposed to give a small fertility boost the first few months afterwards! I have Luteal Phase Defect (chronic low progesterone) as well as PCOS and hypothyroidism, so I had a lot of strikes against me. My RE only gave me a 10% chance of success with 4 rounds of Clomid, he was sure I would have to do multiple rounds of IVF and even then wasn't too hopeful--but I got very lucky."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,reidiate,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:13:48 2015 UTC,That's what I've heard about HSG. I think if these rounds of Clomid don't work I'll ask my OB if she can order one before moving on to other things. My hunch is that she thinks everything is fine since it all came back good but you never know.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,revangelfire,2,Sat Jun 6 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"We did maybe 12 cycles? Too many to count. I did conceive on 200mg and metformin and progesterone through the first try.  I can't remember how many cycles because there were breaks in between, but we got pregnant 4 times and only 1 resulted in a live birth."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,GrammaMo,2,Fri Jun 5 23:41:15 2015 UTC,Yes. I took Clomid and prometrium (micronized progesterone) and got pregnant on my second cycle. Good luck!
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,rawkfemme,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:59:52 2015 UTC,Thank you! Did you have an HSG before taking the Clomid?
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,rawkfemme,2,Sat Jun 6 00:27:52 2015 UTC,Nope!
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,MrsDragon,2,Sat Jun 6 00:45:47 2015 UTC,"As far as I know I was ovulating fine and only needed help because we were using frozen donor sperm (queer family). I technically got pregnant on my first clomid-IUI round for this kid, but it was basically a chemical. Then I did 5 more unsuccessful ones (the last one being letrozole) before we switched to IVF. I also had 2 unsuccessful rounds of clomid the first time around, but we conceived our daughter unmedicated with home insemination, so go figure."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,ReindeerPoopRVA,2,Sat Jun 6 00:33:20 2015 UTC,Yes. I had been taking metformin for almost 2 years and got pregnant on my first clomid cycle. Are you being monitored by an RE?
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,female_engineer_here,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:43:12 2015 UTC,No I haven't been referred yet.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,missintent,2,Sat Jun 6 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"Just a little background, I have irregular cycles, pcos, and hypothyroidism.  There were 5 cycles in which I took Clomid/IUI.  The first cycle was just to figure out what dose I had to take, ended up that 150mg made things work. The RE mentioned people with pcos tend to be Clomid resistant.  On the third cycle I got pregnant, but miscarried at 8 weeks.  Cycle 5 led to my current pregnancy. I see in the other responses you asked about an HSG. I had one done at a different RE's office a year before I switched REs. Just a bit of warning higher doses of Clomid can thin your lining.   I wish you good luck and no side effects with Clomid."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,missintent,2,Sat Jun 6 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"Third cycle took, my baby is nearly six months old now. :)  Side effects sucked. I was basically insane for four months (needed progesterone to start bleeding at all, which also made me nuts.)  It wasn't fun and I'm so glad the third cycle took."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,attackflamingo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:32:12 2015 UTC,On my third day of the first cycle and I've had some crazy emotions (better today because I ran) and hot flashes. These I can deal with.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,sunlightonwater,2,Sat Jun 6 18:16:00 2015 UTC,No I did not get pregnant on clomid. Yes I tried 5 times. I got pregnant on injectables first go.
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,montanadoodle,2,Sat Jun 6 04:53:14 2015 UTC,"We tried only once with an IUI but we knew it would be a long shot as our issues are MFI related. Our chances were still so slim and it failed we moved onto IVF and I am now pregnant after the second FET. I did do an HSG prior and for me it was crazy uncomfortable plus I had a bad reaction to the antibiotics. Not everyone has as bad of an experience. The ""fertility boost"" that supposedly comes afterwards is just rumors. There is no proof. I wish you all the best but I would not count an HSG as a form of treatment as it is not... It's really only meant to be diagnostic."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,boobercal,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"For sure about the HSG. I mainly want it to see if my tubes are blocked, because then it would be pointless to continue with any other meds."
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,TigFan15,2,Sat Jun 6 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"I have pcos and don't ovulate or even really get periods without medication (130+ day long cycles)  My first cycle of clomid (50mg dosage) I had one good sized follicle and my monitoring ultrasound and blood work later showed that ovulated but didn't get pregnant, which I still considered somewhat of a success! Second try, a few months later, showed three good-sized follicles and I did successfully conceive (only one baby too, thankfully!)   Clomid worked awesome for me and I'm so grateful for it. I had very little side effects (like a hot flash once, and that was it) and was even in a great mood the whole time I was on it. I hope that it works just as well for you!"
InfertilityBabies,38pqty,TigFan15,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:27:13 2015 UTC,I was looking at the stats about multiples.. A little concerned since my ultrasound showed one follicle and that I ovulated and husband's SA is great. My doc wants to see me have a stronger ovulation though.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,LowOnHope,14,Fri Jun 5 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"I'm heartbroken for our members who are suffering. It's so unfair.   Today I'm thankful for all the weird, funny noises Pond makes. When he nurses he makes these sweet little sighs, he grunts, he giggles in his sleep, and my favorite is this little hoot he makes that has me calling him Little Goose all the time."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,RositaYouBitch,5,Fri Jun 5 14:09:34 2015 UTC,This. My heart just sank reading all the horrible updates. This has been a sad week for the sub.   I'm just without words.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,hamandcheez,2,Fri Jun 5 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"Hehe goose noises! D makes little snorts, like a piggy when he cries!"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:21:42 2015 UTC,BB does that when he's hungry.  I call him Snortermer McGee.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,larabair,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:49:59 2015 UTC,Haha we just call him snortypants.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"He also does what we refer to as his ""monkey cry"" when he's hungry. He sounds like a sad little monkey unless you wait too long then he goes full banshee"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,RositaYouBitch,2,Fri Jun 5 15:27:50 2015 UTC,"A hoot! Too cute! (haha, I'm a poet.)  Isaac used to make these teeny baby dinosaur noises when he was smaller. I LOVE baby noises!"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 5 15:13:57 2015 UTC,Mine cries with a nice vibrato. We call her the mountain goat.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,Iamagnu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha. We need to get a thread going of babies making all these noises. Of course, they probably wouldn't do them on command"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,RositaYouBitch,8,Fri Jun 5 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"I am thankful for the discomfort, pressure, and general body pain that come in late pregnancy. It's all I could have ever hoped for to be given this miracle little boy. I appreciate every moment, even when I complain!  ETA: I have a date! If baby boy hasn't decided to make his entrance between now and June 25th, I will be induced!!! (Dr doesn't want me to go overdue bc of the GD)"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,ky_grown90,3,Fri Jun 5 14:20:21 2015 UTC,Those last few weeks are a real doozy! You're so close!
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,ky_grown90,3,Fri Jun 5 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you, the reminders help! I found out today that if I don't go into labor on my own before then, my Dr will induce me on the 25th! Having a date makes it so much more real! Ahhhhhhh"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,SJP8,2,Fri Jun 5 15:24:31 2015 UTC,Ditto!  We're almost there!
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,GrammaMo,2,Fri Jun 5 14:36:47 2015 UTC,You are going to have a baby before the end of this month!! Awesome!
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:18:32 2015 UTC,Woah! How do you feel about that date?
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,ky_grown90,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:49:19 2015 UTC,Is equal parts excited and terrified an acceptable answer? ;)
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:29:16 2015 UTC,Absolutely! Seems like a really reasonable answer to me! ;D
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,nucleusaccumbi,6,Fri Jun 5 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"I am just feeling so lucky today to have my beautiful healthy sweet hilarious little girl.   Also, I just found out that with my work schedule I could finish this job in November, allowing us to do an FET right away in late November. Or I could go through December and wait until January. Many things to consider...  Also part of me doesn't even want to try this, knowing we got so damn lucky with #1- how can our luck hold out?"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 5 12:40:45 2015 UTC,I know how you feel.  We got doubly lucky on our first go so I'm afraid to tempt fate again.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,TigFan15,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I know. I'm definitely not ready to get back into treatment and risk the heartache again."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,5,Fri Jun 5 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"What a sad day on this sub - lots of hardship going around.  I'm feeling lucky for every kick this little on has for me.  Yesterday was rough, lots of growing pains that scared me and she wasn't moving much, but she has given me a couple of good kicks today and I can be very thankful for every single one of them.  I'm also thankful for every single one of you for keeping me sane during this crazy experience we call pregnancy."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,Bibbityboo,6,Fri Jun 5 12:54:03 2015 UTC,"I had a realization yesterday. Since Dillon stopped growing at 34 weeks, but was delivered at 38, I think the doctors are looking at his growth on an average curve. He's not a preemie so they can't judge him based on that, but he's definitely too small to really be on the average scale.  He's 8lbs 20 inches. That's still less than some of your guys kids at birth and he's almost 12 weeks old! None of the doctors are taking this into account, and force feeding him is making him visibly cranky and uncomfortable. Why would I need to stretch out his stomach? He's a happy baby otherwise! the LC said you can see his ribs and that's why she was concerned. But I don't see them. Am I in denial? All my maternal instincts feel like they're being tested and stress level in the house since Monday has skyrocketed."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,5,Fri Jun 5 14:13:25 2015 UTC,side comment: He's a super cutie!
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,traveler5678,5,Fri Jun 5 15:58:31 2015 UTC,I had a lot of convincing to do to get that pink diaper. But it really is his colour.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,razzertto,2,Fri Jun 5 16:01:47 2015 UTC,He really does look amazing in it!
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,larabair,5,Fri Jun 5 22:44:31 2015 UTC,"Mess, I can't see his ribs. I think he looks pretty great."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,3,Fri Jun 5 16:06:39 2015 UTC,What do they say when you bring this up? If he stopped growing at 34 weeks then of course he'll be on the low end!  There's at least four weeks there which he wasn't able to catch up with expected growth!  I'm wondering if there's a specialist you can get involved but am not sure where to start.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,kat_loves_tea,3,Fri Jun 5 14:59:06 2015 UTC,"The thought hit me after our appt with the pediatrician yesterday. However he was not nearly as concerned as the people at public health, and I understand why. They need to cover themselves, but no one really asked about gestation or how my pregnancy went, they strictly looked at his age, weight and chart.  The ped knows about everything else and just said try feeding him more if he'll take it, and maybe address his tongue tie again. He said supply was there but the demand was not."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,3,Fri Jun 5 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"Well, what is his weight percentile if you adjust it by six weeks from his birthday? Does that give you a seemingly more accurate number? Sophia was the same. They ended up prescribing us a baby scale to weigh before and after feedings to ensure she was getting enough. As long as she ate enough, and had enough wet/dirty diapers, we'd go in for weigh ins and they just charted it until her growth was a bit higher on the chart (a few months). Maybe that's an option?"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,kat_loves_tea,2,Fri Jun 5 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"That's a good question! I have no idea how the percentiles work, but the LC told me he's in the negatives right now. I wonder what it would be if we adjusted.  However, from last Friday to yesterday he was 7lb8oz and went to 8lbs and a bit. He's clearly gaining, and I'm wondering if that 6 week weigh in was recorded wrong or what because there is zero chance he only gained 2 oz in the 4 weeks from that appointment to his vaccinations that caused this whole mess."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,2,Fri Jun 5 15:11:26 2015 UTC,Quite possible. We've had a wrong weight recorded and I pushed for a second reading and it was much better.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 5 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"It was so long ago that there's no way, but I distinctly remember leaving that appointment so happy because it was a huge jump in 3 weeks!  It must have been too good to be true."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,3,Fri Jun 5 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"So... I can, like, see the outline of his ribcage a little bit, is that what she's talking about? Especially just below his sternum. But it's definitely not like I can SEE HIS RIBS or anything. He looks fine. Not rolly polly, but maybe he just needs some time to catch up!  I definitely think that feeding him to the point of being uncomfortable is a bad idea."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see that, and he was giggling and doing great big sighs on the table. But I'm fat and you can see my ribs when I inhale big too.  Ugh I know i sound like I'm making excuses. But the LC isn't the one being told to feed him beyond the point of being full, or has to deal with his crankiness after the fact either."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,messofletters,2,Fri Jun 5 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, well add that to the mix, and I would DEFINITELY not say you can ""see his ribs""!  No, she's not. Some LCs are just not going to give good advice, like any other profession. I would totally be going with my instinct on this one. My instinct would probably also include frequent weigh-ins (which I did do with Isaac when we were concerned about his weight), but a cranky baby is no good for anyone! Hang in there, mama."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,slumlord2001,2,Fri Jun 5 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"I'm no doctor but I don't see his ribs. With that being said, I supplemented and was able to stop supplementing within a few months. In hindsight I don't think my babies really needed it but I don't think it hurt anything either. At the time I was right where you are and the stress was palpable in our house!   I hope he continues to thrive, he looks like a happy dude!"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,fuzzywuzzypenguin,2,Fri Jun 5 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"I don't mind supplementing at all, but I know he's full. If he takes a bottle afterward he either spits up a lot or he is so cranky, when normally he's just sleepy or content after feeding. I like him better happy."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,PrincessCBHammock,2,Fri Jun 5 14:35:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misread your post! Sleepy and happy is so much better than uncomfortable and crabby! Sounds like your instincts are right."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,talula79,2,Fri Jun 5 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"He looks fine to me, although obviously not a chunky baby. My baby was 8.5 lbs when she was 20 inches, so it seems like he's doing okay as far as height/weight (do babies have BMIs?) goes. I would definitely point out the lack of growth from 34-38 weeks though, since that would make a difference."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,traveler5678,2,Fri Jun 5 16:32:19 2015 UTC,"I don't see his ribs, he looks good to me! I looked up G's stats, when she was 21.5"" long she weighed 8lbs 13oz. I think that's about the same ratio? I had preeclampsia which affected her growth, she was much smaller at birth than predicted. She's still on the small side but is growing and is healthy. So I'm used to looking at a small baby and he looks normal to me...but of course I'm not a doctor."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,larabair,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:53:39 2015 UTC,Where are his ribs I don't see them? That's pretty similar to what my Baby A looked like.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,4,Fri Jun 5 16:14:24 2015 UTC,"My medela pump always sounds like it is telling me things. Right job it's saying Let it out, let it out! Haha my husband hears messages in it also."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,ky_grown90,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, I am really excited to break out my pump!  How are you and your little one doing?"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,3,Fri Jun 5 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, reading these posts while holding BB asleep in my lap brings all the feels. :(  I spent all Wednesday and Thursday crying after meeting with the daycare director. She wanted us to start sleep training him NOW (he just turned two months), said me wearing him in a wrap was not a good thing (implying it spoils him), when we mentioned he sleeps with white noise implies that wasn't a good plan, and said they will not use glass bottles unless they are completely covered by plastic but then said she had never seen one so we would have to use plastic (I found one and ordered it so poo to that.)  I did try letting him cry for three minutes while in the crib but it broke me. He is way too young for that.   I didn't love this place early on but thought I was being silly, but after talking with Mr B, my mom, and my therapist realized despite putting down a non-refundable deposit this isn't going to work. So I get to spend the last bit of my leave frantically looking for a new option, which in our area tends to be very difficult. Fortunately mom and Mr B's sister both work in education and have July and August off and are willing to help take care of him during the day, so we have some flexibility. I am still so worried. But at least after deciding we aren't leaving him there I stopped crying all the time."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,ky_grown90,5,Fri Jun 5 13:10:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, sweetie. That's really hard. I would be running far, far away from that care provider, too - that's WAY too young to sleep train, and you CAN'T spoil a baby that small!   Good job going with your gut. I'm sure you'll find something else."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,5,Fri Jun 5 15:15:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for reminding about babies not being able to be spoiled. It's just not possible until at least a year. If anyone wants to argue that, they're crazy and I'll bury them in research :)  ETA: And then I will nicely walk away!"

InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,TigFan15,4,Fri Jun 5 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Aww, I'm always so sad when I see posts about daycares sucking.  Speaking as someone who works in one, our policy would NEVER force an infant to a specific schedule.  From infant through the end of toddlers, they eat when they're hungry and sleep when they're tired.  Not until Preschool do we ask them to, kinda, ""conform"" to group norms.   I know that we can not spend all day with a child in a wrap, but never ever would we tell a parent they can't.  And as far as the white noise, most place use music at naptime (and during play), and heck, I use a white noise machine with my older kids!!  (I can MAYBE understand the glass bottle thing...if it ever broke, there could be issues, but STILL).  Push for your rights, or tell them they can suck it.  I'm sorry you have to deal with this :("
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,MrsDragon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:44:49 2015 UTC,Part of why I posted was so you and the other folks here who have worked in child care or education could tell me if I was nuts or not. If we were further south I would so being BB to your program! We are just going to find a new one.   I can see so many FTMs going along and not questioning - I nearly did but crying for 48 hours was a definite sign something did not compute. Maybe they are fine with older kids but I do not want my infant there.
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,septicidal,2,Fri Jun 5 19:28:32 2015 UTC,NOT NUTS! :)
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,ky_grown90,3,Fri Jun 5 19:38:32 2015 UTC,How nice that you'll have family close enough to do that for you.  When I was in college I lived 30 minutes from my brother and used to watch my nephew every Friday.  I cherish those memories. I wish I could have done it with all of his kids but I moved across the country after I graduated and missed a lot.  I hope you have lots of luck in your search!
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,septicidal,3,Fri Jun 5 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"Sleep training at two months?! I'm so glad you have family able to give thou the time you need to find a new daycare. It's one thing to be upset because you have to be apart from your baby (totally natural), it's another to be upset because he's not getting the kind of care you want. Good luck with the search!"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,larabair,3,Fri Jun 5 13:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm torn about whether I will go back to work, but I can't find anything that seems decent for under $600-650 a week (which comes out to roughly equal to my take-home pay, so I would essentially be working 40 hour weeks for zero dollars). Stuff like this is terrifying me. :-/"

If we do an in-home day care we are looking at $1200 a month but if we go with a center the options range from $1700 - 3500, and then you have to add on to get full day coverage.  We are just starting the hunt and right now I'm as torn as Sept on it, why spend that much time away from baby and home when it comes out to zero net."

I'm looking at it as not putting my career on hold.  But if it doesn't work out, then eff it, I'll be a SAHM. Our area is SO GODDAMN EXPENSIVE.  ETA edited wrong post"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,GrammaMo,2,Fri Jun 5 14:48:10 2015 UTC,"Even if we find a cheaper option that seems good, since me not working drops us down a tax bracket, the difference in income will be only a few thousand (if that). We also don't want to wait very long before trying to have a second. I just worry that it will be hard to get back into the workforce later if I take a break, but I suppose I could transition from part time to full time and get back in that way.  I'm just worried I will go crazy if I am home alone with a baby all day."

InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,razzertto,3,Fri Jun 5 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"Sleep training at 2 months old? That's crazy. R was 4 months when he went to daycare fulltime and he was never forced on a schedule. They always tried to make him nap after every 2 hours awake, but they never forced him. They were allowed (by me) to let him cry for max. 5 minutes, but if he would not go to sleep, they would take him out of the crib and wait half an hour and try again. CIO is really not okay with babies that young.   How nice of your family though, but I'm sorry that it's only a temporary solution. I hope that you find a better place for him soon!"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,nucleusaccumbi,3,Fri Jun 5 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm really happy you followed your intuition and are finding a new daycare. I was cringing and getting upset reading what you said about that centre. When I worked with infants, who were usually significantly older too, I was happy to wear them in a wrap if the parent provided it, I rocked them to sleep on their own schedule and some of them were even in cloth diapers! It's so upsetting to hear about childcare providers who obviously have no idea about child development (spoiling and sleep training a 2 month old, wtf?!) Daycare should be a loving, nurturing environment that promotes healthy development and I really hope you find one that does that for you and BB."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,larabair,3,Fri Jun 5 14:33:35 2015 UTC,"You hear lots of caution and horror stories about in-home care options (and of course some with good reason!), but there are some terrific ones out there. Our daughter's in-home ""preschool"" has babies up through 5 and 6 year-olds who come after school, and the adults who work there think nothing of strapping on a baby for as long as they need it. Our friend's 1-year-old was fearful when she started there, and the main teacher wore her in an Ergo for, like, 2 months until she was comfortable in the setting. They are totally happy with cloth diapers and glass bottles, too. There are people out there who will not be so rigid with their rules! But you do have to be really comfortable with the setting and people. Best of luck as you find something . . ."
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,nucleusaccumbi,3,Fri Jun 5 15:01:41 2015 UTC,"Wrapping your baby is not spoiling him. It's exactly what he needs, closeness and comfort from his momma. And sleep training at two months? Nooooo... Too early.   You do what feels right in your gut."

InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,pamplemousse2,2,Fri Jun 5 13:14:11 2015 UTC,"awww larabair that sounds so annoying and hard- the crying was well-deserved. I too wouldn't be able to go by those rules.   We found a small home daycare that matched our philosophies very well. They are less regulated than bigger places, and often not as sparkling clean, but we really love our provider, and most importantly, so does baby. Best of luck!"
InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,GrammaMo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:23:50 2015 UTC,We're close enough in that it's harder to find small in-home ones; I found one which I sort of liked but not enough to jump on it.  So I have a sneaking suspicion we'll be doing the big area chain for short term and hoping we can get an alternative eventually.

InfertilityBabies,38nsp5,dutchqueen,3,Fri Jun 5 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"I think I might have actually hurt something in my ribs.  Nothing major I have to assume, but holy cow, the last 3 hours have been very different than the last handful of weeks.  Before it was just a heavy pressure/ache kind of pain.  Getting worse as time goes on, but tolerable if I stand up, push her out of the way, or ice/heat it. Then about 3 hours ago, it started to hurt. Like, sharp pain with each inhale, in the same spot each time.  Pressing on it, even lightly takes my breath away.  Sitting, standing, moving, doesn't matter.  And, oddly, being on my hands and knees, which is the one position that always made everything better, actually hurts MORE.  And she's still moving, so I'm not even sure there's a body part in there right now.    About 3 weeks to go...I can do this.  Lots of ice, lots of heat, lots of rest.  (I'd take deep breaths, but not right now!)  Downing ice water while also ice packing right now.  Tylenol may be necessary.  I still manage to be in good spirits though.  Life is weird <3  Edit: crap, I just dropped my crochet hook on the floor...might as well be lost forever now.  Well, this blanket is scrapped.  I really liked it too :(  Edit2: 3 hours later:  just placed my first ever call to OB after-hours/on-call.  Achievement unlocked, grr.  Waiting to hear back from the doc on-call before I go over to ER and/or L&D.  It's gotten not-better."

Dr thought they would be in this week. I called yesterday morning and they said they would call me when they come in.  I'm contemplating calling them again this afternoon. Is that overkill?

On a happier note, last night I wanted to get some measurements so we could work on the nursery layout, but was lacking the physical energy. So my husband not only measured everything, but he graphed it in excel. It was adorable! Sadly, I realized that I was right, with the layout of the room and the size of the cribs, there is no way to put the cribs next to each other. :( I wanted the boys to be able to interact, but the best we'll be able to do is have them on opposite walls facing each other."

InfertilityBabies,38nn6i,petite_chou,5,Fri Jun 5 11:33:10 2015 UTC,"Good for your doctor for sending you to the MFM out of an abundance of caution. Although it really sucks that your placenta doesn't seem to be working as well as it should, it's fantastic that she looks good developmentally. In all honesty, she'll probably gain weight faster once she's out, and she'll have the best care! Best wishes to you both."
InfertilityBabies,38nn6i,ky_grown90,4,Fri Jun 5 11:55:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a lot to take in. I didn't even think this was possible, in a way you are incredibly lucky that she seems developmentally fine. Your girl seems to be a little fighter. Maybe try and get acces to some preemie mums you can speak to online or IRL, so you feel a bit more prepared for the early arrival?"
InfertilityBabies,38nn6i,beaReddy,2,Fri Jun 5 13:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. This too. At least you have a heads up, that others often to not get, but caring for a premie is much more complex than just your average baby. Getting a leg up somewhere may help you feel more confident and in control."

It was overwhelming at first but they are both doing really well now.  We are here for you if you need anything!"

Just take it one day at a time.  That's what helped me after my son was diagnosed with a lung lesion at the anatomy scan.  Keep us updated!"
