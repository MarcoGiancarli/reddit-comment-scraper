TheDarkTower,3e4okj,SkoldpaddaCommala,9,Tue Jul 21 22:51:12 2015 UTC,I can ask Robin Furth if you want. She'll probably know.

TheDarkTower,3e4okj,Grim_Squirrel,4,Wed Jul 22 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"Throughout the series of books, comics, and Concordance, we are given different descriptions of the placement of the Guardians and their neighbors. All of these images have had to go by Robin Furth before being printed. One of them is actually hand drawn by her.  I sorta mentioned this a while back here with one image I found in a comic. I thought it may signify that just about EVERYTHING can change when Roland begins a new cycle. But it just seems a bit strange to be seeing it change throughout the same comic series as well as in the concordance.  What do you guys think: conspiracy or continuity mistakes?"
TheDarkTower,3e4okj,ACOTPH,4,Tue Jul 21 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"I want to make the argument that the beasts are more nebulous then we make them out to be, that they are radically alien constructs which the primitive beings that they over see can only ""interpret"" them as massive forms of legendary power, similar to the environment.  Example, the massive bear is found in a forest. If the beam ended in a savanna, would that same form be interpreted as a mighty lion?  just musing as a fan."

TheDarkTower,3e5jif,canned_salmon,2,Wed Jul 22 03:03:04 2015 UTC,"This is by far my favorite book in the series.  I've never done a re-read yet, but when I inevitably do, it will be with the goal and motivation of reaching book 4.  Something so special about the story, the pacing and hell, even the romance.    Say thankya, Sai King."

I will stand true!  I've heard the series goes to some pretty weird places, but I love King when he gets weird. Can't wait to reach the tower! Loving Father Callahan in Wolves."

TheDarkTower,3dz4ii,Nowin,5,Tue Jul 21 09:53:56 2015 UTC,Now try the audiobook versions. So very good. Or just re-read the series.
TheDarkTower,3dz4ii,dohrk,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:02 2015 UTC,I've listened to about half the series on audiobook (lots of road trips in the last 4 years). Very good!

So, imagine how awesome it was when Sai King announced that he had written another Dark Tower book! Words cannot express the joy I felt reuniting with my ka tet (still whole, do ya) and joining them once more on the Path of the Beam. So if you haven't read WTtK yet, I would definitely recommend it.  I'm sure you're feeling complex emotions delah, I know I was upon completion ; however, I am presently on Book 7... my 4th reread of the series and as always it just as fun to take the journey again.   Congrats, Fellow Tower Junkie. Long days and pleasant nights, sai."
TheDarkTower,3dz4ii,SandstoneD,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't read it yet. Perhaps I should read that before I start in on The Gunslinger again. These characters are so close to my heart, I'm glad someone else understands.   Twice the number to you, sai!"

I've read The Stand and It (and The Shining but not sure if that ties in), should I just jump in now?"
TheDarkTower,3dz4ii,bhafc22,5,Mon Jul 20 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"I read the series without any background knowledge of the other books that have references to The Dark Tower and I don't feel like I missed any big plot points.

TheDarkTower,3dz4ii,SuperLo-Fi,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:53 2015 UTC,"As long as he reads it before Wolves of the Calla, I think he'll be fine to start to the series. He can get the first few in and then read Salem's Lot before WotC."

TheDarkTower,3dz84x,desternee,13,Mon Jul 20 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's a sort of reset each time he goes through the door. I think he's got his fingers back and is the same age as he started and everything, except that each time he goes through he finds essentially another piece of the puzzle that gets him closer to once and for all stopping the cycle and truly saving the world(s) and I think the horn of Eld may be the final piece, or at least I'd like to hope it is. I like the idea of it being his 19th trip through, I'd never thought of that before, it would be a cool little detail to add into personal canon."
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,drummingdude21,4,Mon Jul 20 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"My husband agrees with you, that the horn is the final piece to get him through the cycle. Or perhaps he's going to keep going through it until he doesn't have any regrets and ""get's it right"" for lack of better words.  Thanks for your thoughts! Long days, pleasant nights."
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,TheKolbrin,2,Mon Jul 20 21:24:31 2015 UTC,And the main lesson to 'getting it right' is that the people - his Ka Tet - are more important than reaching the Tower.
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,drummingdude21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:55:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah ""getting it right"" is sort of the same train of thought I had. He was going through constantly making it more and more perfect until finally he does everything right. Thankee-sai"
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,GrampasGuitars777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also though it was the 19th time and because of the symbolism throughout the story, I hoped it would be the last for the Gunslinger."
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,guywoodman7,9,Tue Jul 21 11:33:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a single Roland, same as there isn't a single Jake, Eddie, Susannah or any other character. And with that, I think each time Roland ""goes through"" the door at the top of the tower, things are NOT actually being reset. But instead, we are following a different Roland, one who may have walked the path to the desert just a little bit different than the one we witnessed.   To illustrate this, I always felt that the Tower and each of these versions of Roland are best represented by a dandelion.   So as we all know, the Tower is a nexus amongst worlds. So in this visual representation, the tower is the nucleus of this dandelion and  each of the whisps that are attached to the nucleus is another world/timeline/version of Roland.   Then there is the stem of the dandelion, which is what the Tower is attached to, and ultimately something much greater. I like to think of it as the Prim.   Even cooler, notice how each whisp or strand coming out of the nucleus of the dandelion has multiple frawnds coming out of them at the very ends?  Well those are the beams. Each timeline/world has its own set of beams that are all ultimately attached to the one and only Tower. And they're all happening at the same time, all the time. Time does not exist. Nor is Roland's path a straight line. It's many instances of lines that all lead to the same destination.   I could go on and on but that the jist of what I'm getting at."
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,Hypnyp,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:20 2015 UTC,Wow. I really like this! Very cool. Thanks for sharing!
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,82kets,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"That would mean the view shifts from the Roland (A) we know to a different Roland (B), leaving us to wonder what happens to A, no? The way you described the multiverse seems to be a tasking job for Roland across all iterations. If one of the Dandelion stems gets infected by CK then it's Game Over man."
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,KHanson25,8,Tue Jul 21 01:36:16 2015 UTC,"I'm on a reread right now and one thing that I noticed is when they are on the Kansas turnpike Roland just ""knows"" to put the bullets in his ears. There's a few more times this happens and it's always passed off as intuition but it could be the part of him that remembers his former times through the cycle."
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,SkoldpaddaCommala,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:16 2015 UTC,I also like that. Thankee. :)
TheDarkTower,3dz84x,Allurex,5,Tue Jul 21 00:21:28 2015 UTC,"My theory is that this next trip is in deed the magic number. Maybe the next path to the tower (21) is but that is not the point. My theory is that when Roland finally reached the tower and left the loop he journeyed to our world and decided to tell his tale.   Roland, now finally done with his quest to save the tower, his world and all the rest using a branch of the Tet Corporation to tell the story of how he saved everyone from the the worlds going Todash.  I just think its odd that Stephen King shares the same name as Steven Deschain, descendant of Arthur Eld and who could be called ""Dinh"" or maybe in a different context, the KING of Gilead."

Enjoy this tale, for Topeka will be waiting for you at the end of it, focus on the journey more than the destination.  That may not help you now, but you are getting to know your Dinh and it greatly informs him in the books you have read and will read."

TheDarkTower,3dxg29,JakeofNewYork,24,Mon Jul 20 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly wizard and glass was my favourite book in the series, probably my favourite book of all time. Definitely worth pushing through and seeing what shaped Roland into the man he becomes."
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,cheekymusician,4,Mon Jul 20 09:53:16 2015 UTC,Yup...my favorite book ever.

TheDarkTower,3dxg29,bhafc22,12,Mon Jul 20 22:37:31 2015 UTC,"In hindsight one of the best books I ever read, I'm actually going through the series again now and I'm on book 4 as well. I desperately wanted to get back to Topeka, especially as they're currently in the world of The Stand which was my first King book, but WG is actually brilliant. The love story is told well and I cant say anything more without spoilers, but do try to enjoy it."
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,Newton_Pulsifer,8,Mon Jul 20 10:46:05 2015 UTC,You're already 300 pages in just keep pushing through. A lot of people say it's their favorite and a lot say it's their least favorite. It all depends on whether you like to see the back story or see the story move along more. Either way it's a huge part of the story and you need to know what happens. You'll be back with the  Ka-tet before long.
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,mmmmpork,9,Mon Jul 20 10:09:36 2015 UTC,"Just like any other very long King book, there is a HUUUUUUUUGE build up that takes forever to read, but then BAM BAM BAM action like crazy.  The kind of action that will make you stand up & shout at the book while you read it. The kind of action that gets your blood up & makes you wild to reread it.  Just an FYI, get ready to settle in for some more long days (& pleasant nights) of reading when you get into Wolves of the Calla and in the final book also. There are a lot of parts that (IMO) drag out & don't actually relate directly to the journey to the tower. Don't let that discourage you though. The story is beautiful & it goes where it goes. Just follow it & enjoy the trip.  I look at books like this.... If I need to know how it ends, I'll read the last 10 pages. If I want to know the story, I read the whole book."
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,toweryogi,5,Mon Jul 20 11:54:25 2015 UTC,"Wizard and Glass was my least favorite book in the series (for the record, Drawing of the Three is my favorite). However, the book is very important. It pulls together lots of elements, and there are callbacks to it in later books. You get to know what makes Roland tick. AND if you decide to reread, some things that didn't quite make sense in earlier books have new meaning. Keep on keeping on - you will be glad you did."
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,manamachine,3,Mon Jul 20 14:16:17 2015 UTC,Are you me?

TheDarkTower,3dxg29,Chefca,5,Tue Jul 21 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"Keep moving through it friend, it's a love story and I can understand how that's boring but you'll be rewarded with some great action and insight into the life of a (The!) gunslinger towards the end."
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,Sammoewel,5,Mon Jul 20 10:31:05 2015 UTC,"Take your time to go through the tale, it's one of the best things I've ever read. Forget about the 'current' events in Topeka, dive in Rolands past and enjoy it ;)  By the way, there will be quite some references to this story, later on. So it's always better to understand everything!"
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,PullYaselfTogethaMan,4,Mon Jul 20 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"This one was probably my favorite of the Dark Tower books. I feel that it rooted the series to a reality more than the others did and it felt more comfortable to read than the others. I enjoyed Cuthbert and Alain. I enjoyed the feeling of reading a superb mix of a Grimm fairy tale and a western (which the whole series boasts to a certain degree, but this is exemplified in WaG). If I could give you a tip: enjoy this break because the rest of the series comes and goes fast and with a fury and you might find yourself reminiscing back to the warmth and near-normalcy of Mejis."
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,rottinguy,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:08 2015 UTC,One of Roland's defining characteristics is his ability to tell a story.
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,jonnyta,3,Mon Jul 20 13:25:53 2015 UTC,Out of all the dark tower book. It's my favorite.
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,FunkMast3r,3,Mon Jul 20 13:38:07 2015 UTC,This book made me cry and feel great grief in a time where I was least empathic. Its sai kings best book that he has ever made.

TheDarkTower,3dxg29,tmbridge,3,Mon Jul 20 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"WaG is my favorite of the series.  At first, all I could think of was getting back to the story but WaG gives such insight into Roland and his past.  Stick with it."
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,Canadamatt2230,3,Mon Jul 20 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"This, as an interruption to the action as a first read through, I can understand why WaG gets some hate, but on any secondary readthroughs, this book is absolutely the best of the bunch.

TheDarkTower,3dxg29,nighttown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:08 2015 UTC,After waiting my entire youth between the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass I was so irate that most of the book was a flashback that I did not enjoy it. Not till rereading it before the last three came out did I realize what a beautifully crafted story this is and maybe Kings best book ever.
TheDarkTower,3dxg29,Rakuall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:42 2015 UTC,"I can't say it's my favorite, that honor probably goes to 2, or 3, or 5, or the first half of 7 (all 7.5 are so darn good), But on second read it was definitely a highlight of the series. It's a great story, once you're past the the 'bah! History' mindset. My first read I was annoyed by it, and wanted to get back to the modern characters, so was impatient the entire time I was reading of Cuthbert and co.  Try to enjoy it, and if nothing else, book 5 is back to awesome modern characters being awesome. Read #2 will go better."

TheDarkTower,3dv3ey,gallolala,9,Sun Jul 19 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is, each floor of the Tower is another multiverse, a new level of Beams, and each Beam direction is a parallel reality--a different ""slice"" of that floor's reality. It's like a stack of pies, with the Dark Tower spearing straight down through them.  Or, if you will, a stack of turtles.  Turtles all the way down."
TheDarkTower,3dv3ey,AuthorSAHunt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:21:59 2015 UTC,So does that mean Mid-world is the center of King's universe? If so would a gunslinger have trouble with a being like IT? or Mother?
TheDarkTower,3dv3ey,jefferyffe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:36:10 2015 UTC,"This is how I imagine it:  I believe that Roland's world is the key world, where the tower exists in its natural form. Why? Because it's Sai King's world, the one that all the others connect to.  I picture the multiverse as an infinate sphere. Imagine that you are the tower. If you look right it's going to look one way, but very different than if you look left, or up, or down. But if you look slightly right, it's not going to change much, but it is different."

Or atleast I understood it so."

TheDarkTower,3dvob9,SirJumbles,3,Sun Jul 19 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"Well I'll say that if your find it boring, stop reading. But clearly you are so invested to have read up too the last book, might as well finish."
TheDarkTower,3dvob9,Waas507,2,Mon Jul 20 01:57:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't find any book boring, some might be 'slow' though. If you're 200 pages in book VII, go on! Things will start moving soon ;)"
TheDarkTower,3dvob9,Sammoewel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:29:39 2015 UTC,"Finish it, Sai Ungg. You'll be glad you did.   No book made me as invested as ""Wizard and Glass"" but it all was worthwhile and left me with a huge hangover."
TheDarkTower,3dvob9,starista,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"I found Wolves of The Calla to be a bit boring sometimes (excepted for Callahan's story & the todash), but IMO Song of Susannah was ok, At this point I just finished the last book and I'd tell you to keep reading, as the more you approach the end of the journey, the better it gets"
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,ScotchAndLeather,25,Thu Jul 16 23:55:42 2015 UTC,Definitely read Drawing of the three. It's one of my favorite books of all time. I did find the first one a bit slow but there are more colorful characters in the second who will stick around as main characters for the long haul. Also much of it takes place in more familiar settings with more relateable scenarios so it doesn't feel as alien. If after book 2 you're not sold on the series I can understand giving up but I think you'll enjoy it much more
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,ghostroyale,6,Fri Jul 17 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear - does the writing style change much? The foreword seemed to indicate it might, and that was one of my chief issues. I've never read any other Stephen King so I don't really know what to expect."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,dohrk,10,Fri Jul 17 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like the first book is written in a detached manner. I am always stunned at how long we go without learning he has a name. From the second book on, their is a more intimate, involved style to the writing. I agree that the second book is most definitely worth a shot. If you don't like it, no worries."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,ghostroyale,3,Fri Jul 17 01:46:06 2015 UTC,"It changes somewhat. One thing is that a lot of it is told as if our world is alien to roland. So part of the fun is seeing his interpretation of common aspects of our culture, and his attempts at pronouncing certain words."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,SuperBeastJ,3,Fri Jul 17 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"It changes and gets better. I had a big problem with the writing in The Gunslinger, and it took me a long time to pick up book two. As soon as I did I read the entire series back to back. I absolutely love Drawing of the Three. Do it!"
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,iRonin,2,Fri Jul 17 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"I either re-read or re-listen (audiobook) to the series once every 1.5-2 years, and frequently will skip the Gunsliger for the same reasons you've mentioned. It truly is ""The Drawing of the Three"" where the quest for the Tower really picks up steam.   If you finish Book 2 and still feel the same, it may just not be your thing. But I doubt you'll feel anything other than the exhilaration of your new addiction. Long days and pleasant nights."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,benallen73,6,Sun Jul 19 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"If it helps your decision, The Drawing of the Three is many a fan's favorite volume, and while it doesn't hold throughout the series, huge chunks of it take place in ""our"" world, so it's less ""fantasy"". This may be a decent enough anchor to get you more vested in the characters and lore to tempt you into the other volumes as well."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,Valarauco,6,Fri Jul 17 00:13:57 2015 UTC,"Gunslinger is a very old book ('82), and even if you read the revised edition ('03), it's still stylistically quite different from the rest of the series. It's very linear and dry. You don't get that many chances to glimpse into the very few characters' motives and depth, and you're pretty much stuck with Roland's rather stark point of view all through it. It's also made up from several shorter stories published earlier, so it kinda stands out that way.  I sympathise though, I also had a hard time following the book, specially when under the mountain and the ending, it was definitely hard to keep track (haha, pun intended), but Drawing of the Three takes off mere hours after it and it's a real nail-biter. It also introduces some new main characters that switch up the narrative, and puts the plot through very interesting scenarios that give light to many of Roland's traits, habits, and driving impulses.  Additionally, if you're a fan of King's universe (The Stand, It, Salem's Lot, Insomnia, etc.), you'll definitely find your love for the series in the next books.  After reading through them, there's a chill waiting for you when you read the first sentence of The Gunslinger once again."

TheDarkTower,3dkeku,Gunslinger_,5,Fri Jul 17 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"The Gunslinger is definitely the least enjoyable, at least your first time through. The later books are much more engaging."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,Jerimiah,2,Fri Jul 17 00:49:03 2015 UTC,"Every time someone tells me they're thinking of trying this series (after finding out how big a fan I am), I always tell them to at least read through the first two books, because The Gunslinger is SO different in tone and style. The series really picks up in book 2."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,jlsubl04,2,Fri Jul 17 01:49:01 2015 UTC,I had this same problem! Stay invested and keep your head up. It gets much better.
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,tobiasvl,2,Fri Jul 17 08:38:57 2015 UTC,"Gunslinger was by far the hardest book I've ever made myself finish, if that makes sense. My brother raved to me for years about this series and when I finally buckled down to read it, it was like pulling teeth to get through the first book.   I tried to keep an open mind after taking over a month to finish the first book. I dove right into drawing of the three.....and finished it in 16 hours. I could not put it down!   I promise you. It is worth it to continue. If nothing else, just read this. Make up your mind for sure after giving the second book a go."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,Squish6669,2,Fri Jul 17 10:31:29 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, keep going.  Your sentiment is actually surprisingly common! There was a post like this just the other day too, and I know plenty of people who felt the same way.   Makes me wonder how many people out there didn't make it past the first book :("
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,blumpkincarving,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:53:51 2015 UTC,"I've read the first one three times and it is a bit slow but once you get more involved after the gunslinger, each book gets better and better. Drawing was my favorite until I read wasteland and then it was wolves of the calla. So give them a chance. I do feel drawing of the three is a little rough to start but it's worth it to keep going."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,shredler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:56:53 2015 UTC,"For me at least, the very ending of The Gunslinger was the best part, I really didn't enjoy the first 90%, and realistically I didn't care for King's style either, too much detail not enough action or content.   I decided to read book two purely based on the strength of the finale of book one.  It was worlds different and it was fantastic. For me Book two really eliminated any question about the rest of the series going unfinished. I'm on book 6 of my second read through and don't regret a thing"
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,Lujors,2,Fri Jul 17 03:00:01 2015 UTC,"Same here. It took me forever to get to the end, but when I did and read their palaver, fuck. That slingshotted me through the rest of the series."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,randomlygen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:43:47 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't remember my exact feelings on Gunslinger after first readthrough. Now I read it as the ""quiet before the storm,"" but it also changes your perspective to reread it after completing the series. I guess you can try to see it as being affected by Roland's single-mindedness & the monotony as being a contrast to the crazy adventure that follows...."
TheDarkTower,3dkeku,AZZTASTIC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:21:15 2015 UTC,I only got through book 1 because my husband told me to stick with it. 5-10 pages into book 2 and I was hooked!  Think of book 1 as the foundation to the series proper.

(I'll admit, the cover art caught my eye)  I tore through ~150 pages in the 2 days before I left (which is fairly fast for me).  The strange world you see in book 3 is completely different than the dust bowl of book 1, and it really gave me the 'oomph' to make it through the series.  If I judged the series based on the first book, I wouldn't have made it through and I wouldn't be here.  Sounds like you'll just have to trust that it gets better.  Good luck!"

TheDarkTower,3czkve,jayz93j,8,Sun Jul 12 06:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. I thought it was a post-nuclear novel and the Dark Tower could have been some sort of pre-war device or structure."

The Stand had the trash man (correct me if I'm wrong on that).  He was transporting a nuke or a massive explosive.  The events of The Stand probably wasn't an isolated event. Flagg is quite powerful and on a different level of The Tower, he could easily have spread his influence farther and got an army of crazed people and ended the world."
TheDarkTower,3czkve,TheOneCalledGump,14,Sun Jul 12 17:52:02 2015 UTC,I thought that it was post apocalyptic by like 1000 years and the world had reverted to the wild west with magic everywhere.

It's designed to fit as an interlude, both because you want to start off with Roland already as a grown man and not have a full understanding of his past and what's made him the way he is, and because you won't be as invested in the characters of it without them being alluded to in reminiscence and built up from earlier parts of the story."

It's basically a reference book for the series that keeps track of characters, timelines, maps, events, etc. King liked it so much he decided to have it published.  Volume 1 covers books 1-4, and is pretty much what King used for reference when writing books 5-7. Volume 2 covers books 5-7. The ""Complete"" edition combines both Volumes into a single one and covers books 1-7.

TheDarkTower,3c7qzf,Godofallu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:45:06 2015 UTC,Fassbender is older now than when Eastwood first played the man with no name. I think he can do gritty if that's what the part called for.

TheDarkTower,3btyub,manamachine,6,Thu Jul 2 05:38:17 2015 UTC,I think it would really hold more weight as an ending if it is held off until the second reading.

TheDarkTower,3btyub,ughalready,9,Thu Jul 2 12:46:05 2015 UTC,My dad made the same decision and I told him that I totally respected that. I think that personally either ending is totally valid and it just depends on your choice
TheDarkTower,3btyub,drummingdude21,8,Thu Jul 2 06:23:19 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what do you think the coda might hold? I'd love to hear your theory."
TheDarkTower,3btyub,quinnly,8,Thu Jul 2 04:36:07 2015 UTC,I think it holds maybe a little as to what Roland might find in the tower itself. Maybe tie up some of the looser ends of the story. Sai King told me as much before I stopped reading :)
TheDarkTower,3btyub,frankdamedic,7,Thu Jul 2 05:13:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, But go into detail, what do you think happend ?"
TheDarkTower,3btyub,ellohir,37,Thu Jul 2 06:00:15 2015 UTC,"This is the second time I have had to write this out, because of an errant finger clicking on a link... So, yea... Ka is a wheel. And bitch.  My theory is that Roland ascends, higher and higher through the tower. But as he does, he comes to realize it is not a tower at all, but rather it is a giant axel on which Ka turns. Reaching the top, he looks out over all the worlds, all the universes, as he did when Walter first revealed it to him during their palaver. He sees that all of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again. Over and over.  But maybe Roland can't stand that. The man is not exactly sanity's poster child, and has literally lost everything he has ever loved over, and over again. Now imagine seeing that repeated ad infinitum. Maybe it's too much for poor Roland, seeing that his grand destiny is just to repeat the same horrors and struggles until the end of time.  So he goes mad-er. Looses his mind as he descends the Tower after seeing the rotation of Ka. He knows what he must do, and he knows who he must be. He must take on the mantle of the Crimson King, seeking to break the wheel of Ka so that maybe, just maybe, another Roland Deschain doesn't have to go through what he went through. But also, underlaying that, is the incredibly selfish motivation under all of that hysteria. He knows that the Roland of this turn of Ka will not only kill him, but erase him from existence at the end by the hand of the Artist. And what could a man, who has seen nothing but pain and suffering and knows he is doomed to do it again, want more than oblivion? Even if it means condemning his future self to the same path...  So yea, I don't actually think it ends like that. But it's fun to speculate.  Edit: Thankee big-big for the gold!"
TheDarkTower,3btyub,rottinguy,16,Thu Jul 2 06:30:24 2015 UTC,Don't read the coda. Your imagination is much better. Now I'm kind of dissapointed with the actual text...
TheDarkTower,3btyub,NoTurnBackNow,5,Thu Jul 2 06:54:36 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I think the Crimson King came to be, I wrote a (really bad because wrote fast) fan fic of it.   Here is my copy pasta!  Step by step he climbed the tower, and passed those rooms filled with memories of what he once was. But that was long away and far ago, do ya kennit? Before he had cried off the tower, and become it's enemy. Things are different when you wake up, and know the way of things you see. From under his crimson robes he withdraws an item. To any other person it would be but a horn, and nothing special. But some can see power, or smell it, and this one could see it well. Red was the power that filled the horn of Gillead, red where once there was only White. There was little of himself left to pour into the horn, but pour himself in he did. He left nothing behind of himself but his hatred for the White and it's agents. Though the White had won every time, and would believe itself the winner this time that would not be the case at all. At the top floor he opens the final door, All that was him is now in the horn, and so the horn is sucked through the towers gaping maw, filled with the power of The Crimson King.

TheDarkTower,3btyub,FoxyButter,3,Thu Jul 2 12:22:11 2015 UTC,"Looks like I am in the minority here, but I think that is not the correct decision. What if LOTR readers didn't finish the last book, but stopped when Frodo's vest was shown to Aragorn? Would that have made the ending any different? I think that King wrote an ending, and you chose not to finish what he wrote. I respect that decision, but you didn't truly finish the series. I apologize if this is an heretical opinion."
TheDarkTower,3btyub,ginja_ninja,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"Meh, it's not heretical. But I do think it's apples and oranges. I think Stephen King himself said, in the first few paragraphs of the Coda I *read, that he felt the story was done. The rest was just for those who NEEDED to know. I felt I didn't.  So I think, to borrow your comparison, that it would not be reading the Appendix of LOTR. You still know Frodo goes off to the Gray Havens, you still see Sam get his happy ending... But you might not know what happened to Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, and Merry.  So the story that Tolkien set out to tell is complete, but you maybe don't get the director's commentary.  edit: a word"
TheDarkTower,3bt757,citizenpuppet,16,Wed Jul 1 23:10:58 2015 UTC,"I would have bought this if they worked in any ""Dada chack... Dum a chum..."" references."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,handawanda,53,Wed Jul 1 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"This is my take on it, and it might be far different from what a lot of other people think, but it is a work of art so it is up to interpretation.  The Dark Tower, and by extension Mid-World itself, is a universe created by the interaction of King's mind with the reader's.  Every character in Mid-World is some part of King's own mind.  There are references to the fact that the Dark Tower sprung from Gan's Navel, and there are mentions of King in the real world feeling the story being pulled like a string from his own navel.  I believe Roland even interprets King as Gan when he goes to meet him.  My assertion is that The Dark Tower, and all of its levels, are the story itself.    Now with this in mind, the Crimson King and Roland are two facets of King's personality.  Roland is the part of King that wants Mid-World to keep existing, that wants the story to keep going.  This part of him doesn't want to come up with an ending to the story because he knows it can never really satisfy himself or the readers.  He knows the ending can't ever compare to the journey of creating the world and traveling through it.  There is still a part of him that knows that he has to reach the tower, and that reaching the tower is going to be the end of something.  By the end of the series Roland thinks it will finally be the end to his own life.  But Roland is a character in a book, and he can never really die.  This is why Roland is sucked back to the beginning of the story.  Because this is exactly what happens whenever someone new reads the first book.  Roland is pulled back to the beginning of his journey.    The Crimson King is the part of Stephen King that wants the story to come to an end before it reaches its conclusion.  It is the nagging piece of his mind that tells him he will never be able to finish it so he should just stop.  It is the fear and doubt that whatever ending he reaches will not be satisfactory.  The crimson king is a sick perversion of Roland, and alternate version of the hero himself, who has been through the journey enough times to know he is caught in a loop.  He just wants to end the cycle.  He begs Roland at many points throughout the story to cry off, but when that fails he hopes to destroy the tower so that the cycle can't start over again.  The Crimson King is Stephen King as is Roland.  They both represent him and the process of writing a story.  I am sure that Stephen King has had countless worlds destroyed by the Crimson King before they ever make it on paper, but there is always Roland there to keep pushing forward and questing for the tower, which means in the end some of the stories do get told.    tl;dr The Crimson King, and Roland are different versions of the same person, and represent different facets of King Himself.  The Crimson King wants to destroy the tower to finally bring an end to the cycle of everything resetting itself once Roland reaches the top."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,ka_like_the_wind,3,Wed Jul 1 20:04:39 2015 UTC,This is the absolute best interpretation of the series I have ever heard.  I wish I had thought of it this way.  How did you develop this theory?  You must have some sort of academic background in literature and/or psychology.
TheDarkTower,3brx49,demosthenes4585,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:26:45 2015 UTC,"I actually studied Philosophy in college and minored in Psychology!  Sense of self, identity, and the study of reality were all some of my favorite subjects and the Dark Tower series really hits on a lot of those themes. I slowly came to this theory after talking to my girlfriend who turned me on to the series, and my dad who read it at the same time as me."

TheDarkTower,3brx49,sneakstep,8,Thu Jul 2 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"The thing about the book is that the Crimson King isn't really meant to be the main antagonist. Flagg is definitely a more tangible character, because he is to Roland, whereas he knows little about the CK, so we see less of him. As for his motives, the CK wanted to rule to todash space after toppling reality, not just destroy everything. Perhaps his followers think that they'll be guaranteed safety from the todash monsters. Also, I have to believe that the CK was either a master manipulator, and convinced everyone that he had great power, or that when he killed himself, he lost the power he did have. As for his insanity, I thought it was a development relatively close to the end if the series. Was it not from using the wizards rainbow, or from Roland defending Calla Bryn Sturgis or freeing the breakers?   Anyway, just my thoughts. I hated the end at first then it's necessity dawned on me."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,Gwam,8,Wed Jul 1 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"That's because he's a demi-god in those stories. Like I said above, Flagg is nothing compared to Roland's obsession with the tower which is the real antagonist.  I always thought King's dismissal of Flagg and CK was very intentional to drive that point home. I'm always surprised more people didn't have that impression off the bat."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,thejosharms,2,Wed Jul 1 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"Been a while since I read the series, but the anticlamtic end to the two antagonists never bothered me. A friend and I had a conversation after his first read through, and I pointed out a quote by Roland. I don't remember it verbatim, but I remember Roland telling his katet that battles end extremely fast. I always felt that King was reinforcing that idea by having the build up be longer than each battle."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,Sheemster,2,Wed Jul 1 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Roland nodded. “And the shooting will happen so fast and be over so quick that you’ll wonder what all the planning and palaver was for, when in the end it always comes down to the same five minutes’ worth of blood, pain, and stupidity.”"

TheDarkTower,3brx49,thejosharms,5,Wed Jul 8 12:35:19 2015 UTC,"I thought that was the whole idea and it's been awhile, but I thought that was at least implied in the book. The final battle was when they saved the breakers. They had saved the universe themselves, and they did it as a team. CK wasn't going to be able to do anything himself to hurt the tower, and neither could anybody else. They had set the world back on track. The key world could have gotten better for thousands of years and then maybe somebody else might be able to try to screw it up, but others would be there to save it.  Rolands obsession made him screw that up so he had to do it again. He'll do it until he realizes he doesn't need to. He'll find contentness in just saving the world not feel the need for revenge or justification over the ones he lost."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,kickaguard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:08:52 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking of Roland and the line of Eld as the repair system for all of the levels of the Tower.  Yes, each pass is about Roland's actions and Roland's redemption or lack thereof, but each pass is also slightly improved, we're led to believe.  What if that improvement is the recovery of the Tower and the regeneration of the Beams as Roland passes through level after level of the Tower, setting each to rights in turn?"
TheDarkTower,3brx49,zynthalay,2,Wed Jul 1 19:12:57 2015 UTC,"You make a great point and i think i do agree with you, but since CK was supposed to represent the last major battle for Roland before he reached he end of his quest, the fact that he could be so easily conquered by an eraser took a good deal of air out my enjoyment.  I mean, the creature who sucked out Roland's life thru laughter was far more insidious and cleverly created than CK was, imho."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,Linfinity8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:46:05 2015 UTC,"the last half of that book was full of literary metaphors and straight up blatant solutions based on it being a book. the creature laughing Roland to death would have killed him if Susan didn't think of, and find, a deus ex machina that tipped her off about the danger they were in. erasing CK is almost the same thing as adding a solution just because it needs to be there."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,kickaguard,8,Wed Jul 1 22:02:33 2015 UTC,"You should really read the comics. The background of the Crimson King and his motives is much more expanded in the appendixes there.  Tl;dr Since Arthur Eld, his father, is the one who united humanity and drove back the chaotic, primordial darkness, the Crimson King is the agent of the pre-time darkness come to restore the universe to the chaos it sprang from. If I recall correctly, one of the possible sources for where Arthur Eld brought the first guns into his world to found the gunslingers was the Dark Tower, which is part (though certainly not all) of why it's so important to his descendants. Roland is descended from Eld's human children, the Crimson King's mother was one of the demons of the Prim, thus they end up on the same road to the tower for opposite reasons."
TheDarkTower,3brx49,NyctophobicParanoid,3,Thu Jul 2 08:03:36 2015 UTC,"Given that the series as we read it represents one iteration of journeys that Roland makes to the tower, I'm only going to speak to this version of the Crimson King, and try not to speculate on what happens to him in each iteration. That said, the King's madness doesn't strike me as a fixed thing, it's dynamic. This matters, or at least I think it does, because he drew the taheen and the low men into his service before his madness progressed to the town poisoning, spoon swallowing creature that finally succumbed to the tower's call. Perhaps he was more charismatic, capable of selling everyone in his service on the notion of breaking the beams being a good thing (Pimli Prentiss certainly seemed to think there was something wrapped up in his religious beliefs and the work he was doing) and by the time he completely flipped they were too deep in to see a way out. This doesn't invalidate your main point, though, because a lot of that is left up to the readers to fill in for themselves."

It is typically described with ocean-like qualities, made home by a plentitude of Lovecraftian terrors known as the Great Ones.  •When Gan rose from the Prim, it receded, leaving creatures of those dark waters stranded on the fringes of the newly formed multiverse.  •One of these creatures was Maerlyn, who cared for nothing but chaos. Maerlyn was instrumental in the creation of The Bends of the Rainbows, bringing evil into the worlds, and even the birth of Flagg and the Crimson King.  •The Crimson King was born from a union between Aurthur Eld and a creature of the Prim. He seeks to remake the universe so as to better suit his dark kin.  •The Crimson King is immensely powerful and resourceful, so it's no wonder so many creatures would follow him into battle, especially if promised some form of paradise/reward when the smoke clears.  •I recommend reading the comic series and any other material put forward by Robin Furth regarding The Dark Tower series.

TheDarkTower,3br7jd,JohnAnderton,2,Wed Jul 1 17:45:26 2015 UTC,He's a mysterious drifter who seems to know a lot more than he lets on and disappears after that first interaction. It fits surprisingly well
TheDarkTower,3bop91,dbarefoot,8,Tue Jun 30 22:22:21 2015 UTC,That was the very first thing I thought of when I watched that episode! Has to be a Stephen King influence.
TheDarkTower,3bop91,BARTELS-,8,Tue Jun 30 23:01:31 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that The Yellow King from season 1 always reminded me of The Crimson King. It's all very 19.
TheDarkTower,3bop91,BeardisGood,5,Wed Jul 1 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"The King in Yellow is actually a fake play that was the basis of a series of short stories published in the late 1800's.  It's super creepy, and definitely worth a read."
TheDarkTower,3bop91,Mugmoor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:37:36 2015 UTC,...how does one read a fake play?
TheDarkTower,3bop91,NineteenthJester,4,Wed Jul 1 06:07:31 2015 UTC,"The short stories are real, and are in the book 'The King in Yellow'. The play itself only exists within the short stories themselves."
TheDarkTower,3bop91,Mugmoor,2,Wed Jul 1 09:35:17 2015 UTC,Thanks! Will check it out!
TheDarkTower,3bop91,NineteenthJester,4,Wed Jul 1 15:36:52 2015 UTC,Jesus - you made me want to read the books all over again.
TheDarkTower,3bop91,2400,3,Wed Jul 1 00:35:04 2015 UTC,First thing I thought too. Can't wait to see how that plot unfolds.

TheDarkTower,3boxhk,GroovyTrout,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:40:11 2015 UTC,I believe this was one of the additions when the books were reworked after Wizard and Glass.
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,lokizero,23,Tue Jun 30 02:09:33 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be insensitive, but I just don't see it. He seems kind of seedy, almost criminal; not at all like a gunslinger.   Admittedly, that's just my amateur opinion."
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,EvanMcCormick,4,Tue Jun 30 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it doesn't help that he usually plays the bad guy our at least a creepy dick in anything I've seen him in.  Especially Boardwalk Empire."
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,rube,8,Tue Jun 30 14:07:46 2015 UTC,I think he has the chops. He has a silent intensity that would be perfect for Roland.
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,shadowash213,3,Tue Jun 30 03:19:35 2015 UTC,"Watching him in the role would be really interesting. Roland starts as most of us (maybe just me) see Shannon; cold, unyielding, and intense. To play a character that evolves like Roland through the story would give us a chance to watch Shannon evolve his image as an actor."
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,leftysarepeople2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:41:18 2015 UTC,Watch Young Ones to get a sense of what he'd be like as the gunslinger
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,Hidden_Willie,18,Sun Jul 5 21:20:25 2015 UTC,I think he'd be way better for the man in black than Roland. His eyes are too large and expressive.
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,shadowash213,3,Tue Jun 30 03:56:07 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, he could nail the creepy aspect. But tmib also had a twisted humor that might be missing."
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,dylanbob5,2,Tue Jun 30 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen & heard interviews with him. Like most of his roles, he's a pretty strange guy. He'd kill it as the Man in Black."
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,hockeyguy013,5,Fri Jul 17 16:57:07 2015 UTC,Maybe the man in black would be better for him
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,TheDoode,4,Tue Jun 30 14:37:18 2015 UTC,I like him for Jonas.
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,Maxtrt,4,Tue Jun 30 15:29:53 2015 UTC,He's the right height I could see it with some stubble though he would have to lose some weight as he's a little too muscular.
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,raniff,4,Tue Jun 30 05:15:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, how about Cort ?"
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,perkyzebra,3,Tue Jun 30 10:26:46 2015 UTC,"I was thinking Cort, or possibly the man in black. Something like that."
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,qunfused,3,Tue Jun 30 10:50:52 2015 UTC,I can see it too but with some more wear and backbone
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,perkyzebra,3,Tue Jun 30 03:46:39 2015 UTC,"I love Michael Shannon and think he's incredibly talented, but in my humble opinion he is way too villainous looking for Roland. Just my thoughts!"
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,RobertB91,3,Tue Jun 30 10:49:58 2015 UTC,He's definitely very stoic and reserved. That would make the moments that Roland blows up definitely work well. His scenes in Boardwalk Empire and Iceman when he flies off the hinge are great.
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,marcocarbone,4,Tue Jun 30 17:35:11 2015 UTC,Id have never thought of him but i like the choice. He can be cold  and calculating when need be.  I would be good with this
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,SkoldpaddaCommala,4,Tue Jun 30 04:53:33 2015 UTC,I can see that.

TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,thundydome,2,Tue Jun 30 11:43:36 2015 UTC,He was fantastic in Bug and Take Shelter
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,Brendancs0,2,Tue Jun 30 13:04:42 2015 UTC,Love the actor I think someone epic and amazing like him should do the role
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,anothermanoutoftime,2,Tue Jun 30 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"I swear, every Roland casting choice I see on here I think would work better for Walter. Does this say something about the two characters, or am I just contrary?"
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,ricefaq,2,Tue Jun 30 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, he would be a good choice for Martin/Walter/Flagg/whomever. But I think what a lot of people miss about Roland is that he's no Roy Rogers. I mean look what he does in the Gunslinger, he guns down a whole town and lets Jake die for his quest. He should look a little haunted, and people should be wary of him when they see him come in to town. Also I can totally see Michael Shannon in this scene: http://i.imgur.com/WyzY18w.jpg  edit: stupid apostrophe"
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,marcusthecrab,5,Tue Jun 30 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"I thought he was good as Zod, but while I was watching Boardwalk Empire today it suddenly clicked: Holy shit, that's Roland!"
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,Iamshanty,2,Tue Jun 30 02:17:00 2015 UTC,An interesting choice. I like it. A bit like young Roland in the comics.
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,WordsInDm,4,Tue Jun 30 04:28:53 2015 UTC,waaaay too creepy looking
TheDarkTower,3bl0kv,CaptConstantine,2,Tue Jun 30 10:10:09 2015 UTC,"The reason I think this could work is that I can actually see a bit of Stephen King in him. Which, obviously, Roland was supposed to look a little bit like."

Thanks so much for for giving us a little taste with Walter (my absolute favorite King character of all time!) and more Tower verse material to enjoy.
TheDarkTower,3bksd3,thelonelypubman,2,Tue Jun 30 03:56:25 2015 UTC,My hero!
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,OriginalOutlaw,11,Mon Jun 29 20:55:53 2015 UTC,Wasn't the journey we read his 19th? hence the number 19's presence throughout the books?
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,shredler,8,Mon Jun 29 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"That has been one theory I've heard, but I often argue that the subsequent will be the 19th, and final trip. Mainly because he now has the horn. In the Browning poem 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came', which is often cited as the inspiration for TDK, Roland blows his horn at the gate of the Dark Tower and it ends. So in line with 19 I confect the series as his penultimate journey, or 18th, and the following thereafter his 19th. Nineteen being what the Man in Black told Alice to say to Nort in Tull to reveal life after death.   But obviously it's all up for debate, which is what I love so much about the series!!"
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,cmcb21,9,Mon Jun 29 23:15:50 2015 UTC,"With each quest to the Tower, Roland gains a little bit of humanity back. In the beginning of the series, Roland is the Tower Junkie that Eddie proclaims him to be. Hell, in the 1st book Roland lets Jake drop to his death, but, he did pull Jake back in to Mid- World and raised him as his son, something he might not have done in previous trips. Maybe he just let Jake fall to his death and never attempted to get him back.  I feel as the books progress Roland comes to truly love his ka-tet, evidence of this is towards the end when Roland shouts their names from the balcony of the Tower. Maybe he never did that on previous quests.   Roland awakes with the Horn of the Eld, something he left with his fallen comrade Cuthbert at the Battle of Jericho Hill. The Horn is now in Roland's possession, which signifies The Gunslinger has redeemed himself completely. He can now enter the Tower and blow the Horn from its balcony."
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,cavaliereternally,2,Mon Jun 29 21:45:53 2015 UTC,Do you think he'll blow the horn from the balcony or lay it down with aunt's rosary?
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,GroovyTrout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"I think he'll blow it, because when he heard the horn from the roses/tower/beam he thought that it should have been him blowing the horn."
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,Idirrtts,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"I like this theory, I just finished the last volume and it makes sense that's now he's able to not repeat the quest and finally finishing it"
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,ginja_ninja,9,Sat Jul 18 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Roland's greatest and ultimate failure every time is that he always climbs to the top. That's what I think the epilogue is meant to symbolize. No matter what he changes about his journey, Roland will always be forced to repeat it when he opens that final door. The only way for him to truly be free is to give up the Tower, turn around and walk away. But will he ever be able to?"
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,ginja_ninja,2,Tue Jun 30 02:49:08 2015 UTC,"I like this! After Songs of Susannah, and the whole Stephen King plot device, I've often thought about the relationship between author and subject. More so, however, I've considered the relationship between the reader and the same subject. We are as much Roland as he is. So it is up to us to refrain from reading beyond the epilogue. We are the only hope Roland ever has of ending his eternal journey!"
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,ginja_ninja,3,Tue Jun 30 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I've been thinking about writing a post on that subject for a while. Stephen starts involving himself in the series eventually, and I think it's only natural that the reader is involved as well. In the end though he's doing the writing, it's the reader and the very act of reading that's actually driving Roland forward. He even addresses the reader directly before the epilogue basically saying, ""You might not want to read this, I pretty much had to end it this way."" So in effect Roland's decision not to go on is tied to our own. The reader can simply put down the last book and never read the series again, and that's the point Roland finally is able to walk away from the Tower and get his well-deserved rest."
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,mrcooms,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"Do you think anyone has ever not read the epilogue? I've never thought about it before, but I can't imagine anyone having read the whole series and deciding to listen to SK at the end and not read on..."
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,Chefca,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. It's the same trap, really. Roland has been fixated on the Tower for so long that it's impossible for him not to climb to the top, just like the reader."
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,McKushin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:56:09 2015 UTC,I have a friend of mine that swears that she didn't read after SK told her to stop.  It drives ME crazy that she ended without knowing the real ending.
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,steeljaw,3,Wed Jul 1 13:13:38 2015 UTC,"I like to think that the tower is a sentient machine that is so old it's ascended to a much higher plain of existence where time doesn't matter and it's giving Roland a chance to break the cycle during every turn.    The horn is the change at the end, but maybe it offered him death by lobstrosity bite at the beginning of our journey. Maybe the tower woke and placed that lone (Just one? Where were the others???) lobster right next to him for the 18/19th turn just like it placed the horn on his hip for the 19/20th."
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,bakemonosan,2,Mon Jun 29 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have it right here man. It didn't place the horn on his hip, it gave him a chance to relive his life and this time he took the horn, instead of leaving it with Cuthbert."
TheDarkTower,3bjy6w,SkoldpaddaCommala,3,Mon Jun 29 22:52:08 2015 UTC,"Not entirely... He was brought back to the desert. He only quickly recalled the new memory of picking the horn up this time, but didn't actually relive the battle of Jericho Hill. So in a way, it was given to him just as much as he technically took it this time. Right?"
TheDarkTower,3bk5qp,BooBooga,3,Mon Jun 29 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"Hi, if I remember correctly, he was part of Algul Siento, he escaped, events of Hearts in Atlantis happened and he was relocated back into Algul Siento until he met Roland&co.  I did not read any of the comics, but as the books go, he headed towards Calla with others.  It is few years since I read the books, so if there is anything I missed, I would be glad to know that... after all, anything new to learn from DT mythos is awesome :)"
TheDarkTower,3bk5qp,etrenank,4,Mon Jun 29 23:34:33 2015 UTC,"You've got it right, and when he parts company with Roland, Susannah, and Oy he says that his group may go to doorway cave and try to get back America side."

TheDarkTower,3bcs8w,BIGlikeaBOSS,2,Sun Jun 28 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"Turtles all the way down:       ""Turtles all the way down"" is a jocular expression of the infinite regress problem in cosmology posed by the ""unmoved mover"" paradox. The metaphor in the anecdote represents a popular notion of the myth that Earth is actually flat and is supported on the back of a World Turtle, which itself is propped up by a chain of larger and larger turtles. Questioning what the final turtle might be standing on, the anecdote humorously concludes that it is ""turtles all the way down"".  The phrase has been commonly known since at least the early 20th century. A comparable metaphor describing the circular cause and consequence for the same problem is the ""chicken and egg problem"". The same problem in epistemology is known as the Münchhausen trilemma.

TheDarkTower,3babsm,wookiesdontcry,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:07:36 2015 UTC,It shouldn't spoil too much for you!  It's from the comic series (The Man in Black #3).

TheDarkTower,3azfck,SPNR128,2,Thu Jun 25 05:30:50 2015 UTC,"I also find this a bit annoying in lots of pictures too, but it would be a major spoiler especially on the front of the books (where I hear this complaint most).   I would never want to spoil that bit for someone, the crushing loss, the sense of how can he still do this without his best shooting hand, you almost feel as lost as Roland.  This is why I'm OK with fingers in pictures."
TheDarkTower,3azfck,steeljaw,2,Thu Jun 25 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I was more referring to pictures of Roland in Can' Ka No Rey, I mean obviously if you're looking at pictures from the last book you should know what happened :)"

TheDarkTower,3b051d,jakemg,6,Wed Jun 24 22:15:14 2015 UTC,I was an audio book listener and how I remember it was with a short U sound like you said first. To break it up:  Kuhth-bert
TheDarkTower,3b051d,Archaic44,4,Wed Jun 24 22:22:41 2015 UTC,I always pronounced it with the long u.  IIRC in the audio books Muller uses the long u and Guidall the short.
TheDarkTower,3b051d,boots4210,3,Wed Jun 24 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"I will confirm this statement, as I have listened to all 7 books about 10 times. King himself was the reader of books 1-3 and HE pronounced it Q-thbert so I would say that is the way it should be. Guidall mispronounces it and it drives me crazy."

TheDarkTower,3b051d,Hugh_Jampton,0,Thu Jun 25 00:18:00 2015 UTC,That's how it was pronounced in the audiobook

Combine that with a story that isn't all that far from believable, like Pet Cemetary, and it's a recpie for getting really freaked out. ."

TheDarkTower,3ahze3,Eosphorian,7,Sat Jun 20 12:43:26 2015 UTC,"I hate to be a Debbie downer here, but the whole 19 thing never made sense to me and I felt it was a weaker point of TDT.  It was like King wanted his own personal version of 42 and just dropped it into the series over halfway through without any justification(that I remember at least).  And now we have a situation where anytime 19 appears its considered significant, when in reality its just the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon."
TheDarkTower,3ahze3,hornwalker,11,Sat Jun 20 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"well, as far as I know, King had his accident on June 19th 1999, so he has a certain justification indeed for putting it in. ""Looking back"", the number 19 was as much as key-phrase as ""Dandelo"", ""Chassit""(which means 19, as far as I know), ""Blaine is a pain, and that is the truth"", ""All things server the beam"", and so on and so forth ;)  oh, and the driver of the vehicle died on King's birthday 1 or 2 years later, I think :p"
TheDarkTower,3ahze3,FancyPigeonIsFancy,4,Sat Jun 20 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"I thought the idea of 19 was introduced in the first book. There's that prolonged flashback of the town where Roland ends up killing everyone...the woman who works at the bar is slipped a note by the Man in Black along the lines of ""Don't ask about 19!""   Of course, I know King went back and revised book one once he picked up the series again so maybe that was one of the ""updates""?"
TheDarkTower,3ahze3,cyvaris,5,Sat Jun 20 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was an update. The original does not include 19."

TheDarkTower,3abd5z,Mrscatcat,6,Thu Jun 18 19:31:19 2015 UTC,Idk I think it was more along the lines of the demon stole the seed and than it was manipulated by the Crimson King before implantation. Or it could have happened after when Mia was feasting in the court of the Crimson king. That's my personal interpretation of it.  Plus to me it feels like he was trying to cram the Arthur legend into the ending and it was sort of contrived.
TheDarkTower,3abd5z,OriginalOutlaw,3,Thu Jun 18 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"I don't remember it well enough to quote anything, but I recall some verbiage about all that while Mia was in the Castle Discordia mayhaps."

TheDarkTower,3a8aar,Springbks7,7,Thu Jun 18 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"[SPOILERS] I really just hope to see Roland beginning his quest with the horn of eld. It'll be a subtle thing only fans will understand, but it can justify any number of alterations made to the story.  Another thing, I always imagined beginning the story with the drawing of the three and showing the gunslinger through flashbacks might be more engaging for a mainstream audience."
TheDarkTower,3a8aar,NothingDoom,3,Thu Jun 18 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. If the first scene shows him waking up in the desert, picking up the horn, and then following the man in black, they would have a totally acceptable way to manipulate the story (within reason) for a larger audience."
TheDarkTower,3a8aar,shredler,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting point about omitting the SK parts. Never really thought about that, but it would make sense to cut that all out for several reasons. Although, it would be difficult to convey the omnipresent concept of the Tower without Gan, or Sai King if it were...   I have always imagined they would start with the quintessential Man-in-black-gunslinger-follows beginning, but then it would quickly flashback to the Wizard and Glass stories first, developing Roland and the concept of the Gunslingers vs The Good Man and the world moving on, and then go back to Tull and Allie before the slaughter and go from there."

TheDarkTower,39fak9,dbarefoot,9,Thu Jun 11 10:04:23 2015 UTC,"Miles Teller is a great young actor, and a good choice for Eddie. You want somebody quite young, I think, to distinguish him more from Roland and to enable him to 'grow' through the movies/TV show."
TheDarkTower,39fak9,breatherevenge,8,Thu Jun 11 10:22:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not mentioning Aaron Paul as Eddie. I really have never seen him as an Eddie Dean. And yes, people, I watched Breaking Bad."

TheDarkTower,39fak9,iOgef,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:23:54 2015 UTC,"I liked the idea of Aaron Paul as Eddie before seeing Breaking Bad, and never realised he liked the series of books!

TheDarkTower,39fak9,Idirrtts,3,Thu Jun 11 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they'll make him 'Hollywood Ugly' at best"
TheDarkTower,39fak9,thatcambridgebird,7,Sun Jun 14 00:31:32 2015 UTC,He's perfect or the role
TheDarkTower,39fak9,thatcambridgebird,5,Thu Jun 11 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"Do you know what, I've been considering this for a while, and though he's almost completely unknown outside of GTA 5 mocap acting, my vote is now swaying toward Steven Ogg. I mean, he's only 40, but he could play older, I think. He has a decent amount of beard grey to work with for the older-guy look, and to be honest I always imagined Roland to look mid-40s-50 or so, but actually to have lived a thousand lives, do ya kennit?   And I was in the Viggo-for-Roland camp for a long time, but I think he's too well known. Aside from McConaughey for Flagg, who I shall champion to the death, I'd actually like a cast of unknowns rather than a megastar-dream-cast."
TheDarkTower,39fak9,Creflo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"Steven Ogg is a choice I wouldn't have come up with, but certainly seems like a reasonable suggestion.  He kind of looks like Billy Bob Thornton in the photo you linked.    I totally forgot about McConaughey as Flagg, and I'm not against it.  Someone mentioned Hugo Weaving in the comments and I really like him as the Man in Black."
TheDarkTower,39fak9,starista,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Oooh yes, Hugo Weaving is a great actor who is just well known enough, but not too everywhere to be interesting. I think McConaughey would kill it as Flagg, but I suppose the danger is that he's too big a name - especially if the rest of the cast were unknowns.   I would say go for a Walking Dead-style cast, of mostly either little-known actors or actors who've mostly come from TV roles. I mean, TWD has skyrocketed the careers of the big three leads - Andy Lincoln, Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride, but I only really knew of Andy Lincoln as the guy in the old UK show This Life (and that appalling turn in Love, Actually) beforehand."

TheDarkTower,39fak9,starista,3,Thu Jun 11 20:12:34 2015 UTC,If the fact that picturing Roland dancing the Commala slightly turned me on is wrong then I don't wanna be right.
TheDarkTower,39fak9,Niftypifty,4,Sat Jun 13 15:18:21 2015 UTC,Any actor that cannot turn on all the Sisters of Oriza  young and old is not the right choice.
TheDarkTower,39fak9,dohrk,3,Sat Jun 13 21:54:12 2015 UTC,Agreed 119%.
TheDarkTower,39fak9,irishspuds,3,Sat Jun 13 23:24:08 2015 UTC,"Flagg/Man in Black will be another difficult search as well.    I'm also concerned that with the film/series aspect, that the amount of time that filming and production will cover will make casting the important role of Jake Chambers more difficult...as the actor might age too quickly to convincingly portray Jake's age through to the end.    edit : word"
TheDarkTower,39fak9,OriginalOutlaw,5,Thu Jun 11 17:50:34 2015 UTC,My choice for the Man in Black would be Hugo Weaving. I feel he has the perfect voice and gravitas to pull it off.

TheDarkTower,39fak9,titanhermant,2,Thu Jun 25 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"I actually did a budget analysis for my film financing class in film school as if we were going to film all 7 books/movies at once a la LOTR. The biggest issue ended up being when/how to shoot all of Jake's scenes close together so that the aging problem was just dealt with in the most straight-forward way as possible. That alone would have ended up taking 2.3 years and costing $85m.   For those of you wondering, we found that the whole project would have taken 12 years and cost north of $1.3b, and that was back in 2008 aka 9.9% cumulative inflation ago."

TheDarkTower,39fak9,dbarefoot,3,Thu Jun 11 17:29:10 2015 UTC,Considering Roland is modeled after the quintessential cowboy actor I don't think that should be an issue.
TheDarkTower,39fak9,titanhermant,2,Fri Jun 12 03:15:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I meant more with recognition I guess. Actors generally don't like being type casted now, and playing two different Cowboys, and main characters, at the same time could create complications with marketing. It'd be kinda weird to see two spreads in a magazine with him looking pretty much the same in both and promoting two different things"

TheDarkTower,39fak9,titanhermant,7,Thu Jun 11 10:22:09 2015 UTC,"That's an older picture of him.  If you've ever seen him in Hell on Wheels, he's got a decent amount of grey to work with.    A few of my friends think it should be Viggo Mortensen, but I disagree.  Shame that it can never be Clint."
TheDarkTower,39fak9,flyincaveman,3,Thu Jun 11 10:28:05 2015 UTC,"Viggo is too kind looking, Roland should look more cold and piercing. It can't be Clint but his son has been mentioned a few times, although he's kind of young.  While Clint is the prime choice I feel like he'd bring his own personality into the character too much as everything he plays behaves the same way which doesn't resonate with Roland for me."
TheDarkTower,39fak9,roland0fgilead,4,Thu Jun 11 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"Have you seen The Road before? Viggo in that doesn't look too kind.

TheDarkTower,397drf,Roland_Deserves_It,12,Tue Jun 9 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"I always took away that people change. Jake was a scared little boy the first time we meet him and he's very clearly a gunslinger by the end. Susannah is obviously two people becoming one person. Eddie is a drug addict who becomes a strong rock of a man. Sheemie is a bumbling fool in his first appearance and helps save the day by the end. Roland is a piece of shit tower junkie and on this pass through, he seems to realize there's more to it than that. I always felt this is why he now has the horn. And maybe the horn doesn't exactly change everything, but it's another step in Roland becoming a complete person and moving past being for the tower and nothing else.  Nothing you say is wrong, except it doesn't take in to account the horn. The next pass isn't the same as the one we read about, now maybe it's not the final pass through, but it's not the same. He's doomed to repeat himself until he gets it right. We know how hardheaded he his, maybe it's taken him a thousand passes at it to get it as much right as he has, but he's learning.   That was always my take anyway."

Mayhaps on his next go round things will be different.

TheDarkTower,397drf,Theres_A_FAP_4_That,3,Wed Jun 10 13:23:42 2015 UTC,Yes. The beams hold up the Tower and all the worlds. Now that I think of it...maybe Roland doesn't care about saving everyone. He just knows that saving the beams will save the tower and all he really wants is to make it to the top.
TheDarkTower,397drf,_42_,2,Wed Jun 10 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"After finishing, I thought Roland would have to give up the tower before things could end for him. The Crimson King is trapped on the balcony, and the beams are safe from the breakers in Algul Siento. Ultimately, the tower is safe, and Roland doesn't have to see it to protect it. While some sacrifices were absolutely necessary, Roland's entrapment in this cycle is punishment for his choices and lives sacrificed unnecessarily just so he could see the tower. I think Roland's journey ends when he saves the beams and chooses to leave his ambition for the tower behind."

TheDarkTower,393dtr,SorrowOfMoldovia,3,Tue Jun 9 01:21:48 2015 UTC,He played a drug addict pretty well on HBO's Treme

TheDarkTower,393dtr,unclebeard,2,Tue Jun 9 18:18:47 2015 UTC,I hated him based on the way he treated Annie. I had such a TV crush on her

TheDarkTower,393dtr,manamachine,5,Tue Jun 9 17:04:56 2015 UTC,This might be the first fantasy casting that was worth looking at. Jorah has some similar qualities. Just darken up his hair a bit and I can see it.
TheDarkTower,393dtr,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,2,Tue Jun 9 04:57:41 2015 UTC,"Hell, just obscure his lighter features via darker clothing and you got a convincing Roland."

TheDarkTower,393dtr,starista,10,Tue Jun 9 17:53:40 2015 UTC,Is anyone else really opposed to the rumored casting of Aaron Paul as Eddie? I've always pictured Eddie as a lanky Italian-ish dude. My dream would be Ed Norton but I think he may be too old. I think Jared Leto or Jake Gyllenhall would both be awesome picks though. A guy can dream right?
TheDarkTower,393dtr,dohrk,13,Tue Jun 9 01:35:36 2015 UTC,Joseph Gordon-Levitt looks young enough and has the acting chops to play Eddie.
TheDarkTower,393dtr,deathxbyxsnusnu,3,Tue Jun 9 14:36:02 2015 UTC,Totally agree on this one.
TheDarkTower,393dtr,metaljunkie,7,Tue Jun 9 21:22:20 2015 UTC,for Eddie I always pictured a young James Franco (circa. Freak and Geeks era)

TheDarkTower,393dtr,thebrandnewbob,5,Tue Jun 9 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like all of those are too old. I really want Eddie to be in his early twenties at the beginning. I get that it doesn't have to keep the same timeline. Thats just how I see the character.  The other reason I really dislike the Aaron Paul idea is because it would just be him playing Pinkman again. Its similar to how Benedict Cumberbatch was just Sherlock in space when he played Kahn."

TheDarkTower,393dtr,clearedasfiled,2,Tue Jun 9 14:40:52 2015 UTC,I wish he read the audio books of ASOIAF or even Dark Tower. That would be my shit.
TheDarkTower,393dtr,selxxa,2,Tue Jun 9 18:54:18 2015 UTC,But doesn't he have gray scale? He might not make it all 7 books/movies.

TheDarkTower,38nuxe,BrujahRage,9,Fri Jun 5 12:45:00 2015 UTC,"MEGA SPOILERS IF YOU HAVENT READ THE ENTIRE SERIES DO NOT READ THIS POST!!!!!    I believe Walter(Flagg/the man in black) is a dark agent of change, timeless and outside the limits of percieved time.  He is somewhat immortal and although he denies being Maerlyn, he allows people to believe he is.  I think he is consciously aware of every cycle Roland has been through, which is why he caused Roland's vision of the infinite after the palaver in the Golgotha of bone and sets Roland on the quest for the Tower.  I believe in the first time around, after Roland's ressurrection after the Battle of Jericho Hill, this palaver wasn't necessary.  However,  if any missteps in subsequent cycles occurred, Walter had to intervene to ensure Roland meets the Crimson King.  For good or ill,  all or naught, the Tower must be reached, for then, and only then might the Dark become triumphant. The Crimson King can't possibly escape his cell without Roland.  The White hasn't prevailed yet,  it's only caused a stalemate thus far,  hopefully the Horn of Eld will yield a better outcome, kennit?"
TheDarkTower,38nuxe,boomboom68,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"One question for your theory.  If The Crimson King can not escape the balcony without Roland then why does he immediately try to kill him when he shows up at Can Ka No Rey?  I think that in the end that we can be sure that while Walter appears to be an agent of The Crimson King, he serves no one but himself and wants to gain access to The Tower for himself, he believes that by doing so he can become God of All.  I think we can update your theory by saying ""if Jake is never drawn in the speaking ring then Susanna will never be impregnated with Mordred, and Mordred is Walter's key to entering The Tower.  If he can amputate the bloodstained heel of Mordred then he will be able to open the door to The Tower"".."

I think it had to do something with the blood of Arthur Eld.  Pretty sure it didn't have to be living blood,  hence the attempted murder of Roland and the heel of Mordred being a decent facsimile."
TheDarkTower,38nuxe,boomboom68,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"The Crimson King is locked on a balcony outside of The Tower, essentially trapped and unable to get off of or into The Tower, so he would have no way to retrieve Roland's body.    But I believe you are correct, only the bloodline of Arthur Eld, or the gunslinger's revolvers can open the door, this is why Walter wants to kill Mordred and amputate his foot with the birthmark, he knows there is no chance of him acquiring Roland's revolvers..  I believe there was also some sort of prophecy about ""the prince with the bloodstained heel would open the door to The Tower and ascend"" or something like that. So Walter thinks ""I just need the kids foot to get in the door, he doesn't need to be alive"".."
TheDarkTower,38nuxe,steeljaw,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:30:13 2015 UTC,The crimson king doesn't really want to escape the tower he wants the tower to fall

TheDarkTower,38nuxe,Razanur,6,Fri Jun 5 22:25:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a 'correct' answer to this, mainly because we don't get Walter's POV.  We're led to believe that he's dead after the end of The Gunslinger, only to find out that he's still alive at the end of The Wastelands.  Could he have had to deal with split memories?  By the time we see him again, everything has been set right. So maybe.  Maybe Walter simply transcends times and worlds and it was never an issue for him at all."

TheDarkTower,38nuxe,SkoldpaddaCommala,2,Fri Jun 5 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"Well not sure if it showed Marten's POV between the time Roland splits and mends his  memories. But he definetly does have a supernatural aspect about him, one that actually transcends the embrace of Dark Tower. According to the canon comic series, his father is Maerlyn and his mother is the Goddess of the Dark Doon (or something like that). Maerlyn is a creature of the outer dark that rose from the Primm.  Marten's supernatural conception and upbringing may have some effect on him and the paradox."

TheDarkTower,388ba1,SignpostChicago,9,Tue Jun 2 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"I kinda' don't want to see a film version, the world in my head can't be bested by someone else's visualization - I even struggle with the graphic novel.  That being said, of course I will be first in line.  I always saw Roland as more grizzled.  There is a British actor named John Lynch that I would love to see as Roland. I also think Timothy Olyphant would be a good Eddie and Sufe Bradshaw as Susannah.  That is the problem, everyone sees Roland differently and any actor who portrays him will upset some fraction of fans.  I worry they are going to just cast some handsome guy to appeal to a wide audience."

TheDarkTower,388p0k,leighdelo,2,Tue Jun 2 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"I had to look it up, as the spheres rang true for me.  http://www.thetemples.org/en states that this is the Hall of Spheres and here's a copy/paste of their description:  The Hall of Spheres symbolically represents the heart of the Temples. Here, refined energies that are subtle, telluric, and divine flow through the Temples. The Hall hosts nine spheres, eight of which are positioned in the lateral niches, and one of which is placed in the center of an opening excavated in the rock, facing the entrance. Each sphere contains alchemical liquids of a different color. The Hall of the Spheres is artistically characterized by the presence of figurative mosaics, sculptures and paintings. The ceiling and the upper part of the walls are completely covered in gold leaf. The niches are separated from each other by small, young-stone columns, and the sculpted capitals support precious metal chalices. The floor of the Hall of Spheres is paved with precious marble in grey-pink tonality with red veins. The central rhomboid on the floor and the spheres contained in the niches recall the design of the human soul structure according to the Damanhurian philosophy. This hall is available for profound meditations with one’s own soul, and to stimulate spiritual growth. During the experience of Contact with the Cosmos, held during different times of the year, the spheres can be used for experimental research to contact non-earthly intelligences."

I think for King-fans it is somewhat known that King is not the ""Ending-Guru"" since he doesn't really like to write them and they're not what he's best known for. Just so you know that ;)  I would say it's about the journey itself. After SoS (little pun there) there may be only 1 book left, but there's still so much story in this last book that it could count as 2 ;)"

The beauty of reading is you take away from the book what you choose to. It takes place in YOUR head not his. This is why people can have differing opinions of the same book or even both like the book but for vastly different reasons. I would choose not to associate with that guy anymore though.. he may be a decent guy otherwise but how many more books/movies might he spill the beans on?"

The difference occurs, really, if you believe that one source is fictional and another isn't. If there's no different in the nature of the texts, then they're all fictional and all literary."
TheDarkTower,3855an,BrujahRage,2,Tue Jun 2 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is true. I suppose I mostly see a distinction in that when I think of the word 'literary' I think of something that had one (or I suppose sometimes multiple) known authors, whereas folklore and religion have been passed down for so long they kind of exist in an amorphous blob of fiction."
TheDarkTower,3855an,BrujahRage,2,Tue Jun 2 00:49:21 2015 UTC,"I absolutely see where you're coming from, entirely. I just thought it would be worth pointing out an alternative viewpoint. And we really have no idea if King ever thought to limit himself to literary references or just wanted to put in things that he thought were cool - which just happen to be literary references, because the guy reads as much as he writes."
TheDarkTower,3855an,BrujahRage,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Reading the main series I thought they were all literary references, it seemed to fit for a myriad of reasons, then Garuda kind of threw that theory out the window. Hell if everything is just another level of the tower I suppose there's nothing stopping one of them being named after a famous 'keystone world' animal either."
TheDarkTower,3855an,angel_of_afterlife,2,Tue Jun 2 00:56:05 2015 UTC,I just started one where the characters are basically being extorted and lied to by North Central Positronics. They started out in a dogan.
TheDarkTower,3855an,Safety_Dancer,2,Tue Jun 2 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where my players are gonna start yet. I think I might have it take place after the main 7 DT books so that the players (most of whom have read the books) don't need to worry about the timeline.

TheDarkTower,3855an,angel_of_afterlife,2,Tue Jun 2 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting. I like having them working for the villains, that's always a fun GM trick. Unfortunately (or not, depending) my playgroup is super in the know starting out, so I'm not going to be able to pull something like that over on them.

If Russell Crowe slimmed down some and got a nice leathery tan I would still like him to do it, something about that AUS/NZ accent that would add some mysticism to it compared to Eddie/Jake/Susannah's different American ones."

TheDarkTower,37xjh8,BadWolfStark,1 point,Sun May 31 08:42:30 2015 UTC,I strongly agree with Timothy Olyphant. But I've also thought Russel Crowe could do it too.

TheDarkTower,37xjh8,SignpostChicago,3,Tue Jun 2 20:35:45 2015 UTC,Hugh Laurie as Roland  Ben Foster as Eddie  Kerry Washington as Susannah  Jake will always be tough because almost anyone you cast will age too quickly over the filming of the series.  So I say make him more like 15 years old and cast someone like Freddie Highmore who can play a teenager but who's done with puberty.  William Fichtner as Randall Flagg  Tim Roth as Father Callahan  Frank Welker as Blaine the Mono
TheDarkTower,37xjh8,RogerSwanson,0,Sun May 31 14:18:34 2015 UTC,"*Hugh Laurie as Roland: no thanks *Tim Roth as Father Callahan? He's too young, while Callahan is more than 60 year old"

TheDarkTower,37sm6t,sudin,6,Sat May 30 01:38:39 2015 UTC,"The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way, for once the drifted track that cut its way through the thick crust of alkali had been a highway. Coaches and buckas had followed it. The world had moved on since then. The world had emptied."

TheDarkTower,37tmgf,mrx1101,3,Sat May 30 10:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think the whole 19 thing can be explained by reading SK's notes at the end of the 6th book. 19 coincides with the dates that he wrote the Dark Tower on, majority of his notes marked at the end of book 6 are dated mostly on the 19th day of each month. Also the date that he finished (or started) The Gunslinger was June 19, 1970. I think SK noticed this coincidence with the dates and incorporated it into the story."

TheDarkTower,37r82k,Nimbacinus,2,Fri May 29 20:08:16 2015 UTC,"Shardik is quite the interesting read. I'm curious as to what you'll make of it, coming at it from a far more.. Dark Tower perspective. I read it a couple years ago and it certainly reframes the Guardians of the Beam in in an interesting light."
TheDarkTower,37r82k,Nimbacinus,2,Fri May 29 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"Right on -- it's a much slower read than King, that's for sure.  Adams' writing is far more dense.  Maybe I'm just adjusting to his writing style, but I have a feeling this one won't finish quickly."
TheDarkTower,37r82k,Nimbacinus,2,Fri May 29 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"It took me a pretty long time to finish it, if I recall properly. It's.. slower than the other Adams I read. That having been said, Watership Down and The Plague Dogs both have a bit of a language barrier to them that Shardik largely lacked.   I think I enjoyed Shardik mostly for the philosophy in it rather than the actual characters or story. It hasn't stuck with me like the other two, but it still is decent. Interesting from a DT perspectve, anyway. :)    I do fear for you going into the Calla, though. And hesitantly push IT, Dracula, Salems' Lot, and H.P. Lovecraft's Complete Works your way. Definitely read Dracula and Salems' Lot back-to-back though. That's an awesome experience."
TheDarkTower,37r82k,Nimbacinus,2,Fri May 29 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks -- I'll do that!  I haven't read ""Dracula"" since college and ""Salem's Lot"" since...long before that.    I read ""IT"" again last year (for the 5th time I think...) and will definitely re-acquaint myself with Lovecraft.  Thanks so much for the recommendations!"
TheDarkTower,37r82k,Idirrtts,2,Fri May 29 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"Salems' Lot reads beautifully as a modern day Dracula. They really complement one another in a wonderful fashion. If you want a good copy of Lovecraft I recommend Klinger's annotated complete works. Lovecraft is a massive chore to get through, but King does draw a bit from him in Calla and with some of the todash Cosmic Horror in general...  I'd be deeply interested in how deep this rabbit hole goes. Doesn't every King book/story relate to DT on some level? Would Hill's NOS4A2 also come into play?"

TheDarkTower,37iy6n,Walican132,3,Thu May 28 23:01:41 2015 UTC,"Raccoon dog:        Not to be confused with the coonhound.   The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides, from the Greek words nukt-, ""night"" + ereutēs, ""wanderer"" + prokuōn, ""before-dog"" [but in New Latin used to mean ""raccoon""] + -oidēs, ""-oid""), also known as the mangut  or _tanuki_, is a canid indigenous to East Asia. It is the only extant species in the genus Nyctereutes. It is considered a basal canid species, resembling ancestral forms of the family. Among the Canidae, the raccoon dog shares the habit of regularly climbing trees only with the North American gray fox, another basal species.    The raccoon dog is named for its resemblance to the raccoon (Procyon lotor), to which it is not closely related.  Native East Asian raccoon dog populations have declined in recent years due to hunting, fur trade, urbanization, an increase of animals associated with human civilization such as pets and abandoned animals, and diseases that may be transmitted between them. [citation needed] Following its introduction into central and western Europe, however, it has been treated as a potentially hazardous invasive species.

TheDarkTower,37cjf7,Valarauco,6,Tue May 26 17:02:18 2015 UTC,Keep reading. Roland's age is one of the fun mysteries of the series.
TheDarkTower,37cjf7,rottinguy,2,Tue May 26 17:36:16 2015 UTC,"IIRC He tells he was fleeing from John Farson for 20 years, and you should also wait for the end of the first book to know more about his age"
TheDarkTower,37cjf7,Idirrtts,1 point,Tue May 26 17:09:01 2015 UTC,"I've read the series already, but I don't recall the 20 years from Farson. Also, what are you referring to when you say at the end of the first book? His chat with Walter?"
TheDarkTower,37cjf7,Idirrtts,1 point,Tue May 26 17:24:45 2015 UTC,"Well, he's ten years older when he wakes up at the end. Also, I don't really recall that bit, I just remember at the end of Wizard and Glass, when Susannah or whatever asks Roland what he did with Maerlyn's grapefruit once he stole it,he replies that he had to flee during 20 years or so because John Farson was after it"
TheDarkTower,37cjf7,Idirrtts,1 point,Thu May 28 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"Nvm, I found the quote (copy paste from ""The Wastelands"") ""“Don’t they? When I was a boy, Eddie, there were maps. I remember one in particular. It was called The Greater Kingdoms of the Western Earth. It showed my land, which was called by the name Gilead. It showed the Downland Baronies, which were overrun by riot and civil war in the year after I won my guns, and the hills, and the desert, and the mountains, and the Western Sea. It was a long distance from Gilead to the Western Sea—a thousand miles or more—but it had taken me over twenty years to cross that distance.”  “That’s impossible,” Susannah said quickly, fearfully. “Even if you walked the whole distance it couldn’t take twenty years.”  “Well, you have to allow for stops to write postcards and drink beer,” Eddie said, but they both ignored him.  “I didn’t walk but rode most of the distance on horseback,” Roland said. “I was—slowed up, shall we say?—every now and then, but for most of that time I was moving. Moving away from John Farson, who led the revolt which toppled the world I grew up in and who wanted my head on a pole in his courtyard—he had good reason to want that, I suppose, since I and my compatriots were responsible for the deaths of a great many of his followers—and because I stole something he held very dear.”"
TheDarkTower,37cjf7,johnnymetoo,2,Tue Jun 16 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is awesome. I wonder if the reference to the grapefruit was added in a later revision? It certainly seems like the time across that desert was stretched due to the whole problem with the Tower, don't you think?"
TheDarkTower,37cjf7,Maple-Whisky,2,Wed Jun 17 03:46:24 2015 UTC,Isn't it a fact that you remember more things from earlier in your life as you get older? note to myself: got to ask that on /r/askscience

Never in all this time did I come across one of these doors between the worlds until I came to the ones on the beach at the edge of the Western Sea.

Im just saying; as someone reading them for the first time, I wouldn't have stopped after 7 and then waited a while and read Keyhole. When you first dive into these books, they can get addicting, and I would have felt weird reading 4.5 right after 7 (like I assume a lot of the first timers asking for read order would be tempted to do). I'm certain that if I hadn't saved the series for so long and had read it before Keyhole came out, I would have been delighted by having a new story from right in the middle."
TheDarkTower,36zh35,zchatham,3,Sat May 23 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely in order. They do not stand on their own at all.

Except for as others have said The Wind Through the Keyhole which you can use your own judgement on whether you want to read it between Books 4 and 5 or after you've finished the series.  I grew up with the series as it came out, so now I can say that after you've read them all it can be fun to just take one of them down randomly and read as a stand alone book. Oftentimes when I'm between new books I'll pull The Wastelands or Wolves of Calla off the shelf and read them on their own.

TheDarkTower,36v0gv,RANDALLFLA666,14,Fri May 22 10:07:50 2015 UTC,The Long Road Home left a sour taste in my mouth so I have avoided the comics. But now that they're finally into the books I should give them a look. On the other hand I find it slightly lame that Eddie is not completely naked.
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,monjoe,9,Fri May 22 14:21:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. That's the moment Roland begins to respect Eddie because of how much bravery it takes to fight naked. The book is rated M already so I'm not sure why they covered him up.
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,Trumbull,3,Fri May 22 14:38:45 2015 UTC,What did you not like about The Long Road Home?
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,monjoe,4,Fri May 22 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"I feel it ruined both Sheemie and the Crimson King. I wanted to believe Sheemie was special just because magic, not from a old machine. And I preferred TCK to be an unfathomable mysterious evil being, not Roland's crazy uncle. An important part of horror is leaving out details and letting the audience use their imagination (the most famous example is the lack of showing the shark in Jaws)."
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,eferoth,20,Fri May 22 18:16:20 2015 UTC,What the hell happened to the art? It was gorgeous right through Gunslinger. This is atrocious.
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,Saijar,21,Fri May 22 15:29:00 2015 UTC,Eddie looks like he is twelve.
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,Sir_Herp_Derp,11,Fri May 22 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Not just that, this artist's interpretation of Roland is so bland and young looking as well. He doesn't even draw him with any stubble or anything."
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,Saijar,3,Fri May 22 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I didn't even really look at Roland. He is really bad! This is such a bummer! I just finished The Stand comic omnibus, and the art in there was fucking great, and have the two big dark tower omnibus sets, and I have glanced at those pics, and they look great... Bummer. I'll still likely get these if they end up in a third omnibus at some point, but wow, ones based on the actual books should be so much better than this."

TheDarkTower,36v0gv,Razanur,2,Fri May 22 11:16:24 2015 UTC,"There are physical copies. I don't think its very popular, two comic stores I visit said they only order it if it's on someone's pull list.  There were 5 issues called The Prisoner that were about Eddie growing up. These issues follow The Drawing of Three book."
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,Mobile_Version,1 point,Fri May 22 11:20:29 2015 UTC,"That probably means there's a trade paperback of The Prisoner then. I'll need to see if I can track that down. I liked the other comics a lot, but honestly comics of the actual books interest me a bit more than backstory, just because I love seeing different interpretations of events."
TheDarkTower,36v0gv,picasso_penis,2,Fri May 22 11:28:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. Although it always stood out to me that Roland began to respect Eddie for going into battle naked. However I don't mind that they gave him boxers for this scene.

TheDarkTower,36rpoa,thejpn,7,Thu May 21 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to speak freely of spoilers for the first book, so no worries about later volumes.  I just finished reading the revised and expanded edition again for the first time since 2003 or 2004. It's been so long since I've read either version that I came at it with fresh eyes. It certainly fits much better with the later volumes. The additions mostly feel organic and help tie it into the later books. That said, it still feels disjointed from the other works, but that's an artifact of its creation more than anything.   By the Greedo-esque, I'm sure they mean the death of Allie. That change has never bothered me. I don't think it makes Roland any more redeemable having him put Allie out of the insane misery that Walter's trap put her in, because ultimately Roland still slaughters the town without a second thought. Perhaps even worse is that he views such events as mere obstacles laid in his path by Walter. His studied detachment is more horrific. In the original he fires on her without thought.   If anything, I'd have preferred if King continued on and revised Drawing of the Three as well, as that one now feels like the odd one out. Three through seven hang much more together."
TheDarkTower,36rpoa,wbhoy,3,Thu May 21 16:55:32 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how you think he could revise DotT and why you think that one feels removed?  Besides vernacular, the act of the drawings and flow of the story seems so linear and it's such a beautiful book.  I really don't want to see that one re-done with an overload of references to 19, or stuffing in more words like dinh or ka-mai... Just don't think it's necessary.  I understood it for the first, but the second?  Harder sell."
TheDarkTower,36rpoa,pinhead80,2,Fri May 22 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"I guess largely because the book was never copyedited when it was published by Grant. The book is rife with errors that wouldn't take much to fix, though minor is all.   I agree that the drawings and flow are great as is. There is little narratively that needs to be changed. I suppose, mostly, it is the vernacular issues that stuck out on my last reread. King was still in the midst of his world-building, and it'd be interesting to see what he would tweak if he were to go over it again, knowing what he does now.   The nineteen stuff did seem a bit overboard at the time. Spoilers After the end of the Gunslinger, the drop off makes some sense. With the passage of time after that book and Roland's aging, its made pretty clear that Ro' has forgotten more about Mid-World than we ever learn in the course of eight novels. I don't think King would have to shoehorn that in. Same with his confusion about the Crimson King in book four..   I agree with you though that the second needs it much less than the first. I suppose the disjointedness fits with the later themes of the series, given events in the latter books. I suppose my strong affinity for the series makes me long for a smoother whole.   I'm starting my first read of the Drawing of the Three in over ten years soon, so my opinion might change!"
TheDarkTower,36rpoa,wbhoy,2,Fri May 22 00:39:09 2015 UTC,"Listen to it (them) all as audiobooks. Frank Muller does something so amazing with those stories that makes them so much richer.

TheDarkTower,36rpoa,disinfoAGENT,1 point,Fri May 22 04:50:21 2015 UTC,"Agree absolutely. Muller was a rare and special talent. Thinking about Muller recently was in part what got me set on this current reread. He also did a superlative reading of Moby Dick also. He made the chapters about ropes magical, ha."
TheDarkTower,36rpoa,wbhoy,2,Fri May 22 12:30:52 2015 UTC,"Good insight and thanks for not spoiling anything. With the fact that Gunslinger was originally short stories, the gaps in writing and publishing, and the fact that King didn't really have the story planned out I can see how the earlier novels would be different or out of place compared to the later ones.   I love the series so far and plan on reading the original version of the Gunslinger when I do an inevitable re-read of the series."
TheDarkTower,36rpoa,wbhoy,3,Thu May 21 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good idea to read the original at some point. I think King is harder on it than the fans are. It was, after all, the book that hooked me and that was because of its strangeness and mystery, its evocativeness."
TheDarkTower,36rpoa,jon_slush,3,Thu May 21 17:54:36 2015 UTC,"I recently read the original for the first time 3 years after reading the revised edition for the first time and a few months after finishing the series. From my perspective, I wish I had read the original before the rest of the series and read the revised version after. The revised edition contains a lot of references that are only later touched upon toward the end of the series. They felt out of place and confused the heck out of me when I read them for the first time and almost turned me off of the series all together. To me the original feels more ""pure"" with some of the same atmosphere and sterility I felt when reading The Road."
TheDarkTower,36rpoa,wbhoy,3,Thu May 21 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"I found quite a few references confusing but I figured that he was planting seeds that would probably pay out in later books so I didn't worry too much.   I'm a fan of reference coming up later. One of my big complaints with Harry Potter is that horcruxes, literally the most important magical concept to the late story, aren't mentioned once until the later books. I think even an offhand mention of them in a class would have been rewarding and tied the series together more."
TheDarkTower,36ptyk,krails,5,Thu May 21 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the Tower and as much as I try and find meaning in real world events that can relate to the Tower, I just don't see it."
TheDarkTower,36ptyk,TheFifthBox,5,Thu May 21 04:53:13 2015 UTC,Its just an example of the extreme level of finger dexterity and coordination. Its a visual representation to help better imagine Roland's fingers moving so well.

TheDarkTower,36kdde,Empire_Lifts_Back,17,Wed May 20 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that even though WTTK is set between books 4 and 5, people shouldn't read it until after book 7, as it's written to the perspective of someone who has already read the whole series. But I understand if others feel differently.  Characters from Salem's Lot, Hearts in Atlantis, and Insomnia become big players in the rest of the books. You don't necessarily have to read them to enjoy the rest of the Tower series, but if you have the time and desire, it could improve the whole experience.  Like others have said, there are so many references to the DT series in his other books, it's hard to list them all. One of the better ones I enjoyed was in The Talisman Black House (which came out between books 4 and 5, IIRC).  Whatever you decide enjoy the ride!"
TheDarkTower,36kdde,Gunslinger_,5,Wed May 20 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"I read WTTK between books 4 and 5 and it didn't seem to take away from my experience at all.  I liked how it expanded my knowledge of the world that was being presented, and how it added more to the story of Flagg.    It should be noted that the Dark Tower was my first foray into any of Stephen King's work aside from films based on his books."

TheDarkTower,36kdde,BritishHobo,1 point,Wed May 20 14:02:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for it. I read it between 4 and 5 and I thought it fit in pretty well.  Also I'd give Salem's Lot, Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis and Everything's Eventual (the short story, not the collection) a read before you carry on."
TheDarkTower,36kdde,BritishHobo,1 point,Wed May 20 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm another who read WTTK before Wolves of the Calla. Unless I missed something obvious (which, to be fair, is likely), it didn't ruin anything for me in terms of the rest of the series. Also it felt nice to have that section of the story expanded upon before the definitive 'end'."
TheDarkTower,36kdde,J_Strange,3,Wed May 20 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"""Little Sisters"" is a kind of a prequel, since it takes place after the flashback events in book 4, and ""Keyhole"" is more of a ""mid-quel."" Story-wise, it takes place between books 4 and 5. It's been a while since I've read either one, but I don't think that either of them spoil anything in books 5-7, and ""Sisters"" was published before books 5-7 were. I would think that either can be read in any order.   To avoid spoilers, yes, other characters from King's other novels play a part. The DT series, as King has said, kind of contains all of his other fiction and the books have lots of references to other books, and his other books have lots of references to the series. You can enjoy the DT series without having read the other novels, although some of the other novels may be spoiled by the events in the DT series."
TheDarkTower,36kdde,J_Strange,2,Wed May 20 01:04:27 2015 UTC,"But, as far the Roland's origin story is concerned, the events of Keyhole happen before or after the events of Little Sisters?"
TheDarkTower,36kdde,Mayday72,2,Wed May 20 02:45:17 2015 UTC,"Part of it happens right after the main quest part of book 4, and part of is a story that takes place before ""Sisters."" And part is just a story. It's that kind of book."
TheDarkTower,36kdde,connor726,3,Wed May 20 05:02:37 2015 UTC,A Wind through the Keyhole is basically a stand-alone book. It doesn't really add anything to the series and you could read it without reading any of the Dark Tower books.  To be honest I'm not sure why it was to be placed after Wizard and Glass...but I did enjoy it.
TheDarkTower,36kdde,crashdemon,1 point,Wed May 20 01:08:46 2015 UTC,"Mostly because it has thematic elements related to Roland's past, and those are best read after W&G because you're used to that type of setting/writing. It doesn't really matter though, in my opinion they can be read in any order."

TheDarkTower,36kdde,Damien__,2,Wed May 20 02:56:21 2015 UTC,I have posted my thoughts on the dark tower and gotten a lot of positive response on it so here goes  The book The Wind Through the Keyhole is a DT book came out dead last after TDT was supposedly finished but is supposed to be read as book 4.5 (between 4 and 5) however...  If you haven't read The Dark Tower before then I suggest you read Wind Through the Keyhole last. If you are on a re-read of TDT then read Wind at book 4.5 like it should be. The reason is that by the end of book three all the major players are there and healthy. Then Wizard and Glass takes you away from what you know to be the main story. Reading yet another book right after WaG that has nothing to do with the main story might make a person lose interest. Though good WaG was huge and add in Wind and you get a LOT of pages that aren't dealing with the main ka-tet. On a re-read this will not be a problem  Little Sisters... can be read anywhere but takes place prior to The Gunslinger  IMHO of course

TheDarkTower,36kdde,JohnMcL7,1 point,Wed May 20 14:56:43 2015 UTC,If you are sure of that and that you will finish the series then WTTK is a great read at either the end OR at 4.5. Personally I read it at 4.5
TheDarkTower,36ekz3,Maple-Whisky,3,Mon May 18 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"If you are past book 4 then you don't have anything to worry about as far as spoilers, I would also wait until you finish the books before you jump into the comics.

(I can't think of any spoilers in the comics if you are past book 4 but I bet there may still be small ones in there) I know the first few arcs really cement all of the back story with Gilead and Jericho hill and fills in some gaps that King has not written

Have Roland start with the horn and present it as an alternate time line, hitting similar beats but fleshing out other parts of the story. Catch Jake this time around and see the ripples that would cause, maybe spending more time dealing with the training of the Tet. Perhaps do Mordred differently, give Walter a better send off.   I'm sure Sai King would have a better idea of what to with it but I'd read the hell out of it.  I'd certainly rather it be it's own thing, a continuation of the existing story rather than changing the ""official"" story to an edited version.   And hell yes to a Tet Corporation story."

TheDarkTower,36405k,JordyVerrill,14,Sat May 16 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"No. This would be a BIG mistake. He created this. He put it out there. It's his baby, but he released it unto his audience. It is not his any longer. It has it's own life and cannot be erased. At best he could write sequels to the revised gunslinger (which I consider the last, not first, book of the series). The (original) Gunslinger will always be the first book for me. Even in this, it would be a mistake. Sounds grim, but Roland should have never reached the Tower."

As for re writing the series with things different as a continuation after the revised book one, think about people who haven't read the series yet, just pretend you never heard of it and someone suggested it...  Then you look and see there is two sets of books that repeat, two major problems:   Would probably be a major giveaway of the ending with the whole time loop thing, that's the big surprise at the end ruined. and evening would tell the series to fuck off, in not buying two sets of the same series, sounds like a rip off.   I'd love another book in the series though, he could do the tet corporation book and it could sit between two books like wind through the keyhole, any excuse to her back to mid world, but not a rewrite."
TheDarkTower,36405k,SPNR128,3,Sat May 16 09:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see, not a reworking, but a continuation of sorts. At the end of VII, the story starts back from the beginning of The Gunslinger. Presumably, Roland has relived the same actions countless times, always starting over when he walks through the door at the top of the Tower. I'd like to see one final journey, but one where Roland and our ka-tet complete the journey, and save the beams, securing a future for all worlds. That's just my take on it, though.   Edited: autocorrect sucks"
TheDarkTower,36405k,cosmovern71,1 point,Sat May 16 05:18:58 2015 UTC,I don't think he should revise the original versions.  However I do think that he could do a new version that starts wight him throwing open the door at the top of the tower and stepping through and him appearing at a different time other than in the desert.  This time he might start out right out after the battle of Jericho Hill or even before it.

TheDarkTower,36405k,sirrzilla,1 point,Sat May 16 11:25:36 2015 UTC,"King has said on more than occasion that the felt the books as published were more like first drafts than finished product.  Back in the day, in the early 80s, he talked about how this was going to be his masterwork series, and had plans to go 15 books with it. (I'd love to cite a source, but haven't found one to back it up online)  I felt his inclusion in the published story didn't really fit, and spoke more to why he didn't work on the series like he planned, and that his own mortality was why he pushed to put an ending to it. Probably not ""the"" ending he envisioned, but some ending nevertheless.  I think that if he went back to retell the story with his envisioned ending, it could easily work as the second half of the tale he wanted to tell. But, I don't see it happening, between his age now and how much it seems to take for him to totally open the Pandora's box of the DT story."
TheDarkTower,36405k,Mongo97,1 point,Sat May 16 15:18:10 2015 UTC,"15 books totally makes sense to me.

Then  another 2 parts of MM followed, and then there were 30 years silence from George Miller. Until he made MM:Fury Road, which is not a sequel, nor a reboot. Just a new story about MM.  I don't really think the Dark Tower could be tamed and pressed into a ""movie"" or 3 movies. A series produced by HBO, etc. and with SK involved in the process should do the job, I imagine."

TheDarkTower,362dtj,darniil,14,Fri May 15 14:52:52 2015 UTC,"read the series as a DT virgin.  then read the stand, salems lot, insomnia, and hearts in atlantis.   then read the DT series again.  and then again.  and again every couple years after that."
TheDarkTower,362dtj,echof0xtrot,1 point,Sat May 16 01:55:27 2015 UTC,^ totally this
TheDarkTower,362dtj,beldarin,7,Sat May 16 14:37:07 2015 UTC,I didn't and you really don't have to.
TheDarkTower,362dtj,kadmylos,5,Fri May 15 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"I would suggest reading at least ""The Stand"" and ""Salem's Lot"" before your journey to The Dark Tower begins. They're entertaining reads and help with the mythology of the DT Universe.  Of course, it's not strictly required. The DT series on its own is plenty interesting and easy to understand.   EDIT: Also, read the ""Revised & Expanded"" version on ""The Stand"". It's a bit more Tower-related than the original release. :)"
TheDarkTower,362dtj,spent9109,3,Fri May 15 15:52:35 2015 UTC,The Eyes of the Dragon and The Talisman touch on characters from DT as well.
TheDarkTower,362dtj,TheSporkening,3,Fri May 15 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"True. However, OP could get through the entire DT series without having read ""EotD"" & ""TT"" and it would still make sense.   On the other hand, because of where a certain train makes its last stop and religious person in a small besieged town, I'd say that reading ""Salem's Lot"" & ""The Stand"" are a bit more integral to the overall story."
TheDarkTower,362dtj,spent9109,2,Fri May 15 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"You'll get no argument from me, and I meant none above. I simply wanted to expand on your answer. I meant exactly what I said."
TheDarkTower,362dtj,TheSporkening,2,Fri May 15 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"No argument from me, sai. Like you was just expanding my thoughts. :)"
TheDarkTower,362dtj,spent9109,2,Fri May 15 19:45:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe not The Talisman, but reading it first and then getting to Blaine gives a kind of a deja vu to Jack & Richard's train ride."
TheDarkTower,362dtj,invol713,2,Fri May 15 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"I read Salem's Lot and IT before starting the dark tower. I'm glad I read both, though I'd particularly recommend at least Salem's Lot. Various Salem's Lot plot points are actively spoiled in DT 5.  I also stopped after book 5 to read Hearts in Atlantis, and I'm really glad I did. It offers some really cool insights into the things that happen in the last two books. I'd also recommend reading the (very) short story Everything's Eventual (from the collection of the same name) before starting book 6.  I read The Stand after finishing DT, and that was fine, although I definitely missed out on certain references. I'd say it's worth reading before getting to DT 4 only if you want to read it anyway (it's great!), i.e. not just as something to 'get through' first.  Some people may mention Insomnia. In my opinion, it would be cool to have read it before starting DT 7, but it's not necessary. I read it afterwards."
TheDarkTower,362dtj,futurityverb,1 point,Fri May 15 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to read any before starting The Dark Tower, but if you end up being hooked, you'll probably want to read the other novels that are related, preferably before DT3. In my opinion, there are three novels that would add significantly to your DT experience: Salem's Lot, The Eyes of the Dragon, and The Stand. These because they feature characters who have a significant role in the DT series, so it would be useful to be familiar with them. Another one, Insomnia, acts as a kind of supplement and I think helps make certain parts of DT7 make more sense.  As for the other connected books, I think their appeal is more on the level of easter eggs than material that adds significantly to one's appreciation of the Tower. But I think it's interesting to read them because of how consumed King became with the Dark Tower and how much of it crept into ostensibly unrelated books."
TheDarkTower,362dtj,ElSaborAsiatico,1 point,Fri May 15 22:31:58 2015 UTC,I would at least read The Stand and Salem's Lot because both of them share major characters with The Dark Tower. You might also want to read IT and Eyes of The Dragon.
TheDarkTower,362dtj,N4U534,1 point,Sat May 16 03:43:17 2015 UTC,My very first King book was The Gunslinger. I then of course read the whole series. Now I have read about 15 of his books and it just makes the initial journey to the tower just as fun because you catch all the connections and easter eggs in his other books. I dont think you really need to stop and read other things in between to get the full story. I personally could not stop in the middle of a series to read another novel and then go back to the series.
TheDarkTower,362dtj,steebin,1 point,Sat May 16 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"I read the Stand and Salems Lot before the DT, and I would recommend doing the same.   I'm currently about a quarter into Hearts in Atlantis and liking it a lot, so I would recommend doing the same."

TheDarkTower,3602f2,SkoldpaddaCommala,2,Thu May 14 23:19:34 2015 UTC,"This is a mere opinion: I think Roland is stuck in a loop. I don't know if it's because of his obsession or is his destiny as the last of his kind. They do mention that ka has no more influence over them past this point... so I don't know. But it seems that the horn is important.  ""The blast of a great horn replied, not from the tower itself but from the roses that lay in the carpet all around it. That horn was the voices of the roses, and cried him welcome with a kingly blast. In my dreams the horn was always mine, he thought, I should have known better, for mine was lost with Cuthbert, at Jericho Hill.  A voice whispered from above him: It would have been the work of three seconds to bend and pick it up. Even in the smoke and death. Three seconds. Time, Roland- it always comes back to that.""   When the book finishes, with the same scene from the beginning, this time he has the horn with him. When he climbed the dark tower, somehow he changed his life by taking those 3 seconds to grab the horn. Maybe it was King who worked his magic again. Either way, it may be an indication that maybe this is the last time he has to repeat the story, this time he may break the loop. Maybe the next time he reaches the tower, with the horn with him -unlike before-, he may find peace at last.  I'm not sure if that answer your question. The horn bit was a detail my husband helped me to see, and this is his theory. Hope it helps you as it helped me!"
TheDarkTower,3602f2,MeleWolf,2,Fri May 15 11:13:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Yes, I had a similar understanding with the horn and Roland's journey; the newest iteration of his cycle for the Tower could be his last. I just don't understand why the Tower sends him back to the same moment each time. I'm not even sure it actually sends him back there, or just simply gives him a sense of detachment at that exact point. Meh, maybe it means nothing! =p"
TheDarkTower,3602f2,MeleWolf,2,Fri May 15 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"Ah... who knows. I may have the timeline all wrong, but maybe in that moment, chasing the man in black, is when his quest is not about Gilead anymore but only to climb the tower? He's all alone. I'm really not sure that the detachment feeling is something but the transition. Sorry, I'm not being really helpful."
TheDarkTower,3602f2,Rumptiddliey,2,Fri May 15 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"The way I interpreted it was that Roland has been on this journey many times, possibly each time missing something or doing something that would ultimately lead his quest to fail.  With the loop of Ka done this time around, at the end when Roland is transported back to the beginning of his quest where we meet him, he has possibly the final thing he needed - the horn of Eld.  With his father's gun, one of the roses and the horn, he will be able to complete his quest."
TheDarkTower,3602f2,Rumptiddliey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""one of the roses""?"
TheDarkTower,3602f2,TheSilverBeetle,2,Sat Jun 6 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't explain myself very well, sorry.  When Roland reaches the door to the tower, he lays his remaining gun and the rose he picked outside the tower at the door. The symbols change from Unfound to Found and opens. What I read in to the ending was that once Roland completes his journey to the tower again, he'll open the door with either one or both of his father's guns, a rose picked from outside the tower and the Horn of Eld, which will allow him to finally complete his quest."
TheDarkTower,35y5mv,MathTheUsername,6,Thu May 14 14:22:23 2015 UTC,"Ya know, this is a good question. I tried hunting around the interwebs and found that Roland's hat is quite the thing of mystery. It kinda appears and disappears, so I'm apt to think it's a continuity error, although the mention that his horn and hat are gone in the beginning of The Gunslinger was likely mentioned on purpose.  He's given a hat later in the books (spoilers...?), but that one also kinda fluxes in and out of existence too. I think maybe King had a hard time getting the ""Cowboy"" image of Roland out of his head enough to keep straight when he had and didn't have a hat."
TheDarkTower,35y5mv,aumnren,1 point,Thu May 14 16:57:25 2015 UTC,"Spoilers?  ""continuity error"" lol, maybe it's like the horn."
TheDarkTower,35y5mv,The_greatest_tale,2,Thu May 14 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe he got a ""cheap"" hat? So with ""his own hat"" his new one, and not the original one is meant?"

Just as with the constellations, the pair of galaxies only appears like a rose because we are viewing it from Earth. If we could hop on over to a neighbouring galaxy and look at the same pair, it's very unlikely they'd look like a rose anymore.  Now if it'd turn out that the strands of galaxies that appear to form the fabric of known space are actually just part of the molecules of the core of the rose as it's blooming, that'd be really something.  Here is Hubble's source imagery where you can download high resolution pictures of the galaxy pair up to 120 MB."
