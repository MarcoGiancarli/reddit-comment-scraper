gurrenlagann,3drxz2,Desril,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"Well, in the series the Spiral Nemesis is an ambiguous event. In the TTGL movies, it it clearly and unambiguously a hypermassive black hole caused by a chain reaction of powerful spiral users turning into galaxies."

gurrenlagann,3drxz2,Ferdi265,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:15:51 2015 UTC,My Theory (moar alternative endings for EVA): After 3rd impact civilisation collapses and humans flee to underground cities (e.g. geofronts like the one under Tokyo3) ... <insert Gurren Lagann here>
gurrenlagann,3drxz2,cloudflow,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:37 2015 UTC,"Major EoE and TTGL spoilers ahead  I think the two fit together somehow, but the issue is after third impact end of all life on earth was destroyed.  The only people that survived were those who remembered their sense of individuality while a part of the ""Hive Mind.""  even then, Shinji and Asuka awoke on an entire planet of red water and rocks, so it's unknown if they could have survived.  personally, I think as more people recovered from third impact the earth gradually receded from its apocalyptic state back into the desert planet we see in TTGL.  In order to preserve humanity in case of another Angel attack, Shinji Ikari, war hero of the Impact, ordered mankind underground and took for himself a new name-Lordgenome."
gurrenlagann,3drxz2,cloudflow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"But in Parallel Works 8 we see Lordgenome as a child receiving a Lagann unit and building up civilization, before leading it against the Anti-Spiral as a muscular young man.  However, Lazengann being a re-purposed Eva Unit 01 is a compelling tie."
gurrenlagann,3drxz2,condor216,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"Well, then maybe he's not Shinji, but perhaps Laganns are S2 engines re-outfitted by the survivors of Third Impact to be more practical in what they discover is a never ending fight vs the anti-spiral angels-perhaps a ""customizable Eva line"" where the head and S2 engine are separate from the body.  Of course, Lordgenome made the body models mass producible and raised his beastmen using S2.  Which technically makes Rei the first beastman.  Now this is getting fun."
gurrenlagann,3drxz2,Gurren_Slamgan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, I like the Rei beastman idea. Which leads me to two thoughts.   When Yui Ikari is cloned using this method, the result is a lookalike but with blue hair and red eyes. Lordgenome made his ""children"" after he was getting bored- there were no living surface humans at that time. This, combined with that he sees them as dolls but his ""children"" nonetheless means they are likely made from his own genetic material.   Given the physical appearance of Nia, we can therefore conclude that Lordgenome is a close descendant of Shinji, maybe even his son or grandson. This is made more plausible by the fact that Lordgenome led earth's forces- an unlikely feat based solely on him being charismatic and good at fighting. Remember, the whole world's survivors were ready for revenge and a fight, unlike in TTGL where Kamina was the leader of the only small group brave enough to fight which slowly grew. Lordgenome must therefore have had some other claim to a leadership role. Being the heir of humanity's war hero and savior (basically the Morpheus of Third Impact leading others out of the goo) would certainly help with that."
gurrenlagann,3drxz2,condor216,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:26:41 2015 UTC,"MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR ANY OF THESE SHOWS!  The Gainax timeline:  Gunbuster 1 (roughly until ep. 4)  Evangelion  (The eva movies start with the show and run parallel to this and do not, so far, loop back onto the main timeline.)  Gunbuster 1 ep. 5 & 6 (except the very end)  FLCL  Gunbuster 2  end of the last ep. of Gunbuster 1  Kill La Kill  Gurren Lagann  This begins with First Impact, a seed of Lilith accidentally colliding with a planet that contained a seed of Adam, on what came to be known as earth. The seed of Adam contains life the seed of Lilith contains knowledge. The First Ancestral Race separated Adam and Lilith to prevent the awesome destructive force of which combination is capable, two paths intertwined into a double helix.  Fast forward a few million years, the earth is under siege from a space fairing insect plague. The insect aliens roam the galaxy feeding on the life force within seeds of Adam. Humanity creates technolgical marvels to stop these creatures, the gunbusters.  Seele finds the dead sea scrolls, instructions on how to use and operate the seeds of Adam and Lilith along with their kill switch mechanisms (the Longinus Spears) and begin to use this knowledge to further their own ends. Ikari Gendo manages to orchestrate Third Impact, the reduction of all of humanity into LCL forming one joined collective conciseness, so that he can be with his (not) dead wife who was inside of Eva01. Shinji, Gendo's son and the pilot of Eva01 rejected the joining of every mind turning everyone human again.   After Third Impact humanity gained a surge of forward momentum. Meanwhile, due to the effects of time dilation gunbuster 01 and 02 where on their return trip back to earth from their sortie to fight the space bugs. when gunbuster returns many years have passed technology has grown exponentially due to the shared understanding of every living human. The gunbuster team has succeed in its final mission, to destroy the alien hive, but gunbuster did not make it back.  Centuries later a mysterious corporation emerges on earth and the off world colonies medical mechanica has placed factories to literally iron the wrinkles of planets. A girl on a yellow vespa weilding a gutiar uses an extra dimensional portal in the forehead of a 15 year old kid in a japanese suburb to bring Atomsk, the pirate king, to earth to stop them.  Many more centuries after that a troop of space cops inducts a robot posing as a human girl on mars. The robot is the central control core of the solar system defense grid that went haywire and began to attack earth with defense drones. The robot idolizes the legend of the gunbuster pilots and their founder, Noriko. After the robot understands her true purpose she sacrifices herself to save earth, just before Noriko returns to earth in the first gunbuster.(due to massive time dilation)  Meanwhile, Planet after planet across the eons is consumed by a force that is the product of the combination of Adam and Lilith. This life form harvests energy from planets by granting the life on the planet knowledge through skin contact with the most viable species of the planet. The maturation process mimics the path of the fastest growing, erratic species known, humans. The life form, known as life fibers, is beaten on one planet by cooperation between life fibers and humans.  Later, the planet that resisted life fibers has caught the eye of the First Ancestral Race for growing uncontrollably fast. The FAR as before seeks to control the disastrous power of entropy by destroying any race that possess spiral energy and the knowledge to use it. A simple soldier rises up to fight the FAR. The soldier learns of the fate that will befall the universe if he wins, he betrays his comrades. The soldier, now a king, subjugates his own kind to avoid the wrath of the FAR. Later, the king, then a soldier again, will join his might to another, who will destroy the FAR and the menace of the spiral."

It was so off-putting I debated not watching the show anymore, and it turns out I wasn't the only one. After finishing, I encouraged my friends to watch as well, and the majority of them dropped out after watching episode 4. I told them the story behind episode 4 and to just watch the next episode at least, and after watching episode 5 they were hooked again.  I feel like episode 4 was a huge mistake, not necessarily by changing the art style and tone, but by placing such an off-putting episode so early in the show where people are not completely invested in it, where people will worry if the rest of the show will be like that as well."

gurrenlagann,3d15wb,8reathalyser,2,Sun Jul 12 18:13:53 2015 UTC,Are these dubbed yet?
gurrenlagann,3d15wb,neverseenLOTR-AMA,6,Sun Jul 12 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the movies are not dubbed. If it helps, I can tell you that it is 100% worth watching them. They are around 2 hours each, equalling about 4 hours. They are both a step down because it takes out whole episodes worth of content (mostly being filler though), but also a huge step forward because of how much new content is added. In summary, the movies are compressed versions of the whole anime that I would recommend to any Gurren Lagann fan (or someone who doesn't have time to watch 30ish episodes)."
gurrenlagann,3d15wb,8reathalyser,6,Sun Jul 12 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"Most people would recommend that you watch the TV series first.  Not only is it better paced, it also covers content that the movies left out. (The movies were mostly written with viewers of the TV series in mind.)"

gurrenlagann,3d15wb,JimtheChicken,3,Wed Jul 15 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"I watch it on Netflix every now and then, and always skip the recap episode, but also sometimes the bath house episode. It's the edited-for-Japanese-kids'-TV version, so a lot of little but wonderful character moments are cut along with the ""taboo"" bits. In my opinion, it makes that episode almost insubstantial. The lead-in for the next episode does a decent enough job of filling in the gaps between Episode 5 and Episode 7, so Episode 6 is occasionally sacrificed if I'm marathoning the whole series.  I actually like episode 4's visual anomalies."

gurrenlagann,3cg8mi,watwat,3,Wed Jul 8 04:59:54 2015 UTC,I'll have to give it a shot. I tend to be wary of american cartoons because I find they tend to pander more to a younger audience with no real substance to them. But I'm more than willing to try anything.
gurrenlagann,3cg8mi,KingNier,3,Wed Jul 8 06:28:43 2015 UTC,"It's similar to Adventure Time, in that it's ostensibly a show aimed at kids/young adults, but can also be easily enjoyed by adults. If you can make it to either ""Giant Woman"" or ""So Many Birthdays"" without getting hooked, it's probably not your cup of tea. That's just my opinion though.    E: Also, if you can get caught up by July 13th then you'll be just in time for the new episodes :D"

gurrenlagann,3bsf04,mike495,3,Wed Jul 1 20:18:02 2015 UTC,Then why is he so surprised to see how Simon is piloting Gurren Lagann?
gurrenlagann,3bsf04,mike495,11,Thu Jul 2 08:12:34 2015 UTC,He didnt see anyone die and thought kamina was fighting him the entire time.
gurrenlagann,3bsf04,Jeffeffery,12,Fri Jul 3 02:15:56 2015 UTC,"He's mostly surprised because Simon had been defeating him since Kamina died. He had been assuming that since Gurren Lagann had been beating him, Kamina must have somehow survived to pilot it. Viral had a lot of respect for Kamina as a warrior, but only ever saw Simon as a child."
gurrenlagann,3bsf04,Wampastampa,2,Wed Jul 1 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"How could he think he had survived if he saw how Tymilph pierced a fukin' giant spear right through Gurren? And also, he wasn't there to see the Giga Drill Breaker"
gurrenlagann,3bsf04,Wampastampa,5,Thu Jul 2 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"He didn't see him actually die, thats how. Viral is hit away immediately after they stab him and like he said Viral assumes he is being beaten by Kamina the whole time after that. You can pierce a mech with a giant spear and not kill the pilot. It works in many mech anime."

It also features destructible terrain and physics! (destroy the bottom of the structure the whole structure will fall and can crush players) Now onto why the Kamina head is in the game, (There's also a female Yoko head) it was actually a trend I had accidentally started on the forums for the game by wearing the famous Kamina Glasses, nobody else caught on so I went to one of the forum game threads which is called ""Make a wish and ruin someone elses"". I wished for everyone to wear Kamina Glasses and it was actually granted, it ended up in half of the forum wearing them as well as introducing people to the series. Here is a picture that kind of sums it up. Just wanted to share this moment since I found it pretty amusing."

Fans came to interpret the starting scene as a kind of ""bad"" alternate universe where Simon becomes more of a warlord and embarks on the path toward the Spiral nemesis (the biggest clue being the parallels/contrast between the lines of ""All the lights in the sky are our enemies"" vs. ""All the lights in the sky are stars [...] stars where are Spiral cousins are waiting for us."" I kind of remember an interview where the creators accept this as a valid interpretation.  None of this will spoil you for the movies, which fairly closely follow the same plot, except for an extension to the final battle(s)."

People call him ""GarlickSimon"" I don't know why xD. And dont worry, it's not a spoiler for the two films xD"
gurrenlagann,3b5x29,tidier,3,Fri Jun 26 09:09:15 2015 UTC,"You probably mean ""Garlock Simon""? It's because he bears resemblance (and is very likely a homage to) this guy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Pirate_Captain_Harlock. Garlock a portmanteau of Harlock and ""Gar"", a made-up word popular among the anime-watching community at the time that TTGL was airing, which more or less means ""manly to that point that it would not be surprising to be gay for him"". See http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gar for details on the latter.  Of course, once Simon turns out not to head down that path, and instead acquires his iconic Star-shaped glasses toward the end, the anime-watching community aptly rechristened him Captain Starlock."

The series was adapted into an animated television series in 1978 directed by Rintaro and produced by Toei Animation. A computer-animated film adaptation of the same name premiered in 2013.   The series follows the titular Captain, an outcast turned space pirate after he rebelled against Earth's Government and humanity's general apathy.

He had seen the impossible happen again and again, but still acted as if he lived in a completely different world than he knew himself to live in.

He never did any of the ""bad"" things he did out of hatred or malice. When it turns out he was wrong and that he almost sentenced his best friend to death, he went to fucking  KILL HIMSELF.

Rossiu was just a guy that operated under logic and reason in a world where if you're determined enough you can tell the laws of physics to fuck off.

You won't know if what you did was right or wrong until it's too late. But put yourself in Rossiu's shoes, raised in a pit run by a cult where people have to die for others to survive? Being thrust into the open world of the surface and instantly caught up in battles where he feels helpless and unable to do anything? He is instantly thrown into Simon's shadow, same age, but Simon can pilot Lagann and can defeat beastmen and even defeated Lord Genome without a gunmen.  All Rossiu wants to do is do right by humanity, just like Lord Genome did, though that doesn't mean the way they went about it was correct. I personally don't hate a single character in this show, every main character has meaning or a good quality or two. AND if Rossiu wasn't like this, we wouldn't have gotten the best punch in anime history and that would be a damn crying shame. Even if it wasn't in the movies."

My point was that he was doing what he thought was right, not what I thought was right. Characters are real people in their universe so they should be treated like a real person in discussions like these, I'm not saying I would have done the same thing, but Rossiu did, he justified his reasoning and relented doing it even after Simon forgave him. Every action a character takes in a story like this is for the progression/hindrance of the plot, it was necessary for it to happen so that Rossiu could grow as a character and Simon could show the audience his resolve and how he has grown to be similar to Kamina, since he did give Rossiu one epic punch just like Kamina did before he died."

And in retrospect, I like him a lot now that I'm actually done with the series. In fact, he might actually be one of my favorite anime characters in general.  Remember that, pre-Time Skip, he was one of the only people that didn't lose his faith in Simon after Kamina died. Even Yoko seemed to have given up on Simon, for reference. Rossiu didn't do much to help Simon out of his depression, true, but that was because he didn't know what to say that wouldn't make it worse. And he did help Simon out quite a lot in other ways by co-piloting Gurren Lagan before the time skip. His faith seems pretty shaken after the Anti-Spiral shit starts up, but who wouldn't be shaken by that? And Rossiu did deeply regret everything he did, to the point he tried to kill himself over it. I'd argue he never stopped being loyal to Simon, at least not entirely. Besides, Simon clearly forgave him, so I see no reason that the fanbase shouldn't."

""I thought it sucked! It was just a bunch of cliches strung together!""    The problem with Eva is that it was massively influential on the Japanese anime industry. It's turned into one of those nexus points, where basically every anime that came afterwards can trace some of its influence to NGE. As a result, some of it feels kind of stale and cliche, but that's mostly because it created the cliches out of nothing.  I strongly recommend watching it - it's still quite good, and it's important to watch in order to understand everything that came afterwards.

He dips in and out of anime, was looking for something new, and I thought that the short nature of the series (he tends to lose interest quickly) paired with the sheer awesomeness of it would be a good fit. He was started to get into the plot, but found the little anime-isms too much for him. You know; when the art style will change to highlight an emotional shift, the infamous sweat drop, those sorts of things. They got in the way, he argued, of what he considered to be the serious, robot-fighting meat of the show.  He then decided, about five episodes in, that the show was going nowhere. Instead of looking at the low episode count as an enticement to enjoy a finite story, he saw it as an indictment that the series couldn't POSSIBLY escalate enough to be interesting in such a short time. Ahem. Long story short, he was on the verge of quitting out. I persuaded him, as a last farewell, to humour me and watch the final episode, just to see if the series hadn't gone anywhere. That was an interesting little jaunt.  ""Why are Kamina's glasses shaped like that now?""  (With regards to Viral) ""Isn't that the main bad guy?""  (With regards to Nia, Lordgenome, and a whole bunch, actually) ""Who the fuck is that?""  (Reaction to the I've Got The Best Wife In the Universe Swing) ""Nice""  The fact is, he was spouting a lot of shit about the nature of the show, but he did it based on what he knew. The source of most of his gripes about the show, as well as the ones you raised, is ignorance. And that's fine. If you're not enjoying the show anyway, there's not much point in watching it to the end so you can better articulate what it is you dislike - even if there's a chance you might enjoy it by the end.

Also, inserting GIGA DRILL BREAKS everywhere (Arc Gurren Lagann gets one, STTGL gets one, Anti-Spiral gets one...) is creatively bankrupt and reinforces the notion that TTGL fans just love SCREAMING and BIG ATTACKS rather than a series that wraps a nice strong message in an enjoyable story.

gurrenlagann,39i3rj,Ambience7817,9,Thu Jun 11 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't see I typed this much. Wall of text time  Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is fantastic (ignore the name, i know its ridiculous, but don't let that distract you from this). Its shaped like a western cartoon like Johnny Bravo or Dexters Lab, 10 minutes per section, 2 sections per episode, except for a few. lots of sex and dick jokes. imagine a much more mature powerpuff girls. Here is a taste of what kind jokes to expect when you watch it. 13 episodes. I hope you love utter ridiculousness and sexy, i mean cool fight scenes. The 2 rival characters are also kind of inspired by Nia and Yoko, almost like it was directed by the same people as Gurren it was. Also, don't know if its your thing or not, but the English voices are actually better than the Japanese ones. Fuck what I said later on in the post, this is the one show to watch.   FLCL is trippy as fuck. 6 episodes and you wont understand what the hell is going on and you will love every second of it. Bass guitars, alien invasions, and erection metaphors. I know this is an awful way of describing something to watch, but I believe it isn't even possible to describe it any other way.  Dead Leaves is an OVA that lasts 50 minutes and is a mix of FLCL, Panty and Stocking and TTGL. its high action filled nonsense, also with sex jokes. The whole thing is also on youtube  Inferno Cop is 13 episodes, it started as a web show I think. 2 to 4 minute episodes, you can finish it in an hour, and its all on youtube. watch this if nothing else. like oh my god, this is amazing. dumb humor that will have you on the floor out of breath.  It is all in Japanese, so there are subtitles. but don't worry, you aren't missing any cool animation tricks by reading it, the animation budget was like 3 dollars and a camera. this isn't a bad thing, but when you see the first episode, you will understand.   Evangelion is a classic, Gurren Lagann is a parody of it actually. Eva is super serious, and slower paced, but when shit happens, SHIT HAPPENS. Ominous as fuck, with the feeling of god is watching you at all times. I love it, but its a way different show than Gurren. 26 episodes and an ending movie to replace/run alongside the last 2. It may not be your speed if you loved Gurren and want more of it, but it defined a genre 20 years ago and few shows are on its level. avoid the movies called the ""rebuild of Evangelion"". they aren't bad, but it isn't really evangelion. I cant think of anything else to compare this to, but the better series is the original.   Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is also fantastic. make sure its brotherhood, not the basic fullmetal alchemist. 2 brothers have the best bond in all of anime, more than Simon and Kamina to be honest, in a world where alchemy is real and its militarized to the extreme. Really good fight scenes and characters. If i were to post a picture of a dog looking thing from the show with the caption of it saying""big brother"" people would get highly upset with me and have the feels because of how well characterized everyone is. Highly Recommended, 52 episodes  Afro Samurai isn't a show, but rather an OVA with good fight scenes. think samurai champloo with Samuel Jackson as the main 2 characters. if that means nothing to you, feudal Japan with black people and hip hop with the main character being a badass voiced by Samuel L Jackson.  Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure is also up there as it is a ridiculous manly anime with fabulously manly men. really cool right scenes and great animation. almost all of the characters are based off of rock bands or musical people, and with you being 39, will get a whole lot of it. Kenny loggins and dire straits are 2 different sets of 2 people in there for example, and there is a character named Robert E. O. Speedwagon and a villian later on named Esidsi (pronounced AC/DC). really good balance of humor and action. its divided into parts, but all related. so part 1 is based on Johnathan Jostar, part 2 is Josheph Jostar, and 3 is Jotaro Kujo, all 3 are called JoJo. parts 1 and 2 are in the first 26 episodes, and part 3 is in 2 sets of 26 episodes. takes place in 1880's england, then pre WW2, then 1980. magic powers and totally necessary posing while fighting.  Cowboy Bebop is a space western with a really cool vibe to it. This was many peoples gateway anime. most of the 26 episodes are like a ""day in the life of"" style i guess you would call it. mini movies. they all aren't related to the overall story, but self contained. it works amazingly well. there is also a movie called knocking on heavens door that should be watched after the series is over.  Ghost in the Shell is a movie and 2 anime series. the original movie is an amazing cyber punk sci fi movie that directly inspired a little movie called The Matrix. Its about what makes us people and what makes machines machines. really cool action scenes, especially when you realize this was all done in 1995 and all hand drawn, no computers used. the 2 anime series (called Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig) are cop drama like in nature, think NICS or CSI, but animated and set in the future with cool sci fi shit. this is the least anime thing on this list really, no character has ""anime hair"" (except the main character in the 2 anime series who has purple hair, but that's it. all normal colors aside from that). its all based in a world that seems like it all really could happen and presents itself in that way. the movie is 2 hours and the anime series are both 26 episodes.   Rurouni Kenshin is my favorite manga of all time (you may know it as Samurai X). A Japanese swordsman who was the best assassin in the entire Meiji revolution (think civil war) has sworn off killing people after it ended, turning down a position in the government and he wanders the country with a 'reverse blade sword (so the dull part of a katana and the sharp parts are switched, so it cant even stab someone.) This series could be seen as a total opposite of gurren in a way. the main character is already as powerful as he will get, no real new techniques are learned except for one, cool level headed character who wants no attention, and is able to be political and not seem that way. if you do watch it, use this guide to skip the filler episodes, as they do nothing useful. if reading manga is your thing, i recommend that over the anime as it has both great art and another arc after the anime ends, but you can be perfectly fine with the anime. 52 canon episodes, 95 in total.  Gonna add in Avatar the Last Airbender and the The Legend Of Korra as well, even though they arent really anime, as they were made by Nickelodeon, but they have the same structure, themes and attention to action scenes. in this world, some people have control of 1 of the 4 elements, water, earth, fire, and air. the avatar (main character) can master all 4. he knows how to airbend, and needs to learn the other 3 to save the world. The legend of korra is a continuation of that with a new cast of characters, with some returning in older forms. about 62 episodes for last airbender and Korra has 52. it may technically be a cartoon, but this show is anime as fuck."

gurrenlagann,394xnu,beakrake,6,Tue Jun 9 07:52:42 2015 UTC,"While this is a sweet fucking hypothesis, I don't really think it was his intention. Once he learned about the Spiral Nemesis, I honestly think he was completely overcome with despair and legitimately did the things he did as a solution to the problem.  I mean he even alludes a couple of times to the fact that he was wrong about everything and that he was totally changed and stuff. It's definitely sort of a conundrum as to why he didn't completely DESTROY Lagann (and maybe there are others buried elsewhere still).   He certainly had humanity in his heart the entire time, because while kind of fucking cruel and insane, the methods he chose (or was given by Han-Rasen) DID allow humanity to stay alive. But just  judging by his attitude/the things he says in the show, I don't think he planned for another uprising."
gurrenlagann,394xnu,HalogenTD,3,Tue Jun 9 09:09:43 2015 UTC,Agreed. Lordgenome had pretty much given up all hope by the start of the series. His wording implies that he considers Simon finding Lagann a fortunate but entirely unexpected accident.
gurrenlagann,394xnu,tidier,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"I feel the only reason Lord Genome didn't destroy Lagann has to be that it was originally his friend's, the previous ""Simon"" figure in Lord Genome's first encounter with the Anti-Spirals, mecha and he couldn't bring himself to dispose of it in an unceremonious way, opting to bury it instead as a sign of respect and mourning."
gurrenlagann,394xnu,Xeo_Nespydonum,2,Tue Jun 9 10:11:18 2015 UTC,I dunno. There's no real way of knowing. Speculating is fun as shit though.

gurrenlagann,394xnu,tidier,-1,Tue Jun 9 16:38:14 2015 UTC,That other figure was very likely Kamina's father.
gurrenlagann,394xnu,vinnycthatwhoibe,3,Tue Jun 9 11:25:29 2015 UTC,N-no it wasn't?  They found his fucking body like 35 feet from Jiiha Village.
gurrenlagann,394xnu,HalogenTD,2,Tue Jun 9 12:08:51 2015 UTC,Isn't Genome like 800 years old though?  I thought he and Guam were both ancient.
gurrenlagann,394xnu,Xeo_Nespydonum,0,Tue Jun 9 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's an interesting thought as well. Lagann and his skeleton were in relatively close proximity. If that's the case as well, and knowing his son Kamina, might be safe to speculate that Genome was forced to kill his bestie when he wouldn't give up the fight...  Burying it near where he came from for sentiment, potentially letting fate decide if his descendant would take up the fight. (Swing and a miss though, unless Simon was Kamina's cousin or something.)  Wish there was an actual prequel OVA about this, sure would clear things up. Kickstarter anyone? lol"
gurrenlagann,394xnu,HalogenTD,2,Tue Jun 9 12:17:34 2015 UTC,what no  You do realize that Kamina's dad's skeleton was like two feet below ground right  You do understand that Lordgenome met Han-Rasen over a thousand years ago right

Just the few snippets we're given, and a bunch of assumptions...  It's fun to analyze thing's though, even if you're completely off base, since others will often spot the flaws in your argument more easily than you will. (Finding biased self supporting evidence and all that.)"
gurrenlagann,394xnu,Glengi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:42:50 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure what ""the other figure"" referred to in the comment is.  What we do know is that Lordgenome's battles were likely long before Simon/Kamina's time, and that there's basically no evidence connecting Kamina's dad to Lordgenome, other than that he was on the surface (which Kittan and gang, and Yoko's whole village were too, making that not really that special). Hence, it's a huge stretch to say that Kamina's dad was related to Lordgenome, other than the desire to link two prominent characters."

I watched them online a while back, they're not hard to find (called Gurren-hen and Lagann-hen respectively).

gurrenlagann,38uqxw,Captain-Turtle,14,Sun Jun 7 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"It's their memory of Kamina. His presence was so strong that it left a large imprint on their lives, and continues to ""live on as a part of [them]"". In turn, Simon goes on to inspire the rest of the gang to break out of their dreams.  As for no one getting their ""happy ending"" - that's part of the point of Episode 26. It was all their dreams and fantasies (Simon living with Kamina, Yoko being a universally acclaimed sniper/hero and marrying Kittan, Viral having kids and so on), but because they choose to reject the comfort of fantasies and instead return to the real world to fight that they are able to ""pierce the heavens"".  The message of TTGL isn't that If you want something badly enough, it will come true. It's that If you fight hard enough, even against all odds, amazing things will happen. It's not about going back and reclaiming what you lost (which were the points of Episode 11 and 26), but moving forward to build a new, brighter future.  So Yoko doesn't get to be with Kittan - but she lives a fulfilling life inspiring her students to become Spiral explorers like herself. Viral doesn't get to have kids, but he finds new meaning captaining the Chou-Ginga Dai-Gurren, leading the Earth's diplomatic mission to achieve peace in the galaxy. Simon gets the shortest end of the stick, of course, but Nia and Simon both made the difficult decision not to lay down a poor precedent for the rest of humanity, and choose against using Spiral power to save her life. Even so, he finds a little solace spending the rest of his life as a wanderer, helping people he meets along the way and continuing Nia's dream of covering the Earth with flowers.  Even in an imperfect world, each of them find new meaning to their lives and continue fighting for what they deem important. I think that's an important takeaway."

Everyone else is actually doing really great in the end."

gurrenlagann,38uqxw,limitbreaker77,2,Sun Jun 7 20:11:35 2015 UTC,"Be careful, the labyrinth placed them where they wanted to be most. Viral just had that ""fuck it"" personality that let him reject it so quickly."

I really don't think Simon would have wanted to remain in Jeeha village as some thief with a wuss version of Kamina, but in his ideal future he'd still be with his bro.  When the real Kamina appears he realizes the time he's experiencing isn't what he wants, and he instead chooses to save Nia / the universe. I'm sure he still wanted Kamina back, but not like that."
gurrenlagann,38uqxw,limitbreaker77,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose the idea of an ideal future clarifies things.

gurrenlagann,38qdgn,Gundilfteh,24,Fri Jun 5 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"No, but it's one of my favourites. It does a lot right. For one, I love the animation style and general art direction of the series. It's gone on to be the go to style for Trigger (Ex Gainax people who worked on Gurren Lagann)  and it's very recognizable and unique. It has a cast of plentiful and varied characters however, Simon, Viral and Rossiu are really the only real characters with development. This really stood out towards the end when they axed most of the supporting cast and I just didn't really feel anything because the characters weren't really fleshed out. The action is very frequent and often and is well animated. I also really liked how different the two different story arcs are. The show has decent pacing but I feel there is a part in the second arc near the start where the pacing becomes a little too slow. It's still a personal favourite and I rate it highly.  If you want to talk about what the greatest anime ever is, in my opinion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. That's just my opinion though. I'd definitely wouldn't argue if you picked Gurren Laggan as your favourite, it's a good choice."

gurrenlagann,38qdgn,cloudflow,3,Mon Jun 8 06:17:43 2015 UTC,Kittan became my second favorite character with his development/end. The others I just felt didn't have much behind them to feel as devastated

gurrenlagann,38qdgn,tidier,3,Sat Jun 6 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"This is always my answer. There are lots of ""better"" anime out there, but Gurren Lagann is definitely my personal favorite."

gurrenlagann,38qdgn,HalogenTD,7,Fri Jun 5 23:22:07 2015 UTC,Best anime ever? Maybe not. My number one favourite anime? Hell yeah.
gurrenlagann,38qdgn,captaintaco2345,8,Sat Jun 6 06:22:26 2015 UTC,"No. For all the cool stuff it does, it still follows a lot of obvious tropes and is under everything a generic shonen anime. It doesn't exactly do anything drastically different or dangerous. It's not exceptionally deep or well told. It's just balls to the wall crazy."
gurrenlagann,38qdgn,IrrelevantLeprechaun,11,Sat Jun 6 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"That's my favorite part, it takes all the tropes and cranks it to 11."
gurrenlagann,38qdgn,Zoso8,2,Sat Jun 6 07:39:05 2015 UTC,"I love that beyond the tropes, its still ridiculously well written with a lot of thematic material, motifs, and character development."

gurrenlagann,38qdgn,Zoso8,6,Mon Jun 8 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Nah. Personally, I think it's Bebop, though I always liked Outlaw Star more for that kind of snow (more similar to Star Wars). But the argument could be made, certainly. God knows it made me cry several times, and both Libera Me From Hell and Sorairo Days get me hype as fuck."
gurrenlagann,38qdgn,TimeShinigami,2,Sat Jun 6 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"Greatest is a hard word to qualify, partially because I doubt any of us have seen every anime ever, but also because there are still shows being made.  There may be a series that surpasses Gurren Lagann, and I know there are those who think such shows already exist.  For my sake, I don't think it's very likely, but I have to admit there was a time when I thought Gundam Wing was the greatest anime ever (basically the time before I saw Gurren Lagann).  In any case, it's certainly hard to argue that it is a shining beacon of what anime can be as a storytelling medium.  For me the biggest reason is because it maintains the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment is to entertain.  While I'm not against merchandise or having shows that are heavily merchandized (I'm sure Gurren Lagann had quite a bit in Japan when it came out), I feel like a lot of anime series from 2007 to today seem to be little more than going down the most marketable check lists and making their money back on predictable merch.  This even applies to adaptations, as quite often they are made to sell more manga, light novels, games, cards, etc.  Very rarely do we get a show that's simply trying to tell a good story or share a unique perspective.  (And to be honest, this isn't just a problem in anime.  I'm fairly positive that we can make the same criticisms about movies, western television, video games, and even music.)  As time passes, and trends come and go, I believe that the stories that will last are the ones told with passion and sincerity.  I mean, seriously, who wants to remember the Transformers movies now that we have Pacific Rim?  Gurren Lagann was a rare example of a show that put its story first and tried to make every episode feel amazing and epic (most of the time; I'm not that big of a fan of episode six, but that's a personal taste thing).  There was an obvious effort made into crafting each major moment by people who were passionate and dedicated about what they were making, and I think this is one of the major reasons the show resonates with us on such a deep level."

That's definitely the worst of it though, and the rest of the show is fairly mild. I especially thought the beach episode where they actually end up looking less revealing was a pretty funny reversal of expectations.  After the timeskip there is almost no fanservice until the last 5 episodes or so, where Yoko somehow manages to wear even less than the first half of the show. But they don't devote much screen-time to focusing on it, so it's not nearly as bad IMO."

gurrenlagann,383p5s,DatBrony,2,Tue Jun 2 00:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really the worst thing about a near-perfect series, all the really pointless male gaze-y stuff. The second half is overall much more tasteful and less goofy than the first, so if they were okay with the first half, they'll probably like the second more. Yoko does get a bizarrely revealing outfit later, but is popping out of it a lot less. Nia also gets an outfit that might be a little questionable. If you'd like to watch the movies (which I'd recommend!), around the finale, there are a few shots of bare breasts that fortunately feel less fanservicey and more like awesome nods to Gunbuster, and there is a shot of some really gross rape imagery for a couple seconds. It's not really overt, but it might bug some people. I hope you both enjoy the series!"

gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,1 point,Fri May 29 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's a massive mischaracterization. The chance that they might ""do something bad"" is actually extremely high (maybe even 100%) according to Lordgenome, and the consequences—as far as they could be sure—were no less serious than the destruction of the entire universe."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,beerybeardybear,2,Fri May 29 07:56:44 2015 UTC,"This is actually one of my favorite points of the whole story, cause I love this philosophical debate! In my interpretation, a lot of people take the Anti-Spiral's word at face value, when it might be more nuanced than that. And they might be right! But do they have proof? Have they ever ended the universe before? As far as seems to be the case, the Spiral Nemesis is a theory, not an assured outcome. Interestingly enough, it's a theory with a ton of overlap with libertarian economic theories regarding resource imbalance (ie ""infinite wants"" vs ""finite resources""). It assumes that all Spiral beings are too greedy and, left to their own devices, will want infinitely and create infinite matter. But Simon defies that! He shows a resolute stance of reservation and restraint. Because humans don't want infinitely! We are capable of accepting loss and letting go of regrets and moving forward and growing.  That went pretty tangent-y, hahaha! What I'm trying to get across is that the Spiral Nemesis is a fear that the Anti-Spirals built up within their own culture, and then instilled into all other cultures. There is no more reason to believe that it's a conclusion naturally understood by Spiral races, than that it's a fear instilled into them by their oppressor. Remember, everything we learn about the Spiral Nemesis is told from either the Anti-Spiral, or Lordgenome, the man who was beaten into submission by them. It's not an objective fact, just a subjective theory."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,1 point,Fri May 29 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that it's a theory, as much that it is just one possibility of many. Especially given that all the strongest Spiral beings (Lordgenome and Simon) also agree that it's a very real possibility, it is not that their fears are without any basis.  On that note, of all the changes between the show and the movie, the one I'm most ambivalent about is the change of Simon's last line to the AS: from ""Humanity isn't that stupid"" to ""Believe in us"". Unlike most of the changes where the movie rips itself off pointless, this change actually fits in well with the story. That said, both lines do still kind of work."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,tidier,0,Fri May 29 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Both lines are saying kinda the same thing, but I feel like ""Humanity's not that stupid"" is better. The thing is, I don't think Spiral Nemesis isn't a real threat. It's just that the Anti-Spiral insists that it's an inevitability unless they oppress the entire universe. It feels like the kind of way that real life imperialists control historical records and instill fears and supposed scientific truths into the cultures that they oppress. Not exactly what I'd call sympathetic villainy."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,1 point,Fri May 29 21:22:36 2015 UTC,"""Humanity's not that stupid"" is less self-plagiarizing, but in this case ""Believe   The main counter-point to your argument that it's a false fear is that Simon and Lordgenome both believed it. Even if you argue that Lordgenome has had his spirit beaten down by the AS, Simon, who has every reason to reject the idea of the Spiral Nemesis (which the rest of his crew does), comes to acknowledge that it is a real threat and possibility precisely because he understands Spiral power more than the rest of Team Dai-Gurren.  You could argue that Simon is somehow being tricked or lied into believing the Spiral Nemesis, but I think the story works just as well, if not better, if Simon recognizes it as a possibility, but refuses to give in anyway because it is only a possibility and the future is not written in stone.  The difference between the AS and Simon then is that whereas the AS believe that the Spiral species cannot resist its own power and this will lead inevitably to the Spiral Nemesis, Simon believes that humanity (and the rest of the spiral race) and create its own path and avoid the Spiral Nemesis."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,tidier,0,Fri May 29 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"I think your last paragraph is pretty much exactly what I mean, actually! I may not have gotten that across as well as I meant to, sorry. It's that Spiral races have the capacity for greed, just as we humans do, but the AS believes we are incapable of not indulging that greed."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,1 point,Fri May 29 21:43:57 2015 UTC,Ah okay. I see what you mean now. I think we're both agreeing that it's a possibility and not an inevitability then.
gurrenlagann,37nshd,tidier,1 point,Fri May 29 21:45:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Anti-Spirals insist that without them and their cruelty and oppression, it's an inevitability. Doing terrible things and insisting that things would be way worse otherwise is a classic abuse tactic, and often used in large scale systematic oppression."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,7,Fri May 29 22:13:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with Lord Genome and his redemption but the anti-spiral is the perfect example of an egotistically charged villain, and to be honest that's why the anti-spiral is a great bad guy. The best bad guys are the ones who are thoroughly convinced that they are the protagonist. The anti-villain may be a trope that is used a lot in shows nowadays (albeit not as well applied as others).   The Anti-Spiral does have good intentions, protecting the universe and everything, but they pay the ultimate price for showing so much hubris that they are the ones that can pass judgement on people they deem 'dangerous'. The same goes for Genome as he went about controlling/protecting humanity the wrong way and paid the ultimate price for it.  They are tragic characters but they have evil-type flaws that lead to their demise, although their reasoning is correctly charged, it doesn't make the way they went about what they wanted to do any less evil."

They weren't killing for the greater good. They still aren't proven wrong even. It is not fear of the unknown that they are fighting against.

gurrenlagann,37nshd,Kokoangyo,2,Sun May 31 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"I think I'm probably a little late, but I figure I'll throw in my two cents.   I don't think that the story's lack of black and white heroes and villians is what sets it apart. The show itself is brilliantly written, and 100% over the top, and the best part about the story is that it's the same situation and story over and over again, and it's a situation a lot of people can connect with. Basically Team Dai-Gurren is forced time and time again to select from the lesser of two evils and each time they make their own path and own deicisions.   Starting from episode one with Kamina and Simon stuck in their village, being told that they can either dig tunnels or the roof would fall on them. Kamina chooses to lead them to the surface instead and seek another way out. Then the Beastmen (basically) say they can stay underground or they can be killed. Kamina chooses to fight back. This theme is repeated again and again, and each time team Dai-Gurren chooses to make their own path and own decisions instead of what is forced on them. Rossiu as a character acts as a foil to Simon because he buys into the either or mentaillity in a way that Simon doesn't after Kamina's Death, and since he aknowledges the fact that you have to choose, he kind of epitomizes the ongoing theme.   This is just what I think, but it's honestly what I love most about the show. It makes me want the courage to not compromise in situations and always do what's right, even if it's hard."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,MagickSkoolieBus,2,Sun May 31 03:38:33 2015 UTC,"It's a story about people and their actions. Actions out of perceived neccessity, not action out of evil intent."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:06:30 2015 UTC,"""Perceived"" being a very key word there, haha. At the point where you're oppressing the entire universe through terror and despair, does the intent really matter anymore?"

gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,0,Thu Jun 4 22:58:44 2015 UTC,But why must it be done through terror? Why are you so willing to give a character that is literally the universe's biggest terrorist ever so much slack?
gurrenlagann,37nshd,MagickSkoolieBus,2,Fri Jun 5 02:39:13 2015 UTC,"Probably seemed like the easiest and most effective decision for both parties at the time.  Now that i think about it more though, i think there was a lot more to it, at least maybe for Lord Genome. Some might argue that Lord Genome wanted the human race to rise up again one day, but until then, it had to survive. Survive the desolate conditions, and constant onslaught until they could over come it.   Does that sound like a particular end show battle to you at all? If so, then Lord Genome prepared the human race well.  As for the Anti-Spiral. The end of the show pretty much answers that. They wanted, above all else, to preserve the universe in its entirety. Or at least as much as possible. To do that they had to quell the rise of spiral power in other races. For the humans, as that is what we know the most about; they had to take away their chances to rise in the first place. Take their legs out from underneath them so to speak.   At first it was just the annihilation of their civilization and strict regulations dictating that they should never reach over ""1 million (?) monkeys"" i think they put it.   Once the humans surpass that, they immediately looked for ways to cripple them while diminishing their number.   And so the constant onslaught continues, until finally Simon and Bunta proves to the Anti-Spiral that they can prove him wrong, due to constantly foiling his plans. Again and again, no matter how inventive he gets with his attacks. They constantly find a way.   I am going to say something, and only does it apply to this show, and not real life. Terror was the only tool capable of producing the results needed for both parties, but for Lord Genome, and in a weird twist of events, the Anti-Spiral as well; While Lord Genome wanted to overcome the Anti-Spiral some day, the Anti-Spiral never imagined that someone could prove them wrong, and as such, terror was inadvertantly the best choice for all parties.....  As odd as that is. But then, this is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Who the Hell do you think we are!"
gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"Now, I'm not gonna straight up say you're wrong about that. That is clearly how the events played out, for sure. And I agree, it was most likely that Lordgenome wanted the humans to rebel all along. But! I still feel like it is presumptuous to claim that these are the actions the AS ""had"" to do. It is in their view and their assumptions that Spiral races are greedy and unreasonable. What if the Anti-Spiral had thought to have faith in their Spiral siblings instead? What if things split differently from there, and they had tried to stop the Spiral Nemesis not through terror and oppression, but through education, communication, and trust? I don't believe the AS had no choice in the matter. I think they were self-entitled and cruel. And there is so much evidence that this is the case! The entire denoument (the 20 year timeskip at the end) is there to establish that a rule of equality, comradery, and good faith is what Simon and the Dai-Gurren created. It's sad that such a force of cruelty and terror existed that forced them to do it at all, when that same force could have made the right decision in the first place."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,MagickSkoolieBus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:05:29 2015 UTC,"Fair points.  If i may make one distinction however.  The AS didn't have to use terror.  The AS thought it was the best method for a means to an end. Or to put another way. They couldn't think of anything better to try, so they went with the best they could think of. For them, it was Terror.   Inadvertantly, using terror is what helped their ""sibling"" Spirals surpass them in ways that the AS were oblivious to, and without them meaning to in the first place.  Sure, they could have tried other methods to quell the possible destruction of the Universe via Spiral evolution. They could have, but they didn't. They went with what they felt was most effective at the time. It's a shame they couldn't use their superiority to find more humane methods instead, but can you say that when you feel your back is up against a wall, that you make the best decisions?  Remember, the AS's entire reason for fighting in the first place was to ensure their continued survival, (If i remember correctly), and Earth was threatening that with their continued evolution, up to points at which were deemed possibly catastrophic if left in the wrong hands.   As far as the AS were concerned, it was do or die. In their eyes, Humans are the real evil.   Just saying."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,Glengi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:49:37 2015 UTC,"Ohhhhh, these are such good points, I fucking love this thread, haha! Now, I feel like some of this depends on the timeline of events. I dunno, I got the impression that Earth wasn't nearly the first Spiral race the AS felt threatened by. In the spiral graveyard, there were all those Lagann-likes floating about, at least implying that each was the leader of their own revolutionary army. I assumed the AS had existed long before the 1000-or-so years ago that Lordgenome fought them."
gurrenlagann,37nshd,MagickSkoolieBus,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"I need to double check, but i think the Lagann-likes are both from previous attempts from humanity to beat the AS, but just not from only this universe. Remember, the AS can create micro-verses and etc. What's to say they haven't beaten humanity in Alternate universes instead and were just showing the current humans the carnage from it.?  Though, you could very well be right. In that case, i present this.  The AS have been using Terror for a long time, and so it seems like a good choice to them because it has been effective in the past. Hence the reason why they use it."

Simon and the Dai-Gurren Brigade arefighting to prevent the Spiral Nemesis as well at the end of the series, but they go at it in the 'Good Way'. Instead of having no faith in people and taking it solely upon themselves to save them, they are educating people and leading by example. They have faith in the spiral races, to put it simply."

gurrenlagann,36pefk,DefiantClone,6,Thu May 21 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"Give it some time before you re-watch them. Since a large chunk is recap, you'll want some cool down in between."

gurrenlagann,36pefk,Zashuiba,2,Thu May 21 15:32:40 2015 UTC,"The films have quite significant alterations near the ending parts of each major arc, especially the final one. It's got a different feel to it, so if you loved it as it was I'd definitely recommend it."
gurrenlagann,36pefk,lpchaim,4,Fri May 22 01:56:38 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it, welcome aboard! It's among my all-time favorites as well. The films are mostly recaps, but there are some extra or entirely altered fights and scenes nearing the season endings, especially for the finale. Definitely worth it, although maybe not immediately depending how you feel."

gurrenlagann,36pefk,GenesisHell,2,Fri May 22 22:33:05 2015 UTC,The movies are only re-tellings. The only really good new thing they offer is the extended final battle against Anti-Spiral. I HIGHLY recommend just watching that part at the end of the second movie. The extended battle has knew scenes and other stuff that makes it at least 100x more epic than the original battle.

It looked really  nice in the beginning but then started to wear off really fast (If you look at my other post you can see the tattoos once they start to wear off). I was disappointed because I got a fixer too that was suppose to keep it nice looking. I had a reference picture and had one of my friends paint me.

I of course realize that Yoko was characterized as that intentionally to make fun of that trope, but there's making fun of something by going over the top, like Kill la Kill, and then there's just doing the thing you're parodying.  Didn't really see her as much of a badass, since she hardly did anything. Up until the one episode where she saves Nia, her biggest contribution was inadevertly breaking Simon's heart, which basically lead to Kamina's demise."
gurrenlagann,36db2e,kunk180,1 point,Tue May 19 17:23:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, I felt she offered a lot as way of keeping Kamina grounded. As much as I love the punch through everything approach, she seemed to be the only person who could get him to admit that attacking head on wasn't always the brightest plan. She also helped save their lives in the first episode. Beyond that, evidently she already had experience with that gu of hers to take down a number of the beastmen, before the heroic pair ever stepped for into the light. I guess it is fair to say that most of her coolness comes from off-screen events and it really does suck that we don't get to see more of that on screen. A couple months ago, I dropped a rather substantial text dump about what I would've done for Yoko instead of the Teacher Episode that I think would've been cooler there, but also made her a better character in the Space Series.   What I'm trying to say is yeah, you're right, to a point. I'll coincede that she could have been a lot better, but she did serve her purpose and really did offer good things to the trio that would have lacked otherwise."

Just because he's the same age doesn't mean he's not the same emotionally as he was when he was a few years younger.  Shimon would still be reserved and have little faith in himself, and I still think Kamina would die in the same way. I don't think the dynamic would be as powerful without the age difference, though.   Kamina would still probably win in a fist fight.   Shimon would still probably not have a chance with Yoko. Yoko was attracted to Kamina primarily because of his spirit/who he was. I don't think just because Shimon got tall she would like him more."

They would write the equivalent of ""shimon"" that explains how it's pronounced, compared to the English ""Simon"" which would be (traditionally) pronounced in the exact same fashion (also sounding like ""Shimon"").  The way that most hear Simon pronounced is a by-product of the English spelling of the name, which is not an English name in origin.  So you're not wrong in the way it is pronounced, but it is correctly written as ""Simon"" in English, and not ""Shimon"". Japanese and English are very Very different languages and should be treated as such."

It is possible that this is the actual Cathedral Terra, as there is Gurren Laggan flag, and Kamina'sfamous phrase ""Just who the hell do you think I am?"" is shouted by the commander.

This is supported by the parallel of the opening/ending lines that ""All the lights in the skies are  [our enemies]/[stars]"", indicating that the Dai Gurren brigade/humanity chose to seek peace (and work to avoid the spiral nemesis) as opposed to war (and reckless abuse of spiral power)."
gurrenlagann,365d57,tidier,3,Sun May 17 00:21:32 2015 UTC,There's a whole theory with alot of evidence to support it that its kamina's father in the first episode. It was posted here on this subreddit quite some time ago. I'm on mobile otherwise I'd find it.

gurrenlagann,365d57,tidier,1 point,Wed May 20 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"Lordgenome's line was ""There was once a man who fought as you do, also unaware his actions would ensure humanities extinction."" So more than likely, he was referring to himself.   100%. Lordgenome was absolutely referring to himself. Cf.:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e2CiFbmQEg"

gurrenlagann,365d57,tidier,11,Sat May 16 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"Boota never turned into human form.  That was his space-time labyrinth fantasy. Like Viral having kids or Simon hanging out with Kamina again, Boota's fantasy was to gain the power to fight along-side the Dai Gurren brigade and play hero. Like everyone else, he gets rescued from his fantasy by Simon.  http://i.imgur.com/kFaNscG.jpg"
gurrenlagann,365d57,fokg29,12,Sat May 16 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"His space-time labyrinth fantasy did not come into existence until after Boota had a human form. Boota made the human form a reality in that dimension. Then he gets trap in the fantasy, then Simon saved him."
gurrenlagann,365d57,mike495,2,Sat May 16 19:44:29 2015 UTC,That's not true. We don't know exactly when the space-time labyrinth started.  As far as the scene in the show implies the moment turned into human form is the moment he entered the fantasy. His transformation into human form is the realization of his fantasy.
gurrenlagann,365d57,fokg29,4,Sat May 16 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"Possibly. When the anti-spiral was talking to lordgenome and saying he was being cautious because of an unaccounted spiral power, wasn't that in the ""real world/dimension""?"
gurrenlagann,365d57,mike495,2,Sun May 17 07:15:47 2015 UTC,THIS.
gurrenlagann,365d57,fokg29,0,Sat May 16 19:18:42 2015 UTC,they explicitly state that only sentient lifeforms can be trapped in the labyrinth.
gurrenlagann,365d57,Topher_Raym,2,Sun May 17 00:34:51 2015 UTC,Boota is sentient.  Sentient = Able to perceive or feel things.
gurrenlagann,365d57,tidier,-3,Sun May 17 00:41:59 2015 UTC,Thats not what that means.
gurrenlagann,365d57,tidier,0,Sun May 17 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, Troll."
gurrenlagann,365d57,supernaga,3,Sun May 17 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"/u/mike495 is right. Thanks to Lordgenome he is able to take a humanoid form, THEN he gets trapped. heres proof!  lol at the video being a sped up version."
gurrenlagann,365d57,AlphaBenson,2,Sun May 17 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"Or did the fantasy begin the moment he transformed? In other words, was his transformation already part of the fantasy? (Yes, we visually see that he gets ""trapped"" a little later in the conversation - but that may not be where the fantasy begins.)  Consider that the Anti-Spiral says that ""The instant multi-dimensional space is perceived it is made real. Taking human form means that you have forever trapped yourself in the labyrinth of multi-dimensional space.""  I don't think there is an open-and-shut interpretation on this one. You can either believe that his transformation is part of the fantasy, or that he is only susceptible to the trap after he takes human form - there isn't quite sufficient solid evidence in either case, and the wording is ambiguous enough to support both interpretations.  That said, I stand by my interpretation that the fantasy begins the moment he ""transforms"". This is supported by:   It fits in nicely with what Boota's fantasy would be - to transform into human form and fight save the other spiral warriors It addresses the OP's question as to why it never gets brought up again - because it was just his fantasy. (Especially given that Lordgenome re-obtains his body in super-spiral space, one would assume that Boota should get back his human body too. Considering that it never happens, this supports the argument that it was just his fantasy, and Boota never acquired that power in the first place.) Boota says ""We're in-"". Presumably meaning that he knows that he's been trapped. This is before he gets frozen, so that's not when the trap begins.   None of this is solid proof, but that's where I'm coming from."
gurrenlagann,365d57,fokg29,1 point,Sun May 17 07:11:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting. As you stated there is two possibilities. 1. Boota was already in the fantasy 2. Boota entered the fantasy when he evolved into human form  I think it is very unlikely to be 1. Everyone's fantasy was in a different location. Boota probably would fantasize about being human, but back on the planet."
gurrenlagann,365d57,Loli4life,2,Sun May 17 07:20:34 2015 UTC,"I think we can agree to disagree on this.  I don't think the location matters all that much in the fantasy (and we do see Boota escape from the fantasy from aboard the Chou Ginga Gurren Lagann anyway, so we know his fantasy takes place there. We're just not sure when it starts).   Also note that Yoko's and Simon's fantasies are mind-bendy too (Simon changing from young to old Simon, Yoko changing costumes and ""teleporting"" to the site of Episode 8 after Kamina shows up), so it's not too much of a stretch for Boota's to also involve himself changing.  Lastly, I think it is poetic that Boota's fantasy is to transform into human form. Like Viral (and really, the rest of the Dai-Gurren Brigade), his fantasy remains a fantasy, but he fights on nonetheless with the cards life deals him."

He had the swag. He had that fire attitude. He inspired everyone to push through and give it their all. And then there's Kittan. He was a straight team player. This guy, in my eyes, acted like Kamina in some moments. When he took up the leader role was able to rally the troops efficiently to get the job done. And then there's Simon. Once a boy, now a man, some people could consider him as Kamina 2.0. Though he hadn't had Kamina's fire attitude, but he had truly displayed his will power. Haha during the last few episodes I'd be like, ""Holy sh**! Simon has reached Kamina mode!"" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . LOW KEY Yoko was my fav cause... <3"

gurrenlagann,359q7t,Kamuisynchronize,6,Fri May 8 07:53:33 2015 UTC,"Might be an unpopular opinion, but I say if you want something as over the top, great story, and gurren lagann levels of hype, try the wonderful 101 on the wii U, or look up the story. It's pretty great!"
gurrenlagann,359q7t,Doctorhype,3,Fri May 8 12:56:30 2015 UTC,"I have seen a lot about wonderful 101, but sadly I don't have a Wii U.  It reminds me a lot of Viewtiful Joe from what I've seen. I also know that it's made by Platinum, so it's no surprise that it's super over the top."
gurrenlagann,359q7t,metroids224,4,Fri May 8 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"Is there a specific reason people like Kill la Kill more? I don't see the appeal, I've watched it twice now."
gurrenlagann,359q7t,uberneuntausend,4,Fri May 8 17:52:16 2015 UTC,IMO part of it is the characters are a lot more likable and recognisable in Kill La Kill.
gurrenlagann,359q7t,metroids224,3,Fri May 8 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. It's the characters. While I love the Gurren Lagann characters, KLK's cast is better IMO."
gurrenlagann,359q7t,uberneuntausend,2,Fri May 8 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"I just can't get into it. The whole ""My clothes speak to me and tell me I'm overweight"" and ""I need to feel comfortable in my own skin"" don't appeal to me personally."
gurrenlagann,359q7t,uberneuntausend,2,Fri May 8 18:20:19 2015 UTC,Yeah it's an odd show. I'm pretty sure a lot of it is satire though.
gurrenlagann,359q7t,feloniousthroaway,3,Fri May 8 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"It certainly is a very strange show. Your enjoyment of it really depends on your attachment to the characters. It's a lot like Gurren Lagann in that sense. My brother doesn't like GL because he finds Simon's character arc doesn't appeal to him, so I can totally see why a few people don't enjoy Ryuko's character arc."
gurrenlagann,359q7t,nick021234,2,Fri May 8 18:51:43 2015 UTC,Ryuko was my least favorite character. I loved pretty much everyone else though.

gurrenlagann,352dsp,Gurr3nX,3,Wed May 6 15:51:43 2015 UTC,I'm a designer in the field (actually have two dvd cover jobs coming up here in a week or so). Aside form spelling errors my biggest qualms are the type is a bit hard to read on the back due to the image. And It would've been cool to see a image for the cover you designed yourself and not just artwork form the show. But Being a designer I also know there often not the amount of time needed to create stuff from scratch and make deadlines on time.     All in all for student work it's pretty good!

gurrenlagann,354wl1,xeqtioner0,1 point,Fri May 8 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"Actually yes haha the episodes are the exact same, however with the $700 one the only thing you're getting besides the volumes are collectibles, the soundtrack, and a few other things. Imo it's both cheaper and more worth it to just get the volumes individually because the volumes themselves come out to $250 ($50 a piece) which is already way more cost effective than buying the huge $700 collection pack thing. If you still wanted all the extras the DVD collection set is only $150 I think so it's totally your call but as far as the volumes and the huge collection go the episodes are the exact same"

TTGL is stated to be 10 million light years tall in the official Gainax handbook. TTGL actually appears smaller because the battle took place in not our universe but in a super spiral universe where galaxies are much larger.   Our Milky Way Galaxy for example would only be about the size of a quarter laid at the bottom of TTGL's foot because it is only 100,000 light years across."

I feel the movie takes out some of the filler episodes and it changes slightly because of that. Example:Kitan  (if I spelled his name right) is introduced later instead of the episode that was made for him and his sisters.  watch both movies, Gurren-hen  and Lagann-hen and I'm sure you will see all the important things along with some nice changes that I feel improve it.

There's no way it'd get more than a limited release; there's just no way it'd make money outside of those are already into anime.  It'd probably just get a dvd release, though I hope that it's better than what is currently offered with the subs.  Aniplex: ""Oh, you just want a barebones edition? That'll be 30 bucks, fucker."""

gurrenlagann,32brby,tidier,7,Sun Apr 12 12:46:26 2015 UTC,I always felt it was Kaminas ego made physical.... god he was awesome
gurrenlagann,32brby,cjjb95,9,Sun Apr 12 14:10:08 2015 UTC,Simon has surpassed Kamina by that point though. Also the face/hair looks more similar to Simon's.
gurrenlagann,32brby,tidier,5,Sun Apr 12 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, the face/hair doesn't look similar, it IS Simon's."
gurrenlagann,32brby,metroids224,3,Sun Apr 12 17:10:11 2015 UTC,Why not both?  Could be a combination of Simon and Kamina.

gurrenlagann,32brby,Goose_Is_Awesome,5,Sun Apr 12 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"Word of God also said that in episode 8, Kamina died in the initial attack, but forced himself back to life so he could finish the fight.  Let me re-iterate, he had half his body ripped away,  killing him, but he decided to COME BACK TO LIFE to help his friends.....what a fucking badass"
gurrenlagann,32brby,TheTurretCube,9,Sun Apr 12 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"""A true man never dies, even when he's killed""  Also, it would only be fitting that Kamina avenged his own death."

gurrenlagann,328rip,AFGiant,5,Sun Apr 12 03:54:00 2015 UTC,Thanks!
gurrenlagann,328rip,wickedfarts,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:57:49 2015 UTC,"sure thing. nothing against the dub. i loved it, but in the final scenes i feel the dub is underwhelming compared to the sub. but there are other times where the dub outdoes itself, like king kittan's giga drill break."
gurrenlagann,328rip,wickedfarts,4,Sun Apr 12 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"Can you explain why most people like watching with subs? I've never really understood why.   I get that in some cases the voice acting is better, but I feel like it's hard to fully appreciate good voice acting when you can't understand the language, or have to look at subtitles.  I'm guessing it's just more of a preference thing for me but I don't understand why a majority of people prefer subs."
gurrenlagann,328rip,AFGiant,3,Sun Apr 12 07:06:03 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for everyone of course. But to me, there's GENERALLY something more authentic about the sub. There are exceptions of course, but in general, I feel like the original voice acting, directed by the show's original director, and acted in the original language, feels more natural. Good voice acting is not just about the words spoken. It's about the emotion they're spoken with, and that's something that transcends language.  For Gurren Lagann, I think that the Japanese cast delivered their lines with raw intensity, with a borderline-insanity that the English cast never hit. It was probably a combination of different casting and different direction, but in that case I think it matters so much that it makes or breaks the show. The original language acting in TTGL fills me with fighting spirit that the show was selling us. The English acting leaves me feeling like the show is cheesy and not worth watching, at all."
gurrenlagann,328rip,wickedfarts,2,Sun Apr 12 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for the reply. Personally I still prefer dubs but I definitely see the other side now. Thanks"
gurrenlagann,328rip,hawxx_,2,Sun Apr 12 15:30:06 2015 UTC,How do you feel about Bebop? I've watched both and in Bebop's case I actually think the dub is better
gurrenlagann,328rip,hawxx_,2,Sun Apr 12 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"I watched Bebop for the first time when it was airing on Adult Swim in the early 2000s, back when AS was one night per week. I watched it over the course of many weeks and was enthralled. I love Blum's performance as Spike, and the rest of the cast definitely lent some serious personality to the characters. As such, having fallen in love with the English cast, I never went and checked out the sub. I wouldn't be opposed to rewatching it to try it out! There are definitely some cases where I like the English dub better, and other cases where I like the dub and the sub equally."
gurrenlagann,328rip,KingoftheFools,3,Sun Apr 12 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"Well I can't speak for anyone else but myself, but here goes. I'm not one to pick a side on the sub vs. dub argument. For me, its more circumstantial. Sometimes the dub is better and sometimes I prefer the sub. Gurren Lagann was pretty unique to me in that I watched it in both dub and sub. Each had its own merits, the dubbed voices made the comical parts that much more funny to me, and the subbed voices made some of the raw, emotional moments even more epic. So for me, I appreciate both the dub and the sub versions, but that's just me. And to answer your other question, I liked the dubbed version of Bebop way better!"

gurrenlagann,313anr,KaizerFuckingGibby,5,Wed Apr 1 18:34:53 2015 UTC,I had a theory that Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are two sides of the same story. I posted it here a while back.
gurrenlagann,313anr,Chaos20X6,3,Wed Apr 1 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory, but that would give anti-sprials and humanity the same home world wouldn't it?  There wasn't any explicit space colonization by the end of Eva, and anyways we see the dormant anti-spiral bodies when we zoom in on their homeworld, in Eva after an impact people just turn into LCL.  My hypothesis is that the Antispiral just controlled SEELE, originally seeking out ways to convert spiral threats to their cause peacefully, humanity refused, Shinji is Lordgenome (compare Eva 01 and Lazengan), and intergalactic war were declared paving the way for TTGL way down the line."

While KLK doesn't reach the same scale at the end, it definitely stays pretty consistent with the over-the-top action sequences, and there's even a couple of GL references sprinkled here and there.  So yeah, if you like Gurren Lagann, you'll probably get a kick out of KLK."

TTGL was, thematically, an allegory for a boy growing into being a man, while KLK is an allegory for a girl growing into being a woman.

A lot of these are Gurren Lagann or it's variants like the Super Galaxy one but none would be possible without Lagann.

gurrenlagann,30dud6,T3hmonster,6,Thu Mar 26 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"Regarding Lagann:   Lordgenome: Lazengann, the Teppelin, even the Gunmen - they were originally weapons used to fight the Anti-spirals  Rossiu: Wait, are you telling me that Lagann was also a-  Lordgenime: Exactly. It was one of our most powerful weapons. It's a Core machine which can control any mecha with which it combines. Though I sealed it underground, it was found by humans. Fate's hand at work again.  [Episode 18]   Regarding Nia's Ring:  ""The Spiral Perceptual Teleportation System"" (Episode 23), first used when Simon and Kinon teleport to punch Rossiu. Powered by the Chou-Ginga Dai Gurren, it allows the Spiral mecha to teleport to a location of a person/object that they fixate their minds on. The Dai Gurren-Brigade's plan, starting from Episode 24, was to teleport to wherever Nia's ring is, because Simon knows that Nia (even in her Anti-Spiral form) is still wearing it. The Anti-Spiral keeps interfering with their teleportation though, until they finally succeed at the end of Episode 26, presumably because the Anti-Spiral lets their guard down after he traps them in the ""inescapable"" Multi-Dimensional Labyrinth (the fantasy alternate universes).  Compare:   First Teleportation: http://i.imgur.com/8Ewf16P.jpg  Teleportation to Nia's Ring: http://i.imgur.com/THu5kSk.jpg"
gurrenlagann,30dud6,tidier,3,Thu Mar 26 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"This is a ridiculously old post, but Simon invented teleportation for the sole purpose of punching Rossiu square in the face.  And that is beautiful."
gurrenlagann,30dud6,kayneargand,4,Wed Jul 1 06:02:06 2015 UTC,"It's said that the Gunmen and laganns were built to fight the anti spirals, since every race that has fought the anti spirals is a spiral race it can be implied that they all built similar mechs to combat it  As far as the ring goes my explanation for everything is pocket universe, different physics"
gurrenlagann,30dud6,AirNova,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"I assume they had multiple ""Gurren Laganns"", and the Gunmen they fight are the ""Gurrens"" that are left, since you need a Lagann to unlock a Gunmens full power, the Anti Spiral took them all/Lordgenome hid them so the destruction of earth would be hindered."
gurrenlagann,30dud6,Mil0_The_Brave,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"People have answered the ring one well enough. Lagann was made by the Spiral Warriors of old. In all likelihood by the end of the show Leeron and crew could probably build more, but there's no reason to especially considering Lagann style Mecha are only as strong as their pilot's spiral power so without Simon they don't have anyone with the spiral power to make it worth the effort. The only real advantage to Lagann style mecha is there ability to turn pilot's spiral energy into physical form (drills, repairing damage, etc) so without Simon around the weapons humanity can make will work better on average"
gurrenlagann,30dud6,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Thu Mar 26 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"I'm don't think that they believe no one will surpass Simon - that would go against the spirit of the series. There's also a really plastic and fake feeling about the Grapearls, in my opinion. Also there's a Lazengann, which has Lagann-style capabilities while also being battle capable. Though I suspect that that's purely a Lordgenome custom version.  It's also interesting that the final battle ends with many of the pilots being in a Lagann - to me, that indicates that humanity's future will involve many more people awakening their spiral power.  But it is true that if the universe is at peace, there's less of a need for battle-capable mecha. Drills aren't meant to be weapons though - they're meant for digging and exploration!"
gurrenlagann,30dud6,tidier,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone stronger than Simon (or even on par) is gonna be coming around. One: before Simon Lordgenome was the most powerful human spiral power wise. Lordgenome was around for a very long time before that so it would be a good long while before someone as strong as them would show up (and even then it took Simon combining his own personality with Kamina's to reach the level he does). Two: Simon by the end of the series is likely strong enough that if not careful he'd cause the Spiral Nemesis to occur so humanity won't be pushing to that level. Three: people who have seen first hand what Spiral Power can do (specifically seen what Simon can do) still aren't as strong in the spiral power (looking at you Rossiu), including the person Simon picks as his successor to the Core Drill who continually doubted the power of Gurren Lagann compared to the obviously inferior Grapearls. They throw in a bit towards the end to try and compare Gimmy to Simon with him over coming his fear, but it doesn't work because even at his most fearful and weak Simon never went against Kamina (which Gimmy does to Simon). Spiral Power relies on your willpower and most our strongest willed characters sacrificed themselves to create a tomorrow for the rest (Kamina, Kittan, even Nia)"
gurrenlagann,30dud6,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Thu Mar 26 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that none of the other characters at the end of the series are anywhere near as strong as Simon. That's a different statement from Simon being the strongest the spiral race is going to get.  But what is true is that there appears to be no pressing need for anyone to be as strong as Simon, so we shouldn't expect anyone to rise up to that challenge either. On the other hand, remember that Spiral power is not just about fighting, but also about growth and exploration.  As for your comment on the Lazengan, you're absolutely right that a pilot with less spiral power would be nowhere near as effective (although this is also true of regular Gunmen, albeit to a lesser extent than the Lagann-type mecha).   Another thought that comes to mind is that the Lagann (and Lazengan) is unique among the units shown in the series for being built for Spiral warriors. All of the other Gunmen we see (up until the Space Gunmen) were built for Beastmen, who couldn't use Spiral power (until Viral, much later on). On the other hand, we have that scene in Episode 2 where Kamina is initially unable to operate the Gunzar until he recomposes his fighting spirit.  This, combined with Lordgenome's comments about the Gunmen being previously used by the Spiral race for war, should imply that the Gunmen were spiral mecha readapted for use by non-spiral beings (and therefore run without spiral power). Another thing to note is that the Grapearls were created before Rossiu and Leeron knew about the history of the spiral race, or the true nature of spiral power. Hence my speculation: I wouldn't be surprised if humanity would more willing to incorporate Lagann-style capabilies given that 1) they now understand it, 2) they've seen how powerful and adaptable it is, compared to regular Gunmen and 3) many people have awoken spiral power, even if nowhere near the extent of Simon.  (Enough rambling for now)"
gurrenlagann,30dud6,tidier,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"Also yes Lazengann is battle capable, because it's being piloted by Lordgenome. It wouldn't be nearly as strong if piloted by say, Rossiu because Lordgenome is way stronger in the power of the spiral"

The fact that you seriously think that you need to have verbal consent in order to kiss someone, and kissing someone without doing so is RAPE, it screams to me that you've never been in a real relationship with anyone before. Body language, conversational tone, context, all this is far more important. Human relations aren't as robotic as you think they are.  Do yourself a favour and stay away from all that Tumblr 'SJW' nonsense. It's not good for your head."
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,-2,Wed Mar 25 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"Did you not listen to my responses? I just said that context and body language were valid elements of consent. I don't seriously think everyone needs to go up to their spouse like ""I WOULD LIKE TO KISS YOU NOW. DO YOU CONSENT Y/N? BEEP BOOP."" And I never said it was rape, simply that it's the same attitude, different severity. Doing things to someone else's body without permission is a violation of their autonomy, even if it's technically harmless."
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,4,Wed Mar 25 19:36:47 2015 UTC,Gross creep?  Did I spoiler tag right?
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,3,Wed Mar 25 19:41:12 2015 UTC,"No, more like this.  Dude literally goes to his death RIGHT after the kiss to save all his friends. I think we can forgive him kissing someone."
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,-3,Wed Mar 25 12:52:01 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a particularly controversial idea to think that kissing someone without their permission is a gross and shitty thing to do.

gurrenlagann,308qu1,sinapzwork,2,Thu Mar 26 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"lmao a kiss is just a kiss. Albeit it was a very passionate kiss, but that's just how Kittan felt at the time. I really see nothing wrong with expressing how you feel through a kiss. It's quite tame compared to ""rape."""
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,0,Thu Mar 26 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"Of course it's tame. It's practically harmless. The severity of it isn't my point. My point is that it's the same attitude. Have you ever been touched, grabbed, or kissed when you didn't want them to, even if they didn't technically ""hurt"" you? That's a violation of your bodily autonomy."

But, if you ask me, I didn't interpret her reaction as positive, and her dream sequence implied that at the most she only ever considered Kittan as a distraction from the pain of losing Kamina. More importantly, I love Kittan and I don't want his dumb actions encouraging people to think doing that is okay in real life."
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,7,Fri Mar 27 00:28:09 2015 UTC,Are you saying that age gap between them makes it gross? Because I'm certain that Kamina and Kittan are the same age.
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,5,Fri Mar 27 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"Well even if they weren't, by the time that kiss happens Yoko must be at least 21-22. At a stretch, Kittan would be no older than 30. And if you ask me, that's not creepy at all."
gurrenlagann,308qu1,iiRockpuppy,3,Wed Mar 25 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 30 tops. Why does OP find this creepy?"

gurrenlagann,2zxxp8,bukkfizzman,3,Sun Mar 22 21:21:08 2015 UTC,"That is the ""Tengen Toppa"" version of the song.  Here is a link"
gurrenlagann,2zxxp8,ThatGuyfromNI,2,Sun Mar 22 22:09:09 2015 UTC,"This is actually a common misconception.  That version of the song is the ""Sorairo Days - Tengen Toppa Edition Lagann Hen. See: http://www.play-asia.com/namida-no-tane-egao-no-hana-gurren-lagann-version-limited-pressi-paOS-13-49-en-70-3ath.html  Sorairo Days - Tengen Toppa Edition (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPUPrXgD7-U) was released before the second movie. See: http://www.play-asia.com/magic-time-cddvd-paOS-13-49-en-70-34n6.html (Arguably, it should be called ""Sorairo Days - Tengen Toppa Edition -Bonus Track"")  I personally prefer the latter. There's a much nicer build-up, with what I presume is Kamina swinging sword and his cape blowing in the wind, and influence from Tsuzuku Sekai, the theme song for the first movie, which escalates into a more intense version of Sorairo Days. On the other hand, the Lagann-Hen edition has a really jarring transition into what is basically the original Sorairo days.  Basically, compare    Tengen Toppa Edition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPUPrXgD7-U&t=22 Tengen Toppa Edition Lagann hen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQvLECht08&t=2 Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKRUKalbx3s"
gurrenlagann,2zxxp8,tidier,2,Mon Mar 23 07:25:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Easy to see why so many people, including myself got it wrong.  When I was getting the link for my earlier post I stumbled upon the ""original"" Tengen Toppa Edition, but I moved on assuming someone mislabeled the video or something, as I skipped to the middle part which could have easily been a remix.   Well, the more you know. Thanks for posting, I've got a new version of the song to love now."
gurrenlagann,2zxxp8,ThatGuyfromNI,2,Mon Mar 23 08:19:03 2015 UTC,"It's not surprising that people get it wrong - not many people know about the Tengen Toppa Edition (which was a bonus track for one of Shoko Nakagawa's albums), whereas the Lagann-Hen version appeared in the movie, so it's better known.  The former is my favorite by far though.  Side note: There's a Masaki Endoh cover (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dWZcF58EgA), although I'm not a great fan of it. There's also mandarin version by Shoko herself. No good links for this though: you're either stuck with a pitch-modified(?) youtube version (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29--y4PU5Os), or a slower-loading tudou version (http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/aBZF6ypluzA/)"

Later on, his adult form was nicknamed ""Starlock"". ""Gar"" refers to a character being ""extremely manly"". Starlock refers to Simon's goggles transforming into sunglasses. The suffix -lock comes from a character called Captain Harlock who is a space pirate and the main character from the anime of the same name. It is possible that Simon's outfit is a nod to this series.   http://gurrenlagann.wikia.com/wiki/Simon  What the hell am I reading?"

There has been no North American exclusive bluray set released yet.  Japanese media prices have always been ridiculously expensive as well.  A DVD is normally 6,000 to 9,000 yen, usually consisting of four anime episodes.   The reason Aniplex has released the Japanese region BluRays in the US is because, contrary to the DVD format, the Japanese and North American BluRay region is the same.  You can play BluRays from either country on either country's BluRay players.  This presents a problem.  Reverse Importing.   If they were to release a North American exclusive BluRay at a lower price point, the Japanese would just buy that North American version for a cheaper price.   You may have theories on how you could improve prices or practices but that's irrelevant.  This is the Aniplex way."

All of those were impossible dreams at that point: Kamina is dead, Kittan is dead, and Viral can't have children (he could still have a wife, I guess).  The point of the memory of Kamina breaking Simon and Yoko out (and then Simon proceeding to inspire everyone else, in turn) is to reject the fantasies and to fight for their own futures."

The other, and much pricier option, is the Kanzen Henkei version of Gurren Lagann (http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/detail?gcode=FIGURE-001882). This series, in general, is unique for allowing complete transformation of their figures. In this case, it means that you can combine Gurren & Lagann into a full Gurren Lagann figure. But it's also really expensive and out of production right now, so you'll have to pick it up second hand/resold.  Personally, I would just recommend buying full Gurren Lagann figures instead!"

gurrenlagann,2yyrlj,Monosentence,2,Sat Mar 14 05:53:03 2015 UTC,"It's probably because she pitch-shifted the instrumental down to match her voice, rather than strain to meet Shoko Nakagawa"

gurrenlagann,2yio5f,tidier,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:11:56 2015 UTC,"He won't get the epic feels and the motif and theme work if he just watches the first film.  And the first 11 episodes aren't deep, but they're hilarious and so well done that even if he can't see the framework that they lay (he will later), he should be entertained by them.  Why does he refuse?"
gurrenlagann,2yio5f,Glengi,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:37:21 2015 UTC,"The main difference between the movies and the series, aside from cutting out some of the less central (but still important) scenes from early on in the series, is that it basically combines episodes 11-14 into a giant episode 11-style ending. Instead of fighting Guame, Simon and the Dai Gurren Brigade end up fighting all four Supreme Generals (with Viral replacing Thymilph). And importantly, while the second movie starts from post-time skip, neither movie actually covers episode 15 (although there is a short recap of the battle at the start of the second movie.) This will then pose a problem if you want him to jump from the first movie to the TV series.  In my opinion, Episode 15 is one of the best episodes in the series that people forget about, so it'd be a pity to miss that.  Given your situation, I would recommend   Watching the 1st movie Watching episode 14-15, explaining that Guame/Cytomander are still alive at this point in the TV series Watch the TV series from episode 17 onwards.   Also, I will repeat my personal opinion that while the 1st movie is rushed compared to the TV series, the 2nd movie is much worse than the TV version."
gurrenlagann,2yio5f,tidier,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:38:31 2015 UTC,"Worse how? As far as I've seen, they recreated the sound and animation for the entire second movie. What would you say makes it worse? The rushed pacing?"
gurrenlagann,2yio5f,Glengi,1 point,Tue Mar 10 09:18:03 2015 UTC,"The rushed pacing I forgive, because it's a constraint of the medium. I mostly have issues with the the things they added/changed.  Without getting into too much detail here, a lot of the changes undermined some of the original themes and motifs of the series, and many decisions were made purely based on the ""rule of cool"".   I'll give a good example: movie's choice to change the first appearance of the Cathedral Terra from a ship form to robot form. Why? So they could have a scene of a robot trying to punch the earth (SO EPIC!!!!). As a result, they had it first appear in a robot form, just so it could be turned back into the ship form, just so the robot form (SGGL) could be ""revealed"" later on, even though we saw it in robot form earlier in the movie. In the TV series, the audience sees Kittan's sacrifice lead to Simon unlocking the power for the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren, and it's amazing when its robot form is revealed. The movie takes away the force of one of the best scenes on the series just so they could have a scene of a robot trying to punch the earth (and give the Arc Gurren Lagann a Giga Drill Break).  I have more complaints than this. Individually, they are minor issues, but as a whole it shows that the most of the changes were decided based on a reductive view of the series (best exemplified by how they needed to introduce two whole new Giga Drill Breaks in the movies, and the only thing the STTGL does is a Giga Drill break).  There were some nice new elements, such as the Tengen Toppa versions of each mech and an improved epilogue, but overall the changes did more harm than good. And I haven't even gotten into the thematic damage that the movie did. I could write a whole post about that.  Again, these are my own personal views. If others enjoy the movie, then good for them."

Find a cape that looks similar to the TTGL one with no logo. The logo is what makes it expensive as they are usally made in Japan, so buy a nice looking cape then maybe cut and flair the bottom of it and take it to a custom t-shirt shop and have them print the logo on it, I have a jacket decently close to Simons that on the internet was going to be around 100$ and got it at my local custom print shop for 15$"

IMO the pacing is really bad because it doesn't give enough time to introduce the characters. Also, the ending is kind of odd, but good. It never gets to the Lordgenome fight; it ends with a revamped battle against the four generals, which is pretty awesome.  The second movie is great. It starts with the fight against Lordgenome, then covers the second arc. IMO the pacing in this movie is an improvement from the show. Again, it revamped the ending, somehow making it BIGGER than before. That in itself is worth a watch.  TL;DR if you don't want to go through the story all over again then at least watch the endings to each movie."

Worst case scenario, the pacing of the first one isn't great and you won't enjoy that as much. The second movie actually redoes all the animation and audio, and they go really nuts with it, so look forward to that!"

I'm a much bigger fan of the TV series. You're not losing out too much by not watching them, though if you're a fan of the series you should watch them at some point.  Yes, the movies do add stuff, particularly the second one; but nothing I think that really contributes to the series other than a very mildly improved ending."

Just take the events of the films (at least the second) as additions to the canon, not replacements. Appreciate what they add, and combine them into the story of the main series. Yeah, the second movie is ludicrously flashy, but I don't think that flash necessarily detracts from the theming of the series, if anything it adds to it."

There's also Berserk and Fist of the North Star, which feature a similar style of action, but are very different in tone. And while the story is nothing like Gurren Laggan, GTO features a main character that is incredibly similar to Kamina."
gurrenlagann,2xiykv,Caleb_Aurion,2,Sun Mar 1 04:11:19 2015 UTC,"Well, it doesn't have to be anything that's Mecha. TTGL wasn't great because it was mecha (although the mecha/super robot appeal was definitely a big part of it), what made it great were its themes of brotherhood, overcoming the impossible, and its addicting over the top action and story. I've read OPM and i love it, but I can't really seem to get myself into JoJo, I don't really know why. I can tell Berserk is a great read (I've read a few chapters), but it doesn't make me want to read it back to back (not really sure why). I'll try FotNS, but if you do know something that shares the ideals of TTGL I'd really appreciate it. Thanks a lot for your reply."
gurrenlagann,2xiykv,Zireck,1 point,Sun Mar 1 04:42:05 2015 UTC,Well for the concepts of brotherhood and strong ideals I'd suggest Full Metal Alchemist. The original anime was quite good but the manga is leaps and bounds better.

The star is a tribute to Kittan, who sacrificed himself so that Simon and humanity could succeed. You might have noticed that Kittan's whole thing was stars—his Ganmen were all star-shaped, e.g.—and Simon even prefaces the transformation by stating the name of the episode: ""Kittan—I accept your last wish. Okay Viral, Boota: let's do this. Time to transform!"" During the transformation process into Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann is when his glasses change.  ""So this is the power of the spiral?

Firstly, Kittan's star-shaped mechs feature six-pointed stars, whereas both the Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann and Simon's glasses are five-pointed. Secondly, the guidebooks mention that the intention behind the design was simply to show that Simon had surpassed Kamina. There was no mention of Kittan.  It's one of those cases where the work surpasses the artist's intentions."

It's because it's a smart, focused, impossibly heartfelt story that takes decades of history in its genre and distills them into a hopeful story about the future of it.  Now go watch the movies. They're basically recaps, but seriously just watch them. You need to know.  Also HAHAHAHAHA Simon and Yoko, that's a funny sense of humor you got there friendo. Yes, I too love completely disregarding all sense of characterization, chemistry, and theming for the sake of arbitrary pairing.

The whole ""screw what others think, what matters is what you think of you"" doesn't really make sense for the show. There's all sorts of sacrifice in the show, so much helping others. Kamina doesn't die for his own sake, neither does Kittan. In fact, the entire conclusion of the show is about each character's sacrifice. The main characters basically are put in their ""Dream world"" where all their wishes come true (Kamina is Alive, Viral has a family, etc) and they give up what is basically heaven for the sake of the universe.   Also, the whole ""man"" thing feels kinda overdone to me."

I found it hard to find an image of a younger Simon with his eyes like that but here's a pic of both with spiral power/Spiral Warrior eyes:   Simon Lord Genome   Circles can still be considered spirals, especially since drills are such a big part of Gurren Lagann, because a circle can still be considered the top view of the drill/spiral. That's what I think anyway."
gurrenlagann,2wpeiq,CUDesu,6,Sun Feb 22 00:24:19 2015 UTC,I thought old Simon had the odd eye because he damaged it during his travels.
gurrenlagann,2wpeiq,FrankCrumpets,12,Sun Feb 22 01:55:59 2015 UTC,"I have always argued the theory that Lord-genome went to far with his spiral power and that's how he ended up defeating himself.  Simon realized that he need to be part human, part spiral warrior so he could sort of stay in control. That's what i thought anyway."
gurrenlagann,2wpeiq,rizenfrmtheashes,2,Sun Feb 22 02:26:00 2015 UTC,That's a very interesting theory and it makes enough sense to me. That explains Simon's eye in the end and how he kept in control despite the incredible amounts of spiral power.  It may not have even be a conscious realisation but just part of who Simon is as a person that caused him to choose that path.
gurrenlagann,2wpeiq,CUDesu,2,Sun Feb 22 03:48:54 2015 UTC,"yeah, I've always assumed it was unconscious and due to his character, not because he willed one of his eyes not to be spiral, haha."

I would say it looks better as circles unless it's in the style that the image you linked does, in that style an actual spiral suits it so maybe it is just for that style (which is generally only in combat in which he is using a lot of spiral power) that they decided to use actual spirals.

Part of this particular example is really just a style thing for Imaishi (who I think drew all the attract art for commercial breaks?), which can be seen in his other works, like his Getter Robo fan art.  I don't have much in the ways of a working theory for it, since thematically, circles are the opposite of spirals, so I'm really not sure why Simon and Lordgenome don't have spiral eyes. Kittan does get spiral eyes for that brief moment during that one scene, though."
gurrenlagann,2wpeiq,Glengi,2,Sun Feb 22 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because you can't see through a spiral, and a circle is the closest you can get and still have functional eyes...?  Lordgenome has spiral chest hair though. His eyes don't really matter at that point."

Simon and co escape their trap and absorb massive amounts of spiral power which they use to access this space and solidify this energy into a physical form with assistance by a great number of Gurrens found inside the sea of Spiral power.

In the absence of one, allowing the dead (who wanted to live and had things to live for, like Kamina) to stay dead when you have the ability to revive them is simply cruel."
gurrenlagann,2w354e,ebai,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:49:39 2015 UTC,We KNOW Simon has the ability to revive them  Letting them stay dead is cruel?  Have fun with that spiral nemesis.
gurrenlagann,2w354e,Winterklang,-1,Wed Feb 18 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"We know that he could have saved Nia. Bringing back the dead without even a body to work with is a different story.  ""letting them stay dead"" they would only revive those who want to live, of course. If the dead are happy being dead they should have the choice to stay that way. But the option to live again should exist for those who want it.  I interpret the Spiral Nemesis as an individual that would abuse spiral power for personal gain, like we see in the prologue (All the lights in the heavens are our enemies). Taking over worlds with gigantic mecha, imposing your will, etc.  I see using SP to make new galaxies for the newly-reanimated to live in to be a humane and responsible use of the power.  I know TvTropes seems to thing the Spiral Nemesis is a black hole made from too much mass in one place, but I reject this hypothesis for a variety of reasons.  Again, the point is moot since there seems to be an afterlife. But I believe that if there isn't one, then it is our duty to make one."

Gunbuster is old so if you can look past the anime style it's a great anime none the less. Possibly even rivaling TTGL, but my favourite is still TTGL!   I watched Diebuster first and then Gunbuster and took it to a whole new angle of viewing the show, it was fantastic."

gurrenlagann,2w354e,varothen,2,Mon Feb 16 20:16:54 2015 UTC,"Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is fantastic. Its shaped like a western cartoon like Johnny Bravo or Dexters Lab, 10 minutes per section, 2 sections per episode, except for a few. lots of sex and dick jokes. imagine a much more mature powerpuff girls. Here is a taste of what kind jokes to expect when you watch it. 13 episodes. I hope you love utter ridiculousness and sexy, i mean cool fight scenes. Also, don't know if its your thing or not, but the English voices are actually better than the Japanese ones. Fuck what I said later on in the post, this is the one show to watch.   FLCL is trippy as fuck. 6 episodes and you wont understand what the hell is going on and you will love every second of it.   Dead Leaves is an OVA that lasts 50 minutes and is a mix of FLCL, Panty and Stocking and TTGL. its high action filled nonsense.  Inferno Cop is 13 episodes, it started as a web show i think. 2 to 4 minute episodes, you can finish it in an hour, and its all on youtube. watch this if nothing else.  Evangelion is a classic, Gurren is a parody of it actually. Eva is super serious, and slower paced, but when shit happens, SHIT HAPPENS. ominous as fuck, with the feeling of god is watching. I love it, but its a way different show than Gurren. 26 episodes and an ending movie to replace/run alongside the last 2  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is also fantastic. make sure its britherhood, not the basic fullmetal alchemist. 2 brothers have the best bond in all of anime, more than Simon and Kamina to be honest, in a world where alchemy is real and its militarized to the extreme. really good fight scenes. cant really show one if you don't understand the consent of this universes alchemy. Highly Recommended. 52 episodes  Afro Samurai isn't a show, but rather an OVA with good fight scenes. think samurai champloo with Samuel Jackson as the main 2 characters. if that means nothing to you, feudal Japan with hip hop with the main character being a badass voiced by Samuel L Jackson."
gurrenlagann,2w354e,vinnycthatwhoibe,1 point,Tue Feb 17 06:35:09 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear that it was Rossiu who ""revived"" Lordgenome because he wanted more information, and many of Rossiu's decisions were . . . questionable at that time.  It should also be clear that Lordgenome was something of a zombie/computer hybrid, and I doubt anyone would want Kamina to simply be a head in a jar. While I certainly recommend much of Gainax's work in terms of animation style (FLCL feels like ground zero for much of Gurren Lagann's style and aesthetic), if you want more hot-blooded big robot action, then you need to look up super robot anime.  Unfortunately, most of these shows were made in the 70s as barely more than toy commercials and the animation has not aged well, but if you're willing to put up with that, there are plenty of classics like Mazinger Z.  Since the 80s, Gundam and more realistic robots have kind of taken over (thought I think they're still very good; I recommend Gundam 00), there have been a few shows that follow the super robot style, most notably GaoGaiGar, which is part of the Brave series and Super Robot Wars, which is based on a video game series.   If you're looking for recommendations outside of the mecha genre, I'd suggest poking around the likes of /r/animesuggest and Anime Planet for that.  EDIT: forgot a word"

I've had a lot of freelance to catch up on, so I'm pulling a lot of long stints and all-nighters. Gurren Lagann is so familiar to me (I've probably watched it from start to finish about eight times) so it's easy to have it on ""in the background.""  The pacing of the motivational plot subconsciously helps me keep work going pretty well.  So, yeah, this is the third time binge watching the series in the last couple weeks. I don't see me ever getting tired of this show. I can't get into most anime, but Gurren Lagann is one of the few that not only connects with me, but obviously entices me to rewatch it several times over and over. Simply put, it's one of my favorite stories of any medium, ever."

Still, he's the leader of a group, and he'd have Yoko to fill the empty hole in heart, maybe.  Who knows?  It would be pretty different.  Then again, if Simon died instead of Kamina, it wouldn't have had as much of an impact on us, and the show wouldn't have been as good.  shrugs"

gurrenlagann,2vq054,xFusion009,5,Sun Feb 15 03:49:31 2015 UTC,"If they ever got to the stage where Team Gurren was head of government, I imagine that he would become very dependant on Rossiu, since he would need someone to back up his bravado, and Rossiu's resources and management skills would fill that gap nicely.   Eventually a rift would form between them, due to their drastically different personalities and methods, and a civil war would occur. Lots of people would die, this would prevent them from triggering a reaction from the anti-spirals, but it would also mean that mankind would not evolve as steadily. Even after the end of the war, both factions would forever hold a grudge against each other.  EDIT: Actually, I can't picture Kamina in an office discussing the logistics and infrastructure of a megalopolis, I wouldn't be surprised if he retired with Yoko and left Rossiu to do the thinking. Which would still end up being an undesirable outcome."
gurrenlagann,2vq054,Nihillo,2,Fri Feb 13 05:39:32 2015 UTC,It'd would make sense when you put it that way aside from the civil war it'd make sense to see him married to yoko and him having a kid named after simon in honer of his fallen little bro.
gurrenlagann,2vq054,xFusion009,4,Sun Feb 15 03:52:57 2015 UTC,Then I guess the story would be a lot more depressing?

gurrenlagann,2viupg,rofljay,17,Wed Feb 11 10:23:35 2015 UTC,Starting after episode 8 is when the show really kicks into high gear though. That's almost like watching a really long epic movie and RIGHT before the climax you just decide to turn it off and never watch it again.
gurrenlagann,2viupg,GenesisHell,17,Wed Feb 11 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"The thing that gets me is that people get so caught up in Kamina that they forgot Simon is the main character in the first place. Kamina's death is necessary for Simon's character development, since if he had lived Simon would continue to just follow in his footsteps. Simon becomes a greater man than Kamina, he just needs a bit more time."

gurrenlagann,2viupg,FNDtheredone,6,Thu Feb 12 07:52:26 2015 UTC,They all thought the rest of the series was just more filler after 7 and didn't see it picking up much more and gave it the boot.

Kill la Kill took some of the goofiness of Gurren Lagann and really emphasized it, which I liked a lot. KlK took a lot of things from Gurren Lagann and emphasized it actually. They have very similar feels to them since they're made by the same company with many of the same employees. They're different, but most of their essence is the same I guess is what I'm trying to say. I'm sure you'll like Gurren Lagann.   I'm really tired right now sorry if I was kinda rambly in this comment  edit: Also either subbed or dubbed you can't go wrong either way imo"

No, epic cannot even begin to describe Gurren Lagann... nor can Legendary. Those two words don't even come close to doing this series justice. William Shakespeare would need to be revived just to create a new word that justly describes Gurren Lagann."

Gurren Lagann is kill la kill x100. The scale and message of Gurren Lagann is way better than in kill la kill.  I enjoyed kill la kill quite a lot -  gave it 9/10. Then I watched TTGL and it was everything I wanted and more. It actually feels like it's impacted my life -  I feel like such a more confident and stronger person after watching Gurren Lagann. Kill la kill was great,  and I loved it a lot,  but it has had no personal impact in the way that Gurren Lagann hit me."

gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,TheIntellectional,14,Fri Feb 6 06:03:34 2015 UTC,"Ill take a shot at it,   It was Virals duty to watch the destiny of the universe unfold, so I believe it was because of that reason that Simon put him in Lagann. They obviously could not predict that they need more than what Simon was putting out, but luckily Boota filled in and helped out Viral. They were all trapped in scenarios where they would be happiest (simon with kamina, viral with a family, etc) and it just took a reminder of other Kamina (which also made Simon the happiest) to snap Simon out of it so he can get the others out and break free (with probably spiral power) Did you notice the anti-spiral planet? all of their bodies laid trapped (similar to the matrix) and the collective conscious of all those people created the single anti-spiral entity with the power to dominate the universe. Theres nothing else given beyond that.   does this help?"
gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,Topher_Raym,3,Fri Feb 6 06:13:53 2015 UTC,"I see, thank you. I suppose the Viral thing makes sense, even if it's not necessarily the best. Also, the way it looked to me, the Anti-Spiral had actually sent all of their consciousnesses to an alternate timeline. I guess it makes more sense as a purely mental thing.  I do understand what the Anti-Spiral is but that still doesn't adequately explain why it's so powerful to me. The point of Spiral Power is that it can grow and evolve, which is why it's basically infinite. The Anti-Spiral is stagnant. Its uprising was also described as a ""rebellion"", indicating that it was outnumbered by the Spirals.  That being said, in the final battle, it ultimately came down to Team Dai-Gurren's determination to survive and protect their loved ones versus the Anti-Spiral's determination to protect the Universe in the only way it thought it could. Perhaps the Anti-Spiral people saw the Spiral Nemesis as terrible enough that their resolve to stop it was enough to challenge the Spiral Races without the growth offered by Spiral Power."
gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,Seathninja,1 point,Fri Feb 6 06:38:12 2015 UTC,Viral was the only one without a gunman as his was destroyed in episode 17.
gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,Pencildragon,6,Sun Feb 8 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of fan theories I've read that speculate when Lord Genome gave Viral a body that would never wear out he also received some kind of untapped spiral power. This is supported by Viral's dream in which he had a family, Beastmen were created sterile and without the desire to advance themselves as an entire race or procreate(two traits present in all spiral races).   Some of them go on to say that Boota could produce enough spiral power to help Simon because Boota was actually just harnessing the spiral power inside of Viral(of which Viral was clueless of and couldn't use).  Makes enough sense for me to accept as headcanon lol.  And on the topic of skilled gunmen pilots, keep in mind they spent probably over half of the show before the time skip just fighting Viral, and every time he got better and better. He had his own couple episodes, every time they were fighting a major foe he was there, ect. Just my opinion, I think there was nobody better suited to piloting Gurren Lagann than Simon and Viral at the end."
gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Fri Feb 6 09:39:16 2015 UTC,"The way I saw it was that he was fantasizing about having a family because part of him wanted one, and being a beastman that could never be reality.  And yes, his piloting credentials are pretty good. I suppose if they thought they wouldn't need more Spiral Energy than Simon could generate, Viral would have been the best choice."
gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,Lord_of_Bored212,1 point,Fri Feb 6 15:46:57 2015 UTC,At some level Lordgenome giving Viral an immortal body probably did involve imbuing Viral with Lordgenome's spiral energy since Genome had lived like a thousand years through spiral energy and Viral at one point shows that his body heals similar to how Lagann heals damage to Gurren when they combine
gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Fri Feb 6 17:51:18 2015 UTC,"As far as Viral goes, it's pretty obvious that Gurren Lagann can function at full capacity (as far as combat and all that goes) just off of Simon's spiral power. Plus the beastmen piloting Gunmen is from solar energy I believe (hence only fight in the day) so Viral wouldn't be able to energize the other gunmen. So he's their best gunmen pilot besides Simon and Simon on his own can fully energize Gurren Lagann. It's pretty obvious they didn't need another pilot with strong spiral energy to power it based on Rossiu being Gurren's pilot before, they just need something with good technical control. Gurren is really just a vessel for Lagann to use then it is its own mech when combined anyways."
gurrenlagann,2uyk1b,Glengi,2,Fri Feb 6 17:48:19 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is Simon's power did falter for a bit, and Boota was able to energize Gurren Lagann from Gurren's cockpit, but it's possible that nobody knew all this could happen."

gurrenlagann,2upeyk,type40tardis,30,Fri Feb 13 01:17:39 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue is his ego grew to the point where he thought he knew best and he refused to try to communicate what was needed and instead just orchestrated a hostile takeover.

gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Solidkrycha,11,Wed Feb 4 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Rossiu lives in a universe where fighting spirit alone can literally do anything. They know well enough by that point that Spiral Energy can directly create matter based on the amount of drive in a person. Simon, more than anyone else, even the Spiral King who is likely centuries older than Simon, had as much raw Spiral Energy as he had. Rossiu sentenced Simon to death because he thought that fighting against the Mugann and Anti-Spirals was impossible. Rossiu is one of a very small number of people have actually co-piloted Gurren Lagann and it sure wasn't his fighting spirit powering for the most part. How anyone in Team Dai-Gurren could ever, for a second, think that Simon couldn't beat something back with Gurren Lagann is just outrgaeous. Hell even if I was just Zorthy I'd still have complete faith in Simon despite hardly interacting with him, being his co-pilot would absolutely convince me of his captabilities. It's not that Rossiu was an ass, it's that he was a stupid ass who thought he was smart and making a deicision for the greater good when it was so obvious everything he thought was wrong.  Of course Simon could beat the Mugann and the Earth Eradication system, of course using Spiral technology would win, how else would Lordgenome have taken command of the entire Earth by himself? Of course turning everyone against Simon was stupid, he's the usurped the Spiral Throne with righteous reason. Of course executing Simon wouldn't solve anything, who says that'd stop the Eradication device? Of course not everyone wants to live above ground, why force them to do so? Of course forcing Simon into the Grand Leader of Earth was a bad idea, he was never one for politics or anything like that. Of course making the ""main"" squad of Team Dai-Gurren into figure heads was a bad idea, who the hell thought Jorgen and Balinbow could ever do anything other than fight and eat? Of course there's a way to beat back anything, when have an understanding of science and physics enough to create an actual advanced civilzation in under a decade, you have to understand how incredibly powerful the ability to create and convert an infinite amount of energy directly into any form of matter would be. He was just so damn sure of himself the entire time through despite all the evidence saying otherwise. If he knew anything other than how politics worked, he would have realized how wrong nearly everything he did was."

gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Raptorianxd,4,Wed Feb 4 07:07:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly. How could anyone think that destroying Gurren Lagann is a positive step. You're worried people are gonna revolt? What do you care if they do, they'll get over it when you stop the moon from impacting on earth. And how you gonna do that? With Gurren fucking Lagann, the thing that has never once failed to win the battle for humanity"
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Jackmp200,8,Wed Feb 4 18:16:51 2015 UTC,It's just hard to forgive this asshole.
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Jackmp200,7,Wed Feb 4 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"I read Rossiu as a figure piece for any world leader that's enduring times of war. We're supposed to learn from his mistakes as well as see why he chose them so that we can do better.  It's so we can know that we need to be able to forgive ourselves even when what we thought was best... tough choices we thought we needed to make... turn out to have been wrong. We all make mistakes... but just as with every character in this series, we move beyond who we were before and become stronger and wiser.   This is a work of fiction. Though it wouldn't be consistent with the premise of the show, it's easy to judge Rossiu with the hindsight that he was wrong. He could have ""been right"" if the writers so chose, even if all his decisions were horrible. In life you will get stuck between many bad options and not have the clarity of mind or intuition to know there may be others. That was his world. Simon helped break him out of it.   And let's not forget that some of what Rossiu did wasn't just good. It was necessary. Reviving the Spiral King for example, no one else would have taken on such a despicable task with that seriousness, precaution, or foresight but he knew there was a need for the Spiral King's mind.    You can be upset at his betrayals of course... I could barely watch those episodes from how upset I was at him, but I understood where he was coming from. He didn't have the guarantees we did as the audience that things would turn out okay. We get to sit back and judge. We don't have to be responsible. Imagine being a leader of a war torn country. What kinds of decisions could you find? What would you be willing to choose for your people? What would you be willing to sacrifice?   Of course I agree, he should have conferred more with at least Simon. But Simon was aloof until he was forced to get back in Lagann. The rest of the government was too incompetent to trust on serious issues. I think he had good reason to believe he was the only one thinking clearly about things. But this show reminds us that our minds can be a trap. Common sense may block our vision. That's what seeing the invisible is about. Our minds naturally go into egoic over-analysis when we're under duress. We all have it in us to become Rossiu. But it takes continual practice and awareness, continually checking in with our own potential to break through our anxiety and fears that make us so small. The show's main lesson is not an easy one to accept when there are so many things on the line.   tl;dr I can't judge him without judging myself too."
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,niko629,2,Wed Feb 4 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"His mistakes are understandable in real life. Many of his motives are even preferable in a real-life leader.  In TTGL, someone as smart as him should have known better. He has born personal witness to what Spiral Power is capable of. Not breaking through anxiety and fears, but breaking through the laws of physics themselves.  Any form of self-doubt at that point in TTGL is automatically despicable because it's so obvious that confidence for yourself (Simon) or bluffing your way through for others (Kamina) is all it takes to succeed."
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Grimpillmage,4,Wed Feb 4 20:55:13 2015 UTC,Any point of self-doubt at that point in TTGL is automatically despicable   I feel kind of like the entire point of the series just flew over your head at the speed of light
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Grimpillmage,2,Wed Feb 4 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"...within the context of the TTGL universe, self-doubt will make you lose. Blind confidence, the power of love and friendship, and shouting out names of your attacks will make you win.  Rossiu is intelligent, and wanted to win. Therefore, he should have realized at the very least to hide his self-doubt from others in an attempt to maintain morale for the team."
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Lord_of_Bored212,5,Thu Feb 5 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"Well, he did hide his self-doubt, which is why almost everyone was surprised to find out how hard he had been on himself over the whole thing.  I mostly took issue with your phrasing. The really ridiculous stuff only just began to happen with the introduction of Arc-Gurren Lagann, first of all, so there was no good reason for him to believe that what had worked before would work again against this foe, who could effortlessly drop the moon to Earth--it certainly wasn't a  good idea to bet the entire race on those methods, at least.   Second of all, it's not despicable to doubt yourself--Gurren Lagann doesn't think so at least. Remeber Simon and Kamina's whole ""I'll always be there to belt you one"" thing? It's not despicable to doubt yourself and fail. It's not despicable to fall, and pretty much give up. There'll always be obstacles you can't overcome by yourself. That's why that line is so damn moving. Simon and Kamina are both snapping a friend out of his downward spiral by saying, ""hey, you know, I think you're pretty great, even if you don't, and I'll always be here to slap you back to reality when you lose perspective."" The importance of having a person who can be there to pick you up when you fall is one of the biggest messages in the show."
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,GokuSS4,1 point,Thu Feb 5 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"Ah. You misunderstand me. What I meant was, essentially, that after the defeat of Lordgenome, Simon had learned to believe in himself, and it was pretty well established that self-doubt was not the answer.  So for us to see someone, post-timeskip, that had been involved in the previous events clearly moping about and doing morale-destroying things (like trying to scrap the mecha that is the symbol of your victory, moping about around his direct subordinates, etc) is bad (despicable is too strong a word, and poor phrasing I agree) especially when he should know better. After seeing Simon down in the dumps and then his triumphant return, no one in the main cast should ever feel depressed/self-doubting about an enemy force again. After he saw the first Mugann get destroyed, he knew he was against an enemy that can die. And when you have Spiral Power, if the enemy can die, you have a great shot at beating it.  Since his species' ENTIRE TRUMP CARD is Spiral Power, and his attitude leads to a direct reduction of it (as a leader he can influence many many people), his not seeking a pep talk/not trying to get over it himself nearly doomed humanity.  I guess I felt it was [something weaker but in the same vein as despicable] because he shouldn't have let himself get depressed in the first place--he wasn't clinically ill or anything, it was all attitude. IIRC, he was the only member of the Dai-Gurren-dan that was anywhere near despair prior to the point where they were losing to the Anti-Spiral. If he had stayed positive, thrown out a few Kamina quotes over a city-wide loudspeaker and got everyone pumped up for Simon instead of against him, they would have sustained far fewer casualties than they did. And, again, Rossiu should have been able to figure this out."
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,BeyCastillo,1 point,Thu Feb 5 13:13:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Again, I get what you're saying, but despicable was too strong of a word."
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,Barthas,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I'm getting at. I'm not saying he's free of blame, or you shouldn't be mad at it while it's happening, but even after his character arc has pretty much completed and he's gone about redeeming himself the best he can I just keep hearing shit like ""god I wish he killed himself."""
gurrenlagann,2upeyk,MegaLordmuffin,4,Wed Feb 4 21:23:01 2015 UTC,"I have a few simple problems with Rossiu. The first being that he, the rational, clear thinking person that he was, would be willing to execute such a powerful trump card. Yes, he wanted everyone to follow his plan to escape, yes, he didn't want to trust in Spiral Power to save them, despite how many times it had saved them before. But why would you destroy your most powerful weapon? Why dull the edge of your blade by literally loading up the bottom half with explosives (and your girlfriend)? His plan would have made much more sense if he had been willing to incorporate Simon into it, instead of trying to kill him.  My second part is that he just expects Simon and everyone else to just go with it. They've never shown to be the type of people to just run with their tails between their legs, and he just expects them to fall in line, because he's right and he knows it, they should too.  The final part is that he is a contradiction. He talks about saving the lives of the people, but he willingly calls for execution of one of the people who should be his, and straps another with explosives to suit his needs. He cared about the people too much, and lost sight of who the people were. He sits in the Gurren with Simon, seems just as excited as everyone when Simon comes back to fight, when Simon becomes the leader of Team Dai-Gurren. He seems just as satisfied as everyone else when Simon beats the Spiral King. Had he resented Spiral Power all that time? Because he sure didn't seem like he did."

gurrenlagann,2tzb6v,smidgeonnn,2,Wed Jan 28 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"The creators love saying crazy shit about Kamina that's not really backed up by anything.  In STTGL's case, while I can believe that the combined hopes and prayers of Dai-Gurren might manifest as a Kamina-shaped figure (in fact that's what happened in the infinite probability prison, though IIRC it's only the movie that inserts Kamina into everyone's dreams), STTGL looks nothing like him. In fact, it's just straight up giant Simon at one point."

gurrenlagann,2tzb6v,TehEefan,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:28:05 2015 UTC,I thought it is more the Kamina that everyone in STTGL believes in rather than the actual one. You know as in believe in the me that believes in you. He was the symbol for them believing in themselves.
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,tsularesque,13,Tue Jan 27 18:52:49 2015 UTC,I believe the actual canon is that it's an alternate reality in which what would happen if Simon gave into the Spiral Nemesis. When they made the show they made the show they didn't have a way to really tie it in once they were getting to that part of the series so they just dropped it. Fans came up with the alternate reality idea i believe and then it got accepted as canon
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Tue Jan 27 20:01:58 2015 UTC,This is what  I usually tell people that ask.
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,Whodat402,16,Wed Jan 28 12:29:29 2015 UTC,There's a theory that it's Kamina's dad with boota in the original attempt to overthrow the anti spirals. Google it. It's pretty awesome.
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,vinnycthatwhoibe,11,Tue Jan 27 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"Just Googled it, headcanon accepted. In reality I'm pretty sure the animators just weren't sure where they were going but had a vague idea and the prologue thing is that idea."

gurrenlagann,2tvahg,digiexafan,3,Tue Jan 27 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, great article. It put into words why I love Gurren Lagann as much as I do.    As for the end, I think that both theories can be accepted. Maybe the Bad Ending is what nearly happened with Kamina's father before Simon, and by showing what had happened before they also show how Simon is different from his predecessors."
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,Aperture-Employee,3,Tue Jan 27 20:44:29 2015 UTC,/r/tsularesque the theory he is referring to is here
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,Topher_Raym,2,Tue Jan 27 23:41:12 2015 UTC,Evangalion uses large amounts of symbolism.    uhhh...
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,psiphre,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:19:32 2015 UTC,"It's almost certainly not Kamina's father. Genome murdered almost the entirety of the rest of the spiral warriors that fought alongside him. Furthermore, if the core drill/Lagann was Kamina's fathers, why didn't he take that shit with him when he went to the surface before being killed?  Also, spiral warriors can use spiral power which is the power to create energy from nothing. If that man is Kamina's father, how did Kamina's father die like a bitch even without the core drill?  It's a bad theory."
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,HellsArchitect,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:29:51 2015 UTC,Because Genome double crossed them and Kamina's father went to face him man to man for doing so. Makes perfect sense to me.

gurrenlagann,2tvahg,IrrelevantLeprechaun,3,Tue Feb 10 01:55:23 2015 UTC,They completely changed it in the first movie but I like the kaminas dad theory
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,JoeyKingX,2,Tue Jan 27 22:57:08 2015 UTC,"It would nicely explain where Kamina got his symbol from. We know that his father wore a cape and carried a skull ornament; if his dad/granddad fought in the first Anti-Spiral war then that could just be the symbol of the OG Dai-Gurren-dan.  I would love to see the adventures of Kamina's dad/granddad, fighting the power all alone, with no ganmen, all to take revenge on Lordgenome the Betrayer."
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,Glengi,2,Wed Jan 28 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"I believe it is first and foremost a teaser, to assure the audience like ""yo don't worry, this shit is going to blow your minds later"", but it retroactively worked around really well in either the ""Bad End"" theory or the ""Kamina's Dad"" theory. I personally subscribe to the Bad End theory myself, because the parallel highlights Simon's heroism in the real ending."

Basic idea was that it was another branch of the infinite possibility prison, in which Simon gave in to the allure of Spiral Power, went to war with everyone ever, and caused the Spiral Nemesis."
gurrenlagann,2tvahg,Cragnog,1 point,Wed Jan 28 09:05:56 2015 UTC,I read that the show was originally planned to have around 50 episodes and it was going to fit in somewhere in there.

gurrenlagann,2tpa8z,JealotGaming,2,Tue Jan 27 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"I watched Gurren Lagann two years ago. It pretty much opened the door to anime for me. I'll never forget watching the entire thing right then and there in one day, barely able to sit in my seat. My older brother happened to come near my room and called me a nerd when I explained I was watching an anime called Gurren Lagann. The next day I could hear him literally screaming in excitement from his room on the third floor. So I understand where you are right now, but there's more to watch, more to the story. Gunbuster and Daibuster are what I'd call the spiritual predecessors to Gurren Lagann, a LOT of the themes are taken straight from these shows and in my personal opinion these shows take place in the same universe wayyyyyyyyyy before Gurren Lagann happens. I just have to warn you, Gunbuster is an old show and I almost dropped it early on, but stick with it. Remember that these are the people who made Gurren Lagann and god damn they know what they're doing. Now, Daibuster was made in 2004 and is an absolute masterpiece. I don't know if I'd call it a sequel, but you absolutely have to watch Gunbuster first. I wish I'd known about these when I finished Gurren Lagann, but I missed my chance to experience the full story all at once for the first time. Now you have that chance, I hope you take it. And if you do, let me know how it goes."

Lots of personality in her, honestly, probably more than Nia who is just played up to be Naive and become inspiration for Simon to go on.  Boob and ass shots are just eye candy, they're the same as Kamina and Adult Simon being shirtless and shit all the time.

gurrenlagann,2sr54p,kawaiineko333,3,Mon Jan 26 12:37:04 2015 UTC,I would see mako as kamina and bolin as simon since they have the bro thing going on. Hiroshi makes sense as lord genome as the whole character arc of him being evil then redeeming himself at the end. The only reason i said tenzin as genome was because they kinda look alike. Tenzin imo works well as daiyaka with the whole mentoring yoko and having a new baby.

gurrenlagann,2stb27,Caleb_Aurion,11,Sun Jan 18 07:29:45 2015 UTC,"This might be a little heavy, but my grandfather was a seriously awesome guy. He fought in WWII and then he was a teacher, so everyone in my community knew him or knew of him. He built an amazing reputation for my family, so much so that when people heard my last name and recognized the connection, they automatically assumed I must be a pretty rad dude if he was my grandfather.    Right before he died, someone in my family told me that my Gramps built our reputation from scratch and worked hard to keep it so pristine. They told me that it was my job to keep that reputation shiny so that my son (who was about to be born) could benefit from it like I did. It hit me really hard and I am determined to carry on where he left off. His legacy is important to me and ever since I realized all that, I've loved him even more.    That's how I see Kamina. He built the legacy and passed it to Simon (and the rest). If he would've been an okay guy, his death wouldn't have meant much, but because he was so inspirational to so many people, the fact that he died and could no longer continue to inspire them made everyone step up so that the legacy wouldn't tarnish and disappear. It affected Simon the most because he was the closest to Kamina, but it afftected everyone else as well."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,ArtaxNOOOOOO,4,Sun Jan 18 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"The way I describe the show to people is this: everything up through episode 8 is like a prologue series. It's tonally different, it's got two main characters, etc. It's important beyond just establishing the series though, because it gives us the initial incident. The thing that spurs on the action for the rest of the series really is Kamina's death. The writers knew this so they gave Kamina lots of screen time so that fans would connect to him and love him and be sad when he dies as opposed to someone just telling us ""you should be sad this guy died"". As for did it need to happen for Simon to become who he is? Sort of. Simon probably could have become a really good warrior with Kamina still around, but not probably to the spiral level he does. Gurren Lagann would have 2 good Spiral Warrior pilots instead of one amazing one, since spiral power is fighting spirit and Simon's fighting spirit really gets a shot in the arm in episode 8 onward where it's not just survival he's fighting for, it's to make sure Kamina didn't die in vain and to make him proud."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Lord_of_Bored212,3,Sun Jan 18 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"Not to be a big downer about this, but it strikes me as a bit crude to insist that Kamina ""had"" to die. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't change it, since it was the most dramatic and effective direction the story could take. I simply think we need to get past this notion that killing off a character is the only way another one can stop depending on them. Given time, Simon would have developed into a fine adult, probably even the leader of the team! He probably would have just taken longer, instead of being forced way out of his comfort zone. Kamina was already all about forcing Simon out of his comfort zone, so he recognized how important Simon's growth was. Again, the way the story did it was great, but a hero doesn't -need- to tragically lose their loved ones in order to be pushed to greatness."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Glengi,2,Mon Jan 19 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"In this one case though it kinda did need to happen for Simon to become what he does. The resolve he gains after the loss of Kamina is what pushes him to that next level, and that resolve gives him a much greater fighting spirit/spiral power."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Lord_of_Bored212,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying I don't think it's as simple as that. Think about when Simon confronted Rossiu after he was arrested. You're saying exactly the thing Rossiu said. Yes, it's practical, and it's not untrue, but that's still a very cold, hurtful, and cruel thing to say."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Glengi,2,Mon Jan 19 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"Slight difference. I'm not saying Kamina had to die for them to succeed in defeating Lordgenome or the Anti Spiral. Together Simon and Kamina would have likely overcome those challenges. But in Simon's development specifically, he doesn't become the spiral warrior he is with Kamina around. His resolve and fighting spirit dont become as strong. It's our challenges that we have to overcome that make us stronger, and Simon's biggest challenge is obviously how he had to find himself and his own courage without Kamina guiding him. When Simon and Kamina get to talk with each other at the end and Kamina comments that Simon is taller than him, it's not just about his height; its symbolic to the two of them realizing how much Simon grew as an individual and how he became an even greater man than Kamina in some aspects. Well a massive part of his growth is having to find his own path, something that doesn't happen with Kamina around. Without that death, Simon doesn't step out of Kamina's shadow, he doesn't become the leader. For one because of how large a shadow Kamina casts, and because Simon wouldn't want to be the leader, he'd follow his bro to the end of the earth, not try to become the leader."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Lord_of_Bored212,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:19:59 2015 UTC,"Aight, I see where you're coming from! I dunno, I understand why it's good and important that Simon ended up like he did by the end (the fact that he remains humble and gives up his power is by far his most important act) but I just think ""Well, he wouldn't end up like he did, so he'd end up as a different Simon. And that Simon might not necessarily be worse."" It's like I said, a person doesn't need to die for another person to stop depending on them."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Glengi,2,Mon Jan 19 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you're saying. Sorry if I came off attacking, just having the discussion. Discussing this kinda stuff is fun"
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Mon Jan 19 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"No no! I hope I didn't come off too confrontational, myself! It's a really interesting topic, that I get a bit passionate talking about, haha."
gurrenlagann,2stb27,Glengi,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"Kamina really didn't have to die for Simon to progress as a character. Simon didn't even evolve as a character directly from the death of Kamina, in fact he regressed as a character after Kamina died. Imo Nia was the one who ultimately caused the most growth in Simon and I think Simon would've ended up the same whether or not Kamina died or not; all he really needed was someone to fight for in a sense.  The only thing that really bugged me was how Kamina died, it felt rushed and the way the whole scenario was set up was pretty lazy. The deciding factor on his death was because Simon got emo after seeing Yoko and Kamina kiss and if that never happened chances are Kamina would still be alive because the whole operation would've gone a lot smoother."

gurrenlagann,2sdyd2,IncendiaryLemon88,9,Wed Jan 14 11:04:48 2015 UTC,"My personal choice is to believe it's the real Kamina. Kamina is still with Simon in his heart, and so in his darkest moment Simon subconsciously brought Kamina back to life to help him. That or Kamina was able to use spiral power from beyond the grave to appear to Simon. Either way it's like Kamina said, he's always with Simon and he'll be there to knock some sense into Simon if he loses his way."
gurrenlagann,2sdyd2,Lord_of_Bored212,4,Wed Jan 14 20:27:21 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I think it was really him coming to snap them out of their illusion.
gurrenlagann,2sdyd2,kc102,2,Wed Jan 14 20:57:24 2015 UTC,I think that since there was so no spiral energy he was able to temporarily take from and see them. Just like how Lord genome has a body in the final fight
gurrenlagann,2sdyd2,ETERNALSPECTRUM,5,Wed Jan 14 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"Just like Lemon said, it's all up to what you yourself think. It could be Kamina himself, as a ""true man never dies, even when he is killed"". It could also be their interpretation of him, especially Simon's. As someone he looked up to, he might have realized it wasn't the real Kamina, and thus began breaking free himself.  So it's all up to you."

gurrenlagann,2s2va8,BebopGuitarist,5,Sun Jan 11 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"Question 1: She was more interested to know, what Kamina think about her or wanted to know more about Kamina in gernerll.  Question 2: I think, she was kinda mad at Simon. Kamina died and Simon was bitching around the whole time.  Question 3: I don't think so. I think, she realised, that Simon isn't a little kid anymore and what maybe the reason was, why he had problems taking  control over Dayakkaiser.  But this is just what I think about it."
gurrenlagann,2s2va8,FitchInks,3,Sun Jan 11 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"This explains it well. She had issues with Simon after Kamina's death, and before it, she didn't mind Simon, but thought he was pretty weak and not really worth knowing, like most of the characters in the beginning of the show. Once he beats Guame for the first time, everyone sees what Kamina (and Nia, I think) saw in him, his true potential."
gurrenlagann,2s2va8,Barthas,2,Mon Jan 12 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"So regarding question 3, you're saying that she discovered that Simon had feelings for her back then."
gurrenlagann,2s2va8,PuffTheMagicHobo,3,Sun Jan 11 21:09:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I think she knew like right away. She would always purposefully cheer him up by showing interest in him because she knew he had a crush on her.

gurrenlagann,2s2va8,arkofcovenant,3,Tue Jan 13 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe people with a better memory, or more knowledge of the story will correct me, but honestly I don't think there's a correct answer to this, and I actually really like that about the series. Most shows/movies are very straightforward when it comes to romantic interest, and that's not how it is at all in real life. In real life, sometimes there are people who you like, and you aren't sure if they like you back, and you never find out, and that's ok. There can still be a happy ending for all parties. There doesn't need to be some thing where they meet up a decade later and say ""oh I had feelings for you all along."""
gurrenlagann,2s2va8,DatBrony,2,Sun Jan 11 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"1: I think your second answer is correct.  2: Seeing how Kamina was only just killed prior to this, she's probably dealing with the same emotions that all of Team Dai-Gurren is. This combined with the fact that it took her so long to actually warm up to Nia leads me to believe that she was just agitated and is not happy about having a new addition.  3: Beats me. I think she is more likely proud of him for finally starting to be the man Kamina always wanted him to be. That's my interpretation."
gurrenlagann,2s3bd6,zeeli,3,Sun Jan 11 20:43:13 2015 UTC,"So, they haven't seen the Parallel Works.  I'd say, go watch them, they're fun.  The idea is they're the universes that each team member is trapped in (like Kittan's, for example), within the Multiwhatever Labyrinth. Only exception is (I think it's) 8, which tells Lordgenome's backstory.   Definitely worth it if the TTGL hunger needs feeding."
gurrenlagann,2s3bd6,Barthas,2,Mon Jan 12 04:08:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the parallel works (really need to watch those sometime), but the movies are ""just"" recaps of the TV show for the most part  'For the most part'. The final battle has been remade in Lagann-Hen (the second movie) and it puts even the series' amazing final battle to shame, so I'd really recommend watching at least that."

Also, they give a little bit more back-story to Lord Genome and who/what the Anti-Spirals are."

gurrenlagann,2s289a,Caleb_Aurion,8,Sun Jan 11 14:36:44 2015 UTC,"""Simon is not god""  He simply didn't want to. He knew from the start that Nia would disappear, if he got rid of the Anti-Spirals and both him and Nia just accepted that. To Simon it would've been the same as reviving her, I guess"
gurrenlagann,2s289a,Tsurii897,9,Sun Jan 11 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"It was because they have a new threat to face, the 'Spiral Nemesis' which will appear once the population of the Universe reaches a certain point. Simon, having made a promise to the anti-spiral leaders that he would not allow the Spiral Nemesis to form, realizes what Rossiu knew all that time ago, it is unfair to try and make his own life better by reviving Nia if it means threatening the fate of the entire Universe by bringing back to life all the people he loves who were lost but then causing the Spiral Nemesis to come and kill everyone else.  Moreover though, he realizes that Spiral Power isn't about looking back and wishing for the past to come back to life, it's about making the best of the present to push forward to a better and more prosperous future. The true essence of Spiral Power is change, but change for the better."
gurrenlagann,2s289a,MasterMachiavel,5,Sun Jan 11 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"Right, I get that. My question is about why he didn't stop her from dying. That isn't looking back, that isn't resurrecting anyone, it's preventing a death. Also I thought the Spiral Nemesis was Spiral Power reaching a point that it breaks the universe, not something about the population. Of course I could be wrong but then why not make her a Beastman body that doesn't produce Spiral power? Especially if Simon was just going to pass the baton and not be involved, why couldn't he not be involved and spend his years with the woman he loves?"
gurrenlagann,2s289a,MasterMachiavel,5,Sun Jan 11 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"More lifeforms will increase the amount of spiral energy used and produced, hence why the anti-spiral extermination devices were all pegged to activate once spiral life planets had reached a certain population. It's roughly the idea that more spiral lifeforms is proportionate to spiral energy.   She is also a an anti-spiral lifeform by her design. There is literally no way to prevent her destruction after the anti-spiral leaders are destroyed, and you can even see Simon realizes this just before they begin their final assault against the Anti-Spiral leader, and Nia hints at her death, and Simon looks shocked, so her death is pretty much inevitable at this point.   I think what it really is though is that Simon was just tired of it all, and again, the whole point of the series was 'evolution' and 'change'. Simon can't interfere with that process of creation of life because then people will be like, 'hey you revived your wife, why can't you revive my loved ones too!' then yet again, too much spiral life and spiral energy is being created. As for your idea of creating a 'Beastman body', according to the show's own spurious but crazy logic as to what 'spiral energy' actually does, I believe Simon only has access to 'spiral energy' in creating life and I don't think using spiral energy to bring Nia to life could turn Nia or anyone else into anything but a spiral lifeform.  I thought it was a pretty happy ending anyway though? If the writers tried really hard, i'm sure they could create some new logic to bring Nia back to life, but thematically, it doesn't make much sense."
gurrenlagann,2s289a,Mxxi,1 point,Sun Jan 11 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Spiral Nemesis is not entirely related to the population of the universe, but with spiral power generation of each life form, so to speak."

It's a huge crossover game between tons of mecha anime ranging from Gundam Wing to Gurren Lagann to Gaogaigar and damn near everything else you can think of. They focus more on recent anime but still include oldies even if it is odd to see Koji Kabuto (non Shin Mazinger Z Hen! version) next to Lelouch. This chapter lets you control TTGL but only for that one map and those are all of its attacks. You can control most of the Team Dai-Gurren although Gurren Lagann is obviously the strongest. You can pull off the Team Dai-Gurren Special if you have all the units near each other. If you like mecha anime in general, the game is full of beautiful fan service (the non-panty shot and boob shot kind) even if it isn't particularly difficult. You won't find it in English though. We didn't get any of the good games in English and there is so much raw dialogue that translations take years and we have very few english patches for any roms.

The sentence that influenced me the most was he infamous ""don't believe in yourself, believe in the me that believes in you."" This is basically: ""you can do this, just believe in yourself"" but said in a way that makes it sound like you have nothing to do. You do things in the faith that you CAN do them because someone else thinks you can do them, even if you yourself don't think you can do them. But in the very end, the tasks will be performed by you. How ttgl impacted my life? I think I became a much better team player, be it at work,nor with friends. I started to encourage my friends to kick logic aside and do the impossible. And yeah, it ident worked out for me. For me, ttgl is not just about overcoming fears, and exploring new possibilities in life, it's also about respect towards our surroundings, which is clearly stated  min the fight against beastmen, which is a reverse PoV on humans eating animals. By being shown how it could be, if animals Had the Power to do this, it encouraged ne to Look on the other side of the coin more often, in various situations. Hope this helps. Brofist"

gurrenlagann,2r56rr,awesomerapta,4,Sat Jan 3 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"Watching TTGL pushed me to look after myself more. It made me realize my self worth by watching Simon grow and change and from that I saw that I too could become what I wanted. I honestly see a lot of myself in Simon. When I was young I was short and weak and got bullied a lot (the scene in episode 1 where the girls mock Simon really hits home for me) from there I just thought about shaping myself into the person I thought Kamina would want me to be. The show inspired me to study harder than ever, to be more confident in myself than I've ever been, since watching TTGL I got closer to my friends and family, and I began to look after my body by eating right and getting fit (I ordered a core drill and I wear it during workouts). Overall the show changed me into the best possible version of myself and I will forever be thankful."
gurrenlagann,2r56rr,Seathninja,3,Sat Jan 3 10:32:29 2015 UTC,"Will reply in a bit, I'm currently busy. but rest assured my life has dramatically changed b/c of TTGL as well."

Im working with the idea that common ground allows individuals to go beyond cultural boundries and establish bridges of between different worlds with different values - a TTGL parrellel would be Simon being contacted by the other worlds of spiral beings, i think there is immense strength found in unity."

I wasn't in the most comfortable living situation when I watched it for the first time, and I'm still not. I work two jobs just to get by, and I've had to give up a lot of things I took for granted because of it. It's felt for a long while that I've just been stagnant, content to eek out my meager existence. But the characters in Gurren Lagann give me hope with their indomitable strength of will, to give 100% to everything I do. Despite all the stress on me, and the depressing reality of 6 hours of sleep and a T.V. dinner most nights, this show has managed to inspire me. It's effect on me can be nothing but positive, the themes contained within encourage me to learn from the past and look to the future, at all times. It is solely because of this show that I will never slow down in my quest to live my life. I may not be where I want to be now, but turn by turn I'll advance, until I bust through the ceiling the odds have stacked against me and drill a path to my dreams! This is the lesson I learn from tengen toppa! With a drill as our soul, not even the real world can stop those with the spirit to create their own heavens!"

gurrenlagann,2r56rr,keinto,1 point,Sat Jan 3 02:53:09 2015 UTC,"One thing I should probably make clear is that Im not saying TTGL is the ""Be all end all"" of inspiring shows, I think any story (movie, book, even song) which deals with united human emotion has the power to evoke change in people. TTGL just happens to be the one I found around the time of some big life decisions of my own!  The last thing I want to do is to preach this show as gospel, what worked for me and for other Trigger fans would not apply to a wider audience, partly because anime still has negative stigma associated with it. Im looking at you, full body pillows haha"
gurrenlagann,2r56rr,keinto,2,Sat Jan 3 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"I used to he REALLY shy, but to a lesser extent than you. I was afraid to ever take risks because of self doubt, and now it's coming back to bite me in the rear. But the thing is, TTGL helped me to get past those fears and believe in myself. I'm a lot more willing to go out there and take any chances I get, whilst ignoring what others think (for the most part anyway.  In other words, if there's a wall in my way I don't run anymore; I crush it down. I've also noticed I'm a lot more open to others, and this is coming from a guy who didn't really have many friends a few years ago; I was always seen as the weird one, but now I'm not afraid to be myself and go out there, and I have tons of friends.  Simon is one of the most inspirational and influential characters I've ever seen, and seeing his growth really resonated with me. Was EVERYTHING because of this show? Not really, but even then TTGL has had pretty much the biggest influence on me and helped give me my current mindset of never packing it in."

I couldnt agree more with you when you say you're now better at recognising and taking opportunities, I noticed the same change in me. Shyness wasnt too much of an issue, Ive always had friends around but I had little confidence in myself and my endeavours until recently. I now know to believe in the me that believes in me!

gurrenlagann,2r4zwk,iceedi,3,Fri Jan 2 21:28:31 2015 UTC,Simon probably lives for a dam long time as a vagabond growing flowers making earth a beautiful place. Viral is off making peace with other lifeforms. Rossiu will be president/leader of earth until his death. Gimmy/Darry will probably stay commanders of the gunman fleet. Everyone else is dead. (Unless consider the movies as canon)
gurrenlagann,2r4zwk,Seathninja,2,Fri Jan 2 21:45:23 2015 UTC,What about yoko
gurrenlagann,2r4zwk,Seathninja,2,Fri Jan 2 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, she goes back and stays a teacher. She was waves towards some school children remember? The show doesn't show her face because they wanted to preserve the young image of yoko in our minds. I assume she does this till her death. I would like to think she still has a wall filled with weaponry tho =p"
gurrenlagann,2r4zwk,Seathninja,2,Fri Jan 2 23:39:09 2015 UTC,Well do you think they still visit each other. And where did you get the information about Simon planting flowers
gurrenlagann,2r4zwk,Seathninja,3,Sat Jan 3 10:31:52 2015 UTC,you obviously didn't watch the moviesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss. Seriously you are missing out. Watch them. Rossiu still talks with Leeron and they probably have to talk to Viral often too as well as GImmy and Darry since they are in the army. Only person who they will prabably never talk to is Yoko and Simon since they arnt part of that life anymore.

Took me a while to finish it though but i got the the time skip part last night and then stayed up watching all but the last 3 episodes i was so enveloped.  Loved everything about the show. All the running themes. The fact the answer to everything was over the top. And best of all the ""fighting spirit and love"" bullshit actually worked (""but  it's crap i can get behind"").  Brilliant brillint show.  Now... Any recomendations?"

gurrenlagann,2qpjav,Seathninja,7,Tue Dec 30 06:11:48 2014 UTC,"Oh Jesus, they should put the fact that there are movies in the sidebar so that everyone can see.  There are two movies, Gurren-Hen and Lagann-Hen  Gurren-Hen is the first half of the anime condensed with (in my opinion) a significant enough of changes and additions that it is worth watching, but you could argue that the changes in this one is minimal and you could skip it. But they really pulled off Simon's comeback amazingly well in this one.  Lagann-Hen however is a whole nother story. It condenses all the slowbits of the anime right after the 2nd half in a very short time and then shit starts to get real. There are plenty of changes and they even added close to an extra 20 or so minutes to the final fight. This is where the meat is and your blood is pumping the whole time.    The 2nd movie is 100% worth watching while arguments could be made that the 1st is skippable but i would watch it anyways. Both movies are about 2 hours each and a simple google search of Gurren-Hen and Lagann-Hen would bring them up.Enjoy the movies m8"

gurrenlagann,2qpjav,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:45:01 2014 UTC,Just got done watching it again for the third time. It's become something of a yearly tradition. One of the few shows i can watch multiple times and still get excited and pumped up. TTGL is a pep talk on speed.
gurrenlagann,2qpjav,Liquid_Boss,-3,Sat Jan 3 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's amazing up to the time skip, then takes a pretty steep decline, only to come out of it in the last 2 episodes."
gurrenlagann,2qpjav,nintynineninjas,11,Mon Dec 29 13:29:52 2014 UTC,"It just redirects its awesome factor to different areas. The first half seems to represent what the will of the people can do against oppression. The second half seems to be what to do when you have something to lose, and differing opinions to deal with.  Still, you get a show that allows you to do all the ""taking seriously"". It spirals out of control (pun partial) with bigger and bigger and BIGGER over the top action until you're slinging galaxies at each other. It seemed to say ""you want to do over the top? here's how it's done."""
gurrenlagann,2qpjav,Liquid_Boss,5,Mon Dec 29 15:18:53 2014 UTC,"I think my primary concern with the time skip is that it seems to shift genres from comedy to just action/action-drama. Granted it may be seen as comedic in the sense of the absurd, but the overall tone is darker and somewhat loses its sense of adventure."
gurrenlagann,2qpjav,nintynineninjas,3,Mon Dec 29 15:21:50 2014 UTC,"Oh certainly. None of where they go and what they do is about just getting there anymore, they're too paranoid the S2 big bad will kill everyone. Everything they do is to prepare for a final climactic battle that almost parodies itself.   I powered through the show in a little under a month, and hit the skip smack in the middle. The comedy side of the show gets you very invested in the people that gave you laughs and righteous punishing of evil-doers. The ""serious"" nature of the second half is powered by that."
gurrenlagann,2qpjav,metroids224,3,Mon Dec 29 15:28:32 2014 UTC,"I think that's fitting for a show that has a time skip where everyone ages 7 years. You lose that excitement, and things get a bit more serious just with aging."
gurrenlagann,2qpjav,thelonelybiped,1 point,Mon Dec 29 16:43:07 2014 UTC,It's also because the series switches focus from kamina and nia to forehead who is very down to earth and serious. (Check out the guide to symbolism on mobile; can't link)
gurrenlagann,2qpjav,tankosaurus,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:38:22 2014 UTC,I was actually more enveloped in the show after the time skip (first couple of episodes were pretty slow but that was to set up the final arc I guess). Everything seemed to come together brilliantly.

gurrenlagann,2qm3h2,Ed_Lad,2,Mon Dec 29 10:14:25 2014 UTC,"Currently, the only complete set you could purchase would be the $600 Ultimate Edition. For those less... wealthy, Aniplex is selling them in a 5-Volume series that's on a rolling release. 1-3 are on sale now, and the others will be released up to march.  The problem is that The US release is priced at $50/volume at a total cost of $250, which is absolutely absurd for a series produced in 2007 that requires no new dub work of any kind and includes very little additional content.   Meanwhile, the Anime Limited Ultimate Edition is priced at ~$200 after conversion and includes a bunch of extras the volume sets here don't have.  Aniplex USA is known for pricy releases and they don't want to go any lower for fear of reverse importation(Aniplex/Sony being the parent company).   I'd import the set you have to the states, but Region Locking makes that a bit of a pain."

What really got me was Viral's path in the Labyrinth, as it's something he can never attain, and that others take for granted.   Nia at the end was unavoidable, and Simon did what he had to to make sure he didn't cause the Spiral Nemisis himself, as his power was growing at an alarming rate by the end of the show (literally powering one mecha with power levels equal to galaxies).  Personally, Kittan wasn't really a character I cared for until I went back and rewatched it recently. His death was still a blow, but not as brutal to myself as say, Kamina or Nia, I just feel they got better development."
gurrenlagann,2qlgeb,Barthas,3,Sun Dec 28 05:51:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I was really feeling proud of Viral's ability to just leave that universe. Considering what the real world is like for beast-men.

And KLK Vol. 3 released yesterday, but shipped weeks ago.  ...It's the main reason why I do all my anime (pre)ordering through them these days, instead of Amazon.

They began going somewhat Gundam with all their logical choices and trying to decide the best answer. This was done simply to show Simon's decision to say fuck it and just do everything.   The one thing I'll say got shitty was Yoko's character. They really just... Stopped caring about her, which sucks."

gurrenlagann,2q61x1,kunk180,1 point,Fri Dec 26 00:30:55 2014 UTC,"I feel that it's such a cheap try at ""character development."" I mean, nothing prior to that episodes suggests she would have any interest in that kind of stuff. It just sort of randomly happens. On top of that, her ""love interest"" with Kitan felt cheap as hell.   I thought on how this could've been improved and here is my suggestion:   Place this episode exactly where the teacher episode happens. While the two of them are in jail, have Viral tell Simon that he knows where Yoko disappeared to. Have him explain that once she saw that Rossiu was forcing people out of their homes, she left to secretly fight against them, where she met up with Viral and the two fought alongside each other to protect humanity (allowing humans to live not above ground or below ground, but where they want to live). During this episode, start to allude to a romance between Viral and Yoko but don't be obvious about it. Near the end of the episode, have Viral say that when the police captured him, she escaped. This allows her to come back and break Viral and Simon out of jail. Once there, she can explain how after Viral's capture, she tried to plan a way to break into the jail. While doing so, she learned of Simon's capture as well and decided she needed to save both of them. Everything plays out the same. Kitan still dies, but goes out like a badass and without that nasty taste in your mouth of a cheap romance. The next change is during the Endless Universe scene. Have Yoko imagine a life where Kamina didn't die and how she could've grown up with him, but have him talk to her about how she has to move forward and not allow herself to be caught in the past, giving them closure and allowing Yoko to naturally get over Kamina's death and happily live with Viral. Cut to Viral's dream. It's exactly the same, but his wife is Yoko and his daughter looks like a mix between the two of them. Still painful, but fits the rest of the alternative tale well. From there, everything just follows through. I think it would've only strengthened both characters if they did it this way and also further drawn the parallels between Viral and Kamina that they so often do anyway.  Obviously, I've done a lot of thinking on this and really wish they had gone more along this line, or not given Yoko a second love interest at all and just let her be a badass Either way, I agree that whatever they did, they could've done a lot more."
gurrenlagann,2q61x1,FeareSe7en,2,Sat Dec 27 02:33:32 2014 UTC,I think that sums up things pretty well.
gurrenlagann,2q61x1,kunk180,2,Sat Dec 27 03:25:45 2014 UTC,"The reason Yoko was given a second love interest was to show her love for Kamina, this is copy pasted from deaths guide to symbolism in Gurren Lagaan-Yoko and her moment in the time-space-labyrinth. As we both know, in the labyrinth the things u experience there/witness is what your heart truly desires. And the first thing we saw was Yoko as a vigilante,then as a teacher, then as the world class sharpshooter, then finally marrying Kittan. Then she turns the tv off, and it all kicks in. Kamina is holding the tv that Yoko was watching and what we can now infer is that Kamina is offering these choices to Yoko to fantazise about and she turned down all these possibilities because deep down she just truly wanted to be with Kamina. I mean look at where they are! It where they first kissed! The volcano is int he background and everything."
gurrenlagann,2q61x1,freakdota,1 point,Sat Dec 27 12:08:59 2014 UTC,"I do totally understand that, but then the show should have done more with that other than just having her say ""Well, I'm off."" I mean, you could argue that they were trying to play her cool, but then we look back again at the mourning episodes. We see Simon's transition from mourning to acceptance, but we never see anything from Yoko. She's just suddenly over it. And then we're given a chance to see it, and the show just skips it and leaves."

gurrenlagann,2p8lba,Dodge2461,4,Sun Dec 14 05:55:47 2014 UTC,Simon's a man now. he could never do something that childish and selfish.    Why is it selfish and childish to keep someone alive?

gurrenlagann,2p8lba,Barthas,1 point,Tue Dec 16 09:10:28 2014 UTC,"Well, at least, is there an afterlife in the Gurren Laggan universe? Do we have enough evidence to think that one day Simon and Nia will be reunited?   Also, will Simon live forever like the spiral king (sort of)?"
gurrenlagann,2p8lba,Barthas,6,Sun Dec 14 06:28:51 2014 UTC,"It's implied by his spiraled eye that yes, he could live for a long, long time. Boota seems to benefit from this effect, too.  Which could be awful, since he'd be outliving the rest of the Dai-Gurren brigade, bar Viral (since you know, the immortality thing).   As for the afterlife thing, just like our world, it's basically up to what you believe.  The ending hit me when I saw it the first time, but it was bound to happen, with Nia being an Anti-spiral. I actually wonder if Simon actually has the power to bring back the dead, after re-watching the series recently. She may just keep fading away, even if he were to. Yes, she had so much more to do, but she's passed and you can't let the dead get in the way of the living, as Simon put it (although paraphrased)"
gurrenlagann,2p8lba,Xethaios,0,Sun Dec 14 07:00:07 2014 UTC,I just bring up the afterlife because we see Kamina again in the final episodes. Though I think he is more of a figure of their imaginations than anything else.
gurrenlagann,2p8lba,Mxxi,2,Sun Dec 14 07:03:50 2014 UTC,"Right, that part.  I'm not sure how I feel about that part, as (I feel) there's certainly something reaching out to Simon, manifesting itself as Kamina to help him escape the labyrinth. What it is, I'm not sure."

gurrenlagann,2o2d5a,megathrasher,5,Tue Dec 2 18:25:31 2014 UTC,"However while that would be tight, it goes against Simons plot development. He grew up and became kamina, he doesn't need him anymore. He becomes his own man"

I would have loved it to have him accidentally create a temporary kamina like with lord genome's body and have them do the kamina speech together then beat the everloving shit out of the antispiral, then have kamina fade away with nia."
gurrenlagann,2o2d5a,thelonelybiped,3,Wed Dec 3 07:38:25 2014 UTC,"While that would have been awesome to see, it does go against Simon's character development. With how the anti spiral universe works, Simon would have to actively create Kamina. The whole thing with Simon's character is that while he carries Kamina with him in his memory and heart, he doesn't need Kamina anymore because he's realized his own strength. Also if he created him, would it actually be Kamina, or just how Simon imagines him?"
gurrenlagann,2o2d5a,Lord_of_Bored212,1 point,Thu Dec 4 14:51:52 2014 UTC,"Have you read children of the mind? I'd imagine the imaginary place that the battle took place in had similar rules(if you haven't then basically if you think of something in there it becomes real but you have to think of it hard) so if Simone thought that kamina would be proud or something, then he could bring him back as he was shown to be lurking about near them in the whole labyrinth thing. And gimmi asked why didn't Simone save nia, which implies that he is able to respect people. Sure it might go against his character but what if they accepted each other as equals then we can see a badass brotherly Giga Drill and have them wreck the antispirals shit"
gurrenlagann,2o2d5a,thelonelybiped,1 point,Thu Dec 4 16:37:14 2014 UTC,"Well they already accepted they were equals. Kamina always saw Simon as his equal, and Simon had realized that he didn't need to be Kamina, he could just be himself. Theyd already had Kamina's final ""I'm with you"" moment as well. I think the movie did it best with the STTGL being in Kamina's image. It implies how Kamina truly does live on in the Spiral/willpower of Team Dai-Gurren, but that they still push forward without him physically being there to guide them."
gurrenlagann,2o2d5a,Lord_of_Bored212,1 point,Thu Dec 4 16:52:27 2014 UTC,I still think it would be cool to have kamina show up and do a speech with Simone before wrecking the antispiral

gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,Rawr-mageddon,4,Mon Dec 1 01:34:56 2014 UTC,"/u/GaiusEmidius essentially answered all the questions correctly. But the opening scene is still hotly debated among fans. The theory about Kamina's dad is well thought out and provides an interesting twist to the opening. But... I actually think that theory involves too much fan speculation.  On my part, I like to be a little more practical. From the Behind the Scenes movies, the feeling I got was that the creators included that scene and didn't know what they were going to do with it by the end of the series. They fleshed out the plot beforehand but thought it would be a good idea to show Simon grown up at the very start (since the show is all about his growth into adulthood). This is supported by how adult Simon's voice actor also voices the man in the opening scene.  The team that made Gurren Lagann (who broke from Gainax to form Studio Trigger) has a real tendency to scream the themes of their show (see Kill la Kill ep 3) and hint at the subplots going on in their anime (see Little Witch Academia for the twists at the very beginning and end of the first episode). I don't think they would include some overconvoluted subplot if they never even bothered hinting at it.  I do think that Kamina's dad challenged LordGenome, which is who LordGenome was referencing in his fight with Simon. But I think it's a huge stretch to go from that to Kamina's dad being a former general in the Spiral army, Boota watching over Simon and Kamina, etc."
gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,DaJoAr,5,Mon Dec 1 15:34:50 2014 UTC,"Older Simon from an alternate universe. Because he crossed over from the afterlife and he chose to visit them. Simon, probably because he knew that Simon would need him to show him the truth, and Yoko because he loved her. Not really explained and doesn't really matter, but it seems that it is just a concept of the better life and they don't get to chose, as they don't realize that they are in a false world, until they see Simon. No, Lordgenome is full spiral, but when Spiral energy becomes corrupted it turns Red, while the anti-spiral energy is more purple. His drills are narrower as a design point, to show difference from Simon. And yes, he kills his entire crew and forces the human race underground."

gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,megathrasher,1 point,Mon Dec 1 02:26:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I thought you were referring to Simon or Yoko in your explanation to my third question."
gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,GaiusEmidius,1 point,Mon Dec 1 02:41:42 2014 UTC,"Nah its kamimas dad. In the English dub the voice actor at the start is kamimas dad and the narrator. And he jingles when he moves, just like kamimas dad"
gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,megathrasher,4,Mon Dec 1 17:30:22 2014 UTC,"It can't be Kamina's father, because humans after Lordgenome never went to space until Simon, and the jingling is a reference to Space Captain Harlock.  The creators confirmed that it was supposed to be a part of the ending, but they decided to go with the ending in the series.   ANN: In a previous convention panel, it was mentioned that the first episode's introductory scene tells a slightly different story than the ending because the story changed during production. What were some of the reasons as to why the story changed from the introductory scene to the way we know it now?  Otsuka: That's where we thought we were going to go when we first depicted it. However, by the time we got there it had grown so much beyond the scale of what we had originally imagined it was going to be, therefore slight differences would be noticed.

gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,GaiusEmidius,2,Mon Dec 1 20:24:19 2014 UTC,:'( I want to believe. I thought the implication wasn't that kamimas dad went to space with lordgenome and that his dad was the spiral warrior he refers to when fighting Simon. And that boota and him are immortal like Lord genome but he died from undisclosed causes
gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,megathrasher,2,Tue Dec 2 00:10:56 2014 UTC,"It's not a bad theory, but I believe that Lordgenome was talking about himself, as shown somewhat in Parallel Works 8 and the beginning of Gurren-Hen.   In all likelihood Kamina's dad probably died relatively soon after he left the village, that's why his bones were found not too far from the village.   I like the theory of Kamina's dad being someone important but the evidence seems to point away from it."
gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,vinnycthatwhoibe,2,Tue Dec 2 00:53:24 2014 UTC,"In the ova they show Lord genome fighting other spiral warriors, so I just assumed that he defeated kamimas dad. And that boota was with kamina's dad. That's how boota knew how to turn on lagann in the first episode"
gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,Workel,1 point,Tue Dec 2 01:45:06 2014 UTC,"I want to believe that Kamina's dad went with Lordgenome to space only for Lordgenome to turn on him and the rest of the crew. Unfortunately, it seems that /u/GaiusEmidius has a good point that Kamina's dad probably died soon after he left the village. It's disappointing for sure if that's the case, but I guess leaving out those specific details out adds to the discussion. That being said, I personally find the Kamina's dad/immortal Boota theory a stretch from the first scene of episode 1 (even if the creators of Gurren Lagann didn't disclose)."
gurrenlagann,2nwa8q,TooTroll4Zama,3,Tue Dec 2 05:42:50 2014 UTC,It's not definitively Simon in an alternate future. There's a theory that that is actually Kamina's father and Boota. It's a really cool and well thought out theory. Look it up!!

gurrenlagann,2nww06,0thMxma,11,Mon Dec 1 15:31:57 2014 UTC,"Well, there's the movies, which are mostly compilations with occasional moments of better animation, and a few new things, but what makes them really worth watching is the final battles of each, which take things even further over the top than they were in the original series.  Also, look into the Parallel Works. They're a series of music videos set to the various pieces of the soundtrack, and a lot of them compose of ""what if?"" alternate-universe scenarios. Some of the highlights include Gurren Lagann as a fantasy series, the roles of the heroes and villains reversed, and Lordgenome's backstory. You should still be able to find them on Youtube.  Finally, if you haven't already, check out Kill la Kill. It's a lot of the same people who created Gurren Lagann behind this one, and it really shows. It's basically a parody/send-up of sorts of magical girl kind of stuff, mixed with crazy shonen (think DBZ) aspects......Hard to describe really, but if you like mostly-naked girls kicking lots of ass in the most insane way possible, you'll enjoy this. It doesn't quite reach the scale of Gurren Lagann, but it's still a very fun ride."
gurrenlagann,2nww06,Sea-Salt,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:23:52 2014 UTC,As others have said. Definitely check out Kill la Kill and FLCL. They are both insane crazy dumb fun and over the top anime made by the same people. Also JoJo's is that to a bit lesser degree. Still very good.

There are a ton of series), Evangelion (Same guys that made TTGL), Cowboy Bebop, FMA (Either the original or Brotherhood, but you may want to start with the original), Black Lagoon, Akira, Ghost in the Shell (Shows and movies), Samurai Champloo, Spaaaaaace Dandy, PSG, Full Metal Panic, Mushishi, Trigun, the boatload of Miazaki movies, Mamuro Hasoda movies, and Satoshi Kon movies/shows, Gankutsuou, Princess Tutu (FUCKING WATCH IT! IT'S BEAUTIFUL!), The Monogatari series, Higurashi, Kill La Kill, Baccano, Durarara, Code Geass, and the first half of Death Note (You'll know when to stop). A lot of these are not ""like"" TTGL, but they are enjoyable on their own merit, and many are, I think, better shows than TTGL. I can personally vouch for them all except Gundam (Ain't nobody got time for that!), and I love all of them for their own quirks. So yeah. Each of these things is great. EDIT: Also, because not adding this would negate a future comment I made/will make, also watch Eureka 7."

gurrenlagann,2n204e,joel_a,4,Sat Nov 22 05:11:27 2014 UTC,"I think your going to have to wean him in the direction you want him to do. Introduce him to one thing after another that is similar, but different to the last.  Show that might help transition him over Knights of Sidonia (Sidonia no Kishi): Has a similar tension release cycle as SnK (Titain), the antagonists share a lot of tropes with the Titans, but it is in space with giant robots.  I think most any sequence for tricking someone from SnK to TTGL has to start with Knights of Sidonia.  As for things after that, it gets a little harder:   Neon Genesis Evangelion or FCLC   You could throw him into Neon Genesis Evangelion, (since NGE is TTGL's evil twin in a lot of ways) but NGE could also derail things. -FCLC might come in the sequence too, but it has similar problems as NGE in that it might throw him off (but its pretty great, short, and if you like TTGL you'll enjoy FCLC too).    One of the more serious Gundam or Macross Series   They range in quality (and I'm not expirianced enough to direct you to the best one for your purposes) but they can be fairly serious plus they help teach a lot of the tropes that TTGL subverts.   Eureka Seven or Eureka Seven AO or Captain Earth   I'd go for E7 here, because it's pretty fantastic, and fairly light hearted while not being absolutely silly. E7AO is E7's pseudo-sequel series (its actually based off of a time line of the E7 universe we haven't gotten to see yet) it is shorter than E7 on average both more ""serious"" and more ridiculous than E7. Captain Earth is more recent, less rushed, and has some pretty wonderful animation. All three are from Bones which has some pretty high standards.    Log Horizon    Not mech at all, but it manages to be serious without being dark. Might help him appreciate shows that don't require character death to cause tension.   Serial Experiments Liane or Digimon Season 3   SEL is trippy, disturbing, and thought provoking. It questions how we interact with technology while managing to be thoroughly uncanny. Not many peoples cup of tea, but it could seriously break down some of his expectations. Its good, weird, but good. (Digimon Season 3 (Tamers) is SEL mixed with pokemon for 10 year olds (and me))   Infinite Ryvius:   300 kids trapped aboard a super powerful war starship with no adults? Yeah, it's kind like Lord of the Flies in space. It's serious, but it manages to keep character death to a minimum and would help him to expand his horizons. (It's kind of sad that more people haven't see IR, I love it.)   Mahou Shoujo: Madoka Similar to TTGL in its deconstructive, reconstructive cycle but goes about it completely differently.  Gargantia Gargantia is fun, and not silly, but not serious by of a stretch of the imaginations. But it is an interesting not-really-mech story that definitely deserves a look at.  Aldnoah.Zero and Terraformers Both of these more recent shows might be smoothing the transition. I don't know a great deal about Terraformers, but Aldnoah is both ""dark and serious"" and completely ridiculous at the same time. Now that I think about at A.Z would be a great transition peace. Have him watch that.    So let's see... Maybe a good sequence would be:   Knights of Sidonia Infinite Ryvius Aldnoah.Zero (Gundam or Macross)//You'll need to help to figure out which is the best one to send him, I don't have a clue Log Horizon/Serial Experiments Laine Eureka Seven/Captain Earth/Gargantia Neon Genesis Evangelion (You might try introducing him to the rebuilds, they are a little shorter in total and a little bit more (just a little bit more) accessible.   once you've worked him out of his little corner of the world you can  PIERCE THROUGH HIS HEAVANS and he might be more willing to go along with the hot blooded mess that is TTGL  This progression should show him things can be good without being ""dark"" and ""serious"" while also preserving the sense of ""What the hell? Okay then. Sure why not? Let's do this thing."" That m1. akes TTGL so great.  Anyone else have any thoughts?"

Especially if he's new to anime.  Hellsing Ultimate would probably be a good way to start that bridging.  Great voice acting and it's serious 98% of the time then peppers in short chibi moments when someone is embarrassed.  I had a similar problem, I just harassed the person and got them over the initial hump.

gurrenlagann,2msakl,Canisinu,1 point,Wed Nov 19 20:07:21 2014 UTC,"I had similar feelings when I finished the series for the first time some years ago, and honestly I'm really glad I felt them. For the first few days (weeks even) I was rather dumbfounded how a show could do that to me. I was still relatively new to anime, so to fill the void I tried looking for other shows that would illicit the same feelings in me. Long story short, I never found anything quite as good but while some came close I found that it just made me that much more fond of TTGL. It's honestly unforgettable, not a day goes by that it doesn't pop up in my head. One day it won't hurt to remember it, I'm not trying to be all touchy feely in saying all of this but in time I think you'll think fondly of it. Now go watch more and forever chase the dream of finding something better (you won't)."
gurrenlagann,2msakl,Canisinu,1 point,Wed Nov 19 23:32:46 2014 UTC,"You're right about nothing being as impactful as TTGL, I've watched about 20 series since completing it about 3 months ago and the closest I've come is Space Dandy, Toradora and Golden Time; and that's only because they had some good characters. I guess I just gotta let time do its thing and let the mourning period pass. But I know that in time I'll be good to go."

gurrenlagann,2m99xp,Cereal_Junior,8,Fri Nov 14 05:04:53 2014 UTC,"Where can I get something like it? Is that even possible?   Well, the two movies have been mentioned. There's also a series of music-video-esque things inspired by the characters named Parallel Works. It's not as good as the main series, nor is it really a contiguous story, but it's pretty dang good and fleshes out some of the background.  Alternatively, you could follow the director, Hiroyuki Imaishi. His first work is Dead Leaves, and I can definitely see the influence from Dead Leaves on Gurren Lagann, but note that it's nowhere near as good. He's also made a surreal comedy series named Panty & Stocking With Garterbelt which I haven't seen yet.  The real standout is Kill la Kill, the series he did most recently. It is also spectacularly good - in fact I'd have trouble deciding whether I prefer it or Gurren Lagann overall. Note that the main series is 24 episodes, with a final 25th ""episode"" OVA released several months later - I strongly recommend waiting at least a few days between episodes 24 and 25. Ep 25 is a wonderful coda but it should not be watched immediately after 24.  As with Gurren Lagann, do not look up anything about it online. Just start watching. (With one exception - be warned that it's hilariously fanservicey, so if you're trying to impress a new girlfriend, starting this series with her may not be the right approach. Depending on the girl.)"

I was really overwhelmed and kind of lost and there wasn't much of an established fandom then so I kind of had to go through the motions myself.

I absolutely agree with all of your opinions except I had no idea that Kamina was going to die.  I watched Gurren Lagann after watching things like Bleach so I was so used to people getting what seemed to be mortal wounds, only to reappear happy and healthy in the next episode.  When I saw Kamina's grave I was just like... Oh holy shit... no wait, that can't be possible! And then I cried a little bit.  Who am I kidding, I cried like a baby!"
gurrenlagann,2m99xp,metroids224,5,Fri Nov 14 16:04:56 2014 UTC,"I would HIGHLY suggest the two movies if you have the time to watch them. If you don't want to watch two of them, you could always just watch the second one, which covers the 7 year time skip episodes. They added quite a few new bits of animation, and it's just really good looking. I'm telling you, the second movie is like, how good the Anime series is times 1000000000000000000000000."

gurrenlagann,2m99xp,CaliBuddz,2,Fri Nov 14 13:13:40 2014 UTC,"It's been maybe 4 years since I've first watched the series, and it still sticks with me to this day. I think it helps that the show reminded me why I got interested in anime in the first place; insane action, memorable quirky characters, awesome music; it's so much better than all the moe crap that's dominating the market.  There's quite a few moments that stand out aside from the obvious ones of Kamina's death and Simon's ball drop. I've always liked that little moment in the first episode, when the gang is busting through that gunman and out of Giha Village, when we see Simon's scared cringe turn into a toothy grin that always makes me think ""Hey Mikey, I think he likes it!""  Also, Viral gets some great moments once he joins the team in the second half of the series, with his line of ""You spout a lot of crap...But this is crap I could get behind!"" being a favorite. It didn't take long for him to become my fav character of the group.  But yeah, I could probably go on all day about this show. And, since I've seen people suggest you check out the movies, I'm going to chime in with how you should look up the Parallel Works. They're basically a series of music videos (using the various background tracks), with the most notable ones being alternate takes on the series. Some of my favorites include Gurren Lagann as a fantasy series, the roles of the heroes and villains switched, and Lordgenome's backstory."

I'll definitely remember this show, and it's really one of a few where I remember characters names after watching it. The connection...the power... the emotions...this show was just incredible."
gurrenlagann,2m99xp,Sunshine_patriot_,2,Fri Nov 14 18:21:39 2014 UTC,I finished 2 hours ago... I'm so sad it felt so short..  That said it blew every expectation I had and is now my favorite hands down.  Edit: Also I can't count on 5 fingers then number of times I've cried and when this show ended (not because of the ending but simply because this amazing show was finally over) I cried a bit. I've been watching it a few episodes a day for the last week or two and it has always been what I've looked forward to most. I'm just so sad to not have much left to watch (still have the movies and parallel works to watch).

I'd say your best bet is to find something good that's completely different from Gurren Lagann. The first show I watched after TTGL was Psycho-Pass, which is incredible, but absolutely nothing like Gurren Lagann. Sort of helped to work through the withdrawal."

However the beastmen don't have the capacity to produce spiral power, so when they were in the pilot seat they were forced to run them using the secondary systems and photovoltaic power supply.  Once Kamina managed to build up a critical mass of spiral energy, the spiral engine and main computer reactivated, scanned him and reconfigured the IFF and pilot recognition to match his preferences."

I'd highly recommend FMAB  if you haven't seen it yet.

gurrenlagann,2kjxb7,BlueXanthus,3,Thu Oct 30 21:26:22 2014 UTC,"Very little, but I don't judge the Japanese voice acting for the reason that I can't understand it.   It's no different than someone reading a book in a language they can't understand and saying that it's well written."
gurrenlagann,2kjxb7,ZombieWolf2508,0,Thu Oct 30 21:31:38 2014 UTC,I feel like you could at least judge the original by the casting choices and tone of voice used by the actors.
gurrenlagann,2kjxb7,rocky4322,2,Tue Nov 4 00:36:05 2014 UTC,"But tone of voice is a huge part of the Japanese language.

Since I don't speak Japanese, I can't properly judge the sub.  Either way, according to what you have said, the conclusion comes to myself having a negative opinion about the English dub.  It's more so people like you who give the community a bad name, who decide to scold the opinion of others, rather than discussing as to why I dislike it.  I'll gladly discuss why I dislike the dub compared to the sub.  And it will be my opinion, not fact."

gurrenlagann,2kikal,Sea-Salt,2,Tue Oct 28 00:43:31 2014 UTC,"The opening sequence in the first episode was supposedly going to be how the series ended, but the writers eventually forgot they were going that route and said ""fuck it, alternate timeline""."
gurrenlagann,2kikal,Beast_Freelancer,2,Mon Oct 27 23:48:23 2014 UTC,"Now,  I'm not 100% sure but I believe that character is not Simon, but is Kamina's father. The reason this scene doesn't happen is because it's in the past, during a previous war."
gurrenlagann,2kikal,T_Flex420,3,Mon Oct 27 23:54:01 2014 UTC,"Possible, but he's got the same coat as Simon rather than the cape Kamina picked up. The captions just say ""Captain"" when he speaks."
gurrenlagann,2kikal,GenesisHell,1 point,Tue Oct 28 00:19:29 2014 UTC,"Another theory I saw somewhere(don't know where) is that was actually kaminas father because he was also a spiral warrior! But before they were defeated by the anti spirals, kaminas father actually took lagann and crashed into jihad village later dying on the surface..."
gurrenlagann,2kikal,Barthas,1 point,Tue Oct 28 03:40:18 2014 UTC,What everyone else said. Also there are two movies that are basically just condensed versions of the anime split into two parts. The anime for Gurren Lagann is actually the source material and the manga came out afterward. I believe it has remained unfinished for quite a while.  If you don't want to see the movies then that's okay but I highly recommend you check out just the final battle at the end of movie 2. That version of the final battle has a lot of added scenes and is much more climactic and epic if you can believe that.
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,T_Flex420,19,Tue Oct 28 15:32:51 2014 UTC,No.  It should be left as is. No jumping the shark.
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,Goose_Is_Awesome,5,Tue Oct 28 15:58:18 2014 UTC,Must we go tropical?
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,Lord_of_Bored212,10,Tue Oct 28 16:54:40 2014 UTC,The only thing I want done is the movies to finally be dubbed. Other that that they shouldn't touch it.
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,bg4strings,8,Tue Oct 28 16:31:40 2014 UTC,Leave Gurren Lagann alone. One of the things that makes a classic a classic (for me) is the fact that its been finished and left alone for such a long time and KNOWING that nothing will ever be continued or added. I respect popular anime that know when to quit and don't attempt to milk the cash cow franchise forever.
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,GenesisHell,3,Wed Oct 29 16:28:19 2014 UTC,I know it's not perfect but honestly I'm scared of what would happen if we opened the box again. Leave well enough alone...

gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,metroids224,5,Mon Nov 3 20:27:21 2014 UTC,I wouldn't mind a prequal following either Kamina's father or Lordgenome back when he first discovered Spiral Power. It'd be really interesting to see more into the history.
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,ZombieWolf2508,2,Tue Oct 28 19:26:20 2014 UTC,"Rather than a continuation, I'd rather see some alternate storyline anime or movie like if Kamina didn't die or something, or a movie based on the spin off manga where they are all in highschool"
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,Kyman111,3,Tue Oct 28 16:10:13 2014 UTC,"I've always wondered what it'd be like if Simon had died that day, and Kamina had lived."
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,AlphaBenson,2,Wed Oct 29 06:38:22 2014 UTC,Even an OVA of that spin-off would be more than enough for me :D

gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,AlphaBenson,0,Tue Oct 28 17:33:50 2014 UTC,"I would like an extended version of the anime. I felt like Kamina didn't get to do too much before he died, and the latter half of the show had some pacing problems, mostly towards the last quarter. Like, at the end of one episode, Super Galaxy Gurren Laggan is introduced. Then, at the end of the next, we're already at Tengen Toppa.   Now that I think about it, I think Ark Gurren Lagann had more screentime when it was acting as the engine of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren than when it was actually out fighting. Such a shame, since I honestly think Ark Gurren Lagann looks the best.  The whole ""multidimensional labyrinth"" could have been its own episode as well. In fact, I think it was a pretty big missed opportunity. Perhaps instead of putting Simon in some alternate universe/AntiSpiral-induced dream where Simon and Kamina are robbers, they could have fabricated a world that Simon doesn't WANT to leave, or doesn't want to believe isn't real, and Based Kamina has to come and smack him out of it.  ""I promise that whenever you start to doubt yourself, I'll come and belt you one!""  Seriously, it's boggles my mind to this day why they didn't just have Kamina just appear out of fucking nowhere and sock Simon in the jaw, all the while shouting ""LEMME SEE YOU GRIT THOSE TEEEEEEETH!"""
gurrenlagann,2kkrdj,Seathninja,0,Wed Oct 29 06:36:12 2014 UTC,"I don't want a continuation, maybe a graphical upgrade/rework but thats it."

gurrenlagann,2kgtp2,anangrywom6at,2,Sun Nov 16 00:17:10 2014 UTC,thats sounds like a great idea!!
gurrenlagann,2kgtp2,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Mon Oct 27 14:54:24 2014 UTC,"As much as I would love more Simon, if there were a season 2 I don't think he could be one of the main characters. It'd kinda go against the whole end of the show, pushing forward a bit with each turn, drilling the path towards tomorrow. Simon has already done what he needed to do. The spiral races wouldn't be moving forward if they kept relying on him to lead them to the new tomorrow. Just like how Simon had to rise up and become who he needed to be, Gimmy and Darry and the next generation have to step into those shoes and win with their own resolve and fighting spirit. When there isn't a path you forge one yourselves, not have Simon forge one for you. Not that he couldn't be in it, but it couldn't have him piloting Gurren Lagann again."

gurrenlagann,2kgtp2,kunk180,1 point,Sat Nov 8 18:31:22 2014 UTC,I think there's a pretty obvious sequel in fighting the Spiral nemesis. It's never super clear on what that is an could lead to some spectacular scenes! Though I'm not a huge Gimmy fan so hopefully we get a more likable character XD
gurrenlagann,2kgtp2,darkplumb90,0,Tue Nov 4 02:42:14 2014 UTC,"Either a prequel, or an ""alternate universe"" series where it doesn't necessarily have to be tied to the original series, yet have the same characters."

Possible they didn't go back and do the movies in 1080p like they did for the series blu ray release, which would explain it I guess.  Edit: btw, the beginning has a lot of grain, most of the movie doesn't look like that.  Edit Edit: Looked around again, larger file here, will update on quality...   Tengen Toppa Edit: Second one has nicer subs (fancy typesetting as well) and better audio, video bitrate is a bit better for some parts but looks mostly the same.

gurrenlagann,2kdkgm,gazamcnulty,2,Sun Oct 26 15:57:31 2014 UTC,"There are two movies: Gurren-hen and Lagann-hen. They basically just tell the story in a slightly shorter version (by doing things like shortening the 3 generals deal). It makes things a little more epic (like adding the Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann). It has higher animation value. As for canon I believe the show overrides the movies but I might be wrong.   Edit: also because I can't believe I forgot to mention: random nudity towards the end of Lagann-hen from Nia and Yoko because Gainax realized if they didn't then GL would be their only show to not feature full female nudity. I mention it because when it happened I was like ""wait what? Why?"""

gurrenlagann,2k9j21,sittinonthesofa,9,Sat Oct 25 08:56:24 2014 UTC,Maybe it was the lack of knowledge. Wasn't the Spiral King who told Simon he could combine with Arc-Gurren and transform it?

If I told you  man can unzip different surfaces and his own body in order punch things from a distance and fall through floors to appear on roofs, would you be able to picture that?  It's insane and usually action packed in most episodes and the pace is pretty quick. While not TTGL levels of moving through episodes, everything is intense and almost every character in the series would belong on Team Dai-Gurren due purely on the amount of manliness they exude (both physically and metaphorically)"

To be honest no anime has ever surpassed my expectations set by TTGL, KLK didn't even come close, I think that if there is an anime that surpasses TTGL, it must be obscure , because I have never heard anyone say this in a sentence: (ANIME) is better than Gurren Lagann."

gurrenlagann,2k7vqm,Sea-Salt,1 point,Sat Oct 25 00:32:52 2014 UTC,"Hmm, this is difficult. I just knew Tengen Toppa was fucking amazing because of this sorta giddiness I felt inside while watching it. Very few other anime have made me feel that way. I'd suggest Fate/Zero. It isn't exactly the quite same epicness :/ (KLK obviously is the most similar) but I don't think there's a show out their that can quite measure up to that level and type of epicness. Fate/Zero definitely delivers though, you won't be disappointed.  On a side note, you should def give FMAB a few more episodes. It's up their with TTGL in my all time fav list. I know you don't wanna waste more time because you think it won't turn out good, but it's considered one of the best anime ever for a reason =P"
gurrenlagann,2k7vqm,NobleSic,1 point,Fri Oct 24 22:52:23 2014 UTC,"Glasslip  imjoking But honestly, what exactly did you enjoy about TTGL? The action, the story, the emotional investment, or the progression of crazy? Maybe even all of it. The thing is that no show will give the exact feeling, because all stories are different.  On that note, shows that I enjoyed around the same amount as TTGL are Log Horizon and No Game No Life."

gurrenlagann,2k4jbi,Dreazy991,3,Thu Oct 23 19:45:35 2014 UTC,"While I like you idea I will have to disagree on a few of your points   Spiral Energy is not a physical object or being and thus could not be an evolution of Life Fibres. It is the utilisation and embrasing of life force and fighting spirit that is Spiral Energy while Life Fibres are a physical creature which exists in a parasitic manner. Both Simon and Kamina were able to use and sense Spiral Energy. Gurren is fueled by it and we are shown many times when Simon gets angry or excited, Gurren becomes far more powerful. I would even argue that Kamina may never of been able to use spiral powers merely embrace and channel them as it is always through Simon he finds victory, he is simply the one to which Simon looks to for inspiration and guidance until he works out how to stand up for himself."
gurrenlagann,2k4jbi,MrSignalPlus,1 point,Fri Oct 24 09:00:37 2014 UTC,"Good points, time to argue with them and fail probably.  *Information on Life Fiber's was kept hidden during the majority of Kill La Kill, meaning not many knew about it or the affect it had on everyone, while I agree that Spiral Energy is hugely different than Life Fibers, I don't think its impossible for them to not be the same, saying that spiral energy is fighting spirit is great, most people in the anime say it, but then again, what does the anti-spiral say about it? The Anti-spiral seems to know the most about Spiral Energy, but yet in memory, I don't remember him saying anything about it at all.  *I would like to push that Spiral Energy was just humans embracing the power of Life Fiber's and calling it their fighting spirit, hell, maybe life fiber's had evolved and learned how to control their intake on stealing energy from humans, allowing them to be inside a host and keep them alive, that would be necessary if they were going against the anti-spiral, to keep hidden untill the host is completely fine with using spiral energy, AKA Life Fiber.  *Also, the three people who are fused with life fiber's could see where they are, something that most characters cannot do.  If Life Fiber's had indeed evolved to live inside the hosts body, and the host is able to fully cooperate with the life fiber inside of them (Like how Ryuko had to be alright with being naked in order to fully use Senketsu) Then it should be possible for them to sense Spiral Energy, AKA Life Fiber.  Sorry for the long message, and if you don't agree with my rebuttals that's fine, i'm bad at this. xD"

gurrenlagann,2jkr2m,SuperRic84,7,Sat Oct 18 17:46:25 2014 UTC,"8 separates the men from the boys, my friend! It was at that very moment when GL went from being good to AAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHTHISISAMAZIIIING!!!"

gurrenlagann,2jkr2m,An_Angry_Walrus,5,Sat Oct 18 18:36:21 2014 UTC,"Re-watched that episode with my little brother (he was watching it for the first time), it doesn't get easier.  At all.  I think it was actually harder the second time around."
gurrenlagann,2jkr2m,Xethaios,2,Sat Oct 18 06:11:39 2014 UTC,"It is indeed harder after the first time.  Source: First watch, eyes got a little moist but nothing else. I was sad, but no tears. Second time watching it with my dad I went to the bathroom to shed a manly tear or two. Or 40."
gurrenlagann,2jkr2m,OpticalJesu5,3,Sat Oct 18 07:36:21 2014 UTC,"It doesn't get easier, you just get used to it."
gurrenlagann,2jkr2m,aSpaceWalrus,1 point,Sun Oct 19 01:48:28 2014 UTC,i still have no idea why the fucking volcanoes went off. was it jut for no reason and had nothing to do with plot?
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,Seathninja,9,Fri Oct 17 03:58:53 2014 UTC,"Thanks you  for this and the TLDR made me laugh out loud in my office, totally acceptable like ""I just wrote this whole fucking thing the least you can do is read it dick."" Hahahaha"
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,b3n4president,3,Fri Oct 17 05:41:28 2014 UTC,"Wait, how does the pink fighting spirit color mean he's horny?"
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,metroids224,2,Fri Oct 17 18:11:47 2014 UTC,"We have to look at how colors represent things. Genome's fighting spirit was originally green, then when he got corrupted by the possibility of the spiral nemesis, it turned red thus indicating corruptedness or something close to that. Pink is a color most people would agree on that represents the more sexy spectrum of colors. I mean think about it like, if (assuming you are a guy) would you think your girlfriend wearing pink is sexier or would green be more appealing?  Even if you think green is sexier, generally most people find pink the most sexual color out of our spectrum."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,FeareSe7en,3,Fri Oct 17 22:45:57 2014 UTC,"I never noticed the colours, but could you could you specify whether or not it was dark green? Green and more so dark green are used to signify ambition, envy and greed. This is just a theory but Genome's fighting spirit could signify his envy towards Kamina's father being the leader of Dai-Gurren. In the quest to satisfy his ambition he backstabs Kamina's father and destroys Dai-Gurren(or whatever the team was called, as Kamina added the Dai). Therefore, after satisfying his fighting spirit, his colour changes from green to red to symbolize that he did what his desires wanted him to do and now he's mad at himself for caving into his darkest desires. Red symbolizes anger. Also the good guys in this show would have different connotations to their fighting spirit colours. This is just an example, but if both Simon and Genome's fighting spirit were green, then Genomes fighting spirit would indicate what I said above but Simons could represent a whole different meaning. Simon being a good guy and the main charecter could have his green fighting spirit represent growth, as green is also used to depict growth. This way the same colour could be used for two people, but depending on their personality and which side they were on, it could mean two totally different things."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,FeareSe7en,2,Sat Oct 18 04:06:49 2014 UTC,Ok I answered it up above near the top. The information i got was from a short video Gainax released about Genome's past. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e2CiFbmQEg
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,HoTdOg1009,2,Sat Oct 18 05:25:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks, just watched it. This anime is probably the best I've ever seen, and the more you think about it the better it gets."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,brbsoup,1 point,Sat Oct 18 06:22:20 2014 UTC,Not to mention the entire episode (up until then) was him and Simon trying to peek at the girls
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,brbsoup,4,Mon Oct 20 16:10:19 2014 UTC,"Kamina is offering these choices to Yoko to fantazise about and she turned down all these possibilities because deep down she just truly wanted to be with Kamina.   Good bye friends, I am gone. This killed me."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,FeareSe7en,3,Fri Oct 24 20:00:25 2014 UTC,I hope in a good way! It kind of shocked me too when i learned how Gainax tells so much story wordlessly.
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,HoTdOg1009,1 point,Fri Oct 24 23:18:35 2014 UTC,"It killed me in a way where I may have gotten teary-eyed. I love reading posts like this so much, I was really glad you included the Boota theory. It's my favorite of all time.  One thing I think about a lot though is when Kittan tells Yoko that he wants to meet her kids. Combining it with what you said about Kamina showing her her options, it now kills me in a way only Gurren could."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,FeareSe7en,4,Sat Oct 25 04:27:16 2014 UTC,Also Nia staying dead was a reason that mattered to the plot a lot. The Anti-Spiral said the constant evolution of Spiral Beings would end up being their destruction. We all know that Simon would have figured out a way to bring her back to life but that would result in him destroying the universe through the Spiral Nemesis. He made the hardest choice in the end. In the end they couldnt just drill through it. In the end reality caught up.
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,Westheimerz,3,Fri Oct 17 04:47:28 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he said the real reason pretty clearly, ""If we bring back all the friends we lost, they'd just get in the way of everyone else."" Over population=Spiral Nemesis, too Much Spiral Power equals destruction"
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,AlphaBenson,2,Mon Oct 20 16:13:16 2014 UTC,Yo can you tell me when that takes place? I don't remember that.
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,the_toad_can_sing,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:17:48 2014 UTC,It was at the very end of the wedding at the end of the final episode.
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,HoTdOg1009,3,Sun Oct 26 21:15:02 2014 UTC,"Made me have nerd chills so hard, Thank you."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,HoTdOg1009,7,Sat Oct 18 01:04:13 2014 UTC,Thanks for reading man! Giving people nerd chills just like I did when I realized these things is the exact reason why I made this.
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,FeareSe7en,3,Sat Oct 18 01:14:29 2014 UTC,"Kamina's Dad being Lagann's original pilot might explain how Kamina just came up with that name during Episode 1 in the English Dub, as well as explain Kamina's obsession with the word ""Gurren"". It's possible that his father could have had said ""Gurren"" or ""Lagann"" while Kamina was around, before he left for the surface. Though, I doubt that Kamina's Gurren was the same as the Gurren part of his father's Gurren Lagann."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,FeareSe7en,2,Fri Oct 24 03:55:09 2014 UTC,"Great post! Your explanation of the labyrinth scenes is great. Especially Yoko's. I considered that maybe she wanted those things she saw and didn't know what to make of kamina holding the tv for her. Now that you say it, its obvious."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,FeareSe7en,2,Mon Oct 20 02:30:15 2014 UTC,"In the bit about Lordgenome's childhood, he's surrounded by an anteater (Guame), a bird (Cytomander), a scorpion (Adiane), and a tiny gorilla (Thymilph)"
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,mastercoates,2,Mon Oct 20 16:07:32 2014 UTC,"The last episode, when Gimmy says that Simon could use Spiral Power to bring Nia and everyone else they lost back to life"
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,dafuq0_0,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:37:20 2014 UTC,"Yo! I got one more. This one is more outlandish. I'd like to actually start a discussion on this. So, my theory is that Old Coco is Simon. I know that it says he's a beastman and he was Nia's caretaker, but I've just got a hunch on this. In the anime it just says he was a beastman but no one actually ever confirmed that. They just said he was a beastman extremely casually and it seemed out of place for TTGL. There's also the fact that Coco's old and took care of Nia probably before Simon was even born, but this is Gurren Lagaan!!! Anything can happen! So, why not time travel? Anyways, now on to reasons. First of all, Coco only appears at extremely convenient times. He makes sure to care for Nia and has a special bond with her. He also made sure to keep the Dai-Gurren flag in perfect condition and obviously cared for the team. But why would he care for the team if he's just Nia's caretaker? He only appeared in episode 6 or so, and he just didn't have many interactions with team Dai-Gurren. The reason could be that he helped create team Dai-Gurren along with Kamina. Also his motive for going back in time could be to get to know Nia, keep her safe, and to keep Dai-Gurren on track. Now, for the most important piece of evidence- HIS GOGGLES!!!!! Those are definitely Simons! Anyways that's my theory. I'd like a discussion if possible."
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,ballzack73,2,Mon Oct 20 06:47:07 2014 UTC,"Old Coco does should up at just the right time to save the day, but I think we already know what an old Simon looks like. Coco has always been a unanswered mystery really. Like why was he at the bathhouse? If he was her caretaker why was he not with her? Besides, if Simon does live forever we can infer that he would not look older than what he currently looks like at the end as evidenced by Genome"
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,ballzack73,1 point,Tue Oct 21 00:55:01 2014 UTC,"But we know Simon grows older, as evidenced by the end of TTGL"
gurrenlagann,2jhjke,Rikuskill,1 point,Tue Oct 21 01:01:45 2014 UTC,Yea but at the end we see that he has a spiral eye. And I think that implies immortality.
gurrenlagann,2jg66n,BoldlyGettingThere,11,Thu Oct 16 20:01:11 2014 UTC,"In slightly bigger cameos the cast of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell, and Akira's Kaneda can also be seen throughout the comic. Clearly Gerard Way (Yes, that Gerard Way) is a huge anime fan and has placed these great cameos throughout, all whilst re-writing the Spider-man tale to fit an anime aesthetic and vibe. Can't recommend highly enough."
gurrenlagann,2jg66n,SalsaRice,3,Thu Oct 16 20:04:21 2014 UTC,"How is that anime/mecha marvel universe? I'm always done for a new comic series, but haven't heard much about it."

(I have never watched an anime that fast. Ever.) Even after knowing what happened, the show still made me emotional because it's just so freaking powerful.  It's good that you're not sad that it's over. But if you want your fill, you could always read the manga."

gurrenlagann,2j2ob7,Steve_Lambert,6,Mon Oct 13 00:52:28 2014 UTC,"Depends on which Lancelot and who is piloting Gurren Lagann and where in each series are we talking, because Gurren learns to fly and gets bigger, and Lancelot gets upgraded. My opinion would still be Gurren Lagann, because it is my third favorite all time mech and has spiral energy backing it. Also we finally hit 4000 strong."
gurrenlagann,2j2ob7,OpticalJesu5,1 point,Mon Oct 13 01:51:23 2014 UTC,"Whoo!! 4k strong!!! You do have a point, but, I'd, regrettably, have to disagree. I'd say Lancelot, piloted by Suzaku, would win. Simon's & Viral's Giga Drill Break may be strong as anything, but the people who've seen Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, myself included know how strong the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb is. It killed over 35 million people."
gurrenlagann,2j2ob7,GodofPH,9,Mon Oct 13 02:18:07 2014 UTC,"Simon and Viral piloting Gurren Lagann would decimate the Lancelot. At that point in his life, Simon was capable of producing the energy to operate the moon-sized Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann. What is a bomb that kills 35 million people to power that can move a moon?  That being said, Suzaku could probably take out GL if piloted by Young Simon/Kamina or Young Simon/Rossiu, as their mecha skills had yet to be honed and Simon had yet to perfect his spiral power capabilities."
gurrenlagann,2j2ob7,OpticalJesu5,3,Mon Oct 13 02:24:26 2014 UTC,You win... this time.
gurrenlagann,2j2ob7,JealotGaming,3,Mon Oct 13 02:29:18 2014 UTC,I would argue EP8 Kamina would still give Suzaku a run for his money. He was able to come back from being dead to avenge his own death and create Gurren Lagann's finishing move.
gurrenlagann,2j2ob7,OpticalJesu5,2,Mon Oct 13 02:38:05 2014 UTC,So did Suzaku at the ending of Code Geass. The Lancelot exploded after Kallen and Suzaku's fight and yet Kururgi lived.

gurrenlagann,2iw66g,Trachyon,5,Fri Oct 10 21:28:26 2014 UTC,There are two shots I found that I think give it a pretty good size perspective. Here they are together in one image.  http://imgur.com/qDDaF1t
gurrenlagann,2iw66g,GenesisHell,3,Fri Oct 10 21:42:05 2014 UTC,"Ah, that helps quite a bit actually. Thanks.  So Gurren Lagann is, what, around 15m tall? I'll use that height for the approximation. Gl seems slightly smaller than A-GL's face, so I would put the face at 20m tall from chin to head tip, but GL is in the foreground, significantly closer to the viewer than A-GL. We can see the grey metal GL is standing on in the bottom shot, and in this image you can see A-GL's face as the small patch of reddish brown amidst the black pixels. Given the distance of the grey metal to the face, I'm tempted to say that A-GL's face really is a considerable jog away from GL.  So it's face could even be in the range of 50m or so, unless I'm just wildly getting these perspectives mixed up with the pixels."

Sure you will know that someone will eventually die but denying yourself the opportunity to watch this is a mistake. I first saw this  4 years ago and it is one of the best I've seen. 9.8/10 I actually just finished rewatching it last week and it still has the 2nd best spot for favourite anime. Also, there is absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing at all, nothing, NOTHING, that can top the final fight in terms of pure epicness, scale and the will of the human spirit. It's been 4 years and nothing has been able to beat it. There is a reason why it is so highly recommended. It is within the top 20 anime of the world on MAL I believe.  So please, watch this show, you will not regret it"
gurrenlagann,2iirx5,ETERNALSPECTRUM,2,Tue Oct 7 03:32:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I'm pretty convinced to keep watching it now. Can I ask what your #1 anime is?"
gurrenlagann,2iirx5,GenesisHell,2,Tue Oct 7 03:39:17 2014 UTC,"My #1 is Code Geass which is within the top 10 on MAL I believe. It's my favourite because it tells a story that relates to me so well. The ideals of the characters, their hopes and dreams, and the wish to change the world for the better. It also has a genius strategist Main Character, side characters that provide comic relief but also have a compelling back story, intense mech battles, plot twists and mind boggling scenes. It also questions what it means to be human, what life is really all about and everlasting battle of good vs evil."
gurrenlagann,2iirx5,FullAstro,1 point,Tue Oct 7 04:14:04 2014 UTC,Cool! I'll definitely be getting back into TTGL if its almost as good as Code Geass. One of my favorites as well.

gurrenlagann,2iirx5,Dogeislord3637,8,Tue Oct 7 03:35:25 2014 UTC,"Didn't ruin it at all. The story will really show you how everything happened for a reason. I'm being careful because I don't want to spoil anything else, but it really does jump start the series to be a spinning vortex of complete and total awesomeness."

gurrenlagann,2iirx5,SalsaRice,2,Tue Oct 7 03:44:33 2014 UTC,"It might seem like a huge spoiler, but that event is just the beginning. The series takes off like a freight train because of it. The real spoilers would be to learn how that death affects everything else."

gurrenlagann,2i9kpo,animefan393,3,Wed Oct 8 14:12:25 2014 UTC,"There is an answer and ill put it in spoilers so if u must know then mouse over it, but you will find out eventually when u finish the first half but you have to put together the dots.. Lord Genome pilots his own version of Lagann and to pilot it, you need a drill and fighting spirit. Of which Genome has both. Genome can materialize drills in his hand as demonstrated for a few seconds when Viral asks why are humans so inferior. And Genome just has tons of fighting spirit because of later plot elements. Also it makes sense why Genome would lock Nia in a drill locked box because he just assumed noone else has a drill/can produce drills and then Simon came along."
gurrenlagann,2i9kpo,Seathninja,1 point,Mon Oct 6 05:02:18 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that provides a good explanation to my question. In addition to this, do we ever find out the origins of Simon's gunman and the core drill that he digs up?"
gurrenlagann,2i9kpo,Seathninja,2,Tue Oct 7 21:46:24 2014 UTC,"EVEN MORE spoilers, I would SERIOUSLY recommend finishing the anime since it draws on plot elements that requires you to be episode 23+ at least.  So, Ill trust you to finish the anime before you take a look at spoilers. Seriously, Finish the anime and better yet finish the movies as well before you even take a look at this. Seriously. It has been strongly hypothesised that Lagann and Simon's drill came from Kamina's dad when he crash landed in what is now know as Jiha village. Yep you read that right. This link will tell you excatly why this is true, it is a bit long though and of course major spoilers. http://lincolnbot2000.tumblr.com/post/38778031059/the-boota-theory-hidden-plot-in-gurren-lagann."

gurrenlagann,2i9kpo,GenesisHell,1 point,Thu Oct 9 03:27:06 2014 UTC,"Well, I didn't say the word ""season"" at all. So I'm just guessing that you are asking if there is more. There is the 2 movies that expand on the episodes. For the most part they are recaps but the ending for both movies are new and improved stuff. Dear god they really went over board with the 2nd movie final fight.They get an extra transformation thats 50b lightyears long  Other than that, there's only the TTGL parallel works which is basically mini stories/extra story bits with TTGL's various soundtracks played to it. That was a fun watch.   And if you are STILL inching for TTGL, then take a look at the tvtropes page. I've easily spent a couple hours browsing that site and learning some of the many hidden things that Gainax put in the show.  There is also an episode 5.5 that originally came out with some ds game that explained how kittan got his own gunman. You may or may not be able to find it on YouTube  That's all the extra TTGL stuff I can think of."

gurrenlagann,2hr96k,2Lazy4RealName,4,Mon Sep 29 13:05:25 2014 UTC,"God dammit, that whole title is just a train wreck.   I'm on my phone, and it pretty much just does whatever it feels like."
gurrenlagann,2hr96k,FireTheSpy,6,Mon Sep 29 14:35:39 2014 UTC,"Haha, funny to see there are other fans in the /r/wiiu subreddit... awesome!"
gurrenlagann,2hr96k,The_Pankiest,3,Mon Sep 29 04:31:23 2014 UTC,"As of a week ago, I'm in both places. Took me that long to buy a Wii U. Of course, now that I have it, I've spent more time re-watching Gurren Lagann in bed via Netflix than I have playing NSMBU."
gurrenlagann,2hr96k,FireTheSpy,2,Mon Sep 29 14:20:18 2014 UTC,"Nice! Just make sure to get all those awesome new games that are coming out for the wiiu.. (Mario Kart 8, Hyrule Warriors, and the new Smash Bros coming out soon.. and so much more) MUAHAHAH! SO MANY GOOD GAMES??!!! WHY DO PEOPLE HATE IT!"
gurrenlagann,2hr96k,Rayneworks,2,Tue Sep 30 03:09:21 2014 UTC,"People don't hate it. People are indifferent to its existence because all 'real' games come out for the other consoles, and also because of its inferior hardware. If it had the same hardware as PS4 and Xbone (Which isn't hard), carried Shadow of Mordor, Destiny, Evolve, ect. as well as the Nintendo exclusives, and came with a Pro Controller, it would by-far be the most bought and most used console. EVER. But Nintendo seems to be ridiculously fucktarded, and refuses to assimilate to modern times.  It's like people who own a Lamborghini don't hate a Prius. They just don't bother themselves with its existence.   I own a Wii U and a PS4. My Wii U is sitting gathering dust because a good game for it hasn't released since Pikmin 3. Meanwhile I have 40 hours in Shadow of Mordor on my PS4. If the same game, with the same visuals, was available on Wii U, I would be playing it on there instead and Nintendo would have my money. When Smash Bros releases, or when they put out a new Zelda game, or (GASP) a console Pokemon, thousands of people will buy Wii U's, then return them in two months because guess what: NOTHING GOOD IS GONNA RELEASE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF!  I really just don't get it."

It even has your answer. But if you don't want to read it, it says that when Lord Genome went corrupt, Kamina's dad ejected from the ship in Lagann. And then he crashed landed in Jiha village."
gurrenlagann,2hoyln,Seathninja,5,Sat Oct 4 06:34:13 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's ever said that Lordgenome put Lagann there. Fan theory would be that Kamina's dad was a Spiral Warrior like Genome and that's how Lagann got there, but that's fan theory and speculation"

gurrenlagann,2hj048,Hoogyme,19,Fri Sep 26 14:12:22 2014 UTC,Heaven-Piercing Crimson Face  Doesn't have the same ring to it.
gurrenlagann,2hj048,Lord_of_Bored212,11,Fri Sep 26 17:26:05 2014 UTC,It does accurately describe it though

Do you have any idea if there's a legitimate source out there?"
gurrenlagann,2hj048,helltrooper,1 point,Fri Sep 26 22:46:14 2014 UTC,"I can only assume it's all up to spelling. For instance ""guren"" means crimson too (assuming gurren is a word) so they may have just used an alternate spelling or something."
gurrenlagann,2hj048,vinnycthatwhoibe,9,Sat Oct 11 17:09:09 2014 UTC,"I recall seeing it mention something about Gurren meaning ""red / crimson"" or something in the fan subs i watched."

gurrenlagann,2hj048,FuzzBuket,2,Fri Sep 26 14:44:15 2014 UTC,"Lagann roughly means ""All-encompassing face"", and Gurren translates to ""Crimson blossom"". Tengen Toppa essentially means ""Pierce the heavens"". So, Heaven-piercing crimson face."

gurrenlagann,2h668q,MaverickGH,1 point,Tue Sep 23 05:31:01 2014 UTC,"Well, I think if it says best quotes, it means that the blogger had seen the whole of gurren lagann already, and is just picking his favorite lines from kamina.

It's just part of Lord Genome's recognition universe which the Anti-spirals trapped them all in. You can see it at the end of that scene when the Anti-spiral walks past him, he's been shimmering and blank the whole time.  I love the headcannon, but that one hole just killed it for me. Hopefully it doesn't kill it for you as well. You could just dodge my argument and say that he was only trapped after and get away with it ;)"
gurrenlagann,2h165u,le_Vaunty,1 point,Mon Sep 22 03:59:21 2014 UTC,"If you remember they entered a few pocket universes. They never said everyone of them had the ability to transform thought into matter, they only said this for the pocket universe which the final battle took place in. You can easily sidestep that hole by saying the pocket universe Boota transformed in was him actually using spiral energy to transform. Lordgenome even said Boota was turning excess spiral energy into evolution energy."

gurrenlagann,2h1arl,mastercoates,3,Sun Sep 21 14:29:56 2014 UTC,Every scene where Boota is in Yoko's cleavage
gurrenlagann,2h1arl,TheCyborgFalcon,2,Tue Sep 23 01:14:28 2014 UTC,every scene that has kamina with girls except the yoko kiss one.

gurrenlagann,2gz14n,Shawken,1 point,Sat Sep 20 21:37:59 2014 UTC,This looks like the Kamina one.

gurrenlagann,2gxwj8,metroids224,3,Sat Sep 20 21:19:52 2014 UTC,Yeah that isn't very clear.  Kill La Kill isn't anywhere as good as TTGL. Some of the action is good but that's about it.

gurrenlagann,2gx40l,irishrugbyspartan,2,Sat Sep 20 02:41:51 2014 UTC,Here's an upvote for a fellow member of the Gecko State
gurrenlagann,2gx40l,cwhazzoo,1 point,Sat Sep 20 16:22:25 2014 UTC,Gurren Lagann is one of the greatest Anime ever made. Gald to hear you liked it :) I just finished it today for the 3rd time.
gurrenlagann,2gx40l,AirNova,3,Sat Sep 20 05:41:47 2014 UTC,"me too, I just had to watch it with my new roomate"
gurrenlagann,2guhgk,KronusX7,23,Fri Sep 19 09:17:09 2014 UTC,I'd like to remind you that you're looking for height continuity in Gurren Lagann
gurrenlagann,2guhgk,Toggle2,7,Fri Sep 19 21:15:06 2014 UTC,"When it's fighting the Granzeboma, the height of TTGL would be much closer to 10 million lightyears, or it would be almost impossible to see many of the galaxies surrounding it. It would be more likely that it can change it's height at will, which it seems to do both during the fight and when it transforms into the STTGL."
gurrenlagann,2guhgk,FrankCrumpets,7,Fri Sep 19 15:20:58 2014 UTC,"Size is basically irrelevant in that pocket dimension. I mean, a normal sized Lazengann somehow grew to Tengen Toppa Gunman size. The Anti-Spiral homeworld was still a sizeable target on Granzamboa."

gurrenlagann,2guhgk,Mazrodak,3,Sat Sep 20 01:48:15 2014 UTC,I'd imagine the transformation into being part of STTGL just made it grow.

gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,BrokeMike,11,Thu Sep 18 19:27:46 2014 UTC,if you liked kill la kill you should've liked gurren lagann aswell but whatever the climax of gurren lagann is much more climatic then klk
gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,saculpopo101,5,Thu Sep 18 22:02:58 2014 UTC,I just finished the series last night. I had the exact same thoughts. It seemed too political and I hated some characters to the point of rage. Fucking finish it. I cried/laughed/kicked over a trash can in excitement. I'm still blown away.
gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,ToastyRut,1 point,Thu Sep 18 20:34:58 2014 UTC,woah this makes me want to finish it now
gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,cwhazzoo,3,Thu Sep 18 20:52:32 2014 UTC,What he says is true. You cant even fathom what is going to happen in the 3rd arc. It is a glorious ride full of emotions.

gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,Hellsing21,4,Tue Oct 7 21:34:02 2014 UTC,"I had the exact same thing, had watched KLK before and wanted to try this. Basically GL is split into two main acts and after the recap episode the second act begins. Won't spoil anything but it's really worth sticking with it because IMO it's gets a bit darker and more mature."
gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,DelysidBarrett,5,Thu Sep 18 23:52:52 2014 UTC,"I love Kill la Kill, but I feel that Gurren Lagann is the overall better anime. It's sad that you're not enjoying it, but if you aren't enjoying it then you probably won't like the second half, as I feel that requires you to have been invested in the characters.  There's some amazing fights to be had, though!"
gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,GenesisHell,6,Fri Sep 19 14:47:58 2014 UTC,"YES, FINISH THIS GODDAMN SHOW!  Or!  You could watch the two movies that are essentially what Gainax/Trigger wanted to do with the show but couldn't.  I'll provide a link for you if you'd like."

gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,bignasty1717,2,Thu Oct 2 18:05:45 2014 UTC,The politics part only lasts about 4 episodes and then it goes back to being over the top insane crazy action like before only increase that by one million times over. Second half is the best.
gurrenlagann,2gsfvg,DrCybrus,2,Sat Sep 20 16:02:44 2014 UTC,"This show is infinitely better than Kill la Kill. If you liked Kill la Kill even remotely, you really should finish this show. KLK is such a weak show in comparison."
