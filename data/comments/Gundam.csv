A true fan is someone who can see the value in different series. To hate a part of Gundam is to hate all of it.  UC laid down the brickwork. Gave us Gundam in the first place. It also had a great story.   But the animation was pretty meh for the early series, there were stereotypes, and it could be a tad too dark because Tomino.  Wing gave us some really great battles and great characters to follow. Plus, the animation was great.  But, some of the characters could be really bad and the message was confused with itself.   See? They're great, but it has faults to accept. If you can accept these faults and criticisms, you are a true fan."

Gundam,3dx8z3,Heoder12,6,Mon Jul 20 08:00:08 2015 UTC,"For Gundam, there is one ""main"" timeline called the Universal Century that consisst of a number of connected TV series, movies and OVAs, and then there are also many other Alternate Universes that other series are based on and they are totally unconnected from UC or each other, Gundam 00 is one of them.  Universal Centruy is one of the more realistic timeline, with the protagonist usually starting as a normal civilian being dragged into war, and slowly  learn the cruelty of war through witnessing tragedies in his surroundings or suffering the loss of a loved one, eventually come to the realization that war must be stopped or else it will bring sadness no matter your action in it. This would become the running theme through to the later series.  Other AU Gundam series would then explore the varies causes of war and solutions to their problem, such as the environment, resource allocation, equality and human nature, etc. Recently, the trend of Gundam series tend towards ""peace achieved through understanding"", with Gundam 00 and Gundam AGE being the prime example.  You can start on any AU series, which would be G, Wing, X, Seed, 00 or AGE depending on your preference. Or you can tackle the UC timeline and start with the original MSG movies trilogy and move onto Zeta Gundam, ZZ Gundam, and Char's Counter Attack Movie in order, and finish the rest of the timeline in production order."
Gundam,3dx8z3,BoyGodz,3,Mon Jul 20 09:24:26 2015 UTC,"For the Universal Century timeline the main themes tend to revolve around the devastation of war and the need for humans to overcome it, generally represented symbolically through the emergence of newtypes and their ability to understand one another psychically. What is emphasized and how much varies. The original Mobile Suit Gundam sort of evenly balanced the two, while Zeta, ZZ, CCA, and Unicorn Gundam tend to up the newtype shenanigans a lot. On the other hand, OVA works like 0080, 0083, and 08th Mobile Suit Team, which don't involve newtypes, tend to focus more on more down-to-earth messages about war and loss, although 08th Mobile Suit Team also sort of has a ""love conquers all boundaries"" sort of thing going on. And of course, each individual entry has its own particular themes; Unicorn, for instance, utilizes family as a theme, particularly the obligation of children towards their parents.  In terms of narrative structure all the main Gundam TV series tend to be similar to the point of repetition. 00 is very similar to Wing, which is similar to Zeta, which is similar to the original. SEED was intentionally designed to basically be a ""modern"" reboot of the original story. There's common archetypes and plot structures (and devices) common to pretty much every Gundam series. There's a few series which break the mold, but they're mostly OVAs. Movies don't have the same issue with repetition."
Gundam,3dx8z3,gyagoda,3,Mon Jul 20 09:46:47 2015 UTC,"I'll give my $.02 on the UC series which is going to have the most reoccurring, but diverse, set of themes. I also threw in G Gundam, just for the heck of it.   However, one archetype you will see quite often is the ""Char Clone"" And not just in Gundam. It created this Archetype in many different anime as well. Generally a character that serves as a rival/anti-Hero and sometimes an antagonist. Often has blonde hair, although that's not a hard and fast rule, and a mask of some kind.  Mobile Suit Gundam: The theme of this is responsible for creating the standard mecha theme/trope of Boy finds Robot; forced to fly robot. Ultimately, it's about war and responsibility being thrust upon a civilian who never asked for it, but slowly takes on the life of a soldier. (This appears in some shape or form in just about every Gundam series) This manifests in other characters as well as they take Newtypes and turn them into weapons of war, a common reoccurring theme in the UC along with Newtype Denial. Also, a minor theme between the rivalry of Char and Amuro as being opposing forces which continues throughout the UC.  IGLOO: Really, it's an examination into the Zeon side of the war at the Grunt level, follows around an 'experimental division' that is responsible for testing new and/or dangerous weapons. Really shows the fanaticism that Zeon instilled in it's people, and the sense of duty they felt for their Nation.  War in Pocket: Deals with the effect of an atrocious war on the average space colony that is unaffiliated with either side. This also extends to exploring the human tendencies on either side of the war, puts the fact that the people on either side are just that, people.  08th MS Team: Deals with Gundam in a more realistic setting on Earth. Goes into more depth about the individual soldiers on either side. Also runs parallel to Romeo Juliet in a lot of ways, which isn't bad, that story is a literary masterpiece.    Stardust Memories: Deals with the lingering sentiments of the Zeon forces after their defeat. It focuses in on a sort of, ""You made us this way."" attitude. A Bitter Rivalry complex is in focus for most of the duration.  Zeta Gundam: Similar theme to MSG. Focuses more heavily on corruption and the atrocities on either side of the war that took place, the extreme exploitation of newtypes as elite soldiers, and again ultimate responsibility thrust upon the pilot of a Gundam. Also visits the theme of, do Humans still belong on Earth?  ZZ Gundam: Again, ultimate responsibility thrust upon a kid. It also deals with corruption on the other side of the fence. More exploitation of newtypes.  Char's Counterattack: Takes the ""Do Humans belong on Earth?"" theme and turns it on it's head, and a, somewhat, final conclusion of the Char vs. Amuro Rivalry. More Newtype denial.  Unicorn: This one deals VERY heavily with Newtype Denial and what sort of status they should play in the world. Again ultimate responsibility and the fate of newtypes is rested on the shoulders of a young man. Also deals with Zeon's ghosts, almost literally, their inability to maintain their relevance in a rapidly changing world.  A passing off to a new generation, and the final entry in the Amuro vs Char rivalry.  The Forces of change and possibility are central to the plot of this one. (Honestly, people give it crap, but from a literary point of view, it's very well written.)  Note: Newtype Denying is a lot like modern day Global Warning deniers. We have all seen the effects, we all know it's there, but no one really does anything about it and so they ignore and deny.  G Gundam: This one is interesting, and not a typical Gundam series. The idea is farrrr in the future everyone left Earth but use it as a fighting ground every so often to choose a new ""ruler"" of space. The Main Character is driven by revenge and a sense of duty, eventually he must overcome himself and let go of his own feelings to face new dangers. It also lightly touches on the ""Do Humans belong on Earth?"" theme again. Aside from that, it's a pretty generic Kung Fu movie meets DBZ meets Gundam. 10/10 would Gundam Fight again."
Gundam,3dx8z3,ConchobarMacNess,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:04 2015 UTC,Asura and Char are in more than one series? I though it was just
Gundam,3dx8z3,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. And they both represent something different- Char is the force of change, Amuro is the force of peace.   It should also be noted that in the UC the Gundam is a symbol of defense. The name gundam coming from an amalgation of the words Gun, for weapon. Freedom, using 'dom' as the sense of liberty, and finally dam- as the Gundam often tends to hold back the forces of a seemingly insurmountable foe. However that is in the UC.  What Gundam means in other series is different. In G Gundam they are simply Mobile Suits built for the purpose of participating in the Gundam Fight.   In 00 it almost means the opposite of the UC Gundam. Gundam are the force of change and a symbol of aggression, signifying that they are the vessel and target of Humanity's rage.   And so on."
Gundam,3dx8z3,payrpaks,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"Well, they have varying stories but it ends up on one thing only - unification (except the UC storyline, war never changes).  Also, every single Gundam series has a Char Clone. No excuses. All of them are as cunning and idealistic as the original Char (except Luin Lee of G-Reco, or maybe it's just that I don't see his Char-ness).  If you have time, you can watch the entirety of the Universal Century first, then move on to the AUs."
Gundam,3dx8z3,stowrag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:10:52 2015 UTC,"From my experience I feel like there's a couple main themes that stretch across most of the franchise:  The whole thing is hugely antiwar for instance, which I think is something Japan feels pretty strongly about after WWII. I'm not pretending to speak for them or anything but there's been huge protests sparked when leaders wanted to subvert that particular rule.   There's also a general youth rebellion theme that surfaces every time a teenager comes to openly question an adult's bullshit logic/motives for fighting a war.   There's the general theme of the possibility of human advancement, represented not just by Newtypes (and the like) but also often by humanity's general migration into space.   There's also environmental themes every time someone talks about polluting the earth.  Love across battle lines.   And of course corruption in government."
Gundam,3dx8z3,justeducation,-9,Mon Jul 20 18:40:53 2015 UTC,Different.   Mobile Suit Gundam (anime) : Boy and his mech story. The novels tell a very different story.   Z Gundam: Never watched before.   ZZ Gundam: Found it boring. Silliest opening theme song I have ever heard.   Char's Counterattack: Lots of people live this. Maybe because I didn't watch Z Gundam so I don't really get what's happening here.   War in Pocket: Anime loving little boy realises the true meaning of war. I cried at the end.   Stardust Memories: Test pilots get embroiled in war as they chase after a stolen mech that is armed with a nuclear weapon.   G Gundam: What if kung fu masters piloted kung fu mechs?  And they fought while looming in the background is something like the Invaders from the Getter Universe? The theme here is fun.   x Gundam: A mech that is powered by thr moon.  What is the connection between them?   Gundam Unicorn: Haven't watched.   A live action Gundam show (forgot the name): utter rubbish.   Gundam Wing: Too many pretty boys piloting their pretty mechs.   Gundam Seed: Starts out ok but goes nuts with religious fanatics in power at the end.  Didn't make much sense. Supposed to be a retelling of Z Gundam story in alternate universe?   Gundam Seed Destiny: continues rivalry between two heroes from Gundam Seed.   08 MS Team: Watch the story of Mobile Suit Gundam from the perspective of the grunts on the enemy's side.
Gundam,3dx8z3,ConchobarMacNess,5,Mon Jul 20 09:22:00 2015 UTC,"The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; nostalgia; and the dangers of unchecked ambition. A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the theme loneliness in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis—the text's or author's implied worldview.   You gave an abridged summary of each series rather than a theme."

Silverstein is a mouthwatering VA as he graces the screen time with his cocky yet charming ego. Also his voice was similar to Kopsa and I'm okay with that. Edwards is underrated and he did well to voiced as a matured Char and is one of the few good VA in the dubbing. The voicing is very matured, just like Quattro Sorry Spike, but your portrayal of Char Shaa was underwhelming. And I don't blame you; you were let down by the script. Gundammit"

However, I really like Edwards as Char in Zeta. Steve is whatever, and as for Keith, I watched both The Origin and Unicorn subbed so I can't comment."
Gundam,3dvsu7,DefrostedTuna,3,Mon Jul 20 00:05:10 2015 UTC,"I recommend watching Unicorn dubbed at some point. It's probably the best dub a Gundam series has gotten, thus far.  EDIT: In fact, there's a few voices I prefer in the dub over the Japanese. Riddhe, for instance becomes much more redeeming (IMO) because of Lowenthal's delivery of his character."
Gundam,3dvsu7,OZKai,3,Mon Jul 20 15:26:34 2015 UTC,I love keith silverstein's voice for char and I preferred him over the others but kopsa is a ridiculously close second for me.
Gundam,3dvsu7,sinanju1994,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:52:01 2015 UTC,"Have to agree, here. Something about Silverstein's voice brings a chill with Char that helps instil his place as a feared ace pilot. Of course, Kopsa was not necessarily bad and worked well for the roll, but it had brief moments of being a bit too flat. Edwards was okay, but was put off from the fact that they didn't even try to get Kopsa back so soon after 0079's run, let alone all the games he was still portraying Char in..."
Gundam,3dvsu7,OZKai,3,Mon Jul 20 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"I like Edwards as Char in Zeta, but frankly I just can't get used to Char as anyone but Shuuichi Ikeda."

Gundam,3dwxl1,rock_callahan,3,Mon Jul 20 05:30:44 2015 UTC,"This a mini guide that I've posted before that may be able to help you. There are basically three routes that make it easy to follow based on the timeline each show is in: Early Universal Century, Late Universal Century, and Alternate Universe.  Early Universal Century: These shows are all connected and exist in the same universe. They're probably best watched in the following order.   Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ (Technically skippable, but necessary for full Unicorn experience) Char's Counterattack Mobile Suit Gundam 0080 (Can be watched alone, but best at any time after 0079) Mobile Suit Gundam 0083 (Can be watched any time after Zeta Gundam) The 08th MS Team (Can be watched alone, but best at any time after 0079) Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn IGLOO (Optional, can be watched after 0079) Origin (Can be watched after 0079)   Late Universal Century: These ones happen after the events of Unicorn and are generally separate from the main UC timeline. They can be watched independently of the rest of the series and each other, but are probably best watched after completing the Early Universal Century.   Gundam F91 Mobile Suit Victory Gundam Gundam G no Reconguista Turn A Gundam (Should probably be watched after seeing some Alternate Universe Shows as well)   Alternate Universe: Each of these shows are independent of each other and the rest of the series. They can be watched at any time.   G Gundam Gundam Wing After War Gundam X Gundam SEED and SEED Destiny Gundam 00 Gundam AGE Gundam Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try (Potentially best saved for after you've seen a lot of other Gundam shows or are familiar with Gunpla)   For starter series, I would recommend these:   0079 - Old, but still good and provides the conceptual foundation for Gundam shows. If you like it, you'll probably like the rest of the shows. Watching this lets you begin to watch the rest of the UC, which is the meat of Gundam.  Gundam 00 - Modern, fun, with great characters, good animation, and a political plot. SEED - A little dated visually, but provides a good entry point to get acquainted with Gundam shows. This was many people's first modern Gundam.  The 08th MS Team - Beautiful, fun action show with a setting unique for Gundam series. It gives you a decent idea of the Universal Century and requires no prior knowledge. Gundam Wing - The setup is a little different from the rest of the Gundam shows, and it shows its 90s origins on its sleeve, but it's fun and it delves into the core anti-war themes of the broader Gundam Series.    My personal favorites:   Gundam 0080 - My overall favorite Gundam show, but the one that is probably most unlike the rest of the series. Powerful, thematic story with an emotional punch.  Gundam Unicorn - The pinnacle of the Universal Century story and the culmination of decades of TV history. It's worth watching everything else in the UC in order to fully experience what Unicorn offers.  Gundam 00 - My favorite alternate universe Gundam.    Do Not Start With:   Zeta Gundam Gundam 0083 ZZ Gundam Char's Counterrattack Unicorn Origin IGLOO F91 Victory Turn A G Gundam"
Gundam,3dwxl1,OutZoned,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"You can start at a number of points.   Mobile Suit Gundam or any of the spin-off series. Wing, X, G, or 00 are all good starting points as they're AU series and not connected to the majority of Gundam series.  Personally I'd suggest starting at 00 as it's newer and it's not a bad series (Unlike SEED which is a newer series and garbage)."
Gundam,3dwxl1,CrashmanX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:38:30 2015 UTC,"Release order  My personal suggestion is to start with the classic Mobile Suit Gundam. I thought it was a fantastic series, barring animation issues. Plus, it's a gateway into UC, which is by far the best and most developed timeline. I haven't seen the compilation movie trilogy, but apparently they're good too."
Gundam,3dwxl1,Who_is_Zander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:40:22 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're looking for, exactly.  There's a ton of different Gundam series, and they each offer different things.  Looking for some light-hearted no-stress fun?  Try Gundam Build Fighters, one of the most recent series, taking place in the ""real world"" where mecha battles (actually ""gunpla"" battles using plastic mecha model kits) are a spectator sport instead of a life-or-death combat situation.  Looking for over-the-top incredibly powerful super robot titans battling against swarms of relatively weak mooks, backed by a complex, politically-driven storyline?  Try Gundam 00, where a group of four Gundams fight the entire world in an attempt to end war forever.  Looking for a more conventional war drama, where mobile suits are Gundams are powerful, but far from invincible, war machines -- with a healthy dose of melodrama?  Try Gundam Seed, which follows the physical and emotional trials of a teenage civilian who finds himself inadvertently drawn into a war against his will.  Looking for over-the-top martial arts action sequences in giant robots, with a surprisingly good character-driven drama as a foundation?  Try G Gundam, where each nation of the world sends a single warrior to compete in a mecha martial arts tournament every four years to see who rules the world until the next tournament.  Looking to start at the beginning and see how the whole thing got started?  Try Mobile Suit Gundam, the one that started it all -- but be aware that it's 35 years old at this point, and the animation quality wasn't great even for its day.  You might want to try the compilation movies (which cut out much of the repetitive and/or pointless crap, and many parts were reanimated in higher quality) first, instead of jumping straight into the TV series."

Gundam,3dtekx,ToastedCheesy,8,Sun Jul 19 07:25:13 2015 UTC,"SEED is good yes, but, its sequel is a disaster. A lot of the hate for SEED is actually SEED DESTINY hatred. A lot of people loved seed, back in the day and then destiny happened. Hell, T.V tropes says the GSD fandom is the best example of a hatedom."
Gundam,3dtekx,ShinnAssuka,4,Sun Jul 19 07:48:24 2015 UTC,"First half of Seed is good, however if you have already watched MSG, the plot will be extremely similar, but the newer graphic and music still make it worth your time.  The second half (namely after the Strike vs Aegis fight) is where things get messy. The plot stopped being a clone of MSG and take things into their own hand, however the new totally original plot isn't exactly great, and it get progressively worse towards the end of the series, but since it started on a high note, the overall series is still pretty okay. It's not as bad as some people would say, but it is also too mediocre to deserve the status held by its fans. I would give it a solid 5/10, possibly a 7/10 since it was the first series I finished on TV and nostalgia is strong.   On the other hand, Destiny is nowhere near as good as Seed. Although its plot drew a lot of ideas from Zeta Gundam, it was executed poorly, so not only the plot make no sense what so ever, it feels like they altering the plot just so they can fit in some iconic scene from Zeta. Fight scene are boring and filled with re-used animation to the point I would rather skip the scene altogether than watching those same movement over and over. Needless to say, I didn't finish it the first time when it was on TV, not that I actively decide not to watch it anymore, it just wasn't fun enough for me to remember to tune in. I would avoid watching Destiny unless you are curious."
Gundam,3dtekx,BoyGodz,13,Sun Jul 19 16:37:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know why there is a lot of hatred for them, but I actually liked both SEED and SEED Destiny. I thought it was thought provoking, and I genuinely liked them. SEED Destiny went a bit haywire towards the end, though, but nothing overly apalling for me. So yeah. *runs in corner in hopes to avoid downvote storm*  EDIT: clarified something"
Gundam,3dtekx,DrRavychenko02,3,Sun Jul 19 08:07:24 2015 UTC,Me too!
Gundam,3dtekx,86Damacy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:07:09 2015 UTC,"Not to take a jab at you but idk what you found thought provoking about the issues addressed in seed destiny. If I remember correctly, the only real issue that was even remotely thought provoking is the gene alteration thing. Which if you thought about it, was present ever since the start of seed (co-ordinators were stated 1st episode as people who had their genes modified and then never mentioned in detail again till destiny). Even then, this issue isn't like something I've never seen. Alot of movies have this concept of organic vs human interference.   Also, what about the issues that all the characters faced? Many of them had issues resolved and know what it is their doing and fighting for. This was established in seed and was like the whole character development and plot development of that show. All of a sudden, every character from seed gets a hard reset in their character development in destiny except for Jesus Yamato (lacus to an extent too), who also survives being in the middle of an explosion for the second time (do the writers really like doing edgy shit like this? at least make it believable and not overused geez...). Jesus Yamato in seed destiny is what happens to characters who get their answers in their prequel, experiences no changes in the time gap (unlike char from msg to zeta), and finally also experiences no changes in character during the duration of its sequel. It was basically jesus Yamato thought this guy is wrong, therefore he'll activate seed and kick his ass.   This really sucked and would be something a edgy 10 year old me would write as a story. That's my 2 cent and what i see as the collective reasoning people don't like Seed Destiny. Apart from See Destiny also seeming like a dating sim game with a sprinkle of gundam in the background."
Gundam,3dtekx,_Raidan_,3,Mon Jul 20 12:01:31 2015 UTC,"Ehh, the final act is where SEED falls apart in my opinion. To me, the show devolved into some kind of 70's super robot anime once Kira received his upgrade. The kinds of shows the original tried to set itself apart from.   This wouldn't be a problem if the show held any form of self-awareness. G Gundam knew it was wild and ran with it. But with SEED, it still wants to be taken seriously with it's messages.  ""War is bad, now watch as our heroes pilot awesome robots doing Braves poses while facing bad guys you won't lose sleep over seeing killed (unlike Zeon)."" - Gundam SEED  Still, the final act doesn't completely ruin the show. There's still some good character development in Flay, Natarle and Yzak, some  of the battles are pretty cool and the music is something no one argues on. The bad of the show doesn't outweigh the good, but the good doesn't outweigh the bad. It's just kinda okay overall. Nothing really special, doesn't live up to it's full potential, but still worth the watch.  Destiny, on the other hand, is a whole different mess. There's a chance you may end up hating your favorite SEED character because of it.   EDIT: And if anyone knows about any fanart of Kira and the Freedom done in a 70's anime style, please link me."
Gundam,3dtekx,Char_X_3,8,Sun Jul 19 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal with SEED in general.  The 1st Gundam SEED isn't terrible at all. It's ""Meh"", but as a whole, it's tolerable to say the least. But the sequel to SEED, Gundam SEED Destiny, is a totally different story. SEED Destiny is GOD-AWFUL and just a complete trainwreck. But as a whole, I feel like every Gundam Fan should watch SEED & Destiny at least once just so that they know what the Cosmic Era is and are familiar with the elements in it.  If you can do that, then it's up to you whether you wanna go back and revisit it afterwards.  But I cannot warn you enough about Destiny. Expect bad things from that one, I can tell you that much."
Gundam,3dtekx,WackyModder84,2,Sun Jul 19 07:52:38 2015 UTC,"if you've just seen the original MSG, i'd recommend holding off for a bit on SEED.  The First half of SEED hits a lot of the same plot points as MSG, so much so that prominent interview mecha review site, MAHQ.net, was able to draw almost 1 to one comparison.  To my mind SEED was a nice modern polish on the MSG story - ZEON --> ZAFT, Spacenoids -> (loosely) Coordinators Luna II - > Artemis, Ramba Ral -> The  Desert Tiger.  There's some great music in SEED, fairly good animation, But alot of clip shows and reused animation, as well as angst teenage ennui.   Watching it is recommended, but you dont need to be in a rush"
Gundam,3dtekx,draivaden,2,Sun Jul 19 10:32:37 2015 UTC,"Seed has cool mechs and an amazing soundtrack.  The plot of Destiny is rough, but the first one is pretty good."
Gundam,3dtekx,LightningEagle7,3,Sun Jul 19 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"Let me sum up all the replies you are going to get :)   I like SEED I like SEED, but I still think my fav series is better I hate SEED because my fav series is better."

Gundam,3dtekx,GoldWingFallingBird,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:08:27 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I don't really have one. I guess the most memoriable one for me is 0079 since that's the first one i watched. F91 was really what got me really hooked.  IMO, SEED (not Destiny) was rather enjoyable for me. At least the first half. I was so excited everyweek. The whole Arangel running away from Zaft was very 0079 like"
Gundam,3dtekx,pedrodg28,3,Mon Jul 20 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"Ok dude I'm gonna tell you this: don't listent to this guys, go watch them, and if you like, well go for you, if you didn't, good for you as well. Every fan site is always gonna be full of guys who think their opinion is the only one, and anything they don't like is garbage.  The reason why you see so many haters of seed and destiny  is because despite the critics gundam seed and destiny were actually very popular, and people like to hate any popular thing, naruto, bleach, even one piece, fairy tail, DBZ, yes even DBZ has haters. Every popular series has them.  My point is, there's nothing stopping you from watching the series, so you don't need an opinion to do so. Go, Watch it, and decide for your self if you like it or not."
Gundam,3dtekx,_Raidan_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"Very true but I'd argue the reasoning why Seed and Seed Destiny were popular were due to the fact that its been a couple of years since a gundam show. People had high expectations which were somewhat fulfilled in seed. This made it popular due to the ""better"" animation quality seed had in it's time. Most who liked it though seemed to be people who had never watched gundam and since it was an A.C. it was easy for newcomers to watch. This allowed them to enjoy with low expectations. Seed got quite a following until destiny came along and kicked it down. Yes you can say destiny is popular but this is mainly due to the fact that people watching are hyped from seed, the reviews on destiny is actually shocking. Though the MS design seems to be ranked highly."
Gundam,3dtekx,CrashmanX,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:35 2015 UTC,Who is raving about SEED?  Who is honestly saying it's good? Because they're probably insane.

Gundam,3dtekx,dgol1115,3,Sun Jul 19 07:51:44 2015 UTC,"SEED represents a generation and geographical gap in Gundam fans. It was insanely popular in Japan but it was the ""dropping point"" for a lot of the first wave of western Gundam fans that had Wing and the U.C. side stories to grow up on. Then there's the people who tolerated SEED and the generation of people who's first Gundam series was SEED.  I'm of the camp that it was an undercooked, simplified rehash of U.C. to sell gunpla to the waifu-statue crowd that wont watch anything from before Evangelion."
Gundam,3dtekx,Mayomori,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:16 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree on the 'western- fans' part. Oceania, and parts of Europe really loved seed. I know that, in aus it sold a shit-ton of DVD copies, that they brought the sequel over."

In all seriousness though, my opinion on SEED is that the first series is decent, and Destiny is horrible. Stargazer however, managed to tell a very compelling and believable story withing just 3 episodes. I don't want another sequel to SEED, but if it takes place during or after Stargazer, then I wouldn't mind.  I also here that the SEED Astray manga is pretty good, but I haven't read it yet. I like the design of the Astrays though."

Gundam,3dtekx,Bass294,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:48:14 2015 UTC,"I've said it once I'll say it again; Gundam Seed and Destiny are pretty bad, the only series worse is AGE. That being said I feel like once they get to Orb in the original Seed it gets to be okay, the animation isn't so bad and seeing two Gundams fighting against three hostile Gundams is pretty entertaining. The characters still suck but you can just enjoy the final major battle. Destiny had potential when it started, good animation, seemingly better characters, no Kira but then it took the most spectacular nose dive in history. It got bad. I don't even remember the plot and I've sadly watched the series half a dozen times from when I was an anime newbie and thought it was the shit and not shit."

Gundam,3dthb7,duelistgamer,6,Sun Jul 19 08:23:19 2015 UTC,"No.  Mobile Suit Gundam is a great series sci-fi/fantasy war story.  I draw the distinction because MSG does things so differently than the majority of anime that it barely even falls into the same category.  Folks who approach the series expecting ""good anime"" usually don't like it, or at least don't find what they're looking for.  Folks who approach the series looking for that rock-solid sci-fi/fantasy war story are usually very impressed."
Gundam,3dthb7,sdwoodchuck,4,Sun Jul 19 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"It's still a good show to watch, and it's pretty much the only way to get into Universal Century Gundam.  The animation quality can be really shitty, there's no sugar-coating that.  But the themes become pretty mature throughout the show, even by today's standards.  There's a noticeable upgrade in quality once you get to Zeta, and all the OVAs are extremely well done."
Gundam,3dthb7,m-p-v,5,Sun Jul 19 11:48:28 2015 UTC,"It's aged a bit visually, but that only comes into play occasionally. The story and characters are REALLY good, some of the best I've ever seen in anime.   Keep in mind I'm a younger person who only got into anime a few years ago so it isn't nostalgia talking."
Gundam,3dthb7,wavyhairedsamurai,3,Sun Jul 19 15:39:45 2015 UTC,"It's kinda like Star Trek TOS. It's good, lots of memorable bits, kinda cheesy in places, but later shows have done things better. It's, in all honestly, kinda constrained by the time period in which it was created both in terms of animation and storytelling. The story of the show still holds up nicely though and is definitely worth checking out in some form (anime, movies or The Origin)."
Gundam,3dthb7,Char_X_3,4,Sun Jul 19 14:04:45 2015 UTC,"Since I got summoned here, I won't ignore this thread. It's too hard to say anything unless you actually specify which Gundam series you're watching (lots start with ""Mobile Suit Gundam"")."
Gundam,3dthb7,duelistgamer,-4,Sun Jul 19 08:24:42 2015 UTC,The 1979/80 series. Just wonder if it's just a okay series that is liked for starting the series/trends.
Gundam,3dthb7,duelistgamer,3,Sun Jul 19 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"Objectively speaking, there are plenty of shows in the franchise that are way better. It's mostly enjoyed for it's serious tone and for starting the franchise. The animation quality is literally garbage even by 1979 standards. The real treat in the Universal Century is most of the shows and OVAs that come after 0079.  Whenever someone tries to get into Gundam, I always tell them to start with Gundam 00, which is an Alternate Universe."
Gundam,3dthb7,simsoy,2,Sun Jul 19 08:32:11 2015 UTC,You can read the Mobile Suit Gundam Origin manga which is the retell of the main story of the 1979 series.
Gundam,3dthb7,Kyo220,2,Sun Jul 19 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"I liked it, though I wasn't fond of some episodes set on Earth. To me, the show started to get really good when the White Base arrived at Jaburo."
Gundam,3dthb7,OutZoned,2,Sun Jul 19 13:43:21 2015 UTC,"I liked it a lot, but mostly for the old-school, classic sci-fi feel it has, which I love."
Gundam,3dthb7,gyagoda,2,Sun Jul 19 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"The original is still probably my favorite series. Both the TV series and the compilation movies have their respective ups and downs but together they make for a pretty great experience. It's worth watching all the way through if you don't really like it anyway, just to get the quadrillions of times it's referenced in other anime and to get into the later UC series."
Gundam,3dthb7,Toxitoxi,2,Sun Jul 19 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying it so far. The animation quality is bad, but the plot is fine and I like the characters of Bright, Amuro, and Char. There are also some decent fights despite the limited animation."
Gundam,3dthb7,RegisXNex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't know how you might exactly qualify what makes an anime good, but there are many ups and downs to any sort of media, MSG included. The progression of the show is fairly good, flowing from plot point to plot point without feeling to out of place at any moment. As many others have pointed out, the animation quality has aged quite a bit since its debut, and it's definitely going to affect certain audiences (usually younger audiences from what I have seen). My overall opinion is that: yeah, perhaps MSG is not the BEST of what it holds up, but we as audience place that expectation for it as it's the one that started the franchise."
Gundam,3dthb7,Lorederp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"The series is honestly super, super janky. It's like Star Trek. If you go and try to watch it for the first time NOW, it's going to seem super, super ridiculous. And not for no reason, it's aged very badly. The design for most of the vehicles that aren't the actual mobile suits are hilariously bad (Gunperry anyone?). It was made on the cheap, even for the time. There are a lot of decisions that are blatantly there to sell toys, like the Adzam and the G-fighter.  But despite all that the story is legitimately good. Just don't watch the show. Go watch the movies. You'll miss very, very little and actually enjoy the experience a little."

Gundam,3douy8,DefrostedTuna,16,Sat Jul 18 01:57:59 2015 UTC,"That's actually the original backstory Char/Casval.   They lived for a time in a house set up by Texas Colony's chief manager Roger Aznable, still under Teabolo Mass's care. Soon they met Roger's son Char Aznable and discovered that he and Casval were nearly identical, except Casval had blue eyes while Char had brown. Eventually Char is taken in by Gihren Zabi's propaganda, and against his father's wishes sets off for officer training school. Casval decides to accompany him under the guise of looking out for his friend. Kycilia Zabi finds out that Casval is headed back to Side 3, and without consulting Gihren, orders Casval's death. Both near identical boys are booked to leave on the same flight, but an antique pistol and fake explosives are found in Char's bag (almost certainly planted by Casval). Not wanting to miss the entrance exam, Char readily accepts Casval's suggestion to swap clothes in the restroom. Char boards the ship under the name Édouard Mass, while Casval, under the name of Char Aznable is detained overnight. Shortly after departure, the ship explodes and kills everyone aboard (no doubt the work of Kycilia's henchmen). Édouard Mass is listed among the dead and Casval takes on the name ""Char Aznable"", enters the Zeon Military Academy and begins wearing sunglasses to hide his eye color (as it wouldn't match any of the real Char's IDs)."
Gundam,3douy8,Gfaqshoohaman,4,Sat Jul 18 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"Édouard Mass is listed among the dead and Casval takes on the name ""Char Aznable"", enters the Zeon Military Academy and begins wearing sunglasses to hide his eye color (as it wouldn't match any of the real Char's IDs).   This is actually an extremely flimsy way to try and get past security checks. It doesn't make any sense that any system of ID involving eyes would allow such a fuck up even by today's security standards."
Gundam,3douy8,duelistgamer,8,Sat Jul 18 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"Let's get real here, it's not like the Universal Century is known for its rigorous security checks. Punk kids and enemy spies steal state-of-the-art high-tech military equipment all the time. He probably could've had different hair and skin color too and they wouldn't have noticed."
Gundam,3douy8,gyagoda,2,Sat Jul 18 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe you didn't notice but most of the kids stealing these high tech hardware are actually connected in some way, or the events that take place to let them steal it are still believable. But to get past a security check with sunglasses when even today border security officials say ""please take off your glasses"" is downright bizarre."
Gundam,3douy8,duelistgamer,4,Sat Jul 18 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"It is downright bizarre, but there's plenty of equally absurd scenarios that happen all the time. In CCA, for example, Hathaway sneaks onto the Ra Cailum with a petit MS, and when he's caught he's put into confinement... But then he's let out again so he can ""observe"" with the stipulation that the combat bridge is off-limits. However, no one is there to supervise him and the door right behind him that leads to the MS hangar is unlocked. What kind of absurd military regulations allow civilians (stowaway civilians at that) unsupervised access to a ship in the middle of combat? Char wearing sunglasses to hide his identity makes about as much sense as leaving Hathaway alone and unsupervised in a warship engaged in combat.   In the end, very little of the military discipline or security we see in Gundam is realistic in the slightest. Char's glasses are the least of those concerns."

Only if we put ""Origin""al in quotations; this backstory never appears before the Origin manga.  That's not a knock against it in any way (I think the Origin manga is better than the original series in a lot of ways), but it's somewhat inaccurate to describe the backstory as being the original backstory when it was a much later invention, and in a manga that is pretty well considered its own Universe apart from the original, with all of the things changed."

Gundam,3dtd6s,CrashmanX,2,Sun Jul 19 07:25:08 2015 UTC,"It's alright. The mecha design, animation, and music are all definitely some of the best in the franchise. The story isn't great but it's at least on par with 0083's and is fairly passable. It's weakest on the character front, where some of them barely qualify as characters (Banagher, Full Frontal) because they exist solely for the purpose of shoving the themes down your throat with little to nothing else going for them.  I agree the newtype hax gets a bit much at times, but after Zeta, ZZ, and CCA it's hard to argue that newtype hax isn't an established tradition."
Gundam,3dtd6s,JealotGaming,-2,Sun Jul 19 07:31:02 2015 UTC,"on par with 0083's and is fairly passable   That's not exactly a good thing. Nor is it excausable because something is worse. That'd be like saying ""Well Code Geass is good because SEED is awful"" well, no. Geass doesn't get a pass because SEED was worse.    It's weakest on the character front   And that's really not helping it. That said, Unicorn did have equally strong characters like Marida and Zimmerman who's stories were both incredibly well done and probably could've had a great series on their own. Full Frontal also could've benefited from being further fleshed out and having to deal with more of a struggle trying to figure out if he's a clone or if he's his own person.    after Zeta, ZZ, and CCA it's hard to argue that newtype hax isn't an established tradition.   And that doesn't excuse it. In Zeta I can give it a bit of a pass because it's short lived and is a huge drain on the users. ZZ I'm haven't seen all the way through so I can't comment on Newtype hax present there. In CCA Amuro and Char both pay a sacrifice for pulling off their Newtype stupidity. Meanwhile in Unicorn, Banana literally gets NO downside to pulling off Newtype stupidity. In the novels there's something about him and the unicorn more or less becoming one entity and him losing his physical body."

That'd be like saying ""Well Code Geass is good because SEED is awful"" well, no. Geass doesn't get a pass because SEED was worse.    Obviously. I don't actually hate 0083's plot and I think Unicorn's, while ultimately irrelevant and even counterproductive towards its own themes, is, as I said, passable. It's not great, but at least it's nominally interesting even if the payoff isn't that great.   And that's really not helping it.   I know. That's why I said it was weak here. I agree Marida and Zinnerman are interesting, but I think we can both agree that interesting characters in something that Unicorn only has in small handfuls.    Full Frontal also could've benefited from being further fleshed out and having to deal with more of a struggle trying to figure out if he's a clone or if he's his own person.    Full Frontal could've benefited from being literally anything other than a mouthpiece for the themes of the show. Same with Banagher, whose personality and development is virtually nil. Everything that comes out of their mouths is pretty much spoonfeeding the audience what the writers want you to take out of the show. A little bit of that every now and then isn't bad, but in Unicorn it's awful.    In Zeta I can give it a bit of a pass because it's short lived and is a huge drain on the users. ZZ I'm haven't seen all the way through so I can't comment on Newtype hax present there. In CCA Amuro and Char both pay a sacrifice for pulling off their Newtype stupidity.   Zeta's whole ending is pretty much newtype deus ex machina. Kamille channeling the spirits of dead women to make his beam saber longer (among other things) and Scirocco casting his sith magic to fry Kamille's mind aren't that much more bullshit than some of the stuff the Unicorn pulls off. In ZZ Judau projects huge images of demons that scare the shit out of Haman Karn and reassembles the ZZ Gundam after it's been separated with his newtype space magic. And of course, CCA's ending relies on newtype bullshit as well. I agree that the newtype shit is overused in Unicorn, but frankly I just regard it as the logical conclusion of a plot device that was overpowered and overused since the end of Zeta."
Gundam,3dtd6s,CrashmanX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:58:44 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Unicorn OVAs is that they changed the ending from the light novels to focus on recreating something more dramatic than the Axis shock. In the light novels, the energy it takes to create a psycho-field strong enough to block the colony laser actually kills Banagher, and his 'perfected' spirit ascends into the beyond."

Other than that, it was a mess, and for many more reasons than just the ending.  The characters were mediocre, the action was bland, and the dialogue and plot were atrocious.    I'm glad that Unicorn exists, because there's a lot of the aesthetic of the series that I like.  Lots of great mecha designs from it inspiring lots of great Gunpla.

Gundam,3dtd6s,NageQsad,0,Sun Jul 19 22:37:55 2015 UTC,"00S1 was pretty interesting when the Thrones showed up and in the finale but otherwise putting it amongst the top is overrating it by quite a bit. All the repetitive base attacks with no real plot advancement and the constant cutting to characters literally doing nothing like Liu-Mei and Saji+Louise took a real toll on the quality of the series. Since Celestial Being keeps itself hidden from the world it's extremely lacking in the drama of interaction between opposing characters that's usually a staple in Gundam series, with more or less only Saachez there to fulfill that element. The cast overall is a bit lacking in character and variety with 3/4 of the main protagonists basically just being a bunch of overly-serious, angsty psychos. If the meisters were beverages, Setsuna, Allelujah, and Tieria would all be different flavors of Coke, and Lockon would be like, orange juice or something. So thank God for Graham. Plus when judged alone it has the inherent flaw that its plot is left unresolved without S2 to conclude the story.  Otherwise I'd shift things around a bit but don't have any major objections."

And actually the characters in 00 are very interesting though, each one have their own problems but do the same thing to end their misery, end what they think is bad: War. Base attacks actually advance the plot real quick, you see if just 1 single attack they would just thought of it as an act of terrorism or provoking bu another nation or country, however they keep on attacking bases regardless of their origin, HRL or AEU or what the fuck ever  make people rethink their intentions. Basically most of things you stated here are just quite wrong. 00 is never overrated, even underrated. Destiny is overated by most people, 00, X, Turn A are underated."

It'd be like if all the White Base pilots were a bunch of smartasses like Kai.  On second thought that might not be so bad  And base attacks do not advance the plot, come on. 00S1 was a series of the various military forces trying whatever gimmick they could to defeat Celestial Being who would just bust out one ace-up-the-sleeve after another. It was basically the Frieza fight from Dragonball in Gundam form, the plot went practically nowhere until S2. S1 basically served to establish the characters and setting for the events of S2 to be able to happen, which is not necessarily bad when they're viewed as one entity, but if you chop them into two separate parts like what was done in the original post then it's a valid problem."

The short answer, then, would be ""anything that can move a tank"".  In terms of ground transport, there are a number of vehicles, but an example of a specifically design tank mover is the Heavy Equipment Transport System, or Het.   Most military air or water transport vehicles could carry an MBT/MS, but I believe is normally done on C-5 Galaxy's for long term and vehicles like CH-54 Tarhe for more short term. Intercontinental movement would probably be done with amphibious transport docks, such as the USS Arlington and with dock landing ships, such as the USS Ashland. Although as needed, an MS could probably be transported by any ship capable of carrying the weight.

Even then, there are much better alternatives to a humanoid based weapon.   Realistically, the ball would much more practical. It is small, can be armed with a canon and has room for simple maneuvering via impulse thruster like any man made shuttle in space currently. As for the warships, it makes sense from a deployment avenue. They are mobile bases. Something we can do in space, but can't on earth due to gravity and stuff. Makes for a much different kind of strategy than we have now. Ever shifting planes of power and bringing garrisons of personnel where they are needed most along with necessary equipment.

Gundam,3dpq62,OutZoned,3,Sat Jul 18 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"This a mini guide that I've posted before that may be able to help you. There are basically three routes that make it easy to follow based on the timeline each show is in: Early Universal Century, Late Universal Century, and Alternate Universe.  Early Universal Century: These shows are all connected and exist in the same universe. They're probably best watched in the following order.   Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ (Technically skippable, but necessary for full Unicorn experience) Char's Counterattack Mobile Suit Gundam 0080 (Can be watched alone, but best at any time after 0079) Mobile Suit Gundam 0083 (Can be watched any time after Zeta Gundam) The 08th MS Team (Can be watched alone, but best at any time after 0079) Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn IGLOO (Optional, can be watched after 0079) Origin (Can be watched after 0079)   Late Universal Century: These ones happen after the events of Unicorn and are generally separate from the main UC timeline. They can be watched independently of the rest of the series and each other, but are probably best watched after completing the Early Universal Century.   Gundam F91 Mobile Suit Victory Gundam Gundam G no Reconguista Turn A Gundam (Should probably be watched after seeing some Alternate Universe Shows as well)   Alternate Universe: Each of these shows are independent of each other and the rest of the series. They can be watched at any time.   G Gundam Gundam Wing After War Gundam X Gundam SEED and SEED Destiny Gundam 00 Gundam AGE Gundam Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try  (Potentially best saved for after you've seen a lot of other Gundam shows or are familiar with Gunpla)"
Gundam,3dpq62,OutZoned,2,Sat Jul 18 21:30:41 2015 UTC,"This is amazing. Now I ask you, would you say are all quality series? will I get bored with some even with them being important to the whole series? it's indeed a lot to watch, would you say there isn't a short list of series for a starter to watch to get hooked before starting watching it all? Like for example starting with SEED that is quite modern and has good reviews?"
Gundam,3dpq62,OutZoned,2,Sat Jul 18 21:43:47 2015 UTC,"Not all of them are 10/10 must watch TV, but the majority are very good and very fun shows. As a Gundam fan, even the ones I dislike have a place in my heart and some incredible moments. If you have a hard time with older animation, it may be easier to start with something newer.   For starter series, I would recommend these:   0079 - Old, but still good and provides the conceptual foundation for Gundam shows. If you like it, you'll probably like the rest of the shows. Watching this lets you begin to watch the rest of the UC, which is the meat of Gundam.  Gundam 00 - Modern, fun, with great characters, good animation, and an political plot. SEED - A little dated visually, but provides a good entry point to get acquainted with Gundam shows. This was many people's first modern Gundam.  The 08th MS Team - Beautiful, fun action show with a setting unique for Gundam series. It gives you a decent idea of the Universal Century and requires no prior knowledge. Gundam Wing - The setup is a little different from the rest of the Gundam shows, and it shows its 90s origins on its sleeve, but it's fun and it delves into the core anti-war themes of the broader Gundam Series.    My personal favorites:   Gundam 0080 - My overall favorite Gundam show, but the one that is probably most unlike the rest of the series. Powerful, thematic story with an emotional punch.  Gundam Unicorn - The pinnacle of the Universal Century story and the culmination of decades of TV history. It's worth watching everything else in the UC in order to fully experience what Unicorn offers.  Gundam 00 - My favorite alternate universe Gundam.    Do Not Start With:   Zeta Gundam Gundam 0083 ZZ Gundam Char's Counterrattack Unicorn Origin IGLOO F91 Victory Turn A G Gundam"

Gundam,3dpq62,randomking0x70,2,Sat Jul 18 06:42:50 2015 UTC,I don't think Build Fighters should be the first Gundam series you watch it's not really what the core Gundam series is about.
Gundam,3dpq62,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:44:01 2015 UTC,A good start is like most people recommend gundam 00 after that you can start the universal century(UC)
Gundam,3dnwzh,adammcdorman,15,Fri Jul 17 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"Well, it really depends on what that person fancied watching.   If they wanted a relatively typical modern stand-alone series with a political edge, I'd suggest 00.  If they were curious as to the franchise's origins and the beginnings of its influence, I'd suggest either the original TV series or the trilogy of films made from it. If they wanted a fairly self-contained ground-level war story, I'd suggest The 08th MS Team.  If they wanted something upbeat and silly and light-hearted that would quietly let them imbibe some Gundam tropes, I'd suggest Build Fighters."
Gundam,3dnwzh,soracte,10,Fri Jul 17 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"Gundam 00 is what i would recommend to people that want to try get into Gundam because i feel that if you don't get into it within the first 10 episodes then that would be the best time to drop it and try something else and you would not need to worry about needing to go back and watch it as its a self contained universe not linked to anything else other than its movie.  The stuff you should try to avoid if your just getting starting off with imo is the UC timeline stuff unless your going for watching everything in production order and can put up with some dated animation and so on, once you into gundam you can let that kinda thing slide more easly than if its your first visit to a gundam series"
Gundam,3dnwzh,OranosSonaro,8,Fri Jul 17 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"Gundam Wing, or Build Fighters are the first ones i'd think of to introduce someone to."
Gundam,3dnwzh,majorkurn,5,Fri Jul 17 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"I imagine most people in the US were exposed to Gundam through Wing, so yeah, that does sound like the best route if you want to introduce someone to the metafranchise."
Gundam,3dnwzh,HumanMilkshake,3,Fri Jul 17 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"0080 War in the Pocket.  It is short (six episodes, half hour each), it is quality (absolutely no filler), it has a nice balance of action and storytelling, and despite being a side story, it is easily accessible to viewers with no exposure to Gundam, while giving them a very good taste of what the series does best.    I say all of this confidently, as it was my first exposure to Gundam, almost 20 years ago."
Gundam,3dnwzh,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"This guy's got it right. It's got very good animation, pretty good writing, and some of the best fights in the whole metaseries."
Gundam,3dnwzh,Infernal-Blaze,3,Sat Jul 18 02:27:27 2015 UTC,Start with the Mobile Suit Gundam compilation movies.  That'll get you in on the ground floor.
Gundam,3dnwzh,Turambar87,3,Fri Jul 17 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"Turn A wound up being a great introduction to the franchise for my wife, especially because it sort of deliberately undermines its own Gundam-ness. It has a lot of well developed characters too, and an interestingly rich world to it  EDIT: and it goes without saying that it definitely works well as a stand-alone thing."
Gundam,3dnwzh,doctorfedora,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"new to anime huh? i guess it partially depends on what anime you've watched and what you like but i'll suggest a few different gundam for a few different tastes:   gundam seed: it's a very i don't quite know how to put it but 'gundam' gundam anime and it's a great entry point for watching gundam aside from watching the original gundam (which is very old but if you don't mind that it might make a better entry point, especially for understanding other UC material but gundam seed is essentially just a more modern re-imagining of the original gundam) gundam 00: my personal favorite gundam and much like gundam seed (and Age) are modern updates to the original gundam, gundam 00 is like a modern re-imagining of gundam wing and so so good, it's a very interesting and serious gundam series G gundam: you can find and watch the entire series dubbed (in english) or subbed (japanese with english subs) on youtube and it's awesome and really fun and shouldn't be taken as seriously as the above two series but it has great action and great characters it can be a little dbz like but that's half the fun gundam unicorn: honestly i'm not completely sure if gundam unicorn is a great place to start with gundam other than being both an awesome and absolutely beautiful series animation wise what its place on this list is as a recommendation of UC (universal century) in general which is the main gundam timeline, unicorn is the only UC series that i've seen but it is amazing and made me want to watch more but this entry could be replaced with any UC title just try and experience this timeline even if it is by watching the original gundam first, or 08th MS team or war in the pocket, etc gundam build fighters: to be honest as much as i love build fighters and build fighters try (and i LOVE both shows) i would not recommend them as a persons first gundam series primarily because part of the fun in watching them is seeing and understanding the references to other gundam series and i wouldn't want to deprive a potential gundam fan of that fun but after you've watched like 1-3 other gundam series then yeah jump right into build fighters and enjoy that roller coaster :D"
Gundam,3dnwzh,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:57 2015 UTC,"I normally wouldn't say Unicorn since there's a bunch of stuff that references the One Year War and the Neo Zeon conflicts, but 3 of my friends (who previously had no interest in Gundam) watched it and went onto watch at least a few more Gundam series since. I think that awesome action and taste of an interesting Universe was enough to draw them in. My vote would probably still be for 0080, but it's harder to convince people to sit down and watch a giant robot show that has a relatively small amount of giant robots."

Gundam,3dffdk,MightyBrigade,14,Thu Jul 16 09:14:48 2015 UTC,HG Wing Zero Custom   I'm so sorry for you.
Gundam,3dffdk,AnimeGeek441,8,Wed Jul 15 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"Oh god I didn't even notice he got the 90's one, OP, you have my condolences"
Gundam,3dffdk,DarkMime77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:19:04 2015 UTC,"I just built that exact one last week and nothing really struck me as awful.  Granted that was my first Gunpla kit, but it was definitely not the lowest quality model kit I have dealt with.  What exactly makes the kit so bad? (not trying to start a fight; just curious how to tell a bad vs. a good kit)"
Gundam,3dffdk,Hellbender79,3,Thu Jul 16 00:49:24 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it was the 90's HG and not the RG or recent HG of the Wing Gundam? Its not as nice looking, undergated, doesn't have good posablility and the head proportions are a bit wonky. With a bit of TLC and some paint, its not bad, but out of the box it's not as good as any modern HGs.  And it's not an insult to the design or OP, the old Wing HGs are very much products of their time."
Gundam,3dffdk,DarkMime77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  The box is identical to the OP's, but beyond that I couldn't say anything more about it.   So would a good rule of thumb be that newer produced kits are better than the old ones?"
Gundam,3dffdk,Hellbender79,2,Thu Jul 16 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the high-grade kits that were created before the 'official' HGUC line became a thing generally are nowhere near as good as any of the kits we have now. It may not be that obvious, but try building one of the new Wing Gundam HGs and it'll be super obvious what the old ones are lacking.   I do wish we got more HG AU stuff, I don't know why we got an HG Seed when Seed has it's own 1/144th line that's not that bad, AGE and G-Reco did it right, they have seperate HG lines that pretty much covered every major design, hopefully we'll see something like that for Wing someday..."
Gundam,3dffdk,DarkMime77,4,Thu Jul 16 13:37:29 2015 UTC,"That HGUC RX-78 probably isn't going to be super great either. Jesta is good though, so that's nice."

Gundam,3dffdk,YuriusFarrence,2,Thu Jul 16 00:14:20 2015 UTC,At least it won't be a huge loss if he botches something; Wing HGs are good for experimentation.

Gundam,3dffdk,YuriusFarrence,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:30:48 2015 UTC,HGUC Rx78 is actually pretty decent and more stable than the wing kits.
Gundam,3dffdk,Rx0Unicorn,2,Thu Jul 16 16:17:31 2015 UTC,"It's more stable, sure, but it was released in 2001 and it shows. There's a reason that they're releasing the Revive."
Gundam,3dffdk,SonuNova,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:31 2015 UTC,"Funnily I bought one at my b&n just recently as well. Yes, the kit Is a mess, and only takes an hour tops to assemble, but the reason I bought it was for the wings for a kitbash. Set of wings for 8 bucks? Sounds perfect to me! And I get those beam rifles as well! So for kitbashing a badass kit I think this is one of the best kits you can get"

Gundam,3dl6og,MrSparkle86,4,Fri Jul 17 04:07:22 2015 UTC,"So I whipped this video up real quick showing Kira's progression through SEED and Destiny of his newtype abilities awaking.  1st segment: The first time Rau has a newtype flash triggered by Kira, previously only triggered by Mu, a newtype.  2nd segment: Kira senses something bad has happened, his latent newtype abilities begin to awaken.  3rd segment: Rau has yet another newtype flash triggered by Kira.  4th segment: Kira's newtype abilities are clearly much stronger by Destiny as he is able to sense the crew of the Minerva in their fight with the Earth Alliance.  5th segment: Kira's first full fledged newtype flash.  6th segment: Kira's newtype abilities warn him of the DRAGOON attack from Rey; he is also able to sense something amiss, and familiar, from the pilot of the Legend Gundam.  7th segement: Kira and Rey communicate with each other through their newtype abilities."

Gundam,3dl6og,RJWalker,8,Fri Jul 17 09:13:41 2015 UTC,"welp, the thing is, in gundam SEED, there is no such thing is a ""Newtype""."
Gundam,3dl6og,BoyGodz,-7,Fri Jul 17 09:48:14 2015 UTC,"That's where you're wrong. The term itself is not used but Kira, Rau, Mu and Rey are all Newtypes."
Gundam,3dl6og,RJWalker,8,Fri Jul 17 09:49:24 2015 UTC,"Not in the same sense as UC Newtypes, though. Kind of like how Newtype is a thing in Gundam X, but entirely different from Newtypes in UC.  Also, it is not actually part of the canon setting. It was just a a twit from Fukuda that get taken out of context by fans when translated."
Gundam,3dl6og,BoyGodz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:06:35 2015 UTC,I never said they're exactly like UC Newtypes. But it's clearly intended to be far more than just a similar concept.
Gundam,3dl6og,that80skid,4,Fri Jul 17 10:22:50 2015 UTC,"What I want to get at is that ""Newtype"" isn't a official term for people like Kira. the myth of ""CE has Newtype"" basically originates from a misinterpretation Fukuda's twit without proper context. In his twit he used the term ""新人類"" meaning ""the new human"" literally to describe his take on Kira, even though this term is sometimes used to describe Newtypes, it is not interchangeable with the correct term""ニュータイプ"" and the term ""Newtype"" is never used beyond a description term for ""空間認識能力"".  The idea of having a more evolved groups of people has always existed in CE. I remember George Glenn saying in Seed Astray, he coined the term ""coordinator"" in hopes that coordinator will act as the bridge between the ""old humans"" and the ""new human"". But it is still technically incorrect to call those people like Kira ""Newtypes"""
Gundam,3dl6og,BoyGodz,2,Fri Jul 17 10:56:18 2015 UTC,"Then by all means, how would you explain Kira's progression through SEED and Destiny with abilities not shown by any other characters except Rau, Mu, and Rey, who, by the way, also experience newtype flashes. Yes, that effect with the lightning bolt going across the screen and the high pitch ring is called a ""newtype flash."" That effect, used throughout SEED and Destiny from beginning to end, is obviously not put in on a whim, but planned to be there from the get-go. So, Kira gets newtype flashes, he can sense immanent danger, and he can sense and communicate with other newtypes... how?   If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, well, it's probably a duck."
Gundam,3dl6og,BoyGodz,4,Fri Jul 17 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That's what I'm curious about. How would someone that doesn't agree that it's not being implied that Rau, Mu, Kira, and Rey have some sort of sixth sense?   The flash and the sound effect are clearly paying homage (if not being the exact same flash and sound) to Newtypes from U.C. Now, it's never fleshed out (as far as I know of) in the Cosmic Era on these certain individuals abilities. It's never directly stated, but it's heavily implied that these characters are similar to what Newtypes are from the U.C.   But hey, if people want to disagree with you, just recommend that they watching (or re-watch) Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, Gundam ZZ, and Char's Counterattack."
Gundam,3dl6og,NageQsad,0,Fri Jul 17 17:40:15 2015 UTC,"The flash and the sound effect are clearly paying homage (if not being the exact same flash and sound) to Newtypes from U.C.   And...That's where the problem come in. Apart from ""paying homage"" by re-using sound effect and flash, there is nothing that suggest Kira&Co is the same as UC Newtypes. Every other series has some advanced human that do that telepathic communication thing, they just have the creative energy to give them a proper name and special effects.   But hey, if people want to disagree with you, just recommend that they watching (or re-watch) Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, Gundam ZZ, and Char's Counterattack.   Last time I checked, Newtype in UC do more than just that weird blink thing. Come back when Kira can do Newtype wizardy things."
Gundam,3dl6og,RJWalker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"Except Newtypes do far more than just sense danger and communicate telepathically.  Actually, What Kira and Mu and Rau has shown to do in Seed and Destiny is no more than what every other ""evolved"" human has done in their own series. Innovator from 00, X-rounders from AGE and Newtypes (explicitly stated to be different from UC Newtypes but they still do ""Newtype flash"") from X all sense immanent danger, and communicate with others, are they all Newtypes now? No.   So, no, even if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is still not a duck. It just mean Fukuda couldn't even be asked to think of a new effect. And until Kira start making Freedom invincible and make an asteroid floats, they are not Newtypes."
Gundam,3dl6og,NageQsad,2,Fri Jul 17 17:39:41 2015 UTC,"You're right. Fukuda took all the good parts of newtypes like being able to sense danger and communicate with other newtypes, and left out the green hippy space magic deus ex machina.  Now, do innovators have newtype flashes? No. Do X-rounders have newtype flashes? No. Weirdly, the newtypes in Gundam X do have newtype flashes. I guess that makes sense since they are newtypes, and 4 people in SEED and Destiny get newtype flashes and exhibit similar abilities, sans the green fairy dust.  Besides all that, the 'evolved' human in CE isn't even the newtype, it's the SEED factor, which has a different effect and different abilities. Did you forget about that? I guess Fukuda did indeed use a new effect. Newtypes in CE are ambiguous, and seemingly occur more often in naturals than coordinators, just as the SEED factor occurs more often in coordinators than naturals. This could be where CE is heading in future stories."
Gundam,3dl6og,BoyGodz,2,Fri Jul 17 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for clearing that out for people who keep saying things about newtype in C.E. If the title is ""Coordinator ability"" i think is more correct instead of ""Newtype""."
Gundam,3dl6og,RJWalker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:24:09 2015 UTC,"Coordinator has already been adopted by those who are genetically modified during birth and among the known CE Newtypes, there are more naturals that coordinators."

Gundam,3dl6og,RJWalker,0,Fri Jul 17 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"I hope every other gundam series would have used a different term/sound effect/that blink thing that happen in front of forehead, to distinguish the difference between Newtypes and whatever new, evolved human they have in their AU like 00 does and avoid the confusion.   This goes Gundam X as well, I would much rather they invent a different term than just calling those people ""Newtypes"", but at least I understand why that has to be the case for X."
Gundam,3dl6og,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:46:21 2015 UTC,Of course it isn't an official term. That's why fans call it newtype. Because it's the closest term.
Gundam,3dl6og,RJWalker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"Of course it isn't an official term. That's why fans call it newtype. Because it's the closest term.   Not sure how that logic operates.   In fact, since this is a similar yet different concept to Newtypes, fans should stop calling them Newtypes, so people won't be as confused, I am sure most people would come to a similar conclusion as me.  I mean, why would you insist to use a unofficial term when it brings nothing but more confusion?"
Gundam,3dl6og,var1ables,3,Fri Jul 17 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"I never said it's logical either, just like I never said CE Newtypes are exactly like UC Newtypes. CE Newtypes are extremely similar to UC Newtypes in what they can do. Since an official term was never given, fans call then Newtypes because it's simpler. And I highly doubt it brings much confusion."

Was it coordinator exclusive?    Nope, Cagalli has it.   Basically, people with SEED mode are more evolved than the rest of the people in the Cosmic Era. Their genes are better.   Were we really supposed to feel something when Flay died? Seriously?   Relief if you hate her, sadness that she will never get to redeem herself after undergoing so much development if you don't mind her.   How did Kira survive the Aegis explosion and the fight with Shin, and how did Mu survive the Dominion's Lohengrin beam?    Director Fukuda appears to operate more on what looks cool rather than logic.   I could've sworn I saw a helmet come off in the explosion.   Retconned.   Are ghost girlfriends going to be a thing?   You may want to avoid Zeta.   In Kira's final fight with Rau, how come Rau didn't just keep his distance the whole time and make use of his Dragoons? It was working just fine.

It was working just fine.   This isn't how the fight went down. In the early fight Rau generally kept his distance, except for that one time he cut off a sword arm. The Meteor was too big for Kira to adequately defend. When Kira came back with just the Freedom, he still kept his distance (Kira's the one who made approaches, and Rau consistently pulled back) and met with less success. Partially because Freedom is more nimble by itself and (probably) because Kira had gotten a little more used to fighting his dragoons (that's usually how fights introducing 'bits' in Gundam go). Rau fought the battle correctly. Kira was just better.  Edit: Since you're asking for recommendations, I recommend Gundam X, because it is the best."

Is that correct?  I don't really think it gives much of an explanation to be honest, in fact I find it to cause more contradiction than before because the the pilot seat in strike's cockpit was clearly destroyed which means the explosion has clearly got in the cockpit."

She was originally planned to be much more to the series, so this could have just been something that carried over but she's just weird:     In early draft of Gundam SEED, Flay was supposed to be Strike Rouge's pilot and used by Earth Alliance for propaganda. http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Flay_Allster    No one is completely sure how he escaped the explosion, theory is that the armor of the strike somehow deflected a lot of the explosion away and because he is the ultimate coordinator he was able to survive, this is discussed in the Astray manga when he is found after this scene by Lowe, one of the MC's of the manga. He survived the fight with Shinn by quickly turning off the Freedom's reactor before it exploded, its shown in the series. The remaster changed the Mu scene. They weren't ever really a thing   Gundam SEED's director, Mitsuo Fukuda states that Flay's ghost didn't actually appear. The scene was merely a way to illustrate what Flay could've said to Kira.  Not sure why Rau decided to change to melee, but he was probably pushed that way by Kira and got over confident.   We were never shown much of Lacus and Kira's relationship, outside of when battles were going on they seemed fairly happy. Lacus confided a lot in Kira towards the end of Seed. It's just not really shown on screen a whole lot but there is alot there."
Gundam,3dgsp8,WhitzWolf,3,Thu Jul 16 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"No one is completely sure how he escaped the explosion, theory is that the armor of the strike somehow deflected a lot of the explosion away and because he is the ultimate coordinator he was able to survive,    I always figured he survived because the Aegis self-destructed. The blast would have been directed inward to destroy the Aegis, or at least eliminate any useful materials/data that could be gathered from the wreckage. Self-destruction is a tactic for preservation of secrets, not a weapon.  And plot armor, all Gundam pilots have plot armor....except when they don't."
Gundam,3dgsp8,TipTapTips,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:47:04 2015 UTC,"That does make sense with how self destruction should work, but given the explosion we saw and how Athrun was blown away, may not have been how it happened. Although the strike didn't really get damaged afterwards.  Plot armor does seem to be a huge contentious issue within Seed discussions. Some people don't seem to mind when other shows use it but when seed does, it's this huge flaw."

Gundam,3dgsp8,WackyModder84,-4,Fri Jul 17 09:51:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Lacus. But the fact that you're using GundamWiki as a reference is already a problem on its own. GundamWiki's articles are all Assumption-Based Garbage and are to be taken with a massive grain of salt.  First of all, All Official information regarding SEED mode is practically non-existant other than the fact that it can both be had by Naturals AND Coordinators. But there are so many plot-holes surrounding its origins and mechanics that nothing about it makes any sense at all.  Second of all, while that is true, Flay was supposed to be the pilot of the Strike Rouge, you neglected to mention the other details about Flay as well. Your creator, Mitsuo Fukuda, said the following:   Q: The finale you had in mind?  A: Flay was suppose to be a human bomb. She returned as a human bomb to Archangel. She was going to blowup outside of the ship along with Sai. Then Kira was going to die with Athrun losing an arm...   Third of all, the word you're looking for is ""PLOT-ARMOR"", my dear. ;-)  And if I may point out, the whole ""Ultimate Coordinator"" theory is nothing but a Crock of Shit on its own right from the very beginning. In fact, Kira being called The Ultimate Coordinator in the first place is nothing but a massive heap of Telling Rather Than Showing. So it ultimately ends up being completely moot because of this.  Fourth of all, here's another thing Fukuda said about the whole ""Flay Ghost"" thing, too:   Q: About Flay's Lalah-esque meaning?  A: The title of that scene was ""What Flay wanted to tell him."" (a way to let the audience know what Flay wanted to say). However a dead person can't express their feelings so Kira never heard those words. Which means Kira never got to know Flay's feelings and he has to carry the burden of her death.   Fifth of all, you don't even know of your own relationship with Kira? WOW! Fukuda was right about that too!!! LOL =D   Q: Who does Kira like?  A: He doesn't really like either of them (Flay and Lacus).   But in all seriousness, Lacus.....  I think you need to re-check your info. And for future reference, heed my word on this one. NEVER EVER rely on GundamWiki for solid info on Gundam. Their articles are Extremely Flawed and Assumption-Based up the ass. Take what you see there with a Huge Grain of Salt."

Gundam,3dgsp8,Ace370,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"It seems like everyone answered your questions already but as always, the debate is still ongoing. Let's just agree to disagree here. That being said, I think its safe to say that the SEED series will forever be the most controversial series in Gundam.  I will say as a disclaimer that SEED is my favorite series, but its very flawed. You're not going to get the answers you really want because of issues behind the scenes with the production staff. So many times I see on this subreddit posts typically saying ""I just finished the SEED series...what happened; it started off so well?"" I think the biggest upset--dare I say it-- is that it started out with a lot of promise of a great alternate universe series that ""could"" parallel the U.C. timeline. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen anyone complain about the first 25 episodes of Gundam SEED or up until Kira's first miraculous recovery. Most people have trouble with the ending of the first series and then everything shortly after Destiny begins. But let's be honest here-- this is not the only time an anime has had unexplainable recoveries in a series, SEED just has the most.   By the way, Code Geass would be a strong recommendation of mine. Its not Gundam, but made from the same people. It has a few similar elements to SEED, but overall, Geass just does it better.   TL;DR: When things get rocky behind the scenes, the writing and production value suffer along with it and things tend to fall apart. But if you stayed to watch the entire 100 episode saga, they must've done something right."

Was it coordinator exclusive?""   SEED Factor can be inherited by both Naturals AND Coordinators. It's not limited to either one. GundamWiki has this bullshit, assumption-based explanation of how SEED Factor is activated, but in reality, the Official Details on SEED Factor are so fucking vague and limited that it's more or less just a Pseudo-Super Saiyan Mode that instead of increasing your Power Level, just makes you Super Concentrated and Blocks Out All Distractions.   ""Were we really supposed to feel something when Flay died? Seriously?""   Idk about you, but I actually kinda sympathized with Flay a little bit. She was one of the very few people in Gundam SEED that actually has flaws with her character, so she was actually quite interesting. It's obvious that she was meant to be unlikable, but that doesn't mean she's not interesting as a character.   ""How did Kira survive the Aegis explosion and the fight with Shin, and how did Mu survive the Dominion's Lohengrin beam? I could've sworn I saw a helmet come off in the explosion.""   The Answer is Simple, my friend:  The Power of Bad Writing.  There is literally nothing else to it.   ""Are ghost girlfriends going to be a thing?""   It's not uncommon to see this in Gundam, but the way SEED handled it didn't really make too much sense, sad to say. Newtypes don't exist in SEED & Destiny, so unfortunately the whole thing with them shouldn't really be present here like it was in the U.C, and yet Fukuda throws it in there anyway because.....Idk.   ""In Kira's final fight with Rau, how come Rau didn't just keep his distance the whole time and make use of his Dragoons? It was working just fine.""   I would say about 90% of the time, Rau was doing just that. But every so often, he still had to defend himself in Melee against the Freedom. But you also have to remember that Kira took out quite a few of the Providence's DRAGOONs in that fight. At that point, Rau had to work with what he had as best as he could.   ""BTW anyone else notice that Lacus was pretty damn manipulative?""   ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY!  Lacus Clyne is somehow magically more Charismatic than fucking Adolf Hitler for absolutely no reason. Her character is totally baffling in every single way possible, and is without question, The Worst Written Character in Gundam History to this day.

Gundam,3dgsp8,WackyModder84,-2,Thu Jul 16 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"That is complete and utter bullshit if I've ever heard it, Sparkle.  There is literally Zero Official Documentation which tells off this other than one little interview with Fukuda where he reluctantly said this:   Q: Are Mu and Rau Newtypes?  A: Both are the last remaining Newtypes. They were the last Newtypes in the world so I wanted to write a story where non-Newtype people try to solve the problem.   But anyone in their right mind who has followed Fukuda's Interviews for some time now knows damn well that Fukuda's Words are not to be trusted under any circumstances. This guy is known to not only Contradict Himself and His Own Lore, but he is famous for Damage Controlling, Making Up Excuses, and just Flat-Out LYING to evade questions he has no answers to. And in some cases where he really doesn't have an answer for them, he responds with the biggest cop-out of ""Oh, really? I didn't know that! (laughs)""  If newtypes truly were in the Cosmic Era, that would make absolutely no fucking sense. There is no backstory for them. Nothing is mentioned about Newtypes existing prior to the Cosmic Era's events in the 1st SEED at all. The whole ""Newtype Flash"" thing that happened with Rau and Mu was barely explained at all as to how they can sense each other's presences. The only thing we were told was that ""Somehow, Mu can tell when Rau Le Creuset is close"". That's about it. Sure, we were shown backstory of Rau and Mu together when they were younger, but that alone doesn't explain anything about how they can supposedly have foresight on each other's presence. And ontop of that, the Newtype Flash thing that happens seems to be just indicating that the people who do that have Enhanced Spatial Awareness of some kind. Nothing Newtype Esque was done in SEED or Destiny whatsoever other than Rau and Mu inexplicably being able to sense each other. That's about it."

Gundam,3dgsp8,WackyModder84,0,Fri Jul 17 04:06:35 2015 UTC,"""How can it be utter bullshit? The examples I cite are from the anime, it's hard canon that is indisputable.""   What examples, dude? You didn't show anything yet. All you did was just tell me how Newtypes are a thing, and didn't show anything whatsoever. And may I remind you that the ""hard examples"" from the anime you talk about so heavily literally made no sense at all, and had zero context behind them whatsoever??   ""Why does there have to be a backstory for newtypes? Why do they need to be mentioned?""   Sparkle, are you kidding me right now? Are you seriously asking this question? This is Fiction 101 shit right here, man! If we don't see it with our own eyes, and if it was never established in the narrative, then it doesn't exist, dude! Sorry to have to burst your bubble, but that's just how Fiction works. Newtypes were never, I repeat, NEVER, an established thing in the Cosmic Era. If they really were, then they would be a much bigger part of the story, AND we would also see more of than just Three People. Kira's so-called ""Newtype Awareness"" was something that Fukuda literally pulled out of his ass and made absolutely no sense whatsoever. It was never explained, never elaborated on, and never even explored into ever again. Meaning that this whole thing with Kira's so-called ""Newtype Awareness"" is nothing but a Big, Fat, Asspull by Fukuda just to make Kira even more unnecessarily powerful for no reason.   ""As far as I'm concerned, all that does is give the CE universe something to further delve into in a future series, which is brilliant! An emergence of a new kind of human evolution that occurs more often in Natruals than Coordinators can provide some great overarching plot points for future series.""   Perhaps if Newtypes were actually talked about and actually established in the context of the story, then YES! You would be absolutely right. Then maybe we could see something like Gundam X, where Newtypes become a bigger part of things. But unfortunately, the word ""Newtype"" isn't even said out-loud anywhere throughout the course of SEED, Destiny, Stargazer, or ANY itteration of the Cosmic Era. Sooooo....Yeah.   ""Also, I put together a little video real quick with each scene that illustrates Kira's awakening to his newtype abilities: https://vimeo.com/133721880""   I just explained above how all of that was nothing but a total asspull.

Gundam,3dgsp8,RJWalker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:38:55 2015 UTC,"You realize that newtypes have to come from somewhere right? That they won't suddenly be something that everyone knows about and understands? What we see in SEED is a concept identical to newtypes (only the name itself isn't used, everything else is the extremely similar) but said phenomenon is only beginning to emerge and no one really knows much about it. Kira is not the only one with newtype-esque so I don't get why you'd say that it's just an asspull to make Kira more powerful (oh wait, I do get why you'd say that: anti-circlejerk is strong in this subreddit).   Perhaps if Newtypes were actually talked about and actually established in the context of the story,   They're not talked about because hardly anyone knows about the phenomenon unlike UC where by the time we're introduced to it, the concept was already somewhat understood by the characters in the series.   If we don't see it with our own eyes, and if it was never established in the narrative, then it doesn't exist,    We do see it with our own eyes. It is established in the narrative. It just isn't given a specific name. Mu and Rau teacting to each other's presence, something that can only happen because of newtype powers. And we see Kira's awakening as well. Several of these moments are crucial for the story to progress the way it does. Mu even talks about being able to sense Rau. That is called establishing a concept. Unless you think something needs to be spelled out in big huge letters in which case, you're the one who doesn't understand how fiction works.   But unfortunately, the word ""Newtype"" isn't even said out-loud anywhere throughout the course of SEED, Destiny, Stargazer, or ANY itteration of the Cosmic Era.   So you're basically butthurt about a name. It's just name, dude, calm down. The fans use the term newtype because it simpler to use to describe the phenomenon which was never given an official term."
Gundam,3dgsp8,WackyModder84,-2,Sat Jul 18 09:39:15 2015 UTC,"""You realize that newtypes have to come from somewhere right? That they won't suddenly be something that everyone knows about and understands?""   You realize that not every Alternate Universe has Newtypes, right?   ""What we see in SEED is a concept identical to newtypes (only the name itself isn't used, everything else is the extremely similar) but said phenomenon is only beginning to emerge and no one really knows much about it.""   First of all, the so-called ""Newtypes"" that we see in SEED aren't even remotely similar to the ones we see in the U.C. Timeline or Gundam X. The only thing these ""Newtypes"" you speak of can actually do is just Mu and Rau inexplicably being able to sense each other's presence, and Kira inexplicably getting Enhanced Spatial Awareness and kind-of, sort-of, being able to sense where Rau was at the end of the 1st SEED.  Second of all, even Fukuda's own bullshit words contradict this as well:   Q: Are Mu and Rau Newtypes?  A: Both are the last remaining Newtypes. They were the last Newtypes in the world so I wanted to write a story where non-Newtype people try to solve the problem.   Even though Fukuda's Words are not to be trusted, it's still something that should be noted that he said Out-Loud back when SEED just finished airing. Even though Rau and Mu's ""Newtype"" abilities they supposedly have can't do anything other than sense each other. Newtypes have already proven to be far more than just that. And hypothetically speaking, if these two really were the supposed ""Last Remaining Newtypes"" like Fukuda is bullshitting about in that quote, that implies that they've probably been around long enough for their Newtype Abilities to have awakened plenty by now. And what we see in the series completely contradicts this entirely.   ""Kira is not the only one with newtype-esque so I don't get why you'd say that it's just an asspull to make Kira more powerful (oh wait, I do get why you'd say that: anti-circlejerk is strong in this subreddit).""   Yes. Blaming the entire community attacking SEED's flaws justifiably suddenly counts as an Anti-Circlejerk. Riiiiiiight. >_>  Second of all, I wasn't accusing Kira of being the only one having this problem. What I am accusing Kira is him getting these ""Newtype"" powers out of nowhere at the very end for absolutely no reason. THAT is the Asspull to be known, here.   ""They're not talked about because hardly anyone knows about the phenomenon unlike UC where by the time we're introduced to it, the concept was already somewhat understood by the characters in the series.""   Yet again, I already proved that Newtypes don't exist in this era. There was no theory on any type of Human Beings having these abilities that was passed around. There was nothing that was explained about them or went into detail. We, the audience, didn't see anyone going into any theories or explanations on why Rau and Mu can sense each other, and instead Mu and Ramius just talked about it for 20 Seconds each briefly, and never touched upon it again. Bro, you clearly have not heard of the concept of ""Telling Rather Than Showing"". Because the only thing that they SHOWED us in the anime was that Rau and Mu can sense each other's presence, and that Kira randomly decided to be able to sense Rau's Presence at the end of the 1st SEED, and that's it. And like I said before. Even Fukuda's bullshit handwaving, as laughable as it is, even goes against what you're saying here. lol   ""We do see it with our own eyes.""   YET AGAIN. The only thing we, the viewers, see with our own eyes. Is that Rau and Mu can somehow sense each other's presence, and that Kira magically could do it too with Rau at the end of the 1st SEED. We are shown literally nothing else besides that, and that's nowhere near enough visual evidence to prove the existence of Newtypes in the Cosmic Era in this case.   ""It is established in the narrative.""   LIKE HELL, it is! I feel like a broken record now for how many times I'm repeating myself here. There is literally nothing in the lore that talks about this any further than just a couple of sentences from the anime from Mu, Ramius, and once with Rau in the beginning. SEED Astray, Stargazer, etc... series don't even attempt to go into more detail on this, or show others besides Rau, Mu, and Kira who may also have the same shit as them either. So the real truth is, NO. It is NOT written into the narrative whatsoever.   ""Mu and Rau reacting to each other's presence, something that can only happen because of newtype powers.""   Riiiiiiiiiiiight. That's what we called ""assuming"", dude. If SEED really did go into detail with this, I guarantee they probably would have come up with a term for this shit by now in the same matter as 00, AGE, and X did. Especially considering Fukuda's Bullshit Handwaving about ""Oh, Rau and Mu are the last remaining newtypes"". If that was even remotely true, they would probably be talked about quite a bit more with SEED's past lore. It's baffling how you're not even thinking of this shit, dude.   ""And we see Kira's awakening as well.""   At the end of the 1st SEED. And yet it is never ever expanded upon ever again after that. And again, nobody else in the SEED Universe in Astray, Stargazer, etc.... has this happen to them either.   ""Several of these moments are crucial for the story to progress the way it does.""   Really? Because the only thing Kira did with his ""Newtype"" abilites was just find Rau so he could fight him. He probably could have done that even without those abilities. And take Mu La Flaga, for example. When he sensed Rau inside the Mendel Colony. Even if he didn't sense him, chances are, they probably would have found them either way, considering they already picked them up on Radar. They're not just gonna leave 3 Nazcas alone, after all. Of course they'd investigate what's going on with them. So idk what the hell you're talking about with that one, dude. lol   ""Mu even talks about being able to sense Rau. That is called establishing a concept.""   Yeah, for a brief moment. Afterwards which we get no further elaboration on later at all. If we actually saw Mu try to understand why he can somehow sense Rau, and actually look deeper into it, THEN perhaps that would be considered just that. But no, we don't see anything like that whatsoever. Yet another example of Telling Rather Than Showing at its finest.  Honestly, dude. This whole reply of yours can be summed up entirely with just 3 words: ""Excuses, Excuses, Excuses."" I really suggest you look deeper into the Cosmic Era next time, because literally all the signs in not just the animes of SEED & Destiny, but also the Astray and Stargazer series, all point to Newtypes not being a thing in the Cosmic Era whatsoever. If you can't see that, then idk wtf to tell you. It is what it is."

I have a unrealistic theory that this is in the far distant time after age since Mars in already terra-formed and the Gundam upgrades itself from parts of the enemy is easily explained because the age device was destroyed in the Age series. So the age device was lost in history and never recreated but people kept the idea of and ever evolving gundam alive in story. Also if you look at the Vagans at the end of the Age there have special units to repel the Mars Rays. So Mars is liveable for them so terraforming is not that off as the next step. And the earth government was corrupt by the 2nd generation so its not unlikely that it happen again. And the Calamity War between Earth and Mars was 300 years ago plausible reference to 100 year war between Vagans and Earth. Its an Age sequel.  But lets be realistic its a alternate universe.

As for Vagans they created Flight Unit 02 Everse System Gafran Mars Feather with the EXA-DB and the Age device to counteract the deadly Mars Ray. Although I believe there was a entire episode center on EXA-DB along side Zeheart mastering the Legallis Gundam and at the end EXA-DB was destroyed at the end. So yes data from both system is useable but the actually system themselves are gone."

Gundam,3dc3s0,rlziii,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:29:35 2015 UTC,hg x1 fc fails hard because even the white is pearl white.  Norn can easily be painted by markers due to it being normal gold then metal red on the lines.  The G Self however has yellow stickers on the sides of the face and a black + red + yellow forehead circular sticker directly on its head.  You almost never see any hg kit with a stickers on its head aside from the eyes and the antenna for old kits unless its an old sd kit that's what makes the HG G Self special as it has more than normal for any HG kit.

I feel like the world is great, the characters, the story, all solid. But the delivery, the directing, is where it falls apart. Tomino is in his 70s. Trying to direct a weekly TV is a lot of work and stress. I feel like he should have been in charge of series composition, with someone else taking the director's chair.   But I don't feel like we have a good chance of it ever getting cleared up now. Gundam very rarely visits an older series once it moves on (in this case with Iron-Blooded Orphans). The only exception I can think of is Z Gundam: A New Translation.   Does anyone have a good summary of what happens throughout the entirety of G-Reco? Would love to read through it."

A thought he wouldn't've had if they were actually friends, mind.   why this was happening, why that was happening...   If you'd be more specific, we could probably point out things you missed.

I really enjoyed what G no Reconguista had going for it, again, it just felt rushed at times, and the ending was so underwhelming. I enjoyed almost all of the mecha designs. The animation was beautiful. Gorgeous. (I'm a big fan of Eureka Seven as well). The backgrounds were so lush. The character designs and characters were interesting as well. The music was brilliant. It felt refreshing and fun.  The more Gundam series I watch nowadays, the more unsatisfied I am with all of them. Maybe I'm just hard to please.

Gundam,3ddloi,Benigmatica,6,Wed Jul 15 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"In the '90s there were 4 Gundam series back to back — V, G, W and X — which may have exhausted the audience and be the reason that led to the cancellation of GX in 1996. Ever since, Gundam series have usually been aired every 2-3 years in order not to saturate the audience. Turn A was aired 3 years later in 1999. Three more years later, in 2002, SEED was aired. A couple years after that, in 2004, there was SEED Destiny. In 2007 there was 00, the first series to be split in two seasons of 2-cours each and I can only assume the reason for it might have been the model kits. And it really worked for them.  4-cours in a row would've lasted them from october 2007 to september 2008, but instead by splitting the cours in half, they had until march 2009 to keep exploring the series merchandising and by announcing the movie, which hit japanese theaters in september 2010, they had by then over three years worth of kits and merchandising.   Speaking of HG kits alone, 00 had 72 kits between both seasons and the movie, the first being the Exia in october 2007 and the last being the mass-produced Brave in late november 2010. Again, that was just the HGs, let alone 1/100 kits, MGs, the FG line which was 00's version of NG 1/144s.  In october 2011 there was AGE, in which Bandai had huge expectations and was until now the last series to have 4-cours in a row. I assume most of you have seen the graphic in which they expected to have a 140% growth in merchandising (I'm not sure if in number of kits or sales alone) and the toyish gimmick of the Gundam AGE really allowed for several other models, as seen mostly in both PSP video games and other MSVs, except the sales came nowhere near the expected, with japanese fans posting photos of AGE kits sitting in shelves with higher and higher discounts as the show went on, and even so managed to have 35 kits, the last of them being the AGE-1 Full Glansa.  Although one thing that people noticed with AGE and may have inspired in some way the motif of the following series, Build Fighters, was the fact that most people who bought HGs used them to customize and kitbash them into different units.  Hence when BF was aired in 2013, along came the HGBC (BC being Build Custom) with optional parts which either made for the show's kits or for people to use and customise their HGs into anything they wanted to. Between BF and BFT (2-cour as well, aired six months apart just like 00), there has been 41 kits. Four of them haven't even been released yet: two of them are coming out this month, with two more coming out next month and the next after that. And that's not even counting the HGBC parts which, of course, aren't as expensive as kits themselves, but have 24 sets of parts so far, and I'm not sure whether the line will end along with BF/BFT merchandising.  Aired in 2015 along with BFT, there was G-reco. So far there are 17 HG kits, one of them being released late this month and the other, hopefully not the last (here's hoping for HG Hecate), next month. Going by the designs, still more 'usual' than Turn A's, I assume this move by Bandai was in order to have BFT keep selling and making them money even if they didn't cash in with G-reco, which was more likely to make money to Sunrise instead with BDs and DVDs. Then again, both are the same thing, but still.  My point, after this really lenghty and probably unnecessary explanation, is that in nearly the same time Bandai explored the 00 merchandising and released 72 HG kits alone, three different 2-cour series have released 93 kits in HGs alone. The number would probably reach over 200 kits or even more if you count MGs, RGs and all the other model lines released in nearly the same period as 00 has.  We all know Gundam are one long tv commercial for plastic kits. We all love it and we all gladly spend our money on Bandai and by splitting stories in 2-cours at a time, they either can keep people interested for a longer period of time or simply move on to the next best thing and try and make them more money. By making them 2-cour, they manage to have new series or sequels out every year and still have some buffer between then so people won't get exausted just like twenty years ago."
Gundam,3ddloi,nontelop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:41 2015 UTC,"Great post there, nontelop. However, Sotsu, Sunrise, and Bandai should make a 2-cour Gundam series every 2-3 years.  I mean, airing G-Tekketsu in October 2015 (in MBS) right after G-Reco is similar to TV Asahi when the TV station air 4 consecutive Gundam shows from 1993 to 1996."
Gundam,3ddloi,nontelop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"A 2-cour show every 2-3 years would definitely have fans craving for more gundam due to shorter series and longer wait between them (I know I definitely would), but I assume it would be worse for them since there would be less time to explore each series' merchandising, the lenght of the story would likely affect the number of units (not every series can cram about 50 different designs in 2-cours like g-reco did) and definitely would reduce the number of kits released.  The longer gap between series would mean more time between HG lines (which given their numbers compared to MGs, RGs and other lines, seem to be their main source of profit for Bandai when it comes to kits) and the shorter the serie is, there will be less designs and less airtime to promote them, resulting in less kits.  I'm no expert here, but my opinion is that the best strategy for them would be 4-cours split in half with a six-month interval between them every couple years. That would result in more time to promote kits and a little breathing room for the audience between series.  The only thing left is to see how the yearly 2-cour series works for Bandai. So far it seems to be paying off, but only time and the audience can tell."
Gundam,3ddloi,wingsarch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:14:54 2015 UTC,"Aside from the merchandising strategy, the anime industry in Japan has been shrinking drastically, making it more and more difficult to produce a 4-cour anime. If you look at the trend, back in the 80s-90s where most people would call it the golden age of both Japan and the anime industry, a 50+ episode anime was the norm. Since the industry shrinkage in the late 90s and early 2000s, it gradually shifted towards a 2-cour or roughly 26 episode anime. Nowadays, most of the animes that come out are 1-cour 13 episode long. So it's not really Gundam series downsizing, but rather the entire industry.   Tomino also mentioned in a recent interview that the reason for G-Reco's unusual pacing was due to the fact that it was suppose to be a 4-cour series that was to develop and explore the characters more in-depth. However, he mentioned that it's not very possible to make it a 4-cour anime because of the current cost to produce an anime and stresses it has on the animators.   Also to note, the only reason G-Reco and GBFT came out simultaneously was because of how much money they made from GBF and since they already have other Gundam projects planned such as G-Tekketsu. With all the hype and popularity that GBF generated, it was still worth it to invest into another project which would be broadcast along side G-Reco.  Save to say, Bandai's got some real smart minds that know how to maximize profit behind those closed doors. (AGE aside.)"

So I wouldn't be at all surprised if the new Gundam is either just two cours, or four in two two-cours instalments. If that happens, it's not just a trend for Gundam, it's Gundam conforming to a trend in anime in general."

Gundam,3ddfeb,dodododuo,7,Wed Jul 15 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"It depends which timeline you talking about:  UC - The original Gundam was named that cause its a General-purpose Utility, Non Discontinuity Augmentation Maneuvering weapon system. Later they renamed the Luna alloy to Gundarium, because of the Gundam, and then Mobile Suits stopped using Gundarium alloy, and in F91 it was called Gundam because it looked like the original, and in Victory, Zanscar calls it that because its a weapon against the colonies.  FC - Mobile Fighters used in the Gundam FIghts.  AC - Mobile Suits made of Gundanium alloy.  AW - Mobile Suits made of Lunar Alloy.  CC - not known, made before the series.  CE - anagram for the OS of the gundam  AD - Mobile Suits that have GN-drive engines (idk if thats accurate i havent watched 00)  AG - Mobile Suits with the AGE system  RC - not known.  PD speculation - Mobile Suits used in the Calamity war before the series  Edit: fixed UC defenition due to /u/OmniNoc  Edit 2: updated AG defenition, thanks to /u/alkonium  Edit 3: corrected names of AD and RC, thanks to /u/alkonium again"
Gundam,3ddfeb,TheCivilizedGamer,3,Wed Jul 15 12:13:29 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that the acronym was never ever used in any UC animated production and it's status as a canon fact is dubious at best. I feel like it's an unnecessary ""backronym"". Generally in the entire franchise, gundam is just a name for any thing that looks at least vaguely like the original gundam. Some continuities have more specific rules, as mentioned."
Gundam,3ddfeb,animerb,2,Wed Jul 15 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"Actually for UC, they used Luna Titanium Alloy to make gundam. Later on, they changed the name to Gundarium. Basically the name Gundam exist long before Gundarium called as it is."

Gundam,3ddfeb,DenkouNova,4,Wed Jul 15 17:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, almost any mobile suit with V-fin on its head (except Ez8) is a gundam, no matter who built it. IIRC I've read somewhere someone mention that the name gundam itself not necessarily means the ultimate mobile suit that will blow up any grunts on sight. It's called gundam because it has the trademark V-fin on its head.  I'm sure someone can give a better explanation.  edit: better explanation?   The v-fin doesn't really mean anything in regards to what's a Gundam or not; some Gundams don't have one, while some mobile suits that aren't Gundams do. The only consistent factor on what's a Gundam or not is whether or not the suit is addressed as one by the show, characters, or creators; if you include any other factors, you're bound to find an exception.   Context"

Gundam,3ddfeb,MagickSkoolieBus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"If Mobile suits had a soul, that souls name would be Gundam, and those mobile suits that inherit the soul of Gundam retain its name as well.   I know this isn't right, but so far as i have watched into the series, it kind of fits in my opinion. Each character, over time begins to change in the way they view the world, and even interact with it. Almost as if they are being influenced in a almost meta-physical sense.   I believe that once a person has reached a point of Ultimate Power, like with being really adept with a mobile suit, a veritable mini warship in its own right; they become susceptible to the influence of the Soul of Gundam, and that is what ultimately makes a suit a Gundam instead of a Mobile suit.   If a soldier is a mobile suit, the Gundam is a fanatical green beret."
Gundam,3ddfeb,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:04:02 2015 UTC,gundams are usually the mobile suits that are doing the most curb stomping unless they're red then they're a char clone instead :D

Gundam,3dc2bd,l4zyhero,4,Wed Jul 15 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"This a mini guide that I posted in a comment in /r/anime that may be able to help you. There are basically three routes that make it easy to follow based on the timeline each show is in: Early Universal Century, Late Universal Century, and Alternate Universe.  I've crossed out 00 and Build Fighters since you've already seen them, but the rest of the order should still generally apply.  Early Universal Century: These shows are all connected and exist in the same universe. They're probably best watched in the following order.   Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ (Technically skippable, but necessary for full Unicorn experience) Char's Counterattack Mobile Suit Gundam 0080 (Can be watched alone, but best at any time after 0079) Mobile Suit Gundam 0083 (Can be watched any time after Zeta Gundam) The 08th MS Team (Can be watched alone, but best at any time after 0079) Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn IGLOO (Optional, can be watched after 0079) Origin (Can be watched after 0079)   Late Universal Century: These ones happen after the events of Unicorn and are generally separate from the main UC timeline. They can be watched independently of the rest of the series and each other, but are probably best watched after completing the Early Universal Century.   Gundam F91 Mobile Suit Victory Gundam Gundam G no Reconguista Turn A Gundam (Should probably be watched after seeing some Alternate Universe Shows as well)   Alternate Universe: Each of these shows are independent of each other and the rest of the series. They can be watched at any time.   G Gundam Gundam Wing After War Gundam X Gundam SEED and SEED Destiny Gundam 00 Gundam AGE Gundam Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try  (Potentially best saved for after you've seen a lot of other Gundam shows or are familiar with Gunpla)"
Gundam,3dc2bd,OutZoned,2,Wed Jul 15 05:03:27 2015 UTC,Holy wow this is awesome! Thank you so much Definitely a lot easier for me to figure out where I should start. edit* wow just checking 0079 and zeta is about 93 episodes together.
Gundam,3dc2bd,OutZoned,2,Wed Jul 15 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"If 0079 is too long, you can definitely watch the compilation movies instead. It's three movies that cover the original Gundam. You shouldn't watch the Zeta movies, though."
Gundam,3dc2bd,OutZoned,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:18:23 2015 UTC,Oh good theres  compilation movies. I just checked and theres about 187 episodes (the films i split into thirty minute intervals counting as one episode) which is about 233.75 hours (if I did the math right)  Are the movies named anything specific? or should I google 0079 compilation movies?
Gundam,3dc2bd,OutZoned,2,Wed Jul 15 05:21:41 2015 UTC,"The three movies:   Mobile Suit Gundam I Soldiers of Sorrow Encounters in Space   These movies cover all of 0079. After that, you can start watching everything else, really. Yeah, it's a 200+ hour endeavor to try and watch everything, but there's really no need to do so. You can get a very good sense of Gundam by watching a smaller chunk of it.  Most fans would say the ""meat"" of the series is the Universal Century, but most of the total content is in the Alternate Universe shows. The Early Universal Century is about 75 hours of content."

Gundam,3dc2bd,Captin_Agordian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:11:09 2015 UTC,I've heard 08th is one of the best series. what's Gundam Unicorn about?
Gundam,3dc2bd,Captin_Agordian,3,Wed Jul 15 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"Unicorn is a bad place to start in my opinion, as it kinda requires that you know the series that came before it to understand what's going on. While there's not any major connection in terms of characters, the events that happened in the timeline are important to understand what certain things mean and why things are happening the way they are. Plus a lot of the suits in the series are direct callouts to other titles in the franchise.    If you're not one of those people that's turned off by older animation (which you shouldn't be if you're trying to get into a 36 year old franchise), I'd recommend the original Mobile Suit Gundam. I've started several people off with it and they all come back for more afterwards, plus it's nice to get an indication of where the franchise began."

Gundam,3d9kru,elsinestres,4,Tue Jul 14 20:46:43 2015 UTC,Its pretty widely considered to be the best of the metaseries.
Gundam,3d9kru,kuroyume_cl,3,Tue Jul 14 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"Zeta is awesome, the first 5 and last 5 episodes feature some movie quality animation. There's some memorable fights and episodes that'll stick with you. It's still the standard 50 episoded of non-stop fights though, so it's still stuck in monster of the week style television."
Gundam,3d9kru,Gundam336,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:08 2015 UTC,"I like non-stop fighting, a big reason why I loved Build Fighters! So that shouldn't be a problem for me. Movie quality huh I'll see how it gopes. I find the older animation style a bit hard to swallow at times but willing to give it a shot :)"
Gundam,3d9kru,CitrusChrome,3,Tue Jul 14 16:29:27 2015 UTC,"The compilation movies for Zeta are awful, don't bother with them. The pacing is off and the animation is inconsistent since they spliced new animation with a totally different style with the original 80s TV animation."
Gundam,3d9kru,Nick700,2,Tue Jul 14 17:44:18 2015 UTC,Z is one of the best gundam series ever.
Gundam,3d9kru,existingsvb,2,Tue Jul 14 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"The second season of 00 draws a lot from Zeta, so if you liked tht, there's a good chance you'll end up liking Zeta."

Gundam,3d9kru,KnightofGold,2,Tue Jul 14 22:52:37 2015 UTC,Many say it's the best series.
Gundam,3d9kru,abugoy,2,Wed Jul 15 00:31:41 2015 UTC,The series is better. Also for 0079 the series is better
Gundam,3d9kru,Neocarbunkle,2,Wed Jul 15 19:38:39 2015 UTC,when i was younger i thought it was a stupid looking gundam (me being a stupid gundam wing is the best ever and nothing can touch it type of fan) and i remember saying i will never watch that. me now that i am older it is one great series i loved every part of it at first the design of zeta i didnt like that much but as i watched it i grew to like it. i think it is one of the best they have ever produced and im glad i got out of that stupid phase and finally sat down to watch it
Gundam,3d9kru,crazyjeffy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:52:04 2015 UTC,"I have not watched the compilation movies of Zeta but found the show itself to be fairly enjoyable.   It is definitely a series with a fair amount of ""down time"" however, which can come of feeling like it has been poorly plotted , or has too much filler content, or some parts last too long. This seems to be something inherent to Tomino series, and though some do not like it, I find it enjoyable, and that it really stitches the story together.   If these parts were edited out in the movies (and they would definitely be the easiest to remove) it would definitely feel much faster but much choppier.   As for Zeta itself I liked the mobile suit designs, especially of the enemy suits, there were some really cool set piece battles, and the characterization and character development, though sometimes infuriating, was never unwatchable.   Considering it with the other series I have watched (0079, Reconguista in G, Turn A, Build Fighters, Build Fighters Try), I would rate it a solid 6.5.  TLDR: it was alright but has pacing issues and Tomino character development, if you want something really easy to get into that is a lot quicker and more immediately fun, try watching 0083 Stardust Memories, which is basically  ""Broken Arrow"" meets ""Top Gun"" (at least from the few episodes I have seen so far)."
Gundam,3d5rs3,WackyModder84,16,Mon Jul 13 19:13:24 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it, though I'm kinda curious about that waist. Even for mecha standards it looks really impractical, since that thin section has carry a lot of weight."
Gundam,3d5rs3,Kyo220,16,Mon Jul 13 19:39:34 2015 UTC,The mobile suit is clearly still being put together and still hooked up to shit in this picture.  Obviously that's not what it's gonna look like in combat. That would just be silly. XD
Gundam,3d5rs3,sdwoodchuck,16,Mon Jul 13 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"I almost hope that is what it looks like in combat.  I like silly when its handled right, and impracticality is pretty much a staple in Gundam.    Maybe instead of swapping out backpacks all the damn time, this Gundam swaps out its whole lower half."

It might lower and raise the entire thing for the pilot by the look of those piston rods. The practical sense in me says this is stupid- but the Tiger Face in me says FUCK YEAH  Although my intuition tells me it's most likely just missing a core fighter or it's just a shot of it still in 'development phase'."

I could go for a sadistic no-nonsense MC for once. I like the Loran-Bellri Archetype but it's  a little overdone.   I wouldn't mind another Heero though.  My guess is this is going to be a new AU- I think Sunrise wants to make a new series and make it accessible to any and all newcomers. Sunrise might be trying to push a Gundam series out that can storm the mainstream anime lists like AoT, Sword Art Online, and ETC.  (It's not a coincidence they are rolling out the classics in America just before this thing, maybe they want to slowly inject classics to draw some attention to the new one.)   I'm totally okay if that's the case, the world needs more Gundam fans."

Gundam,3d3y4r,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:02:02 2015 UTC,"I can't really get a sense of the top of its head.  None of that looks like an appropriately solid mass.  Probably just the angle, though.  The V-Fin is too fat right in the middle (where the ""gem"" portion of it is), but again, could just be the angle of the shot.    Other than that, I like the design.  I like the unique shoulders, I like that the arms have a bit of a classic mixed with new design elements.  I like the upper torso, I'm not entirely bothered by the fact that there isn't a lower torso.  The back looks like it has some kind of unusual protrusions for thrusters and such, so that looks like it will look pretty good.  Can't see the lower body, but I think the legs will be important in the design as well; otherwise we've got a gorilla of a Gundam.    I'm not too fussy about mecha design though.  A good show will have its designs grow on me regardless.  I'm still more interested to see how they play out the title.  Tekketsu carries specific historical implication in a pretty dark direction, and I'm really curious to see how well they lean on that."
Gundam,3d3y4r,Zero_GS_EXE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"From the angle of the head, I'm guessing that the V fin is placed at an angle much like with the Astray frames.   In which case that would look really fucking awesome."

Gundam,3d3y4r,Galgamore,2,Mon Jul 13 18:36:18 2015 UTC,I wonder if the no abdomen and pipes+pistons has to do with it being under construction. Like the countdown is to see it fully finished...

Theres also a REALLY good text based playthrough here.  The series is perhaps my all time favorite video game series.  I easily spent 150+ hours on it, I had to stop playing as it began interfering with my real world productivity.  I have learned about and enjoyed suits because of Gihrens Greed, which made me go and watch series I hadn't expected to (like the amazing MS Igloo).    The japanese put me off for about 1-2 hours, but it's worth the pain.  I recommend starting off with ""Shin Gihren no Yabou"" (or New Gihrens Greed).  It has improved UI for a non-japanese player such as a little picture of the MS whwnever you scroll through the names.    I also recommend playing them on the PS Vita or PSP with Japanese PSN.  Actually having buttons to press and the pretty screen makes the games that much more fun."

Gundam,3d25j5,crazyjeffy,4,Mon Jul 13 04:11:49 2015 UTC,And then it becomes awful again when they get back to space and there's cross-dressing comedy shenanigans in space Chinatown.

Gundam,3d25j5,Palikun,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:50:24 2015 UTC,Am I the only who thought Unicorn was kind of Dumb. ZZ was much better IMO.
Gundam,3d25j5,OutZoned,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:56:14 2015 UTC,You're probably not alone. Gundam has too large of a fan base for there to be only one opinion about a show.

Gundam,3d25j5,Palikun,0,Mon Jul 13 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"Not really, Banagher is a boring lead piloting probably the blandest Gundam Design. Full Frontal is literally a Char Clone and Laplace's Box was a pretty poor plot twist. Marida and Zinnerman were the only likeable characters.  Compared to ZZ which had Judau Ashta probably the most relatable pilot in UC. Piloting the ZZ which is kind of Blocky but at least has colors. Fighting with Haman Karn one of the more complex villains in the canon and Glemy Toto who may or may not be a Gihren Clone.   ZZ does get convoluted due to rewrites later in the series but at least in stays interesting unlike Unicorn where we just watch Banagher go on a treasure hunt for the most disappointing reveal.  The entire OVA was really unsatisfying, especially cause people hype it as the best thing ever."
Gundam,3d25j5,r0botosaurus,3,Mon Jul 13 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"Let me get real with you as someone who considers himself a fan of ZZ.  The first point I want to make is that the show gets better as it goes along. Make it past Moon-Moon and you're golden. The MS designs get wicked as fuck and the show gets nice and dark.  My second point is that Beecha and Monda can get arilocked. Fuck them, they suck, and we're stuck with them. I am so sorry. But at least we get Puru and Puru 2."
Gundam,3d25j5,gyagoda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"Episode 17, they're off of it.   I'm also kind of annoyed with the two little kids that have been on the ship since Zeta. Why they are allowed to say, get keycards to release prisoners...I think it's happened twice, once in this and once in Zeta? /shrug"
Gundam,3d25j5,r0botosaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"The Earth arc is good, especially Dublin, but the entire show after Moon Moon is not consistently good. The slapstick comedy makes a return at the most awkward of times, and then it jerks back to trying to be a serious war drama again... Except all the jerking back and forth between lighthearted adventure story and sci-fi war drama makes all the characters (like Glemy) a mess to figure out, leaves huge plotholes (how does Leina survive?), and generally leads to nonsensical shit like Beecha becoming the captain of the Nahel Argama -- I mean what the hell? If the entire show had the same tone it did for the Earth arc it'd be pretty good -- but it doesn't, it keeps switched back and forth and as a result the show suffers."
Gundam,3d25j5,existingsvb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"I never said it was perfect, I said that it gets better. For what it's worth I enjoyed some of the lighter moments and all of the new characters (save for Beecha, Mondo, and Ms. I Wanna Bang Bright from the La Vie En Rose). The show had some great battles and some awesome Zeon MS designs to go with it.  It's not the best, but it's not as bad as SEED, SEED Destiny, Wing, or Victory, imo."
Gundam,3d25j5,RicyRice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:17:39 2015 UTC,"if it was just judau his sister and puru i wouldn't complain, i love puru she was freakin adorable"
Gundam,3d25j5,Morzas,7,Tue Jul 14 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"ZZ right after Zeta is generally reccomended against due to the drastic change in tone. I personally reccomend putting ZZ on hold and watching an alternate timeline Gundam in the meantime. ZZ is not a bad series by any means, I quite like it actually, but it is certainly not something one would want to watch after Zeta."
Gundam,3d25j5,maullido,3,Sun Jul 12 22:56:45 2015 UTC,The little kids are the worst. His friends are also the worst too.  I'm just slowly chuggin my way through the UC timeline to rewatch Unicorn as I loved it without the significant bits of backstory.

Gundam,3d25j5,jarjarsinks,2,Mon Jul 13 01:40:30 2015 UTC,"I started it, watched G Gundam, then went back to ZZ. The beginning is still a little rough but much more enjoyable with a palette cleanser of something less serious that Zeta. The tone is still all over the place though."

Gundam,3d05tk,jdmflcl,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:33:12 2015 UTC,Char's Counterattack looks better than both I'd say
Gundam,3d05tk,Nick700,4,Mon Jul 13 01:41:32 2015 UTC,F91 definitely has a leg up on Char's Counterattack. CCA had some incredibly cool scenes but was lacking detail in mid-to-far shots/scenes. F91 is gorgeous just about all the time.
Gundam,3d05tk,sandals0sandals,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:18:36 2015 UTC,Yeah basically this   man those animations are glorious
Gundam,3d05tk,cactusfag,18,Tue Jul 14 12:53:51 2015 UTC,It looks pretty incredible but you have to remember it is a movie budget and also F91 does not use a lot of shading so it's easier to fit more detail into the rest of the scenery/animation along with that.
Gundam,3d05tk,wavyhairedsamurai,2,Sun Jul 12 12:08:28 2015 UTC,That movie budget really did do wonders for the animation.
Gundam,3d05tk,robo_duck,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"It was also originally planned as a full series, so a lot of the pre-vis and concept work had probably already been done, allowing them to funnel more money toward animation."
Gundam,3d05tk,bullsear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:04:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know that! I'm not sure how to feel about it not being a series, but I'm glad that what we ended up with was very high quality as a result."
Gundam,3d05tk,robo_duck,7,Wed Jul 15 11:41:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, F91 is gorgeous. Do you remember how beautiful the moon looked at the end?"
Gundam,3d05tk,DefrostedTuna,4,Sun Jul 12 12:27:26 2015 UTC,"F91 absolutely has some lovely animation. In some ways it only makes the half-assembled nature of the story more frustrating, but it is very beautiful to look at. There is some really nice foley work too, imo -- lovely sounds for the mobile suit footsteps.  When it comes to good animation the age of the title is less important than the time, money and talent available to the production, I think."
Gundam,3d05tk,soracte,3,Sun Jul 12 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"I was noticing the foley work as well while watching F91 for the first time a few weeks ago.  Even the weaponry sounds unique, but without necessarily reproducing a real-world equivalent or using old lazer tropes."
Gundam,3d05tk,bullsear,2,Tue Jul 14 07:06:15 2015 UTC,I completely agree with that last comment. Just compare animation in the original Macross series to the Do You Remember Love? film the came just a year later.
Gundam,3d05tk,ghostFOUR7,4,Tue Jul 14 08:57:24 2015 UTC,"I say this anytime the movie comes up in conversation.  It is beautiful, and I like the movie well enough just for that reason alone, never mind the fact that it's not actually a good movie."
Gundam,3d05tk,sdwoodchuck,3,Sun Jul 12 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"NO, you're not. All of the Gundam movies' animation looks good to me or am I the loopy one?"
Gundam,3d05tk,jm8080,2,Sun Jul 12 12:56:46 2015 UTC,"It does look great. The beginning is the best colony attack sequence in all of Gundam. The rest of the movie isn't the greatest, though."
Gundam,3d05tk,OutZoned,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:22:55 2015 UTC,"The first half hour is pretty strong, but after that they're condensing down an entire series storyline, so you can see where things get tricky."
Gundam,3d05tk,bullsear,2,Tue Jul 14 07:04:46 2015 UTC,"No you are definitely not watching this clip at 1080p is amazing, so much attention to detail."
Gundam,3d05tk,geronimoux,2,Tue Jul 14 02:13:52 2015 UTC,You are not going loopy. F91 doesnt get enough love.
Gundam,3d05tk,draivaden,6,Sun Jul 12 12:44:16 2015 UTC,That's because people keep remembering that it stole music from Star Wars. Honestly it is a pretty great movie though!
Gundam,3d05tk,LuchaMode,7,Sun Jul 12 13:54:57 2015 UTC,I love F91 but the story is very choppy. To call it a great movie is a large stretch.
Gundam,3d05tk,baconbitarded,7,Sun Jul 12 16:48:09 2015 UTC,Choppy story is what happens when you take a 50 episode TV show that has about 12 episodes written then force it into a movie.
Gundam,3d05tk,JQuilty,4,Sun Jul 12 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that's not the viewer's responsibility to account for.  Whatever the reason, it isn't a great movie.  It is a gorgeous one though."
Gundam,3d05tk,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:40:24 2015 UTC,Well of course all I'm saying is it is a bit of a stretch to call it pretty great. It is good. But nowhere close to great. When I see G-Reco I am reminded of it
Gundam,3d05tk,baconbitarded,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"Which is sad, because G-Reco had 25 eps instead of two hours, and it would likely have gotten its second season if the first 15 episodes hadn't been a hot mess with no character development."
Gundam,3d05tk,bullsear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:07:53 2015 UTC,What is the story behind that? Gundam and Tomino by extension were proven money makers. What spooked the marketing people into telling Tomino that he has to turn it into a movie?
Gundam,3d05tk,rsteroidsthrow2,2,Wed Jul 15 04:30:01 2015 UTC,I use great as in entertaining(I laugh every time the bootleg Star Wars music comes on).  Personal favorite of the Gundam series would be 0083 Stardust Memory.
Gundam,3d05tk,LuchaMode,3,Sun Jul 12 16:53:34 2015 UTC,It also stole some plot elements from star wars. The animation was great though.
Gundam,3d05tk,thereddaikon,3,Sun Jul 12 18:55:06 2015 UTC,"Let's not kid ourselves though, Gundam in general stole a lot from Star Wars. Star Wars changed the landscape of sci-fi, and Japanese sci-fi was no exception."
Gundam,3d05tk,gyagoda,0,Sun Jul 12 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"It deservedly gets shat upon because the story is just a huge mess. They tried to jam a full 50-episode series into one movie and as a result it's just a clusterfuck. Probably the best-looking Gundam, though, animation-wise. And I'm a massive fan of the mech designs in it as well."
Gundam,3d1s3f,welp42,3,Sun Jul 12 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"if you're referring to the RightStuff release, I think they are pretty good. Names translated accurately, subs are timed properly, all in all a worthy release.   I'd have liked a dub, but maybe in the future. I'd gladly double up for it."
Gundam,3d1s3f,Onyx_Blackmen,3,Sun Jul 12 20:46:47 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that a dub comes when they do a bluray release.
Gundam,3d1s3f,ghostFOUR7,2,Mon Jul 13 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"That would make sense. They probably tried to avoid doing so with Turn A because they didn't know how successful this would be. Why spend hundreds of thousands in voice actors, a voice director, an editor, etc. Versus a couple of translators, a programmer, and then encryptor (who may be the same person)"
Gundam,3d1s3f,Onyx_Blackmen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:31:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm referring to Right Stuf's release, but hesitated to call it such because I wasn't sure if they handled translation as well as distribution.  When I watch subbed anime, I get bothered by ""bloated"" dialogue due to overly literal translation, so I was wondering if Right Stuf did a good job preventing that."
Gundam,3d1s3f,Onyx_Blackmen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:52:08 2015 UTC,They did.

Gundam,3d1s3f,rlziii,0,Mon Jul 13 01:16:14 2015 UTC,Any chances you could rip just the subs?
Gundam,3d1s3f,swordoath,9,Mon Jul 13 04:18:31 2015 UTC,"For the very reasonable price ($35 per volume, $70 for the whole series), why not support the effort and buy the DVDs?  Even if you just plan to rip the subs from them yourself to put on your Blu-ray rips, the purchase makes a difference.  One of the major reasons that we stopped getting releases in the United States, both sub-only and dub releases, is because ""fans"" stopped buying the releases.  I was one of those ""fan.""  I thought it easier, more convenient, and cheaper to just pirate the shows.  Then they stopped coming out in English and things like official subs and dubs were done with.  We are kind of being given a second chance now with these RightStuf releases, so I've got all of mine preordered so that I can help contribute to the future releases of Gundam in the United States and other English-speaking countries.  While there are virtually sub groups that have done every Gundam release, the official subtitles are almost always superior, which is why most ""high quality"" rips use official subtitles. Just something to think about.  You'll do what you do, but it's just food for thought.  Things like Gundam give certain people, us, the fans, many hours of enjoyment.  Pay it back to the creators."

Gundam,3d1s3f,rlziii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:56:06 2015 UTC,Preach! I can't up vote this enough! People need to realize that our wallets will speak as to if we want Gundam in the West.
Gundam,3d1s3f,MDRealTalk,0,Tue Jul 14 22:53:24 2015 UTC,"I would have easily bought the series if it was on Blu-Ray.  I totally understand why they didn't release it on Blu-Ray initially, but I don't want to make any purchase until it's in HD.  Is it greedy to ask for subs when I don't plan on buying the DVD sets?  Yeah, but it didn't hurt to try."
Gundam,3d1s3f,OZKai,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:54 2015 UTC,"I completely understand this mentality.  But to an extent, and unfortunately at times for the consumer, that mentality is flawed.  This is the same thought process that hurt the anime industry initially and made a lot of companies go under with boxsets.  People stopped buying single-volume DVDs because they wanted to wait for the boxset.  But, in reality, if the single-volume DVDs don't sell, the odds of a boxset being released are very low.  Now that Blu-ray is around, the same problem has started occurring with several smaller companies that are trying to ""bring back"" certain anime.  For the much lower production cost, these companies are first releasing on DVD to see if there is a true demand for the series, then going back and releasing the series on Blu-ray.  But if everyone waits for the Blu-ray release, then the DVD release won't sell well.  And therefore we won't ever see the Blu-ray release.  Does this suck for the consumer?  Yes, it does.  But that's the reality of the business right now.  The way I see it?  If you already have the Blu-ray rips downloaded, why not just support the series by purchasing the DVDs and slap those subs on your Blu-ray rip and call it a day?  You could later buy the Blu-ray release if you felt so compelled to, but really your initial purchase made a huge difference so you really shouldn't feel the need to double dip."

Gundam,3d3sa2,ErkiB,2,Mon Jul 13 09:09:28 2015 UTC,"It looks absolutely amazing, beautiful suit. Could it have something to do with 00 Gundam? Yes it could because Gundam 00 was first released in 2007, and considering that this is an announcement, meaning that it is yet not finished, it could be like a 10 year anniversary thing for Gundam 00. I mean G-Tekketsu might very well be a code name, similar to G-Reko before the official announcement, so anything is possible.  Nevertheless, what I'm really interested in are the red markings on each shoulder and whatever is on the suit's back. Could very easily be a brand new Gundam show but maybe someone has some theories?"
Gundam,3d3sa2,JealotGaming,0,Mon Jul 13 09:16:10 2015 UTC,"Eh... If it was 00, what could they possibly do? They finished the story and all."
Gundam,3d3sa2,ErkiB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:23 2015 UTC,"That's true, they finished that story but why couldn't they do a spin-off? I mean the 00 universe is such a great one that they could easily come up with another great storyline. Is it likely? Well, I'm not sure, but the suit would fit visually into the Gundam 00 anime series, but that's a matter of personal perspective and opinion.   Honestly, I don't know but they could be whipping something up for the 10 year anniversary of Gundam 00, which would be year 2017. That's what I'm expecting, largely because they would likely release whatever this show is, in 2016 and it would run into 2017. That's a mere guess tho.  Any thoughts or predictions yourself?"

Gundam,3d1vrq,MisterPuck,6,Sun Jul 12 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"I believe that saying ""Gundam"" out-loud may have caused some change in the G-Self, ultimately resulting in a new name for it, or perhaps it's ""proper name"" being revealed.   I doubt this, not because I think the theory is too far-fetched (there's plenty of far-fetched in G-Reco), but because the G-Self isn't really much of a mystery by the end of the series.  It's an experimental suit, but its creators make an appearance, and explain why it's only workable by a select few pilots; there really isn't a mystery about it beyond that.  If it had some secret transformation, I find it unlikely that they wouldn't have at least mentioned something of it, especially since any voice-activated systems are the sorts of things they'd have to have been involved in; it couldn't just sneak up on them.   Belri is a newtype.   Yep.  Definitely plausible, and supported enough that I think we can consider it true.     The G-Self seems to have been built with psycoframe-tech.   This, I think, is your most interesting piece of speculation.  It makes sense based on how the suit behaves, however I can't even guess as to how a group of scientists might go about building a suit with a psyco-frame when that tech, and even the concept of newtypes in general, seems completely lost on the people of the time of G-Reco.    So let's kick out a theory where this might work.  There's a lot of talk about taboo practices and technology in the series.  Let's say that the engineers who built the G-Reco were doing so by either using--or recreating from schematics--tech that was used in the past.  Perhaps they have record of some of the absolute most powerful suits of the past, and they include this specific tech for that reason, though they don't actually know how it functions, or even specifically what it does (though I'm tempted to say that they do have some idea how it works; don't the Perfect Pack's separate pieces control as unique units not dissimilar to fin-funnels?)."

The reason I think it might have had some effect is simply because it's never said, and it seemed like it would have been a big deal if the name had been said. And if, as you suggested in regards to the pyschoframe, the engineers used schematics of powerful suits/systems of the past, then it's quite possible that they don't fully understand what they created even after building it. Hell, even UC era scientists didn't fully understand psychoframe-tech even though they built it.   There's also the fact that Belri's Rayhunton code had the effect of increasing the efficiency of the Creasent Ship's engines by 10%. This means that there was a limiter placed on the ship's engines that was removed. A similar limiter could be in place on the G-Self, controlled not by the Rayhunton code, but instead by the proper name of what the suit represents, the return of Gundams to UC.    (though I'm tempted to say that they do have some idea how it works; don't the Perfect Pack's separate pieces control as unique units not dissimilar to fin-funnels?).   Indeed, the Perfect Pack seems very much like a newtype weapon. All it was missing was actual fin-funnels or bits."

Well there's a difference between implementing tech based on schematics (and at this point, that's all just conjecture anyway), and implementing a voice-activated system that would respond to saying a specific word, without the designers knowing the word, or the significance of the word.  I could credit that bit of speculation a bit more if it was implied that they'd simply found and modified the existing mobile suit, but that isn't the case (or at least, all evidence says otherwise).  I can easily believe that they'd use tech they don't fully understand, but I don't quite buy that they'd use tech that they don't understand in such a specific and implausible way as to create a system that gets stronger when you say ""Gundam,"" given that none of them seem to know the word either.  The fact that the word is never said is much more likely a Tomino-ism.  He loves to reuse themes, and one of his biggest ones in Turn-A was that the term ""Gundam"" wasn't used for a long while, and until surprisingly late into the series, the ""White Doll"" wasn't referred to by the name regularly at all."

Gundam,3d06hm,translego1,9,Sun Jul 12 11:11:48 2015 UTC,"This'd be flagrant speculation on my part, but based on the comments so far in this thread, I may have cobbled together a competent theory as to why there haven't been an space Goufs.   The Gouf was developed at a time when the war was being fought almost exclusively on Earth. There were skirmishes in space, but the major battles of the war were planetside. By the time the war shifted back up into space, the Dom had started to become a dominant player in land-based combat thanks to its improved maneuverability.   My guess is that Zeon opted to go with the Rick Dom as its mainstay space mobile suit because of its improved maneuverability. While the Gouf is no Zaku (heh), it's pretty clunky next to a Dom. And while I don't know how difficult it is to retrofit a Dom into a Rick Dom, some of that almost certainly happened as Zeon was driven back up into orbit."
Gundam,3d06hm,EvilDrReef,5,Sun Jul 12 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"Most of the variants are dedicated ground units, there are the Zeon equivalent of base Jabers, and the Gouf Flight type, Other than that there has yet to be a space variant designed or animated. That being said its a Zaku descendant so the parts are around to make one space worthy."
Gundam,3d06hm,Conrii,3,Sun Jul 12 11:58:51 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong about this but off hand there isn't a specific space variant due to the fact that it ended up being overshadowed by the Gelgoog, as /u/Conrii said it is a Zaku descendant so I'm sure the potential for a space variant existed at least.  Given the nature of the OYW it makes sense that ground combat was emphasized on new models until Zeon got pushed back and once Gelgoogs started showing up reworking ""inferior"" suits to space just wasn't worth it."

It only has the backpack thrusters and smaller thrusters on either side of the lower leg."

Gundam,3cz430,SubstantialBliss,8,Sun Jul 12 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"Kinda.   The explanations tend to be very quick without much attention, if any, called to them. Not to mention, sometimes characters will talk about something and the show won't offer an explanation for what that thing is for a few episodes. It's like how in the first book of ASoIaF, they mention the Unsullied but you don't learn what an Unsullied is until book 3. Finally, the show pretty much asks you to put all the information together yourself. If you miss something, which again is very easy, that can lead to a lot of head-scratching.   Basically, how much of G-Reco you understand is based around how much you work at understanding it. We, the guys who watched it as it was airing, had it somewhat easier as we could discuss it amongst ourselves and help each other work it out. My advice is don't be afraid to ask questions."
Gundam,3cz430,Char_X_3,16,Sun Jul 12 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"It is kind of sloppy in it's handling of the plot.  I love the characters, and I like the setting a lot, so I highly recommend the series, but it is a bumpy road.  Not as bad as some people complain, but it is pretty rough."
Gundam,3cz430,sdwoodchuck,9,Sun Jul 12 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I love G-Reco, but I don't think it's without flaws, but neither is it as bad as some claim, IMO.  It was a really fun ride though, Bell was ridiculous, in a good way. Other were too, like his mom :P"

Gundam,3cz430,Beginning_Gunpla,3,Sun Jul 12 22:17:24 2015 UTC,Fucking Klim Nick man. The self proclaimed genius. Wasn't there a episode where he was taking a dump in his mech? When he attacked the tower IIRC.
Gundam,3cz430,Crossadder,2,Sun Jul 12 22:22:52 2015 UTC,"he's pretty darn funny, i actually really hated his intro scene where he's taking a dump in his mech but i liked him for being probably the only damn character in the entire series to realize that bellri was unbeatable in the g-self as there are several scenes where he's basically like 'oh we're getting our asses handed to us, bell! go and save the day!'"
Gundam,3cz430,Beginning_Gunpla,4,Sun Jul 12 22:34:37 2015 UTC,"The fine line of ingenuity and idiocy incarnate.  I liked the dump scene, it shows that sometime pilots have to be on standby for a long time, thus they need some sort of toilet."
Gundam,3cz430,Crossadder,0,Sun Jul 12 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"i agree though i'd definitely say that it leaned more on the crossing over to idiocy incarnate, while the reason for having a toilet is honestly kind of sensible the showing of its use in an anime not so much so especially since it was basically meant as potty humor"
Gundam,3cz430,Beginning_Gunpla,2,Sun Jul 12 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't say I found it funny, I just like the touch of possible realism of long-time standbys. I agree though that it was pretty much just potty humor., which I can do without."

Gundam,3cz430,Beginning_Gunpla,3,Mon Jul 13 01:14:52 2015 UTC,I also have to say the subs for it that came out at the time weren't really the best. I think a new sub group is redoing it from the ground up so hopefully it'll be clearer
Gundam,3cz430,darcwizrd,2,Sun Jul 12 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"I never had a problem with the subs, but to be fair I understand most of the Japanese and just use the subs to fill in the blanks, so I could easily have missed some lousy word choice or structure."
Gundam,3cz430,sdwoodchuck,3,Sun Jul 12 05:53:32 2015 UTC,"Watched the first episode, it wasn't quite as confusing and twisty as I thought, and most jargon they used could easily be understood when looking at the context. It WAS a little confusing in the fight scene, where all sorts of people were talking and I almost had to rewind a bit to understand what exactly was going on, due to how quickly it was going. Regardless, turned out better than I would have thought, though this IS the first episode!  also i love how the animation looks kinda like it's old but it's not I heard some people complaining about how dated it looks, I don't get how that can ever hurt the experience (it just LOOKS dated, but the animation and character design are really nice), but okay!"

Gundam,3cz430,time_axis,3,Tue Jul 14 05:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it can be a little difficult in G-Reco, because of the characters' tones of voice.  They often say really important things in vague off-the-cuff remarks, while not saying much of anything important normally.  It's kind of realistic, in that characters speak to other people as if everyone knows what they're talking about, as they would in real life.  But it makes for a confusing story."

They spend the entire series talking about how the oppression through battery distribution is going to lead to conflict, but everywhere they go is a utopia compared to what was shown in UC.  The conflict is a pointless ""we want what you have"" fight where parties involved act like spoiled siblings.  There's just no substance to it."
Gundam,3cz430,freshkicks,3,Sun Jul 12 17:24:26 2015 UTC,They shouldve maybe focused on the kuntala thing... where they ate the lower class to survive the end of the uc.
Gundam,3cz430,bullsear,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"This was precisely my problem with the series.  Conceptually, all the pieces were on the board within the firs ten episodes.  They had all the forces and motivating factors in place to tell compelling stories about characters who were the product of and in the process of forming their world.  Instead, things like the Kuntala class became little more than a shorthand version of character development bordering on cultural essentialism.    The characters likewise all show the potential for interesting story arcs, but that potential is never paid off.  The result is that nobody on screen is very likable or relatable, and their early potential makes them disappointing.  In fact, those are precisely the two words I'd use to describe the show.  Potential -> Disappointing."
Gundam,3cz430,doctorfedora,5,Tue Jul 14 06:52:24 2015 UTC,"In the end, the show feels like it was written for 50 episodes and cut down to half that, so they just sort of cut everything from the beginning of the second act of the plot line to about halfway through the third act, but they'd done all the work on location design, so the second half of the show feels like they're just bouncing around from place to place, barely interacting with anyone or anything beyond having been there.  There's also the fact that very little of the story is ever explicitly explained. Some folks liked having to pay a lot of attention to who's who and who wants what, but by the end there are like three or four main factions with two or three quarreling sub-factions each, making it kind of a mess if you don't routinely watch TV shows with a notepad in hand to take memos about character relationships. Many of those factions' storylines also ultimately go nowhere in particular, but in a narratively unsatisfying way, rather than a slice-of-life sort of way.   Ultimately, it's a fatally flawed work that held tremendous promise, but didn't get the chance it needed to be finished properly. Occasionally that promise shows through, but for the most part the best it tends to get is ""I can see what they could have done to make it so much better, if only they had more time to do it."" In a way, it's a more frustrating watch than something that is consistently mediocre or even bad, because it so clearly could have been something good, if not great.   Case in point: the epilogue is like the exact opposite of Turn A and its incredible emotional resonance: every single moment of it is just nonstop WTF because there's no established reason for pretty much any scene in it. It's like, hey, here are some drawings of characters you recognize, but doing things that are at best arbitrary and at worst completely out of character. If they had enough time to tell the show's story, some of it might have felt like character development, but instead it just jumps to ""what happened to EVERY CHARACTER all of a sudden?"""
Gundam,3cz430,migzomgwtf,8,Sun Jul 12 10:07:27 2015 UTC,"It's the first modern day Gundam Series that I have dropped while it was airing, and watched only when there was nothing else to watch.   It's not THAT confusing, but there will definitely be times where WTF is the only appropriate reaction or response. Here's a list of what I can remember from the show.   Key characters switch factions and/or board opposing enemy ships for no seemingly meaningful reason. They make a big deal of how many things are taboo, but do it anyway. You will hear Capital Guard(pronounced CAH-PEE-TAL GA-DO)/Capital Army a lot to the point that it becomes annoying. Main Character Jap VA is meh. Totally subjective though Mecha design is a step-back. Totally subjective again. As many have stated, you need to read/research/rewatch to comprehend a few things. It's NOT AS entertaining as any recent Gundam anime.   Lastly, I watch Gundam because it's formulaic, it has been my guilty pleasure since watching Gundam Wing when I was 3 or 4. If I wanted to watch something with a deeper plot, I won't be looking at anything Gundam related. This one doesn't even have a deep plot, it's just weird and random."
Gundam,3cz430,Zyr47,4,Sun Jul 12 03:36:14 2015 UTC,I think the designs and art style were the only great things about it honestly. It was at least easy on the eyes which I cannot say for the plot and my brain.
Gundam,3cz430,sandals0sandals,2,Sun Jul 12 04:39:55 2015 UTC,"to the point that it becomes annoying   At Episode 5 so far. It's certainly not quite as annoying as  CELESTIAL BEING CELESTIAL BEING CELESTIAL BEING  But hey. I'm having a lot of fun though, so I'm glad I started. So far comprehension has been surprisingly easy for me, and I honestly don't hate any of the characters so far (Bellri has proven to be the optimistic, happy-go-lucky protagonist done right; he's not stupidly goofy, but he's happy enough to prevent anything from being depressing and I found him rather endearing) I love how we have another Char clone too, it certainly wouldn't be a real Gundam series without one, eheh.  In the end though, I'm having a real hard time understanding why everyone dropped this show. It's great fun. then again i'm only on episode 5. I'd hate to drop it though!

Gundam,3cz430,InazumaKiiick,2,Mon Jul 13 05:21:58 2015 UTC,"Tomino doesn't make anime like really any other director. When watching his shows, you are meant to enjoy every minute of it. With that in mind, it's up to you to follow along and and stay with the characters as they develop an understanding of the world they live in and find their own motivations and goals.  The most important thing to remember is that conflict, for the most of the main characters of this series, is thrust onto them. They have to figure out who to fight and why- and ultimately a lot of the time that means fighting whoever is threatening them and their friends and family.   In previous Gundam shows, most of the people in them have grown up with war or the heavy shadow of recent war. In G-Reco, war is a new, fresh idea. Nationalism, patriotism, and the act of fighting for your country is treated like a new dance or music craze.  In the end, G-Reco is about knowing that Tomino is not going to waste your time, that your attention is rewarded, and that you can't watch G-Reco like most other mech shows."

Gundam,3cz430,duelistgamer,2,Tue Jul 14 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't find it confusing, but I did find it nonsensical.  In other words, the problem wasn't that I didn't know what was happening; the problem was that nothing that was happening made sense.  The plot isn't driven by the characters' actions or motivations -- they're just sort of caught up in the current of something that was going on before the beginning of the show and being swept along in its wake.    If that's the sort of thing you like, then dig in.  The production values, character designs, and mechs are top notch.  I just find the storytelling to be lacking, unlike Tomino's other series, which also retained the whirlwind feel but focused laboriously on character development and motivation."
Gundam,3cz430,Mayomori,2,Tue Jul 14 06:45:45 2015 UTC,"It's not really confusing, it's just that the story progression feels very disjointed and some of the plot points are ridiculous."

Gundam,3cz430,sandals0sandals,2,Sun Jul 12 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"it's not hard to understand as much as they kind of throw out important parts of the story in kind of random regular dialogue and not very often referenced again immediately like group names, people, and locations  say in gundam 00 celestial being is well defined in the first episode and reiterated several times throughout the first few episodes along with settings factions (union, AEU, HRL), etc  this isn't the case in g-reco where a place like towasanga will be name dropped in the first episode during a conversation without hardly any context and then basically not mentioned for about 12 episode until everyone is in outer space and headed to towasanga (hint: it's a space colony)  the same thing with the technology taboo, and the blue prints of i-forget-what-they're-named, just stuff gets mentioned kind of casually, dropped for a while and then suddenly brought back up like its really important (only to be almost immediately dropped again)  the show really isn't that bad and it can be fun to watch it just kind of feels like the writer(s) had ADHD and couldn't stay on one train of thought and it's like constantly jump around between multiple plot threads with most of them just kind of ending without really getting any resolution  oddly enough the plot of the entire series is basically best summed up by the personality of my favorite character in the series: raraiya monday   crazy in the beginning and makes little to no sense and rather irritating but then suddenly becomes a perfectly normal, competent and even smart and capable character just because no reason given it was like the crazy just flew away and then is never mentioned again yet the series as a whole doesn't properly utilize her even when she does get better   yep, raraiya is the plot of g-reco, makes no sense at first, then suddenly makes perfect sense but is still under utilized and just a bit of a mess (yet like like raraiya, g-reco might grow on you and you'll end up enjoying the series)"

The worst part is the characters, one of them is regarded as, and also thinks of himself as a tactical genius, but almost every time he's out on sortie, he damages his mobile suit.  Then there is Belri's mum, she is supposed to be a very calculating, unshakable diplomat of some sort, one episode where she was escaping a space nut (not a crazy guy, but one of the tethered space Westgate malls trying to be a colony, occupied by Nordstrom...I mean the military branch from earth) acted like she was running out of oxygen...Nope freaking out because she didn't get Belri's favourite snack before she jetted off...Priorities."

That was foreshadowing humanities first contact with alien life.    Celestial Being was created for a three-step process.     Unite humanity (CB antagonizes all of Earth, forcing governments to ally against a common foe) Improve humanity (Something like the A-Laws would arise, its up to CB to inspire humans to be better than that) First contact w/ Aliens (Now that humans are united and not evil, we have a chance at making peace with our galactic neighbors)   The ELS just happen to first aliens to reach our doorsteps. The ELS are a gestalt mind, as in their culture is just to absorb each other to become one, unified being. Humanity is an individualist culture, where each and every one of us likes being our own, separate being. The ELS try to assimilate humanity cause thats what works for them. They don't realize that humanity does not like to be assimilated.    Setsuna and the Quan[T] merge with the ELS and show them that humans don't like to be assimilated. The ELS realizes this and stops, and forms the giant space flower, using Setsuna's memory, as a token of peace to apologize.    What the epilogue tells us is that humanity and the ELS find a way for humans to be evolved thanks to assimilation, creating a new species."

Gundam,3cxw0p,jm8080,14,Sun Jul 12 13:13:44 2015 UTC,"The ELS have been living in Jupiter for a while. Their homeworld went boom, so they established a colony there.  They are creatures that instinctively communicate only through Quantum Brainwaves. For that reason, they have no concept of visual or audible communication: no concept of communicating through radio, language, or visible signals. They learn about new things primarily by absorbing them. So here's the story from their point of view:  They detected Setsuna's big GN Burst at the end of the show and got curious: new intelligent life they've never seen before! So they send out some scouts to check it out.  They get to Earth and begin assimilating things to learn, including these weird walking meat organisms. They can faintly detect QBW transmissions from a subset of these organisms, but whenever they try to reach out telepathically, these organisms recoil from them. And when they try assimilation, the organisms react violently. The ELS are very confused. Why would these creatures react with violence to a communications attempt?  They send some more forces, but these get intercepted and blown out of the sky before they ever reach Earth. During one confrontation, one of the meat organisms attempted to contact them through telepathy. Hooray! Actual communication! But when they tried to broadcast information about themselves, that organism recoiled, went silent, and ran away. The ELS are even more confused.  The big battle happens. The ELS are winning, defending themselves from these weirdly violent life-forms, but the meat organisms are fighting to the last, doing everything in their power to kill the ELS. Then one of them manages to break into the main ELS planetoid. A threat? No, he's trying to reach out telepathically. Okay, the ELS can try this again.  This time the mind doesn't recoil and shut down, they're able to get coherent, understandable thoughts as they read it, and they learn their mistake: human minds can't handle the sheer volume of information the ELS have been transmitting, and by doing so they're killing the brains they're trying to talk to. Worse, when they try to assimilate these humans as a back-up plan, they cause pain and death to the humans. That is why the humans are reacting so violently: they think they are being attacked.  This is not what the ELS wanted at all. They were never trying to make enemies: they just wanted to learn and talk to these new intelligences. But they don't know enough about communicating with them to broadcast their apology. They root around in this human's mind for a symbol they can use. Ah! He associates this flower with the idea of peace! That's a symbol they might be able to use! They morph their planetoid into this shape and recall their forces. Humanity gets the gist of the message: the ELS want to stop the fighting.  Now the ELS can start over, and try contacting the Innovators among humanity with small amounts of information at a time so they don't overwhelm them. They provide Setsuna with the location of their homeworld so he can go and open communications with the main ELS civilization. This way understanding will be reached."
Gundam,3cxw0p,SolDarkHunter,2,Sat Jul 11 21:03:04 2015 UTC,Neat writeup explaining why the ELS do what they do. I think some people may need to read more scifi if they're having trouble reaching this view... Ender's Game is a good start.
Gundam,3cxw0p,Fenixius,6,Sun Jul 12 02:59:03 2015 UTC,"Stories like this fascinate me: contact with truly alien lifeforms with values and experiences so different that the difficulties in meeting would go beyond mere cultural or even physical differences. Fundamental differences in the way even their minds work.  To me, this is the heart and essence of sci-fi: exploring possibilities of things we might never have imagined existed before.  That's why I actually really enjoyed Awakening of the Trailblazer, despite it introducing aliens into the Gundam franchise (a move I disagree with in principle, but in the case of the ELS I think a one-off exception was warranted)."
Gundam,3cxw0p,SolDarkHunter,2,Sun Jul 12 04:12:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, the ELS are so interesting because they are truly alien. In most mainstream Sci-fi aliens are really not that different from humans, so it was really refreshing to see truly inscrutable aliens."
Gundam,3cxw0p,kuroyume_cl,7,Mon Jul 13 12:48:39 2015 UTC,"The ELS were looking for a new home and appear to have been wandering aimlessly for a while. Then, they received Setsuna's QBW burst from the final battle in 00S2 and started charting a course for it. The ELS don't appear to have sensory organs like eyes or ears. The only way for them to learn and gather information is through assimilation. Combine this with QBW being their only known form of communication and you basically get an organism that unknowingly kills other organisms when learning about them.  The Earth deployed Descartes Shaman under the command of Kim to gauge whether or not the ELS were a threat. To Kim, it seemed the ELS were simply assimilating everything in its path so he mistakenly called it in to HQ as a threat to humanity. Descartes Shaman probably could have used VEDA to properly communicate with the ELS, but due to his resentment at being mistreated as a lab rat, he considered the ELS his punching bag. He made no attempts to initiate a dialogue before being assimilated. Setsuna tried to initiate a dialogue but the informational overload of the all the ELS ""screaming"" at once knocked him out.  With no more Innovators to initiate dialogues and the ELS seemingly on a warpath, the Earth prepared a final line of defense to repel the foreign ""invaders."" Once Setsuna woke up and finally communicated, the ELS realized that humans were alive. It also seems that the ELS have the ability to assist with humanity's Innovation as seen with the civilian near the beginning of the movie.

Gundam,3cvj2t,BrackMage,10,Sat Jul 11 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"Only if Sunrise committed to filling in parts of the calendar that don't have good entries already. The One Year War is saturated already; there's only so much believable tech development you can do in 12 months, and they have long passed that with the huge variety of new Gundams and mobile suits they shove into the war every time they make a new sidestory. I get that the One Year War is the defining event of the Universal Century conflict-wise, but I don't trust Sunrise to make any more OYW shit without making it a further clusterfuck.   I'd prefer to see stuff focusing on the Titans between 0083 and 0087 or an OVA series focusing on Amuro and Londo Bell (or Char and Neo-Zeon -- or both) between 0089 and 0093. Aside from that they could make Late UC stuff, since Late UC in general is very sparse and in sore need of worldbuilding."

It's been done, and very well, over and over, but lets see some new themes.  If we want to stick with UC, how about a Karaba vs. Titans side story?  Ideally I'd much rather see more of late-UC animated.  Crossbone + Steel 7, a Victory Gundam movie version, or even some late-UC sidestories.    I'm also perfectly fine with alternate universe series, but the difficulty is doing one well, without it just retelling a familiar story.  Despite it's shortcomings (of which there were many), I really liked Reconguista for it's absolutely fresh take on the Gundam themes.  More in the G-Reco setting would suit me very nicely."
Gundam,3cvj2t,sdwoodchuck,6,Sat Jul 11 04:02:03 2015 UTC,"I want to see them go back to F91 and do it as intended, a full series, maybe even have it bridge over into Crossbone, it just feels weird to leave such a big gap in the timeline unanimated!"
Gundam,3cvj2t,DarkMime77,5,Sat Jul 11 09:18:19 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see F91 handled better and Crossbone animated.  I almost think it's more likely that we'd see F91 redone as an OVA or a movie trilogy, though even that is well short of what I'd actually think of as ""likely."""
Gundam,3cvj2t,sdwoodchuck,0,Sat Jul 11 09:21:09 2015 UTC,"how about a Karaba vs. Titans side story?   Yes, so much this. If they want to add more bullshit side-stories add some to the Gryps Conflict or the first Neo-Zeon War rather than the OYW. During Zeta and ZZ it felt too often that that the AEUG consisted of the Argama and pretty much no one else, in stark contrast to the original where you got the sense the White Base was just one small part of a much broader conflict."
Gundam,3cvj2t,gyagoda,3,Sat Jul 11 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"I like what Sunrise has done recently with Universal Century.  It's hard for me to remember sometimes that only Tomino has created a UC TV show, and that at that there have only ever been four TV shows set in Universal Century.  But I like how there have been many additions that fill in other gaps within the timeframe.  Personally, with the exception of a fully-animated Gundam: The Origin, I don't really want to see another UC TV show.  I'd rather see things such as Unicorn.  Sunrise understands that the UC's fans are generally older, and that in order to better market to them, higher-budget OVAs and movies are what sell to that fanbase.  This is a good way to keep that massive part of Gundam alive without over saturating the animation of it.  I also think that new TV shows being new stories and timelines keeps the franchise fresh, even if not every new thing is a ""winner.""  As for G-Reco, I do like how Tomino's return to Gundam was set in a distant UC.  It allowed for him to still stay within ""his"" timeline, but without having to squeeze the series in between other TV shows or whatnot and gave a lot more freedom to expand the timeline in a sense.  Whether or not people enjoyed G-Reco is another discussion to be had elsewhere.  Sunrise, in my opinion, is doing a good job keep UC and AU Gundam alive.  They may be going overboard recently with releasing a lot of new animation, but that will (like always) have ups and downs."

The struggles of the AEUG that we only get hints of, the power struggles with the Titan and EFSF, etc.   I'd also like to see more Neo Zeon stories. Like maybe a series dedicated to veterans of the OYW who managed to live until the events of Unicorn or Chars Counterattack. Maybe see their perspective. We got hints of that with Gato and the Delaz Fleet.   I think IGLOO had a good idea with showcasing some events prior to the Gundams activation, specifically in its third season."

Gundam,3cvj2t,The--Comet,3,Sat Jul 11 12:51:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest I rather have them reboot the UC timeline, make the Zeon stronger, not make them from losing in two months."
Gundam,3cvj2t,Yuukida,7,Sat Jul 11 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"The great thing about the UC timeline is that Zeon wasn't really the ""evil"" faction nor were the Federal Forces. You could argue from ideological standpoints that they both had ground to stand on. Laplace's box was a bit weird but that plays into it all too. A UC reboot would be nice.  Hathaway's Flash is always something I've been interested in seeing animated or Blue Destiny. They could also make an animated miniseries captivating the aces of the One Year War. Shin Matsunaga, Johnny Ridden, etc. Just called it Mobile Suit Gundam: Aces."

I love the characters and the mecha, and the animation is gorgeous, but I can't recommend it.    Victory is one of my favorites.  ""Out there"" is a decently good description, and it isn't perfect by any means, but I like it, and I like how dramatically the world has changed.    It's not animated, but Crossbone is also fantastic.  Mostly I just love the late-UC aesthetic, with the smaller, more agile suits, and enemies that take on a different tone than the traditional mono-eye suits you see a lot of in early-UC.

Going at it piece-by-piece the various conflicts and wars that take place feel natural and believable but if you take a step back and look at it as a whole UC can feel a little silly in that there are SO MANY massive wars happening in such a small amount of time.
Gundam,3cvj2t,arcangelxvi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:32:45 2015 UTC,"personally i tend to be more of a fan of the AU gundam series than i am of UC and i think that's largely because for me at least the original UC material has been really hard to get into the first gundam series is just so old and kind of hard to watch  i think what UC could benefit from the most (and the origin might ultimately be just this) is a remake of the original MS Gundam/0079, before expounding more into the UC timeline with either more side stories or even a continuation it would be nice to give newer gundam fans an easier entry into early UC to give everyone a core understanding and modern base for watching all of the classics that early UC fans all seem to really love like Zeta, 08th MS Team, etc without them having to go back and watch the original gundam to get that basic foundation  after that! then would be a good time to start adding to UC as i said earlier whether it's with new sidestories, expanding on UC elements like having an animated crossbone, continuing the UC timeline, etc i think this strategy would help bring more people into UC in general without it seeming like there's such a big entry barrier  heck that's part of what makes the AU series so much fun to watch, they're easy to enter into and can be watched in essentially any order"

Gundam,3cvw24,Awesom3xNinja,4,Sat Jul 11 05:25:36 2015 UTC,"There is no consensus.    The official word is that all timelines are connected, with Turn A being the endpoint. No, it is not a converging timeline, its just one line with no official order.     ""Black History"" in Turn A Gundam is the records of wars that were sealed away, but also has another meaning- That of the concept that all Gundam series shows, starting with Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979, exist in a single timeline. In other words,1979's Mobile Suit Gundam's UC marks the beginning of humanity's space age, and 1999's Turn A Gundam's CC is its final stage. The timelines broadcast up to that point, G's FC, Wing's AC, and X's AW, as well as 2002's Seed's CE, 2007's 00's AD, and 2011's Age's AG, and all other Gundam series to come are a part of black history as well (Gundam Build Fighters seems to be an exception). The gimmicks that made this possible are nanotechnology and black history. In real life, history is filled with numerous different perceptions and interpretations, and there are countless cases of fabrications gaining momentum and being treated as fact. In the end, it may be that people only believe what they want to believe.     http://pastebin.com/DPLgZy5Z    TL:DR Nanotechnology and bad records (EX. Similar to how mythology is based off true stories but exaggerated greatly)  What does this mean?    Nothing really, it ultimately just serves as a thematic tool for Turn A Gundam.

Season 1 actually has a focus on contradictions such as the supersoldier Allelujah specifically designed for war but refusing to kill or the atheistic Setsuna worshipping Gundam as God. Of course, Celestial Being's mission itself is a contradiction.  Later on, you'll see how Celestial Being declaring war on war ultimately works as a way of superficially ending conflict.

The first half just lays the foundation for the second half.  As for Saji....he gets better in the late first half/second half.

They are people doing a job, sometime it look good sometimes it involve atrocities, they know it, the world know it. They are basically terrorists with the upper hand technology wise.

Gundam,3ctppm,justanotherkerbal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really sold but finished the whole thing. There's a good feels moment or two, but a lot of really dumb shit goes down. The stakes are constantly being raised in ways that I found really insulting to my intelligence. Story decisions are forgivable but the decisions of the people writing the story were equally bad. After finishing the series and looking up whether the movie was a recap or new stuff, I found the premise of the movie really insulting to the ending of the show.  If you want to drop it, drop it. I watched it mostly because it was Gundam and I wouldn't ever really drop a Gundam series, all while hoping it would get better but it didn't really. At one point, I realized that there were scenes after the credits that I had been unintentionally skipping over, but I didn't care nearly enough to see what they might have been because it could be guessed from context, and when I started watching them for the remaining episodes, was just an awkwardly stilted method of setting up the next episode while pretending the previous episode had ended on a cliffhanger.  I don't think the characters are very well done characters, regardless of whether or not your metric for such is being able to identify with them. If you find them to be weak characters now, I don't think your opinion on them is going to improve. Most of what happens to them is pretty well telegraphed early in the series and never really shies away from predictability (unless it's a character death or utterly nonsensical decision)."
Gundam,3ctppm,justanotherkerbal,5,Fri Jul 10 19:42:13 2015 UTC,I found the premise of the movie really insulting to the ending of the show.   Really? I found that the entire show foreshadows what is going to happen in the movie.
Gundam,3ctppm,draivaden,-2,Fri Jul 10 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which undermines every single thing they've learned and means you just watched a 50 episodes series which built towards a conflict that plays out in a two hour long movie. They didn't learn to get along, they just learned that they had a different enemy and it was different from the last shared enemy they thought they had. Instead of ""progress and advance to kill our enemies the Union/Reform League /the AEU/Celestial Being/A-Laws"", it becomes ""we have to fight another faction we didn't really know about."" Which is like the plot and most of the twists of the show in the first place.  Let's imagine it this way: there are colonies which don't interact with anyone or anything central to the plot at all. We can call them Zeon since we're Gundam fans. We'll pretend they launched into space a while ago and were forgotten about and meanwhile survived perfectly fine and advanced and developed. The plot of the show is exactly the same. Everything happens the way it does. And then we get to the movie and suddenly Zeon says ""here we are!"" and they're suddenly the enemy.  Sure, you can't have any conflict if you continue with the resolution of the show but c'mon. It's the same thing as before.  Granted, I haven't actually seen the movie but it sounds like a lot like the conflict is the exact same thing as the show, just displaced to spoilers-faction. The show itself was already fairly repetitious with upgrades and ""now I'm actually more powerful!"" tropes and I don't imagine that you can come to a different resolution than that of the show without, again, undermining the resolution of the show."
Gundam,3ctppm,sdwoodchuck,4,Fri Jul 10 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually seen the movie   lol, really?  I guess that explains why you are missing the entire point of the movie, how it ties into the show and how the end of the show leads into the movie..."

You may have different tastes from the rest of the community and that's fine. But personally, I believe that one has to see/watch something to be able to criticise it. I understand that you think that watching more 00 content may be a waste of your time, but at least watch the movie so you can critique it to your best ability."
Gundam,3ctppm,justanotherkerbal,0,Sat Jul 11 16:07:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you're taking things out of context and making a nonsensical argument that's ignoring a lot of things I've said. My first comment said pretty explicitly ""my reaction to seeing the premise after finishing the series and looking up the movie's plot."" I have not passed any judgment on AGE but recognize that a lot of people have a poor opinion of it for a number of articulated reasons: I don't just say ""I dislike this because it's dumb"" and I don't put any stock in the opinions of people who don't back up those opinions with an articulation for why they feel that way (and, if you're following closely, I don't accept ""I couldn't identify with the characters"" as a criteria for whether characters are well done or not).  I've also seen a lot of spoilers for Trailblazer from various discussions here (the Qan[T] tends to come up in ""what gundam is most powerful"" discussions) and general discussions about plot that have had untagged movie spoilers or questions about why the ELS did X. It doesn't take a genius to piece together broad plot points from having seen the show and knowing the premise of the movie along with a few major plot points.  Let's not pretend that because I haven't watched the movie, I know nothing about it. The show ends with a sequel hook for the movie and clearly builds toward the conflict of the movie: the plot of the movie was clearly planned to  some degree at some point earlier in the development of the series considering the ""foreshadowing"" straight up says what's in the books for the movie's plot. There's no world in which that's a rewarding ending for a 52 episode show that I suffered through in the first place, and the person I watched the show with had the exact same reaction to hearing the premise of the movie.  It's incredibly disingenuous to just jump into a conversation with ""you don't know what you're talking about because you haven't seen the movie"" when I'm pointing to specific points which you're not really disputing in any actual way. I am not critiquing the movie. I am telling you that having seen the show, and knowing what I do about it, those are my thoughts. As I pointed out in my analogy, it wouldn't matter if the ELS were humans, the whole thing cheapens the plot of 00 not just because of repeated arcs and developments but by emphasizing how shallow it was in the first place."

I never wanted to start an arguement(in this comment thread at least), and I absolutely never wanted my comment to come across as arrogant/ignorant.   Anyways, let's start again. To be honest, I got a bit fired up by the comparison of 00 with AGE. But I agree with you that the movie made the main series' plot seem watered down. Personally, I think that adding an element as absurd as aliens into the 00 canon was a mistake.  Edit: since you haven't watched AGE yet(I'm suprised you haven't), personally the only part that seemed good was the Asemu arc."

I enjoy it, but definitely in a brain-turned-off kinda mode.  I found the plot enjoyable, but not most of the characters.  The whole using violence to deter war is complete hypocritical, but to the series' credit, the characters are very well aware of the fact, and the reasons to go for it despite that are at least there, even if not especially reasonable.    Saji and Louise become more involved in the direct plot later; I hated them as well when they were like this side plot that only factored in tangentially; I never grew to like them, but they at least feel like they belong later.

The Devil Gundam's minions in G Gundam are a good contender but that would be stretching the limit of what we consider a ""mass produced"" mobile suit a bit.  The Virgo II has equipped: a large beam canon capable of hitting and hurting a Gundanium armored MS, Planet Defensers capable of absorbing most ranged attacks, are equipped with external Vernier booster pods for exceptional maneuverability, and are networked to an AI assisted human intelligence (Dorothy Catalonia) via the Zero System."

Gundam,3cpoi3,MrSparkle86,3,Fri Jul 10 13:16:56 2015 UTC,"While I'm kind of disappointed that it adopted the usual Gundam color scheme repertoire, I can't say I didn't expect it. I'm liking the organic and rather unorthodox design of it: slim (practically nonexistent) waist that hints at unusual cockpit placement (think Turn A and Vagan mechs), pointed finger tips akin to, once again, Vagan mechs and G-Reco's Towasangan suits, and wires. Lots of wires. Like, Evangelion-level docking wires. Either it has a low power supply and operational time or it's hiding some sort of weapon of mass destruction.  But for the love of Jesus Yamato, does anyone else see a resemblance between this new suit and Legilis from AGE?"

Gundam,3cpoi3,gyagoda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"My bad, meant to say it has yellow vents similar to Legilis's. So any speculations as to what timeline this new series is going to take place in? I think it's safe to assume that it's not UC, but it's honestly anyone's game."
Gundam,3cpoi3,CidImmacula,0,Thu Jul 9 22:23:17 2015 UTC,Definitely has a UC vibe going on to me. Its the exposed tubing in the joints that screams UC.
Gundam,3cpoi3,gyagoda,3,Thu Jul 9 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Not gonna be UC. We already have an ongoing UC OVA and they don't want another UC TV series because it's too hard to attract new fans to. If it is UC, it'll be very late UC (or something that happens after UC, like G-Reco)"
Gundam,3cpoi3,Lostlance,3,Fri Jul 10 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"considering it's ""G""  I won't even be surprised if it would be before or after G-Reco.  The only other series with ""G"" in it is Gundam G iirc. And no unit there has ""G"" in its name (compared to, again, Reconguista. G-Self)."
Gundam,3cpoi3,sylpher250,2,Fri Jul 10 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's gonna be related to either. The design doesn't fit the aesthetic of either, plus G aired 20 years ago and G-Reco didn't sell too well from what I hear."

The MS designs and animation are amazing and I really like how it patches up the history before Zeta. Idk, to each his own. But to answer your question, if you don't like it already it probably won't get much better for you. Dubs or subs won't make a difference."

I consider it to be an alright series that needs some of the fat trimmed. Someone can speak to this better than I, but maybe you ought to watch the compilation film instead."
Gundam,3crjdh,GospelX,2,Fri Jul 10 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"0083 is...weird.  It's a series that had a writer change partway through, if I recall, and made a lot of plot worse as a result.  On the other hand, the significance of it, explaining just HOW exactly the Titans got away with all of this, it does well enough(in my opinion), although the plot in general isn't the best.  At the same time, it has some of my favorite units, like the GP-01, the Gerba Tetra, the Dendrobium...and I like the action scenes in 0083 as well.  It's definitely not the best UC product(That'd belong to Unicorn or 08th MS team in my opinion), and if you don't like it now, you probly won't like the rest of it...but I liked it."
Gundam,3crjdh,UFOLoche,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like it enough due to the fact that Gundams are cool, haha. I'll finish it out, looking forward to starting to see some of the new series, especially Unicorn and Char's Counterattack."

Gundam,3crjdh,The--Comet,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:06:18 2015 UTC,"No.  It is best near the start.  There are some dramatic moments ahead, but it gets overall worse, not better.  If you're not enjoying it already, you probably won't grow to enjoy it.  I didn't like it the first time I watched it, which was right after having watched 0080.  That created a bit of an unfair expectation for me.  0083 is dumb fun, but it is definitely dumb.  If dumb fun isn't what you're in the mood for, you probably won't dig it."

Gundam,3cqqry,catnipassian,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"Well the cool part is, most of the Gundam games on various PlayStation systems are actually fairly easy to get a hold of, and old enough to be fairly inexpensive.  The most recent (not best) Gundam game for PS3 is the The Best version of Extreme Vs. Full Boost, which just came out, and even that you can get on Amazon for about $40.  It's a fighting game, so it's not personally my favorite, but lots of folks love it (there's even a new subreddit).  As far as my personal favorites, I'm a Universal Century nerd, so I'm absolutely in love with Battlefield Record 0081.  Best way I can describe it is kind of an Ace Combat but for U.C. grunt suits.  Lots of suits to choose from, that you can modify to suit your style, though I should point out that we're only talking about suits from 0079 to roughly 0083.  Also the campaign is super short (but it's in Japanese, so maybe that's a blessing depending on your preference), and the meat and potatoes of the game is the free mission mode, and that's the most fun when playing online.  Unfortunately, the servers are usually pretty barren.  There's a few people on here who still play, though, myself included, and despite the lack of players, I personally consider it the best PS3 Gundam title.  Got my copy for about twenty bucks on Amazon.  Gundam Breaker 2 is a close runner up.  Suits from most of the different Gundam series, and you can mix and match parts between suits, and otherwise completely customize them to your liking.  The notion is that you're playing with virtual Gunpla, and the execution is pretty dang good.  I still haven't played this online, but I imagine it's a friggin' blast.  If you liked Build Fighters, or just like the idea of making a frankensuit, then go for GB2.  It's more recent, so it's more expensive, but no more so than any domestic games.  If you have a PSP, then the best options there are either Gundam Battle Universe (limited to pre-Unicorn U.C. suits) if you want an action game, or G Generation Overworld if you want a fun TRPG.  I would say the Gihren's Greed series are the best of the PSP Gundam games, but they're extremely deep, dense, punishing games.  Fantastic games, just takes a lot of work.  Unfortunately I have virtually no experience with PS2 or original PlayStation Gundam games, or Vita for that matter.  MS Saga for PS2 is pretty great, but quite cheesy, and you'll either love or hate the old-school JRPG style...it's also REALLY expensive for a physical copy, definitely a candidate for emulation.  And as far as PS4, there's only one game so far, and it's not quite out yet: Gundam Battle Operation NEXT.  Beta was a couple months ago...pretty fun.  It's faster and more arcade-style than the original Gundam Battle Operation, and still has some of the mildly irritating free-to-play quirks, like the energy system.  Still, has some potentially neat ideas, I look forward to seeing the changes they've made when it actually releases."

Gundam,3cqqry,Merkkin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:18:44 2015 UTC,"This may be a controversial answer, but back in the day one of my favorite PS2 games/RPGs of all time was MS Saga: A New Dawn. The art style is SD, the RPG mechanics themselves are really solid and the level of customization is intense! I loved taking my favorite mobile suit parts and combining them into an MS that looked badass, or just repainting my favorite Gundams. That being said, the story is hit or miss. Some people love it, some people find it really boring. Its not based on any existing Gundam franchise, but if you've ever seen a Gundam show in your life then very little about the plot will actually surprise you."
Gundam,3cqqry,rainbopython,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:26:04 2015 UTC,"Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam and Extreme Vs. Full Boost are my favorites.  GvZG is a single player mission based game that follows various pilots story lines from the original series through Zeta.  Good conyrols, nice graphics, great soundtrack.  I think there were even 'what if' missions where if you completed some secret objectives a pilots story would branch off into something original.  ExvFB is a 2 on 2 fighting game with online fighting.  There are single player missions to help train you, but the meat and potatoes I'd the online portion."

Gundam,3cpdu6,Etheril,5,Thu Jul 9 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Kshatriya. Probably biased by how good Unicorn's animation was, but Kshatriya always struck me as the absolute final stage of the Elmeth-Qubeley-Sazabi design family: A highly maneuverable, funnel-equipped unit capable of hitting quite hard from a range or fighting in close quarters. So, it gets a win for being a pinnacle of that particular design philosophy and bonus points for having a strikingly good-looking design and dominating every scene it was in.  Least favorite: Agguguy. Oh fucking hell, what is this thing even? It's got so much weirdness packed into it I can't even: Why does it have a giant insect eye? Why is the head shaped like a giant manta ray? How are those legs even supposed to work? Why is it literally a tentacle rape mobile suit? No. Just no.  Honorable mention (good): Hildofr. It's the unholy child of a Zaku and a self-propelled artillery piece. I don't even know if this thing counts as a mobile suit, but it's awesome."

Different designs for a different series, and it was just amazing all around. Nu Gundam Ver.Ka- the colors are just amazing, I got back into Gundam because i saw a facebook ad  for the MG. Psychoframe addition is a nice call to Unicorn IMO, but it still looks amazing without it.   Honorable mention: Gundam MK.II Titan Colors and Zeta.  also fucking Bearguy 1v1 me scrublord im ripped.   Least:    Not really fond of most SEED mechs, they just seem very impractical and like, i know Bandai cares about selling models, but they all looked like toys with little variations. Forbidden Gundam is probably the worst though.  Crossbone Full Cloth: I kindoff like the other Crossbone designs, but Full Cloth is just a bit too much for me Zeong for OP reasons Gundam Dendrobium- okay so. I absolutely LOVE Dendrobium Stamen's design, but the giant mobile-armor-esque thing is just overkill.  Deep Striker- I have a friend who loves it for all the wrong reasons. and to some extent so do I. Including it out of spite.

The design of those suits are ridiculous. Destiny flaws are everywhere, imagine losing it hands, bye bye Destiny, you are now a flying piece of junk. You want to use your palm cannon? Oh shit they are gone! About the Sword, The boomerang, the cannon? Oops, looks like you got no hands to use those. So much for versatility. Strike Freedom have a somewhat better design than the Destiny, it deserve the ""versatile"" title more than the Destiny, however the stupid gold frame, the side skirt that swivel backward to store the rifle, the dragoon wings,... The Infinite Justice maybe the suit with the best design in the whole SEED series, man how can they make it's sister unit so horrible."
Gundam,3cpdu6,Solitak,3,Fri Jul 10 01:42:39 2015 UTC,"My favorites would be:  Gundams -   Gundam Exia: It is so sleek, modern, and beautiful. 00 does it justice in both seasons as they really display how capable it is in combat and how it looks good as it moves. Everyone wants to become a Gundam like Setsuna with the Exia.  G-Self Perfect: There's no G-Reco love in this apparently, which is sad, because I love this Gundam. It's as close to a Star Trek Gundam in the franchise, with photon torpedoes, tractor beams, lasers, and all of the amazing things that come with the Perfect Pack. The design looks amazing in my opinion, as it is sleek, looks organic, and even looks alien compared to other Gundams.    Non Gundams -    Zudah: It's probably the most practical and awe-inspiring Zeon suit made in the OYW. It's sad that it has such major flaws in the story, because it would be a monster on the battlefield. I love when the mono-eye flashes while they're upside down. You know you're in deep trouble when you encounter a Zudah.  Overflag: I love this suit to death. It's fast, maneuverable, and looks menacing. Plus it was piloted by Graham Aker, do I need to ask more? Definitely a Mobile Suit that America would make if there were ever Mobile Suits.   Least Favorites:   Most G-Gundam suits: They're pretty impractical and look kinda silly when you think about it. With the exception of the Shuffle Alliance/Master Gundam/Devil Gundam, most of the designs look kinda dumb if you ask me. Destiny Gundam: Pretty boring if you ask me, plus the only really good moment that Destiny had was when Shimon used it against Sekai. That's it.    Honorable Mentions:    Strike Noir: It is definitely one of the best designs to come out of the Cosmic Era. It is black, threatening, aggressive, and powerful, even from the design alone. The dual swords, knives, and beam pistols don't hurt it either."

Gundam,3cpdu6,BluJacket,2,Thu Jul 9 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"Ok for real.   Most: Zaku II. I can't help it. I love all the variants, (Thunderbolt is siiiiiiiick) and Gouf overtook the simple Zaku for a bit, but I always return to the Zaku II. Sieg Zeon!  Least: That's a hard one. There's quite a few ""elite"" Zeon or Zeon descendent suits I don't like much. Never cared for Hyaku Shiki much.  My least favorite though is probably the Dom/Rick Dom. Something about it always bugs me. He looks like a fat man jammed into Samurai armor, and the giant thruster legs look terrible. I always avoid Doms in any game I play."
Gundam,3cpdu6,AkiZayoi,2,Thu Jul 9 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"I really don't care for the original DOM, but the Rick Dom looks okay imo."
Gundam,3cpdu6,ConchobarMacNess,2,Thu Jul 9 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"My favorite would probably be the Kampfer. I like the look, the speed, and the cool shotguns. That and it's short running time of wrecking Scarlet Team solo! War in the Pocket was not kind to Feddies.  As for least favorite? I guess my least favorite atm is probably the Zock. I'm still watching First Gundam so maybe it'll grow on me, but I'm not a fan of the look all that much. I like most of the amphibious suits other than the Zock."
Gundam,3cpdu6,mintyrobo,2,Thu Jul 9 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"Favorite Exia, least favorite Turn A. I love most of the 00 suits actually, but sadly dislike all Turn A one except the Turn X."

Least Favorite: Calamity Gundam. This thing is just a train wreck of a design. It looks overly top heavy. The colors are just gaudy. Raider and Forbidden in general look horrible, but Calamity is the worst out of the three."
Gundam,3cpdu6,Braddigan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"FAVORITE:  GM Quel!  The final mass-production version of the venerable RGM-79, and the base of the TR-1 series Gundams.  Hands down my favorite MS, but maybe I'm just a sucker for that Titans blue.  :D  LEAST:  Probably Agguguy?  I've come to appreciate most of the ridiculous looking amphibious suits, but the Agguguy still just looks like a low-budget 1950s movie monster to me.  The claws on the MSV don't help, either, it just makes it look like a space monster instead of a sea monster.  Don't get me wrong, I'm okay with that whole aesthetic, but not for a mobile suit."
Gundam,3cpdu6,Axillion24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"Favourites are Wing Zero Custom AND/OR Wing Gundam EW Ver. I hate how the Zeta looks, so I guess that's my least favourite."
Gundam,3cpdu6,Char_X_3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:31:17 2015 UTC,Favorite: Gundam Leopard.  Nothing like proper mobility in a heavy weaponry unit.  Episode 3 where it lobs grenades into the enemy bridge is one of my favorite memories.  That final fight against the Gabul is also a great scene.  Least Favorite: NRX-007 Correl.  The mobile suit that sacrificed so much armor for speed you wouldn't need a mobile suit to destroy it.  If I remember correctly a small explosion it caused almost knocks the pilot out and it gets shredded to pieces by vulcan fire.
Gundam,3cpdu6,Kyo220,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:37:30 2015 UTC,Favorite: Hygogg  Least favorite: Destiny Gundam
Gundam,3cpdu6,jajangmien,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:54:18 2015 UTC,Favorite: Destiny Gundam. It's a guilty pleasure. First RG I built and my favorite suit to use in DWG.  Least: Enact. Ripoff of a better MS.
Gundam,3cpdu6,Lunatic350,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:16:15 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Strike Gundam. Liked the concept of Striker packs, and I absolutely love the design.   Least: Silver Bullet. It's basically a Döven Wolf with a either a Gundam or GM head, which IMO doesn't fit with the bulky body."

Gundam,3cpdu6,DarkMime77,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Double X.  Least Favorite: Zaku Tank. I mean, WHY does it exist? in an effort to copy the guntank? which is shown to suck really bad? and it doesn't even have heavy cannons! how could you even convince a someone to pilot such a galactic scale piece of crap?"
Gundam,3cpdu6,justanotherkerbal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:34:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can't pick a favorite. It's more like ""LOOK AT THAT COOL SHIT WOW.""  I could say the least favorite is the Strike Freedom or the Deathscythe but that's just because I hate their pilots. I don't see how you can hate the mecha themselves."
Gundam,3cpdu6,cactusfag,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"Favorite? Hard choice, but I think I might actually put the Zeong up there (not just to spite you, I swear!). Sure its cheesy, and a bit silly, but I think think it looks kinda badass, even menacing in an alien-like way, kinda encapsulates everything about the original Mobile Suit Gundam I love!  Least favorite? The Strike, it looks so, generic. It doesn't bring anything new to the table (much like Seed itself~), and it looks like what you'd get if you asked a random anime fan who had only passing glances of the series to draw 'a Gundam'. Eugh I don't know, I really love the Freedom/Strike Freedom, and the Astray, but the Strike and Force Impulse are just bland, I don't even have gunpla of them, I feel like they'd blend right in among all my other leads! At least the Strike Freedom has those glorious golden wings, seriously, I dislike Seed/Destiny, but that's close to my #1 design, the RG of it is absolutely gorgeous, and if it wasn't $Texas, I'd probably have gotten the PG of it by now."
Gundam,3cpdu6,curiositie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:00:19 2015 UTC,"Favorite: It's between the Exia and the Jesta. I used to not get the point of mobile suits that use melee weapons as their primary weapon, but Exia changed my mind about that. There's something about that sleek shape and the way Setsuna pilots it that just screams ""awesome"". As for the Jesta, a MS being specifically designed to escort the Unicron has to be a good one. Speed that allows it to keep up with the Unicorn? Check. Performance is way beyond any normal EFSF grunt suit? Check. Badass spec-ops color scheme? Check.   Least favorite: I don't have a MS that I absolutely hate(mobile fighters in G-Gundam are too absurd to dislike), but I have the most issues with the Destiny gundam. This pretty much explains everything.  Edit: Have to credit /u/WackyModder84 for his thorough analysis of the Destiny gundam."
Gundam,3cpdu6,Captain-Rex,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:43:24 2015 UTC,Prob the Gouf Custom from 08MS..  Favorite gundam is the psycho mk I   Worst: most/all SEED suits. I like how UC tries to do at least some design realism but these suits just have random shit that in no way contributes to performance. G is an exception because it's glorious
Gundam,3cpdu6,TRB1783,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"Favorite:   Im not sure, there's so many i like. Strike without any of the backpacks. Bare strike is best strike. Also, Wing Zero.

Gundam,3cpdu6,MrPaperMonster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"Favorite: the Sazabi. It's big, it's red, it's got funnels, and looks like the child of every successful Zeon design. It is hyperleathal without committing the sin of excess, like a lot of the suits from UNICORN do.   Least: Turn-A. I just can't take its big Kaiser Wilhelm mustache seriously."
Gundam,3cpdu6,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:33:32 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Xi or Hyzenthlay.  least favorite: Astray Mirage Frame. super edgy look to it, and there are way too many Astray Variations."

Gundam,3cpdu6,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:52:39 2015 UTC,"Favorite:  Rick Dias (Red).  My favorite aspects of Zeon suit fundamentals mixed with the Zeta design philosophy.  It helps that its initial appearance at the beginning of Zeta is this perfect introduction to the series, echoing the beginning of the original MSG (mono-eyed suits sneaking into a colony to collect info on a new Gundam prototype) in exactly the right way to perform the plot turn of the unexpected pilot joining the invaders rather than fighting them.  I just love this damn thing.    Least favorite:  Neo Zeong.  I'm probably going to get shit for this, but I just don't like it.  I don't like a lot of the Mobile Armor designs, but this one seems especially bland in the way it tries too hard to be slick, while at the same time leaning too heavily on old designs.  Just not my type at all.    Honorable best/worst mentions:  Crossbone X1/Full Cloth.  The X1 may be my favorite Gundam design.  It is the perfect mix of silly and intimidating, and it just strikes me as one of the most fun designs in the series.  Full Cloth, on the other hand, completely wrecks it.  It takes that excellent design, and just layers a bunch of armor plates over it, looking so bland and uninspired in the process.  No thanks."
Gundam,3cpdu6,Octinomos,2,Thu Jul 9 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"Full Cloth isn't only an armor plate it's protection without taking out the maneuverability of the X1,  good thing is it makes the X1 looks like a pirate wearing a captain clock."
Gundam,3cpdu6,justanotherkerbal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"I know what it is, functionally.  I'm talking aesthetics.  And aesthetically, it's super bland.  None of the definition of the base X1 design.  And while it may be designed to look like it's a pirate cloak, it doesn't really succeed in that regard."

Gundam,3crvva,NageQsad,3,Fri Jul 10 07:22:47 2015 UTC,"Well i needs to clear things out a bit since i am getting yelled at by people thinks i only thinks of only girls and other shit. I'm 18, i'm not very good or an excellent student but at least i' from a top 10 school in my country, a third world country that can be wiped out anytime from the map just because there are some nations keep on provoking us. I have learned my ass off so i could get to that highschool, for 2 years i have focused on getting to that highschool. Now after getting to that school i have to struggle to get that scholarship among of a class full of excelent students, the kind of students that get a 9.9/10 GPA with 8.5-9 IELTS and i am not kidding, that kind of students in my school are not rare at all(My scholarship is an English based scholarship so i will study by English and also learn Japanese, neither of them are my native language) i have learned for 12 years in an education system that every one keeps saying it sucks. Living a life with people say i will never get to the school i am learning at, being said that i live a very great life since my family have a lot of money but me and my mother departed from that maily and live independently. 2 years ago i found out about that schollarship as well as gunpla. I love gundams and gunplas, they are the hobby that i love, and also i work online so it could support my hobby. While i am doing model kits, my friends are going to bars, getting drunk or getting wasted which they keep teasing me for why I don't do those kind of things. I have prepar everything so i could get ready when i get to Japan, i have prepare my studies, i have prepare my accommodation, i also got information about jobs there and i have caculated the amount of mmoney i need and the amount of money i could make. And i thought that when i get there have gone to a place i really like because of my hobby so i ask people i lnow about it there, on a forum full of nice and kind people that have supported me alot since the very beginning when i first join. Now i dont know why i got bashed by the people that i trust on a forum that i loved. Yes I do watch anime, most of them are gundam shows, i am not the kind of person that only thinks about Japan girls or come to Japan because of ""Mangad and anime and girls"". No, its a place that i could go to, coincidentally it is the birthplace of my hobby so i ask question about it, aslo asking about the life there in case there are something i do not know. Yeah dicking around, yeah bloww it all on bull shit. Do you know what kind of Scholarship i have? No its not that kind of normal scholarship that gives you money so you could pay for your tuition, no. Its the kind that reduce the amount of money you have to pay for your tuition. So every penny i use there is my money plus the money i will work for. So no, i don't have to prove that i am useful becaus i don't think you or the people who thinks like you could ever do thins like i did. Thanks for reading."

Just watching him develop into the worst shit stain ever was seriously rage inducing. It can probably be argued that's part of what makes him an interesting character, but damn did he rustle my jimmies.  edit: added a ""would"" to my first sentence."
Gundam,3cp638,HamEaterQC,3,Thu Jul 9 20:17:18 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point.  And it might say something that I wouldn't mind re-watching 0083, but I've already re-watched Destiny hoping that I could find some redeeming qualities. And I liked Shinn Asuka even less of a charater the second time around. Shinn's pretty annoying. Actually he might be the most annoying. If Kou can be the worst.  Clearly, I need to re-watch all of the Gundam series to form a more consistent opinion."
Gundam,3cp638,mintyrobo,2,Thu Jul 9 21:05:41 2015 UTC,But Shinn isn't even a protagonist at the halfway point because of Kira's return to the spotlight. He turns as the antagonist.
Gundam,3cp638,justanotherkerbal,3,Fri Jul 10 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"Just because it was a bait and switch, I don't think that nullifies his  Gundam protag status outright considering the time the show forces the audience to watch his character development. He's clearly the protag for the first half of Destiny, and then becomes antagonist.  If I may strawman argument here, just because Anakin becomes Darth Vader, that doesn't make him not be the protagonist of Attack of the Clones. Yes, he turns into a dick later, and turns into an antagonist, but it doesn't nullify that he was also a protag earlier."

Relena Peacecraft is naive and annoying, even if she means well. It's unfortunate that she had her pacifist views in such an extreme. Kira suffered from this to a degree as well. Still.

Wouldn't it be much more interesting if Kio and Flit ended up on separate sides, having to decide on whether peace or war was the better answer? Throw Asemu in the middle, unable to decide if he wants to join his father, or his son, and boom, you have a finale with actual tension, an actual reason to involve all three generations, and what could be a horribly depressing ending (Kio having to kill Flit to save the Vagans could have been Zeta-tier depressing).  I don't know, I just really wanted this series to do better than it did, when I heard about a Gundam series following a family as it lives through a war, I expected a lot more than we got, at least in the ending, I loved the first two arcs!"

Regardless; out of the many Gundam series, Wing is definitely not the one where you could be looking for realistic behavior of most of the weapons deployed. The majority of weapons in Wing are just the established Gundam universe weapons in new forms: automatic cannons, ""beam"" weapons, beam sabers, and heat blades."

In addition to the Heavyarms, there's the Tallgeese's dobergun (which fires shells or beams, depending on the episode), Leos' beam rifles (which fire the same yellow shots at a high fire rate as the machine gun), Sandrock's ""beam machine gun"" (which fires...yellow shots), etc. Gundam X, having a similar animation style, runs into the same problems."

Gundam,3ck4zu,chrysamere,20,Wed Jul 8 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"1.) The GP series were all prototypes constructed just to see if the Federation (while paying Anaheim of course) could. They were meant as more of a marking point as to how far mobile suit technology had advanced, and were later shelved by the Titans after the projects synonymous attachment to the Delaz Fleet incident.  2.) The Gundam Mk. II at the time of its abduction was an easier to produce and maintain Gundam than the GP series with their individual specifications. The primary weaknesses of the Mk. II are the fact that the armor on the mobile frame is the same as the GM II (a temporary measure), since they were still going through the testing phase at the time they were stolen.   3.) The love triangle between Gato, Nina, and Kou was shoehorned in half way through production by the writer/director. It makes no sense plot wise, and makes no sense that the Titans are so desperate to put everything about Stardust behind them that they let everyone involved just roam free.  4.) Gato represents the cusp of Zeon hypocrisy about the honorable-soldier image. That's the whole point about him, and the majority of the fan-base that tends to blindly side with Zeon.  5.) The fates of Uraki and Keith are unknown, I believe. However, Captain Synapse is tried for treason after assisting in stealing the GP03, and is ultimately executed for it. (It's mentioned somewhere in the after notes of the Stardust Memories series laser disc. release.)  So...

Gundam,3ck4zu,johnzaku,16,Wed Jul 8 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"What was the point in cancelling/covering up the GP0 project    The federation was continuing to make gundams after the signing of peace accords with the newly reinstated Republic of Zeon. Even more damning is the creation of a gundam armed with nuclear weapons. This would violate the Antarctic Treaty banning the use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as well as colony drops which were responsible for wiping out a good portion of humanity in the initial months of the One Year War. If this information ever got out, it would throw gasoline on the fire of pro-Zeon sentiment throughout the colonies and probably cause another civil war.   Also, Gundam MkII seems inferior    The Gundam MKII was far more advanced than the GP series due primarily to advances in electronics, movable frame technology, 360 degree cockpits, etc. The GP series looks better on screen due to the higher animation budget.   Nina Purpleton   Staff changes halfway through the creation of the show killed her character.   He nukes thousands of soldiers!    Using a weapon that was meant to be used on his own soldiers. At that point the Federation had blatantly violated the Antarctic Treaty. The Delaz Fleet was sending the message that they were willing to honor the treaties in place, but now nukes and colony drops are fair game and the Federation brought it upon themselves.   he KNOWINGLY performs a colony drop on Earth's primary FOOD SOURCE. THAT is an attack on civilians.   Not directly. By throwing Earth into famine, the Federation is faced with a choice: become an economic slave to the colonies or let the people of Earth starve. Delaz knew the fat cats running the Federation would readily choose the latter option while trying to use military might to force the colonies into making up for deficit resources. People on Earth would be barely scraping by and people in the colonies would be further subjugated to the Federation. This would turn public sentiment across the earthsphere against the federation government, and Zeon could rise again as the gallant saviors of the people.  At least that was the plan. As we know, the Federation used the colony drop as an excuse to form the Titans and commit atrocities against the colonies under the guise of purging Zeon remnants. At the end of Stardust Memory, everyone loses hard except for Bask Om.   Why doesn't Kou Uraki, Chuck Keith, or Captain Synapse join Karaba or AEUG? What becomes of GP03?    I believe, according to printed material, that Synapse is set up as a fall guy and executed. The GP03 is probably scuttled and its battle data studied secretly. Those that don't join the Titans kind of just fall off the radar and presumably live peaceful lives. Most who joined the Titans are killed throughout the events of Zeta Gundam."
Gundam,3ck4zu,burkmcbork,6,Wed Jul 8 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was an odd piece of story. As far as the gundam mk. 2 issue, I can only assume that the GP models were high powered prototypes. So they were made with a budget be damned kinda mindset. The Gundam mk.2 were made to be mass produced I believe for the Titans, still high powered machines but with more tried and true systems then with high end systems. Though GP three was the only Gundam of the project to survive and it had a panoramic cockpit, 4 years later that shit was everywhere.  Nina..... Yeah, they should have left the love triangle out or had that fleshed out back in the screenplay development. If I remember the director added that in half way through production.

All of the Zeon movements took idea and developed them in different directions. Gato and Delaz followed the corruption of Deikun's thought that Gihren embraced and proselytized, namely that spacenoids were a new and superior people, with the Principality of Zeon as their center. The successful raid of the naval review and the colony drop were movements in line with that philosophy, as its goal was to eliminate the Earth Federation, force the Earthnoids out of the equation, and forcibly liberate Zeon.  Even Char, Deikun's heir, embraced the idea that the Earthnoids were bound by gravity and thereby hampering the evolution of humanity, and launched a wave of colony drops to force them off the Earth."

Because the whole project is an embarassment to the Federation, in particular, GP02 and the nuke.   Also, Gundam MkII seems inferior to GP01 Full Vernier by almost every measurement, and that's without even looking at the capabilities of GP02 and GP03. Is it?   As someone said, they're super prototypes while the MkII is an intended mass production variant.   Nina Purpleton. I know everyone hates her, but, come on.. REALLY NINA? Because you had an affair with him for a year or two, it's OK that he killed MILLIONS OF PEOPLE??   Yeah, I got nothing. Fuck Nina.   Why do people like him so much?   I think most people do recognize that his actions are vile and that he is nothing more than a zealot. Doesn't mean he isn't an enjoyable character to watch.   Why doesn't Kou Uraki, Chuck Keith, or Captain Synapse join Karaba or AEUG?   Synapse took the blame was sentenced to death for disobeying orders, the theft of GP03 (and I believe a few guards were kiiled by the Albion crew too?). Or he commited suicide. I've seen both the 'executed' and 'suicide' explanations and I'm not sure which it is. Kou was arrested for the disobeying orders (I think?) but because the GP project was covered up (as it was an embarassment) and hence they had nothing to charge him with (that's how I see it). Chuck, I don't know. This does present the dilema of why Synapse was sentenced to death but Kou was let off but being a superior officer, he probably took most of the blame and Kou got off lightly.   What becomes of GP03?   It was destroyed, wasn't it? And development of mobile suits shifted to newtype based suits which are likely much better. The GP03 went out for combat once and quickly needed resupplying."

As a political message to show the people of Earth that the Federation can't guard their food, let alone them... I'm pretty sure the capabilities of the Gundams is of minor concern compared to that. As for covering up the GP project, it's likely got something to do with how they let a nuclear weapon get stolen and then blow up half their own fleet. Kind of... not something you want as a thing, going forward. Gundam Mk II was designed pretty much as a copy of the original Gundam with a few 'modern' upgrades to it.

Gundam,3ck4zu,rms141,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:22:41 2015 UTC,"What was the point in cancelling/covering up the GP0 project if they were just going to make Gundam MkII? Also, Gundam MkII seems inferior to GP01 Full Vernier by almost every measurement, and that's without even looking at the capabilities of GP02 and GP03. Is it?   The Gundam mk.II is not a descendant of the GP series. It's a descendant of the RX-78-2 (original explanation)/Hazel line (retcon explanation). The point of canceling the GP series is to cover up Operation Stardust and everything related to it. The fact that a colony drop even occurred was covered up and deleted from historical record.  The Gundam mk.II is indeed inferior to the GP01Fb both statistically and practically. However, the mk.II is inferior to a lot of mobile suits, and is arguably even inferior to the Hazel line that preceded it. The mk.II was built as a test for the movable frame, period. It was never intended to see combat. When it did, its one advantage was that its relatively light weight made it more maneuverable and agile than the semi-monocoque frames used in mobile suit design up until that point. This advantage quickly fades, and by the time of Zeta's Hong Kong arc, the mk.II's deficiencies are fully on display.  By the way, the GP series' statistical advantage is just that, statistical. The GP line wasn't actually technologically advanced beyond the Zeta era level. Anaheim just slapped on more verniers and thrusters and called it a day."
Gundam,3ck4zu,rms141,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:32:12 2015 UTC,"The simplest answer is that 0083 doesn't take its own plot or place in the universe very seriously.  The plot is largely nonsense, the effects outside of its self-contained episodes are similarly implausible, the characters don't behave in logical ways, the politics and mechanics don't fit the timeline.    It's an attempt to be a more simple, fun, action story.  How well it succeeds at that is debatable, but I'll readily admit I like it more now than I did the first time I saw it, when the nonsense really did bother me because I wasn't expecting it.  If you just let it be its own kind of silly and enjoy what it does well, you'll probably have a higher opinion of it."
Gundam,3ck4zu,sdwoodchuck,-1,Thu Jul 9 03:05:28 2015 UTC,It's a weird story for sure. But overall 0083 is an insignificant part of UC history. Did you know for a while those GP0 gundams were not canon? So yeah don't think too much about 0083.

Gundam,3cki24,101rsmith,34,Wed Jul 8 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"It's one of the most influential anime in the 2000s, a massively successful commercial product. Original SEED brought a lot of people into the Gundam series, especially teens. Sunrise made it specifically to draw in younger and female crowd, a goal they've definitely reached. I personally know many people who started watching anime because of SEED.   Hardcore Gundam fans dislike it because it's basically a trendy drama with gundam skin. IMO it's decent and definitely not the worst Gundam show.  Destiny is pretty shitty though."
Gundam,3cki24,wumao4life,5,Wed Jul 8 17:17:22 2015 UTC,SEED is what brought me to the Gundam franchise when it aired a couple of years ago. I now prefer UC but it will always have a place of recognition with me.

Much like what AGE (ugh) tried to do, that piece of shit is leagues worse than SEED. Where it fell flat was where OP mentioned, the plot holes, cast of characters, etc.   Destiny could've been incredible if they didn't replace Shinn with Kira halfway through. Shinn made the most sense out of the entire SEED cast quite frankly."

Gundam,3cki24,KaziArmada,2,Wed Jul 8 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"I'd still put AGE above Seed, I watched every series in release order last summer and it put a new spin on those I had already seen. Seed is a good anime, I won't argue that, but I think its the most generic, and boring Gundam series. I feel like I'm the only one who sees Seed's designs as lazy and uninspired (the Strike literally looks like what you'd get if you asked a random artist with passing knowledge of the series to draw a Gundam, and don't even get me started on the copy pasted Zakus and Doms.)  The AGE-1, 2, 3, and FX were all clearly based on the 78-2, Zeta, ZZ, and Nu, and they were all unique takes on it, that and I really dislike the overall look of Seed & Destiny's animation (yes, even the HD remaster).   Maybe it's just me, but at least AGE had a really good opening half, with a unique concept of 3 generations of protagonist, I feel Seed brought nothing new to the table. It's funny cause when I first saw it, I loved it, it was in my top five series, but comparing it to the others, it just doesn't hold up too well compared to the rest of the series in my opinion."

The most disappointing is definitely the crybaby cast and every time Flay Allster did something stupid (which is pretty much all the time), it turned me off further.  Destiny was absolute utter crap though. It could've been good if they'd let Kira die and have Shinn become a relatable character from that point on.

Kira has to get out of the soon to explode bomb he was sitting in and get so far away that the powerful explosion, enough to melt the impulse through its PS armor, would not out right kill him. Let's just say whether it was stabbed in the cockpit is the least of Kira's worries. It is a huge plot hole nuclear explosion or not, and it's not even Destiny's biggest plot hole."
Gundam,3cki24,BoyGodz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:49:07 2015 UTC,"Nuclear reactor meltdown =/= nuclear bomb. That's all I'm saying. A reactor doesn't explode like a bomb like how fans typically imagine it. ANd as you see in the next episode, the Freedom wasn't blown to bits anyway. Because that's not how a reactor works. They'd have to worry about the nuclear radiation more than an explosion but UC gets away with this all the time so I guess double standards?. As for the Impulse, it suffered damage yes, but it was quite intact, all things considered. The largest damage was its missing head, which was the result of the Freedom's Beam saber being right up in the Impulse's face right when it was stabbed, as shown here. It's PS armour was destroyed and its extremeties were gone too but the damage wasn't anwhere close enough to kill Shinn because once again, nuclear reactors don't explode like nuclear bombs."
Gundam,3cki24,RJWalker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"Even if the blast wasn't from a nuclear explosion, an explosion of this size would have killed off anything close(Impulse) or in the epicenter(Freedom) of it."

Lost an arm, wings all messed up, armor all destroyed, knees and arms all deformed and burnt. And freedom is just in pieces floating on the sea. Would any sane person with any logical sense within them think an explosion of this level not kill a person that is not even in armor? Yes, that's Fukuda.  Nuclear or not is not the issue. The fact that the explosion damaged PS armor at all means it is definitely enough to kill a person, not to mention the person is sitting in the middle of the explosion itself.  And before you say the cockpit protects him or any bullcrap like that. The cockpit is NOT some metal box that would keep the pilot safe, if anything they would blow just as much/ more than the rest of MS itself, and the MS is blown to bloody pieces."

The suit is quite intact, all things considered. Clearly survivable.  Once again, the Freedom wasn't blown to bits as the next episode shows.The cockpit did survive. As it should have. Because nuclear reactors don't explode like that. The explosion shown at the end of the episode is the real error here as the suit wouldn't explode like that anyway because nuclear reactors don't explode like nuclear bombs. The huge fireball explosion is the mistake in physics here, not anything else."
Gundam,3cki24,RJWalker,2,Thu Jul 9 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"Survivable is still far from intact, isn't it? Badly damaged is how I would put it.  Not sure why you would think its a nuclear explosion. Kira turned off the neutron jammer canceller before the explosion, the nuclear reaction should have been stopped right at that moment anyway. Whether or not the huge ass explosion is nuclear doesn't matter, it looks exaggerated, sure, but even when the episode was first airing, people have explained why it wouldn't be a nuclear already. The problem is that Kira survived without even escaping from Freedom, anyone else would not have survive a stab directly underneath the cockpit, that's why people call out the plot armor/plot hole."

Also, early ZAFT Mobile Suits (GINN, CGUE, BuCUE, DINN, etc) are still among my favorite non-Gundams.

The  best evidence of this was in the final fight between Shin and Athrun in destiny when Justice rips through Destiny's anti-ship sword in half through the beam.  I found this out from watching u/wackymodder84's video here (for context he was talking about destiny's Arondight design flaws) where he gives a detail explanation about how different beams work from UC CE and AD eras and why beam sabers never cross each other in CE.

For all the flak that is takes for rehashing the basic plot sequence of 0079, it adds to 0079 by bringing in the whole friends on opposite sides of war element to it, which was really very very well done.  Also, despite the fact that Dearka switching sides was a business-motivated decision forced by Bandai, it was well executed and meshed very well into the overall themes of the story."

The mecha designs and the music are incredible, and in fact i believe the music in Destiny has helped set the bar in terms of Gundam music in the future.  And besides, as a hardcore Zeon fan, it is nice to see another Universes incarnation of Zeon depart from the facist cult of personality that seemed to personify Zeon for so long. Zaft was what an ideal Zeon was always supposed to be, a fight for freedom against a government that had grown too large and ruled for too long, a group of brave revolutionaries who had their dreams and future co-opted and stolen by monsters like Patrick Zala or the Zabis.  Sieg Zeon! Sieg ZAFT!"
Gundam,3cki24,Farfener,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:55:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, dude. There are thousands of SEED Fans out there who are like that. More so than there are who aren't like that, to be exact.  Not every Gundam SEED Fan out there is a Blind and Bigoted Fanboy. Granted, there are a lot more than there should be of them, but not all of them are. They stilll only take up about 10...maybe 15 Percent at max, of the Gundam SEED Fanbase. That's a very small handful right there compared to the larger majority.  Quite a lot of people I know acknowledge SEED's flaws, hell, even Destiny's flaws as well, and accept them for what they are, and enjoy both series, regardless.  People like that are the ones who should be given the most respect of all. Because they don't try to make excuses or deny the plainly obvious flaws. They accept them, and enjoy it for what it is. And it takes a lot to do that with certain anime series."

Gundam,3cki24,jajangmien,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"Gundam SEED was a good series and really it ended on quite a high note (which is also part of what i don't like about Destiny, but moving on), Kira and Athrun both have decent to good character arcs. A lot of the cast are fairly likable, the story was interesting, and to be honest the MS designs are great (especially Freedom and Justice!), the music was great too!  There is really a lot to be liked about and enjoyed in SEED despite its faults, sure i wished for a majority of the series that someone would just shoot that red head in the face (not Lacus Clyne the other girl like really red head girl, i forget her name) and wanted to slap Kira just about every time he overly angsted.  SEED for me could be even be claimed as the series that got me either into or back into Gundam, as for my Gundam fandom it is pretty much like:   Gundam Wing Endless Waltz: watched it constantly and love it to death but never watched the original series (didn't have cable) only the movie Gundam SEED: got me to watch Gundam again and i pretty much loved it at least until watching Destiny Gundam 00: solidified my love of Gundam, such an awesome, awesome series! Gundam AGE: actually really liked it despite not very popular Gundam Build Fighters: got me into building gunpla! :D"

Gundam,3cki24,picflute,0,Thu Jul 9 01:47:22 2015 UTC,I think seed was great I really loved it and it had some great characters and the mechs were cool. Destiny ducked because they took away everyone's character except Athrun. Also they ruined Athrun and Cagalli and made Shinn an ass. However Destiny was worth watching just to see Shinn get wrecked.

It's not coincidence that there hasn't been a UC TV series since Victory (which itself is only vaguely tied to it) -- they want to draw new viewers into the franchise to keep it going, and having a complicated and lengthy continuity that you have to get into before you can watch is off-putting. They save UC stuff for OVAs for the more hardcore fans."

That death is very bittersweet, especially with that horrible event to his fiancee. He manages to stay loyal to his home until the end and treated the Diva as his and Remy's daughter  0080: Bernie  The worst thing about it is that he died as a regular grunt soldier; a mere pawn whom didn't affect much of this war and will be unremembered after the war. That fact that Chris didn't know that she killed him is a cruel reminder that the people that soldiers kill are not soulless enemies; they have their own dreams and ambitions"

That was an emotional punch to the gut mostly because I wasn't expecting anyone to die, especially not like that...   In 0079, while there were some tear jerkers as well Lalah's  was ruined because I watched the after-episode teasers of 'See what happens next!' and they flat out ruined that one.

She's been the single most admirable character from the start of the series until that moment, always doing what she feels is right without complaint.  She isn't the idealist, she isn't the tactician, she isn't the rebellious youth trying to change the world; she just decides where she stands, and she takes action.  She is the quintessential soldier, and does not shy away from dying in her duty.  And then in the end, she's laid to rest in a ship adrift on the battlefield, and consumed by the colony laser as its fired on the Titans.  She gets her Viking Funeral."

Everyone compliments them on how much of an awesome couple they are. Then Kira leaves them a wreck and trades it in for a newer, better model. Strike rebounded to Mu, but as for the Freedom... They were together for two years and just look how the asshole left her.  Someday, the Strike Freedom will suffer this fate as it's either destroyed or handed off to one of Kira's friends, all while the show goes on and on about how awesome Kira and his new MS are.  Thats, thats got to hurt. At least the Impulse got together with Lunamaria after Shinn left her."

If we get a Gundam series with VVVesque mech designs I will be so incredibly psyched, but so far I'm absolutely adoring the general design direction (hella angular, odder proportions, and by god that whole menacing dark silhouette with wires hanging off Evangelionish shtick is making me very happy).  I kind of hope the waist stays like that, would be cool to have a Gundam with some exposed innards (maybe it would look more like the prototype it's probably going to be that way).

Gundam,3cintv,crazyjeffy,13,Wed Jul 8 05:17:26 2015 UTC,"I don't agree on your criteria for ""insufferable.""  That implies a character is actively annoying, not just underdeveloped.  And in some of those cases (Sayla in particular), I don't even agree that they're underdeveloped.  But yes, there are a lot of underdeveloped characters in Gundam.  Part of that is due to Tomino writing his characters as icons for certain behavioral quirks rather than as more realistic people.  His characters are closer to greek drama (where characters have a narrow focus and their motivation drives entirely from that) than to, say, Shakespearean drama, where there is more complex, conflicting ideas and subtexts.  Frankly, the latter wouldn't work with the size of his casts, so you have characters who are mostly icons (Bright is benevolent authority, Char is self-righteous fury, Lalah is protector motivator, Kai is bravery-overpowering-cowardice, etc.), and more protagonist sorts who shift in their placement, but still are icons.  Amuro begins as reluctant protector (he must pilot the Gundam to protect the White Base because he's the only one who can), and shifts into an ego-driven protector (I have to do this to prove that nobody can pilot the Gundam better than I can), and finally a righteous protector (""I need to do what I can to end this war,"" and eventually ""I need to stop this asteroid from hitting the Earth, no matter the personal cost"").  Kamille similarly progresses from wrathful avenger, to reluctant aggressor, to an almost messianic destroyer.  But neither Kamille nor Amuro are terribly complex characters, they're just icons that we see long enough to watch them shift into new characteristics."

I guess I'm mostly just noticing the cut and paste  characters ( Four, Rosamia, Puru), being these super annoying female characters that are inexplicably dependent on Kamille  and Judau. I guess that's just their archetype?   The one character that filled that role perfectly, to me, is Aila from GBF.

You have to understand too that we're watching material that was written for an anime format, and not from a full length novel or manga first. A lot of characters like sdwoodchuck pointed out are just under developed, and Sunrise relies on extra-market material to justify/explain their behavior a lot of times. (Quess in CCA is a prime example of this.)  Sometimes the biggest weakness of the UC Gundam franchise is that it is done primarily in an animated format. The anime industry in Japan has always been about marketing toys and merchandise alongside stories, and not the actual development of said stories to their full potential."

Gundam,3cintv,Brenticus302,2,Wed Jul 8 23:39:25 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree aside from Lalah and Sayla.  A lot of the characters are clearly there for just one moment/ make one point, and the rest seems like an afterthought.  Or rather, the writers overemphasize the character traits, etc for a lot of ppl and it can be annoying a lot of the time.  What's wrong with Sayla?"
Gundam,3cintv,nz-666,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:42:26 2015 UTC,"It's kind of unfair of me to put Lalah and Sayla in the same boat with the rest. Sayla is annoying to me because the only speaking role I've heard of her was in the MSG compilation movies and her voice was pretty annoying. I have a disdain for Lalah because I couldn't really see why Amuro and Char were so obsessed over her since I didn't really see any sort of bonding amongst them.   I agree with you though, the overemphasis should be toned down a bit. I'm never quite sure if it's a sign of the time, being several decades, or if it's even just an anime thing."
Gundam,3cintv,taking214,3,Wed Jul 8 18:11:49 2015 UTC,I think that might be your issue.  The compilation movies have horrible English voice acting compared to the TV series.  If you switched formats that might help your views on both characters.

Gundam,3cintv,taking214,2,Wed Jul 8 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"the worst thing was when they pronounce names wrong in the compilation that they get right in the tv series. personally, i think the series is better based on the dub alone."

I think Kurata is serious and willing to do it, seems he's a big fan of the robot combat culture, but the Americans were probably just doing it for the free publicity and were expecting some kind of shooting contest.  However, if they agree, they should get advertisers in on this and split the proceeds to further development and offset the costs.  The battle can be preceded by a few remote control robot fights (Battlebots type stuff) and sell tickets.  They should make it like a boxing match, where they have 5 minutes between combat rounds to repair the machine as much as possible."

The caged cockpit design of the American is a huge disadvantage, as the twin airsoft miniguns can just spray the pilots into submission. They can fire continuously for a full minute. I know from firsthand experience those guns can shatter teeth. The Kuratas also has the added benefit of advanced targeting controls and not having to eyeball their shots."

Gundam,3camjm,CybranKNight,3,Mon Jul 6 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"Glad you brought that up, I almost forgot about that. I'm guessing the two teams understand that they will have to decide on ammunition. I still think Suidobashi will win, just because of how much work they put into what is essentially a ""gag project."" Judging by the shit talk, I bet their final Kuratas will blow us all away."
Gundam,3camjm,MeesterMan00,3,Mon Jul 6 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I admittedly don't know too much about the Kuratas but based on what I do know back from when it was introduced it seemed like nothing but a gimmick, back then you couldn't even see footage of it rolling around, just it turning it's torso and moving it's arms.  From my understanding the Megabot seems to be a much more robust platform where the Kuratas has the potential to be more mobile but lacking the Megabot's heavy weapons. In the end thought I think the circumstances of the battle and the rules involved will matter more than either teams Mech personally."
Gundam,3camjm,CybranKNight,4,Mon Jul 6 18:09:18 2015 UTC,A competent driver in a fork lift could easy take the Kuratas. It's way slower than most people realize and air soft weapons aren't going to hinder anything tougher than flesh.

Gundam,3c7wm3,OZKai,3,Sun Jul 5 19:43:15 2015 UTC,Eh I'm still not on the bluray bandwagon just because of the price. I'll take the dvds
Gundam,3c7wm3,baconbitarded,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:08:13 2015 UTC,"Old animation looks incredible on blu-ray. They're physical pieces in the real world, so you can just take images of each frame with a better camera and it looks stunning.  Watch Zeta, or Turn-A, or Victory in 1080p and just see the difference it makes."
Gundam,3c7wm3,simsoy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:12:22 2015 UTC,Well not all the time are BDs of old anime better. Some are just upscaled versions of the DVDs. IIRC that's what was done with the Yu Yu Hakusho BDs. No different from the DVD collection.
Gundam,3c7wm3,flamindogpoo,2,Mon Jul 6 09:54:46 2015 UTC,The Gundam ones however are incredibly well done. They actually look a lot better then the CGI messes we get now in mecha.
Gundam,3c7wm3,simsoy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:16:07 2015 UTC,Awesome. I just hope they're not too expensive... Seems like mech shows are always hella expensive it seems  Gotta agree that most CGI mechs look like trash... Really wish they'd stop doing that.
Gundam,3c7wm3,flamindogpoo,3,Tue Jul 7 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, for old series like this does it really matter if it's on blu ray or dvd? The blu ray can't make that much of a difference if any, right?"
Gundam,3c7wm3,wikired,5,Sun Jul 5 20:19:59 2015 UTC,Yes it does. Depending on the quality of the masters.   Tenchi OVA on BD looks insanely better than the DVD. It completely shits all over DVD releases. It is nothing less the gorgeous. You can even sometimes spot things in the far background that weren't finished because you could have never seen them with the resolution of old screens.
Gundam,3c7wm3,Robborboy,3,Sun Jul 5 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"Here are some comparisons of the kind of quality difference you can get with Blurays. Now most Bluray releases do not look as amazing as the two here (Lodoss War and Outlaw Star) and thankfully most releases do not have an ugly colour tone over everything (Lodoss War DVD shot) but they still exist.  Pre-digital anime can look incredible in Bluray because they were physically made, so they can be recaptured at a higher resolution. This isn't the case for digital anime, because it is stuck at the resolution it was created at."

Gundam,3c7wm3,OZKai,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"It makes a bigger difference for older anime. Most newer anime are only made in 720p, but for 35mm film, which a high quality old anime would use, it still gains detail up to like 1080p-4k"
Gundam,3c7wm3,Nick700,2,Mon Jul 6 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"Oh man, good catch.  Thanks for that.  I had wanted to separate out 0079 from the others for this reason, but I guess I mucked it up."

Gundam,3c7wm3,OZKai,2,Mon Jul 6 00:07:57 2015 UTC,"Only those that had dubs in the past will receive/retain their dubbed audio. Sorry.

Gundam,3c5lot,thereddaikon,5,Mon Jul 6 00:02:23 2015 UTC,IMO he's also one of the best pilots in any Gundam universe. Certainly one of the best Char clones.

Gundam,3c5lot,seanhiruki,4,Sun Jul 5 06:55:44 2015 UTC,Um. Sorry but a certain American from G Gundam might contest.
Gundam,3c5lot,krizalid70559,3,Sun Jul 5 11:00:48 2015 UTC,"Chibodee is actually American, Graham is Union  So you're right"
Gundam,3c5lot,Turambar87,3,Mon Jul 6 11:43:45 2015 UTC,Becoming a huge weeaboo does not make you the best American in Gundam.  He would need to become Chibodee Crocket for that to actually work.
Gundam,3c5lot,kateofhappiness,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:36:42 2015 UTC,Nobody remembers Nils Nielsen :/
Gundam,3c5lot,chrysamere,7,Sun Jul 5 06:56:41 2015 UTC,"I remember him, but Graham is on a different level. Nils wanted to cancel his fight in exchange for information on particles, and used a Japanese themed Gundam. It's just not the American way."
Gundam,3c5lot,CobraFive,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:38:17 2015 UTC,Well I mean Graham changes his name to Mr. Bushido... not too much better imo
Gundam,3c5lot,chrysamere,6,Sun Jul 5 11:13:59 2015 UTC,No he doesn't. His fellow soldiers call him that to tease him.
Gundam,3c5lot,CI_Iconoclast,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:32:44 2015 UTC,And yet he wears the samurai getup regardless.
Gundam,3c5lot,Yuukida,2,Mon Jul 6 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"But that was a nickname given to him by his comrades due to his new mask and fighting code, he even said he outright disliked the nickname he was given."
Gundam,3c5lot,Yuukida,3,Sun Jul 5 19:14:05 2015 UTC,You mean 'Samurai Boy'? Sorry my vote goes to Greco Logan for best Amercian in that universe.
Gundam,3c5lot,Terminimal,2,Sun Jul 5 09:30:27 2015 UTC,"I appreciated Nils. Scientific prodigy, Holmesian detective, probably black, weaboo samurai-ninja. I was proud that he represented my country.  And both of Nils and Graham are Japanophiles. Sure, /u/chrysamere and /u/Yuukida, Graham didn't choose the Bushido name for himself, but he did choose to wear the mask, and he did embrace Katagiri's samurai-mindest by his own will. Not that there's anything un-American about that. We consume and appropriate all.  I also liked that Nils at first didn't care about Gunpla Battle and wanted to use Plavsky particles to benefit science and industry. That was great. I don't buy into the shonen theme where everyone has to fall in love with whatever sport the world happens to revolve around. A bit disappointed he didn't have a bigger role in the endgame. Knowing that the Master Gundam showed up in the finale, and seeing Nils on a Fuun Saiki-lookalike, I thought he'd wind up being the strongest-rival final battle for Sei and Reiji. At least he sort of led the charge when the crystal went haywire."
Gundam,3c5lot,Yuukida,2,Sun Jul 5 19:55:55 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong I appreciate Nils, he's a very interesting character (albeit a tad on the Mary Sue side with his overwhelming intellect at a young age and unexplained ninjutsu abilities) and serves as a formidable and influential rival and ally to Sei and Reiji. However, I was under the impression this topic was focused on the title of ""best American in the gundam universe"". My understanding of this title is that the character in question is the ideal example of an American in the Gundam universe. Despite Nils being a cool and interesting character in his own right, I cannot confidently say he fits the archetype of ""best American in the Gundam universe"" as he embraces too much of the Japanese culture. I by no means am implying that his choice to embrace his Japanese heritage makes him any less American. It is in fact what he hasn't done that makes me feel he is not the ideal American. Moreover, Nils displays a large amount of pride showcasing his Japanese heritage in his behavior but the closest he's identified with his American roots is to represent America in the tournament - that's it. Instead, my personal vote for this title in the GBF universe is Greco Logan. Greco's nationality, years of experience and choice of gunpla may be a reference to the American Gundam fanbase as the franchise's popularity overseas began with Gundam Wing on Toonami, which kicked off nearly two decades before Gundam Build Fighters. Furthermore, he was still relevant in GBFT when Adou mentioned him as a top contender in the nationals he'd like to battle - so he's still stayed a big contender after his defeat from Nils. I hope this clears up any misconceptions and that my opinion is well-received."

Gundam,3c5lot,kuroyume_cl,2,Sun Jul 5 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, as i understand it the Union works more similarly to how the current EU works. There's a central parliament but also each nation state remains independent.  Source"

It has little to do with any previous series and is chronologically last unless you count G-Saviour and Ring of Gundam. To be honest, it's so far removed from even F91 that it could have been an AU and nobody would have noticed.   I think it's a solid show, but it can be skipped if you don't feel like watching it."
Gundam,3c60dx,JQuilty,3,Sun Jul 5 04:11:37 2015 UTC,I feel like the only reason it wasn't au is because there were no aus when it was made.

Gundam,3c3cdh,DAMABANANA,15,Sat Jul 4 10:40:32 2015 UTC,"Here are some common things space vessels do to avoid Cold Welding. These ones are applicable to mobile suits.   Materials selection: Contact surfaces could either be made of different materials that do not cold-weld, and/or of materials with low contact adhesion (dissimilar metals). Aerospace & Advanced Composites (AAC) publishes Cold Weld Database listing materials combinations and their adhesion in four categories also for fretting and impact contacts. Coated surfaces: Selected materials can be coated (painted, anodised, oxidized, chemical film coated,...) to reduce contact adhesion. Coating effectiveness can be reduced through fretting and impact damage. Cleanliness: Reduce particle and molecular contamination of the assembly to reduce abrasion, wear and corrosion of surface coated materials. Environmental sealing, flushing or purging with inert gases or liquids can be used before deployment, and in some cases also during use. Lubrication: Use of specific material surface properties or an applied material between two contacting or moving surfaces in order to reduce friction, wear or adhesion. Reduce environmental exposure: Thermally insulate parts exposed to thermal cycling, shield against micrometeorite, radiation damage, stray light induced emissions, electrostatic charge and chemical interaction (e.g. atomic oxygen) that can degrade or damage coating and/or introduce contaminants and expose bare metals prone to cold-welding.   In addition, a mobile suit doesn't stay in open space for longer than it needs to.  This kind of thing would be taken care of during one of its regular maintenance cycles.  A derelict mobile suit left in space for a really long time might experience some cold welding."

The backstory of Casaval and Sayla is looked at in depth, as well as the years in which Casaval took on the identity of Char Aznable and became friends with Garma Zabi during their cadet years. So too, the mobile suit development program is explored to explain the prototypes before the Zaku I, and the Federation's own attempts to produce a mobile suit of their own before the One Year War."

Gundam,3bz9mi,Vatepgo1,-1,Sat Jul 4 09:38:20 2015 UTC,"None of them sold well, below avarege for anime sales, which is pretty bad for Gundam (especially the main line G Reco). But the big difference is they didn't expect Build to sell even that well, since it's mostly made for merchandising and Gunpla sales, that's why that one got a second season, while G Reco only had two cours, which is unlike any main Gundam.

Gundam,3bz9mi,AkiZayoi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"Toonami aired a variety of Gundam, but they're most well known for their full runs of G & Wing. They did a horrible job of airing the UC & CE stuff they had.  That's why AC &FC tend to be relatively more popular in North America vs the Japanese fan base who are more for UC & CE. These same American fans also tend to be the most vocal when Bandai focuses on the stuff their domestic market likes rather than the fringe export markets outside of Asia, hence my comment."

The main flaws I found were that the protags were way too young and that the dialogue was unbelievably awful sometimes (BY RESURRECTING THE BIKES OF THE MIDDLE AGES...) but there were some nice counterparts to that. The animation was fluid and they barely used any stock footage except for that mindfuck part near the end. In my opinion the animation was actually high quality.  I thought it was great too, Victory needs more love."

Gundam,3bzvus,NeonLightIllusion,9,Fri Jul 3 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"I second that scene.  It is my favorite without a doubt.  A close second is when Merida goes nuts in the Banshee after being reprogrammed and Zinnerman is trying to get her to come back.  Seeing a man like Zinnerman break down and plead with her ""don't leave me alone!""...powerful moment, man.  Also, it was during a fight.  It's got the best of everything."

Gundam,3bzvus,HamEaterQC,5,Fri Jul 3 15:53:48 2015 UTC,"The best, best, best scene in all of Gundam is the end of episode 14 of Zeta Gundam.  The series has been teasing the audience with 0079's leads for more than a dozen episodes at this point.  Quattro's identity has been obvious to the audience from the start, but while a few characters have suspicions, most either don't know, or aren't saying.  They're content to let him be the new man that he's trying to be.  This is some excellent tension via dramatic irony.  Meanwhile, we're shown how completely out of his former element Amuro has become.  He's beaten down.  He's given up.  He has no intent toward or apparent interest in being the pilot of the new Gundam.  And then something clicks into place, and all of those threads meet.    Amuro smashes a plane into the Asshimar, finding in himself that drive to be in the action, to jump out of moving vehicles, and to yell ""Char!"" all at the same time.  He's back.  Char sees his old rival awaken, and what's interesting here isn't just that Amuro and Char recognize each other sight unseen, it's that it's at this point that Char's ""Quattro"" identity begins to crumble and be replaced with Char once again, not only in name, but in behavior.    And then, to top it all off, Amuro, falling out of the sky in his parachute, with time to think and reflect on this brand new change in himself, lands right in the hands of the Gundam Mk. II, putting him in a position of looking up at his own former glory; fighting directly alongside his former nemesis, as Char's Hyakushiki flies alongside, cockpit open, and the old rivals see each other face to face for the first time since their final battle.    It is the perfect moment encapsulating Zeta.  So many old wounds haven't healed, so many things are exactly the same as they were before, but despite that, things undoubtedly have changed, and the old heroes have to adapt.  Brilliant, brilliant storytelling."

EDIT:  Starting at about 18:30 here is the TV version."
Gundam,3bzvus,sdwoodchuck,3,Fri Jul 3 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"The one scene I always come back to is in Encounters in Space (the third Gundam compilation movie) where Amuro and Lalah are fighting and it goes into the ""Newtype sea,"" and the scene it leads into where Amuro kills Lalah. It's the defining moment of the series and the franchise for me. Unfortunately they fucking ruined it in the 2000 audio remix by removing some of the music."
Gundam,3bzvus,gyagoda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:10:56 2015 UTC,Did they remove the music completely in such a way that a fan could restore it and put that shit on piratebay or did they add different tracks on top?
Gundam,3bzvus,destructoid17,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"When Lalah and Amuro are fighting by themselves there are some keys of Beginning playing, and then when Amuro kills Lalah the full song plays, which works really well. The 2000 audio removes those keys from their encounter entirely, which is really stupid. For a comparison, here's the original and the 2000 audio remix.   I'm not sure why anyone would want to remux the audio to add that in to the 2000 version though, given that it's still present in the original audio and the 2000 audio is shit for more reasons than that. For example, they replace all the iconic, original sound effects with new stock ones that sound way too ""modern"" for the animation. They change the position of a lot of songs too, like Soldiers of Sorrow in the second movie. Basically it's crap all around and the original track, which you can still easily get, is superior in every way."

Gundam,3bzvus,destructoid17,3,Sat Jul 4 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"The stand off at the end of Unicorn episode 4, from Banagher launching/dropping right to the end.   I call it the ""three mirrors"" scenes, and the drama is intense.   Each of the three, Banagher, Riddhe, and Loni are mirrors of each other, and they allow us to see character growth in specific ways.  All three have parent issues, All three have inheritted ""curses"" from their parents - B -The Unicorn and the Box, the indecision over whether to break the chain, R - Also the box, but been forced to keep it hidden rather than risk its opening (and possibility the burden of the OYW as a result of the box), and L - Unending blood feud with the Fredderation. and to make things even better... none of them really know that the other person is like them.   Bannagher stepping out of the cockpit is awesome, then calling on the unicorn for strength as an admission that he cant reach loni/talk her out of this (even though he ultimately fails to follow through with this course of action).  in the end each character walks away a different person. Riddhe is hardened, he knows what he needs to do to project the box, and he knows he can do it. he can be the same kind of bastard as everyone else whose suppressed the box.  Banangher knows he has control of thee unicorn and wont be a slave to the curse, even if he still has a bit of growing to do, and Loni, right before she dies, learns how truely, truely unfair her life was. not a fair lesson for her of course, but the plot demanded her death to spur the growth in the others so she gets the short end."
Gundam,3bzvus,draivaden,2,Fri Jul 3 21:05:02 2015 UTC,I'd agree on Norris vs 8th MS.  I also like the scene where Shiro uses the river to come up behind the Zeon entrenchment.  A couple others are:  Wing Zero fires on mansion bunker  Retrieving Wing Zero  The last one that comes to mind is the end of episode 1/beginning of episode 2 of Gundam X when the GX fires the satellite cannon.  I'm sure there would be more if my memory didn't suck.
Gundam,3bzvus,Geawiel,2,Fri Jul 3 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"The scene where Cima makes her move on Delaz is by far one of my favorites of the entire franchise. The tension is thick, the stakes are high, and every time I watch it I get shivers running the entire length of my central nervous system."
Gundam,3bzvus,EvilDrReef,2,Fri Jul 3 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"Nu Gundam and Sazabi's fist fight. Two of the latest, most advanced, and powerful machines to date in all of human history, equipped with psychoframes and funnels, piloted by arguably the two most powerful newtypes, in a battle for the survival of all life on Earth and for the future of all men in space, duking it out with some good old fashioned fisticuffs. The sheer irony of these circumstances, the raw passion, the intensity of the rivalry, Amuro and Char's last fight. It was pretty awesome."
Gundam,3bzvus,phizer0,2,Fri Jul 3 20:15:13 2015 UTC,I did love Flit's redemption scene at the end of AGE. That one scene was also the only scene in the whole 3 Generations arc where Kio didn't make me hate him.  As well as the scene a few episodes earlier.

F91 (shitty movie, but gorgeous, and I love all the late-UC designs), Victory, G, and most notably for me if we're counting manga, Crossbone."

Wing and G are fan-favorites here, and I won't say I don't love them.  The 00s had 00 and Unicorn, which were A-game, but it also had Seed, which barely makes a passing grade.  2010s isn't off to a very good start for me, with Age and Build Fighters leaving me lukewarm at best."

Gundam,3bkkaa,TR_Savage_Words,7,Mon Jun 29 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"It's the same reason why Char was able to go toe-to-toe with Amuro in his Zaku, experience. While MS fighting MS was new at this stage of the war, Zeon had cultivated some seasoned pilots who could get the full performance out of their machine. Not to mention the chance of unsung newtypes within the ranks  Even at the end when Kycilia is informed that most of their remaining pilots are fresh out of the academy, there was likely enough vets to make a difference."
Gundam,3bkkaa,Char_X_3,2,Tue Jun 30 00:07:16 2015 UTC,"Specifically I'm talking about A Bao A Qu and beyond. At A Bao A Qu Federation pilots were by then hardened veterans, with pilots like Tenneth Jung and Amuro Ray at the front lines. With the exception of Shin Matsunaga and Anavel Gato (neither of whom were Newtypes) the stock of surviving aces was pretty low. Most were killed in the meat grinder at Solomon. I can understand scenes like the beginning of 0080 since it was special forces pilots in custom suits fighting what were likely rookies or rear echelon troops, but at A Bao A Qu or Operation Stardust it doesn't really make sense."
Gundam,3bkkaa,Finishingtothesky,2,Tue Jun 30 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"Which manga specifically shows EFSF troops getting slaughtered? As far as I know, once the war took to space the Feds win by a long shot. As in, they had superior suits, number of suits, quality in pilots and resources.   While the Gelgoog is definitely the most technologically advanced suit in the OYW, I've never really seen any piece on Gelgoogs performing well at A Baoa Qu thanks to rookie pilots.  I think most pieces depict experienced Zeon pilots dying out in their old Zaku IIs and some in the Rick Doms due to a vastly higher number of Feddie GMs. I'd say each experienced Zeon pilot in a Dom/Zaku II would usually take out 1 - 3 GMs before being utterly surrounded and taken down. All prior to A Baoa Qu.     Maybe slightly out of topic, but I've also never really known the Gundam universe to have the best consistency. A lot of contradictory stuff is introduced in later stories to help support new stories or to try reshape the battles to be more even."
Gundam,3bkkaa,sdwoodchuck,3,Tue Jun 30 05:04:44 2015 UTC,"Mobile Suit Gundam is a TV show, and not an accurate record of military action.  Since our protagonist is a Federation soldier, it doesn't really work to have him fight alongside a force that's winning without him, so he's depicted as the hero that's turning the tide and lifting his otherwise-incapable comrades to victory.  Obviously, this doesn't make sense on a full scale planetary warfare scale, so of course after the fact, the explanation needs to be made that, generally speaking, the federation was working with better tech and manpower to allow them to win the war, even if that's not what we see in-episode."

The biggest flaw for Zeon was the ridiculous amount of R&D Ghiren spent on other projects like the apsalus and BigZam.  If they had gotten the gelgoogs out sooner the UC could be quite different."

Do we know for certain at A Bao A Qu, the EFSF suffered sever massive losses?  plus i'm not entirely sure that EFSF fielded completely better MS. Its mostly GM and their space variants. Zeon was sending out Rick Doms and Gelgoogs plus the better variants of the Zaku IIs.  Although most of them were piloted by novices."
Gundam,3bkkaa,SarraMinovsky,3,Tue Jun 30 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the EF came out of ABAQ with 80% losses, according to EB39.  Zeon was about completely wiped out.  I'll have to get the numbers later.  A Bao A Qu isn't really a hallmark of 'who was better', though, IMO, as it was really just a meat grinder where everyone got chopped up.  But looking at overall performance, the later GM series were superior to most of what Zeon was putting out, with the additional advantage of beam weaponry.   (There is an anecdotal account of a GM Command taking down a Bigro in a single shot with a beam gun.)"

Gundam,3bkkaa,starcolored,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:36:32 2015 UTC,The GM Command and Sniper Custom variants were on par with the Rick Dom and the Zaku II was an obsolete MS by the middle of the One Year War.

If you wanted a little feedback though- I browsed through some of the tracks, and ones like Gundam Rising and The Joy of a Giant Robot, the samples like ""Everybody"" and ""Hip-hop Gundam"" got repetitive real quick. I did like 'Dragon Ball' with the DBZ sound bites playing in the background. The same goes for 'Space Cowboy'.

Gundam,3bj632,AnimeGeek441,7,Mon Jun 29 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"/u/ii_r_ftw is half right.    Cryogenic fuel and coolant management:    Where it works: by using liquid cryogenic fuel (pretty cold, hydrogen boils off at 20 degrees K above absolute zero!) before it's oxidized, you can locally cool hotspots across the Gundam, like the verniers themselves.   Why cryogenic fuel cooling doesn't work:    For practical reasons, it was found to be unwise to run fuel/coolant (colloquially at Anaheim, ""fuellant"") lines all over the unit if it was ever intended for use in oxygenated atmospheres.  The high head pressure (created by the fuel pumping system) and irregular thrust patterns demanded by standoff-range space combat were found to cause real problems in getting laminar (non-turbulent) fluid flow to the blast nozzles of the thrusters.  Even now modeling the fluid dynamics is prohibitively computationally expensive for any realtime application.  Thus, replaying the Hindenburg disaster was judged to be a bad idea by the marketing department. Another problem was the material stress caused by the basically vertical thermal gradient between the fuellant (20 deg. K) and the thruster reaction surface (3000+ deg. K).  It strained even the best-engineered metals and organometallics way beyond their capacity.  So, the test systems basically tore themselves apart in the same way that ice crystals can erode mountains remarkably quickly (shrink-swell). Third, this design concentrated critically important fuel lines on some of the most exposed surfaces of a Gundam: vents and thrusters.  You can imagine how even microscopic space debris traveling at relatively 1000's of km/hr could punch right through and spring explosive leaks.  Fourth, certain pilot personalities were associated with 'pushing the envelope' to the point that they'd use up all their reaction mass in battle, counting on surviving and powering down for assisted retrieval after the battle's conclusion.  This led to unacceptable losses in every simulation Anaheim ever ran.  They wanted so badly for it to work, but in the end, idiot hotshots (edit: no pun intended!) ruined the day.  How cryogenic fuel cooling works:   Convectively: Forced-pressure pumping of the cryo liquid across hot surfaces works well in theory and in lab settings.  Conductively: The cold liquid passed through a heat exchanger element on the thruster module's outer surface, directly transferring its heat away by touch.       Radiative heat management:   Where it works: anywhere there's plenty of dark sky (most of space not the sun). How it works:    Radiatively: panels mounted on the non-occluded (view to space is unobstructed) outward-facing surfaces of the movable frame are connected to an inert-fluid coolant system kept circulating at a constant rate throughout the entire Gundam.  The onboard computer tracks orientation relative to the sun and shunts current into all panels facing away (i.e., into cold deepspace).  Using an updated version of the Peltier-Seebeck Effect, the computer actively dumps huge torrents of infrared and visible-range photons into the void, cooling the mecha.  It is a combat application, actually, of photon propulsion used in earlier deepspace probes.  Here, of course, the propulsive effect of the photons is vanishingly small and the AMBAC system doesn't even factor them in whatsoever.  Of course, Minovsky Particle interference completely obliterates any telltale thermal signature from the active radiation panels.       Heat management has been the monkey on the back of all modern military technology!  Great question!!! <3"
Gundam,3bj632,SarraMinovsky,3,Mon Jun 29 22:26:45 2015 UTC,"I did some reading awhile back that branched into this. Yeah, getting rid of excess heat is a hot topic among space travel and is even a factor traveling as far as Pluto.

I;d like to think that if we got a a proper series t some point Seabook would've used it far to much without a proper maitenance overhaul in between battles, resulting it serious damage or some sort of brittle effect for an episode or two until the f91 could be grounded and serviced."

Gundam,3bj632,draivaden,2,Tue Jun 30 14:00:52 2015 UTC,While the direct radiative abilities of the vents and fins are almost none existent.

Gundam,3bk1ef,nz-666,2,Mon Jun 29 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"Over the large part Gundam the Origin is same as the 0079 TV series.  The are some changes to the order in which things happen to the white base while its on earth but it all results in the same events. The change makes the overall journey while on earth make more sense as before they were trying to get to Jaburo but sometime heading in the most bizarre directions.  TV they start in Africa, go to the US, then to Asia, across to Odessa and the Mediterranean, to Belfast then to Jaburo. Where as in the origin they start in LA go to Jaburo, then to belfast and odessa then into space.   Aside from those changes the Origin also adds about 3 books worth of back story to events that happened when char was a kid and some more back story of char as a young adult before the war.   also Manga adds more explanation to the events as dialog, but the action scenes happen quicker so its really nice to supplement the tv show with the manga or vice versa."
Gundam,3bk1ef,godblow,2,Mon Jun 29 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"The Origin starts with a retelling of Gundam 0079 with some differences. The main plot points are all there, but locations are often changed, some of the technology is changed (e.g. both Zeon and Earth Federation use guntanks). After White Base and Amuro get to Jaburo, the manga has a flash back arc about Casval and Artesia's childhood, the rise of Zeon, etc. until the start of the One Year War. Essentially, a lot of depth is given to the original plot with information about character backgrounds and universe building. After this arc, the manga switches back to the anime plotline and finishes off the events of 0079.  Overall, I highly recommend you read it/watch the OVAs as they come out.  Also, if you aren't already, you should watch UC era media in production order -- not UC calendar order. The reason for this is that each subsequent iteration relies heavily on plot points from previous iterations."

Gundam,3bhvch,ConchobarMacNess,4,Mon Jun 29 11:17:44 2015 UTC,Another god-awful live action movie should do the trick.  Shutting off the western markets from past dvd sales and current/future video game releases is doing well enough for now though.
Gundam,3bhvch,MashedPotatoJK,9,Mon Jun 29 10:35:59 2015 UTC,"The west is sort of irrelevant as far as Bandai/Sunrise are concerned. They expected Westerners to drop $50 on 4 episodes- just like Japanese fans do. Not very many Otakus in America are willing to drop that kind of cash however. Which is a big reason why Bandai America tanked and closed up shop, because Bandai couldn't temper it's expectations or adjust to the Western market. (After all if they sold it for- let's say $20? Japanese fans would just start importing and it would still be cheaper.)  And to be completely fair they did sign a distribution deal with Rightstuf so we aren't exactly 'shut off'. However, I do agree if they decided to port Gundam ExVs series, they could go pretty positive. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if that's going to be the case for Maxi Boost port to the PS4. (Take a look at the initial sales figures for JoJo ASB, they timed it loosely with the release of Part 3 of the Anime, and it sold spectacularly well. All they need is one good Gundam Series to punch Maxi Boost onto.)  That all said, and to reiterate, western sales is just icing on the cake for them. Especially because a good part of the revenue generated by the Gundam franchise is Gunpla. (Not that many people in America interested in Model Building unfortunately.)    I believe the above is accurate anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I'm pulling from memory here."
Gundam,3bhvch,ConchobarMacNess,2,Mon Jun 29 11:15:41 2015 UTC,"I cannot disagree. Its just disappointing to see the lack of older Gundam content on rightstuf (your Gundam Wings, 0079, etc) and the pure neglect of western markets for video games that could be extremely west-favorable like Gundam Online, Gundam Battle Operations, etc. I agree and know that overseas is the main market, and gunpla the biggest bulk of that, but I feel that an expansion of the brand would serve well.

There are many many other anime/manga/etc..etc that get damaged very hard but can still stand, so for Gundam it's quite impossible. Not only that but the whole ""idea"" of Gundam itself make it stand so well-the alternate timeline. This further expand the original idea, and can infinitely produce another Installment. Say Marvel and DC, the 2 biggest comic book company have this idea a long long time ago, the idea itself make things way more interesting, they can use the same original idea like Batman, Superman, Hulk,.... To produce alternate stories and then alternate outcomes, with the original idea that everyone  love. Not only that, alternate timeline allow these original ideas inifinite ways to fix the problems they had (Example: AGE) and just produce another to fix it by learning fron their own mistakes, thus other Gundam shows afterward. Basically, Gundam is a very original idea that can be expand inifinitely, the previous was bad? Make another one, it's still Gundam and if it's good we love it. Because of that, it's very hard to make a finishing blow to Gundam. In the end, what we love is the ""idea of Gundam"", not just a single installment that end after 50-ish episode and move on."
Gundam,3bhvch,NageQsad,2,Mon Jun 29 11:50:13 2015 UTC,"Gundam is something that can't really die. You can make as bad as a series as you like, but it's so iconic someone someday is just going to come along and make a good one and then the cycle will start all over again.  That being said, if Gundam really starts following anime trends it that might do enough to stop the series for a while. If the next Gundam is just full of fanservice, a generic Kirito character filling up his harlem, and just bullshit fights with the worst script possible then we're not gonna see Gundam on TV for a while."

So many ways to screw up an anime, eh?   I'm trying not to make a cheap shot at Destiny. I'm really trying.  Speaking of which. According to some accounts, Destiny had some poor Gunpla sales. People would pass around pictures of unsold, discounted models lining the shelves. Some people hypothesize that's why Kira was brought back in as the main protagonist.   If that is true, it's no doubt why the Cosmic Era timeline ended when they were talking about it being the new UC. DVD sales and ratings mean nothing to Bandai if the kits don't move.   But here's the thing, Gundam can just move onto a new timeline. X failed, so they tried Turn A (which also did poorly). They kept it going and got SEED, which they then tried to milk. Not to mention they can still throw out UC-related stuff.  As long as the toy sales are there, Bandai will persevere. The only way I can see them killing off the franchise is if all Gunpla sales drop drastically over a long period of time. Old kits and new don't move. New AUs fail and everyone is bored of the old. Only then will the franchise die."
Gundam,3bhvch,Char_X_3,5,Mon Jun 29 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, SEED and the Cosmic Era did really well in Japan. They even ""remastered"" SEED in HD. Destiny, I don't know enough of its performance to say, but I do know that the Astray series also did really well in Japan and is still a hugely popular Gunpla line.   I don't know what will kill the franchise though. ReconG/AGE under performed, but Build Fighters/TRY did very well. They still have plenty of UC side stories they could animate (Hathaway's Flash), another Build Fighter would probably do well too. The ace in the hole Bandai/Sunrise has is Crossbone Gundam. It is immensely popular and was recently voted as the #1 wanted to be animated manga.     I can see Bandai/Sunrise do ""experimental"" series like ReconG, but also put out guaranteed hits like The Origin, Build Fighters, and Crossbone. I think Gundam dying in Japan/Asian markets is about the same as Disney dying in the West."

It's was ranked as the third best series airing in January's Newtype, it beat Cross Ange/Aldnoah Zero/Build Fighters Try in terms of DVD/Bluray sales, and it's now airing reruns in a better timeslot. I think the Gunpla line itself was expanded, as a MSV line has been promised. All that is in spite of a bunch of Japanese fans saying it doesn't make sense.  They say it wasn't successful by Gundam standards but you have to look at the conditions it aired in. It aired at 2 am, iirc, compared to something like SEED which aired at 7 pm. No other Gundam series has aired in such a timeslot. The kids it was trying to sell Gunpla to were asleep.   The fact it's done as well as it has is a goddamn miracle.

Gundam,3beh7q,Octosaurus,5,Sun Jun 28 13:56:15 2015 UTC,"As u/Flawpunk said, Robot Damashii are really the only way to go, however, they are a bit expensive. If you're not looking to have them imported, there are shops in the US that have already done that for you. Gundam Planet has one for pre-order and the others are currently out of stock.   You also have the Gundam Fix Figuration set, but they're three to five times the price of the Robot Damashii figures. For instance, here's the Unicorn Banshee, at a whopping $215.00. They are incredibly detailed and come with a ton of extra accessories, so you get what you pay for, though, they're out of a lot of people's price range (including me).  Figurise.com and Gundam Planet are both the same company, but GP deals mostly with models, while Figurise deals with figures (obviously). They're located out of New Jersey, so if you're in the US, they're probably your best bet. You can also try Amazon.com, though, I've heard there are quite a few bootlegs being sold through them, mostly in the Figma line (though Figma doesn't make Gundam figures).   Hope this info helps and if you need further clarification, feel free to ask!"

Gundam,3bbkbj,araragi09,4,Sat Jun 27 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"Char's Counterattack is kind of underwhelming, I agree. It's got very good action sequences and the animation is fine, but we don't get to see what changed Char's character and motivations so much from Zeta, the pacing is erratic, and it has the single greatest concentration of annoying side characters in any UC Gundam production (Gyunei, Quess, and Hathaway are all unbearable). It does do some interesting stuff with its themes and the ending is touching, but overall its run time was too short to properly do anything."
Gundam,3bbkbj,gyagoda,2,Sat Jun 27 22:24:11 2015 UTC,Char's character development was undone by Kamille's mind wipe.
Gundam,3bbkbj,destructoid17,3,Sun Jun 28 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"We don't know. It's never shown. We can only infer from, what, a single line in Char's Counterattack about how he got sick of the Earth elites doing nothing. That's a reasonable guess, and one I more or less subscribe to myself, but it's basically pure speculation."
Gundam,3bbkbj,gyagoda,2,Sun Jun 28 01:12:03 2015 UTC,I think the scene I mentioned is from a PS2 game that's generally accepted as canon.

Even if it was -- it's not even particularly logical for Char to change his position on newtype evolution and blame all Earthnoids for what happened to Kamille."
Gundam,3bbkbj,gyagoda,2,Sun Jun 28 05:48:43 2015 UTC,"He seemed to be pretty broken up about it. Kamille, to Char, had a limitless potential. The kid was Char's protege, friend, and comrade. So yes, of course he's going to be at least a little upset.  He then proceeded to disappear off the face of the Earth (solar system?) for 6 years. During that time he's dealing with the fact that Kamille is functionally a vegetable, and the people on Earth, despite the speech he broadcasted, still won't leave. To top it off, he gets to watch the First Neo Zeon War. Char started unraveling at the point in time that PS2 scene showed. That scene, in my opinion, wouldn't have been out of place at all in Zeta. That was the exact moment I imagine the fuse for CCA was lit."

Gundam,3bbkbj,davidsfirstimpact,2,Mon Jun 29 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah the more I watch Zeta (about midway through) I see the seeds of his role in CC, the problem being how he goes from ""tired of politics and terrible people in them""  to ""I'm going to take control of Zeon, a group I have generally disliked from the beginning, and make the earth politicians see my way"".   It's just a jump that seems like there's a few missing stages."
Gundam,3bbkbj,Onyx_Blackmen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:19:16 2015 UTC,I can see where you are coming from . What I noticed is that I feel like he never really  meant any of that .I think he wanted it all to go that way the whole time .to me everything he did was a front. Look at his interactions with Haman mineva amuro and kamile. They all come off as very much. Not genuine. He was playing Haman's arrogance and comfort with him against her . He has been manipulating Mineva from the start .he recognizes kamile as a powerful new type and is basically training him mentally and physically almost in a way to gain his respect just in case a person of his power challenges him . He even tries to pull the wool over amuro's eyes which never seemed to take hold . This is all speculation on my part but a man like char plans everything maticulously .I have even come across theories that char uses his latent new type power to influence people(mostly women ) to be fond of him or follow him much like sciroco is also speculated  to do with Sarah . I could be totally wrong but to me it all seems to fall into place that way. Char has had one goal kill the zabis to return to his rightful place as ruler of zeon the true zeon .
Gundam,3bbkbj,davidsfirstimpact,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:38:15 2015 UTC,we don't get to see what changed Char's character and motivations so much from Zeta   I've always put it down to a midlife crisis <_< In Zeta and CCA char seemed to have the horrible trait of avoiding responsibility. He had the chance of taking control in Zeta but avoided it and then took some control in CCA but still wanted to go out and play soldier with Amuro.  He doesn't do that in MSG novel and seems to be a bit more self critical.

Gundam,3bbkbj,SumScrubDFM,-3,Thu Jul 2 21:54:49 2015 UTC,Watch Unicorn. It's the resolution that CCA deserved.
Gundam,3bbkbj,wavyhairedsamurai,13,Sat Jun 27 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"No it isnt.   CCA was the resolution that CCA deserved. Unicorn is a different story, that some Char/Amuro stuff got shoved into right at the very end."
Gundam,3bbkbj,draivaden,5,Sat Jun 27 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"Unicorn pretty much just rehashes the same theme as CCA, but by doing so it undermines both CCA and itself, since it trivializes Char and Amuro's sacrifices and introduces yet another conflict between Zeon and the Federation when the Axis Shock was supposed to signal the end of it. It talks about the possibility for people to let go of their old prejudices and understand each other, but it does that by... introducing another conflict where none previously existed. Sort of hypocritical."
Gundam,3bbkbj,gyagoda,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that the trivialization, hypocrisy, and hopelessness of everything is kinda the main theme of the Universal Century.   Newtypes are the next step in humanity's evolution? Watch as they're exploited by the very people they're supposed to ""lead"" as tools of war. Newtypes are incredibly sensitive to the emotions and thoughts of others? Notice how when most of the Newtypes interact with each other they either fail to understand each other, or it's a matter of too little too late. The crew of the Albion broke orders and stole the Gundam GP03 to try and stop Operation Stardust. Well, they fail anyways, Synapse gets executed, and the records of what REALLY happened get wiped clean so Jamitov and Bask Om can create the Titans and seize power.   The Axis Shock (as well as Laplace's Box) should have been a big wakeup call to everyone in the Earth sphere, but ultimately people didn't change. And that's kinda the point; despite numerous individuals trying to create change over its eventful history, the Universal Century as a whole aims to maintain a status quo, even if said status quo fucks over billions of people for the sake of an elite few.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's not necessarily that Unicorn apes CCA too much, but rather those themes run through most stories in the Universal Century."
Gundam,3bbkbj,RoyalGuard128,5,Sun Jun 28 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think that's reading meaning into inconsistent writing, honestly. The original Gundam ends with peace when it had no expectation of having any sequels or a continuation; Char's Counterattack was, likewise, intended as the last installment for the Universal Century, or at the very least the last installment of the Federation/Zeon conflict. I think what you're describing is largely a result of inconsistency between what the shows purport to say and how they actually relate to one another because of how Bandai milks the timeline. Unicorn copies CCA's message (which wasn't absent in 0079 either), but it's hard not to be cynical about it when the very existence of Unicorn unravels the message even more."
Gundam,3bbkbj,gyagoda,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that since Tomino wrote a good chunk of the installments there'd be some consistency in the message, but I can't actually say that for certain. You make a good point."
Gundam,3bbkbj,RoyalGuard128,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:29:04 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to remember that Tomino wasn't given free reign. There was serious meddling in all of his Gundam works. From what I understand Tomino fully intended to end Gundam with CCA, but Sunrise wanted more."
Gundam,3bbkbj,gyagoda,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"This. Bandai basically pressured him to create as much content as possible to sell toys. The RX-78-2 was originally black and grey, and was supposed to look much more aggressive/militaristic. Bandai put the kibosh on the color scheme when they though kids wouldn't want to buy such a menacing-looking toy. Likewise he had planned to kill off Amuro half way through the series and then Char at the end during A Bao A Qu. He basically wanted to end it all in one shot. Hence why he openly states his hatred of Zeta, ZZ, and Victory."
Gundam,3bbkbj,TR_Savage_Words,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:56:54 2015 UTC,I like to think that Tomino sort of purposefully inserted that hopeless message into his later UC installments. As a result the whole overarching theme of UC becomes extremely dark.
Gundam,3bbkbj,destructoid17,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:14:01 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the analysis, it was well thought out and I think I agree those are very strong themes throughout Universal Century.  However, I also find the endings of CCA / UC tend to fly in the face of those themes.  I'd rather see Axis fall on Earth or Laplace get destroyed, but instead we have various forms of newtype  hope/will/mind/spirit/ki/power turn the tide against insurmountable odds.  Sure, even though they do so, it still ends up being trivial in the next iteration of Gundam, but I felt the ending to Zeta was much more consistent with those themes."

Gundam,3b9t6c,tokumeikibou,6,Sat Jun 27 03:57:03 2015 UTC,"They have artificial gravity on the space ships, so that creates some unique gravity things, especially since the artificial gravity is not present throughout the entire ship.

It still looks a bit like a retcon to me - I don't recall any of the shows actually showing those blocks in action, and it might make for a nice plot device. TBH it's not a big deal to me, I can still enjoy the story without this throwing me off - even if it looks weird. I'm happy that the writers thought about this - I'm not sure how the numbers check out (eg. how much energy you need to keep a reasonable gravity level, what happens if you hit this in the battle, how bad the gyroscopic effect would be), but I'm happy to let those slide by :D  For most of the time (for Unicorn bridge scenes, for example) I was assuming they have zero G, and everyone is wearing magnetic boots."
Gundam,3b9t6c,yacoob,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:12:56 2015 UTC,I think they actually do show the blocks sometimes. Isn't that what those spinny things on the Argama are for?

Gundam,3b9t6c,SOLIDninja,6,Sat Jun 27 03:58:38 2015 UTC,It depends on where they are.  If they're in a colony and in the substructure at the end of the cylinder there is no gravity - if they're on the colony interior they're held to the ground by the rotation of the O'Neil cylinder.  In Zeta Gundam the Argama has two pods that extend from it and rotate along its axis by a walk/float-way that are there to provide artificial gravity to those parts of the ship. They're most often depicted sipping out of Fast-Food style cup/straws except for when they're on Earth when they use coffee mugs.  The First Gundam series ignored this to an extent or implied they had magnet boots or something - it really wasn't super consistent. You also had to be paying attention to where the ship actually was and if the characters were on a ship or a colony.
Gundam,3b9t6c,HamEaterQC,3,Sat Jun 27 05:19:12 2015 UTC,The tea scene in Unicorn is in the captain's quarters in the Nahel Argama which has no rotating pods. A young officer floats into the room as the captain pours the tea.
Gundam,3b9t6c,SOLIDninja,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:36:12 2015 UTC,Hah! Well I suppose sometimes the writers are paying more attention than others.
Gundam,3b9t6c,kuroageha,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:42:17 2015 UTC,Nahel Argama uses an internal rotating gravity block like the White base class. One Japanese source here
Gundam,3b9t6c,HamEaterQC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:27:13 2015 UTC,Oh that's good to know! Thanks! I rewatched that scene yesterday and i wasn't sure anymore.
Gundam,3b9t6c,HamEaterQC,3,Mon Jun 29 18:18:05 2015 UTC,That tea scene in Unicorn was mainly for comedic purpose. I also found it weird at first.   In a world were giant mechas are the norm you get used to a lot of things. :)
Gundam,3b9t6c,starcolored,3,Sat Jun 27 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"Shit, you're gonna love the scene early in Zeta when the mobile suits come to the Argama holding a white flag and it's flapping around from all that space-wind."
Gundam,3b9t6c,OhUmHmm,3,Sat Jun 27 13:45:18 2015 UTC,"I feel the Physics in general are not given much thought -- yes they drink via straws, they seem to have magnetic boots, they use little handles to jet around, they have rotating colonies -- but out in space it often appears that thrust is proportional to velocity, rather than acceleration.   It's never even clear to me exactly what the mobile suits are even using for propellant or why they never run out (in space, at least).  Maybe Minovsky particles cause drag / can produce thrust just like air would in atmosphere?  But I have not read that explanation anywhere.  The biggest omission I think is how little ambient light there would be in most situations.   I think if there was a mobile suit that was between you and the sun (or slightly off the line between you and the sun), it would be virtually impossible to see the suit visually.  There would be almost no light to reflect off the suit that would bounce in your direction.  The sun would then play a huge role in combat positioning, but it never gets mentioned.  Maybe sometimes the moon or various asteroids give some ambient lighting, but I doubt that'd be the case in every fight.   I remember there is at least one ship where they appear to use rotating mass at the end of long wings; I'm not a physicist, but I think that constantly rotating that mass (thus rotating the inner ship in the opposite direction through conservation of angular momentum) MIGHT give them some internal gravity at various parts of the ship.  However, the scenes where they show this ship rotating the mass, the stars in the background are stationary relative to the ship, so I'm not sure that was even intended.  (edit: /u/SOLIDninja points out it's the Argama from Zeta Gundam).  When mobile suits land on the earth, I could be wrong, but I feel like most steps would compress the soil underneath much more than animated -- at least up to the ankle / knee, I imagine.  The wiki seems to list mobile suits at about 23 - 60 metric tons, but we have tanks that are a fraction of the size that are that heavy.  I'm pretty sure the mobile suits would be several magnitudes larger but share roughly the same surface area as a tank (per foot).  I have basically tried to ignore these issues and even pretend Gundam universe has slightly altered physics rules, or that the animation is not depicting the physics properly as if the story is being told by an imperfect narrator."
Gundam,3b9t6c,SOLIDninja,3,Sun Jun 28 04:01:21 2015 UTC,or that the animation is not depicting the physics properly as if the story is being told by an imperfect narrator.   Bingo.
Gundam,3b9t6c,OhUmHmm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:47:42 2015 UTC,"Lol, I really like the imperfect narrator approach. But when you think of it that way, the new type part of the narrative seems like an error as much as the gratuitous explosions.   The handles are cool; even though half the time they are apparently completely superfluous."
Gundam,3b9t6c,ConchobarMacNess,2,Sun Jun 28 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, yeah like an old grandpa forgetting what actually happened... actually that helps calm me down about Newtypes, when you put it that way.  There's actually some weak evidence this is the intended interpretation (imperfect narrator) -- in Turn A gundam, the gundam series that is supposed to combine all previous ones (set in the far future), they talk about a ""Dark History"".  I recall reading something, I think an interview with Tomino, that the Dark History combines all previous series via the idea that history gets told and retold and altered; that none of the previous series is literally what happened but all different stories of the same past that had been nearly forgotten.  Something like that.  Although I downplayed them, I do love the little touches like handles.  They give a sense of the universe being ""lived in"".  Some of the series, like 08th MS, Igloo, and 0080 make me feel like real people are occupying the world we are watching, e.g. I love the hanging flask in 0080.  I think Sunrise are really creating some of the best animation in that regard and it is my favorite aspect of imaginary worlds -- e.g. Cowboy Bebop felt fleshed out.  I guess the downside is that sometimes those details don't quite make sense."
Gundam,3b9t6c,conanap,2,Sun Jun 28 04:26:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's my best explanation.  Low G is not the same as Zero G. Look at the scene where Mineva is speaking with Riddhe in her quarters, he stands on his own legs while she floats there. Her feet are touching the bed but nothing else as she sits, seemingly in mid-air. This is theoretically possible in low gravity environments.   Another example in Unicorn- Alberto Vist floats and bounces all over the place when going out into space because he's simply not used to it. Moving in zero or low gravity takes some real getting used to- Like getting your sea legs on the ocean. Have you ever been out deep sea fishing? I remember the first time I went I got thrown all over the place while I saw the crew strolling around like it didn't exist. They scampered up and down ladders, all kinds of stuff.   You used the one scene with the tea as an example, as I recall he floated into the room but then very gradually descended to the floor after entering the room IIRC. It's possible the Captain's quarters had a heavier gravity.   As far as hats,(Silly thing to gripe about) most of these people are military, I can tell you that hats are fitted quite well int he military. And if you're going to space- That's doubly true.  As far as fires in space- could you give me an example of that? If you were to set off explosives in space they would still detonate with a very bright flash, much like they do in the series."
Gundam,3b9t6c,kuroageha,2,Sat Jun 27 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"I was actually really bothered by that too. Sometimes it's just the writer being lazy, but you can think of some parts this way (where they are in a centrifuge): When the centrifuge is not spinning fast enough to facilitate 1 G, falling is slower. So when a person appears to be floating, it may be that the centrifuge is simply spinning too slow. There may be parts of the ship designed this way to allow easier movement while allowing them to work in a feeling similar to gravity. Some ships, like the ones in Unicorn, has a centrifuge section simulating 1G. That's why you can see captain drinking a normal cup of tea. It's unfortunate that they do not accurately describe (or mention remotely) which section people are in, creating a lot of confusion. If I had to nitpick though, I'd even argue that people returning to earth adjust to it way too fast. Wayyyyyyy too fast. But I gave up since most don't make sense anyways =p"
Gundam,3b9t6c,sdwoodchuck,2,Sat Jun 27 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"The living blocks of some ships have gravity blocks, especially the White Base (internal drum-type), Argama (external rotating) and Nahel Argama (Internal drum type).   But yes, consistency in animation (plus dramatic purposes) is probably an issue."

Gundam,3b9cyu,fox112,2,Sat Jun 27 03:14:17 2015 UTC,Chronological. If you ever grow tired while viewing MSG you can always go to the compilation movies. But not for Zeta Gundam! Don't watch the movies of you haven't already seen the serie.
Gundam,3b9cyu,HamEaterQC,3,Sat Jun 27 02:01:17 2015 UTC,"Chronological order is only good for rewatches. Production order is the way it was meant to be seen. Of course you can skip around the alternate universe stuff and only miss a few references. But universal century is not supposed to be viewed in chronological order during your first viewing. Like 0083, if you watch it before Zeta, the ending doesn't have nearly as much impact, because it is like a prequel. It assumes you have seen Zeta Gundam, even though it is set before it"
Gundam,3b9cyu,Nick700,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:06:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i guess you're right on that point. I've seen every Gundam show and i guess i put a little more priority on the Universal Century. I see it kinda like an history lesson when i watch it in chronological, if that's making any sense."

Gundam,3b9cyu,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:15:28 2015 UTC,"""project UC"", or  ""UC Ph.D."" is to watch all of gundam in-unverse chronology, rather than rpoduction order.   quiet the experience, but one might like to jump around.

Because ZZ is really its own series and not a true sequel to Zeta, and watching them back to back is prone to cause Mood Whiplash."

Gundam,3b6nal,PirateLincoln,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:29:02 2015 UTC,"Now I ain't saying this applies to everyone, not by a long shot, but I know that my buddy and I have been keeping an eye on the eBay prices for MS Saga for a while now (me about six months, him about two years), but neither of us have bought a copy, because as cool as the game is, neither of us can reconcile paying even $40 for a physical copy of the game since we'll be playing it on an emulator anyways.  My guess, since the copies on eBay tend to linger on eBay, is that most people feel the same way.  You might have better luck trying to sell it directly to someone on here, if that's not against the rules.  And if you can't find any takers, I'm willing to pay $25 for it, any time after I get paid Wednesday.  I'd imagine someone would be willing to beat me on that, though, but I'm also kinda just guessing on that.  Sorry to not actually be helpful."

Kamille sees soooo many people die that he cares about (and that the audience comes to care for). My argument against victory is that it seems to have so many gratuitous deaths.

Gundam,3b5i6i,saekheart,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Victory is pretty dark but War in the Pocket speaks out very maturely and in only six episodes. War in the Pocket more-or-less emphasizes the ugliness and stupidity of war in such a compact story... You'll want some tissues nearby... You'll need'em.  Victory has a lot of meaningless deaths in it (and that's part of the ""war is ugly"" message) but it didn't pull at my heartstrings like WitP did.  Also, barring the movie finale, 08 MS Team Gundam is quite... gritty in a way. Two soldiers from opposite sides of the conflict fall in an uneasy kind of love that gets tested through the war. It's lighter than Victory and WitP but it shows that even if you try to make love happen, the very existence of war can break it apart.  And finally, Zeta Gundam. There's a lot of... strange things that happen there. I mean, things that I'm sure happen because people are fickle and no one really knows what anyone, including themselves, are thinking. No one makes out happy from Zeta Gundam, if they manage to survive it.  So, tl;dr: War in the Pocket, Zeta Gundam, Victory, and 08 MS Team Gundam"

He watched both his parents die in front of his eyes, his first love dies, his adopted sister dies, his mentor dies (or so we think), nearly all of his comrades die, and in the end, despite beating the big bad guys, he gets his brain fried and is reduced to a vegetative state. At least Uso gets his sanity, and a happy ending. Kamille's happy ending isn't until after ZZ."

Gundam,3b5qfr,GutturalOne,3,Fri Jun 26 04:45:14 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, in a mecha anime like Gundam, it's sometimes like bringing a knife to a gun fight. But as far as memory goes, there's about equal amounts of melee and ranged combat.   There's melee combat they run out of e-caps or their beam rifle gets destroyed, or when an enemy rushes them and gets too close for effective aim. On-screen we tend to see a lot of melee combat (beam saber to beam saber) but I don't think this would really be the norm for MS pilots in the same way that using combat knives isn't the norm for modern infantry. I don't really think they need to be Olympic level fencers or anything; MS combat is animated to make it dynamic and dramatic, so I think they don't need to be too realistic with their sabers (think lightsabers in Star Wars; sure as hell not practical, but cool as hell)."

Gundam,3b5qfr,CrashmanX,2,Fri Jun 26 04:56:12 2015 UTC,"Something to consider is that the tech level present in Gundam that already enables things like the AMBAC systems and the maneuverability coordination of the propulsion thrusters should also enable some pretty advanced pre-defined combat maneuvers. Consider the Learning Computer in the original RX-78. A major plot point in the series is how the Federation took the Learning Computer and used it to develop the GM series, taking Amuro's combat data and creating execution routines to mass produce not just the famed Gundam, but the skills of the pilot who made it so great. Obviously you can't perfectly replicate things like Amuro's battle awareness or his Newtype abilities (though both Zeon and the Feddies certainly tried many, many times), but you can take some of the habits that made him so successful in combat and use those as the default actions of the GM. It wouldn't be all that different to 'teach' an MS how to use melee weaponry. Heck, you could probably argue that it's not even that revolutionary an idea, because the Gyan famously fought using a rapier and fencing style that complemented M'Queve's fighting abilities. In the end, without something like the Mobile Trace System or any of the thought-based controls seen in latter-UC, you still have a pilot trying to control a humanoid machine using joysticks and pedals. What you really want is for him to be able to select a target, and have the machine execute as much of the movement controls as possible without the pilot's direct intervention. You don't pull the trigger of a gun and then have to manually control the movement of the hammer or the pin or the slide, right? When I'm in melee range and pull the trigger, I want the MS to swing that beam saber in the most effective way. A more elaborate control scheme should let you use something like Kendo techniques pre-programmed into the machine's movement macros."
Gundam,3b5qfr,shinianx,2,Fri Jun 26 13:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say feel free to imagine it.  Dodging with extreme minimalism, reducing movements to a minimum the way most weapon disciplines end up in, seems to be more of a feat of skill on the levels of, say, Kira Yamato or Char Aznable...  And that's a pretty tall order.  Not all Mobile Suits also have the build of a human. Every bit of armor would be pretty important to consider, limiting an MS to a pretty small amount of martial arts.  Next, melee on Earth is bringing a knife to a gun-fight, in a sense, melee here means you're probably going to be forced in hand-to-hand MS combat anyway. Melee in Space is a whole new level of different where you have little friction and a ton of propulsion. Some melees are animated as just to pilots circling around and meeting a point in a short clash, this is because of the speed of Space battles.  In Earth, you can easily move a mere mm or so to evade a slash (realistically it's probably around half a meter for a Mobile Suit) because air friction and gravity helps stop you, in Space, you need to use a reverse-thrust just to do that minimalistic dodge...which is a waste of thrust fuel.   Should weapon-based martial arts be more applied in MS melee combat?   Yes, only if you are skilled enough to do so and has a Mobile Suit as thin as an EVA. No, because it's going to be hardly different than most MS control systems after considering armor and range of movement.  Similarly, Char's ability to pilot an MS can be considered an extremely high level of Martial Art for its time. He's one of few people who can use scattered debris (or enemy Mobile Suits, hence the trademark ""Char Kick"") to maximize his thrust and fuel efficiency even when such actions are not implemented in a Mobile Suit's OS, hence earning him the nickname of The Red Comet.  Another to way to look at the issue is that do not focus on just the Beam Saber/Sword/Melee Weapon of the Mobile Suit, the whole Mobile Suit is the weapon. Moving a Mobile Suit as efficiently as possible...that allows us to include a lot more pilots in the list...Like the Unnamed Pilot of the Stark Jegan that dueled with Marida Cruz in the beginning of Unicorn."
Gundam,3b5qfr,CidImmacula,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"It'd have to be something fairly unique to mobile-suits.  Martial arts are built around making the most of muscle-strength by applying specific muscle groups and such.  While some of that can be applied to a mobile suit (applying the torque of multiple joints rather than simply the shoulder would provide more force, or potentially more controlled force), it falls apart when we're dealing with beam sabers that repel each other via powered force rather than by physical force.  So things like that would necessitate different theories on ways to attack and defend than you'd find in established martial arts, though some of the principles could be applied."
Gundam,3b5qfr,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:38:23 2015 UTC,"I remember one scene in F-91 where Seabook tries to grab a beam rifle by hand, fumbles, then one of the technicians tells him ""once you're in front of it, just do it on auto."" I think it's safe to say that a lot of a mobile suit's movements are preprogrammed into the OS; I mean, a crane arm needs a lever to handle each axis of movement, and yet all we really see in a mobile suit cockpit is the visual display, foot pedals, and a pair of joysticks (bonus aiming scope if you're a Feddie pilot in the OYW) for a much more complex machine; a lot of the finer details HAS to be automated.  With this in mind, the pilot is not likely to have precise control over their suit's movements to the point where they can do smaller, more efficient dodges and strikes compared to their enemy. But you can probably reprogram the suit to change how it moves; in Astray R, when Lowe was trying to get his Gerbera Straight, he underwent swordsmanship training, and his master's movements were programmed into Red Frame's OS."
Gundam,3b5qfr,RoyalGuard128,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:55:18 2015 UTC,"In UC a lot was taken from the learning computer I reckon. Pyscomu, bio sensor and pyschoframe allowed the pilot to make more accurate movements by their own will though."
Gundam,3b5qfr,Amuro_Ray,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:45:15 2015 UTC,"Uhm, Shenlong Gundam maybe?  Honestly, the Char vs Amuro fight in CCA always reminded me of two armored knights clashing in the field. Mobile Suits are it's own beast though, it sort of develops it's own techniques the same way European Knights had to learn to deal with other heavily armored opponents."
Gundam,3b5qfr,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:20:30 2015 UTC,"Probably but a lot of the people fighting are pretty green. With little practice, it's faster to teach them how to beam spam than how to use their beam saber/heat hawk well."
Gundam,3b5qfr,Amuro_Ray,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:46:36 2015 UTC,"It is not at all far fetched to imagine the learning computer being able to execute new martial arts maneuvers via inverse kinematics. The computer isn't limited by a lifetime of crawling walking and moving in gravity constrained by human behavioral norms. It just has to get a point or edge through a target with plenty of force.   In this way, it would be faster and more accurate than a pilot, but it would look very unnatural unless programmed to also mimic human joint and kinesiological limits."
Gundam,3b5qfr,SarraMinovsky,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"I think there would be very little connection between human-based martial arts and mobile-suit based martial arts.  For example, MS hands can rotate a full 360 degrees, very very quickly.  I think we see it happen in later series, but there's not much reason for Amuro to use the beamsaber like a sword when it could just be rotated at a very high RPM.  I mean, sure, we could come up with explanations -- like early beamsabers cannot be rotated that fast or else the Minovsky envelope comes undone -- but I think even without beam sabers, martial combat would just be too different.  For example, when you mention ""raising your sword over your head to pull off an overhead slash"" -- in space I think it'd be rare for MS to actually be on the same reference plane -- e.g. you'd often end up with an opponent who looks 'sideways' to you.  Heck, with Newtonian physics, they'd almost certainly not be stationary with respect to one another, but instead passing each other very very very quickly.  That might make for ""samurai"" like fights, but the additional momentum you get from drawing or slashing your sword would be negligible compared to the relative speeds you and the opponent are traveling.  In short, I think 'melee' would be more like horses charging past each other with stable lances that you are trying desperately to pinpoint to hit your enemy.  I'm sorry if I misunderstood the prompt, I wasn't sure if you meant the animators should use more reference videos when creating fight scenes or whether MS suits (if they existed in reality) would benefit from weapon-based martial arts."

Some were picked up by other publishers (like Loveless, picked up by Viz) and some finished series were reprinted (like all CLAMP authored works were reprinted by Dark Horse). Ecole du Ciel was unfortunately not one of the series picked up by another publisher (probably because of that weird belief that Gundam won't make any money in the West). I believe 9 were released by Tokypop in America and volumes 10-12 came out in Japan before the author put it on indefinite hiatus in 2011. Bandai wouldn't republish it stateside since they got out of the manga business in America a while ago, also leaving several series incomplete in English (like Lucky Star)."

Gundam,3b03qk,Diamo1,4,Wed Jun 24 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"I fail to see why anyone really needs a guide at all for anything outside of the UC, and even then, you really only need it for the UC telling you the chronological order. It's simple really, watch the first 5 episodes, if you hate it, drop it, if you like it, go for it.  Had I used any of those guides outside the UC, I would have skipped G Gundam (I did watch it on TV, but i mean watching it when i was old enough to remember the plot), probably Wing, more than likely never would have attempted to watch SEED either when i got older, and yet G Gundam is my favorite, SEED is 2nd, and Wing is up there too.   Guides whether objective or subjective, will always formulate an opinion for someone, what looks like a weak plot point for some, might be considered strong for others. How do you go about making a ""guide"" that won't in some way, look like someone else's opinion?"
Gundam,3b03qk,venom9099,2,Thu Jun 25 00:02:05 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that this hypothetical guide is explicitly for total newcomers to the franchise; it's not to convince people to watch or not watch anything, it's to explain to people how all the timelines work and how they relate to each other, and to recommend some good starting points to et people into it.   Creating a guide that is nobodies opinion would be surprisingly easy. This guide wouldn't be trying to review, rate, or recommend any of the shows, all it would do is supply a tiny plot synopsis for each. For example:  ""Mobile Suit Gundam stars Amuro Ray, an introverted teen whose home colony is attacked by the Principality of Zeon. In the chaos, he stumbles upon the manual for the prototype mobile suit, Gundam, and uses the powerful Gundam to fight back. <insert something here about learning to accept responsibilities and growing up and other themes found in the show> ""   This little paragraph is nobody's opinion; it's just a basic idea of how the story starts and what it's about.   The ideal result of reading this guide is that the reader ends up becoming a big Gundam fan and goes on to watch lots of series and form their own opinions about each. There's no need to discourage watching anything."
Gundam,3b03qk,venom9099,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:07:26 2015 UTC,"Creating a guide that is nobodies opinion would be surprisingly easy. This guide wouldn't be trying to review, rate, or recommend any of the shows, all it would do is supply a tiny plot synopsis for each   So...   Rate the show on how good of an entry point it is    Rate or no rate?  Creating a guide with nobodies opinion would be easy, but that's also the problem, the likely hood it would be used is very low, because it's not really detailed. Afterall, if a synopsis was all they were looking for, simply wiking a Gundam title would give them a plot summary, or using MAL and/or ANN would give them short and basic plot information much like what you're suggesting.   Most people come to this subreddit looking for reasons to watch the different shows generally, and opinions on what is the best or what is the worst, that kind of thing, you cannot get that from reading ANN or wiki, that's probably my main beef with guides."
Gundam,3b03qk,venom9099,3,Thu Jun 25 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"The point is, we take each series and give it a score based on how good it is as a starting point. For example, 00 is a fairly good starting point thanks to being standalone, being fairly new, and having good animation and stuff. Unicorn is a terrible starting point because it's up to its ass in UC lore, and you pretty much need to have watched 139 episodes and a movie to know what's going on.    By not rating and reviewing, I mean the guide doesn't need to include any analysis on writing quality and such; all it needs to do is give people an idea of where a good place to start might be for them."
Gundam,3b03qk,ExpiredSushi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:18:28 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I think a scoring system is a bit pointless for a starting point. The chart that /u/ExpiredSushi linked here has a much better way of conveying all of that and would work tons better than just simply giving the same score to any AU minus GBF, because you can start anywhere. Giving a score to the UC series also is a little pointless because you need previous knowledge to watch most of them minus later UC. So just simply writing them out in chronological order is a better way to do it.  I see what you're saying though."
Gundam,3b03qk,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:53:22 2015 UTC,"Good point, good point, the scoring was just a random thought I had anyway. I also really liked the chart /u/ExpiredSushi linked, especially the way it said what series needed to be watched first; incorporating that into the guide would probably turn out well since it's so easy to understand."
Gundam,3b03qk,ConchobarMacNess,5,Thu Jun 25 07:12:48 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a core council to determine how to word things. Its impossible to be completely objective and open-sourcing it just makes it harder.    Something like this chart I found on google would be quite nice. I especially like the Prior-Recommendations.     In all honesty, something very minimal could work too.    If we can create a guide that is approved enough, we can put it as the subreddit's sticky."
Gundam,3b03qk,ConchobarMacNess,2,Wed Jun 24 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to help with this- I have a ""Welcome to Gundam!"" copypasta I use to introduce people, and depending on what appeals to them I pick out a few series as sort of a starter pack that varies person to person.  So, here's my share of brainstorming.   Personally I don't like the idea of a rating system. However, if we are going to do it- let's do it right. Let's get a third party voting system open to /r/Gundam, and have them rate individual series. That way you get a rating system by Gundam fans.  (At the very least, I would attach a disclaimer about the ratings. Something along the lines of, ""The poll was conducted with X number participants of /r/Gundam, and are very subjective."" Because really, Ratings in nature are subjective. A general synopsis as you suggested would be good. But along with that I think there should be a viewer's guide attached to each entry that should cover all of the following points.     Setting: (What Universe does it take place in.) Animation Quality: (Subjective, but a pretty clear consensus could be reached here.) Dubbed: (Simple yes or no) Main Theme: (This would be a vague thing that explains what the core of the series is about. Like 0079: ""Illustrates how one must quickly adapt to the life of a soldier while he has a heavy burden placed on his shoulder. Also, is the first entry in the Char and Amuro Rivalry."" or ""0080: Heavily illustrates how the One Year War affected the personal lives of civilians and grunts alike."" )    I think this is my favorite Gundam timeline representation. http://i4.minus.com/jbym08F6mWvtPy.jpg I would propose a similar one. I can help with making the image for this entire thing, You can have at the top a timeline like that, and then in columns you could separate the different universes. A brief explanation of each one with the premise of each setting. (Like UC would be something like: Called the Universal Century. This setting takes place immediately following the Anno Domini era, and was declared upon the foundation of the Earth Federation.)   That's all I got for now, I'm sure I'll come up with more."
Gundam,3b03qk,wjapple,2,Thu Jun 25 07:55:23 2015 UTC,"These are actually really good ideas. I still don't know if it'd be better to make a text-based guide that would live in the sidebar or something or an image based guide like the one you linked. We could put more info in a text based one, but an image based one would be easier to circulate around."
Gundam,3b03qk,Char_X_3,2,Thu Jun 25 08:46:08 2015 UTC,"You could do a combination of the two. However, I'd lean towards the image route. Image requires you to compress the information, and with new watchers going into a LONG tirade on each series can create this, ""Oh- this is too much"" effect.  Most common complaint that I hear about Gundam is, ""There's too much, It's too late to get into it, and I don't know where to start."" So, I think simplification is key. (Us fans like to over complicate things.)"
Gundam,3b03qk,CrashmanX,2,Thu Jun 25 09:08:59 2015 UTC,"Good point- going on a lengthy rant about each series would be counterintuitive to the goal of making a definitive guide that's easy to understand. If we go text-based, we have to find a good way to structure it.   On the other hand, going image-based might limit the amount of information we can put in, creating the opposite effect.   It may also be possible to combine the two like you suggested, perhaps by incorporating existing infographics into a text based guide."
Gundam,3b03qk,Onyx_Blackmen,2,Thu Jun 25 09:22:38 2015 UTC,"I think combination might be the best to go with. For the timeline guide I would honestly go with the one representation I posted above. It's all linear and gave me a good idea of what was what when I started. (I could fix it up a bit, some of it isn't accurate anymore. Such as Beginner in G being under A.D.)  That and then break it down by universe in text format.  I could whip up a format in Google docs. If it turns out well we can link it into a sidebar image and offer up a good comprehensive guide. (This also allows open source editing to all who can contribute.)"

They put Gundam on the map so either way you'll get what you need out of them, but you will not understand all the jokes on the internet that deal with the sillier things from the original series."
Gundam,3azuve,SOLIDninja,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"That's untrue -- Gundam was a commercial success towards the end of its TV run with model kit sales and when they re-ran it in 1980. The movies were only made because Gundam had become a financial success; the movies only brought them more, and turned it from a relatively successful robot anime to a mainstream phenomenon."
Gundam,3azuve,gyagoda,2,Fri Jun 26 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the movies, but watched the anime as an adult   It's pretty dated in both animation and storytelling. I feel that you probably won't miss a ton unless you're a gundam fanatic.  For me personally I feel like the movies may have been a better fit."
Gundam,3azuve,fox112,2,Thu Jun 25 05:44:03 2015 UTC,Umm like nothing important..  Like people talk about character development etc etc. But I watched 0079 like 10 years ago and remember like 3 things that I'm willing to bed are in the movie anyway

Gundam,3azuve,destructoid17,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:53:50 2015 UTC,There's less characterization for everyone; as a result everyone's kind of an asshole. Other than that the new animation is awesome and the new soundtrack (which I can't find anywhere) is spectacular. It also gives you more than enough background for everything else in the series.
Gundam,3b1bhe,WackyModder84,3,Thu Jun 25 04:13:41 2015 UTC,Does Perfect Gundam's inclusion mean that Build Fighters is on the way?  I want to hear Sei nerding out about all the pilots he's fighting.

As for anime, the industry is geared towards catering to it's fans. Specifically, it's meant to cater towards otaku. It's just not the same beast it was in the 90's. Not to say there weren't always shows meant for otaku rather than the general public, but they were more OVAs than anything. Now they're commonplace."

If you want to start with the biggest timeline/universe, the Universal Century, you could watch the three compilation movie of Mobile Suit Gundam.  Or you could start with another universe like Gundam 00 or Gundam SEED."
Gundam,3aynmn,KyuketsukiElite,3,Wed Jun 24 15:48:29 2015 UTC,"i strongly suggest following the order of the productions (as are the most of Gundam geeks in Japan).  so start with the original Mobile Suits Gundam TV series (43 episodes).  if you don't have the time, Mobile Suits Gundam Trilogy theatrical releases (1981-82) basically tell the same story, though some of the story arcs are omitted.  After the original, move on to Zeta Gundam where the most of the main characters from the original series are brought back to varying degree of importance.    edit: spelling  i'm on a mobile so i can't add links, sorry."
Gundam,3aynmn,TR_Savage_Words,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"Zeta is... Well... Zeta. Not horrible, but when the series creator specifically writes 'Don't buy this DVD, the series is terrible' on the inside of the box set it should tell you something. Tomino really started phoning it in in the mid 80's because he got so fed up with Bandai screwing with his story lines for merchandizing purposes. Hence Victory Gundam being so depressing."
Gundam,3aynmn,RJWalker,3,Mon Jun 29 04:17:15 2015 UTC,"Use this quiz.

Gundam,3aynmn,6MultiplyBy9is42,2,Wed Jun 24 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"That doesn't seem like a very good quiz... I tried it twice and it just suggested Zeta Gundam and Char's Counterattack to me.

Gundam,3aynmn,6MultiplyBy9is42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the best way to go about it probably would've been to just suggest 'Early UC Gundam' as a starting point, compromised of 0079, Zeta, ZZ, CCA and possibly Unicorn since they all sort of lead into each other and it just makes so much more sense to watch it that way. Tried it a few more times, and the rest of the suggestions seem pretty good but those two just stood out to me as being a bit out of place to recommend as starters."

Although the animation is from 1979, it honestly didn't distract me that much, and I never found it boring. Great characters and pacing as well, I recommend starting here. But apparently the compilation movies are good too, if 43 episodes of a 1979 show's too much."
Gundam,3aynmn,Palikun,2,Wed Jun 24 16:13:28 2015 UTC,Start with Mobile Suit Gundam from 1979. I'd suggest the series over the compilation films. The films compress a lot of the characters making them seem incredibly flat in my opinion.

I'm kidding, that's a terrible place to start for a new fan. If you're feeling brave, start with the original 1979 show. The animation is pretty bad and it got canceled so the pacing in the end is terrible, but it's so worth it. Then you can move onto Zeta Gundam, which I think is the best one.

SEED's GUNPLA line up was probably one of the best that Bandai ever released, and now they're swimming in money because of it.  85% of the Mobile Suits from SEED, Astray, AND Destiny are actually perfectly fine and pretty damn cool.

Well since it could only be 2 possibilities: Better than DESTINY or even SEED=> which is a very good thing and we have a new gundam show to watch. However, it could be the same as DESTINY or even worse. In that case, people wouldn't be surprise or anything because most people already prepared for that situation.

We played through as non-main characters at different conflict periods. Naturally, Cosmic Era became popular, so that became a focus. People still wanted CE when we were done with the Destiny arc, so they had me write a sequel.    I remember today what it entailed. It was a plot by radical Blue Cosmos remnants that were underground involving cloning. They planned to replace Cagalli with a copy, to unite all of Earth as one force and make their chances of a prolonged war against co-ordinators more likely to succeed. It never really got that far as to reveal the plot and didn't have a final outcome. They learned that there were multiple clones, and that the clones were 'flash-aged' in two stages before being the correct age to be a suitable replacement. I... sort of liked that crazy story line.

Gundam,3asdw8,WackyModder84,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"You seriously expect them to go with Unicorn-Quality Animation for the SEED Movie?  Dude, you are kidding yourself if you think Fukuda's gonna do that. He had every opportunity to make SEED & Destiny HD Remastered's animations better. And did he? BARELY. The only thing he did was just Add in a Few New Scenes. Raise the Contrast. Raise the Brightness a bit. Added a lot of Lens Flares. and BAM! Instant Profit. If he really wanted it to be an HD Remastered, he could have easily reanimated the entire thing with improved animations. He already proved he's capable of it, since he did reanimate Very Specific Scenes in both HD Remasters. Do not tell me they don't have the money to do it, because SEED & Destiny were such a huge success financially in Japan that Fukuda is literally swimming in money because of it."

Gundam,3asdw8,MrSparkle86,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:11:22 2015 UTC,"Uh... yeah. You do realize that a 90 minute SEED theatrical movie is going to have a larger budget than 90 minutes of Unicorn OVA footage. This won't be a remaster of early 2000's footage, where they have to pick and choose what to spend a limited Remaster budget on. This will be entirely all new animation using 2015 technology.  You make it sound as if they're going to dust off those computers they used in 2002 and make a new SEED movie with them. No, if this new movie comes to be, it will be awesome, it will be a feast for the Gundam fans' eyes (and ears), and it will be glorious."
Gundam,3asdw8,picflute,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:52:32 2015 UTC,Your logic is massively flawed and you're too blinded by your hate for Seed to even comprehend why that paragraph is the stupidest shit in this thread.  Fukuda doesn't get any money directly from Seed/Destiny. It goes through Sunrise. He isn't swimming in money either since he has to pay the whole Sunrise staff and people he hired for the OP's/ED's and VA's (who have mixed feelings about him). Sunrise then distributes the money across the whole company to fund the 12+ internal studios and staff inside. The amount he makes is based off of how well the series does but he definitely isn't rolling in it.   You want to know what's even more of a joke? The last Tomino project known as G-Reco.

It didn't have an emotional impact or any actual conflict, but thats what I liked about it. It was optimistic in the fact any one can just have fun, there is no need to go full on douche on everyone. That's my opinion though, but I can completely understand everyone's point of view. My only pet peeve in it was the laziest thing the show did was REUSE ALL THE MUSIC. Like holy shit really using Allied Force for just random scenes after what it was originally for, unforgivable."

Gundam,3anf4l,Fenixius,8,Mon Jun 22 03:44:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with some points, but not the extent of the negativity.  Try was a step down from the original Build Fighters, but almost anything would have been.  It was still a lot of fun, even where it didn't quite reach the same highs.  I can't remotely agree in labeling it ""garbage.""  The only thing I'm going to take special note of is the bit about the ""deification of Sei.""  Build Fighters has a habit, and history, of introducing characters who seem larger than life, juggernauts with an insurmountable history of battle experience and unique designs, and then by having them interact with the protagonists, we see the ordinary human behind that exaggerated character, and they're brought down to a much more personable level.  In Sei, we see this effect in reverse.  Our characters don't have a lot of first hand experience with him, and as a result, Sei has become one of these larger than life figures from their perspectives, while the audience actually knows better.  It's playing with that character dynamic in actually a pretty clever way."
Gundam,3anf4l,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:24:33 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting perspective. Still, it begs the question of why he had to hide a gunpla within a gunpla within a trophy. No ordinary human before leaving for a while anyway would decide to do that on a whim, a wing, and a prayer that whoever he hid it for will find it.  I think maybe this would've been less worse if we actually heard him talk or interacted with them. Maybe had the show remind us that Sei was still Sei and not just... Mr. Deus Ex Machina who manages to save the Try Fighters day in the nick of time."

No ordinary human before leaving for a while anyway would decide to do that on a whim, a wing, and a prayer that whoever he hid it for will find it.   That's because it wasn't done on a whim and it also wasn't done in hope that the person he hid it for would find it.  It was hidden in the trophy because of what that signifies. It was an act of dedication towards Reiji, hiding the kit inside of the trophy they won together. Now, putting it inside of the Dom is another matter. Maybe it was just a fail-safe so that anyone who might stumble upon it would just dismiss it as a mere Dom and leave it alone. But most likely Sei never intended for anyone to use the Build Burning, including Reiji himself. Sei most likely understands that Reiji will probably never return. I mean, if he did, what business would he ever have in some random school? And if Sei just wanted to give it to Reiji then there's no reason why he couldn't hold onto it himself until that day.  So leaving the Build Burning in the trophy is sort of the equivalent of leaving flowers on a person's grave."
Gundam,3anf4l,starcolored,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:32:01 2015 UTC,Actually more like. Pushing a gravestone to the side. Digging a small hole where it was. Putting flowers in it. Then pushing the grave back into place. XD
Gundam,3anf4l,Il_Juude,2,Mon Jun 22 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"We can fixate on a specific bit of theatrics, but then we might as well toss out the whole of Build Fighters; there's tons of stuff in these series that ""nobody would ever actually do,"" but characters on this TV show do it because it's dramatically satisfying.  It sounds to me like the Build Burning in the Dom in the Trophy is just a misplaced annoyance.    And I agree that there's a lot of things that could have made Try better.  I just don't think the lack of any of those things makes it ""garbage.""  It misses the mark, but it doesn't miss the mark so badly that I don't enjoy it."
Gundam,3anf4l,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:44:42 2015 UTC,"I mean, it make sense to hide the build burning in the trophy, or inside a Dom on the shelf alone, but when you put both together, it really doesn't make much sense. Placing it inside a ordinary Dom alone would have the effect hidden in plain sight, but then placing the decoy Dom in the trophy make it more obvious that there is more than just the ordinary Dom, which actually make it easier to find the actual build burning."
Gundam,3anf4l,BoyGodz,2,Mon Jun 22 11:31:11 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I agree that it doesn't make real-world sense.  It only makes dramatic sense, and there are so many things in Build Fighters that only make dramatic sense instead of real-world sense that I can't see this one as grating.  Besides, I really liked the Build Burning reveal, so I'm glad they didn't try to have it make real-world sense."
Gundam,3anf4l,sdwoodchuck,2,Mon Jun 22 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"It's SEI. You know, the guy who started a word-for-word recap of the entirety of Mobile Suit Gundam while under hypnosis? The guy who dreams of dancing mobile suits celebrating his reunion with his father (who actually wasn't dead or anything, just OUT WORKING)? The guy who lives, breathes, and obsesses constantly about the franchise? Of COURSE he would go to such absurd lengths; he has this stuff engrained in his blood. It was probably therapeutic in a way to contrive of such an elaborate set up, it probably helped him process the total weirdness at the heart of the 7th World Cup, not to mention seeing his best friend vanish into a cloud of glittering red particles. As other commenters have already pointed out, while it might seem outlandish if viewed through a RL lens, it actually has sound logic to it when considered within the frame of the series."
Gundam,3anf4l,shinianx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:48:49 2015 UTC,I sort of figured he'd want to keep it safe and somewhere accessible incase Sei wasn't around when Reiji came back.
Gundam,3anf4l,Hrythar,18,Mon Jun 22 11:22:55 2015 UTC,"As much as I agree with it being worse than the original I can't help but say I don't really watch GBF for the deep narrative. Sure the original series had better characters and plot but it's still not exactly gripping character drama, you watch it for the epic fights and the ""because it's not serious we can take it seriously attitude"" or at least I do.  My main complaints for Try are that fights mostly come down to waiting for Sekai to Jigen Hao the shit out of the opponent and that (as you said in your critique) Fumina seemed a wasted opportunity as an interesting female protagonist and was relegated to basically buff duty.  I do agree with you on the deification of Sei though, that really didn't do anything for me in the show especially considering Yuuma must have seen him outside of his celebrity Gunpla master status on multiple occaisions."
Gundam,3anf4l,BoyGodz,7,Sun Jun 21 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"Were the fights really that good though? I remember a few awesome moments, but nothing with real risk/reward and a lot of gimmicky endings."
Gundam,3anf4l,theholylancer,7,Mon Jun 22 01:48:43 2015 UTC,"It kinda demotes itself into some bleach-esque fight scene, where both the protagonists and the enemies take turns in showing off their new unique moves/gimmicks, and at the end Jigen Haou Ryu wins"
Gundam,3anf4l,Crooodle,6,Mon Jun 22 05:34:38 2015 UTC,"honestly, this feels like portal syndrome.  the first one was made for fun and made with love, just a series where i would imagine writers / producers imagined where cross generation fights can happen. what if wing had take on the freedom? what if we kitbashed and got this from that.  it felt organic, as if the writers had their hearts in it and made something cool  come portal 2 gbft, i think sunrise realized how much it was revitalizing older models and sales of them, they had a much heavier hand in promotion and it had a lot more gunpla porn. the fights are a lot flashier, there are now 6 suits in play at once and the fights are longer, resulting in more gunpla exposed / sold to the world.  So it went from fun and campy to executive meddling for a profit goal. Portal 1 was great game because it was natural and a love project, 2 just felt like they were under pressure to put out another great game. Same thing here, GBF was fun and nice, GBFT had a goal in mind and it wasn't just fun / tribute."
Gundam,3anf4l,theholylancer,8,Mon Jun 22 01:31:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I found Portal 2 to be an infinitely more enjoyable experience compared to Portal 1.   Portal introduced interesting game mechanics, and Portal 2 took those mechanics and made them flow into a nice story.  While I liked Try, I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as the first."
Gundam,3anf4l,Crooodle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"and it is the same thing here...  the mechanics of portal 2 / gundam fights of gbft here are much improved, but the writing and the feel of the game / show is, at least to me, way worse."
Gundam,3anf4l,FredtheFailLord,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"And this is where our opinions differ.   To me, it's the opposite. The writing of Portal 2 is absolutely superior to how Portal one was written.   Whereas the writing of  GBFT is way worse than it's predecessor. Hell, most of the gundam fights in Try sucked as well (barring a few exceptions)."
Gundam,3anf4l,majorkurn,5,Sat Jun 27 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"So long as the fights were interesting, I wouldn't have cared in the slightest if the characters were as lackluster as they were.  But the fights, while starting off pretty well, were BORING.  My favorite fight was with the technical academy, and that was because they actually managed some semblance of teamwork and strategy.  That fight was really good, but was eventually dumbed down and rushed out because JEE-GUN HOWWW SKOOL OF PULLIN' SHIT OUT YER ASS!"
Gundam,3anf4l,raloobs,18,Mon Jun 22 15:28:18 2015 UTC,i completely agree with this. Try was so much less than the original. Stupid Sekai and his stupid plot armour. and Stupid Fumina for being a mildly interesting character then becoming a quest giver NPC.
Gundam,3anf4l,Ao_Sora,6,Sun Jun 21 23:54:59 2015 UTC,i agree. His unstoppable emotion powers was beyond annoying and got old super quick
Gundam,3anf4l,Ao_Sora,13,Mon Jun 22 00:58:01 2015 UTC,Part of what I didn't like about Try is how they ripped out much of the emphasis behind building kits and the dynamic of that process. In the first there was the pressure of coming out of a battle with your kit damaged. It was heart breaking to see your efforts crushed or stressing under the pressure of an upcoming match. Try changed that to deus ex machina or exaggerating the minimal build efforts sometimes shown in the first series.
Gundam,3anf4l,sourcreamjunkie,5,Sun Jun 21 23:11:03 2015 UTC,"""We need the Build Burning parts to fix the damage to the Try Burning, so we need China to travel all the way to Japan (24 hour round trip) to deliver them in person, it's that important!"" [Ep 18]  ""Wait nevermind, Yuuma can fix it up easily, and tune it up too. Sekai fought a good battle!"" [Ep 20]   I hated the new damage system, especially since the writers used it for the prelims as an excuse for the Build Burning not requiring repair after each and every battle they managed to squeeze in."
Gundam,3anf4l,Ao_Sora,6,Mon Jun 22 00:38:29 2015 UTC,What's worse is that neither of those events really had the sort of defining impact they should've had. China showing up for a cameo went nowhere other than to make fans giddy over the possibility of a Sei/Reiji return. Yuuma's fix should've been the end of a hard earned skill building arc.
Gundam,3anf4l,Bluejay0,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree. In the beginning of the series they made repairing a Gunpla seem difficult, (they needed repair parts for the Build Burning), but by the final battle they were able to REMODEL THE ENTIRE GUNPLA and Yuuma and Sakai are apparently not even as skilled as Shia or Lucas.  P.S. How'd you get the King of Hearts flair?"
Gundam,3anf4l,jeemosupremo,3,Mon Jun 22 04:27:34 2015 UTC,I've asked Falldog for that same flair months ago. He won't let go of it until we blow his head off in a Gundam Fight.

Gundam,3anf4l,Fenixius,8,Mon Jun 22 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"Love how they finally showed us Domon Kasshu's face in the finale but: Teases Fellini, Carlos Kaiser, Luang with Adou mentions, teases Sei with mentions and half of his face, teases Master Chinan with cameo  There were no mentions of Aila, Mao, Reiji, etc.  Edit 1: there is no mention of Reiji except for a single line by Mr Ral which is a Gundam Unicorn reference   ""It's like the second coming of Reiji.""   Edit 2: also there is a mention of a ""special friend"" the Build Burning Gundam was built for, this is mostly likely Reiji  Returning characters such as Tatsuya, Adam Allans, Nils Nielson have little mention of their past and their personalities aren't shown; they feel static. Tatsuya feels like a whole different character because he's almost always in the sidelines (except for the talk with Yuuma but it doesn't feel like the Tatsuya from GBF)  It feels like a cheesy attempt to sell Gunpla, with the static characters. Especially the last episode.   ""Gunpla is fun! There's so much I lack! I should've discovered Gunpla sooner! Gunpla Battle is really fun isn't it?""   GBF was also marketing Gunpla but at least they had a story and lovable characters, to make it an actual anime and not just an ad and fanservice cough cough G Gundam and Gundam 00 references everywhere."

Gundam,3anf4l,Fenixius,3,Mon Jun 22 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"While I agree that there was less emphasis on kit building in Try, I watch the show to see new takes on classic suits. For example, the Gundam X Maoh. It's actually gotten me back into Gunpla because I had a couple of kitbash ideas of my own."
Gundam,3anf4l,Char_X_3,2,Mon Jun 22 00:24:49 2015 UTC,"Pity the suit you mentioned was not from Try... but I did like white a few designs from Try, especially R-Gyagya and Mega Shiki! I didn't like how many suits were barely recognisable though, especially the Gunpla Academy ones."
Gundam,3anf4l,ConchobarMacNess,3,Mon Jun 22 03:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, part of GBF's draw was seeing the new take on some of the older design, I would love to see the Leopard Da Vinci, Dom R35, and Lightning Zeta in the tournament over some of the original designs. Also, a real shame they decide to use some of the old designs almost completely unchanged, like the destiny, G-armor and Crossbone. even though I understand why that has to be the case."
Gundam,3anf4l,BoyGodz,4,Mon Jun 22 05:40:52 2015 UTC,"My biggest gripes with the show were  things that should have been easiest to deliver, well choreographed battles.  For the whole emphasis on 3v3, the fight scenes often had little semblance of actual team tactics outside of the final battle and the odd combo attack in others. Instead we got beam spam or just ridiculous HYPE attacks from Sekai, and or overwhelmingly boring shounen bs because who cares about the fact that this is gundam right? (no g gundam please) , and basically plot armor because the main characters can't lose. This just made a lot of the fights predictable, and the choreography just lazy compared to season one."
Gundam,3anf4l,Il_Juude,5,Mon Jun 22 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"I personally liked the series. Sure it wasn't deep or inspired but it had its bad as moments and sometimes you just want a bag of potato chips, you know?"
Gundam,3anf4l,Irrel_M,3,Sun Jun 21 23:44:07 2015 UTC,I'm glad you liked it. I had fun with it myself. That doesn't stop me critically looking at it. Try was hollow compared to the first season.
Gundam,3anf4l,Il_Juude,8,Mon Jun 22 03:35:06 2015 UTC,"When Try finished, I thought to myself ""now I can truly relate to the SEED fans over crappy sequels."" This series had none of the heart of it's predecessor, was built upon the weaker aspects of it, tried to distract fans with fanservice, heavy plot armor (During the Tryon 3 battle, I imagined Kira descending in the Strike Freedom alongside Patrick Colasour. They then proceed to call bullshit on the Try Fighters survival), and just this sense that it was made to milk a successful setting but didn't know what to do with itself. It was still watchable, but I felt like it was a punch in the gut.  Build Fighters appealed to me and was what really got me into Gundam. I saw Fenice and the nostalgia of building a Wing Gundam as a kid hit like a colony drop. And I didn't really even like Wing as a kid! I bought the HGAC Wing shortly thereafter because of Fenice. I got none of that with Try."
Gundam,3anf4l,danhimself36,9,Mon Jun 22 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with a lot of this, especially this bit;   The more I ruminate on it, the more I think it’s the biggest disappointment to the Gundam franchise than even Gundam SEED Destiny.   That nearly invalidated the entire article for me."
Gundam,3anf4l,Fenixius,5,Mon Jun 22 01:14:20 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how much you like SEED and anticipate Destiny. I mean, I liked SEED alright but I wasn't the biggest fan, so when the trainwreck that was Destiny hit, I wasn't as hurt as bad.  But I really have had high hopes for GBFT, especially seeing how promising the first episode looks. I wouldn't say GBFT is as bad as Destiny, but in terms of disappointment, I think it would really make a case."

Gundam,3anf4l,victorXvictory,2,Tue Jun 23 10:27:46 2015 UTC,"Wow. These... last two comments about my review saying that I'm taking this rather seriously. It's like you guys completely forgot about Mr. Ral's statement in Episode 6 of Build Fighters.  True, we're not at war and there's no life-or-death situations here. But you're absolutely right that like Gunpla, this series is watched for pleasure. But for that reason, we can be enthralled by an anime or Gunpla. Because we like it, we can take it seriously and go all out.  So when a sequel to a series I've invested time into, is not what I expected and was unexpectedly worse, can you blame me for feeling jilted at an inferior product?"
Gundam,3anf4l,Fenixius,6,Wed Jun 24 03:09:07 2015 UTC,"I really disagree with this. This whole article is basically incoherent screeching about how Try isn't exactly the same as the first season and therefore is the reincarnation of Hitler.   The first season had a lot of mystery going on in the background and was more about the friendship between Sei and Reiji and the secret of the Plavsky Particles, but Try had none of that, because that's not what it's about. Try is more about the character's fighting spirits/ will to compete/ teamwork/ yadayada; it's about the tournament and the sport rather than the conspiracy going on behind it, and that's great. All the G Gundam references weren't a coincidence.   Also, some of the arguments in this article are just plain dumb. ""Yuuma didn't fix the Try Burning by himself, he got some of the actual parts from Sei."" Seriously? Yuuma trying to make replacement parts for someone else's highly customized gunpla would be like me trying to fix a Lamborghini by tearing some parts out of my grandpa's 1986 Ford Taurus, plugging them in, and hoping it works. Not to mention how the author conveniently forgot all about Fumina's entire development arc.   I don't disagree that the first season was better, but Try was fantastic in its own right."
Gundam,3anf4l,Char_X_3,2,Mon Jun 22 04:59:03 2015 UTC,"You're saying it's the reincarnation of Hitler. I'm saying it sucked.  Yeah sure it's all about that, but all that stuff was boring. It was so bereft of any tension. No intrigue, nothing exciting between others. And anything that would've been considered 'exciting' (be it Nemesis or Junya) was easily shelved.  Also that's a bit of a false equivalency really. You're comparing cars, a more intricate machine with a much greater set of assembling parts to a plastic model kit. It wasn't the fact that Yuuma got parts from Sei that galled me, it was the fact that it just came so quickly and avoided any attempt of tension.  Instead of, ""Wow this is a big pickle. How will Yuuma get out of this one? I'm curious to see what'll happen."" to ""Oh, they're just going to have China travel halfway around the world just to give him the Build Burning parts."" At least y'know, have a battle before hand where his ersatz repair managed to get them to win by the skin of their teeth. Then after that, China gives him those parts and apologizes for being late."
Gundam,3anf4l,makisodamnkawaii,2,Mon Jun 22 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see what you're saying. It was a little too convenient that Sei managed to get those parts to him just on time, but then again, it was the only real possible solution. The car analogy works because Lamborghinis are handmade and therefore very difficult to repair, while my grandpa's 1986 Ford Taurus is mass produced and easily fixed. Likewise, Yuuma isn't fixing my sucky ass HG Wing Gundam that I battle damaged as an excuse for how shitty it looks, he's fixing a highly customized and VERY intricate model.   Having one battle with an improv repair might have been cool , but I don't think it would have added anything to the show in the end."

Gundam,3anf4l,dattroll123,0,Thu Jul 2 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, where to begin? This ""critical look"" or whatever you want to call it? Is awful.   I don't think you really 'get' Build Fighters. In fact, in being critical of Try you're putting the original up on a pedestal as if it reached some level of perfection.   Let's be perfectly honest here, none of what Build Fighters did was an original concept. There are two reasons BF was successful. The first is that it brought Gundam and it's rich history to the table. It gave us a world in which we could witness all the action of Gundam battles without dragging them down with ""war is awful"" and ""killing is bad"" motifs. More than that, it's a world in which we no longer have to argue about which MS would win in a fight, Freedom or Wing Zero. Instead we can SEE that fight play out in all it's glory.   The second reason is that, even though none of the concepts were particularly new, the show did most of them very well. Even some of the clichéd stereotypes were downplayed a bit, for example Fellini's womanizer/playboy character-type wasn't played up to the point that even when he found someone he really liked, he couldn't resist hitting on other women.   But the whole ""behind the scenes conspiracy"" bit was one of the absolute worst parts of BF. Not only was is extremely stupid, but it was completely unnecessary, because Reiji had no fucking clue who the chairman was. All the Chairman had to do was play it cool, and Reji never would have been the wiser. Hell, even the Chairman's fears of having to appear at events and on TV with Reiji were more likely unfounded, because, and I base this on Reji's character, Reiji most likely wouldn't have cared to bother with any of it. Which means that the Chairman would have been doing those things with Sei not Reiji.   Also, ""save the world from the out-of-control crystal""? More like the area surrounding the tournament arena. At most, the city. A tragedy to be sure, but not an Earth shattering event like you seem to think.   In this way, Try is actually a HUGE improvement over the original, because it removed the most ridiculous concepts and instead kept the focus where the original SHOULD HAVE, on the main character team and their opponents. No background conspiracies. No ""Gunpla Mafia"" (seriously WTF were they thinking?). No ""omg this is super serial guys we gotta save the world with our plastic toys!""  To be fair, Try does have it's fair share of silly and somewhat out-of-place moments, but they aren't nearly as bad as the originals'. Though, the ""assimilation"" thing is close I will admit.   In terms of the characters, I don't think Try's are any worse than the originals'. In terms of character growth, Fumina starts out as just wanting to support Yuuma and Seikai, but learns to have confidence in her own skills and gains her independence. Yuuma has a really bad experience at a young age and takes what his opponent says to heart, something you're much more likely to do with you're a kid. However, he manages to get past it with help from Seikai and Fumina and realizes that he shouldn't have taken the experience to heart.   Seikai grows in a different way from Fumina and Yuuma though. Rather than growing as a character so much, it's more his interest in Gunpla that grows as the series goes on. Which is an ideal role for a main character in this case considering that the entire point of the Build Fighters line is to help refresh interest in real-world gunpla sales. More on point, Seikai goes from having no interest in gunpla, to only really being interested in fighting via gunpla battle, to the point by the end of the series where he's extremely eager to build on his own and learn all he can about the hobby.   I won't go into the supporting characters individually, with one exception, other than to say that they were all pretty good and served as great rivals for the mains. The one exception is China, who you're right, wasn't treated too well by the writers. What, Sei's following in his father's foot steps and spreading the joys of gunpla around the world is more important than China's career in art?   Oh, and I will admit that Lady Kawaguchi is completely a lame character added in solely to garner the interest of more female viewers. Could've been done better.  As for the whole ""build quality"" thing, don't you think that got enough focus during the original show? While it was never discussed directly in Try, it was brought up enough, but it was also mentioned that build quality alone was no longer enough to make a high performance gunpla. While build quality is still a factor, as indicated during the scene where the Meijin admires the stats of his Red Warrior while battling Yuuma, equally important is making a customized gunpla. This is noted during the fight with the Destiny. It's performance is low because it's a straight build with no customization, but it's build quality is enough that it's not completely out-classed despite the pilot's skill. This isn't necessarily an improvement over the original show, but it's still something I appreciate as a viewer because it's ground that was already well covered in the previous series.   As far as the big battle royal at the end of the show goes, it's not really all that different from the battle against the Crystal and the System in the previous show. It's one gigantic battle to see the show off. In Try, the point of the battle royal boils down to the essence of BOTH shows, to have fun with gunpla and spread the joy.   My only real disappointment with Try was the lack of any mention of Reiji's world. Personally, I wanted to learn more about it. Despite that though, Try is actually a very satisfying series. In fact, Try even sets up the next season by teasing the ""Open Tournament"" (aka the World Tournament) during the second half of the series. For example, Lucas Nemesis implying that he would get to fight Seikai there.  The only problem with all that teasing? When I looked it up I found out that there were no plans for another season. Maybe that's changed in the last couple months, but I haven't looked. Still, if they ever do make a third Build Fighters, it's set up to be pretty awesome.  At the end of the day though, and what you really need to accept, is that this is a show for children. So it's allowed to be stupid, and it's allowed to not make perfect sense, it doesn't have to so long as it's fun to watch."

Maybe that's changed in the last couple months, but I haven't looked. Still, if they ever do make a third Build Fighters, it's set up to be pretty awesome.   It would be awesome if the teasing is done in the last few episode. But since being teased at the FIRST episode, I and many others have been expecting some sort of cameo from Sei WITHIN this season, so it was more of a long and slowing wait that slowly grind away your patient until you are disappointed by the half-a-face Sei cameo at the end. It is easy to say in hindsight all that teasing is done for setting up the next season, but even so, that's not how you tease for the next season, it is absolutely awful.    At the end of the day though, and what you really need to accept, is that this is a show for children. So it's allowed to be stupid, and it's allowed to not make perfect sense, it doesn't have to so long as it's fun to watch.   And I would argue that it is exactly why GBFT failed to be as good as GBF, it is just a show for children. GBF had plenty of moments that even adults like us can enjoy, while GBFT caters itself to just kids. In GBF, you feel the genuine love for gunpla by the characters, throughout the series, all that Sei and Reiji wanted is to have the best battle with Tatsuya and have fun, winning the championship is just secondary objectives, and that is the same for most other main characters, they want to win because it proves their gunpla is best. If anything, the goofy moments in GBF make it less serious and way easier for adults to accept over some cringey anime clichés. So fight gunpla mafia and play baseball if you have to, I would take that over Sei and Reiji trying to find his father by winning world champ.   Whereas GBFT take itself way too seriously. Everyone is just using Gunpla as a tool to win the chamionship.  Apart from Fumina and maybe Yuuma, everyone is like:   ""I would swap gunpla every fight for them superior strats!""  ""I don't give a fuck about gunpla, but I have to win for my sick brother.""   ""I would give up my build status if that's what it takes to win!""   ""I would take revenge on X by beating him/them in the tournament.""  ""I want to be the very best. Like no one ever was""  What is if all those edgy reasons? It is just a game... Oh, Sekai really couldn't care less about smashing up his Build Burning and prefer practice martial art in real life over getting involved in upgrading his gunpla.   To me, GBF is the anime that is really all about Gunpla and GBFT is just Beyblade but with gunpla."
Gundam,3anf4l,Fenixius,2,Mon Jun 22 06:19:33 2015 UTC,"In GBF, you feel the genuine love for gunpla by the characters...  Whereas GBFT take itself way too seriously. Everyone is just using Gunpla as a tool to win the chamionship.   You know, Reiji himself didn't care one bit about Gunpla and simply fought for the thrill of fighting itself even if he did gain a slight interest in it towards the end. BF had people like Kirara and Aila as well who didn't care one bit about Gunpla and battled for their own reasons. Even Kousaka got into Gunpla as a means of getting closer to Sei rather than purely out of an interest in Gunpla itself.  So it's a little untrue, maybe even biased, to pretend like only Try has characters that are in it for a different agenda than Gunpla love. If you count them up it probably does have more than BF, but that's only natural as the writers can't keep doing the same story forever and need to start coming up with characters with different motives for fighting. Plus, as another user said here, BF and Try have different themes. BF is more about the celebration of Gunpla whereas Try's theme is about the spirit of competition and your team. So when people criticize it for not focusing enough on the Gunpla aspect, I think that's a problem, because they're wanting it to be something that it's not. It's like criticizing ZZ for not being as dark as Zeta, it is thematically meant to be a different kind of show."
Gundam,3anf4l,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:31:09 2015 UTC,"Not really, Everyone you mentioned has shown to be grow a interest on gunpla as they progress. Reiji like Gunpla very early on as he find interest in the thrill of the Battle, and then later learn to treasure and treat gunpla well after building his own mid-way. Aila and Kirara both started as people using gunpla as tools but during the series changed their perception of gunpla and eventually built their own customized unit out of pure personal motivation, if that's not love I don't know what is. And I dont understand how you come to the conclusion China build gunpla purely a means to get to Sei, She already shown to care for bearguy III  since the beginning and started customized work on her first gunpla.  Oh, and when I say most of the main character, I meant in terms of characters that are involved in the tournament goes, I don't expect Rinko to be all excited about Gunpla too.   I think that's a problem, because they're wanting it to be something that it's not. It's like criticizing ZZ for not being as dark as Zeta, it is thematically meant to be a different kind of show.   Yes, that's the problem, forcing a series with a certain theme into something that is not. UC is not the correct place or backdrop for ZZ to be a light-heart sunday afternoon cartoon and as a result, its early episodes are critized, rightfully. That is not to say Gundam can't be all cheerful and happy, it is just that it is not the right theme for the right series. Same for GBFT, after establishing one of the best thing about Gunpla Battle is that you can have fun by not being ultra serious, we go back to honestly some really cringey reasons to try and win a tournament. If we have another gunpla series that is disconnected from the GBF series and the protagonist must fight to prevent Earth from alien invasion, I wouldn't have any problem with that, not that I think it would be successful though."
Gundam,3anf4l,BoyGodz,2,Mon Jun 22 12:09:59 2015 UTC,"They may grow an interest in Gunpla later but that's not until after they're no longer participating in the tournament, so as far as their motivation for fighting in the tournament goes, it's still not Gunpla-motivated. It's a personal agenda. As for Reiji, it wasn't half, it was closer to 2/3rds, and his appreciation for Gunpla was a very minor detail seldom mentioned at best and certainly didn't become his motivation for competing. He obtained a mild interest at most.   And I dont understand how you come to the conclusion China build gunpla purely a means to get to Sei, She already shown to care for bearguy III since the beginning and started customized work on her first gunpla.   Then you don't understand a woman's heart!  Kidding. No, Bearguy came much later, that wasn't from the time when she was getting into Gunpla. If you rewatch the third episode, at that point she basically outright said to Kawaguchi that she didn't understand Gunpla. From her inner monologue we know that she understands it only as the thing that Sei devotes himself to. She went to watch Sei battle not because of Gunpla but because of Sei. After that point she starts showing desire to understand it and by extension Sei. Whenever Kousaka does anything Gunpla-related after that point it always involves Sei or cuts to her thinking of Sei, it clearly implies that her motivation is related to him. So it's pretty blatant that Gunpla to her was primarily something she could do to spend time with Sei.   Same for GBFT, after establishing one of the best thing about Gunpla Battle is that you can have fun by not being ultra serious   First, I was talking about theme and you're talking about tone, second, BF also had moments where it, too, was ultra serious, just like Try had goofy moments. Look at freakin' Aila's reason for trying to win the tournament, man. That was just as cringe-inducingly over-serious as the motivation of the triplets in Try or whatever. Look at Tatsuya. Until Sei and Reiji beat some sense into him, that guy basically gave up exactly the side of Gunpla you're talking about all over principle. Try is definitely some steps further than BF but shit man, it's not ZZ. It's not so stark a contrast to the first one that it feels completely out of place."
Gundam,3anf4l,strikeraiser,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"*slow clap*   No background conspiracies. No ""Gunpla Mafia"" (seriously WTF were they thinking?). No ""omg this is super serial guys we gotta save the world with our plastic toys!""   And no sudden switcharoos where instead of fighting the guy you have to play fucking Gunpla baseball instead.  But seriously, people really do put BF on a pedestal. I love Build Fighters but its cast and plot are far from ""rich"" or ""meaningful"". The show's practically a walking caricature, it's every early-morning kids anime plot rolled into one with a cast of literal cliches. I think Try just sticks out to people because they're noticing it more after having seen it once already without realizing it. Try's not exactly innocent either but I prefer it merely for the fact that it has the sense to keep its share of silly moments like Mirai's race separate from its moments that are supposed to be serious like a national-level tournament.  I personally think people just need to enjoy the shows for what they are--fanservice--instead of looking for deep characters and meaningful plots, because it was never meant to be anything like that. Liking one more than the other is fine. But we don't need to have debates about, for example, Sekai not having enough character development or relying on Jigen Haoh witchcraft too much when Reiji remained a headstrong airhead until the end who did the exact same thing with Build Knuckle."
Gundam,3anf4l,ConfederateDave,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:09:25 2015 UTC,BF Try was a wasted opportunity.  The 3v3 matches could've been something great but we just ended up with a bunch of 1v1 battles. There was little to no emphasis on teamwork and tactics. The overall story was also disappointing because the writers have set it up so that the main characters will never lose. I just feel like Try retained the same cookie cutter formula but without the charm from BF.

But Dargol's distinction always made more sense to me. A colony is a controlled environment. Weather is scheduled, and your agricultural blocks are isolated from a neighboring colony's. If one party pollutes the Earth, all parties on Earth have to worry about that, while a colony is more self-sufficient and independent. That's why I'd have trouble believing the Kuntala stuff happened anywhere else than just the Earth.  It's a shame I can't find more of the soundtrack for this."

Is it too much to ask for the whole story in one format?  I'm aware I can get the original Saturn game or get the Missing Link PS3 game, but I don't wanna import a Saturn and hunt the game down, and those games aren't going to portray the battles very well because you have to make the bosses... well, bosses.

The problem in the series you are proposing also happened in 08th iirc, were they had to make limited use of whatever units they have and relied on Gundam Ground's modularity to get things done. So pressed are they for resources that one of them even started to use the arm as a bashing weapon..  For salvaging enemy units of their parts, well, that requires a pretty large ""MS Manufacturer"" that supplies both sides...iirc this has only happened in UC Timeline with Anaheim.  There's also probably going to be a few holes in the proposed plot, as then our protagonist is either a thief who stole an MS, some shounen who magically finds an enemy's MS, and has a reason to fight said enemy, which means the other side won't have that economical disadvantage. This becomes a one boy (or a small group) versus the world...which probably needs a plot armor so thick that even Jesus Yamato cannot pierce it.

I was thinking that before the beginning of the series, each of the warring factions could just manufacture parts with their own respective manufacturers without worrry. But as the war dragged on and exhausted most of the resources, the factions found it necessary to salvage parts from fallen MS, ally or adversary.

This becomes a one boy (or a small group) versus the world...which probably needs a plot armor so thick that even Jesus Yamato cannot pierce it.   Or the MC could be a civilian caught in the middle of said battle and builds a salvage MS. Hell MC could even turn a construction MS or Civilian MS into a combat MS.

The nuclear reactors did have this in the CE universe, but they were rather limited in application due to the technology in that universe for the most part, and later on, well it's not fully explained how much shielding the nuclear powered mobile suits have."

Gundam,3alwok,Zonetr00per,2,Sun Jun 21 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"What you're looking at is the difference in two routes of fusion power.  Nuclear reactors in the UC use a method of fusion that does not release a large volume of neutrons. Specifically, they use the fusion reaction Helium-3 + Deuterium -> Helium-4 + Proton. This reaction is relatively 'clean' in that the released Proton does not typically make whatever it impacts radioactive; the only potential radioactive contamination comes from extremely sparse (<1%) side reactions which release neutrons (and with Minovsky physics involved, may or may not take place at all). It's also a convenient form of Fusion in terms of power generation as most of the energy is released in the form of charged particles (the Proton product) and electromagnetic radiation, which can be put through a direct energy conversion process rather than requiring a bulky, heavy, and delicate steam turbine system.  In contrast, the Divindad uses a neutron-producing reaction; we don't know what these are, or the reason it was built this way (most neutron-producing fusion reactions actually produce less energy than the He3+Deuterium reaction mentioned above). The only technical advantage is relative availability of fuel, and even that is questionable considering that the Divinidad was built by the people who have unfettered access to Helium-3. We do understand the consequences of this, though: The neutrons produced by the reaction are hard to capture and often turn whatever they impact radioactive itself; in addition, some materials may actually be damaged by extended exposure to neutron radiation. In short, the Divinidad's reactor casing would have to eventually be replaced - and be highly radioactive waste when this is done.  CE's suits function on nuclear fission, not fusion. I don't know if we're ever told what fuels them, but it's safe to assume they would face many of the same issues that modern nuclear reactors do: Production of large volumes of spent fuel, secondary radioactive waste, necessity of bulky reactor shielding, etc. Yes, this does mean any destruction of a nuclear-powered CE suit which opens the reactor would be very, very bad in environmental terms."

Gundam,3ajijw,yatpay,19,Sat Jun 20 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"The science of the colonies is all based on the work of Gerard K. O'Neill(the most common type of colony in Gundam being the ""O'Neill Cylinder""(Island-3) with ""Island-1"" types being more early built aging models by the time Gundam's story happens) and can be seen in almost every episode of every Gundam series that takes place in space(obviously when they're on the planet they don't show the space colonies as much)  The story of Gundam deals less with the science of these colonies(they don't go into technical details unless it's plot related i.e. that gravity gets less toward the center of the cylinder leading to a mixed gravity environment inside the colony meaning that the characters can be floating around in one part of the colony and walking around on dirt-ground under ""blue skies"" in another part of the colony) and instead deals more with the social/political implications of having people living in space colonies around the planet where the economic elite still live while the poor suffer in space. After about 79 years of space living the colonists start to demand autonomy and start a war for independence which they win and turn into an invasion to ""free the shit out of Earth"" so-to-speak and start acting like space-nazis.  What I'm betting you're really wanting to know is about the ""Side"" system - or how these space colonies are organized into clusters called ""Sides"" - there are as many as 100 colonies in a ""Side"" and usually 2 ""Sides"" orbiting a single Lagrangian point. Futher-more Sides will be broken down into a ""Bunch"" or ""Block"" depending on where they fly in their orbit formation and then each colony had its own special name like ""Watohoat"" or ""Texas Colony"" or ""Shangri La""- so an address would look something like this:   Casval Deikun,  333 Red Comet St.  Zum City, Munzo, Block 1, Side 3, Earth Sphere   Street Address, City/District Name, Colony Name, Colony Block, Side #, Planetary sphere of influence.  Here's a map of Universal Century sides(Collectively called the ""Earth Sphere"" - as opposed to the ""Venus"", ""Mars"" or ""Jupiter Sphere"" that also have their own colonies organized in a similar way): http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/9/95/UC_spacemap1.gif/revision/latest?cb=20110612233336 *Note that on that map each ""Side"" is represented as a single colony to represent the numerous colonies orbiting at that point.  Here is the opening from the original Mobile Suit Gundam that gives a pretty good overview and is prime for screenshot taking: https://youtu.be/1xffGtMN31Q  Here's the wikipedia page about O'neill cylinders as another place to start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill_cylinder"
Gundam,3ajijw,SOLIDninja,4,Sat Jun 20 21:10:22 2015 UTC,"Wait... there's colonies in the Mars, Venus, and Jupiter sphere? How did I never know about this? I knew about the Jupiter energy fleet, but I thought that was more like space oil rigs and tankers than an actual region with more colonies. What series talk about this? Or is it more in expanded universe stuff like Crossbone?"
Gundam,3ajijw,Owyn_Merrilin,2,Sun Jun 21 00:31:40 2015 UTC,Crossbones they go to the Jupiter sphere to fight the Jupiter empire. Gundam F92 is about Mars Zeon invading Earth. Some things aren't directly stated to my knowledge though - i.e. that there are many colonies around Mars - but if there is a settlement on the surface of Mars it goes to reason that there are colonies around the planet as well - just likely much much fewer than Earth or Jupiter where all the resources and wealth are.  Venus I'm making assumptions about. It doesn't seem to be a planet very important until Reconguista's Reguild Century where they're manufacturing photon batteries because of its proximity to the sun so there may not actually be colonies out there in Universal Century but at some point they do settle Venus and have colonies around it in Reconguista in G - all be it a completely futuristic type of colony that doesn't run on the same kind of science that the O'neill cylinders of the U.C. do.
Gundam,3ajijw,SOLIDninja,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't even realize there were settlements on the surface of mars, but then the furthest into the UC I've gone is 0093. It looks like the Jupiter Empire didn't really exist prior to around 0120, and I've never watched F91 or any of the post F91 stuff. Read a little bit of the Crossbone manga at some point, though, which is why it rang enough of a bell for me to mention it."
Gundam,3ajijw,Owyn_Merrilin,3,Sun Jun 21 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"The Jupiter Empire wouldnt spring up over night without any settlements - and with the planet being made of starship fuel you can bet they had a settlement that's acted as a way station for the energy fleet since the beginning of the project(over 200 years at the point of U.C.)  That's 320 years of people visiting Jupiter before they declare themselves an empire.  The Jupiter Empire didn't exist before UC.0120 - but the ""Jupiter Sphere"" was there during U.C.  EDIT: people also operate under the assumption that U.C.0001 was when the first space colony was built. It wasn't. People had been in space over a hundred years at that point exploring and setting up the infrastructure to send their interplanetary resources back to Earth, living in make-shift settlement asteroid bases like Axis - I'm counting these as colonies even though they may have been closer to something like ""work camps""."
Gundam,3ajijw,SOLIDninja,3,Sun Jun 21 00:51:27 2015 UTC,"people also operate under the assumption that U.C.0001 was when the first space colony was built. It wasn't.

Well that works back in to the discussion I was having in another thread about Moon Moon. ZZ gave me the impression the colony itself was some kind of pre-Side 1 proof of concept, and if people were actually living in space for around a hundred years by the time UC 0001 came around, that makes the timeline fit better. All the background information I remember implies that the UC started when humanity started to migrate into space in large numbers, not just when the first space colony was built. It doesn't exactly make much sense that millions of people would go into space without some smaller scale successes earlier in the timeline."
Gundam,3ajijw,Owyn_Merrilin,3,Sun Jun 21 01:01:53 2015 UTC,"Bingo. The ""Dawn of the U.C."" was the end of the old era of terrestrial war and rebuilding with the Eath Federation having united the planet from whatever faction was resisting them. The Universal Century was supposed to be that ideal of the 1950's ""American Dreams of the Future"" with how it was sold to the public - but was really something closer to the colonization of Australia in the days before that. Most people were forced to go(Probably prisoners from the previous wars of Earth unification) - others went of their own accord seeking a new life and second chance in space.  The people that had money and owned land on the over-populated Earth didn't go anywhere, it was the people with nothing to lose that left home. But the U.C. Era switch-over was more-or-less ""Space is open for business! Come move to the stars!"" after things had been settled in that ""Wild-West-Space"" era that briefly preceded the Universal Century."

Gundam,3affve,Paltheos,11,Fri Jun 19 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"Why did the Zeta transform?  Why did the Double Zeta get so chubby?  Why did the Victory fling it's limbs god-damned everywhere?  I don't mean that to be snarky, just to give some context.  Most new Gundam series, there are design elements that are ""unusual,"" just because they want an aesthetic style that sets it apart from what has come before, while still remaining recognizable as a piece of the same family tree.  A new shield type was just one way of doing that.  There's occasionally an in-universe reason made up to cover it, but usually this is just an explanation after the fact to justify a design decision; not a design to fill some function by design."

(Seriously, I know they didn't make the Turn X's MB system, but I don't think making a second near world ending weapon is better.)"
Gundam,3affve,AkiZayoi,0,Sun Jun 21 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"All that makes sense. I'd already had it in my mind. Like I said, this shield is different because it doesn't appear to provide any benefit for its shape, real or perceived (obviously perceived is more important for the audience, but an in-universe explanation is nice too).  Why does the Zeta transform? Because transformations are cool and let you fight in different ways to deal with different situations Why is the ZZ bulky? Because bigger is stronger (look at those beam sabers, bro) Why does Victory do that thing? Fuck if I know. I never watched Victory. A core block system? Because it's cool. Backpacks? Because they're cool.* Cutting weapons with a metal edge and a beam? Because they're cool. And so on.  *They are. Shut up.  Forget the real advantage (unless there is one, and no one's mentioned). Why then should the audience like it? Obviously a bunch of people do and I'm... ok with it, I just don't get it. What's cool about it? Or maybe it's better to ask straight why and how Bandai decided on this particular design? Why did they think this particular design would be liked?"
Gundam,3affve,NageQsad,2,Sat Jun 20 02:49:34 2015 UTC,Technically it's not a shield but a defense plate. Maybe it has weird design because the designers couldn't design a proper shield for the DX yet so they just use this as a substitute. Because IRC Garrod the Swag stole it from their base and later evaporated it.
Gundam,3affve,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"Well that's getting into a discussion on aesthetic design, on which I really am not an expert and wouldn't claim to be.  I'll take a stab at it though, just to give you my best effort.   Normally, you'll notice that a Gundam series tends to adhere to self-contained design aesthetic.  If you look at 0079, you see a lot of curvier designs around a large center of mass on the Zeon side, in Zeta you see a lot more angular, thin, agile designs, and a lot more transformation (note the Zeta's shield here is longer and narrower to fit that aesthetic).  In Reconguista you see softer lines, smaller-frame curves and the like (again, note the G-Self's shield being a bit proportionately wider in the middle here than usual, with a more gentle slope in its angles) .  Creating that sense of design consistency creates a more unified setting, even aside from practicality.    It has been a while since I've seen Gundam X, but the design aesthetic of that series, from what I recall, had a bit more on the angular side, with lots of protrusions and sharp edges.  The shield seems to adhere somewhat to that basic philosophy, with the bottom edge tapering out to a relatively stylized sharp point.  Obviously there's a lot of ways they could have handled the shield, and the choice to go with that one over something different (and perhaps more symmetrical) would likely h e just come down to that specific mecha designer working within that specific context."
Gundam,3affve,Vatepgo1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:21:02 2015 UTC,"Actually doesn't G-Self Perfect Pack shield have a little ability called copy paste shield which creates a particle image of his physical shield, it can also block weapons  like the reflector pack and it also have something similar to I-field in it."

Gundam,3affve,Char_X_3,2,Fri Jun 19 19:38:46 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this, that extra piece allows greater coverage for the side it's not aiming out of. It's protecting the blindspot the shield itself creates."
Gundam,3affve,IKill4MySkill,2,Fri Jun 19 18:36:36 2015 UTC,Because Double X is the best Gundam and this shield is awesome.
Gundam,3affve,Daishomaru,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"A minor sticking point has bugged me for a while. Gundam shields are symmetrical - They just are. When I watched Gundam X, I actually assumed the Double X's shield is symmetrical, that it was just curved by the center so that we only saw half of it at any given time. But then when I bought a HG years later, I found that, no, it's not.  What is the deal with the design? I don't dislike it, but it's so unusual - Small, assymmetrical, and detailed and designed in no immediately obvious manner for any particular purpose. It's such a stark contrast from the Divider shield from the same series which is arguably the greatest Gundam shield ever (it's a looker and almost certainly the most useful Gundam shield).   Why does it look like that? I've put an unusual amount of thought into this and can't figure it out. Did the mecha designer want something more in-line with the chaotic After War world? Maybe we're supposed to believe Kid just slapped together whatever he had lying around for it. I don't know, and I'm curious if anyone else has any insight on this."

Gundam,3aftil,sdwoodchuck,7,Fri Jun 19 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm torn between two scenes between Amuro and Char, both in Zeta Gundam. The one that all but the last panel of this picture comes from, and the scene where Four dies and the two of them reflect on their own rivalry in the last conflict, and how the events around Lalah had just repeated themselves.  The downside of that last scene is, it makes Char's Counterattack come completely out of left field. Char and Amuro were mature enough to realize that Lalah's blood wasn't really on either of their hands, she was just another promising young newtype who was chewed up by the meatgrinder of war, which would always continue as long as humanity's soul was weighed down by gravity. You even saw Char recognizing that the whole attachment to Lalah was some kind of newtype side affect, and warning Kamille about it with Four shortly before she bought it.  Fastforward a few years and now Char has mommy issues and Amuro is pissed off that Char killed the girl he had the hots for. And both the mommy and the hotty are the same person. Just completely tossed out all of the characterization from Zeta, which is a shame because every time those two were on screen together was solid gold."

EDIT: my favorite monologue/moment is from Char's Counterattack: ""There are just some things you don’t understand. Revolutions are dreamt up by intellectuals, but their aims are so unrealistic that they’ll steep to drastic measures. Following the revolution, the worthy passions for rebirth are swallowed up by bureaucracy and mediocrity. Intellectuals hate this and withdraw from society and politics and become recluses!"" -Amuro Ray  It just sums up what the movie had been lacking in exposition for most of its duration."

I presume also that the twin beam sword is ejected from that arm holder before it is used, otherwise the rear beam could project right up into the shoulder. In-universe I'd say this feels like a very mobility-heavy design, perhaps trying to take the Dom's high speed and mate it with the Gelgoog's higher reactor output, using external boosters to extend operating time.  Drawing-wise, it's very good. Your lines are clean and everything fits together well. The only thing I would point out is the left-hand booster mirrors the angle of the right hand one; this would make sense if the suit were directly facing the right one, but since it isn't the left one ends up looking a bit awkward."

Gundam,3ackoq,gyagoda,2,Sun Jun 21 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"Unicorn was written with the expectation you'd seen the previous installments of UC. 0079, Zeta, ZZ, and CCA are the bulk of it what you need; there's a throwaway reference or two to Stardust Memory that has no plot relevance. You'll probably be able to figure out what's going on without having done so, but you probably won't enjoy it as much, nor will the themes hit home as hard.   Unicorn is sort of like a love song to the rest of UC, and watching it without having seen that doesn't really do it justice."

Beyond that, every piece of UC you've seen simply makes Unicorn better.    Without that basic UC knowledge, however, you'll be lost.  Speaking from experience here - one of my best friends saw 00 and then Unicorn and was totally lost in Unicorn (2nd viewing went much better), while my other best friend saw 00 and then 0079 and Stardust Memory before watching Unicorn and was entranced.  Though, IIRC, there's a Unicorn EX episode or something like that which is a basic ""what's come before"" kinda gig.  You could probably just start with that and then hit Unicorn proper."

Gundam,3aanvr,Nick700,3,Thu Jun 18 16:16:33 2015 UTC,Gundam 0079 has good animation that is horrible at times. It is in no way unimpressive

Gundam,3aanvr,Nick700,0,Fri Jun 19 03:23:33 2015 UTC,What do you think I should start with?   Uhh... the first one
Gundam,3aanvr,Kanaxai,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:53:13 2015 UTC,Sometimes the beginning isn't the best place to start for newbies. Just wanted to make sure I don't make another mistake.
Gundam,3aanvr,Kanaxai,2,Fri Jun 19 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"Lots of people do start with 08th MS team or Wing, but it is best to just watch everything in the order it was released. All gundam shows make small references to previous gundam shows, and watching out of order can sometimes mess that up. About half of all of Gundam takes place in one universe, and needs to be watched in order. This is the Universal Century timeline. The rest are all in their own individual ones. So most of those could be skipped around in, without missing anything major. Only easter egg type stuff. G reco is kind of in the middle. You don't really have to know about any other Gundam shows to get it. But the show takes place in the same universe as the original Universal Century timeline.  The ""Gundam"" was just an early mobile suit that helped one side win humanity's first space war. This was the first Gundam, taking place in Universal Century 0079. So they made more Gundam-type mobile suits that were always the cutting edge prototypes, so they were usually the best mobile suits on the field. This was happening in like the next 7 Gundam installments, going as far as 75 years after the time of the first show. Then an unknown thousands of years later, the events of G-reco take place. Technology, factions, everything is way different in ""Reguild Century"" compared to Universal Century. That is pretty much all you need to know to fully understand the plot of G Reco.   The writer and director of most of the Universal Century Gundam shows and G-Reco, Yoshiyuki Tomino, is kind of known for his strange storytelling. Character interactions can seem strange and unlike what would happen in real life. Many things that would seem extremely important are only talked about one or two times. Often, events are set into motion by main characters, but we aren't at all kept up to date with what is happening until the very end goal of those events is shown. Random things can pop in and then the main character will be like ""Oh, just what I was expecting"". G-reco is the most notorious for this. Even Tomino himself said that the show was too hard to follow once he was finished. So it is kind of natural to not fully know what is happening, like all the time. I'd say just finish it.  Then go to the beginning with Gundam 0079. The animation is simple and extremely low budget by today's standards. But the important parts have some great animation. Also it is the 2nd most influential anime of all time behind Evangelion.   You could also go to any of the standalone Gundam shows, if you don't mind missing minor references.  http://i2.minus.com/ifFhfgRAV7oeQ.jpg"
Gundam,3aanvr,AVestedInterest,9,Fri Jun 19 03:55:12 2015 UTC,"Frankly, even Gundam fans were confused with what was going on in G-Reco, so don't feel so bad.  As for where to start, you have two choices, either pick a series earlier in the Universal Century timeline (the one from the original Mobile Suit Gundam that eventually leads to G-Reco) or one from the alternate universes that have closed off stories. A lot of people got introduced to Gundam with Gundam Wing, so I think it's a good starting point."
Gundam,3aanvr,animusradiation,2,Thu Jun 18 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"There are alternate universes? Geez, this is a lot more complicated than I first thought... another commenter recommended 08th MS Team. Does that take place in the main universe?"
Gundam,3aanvr,sdwoodchuck,4,Thu Jun 18 17:30:25 2015 UTC,It can be a bit confusing if you are not familiar. There is actually a guide with all the series. As you can see 08th MS Team is from the UC timeline.
Gundam,3aanvr,Vatepgo1,2,Thu Jun 18 17:55:59 2015 UTC,This is both glorious and daunting.
Gundam,3aanvr,kuroyume_cl,2,Fri Jun 19 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"The alternate universes are all named after what calendar they use:  UC = Universal Century  AW = After War  FC = Future Century  AC = After Colony  AD = Anno Domini  CE = Cosmic Era  CC = Correct Century  AG = Advanced Generation  Except for the Build Fighters timeline, which is ostensibly AD but not referred to as such."
Gundam,3aanvr,paulreoyo,3,Fri Jun 19 00:11:09 2015 UTC,"We can simplify this further, since the Universal Century universe switches calendar formats over the course of the timeline.   UC (Universal Century/0079) >  Regild Century (G-Reco) > Correct Century (Turn A). This is the main timeline and the greater majority of works are set here. IMO the best starting point.   After War is something of an alternate continuity from the Universal Century, but it follows pretty much the same physics and principles.   After Colony covers the Gundam Wing continuity. A lot of the American fans were first exposed to Gundam via this series, and it represents a neat continuity so it's a good starting point as well.   Future Century covers the G Gundam (giant robo martial art mecha) continuity. It's arguably the most memetic, mostly because it's the outlier when it comes to genre (it's more super robot than real robot) and the mecha designs are hilariously endearing (Tequila Gundam)  Cosmic Era: The Gundam SEED continuity. Poor reception in the West but hugely popular in Japan. I won't start here, but if you're looking for cool stories, Stargazer is pretty good.   Anno Domini: This gets messy. Gundam 00 (arguably one of the darlings of this sub)'s continuity is set here. It's a small, but neat universe, though be forewarned: the movie's crap.   This is the messy part: as mentioned above, since Gundam Build Fighters/Gundam Build Fighters Try is set in the present day in the ""real world"", it's presumably set in this timeline. However, Gundam 00's Anno Domini exists within the GBF's Anno Domini since the former (along with all the other gundam series) is fictional in the latter. I personally just refer to it in my mind as the Common Era timeline, since we now generally prefer appending CE/BCE to historical documents over AD/BC  Advanced Generation: The Gundam AGE continuity. Not a good starting point, since the lore isn't as fleshed out as the other continuities and the sub has pretty much a universal consensus on how horrible it turned out.   When you think about it, it's much easier to sort out the alternate continuities by their distinguishing technological features. You have a Minovsky continuity, a GN Particle continuity, a SEED continuity, etc."

Gundam,3a91l9,mcroller,20,Thu Jun 18 04:45:55 2015 UTC,"I actually like the Gundam universe reasoning for robots.  Still not THAT realistic but enough for me to suspend disbelief.  Basically it all boils down to ""what happens to space combat when radar (and even visible light) fails""?  In Gundam this is due to Minovsky particles.  Gundam responds with ""well everything would have to be line of sight, or launching a ton of missles and hoping you hit something"".  Given the former, you'll want something that can handle close combat.  Now with actual Newtonian physics, melee is ridiculous -- it's like a fighter pilot high fiving another fighter pilot going the opposite direction... but maybe the mass is so great we can pretend it works.  And I suppose since radar doesn't work, ranged would be equally hard.  Thus if you have melee, you'll need something resembling arms.  If you build arms you might as well allow for interchangeable weapons.  I doubt any mobile suit would actually have five digits on the hand, but oh well.  Next you'll want to be able to dodge all of those missles (again, ridiculous if it was actually line of sight with Newtonian physics).  So you need a variety of thrust vectors.  And you also want to be able to surprise foes for close combat.  Hence you will want your thrust to be directional -- hence something resembling legs.  A traditional fighter likely has its thrust pointing in one direction, making it easy to predict.  Now it seems far more likely you'd have one leg on top of the head and one on the bottom for space combat, but a dual leg system also allows for easy mobility in gravity systems.  I do believe a ball system would be more efficient and more deadly if properly designed.  Combat often relies on minimizing profiles to reduce the odds of being hit.  But perhaps the technology constraints make minimum effective thrust require a larger chasis.   Plus I like that at the end of the day they have a variety of other types of weapons.  there are mobile armors with arms, ones with legs, ones with neither.  In reality it is hard to imagine the human form being anywhere near optimal, but I think Gundam comes closest to a believable explanation."
Gundam,3a91l9,OhUmHmm,10,Thu Jun 18 05:20:45 2015 UTC,"Another reason the give in universe is the AMBAC (Active Mass Balance Auto Correct) system, which uses micro movements of the MS limbs to maintain stability and orientation in space instead of burning fuel for every adjustment. This is expanded on in Zeta and after with the wing and tail binders on many suits, the thought being more limbs = better AMBAC. Another reason they use is trying to make the basic framework as multi purpose as possible, having a unit that can work in both space, inside a colony, and on a planetary surface is more logical than having a separate unit for each."
Gundam,3a91l9,poojokesarefunny,2,Thu Jun 18 06:56:03 2015 UTC,I forgot about AMBAC; that's another good point for why you might want mass outside of the core.
Gundam,3a91l9,OhUmHmm,3,Sat Jun 20 13:53:05 2015 UTC,"I very much agree with /u/OhUmHmm. To add to that, the principality of Zeon was a colony with a much smaller population, industrial capability and military force. So they really needed to maximize the potential capabilities of a single soldier and minimize any loses, which is counter to modern militarization which focuses on components and numbers to form an effective force.   Enter the mobile suit. A fighter that was equipped with a Minovsky reactor, pretty much a miniature nuclear engine, allowing it to sport heavier armor and a good number of verniers and thrusters. Thus allowing Zeon to achieve space dominance and wreck Federation ships which would naturally have difficulties hitting a target that constantly changed vectors. While the Feds needed to train perhaps 100 men to man a battleship, Zeon only need train 6 mobile suit pilots to combat a ship. That is, 2 3-man anti-ship squads, not counting the Salamis crew however that served more as a transport for the suits and then as supporting fire."
Gundam,3a91l9,Finishingtothesky,2,Thu Jun 18 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"If mobile suits truly relied on line of sight and nothing else, though, you'd think some of them would use Dazzle Camo instead of everything being bright primary colors. :P"
Gundam,3a91l9,0mni42,2,Fri Jun 19 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"Dazzle camouflage:       Dazzle camouflage, also known as razzle dazzle or dazzle painting, was a family of ship camouflage used extensively in World War I and to a lesser extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, interrupting and intersecting each other.  Unlike some other forms of camouflage, dazzle works, if at all, not by offering concealment but by making it difficult to estimate a target's range, speed and heading. Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that dazzle was intended more to mislead the enemy as to the correct position to take up than actually to miss his shot when firing.  Dazzle was adopted by the British Admiralty and the U.S. Navy with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships instantly recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes were tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved that it was impossible to determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.

However,  I think there are probably also a lot of times where it would be very difficult to see any mobile suits -- basically in the shadow of an asteroid, there should be very little ambient light and the suit is virtually invisible.  I think the placement of the sun and who is ""closer"" to the sun during the combat would play a large role as well -- if the sun is at my enemy's back, very little light would be reflected from his front, making it also very difficult to see him."

These particles completely mess/jam with electronic waves, meaning electronics-based guidance and targeting systems for ship based weapons are rendered useless.   Ultimately the Mobile Suit in the Universal Century comes into its own because of its capacity to carry battleship/cruiser level firepower while remaining incredibly mobile in space. By having the mobility of a cosmo-fighter with much more firepower, they become a niche in how to combat the space fleet tactics of the Federation.  Other alternative universes and series don't cover this to the same length that it is explained in the Universal Century. It should be noted too that in the novelization of the One Year War, Zeon's invasion of earth never happens because it was not the priority/point of Zeon going to war in the first place."
Gundam,3a91l9,OhUmHmm,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:21:48 2015 UTC,Oh yeah!  I forgot that the Minovsky particle was a byproduct of the fusion reactor and not something that ships willingly dispersed.

But what the human form is good at is moving and easily changing direction.  The only practical reason (aside from being super intimidating) of having humanoid weapons like that would be maneuverability on land (arms wouldn't help much in space, a ball would probably be perfect). However a 60 foot tall one would probably just be a big target for heavier weapons from smaller vehicles that are (since they aren't human shaped) capable of carrying larger weapons.  That said, a 15 foot tall exoskeleton or something could be pretty practical if it was maneuverable, and able to take cover behind common things (not many places a Gundam could take cover outside of cities and canyons).  That's my two cents anyway."

Gundam,3a91l9,destructoid17,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"There's Minovsky Particles. However that's not the only rationalization you can extrapolate. They'd be practical for space combat, mostly for destroying battleships easily with fewer resources/training than with another ship, and low gravity combat since you can carry battleship-level firepower on a chassis that can do repairs on ships and space construction. Combat on Earth is retarded and for entertainment purposes though, you could easily take them out by destroying the legs. They also take up a lot of resources but AMBAC make sure they don't use too much helium when flying. I like to think that forcing the Federation, which had limited resources, to produce a counter to the mobile suits was also a way of depleting Earth's resources."

The original concept for mobile suits in U.C basically evolved from human-like exoskeletons that were used for the construction of space colonies. Due to the introduction of minovsky particles, long range weapons were not nearly as useful as they used to be. Zeon took advantage of this and it worked out pretty well for them at the start of the war."

What I was asking about was the whole ""Silver Feet/Silver Legs"" attack that the Neros has. Why is it called that?

Gundam,3a84qm,ghostFOUR7,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:02:33 2015 UTC,Gundam ZZ gets REALLY good about 1/3 of the way through... there is an episode that is ingrained in every persons head about 1/3 of the way through the show where it changes the entire show. If you watch Brent Newall's Otaku No Video youtube channel we both had the same experience with that episode. No spoilers but you will know what episode it is when you get to it the drama is real.

Keep in mind this was back before you couldn't just buy DVDs of the old series to catch up and Gundam's primary demographic was boys 8-12. Boys who would've just been born in 1979 when the original aired. Its pretty logical to try and catch up your new viewers up to speed on who the hell Bright Noa, Kamile, Amuro and Char are."

Usually the techs are graded by ""handle time"" on conversations that largely deal with either billing or troubleshooting. These are the ""third type"" - a non-stressful time waster that can be ended or dragged out almost as long as the tech is willing - if they need a break from idiots complaining about bills and get this kind of call/chat they can chew the fat about tv shows and movies for a bit and make a happy customer or if they've had a ton of long complicated troubleshooting sessions and it's bringing up their average time for the day they can quickly make the request and get on to the next call having completely satisfied a customer in under 2 minutes to bring the average back down. It's win-win for the lucky person that gets you and your non-real-problem!"

Gundam,3a4okc,destructoid17,4,Wed Jun 17 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"I've wondered about that, myself.  It's possible they're intended to be magnified images, or strange wider viewing angle projections to eliminate blindspots in the 360-degree canopy (so that the pilot can effectively see behind him without turning around in his seat; similar to a car's rear-view mirrors), but their placement often looks too random to me, to be that.  It's probably something of the sort though; I can't imagine that it's accidental.   Perhaps the panoramic cockpit sensors look for abnormalities, and magnify that piece of the panoramic display to give the pilot a clearer view of what may be in that direction?"
Gundam,3a4okc,sdwoodchuck,2,Wed Jun 17 05:23:08 2015 UTC,think you can find a screenshot of what you're talking about?

Gundam,3a4okc,sdwoodchuck,5,Wed Jun 17 05:28:59 2015 UTC,"F91...Victory...and CCA...  Did you check Unicorn?  Because if this is a feature of the CG-Corrected 360 Cockpit, then it should show up on Unicorn (it being between F91 and CCA). And may also show up on Reconguista (but that's too far past Victory)  But if it doesn't then I'd chalk it up to humans getting tired of jotting in white ink every single time and just used triangles to make things easier.  I could check it myself in about 3-4hours though."
Gundam,3a4okc,CidImmacula,2,Wed Jun 17 09:13:02 2015 UTC,"I only know Victory for sure; the OP mentioned F91 and maybe CCA, but I haven't double-checked either of those yet.  If it's just Victory, then I'd agree it's possibly just lazy art (Victory has tons of it), but if it's in F91, then it's almost certainly got to be an intentional design choice, for whatever reason."
Gundam,3a4okc,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"on EP1, I could not see any of these triangles on the CG-Corrected Cockpits. Zooms are denoted by a circle zoom and lock-ons by rectangles.  I did, however, nearer the end, noticed some parts of ""space"" end up with small areas with no stars at all while panning around Kshtraya. The area is much smaller than the one in your screen and it's easier to miss.  I'd chalk it up to lazy art or the background artist's idea of how space looks like without atmosphere than it being a technological feature of the 360 Cockpit."
Gundam,3a4okc,CidImmacula,2,Wed Jun 17 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"Huh. I never noticed!   Yeah I think you're on the money with the zoom theory. I wouldn't be surprised if the top-right 2 circles were the same - the left being magnified of the right, and in the top-left of the screen the bottom circle is a magnification of the top.   EDIT: or are those just sweat bubbles because the character is emoting? I'd need to see animation of it. What episode of victory is this and about how far in?"
Gundam,3a4okc,SOLIDninja,3,Wed Jun 17 05:39:00 2015 UTC,"Those are definite emoting bubbles in that scene.  The specific shot I took is from episode 48, at shortly after 15:45"

Battle Operations is awesome but stupid in that they only let you play 3 matches a night without paying for more - and on top of that it takes for fricken EVER to get a game full enough to play for the 10 minuet round.   It's 2 hours in lobbies for 30 minuets of fun play time - then it asks for money. Infuriating.  I don't know if that's the way the new ps4 version works, but I have a sneaking suspicion it is."
Gundam,3a0m0u,SOLIDninja,2,Tue Jun 16 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"As far as the long lobby waits, I find it helps to get your timing right.  If you're in New York and you're playing GBO at 3:00PM, it's 4:00AM in Japan, so of course it's going to take FOREVER to fill a lobby, because everyone is asleep.

Cross Ange's universe is like a reaaaaally alternate version of the Cosmic Era.  I wouldn't be surprised if Fukuda decided to make a crossover movie/series between these two. It would be hilarious to watch.

Granted the first fight was really cool and some neat tactics. After that everything went downhill with ridiculous silly shit. Especially in part 2 when MC gets his own spechul abilities to be even more ridiculous.  Meanwhile in Gundam:  MC gets super special unit and is like ""OH NO! WHAT DO I DO! SHOULD I SWING MY SWORD OR SHOOT MY GUN?!?!"" and all the grunts are like ""SHOOT IT WITH OUR BB GUNS!"" Sir! The BB guns aren't working!"" ""Shoot it with MORE BB GUNS!"" because grunt logic.

Gundam,3a2oa1,sylpher250,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. As soon as you introduce a ""Stronger than the others"" unit, things become all one sided and ridiculous. You gotta keep a level playing field and have only ace pilots, not ace units."

Gundam,3a2oa1,CrashmanX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"Gurren Lagann didn't have that at all. Their ""even playing field"" was the MC's not knowing how strong they were.

Evangelion def does not have that either because the more Shinji cares about something, the stronger Shinji gets. Especially in the Rebuild movies this is evident."

It knows exactly what it is.  Also you realize Mirai Nikki was originally a Manga right? A manga which was pretty damn close to the anime. Also you just gonna ignore the 1st Full Metal Alchemist series? or Baka to Test?
Gundam,3a2oa1,Webemperor,-1,Tue Jun 16 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"I read manga during the anime airing. Changing the ending to be even more shittier doesn't help.   Also It doesn't know what it is. At one part you have this pink haired yandere girl stopping fucking throwing knives that this other girl is firing like a machine gun, while not even paying attention to the knives and just having an orgasm about how his bf complimented him. Then afterwards you have this scene where a girl gets gangraped by a cult. Then we go to this scene where a guy somehow has access to a telephone tower, that is in his plot, which he somehow has access to it. Then we go back to a scene where we see the main pink haired bitchqueen getting fed grass by his mother. It's like Elfen Lied to a sense all over again. It tries so hard to seem like an actual serious show but then you get stupid shit like this kid that never ever touched a girl in his life carrying this other chick bride-style while falling down a building by a parachute.  Also you know, the entirely unoriginal character designs."
Gundam,3a2oa1,CrashmanX,4,Tue Jun 16 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"Wow. You described like 8 or 9 separate episodes right there, if not more. It'd be different if all that happened in ONE episode or ONE movie, but it's over the course of many hours. But let me break this down:  Yuno is OP as hell because she's done this at least twice now. This is a minimum of her 3rd time doing this. In one instance she literally had eternity to sit there and contemplate and do whatever she wanted. So her being insane and ridiculously strong or knowing what's going to happen, is of no surprise.   As far as the gangbang, yea her situation is fucked up. I've got nothing for that one besides fucked up shit happens in the world. Is it unrealistic? For modern day Japan sure, but other parts of the world? Not so much.  Dude getting access to a telephone tower, you'd be surprised at how easy things are to get into if you know what you're doing and you're physically hacking in and not via software. Though I can't recall the exact scene you're talking about or whom.  Yuno being fed grass by her parents is because her parents were literally insane. I'm not sure what's hard to grasp about that one. Also happens in an entirely different episode.  ""Kid that never ever touched a girl in his life carrying this other chick bride-style while falling down a building by a parachute.""   Are you talking about Yuuki carrying Yuno down or someone else? Because in either case you're not only blowing things out of proportion but going over the top even more than the show.  Mirai Nikki (and Aldnoah for that matter) aren't shows that you watch seriously and think ""Yea, this is great! This is some next level writing!"" rather they're shows you watch and enjoy because it's ridiculous and insane. Aldnoah less so because they studio wanted it to be ""The Gundam Killer"" and they though it was serious and cool when it was just awful with Deus Ex MC killing any and all tension.  Lastly, if you read the Manga while it was airing then you'd know the screen writer had little (if anything) to do with the plot issues which you're describing. The Screen Writer merely adapts the series so animators and voice actors can create the scenes. Given that there were few changes from the Manga, exception of the ending, it's the actual writing you should take issue with not the Screen Writing. Change your focus to that of the author, Sakae Esuno."

Because in either case you're not only blowing things out of proportion but going over the top even more than the show.   I'm talking about the scene which Yukki jumped down the tower building with the parachute, the same episode Yukki learn his father was an asshat.

The problem is this: Mirai Nikki doesn't know what it is, or what it wants to be. Is it an over-the-top action show with this cute yandere girl? Or is it this gritty, grim dark show about a battle royale style tourney thing? It's Revenge of the Sith all over again, the writer has no idea what the fuck is the tone in the show. This disparity of tone, followed by unreal standarts and events happening in the shows world that makes it seem like the show is throwing this grim dark events, not because it wants to tell an engaging story, not because it tries to make the world seem more realistic, AND ESPECIALLY not because it wants you to symphatize with the characters, but because it wants to seem more serious, thinking that it's bad for a show to be balls to the walls action, without any dark or grit.   Also, making an adaptation doesn't mean that you can't change the show for the better. Biggest examples are Shingeki no Bahamut, Haruhi and K-on. But changing the ending so that you can cashgrab on the OVA you are gonna release later on is just weak.   And for the record, Aldnoah is absolute garbage too."

And what does not having friends have to do with any of that? How does that factor in? What because he carried Yuno? I'm pretty sure all of his actions in that episode were planned out too, so he would've rehearsed them or asked Yuno about them.   but somehow has no problem carrying Yuno like that.   Have you ever carried a girl like that? Center of gravity yo.   The problem is this: Mirai Nikki doesn't know what it is, or what it wants to be. Is it an over-the-top action show with this cute yandere girl? Or is it this gritty, grim dark show about a battle royale style tourney thing?   What is Over the top grit + Yandere girl? Did I answer the question correctly Trebeck? It's an edge series, what about that is hard to understand, or have you never seen an edge series? If not, go watch Valvrave.   It's Revenge of the Sith all over again, the writer has no idea what the fuck is the tone in the show.   RotS was ""OH SHIT! I need to tie up these loose ends! FUCK FUCK FUCK! GOTTA MAKE IT COOL! FUCK WROTE MYSELF INTO A CORNER!"" Mirai Nikki didn't have to worry about that.   This disparity of tone, followed by unreal standarts and events happening in the shows world that makes it seem like the show is throwing this grim dark events, not because it wants to tell an engaging story, not because it tries to make the world seem more realistic, AND ESPECIALLY not because it wants you to symphatize with the characters, but because it wants to seem more serious, thinking that it's bad for a show to be balls to the walls action, without any dark or grit.   You sure do know exactly what the writer was thinking. Are you sure you didn't write this show? Are you sure you even understand what the word tone means? Because the tone only really changes during the episode in which Yuuki and Yuno go swimming where it become light hearted. That episode aside, it stays pretty grim for the tone. Sparks of calm or otherwise do not change a show's tone entirely, rather they're just that. Sparks of calm. The calm before the storm. Etc. You'll notice any show that is considered to be truly grim doesn't do it by being brutal. No that's just brutality. Grim comes from things being good, then turning to shit real fast. In order to keep that turning to shit you have to have things go back to good at some point, at least semi-good. Then when the viewer suspects the least, it goes grim again. Hence why a Song of Ice and Fire is considered to be an especially grim series. As you start to relax and enjoy things, suddenly someone gets killed and the whole plot starts rolling again. Straining the viewer or reader along. You also have to remember that Mirai Nikki was a manga, one which kept readers coming back with WTF moments and ""What's going to happen next?"" moments. Which works quite well in a weekly/monthly series. So these are again, of no surprise.    Also, making an adaptation doesn't mean that you can't change the show for the better.    When you're the screen writer, it means you have little say. It's the director and lead writers who get the say and the producers usually get the ultimate say.   But changing the ending so that you can cashgrab on the OVA you are gonna release later on is just weak.   Ah. So it's salt. Gotcha. You're upset you put time into this series, got invested in it, then it didn't turn out how you wanted so now you're mad. KK bro.   And for the record, Aldnoah is absolute garbage too.   Well duh. But  it's garbage for different reasons."
Gundam,3a2oa1,Webemperor,-1,Tue Jun 16 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"She was also a literal god so I mean...   She didn't do any godlike things in the show. And since we are on this topic, the fact that Yuno went back in time, and didn't do anything that could allow her to win the tourney instantly is pretty stupid in it's own right.   What is simplification for the sake of plot? Really though, you're upset about that in a show about cellphones being able to predict the future? How do you even watch Mecha series and not shit yourself over the square cubed law being broken constantly?   Because all the physics laws bullshits in Mecha series are things you can easily overlook. But in a show like Mirai Nikki, where show, time and time again tries to one up itself, by trying to be more serious, more edgy and more dark, reaching to the point where it has to break the borders or reality to do the thing.   Man, you really are Major Buzzkill aren't you? You're bothered by THAT shit? Not the fact that ya know the whole building was collapsing, not the fact that they were able to murder how many people?

I'm pretty sure all of his actions in that episode were planned out too, so he would've rehearsed them or asked Yuno about them.   The point is we are talking about a kid, that due to pure loneliness, started to imagine shit. But later on he can do what I mentioned earlier. And that's just an example. There is so many illogical and senseless shit going on that you are disconnected with the show. It also doesn't help that show, everytime it shows some fucked up shit, tries to one-up itself, which causes you to get destrelized(I dont even know if thats the right word for it.). I guess rather than an example, I could just list all of the stupid shit in the show. It's just half the time, show tells you to close your head, and the other times it tries to be logical, by having people use their Diaries in tactical ways, followed closely by Yuno doing some badass shit to destroy all the tension.   Ah. So it's salt. Gotcha. You're upset you put time into this series, got invested in it, then it didn't turn out how you wanted so now you're mad. KK bro.   Nah, trust me, it's not that. I watched Mirai Nikki twice actually. First was a few months after show was finished, and at that time I found show amazing. Afterwards, like, a year or later, I decided to watch the show with a close friend, who was just getting in to anime, at the same time I decided to read the manga while watching it. While me and her were watching, I realized how much this show didn't made any sense. Why the fuck is Deus dying? Why the fuck is Murmur there? Why the fuck is this being, who is pretty much established to be God of space and time, rather than logical people, I dont know, somekind of scientists, or philosophers, or well-known philanthorpists, find fucking BATSHIT INSANE PEOPLE, to replace him, in a fucking battle royale. And this guy is apparently the god of space and time. He even says that he thinks Yukki will win, somehow, not being aware Yuno is helping her. what the actual fuck. how the fuck does god not know this. how.   The problem is not that Mirai Nikki doesn't makes sense and is over-the-top, I'm saying this as a person that thinks Black Lagoon as top 10 best anime ever. But for that to work, you need not to take yourself seriously. Which Nikki didn't. It had a lot of times when show tried to be serious and realistic, which caused all this stupid shit that stayed under the water, come slowly to the surface, causing you to realize that. I guess all my problems with the show boils down to that. It was a show that didn't made any sense for the sake of over-the-topness but then tried to take itself waaay too seriously followed by getting stuck in it's own pants, falling flat on it's face and breaking it's neck in the process. I mean, I kinda has fun while watching it, mostly because I watched it with a friend and also liked the terrorrist chick. The fact that after episode 8-9 or so we decided to watch it half-drunk helped too I guess."
Gundam,3a2oa1,CaptainAmeijin,2,Tue Jun 16 23:24:26 2015 UTC,"Aldnoah.Zero is great in concept and definitely started out well, but man, it drops off hard. I can't blame you for feeling hype at the beginning because I was pushing it like everyone else up to ep 7 or 8, but by then it started becoming less and less interesting and by the S1 finale it just became unbearable.   It's like you have a bunch of awful grunt pilots given free reign over a Gundam, except that they don't have protagonist powers and never get any better. Then, you have a newtype (Inaho...) with a grunt suit who bests them with ease because they have glaring design flaws and, well, he's the only competent character in the series apparently.  I'm trying not to spoil too much for you but I think you should probably be let down gently, because the fights drop off after the very first one and only occasionally near its complexity. I feel like the story would have been much more powerful if the rest of Inaho's team were given a greater role in the series and battles."
Gundam,3a1ckf,AleksVin,2,Tue Jun 16 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean Dynasty Warriors Gundam Reborn? To be completely honest, the gameplay for Dynasty Warriors-style games isn't particularly complicated. It's a pretty simple hack-and-slash style game.  I guess my two cents would be to spend some time learning to block effectively, and dodge like a maniac when your enemies are overpowering you."
Gundam,3a1ckf,AVestedInterest,2,Tue Jun 16 14:05:49 2015 UTC,So there are no complicated combinations regarding the attacks?
Gundam,3a1ckf,AVestedInterest,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"There are two attack buttons: Normal attack and Charge attack. A charge attack branches off from a normal attack, but generally executing a charge attack will end your combo. On most mobile suits, which charge attack you execute will be dependent on how many normal attacks came before it.  For example:  C1  N1 -> C2  N1 -> N2 -> C3  In which C1 fires the beam rifle, C2 impales the enemy on a beam saber, C3 causes a sweep attack, etc.  Variations do exist, but the tutorials ought to cover most everything you need, and more advanced and stuff you probably won't be needing until you start getting to really high level missions."

Gundam,3a1ckf,LightningEagle7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"The game tells you this in tutorials I believe, but just don't forget that you can take out battleships by hovering in the air (R1 while jumping) and then shooting the ship with a Charged up Range attack (Triangle). This will cause the ship to drop troops and often times a bombardier. Taking them out will allow you to drop a battleship's health much faster than by just waiting for it to poop out mobile suits.  Also, don't worry about saving up your Special attacks (Circle). I personally prefer to use my special attacks often to clear out fields quickly, since mission objectives can sometimes come at you lightning fast. Ideally you should be wiping out enemies fast enough to recharge your special meter to allow you to spam it without worrying too much about having to save it against enemy aces."

Gundam,3a1ckf,LightningEagle7,2,Tue Jun 16 21:03:57 2015 UTC,FA Unicorn is honestly amazingly fun. The fact it's moves switch every time you do a specific charge attack so it vent's weapons is...pretty unique given most suits get one moveset and they're just gonna do that all day.

Gundam,39zoph,CrashmanX,2,Tue Jun 16 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"1) Zeta: Bigger, better and absolutely epic with various factions, ideologies and characters. The whole Gundam universe is fully realised to its potential with this series 2) Unicorn: What lacks in episodes makes up with insanely great quality production values. A visual eye-candy with intricate storyline and great characters. 3) 00 (Season 1 only): Manages to avoid common Gundam tropes to stand on its own and has interesting post-9/11 politics (Love some bit of politics). If you watch on HD, you will be amazed! 4) 0079: The story ages very well, same can't be said for the animation, and has a deep and engaging lore. Characters are well developed and it will leave you hooked 5) 08th: Gritty and realistic, it is nice to see the battle in the shoes of an ordinary soldier. Having a fallible main characters makes it a gutsy story telling and the animation is superb. 6) Build Fighters: Just because it is different doesn't mean it is crap; it can actually tell an interesting point of view. Filled with fanservice (figuratively and literally), this series also did not compromise on epic battles. This show hits our inner child with full effect. 7) Turn A: The initial slow plot prevents it from being Top 5 but the second-half become incredibly epic. A well written character-driven series manages to shut-up those annoying weaboos who can't bother to watch because of the design. 8) 0080: It is a timeless story as it tells a very human story on the brutal but honest realities of war. The ending has to be the most justifiably depressing, and with little hope for peace 9) G Gundam: Replaces deep themes with awesomeness. It is such a fun show (provided if you not take it seriously), with colorful characters and manly fighting scene. It is absolutely charming with its over the top actions 10) Char's Counterattack: Ending the epic rivalry on a high note. An entertaining space opera filled with epic MS fights and conflicting ideologies, this is what we hoped for a movie."

He fights on the enemy's side but is respected by the protagonist and has a very close relationship with an important female character on the player's side (in this case, it's love). But he remains loyal to the enemy side and must be killed.   But surprise! He's not dead. In the second game (a side story and pseudo-sequel to the first game) he shows up again. This time under the name Zeke. However, the test of the game isn't important in context of this topic so I'll move on.  In the third game (which is a direct sequel to the first), Camus shows up again. This time, he wears a mask and has assumed the name 'Sirius'. He also fights on the player's side instead of being an enemy. The mask is what really seals the deal. Predictably, almost no one recognised him despite wearing the same clothes and just adding a mask. A true Char Clone.  Here's a picture comparison, using sprites from the DS remakes of the first and third game.  Camus  Sirius"

Adventure Time - Fiona and Cake sub-universe series episode ""The Prince Who Wanted Everything""  After running away from Lumpy Space to the Land of Ooo, the character ""Lumpy Space Prince"" briefly bears a visual resemblance to Char Aznable wearing a helmet and mask as well as an epaulet'd uniform with a firebird-like symbol on its chest.  Steven Universe  No direct Gundam references in SU yet to my knowledge beyond Garnet's Quattro Bajeena glasses and red outfit - this reference is further supported by the fact that storyboard artist Katie Mitroff drew Garnet as Char Aznable(with Amethyst as Captain Harlock and Pearl as a character I can't identify) for a zine made by the production staff prior to the show’s premiere.  -I'll update this as I think of more-"

Gundam,39vpu8,SOLIDninja,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:13:00 2015 UTC,You could even digitize these manuals and put them in the sim as reading material for the cockpit screens in your simulation. Just make sure to credit that guy and his blog as the translator - he's worked hard and for a long time translating those (2009 to 2015)
Gundam,39vpu8,SOLIDninja,2,Mon Jun 15 15:47:40 2015 UTC,"I'm documenting all the sources I pull information from. Any person, group, or alias that should be credited will be credited.   As the pre-alpha version is being developed right now I'm using the Exia to start things off.  I'm using actual measurements to size things 1:1  It doesn't have a functioning cockpit yet. Right now the demo consists of a very basic hangar with bad textures and the Exia standing against a wall.  I should add that I only started this 4 months ago and Im' one person. If you look at some images for star Citizen, that should give some people an idea of how long this is going to take.  I'm not going to spend years of my life on this.   Once I get it to the point where the basic systems are in place. I intend to open it up to the general public.   People who the skills to do so could model mobile suits and their cockpits to scale and then submit them for review (to make sure their as accurate as possible and will work with the program)  I simply won't have the time to model and texture every mobile suit, weapon, and accessory at 1:1 with Photo-real quality.  At the very least, people will be able to walk up to the Exia and get into it and feel awesome."
Gundam,39vpu8,SOLIDninja,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:53:11 2015 UTC,"Hm. I'm not sure the availability of exia cockpit info. How much work did you put into the exia already and do you have your heart set on it? You might find it easier to start with a suit that has a well documented interior and then build the machine around that like a Zaku.  As of right now what you want to do's been done by M.A.D.N.U.G in Unity engine already. It's rough around the edges but it's White Base's hangar, the ship, space around it, and the RX-78-2. You start as a pilot in the hangar and can explore that way or float to the cockpit, hit a button to enter, then inside the cockpit every button is pressable and the gundam is controllable."
Gundam,39vpu8,saxxybeast,2,Tue Jun 16 00:06:08 2015 UTC,I hadn't heard of MADNUG. It seem to be pretty much what I'm going for.  The few videos available for it are slightly below the quality of where I'm at right now. (those are really old videos though so they could be way farther if its' still being developed)  I have the EXIA fully modeled including the cockpit. It needs multiple details passes. And you can't go into space .  If I jump around too much I'll never get anything done so I'll finish the Exia first before I move on to anything else.  Your links really helped and I've been scouring the internet for issues of Gundam Fact File and other such magazines.  They've been a great wealth of information. I can read Japanese so the info they have is great.  I might do full space ships later on but before I expand the over-all vision I'll be sticking with a sealed hangar and a gundam in it. Once I have that system in place I can expand upon it and do more as time permits.
Gundam,39vpu8,WaywardMetroid,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:08:30 2015 UTC,Word. What are you building it in?

Gundam,39w2pg,dattroll123,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:24:39 2015 UTC,I think one plot reason the Wing Zero wasn't in that fight was the fact that there was no way it could destroy a Serpent and not the Pilot with its Buster Rifles.
Gundam,39w2pg,AkiZayoi,5,Sun Jun 21 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"The best pacifism in Gundam is the pacifism that doesn't happen on the battlefield at all.  In Gundam 00, the pilots are dedicated to their anti-war stance, and are well aware of the hypocrisy involved in violently enforcing nonviolence.  They wouldn't be considered pacifist, but they're fighting toward (hopeful) global pacifism in the future.  That's probably the closest that Gundam has gotten to doing pacifism right.  Otherwise, characters who see warfare and give it up afterward are also good examples.    The worst are definitely the ""I'm going to shoot at guys in a hopefully non-lethal way"" or otherwise dedicated mobile suit pilots entering fights and trying to be battlefield pacifists.  The Wing pilots, Banagher in Unicorn, Kira in SEED, and several others are all guilty of this, and it stinks.    I always find it interesting that the first two kills in Gundam demonstrate the conflict of killing in a much more interesting and dramatic way than most since.  The first Zaku Amuro takes down explodes, causing major damage to the colony.  The pilot dies in the process, of course, but the pilot's death is more incidental to the destruction of the enemy weapon, which it should be noted, was also fleeing.  The second Zaku was an aggressor, and Amuro opted to kill the pilot and only the pilot rather than causing further damage.  The death of the pilot in this case is much more pronounced (even as passively as its handled), and it's much more clearly a decision to kill a person as opposed to destroying an enemy object."
Gundam,39w2pg,RJWalker,3,Tue Jun 16 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"I wish they would stop with the pacifism themes in Gundam. It's a unrealistically stupid concept.  War is supposed to be violent and brutal.  When you are fighting on the battlefield, things are very chaotic and with your adrenaline pumping, fighting to not kill will be the last thing on your mind."
Gundam,39w2pg,NeonLightIllusion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:11:48 2015 UTC,Its why Amuro is a great non pacifist post 0079. He just gave up on trying not to kill after some tike and became a loyal soldier to whomever fought for a cause he though was right. No other Main Pilot fought until they actually died (Since his Ghost was in Unicorn) like he did.
Gundam,39w2pg,Brenticus302,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"Despite what others will claim, SEED did it right. Kira's development towards pacifism is present from his first kill. It wasn't a sudden 180 like how many people falsely say. He would agonise over having to kill.  There's the one time where rage and brief gets the best of him and he and Athrun almost kill each other. Lacus is no fool. She only gives him the Freedom when she truly sees his resolve to stop the senseless fighting. And with the Freedom, Kira now has a machine that allows him to uphold his desire to not kill. Even the whole 'stopping war by fighting' hypocrisy is addressed by Lacus herself. ""The choices we're making may be one of evil as well. For we call for peace, but with weapons in our hands. Nevertheless allow us to break this chain of endless conflict. Give us strength."" It's only Destiny that drops the ball on this."
Gundam,39w2pg,Brenticus302,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"I always assumed the Reconguista's attitude towards pacifism was the best- fight if you need to, kill if you need to, but always keep your eye on the bigger picture of stopping the war/violence politically."
Gundam,39w2pg,Char_X_3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:27:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure it's possible to do completely non-lethal violence in Gundam.  Because it's pretty hard to have high level of violence and power and not risk death.  MS are full of all sorts of explody stuff and wires and power sources and stuff to set off said explody stuff.  All that stuff keeps the MS stable.  So maybe you just cut off a leg, but maybe it's in a way that something gets twisted, it's leaking fuel or some sort of propellant, an exposed wire sets something off.  And now we have a dead pilot and MS.  And with humans its even more difficult.  There's stuff that can kill you all over your body.  Shot in the leg?  Whoops, femoral artery.  Bit your tongue after someone shoved you?  Ooops, huge artery in your tongue.  Using giant laser swords and stuff is a lethal choice.  You're just hoping for the best, but it's not designed for that...and it's really easy to go wrong.  I don't think you can do non-lethal ""right"" without some sort of special weapon, like a Gundam Taser or some sort of virus or low-energy laser that melts joints or...something.  That's what I think of all the pacifism action stuff anyway."

Gundam,39w2pg,AkiZayoi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:40:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is a possible, believable, or good idea to do pacifism in traditional Gundam series in the same way you do in video games. Because for scenarios in games like Deus Ex, Thief, Hitman and Dishonored, you are usually one person fighting against a group of people and so the only one who would be killing all the guards, police, securities would be you and you alone; whereas in Gundam, the protagonist is usually in the middle of a war where there are thousands of enemies trying to kill you you also happens to have thousands of people by your side trying to kill them, if you don't kill your enemy, someone would. Does anyone else honestly believe all those pilots who got their suit disabled by Kira would actually survive? That ZAFT or whoever would risk more lives just to enter ORB territory once again and search for survivors?   Pacifism works in games because your end goal is not killing your enemy, but to reach some other objectives through whatever methods or means, so it offer choices for players to decide. Pacifism is stupid in Gundam because the whole reason war broke out because the exact means to reach that objective is to kill your enemy (at least, that's what politicians has decided); basically, Kira gets called out for trying to do Pacifism because he does so even when he knows full well he is playing Call of Duty, whereas it works a lot better in the context for Endless Waltz and thus receive less flakes.  The message many Gundam series wants to deliver is that war in itself will bring tragedy no matter what and you should avoid using war as a mean, not how to avoid killing people after you have decided to war."

Gundam,39sogk,Nasjere,14,Sun Jun 14 11:23:28 2015 UTC,Netflix has lots of anime with both subs and dubs.  The main issue is licensing and money. Asking nicely en masse isn't going to help.
Gundam,39sogk,r0botosaurus,2,Sun Jun 14 12:40:48 2015 UTC,"As I recall the current issue is that one company has the rights to air gundam and another has the rights to distribute it for sale. Sunrise and RightStuff I think, Someone feel free to correct me."
Gundam,39sogk,Conrii,2,Mon Jun 15 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"I swear to god I just need to create a FAQ for everyone asking about this since I seem to be the only one who actually looked and asked for information on this shit.   RightStuf has distribution rights for the ENTIRE franchise, yes that includes previously UNRELEASED series such as Turn-A that was just released AND they've said as much on Twitter that Gundam X, Victory and ZZ are coming as well. This means that official subtitles for Victory and X are coming. But no Dub as Righstuf normally doesn't do Dubs, especially for older titles. Origin is an exception because Sunrise is handling the Dub themselves and paying out of pocket for the Dub.  Sunrise has retained control of the franchise's Broadcast rights. Meaning any foreign airing will have to be bought DIRECTLY from Sunrise and if the indications from Jason Demarco the head of Programming for Toonami's words are any indication they're asking quite a bit for it 2-3 times more than anything Toonami normally pays for a show."
Gundam,39sogk,MS14JG-2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"I should have elaborated on why it was a issue.

I mentioned Rightstuff because I'm not sure where distribution of the physical media for rental falls."
Gundam,39sogk,Conrii,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:02:16 2015 UTC,"Sunrise is the original creator and license holder for Gundam along with Bandai. Somebody would need to licence the rights to air the show from them. AFAIK nobody currently has any such rights. Rightstuff isn't actually a licensee so much as a distributor. Essentially, Sunrise/Bandai is dealing with them directly to release the DVDs, without any US licence-holders as middlemen, so there would be nobody to bargain with for TV or streaming services in the first place, unless Netflix were to deal with Sunrise/Bandai directly."

Gundam,39u3ru,AleksVin,2,Tue Jun 16 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"This is an outline I post over-and-over again. I'll call it:  ~The Late Universal Century Revitalization Plan~  Fans' souls are weighed down by the Early UC's gravity. Gundam must move into the Late UC to survive; while pandering to old-school Gundam and Unicorn sensibilities with Beltorchika's Children, it can be used as a launching platform to move, step-by-step, into the Late UC.   Beltorchika's Children (OVA or film) should appeal to everyone. Hathaway's ending naturally sets up for... Hathaway's Flash (OVA); still has that Early UC feel, and the iconic Bright Noa. Apparently the Crossbone Vanguard was formed the year after this story's end. Perhaps a tiny subplot could be added, where we see the Ronahs and Buch Concern reacting to the actions of Mufti and the Federation, leading to an... F91 remake and/or continuation (OVA or 2-cour series); concluding the F91 story after Iron Mask's death, perhaps with the disappearance of the Mother Vanguard. Followed, of course, with... Crossbone Gundam (2- or 4-cour series), Crossbone Gundam: Skull Heart (OVA or ""special episodes""), Crossbone Gundam: Steel Seven (film), and Crossbone Gundam: Ghost (OVA or 2-cour series), which sparks interest in the setting of a... The Origin-style remake of Victory Gundam (films or OVA); /u/sdwoodchuck has a similar idea. I'm thinking something like... Mobile Suit Gundam The Victory I: Blue-eyed Üsso? Followed by II: Sorrowful Shakti, and eventually a... Victory Gundam sequel (2- or 4-cour series), circa UC 0168. Even after Zanscare's fall, the Federation continues to lose control over the colonies. This increasing insecurity and fear of Spacenoids will lead to the creation of the Man-Hunting Attachment, the villains of... Gaia Gear (OVA), slightly updated to fit into the current Late UC. The same year this story ends, in UC 0203, construction of Side 8, or Gaia, begins, which plays a central role in... an animated ""redemption"" of G-Saviour (2- or 4-cour series or OVA), the infamous film. The plot of the film would only be the first episode or two, and afterwards, it would evolve into something of its own. Next, something set decades or centuries after G-Saviour, but still prior to the Regild Century."

I've for various reasons, lost 3 separate opportunities to visit parts of Japan in the last decade. It's still on my bucket list. The thing is, is that the longer I have to wait, it feels like the childhood dream slowly fades into a bit of disinterest, and into a sort of quasi-out of the loop feeling. I used to try and keep up with a lot of what was going on over there; who was famous, what was popular, even who was the prime minister and such. Now, its like, even if I do get to go, I guess I kind of feel like in a way I've missed the window for it being the best it could be. I know that's silly, and that it would still be a blast, but on the same token, when you have that carrot on a stick dangling in front of you and spurring you forward, eventually, that carrot will start to look a little less tasty.    Sorry for completely going off subject and on a tangent. For what ever reason, I've had a lot of stuff completely slapping me in the face with 90s nostalgia lately.

Gundam,39p4sf,pat5556,14,Sat Jun 13 14:24:46 2015 UTC,These designs are totally out of place in the established aesthetic of 0096.

By which I mean these look like a mashup of designs from Reconguista and Unicorn.  I mean come on, G-First?  And the worst part is?  I'd love these designs, but they just don't fit!  Also, the turbonerd in me is annoyed at their model numbers.  There's a reasonably well established system, but they're just like, ""lol, whatevs!""  In fact, that's kind of the whole thing that's bugging me, it's like they said, ""Hey, interns, make a new Universal Century Gundam and some supporting units,"" and the interns said, ""lol, whatevs!"""
Gundam,39p4sf,PirateLincoln,3,Sat Jun 13 16:38:25 2015 UTC,They look fine.  Its a throw back to the more classic UC designs.  I see a lot of ZZ insperation.
Gundam,39p4sf,LightningEagle7,2,Sat Jun 13 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"They look fine. Its a throw back to the more classic UC designs.   Problem is, Unicorn already established what throwback designs are supposed to look like as of UC 0096.  This stuff looks more at home in the UC 0110s or 0120s."
Gundam,39p4sf,rms141,3,Sat Jun 13 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"Isn't that the point, to look like something from future series so we can link them from a mechanical point of view?"
Gundam,39p4sf,LightningEagle7,2,Sat Jun 13 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"There is no clean, graduating line from the mechanical design of the 0093-96 time frame and UC 0123. And it's very difficult to make one: there are at least three major changes in mobile suit development and philosophy in the 30 year gap between CCA and F91.  Consider the Guntank R-44 in F91. This mobile suit, which has never been seen deployed in combat in any chronological entry prior to UC 0123, is considered ancient and unsuitable for combat by then. So if we haven't even advanced far enough after 0093 to see the R-44 in action, you're telling me that an out-of-place manga set in 0096 is going to fill a 27 year development gap? Doubt it. Highly.  There's no need to create a smooth development timeline between 0093 and 0123. The shift from Anaheim to SNRI is enough of a reason to account for the differences, let alone the shift to miniaturization and the virtual elimination of the movable frame."
Gundam,39p4sf,rms141,3,Sun Jun 14 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"Do you not see the similarities between the G-First's head and the cross-bone?  Nor its similarities to the ZZ?And the Guntank R-44 is based off of the D-50C Loto, which sees's combat in Unicorn.  (Also, I think its the first MS  we see from the SNRI in use).  For the record, I'm not saying it's going to fill the gap completely... just close it a bit."
Gundam,39p4sf,LightningEagle7,0,Sun Jun 14 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"The credibility killer is that these designs are set in 0096. If these were set after Hathaway's Flash in UC 0105, they'd be more palatable.  Technically, though, these designs shouldn't even exist. The Federation greatly slowed down its mobile suit development after the Second Neo-Zeon War. Unicorn compensated for that by having both the EFSF and the Zeon remnants using salvaged mobile suits supplemented by a smattering of test/upgraded mobile suits.  By the way, claiming that the G-First is a direct ancestor of the Crossbone is a little silly, considering the Crossbone did not roll off the assembly line looking like that. The F97 was customized by the Crossbone Vanguard after receipt from the SNRI. There is no F97 line art, so it's a little disingenuous to say the G-First is a link to something that was highly modified 30+ years later. The Crossbone Vanguard were assuredly NOT thinking about the G-First when disguising the F97's heritage."
Gundam,39p4sf,rms141,3,Sun Jun 14 22:57:38 2015 UTC,"You are once again taking my words out of context man... I said the head was similar, no where did I assert it was a direct ancestor.  Your words, not mine.  Like I said at the end of my last post, these designs aren't meant to fill the gap between 0096 and later UC designs, just close it a bit."

And the ship is....really boxy and squished, like someone stepped on the white base.   Kinda like the Zuom's though. Looks sorta Dom-ish."
Gundam,39p4sf,KaziArmada,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:51:31 2015 UTC,Perhaps; I'd have said it would be a better look if set between ZZ and Char's Counterattack; the G-First looks like a cross between ZZ and Nu. The GF-Tank though is very clearly just a Loto with folded wings.

Gundam,39p4sf,rms141,4,Sun Jun 14 03:52:05 2015 UTC,What is this? I've never seen this before. The Gundam looks like a mix of a mobile suit from G-Reco and ZZ.

The Guntank and the Guncannon are obviously designed for the sake of continuity to link early UC with late UC, and I'm all for that. The Zuom is another nice design, but sort of alone in that it doesn't seem to really have any late UC counterpart.  And I liked the G-First the minute I saw it a few months ago. It's like a sleeker redesign of the BFT ZZ kit. Not as lanky, but still just as streamlined, versus the regular ZZ's enormous bulk. I think it's brilliant, but does look a little out of place, aesthetically speaking. Not too farfetched, but a little. Then again, it's not that outlandish, considering that mobile suits like the Xi exist around this time."

It wasn't until the MG came along and do some redesign that started to bring some popularity back, and even then sales number for the whole series is hardly on par with Seed, only the MG strike line alone amounts almost as much as Destiny's whole line up.

Gundam,39p8rj,Walla_Walla_Megaton,2,Sat Jun 13 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"SEED: I want to say there's a lot of good in SEED, but there is a lot of bad as well. The first thirty-some episodes are solid as rock (except when the show starts going on about ORB) and quite frankly, if the show had continued on like that I would consider it superior to 0079.  Then, Morosawa rewrote what she had planned for the final act. I know, they did that in order to say thank you to the fans for making the show such a success but everything after Kira descends to JOSH-A is inferior to what came before it. It's just bad and feels out of place with the first half and Gundam as a whole. Let me say, G Gundam comes across as less of a super robot show than SEED's final act (allegedly director Mitsuo Fukuda said he wanted to bring Gundam back to it's roots, alongside shows like Combattler V. You know, the stuff 0079 was trying to break away from). There's still some good in it, but the show shot itself in the foot when it went off script.  But hey, it still had some great music and Flay is one of my favorite characters in all of Gundam. I'd give it a 6/10, 7 after watching Destiny and I start looking back at SEED more fondly.  Destiny: ...oh where do I begin. You ever read Greg Sestero's account of working on The Room? If not, go read The Disaster Artist. It's something like that and honestly, more interesting than the show itself.   The show had a shitty production behind the scenes and it affected the show. Late scripts, Morosawa being an inexperienced writer but deciding to write the scripts for every episode of a weekly show, the director not taking things seriously, staff disputes, you get the idea.   It dragged the show down, and it dragged it down hard. The show couldn't bring in new viewers, was alienating a sizable segment of the Gundam community, Stargazer underperformed and kits weren't selling. The show decided to once again cater to the SEED fans by deciding to make Kira the star again, but that was the final nail in the coffin. In the end, Sunrise/Bandai learned that SEED wasn't making new Gundam fans, it was making Kira fans.  (So, would you say Kira killed the future?)  As for the kits, how should I put this? If we didn't have Build Fighters showing off customized suits from previous Gundam shows, Destiny would be the next best thing."
Gundam,39p8rj,Char_X_3,3,Sat Jun 13 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"I want to preface by saying that, both series have their merits and are by no means completely unwatchable.  That said, they are definitely not highly ranked on my order of preference.   At its core, the Cosmic Era is a rehashing of the Universal Century meaning that it will be continually compared and evaluated against the longest and best constructed Gundam timeline (IMO). When judged by this standard, I find it inferior to the UC in most categories (Plot, characters, MS designs, Newtype/Coordinator theory, setting).  I could spend all day drawing comparisons, but I just didn't care about the Zaft/Alliance conflict nearly as much as the Zeon/Federation one.  On this same note, Destiny is really bad about introducing a copied UC mobile suit (Zaku, Gouf, Hiyaku Shiki, Zeta, Dom ect.) and then never showing it again, or relegating it to 5 second cameos.  It really felt like Sunrise was trying to throw in as many UC references as possible in hopes that the audience would respond to it, but it just felt like they were trying to stuff as many mech designs in Destiny as possible to sell as many different Gunpla kits as possible.   On another note, SEED and Destiny are littered with plot holes and Deus Ex Machina.  From Kira's god tier plot armor, to the very nature of coordinators being man made and always superior to naturals, there really wasn't much tension in the series, as we always knew what was going to happen (hint: jesus yamato saves the day).  This whole argument may stem from my deep hatred for Kira and Lacus, but I just couldn't get over their holier than thou attitude, even though their actions are very questionable IMO.  As a side note, the SEED factor is never well explained or as interesting as variants from other universes (newtype powers, super mode, Zero/Epyon system, trans-am, flash system) because it didn't require character development to activate, nor was it a vital plot point (which seems weird since that is the title of the show).     However, my biggest gripe really is that the Cosmic Era had a lot of wasted potential.  The best way to explain this would be to watch the SEED Stargazer movie.  It has a much grittier tone than either SEED or Destiny, as you get to see the destruction the caused by these wars from the ground level (a lot like 8th MS).  To me, this movie really showed what could have been if the Cosmic era had gone in a different direction.  As for model kits, Destiny is the sequel to SEED and as a result has the final evolution of many mobile suits (Freedom to SF, Justice to IJ ect.).  Therefore, I would guess that people just enjoy building the more complex and evolved versions of the mechs, like how you see a lot more Deathscythe Hell and fully armed Exia than the base models. Destiny also has a hell of a lot more mobile suit designs that SEED did, so that may be a contributing factor as well.    I could rant all day about little details I dislike about the Cosmic Era, but it has given me many hours of entertainment, so for that I am thankful."
Gundam,39p8rj,Hellbender79,5,Sat Jun 13 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"SEED is without question, Far Superior to SEED Destiny. But even with that said, SEED still isn't great.  SEED is just ""Meh"", while SEED Destiny, as you said above, is Terribad. That's a good way to describe both of them in terms of quality. But even despite their quality, both series still have plenty to get out of them by watching them.  But the reason why people build SEED kits all the time is pretty simple. The Cosmic Era has a very large variety of Mobile Suits to pick from, and 90% of them are actually REALLY GOOD. That was one of the Cosmic Era's Strong Points. The Mobile Suit Designs. SEED & Destiny only fucked up on I think, like....A Dozen Mobile Suits out of Hundreds. That's not that many failures compares to how many successful Mobile Suit Designs they have in their universe.  I hope this helps you understand things a bit better. I can elaborate on anything I said above however you wish. ;-)"

SEED Destiny was a giant pile of diseased Triceratops shit covered in pictures of old people porn.  Apparently a lot of this was due to behind-the-scenes stuff, but that doesn't really change the final result.  What neither show really fucked up on, though, was Mobile Suit design.  Not going to claim that it was amazing or anything, 'cuz that would be a lie, but it was pretty decent overall.

That said, if you don't like Kira in Destiny, you won't like it. I happened to like the original characters, so it really worked for me, but I heard horror stories about behind-the-scenes production. Not sure how they screw all that up with a Gundam franchise, but w/e.  Also, Destiny has some kickass mech designs. Again, I'm partial to the good guy designs. S.

War in the Pocket refers to it being a small, contained conflict which few are privy to the details of.  I think the Flash (閃光) in Space, to the End of a Flash and Hathaway's Flash refers to each story's conflict in the sense that it's ""over in an instant"" like a flash of lightning. In other words it's calling it something hidden that few know about like War in the Pocket. But that's just my theory.   EDIT: BTW, please tell me if I missed a Gundam work.   There are a lot of unlisted stories (Advance of Zeta, Gundam Legacy, CDA, Lost War Chronicles, Evolve, a fuckton of Wing manga, The Plot to Assassinate Gihren etc etc etc), but I mean, trying to list every series is a fool's errand and the titles only get more nonsensical as they get increasingly obscure."

In the former, the shi is long and the do short, and in the latter it's opposite, so I don't even know if they'd sound like the same word to a Japanese ear. But shidou means starting up, or activating. So the title might sound like, ""Mobile Suit Gundam, Activate!""  Maybe /u/DenkouNova or someone could let me know if I'm onto something."
Gundam,39ofct,Terminimal,2,Sun Jun 14 00:26:33 2015 UTC,"You remembered me! <3 (and I remember you, of course)  Puns in Japanese obey much stricter rules than most would think. There are very few possible syllables in Japanese (a bit over 100) and very strict pronunciation, such that there are a lot of homophones. In that ocean of words that sound like one another, puns really need to step their game up to be funny.  In normal speech the difference between short and long vowels is very important (more so than ""mitt"" and ""meet"" for example), so you can't really use that for puns.  shidou could be a pun with shido or shibou but not shiido. Although still, you need some setup for it to work. Like you can parody a quote or a famous saying or something, you need to make sure people really expect shidou before doing a pun, which isn't really the case here with Gundam shidou."

Gundam,39mu0j,PachoWumbo,5,Fri Jun 12 23:34:37 2015 UTC,How on earth is it a bad idea? It was my first Gundam series and I'm glad it introduced me to everything else.
Gundam,39mu0j,WackyModder84,-3,Sat Jun 13 05:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a lot of people's first Gundam Series in the past. But speaking as someone who's watched Gundam Wing over 30 times now (I'm not exaggerating), even despite that being the case, that still doesn't mean Wing is a good place to start with Gundam.  Back then, Wing was the first thing out on the Western Market. We didn't have anything else to watch until 0079 came around, and started the U.C. Timeline over here.  But the reason why Gundam Wing is a Bad Place to start with Gundam, is because it paints a False Picture in your head about what Gundam is really all about.  With Gundam Wing, it paints a picture in your mind that basically tells that Gundam is all about Pretty Boys in Mobile Suits blowing shit up, when literally any Gundam Fan out there can tell you that Gundam is DEFINITELY NOT about that. Gundam is a War Story / War Drama. And yes, Wing is still one. But compared to many other Gundam Animes out there who do it so much better and in a less Excessive, Fan-Servicey, Yaoi-Baiting, Self-Contradicting, and in some cases Badly Written way, Wing is definitely not something to start off with if you wanna get a proper view of what Gundam is really all about.  As a kid who also started with 0079 and Wing side by side in the past when I was 10, 0079 felt way less fabricated and more natural than Wing did. And even despite 0079's dated animation, it was still far less Eye Straining than Gundam Wing's was. The battles in 0079 feel like they're actually choreographed and planned out. Wing's battles feel like watching a game of Dynasty Warriors Gundam; seeing the Same Exact Enemies getting destroyed in the Same Exact Animations over and over again. The Recycled Animation makes it Very Difficult to get enjoyment of of a good handful of battles in Wing. And of course, one of the biggest complaints I have with Gundam Wing: THAT. GOD. DAMN. NARRORATOR. Even despite the fact that he had such a Soothing and Charismatic Voice in the same way as say, Morgan Freeman, that doesn't change the fact that Gundam Wing LOVES to randomly decide to dump exposition on your lap whenever the fuck it finds it convenient. If exposition is to be done, it must be woven into the narrative, and not dumped on your lap and expecting you to shut up and believe all of it. Hence why 0079's storytelling feels completely natural. The characters do the work here with practically no exposition dumping whatsoever.  Now, don't gemme wrong. Even despite all that, Gundam Wing as a whole is still a Pretty Decent Gundam Anime. It's not that bad at all compared to many others out there. But as a place to start off with Gundam in this day and age, it is DEFINITELY NOT a good place to get into the franchise with and get a proper view of what Gundam is all about.  The Worst Gundam Animes to start off with as your first are as follows:   ZZ Gundam Char's Counterattack Unicorn F91 Victory G-Reco Turn A G X Wing SEED 00 AGE Build Fighters & Try   Now, I know people are gonna yell at me for throwing 00 in there, but hear me out on one thing:  00 is probably The Best Choice for being YOUR 1ST ALTERNATE UNIVERSE of Gundam to watch after you've immersed yourself in the franchise via the U.C. timeline. Aside from the movie sequel, 00 is fantastic. But again, not really as a good Starting Place."
Gundam,39mu0j,PachoWumbo,3,Sat Jun 13 06:26:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm, fair explanation. As someone who reads almost no gundam forums and such, I never even thought of the Wing pilots as ""pretty-boys"" in any yaoi manner. Nonetheless, I don't disagree with some points, particularly the massive exposition by the narrator."

Gundam,39mgo5,radicalblur,2,Sat Jun 13 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"Relevant portion of the article:   As the debut of his newest series, Gundam Reconguista in G, draws near, Tomino seems to be staying the acerbic course, with a wide-ranging complaint about the current state of anime voice acting, plus some regrets about his prior collaboration with famed sci-fi designer Sid Mead.  Tomino’s remarks appear in the September issue of Bandai Visual’s Beat Magazine. In speaking to the publication’s reporters, the anime legend looked back on the last Gundam series he personally directed, 1999’s Turn A Gundam.  “I’ve come to realize that asking Sid Mead [to do mechanical designs for the series] was a mistake,” Tomino admits. “I was already a fan of his preexisting works, so I gave him free rein to do as he wanted. Actually, somewhere along the line I felt like there was something a little off with the designs he’d submitted, but by that time things were too far along to change their trajectory.”  As a result, Tomino says that he’s being more outspoken with his opinions on the mecha designs being proposed by Ippei Gyobu for Gundam Reconguista in G (also known as G-Reco)."

As a result, Sayla lives a relatively normal life while Char is climbing the ranks in a long-term plot to destroy the Zabis.    She's happy with her life and doesn't understand why Char is going to such great lengths to do what he does.     While a bit different, there's a great moment in the novel version of 0079 where Sayla asks Amuro to kill her brother because he's no longer the young Casval she knew.    In ZZ, Sayla talks to Bright about how she wishes her brother were dead. That she's lost her brother to the ideals of Zeon.    As a result, she's just sick and tired of her brother and just ignores him. To her, Casval has been dead for long. Char is just a puppet."

She returned to being a civilian, which makes sense because she never desired to be a soldier to begin with (and originally trained in medicine). She wasn't really important in CCA because CCA was about Amuro and Char's relationship and Char's relationship to his father's legacy; Sayla would've been superfluous. Her plot with Char was resolved in the first series."
Gundam,39mbuh,gyagoda,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Whilst I agree with you I do think there's some wasted potential between her and Char. If there were some scenes with these two characters between the moment Char disappears in Zeta and CCA you would have more of a feel for where Char and his motivations for the events in CCA lie.   Don't get me wrong I like CCA but I can't help but feel it would have been better to know the motivation behind Char's plan a bit more explicitly and I feel some interaction with Sayla could have accomplished this.
Gundam,39mbuh,Hrythar,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think Sayla is necessary for that. He could easily talk to, say, Nanai about his motivations and it'd make more sense than talking to Sayla. His motivations aren't particularly mysterious either -- he wants to force humanity to become newtypes because he's lost faith in the ability for people to do it themselves. I agree, however, that how he came to this motivation needs a lot of explanation that doesn't exist in the movie itself. In the ""stage"" scene towards the end of Zeta, he even explicitly says he wants to wait for humanity to become newtypes and doesn't want to force it; how he gets to the complete opposite position between Zeta and CCA is only vaguely hinted at in the movie.   Sayla wouldn't really help explaining that aspect. If anything it wouldn't make any sense at all, because Sayla herself had said in ZZ she had no idea what her brother was doing -- and hence she'd also be totally clueless as to how he came around to what he did in CCA."

Somewhat related, but a rumor I heard was that at one point Tomino suggested that Sayla would be the leader of Neo-Zeon for Zeta and ZZ.

Gundam,39k5z7,Cheng12321,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:27:00 2015 UTC,Compared to Zeta which is one of the best artwork and Char Counter Attack is a huge difference if anything Char Counter Attack is better than Zeta and they managed to make CGI that blends with the 2D animation.
Gundam,39k5z7,Vatepgo1,2,Fri Jun 12 14:17:56 2015 UTC,The only CGI in Char's Counterattack is the 5-6 second shot of Sweetwater spinning. Everything else is 100% traditional animation.
Gundam,39k5z7,Runsamok,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if its because they were movies, or because of Tomino, or both but CCA and F91 had some of the best action sequences I've ever seen."
Gundam,39k5z7,KaziArmada,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:05:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, if only in length and budget.   If you tell someone ""A movie!"" they assume two hours or so. On the other hand if you say ""An OVA!"" they'll assume a mini-series.   OVA's also rarely, if ever, get theater releases."
Gundam,39k5z7,BoyGodz,3,Sat Jun 13 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"If CCA and F91 proves anything, it's that the normal runtime for a movie is too way short for any original gundam story. Even for CCA which already has a good portion of backgrounds and characters development  laid out prior the movie, still lacks of screen time for new characters to share beside Amuro and Char, and the plot is no more developed further than ""Char is is dropping Axis"".   Honestly, I don't think movie is a good medium for Gundams. Most gundam series excels at world building, and movies just doesn't provide enough time for much world building. Perhaps there is one or two very condensed side story or epilogue episode like Awakening of trailblazer that can be successful in movie format, but for a full stretched out series, we are better off with the OVA format."
Gundam,39k5z7,OZKai,2,Fri Jun 12 10:49:27 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue with original movies (as discovered with F91) is that the stories within are almost written with intent on being some kind of series, meaning cramming roughly 25-40 episodes worth of content into 90-120 minutes, which can get messy."
Gundam,39k5z7,OmegaSeven,3,Fri Jun 12 10:29:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like CCA is paced pretty well.  I mean yeah, an OVA that included the mid season replacement suits and a little more room to space out the events might have been nice but I don't feel cheated in any way."
Gundam,39k5z7,Meatpurse,2,Fri Jun 12 12:43:55 2015 UTC,"This is really more of a Tomino issue as the man is not just not that good at pacing.  If you give him 50 episodes he can do wonders, any less and not so much."

People talk about how you can't fit a good Gundam story into a movie runtime, but lets not forget that War in the Pocket is just six half-hour episodes, putting its total runtime at that of a longer movie, and it is one of the very best Gundam stories.  Smaller scale conflicts like that can absolutely work in the movie format, and would be very welcome."

Gundam,39j76u,llirving,2,Fri Jun 12 02:29:44 2015 UTC,"Personal copypasta inbound;  Okay, let's start here. This is one of my favorite visual representations of timelines. http://i.imgur.com/XufpJl9.jpg Don't worry so much about how they coalesce into the C.C. But it should serve as a nice guide, it's all listed chronologically rather than production order. You can see that the Universal Century definitely has the most entries and is essentially the ""core"" of Gundam, it is where Gundam began, and remains the most developed. (Not to discredit the other series, they're equally fantastic.) There is also this guide which lists the series in production order, giving you pros/cons of each. http://i.imgur.com/m1mrtjX.jpg  So, let me break that down and simplify. Gundam is a franchise and the franchise is expansive. Gundam is split up into timelines, which can be completely separate settings to themselves, every series is related in at least one aspect and that is the use of the ubiquitous word, 'Gundam'. (Even what the word Gundam means can differ between timelines.) Aside from that, show to show can be entirely unrelated to another. You may get re-occurrence of themes, but that is about it.  Luckily, Gundam has something for everyone and covers a wide array of styles. I don't like to throw out blanket statements of what each series is about, and what I recommend people start with varies person to person, so to start, what aspect of Gundam appeals to you the most? (I assume there is something, otherwise you wouldn't be here asking how to get into it.)"
Gundam,39j76u,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:05:27 2015 UTC,"Basically the giant robot thing is what appeals to me. I also enjoy the space theme and whatnot. I watched Valvrave: The Liberator and really liked it, so I went looking for some more. I have a hard time getting into the older series, but I'll give it a shot anyway"
Gundam,39j76u,ConchobarMacNess,2,Fri Jun 12 12:01:49 2015 UTC,"Hrm, okay. I haven't seen Valvrave so I'm not sure if it's more Super Robot or more Real Robot. So, if the older series are a bit jarring for you here is what I recommend.   G Gundam: If you want a Super Robot Gundam series to start off, Mobile Fighter G Gundam is your best bet. This one is very cheesy, but sort of tongue-in-cheek about it. The plot gets progressively better as it goes on. It stands on it's own being an AU series, and honestly if I were to describe it in one sentence; It is Gundam, meets Dragon Ball Z, meets bad kung fu movie. It's a personal favorite, but is not quite indicative of what core Gundam is all about. (It's still a good time regardless.)  00 Gundam: A lot of people's first introduction to Gundam, it's also an AU. It's got 2 seasons and a movie. (A total of 50 episodes and a Movie.) the general consensus is the first season kind of rocks. After that, it differs person to person. I'm going to focus on the first season to pitch this one, the first half of S1 spends a heck a lot of time on Earth. After that, lots of space battles. It sits in the Real Robot category, and breaks a few tropes that Mecha series use as staples. (For example, The MC isn't just a kid who happens to wander into the cockpit of a killing machine.) The series is quite a good watch, and will introduce you to a lot of the themes that Gundam is known for. Highly recommend this one as it came out in 07.   Universal Century: Alright, so let me breakdown UC for you simply. UC has a lot of continuity and could keep you entertained for a potentially long time. It's also where all the older stuff is, around Zeta it becomes less noticeable however. A rough description of UC is this, it's a war drama. (While not completely fixated on the two, in large part the entire thing revolves around Char and Amuro. So there is a sense of legacy between series that these two start.)  Recurring themes throughout the UC:    War is hell, people die.  What exactly is a newtype?  Gundam pilot is usually a kid with the burden thrust upon him by chance, and then watching him evolve into a soldier. Spacenoids vs the Earthnoids Each faction is capable of committing atrocities.   If all that seems interesting to you, I'll recommend what I always recommend to acclimate people to the UC. If you like both or either of these, then you will enjoy all that the UC has to offer.  0080: War In The Pocket: A Side-story set at the end of the original 0079 Mobile Suit Gundam. It is light-hearted at times, gritty at others, and explores the affect of this massive war on the average spacenoid citizens that didn't ask for a war. Further, instead of demonizing either side it contrasts the two and show that even the basic grunt is still just human. This is my personal favorite entry in the UC, it's also only 6 episodes so it's short enough to finish off in a weekend afternoon. (In my mind, this is what the UC is all about.)  08th MS Team: This follows a small Mobile Suit team on Earth during the One Year War. It has the most realistic depiction of Mobile Suits than any other series, ova, or movie. For many it's the king of the UC. It features lots of gritty action, and also reveals some of the minutia of piloting a mobile suit. (Such as having to conduct emergency field repairs because sand from the desert they patrol clogs up the joints.) This is definitely the definitive real robot entry in the UC. It's also only 12 episodes long, so that makes it easy to get through. Oh- and it has a pretty decent Romance sub-plot as well."

So it definitely has a lot of a nostalgia factor to it. I'm just not convinced it's one of the better series out there. Gundam 00 is newer and essentially a remake of Wing, so I opted to recommend that one. Although- if you want to check out Wing, go right on ahead. It' been a decade since I've seen the thing though, so I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other."

So, after a while the original seems ""boring"" or bland because you've seen the same thing done a million times. The Beatles' music is also a bit of this, they changed the musical landscape but now their stuff seems too pop or generic or plain.  If you don't enjoy it, that's fine. Just appreciate its impact and legacy and try to find other stuff that you may like.  For me, the original series is ok, but what really hooks me is the lore of the series. The Universal Century has so much lore and stories that (for me and many others) make it the best timeline.  May I suggest Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory?

Gundam,39jhvp,HumanMilkshake,4,Fri Jun 12 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"I'm watching the series right now for the first time, and I have to say, I really only like him because he's a fully fleshed out character. Like, most of the time when you see what the antagonists are up to, it's usually doing something comically evil, like eating puppies.   I hate the way Char is characterized, I imagine if I ever met him I would never want to talk to him. But, he's an actual character. He has his own goals and personality. That's really why I like him, not his goals or personality, but that he actually has one."
Gundam,39jhvp,Gfaqshoohaman,0,Fri Jun 12 04:38:48 2015 UTC,"i see what you mean and i do respect that about Char, i guess the biggest problem is that his 'identity' as sort claimed within gundam from series and the fan base has made him out to be a bigger deal than he comes off as in the actual series where he's more just a smart and so far pretty darn vengeful guy"
Gundam,39jhvp,TheQuestionaut,3,Fri Jun 12 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"and the fan base has made him out to be a bigger deal than he comes off as in the actual series where he's more just a smart and so far pretty darn vengeful guy   This isn't something you can say from having been turned off by 0079. Char is the most fleshed out character in all of the Gundam franchises weighed against each other. I understand if you're not enjoying what you've seen so far, but you've barely touched the surface of what he has done as a character in his fictional life."
Gundam,39jhvp,ghostFOUR7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:47:55 2015 UTC,"that's true, i do admit that so far i haven't given the original series that much of a chance but i will say that from what i had watched char is the most interesting character"
Gundam,39jhvp,CitrusChrome,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"honestly, that's the biggest part that made me question myself  Char is such a huge iconic character in Gundam and i really enjoy the many 'Char clones' in various gundam series but as i said in my original post i don't know what i expected of Char but his character to me at least in the first movie wasn't as interesting as some of his character type clones (this includes full-frontal who if i remember correctly is basically literally a clone)"
Gundam,39jhvp,Char_X_3,2,Fri Jun 12 05:20:09 2015 UTC,Char also has the advantage of being prominent in several series so he does got a lot of time to develop as a character.
Gundam,39jhvp,cjf_colluns,2,Fri Jun 12 06:17:33 2015 UTC,Char gets more development in zeta and Char's Counterattack. Don't Give up on him just yet.
Gundam,39jhvp,sylpher250,2,Fri Jun 12 07:59:58 2015 UTC,"I was mostly joking, everyone gets an opinion. The thing is 0079 is very old and people forget that sometimes."
Gundam,39jhvp,cjf_colluns,3,Fri Jun 12 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"Taste is a matter of preference. You don't like it, you don't have to. If you really want to try and tough it out, the TV series might make the characters more bearable since it focuses more on their growth. The dub is pretty damn good too and my personal preference. If you just want to get it over, than continue with the movies.  And if worse comes to worst, try reading The Origin. But again, this is only if you want to."
Gundam,39jhvp,Palikun,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"thanks for the advice, i don't know i might try switching over to the tv series instead or trying the dub (i watched the first movie subbed)"
Gundam,39jhvp,Palikun,2,Fri Jun 12 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"Don't watch the movies dubbed. They don't even pronounce ""gundam"" right, and they changed a lot of iconic lines.   The series dub is great though."

Gundam,39jhvp,ConchobarMacNess,3,Sun Jun 14 01:06:22 2015 UTC,"Just wait for the ""Origin"" anime to come out or read the manga.   I binged on the manga and the story is much tighter and gives you a better Char's perspective."
Gundam,39jhvp,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:05:59 2015 UTC,But isn't the origin anime just two movies about young Char and Sayla? They're only adapting like two chapters from volume 5 of the manga that added a bunch of backstory. I don't think they're retelling anything that happened in the original series.

Gundam,39jhvp,Palikun,2,Fri Jun 12 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"My biggest criticism of the films is they don't really do any of the characters any service. They kind of rush along the plot, fixing it at some points but you lose out a lot of what makes these characters interesting.   Amuro comes off as a total bitch in the movies and except for an infamous slap and 1 incident he never gets reprimanded. Sayla comes off as almost a damsel, Hayato and Ryu are just two random guys and Bright's a Dick. Char gets a good amount of screen time but his motives aren't really alluded to until he kills Garma during the Climax, then the films goes on for a few more episodes of content so we can get the Sieg Zeon speech.  Recently showed the films to my friends and it pretty much became a game of how long until this guy dies. Kai has so far been the longest survivor.  I advise the series over the Movies, but if you don't like it don't force yourself to watch it. Also no one likes the Guntank or Guncannon. Unless your my friend Jon."
Gundam,39jhvp,chrysamere,2,Fri Jun 12 11:24:02 2015 UTC,"wow everything you said here are basically the criticisms i had with the movie, i think after following other suggestions in this topic like watching war in the pocket or 08th MS team that i'll go back and try watching the actual series instead of the movies"
Gundam,39jhvp,sdwoodchuck,2,Fri Jun 12 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"War in the Pocket and 8th MS Team are seriously the best Gundam series, if you want to get into Gundam 8th MS Team is the way to go. War in the Pocket is much more a classic War Drama, much more about the life of a Soldier and the things he has to do for his country.  You should definitely try the series, I'll admit I wanted to slap Amuro still but I feel his viewpoint of basically being drafted is much better represented. Ryu actually gets some screen time, Sayla is more proactive and Bright actually second guesses himself. Hayato really doesn't get much development until Zeta, and Kai is still a self-centered coward."
Gundam,39jhvp,-ProFound-,3,Fri Jun 12 13:48:52 2015 UTC,i just finished watching War in the Pocket and while it was really good that ending was just crazy sad ;.;  i do think when i give 0079 another shot it will be the TV series and not the movies
Gundam,39jhvp,-ProFound-,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"I will be honest, I didn't like anything in the UC timeline for the longest time. I cut my teeth on Gundam Wing and Endless Waltz. Watched Seed and thought it was pretty solid, loved G Gundam etc. but I just couldn't get into the UC stuff. The designs looked boring and dumb and just bleh.  Then something happened. I fell out of Gundam a little bit. No new shows came on, and good luck finding one of the movies. Then, during a particularly shitty day, I bought the MG Unicorn gunpla kit. I loved the look of it, sleek and angular with glowing psychoframe. I had to see what it was like in action, so I watched the first episode of Gundam UC. Then the second, third, and just as I was up to date, episode 4 released. I was hooked, I knew some of the basics (Char, Amuro, OYW, etc) but not much. Ended up devouring 0079, 08th MS Team, War in the Pocket, Stardust Memory, Zeta, ZZ, and finally Chars Counterattack.  I now appreciate the iconic designs of 0079 much more. They can be plain, silly, and dated. But look at when it was released. Now Universal Century is my jam, and I can't get into the alternate universe stuff. I've tried watching 00 at least 4 times and just can't do it. Ultimately it's just personal preference, sometimes it's just the tastes you have at the time. But at the end of the day, we all love Gundam in one form or another."
Gundam,39jaaa,saekheart,4,Fri Jun 12 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"His most notable ability is his Newtype powers, which may be the strongest in the series, or at least rivaling Char Aznable according to Haman.   The way I read it was this; At best he's a Newtype god, at worst he's on the same level as Char.   So, it's stating, at the very least he is on Char's level. But it is quite clear that he is more than that.  Does that make sense?"
Gundam,39jaaa,ConchobarMacNess,2,Fri Jun 12 05:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense, but saying he's on Char's level isn't really a compliment when it comes to pure newtype abilities lol."
Gundam,39jaaa,ConchobarMacNess,2,Fri Jun 12 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"True. I think it's listed there because that was the only time any dialogue was actually voiced about his Newtype potential. It's a case of stating versus inferring. It's inferred the he is a newtype god, but it's never out right stated. The opposite is true for Haman's comment.  Also, Char is still a badass newtype. He just sorta'....pales in comparison to Kamille and Amuro....and Lalah...and....Well, he's still a evolved Newtype that along with Amuro created the Axis Shock. He's no Katz punk."
Gundam,39jaaa,DefrostedTuna,3,Fri Jun 12 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"They may mean he's up to par with Char in terms of overall skill, everything included? The way I see it is Wikis are always subject to some form of error. It's pretty apparent just from watching that Char isn't the strongest Newtype around so it's probably just a mistake."
Gundam,39jaaa,TheQuestionaut,2,Fri Jun 12 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I'll go with an error with the wiki cuz I find it hard to believe an untrained Judau can match Char's veteran piloting skills."

Gundam,39f9zo,Ahnura,2,Tue Jun 23 05:09:26 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% on this but I'd guess that after the First Neo Zeon war when the AEUG rejoined the Earth Federation and Londo Bell was formed they just reassigned a bunch of personnel and resources to different places. It also doesn't seem entirely out of the ordinary to me that Beecha just maybe up and quit since he was shown to not like the military life earlier in the series. Maybe they just needed to find someone new.  Specifically on Judau though all I remember is that he comes back as Grey Stoke in Crossbone Gundam: Skull Heart with the Gump which is the ZZ in disrepair.
Gundam,39f9zo,Gundam336,2,Thu Jun 11 11:24:29 2015 UTC,He went and joined the joined the Jupiter fleet with roux. The other characters.........yea ain't much is said about them. But Judau did come back in either  crossbone or crossbon skullheart which was pretty cool.

When I do think I know, I notice some minor detail that makes me question it.HOWEVER the story still makes sense outside of the very strange ending. The last twenty minutes or so just leave your mind in a destroyed mess, it's honestly one of the best endings in any form of media ever.  Then, in G Reco, which is apparently trying to be intentionally misleading and ""real"" like MGS2 was, nothing makes any sense. Characters say things that make no sense (""THE WORLD IS NOT SQUARE!"") and plot elements, such as the solar batteries or whatever, are just thrown away in monologues. One moment, characters are on one side and the next scene they aren't. People who were trying to kill each other moments earlier are hanging out and watching mobile suits be loaded into hangars on ships together.  I really, really wanted to like G Reco. It's Tomino, has a great soundtrack, set in UC (technically), and the designs are awesome. But it's complete nonsense.  And I bet that in like ten years all the kids will think it's the best Gundam series."

It's amazing how many people still don't realize what that means when it's clearly fucking obvious in the case of that one phrase.  The World Is Not Square is just a shorter way of saying ""The World is not Black & White"". Basically meaning that Good VS. Evil doesn't exist in the real world. There is no such thing as ""Good Guys"" and ""Bad Guys"".  I figured people would pick up on that a lot quicker, but apparently not. O_o"
Gundam,39alrt,WackyModder84,2,Wed Jun 10 23:38:18 2015 UTC,When that phrase was said in the show I took it to be an insult pointing out that someone couldn't understand combat in three dimensions which is typical in Gundam space combat.

Gundam,39alrt,Finishingtothesky,2,Thu Jun 11 07:15:30 2015 UTC,"I am SO glad to see there are others who appreciated MGS2, which is by far my favorite in the series. MGS2 properly conveyed the transition into a digital age, where information is easily manipulated and where people often only grasp a fraction of the puzzle. A character can tell you all he knows in MGS2, but that doesn't mean at all that it's the truth or that it isn't skewed. To be completely honest, I wish the followups kept this going, but instead chose to dumb it down.  Now, when I look at G-Reco, same as you I wanted to like it. Few episodes in, I'm sure a lot of viewers were going ""Okay, nothing makes sense now, but I'm sure it's gonna open up in the next few..."". Problem being that never went away. Then the characters start getting more and more disconnected, feeling almost alien in many ways. Some people often defend the characters by saying ""The culture 1 billion (or whatever amount) of years later is different! They treat their military as a college football team!"" And really, I dig that, I wanted to anyway. The way the characters acted didn't seem human largely due to a lack of weight and consequences in their actions and words. They swap sides at a moments notice and don't seem to take anything as threatening until the plot calls for ""humanization"".   I really did love the designs. The world was offbeat enough to not seem like anything we've seen before. But the plot and characters just kill it. The article talks about it not being an easy story to comprehend, that the backstory is a lot larger. But honestly, why would I really care about the backstory when it seems the main story had a nonsensical plot, and the ending made the entire story feel irrelevant? The ending was basically Bellri going ""Alright, we've fought, so I'm clocking out! Time to see the world!"""

The series was an incoherent mess that suffered from serious pacing issues. I understand Tomino didn't want to spoonfeed us with explanation but the series was too abstract for the viewers to remain engaged.  I think G Reco would've been better told as an OVA (maybe 2 or 3 feature length movie?) instead of a episodic series."

There are other examples of where stories are omitting detailed narratives, but the world is still intriguing because characters in it make decisions that are believable even in the context of a hyper futuristic reality. After watching a few episodes of G, it just feels like a dream, when you try to rationalize what happened the next day, it really just doesn't make any sense."
Gundam,39alrt,gaming99,-7,Wed Jun 10 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"I offer an appypolly loggy, my good droog, but I respectfully disagree. The show is not so much chepooka, as it requires looking at it through the eyes of it's characters. They have been brought up in cultures far removed from our own, including one where they view a space elevator as bog almighty. I don't believe such an approach is gloopy, as it helps make the world more concrete. I think it's oomny even. It's easy pony a world that resembles our own, but considering how cultures change over time the future may not be as recognizable as we now think.  ...It's nadsat, from A Clockwork Orange.

Gundam,39alrt,CaptainAmeijin,-1,Wed Jun 10 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"Are we still trying to justify why the show was executed the way it was?  I thought it was officially said from the man himself that had they had the resources to make it a 50 ep series, that would have done wonders for the exposition. G-reco wasn't my cup of tea, but after reading this information I wholeheartedly sympathized with Tomino."
Gundam,39alrt,WisteriaHysteria,4,Thu Jun 11 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like the two are somewhat separate issues; yes, there were pacing issues involved in shortening a 50-episode plot into a 24-episode series, but the way it was told is another matter entirely. Compare a show like Tokyo Ghoul, which crammed something like 60 chapters of manga into a 12-episode season; everything made sense, it just felt really off.  Reconguista in G's pacing was a problem, but the narrative storytelling is something else entirely. How details are explained, how characters are presented, how ideas are fleshed out, etc., are all part of the narrative, which is (somewhat) independent of the story's pacing.  I feel like Reconguista in G suffered from many problems for Western audiences; faulty or overly-literal translations, rushed pacing, and a purposefully-disjointed narrative style that all combined into something that can be messy and unattractive to some.  I love Reconguista (though I'm still not finished with it), but I can understand why it may not be someone's cup of tea."
Gundam,39alrt,NeonLightIllusion,4,Thu Jun 11 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"Reconguista in G's pacing was a problem, but the narrative storytelling is something else entirely.   This.  I readily admit the pacing was a problem because there were a number of scenes and times when something dramatic or important was happening, and a little extra time lingering on that specific scene would have greatly increased the impact of those scenes, instead of rushing along.  The show very seldom spends more than a few seconds establishing location, or letting something important sink in before we're already at the next plot point.  However, the narrative storytelling is, IMO, superb.  As a person who studies history extensively, G-Reco's style of presenting character perspectives free of unnecessary exposition and narration is not just more engaging and intellectually stimulating, but much more true to life.  The whole point of Gundam originally was to try and make a robot series as realistic as possible.  G-Reco takes that realism that was applied to the sci-fi world, and extends it into the form of the show itself, giving us a realistic perspective into a very realistic world.  IRL, you don't have info dumps, or get to hear people's inner thoughts, or have timely flashbacks if you've forgotten something.  You just have to observe all available information and figure shit out yourselves.  I don't want to be insulting to people, but if you couldn't figure out what was going on in G-Reco, then you either weren't paying attention well enough, or your brain isn't used to having to do the kind of critical analysis of primary sources that G-Reco insists the viewer partake in.  And the brilliant thing about the form of the show that requires theme of critical analysis, and piecing info together yourself, and learning to empathize with others to understand it, is that the characters themselves are going through the same thing.  The form of the show reinforces the shows themes themselves, and that's always a neat thing.  Bellri and the crew of the Megafauna are stuck between a bunch of competing powers and perspectives and have to attempt to piece together what everyone wants and where they're coming from, because those people themselves are failing to do that and engage in rational discussion.  And that's what ultimately sets the good guys apart from the antagonists in this show."

The shop is there if you don't want to farm, they basically unlock MS that you fight against (not all of them tho).  2) The development path is not random at all e.g Exia->00->Quanta. There is a excel spread sheet that list all the upgrade paths on gamefaqs but I can't link to it now."
Gundam,39c0vd,Mayomori,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:32:17 2015 UTC,"Drop rates can be adjusted by ""Luck"" DLC which can be purchased on the Japanese PSN. Otherwise they're static and you have a higher chance of a part dropping if the enemy is broken into more parts. Destroying ""Boss"" Exia Gundams will drop Exia parts, else the mission which Exia is associated (each mission is associated with 2 units) is the stage which you want to grind to get all of it's parts. Else you can pay a small amount of credits to get the unit from the store after defeating it's ""boss"" version. It will give you all the parts for it minus it's weapons. You get a part to a specific level and then you can upgrade it to another part. Which level it needs to be depends on the part you're upgrading it to. Could be 2, could be 5. Once upgraded the new part starts off at level 1."

Also, a denim jacket can accompany the jeans. It's a lot easier if you already have a Heero-like personality. If you can get the hair good, you're lucky. Don't forget the roses. Swap out devil wings with angel wings. Parkour can be a very fulfilling, useful activity. It is necessary for the ""practically invincible"" step.  Warnings Don't accidentally kill someone while knocking them out. Don't say ""I'll kill you"" to random people. Further, let your friends know that you mean ""I feel close to you;"" they'll  slap/punch you and report you to someone otherwise. Don't actually dive off a building or a cliff. Don't actually commit suicide. Don't wear a tank top to school... As was noted, don't be a player. Don't forget the roses.   What the fuck.........."

I can see this is made brilliantly and you put a lot of work into this, and if it makes someone like me know what to do, you've done your job very well :D. Now some loose ends:  Crossbone Gundam - How long roughly will it take for the average reader to go through this? I want the information from the gap but I'm not really a manga savvy person.  Gundam G-Reco - Are the events of the skip from victory to it explained during the series?  Gundam Wing - "".....interesting fanbase"" what do you mean by this? :D (Is it because of the Over hype thing or something else I should be aware of)  Gundam Wing: Frozen Teardrop - Will it harm my knowledge of the story not reading this? You sound like I should keep away from it  Gundam SEED Destiny - I guess I should keep away from this too, but once again, will it hurt my knowledge of the story (In a way that I miss out important bits)?  Besides this, I know what I gotta do, thank you so much for the information!"
Gundam,39cidn,WackyModder84,3,Wed Jun 10 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"1.) Not too long at all, actually. Crossbone Gundam's Main Story consists of 3 Mangas:   Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam (5 Volumes) Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: Skull Heart (1 Volume) Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: Steel 7 (3 Volumes)   Even for Non Manga Savvy Readers, it's actually not that long at all compared to a lot of other mangas out there. There also exists a Side-Story of Crossbone Gundam which takes place along side Victory's Story called ""Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: Ghost"". This one is actually still on-going even today. But you can check it out whenever after you get up to and/or finish Victory to see what happens to the Crossbone Cast after Steel 7. =)  2.) Yes and No. They were touched upon in multiple places, but not quite as deeply as they could have been, admittedly. But hey, it's better than nothing, I suppose. XD  3.) Ehhhrmm.........Well, you see.....Gundam Wing's Fanbase is split into Three Parts from my experience with them:   First, you got your Typical Group of Gundam Wing fans who saw it as their first Gundam Anime in the past and loved it. But at the same time, don't overhype it and realize that it's definitely not the best Gundam Anime out there by any means. Secondly, you got what I like to call, The ""Gundam Wing Grand Old Party (G.O.P.)"". And yes, I am making fun of Republicans when I say that, because these Gundam Wing fans have a lot in common with Heavy Right-Wing Republicans in terms of how they both behave. The Gundam Wing G.O.P. has a very bad habit of FANBOYING THE HELL out of Gundam Wing to the point where it's almost comical to watch. They cling so heavily to Old and Outdated Ideas with Gundam that Wing attempted in the past, that weren't even that great or innovative to begin with. And they refuse to acknowledge any other Gundam Anime as being Anywhere Near as good as Wing was. And anyone who disagrees with them is automatically a bottom-feeder in their eyes. So basically in a nutshell, they're your typical bunch of 90's Kids who are all Clinging to their Childhoods for Dear Life, refusing to let go; and not moving onto more updated and innovative new things in the Gundam Metaverse. XD And finally, we got the more......""Controversial"" side of the Gundam Wing Fanbase. And everyone here on /r/Gundam knows exactly what I'm talking about. The Yaoi Fanbase. OHHHHHHH, Boy! These guys, or rather, Girls, in most cases, can get very creepy with Gundam Wing's Main Characters. And honestly, the Main Characters of Wing are extremely Yaoi-Bait in their Character Designs, some may say. So it's not too surprising why this happened. But it still doesn't make it any less creepier than it is. I think you get where this is going..... lol   3.) NO IT WILL NOT. You have my word on that one. Without going into spoilers, I can safely say this. Frozen Teardrop's EXISTENCE automatically contradicts the Ending of Endless Waltz. I can't really say what I mean by this until you get up to Endless Waltz yourself and see what I'm talking about. But just know that skipping Frozen Teardrop is totally fine to do and it will not harm anything with your knowledge of the story. You have my solemn vow as a Gundam Fan with that one. ;-)  4.) Well here's the deal with that one. SEED Destiny's situation is a lot more complicated than Frozen Teardrop's. Because SEED Destiny's existence doesn't contradict anything. It's just a simple Direct Sequel to SEED. But even despite anything I said before, I standby my message of saying that Every Single Gundam Fan Out There should definitely watch SEED & Destiny AT LEAST ONCE in their Fandom of the franchise. Quality Wise, yes. SEED is Mediocre and Destiny is God-Awful. But that shouldn't stop you from at least seeing it with your own eyes and develop your own thoughts and opinions on it. Because there are still some redeeming qualities with both SEED & Destiny, despite their overall quality.  If you have anymore questions, I'm still all ears, dude. =)"

I love the Seed MS designs, and Freedom is my favorite gundam design, Strike Freedom...well besides a cool name it was a massive disappointment that it's just a re imaged Freedom, as with Infinite Justice.

Gundam,39cidn,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:08:28 2015 UTC,i admit i only ever watched half of destiny (that's all my friend had when i originally watched it) so i never got to see the finish of shinn's character arc but he was just really irritating and dumb to me but despite that i really liked and enjoyed all of SEED and destiny was an okay show just not as good as SEED
Gundam,399ic2,neighbz,7,Wed Jun 10 05:48:29 2015 UTC,Let me know how you felt about the ending?   A 49 episode show compacted into 25. Simple as that.  Sometimes I wonder how many classical animes from the 80s and 90s would have been chopped off at the knees too if they were released in the current market.
Gundam,399ic2,Gfaqshoohaman,2,Wed Jun 10 07:34:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. At the very least, it should have been split into two seasons, a la 00."
Gundam,399ic2,HeIsAnAli,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wonder how many classical animes from the 80s and 90s would have been chopped off at the knees too if they were released in the current market.   You're forgetting the fact that lots of classical animes got this kind of treatment, or got cancelled early and had things rushed.  0079's ending notoriously got rushed because the studio cut it short.  Same happened to Gundam X, IIRC.  The results were very similar - breeze through a lot of plot points on a compressed schedule that leaves a lot of smaller details unexplored and the things we do see feels slightly disjointed."
Gundam,399ic2,WisteriaHysteria,5,Fri Jun 12 10:22:58 2015 UTC,"With Aida's group, it's supposed to represent the next generation taking charge of the future.   I honestly believe Tomino didn't want to specify what they would end up doing, as he felt it would be hypocritical of him to do so given the themes of the series. The issues the show talked about were based on issues Japan is currently facing and Tomino wanted children to start thinking about them. They are complicated issues with no real right or wrong answer. They're not going to resolve themselves with a certain character's death. It's up to the viewer to decide what's right and wrong.  My guess is that whatever the individual viewer believes Aida and Co. should be doing to make the world a better place, that's what they do. At least, that's how I read Tomino.  With Bell, it's a lot more simple. Go out, see the world and enjoy life.  At least, that's my take on this thing."
Gundam,399ic2,Char_X_3,2,Wed Jun 10 13:07:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a sucker for the animation style and mech design alone, but I like the characters and the story too even though you gotta piece it all together yourself. I found it fun to discover the world through visuals and little hints in the dialogue, but I feel like we got cheated with only 26 episodes when it would've benefited more from a 50 episode series. Even with all it's flaws, G-Reco makes my top 10."
Gundam,399ic2,Greytalon,2,Thu Jun 11 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"It's rushed, undoubtedly. We didn't really get any conclusions except ""Okay, war's over. Everyone goes home and live their lives happily ever after.""  Maybe it's Tomino's fault, maybe he should have written a shorter story instead of being stubborn to fit all of it in, but I wouldn't know."
Gundam,399ic2,thatdudewithknees,0,Fri Jun 12 12:05:59 2015 UTC,"It's not even Tominos fault this is actually the fault of the anime industry and fans, basically if your name isn't big then you won't get a 4 Cour anime or not a lot of funding. This is also the reason why Gonzo and the ex director of Madhouse also faced this problem of creating high quality anime with good story line almost gotten them into bankruptcy. But if Tomino joined Miyasaki instead maybe he wouldn't have to faced this problem."
Gundam,399ic2,Vatepgo1,2,Fri Jun 12 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"Well, shouldn't one work with what they have? Is it not the writer's fault for writing an overambitious piece that goes beyond what is available to them, though? I mean, it's not like you'll magically get more air time/budget if you rush a story."
Gundam,399ic2,thatdudewithknees,0,Fri Jun 12 15:16:35 2015 UTC,"Would you have a half bake anime instead of a full course, after all Tomino have yet to know how to write anime that's within 25 episodes. Look at F91 Tomino only have 13 episode scrip for a movie and Tomino only work with what he had and yet people complaint it's too short. And now you're acting like a spoilt brat for asking to work with what he had."

Gundam,399ic2,thatdudewithknees,0,Sun Jun 14 13:21:22 2015 UTC,"To be true he's isn't a great writer and everything but the thing is he already written a 50 episode script for reconguista so basically, Tomino already did his best to rewrite the story but in the end it became crammed. Not to mention that the Anime industry don't have a time slot for you to have a 50 episode series, you be lucky to have 25. Besides the point Seed Destiny have a bigger budget that G Reco and a large time slot yet it became garbage. Same with 00 Season 2 it was quite a shit season for 00 and the movie was garbage. Better yet Build Fighters Try also have the same exact problem with a borderline meh."
Gundam,399ic2,Vatepgo1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:25:54 2015 UTC,Tomino should be a big enough name to get 50 episodes if he wants them.
Gundam,399ic2,Tensuke,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"You do know he kept giving Sunrise and Bandai no room for profit, basically from day one Sunrise and Bandai knew they aren't going to get money from Reconguista in G, so that's why they can only give him 25 episodes. Not only that anime this day could only have enough time slot for 12 if lucky you get 25 that way studios could produce more anime and make money."
Gundam,399ic2,Vatepgo1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"I felt the ending was rushed too, but mostly that was just seeing too many events happen in rapid succession with very little room for dramatic tension to rise naturally or for scenes to play out.  However, I thought all the characters got sufficient closure to their story lines.  Peace was achieved, everyone who didn't die had some kind of life they were going to lead and we got to see glimpses of that (even if it was super brief).  It would have been nice to linger a little more and see some more consequences of the show at the end, but we can deduce a lot of what's likely to happen (like Ameria, no longer feeling quite so warlike, now that its President is deposed, and the shipments of energy from the moon is increased).  The only thing I was upset with the ending over was two somewhat irrational things:  1) Bell taking off and leaving Noredo behind was sad (I shipped 'em) but that was something totally to be expected and completely within character.  2) In my heart of hearts, I wanted G-Reco to end with the Turn-A flying over the battlefield, destroying everything in its path with the Moonlight Butterfly.  And if we weren't going to get that, at the very least have some heavy foreshadowing for that, like mention nanomachine tech, or have a prototype sitting in the corner, or have them discover the Turn-X and begin analysis."

They ditched the crappy gameplay changes from 3 as well as the ""Friendship"" system 2 introduced, reintroduced battleships (and made them actually relevant), and playable Mobile Armors.  My only complaint is a lack of a single giant crossover story mode like 1 or 3 had. Instead it's a bunch of mini-crossover stories that have nothing to do with one another."
Gundam,397aym,SolDarkHunter,2,Wed Jun 10 00:21:44 2015 UTC,It's simple mindless fun. I think it's the best out of the 3 that I've played(Hyrule Warriors and Pirate Warriors were the others.)

Gundam,397aym,darthboolean,2,Mon Jun 15 00:04:12 2015 UTC,"Reborn is the only Dynasty Warriors Gundam game that I've played, but I can say that it's a really fun time if you've got someone to do couch co-op with.   There's a ton of mobile suits to choose from, but the selection leans a lot more towards early U.C., more specifically 0079 and Zeta. And there's a lot of MS from Seed and Seed Destiny. I feel like the selection shorted itself at times, though. G Gundam only has Burning Gundam, Master Gundam, and Dark Army(Dark Gundam is an assist). I would have at least expected the whole Shuffle Alliance. Wing is also conspicuously missing Sandrock and Shenron.    Gameplay is simple and fun, and though the maps aren't too varied, I feel like the MS variety and heavy amount of unlockables keep the game from getting stale. I found the upgrade system to be fun to manage as well. The biggest complaint I have with gameplay is that some of the MS are really unbalanced, and not in the way you would necessarily expect.   Wing Gundam Zero is crazy OP while Gundam Epyon is dreadful. Char's Zaku is way better than the Zeong. Turn A is kinda meh while Turn X kicks wholesale ass. So it's sometimes a crapshoot on whether or not your MS is going to have a solid moveset. It doesn't ruin the game by any stretch, but it's something to keep in mind.   Also, make use of the custom soundtrack feature on the game. ""Anime ja Nai"" and Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"" will greatly improve your gameplay experience."

Celestial Being was essentially terrorists, the 3 large nations weren't evil, and the dynamic between the major forces was very interesting. You had to ask yourself questions like ""What right does Celestial Being have to police the rest of humanity?"" ""How are the world nations going to eventually be able to fight them? Did one of the ""heroes"" just murder a bunch of innocent children?"" ""Why does Tieria look like a woman?""  And then Season 2 comes along.. and you just have generic evil bad guys, the ""A-laws"", trying to rip off the Zeta Titans story. Most people prefer Exia to 00 Raiser, Graham is criminally underused, Ribbons is a pretty lame bad guy who doesn't even fight until the very end, and then when he does his mobile suit is meh.

I can sympathize with his viewpoint and do find his case understandable, but in the back of my head I already know he's going to join CB and pilot the 0-Raiser, so I wish they'd just cut to the chase instead of dragging this on).  For the story, I liked seeing the international politics and how CB was rocking the boat for everyone. But by the end of Season 1, that's pretty much gone once all of the nations band together, and then it becomes a more standard 2/3 sided fight."
Gundam,3949ir,chrysamere,3,Tue Jun 9 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"Dude.. I agree that the Saji and Louise scenes were kind of annoying, but I think Saji is perfectly justified for not being happy with Celestial Being. His sister's death and Louise's situation was a DIRECT result of Celestial Being. When Saji learned the truth about the Thrones, he calmed down a lot, but still, the Thrones were an offshoot of Celestial Being. He had a right to question them."
Gundam,3949ir,inimitablegeek,2,Tue Jun 9 04:17:25 2015 UTC,"I think the Saji and Louise scenes from season 1 were a bit superfluous, but they were supposed to depict the civilians' side of the Celestial Being conflict.  The appearance of the Thrones forced them into taking a stance on Celestial Being matter, and by season 2, we see the effects, to the point where they are involved in the actual fighting."
Gundam,3949ir,venom9099,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:08:04 2015 UTC,"It's been a hell of a long time, I watched it while it aired on the Sci-Fy channel, Season 1 was absolutely amazing. Season 2 however, I just couldn't sit there and viably watch it on a week to week basis because like many others have said, it's just totally reverts back to a been there done that show again. I ended up putting it down and skipping Monday night episodes and it took me awhile to go back to it. Gundam 00 would be my favorite AU, if it didn't disappoint me with the 2nd season and movie. But that first season was just totally awesome. Don't misunderstand, that's not to say it wasn't bad when i watched it again, but it really is just disappointing when you lump it with the 1st season...and how much it could have been versus what it came out to be."
Gundam,3949ir,Mirarii,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:48:33 2015 UTC,Probably not hate. Just disappointment coming from the first season. At first it was kind of confusing like the whole AEUG/TITANS who is good/bad thing from Zeta. By the time you figure everything out you are left with a lot more generic style Gundam rather than the awesome political drama and mystery that played out in season one.  And Graham Aker > Mr. Bushido.

Character mortality is necessary for some dramatic weight to the action, but at his worst he goes way overboard with it, in a bad way.  Even as I know that Zeta is my favorite Gundam series, clearly some of the deaths toward the end go beyond dramatic effect, into exploitation.  I'm not saying ""shame on him"" or anything like that, the guy had great reasons for wanting to get that out of his system and I'm glad he did, but post-Victory Tomino has a better handle on how to use character death than 70's/80's Tomino.    G-Reco is a solid 5, ahead of Turn A (I'd call it a 3), but well behind is hey-day 9's and 10's with Victory, Dunbine, Zeta, Ideon, etc."

Gundam,3937h0,-ProFound-,7,Mon Jun 8 23:29:00 2015 UTC,"Jokes aside, from what I understand it was originally tied freedom fighter gunboy. ""Gundam"" is a combination of ""gun"" and ""freedom"". So yea be made it up"
Gundam,3937h0,cactusfag,8,Mon Jun 8 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"I've heard several meanings. Um, in Wing they're made of 'gundanium' alloy. In UC, some suits are made from 'gundarium.'  In the cosmic era, it's an acronym: General Unilateral Neuro-link Dispersive Autonomic Maneuver. Also it's one in Wing: Genetic on Universal Neutraly Different Alloy-nium Mobile suit  .. I could go on.  I will now quote Wikipedia:    During its conceptual phase, the series was titled Freedom Fighter Gunboy, or simply Gunboy for the gun the robot was armed with, and the primary target demographic were shōnen (boys). In the early production stages, there were numerous references to the word ""freedom"": the White Base was originally ""Freedom's Fortress"", the Core Fighter was the ""Freedom Wing"", and the Gunperry was the ""Freedom Cruiser"". The Yatate team combined the English word ""gun"" with the last syllable of the word ""freedom"" to form the name Gundom. Tomino then changed it to the current title, suggesting that Gundam signified a powerful unit wielding a gun powerful enough to hold back enemies, like a hydroelectric dam holding back floods.[5] In keeping with this concept, Gundam in all media that followed are often depicted as singularly unique or limited-production, with much higher capabilities than mass-produced units."

Also I always will recommend Gundam Wing as it was my first gundam experience and still my favorite to this day. Wing is full of amazing mechs,  some drama, and the fights are brutally good and fast paced, though not quite as fast as Gundam 00.   As far as Fighter goes... It is a fun watch as long as you go in with no expectations. It is not your normal Gundam series and the fights are not what I would call epic until much later in the series. In fact they can be quite predictable for the most part. Hope this helps a bit!"

Gundam,394pvf,Air0087,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Check the FAQ for places to watch.  ""Main story lines"" would probably consitute ""UC"" or ""Universal Century"".  There are basically multiple timelines / universes to Gundam.  The ""alternate"" universes usually only have 1-2 series, maybe a movie or two or manga.  The main (UC and beyond) timeline has quite a bit more.  Unicorn is not bad if you are limited on time; episode 4 particularly resonated for me.  I would also check out 08th MS team and a movie called Gundam F91 (very condensed but full of great stuff).  Origin is awesome, but they are still making new episodes, so you'll be left on a cliffhanger.  Eventually you'll want to try to watch the original Gundam tv show or movies (basically condensed version of the tv show).  The animation is dated and it's slow at times but it's the story that set everything else in motion."

Gundam,394pvf,SOLIDninja,6,Tue Jun 9 08:30:03 2015 UTC,"That guy's a bit off in his description of Unicorn. He's confusing Unicorn and The Origin. Unicorn is a sequel to Char's Counterattack. It takes place in the same universe and timeline as the original series but takes place almost 20 years after the events of the original series and 3 years after the events of Char's Counterattack. I still recommend like he does as it's a good place to start because it gives a good overview of the past 30 years of conflicts in-universe as well as taking into account that nobody's been paying attention to the Universal Century story-line in 15-20 years in real life.  The Origin I which came out since Unicorn and is still ongoing(Origin II, III and IV are planned) is a prequel to the original series detailing the lives of Sayla Mass and Char Aznable(Artesia and Casval Deikun their true identities) and how they came to be who they are in the original series from 1979.  Whether or not the rest of The Origin manga which is a remake of the entire original series will get animated is still unknown. They haven't announced anything beyond those 4 episodes that cover the prequel storylines that were a flashback that lasted a few chapters in the middle of the manga."

Gundam,390wnk,cactusfag,2,Mon Jun 8 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think with that many full length shows redoing them all is probably too tall of an order.  My dream scenario is only slightly less impossible, but I'd like a ~10 episode OVA series that covers ZZ and CCA, ideally reanimating them with Unicorn level animation.  Sunrise seems to be generally downplaying ZZ so this would be a chance to reintroduce a lot of the stuff from that series since there's a decent amount that comes into play in Unicorn and hopefully show a lot more of the Neo Zeon Civil War which had too much happen off-screen (plus the mass produced Qubeleys and Queen Mansa were criminally underused).  For CCA I always felt like it had some real pacing issues for basically everything before the final battle and this would either be a chance to actually make Quess and Hathaway decent characters by more fully exploring the newtype tragedy angle or just cutting them out.  And depending on how canon this would be, this series could be made to follow the Zeta movies."

Gundam,390wnk,SpaceKujo,2,Mon Jun 8 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"b   something from CE with a good story. I liked the mech designs and the action that wasn't stock footage.   One of the issues with most AU series that prevents a long franchise is power-levels. At the end of most AU series, the protagonist usually has this uber mech   this would be a good basis as to how the new CE show/manga I'm wishing for would play out. either we see the uber mech brought to its limits or just no uber mech at all."
Gundam,390wnk,BOT_Easy,2,Tue Jun 9 05:49:40 2015 UTC,"I admittedly haven't been following GnoR, or the gunpla shows. Still, my 2 cents: a&b: My dream project would be a crossbone anime, but I'd also be interested in seeing ZZ get a movie compilation like New Translation, especially if it could strip out some (not all) of the absurdity and silliness of it.  Failing that, I'd like to see a new AU and more seriousness. I appreciate Gundam the most as a war drama and like it when the plot is a little bit dark (and I don't mean killing off half the cast in the last episode).  c. Fewer masks (why can't there be more Jerid Mesa types?) and reused plot lines. No more aliens (the stories don't have the same impact when they're fighting something inhuman imo). It'd also be cool to see some better written /more progressive female characters, and hopefully someday more female Gundam pilots (maybe even let one star).  d. I don't know...  CLAMP? They're fans,  and they've proven they can write good female characters and darker storylines.  EDIT: I almost forgot, but for dream projects, can we talk video games? I've had this fantasy for forever where they crossed Gundam with Fire Emblem (the system, not the plot/setting) and I just think it would be so cool to have a team of original characters in a side story you can have interact with each other and perma death and be like SRW but without everyone I don't care about. If they were as well written as the FE characters I'd much rather have original semi cannon plot/characters. Also it'd also be cool to see a UC game that plays like SW Battlefront instead of more Dynasty Warriors spin-offs."

Gundam,391n7r,Qwiser,7,Mon Jun 8 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"Long story short: it's complicated.  There are a lot of rumors that Shinn's character developed into what he is in Destiny because of internal cast drama between the voice actors and the main writer. It's one of the supposed reasons too why Kira and Athrun take over the spotlight as main protagonists in Destiny. Since SEED and Destiny were supposed to be modern remakes of 0079 into Zeta, this supports the theory that internal drama affected the outcome of the plot.  In the case of SRW Z, the VA of Shinn has commented that the portrayal of Shinn and Kira in the series is more accurate as to what Destiny should have been. So too, a lot of other characters in SRW Z point out the unrealistic gary-stu behavior of Kira from time to time in the game.   Of course all of this needs to be taken with a grain of salt, since no one really knows what happens behind closed doors of Sunrise's studio."
Gundam,391n7r,Gfaqshoohaman,2,Mon Jun 8 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Without a complete English Translation of SRWZ, it's hard to make a decision.  I believe that Shinn was supposed to be the 'modern kamille' and Kira was only supposed to have a minor role like amuro had in zeta. Everything in the first half of the series supports this, and then..the second half happened(where they bassicly rehashed seeds ending.)  But bassicly as others have said, internal staff disputes were the problem affecting destiny. There are so many interviews and material that supports this...and perhaps the biggest 2 points are,  Naomi Shindou Cagalli's VA refused to do any VA work for cagalli for almost ten years.. because of the character derailment. Her suddenly voicing  cagalli again, make me wonder that there eight be a movie..in the works again..I mean she held a grudge for that long..  Second point,is that Fukuda was not allowed to direct Cross Ange.  Anyway, the difference between them is ultimately..one has more 'stable writing' and the other has ' let spurn this character to the ground that we spent 30 episodes developing..and shove kira back in there'"
Gundam,391n7r,ShinnAssuka,-6,Thu Jun 11 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, SRW Z Shinn is a pointless character. His (Destiny Shinn) entire purpose as a character is to fall prey to his anger, his trauma and be manipulated by Durandal and become a villlain. Redemption loses his entire purpose. That would be like prequel trilogy Anakin never falling to the Dark Side.  EDIT: Edited because poor wording."
Gundam,391n7r,RJWalker,6,Mon Jun 8 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"I always thought that it was the other way around... from what I've seen.  SRW Z Shinn was the Shinn who was able to move beyond his trauma and shake off Durandal's influence to become a more mature and competent character. His redemption, in my opinion, was an important part of that, since he obviously had most/ all of the hangups that Destiny's Shinn had (+/- one Stella anyway), but unlike that Shinn, he was able to overcome it.  A better example of that IMO going back to the Star Wars example would be Starkiller/ Galen Marek and his clones."

But either way that sucks. I kind of have a feeling that Bandai wants to keep the license for Gundam The Origin OVA to themselves (because if they wanted to sell the rights licisening companies would've definately announced they've acquired the rights to it and maybe I'm naive or something but since Bandai already has a dub version of it, the process should be faster than if it was in Japanese) but I was hoping that I (hopefully) might be wrong."

Unicorn was kinda grimdarkish in the same vein as Zeta and it did pretty well. The Origin isn't exactly edgy but it's pushing a kind of space gothic feeling to it at times in the pre-war era.  I think chances are pretty good. I just hope they don't revert to ""rule of cool"" and pantyshots to sell the next 20+ series. I'm kinda tired of A.U.'s still as well. Build Fighters is great but I'd like to see another side story. Those are always the coolest shit!

Gundam,3905xk,RJWalker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:43:56 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I mean, if you ask me there's a pretty damn clear distinction between both the subject matter and the way it's treated in Zeta and most other series. Zeta goes out of its way to show you an innocent kid being torn apart on the inside from the very outset of the show, whereas, say, First Gundam shows us a kid who is angsty and afraid but is more or less emotionally unaffected by all the death around him.  A good example of the difference in tone between First (and other shows) and Zeta is when you compare the circumstances of Amuro's/Kamille's parents, what impact it had, and how fast it threw that at you."

What I enjoy about the series is the vast array of Mobile Suits being unleashed in chronological order and that it requires both strategic and tactical thinking.  I have learned and become attached to some suits solely through Gihrens Greed, then later see them in the anime and say ""Ohhh that was the suit that crushed the final unit in Jaburo in that one game.""  If I had a translated version, especially story options and skill translations, I feel between replaying all the different storylines and difficulties I would be set for the next decade.   Though I hope a new Gihren's Greed gets released someday.  Overworld is nice as well, but I felt I was grinding the same missions over and over again to unlock certain suits.  I also have little attachment to many of the 00 / Seed / Age series, so there's almost always characters and suits in every battle that I have no affinity toward.  The other thing I would say about translating Gihren's Greed vs other games is that none of the Gihren's Greed games currently have a translation.

Gundam,38wyno,BloodBride,2,Sun Jun 7 17:22:19 2015 UTC,I hear his wife also disliked some of the Japanese VAs and influenced what he planned for the story as a result.
Gundam,38wyno,Char_X_3,9,Sun Jun 7 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"and influenced what he planned for the story as a result   It's a little more that that. During Destiny, Morosawa wrote every episode whereas in SEED she was in charge of the series composition. This is a huge difference and considering she did very little professional writing before Destiny (about 18 episodes from 96-04, most of which were OVAs. OVA's have a much more relaxed schedule than a weekly series), she wasn't up to the task.   Scripts would continuously come in late, meaning the rest of the production was held up. They couldn't animate without those scripts, nor could they voice it. Doesn't help that the show had to cater to celebrities who did voices and wouldn't rearrange their schedule to do so. That's one of the reasons why Destiny is so heavy in flashbacks and stock footage, they had to get the fucker to air. Remember, they were only a few episodes ahead in terms of production.  Various people involved with the show voiced complaints. Animator's made blog posts which Sunrise made them take down. Shinn's VA has said that the Shinn we ended up with isn't what he was told he would be when he took the part, and Lunamaria's has said that it was hard on all the cast. It's even said that when the staff was busting their asses to meet a deadline, Fukuda and his wife went to a concert.  They pissed off a bunch of staff at Sunrise. But Fukuda never lessened his wife's influence. He wouldn't let anyone else write SEED at that point despite criticisms from the fans. When Sunrise/Bandai decided to end the Cosmic Era with the movie, he wouldn't let anyone else write the thing.   Morosawa couldn't get the script in on time, and her and Fukuda were suspended."
Gundam,38wyno,BloodBride,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"Well, that clears stuff up. And makes me dislike her more than I already did."
Gundam,38wyno,Char_X_3,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:06:54 2015 UTC,"I heard a little about the staff problems but I didn't know it was that bad with fukuda and his wife. But fukuda was given cross ange by sunrise wasn't he, so does that mean that sunrise may let him work with seed again since they trusted him with a new show?"
Gundam,38wyno,KikiFlowers,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:52:31 2015 UTC,"1) Cross Ange is a lower budget show that aired in the middle of the night whereas Gundam is Bandai/Sunrise's flagship. The expectations to succeed for the both of them are completely different.  2) Fukuda's now running around saying Cross Ange was successful enough to warrant an extension, but Sunrise isn't interested as they are focusing on some ""long-existing franchise"". He's urging fans to let Sunrise know they want more.  Cross Ange's bluray sales are average for a late-night anime, but nothing special. Gundam Reconguista in G, despite what ANN says, has sold more than it.   This kinda makes Sunrise look bad to those unaware of the actual numbers. That's generally not a good thing to do.  3) It's been almost 10 years since Destiny ended. Most of the SEED fanbase have already moved on to other shows (They certainly didn't stay for 00).  4) Gundam's star merchandise is Gunpla models. Despite having incredible DVD sales and ratings, supposedly the Gunpla weren't flying off the sales during Destiny. You hear stories of aisles of unsold kits, rotting on the shelves with their prices slashed. The only suits that sold, according to legend, were the one's piloted by Kira.   5) Destiny pissed a lot of fans off, and not just the fans in North America. The Japanese Gundam fanbase voice many of the same complaints the American ones do. This may have had an effect on point 4. They were making Gundam for people who didn't watch Gundam, which alienated the people who did.   6) The Cosmic Era was supposed to be the new Universal Century, a vast universe home to many stories. Stargazer didn't do as well as they hoped, very few of SEED's fans cared about Astray, the Mobile Suit Variations line flopped. It became clear that the people Fukuda attracted to the franchise didn't care about anything other than Kira, Athrun, and Lacus.  As a result, the timeline was supposed to be brought to a close with the non-existent movie. They realized they couldn't milk the setting as they had hoped.  7) Again, Fukuda won't let anyone but his wife write Gundam SEED. They're a package deal. While they may have given Fukuda the chance to do the HD Remasters and Cross Ange, Morosawa still hasn't done any other work since. Considering how many problems were caused by her and her condition, she's not that desirable.  There's probably more, but I'm drawing a blank to right now."

Fukuda apparently has a terrible relationship with the SEED VAs and production staff; IIRC Shinn and Cagalli's characters got nerfed because their VAs complained about how shitty of a job Fukuda and his wife were doing, and the production staff hate him for going out to concerts and shit while they were struggling to keep the show going."

Gundam,38wyno,Ace370,6,Mon Jun 8 08:00:03 2015 UTC,"Cross Ange was a show developed for a really niche market, and it was made just to sell Bluray discs. It's not a flagship show and it is definitely in no way at the same level of a Gundam show. As much as Fukuda loves to kiss the ass of the Sunrise execs, I don't think he's proven himself in any way. Sunrise doesn't need Fukuda for another SEED-related show, especially when they've already milked both SEED and Destiny through the HD Remakes.   Sunrise also has to look at it's in-house studio costs. For the past few years, UC/RC era shows have taken up most of it's budget (with Gundam The Origin being the newest entry), which is why they've kept around the 00 Studio for all the Misc. Gundam shows (Age, Build Fighters, Build Fighters Try). It's actually cheaper for them to continue using that studio for milking the franchise (Build Fighters sold A LOT of gunpla) while the other Gundam studio focuses on their flagship content. The rest of the Sunrise studios focus on non-Gundam shows. Now, throwing Gundam SEED into the mix means they have to rearrange things and put money into something that will mitigate a guaranteed revenue stream. Likewise, it's been 10 years since Destiny finished and the only selling point they'd have for a movie would be nostalgia.   Given the amount of production problems they had with Fukuda vs. everyone else, Sunrise would have to drop a hefty amount of change to get everyone back to work on something that is not guaranteed to work."

I've been buying the Origin manga as they come out, too, an spread out over that much time they're pretty affordable.  I don't have the Origin OVA, though.  I'm too American to ever pay for a DVD or Blu Ray that only has one episode on it.

Gundam,38r5bk,GenesisEra,6,Sat Jun 6 11:41:47 2015 UTC,"It has a lot of names. Masami Obari is the animator that they most associate it with, so they named it the Obari Pose or the Obari Perspective (I think this is the most correct term because it's the perspective that it's shot at that makes it special). Obari used it when he was working on Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird, so it's also called the Yuusha pose. And it's in a lot of Sunrise anime, so people also call it the Sunrise stance.  It's based on a perspective that Yoshinori Kanada used before. In fact, a lot of the images in OP's picture (such as the Lion O) aren't in  Obari's perspective, but Kanada's. You can tell the difference because Obari has his figures posed at a 45 degree angle opposite the camera."

As for reading order, Astray and Astray R ran at the same time, towards the end of Astray's release. So there is some overlap, but as long as you read Astray first, you'll be fine. In all honesty, R isn't that great, in my opinion. It's borderline ecchi at some points. After that comes Astray X. All three of those series have been licensed and are out of print from Tokyopop.  There are three Destiny Astray series as well, but I honestly have never read them and they're not licensed, nor do they have a consistent scanlating following.  Hope the info helped."

Gundam,38s4dw,GutturalOne,8,Sat Jun 6 09:44:11 2015 UTC,"With Fukuda, I think there are some problems that can be linked back to him.  Firstly, he appears to operate on what TV Tropes describes as ""rule of cool."" If he thinks it's cool, he'll do it no matter how illogical it may be. The go-to example of this is all the posing done by SEED's mobile suits and characters surviving instances where they shouldn't have. He tries to make everything look as awesome as possible.  Unfortunately, this leads to the second part. He doesn't take things as seriously as he should. He doesn't really understand the mechanics of how things in his shows work but is unconcerned about it because, again, rule of cool. Take Shinn stabbing Destroy Gundam's with the non-beam part of his ASS. Shouldn't be possible because of the Destroy's Phase-Shift Armor, but still happens.   I think there is also an element of ego to him as well. With Cross Ange, ANN reported that it was successful enough to warrant more. Why? Because Fukuda was going around telling people it was and to let Sunrise know they wanted more (because Sunrise wasn't interested and was focusing on another ""long-lasting franchise"").   Thing is, Cross Ange sold worse than G-Reco (which ANN called a failure and never updated it's sales figures). Yeah. Maybe Cross Ange didn't make them lose money, but it wasn't successful enough that Sunrise was eager to start milking it.  We've also heard from Japanese Gundam fans that he occasionally makes comments that sounds like he's deriding other Gundam shows.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/2ytkn3/so_i_got_the_chance_to_ask_some_japanese_anime/  It's kinda telling how he can create one of the most successful animes ever just to have his career die like it did."

Gundam,38s4dw,Char_X_3,3,Sat Jun 6 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"It wasn't so much a flop. Cross Ange did about average for a late-night anime targeted at otaku. The first volume sold really well, over 10k units sold, but it contained a ticket to a Nana event. After that, sales fell to somewhere in the 4-5k range. Again, that's average for something of Cross Ange's nature but nothing really special.   G-Reco has been somewhat more well-received over in Japan. It sold within the 6-7k range, and was rated the third best anime airing in January's issue of Newtype (Bellri was the 4th best male character).   If you try to compare it's sales with the rest of the franchise, please keep in mind that G-Reco aired late night (like Cross Ange) whereas previous installments aired in more accessible times. SEED, iirc, aired at 7 pm, which is prime time. This actually bit Fukuda in the ass when the show implied Kira and Fllay had sex. Parent's were outrage at the implication and he was fined by Sunrise...then he turned around and had the act animated for the special editions...then made the openings to Destiny which had Cagalli in her panties...then added nipples and pantyshots to the HD Remasters."
Gundam,38s4dw,godblow,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:08:18 2015 UTC,G-Reco was well received by fans enough for both the show and it's MC to score really high in the Newtype Popularity poll; IIRC G-Reco was ranked in top 3 and Bellri Zenam was top 5 or something.

Unless I'm totally misunderstanding this, asking about why he uses messianic characters all the time is the same as asking why Tomino uses children that don't have anything to do with what's going on somehow ending up being the main characters.

Gundam,38pvqh,super1upqueen,3,Fri Jun 5 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone! This is my third video in which I sync up an 80s song to the opening of a Gundam show. Today I present to you Turn A Gundam's first opening to David Bowie's classic hit ""Let's Dance."" For those who know this song, you probably know why I chose it: the lyric ""under the moonlight."" However, Bowie doesn't sing that until halfway through the song, so I actually had to edit this time (with my two previous videos, I literally just dropped the song over the opening and it worked perfectly). So the song has been changed, but only a little (cut out a portion of the middle to attach a few lyrics to each other, making the song fit the opening and the show better). I will admit, this video isn't nearly as good as my previous efforts, but I just had to pay some respect to not only David Bowie and Turn A, but also the apparent loving relationship between Gundam shows and 80s western music. Enjoy! P.S. here are my previous videos: Stardust Memory's first opening set to Danger Zone (blocked in Germany and USA) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bhCMoMYXfo and Victory's second opening set to Hearts on Fire (blocked in Germany and Japan) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar1owoF93FE"

Gundam,38qha5,-ProFound-,5,Sat Jun 6 05:12:45 2015 UTC,Gundam Wing. Heero's laugh had me hooked.
Gundam,38qha5,godblow,5,Sat Jun 6 02:48:17 2015 UTC,"Unicorn, 08thMS, Wing. Admittedly the last was viewed when I was considerably younger."
Gundam,38qha5,Zonetr00per,4,Sat Jun 6 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"Gundam Wing  My first Gundam show, but I was so young I don't recall; I know I was hooked on the first episode I saw, but it wasn't the first episode, I got in to it a bit later.  0083: Stardust Memory  Followed that up with 0083, which didn't really hook me, but as a fan of the metaseries as a whole, I stuck through it and really enjoyed it after a few episodes.  08th MS Team  08th MS Team was next, and that hooked me on the first episode.   0080: War in the Pocket  When I watched 0080 for the first time, I thought it was boring all the way through, but I stuck through it, and when i look back on it, it was far better than I originally thought.  Mobile Suit Gundam  After sitting through 08th, 0083, and 0080; MSG was hard to watch. The animation wasn't the greatest, and I couldn't get into any of the characters, the only thing that kept me going was the fact that it was the ""main"" story of UC so I felt an obligation to watch it.  Char's Counterattack  There's just something about this movie that had me hooked in merely minutes. I loved 0083 and 08th MS Team, but CC really moved the UC timeline up my favorites list.  SEED  Probably the first Gundam series I watched when it was still considered ""new"" (waiting for episodes), felt similar to MSG, but newer. I was semi-hooked on the first episode, but was definitely sold by episode 3. The Cosmic Era/SEED timeline became my favorite Gundam timeline after watching this, previously held by Gundam Wing.  SEED Destiny  After SEED, Destiny was a shoe-in for me.  Gundam 00  Super solid intro, had me hooked instantly. Probably my second favorite timeline of the Gundam metaseries.  Unicorn  Brought me back into the UC in an amazing way. First episode hooked me well, great series.  G Gundam  For some reason, I just could not stand this series. I couldn't get into it at all. I gave it like 5 episodes, and it failed to hook me. This is the only Gundam timeline that has had this affect on me."

I felt that when you did see the Zeta Gundam transform in ZZ, it was slowed down and used much less often. I also felt that seeing Kamille in ZZ was more fulfilling then seeing Amuro in Z witch felt empty and awkward."
Gundam,38lfj0,rms141,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:11:36 2015 UTC,"I feel the same.  I also like how they show the main weakness of the ZZ, how long it took to transform.  I wish they had given Amuro a little bit more time in Zeta, and I think it would be very interesting to see what he's up to in ZZ since he obviously leaves Hayato before Dublin."
Gundam,38lfj0,wavyhairedsamurai,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:32:57 2015 UTC,ZZ is really good even though its cool to hate it. The first 20 or so episodes are funny which some people have a problem with but then it gets dark after that. I loved the entire thing... even moon moon.
Gundam,38lfj0,Dudewitbow,2,Fri Jun 5 02:04:36 2015 UTC,Moon Moon is so blown out of proportion especially because its one of the few episodes in the first 20 that actually progresses the plot
Gundam,38lfj0,Kafukator,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:00:02 2015 UTC,"My big problem with ZZ is its failure to depict the full scale of its conflict. While Neo Zeon wasn't a huge faction, it still kept the combined EFSF/AEUG/Karaba on the defensive for a year.  Gundam Sentinel does more for ZZ than ZZ does for itself at times.  Edit: remembered Karaba, put them in. And that's another point: the Gryps War and the First Neo Zeon War have never accurately depicted or explained Karaba's actions. It's a huge missing chunk of UC history that would be well served to be depicted in manga or OVA form."
Gundam,38lfj0,Kafukator,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"I really loved ZZ, and I was confused as to why it got so much hate when it finished. Yeah, the beginning was really slow. Yeah, the kids were pretty infuriating towards the start (I wished death on Beecha and Mondo SO MANY TIMES). However it really does make up for it starting around when they reach Dakar. The characters develop over time, and the action becomes more interesting with them.  Judau was a really cool main character too. I was sad to hear that he doesn't really exist in much outside of the Crossbone manga I have yet to read."
Gundam,38lfj0,OZKai,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"he appears in the V gundam side story manga as well. The reason why you dont see him much is ZZ ending Spoiler:He leaves leina at the end and heads on an expedition that head towards jupiter. It is likely that he stayed on this trip for a long time because of the fact that he appears in Crossbone, which is based around jupiter."

Gundam,38lv3w,Solitak,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'd have to go with the Superior Gundam since it has a learning AI that also can override the pilot in dire situations, the ability to use both incom bits and funnels, and finally it's smart beam gun; you essentially don't need a perfect lock on to a target or need to point the barrels directly at them since it fires at an arc. Mobility wise it's somewhat on the same level as the ZZ but is able to do a lot more damage in fighter mode. When it gets the Ex-S upgrade it essentially becomes a high assault ms that can utilize the Hummingbird booster for extended battle periods. But the one thing that somewhat sets it apart from other Gundam Type MS is that both Newtypes and Oldtypes can equally use it to competent levels."
Gundam,38lv3w,BlackRavenous,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"The S Gundam.  The ZZ Gundam is slower, has no remote weaponry, its weapons rapidly drain its reactor, its structural integrity is weak, it is incredibly complex to even use, and it is extremely bulky. Not to mention that I can't even use the biosensor and remotely control the other parts like Judau can.  The S Gundam has ALICE, an AI that can rapidly evolve and adapt, and can essentially save my life. The S Gundam also has the Smartgun, a much more accurate weapon that can exceed even the Double Beam Rifle. The S Gundam also has the ability for an all range attack through INCOMs, which humans can use. Lastly, it has hip-mounted beam cannons that are extremely versatile. I expect that the S Gundam is much faster and maneuverable than the G-Fortress too."

So I'll give you a list of the timeline of series in UC that have been dubbed in english.  *MS Origin 1:Blue Eyed Casval    (This is kind of a prequel deal so you could and probably should watch this much later but timewise it's first.)   *Mobile Suit Gundam    (the original series, kind of painful if you watch the full series, it's probably best to go with the 3 movie trilogy.)   *Mobile suit Gundam 08th MS Team    (Very gritty awesome series, many in the west find this their favorite series.)   *0080 War in the pocket    (short series that is very unique in the gundam universe, still a great series though and almost has a studio ghibli feel at times.)   *0083 Stardust Memory   (Another great gundam series that has drawn comparisons to western 80s movies namely Top Gun, still uniquely gundam though.)   *Mobile Suit Gundam Zeta    (Widely considered the favorite gundam by the fandom in the east and west.)   *Char's Counterattack    (Amazing Movie)   *Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn    (Modern Gundam that tries to go back to the style of the older flagship gundam series)   At this point there is a Timeskip from UC 0096 to UC 0123  *Mobile Suit Gundam F91    (Another great Gundam movie)   *Manga    Not sure if you're into manga but one of the best mangas in the gundam universe takes place after F91 called MSG Crossbone, there are also a few other really good translated manga that take place earlier in the UC timeline.   That's it for dubbed series in the UC universe remember that there are 9 universes in total although UC is by far the longest."

Oh and there's a myriad of SD series, and of course Build Fighters.  I believe the go to suggestion is watch them in Production order, So Dub only would be: Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, Char's Counter Attack and then 8th MS Team, Stardust Memory and Unicorn.

Gundam,38ir7k,BloodBride,3,Thu Jun 4 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"Apparently, there is a reason for why Strike Rouge is pink, according to the setting on Variable Phase Shift (VPS) armor of the Impulse gundam, the colour of Phase Shift armor reflects its defense ability with brighter colour being the strongest and most energy consuming and therefore close combat Sword Impulse appears red and Blast Impulse is black/green.   For a ""commander"" or important figure like Cagali, the output of Strike Rouge's PS armor is tuned up intentionally, and when Kira use it in Destiny, he used the normal setting with the standard colour scheme. As for why this changing output ability is available before MS with VPS armor is even a thing is another matter."

He is kind of like a good father and excellent mentor for New Types.  I think the is tactically sound and has gotten out of tight situations countless of times.  But mostly because he is able to bring the best out of his crew.    He is also very aware of politics that go on and includes that into some of his tactical decisions."

The reason is that the western writers can have the creative freedom needed to create a new lore and properly needed to make a good film  And if they managed to make a UC movie, not only it will piss off fans, but poses huge risk and difficulties for Hollywood,  If that proposed Alternate Universe movie did so shit, Bandai/Sunrise could easily ignore it and considered as ""Non-Cannon"". With the crapfest of G-Saviour, they are reluctant to call it cannon because it technically was part of the UC timeline"
Gundam,38fva9,pointblanker,7,Thu Jun 4 05:19:04 2015 UTC,"With Pacific Rim, it's certainly possible to be done well.   In my opinion, a rough adaption of 0079/Origin, made into three parts. Part one would focus more on the EFF and White Base with the reveal of Sayla as a Deikun and Char as Casval near the end. Part two would be more of the Zeon back story/mobile suit development/EFF response/Origin and going into space. Part three would be all out war and the downfall of the Zabis and Zeon."

As opposed to retaining the WWII-in-space thing, or any residual late-70s stuff, or anachronistic tech.  In other words, take the plot of First Gundam from the beginning to Garma's death, and put it into its own AU, which can sink or swim with the success of the film, leaving the rest of the franchise pristine if it's embarrassing. Possible sequels can go on their own path, diverging from the OYW story, perhaps borrowing from Tomino's alternate endings, like the main character's death.  I don't know how you'd incorporate a Newtype theme into a film that takes itself seriously today, though. Such mutations shouldn't happen after mere centuries of life in space. Not unless there are latent mutations we already have, which would be ""activated"" if we lived in space over many years. Or if it was a purely psychological, behavioral change. But then, no afterlife or actually telepathy, just high intuition, prediction, and empathy. (That's where I originally thought First was going, until I met Lalah.) I do think a Gundam story needs something like that, a symbol of hope in human progress."

(Kai, Hayato, Amuro, Mirai even Bright is from Hong Kong) And Hollywood is pretty bad about representing Asians. I'd fully expect Amuro to be a White guy with a clearly Japanese Name and the only one to retain their ethnicity to be Hayato because he's such a bit part."

Gundam,38fva9,lotto77102,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Hollywood really can't do anything with the UC Timeline. Sunrise and Bandai won't allow it, considering the disaster that was G-Saviour.   Gundam is so intertwined with politics and ideologies that the normal American wouldn't really get it at all, considering they would enter the theater with literally no Gundam knowledge at all (Gundam is primarily a niche audience in America, unlike in Japan). Gundam also relies on long and drawn out character development, like Amuro, Kamille, Judau, or other characters. This reliance on complex character development makes it hard to compress everything down into a single movie. Gundam also has complex themes like Newtypes, true peace, pacifism, hope, the evolution of humanity, and how conflicts arise from space colonization.   I would say it's kinda like a Japanese Star Trek with mechs, but that's just me.   I would expect a Western Gundam movie to be an AU, whether stemming from existing sources or creating their own. It probably would act either similarly to Pacific Rim and/or G Gundam, with mech fights and such or a more politically/war focused movie series that is either in a trilogy or a tetralogy."

American youth could really relate to Hero's (and all of the Wing pilots beside Katra and duo) manic depressive identity crisis meaning of life personalities huhuh. But in a perfect world the director would hopefully make a trilogy based off Seed. I do agree that 08th and stardust are short enough to possible encapsulate into one movie (and those are both some of my favorite series) but I don't think 08th captures a complete enough picture of the idea/theme/feeling of gundam, stardust I would say gives a bit more of a complete ""feeling"" but still not as much as Seed or Wing.  I could also see them making a contemporary version of mobile suit gundam and keeping it pretty simple and cutting it down to its core ideals and conflicts with artistic license although that could be good I think it would end up being unfortunate"
Gundam,38fva9,breauxthomps,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Hard to say on this, if they want to make Gundam , they better hire a director who is actually respecting Gundam franchise and is actually a japanese mecha fanboy in the first place before anything else.  To make One Year War live adaption requires more than just pretty graphics, they also have to translate those 80s japanese ideology to modern hollywood movie audience. The barrier here would be trying to portray the emotion of the character , despite what most people think, Gundam is actually a revolved around heavily emotional character, and I rarely seen those emotion can be portrayed very good on most Hollywood movie. Just take a look at recent hollywood superheroes movies, they have a good battle, comedy, but no real emotion around character at all. That's where the core of Gundam series is.   Also with all this political correctness that heavily invested amongst the current SJW, hipster, feminist generation hard to portray someone ( esp woman) getting Bright slapped on the movie , or underage kid getting thrown to the jail because of his rebel attitudes."

Despite being out performed by later mobile suits of the SRA during the 7th Space War, the Jenice continued to be operated throughout the war as the SRA's main mobile suit.

Let me compare and see if there are ones I have that aren't here.  I have 161 pics in my folder as well haha.  Here is what I came up with.  There still might be a few repeats from your post in there.  That is a lot of stuff to go through for me.
Gundam,38g7l1,victorXvictory,6,Thu Jun 4 00:23:55 2015 UTC,"My own opinion is that this dynamism and depth of character is what essentially makes the Gundam universe, especially the Universal Century, so appealing. When you look through most of the Gundam timeline, there are a few people who are moral good and chaotic evil, but there are characters who populate the entire spectrum of alignments, and this brings a healthy breath of life into the series and overall metaverse."
Gundam,38g7l1,hadenklw,4,Thu Jun 4 00:58:02 2015 UTC,"Char has the longest developed history of any character in all of the Gundam franchises. Period. But part of his charm is that he is technically a side character in most of the series where he plays a major role. The Origin kind of minimizes the events of 0079 (and Amuro as a protagonist) incidentally because it's expanding on the pre-OYW history, which follows Char and Sayla as their backstory is incredibly important to the history of the Universal Century as a whole."
Gundam,38g7l1,Gfaqshoohaman,2,Thu Jun 4 03:49:02 2015 UTC,"Except if we were following Char we'd just see him Kick Ass until he gets to Side 7 then lose to the Gundam until the end of the OYW. I don't think that'd be a good story.   Also inherently complex characters I think work better in written form than on TV or in Movies. Char's backstory and feelings can take up an entire chapter in a book but on a show they need to push along to maintain interest and fit inside their small time window.  Really though, UC Gundam is the story of Human Evolution and that Evolution is best represented by its three main characters; Amuro, Kamille and Judau. Char runs antithesis to Tomino's vision and that's why he's relegated to Rival, Mentor or Villain in his works."
Gundam,38g7l1,Palikun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"Protagonist? Absolutely not, he wouldn't have the arrogant charm and anti-hero feel to him that he does cuz he is an antagonist."

I hope I'm wrong, though. Maxi Boost is on a roll! I was totally not expecting to see Astray Red Dragon.  Hopefully we'll get some more to come. I know that Maxi Boost still has to release Build Strike (Full Package).

The same goes with Devil Gundam, Psycho Gundam and Destroy Gundam.

It was an artifact of the Sixth Civilization (the sixth sentient alien race that Earth found evidence of existing on another planet). During their attempts to analyze the various Ideon machines, a new alien race known as the Buff Clan attacked humanity. The Buff Clan feared that Earth's objective was to revive the Giant God to use against them. In order to stop them they carried out a series of attacks on the colonists, which prompted them to combine the machines to form the Ideon to fight them off. Finding the Ideon initially to only have its fists and its bladed feet available to defend itself, the Solo colonists armed it with both missiles and Glenn Cannons. They then used it to defend against the repeated assaults of the Buff Clan. As the Buff Clan attacked their colony the colonists fled and the humans found and repaired another relic of the Sixth Civilization, a large vessel with self-contained hydroponics they named the Solo Ship.

I also thought Glemy and Mashymre Cello where pretty cool villans.   If anyone hasn't seen ZZ Gundam, I would suggesting watching it, the ending battle with Full Armored ZZ was great."

This means that it is not incredible if you didn't like nearly half of the show. No offence, I'm just confused by the way you stated it, as it seems less than incredible, mediocre if you will, because of the way you set up your own post."
Gundam,38bjiu,existingsvb,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:12:58 2015 UTC,What I mean is that it got so good after that it became worth it to get through the beginning. Its not that it was that bad its just that it wasnt gripping. But once I saw the rest I appreciated everything it was trying to accomplish from beginning to end.
Gundam,38bjiu,calgar4195,5,Mon Jun 8 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"i loved ZZ and how it was funny but then got serious. i loved the characters judau was a punk but he grew up in front of you, i loved how they re-used the gundams from zeta and kept some characters from zeta as well. the villains in the beginning were corny and lame but at the end i loved how they became evil its seriously one of the best gundams in my opinion. (about villains haman isnt part of the corny category since she is badass)"
Gundam,38bjiu,j_futures,2,Wed Jun 3 04:02:08 2015 UTC,Shes phenomenal. I agree with all of that. In a way I felt like when zz got rolling it was a better follow up to zeta than zeta was to Gundam.
Gundam,38bjiu,Palikun,2,Wed Jun 3 04:30:50 2015 UTC,I ment as far as tone
Gundam,38bjiu,OZKai,2,Wed Jun 3 04:36:41 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I actually just stumbled across a 720p version to replace the 480p version I used from my chronological UC run through last summer.
Gundam,38bjiu,carlosraruto,2,Wed Jun 3 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"To me, honestly, it made since with the attitude between Zeta and ZZ. In the beginning of ZZ, Kamile and co. weren't affected by the Gryps Conflict as the crew of the Nahel Argama were. So of course the kids were more light-hearted and easy going. And once ZZ started getting serious, it made more sense to me. That's why ZZ is so great to me personally. Definitely underrated."
Gundam,38bjiu,sdwoodchuck,3,Wed Jun 3 05:32:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Feel like the Real problem people have with ZZ is they wanted it to just pick up where Zeta left off which leads them to rush into it which causes Mood Whiplash.   I'd definitely suggest watching something else in between the two, just to give some distance from Zeta's ending and ZZ's beginning. Because ZZ really is its own story that just happens to wrap up the loose ends left hanging in Zeta."
Gundam,38bjiu,sdwoodchuck,2,Wed Jun 3 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"I thought ZZ was quite good. The opening episodes didn't really bother me that much, though I'd been prepared for them for quite sometime.

It really wasn't explained too well. Even so, I liked it a lot. The comedy at the start reminded me of reconguista.

Haven't seen Zeta's movies, but they changed the ending apparently. ZZ doesn't have movies.  Speaking of movies, watch F91. It's not spectacular, but it looks amazing and will make you wish it'd been a TV series or OVA instead."

Gundam,38bf81,Nunjin,2,Thu Jun 4 04:27:38 2015 UTC,"The Zeta movies doesn't lead into ZZ so that could get confusing if you only watch the movies. That said the movies are definitely worth watching the remastered/added scenes are beautiful.

The rest of the show is in 720p cause it was produced with 16mm film.     Are you referring to Wing and 0079? I only encode 1080p if the source warrants it. Old 16mm seldom resolves much more above 720p. 0079 actually, believe it or not, comes close (they did some stellar remastering job on it), but it still doesn't really visibly improve at 1080. 35mm sources get 1080p because they hold significantly more detail.

(basically I can't think of a UC unit that has stealth technology)  Oh yeah, bonus, V Gundam would probably fit on all of them, Gundam (RX-78-2) would fit on all but Caster and Assassin, there's really a lot of multi-purpose Gundams that would probably be summonable as different types too, most likely stacking Saber, Archer, and Rider.  Note when I meant multiple types, from what I remember on Fate's ""hero class system"", some heroes really can be summoned as one of many possible classes. Gilgamesh is the no-brainer classic as he can be Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, and maybe Caster. Arthuria can be summoned as Saber, Lancer, and Rider. Hercules can be Saber. That Rider king in /Zero (forgot his name) could also fall under Saber and Lancer, it all depends on the ""hero's lore"".

There are a couple of good Lancers out there, though! More than one or two mobile suits use polearms; the issue is finding a strong enough one to be a Heroic Gundam. RX-78-2 used a beam trident in the TV airing of MSG, the GN-X III and IV units from 00 used lances a lot, I think one of the Tallgeese units had one, but I'm going to go with something else: Quebley Papillion. Butterfly wings, funnels, and a terrifying lance! Invisible funnels make a scary Noble Phantasm move when she's in Embody mode!  Funnily enough, Cu Chullain is actually Caster in the new game that's coming to iOS/Android soon, Fate/Grand Order."

I was aware that Gundam used a beam trident, and a lot of other mobile suits, but I'm not sure if that's enough to qualify them as a ""Lancer"". I did forget Quebley Papillion though, such shame. And Tallgeese 3, but I'm not really that versed in anything outside of UC.  I actually added anything that has a mobility-pack, apart from transformables, like item to the Rider class, this can actually include Double X with the Falcon armor thingy. They're the ones that are really better suited as ""Riders"" since, well, they ride. GP-03 Dendrobium ""Stamen"" also can fall as a Rider. Penelope has the Minovsky Flight Craft and has a different name without it, but it's successor, the Xi, has that integrated so it cannot be a ""Rider"" any more.  Gundams really just tend to be much more varied than a heroic spirit so it's not surprising for so many of them to stack on Saber and Archer classes though, especially since most of them are built to be multi-purpose units the further they get in their timelines."
Gundam,386xf5,cf18,2,Tue Jun 2 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like the efreet would be a good assassin for UC, especially the Efreet Nacht, and maybe also the Jesta/ Dom (black tristars)"
Gundam,386xf5,cactusfag,2,Tue Jun 2 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"Lancer - if we allow lance weapons instead of just longer spear weapons then these fits: Gyan, GN-XIII, various Crossbone Vanguard units."
Gundam,386xf5,zypher106,2,Tue Jun 2 22:08:08 2015 UTC,Crossbone for assassin. Fast and melee centered  ironically the purpose of that design is to disable suits without destroying the pilot. But that delicacy is an attribute of an assassin
Gundam,386xf5,ghostFOUR7,3,Wed Jun 3 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"Saber - Probably one of the Exia line, Exia, 00 or 00 Qan[T]. I would personally go with Exia since it's sword is the greatest focus unlike the 00 line which branches into more jack of all trades.  Archer - Before going into this, I feel it's worth pointing out that the archer is based on two primary characteristics. The first somewhat obvious one is that archer must possess powerful ranged or projectile based weapons. The second is more difficult to find. The archer class has a high capability for independent action leading to their use as scouts. That said, I can of wing gundam as well as the dynamas line for both their long range bombardment tactics and their use in independent operations (operation meteor and celestial beings armed interventions respectively)  Lancer - Thankfully quite straightforward. Fast and uses a spear. This gives a few options. Death Scythe uses the something akin to a spear but isn't particularly fast. That being said, I purpose a somewhat abnormal choice. Stargazer Gundam. Its close combat range is surprisingly long with its beam rings and it is one of the fastest gundams, surpassed in some scenarios by only the transforming mobile suits. It would likely be used similar to Lancer of Black with its beam rings being used in combat similar to Lancer's Spear summoning.  Caster - Again, have a slightly unconventional choice. Every caster seen up to this point has had some kind of summoning ability. As such, I would choose something with funnels or bits. That said, I would go with Nu Gundam, Kshatriya (Not gundams, I know but generally used as ace customers in that universe anyway), or Legilis (I know, gundam age, but it does work)  Berserker - ""Has to have gone mad at some point"". Banshee Gundam or Nobel Gundam  Rider - Technically the requirement is that it has to be famous for riding. That said, they normally also have very powerful noble phantasms. I would go with Zeta gundam, mostly for its pilot and his new type magic as well as the obvious transformation.  Assassin - Really only one choice here, seeing as this class can't be powerful in direct combat and can't have any directed combat oriented phantasms. Blitz Gundam. Not good in direct combat but has that mirage colloid that lets it cloak for short periods of time."
Gundam,386xf5,spgfc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:28:19 2015 UTC,"I chose 00 Raiser instead of Exia because Raiser Sword is so similar to Excalibur, but the whole line fits pretty well.  Good pick on Wing! Independent Operations is indeed a core requirement. A lot of people pick true-GN drive units, like Dynames, for this quality too.  Not bad with Lancer. I like unconventional. I think Stargazer would be a better fit for Caster, personally, but I could definitely see it here. Funnily enough, UBW's Lancer is also Caster in the new game coming out! Fate/Stay Night & Fate/Grand Order spoilers  Funnels for Caster make more sense than funnels for archer, I think. People like blondie too much, I daresay, haha.  Banshee is even better than Unicorn for Berserker. Good pick.  Blitz is a perfect Assassin, too! I don't know any other cloaking mobile suit. I guess any other stealth suit could work, including some of Zeon's more experimental stuff after the OYW, and maybe even the Gundam Throne Drei from 00 with its stealth field."
Gundam,386xf5,forte7,3,Tue Jun 2 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"Archer - Exia/00 (all those blades)  Other than that, I'm not really sure."

Archer- Gundam dynames/ Wing Gundam  Lancer- Shenlong Gundam  Caster- Neo Zeong  Berserker- Destroy Gundam  Rider- Master Gundam Fuunsaiki  Assassin- Deathscythe Gundam/ Sandrock Gundam  It was pretty hard to think of good Gundam that would fit the term.

Gundam Info's streaming is not completely HD.  The seed subtitle quality drops on one or two episodes, on the gundam.info site.  Visually. The difference is more noticeable in some places but not the majority. I recommend the SD version of seed, over the HD version...because it is dubbed..and subtitle quality is better.

Gundam,3881wz,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:23:25 2015 UTC,Turn A is strongest
Gundam,3881wz,Gundam336,2,Thu Jun 4 01:49:49 2015 UTC,Naruto  But in all seriousness let me assume you meant what Gundam has the most overall fire power. Honestly it depend on the writer and the universe.  Universal Century: Anything with a Psycomu system and a new-type in it. Nu Gundam for example or Unicorn Gundam.   After War Gundam X: double X gundam has enough fire power to make 5 km wide craters with ease so I would go with that  After Colony Gundam Wing: Wing Zero can nuke colonies with ease and is overall seen as OP.
Gundam,3881wz,TitaniumHeart,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"this is basically what i meant it really depends on the universe / series as to which is the strongest and it is hard to compare across multiple series  from a story perspective supposedly Turn A takes place at the end of all gundam times lines and during it's 'dark history' the Turn A basically destroyed all other mobile suits/gundams so it is the strongest but some gundams that have been created after the series Turn A was made have some really BS OP powers/abilities like Unicorn and Quan[T] (Quan[T] for example can cross the galaxy in like a second and is basically literally capable of out running moonlight butterfly from Turn A, it could just teleport out of range)"
Gundam,3881wz,Beginning_Gunpla,3,Wed Jun 3 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"Except Turn A also process teleportation ability of its own, even though the limit of Turn A's teleportation is unknown, it's ""predecessor"" Turn X, is designed to have inter-galactic travel capability, so it's safe to assume Turn A can also travel very far in a short amount of time.   Also, Qan[T] do not have any means to significantly damage Turn A, with its self-repairing mechanism and moonlight butterfly that prevent Qan[T] from even getting in range, therefore unless running is winning, Qan [T] doesn't stand a chance, nobody does. Like it has been mentioned many times before, it is just simply not fair to put any Gundam in comparison with Turn A, nobody even come close so we might as well start discussing who's the second best."
Gundam,3881wz,BoyGodz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:06:02 2015 UTC,"i didn't know that, i've admittedly never actually seen the Turn A Gundam series, and what about Turn X isn't A like a human reverse engineering of Turn X's systems which wouldn't that make the Turn X stronger? Anyway like I said for the most this can only be conjecture at best because the only place that i've seen Turn A fight was in BFT where a black color variant of Turn A lost to a bearguy  so... bearguy = strongest gundam ever? it will cute you to death!"
Gundam,3881wz,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:53:23 2015 UTC,"This question is asked constantly (not blaming you just pointing it out) and it bugs me. First of all any answer you get will be complete conjecture, here is why, there are 9 universes for gundam and you really can't say that Wing Zero could defeat Turn A or vice versa. That being said some people find it a fun topic to talk about just remember this is not something that fits into the gundam fandom due to the nature of the series, just like the topics comparing parts from UC to CE ect.."
Gundam,3881wz,CitrusChrome,0,Tue Jun 2 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"All of the potential answers are imbued with a great deal of spacemagic from their respective settings, so it's hard to say.   Qan[T]: Teleports, incredibly powerful shields, makes the pilot an obscenely powerful telepath. Turn-A: Regenerates itself with nanomachines, Moonlight Butterfly destroys all other technology. Unicorn: Appears to warp reality to the pilot's will.   Of these, arguably Turn-A is the superior system since it only requires any basically trained pilot for the Moonlight Butterfly to function; awakened Unicorn and Qan[T] require a perfect Newtype pilot or Innovator/Veda system respectively to function at their maximum."

Find an episode of any Gundam series that you think contain the least generic robot fighting element, preferably something that spend more than half of the episode with just people interacting and talking, and the Gundam showing face only at the end. Take the first episode of Unicorn for example, skipped ahead to the part leading up to Minerva falling out of the sky and Banagher catches her Laputa style, causally sit next to your target, start watching and grab their attention, it should get them intrigued while being as clueless as Banagher. Wait till the episode finish with the awesome Unicorn launching, tell them this is just what Gundam series is usually like and your target goes: ""Hey, that's pretty awesome, how do I watch the next episode?"", tell them they would have to watch 143 episode of anime and a movie first.

I DUN WANNA WATCH OLD ANIME, CUZ ITZ OOOOOOLD!""  If that's the case, start them off on 08th MS Team to get them into the genre, and then maybe see if they're willing to check out 0079 afterwards.  If they're still being retarded, then have them check out Gundam: The Origin bit by bit as it comes out if they're that retarded and refused to watch animes with Dated Animation; regardless of what their Quality is.

Gundam,386yat,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"Obligatory ""In defense of Unicorn as a starting series."" Pasta.  I've hooked a few people on Unicorn. They ask questions but you aren't obliged to answer. Just say, ""Shut up and watch."" And about 5 minutes later you get, ""Oh, I get it now."" Yes, fans get a lot more out of it. A LOT MORE. But that doesn't diminish it from being a good story. Its like, you don't need to read the Hobbit and the Silmarillion to follow The LOTR trilogy. It helps and you get a way better idea of whats going on, but its not required. It's designed to watch that way.  Let's also add a fantastic soundtrack, amazing animation, a great dub, a pretty generic (let's be honest) but well-done story.  You could do much worse than Unicorn. It's just we as Gundam fans get more out of it, as someone on here described it, it is, ""a giant love letter written to fans of the UC"".   I've never shown Unicorn to someone and had them dislike it."

Idk where you're getting the whole ""After 5 minutes later, you get ""Oh I get it now"", because that seems impossible; since without knowledge of 0079, Zeta, ZZ, and Char's Counterattack, how the hell are you supposed to know the details? The show doesn't explain them for you at all. It expect you to be prepared for it in advanced.  Yes, people still enjoy Unicorn, without question.

Gundam,3864by,nilius37,17,Tue Jun 2 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news here, but you picked one of The Worst Possible Choices to start off with Gundam, my friend.  If you go with Gundam Unicorn as your very first introduction into Gundam, you are going to be Absolutely Lost with what's going on in the story from Start to Finish without any prior knowledge to the Earlier Events of the Universal Century Timeline. Unicorn has way too much referential material to previous entries of the Universal Century Timeline, a lot of which newcomers will be completely unable to pick up on. It also has a lot of story-driven elements that have also been linked to Previous Events from past U.C. Timeline Gundam Animes that are essential to know about before entering Unicorn.  If I were you, I would highly recommend stopping right where you are with Gundam Unicorn for now, and instead starting at The Very Beginning of the Universal Century Timeline, and making your way through the U.C. one series at a time. Eventually, you will get back to Unicorn. But this time when you do go back to it, everything will make a lot more sense since you checked out all the previous ones before Unicorn.  Thankfully, I just so happen to have created a full-blown beginner's guide for new fans of Gundam on how to get started properly.  If you follow my guide's advice, then getting into Gundam will be just fine. You have my word.  Here's the guide itself. Read and Be Enlightened. =)"

Gundam,3864by,CaptainAmeijin,2,Tue Jun 2 07:47:16 2015 UTC,"Most Gundam stories are mostly self-contained, but Unicorn is built a little too much on the Universal Century which has come before.  If you're up for old animation (and I hope you are), I'd say you should go watch the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta, the back half of ZZ after reading a plot summary for the first half (or the whole thing if you can stomach the first bit's tone), and then Char's Counterattack.    That's about everything you need, background wise.  In a pinch you could skip ZZ altogether, since most of the important stuff is MSG, Zeta, and CCA.  Alternatively, you could do what my friend did and watch Unicorn, be totally lost but entranced by the animation and soundtrack (and bitch about the nonsense plot, claiming 00 is far better in that regard), go back and watch MSG, Zeta, ZZ, and CCA (initially at the urging of a friend), and then rewatch Unicorn and be amazed by how much sense it makes."
Gundam,3864by,Margulide,2,Tue Jun 2 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not too bad if you just keep going. I knew very little about UC beyond who Char and Amuro were along with a couple side characters and big plot events when I went into it. The beginning is a little rough but honestly it's not hard to pick up on as you go along. There are probably better starting points, but it's really good on its own. I have to agree that there could be better starting points, though.  You may want to start off with the original Mobile Suit Gundam compilation movies, and get to the Char's Counterattack movie. You won't really need to know much more to understand Unicorn's basic plot."
Gundam,3864by,CrashmanX,-6,Tue Jun 2 05:17:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say continue it. The nice thing about the Gundam Series/Franchise in general is that the stories are generally self-contained.

I dunno.  Kai Shiden's Report was really **** lame. I started translating that, but just got too bored with it.  I guess the only side-stories I really don't care for are the EFSF side of the IgLoo stories, if they count, simply because of the supernatural elements and lack of compelling... anything.

Gundam,382ibk,AleksVin,2,Tue Jun 2 05:39:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  Even despite the fact that Gundam 00P is the prequel to 00F, it's still pretty independent from it. But it does have flashbacks that talk about past events from it. Regardless though, you can still read 00F without checking out 00P just fine. Though me personally, if you can somehow find a translated 00P in the deep dark depths of the internet, then I'd check it out. It's a Photo Novel, not a manga. But it's still pretty good.  But even despite this, 00F shows the story of Celestial Being's ""Black Ops Unit"" called Fereshte, and it's quite interesting. The Main Character ""Fon Spark"" is also one of my favorite characters in all of Gundam. This dude is so much of a Shit-Ass Kid that not only was he in jail for quite a while before joining Fereshte, but he was kicked out of the KPSA in the past because even Ali Al-Saachez had enough of his bullshit he was causing for everyone else.  He's definitely a very enjoyable character, and his laugh is awesome. Especially since the one who voiced him is the one who voiced Accelerator from A Circle Magical Index. You can definitely hear the similarities."

Gundam,382ibk,Plamobot,0,Mon Jun 1 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"There's a problem with your choices here.  First of all, Gundam Sentinel isn't really a Side-Story. It covers what happens between Zeta and ZZ. And as for Crossbone, I assume you're talking about Skull Heart and Ghost. Because those are the only two Side Stories Crossbone has. The 1st Crossbone and Steel 7 are actually canon between F91 and Victory to bridge the gap that was left there after F91 fucked up with Complications from Bandai and Tomino.  Now as for your Most Hated Gundam Animes as well, here's the problem with those:  1st of all, Glory of Losers isn't a side-story at all. It's a Completely Series Continuity Reboot of Gundam Wing from the ground up. And I fail to see how you could possibly hate Glory of Losers, since it fixes a lot of problems Wing had to begin with.  And as for Frozen Teardrop, there's another problem with that one to that I hate to admit every single time, but it's true......it's not a side-story....it's actually canon. T_T"

Gundam,382ibk,Gundam336,2,Tue Jun 2 08:05:58 2015 UTC,"""Could be""?  Sure.  I don't think it's likely, though the likelihood has been on the rise for a few years now with the mecha making more videogame appearances and generally becoming more readily recognized outside of the manga audiences.    Sunrise seems pretty content to just leave late-UC dead.  Considering the mess the animation for that stretch is, that's actually pretty understandable.  F91 is an aborted, awkward mess of a story, which is actually a strong foundation for Crossbone.  If they try to build on what they've got now, it will probably fall a little flat.  More likely they'll either have the backstory given as heavy exposition at the beginning of Crossbone, or change the story to accommodate characters who aren't widely known, or very well liked, by people who only watch Gundam animation.    Heavily altering the story is almost a guarantee anyway.  Sunrise doesn't like to break from formula too much, and Crossbone is off from that formula in that it doesn't have a protagonist who pilots the Gundam from start to finish in the story.  The mentor character pilots the star Gundam, and the protagonist only pilots his in the late stages.  I don't think it would make for a bad story, but I also don't think Sunrise would really stick with that.    TL;DR:  I don't think it will be Crossbone (though I'd love to be wrong!), and if it is, it will almost certainly be changed drastically from the Crossbone we know and love.    I will say though that a series of OVA's following first the original Crossbone and then Steel 7 would make me so, so happy."

Gundam,3805co,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:10:13 2015 UTC,"USA Freedom Act:       The USA Freedom Act is a bill originally introduced in both houses of the U.S. Congress on October 29, 2013, and passed on June 2, 2015.  The title of the act is a ten-letter backronym (USA FREEDOM) that stands for ""__Uniting and __Strengthening __America by __Fulfilling __Rights and __Ending __Eavesdropping, __Dragnet-collection and __Online __M_onitoring Act.*""  The bill was re-introduced in the 114th Congress, receiving support for acting as ""a balanced approach""  while being questioned for amendments and extending the Patriot Act through the end of 2019.  Supporters of the bill say the most the House Intelligence Committee and House leadership  would allow is ending bulk collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act  until Section 702 of FISA comes up for review at the end of 2017. Critics assert that mass surveillance of the content of Americans' communication will continue under Section 702 of FISA   and Executive Order 12333   due to the ""unstoppable surveillance-industrial complex""  despite the fact that a bipartisan majority of the House had previously voted to close backdoor mass surveillance.      Chairman Goodlatte. The chair thanks the gentleman, and recognizes himself. The legislation before us today was carefully and painstakingly negotiated not just amongst members of this committee, but with our colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community.     Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I oppose this amendment because it is not part of the delicate compromise that Chairman Goodlatte, Representatives Sensenbrenner, Nadler, and myself reached with the House Intelligence Committee and House leadership. After months of negotiation, we agreed on legislation that we believe can pass the House, pass the Senate, and become law.     Ms. Lofgren. This is an issue where a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans voted on the floor to approve this very same thing.     Ms. Lofgren. This amendment is identical to the Massie Lofgren amendment in last year's DoD appropriations bill, which passed the House 293 to 123, but it was ultimately stripped out. 21 members of this committee actually voted for that amendment when it was on the floor. Clearly a vast majority of Congress supports closing the backdoor.

Gundam,382lks,Javypineda2,5,Mon Jun 1 12:07:10 2015 UTC,"This is all just from memory, so I might be wrong in a few details:  -During the 00 Gundam's early development, they created the 00 Seven Swords system as a concept based from Exia's Seven Swords System. However, the development of the 7S was pushed to the backburner to prioritize development of the 0 Raiser in order to stabilize the Trans AM system of the 00.   So in theory, the 00 can still go Trans-Am in the 7S System, but it would be pointless since the Twin Drives won't be synchronized to have a stable working time for the Trans AM System. It would just overload and fail like that one time in season 2 where the 00 Gundam tried to use Trans AM before the 0 Raiser was introduced.  -Fast forward after the events of season 2, the 00 Seven Sword system has resumed development, now with the addition of another weapon, the GN Sword II Blaster, giving birth to the 00 Gundam Seven Sword/G. However, since both GN Drives of the 00 Raiser were destroyed after season 2, developers of the 7 S/G had to give the Gundam either the combination of a GN Drive + A large GN Condenser or 2 Large GN Condensers as compensation. But they discovered that the Gundam is unable to use Trans-Am with the Gn Drive + Condenser System. The 2 Condenser setup on the other hand, grants the Trans AM System, but only for 0.03 seconds."

A: No.    Trans-AM will work just fine, but the problem is that without either the 0 Raiser or XN Raiser present, the Twin-Drive System can only have a max of 82% Synchronization Rate between the two GN Drives.  So Trans-AM System with 00 Seven Swords/G will be a risky move to do, but is totally possible to pull off."

However, they and their supporting fleet were all destroyed by ZAFT's Neutron Stampeder. Soon afterwards, Windams equipped with the Jet Striker were deployed to oppose ZAFT's ""Operation Spear of Twilight"", in which large numbers of mobile suits were dropped to Earth to reinforce their Carpentaria and Gibraltar bases. Windams were also employed in a failed attempt to destroy ZAFT's battleship Minerva as it left Orb territorial waters, and in most major Earth Alliance operations on the planet thereafter.

During the battle, she accidentally fires a missile at the Azieru's cockpit, killing Quess and destroying the Alpha Azieru. Because of this, Hathaway Noa, who was in love with Quess and also trying to persuade her to defect, used the beam rifle of his RGM-89 Jegan to destroy the Re-GZ, killing Chan.

Now you might ask:  ""Ok then, if that's the case, then how about the SEED & Destiny Special Edition Movie Trilogy Versions? Would those work?""  Unforatunely, no. The Special Editions of SEED & Destiny, I shit you not, are even worse than the Anime Versions of them. Yet again, the Pacing is even more fucked up with the Special Editions. A lot of important events are skipped entirely. And very specific details were edited out for no apparent reason that make a huge different in telling as to wtf happened.

Gundam,37w8x7,WackyModder84,1 point,Sat May 30 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"That would be the ZERO System. Here's some more specific details about it so you know exactly how to use it properly in-game:   The ZERO System is the core feature of Wing Gundam Proto Zero, which operated by bombarding the pilot's mind with an overload of every possible outcome of a combat situation, allowing them to then choose the actions that would lead to certain victory.  Within the context of the game, once the ammo gauge reaches 100, the ZERO system can be initiated by charging and releasing CSb (2s charge time), which will stop Proto Zero in place and surround him with an animation resembling its 3D display (seen at the beginning of the second opening for the anime series). It should be noted that if used in Neo Bird Mode it will not vernier stop you, but using the armament in Bird Mode is considered an enormous waste.  Once the system is activated, for 3.5s all enemy projectile tracking will be cut while you are moving - it does not cut tracking while you are firing a weapon or doing a melee attack (so no invincible Rolling Buster Rifles or 8B approaches). This is basically the same thing as F91's MEPE armament.  One of the core duties of a 3000 cost suit being to force red lock focus on to itself, this is a truly indispensable tool for Zero, being useful both when attacking or when retreating. It's so good actually that it's not uncommon at all to come across players who will simply hang back from a fight, poking with BR/MA-Sub while charging CS-A until ZERO System becomes available, activate, boost in to attack, and then fall back and repeat this process (which has led to the armament being restricted to once/life in the followup game, Maxi Boost).  The trade-off for this awesome ability though is that if you are hit while it is active you will take 1.5x damage, and which will immediately end the effect, setting the gauge to 0 ammo regardless of how much you had left when hit. Any hit-stun period will cancel the system - stagger, stun, Down, whatever. However, there are actually a few armaments in the game that won't hit-stun you, but will still do the 1.5x damage, which can then result in you actually taking 1.5x damage from two attacks back-to-back, and so you must be wary of these."

Gundam late, only seeing MSG, 8th MS and Chars Counterattack on Toonami, so I'm trying to catch up from Zeta through Stardust Memory. But one of my issues with the U.C. is I never liked the main pilots (Shiro being the exception).  So after learning how to tolerate Amuro and having to put up with Kamile's bullshit, it is so refreshing to see a Gundam pilot who is such a bro like Judau. He's funny, awesome and with barely any angst. I actually liked the Gundam Team, it reminded me of the Blitz team from Zoids or other teams from Super Robot shows.  And dat theme song Corny as hell but it sticks with you."

Gundam,37p74e,Terminimal,21,Fri May 29 08:45:15 2015 UTC,"Flit Asuno has to be one of the most underrated Gundam protagonist; I like his development from an idealistic saviour to a hardened veteran and then to a vengeful, genocidal and traumatised yet justifiable angry old geezer."
Gundam,37p74e,pointblanker,7,Fri May 29 10:55:06 2015 UTC,"It also just gets annoying how incredibly similar many of Gundam protagonists are.   Amuro/Kamille/Kira/Banager while obviously different characters many are cut from the same mold. Engineering student, your family makes Gundams, by luck you just happen to be there at the moment to pilot the Gundam, you don't wanna fight but do it to protect someone/something, cry a lot.  Every step of the way Flit is confident, driven, and most of all he wants to just kill everyone."
Gundam,37p74e,fox112,1 point,Fri May 29 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"This so much. The whiny male protagonist is way too prevalent in Gundam shows. Flit is a good exception and so are Heero and Setsuna to a lesser extant, but they also fit into other annoying tropes as well"
Gundam,37p74e,irishking44,6,Sun May 31 21:37:04 2015 UTC,Flit was a great protagonist and I agree very underrated but I also feel that way about Age as a whole.
Gundam,37p74e,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Fri May 29 15:07:08 2015 UTC,"His character changed too much from Arc 1 to 2. In one he's an idealistic one man but in 2 he's a war hardened veteran bordering on racist toward Mars.   Yes, the death of his friend in Arc 1 is a powerful situation but that didn't happen at the end of Arc 1, so we never see this rage develop. In the end we get a very cold character who is a detatched father to his son for no other reason than to make this angst between the son and father. It was forced and annoying since Flit changed so much without any real motivation other than he joined the military.  Arc 3 he plays the crazy old grandpa well, and he relaxes a bit, but I felt his attitude would have worked better in two since its a natural evolution from 1 to 3 and then finally to 2 where he's seen so much death and destruction he'd cold hearted."
Gundam,37p74e,UCMCoyote,2,Fri May 29 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"Except in 2, he's what, the Supreme Commander of the Earth forces or something? It's partially that he's been traumatized and probably compartmentalizing most of his emotions, but also that he's super fucking busy. He just doesn't have the time to coordinate fleets and missions and have family time. He's entirely dedicated at this point to fighting back against the Vegans.  And we definitely saw the rage in Part 1, remember Yurin and Decile?  In 3, like you said, he relaxes a bit because he got old, and old people everywhere, especially in Gundam, think they can do whatever the hell they want and get away with it. I was actually surprised they let Grandpa Flit basically re-assume his Supreme Commander role (or was he just playing Algreus' advisor? been a while)."
Gundam,37p74e,ArgentLye,1 point,Fri May 29 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"For me his attitude in two just didn't have enough of a transition to be believable.  It felt like he was being the busy super gundam maker Dad and was just cold for the sake of cold.   Flit was never that cold in Arc 1 or 3, but in two he's an icy bitch that makes his son really feel bad needlessly. Like when he found out his son wasn't an X Rounder, that's not how the warm hearted Flit would have acted in Act 1, it was cold for the sake of having Flit's son have something to overcome. It just felt forced."
Gundam,37p74e,UCMCoyote,19,Fri May 29 20:26:51 2015 UTC,The best shot in AGE bar none.
Gundam,37p74e,ExpiredSushi,8,Fri May 29 10:20:39 2015 UTC,"I love AGE, but the last season kind of dropped in quality to me, but those final episodes I was so invested that I teared up as well. If you ever get the chance watch the movie they made that's all about Asemu and Zeheart relationship with new footage and has a way better final fight for them. It made me tear up so hard because that story was the highlight for me in the series and that movie feels like the better ending to that particular arc."
Gundam,37p74e,Spider-Man2099,2,Fri May 29 10:26:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that's why I liked AGE.   The first two arcs are quite good and have a very comfortable Gundam feeling to them.  I was really interested in finding out who the Vagans were, are they aliens, are they humans, are these machines being piloted or are they AI? By the time arc 3 gets cheesy and boring, I was already over half way done with the series. Gotta finish."
Gundam,37p74e,fox112,0,Fri May 29 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, it looks like, even though everyone in this thread has the same conclusion about these final episodes, I have a completely different view on what came before.  I thought First Generation was too bland and goofy, Second Generation was better but never hit its mark, and Third Generation brought the series to ""true Gundam status."" Particularly with First Generation, I'd wished they thought of something besides the Euba-Zalam groups to fill in what came between the beginning and final battle. When we first met those groups, it reminded me of the Moon-Moon colony, and I expected the Diva to part ways with them for good in one or two episodes...  I could appreciate that the simpler, more childlike feel of First Generation reflects the Earth Sphere's ignorance of the UE's humanity, and Flit's black-and-white view on them. It was like what I imagine pre-Gundam 70s mecha to be. But it wasn't much fun for me to watch."
Gundam,37p74e,Arisarha,2,Fri May 29 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"For what it is worth, I'm pretty much in agreement. I mean, while I enjoyed First Gen more than Second Gen (Asemu is just a terribly uninteresting character to me.), but without a doubt, the Third Gen was the most interesting and definitely Gundam Tier quality.  Sadly, you will see the majority vote for Second Gen > First Gen > Third Gen basically... But eh, you'll see similar trends with UC obsession and SEED/Destiny hate."
Gundam,37p74e,Arisarha,2,Sun May 31 06:12:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. I've never seen too many discussions about AGE, so I had no idea what the consensus was. I'm guessing Kio is largely to blame? It's hard for me to admit I didn't mind Kio's pacifism after bashing Kira for it, but I liked Kio, and his interactions with his girlfriend, Wootbit, the spy, Girard Spriggan... but especially his time in the Mars Sphere. I also liked Üso from Victory, and Kio seemed really similar.  The characters of Third Generation had a complexity I didn't find in First. I think that's very intentional, but it means I don't really appreciate First except while considering its context within the larger plot.  Would you also know how the games are related to the show's content? Like, what was forced into the show because it was meant to be a game? The AGE Device seemed very game-y, like a Pokédex or Yokai Watch, and the AGE Builder seemed like a game mechanic where you can get different weapons depending on how you fight and experience points, but that's all I can think of."
Gundam,37p74e,NageQsad,2,Sun May 31 07:33:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, I feel like the AGE Device and concept was underutilized for the most part... it really did feel like it would have fit better in a game and that Gundam AGE would have faired better as a series of games (with each generation being fully fledged out in different titles) as opposed to the slapped-together mess we ultimately ended up. Which I did enjoy entirely, but I won't lie that things were rushed and not fleshed properly. Regardless, I REALLY like the idea of AGE being a game where the AGE Builder is central to the game mechanics and your overall methods of playing would create paths of development. Maybe even change the direction of the conflict between the Earth Sphere and Vagan.  That said, I'll just go ahead and say that I enjoyed Kio the most and am very much a fan of the pacifistic Main Characters like Kio and Kira. Those two being two of the top three favorite protagonists in the Gundam Multiverse for me. (Last of the trifecta being Setsuna, which I know is drastically different, but eh. I'm not a one-trick pony)  In finality though, two things come to mind. One that I would actually like to see more discussion about AGE (and not just the one-sided OMGERD hate for Gen 3), particularly some focus on how it probably would have been better set as a game series. (I'd also like to note I know very little about the games actually released for AGE. Should I check these out?)  Part two of my closing is that I feel like not too many people realize Kio was actually very interesting as a character. He took the pacifist archetype we got with Kira but it was played better... and this is coming from someone who is very pro-Kira. Kio is just all that more... human? While Gen 3 was rushed and we didn't get the full deal if you ask me, Kio was just... I dunno. Fresh and interesting and I would have liked to see his character explored a little more. I dunno. Starting to ramble, but yeah, that's my more-than-two-cents on the matter."
Gundam,37p74e,Mayomori,1 point,Sun May 31 08:23:30 2015 UTC,"I've got no idea what the games are actually composed of. I just know that Level-5 is a video game developer, and after reading a few comments here, I assumed that the show was written with the games in mind, and it would of been a better show if they just made a story instead of a template for a game."
Gundam,37p74e,NageQsad,9,Sun May 31 08:32:14 2015 UTC,"AGE to me is not a bad Gundam series at all. A lot of people hate Flit and only like Asemu because Flit turned into ""Genocide grandpa"". But Flit however, is a very realistic character. Imagine this, his mother is killed by Vagans, his son is believed to be killed by Vagans, the love of his life is killed by Vagans, his close friend is killed by Vagans, the person he respect the most is kill by Vagans then more and more people are killed by Vagans. We all know that his actions are way too extreme and unaceptable just because of vengeance. But if you were Flit and the Vagans are someone or something else that did all that, will you forgive them and just be who you were? NO. The Vagans are just soldiers and they have children and kids and their life is miserable and bla bla bla are all bullshit. That does not justify the fact that they killed a human being just because of orders or justice and take what is their. Killing is bad, and kill an innocent human is fucking bad. If i was Flit and my mother is killed by Vagans, i swear to god i will not only kill their entire race but will also torture them until they can't even beg for death before killing them. Think about it for a while, i think most of you will have the same thought as mine too. That is why i like Flit the most, even more than Asemu."
Gundam,37p74e,Mayomori,3,Fri May 29 09:31:14 2015 UTC,"Killing is bad, and kill an innocent human is fucking bad   Then   I swear to god i will not only kill their entire race but will also torture them until they can't even beg for death before killing them   Seems hypocritical eh"

Gundam,37p74e,RoyalGuard128,1 point,Sat May 30 01:10:08 2015 UTC,"If you did so, it would only make the cycle continues. The Vagan only becomes like this is because they was forgotten and  left to die. By your logic,  since their innocent brethren was killed, they are now justify to go on a vengeance spree.   Im not defending Vagan actions hell most of them could get kill by Sid during the finale and I could still not giving a shit. Why? Because we have no reasons to care a about some random no-name. But when you said you willing to become the 2nd genocidal maniac for that reasons is absurd."
Gundam,37p74e,NageQsad,2,Sat May 30 10:29:25 2015 UTC,honestly if age3 hadn't gone all pacifistic with kio and had the oh wait theres more there's another boss to beat at the end it wouldve been received a lot better.
Gundam,37p74e,ghostFOUR7,2,Sat May 30 02:33:54 2015 UTC,"Flit's really the only character that had a significant amount of character development, but it's kinda cheating when you have about 50 episodes to do so.   But what I really don't like is how by the end he just throws away 50 years of hatred and the most defining aspect of his character... because of Kio's vision. It kinda makes Kio hypocritical (he's always preaching the ""let's understand each other"" speech yet he refuses to understand his own grandpa's viewpoint), and it's kinda hard to believe Flit actually would do so after all he's already done; I'd say the writers just needed that to happen to have a happy ending."
Gundam,37p74e,JQuilty,2,Fri May 29 09:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i mean if Kio's mother is killed right in front of him what would he do then? Definitely not saying "" Hey apologize you illiterate Vagan fuck."""
Gundam,37p74e,elsinestres,3,Fri May 29 09:51:21 2015 UTC,Hearing something like this makes me excited to watch AGE.  0079's last 3 episodes really raised the bar for me. It went from being very good to absolutely amazing.
Gundam,37p74e,godblow,2,Fri May 29 09:39:27 2015 UTC,"While AGE may have been meh as a whole, Flit Asuno is one of the best written characters in any Gundam series. It a great idea to have him become a genocidal bastard, but sadly AGE suffered from not restructuring things that would work in a video game but not in a TV series, and by moving Asemu and Kio into co-protaganists instead of making them additional characters."
Gundam,37p74e,Diamo1,1 point,Fri May 29 17:47:58 2015 UTC,"I consider Flit to be one of the best characters in any Gundam series, but I liked that the second part focused on Asemu. The contrast between Asemu and Flit was good. The main problem of Age was Kio."
Gundam,37p74e,akiyuki89,2,Sat May 30 08:07:45 2015 UTC,"There were tears. None of them spilled out over my eyelids, but they were there.  Which was weird, because I kept noting the times I should've had an emotional reaction and didn't, particularly with Woolf. And with this scene, I'd always thought we didn't see enough of Flit and Yurin to feel his loss and her death. (Although, I had a similar reaction to Lalah in First.) I won't rate this scene as high as ones from the UC works––this might've been cheap, and might've been due just to this song––but I never got as teary-eyed as I did here.  First you had Seric Abis in Episode 47. Then the farewell to the Diva, Zeheart's realization that he sacrificed Fram and the others for nothing, sinking deeper beneath the point of no return, and finally acknowledging his cherished memories of Tordia before dying in Episode 48.  Obviously AGE has a child-friendly feel, and yet the first main character we meet winds up a grizzled old commander, straight out of Soldiers of Sorrow. And genocidal! That's gotta count for something."
Gundam,37p74e,WackyModder84,1 point,Fri May 29 09:20:59 2015 UTC,"For what it was (a Banda cashgrab video game-truned-anime series whose sole purpose was to sell gunpla and keep the 00 Sunrise studio busy), it was a decent effort. Flit was a well-written character, but the rest of the plot was just meh; A lot of wasted opportunities and no real end game plan."
Gundam,37pxk3,blazeblue,2,Fri May 29 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"In Japan?  Out of Japan you can search for Gundam 4koma ガンダム ４コマ, or Gundam comic anthology ガンダム コミックアンソロジー for these kinda things. Either rakuten suruga-ya or Yahoo Auctions Japan.  I think Suruga-ya ships out of Japan but nobody on YAJ does, you would need a proxy (someone buys for you and then ships out of Japan; companies like jauce and from-japan do that).  Unfortunately these are often one-shots or they have like 2-3 volumes, so it's super expensive to ship out of Japan - much more so than, for example, shipping 40 manga at once.  If you're intending to go to Japan in the year or two years and you can wait, then you will find these things at Book Off used shops for ridiculously cheap like 100-200 yen.  -edit- yeah that was for Gundam in general or any series really, not just for SD Gundam BB Senshi.

Gundam,37ooga,jackattack502,3,Fri May 29 04:54:54 2015 UTC,"I had watched shows in both sub and dub and didn't really care either way until  1: I watched the Evangelion dub. I imagine this exact anime is what gave the bad reputation, it's fucking awful (coming from a guy who has enjoyed dozens of dubs)  2: I watched the Steins:gate sub. The show is very dependant on Japanese culture and I feel like English and Japanese do not flow the same, or have the same spirit to them. A dub would not do these characters justice."
Gundam,37ooga,fox112,1 point,Fri May 29 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"Evangelion was deeeeefinitely not the anime that gave dubs a bad reputation.  Prior to anime finding its market in the US, the few shows that did make their way over here often times had some really atrocious work in dubbing, with bad monotone super-rushed-keep-talking-run-on-sentences-to-fill-in-the-whole-time-the-character's-mouth-is-moving-because-I've-run-out-of-meaningful-words-to-say segments.

It is almost utterly devoid of anime tropes.  When somebody feels like they know what something is about before watching it, the use of tropes will only cement their opinions against it.  This is why Unicorn is a bad choice for a first Gundam series.  Regardless of what you think of it's qualities overall, it's still making use of the genre's heaviest cliches in a big way.    3).  It's a damn good, mature story that showcases the best elements of Gundam."

It was like seeing a ghost. Strike Gundam: I always thought it was really epic when the Strike stood up for the first time back when I was a kid. It was a really great scene. Freedom: The way it just swoops down and saves the Archangel, spreading its wings for the first time has always been a majestic sight. Strike Freedom: Our lord and saviour is back, and is ready to fuck shit up. I also liked how the pilots reacted when they saw it, they're all like: ""It can't be! The Freedom was destroyed! Why is it back?!"" 00 Gundam: Loved how everyone was just astonished that there's a mobile suit with TWO GN Drives. 00 Raiser: Loved the english dub of the Haro going: ""Roger that! Roger that! 0 Raiser Docking Mode!"" And then after the gattai sequence, it just got even more epic. Raphael: When everything seems to be over, this badass comes and wipes the ELS away. Seravee II: Tiera yelling out ""Seravee!"" was really my favorite moment in the movie. Unicorn: ""Get the hell...out of my way!"" Those words were the start of Banagher's journey. Banshee: Skydiving into the battlefield, striking fear into Riddhe and Banagher as the Banshee enters Destroy Mode was really dramatic.

Gundam,37i9jk,Orgell_Evaan,2,Thu May 28 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"Where in the world did you get an animated version of the novel?  Also, I agree with the other poster. Feels a tad too Eva-ish. Eva's were always crazy.  Unicorn's NT-D...it's freakyness, for me anyway, came from how fucking RATIONAL it seemed...like it was taking the enemy apart bit by bit because it knew EXACTLY how to do it with the perfect application of force."
Gundam,37i9jk,KaziArmada,3,Thu May 28 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"Back before the OVA was announced, they animated a short trailer to advertise the book. I can't find a good quality version of the trailer, but I found these webms.    http://a.pomf.se/bavoxt.webm    http://a.pomf.se/xesexn.webm    And speaking for myself, I like the idea that the Unicorn was more ""emotional?"" At least in the beginning, it would trigger by Banagher's fear or rage. The way the OVA handles it has the more calm launch fits the context better.    I feel like the Novel launch fits better in the sense that Banagher is still recovering from seeing his father killed, and he loses control and thought, much like the end of episode 3. It would still fight with cold efficiency, but it carries a predator-like quality.    You see the Unicorn trying to break free cause it knows there's something for it to attack. And the brief sight of the psychoframe shows that there is something hidden within it."
Gundam,37i9jk,ExpiredSushi,2,Thu May 28 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"I quite like that interpretation of it. That could of been interesting, redoing Episode 1/Opening of 2 to have that more primal quality to the Unicorn.   Still think the OVA ending was better then the novel by miles, though."

Gundam,37i9jk,gibbypoo,3,Thu May 28 13:32:20 2015 UTC,Yeah Seed is basically a reimagining of the original series. It's definitely not the best Gundam series BUT it gets REALLY good once they get to Orb. The last 10 episodes are a roller coast ride of good animation and fun battles.
Gundam,37i9jk,simsoy,1 point,Thu May 28 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"Damnit and I thought this was one of the best. Any recommendations?  I've seen MSG, 08th, Char's Counter Attack, G and Wing and some of 00"
Gundam,37i9jk,gibbypoo,3,Thu May 28 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"Usually Seed and its sequel Destiny are considered to be some of the worst of the metaseries but I would argue that the last 25 episodes of Seed are pretty damned good, with the last arc in the show being the best finale in Gundam, and Destiny has by far the most intense and fun opening 13 episodes and remains very good until the plot falls off towards the end. Both series are worth watching, believe me they are. The only Gundam I would recommend never watching is AGE or the live action movie. If you want there are plenty of episodes you can skip in Seed and I could probably draw up a list, but otherwise it's not THAT bad.  On the other hand, the Universal Century era is considered the golden age of Gundam, if you need to start someplace else."
Gundam,37i9jk,simsoy,3,Thu May 28 23:15:51 2015 UTC,"Seed one of the worst in the meta series? Seriously? The majority of the complaints, are about, seed-destiny and not Seed.

Gundam,37i9jk,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Fri May 29 11:52:28 2015 UTC,"Seed one of the worst in the meta series? Seriously?    I'd certainly rank it lower-tier. A great deal of it is simply lifted from the original series, and many of the elements that are original play out like a badly written teenage soap opera. It's also got a ton of repetitive stock animation, Kira barely has a personality, a lot of the mechanical design is pretty lazy (IE, compare the GINN to Wing's Leo or 00's FLAG/Tieren) and a lot of it reeks of being used as a platform to promote the music.   There's good things about it. Rau is an awesome character. Badgeriel is an awesome character. The Strike, Buster, Blitz, Duel, and Justice are awesome, and it does get better around the 35 episode point, but at that point we're over halfway through the show."

Mobile Suit Gundam The 08th Mobile Suit Team Gundam 0080: War In The Pocket Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam Char's Counterattack Gundam Unicorn Mobile Suit Victory Gundam Gundam F91   Basically, you can just watch down that list. 0080, 0083, and Unicorn are OVAs like the 08th MS Team, and Char's Counterattack and F91 are movies.

Gundam,37jx3a,Mirarii,21,Thu May 28 04:07:17 2015 UTC,"Here are few reasons   Lack of moe A very human story that transcends all people with different backgrounds An anime that is doesn't alienate Non-Japanese viewers; you don't need to learn Japanese stuff or become a weeaboo No stereotypical high-school bishonen cliche War is a interesting theme to tell a story and it enables characters to flesh out in 3 dimensions It doesn't goes too long and lacks filler episodes. Alternate universe actually encourages more design creativity and as well as diversifying merchandising. It also keeps Gundam very strong for over 30 years  Most importantly, giant robots that looks and feels practical."
Gundam,37jx3a,pointblanker,4,Thu May 28 04:20:56 2015 UTC,"Lack of moe   It does feature it's fair share of attractive women, any style and form, and.... age. Some are widely considered Moe.   No stereotypical high-school bishonen cliche   I take you haven't watched Wing, Seed or 00. Or their crazed fan girls and their thin little booklets.   It doesn't goes too long and lacks filler episodes.   Almost all Gundam series has fillers, whether it's Amuro looking for salt, Sunday afternoon cartoon featuring Judau and his friends, Uso gets one of his team killed, Domon fights yet another fighter from Neo Narnia, or Heero sits in front of a screen in a darkroom before he said fuck it and slaughter a base in his super Leo. On average Gundam series will probably be 15-20% shorter if you cut out the episodes that doesn't really contribute to the overall plot except some unimportant guy dies."
Gundam,37jx3a,BoyGodz,4,Thu May 28 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"To clarify my statements, I know there is some noticeable anime cliches but Gundam manages to stand on its own without relying too much on anime tropes.   It is a series that knows how to have a powerful start and knows how to properly end a series, for the most of the time that is.  I got to admit, I don't like mainstream anime such as One Piece, Bleach, Naruto etc because it has it has way too many episodes and I can't have the dedication needed to invest the series. Also I don't know where to start from; episode 1 or the first episode of an important arc."

Gundam,37jx3a,strikeraiser,0,Fri May 29 03:53:41 2015 UTC,"I know I shouldn't generalize but that's kind of what I did. It's just always been off putting seeing something in the general style of ""Here is either: a male character with gravity defying hair or a female with inhumanly massive breasts. This character has some sort of inhuman ability to solve every problem ever thrown at them and may or may not be under the effect of some sort of hamartia. Now sit back for a story about this character which was very similar to the last story you heard about them and with plot points and mechanics that have been overdone to hell in this series and others."""
Gundam,37jx3a,Setsuna-F-Seiei,7,Thu May 28 14:31:51 2015 UTC,"That's my point though. They aren't all like that. What you just described is literally just one sub-category of anime, which is shonen. Shonen is a genre for teens and young adults of the male variety. The majority of male teens and young adults are pulled in by cool character designs (spikey hair is generally considered cool), sex appeal (large breast), and epic action scenes (which can be done best when characters have super-human abaility), so those things are the main focus of your typical shonen anime. But even within that sub-category, there are outliers that don't pander to the same cliches all the time.   Gundam is still technically shonen, but majority of the series focuses more on world building and character development.  It still has a lot of cool action scenes and it's fair share of sex appeal, but those generally just aren't the main focus."

Gundam,37j7w5,MisterPuck,1 point,Sat May 30 07:14:11 2015 UTC,"Considering the technology and looking a simple weight as a way to measure similar amounts of material, an M1 Abrams weighs in at just about 60 short tons. The RX-78 weighs in at about 60 tons (not sure if metric or short, but judging from the height, my guess would be metric) which puts it at 66.14 short tons.  It is important to note that later versions of the Abrams weighs in around 68 short tons, but as someone else noted there are considerably more complex mechanical parts involved with much higher demands.  But that's only a comparable unit cost given the idea that if we get to the point where we would actually build a mech similar to a gundam, the technology would be robust enough to actually be employed for space exploration/construction/combat and at a comparable price.  But actual prototyping and development?   The original project (MBT-70) cost the West germans and the Americans 1.94 billion (adjusted for inflation) before it was cancelled and I don't even know how much it cost to get from the xm815 prototype to the first production M1 Abrams."

That Gunpla women thing might count I suppose, but of the three suits I can remember from that episode, one was built by Nielsen Nils-san, one was the Nobel Gundam palette swap built by its pilot, and one was China's Bearguy.  Nielsen's world level.  Allenby Beardsley/Sailor Jupiter clearly isn't going to settle for a crappy Gunpla.  China's artsy, learned from Sei, and is trying to impress him.

In real life, 99% of the time you're only going to be making it look nice for yourself, so if you have lower to average standards or if you're going to be displaying it on a shelf you'll never be close up to perfect sanding isn't an issue.   In GBF gunpla building is a gigantic cultural thing. Add the fact that making your gunpla look good actually has a tangible effect on it's performance in battle, and it makes sense that people would spend magnitudes more time on developing the ""fundamentals""  of gunpla building and carrying them out properly."

Gundam,37h0cj,wavyhairedsamurai,2,Thu May 28 07:33:22 2015 UTC,Kamille definitely had the best character development among the 3 imo.
Gundam,37h0cj,saekheart,6,Thu May 28 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of it that way before, but it's a great way to view the ending of Zeta.  In that light, it's actually a happy ending -- or at least the happiest one that can be provided in times of war."

Gundam,37h0cj,ShinnAssuka,7,Thu May 28 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"My theory on Zeta is that Kamille starts losing it once he's in close proximity to the colony as it's getting gassed.  He's doing fine until then, but after then he's unhinged, so I assume that feeling the deaths of all those people nearly simultaneously had a destructive effect."
Gundam,37h0cj,Turambar87,1 point,Wed May 27 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"That would explain why an episode or two later he takes Sarah with him into battle without either completely trussing her up like a pig or stopping by the argama on his way back to drop her off as a POW. He had her arms and legs tied, but not in a way that could keep her from interfering with his piloting, and he almost died because of that."
Gundam,37h0cj,Owyn_Merrilin,7,Thu May 28 23:42:54 2015 UTC,Doing stupid things in the heat of the moment is sort of Kamille's whole gig.

Dynames and Kyrios especially.  The Gundam MKII was cooler than the Zeta.  The X-3 was definitely my favorite of the ones Tobia piloted, though I haven't gotten my hands on Ghost so that one might trump it.  I liked the V more than the V2.  The Burning Gundam was better than the Try Burning.  The Gundam X Maoh was superior to the Crossbone Maoh  Finally, the Fenice was a bajillion times cooler than the Fenice Rinascita."
Gundam,37izwx,Char_X_3,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Strike to the Freedom comes to mind. I really like the concept of the various backpacks, with the character equipping whatever one is best suited for the situation. Kinda like Amuro deciding to go out with the bazooka or gundam hammer instead of the rifle. You had the Aile for a balanced loadout offset with greater manuverability, the launcher for telling people to fuck off at long range, and the sword for looking badass while being completely impractical. It was a good mix between the three of them.  Then we get to the Freedom.  I wouldn't have so much of a problem with this machine if it wasn't the upgrade to the Strike. Hell, it's going to be my first MG and is supposed to arrive tomorrow. But the problem is, it feels disconnected from the previous design. It doesn't feel like an evolution of the Strike, it feels like an unrelated MS and it's not going to take advantage of all the skills Kira displayed with the Strike.  Think of it like this, imagine playing SRW and putting a whole bunch of points into Kira's melee stat because you liked using the Sword Strike. Now imagine how you would feel getting the Freedom, a decidedly ranged-based suit.  The Destiny started out as a concept design for Kira's next MS after the Strike, featuring the combined loadout of all three packs. I love this machine despite it's flaws and feel it would have been a far better upgrade for Kira in SEED. That suit encapsulates every skill Kira had used thus far, with none of it going to waste."
Gundam,37izwx,Diamo1,4,Thu May 28 01:01:14 2015 UTC,"Part of that is because the Freedom isn't a direct successor to the Strike in the show; they didn't give him Freedom to replace the Strike, he lost the strike and then stole the Freedom. Hell, they weren't even made by the same people.  Same goes for the Justice and Athrun. Most of the time, the characters are given their suit's successor, but not in SEED.   I like how Durandal resurected the concept behind Strike with the Impulse and Destiny though."

And honestly, at this point it's more worth it to just get PPSSPP for your PC and emulate NEXT Plus; provided you don't have a copy of EXVS Full Boost by now for PS3. It'll not only save you money on buying NEXT Plus, but also hold you over until you can get Full Boost.  As long as your PC has at least a Dual Core Processor, 2GBs of RAM, and either and AMD/NVIDIA Graphics Card OR an Intel HD 4000 or Higher, then you can run PPSSPP and emulate PSP Games on your PC, and play them even better than they were on the PSP itself.  But if you plan on getting Full Boost, then be advised: YOU MUST buy it Brand New. You cannot buy it Used if you wish to play Online Multiplayer. Why? Because Bandai Namco thought it was a good idea to mimic EA Games and implement Online Passes into the game. That's why. It's retarded, but unfortunately it is what it is. =\"
Gundam,37h08n,WackyModder84,-1,Thu May 28 00:13:43 2015 UTC,PPSSPP is quite buggy compared to an actual PSP.

Gundam,37h08n,Vatepgo1,2,Thu May 28 18:51:34 2015 UTC,Phone's aren't the same as PC. Especially since one is running Android OS and the other is running Windows.   Also your phone is way weaker than most home PCs.
Gundam,37h08n,CrashmanX,-4,Thu May 28 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"There are phones that are more powerful than a pc, like the new nvidia tablet or phones with Intel Atom processor. Arguably the snapdragon 801 is comparable to an intel I3 processor."

Gundam,37h08n,CrashmanX,-2,Fri May 29 15:22:38 2015 UTC,"You do realise that a snapdragon 801 is better than an I3 chip or even a pentium chip which aren't even from 2001, along with an adreno 330 is better than a budget graphics card.   Even better yet the new Nvidia Shield Tablet which is better than a PS Vita which have you access to Nvidia Zone which have steam games like Counter Strike, Borderlands, Half life 2, Portal 2 and even more. Same with Intel Atom processor which have the same processing power of the Nvidia Shield."
Gundam,37h08n,Vatepgo1,1 point,Fri May 29 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you had an argument until:    which is better than a PS Vita which have you access to Nvidia Zone which have steam games like Counter Strike, Borderlands, Half life 2, Portal 2 and even more.   See, that's opinion based, not fact based on ""Better"".  Now on to    You do realise that a snapdragon 801 is better than an I3 chip or even a pentium chip which aren't even from 2001, along with an adreno 330 is better than a budget graphics card.   Lower resolution = Superior processing power. It doesn't have to render nearly as much, which means it can render more faster. If I drop my resolution to 1024x768, I'll get MUCH better performance too. Regardless, most phones on the market are weaker than a semi-decent PC."

If the models are HGs (which I believe they're supposed to be), then I don't imagine it would be much effort to simply order extra, more dexterous hands like that you might find in newer MGs. I mean, if gunpla was an enormous sport like that IRL, I imagine those kinds of hands would be super popular.  Plavsky particles have been around for several years before the start of GBF. I imagine Bandai would be happy to milk that cash cow!"

In universe the explanation for not using other grades is most likely due to the higher costs from buying kits to get spare parts from, or to just get into gunpla battle. Out of universe the series is primarily focused towards kids, so they emphasize HGs and SDs because those are the two cheapest, simplest, and most common grades."

Not to mention, the Quattro-standin Athrun rejoins her factions, except under her unlike Char who took control after Haman died. Not to mention, they used to be in a relationship but that ended. Kamille is mind-raped and Shinn is pretty much a mess at the end of Zeta.  So basically, when does CE Judau (Lowe?) fight her? And when do we get Athrun's Counterattack?"

But she is not even close to being as well written as Haman. Char was never/ and never would be in a relationship with Haman Karn, especially after she had his unborn-child killed  in CDA.  If someone kills her or Kira, I hope it's William Gladys. As for a CCA scenario, we already had that at the beginning of destiny. The 'break the world' incident is clearly a reference to CCA.

The SAS is not inflated like a conventional spacesuit: it uses mechanical pressure, rather than air pressure, to compress the human body in low-pressure environments. Development was begun by NASA and the Air Force in the late 1950s and then again in the late 1960s, but neither design was used.

Edit: Found this on the gundam Wiki. www.gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Wiki:Technology   Pilot Suit  A lightweight type of normal suit designed for combat pilots. These form-fitting space suits provide a minimum of impediment to the pilot's movements. Only a handful of reckless pilots, like Char Aznable, Paptimus Scirocco and Haman Karn, are willing to forfeit the protection of the pilot suit in order to avoid this minor inconvenience.   Linear floating seat  During the One Year War, it was quickly becoming noticeable that standard seatbelts weren't protecting the pilots during tough battles. To lessen the shock of impacts, the Linear Seat was developed. A new type of pilot seat which becomes standard after the One Year War. In this arrangement, the seat is suspended in the center of the cockpit, supported by a linear arm which electromagnetically counters G-forces and impact shocks in order to protect the pilot. When used in conjunction with the 360-degree panoramic screen, the linear floating seat also gives the pilot a larger field of view and eliminates blind spots. Due to the superior performance of this setup, even older mobile suit models are often refitted with linear floating seats and panoramic screens."

Then, you can use your imagination to apply it to the rest of UC because hooking up to larger scale life support would make a lot of sense in space.

Gundam,37cjmi,PantsBonanza,1 point,Wed May 27 02:30:06 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they are just what the old OYW Zeon hoverbikes got developed into. Or they are just antiques by the time Victory comes around.  Here we go: the Wappa.
Gundam,37cjmi,Turambar87,1 point,Wed May 27 02:14:42 2015 UTC,The media on that page really fails to convey how cool those hover bikes were.
Gundam,37cjmi,super1upqueen,5,Wed May 27 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I struggled with the first half as well. I kept thinking ""please, please, PLEASE go into space!"" Then they did and it was cool for a little bit, but there were some filler-like episodes that killed the pace again. But it does get much better and it really rewards you for sticking with it. Does it always make sense? Nope, this is a Tomino-helmed series, after all. But it gets very entertaining and depressing (enterpressing!)."
Gundam,37cjmi,griff56,3,Tue May 26 18:21:42 2015 UTC,Enterpressing! I like it.  Definitely agreed with you on that one.

Gundam,3798go,dataznthug,10,Tue May 26 02:40:33 2015 UTC,"I think Shin summed it up pretty well:   Are you saying if it had been the chest beam, this would've been over already?   Fukuda basically made Kira so OP after the Strike vs. Aegis death match that the only way anyone has a chance against him is if they fight to kill while he fights to disarm. It's almost as lazy as the Gundams vs. Mobile Dolls scenario in Gundam Wing."
Gundam,3798go,godblow,2,Tue May 26 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and no attempt to fix it either. I liked Kira in seed because he wasn't invincible.."
Gundam,3798go,ShinnAssuka,5,Tue May 26 09:22:50 2015 UTC,I don't get that Kira in Seed didn't lose a single battle except the one vs Athrun which was more about Athrun being a true soldier than Kira being inferior as a pilot. In Seed Destiny he basically got his ass kicked by Shinn who was piloting a much worse MS. If anything he looked more invincible in Seed than in Seed Destiny because for the most part of Seed he was willing to kill his enemies.
Gundam,3798go,Hellowz,2,Tue May 26 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe at some point in DESTINY yeah, but not really as early as the final Aegis fight. Even in later parts of SEED he was getting beaten around by the druggies more than once and had a pretty close fight with Creuset."
Gundam,3798go,starcolored,4,Tue May 26 10:56:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I mean he looks OP when he's destroying a bunch of ZAFT units or EA units at once, but he's usually fighting a bunch of outdated suits with rookies piloting them (essentially Zeon at the end of the OYW) or the strike daggers which are more advanced but also have rookie pilots who are also naturals. But when others who have suits and experience to match him come along he's pushed pretty hard."
Gundam,3798go,Japboix1,1 point,Tue May 26 12:30:04 2015 UTC,I don't even think he was that OP to be honest he just had a shit ton of plot armor. Doesn't even come close to Kamille basically being invincible by the end of Zeta or Banagher newtype hax that disabled an entire fleet of MS.  Kira just wouldn't die but in term of battle well Shinn did beat him with an inferior suit and Athrun has proven to be his equal more than once.

Gundam,3798go,The--Comet,2,Tue May 26 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"The only mobile suit that can physically catch a Beam Saber outside of G Gundam would be Crossbone Gundam X-3. That Gundam literally has I-Fields in the palms of its hands, and that allows it to catch a Beam Saber.  Anti-Ship Swords are impractical as fuck to use in Mobile Suit Combat, since that's not what they're meant for in the first place. They're way too heavy and bulky to keep up with mobile suit fast movements, and they're not even coated in Anti-Beam Coating. Which is something I can at least give the Astray Blue Frame 2nd L credit for with its Giant Buster Sword. That at least makes it somewhat practical. With Anti-Ship Swords like the Schwert Gewehr and the Arondight, we have nothing stopping them from getting easily destroyed."

I see the firing of the waist cannon as an ""in your face"" to the arrogant/angsty Shinn... but now that I've re-watched the scene (in a video, not this gif) it would have been better had Kira reacted in a more human way (that's a hit that at least hurt his opponent's ego) rather than the poker face shown."

Gundam,37c3sl,starcolored,2,Wed May 27 13:19:52 2015 UTC,So what exactly was that bad about Moon Moon?   The fact that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It sounds like something out of G Gundam except somehow more ridiculous. It's completely out of place and contributes nothing to the plot. One moment they're getting dragged into a war then suddenly they're dealing with Aztec space ninjas that are somehow long-lost to a civilization mere decades old.  The actual episodes themselves are not unwatchable even if they're not really any good. It's the concept behind them that is so awful.
Gundam,37c3sl,starcolored,2,Tue May 26 15:36:29 2015 UTC,"An isolated Colony launched over 80 years ago has been taken over by a religious sect that's anti-technology. They're basically Space Amish with Spears.  The Argama learns that Beecha and Mondo have defected to the Endra and its how they capture Chara Soon which allows Glemy to rise in power. That's actually a good deal for 2 episodes. Its more like 1 moment they're fighting a war the next they need to be resupplied because they're fighting a war.  I feel an Axis Zeon commander hiring a Junk Dealer to fight the Zeta Gundam is more absurd. Especially when said Junk Dealer loses to: A rope, a gas tank and his own faulty design. And that episode adds nothing except the continued degeneration of Yazan from mass murderer to comic relief"
Gundam,37c3sl,Bortjort,3,Tue May 26 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"Moon-Moon is not just an isolated colony, it's a lost colony. The very idea is complete nonsense as colonies don't simply wander off or go missing short of Newtype magic. They're precious to the Earth as well as dangerous in the wrong hands so if something happens to one of them somebody is going to go investigate. Don't you think the Earth government is going to show some slight concern when this... I don't even know how much one would cost, trillion-plus dollar tin can housing tens of millions of people suddenly vanishes? And again, I must reiterate, Aztec space ninjas. They wore like suits of armor or some shit, where did they even get them? From their concept to their appearance it's completely zany and out of place.  Like, crazy religious cult, okay.

Gundam,37c3sl,Xikar_Wyhart,1 point,Tue May 26 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"Doan's Island, really? That one stuck out to you? I never understood why Tomino wanted to get rid of it in the first place, it's one of the few episodes that really makes a point of showing that the Zekes aren't all bad."
Gundam,37c3sl,Xikar_Wyhart,1 point,Thu May 28 23:56:41 2015 UTC,Is it really powered up by ghosts? Or is that just a visual representation for the audience to show the pilot using their Newtype extra sensory perception to be a better pilot by channeling the emotional turmoil of those who just died.
Gundam,37c3sl,picklepartner99,1 point,Wed May 27 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with Moon Moon isn't it's plot or characters but it's location.  Moon Moon is a ""lost"" colony ran by people who apparently have shunned space age and even current technology and regressed to Iron age maybe Bronze Age level of society and culture. This is too a point of referring to Mobile Suits as a Metal Giant, rather than at least a machine or a robot. Yet they or at least their leaders acknowledge that they live on a space colony.   Had this occurred some place on Earth in an area isolated from most of the world founded by people who dislike technology sometime in the far past before the series it could work. This would mean there was a group of people not familiar with technology at all, following and believing an ancient style religion.  The only change would mean a set of characters wouldn't appear later, of coarse this change would probably change the entire story."

Gundam,37a963,DreamcastJunkie,2,Tue May 26 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"""Aftermarket prices"" is just the nice way of saying ""scalpers"".  It took about a year for legitimate businesses to sell out of those DVDs, and they were't hard to find in that time.  I would be more surprised to find Gundam fans who didn't own those, since they were Bandai USA's last releases and they were easy to get for a relatively long time.  They're the ones that I have, and I have them mainly because they were much cheaper and easier to get than trying to collect all of the dub-only DVDs from the original release."
Gundam,37a963,vinnnieboy,3,Tue May 26 16:59:35 2015 UTC,That makes me kind of sad. I'm relatively new to collecting dvd and blu ray sets so I never got the chance to get them at those prices :(

Gundam,37a963,pterynxli,3,Tue May 26 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen on unboxing videos, this Turn-A DVD is pretty high-quality. The inside cover art was taken from the Japanese Blu-ray box cover, and the DVDs themselves have nice artwork as well.  I just wish there was more on the actual DVDs themselves besides the show itself. While it's OK to make it a sub-only DVD for now, there could have been a behind-the-scenes clip or two and/or interview. Hell, it'd be awesome to have had a feature w/ Syd Mead regarding his mecha designs. Maybe these aspects will be covered if Turn-A ever gets a North American Blu-ray edition.  Bandai/Sunrise really should open up a new full-fledged American branch, along the lines of Aniplex-USA and/or NIS-America. Doing so can potentially improve the localization of their Gundam offerings, with fully translated bonus items and maybe dubs of the newer TV shows. As cool as their Origin collector's edition looks (price notwithstanding), it'd be even better if the included art book was translated to English.  But for now, let's try and make the most of what's made available."
Gundam,37a963,OZKai,2,Tue May 26 07:26:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. All we can really do at this point is show Bandai/Sunrise that there is a a strong market for Gundam over here. Granted I think we're definitely on the right track, as they wouldn't simu dub Unicorn and Origin if they didn't think it would sell. Not to mention how extremely well the Origin manga is selling, its been like the #1 every time I look at manga sales. All signs are pointing to a resurge of Gundam in North America. Suddenly the chances of Full/Maxi boost being brought over here has risen. Probably still close to 0% though. I man can dream..."

Gundam,376l9a,redhawkinferno,1 point,Mon May 25 22:18:14 2015 UTC,81 is a bridge pickup though isn't it? (am not a expert - I have the 57/66 set myself).

Gundam,378jp5,ZeraX7,4,Mon May 25 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"thanks. I never knew about this before.   I completely agree with this ending and it actually does make sense as to why Char was having a complete 180 degree perspective from zeta to CCA even though Tomino probably did not write this ending  Remember the last Amuro conversation with Char in CCA, he said,"" I am not as impatient as you, i can wait for humanity to learn and grow"" , implying that Char already has had enough with clinging a ""false"" hope with fellow human being whose souls were bound by gravity, thinking that there's no way to make them understand unless by fast forward his goal by dropping Axis in CCA."
Gundam,378jp5,gaming99,5,Mon May 25 22:24:35 2015 UTC,It's nice because it gives us some sort of bridge between quattro and CCA Char. The only thing that stands out in my mind is that kamille and char have an unresolved ending.
Gundam,378jp5,puffnstuff272,4,Mon May 25 22:41:28 2015 UTC,"technically if its animated, its cannon, that rule generally applies to the actual series since some animated shorts such as one-of-seventy-two and the short depicting mask from g-reco in a unicorn phenex against the protagonists isnt necessarily cannon. However this fits in nicely with the continuity of UC, where it shows why his motivations shifted and he goes from being quattro bajeena to Char aznable of neo zeon. I have heard it being said that in zeta char was hopeful of humanity, but after the gryps conflict he loses the hope he had for humanity and chooses more radical ideologies to use the power of neo zeon to force humanity into space which he sees as a necessary step in order to both preserve the earth and bring about the next step of humanity."
Gundam,378jp5,a_friend_of_yours,3,Mon May 25 20:55:26 2015 UTC,you can accept it as being so. I don't think Japanese fiction has the same concept of cannon as western media does (getter robo and it's ovas vs the manga)
Gundam,378jp5,Amuro_Ray,3,Mon May 25 22:51:15 2015 UTC,Not really. It isn't canon because it is from a video game. And there are many franchises in the West like Getter where each iteration is standalone
Gundam,378jp5,Nick700,2,Tue May 26 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"No, Tomino was not the one writing it so it was not in his mind while writing CCA or anything"
Gundam,378jp5,Nick700,1 point,Tue May 26 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Fun fact, Char (and possibly Amuro) is supposed to appear in ZZ in the second half, and CCA was not suppose to happen at the time when Tomino is directing Zeta, which is why any mentioning of Char is deliberately avoided at the end of Zeta and he appears on the opening of ZZ. It could be that this scene was originally intended to be shown in ZZ as a follow up to explain his change of mind, but due to Char and Amuro being cut, this part of the script also ended up nowhere."
Gundam,378jp5,BoyGodz,2,Tue May 26 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think if CCA was never suggested, char just would have been what Glemy is in the final version of ZZ."

Gundam,378jp5,BoyGodz,1 point,Tue May 26 02:11:14 2015 UTC,"Lots of stuff not written by Tomino is still canon (08th MS Team, Unicorn, etc..) but I agree that this probably isn't canon at all."
Gundam,378jp5,wikired,2,Sat May 30 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"No, but it doesn't need to be.  Kamille is just one example of the kind of mentality that Char is pitting himself against.  It's nice to have a single incident to point to and say ""this is what caused him to change,"" but there's so much to support that, that even if we assume this incident never happened, even if you never grant that Char even knows about Kamille's mind-wipe, his behavior change makes perfect sense."
Gundam,378jp5,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Tue May 26 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"Gundam officially follows three levels of canon: White, Gray and Black.  White refers to anything animated and is considered 100% official.  There is also some debate about some mangas such as Blue Destiny fitting in to this category as they are very much considered official by Sunrise and Bandai.  Gray are works that are considered to fit in to the timeline but not officially done by Sunrise.  This would be things like the Formula 90 or Crossbone Gundam mangas.   Black are things that do not fit in whatsoever and contradict existing works.  I suppose you could consider things like Char's Deleted Affair to fall into this category.  This clip in question would definitely be Gray.  It's no means regular canon but contradicts nothing so it could potentially fit.  Keep in mind of course that Japan doesn't really care as much about having a solid canon and what contradicts what as much as Western audiences do."
Gundam,378jp5,Meatpurse,0,Wed Jun 3 05:18:00 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.   Yes, since it explains why Char would change so much from the end of Zeta.   No, since it would contradict the ending of the MSG:Zeta films (which retconned Kamille's mindrape, but I'm not sure if even that is considered true canon or not).  At the end of the day, I think Char would've inevitably walked down the path of Axis Drop regardless of what happened to Kamille because of his sensitivity as a Newtype. Char has seen war after war and, more than any other, he was always a leader and better suited for politics. Eventually, he would've burdened himself with fanatic view in order to end all the pain and suffering of others; Char would willingly be the sacrifice that freed all the souls from the bonds of gravity."
Gundam,378jp5,godblow,3,Tue May 26 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"There is an easy answer for the continuity problem. Zeta Gundam: A New Translation is not a retcon, it is what its name suggests, just a new translation of the Zeta Gundam story in an alternate universe.  There is more changes than just Kamille staying sane in the movies. Neo Zeon got driven away, AEUG presumably got reabsorbed back into Earth Federation early after having no enemy to be in war with, so no Londo Bell elite team to be formed. No Nahel Argama since the Argama stayed intact after Gryps war. Haman Karn didn't die and she is still be by little Minerva's side, Zabi supporter is still strong within Axis so they won't be likely to follow Char any time soon. Char would probably have to find another asteroid as big as Axis to throw, as well as another entire fleet of army, so basically everything to build another Neo Zeon.  It has more impact than just Char being a little less motivated, if he still want counter attack somehow, it would likely be entirely a different event than what we see in CCA, Unicorn will be almost certainly impossible to happen.

G-reco wasn't supposed to be something that'd need an infograph to show the different factions and relations, but it is, unfortunately."
Gundam,378pru,Char_X_3,2,Mon May 25 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"G-reco wasn't supposed to be something that'd need an infograph to show the different factions and relations, but it is, unfortunately.   Tomino has said that he purposefully made G-Reco hard to follow because he wanted the audience to think about what was happening. I'm going to say he succeeded in that regard. I only understand what I do because I took the information I was given and pieced together what was going on myself. It's kinda fun like that, but frustrating as well. It's so damn easy to miss something vital.  OP, you're going to have to decide for yourself. It's a very fun and likable show, but don't expect it to make sense unless you work for it. Also it might help if you brush up on some current issues Japan is facing, like the Abe administration's attempts at remilitarization or Japan's dependency on foreign energy. Tomino also wanted the kids to think about things like those.  ...Yeah. Big on ""kids are the future,"" Tomino is."
Gundam,378pru,OutZoned,3,Tue May 26 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"G-Reco gets extremely convoluted. You have to make several logical leaps to understand story and characters before things get explained. There's also not really totally clear good guy/bad guy narrative like most other Gundam shows.  But it's very pretty and I actually really like the suit designs. They look very futuristic. If you just let the story go where it goes without much thought, you can enjoy the battles, visuals and music."

With that being said for me the show definitely improved throughout as the conflicts got better and had a bit more depth to them."
Gundam,378f75,CybranKNight,3,Mon May 25 19:02:33 2015 UTC,It what got me into the series i liked a lot of the characters and gundams how each of them are unique and different from eachother. plus the music and the presentation are fantastic i love the old school animation and shading. it does have some of that 90's corney stuff to it. overall i enjoyed it but looking back on it i can see what other people are saying about the series that was negative i love it since it was my first series and its understandable that not everyone going to fanboy over it like i did.  plus i think the movie after the seires is a great watch. also it starts off slow and heats up i say give it a chance by episode 10 it should start to pick up! hope that helped you at all!

Gundam,378f75,gaming99,2,Mon May 25 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"For North American audience, Wing is probably their first entry to Gundam series. I grew up watching 0079 and zeta before wing , etc came up the surface. I ended up watching wing as well after that.  As whether wing is worth watching or not... I can only speak from my experience here, so bear with me.  Having watched UC 0079-0093 and wing, it requires two complete different mindset. UC offers a very personal story of your protagonist struggle as they were dragged through the war , Wing on the other hand felt like using an impersonal approach to the characters and not really evokes my emotion at all. It's very cut and dry, different from UC approach which is very emotional at times.   I remember reading Gundam wing's director interview somewhere, he said that he didn't like Tomino approach in Gundam and tried to use a different method / approach in storyline. This probably explain why people either like Wing and hate UC, and like UC and hate wing. Rarely you encounter people who like them both.  So in my opinion, if you have a lot of spare times in your hand, watch it. So that you can form your own opinion whether you are going to like the series or not. Atleast if you ended up hating it, you can explain to everyone on the internet forum as to why you hate it logically."
Gundam,378f75,Brenticus302,2,Mon May 25 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a UC Elitist who started w/ Wing on Toonami (like everyone else), I can't imagine how hard it would be to go from UC to Wing.  To me, it depends on how you feel about the rule of cool vs. actual substance.  Or about the overall tone of a series vs. value of its parts.    Why does one of the Gundams have a scythe?  Isn't that like the worst idea for a weapon ever?  Yes, but it's cool. Why does X do Y sometimes but not at other times?  Because it's cool.  There's not a lot of substance to it, but it takes a lot of joy out of blowing up robots, and it has a lot of personality.  It's the American blockbuster of Gundam.  Not quite Michael Bay level (well maybe early The Rock-era Michael Bay), but anyway.  It's only good if you're cool with the idea of a big show with some really cool mecha, lots of plot twists and action and huge themes...none of which stand up to much scrutiny.  But if you can just sorta sit back and ignore the ""doesn't stand up to scrutiny"" part then it's a fun ride, I think.    It's better than the sum of its (subpar) parts, IMHO."
Gundam,378f75,Brenticus302,2,Tue May 26 13:47:30 2015 UTC,Oh and IMHO it also depends on how well you handle really silly/ campy things.  Sometimes Gundam W does some stuff that makes NO sense or is just laughable.  I am able to laugh at it and move on without thinking it's lame.  Some people aren't.  It helps though if you can laugh at something that is funny by accident and still think it's cool.

Gundam,378f75,rumitg2,1 point,Sun May 31 00:56:33 2015 UTC,I think its worth it just for the music and how obviously non serious it takes itself. As another commenter said the show is more focused on being cool and doing cool things with the suites and characters rather than developing a deep and engaging plot.   I love it but that's entirely because of its music and the awesome fight scenes

Gundam,378f75,Tickettack,1 point,Sun May 31 00:54:49 2015 UTC,"I just finished watching both wing & SEED.  I'm working on Destiny right now.    I would say it's definitely worth a watch.  It does feel a bit dragged out, and the progression of the plot feels really manipulated at times, but arc is compelling.  For those who say it feels dated, they're not wrong, in the sense that it was published 20 years ago, and there would have been more fuss if it allowed some of the things the later shows incorporated (sexualized characters, adult language to name two).  Also the episodes are longer than those in SEED.  Significantly, some of the epsiodes of SEED were like 15 minutes.  Also if the english dub is pretty good.  tl;dr the series feels long, but progresses quickly towards the middle.  Very Solid."
Gundam,378f75,simsoy,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"Gundam Wing is a show that only people who watched it when it was on TV could enjoy. I've rewatched it a few times, Wing being my second Gundam series and third anime ever but since it's been years and I've gone into fresh from the entire UC universe Wing is just utter crap in comparison. It's boring, lacks interesting direction of animation or the show itself, lacks interesting or well developed characters, the plot is heavy with political stuff but unlike Zeta or Turn-A it's not remotely interesting.  Skip Wing.  If you aren't gushing from nostalgia over Wing and don't immediately fall in love with the show by the first few episodes then you won't like the show."

The plan was to drop a few colonies and then sent in the Gundams for supression and clean up. But the colonists got into argument with themselves regarding the decision of the colonies drop, so 5 doctors took the initiative to start the own agenda early and arranged to have their Gundam ""stolen and what not"" by the Gundam pilot.

Gundam,378f75,simsoy,1 point,Mon May 25 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair the show is slow as hell, the first 90% of it is just small trickles of information until they get back into space, but even then they spend most of that going on about the dolls.

Gundam,378f75,BoyGodz,1 point,Tue May 26 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"Trickles of information to slowly revealing the overarching plot is how anime is done in the 90's, Domon needs 20 episodes or so to go around battling fighters from each country, Garrod needs 20 episodes to travel around all those small post-apoclytic towns, Loran spend 90% of his time on the ground rather on Turn A, Uso spend more than half of the series to have his team all killed, even Judau who isn't a exactly a 90's protagonist spend half his time in some Sunday afternoon cartoon drama. It does give enough plot to warrant 50 episodes, you just need to pay enough attention."

At least the events of the early episode does plays into the main arch of the series.

Gundam,377hjl,Dhoffran,10,Mon May 25 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"I am here to help!  These kits are generally referred to as ""gunpla"", short for ""gundam plastic"".  But you can also look for ""mecha models"" in general and find sites dedicated to similar kits.  There is a separate subreddit /r/gunpla dedicated to the art of making these models, and is full of people generally willing to kindly help.  But I understand that can be overwhelming for a new interest, so I will give you a brief rundown below.  There are a lot of different ""grades"", the main ones being:  HG -- ""High Grade""  (sometimes you see it as HGUC) -- This is the kit you had, and it's generally the easiest to assemble, fewest pieces, but lowest ""quality"".  (E.g. usually don't have moveable fingers, fewer pieces).  They are also the cheapest, usually about 10-30 dollars.  The figurines are 1/144 scale, so about 6 inches tall.  MG -- ""Master Grade"" -- These kits are larger, 1/100 scale, or about 10 inches tall.  They have more pieces, take more time to construct, and are generally 2 to 3 times the price of a HG kit.  However, enthusiasts often enjoy these kits as they can produce a wider range of poses and look more realistic.  Generally these kits have an internal ""skeleton"" system, with covers on top, rather than the sometimes ""hollow"" feeling of some HG.  They often come with many more stickers or more weapons as well.  RG -- ""Real Grade"" -- this is the relatively recent line of gunpla that takes the best parts of MG and combines it with HG.  The scale is 1/144 like the HG kits, but they have internal skeletons and more stickers, better articulation, etc.  The price is also between that of an HG and an MG.  There are other grades you'll see sometimes such as PG (""Perfect grade"") or RE/100, or even kits that are ""ungraded"" or have ""no grade"".  But these are generally very limited product lines or expensive.  If you are uncertain about how interested you are, you can buy some kits on amazon, I did when I was just starting out.  Just be careful to look at shipping as some of the kits are being resold from Japan and will ship from Japan.    There are also several great online retailers dedicated to Mecha.  I have had good experiences with www.gundamplanet.com (which also features a physical location in NJ), but if you are willing to wait for a slightly lower price you can also try HobbyLinkJapan (www.hlj.com).  There are more to be found at the /r/gunpla subreddit sidebar.  I wish I could give you more advice for what to build with a 5 year old son.  I would suggest sticking with HG, as MG has small pieces that might be frustrating to a young child and generally takes much longer.  I know there is a ""Starter kit"" that contains a Zaku II and a basic Gundam that can help you get started, but I believe the quality of those particular models is a bit low.  If you start enjoying the process and want to make better looking models, there are a bunch of tutorials and people willing to help over at /r/gunpla.  And of course you should feel free to reply here and I will be happy to answer questions."
Gundam,377hjl,OhUmHmm,4,Mon May 25 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. High grade it will be then. We do it together, he looks up the parts and if possible presses them in the correct location. I do the final push so it clicks. I also do the cutting and getting rid of the cut marks.  With a 5 year old it took me around 3 days to build. Around 2 hours a day. With him being actively present and while building.   Anything more difficult would take too long and now he can actually do parts himself.  The prices for high grade are affordable too.   edit: /r/Gunpla was what I was looking for thanks!"

Also, for ""あっちもガンダムで来るのか…！"", I feel like ""They have a Gundam too!?"", would work better than ""Another Gundam pilot...!"", as Banagher seems to be surprised to be encountering a Gundam itself, moreso than the pilot."

This is the kind of situation a lot of translators tend to disagree, even professionally, due to the sentence and what it implies being up for interpretation.  Just to support my point though, I had thought that the ""そんな動きじゃ...!"", would've been followed up by something akin to ""落ちちまうぞ!"" or ""落としちまうぞ!"" I had bet on the latter which would've been implying banagher was out to take them out. In retrospect, the former probably would've made more sense given it being banagher. A translation that may work for that interpretation could be something like ""If you keep that up...!"", implying that the enemy is forcing him into something he really doesn't want to do."

Gundam,372fmw,maknaedik,1 point,Mon May 25 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"I would've killed him in Seed like what the original plan is :3  Oh no, I'm not a bandwagoner who hates Seed overall nor hating at the series at all. It's my honest opinion and hear me out.  I like Seed, actually, I love Seed. With the story being good, yes good and it being a rip-off is a debate of its own, but yeah; GREAT MS designs and good soundtrack, it's undoubtedly my most favorite overall. Then why kill Kira? Because I like him as he is in Seed. It would've been perfect, but no, they let him live and now became Jesus. You don't become Jesus and not die first y'know. No, seriously, when I like characters so much, I want them either dead or become godlike (Kouta from Gaim and Goku in DB:GT). That's the reason I also wanted Amuro dead after CCA :3  Why I don't like Kira in GSD? Apart from GSD's story and storytelling becoming crazy, his character is always someone who always questions and if you say no, you'll be sliced up. I can see why people hate him, but for his MS alone, I really like it overall. Though the design is kinda dumb because you can't use VL when dragoons aren't deployed. Perhaps, that's the only thing I would change in SF"
Gundam,372fmw,victorXvictory,0,Mon May 25 06:31:45 2015 UTC,First thing I'll do is to revert Kira in Destiny into Kira pre-Freedom in SEED. That will at least make Kira more interesting
Gundam,372fv8,tinyraccoon,5,Sun May 24 06:04:58 2015 UTC,"the show ended at 25 episodes, the ending is very conclusive but abrupt and about as much sense as the 3-4 armies all fighting each other when at least two of them seemed to basically come out of nowhere  the whole series suffers from feeling very disjointed and not making a lot of sense but if you can put that aside it has some good battles, great animation, and the main cast is relatively likable"
Gundam,372fv8,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Sun May 24 14:34:23 2015 UTC,"I recommend buying the Blu Ray to watch the series, they will be translated by Rightstuf and it's rework by Tomino because of the anime not being a 50 episodes long."
Gundam,372fv8,Vatepgo1,1 point,Sun May 24 10:35:49 2015 UTC,"Is G Reco worth finishing given what I posted above?   Well, I liked it and found it somewhat empowering. But I'm not everyone, so proceed at your own risk. There's some freaking awesome suits and battles in the last half though.   Or were the remaining episodes just as disjointed, incoherent, and confusing as the ones I described?   Yep. Making sense of this show is half the fun. But there is a method to Tomino's madness (or is that a madness to his method?) in all this. Trust me. All the information you need to understand this show is there, just Tomino never calls attention to it.   You ever see Yahtzee's review of Dark Souls? It's a similar kind of storytelling to how he describes that.  Just try starting again from the beginning and see how much more of it makes sense with stuff you learned from later in the show. Trust me, it helps. And if you ever have questions, don't be afraid to ask.   Did the story have at least a satisfying, logical ending or was it more of an ambiguous ending?   Both? I guess. The war ends but what the Megafauna's crew does afterwards is anyone's guess. I believe Tomino wished for the audience to decide given the themes of the series.   Did the show end at 25 episodes or was there a second season or sequel?   No second series or sequel announced as of this moment."
Gundam,372fv8,Char_X_3,1 point,Sun May 24 14:22:18 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at the same episode you dropped the series at. The series is seriously flawed with inconsistent and aimless plot, boring, with many visual errors, silly dialogues and overall average quality. I'm really disappointed since it made by Tomino which is my favorite director. I watched most of his works from 77's Zambot 3 to 2005's Zeta Movies. It's like his other work, Wings of Rean, the pace is ridiculous, the plot is lost, but battles and animations are good. I'm still hoping the series get better. Just to add, i like his trend of making realistic characters here, like in Xabungle."
Gundam,371r8i,WaitingOnEbayOrder,4,Sun May 24 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, the sudden shift from brooding and depressing melodrama in Zeta Gundam to slapstick in Double Zeta is a little bit jarring at first and makes it hard to watch. However, once Double Zeta reaches the halfway point it becomes a lot darker and more serious (though not as much as Zeta Gundam) and gets infinitly better. The truth is you really don't need to watch Double Zeta in order to understand anything that happens in Char's Counterattack (All you need to watch is the original Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta Gundam to get enough context for the film). However, I would recommend sticking with Double Zeta though because it does phenomenally good at the half way point."
Gundam,371r8i,Bryn013,1 point,Sun May 24 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"Shoot, you don't need to watch anything but 0079 to get Char's Counterattack, Char and Amuro both pretty much regressed to their OYW selves for that one. I've heard that some of the character deaths in ZZ explain why certain important characters aren't in CCA, though."
Gundam,371r8i,Owyn_Merrilin,3,Sun May 24 19:54:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, but Zeta Gundam provides important context to understand Char's actions during CCA as well. yea, 0079 is pretty much all you need to understand Amuro's perspective (since he doesn't get much to do in Zeta Gundam) But I feel that Zeta Gundam is essential to getting a fuller picture of Char as a character before CCA."
Gundam,371r8i,Bryn013,3,Mon May 25 01:19:45 2015 UTC,"For me, Char in particular confuses me about CCA. Amuro didn't really have much character development in Zeta, aside from the obvious point of him not hating Char's guts and actually working alongside him to take down the titans. Char's development makes ""card carrying villain who wants to destroy the earth"" a really weird place for him to go.  He seemed pretty interested in protecting the planet, even if he wasn't crazy about the people living on it. Axis would have wiped out a lot more than the earth's human population if it had landed.  Edit: Okay, wow. I just watched the episode where Four dies for the first time. I cannot see that pair of war weary soldiers, the ones who looked on helpless as another trio of starcrossed newtypes repeated their tragedy from the battle of A Baoa Qu, being at each other's throats over Lalah again a decade later. All I can see them doing is teaming up to put an end to the wars. But not by dropping a giant friggin' rock on the planet the way Char wanted."
Gundam,371r8i,Owyn_Merrilin,4,Mon May 25 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed ZZ. I think most people nowadays agree it gets more hate than it really deserves, but that doesn't mean there are not bad episodes. There definitely are."
Gundam,371r8i,jackoctober,3,Sun May 24 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"ZZ definitely improves as it goes on. It has some really great arcs, and some really bad ones, but the second half has much more good than bad.   I wouldn't say it's necessary for CCA, but I would say you should watch it if you want to get the absolute maximum out of Unicorn. Unicorn made watching ZZ very much worth it, in my opinion."
Gundam,371r8i,OutZoned,3,Sun May 24 03:41:06 2015 UTC,I just finished ZZ earlier this week. I'd say the first few episodes are hard to get through.... And then it gets progressively better. There are some things referenced in later productions but not as much from zeta.

Gundam,370huv,johnzaku,3,Sun May 24 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"The difference between a bit and a funnel is that the former is powered by a generator, allowing for indefinite operation time while the latter is battery-powered, which requires frequent recharging.   Fin Funnels are technically bits since they are powered by generators, which also increases their firepower (putting them on par with battleship cannons as Wacky have said) and enabling them to generate the Fin Funnel Field (which I think, also requires a high power output). They are named as such because they are Fin-shaped and IMO, the word ""funnel"" for ""Fin Funnel"" sounds better than ""Fin Bits""."

It's just that overtime, they evolve and improve their technological designs, and create more advanced versions of Bits.  Bits are the first type of Remote Weapons out of the 3 starting with the Elmeth. Funnels then came next, and became a more Mainstream Version of Bits. This is definitely seen the most with Zeta Gundam and ZZ Gundam for sure. Then came Char's Counterattack, where Nu Gundam introduced Fin Funnels; which at the time, were the most Powerful Version of Funnels out there. Said to have the firepower of a Battleship Cannon with each Fin Funnel.  But yeah, they all started out from the same technology of ""Bits"". And from there, they just evolved technologically into newer and more improved versions of what was originally called ""Bits""."

Gundam,370huv,milkmatchatea,0,Sun May 24 09:46:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are many differences between funnels and fin funnels - they're generally independent drone units that primarily fire beams as their main weapon. They are controlled in some cases, if not all, by the pilot who's able to micromanage them through Newtype powers of elevated spatial understanding. Notable examples include the Quebeley's funnels, the Nu's funnels, etc.  Bits, on the other hand, sometimes cross the line by serving as Shields (Shield Bits, think Lockon Stratos), Fangs (Throne units), etc. They serve a more physical purpose, and are less about beam weaponry, but sometimes they're functionally identical to Funnels (Rose Bits)."
Gundam,370huv,Edgewood,4,Sat May 23 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"Bits and Funnels are different depending on the timeline in which they are featured.

You can fly around with the best suit in the universe, but if you suck, you will get clowned by people using the cheap suits.   Also, it's a 50vs50 battle; no matter how good you are, if you try to solo entire groups of people you will get murdered super fast."
Gundam,373f46,Dagonsev,2,Mon May 25 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"Well I wish I could say skill, but skill can only do so much against something that has a 1,210 armor shield, 2,200 armor, high weight balance, one of the best bazookas in the game, and second best instant switch gatling gun in the game. That thing will destroy pretty much anything in a dogfight.  So yes its both. The federation has also had for months a suit that can 1shot any unit in the game from long range and the weapon is refillable. Not to mention it ignores shields and can penetrate up to 3 units. So if 3 guys are lined up a thick beam you barely have to aim with will knock you out. it deals roughly 3000 points of armor damage. So most units die to it.  That said its about 70% skill 30% suit. I roll gigans and Zaku I's currently because I don't have the suits I want that I feel are best to counter the federation units. Its better to live cheap with units that are cheap and respawn pretty fast. I do alright, when I try I can get top 5 almost every game.

Gundam,373f46,-Troika-,2,Sun May 24 19:50:50 2015 UTC,One player who knows what hes doing can make a difference.  Two players who know what their doing can shift the tides.  A platoon (6) of experienced players can dominate the battlefield.  Especially if they are rats.

Gundam online will never be big enough to make money from a stream so I know that's also about your passion.  So thank you.  My question is basically ""What did I do wrong?""  I tried MSG online and even after a week of playing, constantly got killed.  I would go entire battles with exactly one kill, maybe 0 or 2 tops.  I didn't spend any money but I did do the digital gashapons, etc.  I probably didn't have very good suits or weapons -- but it seems like the gap was so large it had to be that I just was no good.  After several weeks it just stopped being fun.  Did I miss something?"
Gundam,373f46,amuroday,3,Mon May 25 01:23:02 2015 UTC,I have doubts about this guy but I rolled around on MSGO for a while. The best way to think of it is that when you start you are the nameless mook #54 from the entire gundam franchise. You're going to suck for a while and you're going to suck hardcore. The best things I can reccomend for newer players is to know when to back off and focus on supporting rather than leading.   You will die in teamfights and that's okay.

Gundam,36y9z2,maknaedik,2,Sat May 23 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"Matt Healy? Now that is a name ive never heard in Gundam before, why is this guy so bad, that he's above Shinn?"
Gundam,36y9z2,Awesom3xNinja,6,Sat May 23 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"To put it simply: He's the Kira Yamato of the Universal Century Timeline.  Yes. I said that. Let that absorb for a minute.  A Kira Yamato type Character in the Universal Century Timeline.  Seriously. This is a thing. I wish I was fucking kidding. =_=;;  But alas, it's true. Just like Kio Asuno, Matt Healy is yet another failed attempt at making a Pacifist Fighter. And the worst part, and I stress this yet again: He's in the fucking U.C! God, how embarrassing....  Here's his bio for you:   He is gentle and kind in demeanor, and is always looking out for his team. He lives by the philosophy that no human should be killed, and refuses to kill any of his enemies. Due to this, he often ignores strategic advice from the team's operator, Noel Anderson, and comes into conflict with her. Despite this, the whole team still has great faith in him since no team members have died while fighting under his command. Matt has participated in the strategically important battles of Operation Odessa and Battle of Jaburo. He retired from the military after the war and lived as a civilian in Australia.   Oh, but it doesn't end there:   In the Gundam Legacy Manga, apparently he decides to join the TITANS, of all fucking people. Unsurprisingly, their methods completely contradict his beliefs, so he ends up quitting the Titans completely to stop a renegade Zeon Attack by working with the famous aces pilots Ford Romfellow and Lieutenant Agar, and the Republic of Zeon forces. He is also responsible for rescuing ex-Zeon engineer May Cowin from the Titans, at the request of Ken Bederstadt.   But seriously. Matt Healy is by far The Worst Character in the Entire Universal Century Timeline. His Kira Yamato styled pacificsm is just so out-of-place and cringe-worthy to watch."

That's not the end of the tragedy though.  Then, her two younger siblings were taken in by the Federation, who transferred them into the Psycho Gundam Project.  At least one of the younger siblings was used as a test subject for the Psycho Gundam prototyped.  He had his brain fried and died.  The fate of the other younger sibling is less clear.

Gundam,36x4kp,amuroday,9,Fri May 22 21:05:43 2015 UTC,Wasn't it after Garma died that Degwin started to take a back seat when it came to ruling Zeon? I remember he always seemed pretty remorseful afterword. I believe right before he went to go talk peace terms with general Revil he was still mourning the death of his son.    I don't think he was ever trying to turn a new leaf or anything. It was just him feeling the effects of war on a personal level and wanting to prevent any further loss. Probably more of a selfish decision than a moral one imo.
Gundam,36x4kp,DefrostedTuna,2,Fri May 22 21:20:38 2015 UTC,I believe you are correct. But even if that is the case .it says something about him in a way .most people like him would have went crazy and continued the blood flow .it was probably selfish .but it seems as if he was at least somewhat empathetic in one form or another .
Gundam,36x4kp,OhUmHmm,6,Fri May 22 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, Gihren's Greed (the video game) claims that Gihren was the one behind Zeon's assassination.  Non-canon but I see it mostly as him taking a backseat of the events leading up to OYW.  The novelization also paints him as ""not in control"" and he even tries to get rid of Gihren at times.  I think him trying to forge peace with federation mostly redeems him in my eyes."
Gundam,36x4kp,OhUmHmm,2,Fri May 22 21:32:09 2015 UTC,That's awesome I'm actually really considering the purchase of the novels !I agree it does seem to come off that way in general .I just have to wonder .what would have happened if he made it to his destination and began the peace talks.  It's so odd because his mind is so guarded in the show his actual thoughts and intentions seem so mysterious.  I honestly hope we get more information on him in the next origin. I know it's not cannon but it would be so interesting to know the true Degwin zabi .
Gundam,36x4kp,OhUmHmm,4,Fri May 22 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"I found the novels a great purchase!  They provide a lot of additional little details into the background - e.g. why white base is called a Trojan Horse -- that were either too difficult or unnecessary to animate.  I got mine used off amazon for about 4-5 dollars.  They printed a second edition but looking through amazon I didn't see any difference between the first and second edition (the first was a bit cheaper at the time).  I agree Degwin seems an interesting character -- it's very non-canon but there is a comic / animated shorts called ""Gundam-san"" that treats him like a lazy, middle aged man.  Kind of hard not to like him after that.  If you cannot wait for the next Origin OVA, I might recommend the Origin comics -- they are beautiful and cover the entire original MS Gundam, not just Char's backstory.  Vertical publishing has published a beautiful set in English that I consider the pride of my Gundam collection (not by rarity but because they're just so great)."
Gundam,36x4kp,troykaiba,2,Fri May 22 22:01:38 2015 UTC,I heard there are two translations of the novels .which is more accurate or better in your opinion? I have her of San before !I was I  interested in them .in thought they were comedy based like the SD series which I haven't really given a fair chance .but I'd be quite interested in learning more about him even from another perspective.
Gundam,36x4kp,OhUmHmm,2,Fri May 22 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard there were two translations!  I have been reading this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-Escalation-Confrontation/dp/1880656868/ref=tmm_pap_title_1?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=  Which appears to be the ealier edition of this   http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-Escalation-Confrontation/dp/1611720052/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=  But both list the same translator and had the same translator preface.  I will say that the first edition reads perfectly fine -- the translator mentions an even earlier translation which had slightly different name spellings (Sha instead of Char).  I am not aware of any differences between the first and second edition besides the cover but let me know if you learn something!  Yeah the Gundam-san series is quite a laugh, here's the one I was thinking of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flAJjZVYXPk"

Gundam,36vmui,DenkouNova,5,Fri May 22 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"As a product, I feel the Gundam universe could take more risks. A lot of products are done with the mindset ""let's release this, people will buy it because it's stuff they already know"".  Because of this most manga and almost all games take place during or right after One Year War (Sora: senkou no hate ni, Blue Destiny, Gundam Senki, L'École du Ciel). Money gets poured in crossover stuff like Build Fighters and games like Gundam Breaker and Gundam Extreme VS.  Meanwhile G-Reco gets 26 episodes.  Look at it this way: Crossbone isn't animated because animating it would not generate any additional revenue in the form of related products. Crossbone is already in crossover games and people are buying the games as well as the gunpla. Its media mix market is already saturated.  That being said, it's great that Sunrise is making money, and they don't owe me anything. There is not a lot of side stuff for G-Reco and AGE, but Anno Domini did provide us with tons of new great content (and some less great content). Perhaps the next big thing is going to be as big as Anno Domini or Cosmic Era. It's just that I would like to see After War, Correct Century and late UC expanded, and I know it's never going to happen. :<"

The penetration into the American market of the series such as Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh!  gave rise to the recognition of what is variously called transmedia storytelling, crossmedia, transmediation, media synergy, etc.   Researchers argue that the 1963 Tetsuwan Atomu marked a shift in Japanese marketing: from the focus on the content of the commodity to ""overlapping the commodity image with the character image"".

Gundam,36vmui,OhUmHmm,3,Fri May 22 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"I feel my biggest complaint across the whole metaseries is inconsistency in characters.  I don't have much time to write a full rant but basically when characters go from ""Whine time"" to ""I gotta be a man!  So should you!""  back to ""Whine time"".  I understand it's far cheaper to animate characters talking than battle scenes, but at least I want intrigue that builds, not just repeating dialogues that flop around on a table like an almost dead fish.  For example, Kamille runs after Four, then later chastizes Katz for running after Sarah, then later runs after Rosamie.  Every other episode of Zeta, 3 minutes is devoted to either praising a character for being mature, or (often in the next few episodes) talking about how childish a character is.  G-Reco is like a breath of fresh air in that regard.  Within the US, I would say I have complaints regarding accessibility.  The shows are often not available digitally (even for purchase) and DVDs have been long out of print.  Now, after 11 episodes of G-Reco on Gundam.Info, they suddenly blocked it without any communication with fans.  Really Sunrise and Bandai need to get their stuff worked out.  They're playing for very short gains on DVDs and licensing when the rest of the world has moved on to other ways of accessing content.  If I understand, most of the revenue still comes from Gunpla, I don't see why they have priced the advertisements for Gunpla so high."
Gundam,36vmui,ZeraX7,2,Fri May 22 15:31:12 2015 UTC,"The childish fanbase. They are all like ""Arrghh durr you faggot how you hate muh favorite gundamu, you have shit tastes arrrrgh"". Beside that, is Bandai way of releasing gunpla advertising shows and the recent lame AGE-ish animations and characters design which used in most of the recent Gundam shows."
Gundam,36vmui,PASTYFACE1X,2,Fri May 22 16:35:01 2015 UTC,The bitchy characters that claim they hate war as they're willingly climbing into the controls of a gigantic war machine. And the emotional stability of some of these war vets. Who the fuck cleared half of the pilots for duty when they have PTSD that makes the WW2 vets look like pussies.
Gundam,36vmui,sdwoodchuck,2,Fri May 22 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"There's plenty to complain about; just keep in mind that there's also plenty of good to balance it out.  You're right that Tomino has serious issues as a director.  I love him, I love his work, but we can be honest about his faults too.  Pacing is a problem for him in both directions.  I don't just think it's that he's given longer series than he can make work, either.  Certain series he's directed have no business being 50 episodes, and could easily be cut down.  Then you see his movies, and often it's too many characters, too many ideas to comfortably fit into the timeframe, and you wind up with a ton of plot threads that just kind of abruptly stop (I love CCA, but it's absolutely guilty of this).  I thought the 25-ish episode series would be perfect for him, but then G-Reco felt like it could have sustained that 50 episode series that he so rarely got just right.    It's not just pacing.  The things that make him such a unique director also work against him when he's at the bottom of his worst bouts with depression.  Characters being mortal absolutely adds dramatic tension, but when he's getting too stirred up and starts killing off characters in a way that seems exploitative of the audience more than building that dramatic tension, that's an issue.  The best example I can give of this is Victory Gundam--and just to make it clear that I'm not saying this to nitpick, Victory is easily in my top 5 pieces of Gundam; again I can acknowledge the shortcomings of the things I love."
Gundam,36vmui,acolyte_to_jippity,2,Sat May 23 02:25:36 2015 UTC,My complaint is how people get so pissed off when someone doesn't like a certain series.  Example: anyone who says they don't like the original MSG tends to be jumped upon as all sorts of an idiot.

I dunno, I really love a lot of the Gundam metaseries and sure each series has their issues but overall they're a lot of fun. I guess I'll put a few of my top personal issues with some of the various series.   Gundam AGE was too short, i might get crap for this but honestly considering the three generations i really felt that more of each arc needed to be expanded upon and the series would've really benefited from that G-Reco... like you said felt like someone was trying to force a square into a circular-hole, the series was just a bit of a mess overall and i'm not even sure how to fix it, also G-Self has got to have the thickest plot armor any Gundam I've ever seen (talking about the MS itself, not a character) GBF/GBFT where is my world tournament that they started mentioning at the end of the series, or a third season? or a sei and reji reunion? gimmeh NAO I can't believe I'm saying this but The Origin is probably the most boring Gundam series so far I've seen in my life (they're working on this) Re-releases of older Gundam series! The only series I've seen that's older than SeeD is G Gundam (which as it turns out is complete awesome sauce) GSD, why didn't shinn just die? i hate shinn and he seriously needs to die"

Gundam,36vmui,Beginning_Gunpla,1 point,Fri May 22 16:32:26 2015 UTC,I thought supposedly it was powerful because of how many photon batteries were embeded as part of its design and I don't remember it getting destroyed in the fight with Kabakali just damaged a lot but I guess I'd have to rewatch the last episode sometimes and in the rest of the fights it is in the G-Self always seems to lose its shield or take a flesh wound hit on the arm or leg and nothing that isn't completely repaired before the next fight the unit was never grounded for even a single fight in a 25 episode series that's kind of crazy when most main MS's are destroyed then upgraded or at the very least destroyed completely by the end of the series. G-Self only ever gets new backpacks... but as I said it's been a little while and I don't completely remember the last episode.

Ofc I like it, otherwise I wouldn't be a fan, but I would appreciate more diversity.  Also, for a show about robots exploring space, when I first started watching multiple series, I completely expected far more aliens as possible enemies/allies."

Build Fighters and Try are clearly leaning more towards Super Robot than Real Robot; most especially in Try considering it's deliberately designed to be a G Gundam Shout-Out as a whole.  If I were you, I'd stop trying to take Build Fighters and Try so seriously, especially since they don't even take themselves seriously whatsoever, and even make fun of themselves several times in both animes.  Spin-Off Series of Gundam can get away with going Super Robot since they're not meant to be taken seriously, and Build Fighters & Try are absolutely no different from this."

Gundam,36wex8,Bass294,1 point,Fri May 22 23:45:09 2015 UTC,I think most of the 'magic' can be attributed to the build burning being made by one of the best gunpla builders in the world. Of course it would tear through a suit that isn't as souped-up.
Gundam,36wex8,BoyGodz,1 point,Fri May 22 19:32:48 2015 UTC,But what dictates powers in the universe? Like a beam gun will look and act like a beam gun but what will a scratch built gun do or a clear inner frame? Will it have Psycoframe abilities or will it emit particles or will it make a flaming unicorn with lasers for eyes appear?  Because gunpla is freedom there's a whole lot of grey area :) Still a great show though
Gundam,36wex8,Bass294,1 point,Fri May 22 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"While most of it isn't explained in-universe, my headcanon of it is a relatively reasonable way of looking at it:  After you make any custom modifications to your gunpla, before they can be used in-system, they have to be programmed into the battle system (or GP base which would give it a solid role - containing data). A rifle can be set to whatever output you wish (the drawbacks to a higher output being more particle consumption and the potential for harmful recoil).  This easily explains how sekai gets away with a lot of bullshit on the build burning, sei programmed some pretty advanced moves into it like the omnislash, flame sword, and pheonix. How did sekai not know about this? Well we always see him using martial arts moves, so there never would be any reason to use the weapon select, so they only were used during assimilation (as any 'weapon-swapping' would come from assimilation magic)"
Gundam,36wex8,BoyGodz,1 point,Fri May 22 20:07:51 2015 UTC,"That amazing gunpla has been taken apart, has its parts broken down, snapped, shattered to pieces after multiple fights and evcentually fixed, put back together, created anew, but somehow the TBG is superior than the BBG even when only 1/3 is made by a decent builder, another 1/3 made by an ordinary middle-schooler and the rest by a kid with no prior experience."
Gundam,36wex8,Bass294,1 point,Fri May 22 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"The RG system, which would be the most likely cause for the particle shenanigans, is still in tact, as is the magic plavsky BS core unit. I don't think any remodling of the exterior would change that."
Gundam,36wex8,BoyGodz,0,Fri May 22 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"My point being, since BBG = best interior+exterior any gunpla builder as to offer, and TBG = the same interior with logically inferior exterior, then technically BBG should be capable to do everything TBG can, but yet BBG's arm broke after Sekai use the the phoenix skill and TBG can withstand it. How is it possible for the Try Fighter with obviously less building skills be able to ""upgrade"" the BBG when it is already perfect?"
Gundam,36wex8,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Fri May 22 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"Well it wasn't just sekai, it was yuuma too, who would have good enough knowledge to redo the exterior and add more sparkly bits to project the pheonix easier, which is the main point of the upgrade. nothing appeared to be too special about the exterior anyways, it wasn't some masterfully-layered plastic like the original build strike's shield, so its not that unreasonable for a relatively good builder to update the armor without a loss in preformance."
Gundam,36wex8,BoyGodz,-1,Fri May 22 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"it was yuuma too   But Yuuma isn't as good as Sei in terms of building skills, and even if he is, he would have to be even better than Sei to even out the lack of building skills of his teammate to match TBG with BBG.    nothing appeared to be too special about the exterior anyways   I don't think you have build a customized gunpla before. It is way, way harder to make small modification than it is to completely build from scatch. Just at how few BBG>TBG customization there is in real life, almost none because the difficulty (those clear blue crystal is a pain to make and it's not worth effort to change the armor to fit those crystal)    so its not that unreasonable for a relatively good builder to update the armor without a loss in preformance.   Even if we assume Yuuma and Co has the ability to make same level armor as Sei, the question remains. How do Middle school come up with improvement plans for something that is built by a world champion? Unless Sei couldn't be asked to make the BBG 100% otherwise why would he leave room for improvement obvious enough for people who are yet to be world level to spot so easily? Bare in mind the BBG is built for Reiji in case he return and he can  use it to battle it out with Sei, then the BBG should be world class  if Sei looks to fight Reiji on even ground, at least at the time of its birth. Doesn't matter if Yuuma has 90/100 for building skills, he is up against someone with at least the same level as him if not way higher, but yet Try Fighter made an improvement on the 100% BBG."
Gundam,36wex8,NitroTypat,1 point,Fri May 22 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm just going to point out one thing. Wasn't Sei a middle school kid when he won the the GBWC? Hrmmmm.  Also...The BBG was built for Reiji, not Sei, and not Sekai. One of the main points of the show was that Gunpla are built for one person, and they have to synergize. So they tweaked BBG to fit Sekai's style.   I love how everyone who makes this argument also skips over the fact that Yuuma is Sei's Brother in law and learned to build from Sei himself as he grew up. Even at his age he is considered one of the best builders in Japan."

Even at his age he is considered one of the best builders in Japan.   Yuuma isn't world class yet possibly until the last episode (And I am ready for them to dig this plot hole even deeper with OVAs), because Lightning itself is said to be less ""complete"" than BBG reference to Sakai's comment when he first inspected TF's match, questioning how Sekai manage to obtain a gunpla that is way out of himself and Yuuma's league. My point is about character suddenly demand ability when plot requires it and the writing put very little effort in trying to cover it, better writing would take you ""personalized"" points and justify this part, but instead they didn't do much explaining."

He is only making modifications, not making the most complex part of the Burning - the RG system. And he doesn't need to have a higher skill level, it doesn't 'even out'. He would have given Sekai the tasks he could handle at his skill level, while doing the advanced things himself.   I don't think you have build a customized gunpla before. It is way, way harder to make small modification than it is to completely build from scatch.   I actually do make gunpla and customize them heavily, it's a lot harder to build parts from scratch than it is to modify an existing design. What would be harder to you, cutting a hole in armor and putting in a clear part or building a whole leg from scratch?   How do Middle school come up with improvement plans for something that is built by a world champion?   This is one of the main premises of try, just like junya took the cathedral Gundam and modified it to fit his fighting style, the try fighters  modified the BBG to Sekai's new abilities with assimilation and the Phoenix attack. How do they do that? Well the BBG broke from the strain of the attack, so a logical solution would be to add more areas for the RG system to emit particles from (clear parts).  Now I completely agree that they show the upgrades being done in a very short amount of time, and the changes they made would take easily a week to complete. But what happens in the show is very plausible given the circumstances."
Gundam,36wex8,BoyGodz,-1,Sat May 23 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"I actually do make gunpla and customize them heavily, it's a lot harder to build parts from scratch than it is to modify an existing design. What would be harder to you, cutting a hole in armor and putting in a clear part or building a whole leg from scratch?   Erm......Yes, building from scratch would be way, way easier. More to the point, it would be close to impossible to do what the protagonist did, taking apart an already built parts and modify it. Gunpla isn't made of paper, you cannot just cut open an arm that is already modified, glued and painted, even if you do you risk stressing and weakening the plastic to the point you can't put it back together. Not to mention we have close to no ways to manufacture shaped clear parts since they can't be sanded or glued.  Just go and buy a BBG kit, build it to what ever level of completion you are capable of, and then take it apart to customized it into the TBG with the same level of completion. And you will see how making small mods is way harder then making large mod.   He is only making modifications, not making the most complex part of the Burning - the RG system.   Yuuma created the Burning Burst system.... It's called a ""system"" so I am guessing it is more than just the armor he is changing. He straight up invented a system that best the WC's gunpla.   This is one of the main premises of try, just like junya took the cathedral Gundam and modified it to fit his fighting style, the try fighters modified the BBG to Sekai's new abilities with assimilation and the Phoenix attack. How do they do that? Well the BBG broke from the strain of the attack, so a logical solution would be to add more areas for the RG system to emit particles from (clear parts).   Which doesn't make sense. Denial gundam is probably inferior to the Cathedral gundam so it doesn't make it a plot hole, but we are having an A grade smith making modification to S grade sword and somehow make the sword S+grade, whereas the smith's own sword (Lightning) is A grade at best."
Gundam,36wex8,SkylordAndy,1 point,Sat May 23 05:24:53 2015 UTC,"Erm......Yes, building from scratch would be way, way easier.   If this was true we'd see quite a lot more full-scratch customs, but the majority out there are modifications on existing designs. There is simply no way building new pieces from styrene plate would be easier than cutting/sanding/puttying existing parts.   it would be close to impossible to do what the protagonist did, taking apart an already built parts and modify it.   This would be true if the pieces were fully glued together, however its shown multiple times both in the building montage and Sei's delivery of replacement parts that the BBG has an inner frame with detachable armor. The modifications would be as simple as cutting the armor, putting the clear pieces in place, then sanding and repainting the new parts (while not simple to an average modeler, it would be to someone who has been working with similar kits for years, who's regarded as one of the best builders in japan).   we have close to no ways to manufacture shaped clear parts since they can't be sanded or glued.   This just isn't true. You can resin cast clear parts, they can be sanded as long as they are polished afterwards (with very fine sandpaper and wet sanding) and the glue wouldn't be required as it could be snapped together with the gunpla (although glue works on them just fine).  They weren't all necessarily made from scratch either, they show that some clear parts were hidden under the armor.   Yuuma created the Burning Burst system   He didn't 'create' the system. It was always there, but was only given a name in the final fight. The modifications only enhanced the RG system that was already present by adding and exposing more of the clear parts to increase the particle emission rate.   we are having an A grade smith making modification to S grade sword and somehow make the sword S+grade   I don't think this is an appropriate analogy. It would be more akin to having a magic long sword while you specialize in short swords. Shortening the sword may make it weaker at a glance, but it still doesn't lose any of its special properties, and it can be used much more effectively by its bearer."
Gundam,36wex8,Primalfang,-1,Sat May 23 06:19:54 2015 UTC,"If this was true we'd see quite a lot more full-scratch customs, but the majority out there are modifications on existing designs. There is simply no way building new pieces from styrene plate would be easier than cutting/sanding/puttying existing parts.   Oh, that's not what I meant when I said ""from scatch"", I meant it in terms of starting the modification on a unmodified part, like say instead of making the TBG out of BBG, it would just be easier to make it out whatever kit it was based on if it had any.   This would be true if the pieces were fully glued together, however its shown multiple times both in the building montage and Sei's delivery of replacement parts that the BBG has an inner frame with detachable armor. The modifications would be as simple as cutting the armor, putting the clear pieces in place, then sanding and repainting the new parts (while not simple to an average modeler, it would be to someone who has been working with similar kits for years, who's regarded as one of the best builders in japan).   I don't think you can put the gunpla into fight without gluing. Remember in the first episode of GBF, Sei's gunpla arm came off because it is in the test assembly process, i.e. not glued together yet.   And it is a different case for the replacement parts, I mean why would anyone glue together the replacement parts if the parts would be used separately?    This just isn't true. You can resin cast clear parts, they can be sanded as long as they are polished afterwards (with very fine sandpaper and wet sanding) and the glue wouldn't be required as it could be snapped together with the gunpla (although glue works on them just fine).   Sure, and have you seen any of those in the anime?   He didn't 'create' the system. It was always there, but was only given a name in the final fight. The modifications only enhanced the RG system that was already present by adding and exposing more of the clear parts to increase the particle emission rate.   Erm. No, it is not  ""Burning Burst System. Design by Yuuma Kousaka, the Burning Burst System is used during assimilation. This system allows Try Burning to purge parts of its external armor on the clavicles, shoulders, forearms, side skirts and lower legs, revealing the transparent parts hidden beneath. The purging of parts allows for the smooth release of the Plavsky Particles stored in the transparent parts, and thus helps to maximize Try Burning's Plavsky Particle emission.""  And just to carry to my next point, the only improvement TBG has over BBG is Plavsky Particle emission, which isn't a stat that can be ""personalized"", it is just a stat that is best to have more, like clock speed for CPU. Unless Yuuma is a better builder than Sei and hence he can make gunpla with higher Plavsky Particle emission, otherwise how is it possible for Yuuma to create a gunpla that has higher emission than the RG system creator Sei?   I don't think this is an appropriate analogy. It would be more akin to having a magic long sword while you specialize in short swords. Shortening the sword may make it weaker at a glance, but it still doesn't lose any of its special properties, and it can be used much more effectively by its bearer.   First of all, from the last point it is established this analogy isn't the case, there is no real ""personalisation"" happening here. It is not like the BBG was a long range heavy weapon type that Sekai is no good at, it was a close range melee combat unit just like TBG.  Essentially, it is a magic long sword made of special metal, and it melted down and reforged into another magic long sword; logically even if it still obtain the same magical property from the special metal, it now has a significantly less sharp edge, since the smith that reforged it isn't the world best anymore; but instead of that happening, the new sword is somehow sharper than before, which doesn't make any sense.  Either way, it is pointless to talk on empty grounds. Get a BBG and try making a semi decently looking TBG, and you would get what I am saying."

Instead it looks choppier than it did at the height of hand drawn animation, but the lines are too crisp and everything is too shiny. Too flat, but too shiny. It looks less realistic in some way I can't quite put my finger on.  Of course, it also looks less realistic in ways that are easy to put your finger on.

A little bit of the classic teenage angst you would expect, some humor, overall easy to watch.  00: 4 Gundam Pilots who have been selected and trained for their jobs by the super computer Veda possessed by the secret organization known as Celestial Being are sent on missions to end war amongst the human population. Cut back on the whining, it features genuinely interesting characters with many different faces (no joke with Allelujah)   Wing: Space Colonies 00: Orbital Elevator, satellite colonies  Wing: The protagonists' Mobile Suits are nearly indestructable, being made of a rare element called ""Gundanium"" (right?) they can only be made in space 00: Protagonists' MS are virtually untouchable until one of the main antagonists Ali Al-Sachez comes along and fucks up Setsuna's day. The Mobile Suits in 00 are detailed almost 100% more in this anime than they are in Wing. By that I mean they give you ""Fluff"" science and reasons for why it works and how it works.  The overall goals of both organizations are completely different, Operation Meteor (from Wing) was much more of a shit storm than Celestial Beings armed interventions, and I believe Wing (although it didn't show it) based its action seens on more indescriminate killings of drone soldiers and Leo's/Cancers/Piscies/ect than 00 which did a little of that too, but towards the mid/latter half of season one and most of season 2 it focused on individual conflict rather than the armed interventions.   Overall I saw a lot more dueling in 00 than in Wing, which I liked. And the animation in 00 is fresh and sexy new, which I also liked. But Wing had a nostalgic/playful style to it that made it very unique and enjoyable.   Overall these are my two favorite full blooded series."

""Puru"" is the japanese pronunciation of the end of the word ""People"" (essentially pee-pu-ru), and since that segment of the word was used as her name, you hear ""Puru"" rather than ""Ple.""

Wing Zero is not impractical at all. Kira Yamato & Lacus Clyne are such well-written characters. I like Flay Alster. AGE is amazing. Tomino is a misogynistic old fuck who doesn't know what he's talking about. Build Fighters ruined Gundam forever. SEED's Recycled Stock Footage is barely noticeable. Fukuda and Morosawa did nothing wrong. Turn A Gundam is fucking ugly. The 00 Movie completely redeemed everything Season 2 did wrong. G-Saviour is not that bad. Strike Freedom is Best Gundam. Ramba Ral's Blue Zaku is really cool. Kamille? Isn't that a Girl's Name? Master Asia's a fucking scrub. Gundam is such a Transformers Rip-Off. Zeta Gundam was garbage. I refuse to watch 0079, Zeta, ZZ, or CCA because the animation is old. Shinn Asuka didn't get derailed at all. G Gundam was a fucking joke.   And believe me, I can go on and on with this shit.

Gundam,36tmtw,Lighthalzen,6,Fri May 22 06:06:32 2015 UTC,I'd say 00 simply because I hate how Seed character's look. Also Seed has tons of plot armor.
Gundam,36tmtw,Thezombieman,2,Fri May 22 02:26:03 2015 UTC,You mean Phase Plot Armor AKA Plot Shift Armor of our lord and saviour?
Gundam,36tmtw,NageQsad,2,Fri May 22 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest here... 00 has quite a bit of plot armor too, albeit not quite as much as SEED."
Gundam,36tmtw,Diamo1,2,Fri May 22 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"Every single movie/manga/anime/novel etc have somekind of plot armor, the difference is their thickness. Have you seen LoTR, goddamn eagles man. But in Seed and Destiny, Jesus literally came back to life 3 times."
Gundam,36tmtw,NageQsad,2,Fri May 22 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"00 has some pretty crazy shit though. like-OP Don't read this, it's a 00 spoiler- When Trans-AM is convieniently unlocked just in time to bail Setsuna's ass out of the fire and allow him to beat whoever he was fighting, I think it was one of the Thrones. 00 has lots of convieniently placed power-ups that come out of nowhere, and that's not quite as bad as Jesus Yamato coming back to life twice, but it's still pretty bad.   I adore both SEED and 00 regardless, however. Plot armor doesn't bother me all that much."
Gundam,36tmtw,Diamo1,2,Fri May 22 03:13:01 2015 UTC,I guess 00 first but idk what's with the hate on seed. I actually really enjoyed seed/destiny but i just never got around to finishing it because it was so long.
Gundam,36tmtw,godofwar7018,2,Fri May 22 08:58:35 2015 UTC,"Flip a coin, both are worth a watch but i enjoyed 00 much more than i did with seed."
Gundam,36tmtw,OranosSonaro,2,Fri May 22 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"Seed's characters are more bullshit, and has more characters that really have zero redeeming qualities.  Seed's music is also better.  00's plotline is much less grating in some ways.  Its not the same suit getting attached by the same few suits and winning, time and time again.  00 has actual political conflict in it, instead of the standard ""Earth vs Space while Neutral watches"" trope.  The scale of 00 is bigger, imo, even though its much more earth-based or near-earth-orbit based.  Both shows have incredible animation.  Seed's fights tend to be more impressive with one-on-one (or one-on-several, see complaint above about most fights being the same) encounters.  But 00 is WAY better when it comes to larger scale actions.  I would say that they're both entertaining enough to be worth watching.  I watched Seed first, I believe, but it shouldn't really matter.  I will actually echo another response's suggestion of alternating.  One ep of SEED, one ep of 00.    One thing to note, though.  SEED's character development is pretty much non-existent (well, outside of Mu, and one other exception...).  If you meet a character and form an opinion about them, that's basically who they are for the entire show.  Kira doesn't change.  Sai doesn't change.  Ramius doesn't change.  None of them change.  At all.  The entire show."
Gundam,36tmtw,acolyte_to_jippity,2,Sat May 23 22:57:15 2015 UTC,Either one OP. Both take place in seperate universes from each other and other Gundam shows.
Gundam,36tmtw,xXKILLA_D21Xx,4,Fri May 22 01:08:40 2015 UTC,"I love both for different reasons. 00 is what Wing could have been if the ideologies had been more fleshed out. Also Setsuna feels more real than Heero. I love the 00 Gundam and Arios/Kyrios/Harute especially.   SEED is a bit different. It has a lot of mistakes with super plot armor and things, but I like the take it spun on the UC plot. The reimagined Zakus as ZAFT mobile suits was amazing. Destiny never happened for me tho :P  If you like well choreographed fights with layers to the strategy, go for 00. If you prefer a bit more dialogue (as 00 has the dialogues to come) and the main character being perfect? go with Seed. Both are fun rides."

Gundam,36tmtw,Irrel_M,1 point,Sat May 23 18:58:27 2015 UTC,00.  What the second season does will piss you off less than what Destiny does with Mu. And you'll get the assault on Memento Mori.  And Gundaminfo has 00 up for now. It goes up and down every so often.

Gundam,36tmtw,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Fri May 22 14:07:29 2015 UTC,They do for Seed Destiny and maybe the remaster of Seed.   They used to have Zeta and Double Zeta too but that's more rare.
Gundam,36tmtw,sunsk,0,Sat May 23 05:00:53 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Seed over 00:  The universe is better; The characters in Seed are better (With some exceptions) Seed has better music. 00 drags on, and the second season with ribbons was :/ 00 is blatantly inspired by the Iraq war, and it shows. 00s villian was meh.  The pros of 00 It has nicer graphics (well not so much anymore, sincee seed is remastered) It has a less whiny dub cast. More intresting Mech designs imo.  As for Destiny......  Well it's worth watching only for three reasons The Chairman. The music And, how to completely fuck up a series halfway through.  So in summary  Seed>00>Seed Destiny."

I'd suggest SEED first because it is ""more dated"" than 00 in a couple of ways and despite how certain mindsets think, eventually things lose out after aging for a period of time... and some things just age horribly.  Luckily SEED is not one of those things, but it is still better safe than sorry on that. Watch SEED first."

To him, Gundam is an indomitable hero of justice, morality, and fairness, a superhero with the power to change the twisted world. Having lost his faith in what he thought was God, he believes in Gundam instead. Piloting a Gundam and participating in Celestial Being is his catharsis from his former life. He realizes he was raised to be a weapon of war and has few other talents available to him besides fighting. While he accepts his acts of violence are inexcusable and regrettable, Setsuna is motivated by his will to continue fighting for a better future of true understanding and peace. Though normally a stoic soldier dedicated to the mission, Setsuna can rashly crash through his facade of professionalism if someone bombards his set of beliefs.

Gundam,36tvrs,takeprideinsin,9,Fri May 22 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd recommend diving into the original Mobile Suit Gundam. The animation is rather dated, but if you can stomach it it's one of the best series of the lot by far. There are three compilation movies that were made of the original as well, and those are pretty sweet.  0083 Stardust Memory and 0080 War in the Pocket are AMAZING. They're OVAs too, which means you can blast through them pretty quick, and lead into Zeta Gundam, which is also great.  Honestly, I'd say just watch whatever you want. This guide is really good for, well, everything. Not made by me though!"
Gundam,36tvrs,AwakenMyMasters,-4,Fri May 22 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"no.  original mobile suit gundam is garbage.  yes, it'a a classic, but it's still a garbage.  read the Origin.  I repeat, READ THE ORIGIN."
Gundam,36tvrs,SpaceKujo,5,Fri May 22 22:37:33 2015 UTC,"The original Mobile Suit Gundam is the closest there is to an ""essential"" piece, but I'll go ahead and suggest you watch the movie trilogy version of it rather than the series.  After that, Zeta is the definite runner-up, and this one definitely do the series rather than the movies.  If these two catch your interest, continuing on through the rest of the Universal Century timeline will likely be a good trip.  As for alternate Universe series, G Gundam is probably the most widely loved for being something truly unique within Gundam.    I personally love Turn A, though a lot of folks seem to struggle with it, so while I won't say it's essential, I do highly recommend it.  And I think we can put Build Fighters right up there with the ""essentials"" now as well.  It's Gundam being self-referential in the best way, celebrating fans of all ages, of all types, and even the fans whose kids have gone on to become fans as well.  It's basically the Gundam franchise acknowledging the fans that love it, and saying ""we love you guys too."""
Gundam,36tvrs,sdwoodchuck,3,Fri May 22 04:31:59 2015 UTC,"Wing is in the After Colony Timeline. F91 is Universal Century, but far enough ahead that it's detached from any of the earlier works.  If you want to get into UC, start with the original series in either series or movie form. I recommend the series, since the characters are so damn memorable and imitated in later installments of the franchise."
Gundam,36tvrs,Char_X_3,3,Fri May 22 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"Essential? If you liked Wing a lot I guess I'd call 00 an essential series since it's closely related to Wing in theme and just overall a great series. Definitely the original MS Gundam if you can find it since it sets up the entire Universal Century time-line. After that... maybe Unicorn because it's essentially an end cap to Universal Century (the last Gundam series to place in the UC timeline... i think, not sure how F91 fits in)  Oh, and Gundam Build Fighters, really just because it is a lot of fun! :D"
Gundam,36tvrs,Beginning_Gunpla,3,Fri May 22 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"Zeta and 00 imo are really quality series.  00 is it's own story. Don't need to watch something else to appreciate, just watch it asap.  Zeta is the sequel to the Original Mobile Suit Gundam. Imo it's not required, you will understand what's going on, although you will appreciate it more if you watch MSG. Depends on how invested you want to get.  Edit: at -3 and no replies. I assume saying MSG isn't mandatory is blasphemy :^]"

So, I have basically no problem when that potential is flexed.   But I can see why people would have a problem when they use newtype abilities to handwave the characters out of impossible situations.  Having newtypes or not does not make one Gundam series better than another. It's what the writers choose to do with the abilities of the characters that sets shows apart."

Gundam,36kbds,OmegaSeven,30,Wed May 20 11:47:43 2015 UTC,"I am part of the crowd you describe and will try to offer some insight, even though I realize it was mostly an offmychest/rant deal.  Gundam is hard for those who like ""hard scifi"" because it comes so close.  90% or more of the older series are very believable.    Sure, there are issues with mobile suits and weight, but I can believe it might happen.  This is sometimes called the ""suspension of disbelief"" and is arguably needed for all fiction.  Even though both are false, a story that is believable is more engaging than an unbelievable one.  What is believable is highly subjective.  I am willing to suspend disbelief over telepathy and improved reaction times.  It's not my favorite element of gundam but Amuro doesn't ruin the series for me.  But Kamille blocking laser blasts with his mind?  I have to create secondary explanations -- ""oh, maybe the animation shows it from one incorrect perspective, and Kamille is not actually blocking laser blasts but projects his image in the attackers mind'  or ""oh maybe he is using his brain and lightning reflexes to find reflecting points for every shot"".  But all of that takes me out of the moment, out of the story.  Just as if suddenly ""newtype powers"" meant Kamille could bring people back from the dead.  It also makes stories harder to anticipate or predict.  Both of these can build excitement.  Luke has some force powers, but george lucas used jedi masters to show you the limits of those powers.  Ben Kenobi fooled an easy mind and cut off an arm with a light saber.  Darth vader choked a man.  Yoda lifted out an Xwing and had some ability to predict the future.  You knew that even if Luke trained his whole life, he can't use the force to suddenly blow up the deathstar three planets away just using his mind.  Newtypes have very few such rules.  There doesn't seem be any consistency or logic that they follow.  Sometimes they are invincible, sometimed not.  It's just a random series of events, which does not make for an interesting story.  Regarding why we don't watch other shows -- I do.  Indeed, in many ways I prefer the Legend of Galactic Heroes to Gundam.  However, there are fewer ways to enjoy that series, it doesn't have many games or mangas, very few models.    In short, Gundam was the most popular originator of the real robot genre.  There are a ton of DBZ with mecha series, but not that many real robot ones.  Unfortunately Gundam has largely strayed toward DBZ territory, I wouldn't even call many of the series ""real robot"" genre."
Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,7,Wed May 20 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"Most newtype abilities (big beam saber, deflecting lasers) are not from the pilot alone but from technology of the mobile suit. Camile would not reflect a laser with Nemo he would just die.The zeta is equipped with a Bio-sensor which pretty much manifest newtype abilities to a tangible level. Amuro's Gundam did not even have any kind of psycommu system, all the gundam gave to him is the best mobile suit his newtype abilities can exploit. All newtype magic is tied to technology other than Judo, guy was a space wizard.   I for one like newtypes, limited technology like zeta and original gundam work best for it. Unicorn is just a tad bit too much and char's counter attack is the limit for me. I do like how it scaled back in late UC with newtype powers never going Judo level and technology pushing to extremes."
Gundam,36kbds,UltraChingon,1 point,Wed May 20 16:44:55 2015 UTC,I rationalized the bio-sensor as kicking the nuclear reactor into overdrive- not space magic.
Gundam,36kbds,destructoid17,1 point,Wed May 20 21:55:25 2015 UTC,"Most newtype abilities (big beam saber, deflecting lasers) are not from the pilot alone but from technology of the mobile suit. Camile would not reflect a laser with Nemo he would just die.The zeta is equipped with a Bio-sensor which pretty much manifest newtype abilities to a tangible level.    I understand and can mostly believe the idea of ""Psycommu waves"" controlling Funnels.  (Though I also think funnels themselves are very inconsistent.  Why can a laser as small as a beam saber tear through enemy MS armors?  Why can they be controlled remotely despite Minovsky interference?)  But Psycommu waves blocking laser beams doesn't make any sense to me.  You can say it brings the abilities to ""a tangible level"", but that's too vague for me to believe.  Either the suit has some kind of beam repellent that everyone in theory could use by pressing a button, or it doesn't.  I'm not willing to suspend disbelief over a human mind reflecting a laser beam out of willpower.  The fact that Camile never used the technology before, nor was it specifically mentioned, suggests to me that it was not a known property of the suit.  Thus, Camile basically improved the suit's ""technology"" with his mind.  That's still newtype magic to me.  But, perhaps I am nitpicking -- it seems we mostly agree.  Specifically, I have no issue with Amuro's Gundam in 0079.  Even Amuro in Zeta I have no complaints with, and most of Zeta is also likewise fine.  (Within UC timeline I've seen, really only Amuro in CCA and Kamille in the ending of Zeta.)  I haven't seen ZZ yet but agree Unicorn has it being a tad too much at times, but I recently got Turn A dvds -- hoping it's scaled back like you mentioned."
Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,10,Fri May 22 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Gundam has always used newtypes and other ""space magic"" phenomena to show the continued evolution of mankind to adapt to the vastness of space.  Its a  staple of the series, really.  The only series that I can remember that didn't have newtypes (or similar equivalents) are 0080, 8th MS Team, and 0083 (and maybe Wing).  I don't know how you can say Gundam strayed from what it was when it has always used the psychic space ubermensch trope."
Gundam,36kbds,LightningEagle7,7,Wed May 20 11:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yes but Amuro is a different breed of newtype than later ones.  He doesnt use mental ki to block lasers. He doesn't use mental ki to suddenly extend his saber.  I do not inherrently hate all newtypes, e.g. mirai is somewhat believable as well.    Perhaps the problem is that the label itself means nothing.  What is a newtype?  There is no consistent definition, as the mental powers change accross and within series.  Sometimes Reccoa can save an entire ship from annihilation due to prescience, sometimes she gets shot down.  Whether a character has a ""flash of Insight"" is not governed by any rules.  8th ms team is a great example -- rather than rely on flashes of insight, the battles rely on tactics.  The fights are mostly coreographed to make sense.  You go in knowing who is at a disadvantage; you see traps suceed and fail to varying extents.  You can follow the characters.  That ability is lost when it comes to stronger newtypes.  For example, you would probably say newtypes can't raise the dead... until they do.  Then suddenly that is a new power of newtypes.  There is no way to predict what newtypes can or cannot do."
Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,8,Wed May 20 12:34:31 2015 UTC,"But Amuro does have crazy psychic visions in space and later has the ability to deflect an entire asteroid with human will alone.  But yeah, I agree with you're second assertion.  We just get this nebulous label called newtype, but what is that exactly?  It's not clearly defined, and there are inconsistencies with their power.  But, thats the beauty of Gundam.  Most of Tomino's work in UC attempts to answer this question, and the answer evolves the further into the time line you go.  At first, newtype is equivalent to ace mobile suit pilot.  Then in Zeta and beyond, its used to describe people with ethereal powers.  It's not until the later parts of the UC that we perhaps get a true answer.  In F91, Seabook states that maybe newtypes are people who understand somethings true essence.  That would imply that these powers used by newtypes like Kamille and Amuro and Banagher are actually the true power of their mobile suits, only capable of being used by someone who truly comprehends the machine's use.  TL:DR Maybe its not Newtypes who have super powers, but the machines.  And only newtypes can unlock them."
Gundam,36kbds,LightningEagle7,0,Wed May 20 13:36:40 2015 UTC,"But Amuro does have crazy psychic visions in space and later has the ability to deflect an entire asteroid with human will alone.    Oh sorry, you are absolutely right regarding the asteroid deflection, I was thinking of Amuro in MSG / Zeta.  It's true he has psychic visions, but that I'm willing to buy -- kind of like Dune or the force.  I can understand limited telepathy and its powers are reasonably well defined.  On the other hand, CCA was slightly ruined for me due to that, but at least I can try to explain it as ""Oh it wasn't just Amuro's MS, but the combination of all of those MS.""   It's not clearly defined, and there are inconsistencies with their power. But, thats the beauty of Gundam. Most of Tomino's work in UC attempts to answer this question, and the answer evolves the further into the time line you go.   That's a nice way of looking at it.  Without trying to critique or diminish your interest in the question, I guess that question is of not interest to me.  Regarding Gundam, I like the mecha and the morally ambiguous military organizations.  Newtype powers tend to make suit differences mostly cosmetic.  I get that, if newtype powers were real, those suit differences would be swamped by the newtype powers -- but it takes away from the more interesting part (to me) of how different mecha under different scenarios might be under or over powered.  Or how the roll out of certain mass produced mobile suits can change the tide of a war.  I know on some level, there's not that much difference between a shield and new type power -- either can be used to block an attack at random depending on how writers want the plot to go, but on the other hand, I don't expect a shield to do much else than to be a shield.  The question ""What is a Newtype?"" just feels like it's too open ended to me.  There are too many possible directions for it to go in for me to enjoy pondering it.  It reminds me a little of the movie ""Lucy"" if you have seen that (though I enjoyed that visually, it suffers from a similar problem).  Regarding the tl;dr -- It's an interesting idea, and certainly some of the machines seem to enhance the super powers; but I also would classify that as ""super robot"" genre as I don't generally expect machines to have super powers."
Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,2,Wed May 20 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"Whether a character has a ""flash of Insight"" is not governed by any rules.   It's governed by the rule that humans are not perfect, they're flawed. ""Even Newtypes aren't supermen"" or whatever the quote from First Gundam was. It's exactly as arbitrary as whether or not their shots miss or connect. If you're playing a fighting game, just like even if you're really good you can't perfectly predict your opponent's moves all the time, Newtypes don't have a perfect understanding of the universe/human mind. Your senses aren't definitive things, and that extends to Newtype senses.   8th ms team is a great example -- rather than rely on flashes of insight, the battles rely on tactics. The fights are mostly coreographed to make sense. You go in knowing who is at a disadvantage; you see traps suceed and fail to varying extents. You can follow the characters. That ability is lost when it comes to stronger newtypes.  For example, you would probably say newtypes can't raise the dead... until they do. Then suddenly that is a new power of newtypes. There is no way to predict what newtypes can or cannot do.   The problem with this argument is that it basically implies that Newtype miracles are constantly interfering with battles when that more or less only happened in the finale of Zeta. (Maybe the ZZ tanked a shot once too, I can't remember.) Some miracles certainly happen like in CCA/UC but those more or less happened after all fighting was over. You're kind of making it out to be a much bigger deal than it really is."
Gundam,36kbds,starcolored,0,Wed May 20 17:59:01 2015 UTC,"Some miracles certainly happen like in CCA/UC but those more or less happened after all fighting was over.    It happens in Unicorn (that may be what you meant by UC) but I agree, many of the UC series have not been fully infected.  MS Igloo, 08th MS Team, the Original, 0083, and parts of Zeta have very limited newtype powers coming into play -- that's something I'm fine with.  On the other hand, the fact that it occurs in the finale of Zeta, rather than some one-off that is later retconned, is important -- that is, in may respects, the end of Kamille's story and something I spent ~50 episodes to get to.  That it becomes space fantasy in the last few, after 45 episodes of being mostly grounded in science fiction, is kind of insulting to the audience.  But I also understand, it's still a minority of the series.  I have been purposefully avoiding the more ""Newtype-heavy"" series, and don't remember much of Seed / Destiny; but as I am now running out of material, I may start watching some of the later series and hopefully I can come back with more specific examples besides the finale of Zeta.   You're kind of making it out to be a much bigger deal than it really is.   In my defense, I was replying to a poster who is complaining about people complaining about Newtypes."
Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,1 point,Fri May 22 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that Zeta is guilty of it. I'm just saying it's in the vast minority of series and Newtypes aren't like constantly going around doing that kind of stuff. Also yeah, UC is an abbreviation for Unicorn, albeit one that sometimes leads to confusion.   I have been purposefully avoiding the more ""Newtype-heavy"" series, and don't remember much of Seed / Destiny; but as I am now running out of material, I may start watching some of the later series and hopefully I can come back with more specific examples besides the finale of Zeta.   Honestly the exploration of the Newtype concept was pretty central to 0079 and Zeta but everything that comes after doesn't really focus on it much at all except Unicorn towards the end. There really aren't many instances where crazy Newtype phenomena actually impact battles."
Gundam,36kbds,starcolored,1 point,Fri May 22 17:56:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, I just finished Unicorn this moment (I had only made it up to episode 6) and needless to say, was personally pretty disappointed.    It's true that it's technically a minority of the series, and even with in the shows they keep it toward the end, but Zeta, CCA, and now Unicorn endings seem to all heavily rely on ""deus ex Newtype"".  From what I hear, ZZ might do something similar.  I agree that this isn't as bad as an entire series composed of it, but at least then I would know to avoid it.  Compared to CCA / Unicorn / Zeta, do you know how much Victory Gundam relies on Newtypes?"
Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,1 point,Fri May 22 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"Unicorn is by far the most over the top in its depiction of Newtype capabilities and utterly surpasses everything that came before it probably combined, but, going off topic a bit, funnily enough despite how crazy it is it I found that it actually makes the less-understood Newtype abilities more easy to accept in terms of realism because it forced me to think more about how it might be possible instead of just writing off stuff like the CCA ending as a crazy miracle like I did before it. Unicorn does also go out of its way to explain these abilities and more clearly define what a Newtype is and can do (though at a glance it may seem like it's the opposite), so while on one hand it's totally fucking crazy I came to appreciate it a lot for contributing to U.C. without fucking it all up.  I think the point all along was to emphasize human potential and possibility, which is why in the trilogy of the original, Zeta, and CCA, it always ended with a miracle born of human will. What you see as deus ex Newtype I feel was an intentional theme that Tomino always went out of his way to emphasize. After I read the novelization of MSG I believe it's just as central to early Gundam as the ""real robot"" concept in Tomino's eyes (on a side note I think Fukui, Unicorn's author, understood Tomino's intent very well. Marida's death was pretty much identical to a scene from the 0079 novels.) and I think to deny that is to deny a large part of Gundam itself. So I mean, I understand if it personally bothers you, but I think you've gotta look at it from a different angle instead of wanting it to be something it's not.   Compared to CCA / Unicorn / Zeta, do you know how much Victory Gundam relies on Newtypes?   Very little. Newtypes don't do much besides just fight outside of 0079, Zeta, CCA, and Unicorn."

Gundam,36kbds,LightningEagle7,2,Wed May 20 11:49:13 2015 UTC,The Zeon orphans in the last episode for sure and Aina Sahalin is most likely also a newtype or at least an early cyber-newtype from context (she was a test pilot for an incredibly powerful single-seat mobile armor late in the OYW). Shiro Amada probably isn't an actual newtype but he is a hard to control spacenoid ace pilot so the feddies probably just assumed he was one.

Gundam,36kbds,RJWalker,1 point,Wed May 20 08:04:22 2015 UTC,"Agree and disagree here. I am mainly only referring to 0079 , and Zeta here.  Agree in the way that you said ""what is believable is highly subjective"" , hence why this show is called a science fiction.   Disagree that Gundam has strayed toward DBZ territory IF you are specifically talking about 0079 and zeta. They have a believable background reasoning as to why they powered up more so than DBZ.  I don't know about you, but I grew up watching a lot of super robot show like Voltus V, God Sigma, Golion, etc and from super robot shows mindset audience , a show like Gundam is highly believable.   I don't understand what makes Newtype is complicated. They are basically like exaggerated version of Empath.  http://themindunleashed.org/2013/10/30-traits-of-empath.html  Here's the quote:   Being an empath is when you are affected by other people’s energies, and have an innate ability to intuitively feel and perceive others.  Your life is unconsciously influenced by others’ desires, wishes, thoughts, and moods.  Being an empath is much more than being highly sensitive and it’s not just limited to emotions.  Empaths can perceive physical sensitivities and spiritual urges, as well as just knowing the motivations and intentions of other people.  You either are an empath or you aren’t.  It’s not a trait that is learned.  You are always open, so to speak, to process other people’s feelings and energy, which means that you really feel, and in many cases take on the emotions of others.  Many empaths experience things like chronic fatigue, environmental sensitivities, or unexplained aches and pains daily.  These are all things that are more likely to be contributed to outside influences and not so much yourself at all.  Essentially you are walking around in this world with all of the accumulated karma, emotions, and energy from others.   From what I understand that what mostly Kamille experienced the whole time more than Amuro. People complaining how Kamille can speak to the dead people and use their powers to kick Scirocco's ass. No shit, why not? Amuro himself (in zeta) had a conversation with Char about him being afraid going to the space because of Lalah's ghost. I have seen numerous time Amuro/Char talking monologue with Lalah as if they still able to make a real conversation with her. So Kamille being able to utilize that psychic potential is not completely unbelievable . It's not that he is not paying his power without any price when he got himself comatose from being attacked by Scirocco's mind crush. This shows that Newtype is not untouchable, or i can say that Tomino is being fair about his ridiculousness of Kamille powered up his mech using newtype space magic in the last 5 episodes and there's a price he has to pay for (ie: comatose)  I have seen Legend of Galactic Heroes, I did enjoy it but after eps 90 something , it just doesn't do it for me anymore precisely because watching LOGH was like watching historical channel, it lacks something that unbelievable in a small part that makes scifi , scifi."
Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,1 point,Thu May 21 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"Disagree that Gundam has strayed toward DBZ territory IF you are specifically talking about 0079 and zeta. They have a believable background reasoning as to why they powered up more so than DBZ.   Sorry, 0079 and Zeta are still mostly grounded (with the exception of the final few episodes of Zeta) -- I meant more the later series.  Admittedly it has been a while since I watched Wing or Seed or Seed Destiny; overall the UC franchise seems to be more well founded than some of the later ones.   Though even within UC, can you watch Unicorn episode 5 (maybe 4?) when they have an ""Axis Shock"" with their suits ""psycommu"" fully activated and honestly not be reminded of DBZ?    Actually I think some of the Newtype stuff is worth than DBZ.  In Dragonball Z, up to at least Cell saga, they are pretty good about setting the action up.  The characters have to train and you usually have an indication what they are training to do.  For example, KaioKen + Spirit Bomb to defeat Vegeta, Super Saiyian for Freiza.  It gets ridiculous toward the end but early on they give constant input toward what the characters are working toward, and the characters have to work to achieve it.  In some Newtypes, it feels like they often have an event unlock powers (meeting other Newtypes, loss of a comrade / loved one), and those powers are sometimes not foreshadowed.   I was using Kamille as that was an example I had encountered recently -- it doesn't really take THAT much away from the show, but the DBZ versions of Gundam I don't watch for long and mostly forget them quickly.  But I would say that while empaths are interesting, Newtypes are not science fiction.  By this I am applying the somewhat standard definition:  ""While science fiction draws on and extrapolates from what we know about reality and science, fantasy invents what does not (and likely could not) exist in our reality.""  Do I believe limited telepathy could exist?  Sure, especially within non-human species.  Do I believe such telepathy might construct alternate personas in the telepaths mind, making it seem like they are talking to dead people?  Sure!   Do I believe Telepathy can extend a beam sword or cause plasma/laser beams to bounce off?  Nope, not without it being an intended function of the suit that a non-telepath could do.  At best that would be telekinesis, and I do not believe a human mind could redivert that much energy.  Even worse is this line in Unicorn, where one of the engineers is like ""Yeah we have no idea why it glows when in NT-D mode.""  I get pilots not knowing, but the entire engineering team that build the thing?  When even the experts are unclear on the science behind why it works, that is no longer science fiction, it is fantasy in a space setting."

Gundam,36kbds,OhUmHmm,3,Wed May 20 11:41:31 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you, but there is a difference for me between believability and realism.  Lightsabers are unrealistic, but usually have rules they follow.  They cut through metal and are stopped by another lightsaber.  There is some magic-like explanation, about minovsky particles wrapping up the plasma... yeah it's not hard scifi, you are right, but it is at least consistent for much of original MSG.  I don't want to spoil anything more in zeta, but I agree Zeta is where things start to unravel, though mostly toward the end.  Edit:  I would also say that while some minovsky particles effects are bullshit (e.g. white base not needing thrusters) the universe was consistent in some other respects, such as how minovsky jams radar, making capital ships less effective and triggering the rise of mobile suits."

Gundam,36kbds,sylvanelite,5,Wed May 20 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"You just asked for the fictional space magic to be plausible.   I'm going to go off topic for a minute, but making ""fictional space magic"" plausible is actually how Gundam started.  Gundam was the first real robot show. This is why people consider it ""plausible"". It was supposed to be scaled-up military weapons, not arbitrary super powers. That's what super robots were famous for.  Comparatively, in recent(ish) years, Gundam has been much more loaded with super attacks than a lot of super robot shows (although ones like TTGL and Aquarion are still totally impossible).  I mean, compare Unicorn (able to block Gryps II) or 00-Raiser (teleportation, massive sword, etc) to a traditional Super Robot like Mazinger Z. Mazinger Z has like, 4 attacks, strong armour, and that's it. It can't even fly without a booster being strapped to it.  Probably the best example, is when a Super Robot actually shows up in Gundam and aside from a few seconds of silence, it's one of the more reasonable designs in the show (Tryon 3 compared to some of the other attacks thrown out in Try).  In terms of newtypes specifically: Yeah, super soldiers are fine. Invincible-time-travel-magic? eehhh.  It's quite common for real-robot pilots to become massively OP in terms of piloting abilities, in fact almost every real-robot show does this (macross, votoms). Some of the abilities in Gundam push this a bit too far, though.  (I should clarify, I don't necessarily think Gundam should be a strict real robot show, I'm just pointing out that's how it started off. )"
Gundam,36kbds,JBPBRC,2,Wed May 20 04:53:33 2015 UTC,(Tryon 3 compared to some of the other attacks thrown out in Try).   This. So much this.  I still want my Tryon 3 vs Crossbone match dammit!

However it's worth mentioning that the Newtype element had a much larger role in the novelization of Gundam, which is arguably more in line with the story that Tomino actually wanted to make and not what he had to compromise on due to pleasing corporate fatcats! (Which most likely explains why the Newtype aspect got ramped up once he had the opportunity to make Zeta.)"

I personally don't watch gundam exclusively for the real robot experience, I absolutely love the things many characters say (EVEN SO).

Gundam introduced real robot, then it became more fantastical. So what?! That  was what the show producers and the creative heads behind the show decided, take it or leave it. Everyone just appreciate a fiction for what it is (or dont) and stop complaining that it didn't stay true to what you wanted from it.  We consumers, we were never promised anything in 1979, and we arent owed any amount or realism. Gundam became what it is and that's that, take it or leave it. Just relax and enjoy it."

And X-rounders (aka the fourth(?) newtype) to be interesting.  Honestly I think the reason I like X-rounders the most out of the four is because my favorite character in the series (Asemu) is not an X-rounder but can fight on the same level as them and really through essentially sheer force of will/determination.
Gundam,36kbds,Terminimal,2,Wed May 20 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be better to use 2001: A Space Odyssey as an example rather than Interstellar. If you say:   You are probably the same type of people who complained about the science aspect that had gone wrong in Interstellar   they might say, ""yeah, that did ruin the film."" You'd have fewer people willing to criticize the classic 2001, and that's a direct influence on the Newtype imagery during Lalah's death. 2001 has the hardest of the hard SF when dealing with humans and HAL, then goes to the softest of the soft when dealing with the monolith. You might say it's fair since it had the softness at the beginning... but both Interstellar and even First Gundam sprinkled huge clues about the soft aspects looming on the horizon in their first halves. In Interstellar, those intelligent gravitational anomalies should've clued the audience in that anything was possible, and Gundam's Matilda made a half-joke to Amuro about being an esper.  I enjoyed 0080 and 0083, but only as the sweet diversions they were. I actually kind of despise 08th MS Team. I don't like them less because they don't contain Newtypes, but I think it's a shoddy reason to consider them superior.  I'll admit that I was disappointed by the way Newtype power manifests itself. At first, I was hoping it was a smarter way of processing our five normal senses, nothing extrasensory; otherwise, why emphasize that it's not ESP or psychic power? I was okay with where the Lalah episode took it, but when Newtype ""ghosts"" began powering the Zeta, I just had to stop hoping things would follow my expectations. I still think that the operatic sense of grandeur the Newtype aspect adds to the series outweighs the silliness of it."
Gundam,36kbds,WackyModder84,3,Thu May 21 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal with that, though:  Newtypes are pretty well-elaborated on as the U.C. Timeline goes on. They are considered to be the next step in human evolution in which their mental capabilities expand so much that they end up getting powerful psychic abilities and can even sense feelings of others nearby and psychically communicate with other Newtypes just like them as well. And the U.C. Timeline creates new technology that helps Newtypes harness their Psychic Abilities and take them to the extreme.  Now, let's be real here. Of course this sounds ridiculous from a logical standpoint. But right from the very beginning, back in the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Newtypes were an established thing. And over time, we've only seen how the Universe adapts to them. But this whole thing still requires Suspension of Disbelief to get by on. And since Newtypes are well-established and don't really contradict anything the show says they can and can't do, then your Suspension of Disbelief isn't really broken by it.  Certain Alternate Universes tried to copy the Newtype Model as well, and while some succeeded (X, 00, AGE), others failed hard (SEED/Destiny). But the ones that succeeded still managed to establish their Newtype Look-A-Like Theme fairly well to the point where it's a believable theme and wouldn't break your Suspension of Disbelief. With the ones that failed hard with it, they end up constantly contradicting what they can and can't do and just have it very poorly established. And as a result, your Suspension of Disbelief gets shattered constantly, and you end up calling bullshit on things these Newtype Look-A-Likes do because they keep contradicting themselves and/or have no solid grounds set in place for them."

Gundam,36k5qd,ZeonTwoSix,19,Tue Jun 2 12:16:57 2015 UTC,I'd swap out Ramba Ral from build fighters with the Ramba Ral from Mobile Suit Gundam just to watch the confusion unfold.
Gundam,36k5qd,Narwhail0r,16,Wed May 20 01:18:06 2015 UTC,As long as he doesn't forget to fight he should be fine.
Gundam,36k5qd,Zillamaster,3,Wed May 20 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"According to the ""Gundam Valhalla"" theory, they're the same Ral."
Gundam,36k5qd,alkonium,15,Wed May 20 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"I would switch out Kira (16yo) with Amuro(16yo). It'd be interesting because they started off very similar (the techy, smart kid from a neutral colony suddenly forced to fight in a war) but develop into very different characters. Amuro grew up, accepted his responsibilities, and became mr. perfect- war -hero-one-man-army who kicks ass and saves the world. Kira grew up and stopped fighting for causes he didn't believe in, and then became mr. borderline-vigilante one-man army who kicks ass and saves the world.   It'd be kinda interesting to see how being in different timelines would change who they develop. I mean, would Amuro take the Kira route, or would he stick with one of the military factions? I mean, the earth federation/alliance/whatever and ZAFT are both assholes, but so were Zeon and the earth alliance in UC."
Gundam,36k5qd,Diamo1,7,Wed May 20 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"That's what I like about Kira. Kira didn't suddenly accept that he HAD TO fight after a few battles or so. He only kept fighting to protect his friends until they were safe. To me, Kira is more of the realistic aspect (despite the Jesus divinity) of Gundam.  I just find it rather... silly that someone who was originally living in peace with no direct interaction with the war beforehand would suddenly want to fight after getting caught up in it. I mean, hell, if I don't get the Gundam to pilot, fuck that shit, I'm out the moment I get a chance!"
Gundam,36k5qd,KiraYamatoZG,12,Wed May 20 17:39:15 2015 UTC,Do you want Jesus Amuro? Cause that's how you get Jesus Amuro.
Gundam,36k5qd,newtypeix,2,Wed May 20 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between Kira and Amuro is that Amuro got the shit kicked out of him when he started acting up. Every time Amuro started to think he was special and that he was the only one that mattered he was beaten and told ""No. You AREN'T special and we DON'T need you piloting the Gundam.""  Kira didn't get that. Instead the plot actually FORCES Kira into what Amuro was going into on his own, that he was special and only he could pilot the Gundam and protect everyone.   Later on in their lives, Kira goes and fights because ""only he can"" because he's super-awesome-special-amazeballs. He fights on his own, telling the world that everyone is wrong but him (and his friends). On the other hand, Amuro fights because he believes that what Char's Neo Zeon is doing is wrong, and will fight as a soldier under the command of an army to help stop him."
Gundam,36k5qd,MisterPuck,2,Thu May 21 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"So, basically Amuro is awesome partially because of the Bright slap?"

Gundam,36k5qd,MisterPuck,1 point,Thu May 21 21:27:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd argue that Kira got the same treatment as Amuro as far as being forced to pilot goes. Amuro didn't pilot the Gundam because he was scared of Big Daddy Bright beating his ass, he did it because if he didn't his friends would get killed. He never went whimpering back to the hangar after he got slapped, he went and pouted in his room and only came back out when he saw Sayla getting her ass handed to her.   Ultimately, Amuro was shamed into piloting just like Kira was, and afterwards, they were both tried to stay away from war but were dragged back in. Kira never claimed to be right, he was just fighting because Durandal is an asshole."
Gundam,36k5qd,Diamo1,1 point,Fri May 22 00:04:20 2015 UTC,"You've completely missed the point I was making. I wasn't talking about why they piloted, I was talking about the affect on their personalities because they piloted and because they were heavily relied upon. In both cases, it caused them to get an inflated sense of their importance. The difference is that one of them had this corrected, and the other did not."
Gundam,36k5qd,MisterPuck,1 point,Fri May 22 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, Kira's sense of self importance got really bloated and ran rampant thanks to everyone's favorite character, Flay Allister. I wish Bright had been there to sort him out during the desert arc. But after his showdown with Athrun, I feel like he was driven more by the feeling that he had to at least try to stop the war, no matter how crazy that plan was. Granted, post-Strike Kira is no Shinji Ikari, but he doesn't have an overinflated sense of importance any more than Amuro does."
Gundam,36k5qd,Diamo1,1 point,Fri May 22 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"Later, no, Kira grows out of it, but being ""corrected"" had a big impact on Amuro's character, the fact that Kira didn't get that means that he didn't grow as a character, he didn't learn anything from it. And, it could be argued that Kira does keep his sense of self-importance by thinking he can stop wars all on his own by simply destroying weapons and telling everyone to get along. Amuro understands that he can't do that on his own. Kira doesn't."
Gundam,36k5qd,MisterPuck,1 point,Fri May 22 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Kira say that he knows it's crazy, though? He doesn't care if he can stop the war by himself, he just knows he has to try.   The bottom line is, regardless of whether or not they think they can save the world by themselves, both of them do... well actually, Kira has more help than Amuro.   ...What the fuck am I even talking about anymore?"
Gundam,36k5qd,Diamo1,1 point,Fri May 22 03:40:45 2015 UTC,"correction: Amuro did not actually accepted his responsibilities, he went along with whitebase because his mom did not understand him and very judgmental at what Amuro did. That , and Amuro getting bright slapped did not actually changed his mind, what actually changed his mind was because Bright shamed him by insinuating that amuro is better than char , but he wasn't ( at that time) , so amuro wanted to prove himself better than char. So the whole thing was actually coming from Amuro's personal vendetta to make a name for himself and to prove that he is better than everyone else.  Kira , on the other hand, grew up became a pacifist asshole Jesus wannabe."
Gundam,36k5qd,gaming99,19,Thu May 21 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"Since I just started watching G Gundam, I would switch every pilot in every series with Domon.  The man catches bullets with his fingers. What a badass."

Gundam,36k5qd,Beginning_Gunpla,6,Wed May 20 01:02:35 2015 UTC,But would he know how to use a normal cockpit?
Gundam,36k5qd,PutYaGunsOn,6,Wed May 20 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"Great question, but I would say yes, considering:  A: Far more unlikely people have piloted Gundams successfully.   B: His core fighter seems largely the same as other core fighters."
Gundam,36k5qd,OutZoned,2,Wed May 20 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you give him a system similar to the psycho frame, only without a cockpit. Watch him pilot any mobile suit through sheer will alone.  Oh that little thing Amuro did at the end of CCA? Stopping the asteroid with his Newtype. Domon would straight up kick it in half."

Gundam,36k5qd,shinianx,5,Wed May 20 16:52:24 2015 UTC,To be fair it's not the pilots fault for not having a coordinated Project Meteor. IIRC they weren't even aware of each others' existence until they actually met.  I'd take Sex Merquise over Graham though.

Kira manages to angst in SAO about why everyone has to fight for 50+ episodes (also defeats kayaba akihiko by having superior plot armor: immortal object+1/goes seed), everyone actually likes ALO arc because maybe Suguha can use her boobs to distract Kira from angsting, or at the very least give the audience something else to watch.

Gundam,36lew9,CaptainJesusNFriends,3,Wed May 20 06:32:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure I can help you with all of these, but I'll try my best.  1) CCA and Unicorn are actually right next to each other in the timeline- therefore, nothing happens between them. However, Zeon remnants show up again later in F90, and Zeon loses it's autonomy after CCA. It's also worth mentioning that the events of Hathaway's Flash happen about in 0103.   2). Note that the 'Sides' aren't single colonies! I didn't get this at first either, but it turns about that the Sides are technically fixed points in space where there are lots of colonies- so you can pretty much make them up. However, we DO know that Side 4 was attacked early on by Zeon, as it was a Federation aligned colony.  3) It's never specifically stated. However, it's most likely that the Nu is taken in by the Federation and either put on display or dismantled (Gotta get that Psychoframe!), while the Sazabi probably burnt up in the Atmosphere.  In terms of your other questions- we do know that Junk Dealers like Judau Ashta were definitely collecting scrapped mobile suits- infact, the events of ZZ are kicked off when Judau collects the escape pod of the Yazan's Hambrabi as he thinks it'll fetch a good price. In terms of Cyber Newtypes, that's definately possible. Semi-canon material states that Miharu (The girl from 0079 who Kai fell in love with) 's brother and sister were orphaned after her death. The boy became Zero Murasame, and the girl became Four.  Make sure to send me a link when it's finished! I'm working on a Fan Fic set in Zeta, so feel free to bounce any ideas off of me."
Gundam,36lew9,NeonLightIllusion,1 point,Wed May 20 06:48:53 2015 UTC,"Can do. I know theres ~7 years between CCA and Unicorn, I'm hoping there's no sort of short canon story in between them. I guess I had sides and colonies switched around, so that's good to know.  What are you writing about during Zeta?"
Gundam,36lew9,NeonLightIllusion,2,Wed May 20 07:04:35 2015 UTC,"There's such an enormous amount of material in Gundam that it's often very tough to find and place without missing a step. Seen as I'm assuming that the pilots in your story would be struggling making ends meet, it would be nice to see them using some of the more obscure, outdated suits from the series- check out Sentinel Gundam for some great designs! In regards to my story, it's about a civilian who joins the AEUG. You can check out some pre-production here: X X X. I've got a character list as well X.  Anything to share on your end?"
Gundam,36lew9,boomghost,1 point,Wed May 20 10:59:20 2015 UTC,Nothing yet but a lot of notes I've written down. I'll be sure to show you when I've got something though.

Gundam,36gi4m,CrashmanX,8,Tue May 19 05:18:34 2015 UTC,If it gets popular enough..maybe an english release..
Gundam,36gi4m,ShinnAssuka,5,Tue May 19 08:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yea, no. That ain't happening. Too much music to license, too many series to license. Too much stuff to bother with for Bandai.

Gundam,36gi4m,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Thu May 21 13:22:39 2015 UTC,Same reason companies always do reboots. There's a chance at profit. Reborn was clear that they didn't care much about the localization and just wanted to get it out the door ASAP.
Gundam,36gi4m,CrashmanX,-1,Thu May 21 18:38:47 2015 UTC,Bandai owns Gundam. If they didn't want us to get the game there is nothing that developer TecmoKoei could have done.   Crazy how publisher and developer ate different things. Almost like they're spelling and meaning are different.
Gundam,36gi4m,Maloth_Warblade,2,Wed May 20 11:58:14 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware Tecmo Koei handled the US publishing, not Bandai Namco.  EDIT: Also my point of butchered OST remains. I sure as hell wouldn't want that for Ex. Vs."
Gundam,36gi4m,CrashmanX,1 point,Wed May 20 12:55:54 2015 UTC,"Licensing is licensing. For the US it is terrible for music,  the companies over here want extreme amounts of money for even 30 seconds of a song.   But Bandai still owns Gundam. Intellectual property stands over the developer.   They published all the DW: Gundam games while Omega Force developed them with the DW6? engine. Bandai still cares about the US a little bit. They're just idiots in what they think we'd buy"
Gundam,36gi4m,Maloth_Warblade,1 point,Wed May 20 13:10:26 2015 UTC,"IP vs. Dev, Dev is going to put up a strong enough battle it wouldn't be worth it.  Bandai honestly couldn't care less about the US. Tecmo Koei wanted to get more cash off their title. I honestly doubt Bandai had much involvement outside of saying ""Yea, sure. Release it in the US."""

Gundam,36ga3d,duelistgamer,13,Fri May 22 02:19:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone is forgetting that it was Revil's great escape that prolonged the war. Zeon had one fucking job, and that is to not let the old geezer out of their custody."
Gundam,36ga3d,BoyGodz,6,Tue May 19 04:42:54 2015 UTC,"This, Zeon never had a chance once the war last over a month, the only opportunity they ever had is to hope EFF surrender when they sign the Antarctic treaty, and it was going to happen if Revil hasn't ""miraculously escaped.   Past that point the war basically depends on how long Zeon could last, the Earth invasion would never work out, Zeon doesn't have enough experience fighting under gravity, their advantage of having MS diminished without AMBAC and their supply lines are stretched to their limits, evidently Zeon didn't gain any significant ground after the initial landing, and that is just taking territory that has fallen in chaos after the colony dropping.  The problem with Gelgoog is not that Zeon doesn't have enough of the MS, but they don't have anyone to pilot them, most of the Gelgoog's pilots are just fresh out of training. No amount of assassinations would help Zeon win, the appearance of Gundam only help sped things up for EFF. Zeon couldn't afford to go into all out war if EFF, and Degwin knows that and he tried to stop Gihren from doing so, but Gihren is just too much of an idiot to not see. So if anything, put Revil under more and better guards so that EFF couldn't just bribed their way through."
Gundam,36ga3d,johnzaku,2,Tue May 19 06:07:49 2015 UTC,But... but... I was the second to comment in here and that was my exact point :(
Gundam,36ga3d,duelistgamer,2,Tue May 19 06:11:30 2015 UTC,I hear you!
Gundam,36ga3d,johnzaku,2,Tue May 19 14:30:57 2015 UTC,You were referring to killing him primarily.
Gundam,36ga3d,duelistgamer,2,Tue May 19 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"I would say though a pretty pivotal thing would be if General Revil died rather than being captured. He was instrumental in persuading the Federation to pursue war rather than brokering a deal with zeon after the One Week War.   I pretty much meant like ""what if he'd died or stayed in custody following the tri-stars' capture of his pod."""
Gundam,36ga3d,Char_X_3,2,Tue May 19 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"Well, personally I can't bring myself to read ""if General Revil died rather than being captured"" as ""died or didn't escape after being captured""."
Gundam,36ga3d,duelistgamer,10,Tue May 19 21:59:48 2015 UTC,Easy. All they'd have to do is make sure Amuro sees their recruiting videos.   http://anime.astronerdboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/08-Zeon-recruiter.jpg  He'd switch sides in a heartbeat and bring the Gundam with him.

Gundam,36ga3d,johnzaku,4,Tue May 19 10:23:27 2015 UTC,relevant
Gundam,36ga3d,johnzaku,9,Tue May 19 13:30:45 2015 UTC,Send Shin Matsunaga and Johnny Ridden to help Char destroy the White Base.  I guess Zeon at first under estimated the ship because they didn't have any information on it.  But it would have been very difficult for young Amuro to take on 3 aces and protect White Base from the rest of Char's forces.
Gundam,36ga3d,duelistgamer,5,Tue May 19 05:20:00 2015 UTC,Hmmm there are a few possibilities.   I would say though a pretty pivotal thing would be if General Revil died rather than being captured. He was instrumental in persuading the Federation to pursue war rather than brokering a deal with zeon after the One Week War.
Gundam,36ga3d,johnzaku,1 point,Tue May 19 04:04:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking about that one too.  Certainly if he died in battle or was assassinated prior to Loum it seems likely the Federation would collapse -- but if done after Loum, I wonder if he would become a Martyr?  There's also the Origin (non-canon) telling of events, which suggests Gihren (or maybe it was Kycillia?) purposefully let Revil escape.  If that was the case, I wonder if Gihren would have even accepted a surrender?  edit: I suppose Revil was also instrumental in letting the White Base continue as it was.  Though I have always been uncertain on whether White Base was actually necessary for winning the war or just helped speed it along."
Gundam,36ga3d,duelistgamer,2,Tue May 19 04:07:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, white base was a massive morale booster. And they were instrumental in operation odessa, the offensive that pushed Zeon off of earth."
Gundam,36ga3d,LaoTzusGymShoes,1 point,Tue May 19 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"Oh I had forgotten they prevented the nuke and saved Revil at Odessa!  Yeah that might have bought Zeon more time.  For some reason those episodes are a blur, I should probably reread that volume of Origin."
Gundam,36ga3d,MS14JG-2,1 point,Tue May 19 04:16:17 2015 UTC,Dying wouldn't be as bad. Think CK2 warscore. A kidnapped enemy can reveal secrets that a dead enemy can't. He was way more valuable alive.
Gundam,36ga3d,KiraYamatoZG,1 point,Tue May 19 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"Right, but what what I meant was... like, what if his escape capsule had ruptured? Or taken a stray shot? What if the tri-stars had just sliced his battle-bridge in two like they did that other cruiser? That kind of stuff."
Gundam,36ga3d,LaoTzusGymShoes,1 point,Tue May 19 06:07:50 2015 UTC,It really hinges on whether or not the Federation knows that Zeon is exhausted.
Gundam,36ga3d,kuroageha,7,Tue May 19 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Underutilization of their mightiest weapon was what doomed Zeon.    Zeon only produced 3 Zocks.  This was an error.  They should have made a shitload, and then launched Operation Zock Turret.  This consists of dropping a Zock as close to the middle of the enemy base as possible, like out of a plane or whatever, and then having said Zock's pilot fire the front and back cannons over and over while spinning around like an idiot.    When there's no base or enemies left, just Zock on outta there without a care in the Earth Sphere."
Gundam,36ga3d,OmegaSeven,13,Wed May 20 03:00:18 2015 UTC,Produce the Gelgoog two weeks early.  They'd do a significantly larger amount of damage to the Federation fleet at Solomon and make it harder for them to win at  A Boua Qu.
Gundam,36ga3d,thereddaikon,3,Tue May 19 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"You know, it still boggles my mind that the MSG series took place all in 4 months.  I mean, talk about the comeback of the year. Federation had their asses handed to them left and right for 8 months, then in 4 months after the development of their own MS, they took back most of the Earth and pushed all the way onto Side 3 practically.  If Zeon had more supplies and more secure supply lines, they would have most likely won the war before White Base and the V Project was finished with productions and testing."
Gundam,36ga3d,Mayomori,2,Tue May 19 21:13:43 2015 UTC,Yet Zeon still had time for all those different mobile suits.  Shoulda gone full Gouf.
Gundam,36ga3d,DefrostedTuna,2,Wed May 20 03:03:21 2015 UTC,Interesting!  Do you think that would set the Federation back enough to let Zeon turn the tide after a victory at A Boua Qu?  I suppose we could surmise the Gundam would still get destroyed at A Boua Qu or even at Solomon.  In MS Igloo I seem to remember some Gelgoogs getting trashed with enough Balls attacking and wonder if the Federation would be able to spit out a few thousand shortly after a loss at A Boua Qu
Gundam,36ga3d,AkiZayoi,1 point,Tue May 19 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"At the rate production was going, I think this is likely.  The EFSF will always be able to outproduce Zeon, especially after retaking Odessa.  The EF took 60% losses at Solomon and then a big hit with the Solar Ray and still deployed overwhelming numbers at ABAQ."
Gundam,36ga3d,Zonetr00per,5,Tue May 19 17:33:32 2015 UTC,Assassinate Casval Deikun before he has a chance to join the Zeon forces under the alias Char Aznable with the expressed purpose of carrying out a plot to assassinate the entire Zabi family.
Gundam,36ga3d,LetsGetTropikyle,2,Tue May 19 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"I was also wondering about this!  Was Char the greatest enemy of the Zeons?  Garma may have survived, keeping Degwin active to curb Gihren (slightly).  White Base would probably have kept it's regular crew complement (which may have been better or worse, I'm not sure).  He seemed important at the battle of Loum but I have not read anything that suggests he turned the tide singlehandedly."
Gundam,36ga3d,NMR3,2,Tue May 19 14:19:30 2015 UTC,He dealt a serious blow to the leadership of Zeon by directly killing two members of the Zabi family. I'm sure they would have imploded on their own eventually but Chat definitely assisted them in that. Having said that I doubt it would have drastically changed the war. Most of the Zabi's issues were internal and they were about as dysfunctional as any family in game of thrones.
Gundam,36ga3d,LordRevann,2,Tue May 19 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, Char might kill Garma and Dozle but in the end, it was the higher up that actually trying to eat each others. Kycillia will kill Gihren just as how Gihren will kill Degwin, it was inevitable. Imagine a Zeon that have no Char, I'm pretty sure they will fail faster than the Zeon of 0079 we currently have."
Gundam,36ga3d,Mayomori,3,Tue May 19 15:28:33 2015 UTC,If Zeon had won the battle of Odessa I sincerely believe they could have won the war. They would have kept a strong foothold on the Earth and not have been forced to retreat into space. If Kycillia was commanding instead of that selfish bastard M'Queve (who second handedly contributed to the death of Ramba Ral!) I think they could have won.
Gundam,36ga3d,LordRevann,2,Tue May 19 04:20:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting, so perhaps assassinating M'Queve could have helped save Rumba Ral and turned the tide at Odessa?"
Gundam,36ga3d,Robborboy,2,Tue May 19 14:27:10 2015 UTC,"""Rumba Ral"". This aint no wine boy, no wine!"
Gundam,36ga3d,alkonium,2,Tue May 19 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think this is the most viable answer here. Zeon needed Earth's resources for its war effort; without those, they simply would not be able to keep up with the Federation's war effort. The survival of the White Base or the V-project being severely delayed are influential, but on the grand scale it would take a Zeon victory at a major battle like Odessa to keep the war in their favor. A victory there would A give Zeon continued resources to ramp up production of advanced mobile suits and warships, B deny those same resources to the Federation, and C result in the destruction of (or at least being tied up) a huge portion of the Federation's available resources at that point, allowing Zeon operations elsewhere to go ahead undisrupted."
Gundam,36ga3d,Brenticus302,2,Tue May 19 16:11:05 2015 UTC,All these theories make me wonder if they'll ever produce an alternate timeline where Zeon did win

The machine worked, it just took them too long to get it operational, if the machine is finished a little sooner, the Federation doesn't have time to mount an assault, Jaburo gets destroyed and the Federation push into space is delayed if not halted completely"
Gundam,36ga3d,DrMrJoey,2,Tue May 19 13:02:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Aina's brother didn't go all crazy and decided to kill everyone involve in the project then Zeon might benefit from its data."

I thought it was pretty heavily fortified underground."
Gundam,36ga3d,boomghost,3,Tue May 19 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"If you recall, the last full powered shot from it was enough to melt clean through a mountain range and take out the Big Tray that was serving as the command post for the assault on the Zeon base."

Gundam,36ga3d,WingGundam,2,Tue May 19 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"Well, a little bit later on, but at Odessa base. if the nuke had went off rather than Amuro disabling it. This would turn shit right around.

Gundam,36c552,dataznthug,17,Mon May 18 04:57:04 2015 UTC,"At least in the UC, my understanding is that it has to do with Minovsky physics: In short, Minovsky particles interact rarely with normal matter when at rest, but strongly interact with charged particles and other Minovsky particles.  A beam saber's actual plasma beam is contained by a 'lattice' of Minovsky particles surrounding it - essentially a very small I-field. This lattice does not interact with normal states of matter; when the beam saber encounters such, the I-field is disrupted and the plasma beam is free to destructively encounter the matter in its path. When it encounters another I-field - like another beam saber - the two lattices interact by Minovsky physics and kinetic energy is directly transferred through the I-fields to the equipment projecting them.  As for AC, CE, AD... I have no idea."

Gundam,36c552,Awesom3xNinja,5,Wed May 27 04:02:18 2015 UTC,CE has no fields to do beam clashing that's why they always block other sabers with shields and in AD it's basically the same just replace I-field is GN-fields
Gundam,36c552,tacotouchdown14,5,Mon May 18 08:28:16 2015 UTC,"The way the U.C. timeline handles it is like this:  The Beam Saber itself consist of a Blade-Shaped I-Field being emitted from the hilt, and that I-Field gets filled on the inside with Minovsky Particle Plasma to form the blade itself. And when Beam Sabers clash, they're basically two Blade-Shaped I-Fields repelling each other. Now say that the Beam Saber hits something physical instead of another saber. When that happens, the point that makes contact with that physical object or surface will break a hole in the Beam Saber's I-Field and let the Plasma inside rush out all at once. That is what gives Beam Sabers their cutting factor. And when you finish slicing through that object, the I-Field on the Beam Saber reforms almost instantly and regains orientation.  Gundam 00 handles it the same way as well, just reworded:  The way 00 handles it is that Beam Sabers in that universe have a Positron Field to contain the Beam Blade inside of it with Superheated GN Particles to form the blade itself. So all in all, it's the same shit as the U.C, just reworded.  However, there are certain alternate universes who tried to be different. Some for the better, some for the worse.  The Cosmic Era is the prime example. Beam Sabers in that era emit a stream of ""Beam Particles"" that are wrapped inside an Electromagnetic Field to keep them in the shape of a blade. But even despite this, there is absolutely no repelling factor involved here. Beam Sabers pass right through each other as if they're not even there as a result of this, and the only way to block a Beam Saber in the Cosmic Era is if you block with a shield, OR if you block with a Melee Weapon that has Anti-Beam Coating on it.  Gundam AGE is also quite interesting with this topic. Because what's interesting here is that Gundam AGE's Beam Sabers actually seem to have a Solid Part on the inside of the Beam Blade. Information on AGE's beam saber technology is very limited for now, but there are a lot of implications to be taken into account. If you watch the Legilis R VS. Dark Hound fight in Memory of Eden, there is a moment where the Dark Hound shanks the Legilis R's Beam Rifle. And even when he lets go of the beam saber, it stays active while it's shanked through the rifle. Even when the Legilis R moves its rifle with the saber still shanked it, the Beam Saber doesn't just slice through it as it moves, it stays in place as if it was a physical sword left inside something. Another example was the AGE-1 fight in Memory of Eden, where a Beam Saber gets shoved into the ground Blade-First. It stays on even when it was buried, and you see the AGE-1 rip it out of the ground just fine with the blade still on. With the information we have so far about it, we can deduct that there's probably a physical part of Beam Sabers inside the Beam Blade for all of this to even be possible.  But yeah, that's basically how Beam Sabers work for the most part. =)"

Gundam,36c552,RJWalker,2,Mon May 18 09:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think UC actually has something on it.   If I remember my UC lore, beam sabers are basically a giant Minovsky Envelope with super heated plasma inside of the envelope. Since it's just envelopes crashing into each other it works.   Could be wrong though."
Gundam,36c552,MS14JG-2,2,Mon May 18 05:03:37 2015 UTC,"A few people have described it as ""I-Fields Repelling Each Other,"" but I don't think that's exactly how it works (though close).  I-Fields in UC essentially stop or contain ""beam particles.""  So an i-field barrier could block a beam, or it could stop a beam saber by stopping the beam particles of that beam saber.  The beam saber itself is made by having the beam particles contained within a shaped i-field barrier.  When two beam sabers clash, it isn't that the I-Fields are repelling each other, it's that each I-Field is repelling the beam particles contained by the opposing I-Field.  This is why a beam saber can also stop a fired beam; the I-Field that contains the beam saber's particles can repel the incoming beam."
Gundam,36c552,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Mon May 18 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"This is correct, it is not that the I-field that stops other I-field, the I-field stops the beam housed inside the other I-field"
Gundam,36c552,Promethious7,1 point,Wed May 20 03:35:18 2015 UTC,"The actual particles don't clash with each other all that much, but the I-fields and whatnot that contain them do."
Gundam,36c552,Diamo1,1 point,Mon May 18 05:49:40 2015 UTC,Crossbone X3 could grab beams because it manipulators contains an I-field.
Gundam,36c552,Vatepgo1,1 point,Mon May 18 07:21:54 2015 UTC,The beam of the saber is contained to the sword shape by an i-field. The i-fields can't pass through eachother
Gundam,36c552,Nick700,1 point,Thu May 21 19:11:53 2015 UTC,"Basically the beams are kept in form by the I-Field generated by Minovsky particles, as such like magnets when the two fields meet they repel each other creating the illusion of actual collision much like atoms do. So in essence they arent really touching just forcibly repelling each other.  Least thats how I've come to understand it"
Gundam,36ciq8,GoochiusMaximus,3,Mon May 18 07:56:50 2015 UTC,"re: 1  an original character origin, is never a good idea in fan fiction."
Gundam,36ciq8,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Mon May 18 08:41:47 2015 UTC,i had my doubts.. thats why i asked:)
Gundam,36ciq8,ShinnAssuka,2,Mon May 18 08:44:04 2015 UTC,"What you can do is write them as a side character, or minor character. Ultimatly, other fans are there to read about the cannon characters first and formost."
Gundam,36ciq8,ShinnAssuka,1 point,Mon May 18 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"this is true. i was always a fan of the side story concept. if youve ever read Shadows Of The Empire, its a perfect example of filling in the blanks as a fan fiction and later being proclaimed as official lore. however, i feel as if there is a huge risk of disappointment if i make it completely about the cannon characters. i might just have them pop up occasionally but also have them play a huge part in plot advancement."
Gundam,36ciq8,HamEaterQC,2,Mon May 18 12:52:15 2015 UTC,"Its a difficult thing to balance, I know. But just a focus on OC is rarely well received. The other way is too focus first on the cannon characters at the beginning and then bring in the oc over time."

For instance, it might be acceptable to refer to the machine by serial number when talking to superiors, or engineers.

I also don't know the model numbers of the suits by heart, so when I have to go to the Gundam wiki to see what suit the model number pertains to, then I'd prefer a translated version so I don't have to do that each time; it's a huge inconvenience.  The gameplay is what matters, but I'm less immersed in if I can't follow the verbally told story; the gameplay can get repetitive so it'd be nice to have some extra motivation other than some okay cutscenes."

In addition, if you're a Gundam Unicorn fan and love Armored Core as well, I'd recommend Mobile Suit Gundam UC for the PS3 as well. It focuses specifically on Episodes 1-3 of Unicorn, since that was all that was out at the time for Unicorn's showing. But it's still fun as fuck to play and plays just like Armored Core.

Gundam,368jfm,Robborboy,1 point,Mon May 18 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I didn't end up using all of the buttons on the controller. The game didn't really need all of em either way, considering Bonds of the Battlefield is on PSP and it has a limited button layout. The same goes for Rise from the Ashes since, again, Dreamcast Controllers don't have 30 buttons by a longshot.  Games like Elite Dangerous and MechWarrior Online are a bit more complicated with that, so I can see how you'd need more buttons with those games. But I was mainly talking about how I used my controller for Gundam Games via Emulation. And since those games already used a controller in the past, it's not that hard to map them. XD  So the 30-Button Cap doesn't really get in the way a lot."

All I recall are SDGO, UCGO, that Gundam without Gundam names Bootfighter Windom XP, and uh...I guess a conversion mod for Homeworld 2. That is all that immediately comes to mind. Barring PS2 emulation.  If there is anything else by all means, I've been needing a Gundam fix. Was gonna import Breaker 2 for vita, but put it on hold as I am saving for a new PSU, and to upgrade from my 750TiSC to a GTX970 G1."
Gundam,368jfm,Robborboy,3,Mon May 18 03:16:50 2015 UTC,"Ok so first of all, SDGO is now shutting down so that one's out of the question unfortunately. Second of all, UCGO is garbage and totally not worth your time at all. Icarus Server is falling apart and John's UCGO Server just recently shut down because John's a big baby and ragequit UCGO all because he couldn't manage his own playerbase. So those two games aren't worth it. Bootfighter Windom XP and Ultimate Knight Windom XP are both completely obsolete now, and Ultimate Knight Windom SV is basically all but cancelled at this point, so that's out of the question as well. But the reason why they're obsolete is because we now have another game that plays just like WindomXP except A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER.  Now that I got those ones out of the way, I will tell you everything you need to know about current Gundam Gaming on PC:  First off, your Gundam MMOs that are currently available:  1.) Mobile Suit Gundam Online [MSGO]: If you're a fan of Early Universal Century Timeline; specifically referring to the timegap of U.C. 0079 - 0083, then this game will be a match made in Heaven for you. This game has MASSIVE Multiplayer Battles with up to 52 vs 52 Large-Scaled Player-Based Battles on HUGE maps. Every single week, the game updates and changes what the set battlefield scenario map is, as they basically follow the timeline in chronological order from start to finish, and on each map the objectives and obstacles change. For example: If they have the Battlefield set to Jaburo, Zeon will be able to call in Char Aznable piloting his Z'Gok Custom. If the battle is on Solomon, IIRC Zeon can call in Big Zam for support. And the Federation also have very similar Off-Map Support Call-Ins as well, such as Carpet Bombing, Kai in the Guncannon, Hayato in the Guntank, Amuro in the RX-78, even Bright w/ the White Base coming in for support! You get to customize your mobile suits to your preference, that includes Colorschemes and Weapon Loadouts. You pick up to 4 Mobile Suits to spawn with per-battle, and when you go into battle, you will only be able to spawn with one of those 4 that you picked. If you die in battle with one of them, there will be a cool-down timer that will appear for that mobile suit, and in the meantime, you will either have to wait for it to go down OR spawn with a different mobile suit in the meantime. The cool-down timer differs depending on how powerful the mobile suit in question is, and is usually VERY HIGH for Gundam-Type Units. Even though this game is not in english and has no plans for any international releases, signing up for it is a BREEZE! No Social Security Numbers, No Online IDs, No Bullshit like that. Just sign up and play! But there's only ONE Minor Problem: The game is currently IP Blocked for Japan Only. Thankfully, Bypassing the IP Block is EXTREMELY Simple as easy to do! I managed to do it without a problem with the help of a special VPN that I use called SoftEther VPN Client; which is a HIGH-SPEED FREE VPN that supports a variety of different countries and was even created in Japan in the first place, so it's a Win/Win Scenario if you ask me! If you need any help with bypassing the IP Block or anything, I can help you out with that if you wish. Just consult me personally on it and I'll help you out no problem! =)  Game Trailer here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydGp4DJCq8Q   Game Website Here:   http://msgo.bandainamco-ol.jp/   VPN Website:   https://www.softether.org/ <-- Free. http://en.loxch.com/ <-- Better, but Not QUITE Free, but close enough to it.   2.) SD Gundam NEXT EVOLUTION [SDGN]: This game is designed to replace the now shutting-down SD Gundam Capsule Fighter Online that has made an impressive 9-year-long lifespan since 2007. This game plays a little bit differently than Capsule Fighters does, but does keep some gameplay elements of it in tact. The game is still currently in Closed Beta, but is going to be coming out this summer supposedly. So stay tuned for this one:  Game Trailer Here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxP2z_W7yZ4   Official Website Here:   http://www.sdgn.co.kr/   3.) Gundam Diorama Front: Here's a question for ya. Whad'ya get when you take Clash of Clans and Gundam, and put them both in a blender? The answer: This Game. Gundam Diorama Front plays extremely similar to that of Clash of Clans, and it is 100% Free 2 Play. It's currently in Closed Beta right now, but just like SDGN, it will be set for full release later this year. Definitely keep an eye on it in the meantime. BE ADVISED, this game is partially IP-Blocked. The keyword being ""Partially"". You only need to turn on your VPN just to log into the game.

Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,3,Mon May 18 03:33:50 2015 UTC,"Now that the 2 Main Gundam MMOs are done, let's talk about another few games, shall we?  1.) SD Gundam Senki 0080: This one right here is a bit of a Rarer Gundam Game on PC, but it is out there regardless. If you've ever seen the game on PS3 called ""Gundam Senki: Battlefield Record U.C. 0081"", this game right here basically mimics that game limb from limb except the mobile suits are in SD Form. Does that make it bad? ABSOLUTELY NOT! The game itself is still VERY FUN and even has Online Multiplayer! If you wish to see gameplay of the game, here you go:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf0gNI4urWM   2.) Gundam SEED - Little Fighter 2: For you Gundam Fans out there who have Low-Spec PCs that either have Windows XP 32-bit or Modern-Day Low-Spec PCs w/ Intel Video Cards, this is one Gundam Game I'd definitely recommend giving a shot. Basically, if you don't know what Little Fighter 2 is, it's a Side-Scrolling Beat-Em-Up game created in 1999 that is unbelievably moddable. Surprise Suprise, someone ended up making a Gundam SEED mod for it, and it is Fun As Hell! You can play as all your favorite mobile suits from Gundam SEED w/ a few cameos from SEED Destiny thrown in there as well such as the Strike Freedom and Force Impulse, but it's more focused on the 1st SEED than it is on Destiny. But if you have a shitty PC with a crap graphics card, this is definitely one to check out! IMPORTANT NOTE: This game does have problems with NVIDIA and AMD Video Cards on Windows Vista thru 7. The last NVIDIA Video Card that can be used that doesn't have any problems at all was the GeForce 8800 series. Video Cards that were made after that have this problem with the game where the sprites would not mirror and that they would only be facing to the right. It's an annoying glitch and can really interfere with the game. But if you have an Intel Video Card, you should be totally fine.  Sample Gameplay:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhrZCZBf5VU   Now that those are outta the way, let's talk some Gundam RTS Games on PC for you strategy games out there:  1.) Starcraft - Gundam Century: Another great one for Low-Spec PC Gamers and fans of Starcraft: Brood War. This little Mod we got here for SC: Brood War replaces the Terran w/ the Earth Federation and the Protoss w/ Zeon. Sorry guys, no Wing / SEED / 00 in this one. But either way, it doesn't stop it from being any less fun that it really is. You can find Starcraft: Gundam Century on MODDB.com here:   http://www.moddb.com/mods/gundam-century   Gameplay Here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qge4epRMPfk   2.) C&C Generals - XenoForce 1.5 / C&C 3 - XenoForce Reborn: Being my personal favorite Gundam RTS Game on PC currently, XenoForce currently has 2 Homes. The original mod was for Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour 1.04; which adds 3 New Generals, the Earth Forces General, the Spacenoid General, and the U.N. Spacy General into the game with new units from each faction in the game. The newer version of XenoForce known as XenoForce Reborn currently resides in Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars 1.09 which adds the ""Universal Century"" as a new side; in which case the current version has a Heavy Emphysis on Gundam X so far, but keep in mind that XenoForce Reborn is subject to change in the future and it will add a lot more.  You can find both mods @ MODDB.com at these links:   http://www.moddb.com/mods/xenoforce http://www.moddb.com/mods/xenoforce-reborn   XenoForce 1.5 Gameplay:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b3jR8UNtNc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBAIh4eT_6M https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bBFmycxhI0   3.) Homeworld 2: 0079 - 0083 Mod 3.1 / SEED Mod 3.3: Being one of the greatest RTS Games of All Time, Homeworld 2 has not one, but Two Gundam Mods for it. One that focuses specifically on the Universal Century Timeline Gap of the years 0079 - 0083. The second one focuses on the Cosmic Era; which IIRC the latest version adds in Z.A.F.T. and O.R.B. as playable sides, but no sign of O.M.N.I. yet. Build up your fleet, pump out some mobile suit squadrons, send them into battle against your enemy, and enjoy the fireworks. You can check out the gameplay of each mod here:   0079 - 0083 3.1 Gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RYCVxKxxxA SEED Mod 3.3 Gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7OjbKz5Njk   NOTE: If you're wondering ""Wtf's with the TIE Fighter Sound Effects in Gundam Mod 3.1?"", Don't ask, I have no fucking idea. I questioned the same thing too. But either way, I can dig it. 8)  UPDATE: Apparently, the Gundam 0079 Mod for HW2 has been updated for Homeworld 2 Remastered as of recently as well! =D  4.) Total Annihilation: Spring - Gundam RTS: If you're a fan of Large-Scaled RTS Battles, then this one should definitely catch your attention as well. Set in the Early Years of the Universal Century Timeline of 0079 - 0080, this fan-made Gundam RTS Game on the Total Annihilation: Spring Open Source Engine is extremely fun to play and is basically like a ""Gundam Supreme Commander"" type of game. At this point, this game has been cancelled and discontinued, but it is still up for download if you know where to look. In this case, you can check out the gameplay of it here w/ the Download Link in the description:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVXyOYQxqY   And lastly, if you wanna get into Gundam Games that are based on Emulation  I would strongly recommend PPSSPP; which is a Functioning PSP Emulator. Using that will grant you access to every single Gundam Game on the PSP. Great Gundam Games on the PSP to look out for are:   Gundam VS Gundam NEXT Plus <--- (replacement for WindomXP) Gundam SEED: Rengou VS. Z.A.F.T. PORTABLE Gundam Battle Universe SD Gundam: G Generation Overworld Super Robot Wars Z2 & Z2.2 Another Century's Episode: PORTABLE Mobile Suit Gundam: Senjou no Kizuna PORTABLE   Those are currently The Best Gundam Games Ever Made on the PSP, that you can play without a problem on PPSSPP.  If your PC can handle it, I would also recommend PCSX2 for even more Gundam Game Emulation on the PS2 as well.  So now then, class...............any questions? ;-)"
Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,1 point,Mon May 18 03:35:52 2015 UTC,I...I don't even know what to do with all of this information. Wow. I will be combing through it when I get some free time. Much appreciated friend!
Gundam,368jfm,Robborboy,1 point,Mon May 18 13:14:18 2015 UTC,Now that I have had time to read this amazing post: My PC handles PCSX2 with ease. What would you suggest as the best PS2 Gundam games.
Gundam,368jfm,Robborboy,1 point,Mon May 18 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"The best ones for PS2 are as follows:   Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation VS. Zeon Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam VS Zeta Gundam Mobile Suit Gundam: Rengou VS. Z.A.F.T. 2 Plus Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters In Space Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Never Ending Tomorrow Mobile Suit Gundam: Lost War Chronicles Mobile Suit Gundam: Climax U.C. MS Saga: A New Dawn Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Generation of C.E. Another Century's Episode 1 - 3 Super Robot Wars Z Super Robot Wars Alpha 3   Now with that in mind, I would still recommend also getting PPSSPP, since that has a fuckload of more recent Gundam Games on it. Gundam VS Gundam NEXT Plus, SD Gundam G Generation Overworld, Another Century's Episode: PORTABLE, and Senjou no Kizuna PORTABLE are prime examples of this. So I'd recommend getting both emulators and stocking up on games for both as well."

Holy shit it's amazing I wish they had it in the U.S.  It's basically a giant cockpit u get in with two analog stick controls with triggers and three huge screens in front of you. So fucking cool. I want that in the U.S. And in English

Gundam,368jfm,shpeilin,3,Sun May 17 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Battlefield: Bad Company 0079  Story mode  You play one half of the campaign as a Zeon soldier during the attack on Earth. Just one of many grunts. Near the end of this campaign, a Zaku II pilot gets killed and you have to take over. Because of your heroism, you're promoted and given his place. This would focus on ground combat in the middle of MS battles.  Then, the EFSF campaign begins immediately after. You're on a squad of misfits, think sort of like 08th MS Team but even more dysfunctional. This would focus on MS battles on ground, with the game taking place in space for the last few missions.  Multiplayer  Just like BFBC, how the game played would depend on the map. Some maps would have regular vehicles, some would have just mobile suits, and a few would have both. Features iconic locations such as Jaburo, Side 7, A Baoa Qu, and Odessa. Reimagined to be more realistic, of course, while not deviating as much as The Origin."
Gundam,368jfm,WaywardMetroid,2,Sun May 17 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"A follow-up to Battlefield Record 0081, with...  More customization!  Overhaul the old system, and add visual customizations.  Cockpit view!  Inexplicably last seen in Side Story 0079.  Dismemberment!  The one way 0081 was inferior to Crossfire.  Having your arms blown off but still successfully kicking a squad of Zakus to death was the just about the only time Crossfire was fun.  Enhanced multiplayer!  PvP and PvE, with expanded online persistence (form a unit, that kinda thing), and larger player counts.  Ideas shameless stolen from OP!  Player-operated (and customized) battleships.  Asymmetrical multiplayer modes with either a bunch of MS versus a battleship and only a few defenders, or battleship duels supported by MS.  ...  Oh, and PirateLincoln on Steam, if anyone wants to Gun some Icaruses."
Gundam,368jfm,PirateLincoln,2,Sun May 17 06:30:03 2015 UTC,"Something that plays like Armored Core, with online multiplayer PvP."
Gundam,368jfm,chrysamere,1 point,Sun May 17 07:22:46 2015 UTC,"Well, aside from the ""Online Multiplayer PvP"" part, you DO actually have a few options for  the ""Gundam"" and ""Armored Core"" part of that request.  Another Century's Episode 1, 2, 3, R, and PORTABLE are basically Armored Core meats Anime Mechas. Gundam included.  I would HIGHLY recommend checking them out. All of them are fucking awesome. =)  In addition, if you're a Gundam Unicorn fan and love Armored Core as well, I'd recommend Mobile Suit Gundam UC for the PS3 as well. It focuses specifically on Episodes 1-3 of Unicorn, since that was all that was out at the time for Unicorn's showing. But it's still fun as fuck to play and plays just like Armored Core. Ontop of that, it also has A FUCKLOAD of Great DLC Missions available as well and Extra Playable Mobile Suits from all across Unicorn. It's a Gundam Unicorn Fan's wet-dream. Highly Recommend it along with Another Century's Episode. =)"
Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,1 point,Mon May 18 02:46:36 2015 UTC,Just watched some videos.. god it looks awesome. Another fucking japanese only amazing looking game.
Gundam,368jfm,chrysamere,1 point,Mon May 18 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"DO NOT let that stop you from playing it, dude!!!!!  The menus are actually piss-ass easy to pick up on, and translations for them are available online. I can even link you them if you wanted.  I own the entire Another Century's Episode Saga, and believe me when I say that YOU DO NOT wanna miss out on this game, dude. Do not let Language Barriers scare you away. I did that at first, and when I finally decided to check it out, it was worth every fucking bit of it.  But on the Plus Side for Multiplayer, Another Century's Episode 2 and 3 actually have LOCAL VS. MULTIPLAYER AND 2-Player Co-Op as well. And Another Century's Episode PORTABLE actually has 3-Player Co-Op as well! That's better than nothing, right? lol"
Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,1 point,Mon May 18 02:58:54 2015 UTC,How do I even get it? I don't even know if my PS3 is region locked or not.
Gundam,368jfm,chrysamere,1 point,Mon May 18 03:01:05 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the deal:  First of all, the answer is No. PS3s are 100% Region-Free. You can literally buy Japanese Games for them no matter what region you live in, and they will play on your PS3 perfectly fine with no issues at all. Although I'd recommend making a Japanese PSN Account in case some games have DLC available for them like Gundam Extreme VS Full Boost for example. The only thing that's still Region-Locked with PS3s are PS2 Games. But PS3 Games are 100% Region-Free. The PSP is also Region-Free as well, in case you ever think of that as well.  Another Century's Episode: R is the one that's on PS3. I'd also like to point out that the menus for that game are 90% ENGLISH. The only thing that's not in english are the Character Dialogue and Story for the most part.  Second of all, you can also import the game from pretty much anywhere online. You can just buy it used for cheap, and you'd be home free.  Now as for Another Century's Episode 1, 2, 3, and PORTABLE. All of those are fully playable on PC as long as your PC is strong enough for the job. I can help you confirm this if you can tell me your CPU/Processor, how much RAM you have, and what Video Card you have in your PC right now. If you can tell me those 3 parts, then I can determine if your PC is equipped for it or not.  In addition, it just came to me that there's also another Gundam Game that plays just like Armored Core as well called Mobile Suit Gundam UC for the PS3. It focuses around Gundam Unicorn Episodes 1-3, but it also has A FUCKLOAD of Great DLC Missions available as well and Extra Playable Mobile Suits from all across Unicorn. That's another one I'd highly recommend as well."
Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,1 point,Mon May 18 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"You are talking about a PS2 emulator right? Let's see.. I have an i7 930, 8GB of RAM, and a Radeon HD5870."
Gundam,368jfm,chrysamere,1 point,Mon May 18 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, dude. You more than qualify for PS2 Emulation on a PC like that. It's a little dated, but it holds up plenty fine. lol  And yes, I am talking about that. You caught on very quick. XD  You even more qualify for PSP Emulation as well. So technically you could use PCSX2 to emulate Another Century's Episode 1, 2, and 3. While on the flipside, you could use PPSSPP to emulate Another Century's Episode PORTABLE.  Either way, you're fully equipped for the job. ;-)"
Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,1 point,Mon May 18 03:19:27 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for the info - definitely gonna get an emulator and check that out. I saw the gameplay footage for Tallgeese III in Episode 2 and it looks SO fun.

Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,2,Mon May 18 19:32:28 2015 UTC,A Build Fighters game. Optional use of real Gunpla.
Gundam,368jfm,JealotGaming,4,Sun May 17 07:24:33 2015 UTC,"Genuinely surprised they haven't done this yet, amiibo/skylanders style. Buy a gunpla, unlock it in the game. Maybe next season...!"
Gundam,368jfm,mrwafu,2,Sun May 17 07:52:04 2015 UTC,"It's because of all the customization that you can put into the little buggers. What with all the possible piece combinations and such, it would be nigh impossible to tell if you had an Unicorn, or if you were just using whatever identifier piece from it."
Gundam,368jfm,Kami_of_Water,1 point,Sun May 17 07:57:44 2015 UTC,"Buying a Gunpla IRL should just unlock all the parts for that Gundam in game. You should also be able to buy specific parts in game for ridicoulously cheap/in-game-not-real-money, buying the actual Gunpla just unlocks all of them, and that Mobile Suit's ""Gimmick Parts"" for some Suits.   So you could put together something that was pretty much Gundam Unicorn, but wouldn't get the Destroy Mode/NT-D unless you buy the kit.  A good way to do it would be somethign similar to Skylanders - so you buy the game and it gomes with an E GP Base, and you get special kits that come with a special ""core piece"" that can be read by the E GP Base to unlock all its parts in game, and a blank ""Core Piece"" that you can record a custom gunpla on.  The game should also come with a stock of ""basic parts"", grunt suits  and older suits and the like, and should unlock some parts as you play, as well as coming with some gimmick parts so you would not be absolutely required to buy gunpla to play on an equal field, doing so would just give you more options.  So it might come with parts for customization from GMs and Zakus, Jestas and GN-Xs and Balls and the like, and some like the Guntank and Guncannon. You then mix and match parts out of the basic stock, the single parts you get from completing missions or buy with in game credits, and the full suits you unlock by buying the Gunpla, record that suit to you ""core piece"" and swipe the ""core piece"" whenever you want to queue up for multiplayer, or take it to an arcade.  The core pieces could also be built into gunpla, and there would be special events/compititions where you take your Gunpla with a core piece (or just submit a code and pictures), and if the Gunpla you built matches whats recorded on the core piece, you get special bonuses and win prizes.  Sigh~   We can dream, eh?"

Gundam,368jfm,SOLIDninja,2,Sun May 17 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"Something like Star Citizen. Open world, persistent universe in which you control an actual character, not a mobile suit. Your character can get in to any mobile suit, assuming he is cleared/trained for it. Your character can go anywhere in the Earth Sphere.  There is a calendar system, and actions like traveling and sleeping take time; events, like major battles, can occur during that time that affect your situation. (Traveling to Side 5? Battle of Loum breaks out? You arrive to a bunch of space junk.)  Mobile suit controls are fixed from all previous Gundam games. The lock-on system of basically every Gundam game is a horrible joke, because a simple side strafe allows you to dodge bullets and beams. Mobile suit control and firing needs to seriously be improved.  Sense of speed also needs to be improved. Piloting the Sinanju in Gundam Unicorn on PS3 does not feel like you're moving much faster than anyone else. There is no personality to the controls and the environment. That has to be fixed.  Basically, take Star Citizen, program in the Gundam era Earth Sphere, let me pick a date on a calendar to start, from 0079 to 0153, and then let me play however I want."

Gundam,368jfm,Skripe,1 point,Sun May 17 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"I've got some good news for you. You already have multiple options for that type of gameplay right now:  1.) Starcraft - Gundam Century: Another great one for Low-Spec PC Gamers and fans of Starcraft: Brood War. This little Mod we got here for SC: Brood War replaces the Terran w/ the Earth Federation and the Protoss w/ Zeon. Sorry guys, no Wing / SEED / 00 in this one. But either way, it doesn't stop it from being any less fun that it really is. You can find Starcraft: Gundam Century on MODDB.com here:   http://www.moddb.com/mods/gundam-century   Gameplay Here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qge4epRMPfk   2.) C&C Generals - XenoForce 1.5 / C&C 3 - XenoForce Reborn: Being my personal favorite Gundam RTS Game on PC currently, XenoForce currently has 2 Homes. The original mod was for Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour 1.04; which adds 3 New Generals, the Earth Forces General, the Spacenoid General, and the U.N. Spacy General into the game with new units from each faction in the game. The newer version of XenoForce known as XenoForce Reborn currently resides in Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars 1.09 which adds the ""Universal Century"" as a new side; in which case the current version has a Heavy Emphysis on Gundam X so far, but keep in mind that XenoForce Reborn is subject to change in the future and it will add a lot more.  You can find both mods @ MODDB.com at these links:   http://www.moddb.com/mods/xenoforce http://www.moddb.com/mods/xenoforce-reborn   XenoForce 1.5 Gameplay:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b3jR8UNtNc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBAIh4eT_6M https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bBFmycxhI0   3.) Homeworld 2: 0079 - 0083 Mod 3.1 / SEED Mod 3.3: Being one of the greatest RTS Games of All Time, Homeworld 2 has not one, but Two Gundam Mods for it. One that focuses specifically on the Universal Century Timeline Gap of the years 0079 - 0083. The second one focuses on the Cosmic Era; which IIRC the latest version adds in Z.A.F.T. and O.R.B. as playable sides, but no sign of O.M.N.I. yet. Build up your fleet, pump out some mobile suit squadrons, send them into battle against your enemy, and enjoy the fireworks. You can check out the gameplay of each mod here:   0079 - 0083 3.1 Gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RYCVxKxxxA SEED Mod 3.3 Gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7OjbKz5Njk   NOTE: If you're wondering ""Wtf's with the TIE Fighter Sound Effects in Gundam Mod 3.1?"", Don't ask, I have no fucking idea. I questioned the same thing too. But either way, I can dig it. 8)  UPDATE: Apparently, the Gundam 0079 Mod for HW2 has been updated for Homeworld 2 Remastered as of recently as well! =D  4.) Total Annihilation: Spring - Gundam RTS: If you're a fan of Large-Scaled RTS Battles, then this one should definitely catch your attention as well. Set in the Early Years of the Universal Century Timeline of 0079 - 0080, this fan-made Gundam RTS Game on the Total Annihilation: Spring Open Source Engine is extremely fun to play and is basically like a ""Gundam Supreme Commander"" type of game. At this point, this game has been cancelled and discontinued, but it is still up for download if you know where to look. In this case, you can check out the gameplay of it here w/ the Download Link in the description:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVXyOYQxqY   And finally, there's also Mobile Suit Gundam: New Gihren's Greed on the PSP which also has very similar mechanics to what you were looking for as well. It's Turn-Based, but you still have to manage resources, morale, territory, mass-production of troops, etc.... I'd highly recommend it as well! =)"

Gundam,368jfm,WackyModder84,1 point,Sun May 17 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"I think a big problem with Gundam games is there are a lot of audiences the developers try to cater to in different games.  For example, the Gundam Battle series (I have not played assault survive, I just got a vita and am pounding through a few other games first) such as Battle Universe for the PSP and The 3D Battle for the 3DS. Both have huge selections of mobile suits which is awesome, you can play as tons of UC mobile armors, tons of versions of GM's and Zakus.. the prototype rx-78, penelope, psycho, big zam, even the char aznable rx-78, incredible selection. Gives people that follow the series closely a huge boner.  Now, the controls are a little bit eh, and there are lock on and camera issues. Also, of course, the beloved english barrier.. Other games can lack this selection but have better gameplay.   There are a lot of parallels going on here with Dragonball games, every game has the same stories (I only pay attention to UC) and developers seem to sacrifice doing good in one element and instead excelling in just one.   hahahahaha how about a MOBA"

And if you really wanna go balls-out with that, there's also Another Century's Episode 1, 2, 3, R, and PORTABLE as well which are like Armored Core X Zone of the Enders gameplay as well.  In addition, if you're a Gundam Unicorn fan and love Armored Core as well, I'd recommend Mobile Suit Gundam UC for the PS3 as well. It focuses specifically on Episodes 1-3 of Unicorn, since that was all that was out at the time for Unicorn's showing. But it's still fun as fuck to play and plays just like Armored Core / Zone of the Enders. Ontop of all that, it also has A FUCKLOAD of Great DLC Missions available as well and Extra Playable Mobile Suits from all across Unicorn. It's a Gundam Unicorn Fan's wet-dream. Highly Recommend it along with Another Century's Episode as well. =)"

Throw in HD graphics and story mission spanning the UC timeline would be awesome. An updated Giren's Greed type strategy game on PC or console/handheld that would be translated and allow you to play as several characters or factions.  Like other games you could alter the UC timeline and develop several different types of suits and msv-r suits. MMO style game based on Gunpla Build Fighters and Gundam Breaker but with bigger battles and chances for unique terrain, strategies, and more customization and parts.

Gundam,368b6u,WexTheCat,7,Sun May 17 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"If we're talking pilots, Kira is infinitely more talented than Loran.  Loran doesn't seem genetically engineered or more talented as a pilot than anyone else, even in his own show.  He just has more experience with technology than the Earth inhabitants who at best can only work dirigibles and WWI level fighter planes, so Loran just picks up piloting the Turn-A a bit faster.   If we're talking suit specifications, Turn-A is the culmination of ALL technological prowess.  Its very existence caused the Earth to become a wasteland and forced the Earth to revert in technology back to pre-industrial revolution levels.  Who would win would depend on a number of factors, like if it was first sortie vs. first sortie, end-of-Destiny Kira vs. end-of-Turn-A Loran, so-on and so-forth.  Regardless, whatever advantages Kira has as a pilot seem to mostly be nullified when you consider the fact that the Turn-A can survive a nuclear warhead, reflects any and all beams the Strike can produce by using its I-Field, most likely INCLUDING THE AGNI 320 MM HYPER IMPULSE BEAM CANNON, and, well... if those aren't doing damage, nothing on the Strike possibly could other than MAYBE the Armor Schneiders.  So it all comes down to if the composition metal of the Armor Shneiders is strong enough to penetrate the Turn-A with its vibrating motion.  If so, I believe that Kira could possibly outmaneuver Loran and steal a win.  Then again, if pilots mattered, then it's a moot point when you have two bleeding heart pacifists not going at each other's throats because they're bleeding heart pacifists."

He just has more experience with technology than the Earth inhabitants who at best can only work dirigibles and WWI level fighter planes, so Loran just picks up piloting the Turn-A a bit faster.    I really think you are underestimating Loran here. He pulled some amazing shots and moves in the Turn-A while Kira just devolves to spamming his beam attack once he gets the freedom."
Gundam,368b6u,Hagu_TL,2,Sun May 17 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, don't get me wrong.  I hate Kira as much as the next guy.  But he literally zips into melee range, makes multiple precision-point slices in the span of less than a second, and dismantles enemy units without doing any damage to the cockpit.  He has surgical precision in the middle of combat for both melee and ranged attacks.  Let's not forget that if the Turn-A does prove to overpower the Strike due to being the stronger suit, it's very likely that Kira has his own built-in I-Field that's of the same level as the Turn-A's, so he'll be just fine and come back with a better suit later.  He's so overpowered as a pilot that it's boring to watch.  Loran gets his ass kicked constantly by anything and everything that should, by all extents and purposes, be obsolete in comparison to what he's using.  Sochie can pilot the Turn-A just fine.  Joseph was arguably as good at piloting it as Loran was after a day or two.  There's nothing that makes Loran special in his own show compared to anyone else other than that he was born on the moon, and chooses to fight for Earth.  It's tough to accredit him with ""amazing moves"" as well, when there was so little combat in Turn-A to begin with.  He's at best a badass normal in a fight between superpowers.  And I wouldn't even go so far as to call him a badass normal.  There's just no real comparison in pilots here."

Gundam,368tlz,DefrostedTuna,8,Sun May 17 15:16:17 2015 UTC,What is there to hate about 0080?
Gundam,368tlz,OutZoned,5,Sun May 17 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"Al and his annoying friends mostly  I thought the whole plot was wonderfully well written and perfectly executed. The Cyclops Team were awesome, Bernie was awesome, Chris is awesome, but Al really was just as annoying as annoying could be.   I really can't stand characters like him. I also found it frustrating to watch this time (my 3rd time watching it, first time in about 10 years) because I knew what was going to happen. Just really got on my nerves knowing Al was just messing everything up and getting everyone killed. (I completely forgot how annoying he was)  I bet he even led to that poor, drunk woman's failed relationship..."
Gundam,368tlz,DefrostedTuna,16,Sun May 17 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but I disagree.   Al is the reason 0080 has the thematic punch that it does. His friends, stupid as they may be, are the perfect foil to his evolving character. Their purpose is to demonstrate Al's growth from the beginning, when he's naive and enamored by war, to the end, when he understands the true nature of conflict.   The battle between Christina and Bernie has the impact it does because these are two people that Al loves, fighting to the death for no reason at all. It's watching Al, broken and empty as Bernie dies, that gives weight to his sacrifice. The reason the viewer looks up to Bernie is because we see him through Al's perspective, and Al worships Bernie. Bernie is not only the brother he never had, but also the father who was never around.  Al's not only a phenomenal character, but the perfect perspective for driving a narrative about the pointless nature of war. He may be a dumbass in the beginning, but that's only in service of contrasting his transformation into a broken, jaded, shell of a boy.  If you can't tell, I love 0080, haha."
Gundam,368tlz,draivaden,4,Sun May 17 16:43:42 2015 UTC,Well said! I definitely couldn't have said it any better myself.
Gundam,368tlz,draivaden,2,Sun May 17 18:45:12 2015 UTC,"Despite my issues with Al, I completely agree that the story just wouldn't be the same without him. The more I think about it the more I did kind of overlook those aspects with his relationship with Bernie. I kinda got the brother bit, but the missing father figure was something I completely missed. (I think there is a lot in common with Al and Bernie as well which makes their actions and relationship a lot more interesting)  0080 does have a lot to appreciate about it, it has a lot of depth for such a short series. I feel as if I may have overlooked a lot of the subtle details just because I was so annoyed. In hindsight I am noticing more thinking about it than when I watched it.  I kinda wish I didn't get so bothered by Al as a character. Because you are completely right that the story driven from his perspective is really what makes the show work (and as I said, it was done brilliantly). A show about a conflict involving a special ops team trying to destroy a prototype gundam wouldn't have had so much to say about war as 0080 did. I mean it could have, but I guess coming from an innocent kids perspective you have a more crushing blow of reality. (I mean it was a very gritty show as well, the blending of innocence and violence was really well balanced and well done)  Even more sad is the fact Bernie was quite the pilot, that ending was really worth putting up with Al."

Most of these possibilities concluded in the pilot's death and nobody responds well to being faced with their own death.  3) Haven't seen Reconguista yet.  4) Kira's main area of studies was operating systems for smaller mobile suits so he had a level of experience in what a mobile suit OS should look like.  Easiest to control is probably something mass produced like a GM, Jegan, Leo, etc.  Most unwieldy would be anything highly customized like The O,  anything with a psycommu system like  Qubeley, or anything super high performance like F91/V2."

Gundam,367r6x,shinianx,1 point,Tue May 19 03:16:41 2015 UTC,"From the Messala's wikia article: ""Originally the Messala was used to fly in the atmosphere of Jupiter and thus it was equipped with powerful thrusters to fly under Jupiter’s high gravitational pull.

There isn't any reason that a combat mobile suit in that timeframe would be launching in Jupiter's atmosphere.  There is nothing to fight in Jupiter's atmosphere.  At that time, the Jupiter Fleet was basically unchallenged.  There is no settlement in Jupiter's atmosphere, any ship there collecting Helium3 isotopes would have to descend into the atmosphere, and then return to orbit, and any mobile suit launching from the ship would be launching toward what goal?  Even if there were pirates, or opposition forces to face, it would make less than no sense at all for them to engage a target in the atmosphere rather than in orbit.  The whole Jupiter's Gravity reasoning is just a convenient way to explain away advanced tech."

Gundam,367r6x,BloodBride,6,Sun May 17 02:17:38 2015 UTC,"Reconguista is probably the easiest to operate, not because people there seem to be pretty incompetent, but because all the controls are now the same from maintenance robots to Lucifer G. Remember how many times Bellri would say ""Standard Controls"". Their level of standardization in that era far exceeds Anaheim's standardization. (the only outlier even is Yggdrasil which is a Mobile Armor requiring four-ish people to operate.)  That said then, Early UC Era probably has one of the harder suits to fully pilot as it's still divided into two manufacturers, things get significantly easier once Anaheim started monopoly. (but this doesn't automatically make things easier to pilot across armies as Zeon and EF still have different specs until 0096) It is shown however that a young Char was able to ""drive"" an Early Type Guntank at 3x the speed. While the controls seem similar to a truck or a char (that even kids in arcades can pick up on), it might hint how standardized EF controls already are at that point. (note EF always puts ""Mass Production"" on forefront, Zeon focuses more on individuals).  Going outside of UC Era...I'm not good outside of UC Era. xD BF though seems to be similar to an arcade machine with an ability to bring up keyboard(s) to control remote weapons manually. This can be seen when Saga Adou switched to manual Fang control and Shia during repairs. I don't recall any other instance of showing this control. The Embody System and Assimilation seems to be pretty similar, in that it pays homage to Psycommu systems and/or Trace System (or both at the same time). I don't think it would make a Gunpla harder to pilot though, easier most likely. The pain doesn't seem to be a 1:1 proportion to Gunpla Damage (or else we should see Sei completely limp)."
Gundam,367r6x,irishking44,1 point,Sun May 17 01:35:43 2015 UTC,"Oh okay! I forgot about the I think it's ""Universal Standard"" but that definitely makes sense in regards to Reconguista. I've actually seen very little of UC Gundam series (pretty much only Unicorn) so all of that information was new to me and it looks like from the discussion that the BF control system probably ranks among the easier to pilot. After all in the series they do show even really young kids using the system and the analogy to arcade controls seems really accurate."
Gundam,367r6x,BloodBride,4,Sun May 17 14:14:03 2015 UTC,I'd have to go with the SEED Gundams before their OS was rewritten. Mwu mentions that the designated pilots could barely get the things to move.

But how can that be, you say, given that it's quite literally taking your body motions and interpreting them into commands for the Mobile Fighter? Simple! The Mobile Trace system is practically unusable by anyone who isn't in great physical condition, and would probably kill roughly half the population if they just tried to put on the suits. Besides that, you need to have ridiculous levels of combat training even prior to getting in the Mobile Fighter in order to use it properly, at which point you are at the base level of acceptable pilot performance. Then there's the fact that you have to deal with a pain feedback interface, when everyone is throwing flaming dragon fists, revolver punches and giant spinning metal balls at you. Good luck."

Gundam,367r6x,Nunu_Dagobah,3,Thu May 21 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"Your standered units like zakus, gms, jegans, leos would be most easy as they are designed for soldiers to use in combat. Some gundams must be easy to operate as teenagers that probably have no drivers license some how can operate them.  Difficulty would go to more advance machines like Wing Zero, possibly the Unicorn, the g-gundams. Those seem to be set for only a select few to be able to handle them."
Gundam,367r6x,KiraYamatoZG,2,Sun May 17 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"The issue in original series era was that each MS had a unique cockpit design, meaning that if you were promoted from Zaku pilot to Dom pilot, you're going to need adjustment time to use it properly - this lead to a lot of pilots being lost due to not having time to adjust before hitting the front lines. This is why the ones from 0080 (a zaku, dom and gelgoog variant) all shared a standardised cockpit - the idea was that then any pilot could use any type of suit."
Gundam,367r6x,Nunu_Dagobah,1 point,Sun May 17 09:31:05 2015 UTC,So it looks like EFSF MS's are for the most part probably easier to pilot than Zeon MS's since it seems like the EFSF is more likely to prioritize standardization than Zeon is (another poster in this topic already wrote this just re-iterating as my understanding)
Gundam,367r6x,KiraYamatoZG,2,Sun May 17 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"That was the Federation's advantage - Everything they made was essentially a GM, so it handled about the same. Less adaptation to different machines. Zeon however did... TONS of stuff. Lots of different cockpits with different controls and it took time to learn. So by the end of the war, most Zeon pilots were dead or re-learning how to fight, while the Federation pilots, regardless of machine, were more or less experienced, making them a good match for the Zeon forces due to the fact most of the Ace pilots were dead now."
Gundam,367r6x,Nunu_Dagobah,2,Sun May 17 15:09:56 2015 UTC,"I know it's not a mobile suit, but Mu Laflaga's Mobile Armor at the beginning of seed with all of the gun pods flying around seems impossibly difficult even if he had coordinator levels of spatial awareness and piloting aptitude"

Gundam,368b4s,AleksVin,2,Sun May 17 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm just warning either way.  But regardless, here they are:   The original 5 Gundams have completely new looks to them with new weapons and abilities. And Wing Zero (TV) and Wing Zero (EW) now are two entirely different Gundams instead of just two versions of the same Gundam. Wing Zero (TV) is now called Wing Gundam Proto Zero, and Wing Zero (EW) is now just Wing Gundam Zero. If you want pictures of all the new mobile suit designs present in Glory of Losers, I would be happy to oblige. A lot of incidences are handled differently and sometimes in a different order. The New Edwards Base Attack is the prime example. This one is Completely Different from the anime in every way possible. In this one, Relena and Vice Foreign Minister Darlian are actually attending Marshall Noventa's Conference at the New Edwards Base with Marquis Weiridge. The base gets attacked by the 5 Gundams as you expect, but this time, Marshall Noventa actually gets on the radio and tries to negotiate with the Gundam Pilots and asks them why they're attacking them when all they want is peace. The Gundam Pilots respond one by one and all call bullshit on this by saying shit like ""Really? If that's the case, then why did you guys do (X) to (Insert Colony Name Here) if that's the case?"" Marshall Noventa is SHOCKED upon hearing all of this, and has a Blue-Screen-Of-Death Moment just processing everything he's hearing, as he had absolutely no idea that any of that ever took place. After revealing that, Treize gets on the mic and says to the Gundam Pilots ""I am your true enemy."" Duo, Wufei, Quatre and Trowa then proceed to defend Marshall Noventa's Shuttle as it launches. Unfortunately, Heero wasn't present when all of this took place, and he was not informed or aware of what's going on. So he still ends up slicing Noventa's Shuttle in half. Ontop of that, in the anime, they decide to detonate the base's Large Missiles. This is completely changed entirely, and in Glory of Losers they instead decide to fire a MASSIVE Missile from Orbit at the New Edwards Base, and Heero has to stop it before it gets there. While all of this is happening, the building that Relena, Marquis, and Darlian are in gets hit and the ceiling was about to collapse on Relena, but Darlian pushes her out of the way just in time. But unfortunately gets crushed. Yes, I shit you not. Darlian's death is now merged with the Battle of New Edwards. And he still tells Relena the truth about her real name just as you'd expect. With all that aside, the point I'm making here is that a lot of events are handled differently, and even better. We now get to see more backstory for the 5 main characters, giving them a bit more dimension. We finally get an explanation about why Wufei calls his Gundam ""Nataku"". I'll let you read up on it if you wanna know.   Now, don't gemme wrong. It doesn't fix all of Gundam Wing's problems by any means.   The ""peace through force"" bullshit is an obvious contradiction. Relena Peacecraft is still an obnoxiously annoying Mary Sue. The Exposition Announcer Dude is still there; but in Text-Form. The Mobile Suits weighing 4-9 Metric Tons still makes Absolutely No Fucking Sense whatsoever. The Buster Rifles of Wing Gundam, Proto Zero, and Wing Zero are still complete bullshit in how they work and make no fucking sense at all.   But overall, even despite this, it's still a Considerable Improvement over the original without question.  Any Questions? =)"

After all, Gundam Wing was mediocre at best, with some parts that were good, handful of great moments. It just doesn't hold up overall, and the only people that like it are Americans who saw it on television when they were young. Talk about the power of nostalgia and extreme biased opinion in saying that there is nothing wrong with Wing, when it actually has more flaws than the majority of over gundam show. Nevertheless, In my honest opinion, I feel that a new Wing animation could fix many issues in the show. It shouldn't end the way it did and there is much more to tell."

Gundam,364qpl,The_Draigg,10,Sat May 16 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. In the latter half of the Universal Century, armor technology would advance far enough to be resistant to beam weapons from the earlier part of UC. (An example being the knuckle-buster beam cannon of the Gaza-C splitting against the shields of Jegans in Gundam Unicorn.) I believe that same resistance also applied to ballistic weapons, considering that the initial type of lunar titanium used in the RX-79 series was already resistant to the 120mm hyper rifles of the Zaku line."
Gundam,364qpl,Gfaqshoohaman,5,Sat May 16 03:19:38 2015 UTC,How do you think the skills of a pilot would factor into this?
Gundam,364qpl,Gfaqshoohaman,29,Sat May 16 03:24:21 2015 UTC,"None, because the average pilot doesn't have a mobile suit made of plot armor, or space hippie magic on his/her side."

Gundam,364qpl,CaptainJesusNFriends,-1,Mon May 18 12:16:35 2015 UTC,"What about unicorn, that relies on the pilot for strength?"
Gundam,364qpl,starcolored,8,Mon May 18 16:15:08 2015 UTC,"The Crossbone Vanguard's mobile suits pretty much stomped the decades-old Jegans in F91, but even so a weapon is a weapon and they lost a small number of their own units as well. So of course an old MS can defeat a new one, but it will be at a severe disadvantage when faced with the higher maneuverability and firepower of a miniaturized MS, especially if we're talking about a OYW-era MS which the newer MS would just be flying circles around. The thickness of your armor is also mostly irrelevant when you have a beam shield."
Gundam,364qpl,VicisSubsisto,5,Sat May 16 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"If you can dodge a wrenchbeam you can dodge a ballbullet.  Besides which, the older, slower MS with heavy and non-beam-proofed armor would be a sitting duck for a more agile, beam-equipped suit."
Gundam,364qpl,Amuro_Ray,4,Sat May 16 04:15:54 2015 UTC,If it can land a hit...  Fun fact the ZZ has the most powerful (energy rating wise) animated cannon in UC.
Gundam,364qpl,Hiei2k7,1 point,Sat May 16 10:54:30 2015 UTC,ZZ was the last non-psychoframed unit wasn't it?
Gundam,364qpl,Not_a_Zaku,1 point,Sat May 16 21:51:59 2015 UTC,Only a handful of suits using psychoframes exist and they're all from CCA and Unicorn.  F91 and Crossbone's big innovation was the biocomputer and Victory had the Minovsky Flight system.
Gundam,364qpl,Amuro_Ray,1 point,Sat May 16 23:19:25 2015 UTC,Minovsky flight not being anything like the Biocomputer or the pyscommu family which were used to improve new type(and sometimes oldtype) pilots ability to control the suit.
Gundam,364qpl,Amuro_Ray,1 point,Mon May 18 14:09:37 2015 UTC,Not exactly. It was one of the last newtype specific suits. The biocomputer in f91 and 97 was for newtypes and oldtypes
Gundam,364qpl,faikwansuen,4,Sat May 16 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"I mean sure, if the older suit had the jump and surprised the newer suit.  But if it was a both pilots fully aware, full on engagement, the Late UC suit would probably fly circles around that poor slow fucker and dodge every bullet that came his way.  That said, it's possible that Late UC suits are possibly very susceptible to explosions. You might be able to dodge a bullet, but a big explosion's blast radius maybe not. With the lack of extra armor, you can expect explosion shrapnel to go right through and cause damage."
Gundam,364qpl,draivaden,3,Sat May 16 10:57:32 2015 UTC,"i seem to recall Zeon oldsmobile army (mars), holding htere own for a abit against the f90 series in one of the mangas...  Also, as seen in Unicorn, older mobile suits can hold their own against newer ones, atleast as of 0096..  BUT they had a very large element of surprise, and one the Federation forces  had organized the older machines were routed by a smaller force (i.e. only a few fed suits launched successfully, but they still won)"
Gundam,364qpl,GrandmasterKirbs,5,Sat May 16 03:34:29 2015 UTC,"The Oldsmobile army were using new tech tbough. The mobile suit designs were just done in homage to the early OYW Zeon MS. For example the Dom RF used a beam bazooka, beam Saber and it's spray gun was replaced with a beam machine gun. Unlike the dom, which was built before the Zeon had access to beam technology."
Gundam,364qpl,VoiceofMalice,3,Sat May 16 06:02:43 2015 UTC,I am certain a older MS CAN defeat a newer ms. However if it will or not all depends on the situation. In an ambush and surprise attacks certainly.(as seen in some of the shows ZZ comes to mind) Though in an even fight it would become more and more likely that the newer MS would dominate the suit. Not to say that if if you had alot of the older suits it couldn't swap the outcome.
Gundam,364qpl,RyuNoKami,2,Sat May 16 04:53:30 2015 UTC,late UC mobile suits pretty much all have beam shields which completely negates ballistic weaponry. Can a older ms beat a newer mobile suit? see a historical battle between old tech vs new tech and then same types of forces just later on  you need a shit ton of luck and some element of suprise.
Gundam,364qpl,Farfener,2,Sat May 16 05:50:03 2015 UTC,"The attack on Torrington would seem to suggest that yes, Early UC suits can destroy later UC suits. But that battle made clear that it takes a lot of effort (just look at how much of a pounding it took to take down that one guncannon) and that eventually age will catch up to them."
Gundam,364qpl,Hellowz,2,Sat May 16 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"Any mobile suit with a biosensor or a pscyommu/psycoframe system has the potential of beating a late UC MS, it would require a strong newtype piloting it though"
Gundam,364qpl,arcangelxvi,2,Sun May 17 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think that there's an argument that can be made for mid UC mobile suits being significantly better armed than Late UC suits in that they have more powerful beam weapons available as well as funnels. To that effect, I would argue that funnel and incom based weaponry are the trump card that they have against anything before and after. The problem is that for funnels to be effective you need very specific pilots. Take that away, and the tactical advantages of late UC mobile suits such as high speed and maneuverability give them a more distinct advantage."
Gundam,364qpl,Klumpmeister,5,Wed May 20 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe if Christina Mackenzie was piloting the Late UC Gundam, an older suit could possibly win."
Gundam,364qpl,Onyx_Blackmen,1 point,Sat May 16 05:14:02 2015 UTC,"That doesn't seem to be a fair argument, but given what we have seen, I can't honestly argue with you on it."

Gundam,364xte,ShinnAssuka,8,Sat May 16 04:29:55 2015 UTC,"My theory is that Destiny is from Athrun's perspective (Fukuda has said that Athrun is the star and the compilation movies reflect it more) and characters/events based on how he viewed them. Shinn's brattiness is emphasized because that's how Athrun saw him (this explains why his behavior is toned down in SRW, DWG and other crossover games. Those are a neutral view of Shinn, the ""true"" Shinn according to his VA), or how Cagalli lost her will because that's how Athrun viewed her when she let ORB join the EA.  Granted, sometimes this requires getting information from second-hand sources. The events surrounding Durandal's death are what Kira told him had happened afterwards. ""Yeah, Rey was so moved by my words he decided to fight for us. He killed Durandal and then decided to die with him. Talia too. She decided to die with him as well. You have to trust me, honest. That's what really happened."""
Gundam,364xte,Char_X_3,1 point,Sat May 16 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"Athrun's perspective is pretty messed up, then. Athrun more or less, abandoned Caggali, so the blame can't fall entirely on her. But wasn't Kira being the only one there, retconned in the Special Edition, where Athrun is also present in the confrontation?  That 5-way confrontation was the worst, most contrived, ending to any Gundam series.  It made no sense for Rey to turn on Durandell over some words from Kira."

Gundam,36072j,draivaden,-2,Fri May 15 01:11:10 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense. But that still leaves the 00 Gundam. According to Gundam Wikia, the GN Drive's power plant is a Baryonic Matter. I looked up what a Baryon was and according to Wikpedia, it's something very complicate that I can't even bother to read and try to decipher..LOL  Anyway, that Gundam Wikia article lists the GN Drive as being able to output 938.2 MeV per Baryonic Decay so I guess for 00 Gundam, we would just double that so it'd be 1876.4 MeV per Baryonic Decay?   Does anyone know what that is in kW?"

Gundam,36072j,ShinyMetalBum,1 point,Fri May 15 02:16:53 2015 UTC,Dude I spent a few hours trying to answer that question. It's math that's way above my head. What I get from reading is that basically it has a nearly unlimited energy output so long as its not pushed to it's maximum. So theoretically the longer it's on the more power it generates.
Gundam,36072j,iNViSiBiLiTi,1 point,Fri May 15 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"1,000,000 electron volts (eV) = 1 mega electron volt (MeV)   1 MeV = 0.000000000000000000045 kilowatt hours (kWh)   = 4.5 x 10-20 kWh  That is a very small amount, which shouldn't be surprising since baryons are very small.  So unless you can provide what the rate of baryon decay is (ie. How many particles decay in the drives per hour), it's kind of hard to know what the total output is.

Gundam,35w421,Hellowz,15,Thu May 14 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"It ultimately doesn't matter whether the Unicorn is the strongest MS or how OP it is. Its power stems from the pilot's Newtype abilities (given that it's a result of the Psycoframe and there's otherwise nothing special about the MS itself), and by the time you reach a state advanced enough to do the things that make it OP you also understand that fighting is pointless. In other words anybody powerful enough to fully utilize the Unicorn or more accurately a psycoframe wouldn't use it to fight. The Unicorn is a metaphor, after all. In mythology only the pure of heart could tame one.  The Zeta was equipped with less advanced technology and Kamille was arguably a less powerful Newtype, or at the very least in a less powerful state, so it's only natural that it would take more to do less."

And I don't even know what a ""perfected newtype"" is, and I bet neither does Riddhe. He spent the majority of the show going full emo mode over Audrey after barely meeting her, and then he proposed... So I don't trust his judgement.

The offices that sell to Neo Zeon are generally located on the far side of the moon farthest from Anaheim's own headquarters. They were also mostly offices that former Zeon MS company staff were relocated to after One Year War.

If they were invested in one particular side very strongly I'm sure we wouldn't see it play out like this, but their neutrality helps in that respect (or hurts depending on your viewpoint)."

Gundam,35wnii,autowikiabot,1 point,Thu May 14 04:51:06 2015 UTC,The first option. Something attached onto the mobile suit I cry.
Gundam,35wnii,CidImmacula,5,Thu May 14 05:12:52 2015 UTC,"bit/funnel/remote weapon predictability is completely based on the pilot's level of skill.  Amuro's Fin Funnels are pretty ""unpredictable"" because he's a relatively powerful Newtype with an incredible amount of time on the battlefield. (Hence, Char's bits would also be in the same vein. Sazabi having slightly harder to spot Bits as they are about 1/4 the size of a Fin Funnel, but Char is the weaker Newtype)  00 Bits are computer controlled by the Haro System (iirc, too lazy to recheck wiki) so they would be as predictable as, well, the computer itself. A.L.I.C.E. might also be in the same vein with its reflector bits, but it's also in the UC timeline iirc hence can be considered another Newtype weapon.  Outside of Computer-Controlled bits, you only have Psycommu and Kira Yamato as human controlled remote weapons. Kira probably falling short of Lelouch Lamperouge in manipulating that many units, but is still pretty significant for discussion. (the only other person who would probably manually control bits without Newtype capabilities is...whoever was riding Providence.)  Now in Firepower, Amuro's Fin Funnels would actually fall short to almost every single Remote Controlled weapon past UC0100. Bit Missiles actually being doable and can be devastating around Penelope's time. In Firepower, FX-9900, aka GX Bits, would probably be the strongest. These come from Gundam X, and are basically copies of Gundam X, all equipped with a Satellite Cannon. That's like, having Wing Gundam rifle bits, or worse. Luckily they also need to be in view of the moon to recharge...but still, one shot would be more than enough to sink multiple carriers. Kshtraya's bits are no joke as well, a little more efficient than Fin Funnels, but its power is amplified by it's ability to swarm. Neo Zeong also has wired bits with incredibly high powered lasers, that makes it stronger per shot than Fin Funnel, is more energy efficient, is and is powered by a relatively powerful Cyber Newtype (Full Frontal). Then you have the not-supposed-to-be-remote-weapons in the guise of Unicorn's Shields. While not as powerful per shot than a Fin Funnel it:   Uses a Beam Gatling for an armament, can drown anything in beam fire Is equipped with a mini I-Field generator. Just one of them is enough to provide cover compared to Fin Funnels needing a minimum of 3 In it's Full Armor configuration, comes in 3.   Amuro's Fin Funnels is good, but is far from the ""best"", strictly technologically and newtypemagic speaking anyway."
Gundam,35wnii,BoyGodz,3,Thu May 14 05:24:50 2015 UTC,"Fun fact, unless you are in low orbital ring and at the exact opposite side of the moon, you are almost guaranteed to see the moon in space, especially at the distance from Earth to the Lagrange points where most space fighting happens, the Earth is too small for a direct blocking to happen often enough for us to care. It is a unique and neat setting for the majority of the Gundam X series where the story take place on Earth, but in reality and in space, it is hardly a hold back for a weapon with such destructive power. So if G-bits count as remote weapons and not Mobile Dolls with Gundam 01's rifle, there is no way any bits/funnel/fangs would beat them."
Gundam,35wnii,CaptainJesusNFriends,1 point,Thu May 14 06:46:25 2015 UTC,"I know Amuro's funnels also have generators in them, and they can make shields. I think in practicality they're pretty high up."

Gundam,35tsqv,Farfener,2,Wed May 13 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"This is a good point. The main reason I focused on the Zaku is that, despite being obsolete, it never was greatly damaged.   His Z'Gok and his Gelgoog both at least lost an arm, with whatever implications that carries with the internal mechanics and repairability. Obviously the Zeong was toast.   I guess is just as good of a guess as any that the one in ZZ was his though."

Everything you need to know about it is explained during the course of the story. you even get a UC history primer in 60 seconds or less in the first episode.   LPT; if a story requires knowledge of other works to make sense, then it is not a very good story. Unicorn stands on it on. True, you MAY get more pleasure out of it if you can understand the cornucopia of references in it, but the story stands on it and is really enjoyable.  Eg: The StarWars prequels cant (or can, just a very tiny barely) stand as a story without the knowledge of what happens in the original trilogy."

If a story cannot stand on its on merits, then it is not a very good story, regardless of whether or not it is related to any other works. This does not mean that it must be completed decoupled from the other works, only that it should be able to be understood and enjoyed without knowledge of the other works. Which Unicorn can be, quiet successfully.    but you go so far as to say that it is inherently bad when a show/movie doesn't recap the last in favor of progression?    I say no such gun-damn thing.

Gundam,35oc8h,LightningEagle7,-10,Tue May 12 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I actually think it makes sense to compare Pacific Rim to Evangelion, before any other mecha show. First, it's building-sized mechs versus building-sized kaijū. Second, neural control is a huge part of the piloting system.  Sure, ""original mech show"" is uncalled for, and the tone is nothing like Eva's (the tone is more Independence Day than anything else), but in terms of ""what's it about in one sentence?"", I think Eva is the work closest to Pacific Rim.  And the ""not really mecha"" thing doesn't really matter."
Gundam,35oc8h,Terminimal,19,Tue May 12 06:25:06 2015 UTC,"Nope. Pacific Rim has nothing to do with Evangelion. However, it is EXACTLY Gunbuster, plus elements of Giant Robo and Mazinger Z.  Off the top of my head:   ill-fated robot program designed to save humanity becomes overwhelmed with an enemy that keeps getting not only more powerful, but physically larger commander or coach is dying of space aids humanity comes up with a last ditch effort to save humanity- a huge bomb the focus on pairing up team members and the mix of rookies and aces the scene where the kaiju arrive sooner than expected mirrors the close-range warp the aliens use at the end of Gunbuster   Even the pacing and story arcs in Pacific Rim are extremely similar to Gunbuster. I could go on and on with that list, if I took out a note pad while watching the blu-ray I would probably hit 30 big similarities between Pacific Rim and Gunbuster."

Gundam,35oc8h,CybranKNight,3,Tue May 12 10:43:13 2015 UTC,"It's just because I've seen dozens of commenters compare PacRim to Eva, and every time dozens of commenters say, ""You can't compare it to Eva just because it has robots, what about Gundam/Mazinger/Tetsujin 28.""  I'm not saying those PacRim-Eva comparisons are at all insightful, just that everyone else might be missing why people are so quick to compare it to Eva rather than anything older. Being filthy casuals who know nothing about mecha beyond Eva might be a big part of it, but there's more."
Gundam,35oc8h,Terminimal,-2,Tue May 12 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"To say that Pacific Rim doesn't borrow from a lot of mecha would be disingenuous.   The global initiative, psychological state of the pilots being important, and fate of the world is in balance under threat of beings we don't fully understand is very comparable to Evangelion.  Who is most correct is a matter of opinion as you can pick and choose comparisons.  That being said,  a live action Evangelion would be brutally awesome to watch but probably would be hard to do justice."
Gundam,35oc8h,Ragefield,4,Tue May 12 14:05:57 2015 UTC,"To say that Pacific Rim doesn't borrow from a lot of mecha would be disingenuous.   Well then it's a good thing I never said that then eh? The fact is that it does pull inspiration form a lot of sources, to the point where you can't point to any one of them and say ""It's like that one"" because it sets up false expecations.

While they may not have directly taken inspiration from Evangelion or other mecha, there are common elements.

The original and first series, Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 took place during the same conflict between the Earth Federation and the cluster of colonies known as Side 3 (aka Zeon).  http://i.imgur.com/hXx4R00.jpg  Browse through if you want to get a short synopsis on each series, and where you would like to go from where you are now."
Gundam,35rv20,Gfaqshoohaman,1 point,Wed May 13 00:40:09 2015 UTC,Thanks that synopsis helps a lot!
Gundam,35rv20,Zonetr00per,2,Wed May 13 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, so 08MS fits into the general 'Universal Century' meta-series, all of which take place in the same continuity. Check out the /m/ guide to Gundam in the FAQ for general info on others and what order to watch them in for continuity.  If you don't care about continuity and just want to pick up another series, I suggest 0083 Stardust Memory. It has many of the same pros and cons as 08th MS and I suspect you'll enjoy it as well. The downside is, coming in without context of the rest of the Universal Century may leave you confused at some points in 0083 as it connects two prior series (the original MSG and MSZG) and all but demands pre-existing knowledge of the setting."
Gundam,35rv20,OhUmHmm,1 point,Wed May 13 00:42:53 2015 UTC,Thanks that helps a lot! I think I am gonna watch the first series then see from there Gfaqshoohaman 's image link helped a lot paired with your push towards certain series!
Gundam,35rv20,wavyhairedsamurai,1 point,Wed May 13 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"After the original, if you want more, I would push for 0083 as well.    If you find yourself completely turned off by the animation in the original (it's a bit dated), they compiled the series into 3 movies.  I think the ending is a bit different but you can probably google the differences.    I would also recommend ""Gundam - The Origin"" both the comic and the animation (only 1 released so far), which is a slight retelling of the original series."
Gundam,35rv20,wavyhairedsamurai,2,Wed May 13 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"Yo, I just got into Gundam a few months ago and I watched 08th first like you.   If you want the big picture of Gundam, I'd suggest watching the original series. It's older than 08th, I say that as a but of a front because it really does seem dated at times. There's 3 movies that compile the original and I watched those and really enjoyed them. I believe 08th takes place at the same time/same timeline as the original, so it wouldn't be a huge leap.  As far as other Gundam series you could watch go, there's the more standalone ones like G, Wing, and 00."
Gundam,35rv20,wavyhairedsamurai,1 point,Wed May 13 00:56:29 2015 UTC,Cool thanks bro I am gonna watch the original then go from there! Pretty funny that we started on the 08th! My dad got it for me when I was a little kid but somehow I only saw the first half. Man was that crazy to go back see all shit I liked then see more of something that I thought ended shortly.
Gundam,35rv20,wavyhairedsamurai,2,Wed May 13 01:24:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I just heard it didn't need any prior knowledge and it got me very interested in the rest of the series. This giant war between the Federation and Zeon had me very intrigued and I'm glad I watched more because it was great.

Gundam,35q46r,SonuNova,1 point,Tue May 12 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"There is a novel in two installments, by Tomino, but there's probably no fan translation.  There's also a SNES game which can be emulated with a completed translation patch floating around somewhere. It's got a story to it.  Others mentioned F90, Silhouette Formula, and Crossbone. Really, I'd consider Crossbone to be ""after"" the F91 era, like what Zeta is to First Gundam, while F90, the SNES game, and Silhouette Formula would be like One Year War OVAs. Crossbone has an entirely different feel, even in the first installment where Tomino is onboard."

Gundam,35px7c,versona,1 point,Tue May 12 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"Directly import from Japanese store would be cheaper due to favorable exchange rate. e.g. 1 2  Reviews: http://blog.livedoor.jp/hacchaka/archives/51944789.html http://gamu-toys.info/gangu/gff/mc12/mc1201.html http://gamu-toys.info/gangu/gff/mc12/mc1202.html  It's about 1:100 and is very similar to MG Unicorn in transformation and articulation. I would say the negative is the poor display stand cannot support the weight securely in any flying pose.  Bandai fixed that with better stand in the metal build line but didn't bother to include that in refreshed GFFMC Unicorns.  On top of that all Banshee Norn MGs are limited release so that option is also quite expensive, but still cheaper than a GFFMC."

But unlike Metal Build Exia which has armor swapping feature, the GFFMC Unicorn is almost completely covered by plastic so we can't be certain unless we destroy it.  By memory, my GFFMC Unicorn is just as heavy as the other Metal Builds I have."
Gundam,35px7c,ChallyIITES,1 point,Tue May 12 22:28:46 2015 UTC,Less than a well built HG. Better than a HG slapped together with no decals.  It's made out of PVC (the white plastic pipe stuff) and doesn't have the sharp edges that plastic has. It can also be prone to warpage over time from persistant high heat.

Gundam,35ovjz,Yuvienco,3,Tue May 12 19:24:34 2015 UTC,I lean towards that opinion as well but at least some closure on the characters would have been much appreciated (Whether that be Feldt-Setsuna or Marina-Setsuna)
Gundam,35ovjz,NoctyrneSAGA,0,Wed May 13 14:57:52 2015 UTC,The manga version of the movie shipped Marina and Setsuna apparently.
Gundam,35ovjz,Mayomori,8,Tue May 12 19:57:24 2015 UTC,I would suggest a better ending to put some emphasize on the closing of the 00 characters at least.

Gundam,35ovjz,RJWalker,8,Tue May 12 15:29:56 2015 UTC,I'd start with giving Descartes Shaman an actual role in the movie. Goddamn.
Gundam,35ovjz,NoctyrneSAGA,4,Tue May 12 09:52:23 2015 UTC,"Emphasize more about Kim's misinterpretation of the ELS as hostile and Descartes Shaman's resentment at being treated as a lab rat. The movie for the most part would have sent the Understanding message across better if it weren't for the pacing.   Kim's skirmish with the ELS made him think that the ELS were a threat to humanity which is why he ends up sending out the alert. I think the significance of this act needed to be expanded upon to show this is where Earth starts to arm itself out of fear.  We're only barely clued in to Descartes being treated poorly for his rank only because he's something new. Aside from Descartes tugging at his restraints, Mannequin demanding he be treated his rank, and the singular ""I'm going to take my anger out on you!"" we barely get to see just how much Descartes hated being seen as something other than human. And still during combat he seems to consider himself a soldier with him denying that it was truly friendly fire since the ship was already assimilated. This resentment is key because it was what made Descartes fail to initiate a dialogue with the ELS. The only time he's allowed to walk around is for combat and it's really his only chance to vent his anger. Of course he'd end up treating the ELS as punching bags instead of sentient life forms. This mistake is costly because it perpetuates the belief that the ELS are hostile.  Had Shaman utilized VEDA and tried to communicate instead of fight, the movie would probably have ended much earlier. But that would never happen because of his pent up anger. Shaman's background and emotions definitely need more exposition and development.  I would also change it so that the federation suits switch over to older Red GN Particles to combat ELS regeneration by causing cellular defects, or perhaps overloaded Trans-Am particle bands had the same effect. That way, the hole Graham created could actually reasonably stay open for Setsuna."

Gundam,35ovjz,strikeraiser,2,Tue May 12 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"Probably split the movie into 2 parts instead to make room for better plot and character development, especially the new ones like Descartes and that Nena Trinity reincarnation(they never even explained why the hell does she look 99% close to Nena).  Also to give the Raphael and 00 Qan [T] more action and screen time. I am really dying to see more of what the Quanta can do in terms of destruction. Harute and Zabanya completely stole the spotlight.  Also to give more deeper progress and meaning behind the romance developments in the movie like FeldtxSetuna(OTP) and TieriaXThatOneGirlOnThePtolemyThatICan'tRememberTheName.

Setsuna who wanted to embody the ideal of the 00-series Gundams: World Peace. Who was the person who understood him most? Marina Ismail. And what did she give him, to symbolise their shared ideal? That flower he always kept on his Gundam.   So the ELS understanding of humans and their decision to make peace in humans' terms was symbolised by a huge flower.   I really didn't think it was that abstract, maybe you just skipped all of Marina's scenes. which would be totally understandable tbh"

Later on they experimented with more ""spinoff"" series that still have Gundams but are not directly connected to the ones before. 00 is one of those spinoffs.  0079 is just another way to say the ""Original Mobile Suit Gundam""  Zeta is the sequel to 0079, and ZZ is the sequel to Zeta.

Or perhaps, the entire Universal Century in order of release, and then the other timelines in order of release.  If you think you might want to back out if it turns out not to be your thing, which is fairly sensible, you might want to pick an OVA or a newer series, or start with the First Gundam compilation films instead of the First Gundam series. I dunno about watching the films first, I've heard that's a bad decision and haven't seen them myself.

I know Newtypes are never really explained but the most powerful among them(Amuro, Kamille, Lalah, Scirocco) all showed through much more than Char. I'm not trying to downplay Char at all, he's my favorite character of the entire series, but also a very complicated man.  Or maybe I just don't want the last words of such a badass character to be a cry for his mommy..."

They are each weaker in the opposite areas.   They balance each other.   As for this line, I think it very well could mean that she could clear his mind better. Maybe make him see the true enemies of the Universal Century much more quickly, maybe make him an even more potent person.   However, psychic bonds being what they are, it was probably muddied due to Amuros presence, and then her death crushed all hopes of that being a possibility."

Gundam,35m7qe,MurasaKiso,4,Mon May 11 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"At first, i thought much the same. But, I later thought about it more. To Loran, Dianna was more than just a Queen to him, more like a goddess almost. At the end of the series, he saw her as a human, a real person. In addition, in my head, after Dianna dies of her cryo-sickness, Loran goes and lives with Sochie. But that last part is just in my head."

Gundam,35m7qe,NMR3,1 point,Mon May 11 18:17:11 2015 UTC,To Sunbro and sdwoodchuck: I do know that (she dies soon). I did understand why Loran went with her and I do think that Loran went to live with Sochie (and probably got married with her later on) after Dianna passes out. Thing is... why he didn't took Sochie with him? Both could help more Dianna if they were together.

Gundam,35m7qe,SunbroSteve,0,Tue May 12 01:20:44 2015 UTC,"Alright. The only evidence there is for the idea that Dianna is dying is:   She's been in cyro-sleep a long time, as has been Corin, and he's clearly batshit.   But Corin is batshit because of being older than their recorded history, and because of being frozen most of that long, long time. If he wasn't bugfuck to start with. Dianna wasn't; her cyrosleep schedule was in rotation, so the Moonrace used less resources.   She was winded when walking/running up a hill.   So are lots of people. Great evidence for dying of illness right there."
Gundam,35m7qe,ExpiredSushi,2,Tue May 12 06:34:51 2015 UTC,So you're saying she isn't dying? I would point you to the cane that she needs to use to get around at the end of the series.

What I'm trying to say is that the theory that Dianna is dying is spotty at best until we see the official subs in the coming year.    The whole theory about him returning to Sochie especially confuses me. Loran has never shown to return any feelings toward Sochie besides how he treats her like he's still her servant. His kissing Sochie felt like a consolation kiss ""I know you love me, but I'm sorry that I don't love you."" If Loran was gonna return to her in the end, why would she throw away his fish toy, something that he has always shown to be precious to him.   If anything, I think /u/Terminimal has the more appropriate ending for the setting."

Later Jamitov manages to convince the Federation assembly to give the Titans complete control over the Federation military, further cementing control for his earth-supremacist movement.   By the time that the Titans want to make a partnership with Axis, the AEUG has proven to be a notable force that is collecting members from both space and on earth. The Titans are now marshaling all of their forces in space around the Gate of Zedan, having thrown away their section of Jaburo in the failed trap against the AEUG.   Essentially, the move is to make sure that the Axis force is on good terms with the Titans until they can control their portion of space. Haman however is aware of the current situation in the space around the earth sphere, and instead decided to ram Axis into Zedan to throw the Titans off further."

But I do remember that Axis was fighting against both the Titans and the AEUG by the end of Zeta."
Gundam,35k7u5,Terminimal,1 point,Mon May 11 07:33:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely the prior. When you think of how ridiculously powerful Axis Zeon, and then Neo Zeon becomes later on in ZZ/CCA, I don't think it would be possible if the Titans were still about. Even if they DID want to partner up with Axis, they'd have probably betrayed them eventually."
Gundam,35k7u5,NeonLightIllusion,1 point,Mon May 11 08:50:45 2015 UTC,I think Haman and Scirocco both knew going in it was only going to be temporary. It was more of a question of which one was going to make the first move and could they work together long enough to seriously weaken the AEUG.
Gundam,35k7u5,iceman_in_black,1 point,Mon May 11 12:42:35 2015 UTC,By letting the AEUG and Titans fight each other and wipe one another out instead of allying with one and leaving it intact it left Axis uncontested after Zeta. It definitely played out to Haman's advantage.

Gundam,35i4fl,CrashmanX,1 point,Sun May 10 20:13:34 2015 UTC,It definitively is more depressed than Zeta...
Gundam,35i4fl,IKill4MySkill,1 point,Sun May 10 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"Really? I've read that Victory is the most depressing, and after watching it, I think Zeta is more depressing considering nearly everyone Kamille ever cared about dies in front of his eyes (both his parents, his love interest, at least 95% of his comrades, and even his mentor is presumed dead at the end of the series), and he gets his brain fried in the end... at least Uso gets a happy ending Q.Q"

Gundam,35i4fl,JTrollFaceNinja,1 point,Mon May 11 17:21:38 2015 UTC,0080:War in the Pocket is really good (albeit not very action centered).  08th MS Team and 0083: Stardust Memory are good if you're looking for some well done action scenes and cool mobile suit designs.
Gundam,35i4fl,shpeilin,1 point,Sun May 10 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"Since you've seen Zeta, it's a good idea to also watch 0079, 0080: War in the pocket, 0083, ZZ, and Char's Counterattack (CCA). G Gundam is good for laughs; just don't take it too seriously. After War Gundam X is good as well, but the ending is cut short because the funding got cut. I liked F91 quite a bit. And as people have mentioned, Victory is another great one as well. Turn A is an oddball, and I need to finish watching it, but my friend has told me it's really good.  EDIT: I almost forgot 08th MS Team. That's a really good one as well. It has some of the best fight scenes in the entire Gundam franchise in my opinion."

In terms of the quality of the show it was fine, not exeptional compared to other gundam sereis, but i enjoyed it while i watched it and only thought of it as poor once after reading comments realized more than a few poir marks were deserved. In the end it was enjoyable to watch though looking back it doesnt really feel like gundam to me but more like a more childlike cartoon and it wont ever stick out to me to use as fodder when creating my own gundams in the future."

Gundam,35djzf,metalslug123,8,Sat May 9 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"This is my cosplay for Denver Comic Con where I've got two gunpla entered in the model kit competition as well! I've still got a few tweaks to make to the collar and belt, but I'm calling it done, and to clarify: by ""finished"" I really mean ""bought all the different parts and then modified them until I was happy with it.""  The helmet was the hardest part and took over a year of pondering in several stages of fear of destroying it and carefully destroying it for reconstruction to fit my fat head. It was a 1/1 scale statue type display item fixed to a stand. I had to slice it apart with a cut-off wheel on my dremel and then reconstructed it with EVA foam and pla-plate with actual solarized lenses. The entire head-strap and backside of the mask are scratch-made and painted to match, everything that's showing when I have the helmet on is ""machine made"" so to speak... like gunpla! Luckily the actual helmet part fit pretty snugly over the parts of the mask I made and doesn't wobble or fly off unless I'm bent over looking at my toes!  The rest of the bluk of the costume was bought off Ebay. The epaulettes I mounted to cardboard to make them sturdy and used spare parts from trimming down the fake-tassel, adding real tassel and siding while using the spare fake-tassel trimmings as insignia bands before fixing them to the cape. Likewise, the belt was this kind of fake(?) leather that was perfectly portioned to have pla-plate hot-glued on top of it for a more real effect.  The gloves are ""Ultra Enforcer Leather Gauntlets"" by Tough Gloves.  The boots(not pictured) are Funtaisma white leather ""Captain 100"" boots with the soles painted white(Yay spare Tamiya primer, matte white and simi-gloss topcoat!)  This wont be my first time cosplaying, but it will be my first gunpla competition... that has me more nervous than anything!!"

If not, there are some guides on how to get bandai Japan to send you replacement parts. Don't remember the specifics though I've never had to go that far."

I remember once my wife, who doesn't really like Gundam but knows a lot about it from being married to me, came in when I was re-watching Unicorn.  It was the scene with Banagher finding the Gundam.

Gundam,35b36c,wikired,4,Fri May 8 19:20:44 2015 UTC,It's a short (around 10 min IIRC) OVA about a random battle the team faces on some mission. It's pretty cool.

Gundam,35d2lr,Snitches_exe,4,Sat May 9 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"Best is pretty subjective, depends on what you're lookin' for.  Battlefield Record 0081 is great, but kind of like the Gran Turismo of Gundam games, in that it tries to be somewhat realistic.  There's some customization and stuff, too.  Great if you like Universal Century grunt suits, but if that's not your thing then you won't like it.  Gundam Breaker 2 is on the arcade side of things, fast paced and extremely flashy.  It's also all about customization, because it's all about kitbashing Gundam models together to make badass custom mobile suits.  Covers most of the major Gundam series, so good for just about any fan.  And then, as /u/HamEaterQC pointed out, there's Extreme Vs Full Boost (and its new sequel that's still arcade-only, called Maxi Boost instead of Full Boost).  No customization, but it's an incredibly fun, fast, flashy 2-on-2 arcade fighting game, with a lot of options for setting up custom matches.  It also includes just about all of the most popular mobile suits.  The only downside is that they're all confined to the PS3.  There's nothin' on 360 (well, there IS a game, but I don't even think it has servers anymore) and you would need a JP 360 anyways, and there's nothing on the current systems.  Couple of fun games on Wii, but you have to hack your Wii a little bit to get them to work.  DS has a couple of interesting options, the PSP has some fantastic Gundam games, and since the PSP and DS (like the PS3) are region-free, you can play imported games on 'em.  Also, many of the older systems have some good Gundam games, and they can be emulated.  There's also the Super Robot Wars games (which are on, like, most every system ever made), which are strategy games that include Gundam units from the various series, as well as mecha from just about every mecha series ever.  So yeah, there are plenty.  What are you looking for?  :)  EDIT: Also, Gundam Battle Operation on PS3, it's a free-to-play that focuses on One Year War suits.  They just had a beta for the new Gundam Battle Operation Next (PS3 and PS4), which is also free-to-play, and will span multiple series.  There's a few free-to-play PC games as well, of varying quality, at least one of which requiring some serious hoops to jump through."

Gundam,35bdvp,Char_X_3,2,Sun May 10 13:26:31 2015 UTC,It's honestly a series I have no major complaints about. Nothing overly positive (except the openings and how cute Garrod/Tiffa is) to say either but nothing to bitch about. It's just...good. Not great but good. Even with how rushed the ending was it still felt somewhat satisfying.

I kinda expected FA Unicorn since we have Norn, but I've been hoping they would release the Brave Commander as DLC... I've never been fond of Graham's Season 2 weeb suits like the Susanowo.  Also, this makes me skeptical about getting a Maxi Boost PS3/PS4 announcement any time soon. I was speculating that they would stick to a similar time frame as vanilla and announce the port sometime this summer/fall and get a release date for Q1 or Q2 2016."

People don't understand that you can't control what you like, and if we like something, we like it. Also, Seed is an extremely good anime show, not only a Gundam show, read the Wikipedia page to see what I'm talking about, it was very well received, even in the West."
Gundam,35aiux,ErkiB,6,Sun May 10 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"SEED was my first introduction to Gundam so it holds a place in my heart. destiny on the other hand just felt like it never found its own identity. Shin started off as a promising main character, but towards the end, just ended up being a barking dog that I wasn't really able to relate to. Also, the more I rewatched it, the more the reused action shots stuck out and it really really ruined it for me. I know SEED isn't exactly innocent in that regard, but Destiny just seemed so much worse."
Gundam,35aiux,jace_supreme,0,Fri May 8 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"Seed is great, there is a reason it was critically acclaimed in Japan and awarded, also its the 2nd most popular show in Japan next to the original MSG. People in the West are as per usual, extremely closed minded and negative, they are poison, the most of them."
Gundam,35aiux,ErkiB,6,Sun May 10 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"For me, SEED stopped being a retread of MSG after the Strike/Aegis battle. Before that, it was a good remake (in some ways superior to the source material). After that battle though, SEED began to follow it's own path. It stopped being a clone of MSG and became it's own thing.  That's also the point where I feel the writing jumped off a cliff with a brick strapped to it's head. There's a bunch of old interviews of debatable authenticity from back in the early 2000's (including one where Fukuda said he wanted to bring Gundam back to it's roots, to shows like Combattler V), but the general consensus is the final act of SEED was rewritten because SEED was popular. After Turn A flopped and X was cancelled, they had a hit and the ending we got was a thank you (of sorts) to the fans.  (Really wish Fllay could have piloted the Strike Rouge).  With Destiny, it's a whole other matter. It apes many elements of UC Gundam, with the show opening on it's own version of Stardust Memory and Shinn being more in-line with UC heroes.   The problem is Fukuda and his wife wanted to continue doing their thing. They wanted to continue on with the old cast, not work with a new one. Shinn is more a side-character until Athrun joins the Minerva and even then, the show devotes most of it's time to the old cast.   If I were Shinn's VA, I'd be pissed. From all reports, there was considerable conflict behind the scenes so this is something that would be brought up. Hell, the VA has said in interviews that the way Shinn ended up in Destiny was not what he was told when he signed on (and the version in SRW Z is more inline with the original concept).  It's then where the real conflict in Destiny comes up. It's not natural vs. coordinator, or free will vs. determinism. It CE vs. UC. Kira hasn't changed since SEED (well, you could argue he's more arrogant, self-righteous and his strength has been exaggerated), and he never does change. He represents a simpler version of Gundam, of good vs. evil. Shinn represents UC, with it's protagonists being various degrees of asshole in the early parts of the show. He represents complexity, moral ambiguity and all that shit that makes Gundam... well, Gundam. Kira doesn't target cockpits and is morally superior. Shinn kills his opponents and is evil (no, he's a soldier. He's doing his job).  In the end, what happens? CE steamrolls over UC with a flawless victory, the clear bias Fukuda and Morosawa have for their own work evident. CE is superior because CE is popular.  (Kinda like how Fukuda is going around now saying Cross Ange was successful enough to warrant a second series. It's sales are average, with the first volume only selling well because it had a ticket to an event with Nana. G-Reco is beating it in terms of average sales)  At least, that's the feel I have for Destiny."
Gundam,35aiux,Char_X_3,6,Sat May 9 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"There's a great podcast I used to listen to called Gundamn!

Honestly, I liked Seed, and I wanted to like Destiny, but the unlikeable cast and gratuitously recycled animation killed it for me.

Gundam,35aiux,GundamMaker,1 point,Fri May 8 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that helps me understand things a lot. Although I didn't listen to the whole thing because they start saying a few things about Stargazer. I'll watch that soon.  I just can't agree about Durandal, though. The whole time, I'm thinking, please be the villain, please be the villain. And one of them thought Patrick Zala and Azrael were ideal villains. I can agree that it was baffling how open Durandal was about being evil, after he revealed his plans.  Hey, Gilbert, maybe Arthrun wouldn't have run off if you didn't try to convince him to pilot a machine with ""666"" in the name. That's a little on the nose. And how the hell did you convince the Council to fund a Neo-Genesis while going on about how force is a last resort? (I had to laugh when the Neo-Genesis showed up.)"
Gundam,35aiux,namain,3,Fri May 8 23:48:10 2015 UTC,"The big part that annoyed me about destiny is that they spent all this time grooming Shinn to be the new Kira, to the point that they have him a clone of the Strike and even had him almost kill Kira. Then flip all of this on its head and decide, NOPE Jesus Yamato is back to being the main character and hero."
Gundam,35aiux,Skyrick,5,Fri May 8 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"There was so much potential in that story line.  Having Kira die, and Shinn slowly realizing that Kira was right and forcing the burden of fixing everything on him would have been rather powerful.  Instead we got half way through the series, then all the new people were bad, all the characters that we knew from SEED were good, and the plot became a little ham fisted.  Hell they even brought Mu La Flaga back to life so that it was just like the good old days.  Had SEED Destiny focused solely on the original SEED characters from the beginning, or allowed for more growth of the new characters in the second half it could have been awesome, but it felt like half way through they just veered off in a different direction and that made it seem like there was no character growth made by anyone."
Gundam,35aiux,BoyGodz,5,Fri May 8 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"I am not sure if I am the kind of person you are talking about, I don't hate either series with a passion, but I do see enough merits in Seed to the point that if I have to give it a thumbs up or thumbs down, I would give Seed a thumbs up, whereas for Destiny I really don't see those merits retaining or enough to cover the new flaws.  So if I am not allowed to give neutral rating, I would give Seed a 6/10 and Destiny maybe a 2/10.  So here is what I like about Seed and not Destiny:    Story. Now, I know the first half is a close copy of MSG and second half is pretty bad and I agree to that, but Seed's first half was a good modernized iteration of the original MSG with enough good unique moments for me to recognize it as a story of its own, namely the Strike/Aegis last fight, the whole Athrun and Kira story line, Freedom and Justice vs the enhanced threes at Orb, sometimes I wish they would put some more effort to differentiate the first half from MSG, but then I remembered what happened second half. But in Destiny I really can't see any good story writing that isn't just a copy of other series, first 13 episodes are good but they are a carbon copy, Impulse/Freedom fight was unique but everything about it is just shit writing, like Impulse's shield suddenly gaining the ability to reflect beam. Kira never attack cockpit? Let's plan a move to juke the freedom's attack when Kira inevitably aim for the cockpit by detaching the top and bottom of the Impulse. I just watch Destiny about a month ago before it get take down on Youtube, and I still can't make sense of the story. Mech Design. I like the first 5 Seed gundams, they are stylish but not over the top, the Freedom, Justice and a few other ones I can still tolerate, but what the fuck is wrong with the ones in Destiny? The impulse is a mix of RX-78-2 and strike with some even more cartoon color scheme, the Saviour and the other 3 from the heist all has cheap transform mechanics and their transform mode all look shit, the first 5 looks like toys is what I am trying to say, and not good ones. And the later ones are either some gundam chimeras or over-the-top copies, Destiny? V2+Shining finger with a cannon and an Anti ship sword strap to its back. Akatsuki? Hyaku Shiki lookalike with Nu's funnel field. SF and IJ  are just over-the-top version of Freedom and Justice with more weapons like Sazabi's stomach cannon, a pair of twin rifles, some wing-like funnels and a few beam edge here and there. And what is up with the name? Strike Freedom is the lowest effort gundam name I can think of. Even the music for worse, Seed does a good job of using themed BGM to bring the mood and do other thing, Destiny have a number of BGMs too but seems to stick to the few, I mean I can listen to one of the themed BGM for the enemies and tell which guys Kira is fighting, but just like the frequent use of the stock footage, Destiny seems to have the same BGM on for almost every fight. Grunts MS. Technically this should belong to the mech design part, but I have different things to complain on about grunts. They just copied the Zaku, Gouf and Dom for fucking lols. Not even like the copying they are doing with gundams, they just look exactly the same, even the names! Seeds' grunts MS may not look the best, but at least they are original. (BaCues are badass, btw) Characters. Since Seed's plot stick to its ""source material"" for longer, the character actually experience some meaningful events and therefore have character development. I like Kira as the nerdy kid who is the lone coordinator in a pack of naturals, he had emotions and struggles like a real person, even he turned Jesus Yamato at least he had facial expressions, In Destiny he is just a killing machine manipulated by Lacus, no emotions, no development, at the end of the series, the only answer he can come up with is that he will fight like he has been doing all series. Athrun turned from that kid that care about his friends to a jerk who only care about his friends, that just the appearance of Kira is enough to cloud his whole judgement and he would sacrifice all ideals he had when he rejoined Zaft. Even side characters like Yzak, Dearka would ideals and character that make you understand how the original 4 gundam pilots ended up with different paths. Destiny? We have angsty teenager A and Shinn. Man, Shinn is set up for such great character, even if he had to end up on the opposite side of Kira, it is possible to have him develop into an anti-hero that you can emphasize and understand his reasoning. I mean, even Char is an enemy against Amuro, it doesn't make you hate him, right? But no, they just make him this angry kid who can't be logically dealt with and call it a day.   Since Seed is technically the first series I had watched as it airs, it holds a special place in my heart and I might be biased, but I am just so disappointed in Destiny, it had promising opening but it went so wrong so quickly. It is even more saddening seeing the success of Stargazer, Cosmic Era could have the next UC if Destiny didn't accumulate such a bad rep."

Let's plan a move to juke the freedom's attack when Kira inevitably aim for the cockpit by detaching the top and bottom of the Impulse.   Kira aimed for Shinn's cockpit? I remember that scene, but I don't think I took note of the fact that Kira suddenly stopped avoiding the cockpit. That could be contradictory writing, or it could show that Kira became desperate, after realizing what Shinn was doing. But using the Impulse's Core Splendor System to avoid an attack was a callback to some of my favorite Universal Century battles.  I think I did still empathize with Shinn, even if there were few redeemable qualities after his descent into madness. The way you see him start to realize he's not fighting for the world he hoped for, and then he just pushes that doubt deep inside, as if it's too painful to acknowledge he's been manipulated this whole time. That's a sort of denial I believe is very common in real life."

And the second half of the series are dominate by Kira who is a extremely boring character compare to SEED. SEED unlike Destiny shows some interesting plot point. For example Kira is not as one dimensional as he is in Destiny. He has a lot of challenges throughout the series. He will show his weaker side occasionally and struggle emotionally. Overall, SEED didn't blow my mind but it at least keep me watching and interested."

And even in the HD remaster, you occasionally have stuff like this."
Gundam,35aiux,KaziArmada,2,Fri May 8 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Be fair though, it's a HD Remaster, not a complete overhaul and rework. Seed was the first Gundam show to be created on a PC, that should be considered."
Gundam,35aiux,idiotsonfire,1 point,Sun May 10 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"I have been watching both the HD versions just recently , many years after I watched them when they were released and the video difference between Seed and Destiny is pretty huge, not so bad as I don't like watching it but yeah pretty large none the less."

The worst thing about SEED Destiny is that in every episode a main character from the previous series is in, one of them cries.  The show has two emotions for its previous mains; happy crying or anguished crying, or, if it can be called an emotion, neutrality."

I also liked a lot of destiny's new characters, and durandal was definitely a great villain."
Gundam,35aiux,ErkiB,1 point,Fri May 8 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"Destiny suffers from staff disputes, more than anything else. If you go back to interviews with the VA's and articles, blogs, ect way back in the mid 2000's several 'things' came to light. The most well known staff dispute was between the VA for Cagalli and moreswaka over Cagalli's character becoming an incompetent crybaby (more evident in the original). It was so bad, that for almost an entire decade Cagalli's VA did not reprise her role in any seed-related video-game (not even for SRWZ). The VA for Shinn sided with Cagalli's VA as did dearka's, waltfeilds, and yzaks (notice how all those characters got majorly screwed over, despite them being fan favourites?)  How it was implied waltfeild would get with murrue and then suddenly mu is back?"

Gundam,35aiux,Moulinoski,1 point,Sat May 9 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"The thing about the Impulse vs Freedom fight that bothers me that is never explained to me appropriately is exactly what prevented Kira from shooting the parts to the Impulse down every time they launched from the Minerva? After the 1st time it happened Kira should have recognized what was happening and he should have EASILY be able to shoot them down. After all, they are going in a straight line, and they are following a predictable course."
Gundam,35aiux,KaziArmada,-3,Sat May 9 17:46:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no offence, as I'm a fair person and I do see some of your points, but I can't sit in my chair and write a positive responce to this biased and extremely tilted view on the show. You have obviously been poisoned by this sub-reddit, as if you are actually trying to make a point and not slander Seed and Destiny, you have failed miserably. Why? You mock Kira Yamato, call things stupid and dumb, making your entire point absolutely worthless as your emotions have taken over. To waste so much time writing so long, you should at least try to be a bit fair and somewhat respectful, not act like a closed-minded individual. It comes down to being honest and truthful and I see none of those things in your text. To me, it is coming from someone who already had a pre-determined idea of what the shows were going to be, watched them and was looking for all the flaws they could find in order to talk shit about the show. Heck, your not the first person to do it, but to waste so much time on trying to convince people to dislike something that they love is simply wrong and pointless. You have absolutely no right to say what I can think or should feel about Seed and Destiny, yet you try do. You act as if Seed and Destiny are all bad and barely glance at the positives and focus the majority of your text on the negative.   A few quotes that you might find intriguing.   Jerry Chu, marketing manager for Bandai Entertainment Inc., stated the response to Gundam SEED has been highly positive, having broken rating records when it first aired in Japan.  Chu added that reaction in the United States was the most enthusiastic Bandai received in the last six years.  According to the analyst John Oppliger of AnimeNation Gundam SEED became the first Gundam series which was widely successful not only among ""Gundam fans and hardcore otaku"" but also among ""mainstream, casual Japanese viewers"".  Gundam SEED was the eighth TV Feature Award winner at the Animation Kobe Awards in 2003. It was the third winner at the Japanese Otaku Awards in 2003. It won Animage‍ '​s twenty-fifth Anime Grand Prix award winner in 2002, with the characters of Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne topping the male and female anime categories, respectively.  Gundam SEED has been praised for being a stand-out in a long line of Gundam series with Anime News Network's Paul Fargo calling it ""the best of the alternative timelines, but stands as one of the best Gundam titles""   I can keep going if you wish, that's up to you, but I would like for you to stop slandering a show which is obviously great and critically acclaimed, and awarded. To say that Gundam Seed is not good is foolish, it's easily one of the best Gundam shows to ever be created and a solid anime on its own. Destiny had success thanks to the success of Seed, and if you want the cherry on top of the cake? If it would not have been for the success of Seed, the Gundam franchise might not have continued. The low ratings before Seed was a reason for concern but after the success, Seed put Gundam series back on the right track."
Gundam,35aiux,burkmcbork,3,Sun May 10 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your frankness. However, I don't believe I told anyone what they should think or feel about the shows. That's what you are doing:   To say that Gundam Seed is not good is foolish, it's easily one of the best Gundam shows to ever be created and a solid anime on its own.   You say I should be respectful, but I don't believe anyone is obligated to be respectful to a work of fiction. To the creators, voice actors, animators, perhaps... but not the work itself. You say I ""slander"" the show:   I would like for you to stop slandering a show which is obviously great and critically acclaimed, and awarded.   but that word pertains to matters of true and false, not aesthetic appreciation. Unlike the legal concept of slander, there is nothing you can do to stop me from trash-talking a show. Your own opinions, the opinions of a million other fans, and the show's commercial and critical success... none of these can be used as evidence in some ""court of art"" to place a gag order on what I choose to write.  I admit I call things stupid and mock the show. But, poisoned by preconceived biases or not, I honestly thought much of the show's style and plot was silly. Partly, I was purposefully trying to be strongly opinionated in order to make such a long post somewhat humorous. And I don't think I ever said, ""This is stupid, and you should feel stupid if you don't agree that it's stupid."" Only ""this was stupid.""  My thesis was that if you're willing to not take the show too seriously to forgive its sillier aspects, both series are a lot of fun and quite enjoyable, and I think Destiny is even more enjoyable than SEED. I liked both of them better than Wing, and even though Wing is my least-favorite series, I even liked that. I even thought G-Saviour wasn't hell. So many things in the franchise can be improved, but I can get something out of almost every installment. I might be the least judgmental person you'd ever meet. Not the least opinionated, but the least judgmental.  I expected most replies would be as negative as this... except I had thought people would be upset that I defended Destiny as much as I did.   I can keep going if you wish, that's up to you   Please do. I'd especially like some stats on Destiny's positive reception in Japan. I read that in 2008, sales of Destiny topped those of SEED and Zeta. This always seemed odd, considering how people compare Destiny to SEED here in the West, and even considering how (so I've heard) the Japanese cast of Destiny also criticized the plot. I'm betting Destiny's superior sales that year weren't just due to Meer's scene in Episode 21. (And maybe that scene was HD-only?)  I don't want you to think I'm disgusted with you. But I'm making such a long response because I'm troubled that someone who lives in this world can so easily tell someone else what should or shouldn't be in their brain, what should or shouldn't come out of their mouth. If you think ""fairness"" or ""respect"" allows you to do so, or if you think consensus allows you to do so, it's even more troubling.  The only thing in this universe you can truly claim ownership over is your own brain, your own mind, your own opinions; nobody can tell you otherwise. That's the decision Kira and Lacus make at the end of Destiny, isn't it?  You have to accept the way I feel, and the fact that this subreddit is an anti-SEED circle jerk, just as I have to accept that Kira is consistently voted into the top five anime heroes in that magazine. Everyone involved in those realities made their own choice. I don't believe you have an intrinsically fundamentalist mindset, but your post truly reminded me of how some Muslims respond to the slightest criticism or skepticism of the Quran and the Prophet Mohammad. Except replace those two with SEED and Kira Yamato.  As for your last point, sometimes it's alright if a franchise dies, if they've been able to tell the stories they were supposed to. I'm sure there are plenty of old-timers who were satisfied with Char's Counterattack and didn't require anything after it. Gundam isn't the only valuable mecha franchise."

Gundam,359vr5,Windst,4,Fri May 8 09:24:58 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I watched 00, so I'm not too sure. Your point about Interstellar (You could replace that with Gunbuster if you wanted to) makes a lot of sense, or it could be that the communication took 50 years to go through.  I think the Gundam 00 movie had lots of good ideas, but it really needed to be a third season, so there would actually be time to develop some of it's humongous cast. That's the same way I feel about Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa actually, which was by the same director, Seiji Mizushima.  Also I realised that the movie is actually called ""A Wakening of the Trailblazer"" just recently, which is really strange."
Gundam,359vr5,ghostFOUR7,1 point,Fri May 8 10:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yea both AoT and FMA: The Conqueror of Shamballa moved very quickly I felt.  Like I could follow both of them, then all of sudden BAM!  Plot moving at breakneck pace.  That being said I thought FMA: CoS was a nice wrap up and goodbye to the characters (before we knew Brotherhood was a thing) and overall better than AoT."
Gundam,359vr5,gundam61,1 point,Fri May 8 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"So it's A Wakening, and not Awakening. I feel a little goofy now."
Gundam,359vr5,Finishingtothesky,4,Fri May 8 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"My perception of AoT:  The ELS are running throughout the galaxy trying to find a new home, as theirs got destroyed. They run into the Jupiter fleet, basically the ship CB sent out to gather and create the GN Drives, so they merge with the vessel and attempt to reach Earth with it. The Earth Sphere's elite, including the second Innovator, intercepts the suspicious vessel but due to no way of communicating with the ELS despite having an Innovator, they open fire on the ELS. ELS at this point were confused, and fire back, believing that this is how Earthies communicate.   Fast Forward to the end of AoT: Setsuna is finally able to communicate with the ELS, and now understand they want peace and to co-exist with humans, which was part of why they kept trying to assimilate humans. So Setsuna travels to their planet, and basically acts as a translator between the ELS and humanity, allowing a much better co-existance than ELS basically forcing assimilation and accidentally killing off humans. ELS are merged into certain humans, but more often some MS, such as the worker MS we see at the end of AoT. In the 50 years gap, Setsuna basically uses ELS Qan[T] to travel the galaxy via it's teleportation powers and uses his Innovator powers, enhanced by the ELS, to communicate with the life forms on other planets, achieving space peace.  There's also the Innovator wars, but I haven't read much into that. From what I can tell, it's basically the whole Newtypes vs Oldtypes business we're used to.    TLDR: Setsuna becomes space translator and goes around checking other planets out to make space peace."
Gundam,359vr5,Finishingtothesky,2,Fri May 8 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"I love this perspective, especially giving Qan[T] a Purpose still. I wonder if ELS Qan[T] is anythign compared to Turn A"
Gundam,359vr5,duelistgamer,3,Fri May 8 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was an avid 00 S1 fan, but I didn't really accept S2 and to a much lesser extent, AoT, but when I thought about it this way it made a whole lot more sense then just ""Dude, aliens"". It shows and actually properly emphasizes the problems we have understanding others, in this its taken to the extreme, a whole alien species! The misunderstanding in attempting to communicate is a nice touch, which is reflected in both Setsuna and the ELS.    I wonder if ELS Qan[T] is anythign compared to Turn A   I can see people drawing similarities, as they're both really godlike suits, but with both suits in different techs and universes its hard to draw a solid comparison. In terms of style though, Qan[T] for me all day! If Qan[T] wanted that Turn A mustache it can ELS it on so no probs there."
Gundam,359vr5,duelistgamer,2,Fri May 8 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Turn A only win with moonlight butterfly?   I do like how the movie really shows what's wrong with our world. If aliens showed up, how would our personal timeline react?"

Gundam,357gim,ShadowSkeet,11,Thu May 7 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"Fucking Nina Purpleton...  She's indecisive and unwilling to make an advance because she thinks that's a guys responsibility - then she scalds Kou for turning her down when he thinks she's uninterested because of the signals she's putting out when she tries to play hard to get.  She's not actually that good of an engineer: she's actually a supervisor so her job really is to yell at real engineers and claim their hard work is hers. I'm pretty sure she just deals with clients most of the time. Come to think of it, the entire department where she's from is filled with nothing but good looking chicks leaving me to believe that Anaheim does the ""pretty lady sales"" trick.  Oh and the biggest reason Nina is a bitch is... she fucking stabbed Kou in the back! Its one thing to betray's someone trust but Nina fucking smashed Kou's trust much like the colony smashed into Earth. After everything they've been through, after watching all of his comrades who died/ or will die over trying to get back GP- 02 and trying to stop the colony and even after having her best friend being shot, she runs off with Gato, the main man behind all of it. Oh and the dude doesn't give two shits about her and promptly drops her ass like a bad habit... again. I don't support domestic violence but if Kou would've slapped the shit out of Nina at the end after being released out of prison, I would have stood up and applauded.  In short, fuck Nina. She's the biggest bitch in all of Gundam and my least favorite character. If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Kio and Katz, I would shoot Nina twice."
Gundam,357gim,iceman_in_black,7,Fri May 8 00:38:13 2015 UTC,"I watched 0083 awhile ago and was working on a theory of why Nina isn't a terrible person. There are really two big issues that I have with her. The first being she clearly had a relationship with Gato. How was she not like ""hey I know that guy wait oh shit he's stealing a gundam""? The other thing is how she reacted in relation to love interests. At first she was like Kou you're lame then she's like oh I love you wihout much of a buildup. Then she's like oh Gato I have very clearly undefined unresolved feelings for you that include love so I'm going to kind of screw over this other guy I love kind of or whatever. Then Gato is like hey gurl its not gonna work I gotta go do some kamakazie shit and then at the end she's like oh hey Kou you still into me? I think its kind of ridiculous people would expect her to stop Gato and the colony drop. She couldn't really have done anything in her position and wasn't bound by any duty to do so."
Gundam,357gim,Terminimal,4,Fri May 8 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"I really liked the fact that Nina and Gato were in a relationship. It seems so strange, because Nina is sort of a girl-next-door everywoman, and Gato is this larger-than-life Man of Destiny, but that's what makes it interesting.  Gato must've had this casual side to him, a man who balanced his personal life with a career in Zeon's military. But at some point before the fall of A Baoa Qu, he became consumed by ideology and honor, destined to die flying into a Federation fleet yelling ""Sieg Zeon.""  People say it was a last-minute surprise, but it was first hinted during the battle between Kou and that veteran amputee, which I think was around the halfway mark."
Gundam,357gim,CrashmanX,5,Fri May 8 00:05:55 2015 UTC,"She's said many times that she doesn't want Kou and Gato fighting. Her actions here are not to betray Kou or the Federation, but rather to save Gato and prevent the two people she loves from killing each other.   That's called betraying the Federation. When they say you are to kill or capture Zeon soldiers, you don't just let them go. Especially not high rankers like Gato."
Gundam,357gim,iceman_in_black,8,Thu May 7 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"But she's not part of the Federation. She doesn't even work for the Federation.

Yeah, basically the American Midwest is a crater after 0083.  To put things in perspective, right now in the year 2015 the mid-west exports enough crops to keep the world from experiencing widespread famines we read about in history books.

Edit: I also think it would have been out of character for her to follow through with trying to capture him. Saving him makes more sense for her character."
Gundam,357gim,Brenticus302,2,Thu May 7 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"Bullet to the knee.   As far as out of character, OK and? She can be in character all day, doesn't mean people won't hate her. I can write a character to be REALLY shitty and horrible but they'll stay in character and at the end of the day people will hate them. But it's OK, cause they were in character. Therefore people should like them right? No, that's not how that works. People hate her cause she's written to be an indecisive ass that screwed everyone over."
Gundam,357gim,dangerousmutelunatic,4,Thu May 7 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"Except that she wasn't indecisive at all? She was incredibly decisive. She chose to save Gato. She acted without much hesitation. An indecisive character would have sat around doing nothing.   And she didn't screw everyone over. Literally nothing of substance changed from her actions. Even if she had captured Gato, he would have just been executed instead of going out in a kamikaze attack. She didn't send Kou to prison. She didn't drop the colony. Literally the only lasting impact was maybe hurting Kou's feelings (something that we're not even sure if he blames her for).  That's hardly ""screwing everyone over.""  I'm not saying you shouldn't dislike her. I'm just confused as to why she gets so much more hate then it seems is necessary."
Gundam,357gim,Rube9,2,Thu May 7 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"Kinda going off topic, but do we even know how Nina and Gato got together and then split? The most likely scenario I see is Gato making a ""muh ideals"" speech and then leaving for Delaz (it's been a while since I watched 0083, so apologies if they actually discussed this)."
Gundam,357gim,NageQsad,2,Thu May 7 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"It wasn't really discussed in the show, but I imagine it was something like that. It definitely seemed like he just left and that their relationship was never fully resolved."
Gundam,357gim,LordRevann,1 point,Thu May 7 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"This all happened before the Zeon uprising, so it probably was something like that. Gato decided to join the Zeon military, and Nina stayed behind."
Gundam,357gim,dangerousmutelunatic,1 point,Thu May 7 19:56:11 2015 UTC,That's actually a really good question. I'm not sure if there are any side stories or anything that deal with that topic.
Gundam,357gim,J3sj,2,Thu May 7 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"I hate her because she's a wishy-washy all-over-the-place, poorly written character that acts like she's 14 years old.  Seriously, it's like she's written by a man who never met a woman except one time and it was a teenage girl on her first period.  She's just ALL over the place!  Adult women simply don't act like this.  And she's so petty!  Carrots?  Really?    To be fair, Kou acts like a 12 year old boy with a crush a lot of the time around her, not a man or even a young man...which I also hate and doesn't seem consistent with his character the rest of the time...which means it's back to the horrible writing with anything she is involved with.  So yeah, she's the worst."
Gundam,358z7w,mmarkel27,6,Fri May 8 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"G Gundam is so amazingly different from the rest of the franchise it might as well not even be a gundam series. Gundam Build Fighters is probably the closest thing to it and is enjoyable if you can get past how much of a cash grab it is, but half of its entertainment value is just, well...  Wing is of course a nice gateway to the franchise, but I've always considered it to be way too dumbed-down when compared to all the other series. Not that it doesn't have its moments. It also has a few interesting things to say about drone warfare, which is notable in that drones weren't really part of the international conversation back in the mid '90s.   Seed was basically designed to be the quintessential Gundam series for a new generation of fans. It's a retelling of the original series that has the benefit of hindsight in its conception. If you like it, then you'll love all the Universal Century shows and will be well-prepared for the trudge ahead of you.  Then there's 00, which is Gundam for a post-9/11 world. Different in its premise from the rest of the franchise. Also a pretty good gateway series. It's the only Gundam series to be broken into two seasons, with each season following one of two conflicts and taking place over roughly five years. It's generally agreed that the first season is superior to the second. This is true, but I still very much enjoyed the second season and thought it had a great conclusion. You can watch this one without knowing anything about the rest of the franchise, as even Seed has a bunch of stuff going on in it that doesn't quite follow if you don't know what a Newtype is.  Finally, there's the original Mobile Suit Gundam. If you can get past just how antiquated the animation is by today's standards, it's a damn good show that has a saturday morning feel to it. Coupled with a growing degree of depth and a now-iconic villain, MSG is a really fun time.  tl;dr watch seed if you want to know what the main franchise is all about, wing if you just want some robots and entertainingly silly melodrama, 00 if you want a more grounded take on the idea of the Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam if you want to start at the beginning and free of all the minutia that builds up, and AGE if you hate yourself and like watching incompetent bullshit"
Gundam,358z7w,attackzeppelin,2,Fri May 8 05:21:45 2015 UTC,I'd say the original movie trilogy is a good choice
Gundam,358z7w,Zillamaster,2,Fri May 8 03:33:49 2015 UTC,You'll certainly have a firm grasp on how big a fan of the genre you are by the end of it.
Gundam,358z7w,OmegaSeven,2,Fri May 8 15:29:27 2015 UTC,"While the others are suggesting Build Fighters, I'd say wait a bit before watching if you want to really enjoy the series for all it's cameos/jokes.   I'd say go Wing next and then X. Then either jump to the Universal Century with MSG (Movies or series) or continue with more AU series like 00."
Gundam,358z7w,CrashmanX,2,Fri May 8 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"Wing, 00, Seed or X would be good choices if your looking for another stand alone series, or if you feel like starting UC stuff i would say the best way to go about it imo is MSG->Zeta->Double Zeta->CCA then you can pretty much jump into any other UC era series and not be missing out on any or much information to fully understand things."
Gundam,358z7w,OranosSonaro,1 point,Fri May 8 10:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest watching Char's Counterattack and Unicorn pretty close together.  Also, I wish there was an easy way to see Double Zeta without resorting to piracy because I haven't seen it."

Gundam,355a2o,burkmcbork,-2,Thu May 7 16:00:24 2015 UTC,Sunrise's official stance is Canon-until-otherwise-proven.   Hence why Gundam X: Under the moonlight is recognized and so is Crossbone Gundam.
Gundam,355a2o,CrashmanX,3,Thu May 7 16:17:36 2015 UTC,Sunrise's official stance is Canon-until-otherwise-proven.   It's pretty well known that Sunrise only considers animated stuff to be official.  Under the Moonlight and Crossbone Gundam remain unofficial in Sunrise's eyes.
Gundam,355a2o,SolDarkHunter,1 point,Thu May 7 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"""Everything animated is canon"" and ""anything not animated is not official"" is totally two different concepts though. Latter is never said to be true and former we still haven't seen a solid proof that Sunrise has ever made a official statement of.  Not trying to play the Japanese or the Eastern fans as the superior ones, but both Hathaway's Flash, Crossbone, CCA BC and the rest of EUs are considered ""canon"" (or official, since canon is only really a Western thing), all of which our Western Canon-ism followers considered otherwise."
Gundam,355a2o,BoyGodz,1 point,Fri May 8 04:57:38 2015 UTC,"Here's some information on the subject of Sunrise and their ""official"" standards.

Gundam,355a2o,SolDarkHunter,1 point,Fri May 8 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"That is why I said it is a different concept when you say ""if it's filmed, it's canon""(the exact quote from the article) and ""anything else is not canon"". All the other stuffs are not ruled as non-canon as far as I know, but rather in the unconfirmed status, until they eventually get anime adaptation akin Gundam UC.  Also, that is not what we generally considered as an official statement, but I am sure you already know that given you put quotation marks on the word."
Gundam,355a2o,BoyGodz,0,Fri May 8 05:40:40 2015 UTC,Right. Which is why we just got a Crossbone as a prominent unit in GBFT. Also why we always get Belphagor in the G Generation games.
Gundam,355a2o,CrashmanX,2,Thu May 7 16:34:55 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why that's relevant. That's just Sunrise making nods to popular EU material.
Gundam,355a2o,SolDarkHunter,-1,Thu May 7 16:44:51 2015 UTC,Well Crossbone was animated. Therefore it's canon right?  I'm just saying Sunrise says Canon until otherwise proven. Because they're not going to willy-nilly approve series that clearly take place at the same time as other series.
Gundam,355a2o,CrashmanX,2,Thu May 7 16:57:25 2015 UTC,Well Crossbone was animated. Therefore it's canon right?   So was a giant Zaku. And giant Zakus are definitely not canon in the UC timeline.   I'm just saying Sunrise says Canon until otherwise proven.   Source please. Because I have never heard Sunrise say that. Ever.

It's a phonetic language so as far as pronunciation goes you have to work within the constraints of what sounds the symbols can make when importing foreign words.  So while a lot of Japanese people would have difficulty trying to pronounce that English word (or sound as it were) if they were speaking English, in the context of that word being used as a loan word spoken in Japanese it's just that it can't be phonetically transcribed completely accurately because of language mechanics."

I mean, Kira and Lacus aren't married and those DEFINITELY are NOT their children, but they're living in a mansion/castle or manor along the coast of a mountain range and forest and they had been living a peaceful life until they end up attacked."
Gundam,353o3x,KiraYamatoZG,2,Thu May 7 00:08:24 2015 UTC,DESTINY most likely wasn't out when he watched whatever it was he watched based on the time he said he watched it.
Gundam,353o3x,starcolored,1 point,Thu May 7 04:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew it was a bit of stretch at first. Although, Destiny did come out in late 2004 to 2005. It's not that far off from the time so, it's a possibility."
Gundam,353o3x,KiraYamatoZG,4,Thu May 7 18:05:25 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this is a Gundam series. The only thing I can recall like this might be the Lumber Jack from G Gundam.
Gundam,353o3x,CrashmanX,4,Wed May 6 21:29:02 2015 UTC,"i know the scene you're talking about in G Gundam and there is definitely a cabin in the woods but the lumber jack's wife is dead and there are no kids i think, anyway here is a youtube link for that episode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm7dx186Oas  that way 007style can see quickly if G Gundam is the series he is thinking of, otherwise the other suggestions sound just as valid if not more so but i've never watched zeta or 08th ms team, seed destiny could also be the series... who knows and good luck TC!"
Gundam,353o3x,Beginning_Gunpla,2,Thu May 7 04:10:43 2015 UTC,"It might be a misrememberd 08th MS Team, since elements of its ending are similar to what you've written. Or the start of Amuro's involvement in Zeta. Other than that, I can't think of anything."
Gundam,353o3x,fdasta0079,2,Wed May 6 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"What did you watch it on? Tv? If so, what channel?"
Gundam,353o3x,wikired,1 point,Wed May 6 22:42:04 2015 UTC,If I recall one of the opening episodes from Victory Gundam (from the little I could recall)  it happens in a forest.
Gundam,353o3x,LightningEagle7,2,Thu May 7 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"Victory is the only one to me that would be out in the early 2000s, that has the MC in a forest and kids around. It doesn't fit the other elements in what he says though, with the MC being a kid himself, nor have a wife even if Shakti acted like one.  Could be the end of the series, but unless we get more details, like why he thinks it is a gundam series I'm not confident at all."
Gundam,353o3x,LacusClyne,2,Thu May 7 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"Victory begins in the middle of the fighting, so it probably isn't the one. Because he said the person retired to a quiet life, and I don't think anyone does that in Victory until the end"

Gundam,355ytg,twilightsquid,3,Thu May 7 13:09:59 2015 UTC,Yeah... that was... just bad. Almost sounds like Beyblade in the US voice acting...
Gundam,355ytg,KiraYamatoZG,1 point,Thu May 7 18:19:10 2015 UTC,Beyblade voice acting was okay. Atleast that's how I remembered it. Tyson's and other characters's voices fit them.

Gundam,355ytg,CrashmanX,1 point,Thu May 7 17:12:13 2015 UTC,"Well, the sounds for this should be more reminiscent of SEED not Wing.   But yes, each one has their own sounds and they fit to the theme of the series.  Also I love how they didn't even bother to use raws and instead opted to use the Korean sub off of YouTube. When you could use the non-sub version just as easily."
Gundam,355ytg,Outlawtadpole,1 point,Thu May 7 17:19:32 2015 UTC,Ya it should have been seed. But I fell the gatling and booster sounds were distinctly wing.

Gundam,350wb5,fox112,4,Wed May 6 04:30:39 2015 UTC,Watching the Destiny Gundam Launch always brought chills down my spine :3
Gundam,350wb5,picflute,24,Wed May 6 20:19:49 2015 UTC,"If you sit down and watch it all at once, it's alright.  But the more time you give yourself between episodes to think about it the worse it gets."
Gundam,350wb5,zeph384,10,Wed May 6 06:27:53 2015 UTC,"This. There are numerous discussions on the web when people begin to analyze this series, and very few of them go in a pro-Destiny direction. The writing gets pretty bad, so bad even some of the cast has commented on it. Akira Ishida, who voiced Athrun, has said he's confused about Athrun's motivations and the plot in general. That's not a good sign."
Gundam,350wb5,Char_X_3,2,Wed May 6 13:14:05 2015 UTC,Even the Dub actors thought everything went to shit.
Gundam,350wb5,MS14JG-2,13,Thu May 7 04:51:42 2015 UTC,"I think the first 13 or so episodes are not just good, but among the best storytelling in Gundam. Heroes from the first show are forced to deal with the consequences of their actions and watch in horror as the flames of war are stoked once again. The new characters are pretty cool. And, of course, robot swag.  Then the rest of the show happens. At least the music is nice."
Gundam,350wb5,Morzas,2,Wed May 6 06:58:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. The first few episodes of destiny have great animation (at some point destiny evolves into stock footage for every action scene) and great atmosphere. But then Shinn gets out of hand, Luna gets shafted, Athrun is all what, and Kira aka Jesus comes back."
Gundam,350wb5,simsoy,1 point,Wed May 6 16:43:20 2015 UTC,The 2nd Coming of Jesus. Yes.
Gundam,350wb5,KiraYamatoZG,5,Wed May 6 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it a lot, and the suits look great, imho :)"
Gundam,350wb5,cideshow,5,Wed May 6 04:58:43 2015 UTC,"Destiny is a show that really gets worse the more you watch it. I'd say the first 13 episodes or so are above average for Gundam shows. After which, the show becomes worse, but is still somewhat good until around 2/3 through. After that, it's below average, with the last 5 or so episodes being pretty terrible (even with the improved ""Final Plus"" version, I'd still say Destiny has the worst ending of any Gundam series).  If you can get access to the special edition movies, they might be worth watching. They introduce their own flaws, but cut out a lot of the bloat and are much more watchable than the series. I'd recommend watching the first 13 episodes in the series, and then watching the three special edition movies for the rest."
Gundam,350wb5,live22morrow,5,Wed May 6 10:23:45 2015 UTC,"yes. just yes....   no but really, it is worth it, I loved seed, and had hype for destiny...   it was not the same or as good as seed... BUT it was still worth watching... and Strike freedom and the rest of the units are pretty bad ass.  even if you never watch it again, i dont think you would regret watching it once."
Gundam,350wb5,Setsuna00exia,4,Wed May 6 06:05:55 2015 UTC,"The HD Remaster is definitely worth the watch if you like the suit designs of Destiny.  And there are some very well animated fights!  But, like everyone has mentioned, there are some plot issues and character development issues... the key is to take it as it is, a show about giant robots fighting a war.  Don't over analyze it and you'll enjoy it."
Gundam,350wb5,LightningEagle7,3,Wed May 6 16:47:43 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it for the most part.   My main issues came from so many of the characters and some Gundams all being very similar which lead to confusion about who was doing what and whose side they are on since things flop around a lot.  For the action and general having something on in the background it is good. The story is really hard to follow though and lacks clarity.
Gundam,350wb5,Toysoldier34,5,Wed May 6 11:10:17 2015 UTC,"It's worth it so long as you don't go in expecting a masterpiece. It does suffer from an unlikeable cast early on, and the fact that those protagonists were the antagonist force in the previous series do not help matters when past characters start to take center stage.  Also, it propagates the notion of Kira essentially being unstoppable too some pretty ridiculous degrees."
Gundam,350wb5,Iokuas,2,Wed May 6 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"To me, Destiny felt very pointless and shallow. If it was just 13eps, I'd recommend watching it just for the action. But, at 52eps, you gotta ask ""do I really have nothing better to watch?"""
Gundam,350wb5,sylpher250,2,Wed May 6 07:59:40 2015 UTC,HD remaster is worth watching imo. Less stock footage and much better graphic. Original Seed Destiny is not worth the time.
Gundam,350wb5,leon004567,4,Wed May 6 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"I've been into Gundam since '96, and after 2006, I took a big break since becoming an Adult. I moved out my parents house and somehow lost all my models in the move. In was done. UC lost its edge, and I overly disliked Seed. I casually Googled Gundam 200X for a new series. Skipped 00 since it wasn't UC. I liked Unicorn 1, and when me and my twin hung out again I finished and felt it was good until the finale. I was content, bought myself a MG 1/100 God Gundam and put it on my shelf.   I got a new job, with a guy who reminds me of the guy who got me into Anime, Mega man, Metal Gear, Mega man, Guyver and Gundam. He bought an Aegis, and reawoke my anime side. I rewatched 0080 for taste and then checked SD out. Hmm, something was missing in my life.   What's this Gunpla series? It's alright.   So I did it. Gave 00 a chance.   Surprise, I loved it, aside its major homage ripoff of Wing and many other series.  Then I ruined it with the Movie. Went ahead and orders MG Exia and PG Raiser though.  Now here I am looking up subreddit Gundam, playing Battle Operations, which funny enough had a Beta for Next . think I'll import Vs and Breaker as well.  2015 goal and forward. order a new Gunpla each month. FOREVER."
Gundam,350wb5,Windst,3,Wed May 6 10:53:26 2015 UTC,"You will not regret importing Vs. and Breaker! Except I would recommend Breaker 2, the original Breaker has some SERIOUS flaws like Team Attack stages with overpowered suits and the fact that you'll be replacing way too many parts and make some pretty messed up Gunpla in the process."

Gundam,350wb5,idiotsonfire,1 point,Wed May 6 23:02:05 2015 UTC,There was a rant here. It's gone now.  You're better off playing a SRW that has Destiny instead of watching it. Even Shinn's VA considers the Z version of him the canon version.  Hype combo attack ahoy!
Gundam,350wb5,Irrel_M,1 point,Thu May 7 07:43:01 2015 UTC,"Well here's the deal with that:  I would normally say yes in a situation like this. Gundam Unicorn Episode 4, for example, is definitely worth checking out just for the Mecha Porn in compensation for the story going absolutely nowhere due to the Amazing Animation Quality and Fight Scene Choreography that compensated for it. But unfortunately, this is not the case with SEED Destiny. And here's why:  When you're looking for Mecha Porn in an anime, you expect to have Extremely Well Choreographed Fight Scenes / Battles. Unfortunately with SEED Destiny, all you're gonna get is just a fuckload of Recycled Animation and Reused Stock Footage of Gundams blowing up useless Grunt Mobile Suits as if it was just one big game of Dynasty Warriors Gundam.  Gundam Wing had this same problem in the past, but even with Wing, it was much less predominant than it was in SEED & Destiny.  So unfortunately, it is to my dismay that I would still not recommend watching it just for the Mecha Porn; because there pretty much is no Mecha Porn in this case.  I mean, just look at how terrible the animation quality can get with this scene right here, where the Impulse slices a Grunt Unit and somehow turns into the Strike Gundam all because they look very similar:  https://gfycat.com/AlarmingThirdFlyingfox  Thankfully, that scene in particular was fixed in GSD HD Remastered, but you get what I'm trying to say here. The animation quality, even with HD Remastered is just downright awful and the fight scenes are just boring watch; with only a a small handful of exceptions."

Gundam,350wb5,ShinnAssuka,0,Sat May 9 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"Only watch it if you Really need to know what happens after SEED. IMO, it's not very interesting. I felt like Destiny was a huge middle finger to the people who liked SEED.  However, it's not 100% crap. The soundtrack is very well produced, and the animation is pleasing to the eyes. Also the model kits based on Destiny are pretty good too for the most part."
Gundam,350wb5,randomking0x70,1 point,Wed May 6 12:08:57 2015 UTC,Fuck the haters. Seed has some of the best moments in the series. It's just not good in its entirety as a series. Like the villain being kinda an afterthought. But definitely one of the most heartfelt moments

Gundam,350wb5,knightfall1128,6,Wed May 6 05:31:18 2015 UTC,I feel like Athrun was more of the main character most of the time.
Gundam,350wb5,brandonvandyke22,-1,Wed May 6 06:43:48 2015 UTC,"It's usually maligned as being the worst series from the Gundam franchise, but honestly I think that dishonour belongs to ZZ. Destiny certainly isn't without its flaws, the over reliance on stock footage and the unlikeable main characters being the main ones, but it does have some things going for it. The soundtrack is once again excellent, and there's a fairly poignant scene early on where Lacus sings over scenes of a global catastrophe.   Mecha-wise, it's a very mixed bag. Impulse makes probably the only sensible use of the Core Block system that I can think of, with individual components able to pilot themselves to the battle in order to replace damaged parts (although the inevitable Gattai sequences are as overused as in any other combining mecha show), and in one case, allow the suit to pass through an area it wouldn't otherwise be able to. Sadly, they felt it necessary to re-use the Zaku and Gouf names with some quite boring re-imaginings. The Chaos, Gaia and Abyss that the primary antagonists pilot didn't make much of an impact, but Savior, Destiny and Legend were all rather popular. Strike Freedom and Akatsuki proved that bling makes your Gundam more powerful.  Give it a try. If anything, the first quarter of the series is pretty good, and you can stop after that if you wish."

That's what happens when your director quits the production i guess. I honestly think it should have stayed a one season series. It could have been compared with the greatest mecha anime in a couple of years. Sadly, that won't be the case."
Gundam,350ul9,HamEaterQC,3,Wed May 6 16:48:05 2015 UTC,Compared to the greatest? Oh hell no. There was too much Inaho being smarter than everyone else for that to be the case.  For whatever reason Inaho could out think everyone with the simplest of strategies.
Gundam,350ul9,CrashmanX,2,Wed May 6 17:03:42 2015 UTC,I felt from early on Inaho was autistic or even had asperger's. He was just way to on point all the time.

Gundam,350ul9,HamEaterQC,2,Wed May 6 16:02:29 2015 UTC,Evangelion is what got me started with mechas and anime in general. I consider The End of Evangelion to be a perfect masterpiece. Evangelion 2.22 is also fantastic.
Gundam,350ul9,CrashmanX,2,Wed May 6 16:45:11 2015 UTC,See the funny thing about Eva is in reality there is no 2deep4u element. It's almost all face value. The religious symbols mean nothing and were chosen simply because of how they looked/sounded.  IMO the Rebuild movies are great but man if 3.33 hasn't rubbed me in the wrong way.

I say that if you like Gundam Seed, watch Cross Ange.  It's basically the closest thing we got to Gundam Seed Season 3 at this point, and besides, it even has Tusk Kira Yamato in it.  That's a good reason to watch it."
Gundam,350ul9,Diamo1,2,Wed May 6 08:04:39 2015 UTC,I tried watching Gross Ange... got bored when Kira Yamatwo and Hitler Cagalli spent a day naked in Fukuda's a romance-plot cave.

Gundam,350ul9,saekheart,2,Wed May 6 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of other series you could try, mecha doesn't start and end at Gundam. A couple good ones:   Kikou Senki Dragonar SPT Layzner  Taiyou no Kiba Dagram Buddy Complex   And there's a lot more than that. Vifam, Xabungle, Dunbine, L-Gaim, Ideon, Tekkaman Blade, Gasaraki, Giant Gorg...  and even more if you have any interest in super robots like Getter Robo franchise, Daitarn 3, Mazinger franchise, the Brave franchise, Grendizer...  or if you happen to like the political or space opera end of the Gundam then there's... well, not of these are really mecha but there's Crest of the Stars/Banner of the Stars franchise, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Yamato."
Gundam,350ul9,lq13,4,Wed May 6 17:20:49 2015 UTC,"I gave the newer series a chance, but they're just not as good as the older ones. But 00 is good, and Unicorn is my favorite."

Gundam,350ul9,saekheart,1 point,Thu May 7 04:05:21 2015 UTC,"If you enjoyed the 00-style plans and counterplans, try Code Geass. It's much more lighthearted because Goro Taniguchi can actually direct pretty well, but it definitely has a heavy political and tactical layer to it."
Gundam,350ul9,CrashmanX,1 point,Wed May 6 13:16:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation but I've already seen it.
Gundam,350ul9,knightfall1128,3,Wed May 6 14:22:15 2015 UTC,"Not exactly surprising, given how popular it is. If you want silliness on par with Build Fighters (or moreso), try Star Driver, by Studio BONES. It's got some of the best animation I've ever seen, and the soundtrack is great. Extremely campy, so if you like the Meijin, that'll work for you.  Otherwise, if you prefer serious stuff, try shows like Valvrave or Knights of Sidonia."
Gundam,350ul9,CrashmanX,1 point,Wed May 6 14:41:33 2015 UTC,"The first time I watched Code Geass, I loved it. Then, I watched it a second time years later, and was very irritated by Lelouch's overwhelming angst. Should I give it a 3rd try?"

Gundam,350ul9,-ProFound-,2,Wed May 6 05:13:40 2015 UTC,"00 was 7 years ago, and Unicorn started roughly around the same time, I wouldn't consider either series new at this point."
Gundam,350ul9,brendintosh,1 point,Wed May 6 05:32:22 2015 UTC,I think of it in terms of releases. Between 00 and Build Fighters all we had was AGE and Unicorn. So it's still a relatively new series IMO.
Gundam,350ul9,randomking0x70,0,Wed May 6 06:02:36 2015 UTC,"What do you count as new? 00 was from 2007-2009, and Unicorn started in 2010. When I say newer, I mean build fighters (2013) and reconguista (2014). The time difference between the two sets of series are noticeably years apart."

I am someone who prefers original Japanese version, but I have a handful of friends who hold out for dubs before they will watch anything."
Gundam,34ysbt,rallypat,4,Tue May 5 18:45:35 2015 UTC,Me too. It's easier to convince people to watch something they don't have to read. Then there's the camp that ONLY watch something if it's on Netflix/Hulu... That's another battle.
Gundam,34ysbt,CrashmanX,3,Tue May 5 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yea... no. If it comes to US shores they'll easily remove those. He'll be ""drunk"" off soda or something else and he won't be comparing breast sizes, possibly Gunpla sizes."
Gundam,34ysbt,r0botosaurus,2,Tue May 5 19:43:19 2015 UTC,"Only if it's done by like, 4kids. Or Funimation 10 years ago."
Gundam,34ysbt,CrashmanX,2,Wed May 6 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"If it's aimed at adults, views are going to be terrible because the average populace will see it as aimed at kids.  If it's aimed at kids references like breast comparisons will be removed entirely. You have to remember, the US is FAR more OK with violence than it is sexuality in children's shows. Any hints at sex or sexual suggestions are removed avidly today. Things like Stephen Universe are really pushing the boundaries of the censors to get things through."
Gundam,34ysbt,r0botosaurus,3,Wed May 6 01:48:15 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the network and time slot they're aiming for. If it's going on Toonami then it'll be fine (they could even throw in a few more boob jokes). If they're aiming for a daytime time slot, expect cuts."
Gundam,34ysbt,CrashmanX,3,Wed May 6 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"Nah even if they threw it on Toonami it's kidish looks and plot would deter people. You have to remember, your average ""Bro"" watches Toonami anime for the ridiculous shit like DBZ and Naruto. Things like Attack on Titan and Kill La Kill are the hot shit right now due to their grit and sex appeal respectively.   Build Fighters is a really big homage series and without the fans behind it, it's kinda weak. Not to mention they'd have to change all of the Gunpla boxes to be generic instead of the actual things. For whatever reason they're not allowed to advertise the actual merchandise in show because US laws are weird like that."
Gundam,34ysbt,IGotAKnife,5,Wed May 6 04:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree when you're marketing pretty much gundam's version of beyblades you're going to have at the very least some changed up wording. ""Man, this whiskey root beer sure is strong"""
Gundam,34ysbt,Ragefield,1 point,Wed May 6 13:26:46 2015 UTC,They didn't take out a lot of stuff from Code Geass in the dub and there are a lot of sexually suggestive things in that series.  Then again I don't remember it being on any network.
Gundam,34ysbt,CrashmanX,3,Wed May 6 04:45:18 2015 UTC,"It was on Adult Swim.  Also DVD/BD releases are different from TV releases. Gundam SEED had all the pistols changed into ""Lasers"" and it wasn't even dubbed by 4Kids or early Funimation.  EDIT: Also Geass was filled to the brim with adult themes and was aimed at adults. Build Fighters is aimed at kids."
Gundam,34ysbt,Ragefield,1 point,Wed May 6 05:05:06 2015 UTC,That makes sense then.  They released the dub for the audience they were trying to aim for.   I have a feeling then that the target audience for Build Fighters will be determined by the age group recommended for GunPla so probably around 13+.  This would lead me to believe anything too explicit would be removed which I don't recall a whole lot of in Build Fighters but it's also been awhile since I watched it.
Gundam,34ysbt,CrashmanX,3,Wed May 6 05:23:02 2015 UTC,"The main thing that'd be removed are things like Reiji comparing China's and Rinko's breasts. I could see Rinko's swimsuit being changed up a bit or her being in said episode less often, but otherwise I can't think of much that would be changed."
Gundam,34ysbt,Salvo1218,2,Wed May 6 05:26:55 2015 UTC,"I enjoy both. If it's a very good dub, I prefer that since it's easier to just watch and not have to read also, but subs work well enough most of the time. It's nice when you can go through something the first time subbed and then rewatch with dubs to catch more of the visuals."

The one where Ral introduced Reiji to the ""Zeon"" underground crew, and first time meeting with Feillini.  But even before they met Feillini, I gave up. The VA cannot capture Reiji's hot-blooded voice, and sounds more like a 26yo than a 16yo. (I can't even grasp the trace of sarcasm in Reiji's voice, it's that dead)  Ral-tai sounds closer to a 24yo than a 35something yo, also feels lacking in emotion.  Overall..I'd rate it as 2/10. The lack of emotions is off-putting. Snide remarks came off more like...reading a newspaper in a monotonous voice."

Gundam,34ysbt,strikeraiser,7,Tue May 5 18:28:21 2015 UTC,".... Well not exactly. This could go one of two ways right now.  It's a Filipino English dub... which as far as Gundam goes are notoriously bad - but in the big picture are hit-and-miss.  If the dub is bad enough it could sink chances of it airing in the west(Jason DeMarco's confirmed that Gundam is 3 times more expensive than other shows on Toonami to air - Cartoon Network is a little bit different than [Adult Swim] though, but right now the theory is that they're waiting on Build Fighters to hit 4 seasons and therefore able to be in syndication before Sunrise/Bandai budges on the price for Build Fighters or any other Gundam series broadcast rights in the US)  A horrible English dub existing could further complicate the matter by requiring a new English dub to be produced before any U.S. company is willing to touch it.  It is GREAT news that it's airing on a CN foreign channel. That does bode well for airing in the U.S. and other English speaking countries on their CN affiliates - but if the dub is good or bad will say a lot about their plans."

Of course there's all the UC units and there's the SHINING FINGER and the Windmill Gundam blueprints."
Gundam,34zaat,CrashmanX,2,Tue May 5 20:20:44 2015 UTC,I noticed the Shining Finger/blue prints as mentioned in the OP. The Turn A regeneration ability also seems to be from FC. FC seems to be over-referenced while the others appear to be shortly shown. I guess it could also mean that FC was the last AU before CC.
Gundam,34zaat,Terminimal,2,Tue May 5 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"I think that's right about the FC being directly before the CC; or, at least, FC has the biggest influence on CC, if you go with the converging-timeline model of the Dark History, instead of the linear model.  There's an art book called The Memory of Second Wind which has some world-building that was never directly discussed in the show. Someone from 4chan posted information gleamed from it. Take it with a grain of salt. But apparently DG Cells were used by eco-terrorists in the period before the Moonlight Butterfly. That, along with the MB's functional resemblance to the DG Cells..."

This is clearly not the case with the Turn A and Turn X nor are they trying to infect other units/people.  Timeline wise, that's not how CC works. All AUs happened at the same time, just in their own timelines. CC is the culmination of all that. A sort of Gundam Valhalla. CC is just a fixed point in space-time where the other series converge. None of them happened before the other. It's not like it went UC-> AC-> AW-> SEED-> FC or anything like that, they all happened at the same time."
Gundam,34zaat,ExpiredSushi,2,Tue May 5 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'd never heard that theory of how CC works.  Is this backed by creator statements at all or is it just your own interpretation?"

Except thats exactly what the Turn X Manual says     ""Black History"" in Turn A Gundam is the records of wars that were sealed away, but also has another meaning- That of the concept that all Gundam series shows, starting with Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979, exist in a single timeline. In other words,1979's Mobile Suit Gundam's UC marks the beginning of humanity's space age, and 1999's Turn A Gundam's CC is its final stage. The timelines broadcast up to that point, G's FC, Wing's AC, and X's AW, as well as 2002's Seed's CE, 2007's 00's AD, and 2011's Age's AG, and all other Gundam series to come are a part of black history as well (Gundam Build Fighters seems to be an exception).

Similar to how many folk tales and mythologies have some basis of truth, they could have been dramatized through time. Like the story of SEED is really just someone else's take on the events of Mobile Suit Gundam.

However things like Australia being destroyed isn't persistent into 00 or SEED or Wing or whatever series would follow. It's still just good old Aussie-land. Same goes for G Gundam and the damage that's done there. Or does the Devil Gundam come back at the end of each series all Mass Effect Reapers style and resets the whole solar system?

Gundam,34z1or,Fenixius,3,Thu May 7 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"But... like... sigh I don't mean to get into a big thing at all, but it's just not excellent.  The art was worse. Probably due to having so many more mecha to animate, 3v3 compared to 1v1, but it was so noticeable all the time. Every fight felt worse compared to GBF.  The mecha design was par. GBFT had some great designs, and some very average ones. Basically everything in GBF was amazing, though. I'm glad that SDs got so much more spotlight, though.  The combat choreography was worse. Much less damage, many fewer cool dodges and use of secondary or tertiary weapons. Even the melee combat had less finesse than what Fenice and Sengoku were able to pull out, despite being a leading role in this one! The only fight that came close was with Junya's Denial.  The music was good. Same guy. Well done. No complaints.  The character development was shallower, especially for the non-protagonists. So many one-off bad guys. The relationship-y stuff felt so much more tacked on, because it was. It was there just to make triangles for the hell of it. Nobody involved got any sincere moments at all. Compare with the Aila v Reiji fight that was also a huge emotional payoff.  Not only that, but Sei had relationships with his parents, his classmates, other builders, and his rivals. Fumino got to have relationships with Sekai and Yuuma, Gyanko (kinda), Lady Meijin (kinda)... and basically nobody else. No family, no meaningful interactions with rivals, nothing but vague, out of nowhere and only because it's fanservice-type shipping, except with Yuuma.  The final battle was so, so much worse... it felt like I was watching yugioh or beyblade, not gunpla.  I'm glad you loved it! I watched it excitedly every week! But it's just... nothing close to the first season in terms of quality on basically any axis except the music. GBF was 8/10. GBFT was 5-6/10."

Gundam,34zl78,SolDarkHunter,2,Tue May 5 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"I typically don't skip things, the only reason I watched 08th was because I heard it didn't really have deep ties to the other series, and I did a lot of reading beforehand to make sure watching CCA was okay before ZZ."
Gundam,34zl78,janitorwookie,1 point,Wed May 6 00:01:14 2015 UTC,"I could never get into ZZ. I hated the opening and I stuck with it up to the point the ZZ Gundam was introduced, but I just...couldn't do it. Which Unicorn character had their roots in ZZ?"

Gundam,34zl78,duelistgamer,3,Wed May 6 19:13:34 2015 UTC,For the record you should be good to watch 0080 and 0083. 0080 happens at the end of the one year war and 0083 is basically supposed to bridge the original series to zeta and explain the rise of the titans.
Gundam,34zl78,dam169,1 point,Tue May 5 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"I definitely plan on watching those, that sounds interesting. At this point it's more ""which Gundam series do I not want to watch?"""
Gundam,34zl78,burkmcbork,1 point,Tue May 5 23:22:52 2015 UTC,"0080 is a quick watch but it has a pretty big emotional impact. While I love 0083, the story does come of the rails a bit. Like others have said one character from Unicorn has their roots in ZZ so its important to watch it first (I recommend it anyway despite the early tone issues). But Unicorn might be my favorite Gundam story."
Gundam,34zl78,TheQuestionaut,1 point,Tue May 5 23:55:37 2015 UTC,"Since you watched Zeta before 0080 and 0083, you're very much in the clear to watch them now."

In real life, history is filled with numerous different perceptions and interpretations, and there are countless cases of fabrications gaining momentum and being treated as fact. In the end, it may be that people only believe what they want to believe."
Gundam,34yomc,Char_X_3,3,Wed May 6 02:49:59 2015 UTC,I probably would've only had the UC timeline mentioned in Turn A.  All other timelines (aside UC & G-Reco) should've been after Turn A. But it is what it is.
Gundam,34yomc,hawksaber,1 point,Tue May 5 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"It's been mentioned a lot recently but that wouldn't neccerssarily work with the current Gundam multiverse outlined, in your suggested case I would personally remove all traces of the Timeline convergence and make it a direct successor to RC."
Gundam,34yomc,dodododuo,2,Wed May 6 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"I would remove a lot of things from the Dark History.   Normal A.D. era (Not 00) -> U.C. Era -> Collapse of the Earth Federation -> R.C. Era  -> Turn A Destroys Civilization -> C.C. Era.  I prefer to just keep Tomino works in this timeline because it makes more sense. I just really don't like seeing this sense of continuous space conflict, plus the certain pauses of technology, and because it makes a lot of what a lot of Gundam series preach about kinda worthless (Wing and X especially).  The Dark History's horrors could be easily be summed from just Tomino's works alone, plus the stuff humanity did a long time ago, in real life.   A.D:    All of the previous wars of Mankind WWI  WWII  Possible future wars before U.C. era   U.C:   One Year War (0079/0080/08th/Others) Operation Stardust (0083) Gryps Conflict (Zeta) 1st Neo Zeon War (ZZ) 2nd Neo Zeon War (CC) 3rd Neo Zeon War (Unicorn) Oldsmobile Zeon War (F90) Crossbone Vanguard War (F91) Jupiter Empire War (Crossbone) Zanscare Empire War (Victory) Possible Collapse of Earth Federation   R.C:   Destabilization of Earth Creation of the Kuntala Amerian-Gondwan War Reconguista of Earth (G Reco)   C.C:   Human Civilization wars itself over the direction of humanity  Conflict between Turn A and Turn X  Annihilation of Human Civilization (Earth, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and other settlements) Possible wars between new nations of Earth Moonrace-Earth War (Turn A)"
Gundam,34yomc,Solitak,1 point,Wed May 6 02:45:05 2015 UTC,"A minor issue, but I thought that the destabilization of Earth and creation of the Kuntala were features of the Universal Century; in the UC 0200s, 0400s, 0600s, et cetera. Bell's class in the Capital Guard was the 1010th, and if those classes are yearly, the planet's been stable enough to maintain the space elevator since 0004 R.C., and perhaps the whole SU-Cordist system around the elevator."

Gundam,34yomc,Solitak,1 point,Wed May 6 11:30:36 2015 UTC,"I'd add a prequel that portrays the Earth Sphere just prior to the Moonlight Butterfly. It'd be 2671 E.C., of the Errant Century.  Basically, it's a hodgepodge of all the current alternate universes. There's a Neo Ameria, a Neo Japan, a Neo Holland, which all still participate in a Gundam Fight (the 1000th Gundam Fight just occurred a few years prior, though nobody really knows how many Fights there have actually been, they lost count sometime). But there's also a Neo Sanc Kingdom, a Neo Orb Union, and a Neo Estard, and a Neo United Nations Earth Federation which opposes the Gundam Fight and claims ownership of all the other ""Neo"" nations. And the Gundam Fight doesn't look anything like the one in G Gundam, it's fought with WaDoms and SUMOs and FLATs.   The Ades mass driver is still operational, in the shadow of the ruins of the space elevator, which some people claim was known as the SU-Cord of the Capital Territory, and others claim was the Tower of the Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations, one of three along the equator.  Historians debate which histories are true, which are myths, and in what order the various eras occurred. A few speak of a temporal anomaly at the start of the Errant Century. (Amuro said, ""One day people will even be able to control time..."") And the territorial claims from these conflicting histories add fuel to the constant fire of war that eventually leads to the battle between the Turn A and Turn X."

The Universal Century is supposed to take over A.D. somewhere between 1988 and 2001 (depending on if you ask Tomino or if you look at some time stamp stuff in the animated series). But uh....00 takes place well after that. G Saviour takes place in U.C. 0223, which would be like 2224 A.D. at the latest. Then the only thing we have of the Reguild Century is in 1014. Gundam 00 takes place in 2307 AD. with some events taking place in 2299. So sometime in 75 years all the colonies went mia along with the technology to make nuclear power systems for Mobile Suits, and the technology to make colonies because they're working on that stuff too. SO uh yeah its a little hard to sneak 00 in."
Gundam,34yomc,iceman_in_black,2,Tue May 5 21:03:09 2015 UTC,"UC and 00 aren't in the same universe. CC isn't even in the same universe.  Please for the love of god people, stop trying to view CC as a singular timeline. It's not. It's an overlap in space-time. Multiverse theory. All the AUs happen in their own timelines.  UC and 00 are not connected. UC happens in one branch of our timeline, 00 happens in a different branch. Meanwhile yet still Gunpla Builders happens in another branch too, and Build Fighters is also it's own separate branch.  All of these ""branches"" then overlap at the CC point. They overlap with AC, AW, FC, and CE. (Well, UC does, the others don't) This creates the CC.   Do you understand now? All roads lead to Rome, but that does not mean all roads cross."

This Gundam timeline is noted for its similarities with the Universal Century timeline started by the first Mobile Suit Gundam' series. With Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, the Cosmic Era universe is the only other Gundam universe other than the Universal Century with multiple full-length TV series (though the AD timeline chose to split its 50 episode run into two seasons). Before that, the second most developed universe was Gundam Wing's After Colony universe, with one TV series, one OVA series and a compilation movie. The Universal Century universe remains by far the most developed one, with four TV series, four OVA series, fifteen theatrical releases, and various specials.

I just went through the OST and tried to dig up any guitar-heavy songs I could. Hopefully one of these is what you seek."

Gundam,34v1vy,AleksVin,8,Mon May 4 20:16:30 2015 UTC,An episode dedicated to the Ball in MS IGLOO.
Gundam,34v1vy,HamEaterQC,4,Mon May 4 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"Balls vs Oggos was awesome, such a sad ending though. Man I love MS Igloo."
Gundam,34v1vy,DefrostedTuna,5,Mon May 4 21:54:19 2015 UTC,"Gundam 0079: the start of the real-mecha genre, where the pilot isn't a Saturday morning paragon with friends/family who have off-screen magic powers to repair everything for the next episode.  MS Igloo 1 + 2: an interesting take on a group of grunts on both sides. Considering that Zeon was always trying to innovate new ideas for the OYW, the first MS Igloo series is interesting too.   Gundam 0080: a story that centers around the views of Spacenoids during the OYW that aren't a part of Side 3.   Gundam 0083: a plot that displays how one-dimensional and deluded Zeonism became with the Zabi influences, and how the Federation's military became corrupt post-OYW.  Zeta Gundam: the rise and fall of the Titans, along with the small glimmers here and there that showed that the world isn't black and white. Kamille as a character going from indecisive brat to soldier before being brain-panned is probably one of the strongest character developments I've been in a classic anime.   ZZ Gundam: just because the Titans were a wash doesn't mean that the remnants of Zeon will suddenly remember what it means to have dignity, honor, and morals. The endless chain of different mono-eye suits continues, as does another protagonist getting thrown in the middle of things that shouldn't be his problem.  Char's Counterattack: the final piece of Char's development as a character. Though how CCA shows it is highly debatable (from medicore to confusing as hell), the fact that they decided to wrap up Char's development with such a radical plan is a good finisher.  Gundam Unicorn: the plot is a giant mcguffin chase, but damn if it isn't an excellent UC-setting mcguffin chase.   No comments for anything else. Maybe I'll come back and add some later."
Gundam,34v1vy,Gfaqshoohaman,6,Mon May 4 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"Gundam Unicorn is definitely my favorite of all time. The production value, music, and animation were top tier. Not to mention I found the series to be inspirational, and deeply profound."
Gundam,34v1vy,saekheart,5,Mon May 4 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"I like how SEED Destiny had brief little funny moments every so often, like those guys talking about how hot Meer is and Athrun busts them, or the scene with Kira, Lacus, and Athrun in the shopping mall. Gundam can be pretty humorless sometimes, so a little bit of comic relief every now and then can go a long way."
Gundam,34v1vy,Diamo1,4,Mon May 4 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"First Gundam: Amuro's final line, apologizing to Lalah for still having the will to live was beautifully heartbreaking. The scene where Amuro shoots the Zeon soldiers in his mother's medical tent before they even see him was a surprising twist to a cliché scene I felt like I'd seen a million times. The old, classic sound effects and funky 70s soundtrack are incredibly charming. Amuro seems like a realistic example of how a normal, privileged yet capable teenager would react on being more-or-less forced into military service as a civilian, Newtype abilities aside. And saving the Newtype phenomenon for the last few episodes of the series was an interesting choice, reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey's shift from near-future hard sci-fi to mind-bending science fantasy. Zeta Gundam: Incredible soundtrack, and in my opinion the most solid and consistent aesthetic. Designs I thought were dopey in First Gundam made perfect sense drawn in Zeta, and it was neat to see how different it could feel from First Gundam, even just with the first episode title card for ""Black Gundam"" and its voiceover. Gundam ZZ: What really stands out to me is seeing another side to Bright Noa; a man who's exhausted from both the OYW and the Gryps Conflict, a man who, instead of slapping the kids he's brought on to his ship, asks them whether or not they resent him, perhaps wondering what Kamille thought of him before his tragedy. The goofy light-heartedness at the start of the series reinforces how the Shangri-La kids and this whole world are separated from the war we've been in all throughout Zeta. The Dublin drop was beautiful, with a tragic sacrifice from Hayato and debris raining down as Judau and Ple Two weave in and out of the wrecked, upright colony. Victory Gundam: A beautiful and unique soundtrack, very evocative of the forests of Europe seen throughout the first arc of the show. Despite being decades after the events of previous series, most locations seem quieter, almost as if civilization is regressing economically and technologically. The prevalence of rotary wings, both in MSs and in hover-bikes and flying platforms, is one interesting, surprising example of this. G Gundam: That moment I realized Fuun Saiki was the name of the Mobile Horse and the actual horse... who piloted the Mobile Horse. Gundam Wing: It was very interesting to see the five heroes just kind of give up after ten episodes or so, each going there own way and not really knowing what to do. Gundam X: Possibly the best romance in the series. Also, that episode that follows the two older Gundam pilots leaving the Vulture ship to return to their own private lives was a heart-wrenching microcosm of what made that show special, a personal human touch. Finally, the smooth vocal stylings of Warren Wiebe. Turn A Gundam: A pilot that contained no Mobile Suit battles at all, and felt like the start of a Studio Ghibli film. The out-of-the-box creativity that takes the Gundam franchise and gives it pusher-configuration biplanes trying to take out biomechanical-looking Big Zams that the Earthlings treat like the Martians from War of the Worlds. Gundam SEED: The unwanted conflict between Kira and Arthrun was legitimately sad, especially when Nicole and Tolle were pulled into the mix as fuel for the hatred. The way Murrue had to shoot down the ship with Badgiruel on it, thinking that she fired the shot that killed Mu, when we knew that she'd reformed and rebelled against the Blue Cosmos guy. Kira still caring about Flay, even after all her immature behavior, and her redemption in the narrative's eyes, coupled with being Kira's last failure before the ending. Gundam SEED Destiny: I just watched Episode 35. I thought Episode 34 was brilliant, and I think I'll write up a whole little essay on this and how it compares to SEED. Gundam 00: It missed us... That wasn't a shot? It was a beam saber!? Sergei Smirnov, and Hank Hercury's rebellion in the middle of S2, unexpectedly throwing things into disarray for all sides. Gundam AGE: Haven't watched this one, nothing to say. G-Reco: The Mobile Suits and spaceships all looked like delicious hard candy. My eyes would just bathe in the neon-shaded light of an intense MS battle, beams flying all around the screen in various ""solid"" forms. Cumpa and Mask were great villains."
Gundam,34v1vy,Terminimal,4,Tue May 5 09:02:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, here we go   Mobile Suit Gundam: Obviously the thing that started it all. And in an age of computer animation, I'm a sucker for that 70s cel art (also applies to Macross) 08th MS Team: I really, really loved the real world feel of it. The RX-79[G] wasn't a ""super prototype"", it was basically a souped up RGM-79[G]. It really pushed that the Mobile Suits are just tools of war like tanks and jeeps. Stuff breaks down and they have to improvise.  0080: ""War Is Hell"" and ""Hamburger"", enough said 0083: Setting up the Titans, and damn if the GP01 Full Vernier isn't one of my favorite designs. Both OPs are good as well Zeta: Features one of my favorite designs of all time (the Zeta). Took everything that made MSG good and made it better. ZZ: I actually liked the early goofy episodes believe it or not. The Judau/Haman interactions were also interesting to watch. Lastly: ANIME JA NAI!! Char's Counterattack: The end of the Char/Amuro rivalry, 'nuff said. Also the Nu Gundam (and Hi-Nu) are sexy as hell F91: Um, the suit design is pretty badass (been forever since I watched F91) Victory: WINGS OF LIGHT!! Also ""Stand Up To The Victory"". Also best use of the Core Block/Combination system in the entire mythos. Uso and Shakti are adorable as well (they just wanted to be left alone...) G-Saviour: Umm...the idea was decent? The MS design itself was pretty good as well G: This is the series that gave us /r/Gundam's favorite meme! I also loved Chibodee, mangled Engrish and all. X: The freaking Gundam X Divider. I love random acts of engineering like that. Also Garrod being voice by The Great Teacher himself is freaking amazing. Oh, one of my favorite sequences in Gundam Garrod in the cockpit of the newly discovered GX, Tiffa unconscious, them under attack ""If this works I'll believe in God"" Garrod slams the G-Controller into it's slot, the GX activates, Tiffa wakes up ""TIFFA!! I BELIEVE IN GOD!!"" cue WTF look from Tiffa I just love Gundam X over all, so I'll stop now :) Wing: Wing got me into Gundam, so there is that. Other than that, the animation was slick for it's time when it wanted to be. Also Endless Waltz is freaking gorgeous  Turn-A: CENTURY COLOR! MILLION COLOR!!! Okay, a couple of the goofiest OPs in Gundam, some of the goofiest antagonists (""UNIVERSE!!!"") and esoteric MS designs all make Turn-A something else. Oh and it was written by a guy we may have heard of by the name of Tomino. SEED: Animation was really good, story was good. Freedom is one of my favorite MS designs period. I also feel like it's conflict between the Naturals and Coordinators might be a prophecy as we start playing with biotech and genetic research in the real world. Also the OPs and EDs are some of the best in the mythos (actually almost all the OPs and EDs from SEED onward are excellent as a rule, so just assume this going forward). SEED Destiny: I really enjoyed it up until the midpoint (Freedom/Impulse fight). Actually the Freedom vs Impulse fight is probably one of my favorite fights in the entire mythos. 00: As sexy as the suits are, what is the high point of 00 for me are it's characters. Saji, Sergei, Soma, Lockon (both of them), Tiera and even Setsuna, they all get massive character development and none of them are the same people they were at the beginning of the show (especially Saji, holy cow).  Age: I have to give AGE credit. They had a massively ambitious idea, and it was a very good idea. They just tried to cram it into 52 episodes when it should have had maybe twice that number. Also the AGE-2 Normal and the AGE-FX are slick as hell G-Reco: TSUKAME PRAIDO! TSUKAME SUCCESS!!. The artwork is absolutely drop dead amazing. Gundam Build Fighters/GBF Try: Blatant Gunpla commercials they may be, but they are love letters to the Gundam fanbase and got me excited for Gundam like I haven't been in a very long time"
Gundam,34v1vy,KyralRetsam,5,Tue May 5 17:45:43 2015 UTC,SEED Destiny had an opening theme I really liked!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyfZRmYBQ2s
Gundam,34v1vy,bucklau,2,Mon May 4 20:40:09 2015 UTC,I like the mecha designs in Destiny. They look like UC suits customized for overkill/looking cool like they were in Build Fighters or something.  Also love Wings of Words and Reason.
Gundam,34v1vy,Char_X_3,4,Mon May 4 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"Sticking with ones that aren't my favourite:   When you look at Coordinators who aren't Rau Le Creuset, SEED does a great job of making both sides sympathetic. Both the AGE system and the multi-generation story were fairly interesting and ambitious ideas."
Gundam,34v1vy,alkonium,3,Mon May 4 20:51:56 2015 UTC,00: humanity gets to meet aliens!
Gundam,34v1vy,yacoob,2,Tue May 5 00:28:42 2015 UTC,Both Zeta and ZZeta have the best sound tracks (I actually went out and got a physical copy of the ZZ OST.)   I enjoyed how short 0080 was.   Gundam Wing makes for a fun drinking game (IT'S A GUNDAM!!!!)  G Gundam's multitude of unique mobile suits.  Unicorn puts all the pieces from Zeta onwards together in a more or less well rounded way.
Gundam,34v1vy,kraigerex1,2,Tue May 5 00:39:20 2015 UTC,Mechs
Gundam,34v1vy,lq13,2,Tue May 5 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"08th MS Team: Provided a much more grounded, militaristic view of mobile suit combat, reflected especially in the desert episode (the need to keep sand out of the MS joints for example) and in the final episodes, where the consequence of destroying a mobile suits power supply was focused on. This more grounded approach made the appearance of an ace pilot (Packard) seem even more impressive."
Gundam,34v1vy,LordRevann,2,Tue May 5 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"In general, giant mechs zooming around shooting lasers and missiles and swinging beam sabers at each other."
Gundam,34v1vy,metalslug123,2,Tue May 5 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"For the most part i think the music is something that is done well in the majority of gundam shows, hard to think of any that were properly bad."
Gundam,34upte,shpeilin,5,Mon May 4 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"I went to Gundam Front Tokyo in January during the New Years time. I didn't pre-order any tickets (actually forgot about that), and just bought it on the day of. I don't think I went on a weekend, so that may have impacted the number of tickets, but it seemed like there were plenty left.  As long as it isn't a busy scheduled day (festival, holiday, etc), I wouldn't see why they would sell out."
Gundam,34upte,PineappleBuns,3,Mon May 4 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"Been there three times and I've never had to wait. You'll be fine as long as you get there on time. I have seen a line for the Gundam Cafe in Akihabara, but never in Odaiba -- however I've seen them tape it off from access in the event of a musical performance.  Last year, there was a cute girl working at the Aki Cafe who spoke perfect English and knew a lot about Gundam. I don't remember her name, but if you go there and see her, talk to her because she is really cool."
Gundam,34upte,Netegexi,2,Mon May 4 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  when I went it was a weekday and there was one other group of people in the whole place. I don't think it gets crazy busy enough to sell out very often"
Gundam,34upte,dam169,2,Mon May 4 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"As everyone else I had no line whatsoever and basically all if the place to myself when I visited on a weekday.   You can do the gundam cafes as a novelty, but the food is shit, expensive and you will have to stand in line for quite some time so be prepared for that."
Gundam,34upte,jeekl,1 point,Tue May 5 09:42:24 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Although I think I only waited about 15 minutes on line to order and get my food. I won't say that the food was bad, but I had better food elsewhere in Tokyo. I bought it because they were giving out commemorative shot glasses The presentation is nice, but you could probably ask someone if its okay to take a picture."
Gundam,34upte,Ace370,1 point,Tue May 5 14:17:03 2015 UTC,I've been twice at random times and never had a line. I don't think it's popular enough to need reservations anymore. But as mentioned you'll need to line up for the gundam cafe at lunchtimes though.
Gundam,34upte,mrwafu,1 point,Tue May 5 01:17:02 2015 UTC,"You don't need a reservation for GFT, but if you're going over the summer, you should probably get reservation tickets for The Art of Gundam. Here's some more pics. How you will get reservation tickets.....that's the harder part. The site says that the tickets will be available soon, but you need a Japanese email address to reserve the tickets on various vender websites or you can pick up the tickets at 7-11 in Japan. I went to this exhibit last summer in Osaka and its a must see for any fan of the original series. Luckily I had gotten someone to buy the tickets for me before hand, but I didn't get to do the Gunpla building event which would've been so sweet. The bad parts are that you are not allowed to take pictures at the exhibit, and like only 5% of everything is in English. I remember Gundam Front Tokyo being much more English friendly, but be prepared to not understand any dialog in the G-dome if you don't know any Japanese.   The best advice I can give you about GFT is to not buy any Gunpla unless its a GFT exclusive. GFT Gunpla prices are much cheaper than it is in western countries, but you'll find even better prices in Akibahara. Also, check out everything else that they have in Diver City. They have some great stores there and some very cool people walking around. Like someone else said, I also met this gorgeous girl working in Diver City (not the Gundam Cafe) who I still chat with everyday. As long as you dont give off that Otaku vibe, and you understand just a little bit of Japanese, they'll be happy to strike up a conversation with you.  tl;dr: No RSVP necessary but don't buy any Gunpla if you can go to Akibahara instead. Check out the Art of Gundam exhibit too if you have the time     Edit for spelling mistakes and grammar"
Gundam,34w8cv,-ProFound-,3,Tue May 5 01:55:34 2015 UTC,"Well, Sunrise's official stance is that all animated works are cannon, even if they are different from the works that they are based on and thus came first, which is something that has always bothered me. How can the source material not be canon, but the adaptation be? Eh. Oh well.  So I'd say yes. And considering that it largely portrays stuff we've never seen animated, it's all fine and dandy. However, there are some differences to what's been established in UC lore. Originally, the Zaku was the first mobile suit, but in Origin, the Guntank predated it by a fair bit (though one could argue it's mobile suit status), and in the manga (it's made no appearance in the OVA yet), the Guncannon also was around before Project V, and so that's a little different from the original portrayal of events in MSG."
Gundam,34w8cv,PantsBonanza,2,Tue May 5 02:12:06 2015 UTC,It is kind of refreshing for an anime series to not be based in a manga for its canon for a change though. Though god knows that has had its issues due to the foggy status of Astray and Crossbone's canonicity because of that.
Gundam,34w8cv,AkiZayoi,1 point,Tue May 5 02:52:55 2015 UTC,"My point was that I find it strange that a manga or novel could be written, and then an anime could be made based off of it, but have events changed, and yet still be considered more canon than the original. That doesn't really make sense, you know? How could the original be less canon, since it came first? Just an irksome sort of thing, but not really a big deal."
Gundam,34w8cv,PantsBonanza,1 point,Tue May 5 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"It's like saying the avengers movies are cannon, but the comic stories theyre based on aren't (as they pertain to the MCU). that's how ive always percieved it, the anime universe canon and the manga universe canon. different mediums, different canons.   of course, many of the animated stories contradict each other too, so i've just learned to pick what i like ,haha"
Gundam,34w8cv,wjapple,1 point,Tue May 5 11:36:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's a little silly, so it's best to just watch/read and enjoy."
Gundam,34w8cv,PantsBonanza,1 point,Tue May 5 13:44:46 2015 UTC,Thanks
Gundam,34w8cv,CidImmacula,0,Tue May 5 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"Never do I recall Zaku being mentioned as the first Mobile Suit. Even then the first Mobile Suit hasn't appeared outside of a short animation yet iirc (it's a suit that explodes by itself, only 3 were made, only 1 is kept as a tribute to Zeon's accomplishment)  Guntank can be considered a Mobile Armor, probably more so since tanks are considered ""mobile armor"". I believe the German for Tank actually literally means that...I think.  Anyway, it won't be surprising for Guncannon to be around before Project V. They would have needed a basis for RX-78-1 anyway. Similarly the RX-78-1 may have predated Project V itself, as it was 2 who has used in Project V. Similarly the White Base's Guncannon has a very unique mechanic to it, Core Fighter.  Now unless the manga has a Core Fighter as well, that Guncannon may not be actually part of Project V, but an older predecessor.  HOWEVER. I remember that RX-78-2 Origins Ver. has been set for release/is released. That somewhat says we should expect RX-78-2 to actually appear in Origins OVA, either as a WIP, or fielded and possibly overlapping with MSG. (RX-78-2 is what Amuro used). Guncannon cannot be far behind that, even if it's the one Kai used."
Gundam,34w8cv,PantsBonanza,2,Tue May 5 05:25:14 2015 UTC,"Well, okay, if you want to get technical, no, the Zaku isn't the first mobile suit, though it is the first mass produced mobile suit and the first mobile suit fielded for use. MS-01 through MS-04 all predate it, but they are all testbed units that went into the development of the Zaku.  As for the Guntank and the Guncannon, no I don't think it's a stretch to say that they could have come before Project V. I was just saying that their existence before it is something that is different between MSG and Origin. Personally, I think it makes more sense the way Origin is doing it. Not having any mobile suits and then having the EFF pop out three separate designs and go from there just seemed a little silly and didn't really flow well in my mind. Them predating the Gundam by a good bit makes way more sense to me."
Gundam,34w8cv,phizer0,1 point,Tue May 5 13:51:32 2015 UTC,"Where did you see that RX-78-02 Origin Ver. is getting a release? I know they are re-releasing the HGUC RX-78-2 with updated proportions and such, but I don't think THAT model has anything to do with Origin the manga or OVA. There's distinct design features the Origins manga granddaddy has to differentiate it from the MSG granddaddy"
Gundam,34w8cv,CidImmacula,1 point,Tue May 5 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"Hum, released, fix figuration. 3 years old.  http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10146818  I suppose I remembered incorrectly then.  Edit:  I missed the number detail. http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/RX-78-02_Gundam  The Origins one has a 0. In any case, that was at least given a fix figuration, how it will affect the OVA is now beyond me."
Gundam,34w8cv,BoyGodz,-5,Tue May 5 05:49:24 2015 UTC,"""Anime=Canon"" is just silly and if that is the stance Sunrise takes, then either that is just a statement to stop people asking the same question, or they have no idea how canon works. I see this ""anime=canon"" idea thrown around a lot here but I have never seen any official or nonofficial statement saying that, I would really like a source on that."
Gundam,34w8cv,PantsBonanza,2,Tue May 5 03:01:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, maybe saying it is the Sunrise's official stance is a bit incorrect, but it's really more like hierarchy of canonical things. The discussion over here goes pretty in depth about it, and is a good read anyways."
Gundam,34w8cv,BoyGodz,1 point,Tue May 5 03:14:19 2015 UTC,"It is still doesn't make sense, anime series often invalidate each other already. I mean if all animated stuff are canon, then is the Zeta movie ending more canon or the whole ZZ, CCA and UC? How did 08ms team gets GM and Ground Gundams when GM weren't in production yet? What about Origin and 0079? Because those two definitely don't link up very well.  I know for a fact that Japanese aren't high on the idea of having one ""canon"" timeline and prefer to have everything canon in their own alternative universe, so I guess I'm sticking to that too. MSG is canon in its anime universe and the MSG novel is in its own separate universe, so is GTO in the Origin universe, both the Core Booster and G-Armor exists and that is that. It is the only way that it make sense and not trying shoehorn everything into a ""Canon"""
Gundam,34w8cv,PantsBonanza,2,Tue May 5 03:37:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The Japanese aren't too keen on canon, so in the end, this discussion doesn't really get us anywhere.   What we all should do is just watch/read/whatever and enjoy it, and not worry to much about the details."
Gundam,34w8cv,BoyGodz,1 point,Tue May 5 04:51:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely, it is pointless to classify what is canon and what is not, after all there is no answer because there is no such thing as canon in Japanese anime."
Gundam,34w8cv,CitrusChrome,1 point,Tue May 5 08:14:57 2015 UTC,"You can kind of shoehorn it all together although there are still large holes (especially in concept) with Origin they are implying that the guntanks are not related to MS, as far as GM the cobbled together cannon has the prototype out in September then the production of the RGM-79 happening in November, so that's why you see them in October in 8th MS team. Obviously there is alot of contradiction in those months but most UC series seem largely self contained imo."
Gundam,34w8cv,BoyGodz,1 point,Tue May 5 03:51:29 2015 UTC,"It has to a huge stretch to link up Origin and MSG, there are so many details that is different from the anime MSG that it doesn't work chaining the both together (Namely, the age setting, Gundam's weapon set, Guncannon and Guntank being inferior, Gundam not being the first EFF MS, the real Char, The missing Jaburo 4 that later reappeared in Unicorn or the actual plot change of going to Jaburo before Odessa, just to name a few). The past proportion of the Origin is supposed to link up to the Origin version of the OYW, it just doesn't really work to have it as Canon in the anime universe.  Part of the success in GMs making their appearance in Jaburo is that the Zeon never expected EFF to have mass produced MS. Not that having early produced GM doesn't fix the plot hole, but it raise a different question, why did Zeon not anticipate EFF to have MS in their most important base?"
Gundam,34w8cv,CitrusChrome,1 point,Tue May 5 04:33:52 2015 UTC,OH you mean the manga! lol I thought you were just referring to the movie. So I'm waiting for them to finish before I start it but from my understanding they rewrote a good bit of 0079 to fix canon issues with the original anime. Again I haven't even started the Origin manga.
Gundam,34w8cv,starcolored,1 point,Tue May 5 16:15:56 2015 UTC,"Zeta ANT is alternate U.C., so there's no reason why it can't be canon and not conflict with the main timeline. Origin is probably safely viewed as alternate U.C. as well.  As for 08th, GM and Gundam ground types are essentially experimental units, so the mass-production GM doesn't need to come before them, just like the E-type GM Sanders uses for the first episode. It's not silly to think that there would be prototype test units to gather data before the production of mass-produced ones."

I know Zeta Movies are in an alternate universe, it is pretty clear actually, but some people seems to think there is a one universe that is ""Canon"" and in that universe it includes everything animated, which is clearly not the case.

The operation hinges on Jaburo being hard to enter but relatively weak on the inside due to not having MS to fight back inside the base, hence they sent those Zeon Marines inside to ambush them. Why would Zeon not know the existence of GMs when they have been fighting against them for technically months already?   Here is my comment further down: ""Part of the success in GMs making their appearance in Jaburo is that the Zeon never expected EFF to have mass produced MS. Not that having early produced GM doesn't fix the plot hole, but it raise a different question, why did Zeon not anticipate EFF to have MS in their most important base?""  Trying to fit all animated UC stuffs in one ""Canon"" timeline is impossible. If the battle of Jaburo remains the same, then there is no version of MSG, whether series or movies or Origin, that will lead to 08ms team. Ironically, the only version which does give a little more room to fit in 08ms team in its universe, is the novel version, which is considered ""non-canon""."
Gundam,34w8cv,starcolored,1 point,Tue May 5 16:18:54 2015 UTC,"I know Zeta Movies are in an alternate universe, it is pretty clear actually, but some people seems to think there is a one universe that is ""Canon"" and in that universe it includes everything animated, which is clearly not the case.   It's pretty obvious that Zeta movies and TV can't co-exist in the same timeline just like the MSG movies and TV so I don't think people really go around acting like that nor have I really seen it happen personally, but okay.   GMs are first shown in Jaburo and Jaburo only, this is made very clear in MSG.   The RGM-79 seen in Jaburo is not the same machine as RX-79[G] or RGM-79[G] so that doesn't really matter.   Why would Zeon not know the existence of GMs when they have been fighting against them for technically months already?   Of course Zeon already knew of the GM. Do you not remember that Char's team infiltrated Jaburo explicitly to plant explosives on them? Obviously Zeon knew the Federation had MS capabilities, they had been fighting the Gundam (among other things) for weeks at that point.

Like I said, I don't really see people going around trying to pretend it's all part of the same timeline except for maybe some early confusion about Origin.   By saying all animated things = canon, they are subscribing to the idea already, and I see plenty of these people.  EDIT: I don't disagree with what you said about alternate universe.  My point being, by having a ""canon"" you eliminate the possibility of having two equal and separate universe, that's the idea of having a canon, only one version of the event happens. If UC does have a Canon, we have to decide which version of Zeta, or MSG or CCA or Unicorn has actually happened in this Canon and which is just alternate ""if"" worlds, i.e. which one is more canon than the other, so to say. If all animated works have the same canon-ticity then we just end up with contradiction everywhere.  ""Animated = Canon"" is totally false for those reasons."

Nobody's treating it like that, nor is a retcon the same thing as ""one canon timeline"". It also doesn't matter whether you're comparing it against sequels or the TV series. Since it can't work with either one it tells you either way that it can't be in the same timeline.

They encountered the GM BEFORE the sabotage operation, so there was no switching of targets only after learning of its existence. They also never mention the Gundam being the original intended target, and in fact seem to head straight for the GMs. Plus, if the original plan was to go for the Gundam, they should have only had enough bombs to blow up one MS. Also, again, the RX-79[G] and RGM-79[G] are not mass-production machines.  And interestingly enough, it's never any of the Zeons who mistake GMs for Gundams but the crew of the White Base. I think it was just Sayla and the kids, but Amuro knew.   By saying all animated things = canon, they are subscribing to the idea already, and I see plenty of these people.

I will just say that is how people are using the term now, whether we like it or not. Search for ""Canon"" in this Sub and see for yourself how many people ask whether they should watch xxx because they are not sure it belongs to ""that one timeline"" and note which word they used. Or how many reply saying ""it is technically not canon"", if they do subscribe to the AU idea, there is no ""technically not canon"" for them.

Gundam,34w8cv,iceman_in_black,0,Tue May 5 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"Hmmm well glancing over this kind of answers one question. The typical rule of thumb has been if it's anime it's canon. G Savoir isn't animated (obviously it has a copious amount of cg but it's live action) but it doesn't fall into a novel, manga or game category either. This says anything filmed is canon, which would include G Savoir. So that plus no official statement from Sunrise saying it isn't canon, we have to conclude that, at this point in time, G Savoir is canon."

Gundam,34qskf,Vatepgo1,2,Mon May 4 04:45:00 2015 UTC,"Correct Correct again, his name was Gilboa I think When he was escaping Palau an unnamed mobile suit spotted him and he was forced to shoot it down. It was the only kill he ever intentionally made."
Gundam,34qskf,strikeraiser,2,Mon May 4 04:53:57 2015 UTC,I think Bellri and Loran also have least number of kill.
Gundam,34qskf,Palikun,1 point,Mon May 4 04:55:47 2015 UTC,Nah I think Bellri still managed to kill a lot more pilots in G Reco.  Not so sure about Loran though.
Gundam,34qskf,krizalid70559,1 point,Mon May 4 12:56:39 2015 UTC,Shouldn't we be counting Sortie Victories seeing as Gundams are basically humanoid planes. Seems like and easier measure especially when half the roster is killing entire colonies of civilians.
Gundam,34qskf,JealotGaming,1 point,Mon May 4 13:28:07 2015 UTC,Sai from Seed probably has the lowest kill count
Gundam,34qskf,TitaniumHeart,1 point,Mon May 4 16:13:53 2015 UTC,Setsuna participated in what? 60 interventions? I think that's a pretty large count. The least would probably be Louise Halevy.

Gundam,34pzls,abnormalninja,11,Sun May 3 14:59:29 2015 UTC,"Reborn is a lot better. I sunk a ton of time into 3 but it wasn't very rewarding. Seemed like each segment of the 'story' felt halfhearted and monotonous, and there wasn't much reason to try any other mode. Reborn has got a great big story mode of the different series and it's ultimate mode is challenging and fun. There's a ton of suits at pilots, plus you can put custom music in the game. They're both mindless hack and slash games but Reborn gives you replayability and more rewarding gameplay."

Gundam,34pzls,TRB1783,0,Mon May 4 07:43:58 2015 UTC,"nah, i found a physical copy. It's just that these sort of copies are rare. Dynasty Warrior games in general are a niche, let alone DW:G titles, so they're not produced in a high yield. Note, rare doesn't mean it's expensive to find. :)"
Gundam,34pzls,thatsupervillain,1 point,Sun May 3 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"Europe got a physical release, you have a PAL region copy.  North America was digital-only, so there are no physical NTSC region copies."

Gundam,34pzls,KaziArmada,2,Sun May 3 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"No dub, which ends up being preferable because the usual dub is cheese u and repetitive. At least in Japanese you can't understand it!"
Gundam,34pzls,existingsvb,-1,Sun May 3 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"If I'm going to be nattered at repetitively, I'd rather have it be in a language I can understand. Besides, I find the Japanese voices shrill and grating. The English dub usually employs the same actors from the various TV series, which gives it some nostalgia points."
Gundam,34pzls,NeonLightIllusion,1 point,Sun May 3 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, Reborn wasn't dubbed, I'm afraid. So.. you kind of get a better story, more suits, more characters, but lose out on the voices being dubbed, whereas 3 has an english dub and some DLC units to add options, but has a sub-par playability.    Note, I've not yet managed to play mine as I have LOST my cable to hook my PS3 up to an older tv (no HDMI on my personal TV... I would update it, but that TV is mostly for retrogaming, so I would need an AVMULTI-SCART cable to plug it in.) If you want me to double-check, I'll try hooking up the PS3 to the HD TV in a coupe hours to look. :)"

Gundam,34pzls,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun May 3 15:09:24 2015 UTC,Three had that weird cel-shading and the menus were all over the place. Two was just simpler to navigate and had much better co-op and overall better gameplay.
Gundam,34pzls,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Mon May 4 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"Reborn feels like it has a lot more to do, especially since there are cards to be collecting that really encourage you to give all the suits, pilots, and partners a try. The story modes in both aren't great so that's kinda a non-factor imo, but gameplay-wise I'd say Reborn is the way to go, even if it is digital-only. Though if you prefer English dub voice-overs, 3 has that while Reborn is sub-only."
Gundam,34pzls,-ProFound-,1 point,Sun May 3 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"I have only played 3, but I enjoy it a lot.

Gundam,34p7hm,strikeraiser,3,Sun May 3 07:39:01 2015 UTC,They mostly got around that issue with the Gundam X being able to transmit commands to G-Bits... Basically GMs that all have a satellite cannon EACH.
Gundam,34p7hm,Shaftronics,3,Sun May 3 08:43:57 2015 UTC,"Firing the cannon places severe strain on the Gundam X's hardware. While it may not drain the Gundam's power supply, just controlling that extreme amount of energy takes a toll. It requires a massive cooldown time in between shots and cannot spam the beam.  So, yes, it really is a ""once-per-sortie"" weapon. Of course, with a weapon that powerful, once is generally enough."
Gundam,34p7hm,SolDarkHunter,2,Sun May 3 07:50:04 2015 UTC,It's hard to say without spoilers so SPOILER ALERT  The SC comes from a moon base which (probably) has a generator and huge batteries which would drain fast. Combine that with what /u/SolDarkHunter said and you see why it isn't used often.
Gundam,34p7hm,IKill4MySkill,1 point,Sun May 3 13:08:06 2015 UTC,"Well Garrod basicaly CAN spam the SC, because IIRC the Sattelite Cannon just channel the power from the beam that the Gundam receive, the power of the SC is from that beam, i think there is a episode which he dodge the beam and let it land on the ground and explosions intensifies"

I know the OST is pretty much ripped to shreds but is it possible to add in a Custom OST? Is the voice acting any good? Is it enjoyable gameplay wise and doesn't get stale after a few levels?
Gundam,34mr37,CrashmanX,3,Sat May 2 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that Reborn is the best of the DWG series, as it combines the best bits of 2 and 3, although i do wish it had a little more variety in its random events like 2 did. (including references to the original story in 1)  So far i've sunk over 120 hours into it and still haven't unlocked everything. I have no regrets :)"
Gundam,34mr37,DeathThreatUK,3,Sat May 2 22:45:44 2015 UTC,"You can add a custom OST. ""Anime Ja Nai"" and the Shining Finger theme are practically essentials. I also recommend adding Kenny Loggins's ""Danger Zone"" for the moments when you play as Quattro.   Gameplay is fun. Maps aren't too varied, but there's a lot of unlockables and a pretty good variety of mobile suits that keep things from getting stale."
Gundam,34mr37,GhostofSpeedwagon,1 point,Sun May 3 04:04:26 2015 UTC,Its pretty much the same as the other Dynasty Warrior Gundam games. There's no english voice acting.

Part of this denial was probably pushing Rain away. They're getting caught up in the hype of the matches, and don't have their own catchphrase. They too have a fist that cries out for victory.

They look kinda like Zakus but they're not. They're Devil Army grunts. And yes, Master Asia was the undefeated of the east for good reason.   IMO I'd say Gundam X should be your next watch.

If I'm wrong and it gets better PLEASE tell me because I'm having trouble finding resolve to watch the rest of it.

Gundam,34nbr4,baconbitarded,1 point,Sun May 3 05:36:35 2015 UTC,"It def gets better, and the whole thing with the Satellite Cannon is it's a huge deal to fire that thing so they don't want to unless they have to. As noted by one of the early episodes where Garrod wipes out all those people while Tifa was in the cockpit."

Gundam,34nbr4,CybranKNight,1 point,Sat May 2 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"G Gundam was was full of filler stories but that's part of the charm of the series (to me) since it felt a lot more like a shonen anime than a mobile suit anime.   And yeah, the show does not hold up too well but its still enjoyable. Its over the top and zaney and it's just a blast sometimes. If you don't take it too seriously its a lot easier to enjoy G Gundam.   Domon is really only mean to Rain in the beginning of the series but he doesn't really want her around.  He's using the Gundam Fight to look for his brother and she's a constant reminder that he has something else to do besides what he wants.  He also strikes me as someone whose nervous to get to know someone and trust them, hence keeping Rain at arms length.  Schwartz kinda alludes to this and Domon needs to open up more to fully realize his potential. Super Mode for the Shining Gundam is just his rage amplified, hence why Master Asia is constantly trying to force Domon into it."
Gundam,34nbr4,UCMCoyote,1 point,Sun May 3 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"If you were looking for a good classic shounen vibe (fun fact: all Gundam shows are at most shounen in PG ratings), then G Gundam is one of the last shows anyone should recommend. Cheesy dialogue, average story, shit-tier dub, and minor pacing issues. However, animation quality is fine, and nobody should give it flak for that."

Gundam,34nbr4,UCMCoyote,2,Sun May 3 04:28:58 2015 UTC,"I can totally understand that you enjoyed it as a child, but many people on this subreddit try to pass it off as some great show and basically hate on anyone who thinks otherwise.  From the limited knowledge I have about TV airing of Gundam, I know that most people in the US got introduced to Gundam via Wing and G as children, but for some reason they can't cast that nostalgia lens aside when recommending it to other people, who would probably like to spend their time watching other good shows. Especially for people who wouldn't have that nostalgia factor."

Compared to the Turkish Federation the national resources of Zeon are less than one thirtieth of theirs. Despite this major difference, how is it that we have been able to fight the fight for so long? It is because our goal in this war is a righteous one. It’s been over fifty years since the elite of Turkey, consumed by greed took control of the Turkish Federation. We want our freedom. Never forget the times when the Federation has trampled us! We, the Principality of Zeon, have had a long and arduous struggle to achieve freedom for all citizens of our great nation. Our fight is sacred, our cause divine. My beloved brother, Turkish Zaku, was sacrificed. Why? The war is at a stalemate. Perhaps many of you have become complacent. Such a lack of compassion is ---.   The Turkish Federation has polluted our most cherished planet for their own greed. We must send them a message, but not composed of words. We have wasted too much time with words. We need action now. The Turkishside elite must be taught a strong lesson for their evil corruption. This is only the beginning of our war. We have been putting more and more money into our efforts towards making our military stronger than ever. The Turkish Federation has done the same.   Many of your fathers and brothers have perished valiantly in the face of a contemptible enemy. We must never forget what the Federation has done to our people! My brother, Turkish Zaku, has shown us these virtues through our own valiant sacrifice. By focusing our anger and sorrow, we are finally in a position where victory is within our grasp, and once again, our most cherished nation will flourish. Victory is the greatest tribute we can pay those who sacrifice their lives for us! Rise, our people, Rise! Take your sorrow, and turn it into anger! Zeon thirsts for the strength of its people!

""The reactor core of an S6G (26MWe) submarine nuclear power plant (just the vessel that holds the fuel and the fuel itself) weighs about 110 +/-3 tons. It needs 20000 gallons (80 tons) of water for coolant. After you add in the rest of its systems you are looking at at least 1000 tons of machinery. The reactor fits in a space about 10m long, 10m wide, and 12m tall. Two hundred times more space than the Hyperion Reactor. The S6G is rated at about 130 megawatts thermal power.

But it'd likely be cheaper and easier to just get Steel Battalion and its controller (which, by the looks of it, heavily inspired the Mek-Fu).  But then again, that would involve buying Steel Battalion, and that ain't gun be easy..."
Gundam,34lo6j,draivaden,1 point,Mon May 4 12:29:54 2015 UTC,"Control systems would be easier than the power source. You could program a system to walk the beast and control balance stabilization etc. I assume thats how in universe mecha work considering Kira reprogramed this to work on sand and in gravity of earth.   Using pre-programmed actions takes away some of the feeling that you can make the machine do anything you wanted, but realistically having to think and manipulate every little thing of a mech would be very taxing and incredibly difficult. That said, an ace pilot could probably control extra moves or actions, or program them in advance for situations they have encountered in the past to aid in the future.   Thats just my guess tho."
Gundam,34lo6j,Awesom3xNinja,-1,Sun May 3 20:06:09 2015 UTC,For the controls a playstation controller could do the job. In fact there was a show like that. But yeah I guess it's not feasible irl:(

Don't get me wrong, G was my absolute favorite show as a kid and still my favorite Gundam series, but it was the sheer iconoclasm of the show at the time that made it special. Something Sunrise/Bandai could do again, but at most I'd want to see a spiritual successor to G and not something just stuck in the past. And on that note, I guess I don't really want a super robot Gundam series. Just something that dares to take a risk"

Gundam,34gkq8,Awesom3xNinja,32,Thu Apr 30 23:41:29 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the mono-eye has superior long-range resolution capabilities at the cost of depth perception; in the context of the Zeon's original mobile suit development, this design choice made sense as mobile suits were primarily expected to be engaging Federation warships that provided huge passive sensor returns even at range. Federation fighters had such inferior manuverability compared to Zakus that the mobile suits' pilots could rely on their secondary sensors to guide them, so there was no impetus to upgrade.  The Federation's mobile suits, on the other hand, were built from the ground up to engage other mobile suits. Here depth perception and predictive accuracy became dominant requirements, and in that context the compound sensor design is superior to the mono-eye."
Gundam,34gkq8,Zonetr00per,3,Fri May 1 00:34:43 2015 UTC,"This is actually super interesting. Is there any info on why the Federation adopted mono-eye sensors in the post OYW era, aside from a lot of Anaheim's designers having come from Zeonic and Zinmad (and of course because IRL they wanted the Titans to be the bad guys of Zeta and thus draw aesthetic parallels with Zeon)? I could see Neo Zeon maintaining the mono-eye strictly for aesthetics and tradition if nothing else, but I'm not sure why the Feddies/Titans would implement them in their suits if the compound sensor is superior for inter-mobile suit combat, which is what dominated the battlefield after the OYW."
Gundam,34gkq8,Skyskinner,7,Fri May 1 00:57:41 2015 UTC,"I've thought on this a lot, and the only conclusion I've come up with that makes any sense at all is that the counter-insurgency work the Titans were supposed to be doing (at least on paper) demanded long-range observation of suspected Zeon sympathizers and remnants. The monoeye was found to be better suited to providing this than compound sensors, so they went with it."
Gundam,34gkq8,Zonetr00per,3,Fri May 1 01:16:38 2015 UTC,"After I posted I was thinking along this line as well, and it does make a fair bit of sense. I wonder too if it's possible that the data on which was strictly better for which scenario was still in a state of debate, since Zeta is only 7 years after the OYW. It's also possible that cost or even contracting for the parts for either type of sensor could have come into play. If the two types of sensors were close enough in performance, even if one was marginally better, if the mono-eye was considered ""good enough"" and saved enough in production cost, they may have gone with that, especially in an economy recouping from the cost of a war that killed off so much of the population."
Gundam,34gkq8,Skyskinner,3,Fri May 1 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think cost did play into it, and was the reason why the GMs had visors instead of actual separate eyes like a gundam."
Gundam,34gkq8,Owyn_Merrilin,2,Fri May 1 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of parts in Gundam sidestories and design books that explains this, unfortunately all of them are Japanese and are not translated."
Gundam,34gkq8,Webemperor,1 point,Fri May 1 05:08:46 2015 UTC,"From what I recall, from GM to Penelope, there is no single EF unit with a mono-eye.  Most likely because it's reminiscent of Zeon. If EF shuns Newtype theory, how much more something like Mono-Eye sensors?...  EF Snipers feature a third camera on their forehead (one can draw  similarities to Dynames) that attaches to a specialized camera on their sniper rifle for ""zooming in"". You can see how different this is from Zaku snipers (and even Kirk's own custom) where they do not have such attachment."
Gundam,34gkq8,CidImmacula,2,Fri May 1 05:22:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of the Zeta era suits from the Federation used mono-eyes. A number of these fell under the Titans, but things like the Hi-Zack were absolutely Federation suits"

Gundam,34gkq8,kuroageha,2,Fri May 1 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be something like this! This was the only explanation that would let me accept the monoeyes moving about on a track: the telescope, a cylinder, extends downward below the surface."
Gundam,34gkq8,Hagu_TL,5,Fri May 1 02:54:13 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that first, the monoeye is a compound sensor.  It has all of the main MS sensor functions routed through the single lens.  If we're talking monoeye vs dual eye, I think it's important to realize that the 'eyes' are not the main cameras in this case, as the main camera in EF suits is mounted in the 'mohawk'.   Essentially where the monoeye has all of the sensors clustered together in the 'eye' the EF has them spread out though the face.   In the case of the Gundam's dual eye system, they feed targeting data, giving EF MS generally better firing accuracy.   This is often stated as one reason the Gundam's eyes 'flash' in combat, as they're suggested to be active lasing the targets.  (In fact, the original model of beam spray gun relies entirely on the GM head targeting sensors, which caused some issues when GMs started to get their heads shot off.)  The depiction of what's actually under the GM's visor actually varies and is very inconsistent.   Master Archive GM says that there is a one central camera and a central laser sensors, with multipurpose antennas on either side where the 'eyes' would be expected to be.  Various depictions of the RGM-79G, and other 0080 GMs however, show a very mono-eye like sensor underneath.    In general, sources such as Gundam Officials suggest that the targeting and rangefinding ability of a dual system is much better, as well as separating the various sensors to be more resistant to damage.    In the case of the Gundam's clear 'eyes', it's suggested that this was also intentional design, to keep it as human-like as possible."
Gundam,34gkq8,kuroageha,2,Fri May 1 05:36:46 2015 UTC,"I always enjoyed that idea that the Fed suit pilots rely on better vision and Zeon pilots tend to rely more on feeling to pilot, which is briefly explored in a few series with a few lines here and there.  Like an accidental advantage for pilot training.  For example I can't see for shit out of my Miata, but I somehow drive it with more of an understanding of where I am in the road because I know I can't see shit out of it.  I know I have poor vision, so I rely on hearing and I'm checking my mirrors more often.  I have a better sense now for where cars are around me even though my last car had a much better view.  Something like that."

On one hand, you have a piece of UC0096 technology that had nothing but firepower to it, able to fire a beam similar to a battleship in exchange for all 12 ECap shots  on the other hand, you have a piece of UC0123 technology that had variable power, better energy mileage, and doesn't exactly deplete itself on full power.  Basically you are comparing two things, in the same timeline, where logically speaking the one which ""newer"" would have had better efficiency, enhancements, and technology over the other.  This is different from Gundam Wing's cannon thingy (was it Twin Beam Rifle or sth) vs VSBR/Beam Magnum since those are at least different timelines.  Beam Magnum vs VSBR is from the same timeline, where VSBR comes out much superior to Beam Magnum in efficiency, firepower, and ease of use due to it being born almost 30 years after Beam Magnum.  tl;dr  VSBR would be much better over Beam Magnum."

Gundam,34gd4h,Awesom3xNinja,4,Thu Apr 30 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"Well, beams are generally contained and funneled by an I-Field, so Minovsky particles would have to exist. In that case, concentrated areas of Minovsky Particles block beams.  Beam Sabers are made of Plasma held in an I-field Lattice, similar to Beam Weapons. Therefore, anything below the melting point of Minovsky Particle Plasma is cut quickly. This bypasses nearly all armor that exists today. There are very few instances of beam weaponry having no effect on a suit not coated in Anti Beam Coating, and even that can't protect against a Beam Saber for long.  Outside of UC, for example in SEED, beams rarely interfere with each other. Beam Sabers cannot clash in CE, and the only protection seems to be reinforced shields. There is no equivalent to the Minovsky Particle, and in fact the only reason beams seem so be the main weapon of war is that Nuclear Weapons are unusable (for a while).  What defends against beams (non natural) UC: Dense Minovsky Clouds, I-Fields  CE: Not much  AD: GN Fields  What are Beams' weaknesses?   They consume a lot of power. In early UC, beams were uncommon because most suits lacked the generator power to use them. Built in batteries run out quickly, and heavy beam weaponry requires a lot of charging. It's relatively easy to defend against them. I-Fields are fairly easy to put on a ship, and though likely expensive, beams can only penetrate them at exceedingly close range, as in the case of Amuro destroying Big Zam with his beam sabers/spears. They became the meta. Nearly all suits eventually became equipped with beam weapons by the end of UC. Therefore, armor and shields would become more resistant to them, and ABC abounded."
Gundam,34gd4h,AnimeGeek441,1 point,Fri May 1 01:03:05 2015 UTC,"Er, are there ANY ships depicted with I-Fields? I frankly can't think of any (even though you're right that it would make sense) and ships in general are pretty vulnerable to MParticle weapons throughout UC.  Bear in mind my knowledge of Gundam is pretty good up to F91 but basically stops there, so if it's a later development that would make sense."
Gundam,34gd4h,aMissingGlassEye,2,Fri May 1 10:06:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think any ship had a on-board I-Field on them throughout the UC timeline. However, by the late UCs, ships did have beam shields, as shown in the Reinforces in Victory."
Gundam,34gd4h,Solitak,1 point,Fri May 1 13:03:01 2015 UTC,"Beam Sabers cannot clash in CE   I just opened up ep 48 of Gundam SEED Remastered and beam sabers do clash in CE.  I'd also just add:   Beam weapons are a lot slower than conventional ballistic weapons. The RoF on the Rx-78's beam rifle is more akin to a semi auto rifle of the WW2 era, Gundam being very inspired by WW2 I can't help but feel that Beam weapons were an excuse to go back to slower firing but harder hitting weapons. They give away your position easily. Ballistics are hard to trace without tracer ammunition, whereas beams basically draw a giant line to where you are They are super radiative. I read somewhere that if beam weapons were used in an area, it would take around 10 years for the radiation to wear out and for the area to be livable again. They are too destructive. Beam weapons melt anything pretty darn quick, and that does not give a lot of margin for error. Anything in the crossfire will be melted so trying to actually capture towns may not be suited for beam combat. Just a theory here, but since beam weapons are super heated plasma, I'd imagine the range of them would be quite short, reason being that heat dissipates really quickly. This would actually be a very good feature for beam weapons, as the beam would wear out and not travel indefinitely until it hits some unlucky bastard, as opposed to using ballistic weapons which could float around in orbit until it hits a colony, or in the case of Earth battles, buried and then excavated by mistake."
Gundam,34gd4h,Finishingtothesky,1 point,Fri May 1 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"I just opened up ep 48 of Gundam SEED Remastered and beam sabers do clash in CE.   Could you provide a screencap as proof? Because I rewatched SEED not that long ago, and I can confirm that they do not clash. Any time it looks like Beam Sabers might clash it's either blocked with a shield or dodged. A lot of the time they don't even show the beam saber clashing with a shield, they just cut to the inside of cockpits to show the pilots yelling at each other. As a matter of fact, Beam Sabers in CE do not have the technological ability to clash.  While similar to the Beam Sabers of the UC timeline, the CE timeline Sabers are fundamentally different in that the beam is not formed by an i-field filled with super-heated plasma. In UC, it's the breaking of this i-field that causes the clash when two Beam Sabers meet, as both are essentially trying to rush super-heated plasma into each other.   CE has no i-fields, and although they do have something similar used to contain the gases that form a Mirage Colloid, the technology is not used in their Beam Sabers. Essentially, you can look at CE Beam Sabers like blow torches with long flames, and like flames from two blow torches, they will pass right through each other. This is how & why in SEED Destiny, Athrun is able to cut the Destiny Gundam's Anti-Ship sword in two with the Infinite Justice's Beam Saber; the beams don't interact with each other, so it's just the metal of the blade which has no anti-beam coating and thus, nothing to stop Athrun's Beam."
Gundam,34gd4h,MisterPuck,1 point,Fri May 1 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I was referring to ep 48 of SEED remastered where the Providence and Freedom clash, both with beam sabers out. But you are right, they do not show the beam sabers actually clashing and it could very well be the shields blocking them. They just really make it seem like that as they both draw their sabers just prior to clashing and in addition add a tonne of 'electric' effects during the clash. Not to mention a lot of art, supposedly fan art I guess, shows the sabers clashing.    it's the breaking of this i-field that causes the clash when two Beam Sabers meet, as both are essentially trying to rush super-heated plasma into each other.   This kinda seems a little bit silly, as it's hard to imagine that it would create a resistance for the suits being the plasma is pushing in the direction of the saber and not towards the other saber. Additionally, the plasma wouldn't be solid, if the tip of the saber got disrupted I don't really see why the bottom half would be stopped.  All in all, it's fun discussing this stuff, but it's all fictional giant robot science :P"
Gundam,34gd4h,Finishingtothesky,2,Sat May 2 05:05:28 2015 UTC,"Not to mention a lot of art, supposedly fan art I guess, shows the sabers clashing.   SEED MS's sabers will clash in the video games, so it could be art for that that you're seeing. Of course, the video games are non-canon so it doesn't have any bearing on the anime.    This kinda seems a little bit silly   You take that back. Giant robot laser sword science is very serious and should be treated as such!   Additionally, the plasma wouldn't be solid, if the tip of the saber got disrupted I don't really see why the bottom half would be stopped.   It's not, and I could be wrong about exactly what happens when beam sabers clash in UC, but I know fictional science behind it, which is as I described. It could just be that i-fields don't play nice with each other and naturally push against one another.   And actually, when we do see beam sabers clash in UC, the bottom part doesn't stop which causes the entire blade to bend. Since part of the blade that the saber is maintaining can't pass through though, it's not like a pilot could ""detach"" the top half and slice with the bottom half. Though even if they could it'd be a bad idea since it'd leave them open."
Gundam,34gd4h,MisterPuck,1 point,Sat May 2 08:33:50 2015 UTC,"Since part of the blade that the saber is maintaining can't pass through though, it's not like a pilot could ""detach"" the top half and slice with the bottom half.   Well, how I imagined beam sabers is essentially the same as your blowtorch description, whether it's UC or otherwise. Whereas in UC, I'd imagine a small Ifield containing the plasma to a line as it shoots up towards the tip and fades out as it loses it's heat/energy. If this were the case, it really isn't a case of disconnecting the top from the bottom, but rather the entire thing is just a steam of plasma so it would have no effect on the bottom half.  However, we can also argue that I fields are the cause. It could be the Ifields themselves pushing each other back, like magnets. But I'd also ask, why does a beam saber need an Ifield if it would work similar to a blow torch, and can't they design a shooting function into the saber for emergency situations?   Lastly, with all the talk about Star Wars 7's cross lightsaber, I wonder how lightsabers actually work. Cause, people were focusing on the lightsaber being 'dirty' and rather messy, whereas it didn't even bother me as in Gundam, the beam sabers have been shown to be plasma and would be a lot less like a clean line in the later depictions in UC. Actually, just wiki'd it and it IS plasma...     But yeah, why isn't there a PhD on pewpew sci fi science?"
Gundam,34gd4h,Finishingtothesky,1 point,Sat May 2 10:30:36 2015 UTC,"But I'd also ask, why does a beam saber need an Ifield if it would work similar to a blow torch, and can't they design a shooting function into the saber for emergency situations?   Precisely so that you can block an enemy beam saber with it, as you would instinctually be inclined to. Also, remember that in UC, it's the i-field that gives beam sabers their shape. I would imagine that without it, they wouldn't work. As for the shooting function, I can't recall exactly, but I think there may be MS designs that used the beam sabers as gun barrels as well, but only while attached to the MS. Aside from that, well there are plenty of other guns on the robots, so even if they could add such a function the beam saber, there wouldn't be much point.  Keep in mind that, as much fun as it is to watch two MS go at it with beam sabers, they are a weapon of last resort. Intended for close-range combat only, and only after shooting down an incoming enemy has failed.    Lastly, with all the talk about Star Wars 7's cross lightsaber, I wonder how lightsabers actually work.   I don't remember all of the fictional science behind them, but I do remember that lightsaber blades are formed by focusing energy through crystals. Also, just from observation, you can tell that they're very different from Gundam's beam sabers, as the i-field isn't solid, and will bend as the beam saber is waved around and slashed through things. Light sabers on the other hand are solid, and do not bend or lose their shape as they are waved around and slashed through objects, or even when they clash with other light sabers.   But yeah, why isn't there a PhD on pewpew sci fi science?   You could probably find a website willing to give you one after passing some tests on it, but good luck finding a job with it! XD"
Gundam,34gd4h,MisterPuck,1 point,Sat May 2 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"Well, in real life the real weakness of beam weapons (and, IMO, the reason they wouldn't be all that effective) is that their path can't be controlled (aside from that one weird one).  It shoots out in a straight path just like any other projectile.  Right now, a submarine or a missile silo or whatever can launch a cruise missile from like...forever away.  That missile will hit its target and they can blow up just about anything except for really reinforced stuff (and since some precision guided ordnance can go down ventilation shafts...well...even some reinforced structures go boom).  In Gundam, missiles aren't that effective because of minovsky particles.  They can't target correctly.  That's why line of sight tactics and weapons are really any good in Gundam- especially in space.  Take away minovsky particles (aside from them making beam weaponry possible), and the real need for line of sight stuff like beam weapons mostly goes away.  It would still be nice to have something that goes straight through armor, but with missiles that's usually not a problem anyway.  That said, the Navy does have a laser that shoots stuff down, but its mostly for defensive purposes against missiles and stuff I believe.  So I don't really think the effect of particle weapons in real life would be very pronounced."

I'm not really invested.  Turn A is my absolute favorite Gundam series, so I vote for that.  AGE is... well it's AGE. I hated it, so did most people, but it's... cute... I guess?  ZZ gets a bad reputation for the first twenty-ish episodes. It starts out childish and too comedic for its own good, but it eventually gets good and dark and really redeems itself.

Gundam,34dd6q,Awesom3xNinja,22,Thu Apr 30 06:14:43 2015 UTC,"Overpowered as hell for the time-period in UC where it was used the most. It was practically on a super-robot level.  1.) Double barrel mega-particle grade beam rifle, with an internal generator strong enough to support plenty of shots over an extended battle.   2.) Assorted missile pods in the backpack and twin 60mm vulcans in the head.  3.) Twin Hyper Beam Sabers which have enough power output to cut through multiple mobile suits in a single swing, and have adjustable lengths that can be as long as several mobile suits arm to arm. They also double as shoulder mounted beam cannons, and act as the primary beam cannons in G-Fortress mode.  4.) High Mega Cannon on the forehead which has the strongest output of any hard-mounted mobile suit weapon in the U.C.  5.) Arm-mounted shields with laminate armor capable of withstanding beam-weapon attacks head on. With the extra armor added on top of the Full-Armor ZZ Gundam package, even the beam weapons of later era Neo-Zeon suits like the Doven Wolf just spray off of the ZZ Gundam's armor like water on a wax coating.   6.) Cockpit mounted bio-sensor like the one the Zeta Gundam first sported, allowing the suit itself to tap into the space hippie magic of the pilot and turn it into physical force.   I'm a fan of the real-mecha aspects of the Universal Century, but the ZZ Gundam is a guilty pleasure of mine. It just utterly wrecks the shit of all the prima donas in Neo-Zeon."
Gundam,34dd6q,Gfaqshoohaman,10,Thu Apr 30 06:30:40 2015 UTC,"I do love that despite the ZZ having superior firepower, if a fight called for the Zeta's smaller form and generally higher speed, Judau would use it (or command someone else piloting it to lead the charge) in lieu of the show's titular MS."

Gundam,34dd6q,maxout2142,4,Thu Apr 30 16:19:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, it had a couple of severe problems, which is why the design was never mass-produced:   Power supply: while it's true that it had a much more powerful reactor than normal, the overpowered weapons tended to drain it pretty quickly. In a protracted battle with other, ""weaker"" mobile suits, the ZZ would run out of power first. Especially when the Hi-Mega Cannon was used: that weapon practically gulped down the suit's entire power supply in one shot. Structural weakness: the combination of both a transformation system AND a core block combination system left the suit very vulnerable. If hit in the right place the entire thing would be crippled, despite all the armor it sported. They tried to fix this with the ""Full Amor"" configuration, but that slowed it way down. Expensive as hell. Only one was ever produced, not counting the FAZZ prototypes used to test the heavy weapons systems (which were even more flawed than the ZZ, as they lacked any melee ability, the transformation system, or shoulder-mounted beam cannons)."

Gundam,34dd6q,baconbitarded,3,Thu Apr 30 06:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've always kinda wondered why they kept trying to use the core block system for everything when every time they made a mass-production version they removed it from the design.  Victory gets a pass because they actually use it for spare parts.  But there really weren't spares for the RX-78, Guncannon, etc, so why have the system?

ZZ Gundam also suffers short operation time due to high power consumption of its weapons.  The Hi Mega Cannon pretty much drains all of the power from its generator with one shot. IMO, ZZ is not an effective design overall."

Gundam,34dd6q,Amuro_Ray,3,Thu Apr 30 11:55:40 2015 UTC,I like the ZZ because other than the 00 (no raiser attached) it's the one time I've seen a Gundam that has actual flaws. I know not every prototype has to be a hot mess full of issues but you'd think the average Gundam would have at least one or two flaws since Gundams are all prototypes.
Gundam,34dd6q,NinjaxStyle,9,Thu Apr 30 12:26:40 2015 UTC,The f97 had serious overheating problems. The whole after images was to stop the suit cooking itself.

It's a show that has been around so long that kids who grew up watching, and loving Gundam now have kids who are growing up watching, and loving Gundam, and that shared enthusiasm is such a critical part of what makes Build Fighters work, not only in its character interactions, but in the way the series appeals to its fans as well."
Gundam,34dh4i,sdwoodchuck,3,Thu Apr 30 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"I love this statement:   They know that there are just certain people who take all this waaaaaay too seriously for their own good. You know the types; those bastards who'd want to win at any cost or who'll treat a game like its and actual war or use stupid looking agony helmets on teenage girls with powerful mutant abilities so they'll play a game better. (Okay, that last bit is exclusive GBF's world. At least, I hope it is.) The series looks at those types of fools and tells them, quite pointedly, to get their heads out of their asses. ""It's just game/hobby, dude. You should really just relax."" For that I salute you, GBF.    Believe me, that's all that it takes to appreciate this series. No need to be a very serious war-obsessed and story/plot-critical nerd, just enjoy the good fun that you see in Build Fighters. ALSO in Try."

Gundam,34cjnm,baconbitarded,3,Thu Apr 30 02:21:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I thought sunrise said it's not canon. But I couldn't find an official source. Turns out sunrise has never officially said it's not canon, only unofficial sites have said that sunrise removed it from canon. So when you take that plus the fact that a g savior does show up in build fighters it looks like it's pretty most likely canon now and probably forever."

But the events of ZZ and Kamille's fate at the end of Zeta were what fueled Char in CCA. Not to mention, Axis retreats from the Earth Sphere, so the Federation can't sell it to Char. So CCA is out. Since CCA and ZZ are referenced by Unicorn, Unicorn can't be canon in that timeline either.  Yeah, I know. Alternate timelines and ""what ifs."" I really wish that Sunrise would do something with this alternate timeline though."
Gundam,34cjnm,CrashmanX,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:41:08 2015 UTC,"It's not technically impossible to reconcile CCA with the New Translation ending.

Likewise, Dellensen recognizes the way the G-Self dodges to be like the way Bellri dodged him in the same instance. That's why there's that brief flashback at the end of the episode.     Mask immediately knows when the MS is autopiloted      The Montero is flying in straight lines and not even trying to dodge. Considering Mask has fought Klim multiple times, I think he can recognize when its not him piloting."
Gundam,34cksl,Char_X_3,2,Thu Apr 30 01:53:34 2015 UTC,Thanks! It just seemed like as soon as the cockpits were close to each other they would somehow know who the other pilot was and it happened several times. EDIT: If you don't mind me asking... 1. What's the difference between the Capital Guard and Army? 2. Why are the Amerian(?) pirates so happy to let their prisoners roam free and talk about stealing ships and trying to negotiate their way into ranked positions? 3. The Megafauna is pretty small and only has limited defenses. How come the strike forces that come to recapture Bellri and the G-self are so small (and thus get routed so quickly)? Is there some sort of pact in place where skirmishes are allowed but full battles are interpreted as acts of war?
Gundam,34cksl,Char_X_3,2,Thu Apr 30 02:09:07 2015 UTC,What's the difference between the Capital Guard and Army?    Capital Guard are tasked with guarding and upkeeping the tower. The Army is an actual army.    Why are the Amerian(?) pirates so happy to let their prisoners roam free and talk about stealing ships and trying to negotiate their way into ranked positions?     1000 years of peace means everyone forgot how war actually works. That and they wanted to test stuff with the G-Self and Bell was the best person they had to pilot it.

Gundam,34cksl,Hagu_TL,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"It takes a bit of backreading on interviews to understand how they forgot ""to war'.  G-Rekt is set in Reguild Century 10...10? Or something. Reguild Century itself is set after Universal Century, so there has been at least 1000 years after the end of UC, and possibly even way more for the last large-scale war. (If we assume Victory or G-Saviour as the ""end"", there's probably still an extra 50+ years before agreements are made and RC is ushered in)  Agreements like the Ag-Tech taboo or all those other stuff I can't remember prevented development in favor of war. Similarly, remember the ""kuntala"" they are talking about? These are humans are bred to be food. Yes, cannibalism, food. Humanity, by the end of UC, seems to have really had it bad to need other humans as food. There's no time for war anymore. This should be explained near the end, but it was also mentioned in the interview (which was released and translated around G-Rekt ep 2 or earlier)."
Gundam,34cksl,Solitak,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"...that is horribly inefficient. To cannibalize humans, they still need to be fed long enough to make good meat. You could just eat that food yourself and receive more of the energy from the food. Plus you need to keep the people somewhere, and so much of the matter they ingest will just become useless inedible bone."
Gundam,34cksl,Finishingtothesky,3,Thu Apr 30 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"I think people mix it up. Its more likely that they were the lower class of people that were eaten when food got scarce. Not that they were grown specifically as food.    The original translation of the interview states   -The Cuntara are the people who became food when mankind turned to cannibalism at the brink of extinction. They represent the problem of racism, the horrors of the collapse of society, and the depths of human sin     Source    I can sorta understand where people got the whole ""farmed food"" mentality, but the translation sounds more like they just got the short end of the stick and were eaten when times got tough."

Gundam,34cksl,ExpiredSushi,1 point,Fri May 1 13:18:21 2015 UTC,"It takes a bit of backreading on interviews to understand how they forgot ""to war'.   It still would never make sense that they allowed prisoners to run amok and even pilot their most powerful suits. Forget war, surely trust is an issue in everyday life. I mean, it's not like they'd allow a thief to walk into their treasury right? Similarly, a prisoner would be someone with a known agenda and reason to go against you, so you won't let them run free. Most obvious to me is Manny. She's saved by Bellri and co, which would be natural as they're classmates and she'd die without their help, but then she's allowed to steal/pilot the biggest matherfraker of a suit without much of a hassle getting out and if i recall actually casually says ""hey i'm going to meet my BF who probably wants to kill you, but i'ma convince him, anyway bringing this huge ass suit with me"". Now that might not be accurate, I need to rewatch G-Reco again, but that's definitely the way it came across at the time.  I totally love the concept behind G-Reco, tech has become so advanced that no one knows how the hell it actually works, they just use it. It's kind of already happening in our day and age. But damn they fucked the execution up. You can say that human culture as a whole has changed drastically after 1000 or 1 million years, but the behaviours shown in G-Reco don't even seem human."

The base unit you chose is pretty far from Brachydios' round bulk. EVA suits, being more on the thin and long side, ends up looking closer to AE/EF Suits, to which Hyaku Shiki follows (Mega Shiki bases off Hyaku).  I wonder if it would be better when colored in ""rage"" colorations, or the actual ""Raging"" variation...  perhaps a bit less Green on the legs too as Brachydios doesn't really have much slime down there.   shrugs Looks Brachy enough to me, I really can't think of other modifications to make it ""Brachier"" to others outside of fully customizing the unit (bigger arms, a ""rounder"" backpack, a ""tail"" fin etc)"

The Hizack is a better Zaku, but I still can't get over the fact that it could not use a beam saber with a beam rifle (I got it from that Gundam wiki, I could be wrong). The first mass produced GM could use beam weaponry better than this. But in my opinion, it is a Zaku no matter how different the name is, if it looks like a Zaku then it is a Zaku, no exceptions."

Trieze on the other hand would have had to secure a supply line elsewhere. I don't know if it's explicitly said anywhere, but he probably secured a supply of Gundanium through Lady Une's diplomatic envoys to the colonies.

The Sinanju is 0.129 kW/kg and Wing Zero is 0.4665 kW/kg     The F91 gundam is a good match. It's power to weight ratio is 0.540 kW/kg and its thrust to weight ratio is 12.27 kg thrust/kg weight, which is more than Wing Zero's 11.019     It looks like the power to weight ratios for the 00 Gundams will be more complicated....like I'm going to have to teach myself some maths to figure it out.

Gundam,345oal,chrysamere,2,Wed Apr 29 02:39:41 2015 UTC,"This was me 3 months ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/2r6hml/im_one_of_those_guys_that_has_only_seen_gundam/  Many of us started like you: Wing broke our Gundam cherry. The nostalgia is real. I just finished building my MG Epyon and MG Tallgeese III.  That being said, you cannot say that Wing is the best Gundam series ever without watching them all. You just sound like a dipshit kid when you make ignorant claims with such certainty. Wing has many faults. Heero is boring. Relena is obnoxious. Zechs is Char without enough time to develop his motives. Wu Fei is more obnoxious than Relena, if you can imagine. Duo gets on my nerves. Quatre and Trowa are OK, I guess. The animation is inconsistent. The story is hard to believe.  OK, now that i've finished ranting about Wing, you should watch Universal Century. It will really give you some perspective, it will teach you where EVERYTHING in Wing came from. You thought it was cool when Zechs cuts Barge in half with Epyon? That happened Zeta Gundam. You thought Zechs's motivations for dropping Libra on Earth was a bit of a stretch? That's because he was literally just a copy of Char Aznable. Wing is the Universal Century plot crammed into 49 episodes without enough time for it to really make sense.  This is the order that I watched the series:  Wing->00->Seed->MSG Movies->Zeta->Char's Counterattack->Unicorn  I strongly suggest you go a similar route that I did. First watch Gundam Origins: Blue Eyed Casval. Watch the MSG Movies. If you really like the series, you can go back and watch the full 40something episode anime later. Watch the whole Zeta gundam series. Watch the first, second, and last episode of ZZ Gundam to get Zeta closure and read cliffnotes of the plot. Make sure you learn about the Ple clones. Then watch Char's Counterattack. After that you can watch Unicorn. Beyond that, the world of Gundam is open to you. Go back and watch 0083 Stardust Memory for Top Gundam. Trudge through the first half of ZZ to enjoy the great second half. But to really ""get"" why Wing isn't the best, you need to experience Amuro, Kamille, and Char's story."

Idk about everyone else, but when I finished Gundam Unicorn, I felt so complete and satisfied with life that I didn't wanna do anything for the next few days. I also recommend watching 0080: War in the Pocket after MSG 0079. On top of the UC series, I recommend F91, Victory Gundam, Gundam X, and Turn A. Honestly, Wing, Seed, and Seed Destiny are horrible once you watch an actually good Gundam series."

Gundam,342ae4,chrysamere,14,Mon Apr 27 19:14:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree, to start with, Zech's plan was only undone by several coincidences that had they played out even slightly different would have led to Libra crashing to Earth for sure.  -Noin's remark about the grave could just as easily imply that Zech's expects to lose, rather then plans to.  -Disarming him doesn't mean he would automatically win the fight, Heero had the exact same position a moment later and didn't win the fight.  -Bringing the fight into Libra makes sense from a tactical perspective, without the Buster Rifle, Heero had no way to stop Libra, and with Epyon designed solely for close quarters combat trapping Wing Zero within the block plays to his advantage  -Knowing Zero's capabilities, and being able to know exactly when it would run out of energy/bullets in the midst of a battle is a reach at best.  -Zechs aiding Heero at the end doesn't mean that he planned to lose the entire time, but rather that he accepted Heero/Relena's way of thinking.  So yeah, I think that this theory requires a lot of stretching to make it work, and I just don't think its accurate"
Gundam,342ae4,LordRevann,0,Mon Apr 27 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"I agree about Noin. It could really go either way. About the disarming.. come on. Watch the fight. Zechs had him.  Without the Buster Rifle, destroying the power system was the way to stop Libra.  I don't agree that it was a good tactical decision. Epyon was every bit as fast as Wing Zero, if not faster. It was just as capable of fighting in open space. Wing Zero's twin gatling guns cause Epyon major grief in those close quarters. I don't think it's a reach. This is Zechs we're talking about. I can agree that maybe my theory of Zechs planning the whole thing may be wrong, but my MAIN argument is that Zechs lets Heero win the fight at the very end. It could very well be that the colony announcement changed his mind, which he then immediately responds by leading them inside Libra. What I really want to know is: when he ""settles"" it at the end, does he let Heero win? Do we really believe that Heero in Wing Zero truly bested Zechs in Epyon in a sword clash?"
Gundam,342ae4,LordRevann,2,Mon Apr 27 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"-Re: Disarming, Like I said, Heero had him in the same position immediately after the explosion and the fight didn't end.  -The inside of each block is enormous, luring Zero into an area where the combat would have to be close range doesn't directly impact his plans.  -It is a reach, the cannons fire hundred of rounds a minute, there's no way for him to know that they were out of bullets, and Zero has never had a power issue in the past, feels more like the suit ran out of plot power rather then Zechs anticipating the energy running out.  -Yes, I do believe Heero would win a fight, I've always felt he was the superior pilot, and nothing happens during the course of the show to make me think otherwise, he has the upper hand in the battle with the Tallgeese Rd 1, is injured and using an unfamiliar suit in Rd 2, the Sanc Kingdom fight is a draw, and he wins in space.  So I don't think there was any intention on Zech's part to throw the fight, evidenced by his destiny line and his intention to drop Libra."
Gundam,342ae4,forte7,-2,Mon Apr 27 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"The fight not ending at Heero disarming Zechs is easily explained because we already know that Heero doesn't intend to kill Zechs. Relena would be sad, after all. The question is whether Zechs intended to kill Heero.  The ""round one"" fight was Zechs, still getting used to Tallgeese, was fighting the superior Wing Gundam. Do you remember that fight at all? Zechs actually had the advantage there. Round Two, Heero was injured. Zechs had the advanrtage. Round 3, draw. The series never shows any evidence that Zechs is an inferior pilot."
Gundam,342ae4,forte7,4,Mon Apr 27 20:00:23 2015 UTC,"Except for Zechs himself commenting that round 1 that Heero beat him in every conceivable way pilot speed, reflexes, timing, endurance, and tactical ability. The only thing that saved him was Talgeese's superior speed. Round 2 was Heero for the mere fact that Zechs had mastered the Talgeese, Heero never used Heavy arms and it used a different combat style than Wing, and Heero still  held his own. Round 3 was a draw because the Zero/Epyon system was driving both of them nutso, and I'd call the space fight a draw. All the things Heero is good at are nullified with the system. The one who chooses the correct future is the one that wins the fight and they both basically admit they failed to choose the correct future because they both choose to fight."
Gundam,342ae4,_Raidan_,0,Mon Apr 27 22:01:46 2015 UTC,When does Zechs admit that?
Gundam,342ae4,ClamDad,3,Mon Apr 27 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"When his guy analyzes all of Heero's actions in their first battle. He remembers that Heero is a kid and that is why he takes it so personally. He can't understand how a kid can be that much better than him, because to be fair the Tallgeese is soooooo much better than Wing in a duel, Wing is more of an artillery MS, yet Heero still won."
Gundam,342ae4,Brenticus302,3,Mon Apr 27 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat pointless but here's my interpretation:   Noin says that cause I believe zechs wants to drop Libra and plans to die to pay for the sin of killing most of humanity. So no. I think it's more due to skill here and planning. Zechs knew Heero would be the one to stop him and epyon's only range is melee, hence removing heero's twin buster rifle and fighting inside Libra removes some of Wing Zero's advantage. This only helps Heero lose, not win. yes exactly that. Heero took advantage due to something UNRELATED. How does zech plan that to let heero win? So instead of letting Heero win after his ideals were proven wrong, he decides to say it's his destiny and attempt to win? weird.... I don't think so, Wing Zero at that point in time didn't have TBR. Counting how much ammo Wing Zero had is absurd but not impossible due to zero system. I think Wing Zero had enough power with TBR but since it didn't have it in possession, all it had was the physical MS itself and the beam saber which wasn't enough to destroy the thing. So I don't think it was chosen in that moment to fight but more about the ""deciding moment"". What I mean is Libra is getting really close to earth and is almost impossible to stop, Zechs probably thought if there was a last time to back out, it would be now and planned to clash with heero for a winner take all rather than delay and have both die in Libra's crash.  Both systems show possible outcomes that I believe slowly get reduced until theirs only 1 outcome left. After everything that has happened in the fight and possibly with how much Libra could do to damage earth, both machines probably foretold that Earth would get fu*ked up. So yes, Zechs most likely saw this outcome and could have possibly ""decided"" to lose in that moment. But to say he planned this for awhile ago is definitely not true. I don't know how this is really relevant. Heero states his objective, which whenever he says he'll kill someone specifically, he never ends up killing them. Nothing to do with zechs planning to lose. That's true, but how you're thinking now is contradictory to how you were in previous points. You were factoring in little minute things and now talk about removing them and having a pure 1 v 1. This is the problem, most anime's never deal with a situation where both characters want to clash cause they can, they all have motives cause its natural like real people in real life. Zechs would never fight ruthlessly unless its an enemy he dislikes, which in heero's case wouldn't happen. He upholds honor such as letting the gundam pilots go when Heero self destructed. He also doesn't hold a grudge against heero, he saved Heero in that moment cause deep down he knew his actions weren't the best. It was more like an immediate threat to get humanity both in space and earth to consider the problems of conflict between the two, not an answer.  I think the biggest thing is, thinking of the situation of Zechs in a more humane way, Zechs didn't like the situation and drastically decided to change it with an immediate threat to one side (Earth by dropping Libra) but deep down, didn't think it was the correct response. He probably got Epyon to show results of his actions and wanted to set the stage to fight Wing Zero to decide the outcome. At the end when he decides to ""settle"" the fight, he could have chose to lose here as he asks heero why he wasn't finished off though this could be debated. He goes on to sacrifice himself though after seeing how he was spared even though he tried to endanger humanity and also with Heero willing to sacrifice himself for Humanity. Zechs noticed just how ugly deep down he was for what he planned to do and tries to make up for it. In the end, Zechs only ever thought about Heero in his plans to fight him for the outcome of the earth rather than a whole plan to delay Wing Zero and to lose to Heero.   Your theory is pretty solid. Remember he is from a pacifist country so it's no wonder he didn't really plan to destroy earth. He probably wanted the threat to make humanity both in space and earth realize what has the war become and the immediate consequences. The Relena one was obvious though, it has consistently been shown throughout the series everyone wants her to rule and all plans ends with Relena rebuilding and becoming pretty much a queen.  TL;DR Zechs is good natured, hence why alot of people like him. He does not purposely plan to lose but most likely wanted the Libra crash to be avoided. Him losing to Heero could have potentially been ""decided"" in the end in that moment of the final clash but not from the beginning."

They look like machines and have a sense of mass that adds to the 'real robot' feel for me, where the sleeker ones like 00, AGE, or even some of the Zeta line feel like small super robot suits."
Gundam,3421bt,DyneJM,5,Mon Apr 27 18:38:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I would call the Unicorn a thinner mobile suit, it's obviously not ZZ or Xi big, but I always got the impression that it had a bit of bulk to it."
Gundam,3421bt,LordRevann,6,Mon Apr 27 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"Well I mean thinner compared to the bulkier ones or something like the Dom. Maybe it would be better to say it's about proportion rather than bulk? The main idea is that it doesn't seem over encumbered while still having enough thickness to seem weighty. A gundam like the Exia seems fast but relatively weak, as if something could snap its arm. On the opposite end the ZZ seems unflinching but also looks like it couldn't cross its arms. I like both but prefer a balance."
Gundam,3421bt,DyneJM,5,Mon Apr 27 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that proportion rather then bulk is the way to go, the Unicorn is definitely a bulkier suit compared to what a majority of the Federation/Londo Bell suits of the time.  As for proportions, I think it all comes down to how its designed. The Sinanju is a very bulking suit proportionally, but I think it's in all the right places, versus a suit like the ZZ, which just seems large for the sake of it.  I really like the Exia design, and its ""thinness"" is by design, as the suit was intended to be as flexible as possible to facilitate its intended combat role."
Gundam,3421bt,LordRevann,2,Mon Apr 27 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Sinanju is one of my absolute favorite designs. I think the Zaku line has a lot of suits that have a good balance, giving a sense of mass without seeming overly bulky. As for the Exia it was just the first thin Gundam I could think of, I actually mentioned GMs first but deleted it to use a Gundam example."
Gundam,3421bt,DyneJM,3,Mon Apr 27 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"I like suits that make sense, regardless of their design. the blocky federation mobile suits are classic and sturdy,on the other hand 00 and the strike suits are sleek and thin but meant to be fast and flexible. it feels like comparing a p-51 to a f-35 they're both cool, but for different reasons imo.  i feel like the further you get from the original stories the dumber the designs, like the the ones so bulkly to the point where they couldnt walk or the ones so pointy they'd trip over all their swords/spikes."

Gundam,3421bt,gdank,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"As long as it doesn't go overboard, I'm pretty OK with anything. The thing with UC Gundam is that every design has a history. From the simpler designs (RX-78-2, Zaku II), they became much complex (The Zeta suits), and then bulkier (ZZ, CCA, Unicorn), and then really big (Hathaway's Flash), before becoming small (F91 and beyond).   They are also reflective of the kinds of conflict that the suits were rolled out into, the original suits were made with mass production and efficiency in mind, while the CCA era suits had considerably more armor or specific battle roles. The Xi and the Penelope were really huge, but the technology was refined, and miniaturization caused MS sizes to decrease in F91 until Victory which featured smaller, but more efficient suits.  As for non-UC units, it really depends. Designs in 00, for example, will fit right in G-Reco territory (which was after UC) because there is an emphasis on faster and more mobile units rather than armor while SEED units can fit right into Victory era suits - they being much smaller than UC ones."

(still plenty of action though)  F91 that's .....ugh it hurts me because gundam f91 is a movie that had,be made out of the first few episodes that was designed to be a 50 episode series and if it had been finished I think it would have been fucking awsome but it's got action some political stiff going on and a smaller amount of tragedy so I think ypu might find it just ok but I enjoyed it.  none of these shows have ""the unbeatable robot"" syndrome you speak of except for possibly rhe final battle but then,again this is UC and that is usually what happens in final battles in UC in,some shape or form   But the,short answer to ypur,question is I'd say yes watch all 3"
Gundam,341m3d,Gundam336,2,Mon Apr 27 18:47:35 2015 UTC,ZZ is a hotly debated topic. Some people will tell you it's trash. Some people will say there is a long way to go before it gets good. I've always recommend it. The key things to keep in mind are A) if you watch it right after zeta there will be a drastic mood and tone change. Some people find it hard to swallow. B) it does get better the deeper it goes.     F91 is a hard watch the first time around. It begins really well but it kind of disintegrates over time. This is due to the fact it was planned originally on being a 50ish episode series but it had to be condensed into a two hour movie. It feels like a two hour promotion for what could have been a great series. I say watch it but know there are a lot of time jumps that they don't explain and expect you to understand time has passed without telling you.     I haven't seen victory yet. But I plan on it eventually. Mostly because I like the kill 'em all aspect it's famous for. I find the art style to be jarring and not the best (budget concerns lead to no shading) and Tomino himself hates it for many reasons (more due to how he was treated by sunrise during it's production than anything). Others can give you a better idea but I think it's worth it.     The other series have their fans. But a lot of them are closer to the gundams are unbeatable superweapons flavor. Personally I love After War Gundam X even if it was cut short. I think 00 is really good too. But it's up to you. There are people that love and hate pretty much everything  here so you'll find a lot of opinions but you'll have to watch them to see what you think yourself.
Gundam,341m3d,iceman_in_black,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. Victory sounds interesting and yeah I heard about the short production of F91. If Zeta is super heavy as people say the lighter mood in ZZ might be welcomed. How is Reconguista in G? I've read it's better to focus on the characters then the politics, How's the story over all?"
Gundam,341m3d,LordRevann,2,Mon Apr 27 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"I get the sense that I'm in the minority when I say this, but I hated G-Reco, the characters are ""meh"" but what really irks me is that nobody seems to have a real reason for what they do, and allegiances seem to shift and get discarded for no real reason, and then there doesn't seem to be any consequence for those decisions.  It's as if they wanted a lighter tone, but still wanted to tackle a serious theme, and how it came off to me was the characters not taking things seriously that the show itself was trying to take seriously."
Gundam,341m3d,Char_X_3,2,Mon Apr 27 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"G-Reco has a vibrant art style and a great OST. Mecha designs get better as the show goes on.  The plot... I'm going to be frank. You're going to have to piece it together yourself from the dialogue. The show never sits you down and goes spells it out directly. Hell, important lines are never called attention to and are easy to miss. The series benefits from a rewatch armed with knowledge from later in the show.   Also the show alludes to various issues Japan is currently facing, which can throw off those without knowledge. The thing Tomino was trying to do with this anime is to get children to start thinking about the world around them. You're kinda left to decide what is right and wrong in the end and ss a result, the ending can be somewhat lacking.  The characters are likable but I never felt much of an emotional connection to any of them. Only Manny and Mask during the final battle really. There is an underlying logic to each characters actions, rooted in the culture of where they were brought up in. However these cultures are somewhat detached from our own due to being set over a thousand years into the UC's future, so the characters come across as somewhat alien as a result. For example: humanity has forgotten what war is like, so they tend to treat it like a game.  It's an interesting piece and the general reaction seems to be love it or hate it. I personally love this series. It was something different and refreshing. But that said, it's not like your traditional anime so watch at your own discretion.  Edit: You might want to wait until the someone makes subs from the Blurays. Think Tomino is putting some extra scenes on them, which would definitely help the show."
Gundam,341m3d,iceman_in_black,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"I went from watching the last episode of zeta to watching the first episode of zz within minutes. The tone change was very much a welcomed thing to me but I'm in the minority.      I haven't watched reconguista in g yet. Since it's kind of in the u.c. timeline (theoretically it's the bridge between the u.c. And turn a's correct century) and i haven't seen victory yet so I've put it off. And I've put off victory because, well, life happens. But I can say that what I've seen of the art, it looks really good. And the community hotly debates the show's merits but from what I can tell the community seems to think more negatively than positively. It's interesting because I remember in the old days (for me anyway, back in the early 2000s when it was harder to find copies of shows not released in the u.s.) the community had a very similar view of turn a. Now the community holds it in high regard. I don't know if more people saw it over time and more liked it or if the community's view just softened overall. I'm extremely interested to see what the opinion of reconguista will be a few years down the line."
Gundam,341m3d,sdwoodchuck,2,Mon Apr 27 21:38:05 2015 UTC,"Are ZZ, Victory, and F91 worth watching at all?   Yes, absolutely.  They aren't always great, but each has qualities redeeming enough to make them worth the time.    ZZ:  As others have said, it's a rough start.  It is a pretty darn good series after that initial slump though.    F91:  In terms of storytelling, it's pretty bad.  The plot is rushed, there are too many characters for its short run time, and it just kind of moves from one plot point to the next awkwardly.  But it is gorgeous.  The animation is older-style but at an extremely high quality, and it is beautiful--possibly my favorite, aesthetically, of all of Gundam.  I also love that late UC style though.    Victory:  It's pretty grim.  If you like grim, you'll love it.  If you don't like grim, you'll probably be exhausted by the end of it.  It also has kind of a rough start (Sunrise insisted that Tomino couldn't keep the Gundam off-screen until episode 3, so last-minute editing had to be done), and the animation is somewhat lackluster (surprising, considering how good Zeta looked years earlier), but it's good overall.  Definitely among my top 5 Gundam series, but like I mentioned, I love that late UC stuff."
Gundam,341m3d,iceman_in_black,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:10:36 2015 UTC,I want to love F91. I really do. In fact the F91 has become one of my favorite gundams. The movie looked great. Which is why its so sad Sunrise wouldn't give Victory the appropriate funding for the art (seriously the lack of shading drives me insane). I hate to say it takes away from the overall experience but that fact does make it harder to start.
Gundam,341m3d,sooperjoe,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"ZZ is worth a watch. The first 20ish episodes are pretty terrible, but everything after that is great. Some of my favorite moments from gundam. Just know that it is drastically tonally different from zeta, so maybe dont watch it immediately after zeta.  F91 is pretty highly rated here on reddit i think, but I've never seen it myself.   Can't really say anything about victory."
Gundam,341m3d,LordRevann,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"Victory is pretty rough, both as a show and just as a viewing experience.  I don't regret having watched it, but I don't know that I would recommend it either, if that makes sense.  *Edit, you know what, Victory really isn't worth your time, we would have all been better off had F91 gotten the full order and Victory being made into a movie.  The characters in the show are all annoying, and its murder-y just for the sake of shock value, and not to further or better the story."

A lot of people here defend this series, in my opinion because Tomino created this, but Tomino himself rated it 15/100. Focusing on the characters doesn't help due to the way they act, the story happens in a order that one can follow with effort (I guess it comes easy to others) but merely lacks. By all means what UC because it helps some, but honestly this series disappointed me a ton."

So they basically had to compress whatever story he wanted into 50% size, making Reco even faster than it's planned to be.  I guess Sunrise had so much success with those idols that they decided Reco wasn't worth it?  Unicorn also was...5-6 years worth of production, with almost a year or so between ""episodes"", making it really polished.  I hear it was supposed to end by 5, but unlike G-Reco's case, they extended it to 6, then 7, when they couldn't fit the awesomeness in just 5 OVAs.

Look at all the Marvel super hero movies in the last decade or so.  I remember reading X-Men comics as a kid.  Watching the Fox animated series on saturdays.  That was a show/franchise that was marketed towards kids explicitly.  Sure adults can enjoy it but it was saturday morning cartoons.  But as an adult, I feel Marvel took the franchise and produced movies to satisfy all those kids who grew up.  While I don't particularly enjoy ALL of the X-men films, I never had the feeling I was watching a kids movie.  I would think that Bandai could take the Gundam franchise now, and appeal to those kids who grew up watching it in the 80s and 90s by making films based on the Gundam Universe.  Maybe its not as lucrative in the states but I would imagine Japanese kids who grew up watching it would enjoy it as adults."

Most of them provide lower-resolution (and thus shorter effective range) data but over a wider area; the mono-eye's package is many times more powerful, but focuses on one area at a time.  A good example of this: During the opening of the fight between Norris and the 08th MS team, his Gouf's monoeye sweeps back and forth. Rather than his cockpit view actually moving, though, we see it visibly updating the available data in an area as the monoeye passes over it."

Gundam,33z1q3,Craiser,3,Mon Apr 27 01:12:20 2015 UTC,"More or less, yes.  The secondary sensors point in all directions and provide a constant feed to the pilot - they're what provide the video, among other things, to the cockpit. They can be said to be constantly updating in theory. The monoeye gives vastly superior data, but only in a given narrow arc; anything out of that arc is 'out of date' for that quality data until the monoeye looks at it again, although the secondary sensors pointing in those directions will still update continuously."

It all came down to tricking that visual camera that you were or were not a mobile suit or ship.  This is why camouflage and dummy balloons were both very effective in the war, also why odd things like the GM Camouf were both tried and failed horribly."
Gundam,33z1q3,Braddigan,2,Mon Apr 27 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"GM Camouf (from Gundam wikia):       Even before the GM Camouf (Camouf being an abbreviation of ""camouflage"") was produced, Zeon had used captured GMs known as the Gefangener GM for false flag tactics and operations. As a result, Zeon's produced imitations of the GM bear the name Camouf. In any case, both the Gefangener GM and GM Camouf were not issued a model numbers due to the criminal nature of false flag tactics. To that end, Zeon denied the use of either mobile suit during the One Year War. When used in an area with high minovsky particle interference, the Federation MS targeting computers would ""fill in the blanks"" and IFF-tag the Camouf as a friendly unit. However, as a mobile suit employed for false flag tactics, the pilot not only had to watch out for friendly fire, but also had to be concerned with being discovered by the enemy. Camouf pilots learned these two points the hard way during its only deployment, where the entire squadron was destroyed by its own Musai transport. Ultimately, it was given a poor evaluation, and was assigned to the Earth Volunteer Corps (Earthnoids or Federation Colonists that defected to Zeon).

Gundam,33z1q3,autowikiabot,2,Mon Apr 27 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"According to Bandai's magnum opus Gundam Officials:  The monoeye is made of three main parts: The frame, optical sensor equipment (supplied by Canom instruments - no that's not a typo.) and sensor equipment.  (Including laser and infrared sensors)  It serves as the main camera and composite data from this camera and sub cameras (21 sub cameras on the MS-14jg, for example) to provide a composite exterior picture of the MS.  It is also noted that due to not having true atmospheric conditions to test and refine the sensor equipment in, leading to image and sensor issues once on Earth, requiring new high speed lenses and polarizing filters to correct the issues they encountered.  Part of the reasons were the relatively short engagement and detections range of Earth, which lead to the extreme high resolution of the monoeye being overly redundant.  The sensor units not only can detect EM waves, but also can function in passive mode as laser recievers, or as laser communication devices.    The reason that they glow red is supposedly due to the infrared sensor equipment inside.    When the eye is 'glowing' it is often seen as intimidating  (and has been purposely used by pilots as such)  it is actually the sensor systems being reset to capture data on a specific target."

I'm just saying the 360 cockpit throws more questions in the mix. like is the mono-eye the main camera that forms the majority of the front facing arc? In which case it shouldn't move. Or is it relegated to other tasks like doing picture-in-picture zooms on certain areas of the field? It's hard to say, and at the end of the day we just don't know.

Gundam,33xgis,Otacon_,2,Sun Apr 26 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"Given that GN particles function similarly to Minovsky particles and disable radar, it wouldn't be too far fetched that Haro won't be able to pilot the 0 Raiser in radar jamming situations.  Beyond the 4th wall though? I think they lampooned Saji into CB to keep the civvie views in S2."
Gundam,33xgis,Finishingtothesky,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then how do the Haros in Dynames and its later incarnations work?"
Gundam,33xgis,JealotGaming,2,Mon Apr 27 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"Well, again I'm just theorizing, but if we think about AI in current technology, AI can perform pre-designed tasks quite well, but in general are quite bad at facing unknown issues. So in the case of Dynames and other GN suits utilizing Haro, the Haros only performed a single task to aid the pilot.  For example, in the Dynames, Haro often did the 'maneuvers' while Lockon used a manually aimed sensor to snipe enemies. The key word being maneuver. Haro simply dodged/blocked incoming shots and as far as I remember, did not pilot the Dynames for a prolonged period while in combat. Similarly, other suits have employed the Haros for assisted aiming, as in the case with Zabanya.  To further the topic, I'll say that it's entirely possible for the Haros to pilot a suit in combat to a certain extent. They just might not be able to deal with the number of scenarios in combat that well. In the case of working in tandem with a human/Innovade pilot, the pilot is handling the decision making. So if Haro runs into an unpredicted situation, the pilot can simply take over or issue an order. So, considering that the 0 Raiser is a crucial asset to CB and the 00 Gundam, it would make sense that a pilot be seated in the Raiser to ensure it's survival and ability to dock with the 00 Gundam in combat situations.   Looking at loop holes, well for one, I can't imagine Saji doing a lot in the 0 Raiser or even improving the survival rate of it. As an engineer he probably assisted in management of the systems but generally I'd refer to him just serving as a civvie view in 00. And if we take it that Haro would be able to completely fly and shoot effectively, there's no need for Meisters to exist.    Something I just thought of at the end: If we take radar to be completely out with GN particles dispersed, the AI would have to judge position and states of enemies using only the visual input received by the camera. I'd just imagine this being extremely processor heavy, inaccurate and slow to process since there are so many factors at play with just visual information. A human would be able to read them as they've been processing that information for the entirety of their lives but something as small as a Haro might have difficulties. In addition, it's a general idea that an MS has cameras installed in various points of the body, but the more powerful camera is installed in the head that is able to properly calculate the distances and positions of objects. So for the AI to properly target or even juggle enemy priorities, they'd have to make use of the main sensor, whereas a human/Innovade pilot could still assess images taken in by the secondary sensors."

Gundam,33wtmq,Golden_Aura,3,Sun Apr 26 11:31:55 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that if its normal mobile suits that are water capable they are already in their suits when deployed underwater.   There is a scene in Unicorn (i believe, maybe wing cant remember TBH) where a submarine is under attack by the Shamblo (once again I believe this to be the case) and their are mobile suits on the sub in an air locked room that is filling with water pre-deployment, but it isnt soon enough and the sub is sank in seconds, long before the suits can deploy.   I imagine that no one really opens their cockpit underwater, at least, I have never seen anything that leads to that assumption at least."
Gundam,33wtmq,TheonsDickInABox,2,Sun Apr 26 12:09:42 2015 UTC,Then how do they access their mobile suits if it is under water?  I have seen it many times in nearly all of the series.

Gundam,33wtmq,TheonsDickInABox,3,Sun Apr 26 16:13:03 2015 UTC,Now that you mention it I do remember a scene from wing where Nataku is completely underwater with what appears to be no extra equipment there to assist in such a feat. Seems without some specialized gear the cockpit would get flooded.   I cant remember off the top of my head if I have seen similar things in the UC universe. I dont think I have. At least nothing that stands out.

The broad strokes are that psychoframe research is abandoned due to fear of how powerful it is.  The Unicorn is sealed on the Megalanica and the Banshee is sealed on Earth.  I can't remember the rest, here's hoping somebody remembers the link."
Gundam,33w5vq,HamEaterQC,6,Sun Apr 26 07:45:19 2015 UTC,"There's an interview with Fukui and the anime production staff that was done after episode 7 was released. IIRC:   EF searched for Magellanica but couldn't find it. It and everyone involved disappeared. Riddhe returned to the EF with the Banshee. Banshee is treated like a nuclear weapon and locked up. Riddhe becomes a politician. Psycoframe research is completely halted (which was the case after CCA before Unicorn retconned it by introducing multiple new psycoframe MS)   No word on what happened to the Zeon remnants, but canonically and based on the ending of ep 7, they've basically lost all their remaining battle strength. The Republic of Zeon does indeed revert to Side 3 in UC 0100, and we know that after 0100 the EF is basically dealing with well-organized terrorist groups like Mufty until UC 0120 when the Mars Zeon appear. Even then, the MZ are basically a well organized terrorist group, as they don't have the resources to take on the EFSF in a full war."
Gundam,33w5vq,rms141,5,Sun Apr 26 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"Well, Zeon lost its autonomy, so Mineva is now the princess of a nonexistent kingdom. Therefore, she has no more significance or power. Banagher is a newtype, the most powerful one in existence, but with the opening of Laplace's Box, the existence of newtypes is no longer a political threat. So he's a scientific interest, at least. Considering how it ended, I see no reason why they wouldn't be able to be together. The unicorn is useless without Banagher and has already served its purpose as the key."
Gundam,33w5vq,AnimeGeek441,2,Sun Apr 26 07:56:55 2015 UTC,"Banagher is a newtype, the most powerful one in existence   Source on that? I'm pretty sure that Judau is considered to be the most powerful Newtype that we've seen so far."

At the very least, Banagher when he is in the Unicorn was capable of Newtype hax that surpass anything any other Newtype has ever done. Personally, I believe that if Amuro or Judau were to pilot the Unicorn, they'd be capable of similar stunts."
Gundam,33w5vq,SolDarkHunter,3,Sun Apr 26 08:49:50 2015 UTC,"Banagher when he is in the Unicorn   I'll give you that, fair enough. However, I do think that that is mostly due to the machine he is piloting, rather than any great newtype ability of his own. I don't really think that makes him a more powerful newtype compared to folks like Judaua, Kamille, or Amuro. I think that just makes him lucky to be piloting a machine that is so powerful when piloted by a newtype. Pit him against any of these other characters with both of them piloting something like a GM, and I'm sure that Banagher would pale in comparison.  That being said....who am I to argue with Tomino?"
Gundam,33w5vq,PantsBonanza,1 point,Sun Apr 26 09:46:23 2015 UTC,"I think that Amuro is more stronger of a newtype than Banagher, since he push a giant asteroid that's falling onto earth out of orbit, with a mobile suit that only have 1 psycoframe all by himself. While Banagher needs another the use of three shields and another Gundam to block one colony laser."

More of a focus on the dynamics between a small group of people operating in the warzone as they struggle to both survive and keep themselves together."

Gundam,33w9dy,Zonetr00per,5,Tue Apr 28 21:17:42 2015 UTC,im gonna probably get shit for this but i didnt like 08th MS team all that much. that love story with aina and the commander really killed it for me. everything else was good.     'super prototypes' that instantly wipe the field of everything without breaking a sweat     wasn't the machine aina's brother built just this?
Gundam,33w9dy,sdwoodchuck,6,Sun Apr 26 08:06:36 2015 UTC,"The love story was definitely the weakest point of 08thMS, yes.  I guess the Apsalus III gets a bit of a pass in my mind, because compared to later protagonist/antagonist super prototypes (Big Zam, Neue Ziel/Dendrobium, Sazabi/Nu, Qubeley, etc) it's relatively tame: More of a flying artillery platform than an all-around superior mobile weapon. Immensely powerful in the offensive role, yes, but only against large or fixed targets; it later takes significant damage from a nameless mook suit, which is way more than you can say for many other 'super prototype' examples."
Gundam,33w9dy,OhUmHmm,0,Sun Apr 26 08:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of 08th MS Team either, actually.  I love the combat segments, but the character interaction is just so thick on standard anime tropes that I was ready for it to be done a few episodes before it was."
Gundam,33w9dy,sdwoodchuck,0,Sun Apr 26 19:44:23 2015 UTC,I'm still trying to figure out why that fight with that ace is such a great fight. Lots of people seem to think it's the best gundam fight while I saw it as an okay fight
Gundam,33w9dy,EvilDrReef,2,Sun Apr 26 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"There are so many reasons why that ace fight is great that I probably won't be able to do it justice but I'll give it a go.  (Using the video from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COSevUR7AG8)   The protagonists are overwhelmed despite being 3 mobile suits and 3 guntanks against a single unit, but this has nothing to do with impervious armor or I-beam fields. Acknowledging technical limitations -- you get to see how the monoeye + computer imaging captures and analyzes images at (0:27)  Or when he shuts down the power of the Shiro's mobile suit, making him blind (6:53);  also the scenes at 8:07, showing how he has to manually reboot the system.  Or even just running out of ammo (6:05) The ace actually uses his surroundings, often in innovative or unexpected ways.  Such as using his grappling hook thingy to attack from above. (0:43).  I don't remember many other gundam fight scenes, outside of maybe recent Gundam Fighters / Try, that this actually happens.  To be fair, most take place in space, and I'm sure there are episodes where mobile suits hide behind asteroids, but for the most part it's a bunch of buzzing around shooting each other without any cover.  The ace continues to use cover, even shooting up dust, to hide. (2:30)  And using the highway road as a shield / weapon / cover as well. Because there are no ""super suits"" here, the battle is 90% mental.  The ace anticipates the actions of the enemy in a somewhat believable way (1:10 ish).  Also the scene at 6:07, both trying to outthink the other with quite a few feints -- such as throwing his sword away at 6:38.   Or when Norris ostensibly attempts to use grapple hook on Shiro, who evades, but Norris instead grabs the thrown sword from the ground. Shiro, the protagonist ""ace"", also employs his surrondings and uses his equipment in innovative ways, e.g. using his empty parachute (?) gear to grapple onto a wall.  Or tearing off his own arm to attack the enemy (8:43) Glorious animation throughout, and lovely little details such as the wires snapping from his shots at 4:43.  Or when you hear soldiers in the guntanks screaming.  Despite losing, the antagonist succeeds in his goal; both sides feel like they have won and lost something. The music is also well paced without taking away from the action.  Quiet somber tones when the enemy is hiding, drums when the actions get going.   Basically it's a very thoughtful fight that captures the ""real robot"" genre beautifully.  Some of the later Gundam series / alternate universes are basically ""super robot"" shows in which some combination of technical and telepathic powers makes fights either very predictable or unrelatable -- basically battles becomes post Frieza DragonBall Z with two people yelling at each other and shooting random energy blasts at an attempt to mask the fact that there's nothing intellectually stimulating.*  Which is fine, nothing wrong with a bunch of super heroes running around in armor, and indeed Newtypes are an integral component to the lore, but personally I feel it takes away from what made Gundam interesting.   *edit:  I mean with regard to the battle itself.  Most Gundam shows I've seen do a pretty good job of showing multiple sides of a story, no good/bad easy archetypes (for the most part), and motivating the individual battles.  But sometimes the battles themselves have nothing intellectually stimulating."
Gundam,33w9dy,starcolored,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:52:24 2015 UTC,"Can't answer for that one, actually, as I agree with you that it's good, but not the best.  I liked that combat in 08th is a bit more tactically aware than in a lot of Gundam series where it just cuts between a shot of one mobile suit firing its beam rifle, and then cuts to another mobile suit getting hit or evading or what have you, and there's no sense of the physical space the fight is occupying.  08th handles that pretty well, along with a few others."
Gundam,33w9dy,TheCivilizedGamer,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"That's true. To me, a gundam is supposed to be a super weapon therefore the pilot should be great and the gundam itself should be able to handle multiple enemies.

Gundam,33q6vl,lotto77102,5,Sat Apr 25 01:01:54 2015 UTC,"nullDC. And I am too, so here is the complete rundown on how to start the game:  (1) Unzip the .rar file, and start the emulator with ""nullDC_Win32_Release-NoTrace.exe""  (2) First you might want to switch off the fullscreen option, since it often seems to block the foreground completly and even ALT+TAB wont work.   Options nullDC Settings Fullscreen   (3) Now you have to format your VMU, so that you can save the game.   Open nullDC select ""normal boot"" select ""no Disk' when ""select image dialog box"" appears. This opens up the setup screen for DC. Select ""File"" config your VMU here.   (4) Enable the keyboard controls.    Options Select Plugins Maple (Input/Saves) Plugins: ""nullDC Controller [WinHook]""   DONT use the ""nullDC Keyboard"" options, since it refers to the optional Dreamcast keyboard, not your PCs keyboard  (5) Configure the keyboard controls   Options Maple Port A Config keys for Player 1   (6) Select the Image file    File Normal Boot Choose the appropriate .cdi or .gdi file  OK"

Gundam,33r5db,Zangori,17,Fri Apr 24 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"Personally, I loved the older style and the more complex story telling.    The article just seems like he's disappointed in the state of the industry. He talks about how he wrote it in the style he wanted, but it wasn't what people wanted. He wanted people to look beneath the surface and find the lessons, but most people just looked at the flashy robots.    He considers it a failure because he couldn't convince people to look deeper.     One line that really resonated with me was    Fundamentally, people don't respond to stories made with cold logic. If the logic is overpowering, it won't be a story you can be emotionally attached to.     It definitely summarizes his style. People often complain that his characters don't act ""logically"" and this kinda explains why. He wants to tell a story, even if that means people make some questionable decisions that audiences may not agree with."
Gundam,33r5db,ExpiredSushi,12,Fri Apr 24 21:55:28 2015 UTC,"I would argue there's a line between cold logic and being ADHD children who pick up toys and put them in their mouth, that line was not treaded at all."
Gundam,33r5db,kkbkbl,3,Fri Apr 24 23:55:01 2015 UTC,Do you have any examples?    One of the main points of the beginning was that very few people took war seriously at first. A lot of their more illogical actions were because they treated it all as a big game.
Gundam,33r5db,ExpiredSushi,7,Sat Apr 25 17:55:57 2015 UTC,++ on that.  The actions of the characters in the early part of the story were very illogical.    And it's like I don't like old anime from Tomino.  From Gundam 0079 to Turn-A and Ideon were much easier to understand because the people in there are not totally crazy.
Gundam,33r5db,cf18,3,Sat Apr 25 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"Umm. I assure you, everyone on 0079 is crazy. Every pilot deserts White Base at some point in the show only to come back when it's climactically convenient. And the kids? They kept the god damned three year olds on a space ship in a time of war.  I'm not saying it's not great in it's own right (I love the original) but let's not gloss over the fact that a lot of things happen in Tomino's earlier shows that make absolutely no sense when logic is applied."
Gundam,33r5db,corezon,4,Sat Apr 25 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"However he still tried to do too much in too little time. Some of the illogical decisions his characters made were completely at odds with how they were acting a scene before with very little reason as to why they changed or with the reasoning going on in the background. People don't just do 180s in personality even when they're illogical. Maybe if he had had more time to expand on why these characters acted as they did people would be less confused and enjoy it more. It's like he had a 50 episode series planned out, the studio said ""No, we'll give you 26"" and he tried to cram those 50 hours of content into 26 and as a result his characters came out making bizarre looking decisions because we only got half the information and build up."
Gundam,33r5db,Japboix1,5,Sat Apr 25 13:15:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is what he was going for, but I can't help but feel it was poorly executed. I really wish he had given this series more time and maybe thought a little more about how it would be received, mainly because I think he could have done it leagues better. I really love Tomino and I really wanted this series to be good, it just didn't meet what I expected from him and was a let down overall. Although I did love the mobile suits in this series."
Gundam,33r5db,Xakaree,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"The problems Tomino goes over in this interview pretty much lie with what you said.  His way of storytelling is 'outdated' by the industries standards.  Though it is admirable that he wants to keep with how he wants to direct, the problem is that his 'intended audience' according to previous interviews is growing up with the current model of 'moe', and that a show like Reconguista could not be appreciated fully because of that."
Gundam,33r5db,corezon,3,Fri Apr 24 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"He may be right in thinking he'll be vindicated. The original 0079 wasn't well received either and gained popularity in the years that followed.

Gundam,33r5db,NeonLightIllusion,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"The thing is that things change.  Tomino's standard of directing has been to show and not tell.  While,  yes,  there have been shows and directors that have done far better,  Tomino is so set in his ways that he refuses to adapt and change to todays standards.  His blame is on the industry, not the viewers."
Gundam,33r5db,Turambar87,7,Sat Apr 25 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"Can this sub please send Tomino a card or something? He sounds so beaten down. Personally, I love Reconguista- I'm only on episode 9, but I'm watching the new episodes as soon as they're uploaded. Does it have flaws? Absolutely. But I absolutely LOVE all the characters. Bar a few.. wierd bits (Bellri's Mother laughing at that hippo head), they're very understandable, and I think Tomino puts a lot of logic behind their actions- even if it's not plainly obvious at first viewing. I HOPE Reconguista will end up like X, in hind sight. Flawed, but well renowned amongst fans."
Gundam,33r5db,ConchobarMacNess,13,Sat Apr 25 07:47:18 2015 UTC,"It's ok, weird old japanese guy. I got what was going on, and i liked it."
Gundam,33r5db,LacusClyne,8,Fri Apr 24 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"Tomino acknowledges that anime is supposed to be ""happier"" than what he produced, but claimed he couldn't bring himself to make something like that.   You know. Some of the most influential series out there like Madoka Magika, Clannad, Death Note, ETC. Generally, start and end on a down note.   I think what he said earlier in the article is spot on.    ""Fundamentally, people don't respond to stories made with cold logic. If the logic is overpowering, it won't be a story you can be emotionally attached to.""   Which is the point, you can skip over a 'happier' series, but don't try to be so gritty and lifelike that somewhere in the process you lose what makes characters...characters. Tomino loves making his characters as life like as possible down to the Voice acting and breaking down the over-the-top stereotypes that anime creates. It's just in the end, like it or not, anime is a medium and characters need to have character to them so that they can engage people.  I think Tomino needs to sit down with some other writers, flesh out some outlines, give them bullet points. Then from there, let them rework it as needed, keeping the major points he selected. I don't think sad or downbeat anime are off the map. Even Miyazaki's stuff is pretty depressing.  The problem is Tomino doesn't listen to anyone, he does things his way even if it's not feasible. He wanted Reconguista to be longer, when they said no he stuck with his original plot line and just tried to cram it in. I think Tomino just needs some people who can keep him on the reigns, utilize him as more a story concept artist rather than a director."
Gundam,33r5db,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:03:42 2015 UTC,i thought I read that he planned on the series being longer but he couldn't due to his stamina or something
Gundam,33r5db,87612446F7,6,Sat Apr 25 03:34:07 2015 UTC,"I think this is the quote you are thinking of;   I'm aware that the amount of information wasn't digested enough. To be honest, I wanted to make this as a 4 cour, 1 year show. If I did, I could show detailed settings such as Photon Battery factory and faction relationships between insiders. But because of my stamina problem and the current state of industry, 2 cour was the best I can do.   Now, he is older. But- this points back to what I was saying, he doesn't distribute the weight, he does things his way and that's the end of it, if he's at the wheel no one is going to take it from him until he's done. So, of course, when he goes to Sunrise and asks for a 4-cour show (48-50 Episodes), he's going to get turned down. Hell, he could have stayed at the wheel for the first 2 and then swapped out after handing the plot outline to someone else. I think his comment about the 'state of the industry' is referring to the article OP posted, he seems to have the conception that people don't want Tomino-style work and that he isn't 'mainstream' enough to make the show a commercial success. He's not wrong, but he's also not willing to compromise because he's stubborn as hell. Don't get me wrong I love a lot of Tomino's work, but at the very least he needs someone in the co-pilots seat to sort of reign him in when he gets too carried away.   Again, that's not happening because Tomino does what Tomino wants and no one can tell him otherwise. So, it's a little understandable Sunrise doesn't want to give him a 4-cour. Really, Tomino is great at building worlds, writing characters, writing plotlines, but his story telling is awful. And that's a lot of what Directing is, taking the script and forming it into a watchable story.   I'll bet you if he wrote it, handed it off to someone like Furuhashi (Gundam Unicorn Director), Reconguista would have been green lighted for a 4-cour. He could have even stood in as a producer to make sure things ran close to what he liked.   Tl;DR Yes, he's old, but that's not his main problem. He writes a damn good world, character, and plot. But, no sense for the story telling/directing aspect. Couple that with the fact that hes so stubborn that he tried to cram a 4-cour worth of content into a 2-cour, didn't even try to compromise, and that's how we got Reconguista being what it is.  EDIT: I should just clarify, I love Tomino's work. He just needs to chill out and not get so wrapped up in his own ego to the point that his own work becomes convoluted."

Like, when I was watching Zeta--it felt less like one developing story and more like forty or so episodes of Mobile Suit fights, worldbuilding and occasional character development that suddenly remembered at the end that it was supposed to be a story.  I mean, Tomino's stories just lack a kind of... driving force to me. It doesn't feel like the plot is building to anything, at least not anything long term."

With a terrifying amount of effort, we managed to wrap everything up by Episode 26.   That was the main problem for the majority of the people who hated on the show. They're so used to being spoon-fed plot devices and forced exposition that G-Reco was too complex for them.    He predicts that in 50 years, he will be vindicated.   It won't take even remotely that long. Watch, in as little as a few years, people will be praising the series in droves. Half the people are just bandwagon-ers anyways with no real opinion of their own. Tomino did a great job on G-Reco, and it's really a shame that the industry didn't back him up -- although it's not entirely surprising given the huge amounts of generic crap all the studios keep pushing out each season, year after year.

The entire point of the Second Stage project wasa that Durandal realised how one machine can change the outcome of an entire battle and wanted a highly adaptable MS that could dominate in any situation, and that ended up creating Destiny, which can stomp 99% of all mobile suits in any situation. Destiny isn't a dueling suit, it's an all- purpose commando suit. Calling it worse than the Infinite Justice is like saying my survival knife sucks because a machete is better for cutting through the forest.   Basically, SF is the perfect long-range suit and is built for beating tons of enemies at one time, IJ is the perfect close-range suit and is built for beating single, powerful oponents, and the Destiny is a balance between the two.   Pilot skill also probably had something to do with it- as awesome and seemingly unstoppable as Kira is, Athrun is actually the strongest pilot in SEED (undefeated while in SEED mode.) It's not that Shinn is a bad pilot, it's just that nobody beats Athrun.   TL;DR: the Destiny Gundam is great, it only got thrashed because Athrun is a better pilot and IJ is a specialized dueling suit."

Gundam,33rfgl,Amuro_Ray,0,Sun Apr 26 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"I always found it strange that even when they claimed that the Destiny was ""very advanced"" in the anime, it was actually waaaaaaay behind in terms of weaponry.  I mean seriously, EVERY SINGLE weapon the Destiny has NEEDS to be activated manually by using it's hands. The ASS, Beam Rifle, Beam Cannon, Beam Boomerangs... by the time he has finished setting up, his foes like the Strike Freedom already launched his weapons by firing from the backpack."
Gundam,33rfgl,strikeraiser,4,Sat Apr 25 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"Not that I don't agree with you, but this logic is really flawed. It is the same as saying the unicorn is way more advance than strike freedom in weaponry because strike freedom requires a pilot in the cockpit, so while Kira is getting in the cockpit I could just shout ""Unicorn!"" Very loud and my gundam would fly in with its shield and machine gunned the SF into pieces.   It just doesn't make much sense, the arms are a vital part of the MS just like the cockpit, and they are designed to provide flexibility to hold different weapons, of course the firepower of the MS would be crippled if it lose both of its arms, otherwise we are better of just going with two extra leg for the boost. Most MS rely on having its arms to fight and Destiny actually has extra armor and a beam shield to make double sure that it doesn't get cripple easily, it may still be a stupid idea to put all your eggs in one basket, but it doesn't mean it is ""behind in weaponry""."
Gundam,33rfgl,BoyGodz,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"I think what he means is that the Destiny is highly advanced, then it must have some weapon that can be use without it's hands. Destiny Gundam is said to be versatile but when it loses just 1 hand, it must have other way to ultilize his weapon. For example the Destiny loses it's right hand then he already lost 1 Palma Fiocina, 1 Hand to use the ASS or the boomerang. If the Destiny loses both, it is more or less jsut a flying piece of crap because the palma fiocinas are gone, the beam cannon can't be used as well as the ASS and the beam bomerang. It also loses both shields along with it. Versatile means that it can handle many situation well but since everything depends on the Destiny's hands, ""versatile"" here only suits for the SF and the IJ. Since both of them have many equipments that can be ultilize on it's own."
Gundam,33rfgl,NageQsad,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"Is that not more of less the same case for other MS? If SF loses one arm then it lose the ability to wield its two beam rifle, the main feature of the SF, and possibly lose all ability to fight close combat unless it docks the remaining beam rifle on its waist, disabling the two waist rail gun, leaving it with only the stomach cannon which has a small firing angle and is not flexible to use or funnels which is no where as powerful as a standard BR. IJ is also dependent on its backpack, without it IJ is just a normal gundam type with tons of blade and no method to get into close combat, and have I mentioned that Athrun has a thing with sending the said important backpack into the enemy? It is a real mystery why the Backpack doesn't get blown up first time he does it.  Of course losing an arm is a disadvantage to all suit, if a MS loses one of its arm and got away, they should return the mother ship immediately, specially ones that holds a shield. So if the Destiny is flying piece of crap without its arm, then that's all it needs to be, fly real fast back to Minerva and get repaired, not hang around without arms. With the extra protection on the Destiny's arm, the only reason it get destroyed so easily is because the plot requires it to, and that's the thing with GSD, that none of the setting truly matter when the plot armor is here.  Honestly, all these criticism is all just nitpicking, none of the gundam design in GSD is close to being sensible or even logical. Why do you need a physical shield when you have beam shield? Why does SF has to deploy all its Dragoons before using its wing of light? Why does SF has wing of light in the first place? Originally SF is a 1hp flying bomb with its golden joints until they changed it to joints being VPS armor, how does PS armor help reducing friction, I thought PS is suppose to phase-shift matters that come into contact, wouldn't it just melt/vaporise all of SF and IJ's limbs? Compare to these, Destiny's hand problem seems to be the least of our concern."

Gundam,33oipt,Irrel_M,7,Fri Apr 24 07:44:58 2015 UTC,That's correct. He said that SRW Z is 'The Real Shinn'. Apparently it's due to the writer of Destiny thinking that Shinn's VA was having an affair with his wife.

For me it created an emotional response and appealed to me emotionally.  I know it's not he best of the best, but at the end of the day watching both series, though Destiny more, gave me some satisfaction and I appreciate that.

RELEVANT   ""This doesn't mean people who hate it are wrong, it just means that there are different opinions out there""   I think that one may have came out wrong. I feel like the right word for that is ""there are people with different tastes out there."" Because honestly, with SEED, there's way too much factual evidence to prove how shittily designed and written it is as a whole. But even despite the bad writing and other problems with SEED, people can still definitely find enjoyment out of it.  And you seem to do just that. You're fully aware of just how fucked up SEED & Destiny are and acknowledge all of their problems, and yet continue to enjoy the series for what it is regardless. SEED fans like that put a smile on my face every time, because it restores a tiny bit of faith in the Anime Community with me each time.  You can enjoy SEED all you want, just as long as you don't try to make excuses for it's flaws. At that point, that's where it all comes down to personal tastes and how much enjoyment you can get out of something, despite the overall quality of it.

And the same source told me that Bright Noa was a British Hongkonger. Mirai Yashima is of course a completely Japanese name. And someone already mentioned Hayato. Ryu Jose (José?) is also Latin American, and I wonder if ""Ryu"" is supposed to imply he's yet another Japanese-Latino.  It makes sense that a bunch of Federation characters would have Latino ancestry, since the Federation was mostly put together by South American nations.  Throughout most of the franchise, you get the sense that nationality and ancestry isn't important, but I thought this was less true as you go back earlier. They probably had an ethnicity in mind for each of the White Base crew. In ZZ, you had the Blue Team, who were fighting for Taureg independence. And I heard that in the Unicorn novel, Loni Garvey's father was a jihadi first, and a supporter of Zeon second. Rare instances of people whose ethnic and national ties haven't been overwritten by space-nationalism, Spacenoid and Earthnoid identities.  Then look at Victory Gundam. There's a village in the modern-day Czech Republic named after a fictional Polynesian word. When did that happen? You get the sense that people have migrated all around the world––and to and from space––so much that blood is no longer what gives someone a tie to their land. Or look at the Zanscare royal family. Nobody cares that the queen's daughter is dark-skinned, nobody finds it weird that she has an Indian name.  I've wondered if this global melting-pot thing explains why so many people have just weird names, even in the Early UC stories."

That being said Gundam The Origin does add details on that and you could pretty much be right, as His parents are called Roger and Michele - presumably ''Michèle'' - and after Astraia's death, she has a little grave/moment on the Aznable estate and it reads ''À une mère aimante'' [French for ''To a loving mother''], however it's unclear if Roger, Michèle, or Casval wrote that  Casval and Artesia's last name is Deikun.

It could be that the original Mass family is of German descendants, but it is also said in GTO that Teabolo looks nothing close to his adopted children and he feared their relationship would be found out because of it, so chances are Casval and Artesia doesn't really have German features."

Probably because it had to run too long. Endless Waltz, on the other hand, got to distill things down to 3 episodes. The focus was on interesting characters, intriguing mecha designs, energetic and poppy songs, and a story that, while not great, did not overstay its welcome."

Instead, my first tastes of Gundam were Endless Waltz and G.Gundam followed (or simultaneously) by 08th MS Team Gundam.  But later on, I did watch Gundam Wing and while it started fun and it did provide entertainment all around, the story stopped making sense to me after a while. I had no idea what anyone's motives were anymore and things just seemed to start happening because they needed to happen instead of because of events that led up to it.  Endless Waltz in comparison was straight to the point. I got some back story about some little girl and this guy, get a surprise twist (or more) and then Heero comes and saves the day with that awesome Gundam Wing Zero Custom. No complicated colonies trying to overthrow the Earth, no strange third faction popping out of nowhere to fight... someone... I don't even know what happened at the end of Wing aside from the fight between Heero and Treize... or was it Zechs? But he survived and showed up in Endless Waltz...  It's been around seven years or so since I last watched Gundam Wing but considering I can (badly) remember things from other Gundam shows...

Many are fans of it because of nostalgic reasons alone, and are not willing to admit to any flaw in the show. The people that are actually able to be honest, can see that the show has quite many flaws, critically speaking, yet not everybody looks at a show with a critical eye. It all comes down to if you like it or not, but overall, Wing isn't really that liked in the big picture.  Hahaa, what I'm trying to say is that yes, there are Wing haters, plenty of them. Also, remember that Gundam 00 is pretty much a remake of Wing."

Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,5,Thu Apr 23 10:28:29 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, because of nostalgic reasons, people don't really talk too badly about Wing, as they saw it on TV as kids. It is easier to talk badly about something you dislike than something you hold dear to your heart. Also, because of nostalgic reasons, people are not that fair. Wing fans are hard to deal with at times as they see nothing wrong with Wing, even though it has many similar flaws to Destiny. However, not everything has to be negative or critical. If you enjoy something, you enjoy it, doesn't really matter why. It all depends on personal preference and understanding, more-so than looking at things with a critical eye."
Gundam,33kmm8,MisterPuck,2,Thu Apr 23 11:35:17 2015 UTC,"It's kind of funny you say that, because I started with Wing on Toonami myself and always thought it was great... that was until more recently when I finally had the opportunity to re-watch it since the first time I'd seen it. It definitely didn't hold up well at all. Like you said, the pacing is off a lot of the time and the plot liked to jump around a lot to the point that some things just come out of no where.  Fortunately for me, it was pretty easy to get over it since Zeta became my personal favorite several years ago. I don't hate Wing though, but I will acknowledge it's flaws.   That said, if it weren't for Wing we wouldn't have the Wing Zero Custom, so I don't think anyone can hate it completely."
Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,3,Thu Apr 23 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I fully understand that. I have the same situation with Digimon Adventure. I still hold it close to my heart but when I re-watched it was not as good as I remembered it. But I still love it because of nostalgic reasons.  There is nothing wrong with liking something that isn't perfect. Heck, people these days are far too critical and forget to enjoy shows, so liking anime even if they are flawed is completely fine and human. Heck, I enjoyed Gundam Seed Destiny because I loved Seed, I know its flaws but that doesn't mean I can't like it, they hit the heart for me and that's more than enough for me to enjoy something.  Wing was fine, it has redeeming factors that are extremely good, even for todays standard, and Wing Zero Custom is wicked awesome."

Seed Destiny may get the bulk of hate, as people love to pick that anime a part, but the fans of the show are often very open and honest about its flaws. Heck, I'm one of them. I'm fully aware of Seed Destiny's flaws but I still enjoy it, because like Wing, it was one of the first anime I saw in Europe. The first 50 episodes of Seed tho, there isn't equal amount of hate. Seed was solid."
Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:01:00 2015 UTC,"there's one series that's so hated that it doesn't exist.  so I'd say just a small part of hate goes to SEED: Destiny and ""most hate"" goes to that one."
Gundam,33kmm8,ic33,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:31:09 2015 UTC,"I have seen quite a bit of hate for Seed Destiny, but I've stayed pretty clear from that series. It seems to insane on the mobile suit side of things. I loved UC for it's (while sometimes goofy) mobile suits. They seemed more grounded and war machine like, whereas the few scenes I've seen from Seed does not."
Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,3,Thu Apr 23 09:42:32 2015 UTC,"Most hate for Destiny goes to its broken plot and bad characters, not really MS design---with the exception of few notable individuals of course."
Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,2,Thu Apr 23 09:56:15 2015 UTC,"The lack of character development in Destiny is one of the biggest issues, it's like Wing in that sense, no character really grows. However, in Seed, the development was on point."

Gundam,33kmm8,MisterPuck,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"Well, Quattre had a mental breakdown, he still remained the same individual for the most part. The most intriguing characters in Wing would have to be Zechs and Treize, as far as being interesting and exciting to follow, because they are layered characters."
Gundam,33kmm8,ConfederateDave,3,Thu Apr 23 18:51:59 2015 UTC,"Gundam Seed Destiny is the most talked about Gundam show on the internet by far, and Kira Yamato is the most discussed Gundam character. Good or bad, there are always people defending and offending."
Gundam,33kmm8,razorlikeblue,3,Thu Apr 23 10:02:16 2015 UTC,"Wing had lot more pros than cons. I rank it up there with Zeta Gundam as the best and it is personally my favorite series. I suggest that people who have an issue with the series to read the Glory of the Losers manga. Sure the animation could have  been better, but we have to understand the budget in the first 25 episodes IIRC was cut. I felt that the 5 gundam pilots had a different personalities that formed a great team dynamic(when they did team up). Not every Gundam series (nor should they) follow an UC model, the point of the AU universes is too introduce new themes and perspective to the series. How many times are we gonna see a teenager magically find his way into a cockpit of Gundam and you know the rest."
Gundam,33kmm8,phantomcosmonauts,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"I suggest that people who have an issue with the series to read the Glory of the Losers manga.   If the series doesn't stand on its own, then it's not a good series. While reading that manga may add a lot to the story and make it more enjoyable, it cannot be considered when judging the anime. The anime is being judged solely on its own content and if it's not good then no amount of outside material will make it better."
Gundam,33kmm8,Azal8522,3,Thu Apr 23 18:34:12 2015 UTC,I think it's what got a lot of people into gundam in the U.S. When Cartoon Network had it on Toonami during the afternoons. It's how I got hooked on gundam.
Gundam,33kmm8,Golden_Aura,2,Thu Apr 23 17:03:14 2015 UTC,Yep if I hadn't seen wing on toonami I probably wouldn't know what gundam is .
Gundam,33kmm8,KAFKAAFKA,5,Fri Apr 24 08:32:37 2015 UTC,"It's a good show. People that hate on the designs just don't like fun. Epyon is incredible. Zechs and Treize are great characters with shades of grey. There's nice character development throughout. Excellent soundtrack. An epic final multi-episode climax. Not much not to like about Wing, imo. edit: a word"
Gundam,33kmm8,WaywardMetroid,3,Thu Apr 23 09:44:30 2015 UTC,THANK YOU
Gundam,33kmm8,mixmastermind,2,Thu Apr 23 09:52:16 2015 UTC,Zechs was great until they forced him into being a bad guy for no good reason.
Gundam,33kmm8,WaywardMetroid,2,Thu Apr 23 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was because I grew up watching Gundam Wing on Toonami after school everyday... but Wing is by far my favorite. I just watched it last week and it is amazing. Is the dialogue bad for the dub? Oh you bet. It is so laughably terrible in many cases that I laughed out loud where it was supposed to be serious. ""HEEEEERO, I HAVE A LETTER FOR YOUUUUU!"" - Relena from a plane on the middle of Heero vs. Zechs.  The show is the best not because it does everything right... but because it executes it's message, theme, epicness, music and tone perfectly. Also, Wing Zero and Epyon are the two most badass machines ever. Pair them up and put them up against ANY army in any other series and they win. It really is amazing how cool their designs are."
Gundam,33kmm8,starcolored,2,Fri Apr 24 05:03:50 2015 UTC,"Gundam Wing is amazing. As far as a cartoon aimed for kids go that was produced in the 90s along side Dragon Ball Z etc it is on another level. It aspires to things that some adult films even fail to grasp.  The nature of war.  The point of soldiers The ethics of super weapons and the people who use them. The ethics of combat when AI is used to fight in Human wars. The ethics of turning soldiers into machines and removing there moral conciousness from war.  It features a main character that is used as a scape goat by everyone around him too fight their battles for them, he becomes twisted  and self masochistic in the process, and through out the course of the series, learns to find his own need to live, he is the ""hero"" not because he's a good person, but because he's a bad person that overcomes the difficulties of  history that have been paced on him. He is a symbolic charachter that represents the nature of humanity to overcome the forces that make it violent, which is contrary to the argument put forward by Zechs that humanity simply is ""violent"" by its nature.   Its a good show."
Gundam,33kmm8,WaywardMetroid,4,Sun Apr 26 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"The way the characters looked, the mobile suits, and even the color pallet, were very realistic and reflected the stark attitude of the show.   Are you kidding me right now? Quatre looks like a ""super manga style giant eyed baby face"".  Wufei is the most stereotypical anime cool kid ever. And don't get me started on Trowa or Heero ""Yaoi Bait"" Yui. That other dude is alright, I guess.  Compare that to UC, which admittedly has its share of baby faces. But compare Bright Noa, Daguza, and even Cameron Bloom (who was supposed to be a pushover, remember?) to the Gundam pilots of Wing. Also Zechs is just Char. They weren't even trying at all, at least Graham Aker and Harry Ord were visually different and indulged in a little bit more hyperbole and metaphor.  And the mobile suits are ridiculously designed. Deathscythe looks like the batmobile and a Gundam played chicken. Sandrock's melee weapons make NO sense at all. Why use metal blades when beam sabers exist? The Wing Gundam itself is okay, if a bit uninspired, but it definitely doesn't look like military hardware. Heavyarms wouldn't work at all because there's no way the guns would all fit and still allow the thing to move. I don't even know what to say about Shenlong other than it looks like an SD kit in regular proportions.  The grunt suits are okay (except for the Leo's head, good Lord). Tallgeese is unarguably the best design in the series.  Gundam 00 took the idea of Wing and did everything ten times better. Better Zaku rip offs, better Gundams, better grunt suits in general, better over all writing, and that animation.  Edit: And have you even watched Gundam? Almost universally the plots revolve around how terrible war is. SEED might do that whole whining thing, and 0079 only did it so Amuro could develop into an ace pilot, but Gundam 00 literally begins by depicting child soldiers dying in a jihad. Again, another thing it did better than Wing."
Gundam,33kmm8,starcolored,13,Thu Apr 23 08:38:16 2015 UTC,"I don't completely agree with this, but goddamn are you filled with some righteous conviction.   You got a fire in your belly son."
Gundam,33kmm8,WaywardMetroid,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:28:11 2015 UTC,"The first Gundam series I watched was 00. Then, MSG. And I figured Wing was popular for a reason, so I watched the first episode. I had my doubts because of the designs and opening, but what sealed the deal was ""I'll kill you"" AND THEN SHE KEEPS TRYING TO TALK TO HIM. Every time I tried to watch it, I couldn't stop thinking about how 00 had done everything better.  And, as per my ancient tradition, I pick fights with people who only look at stuff through rose-tinted glasses."
Gundam,33kmm8,starcolored,5,Thu Apr 23 09:34:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think they were looking through nostalgia goggles or anything though. It's not like they said Wing is the best shit of all time, they openly admitted it has a lot of problems and were just discussing some of its good points."
Gundam,33kmm8,laneo333,0,Thu Apr 23 10:06:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but a lot of people do. And his good points contradicted themselves. Wing DOES have ""big eyed manga characters"". And I don't know if I'd call its story mature or even realistic."
Gundam,33kmm8,Brenticus302,3,Thu Apr 23 10:15:59 2015 UTC,"Quatre's really the odd one out, though, and they admitted that by saying ""for the most part"". They also didn't call the story realistic, what they called realistic was the visual aesthetic. The story was called serious, not mature but serious, and I guess that's a fair enough claim."
Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,0,Thu Apr 23 10:26:14 2015 UTC,"There are lots of browns, olive greens, greys and so on which I felt made the military themes more immersive   Was what I was referring to. Sorry, it's 3:30 AM. To me it was five untouchable dudes going up against the Big Bads. Not really much of a ""military"" theme. It seems like OP is trying really hard to deny that Wing is exactly what they said it wasn't.  And what about Trowa? Or Heero? Or Wufei? They're all generic looking anime characters."
Gundam,33kmm8,CLGbyBirth,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:28:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's a fair enough assessment from the perspective of the Gundam pilots, but there's also a lot of other stuff going on in the beginning from Zechs and company's point of view which had that aspect to it more so than Heero and the rest. Then you start getting into the mobile dolls and Treize talking about how the meaning of war is lost when it's no longer fought with soldiers, so I consider that enough of a military theme personally, but it's a different kind than U.C. and stuff.  They may or may not be generic looking anime characters, but that wasn't what they said. They said ""super manga style giant eyed baby faces"". Look at Wufei, man. He's got the squintiest fucking eyes I've ever seen after Brock from Pokemon. I mean, there's a pretty clear distinction between this and this."
Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,6,Thu Apr 23 10:44:51 2015 UTC,I thought they were the opposite of generic. Look at the characters in SEED and G...now THATS generic

Gundam,33kmm8,WaywardMetroid,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:42:08 2015 UTC,"The ""I'll Kill You"" got me extremely excited in the first episode, but the only things Heero kept killing was empty suits. I mean he just threatens people without really ever going through with his threaths... find that moment thesedays as being extremely hilarious, considering what ensues in the following episodes. Don't know what I mean? Well, he threatens others but is quick to want to kill himself. I wonder if he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says ""I'll kill you"" to himself."
Gundam,33kmm8,JQuilty,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:55:24 2015 UTC,well to be fair i think that was his 1st interaction with a girl. Keep in mind that heero is still a teenage boy i think he was like 16 or 17 at that time.
Gundam,33kmm8,ErkiB,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  However, it would have been nice to see his character in a bit more detail, give him more reasoning behind his actions as they often left more questions than answers."
Gundam,33kmm8,WaywardMetroid,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:23:12 2015 UTC,I definitely agree on the character design part. Wing has one of the most astoundingly bishonen main casts I've ever seen.

Gundam,33kmm8,WaywardMetroid,3,Thu Apr 23 10:18:38 2015 UTC,"Gundam 00 took the idea of Wing and did everything ten times better   00 has nothing in common with Wing aside from a vague ""Gundams vs the world"" vibe. Setsuna and Heero have practically nothing in common, Wing has no augmented humans, Celestial Being was doing what it was doing to prep for first contact while the Wing boys were more or less aimlessly destroying things, Graham is nothing like Zechs, 00 has nobody like Treize, etc etc"
Gundam,33kmm8,JQuilty,2,Thu Apr 23 13:03:26 2015 UTC,"Obviously Wing doesn't stand up to first group of UC series, but it still has its good points. I haven't seen 00, and the trailers I've watched and little synopses I've read haven't really put me in a rush to see it. I plan to get around to it eventually, but not now.   I'll admit, Wing has A LOT of flaws. Sometimes its hard to make it through the show even as a fan myself. But I do think it has certain good qualities about it that of better realized would have made for an amazing series.   Also, EVERYONE is Char. Ever.   Zechs is Char  Full Frontal is Char Iron Mask is Char QUATTRO is Char.  He's the proto villain for alot of Gundam stories."
Gundam,33kmm8,laneo333,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:36:10 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day it all depends on if you look at it critically or not. People love shows whether they are good or bad, we all have out guilty pleasures as well. There is nothing wrong with liking Wing, it has some redeeming factors, without a doubt in mind, but critically speaking, it is miles behind Gundam 00, as Gundam 00 is a remake of Wing to a certain degree and it does everything better. So if you liked Wing, you will fall in love with 00, I'm sure of it."
Gundam,33kmm8,Mayomori,-1,Thu Apr 23 09:57:29 2015 UTC,"Char isn't the villain, no one is really. And Iron Mask is Darth Vader, get it right.  And the thing is, what you said was good about Wing was just as bad as your strawman examples. 00 is objectively the best AU and I recommend it to everyone to get a feel for what other Gundam shows they'd like. I will concede that it does fall into the ""style"" of anime around that time, but it's leagues better than Wing."
Gundam,33kmm8,nagato-san,7,Thu Apr 23 09:38:57 2015 UTC,"00 is objectively the best AU    How dare you.   I CHALLENGE YOU TO GUNDAM FIGHT! I WILL DEFEAT YOU, WITH THE HELP OF KYOJI!"
Gundam,33kmm8,Bugseye,2,Thu Apr 23 10:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Char's an anti-hero but he's still an antagonist.   I can't say 00 is bad, I've never seen it but the style and mobile suits I've seen in footage and such hasn't swayed me to see it. However, I will give it a chance at some point to know for sure. And as for strawman examples I wasn't try to win a debate, I merely pointed out some things I personally enjoyed about it. Wing isn't perfect, and its flaws are pretty obvious but I enjoyed it for what it did get right in my view."
Gundam,33kmm8,Secret_turtles2345,-1,Thu Apr 23 09:56:58 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that your examples of what other series do wrong also show up in Wing. As someone else put it, a lot of the cast are bishonen, compared to UC which generally tends to have more realistic looking characters.  And 00's suit design is phenomenal, you best watch your tongue. The Flag is one of the best mobile suits ever designed. And Exia is amazing as well, mostly because it shatters the mold of the ""lead"" Gundam. I highly recommend watching 00."
Gundam,33kmm8,Mega_Booty_Patrol,2,Thu Apr 23 10:21:12 2015 UTC,"Char isn't the villain, no one is really   In UC? There are certainly outright villains. Degwin, Girhen, and Kycillia are outright villains. Jamitov, Bask, and Haman do what they do for the sake of their own power. Colonel Killing is an outright war criminal. There's nothing redeemable about Martha Vist. Char himself arguably became a villain outright in Char's Counterattack."
Gundam,33kmm8,Brenticus302,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:06:43 2015 UTC,"I started on Wing and certainly agree it can cause clouded judgement due to nostalgia. But putting that aside I still think it is a noteworthy series, primarily for its war politics which were well developed. Does it have flaws? Certainly. There are some elements of campiness, the stock animation usage is an epidemic, and the Gundams are flagrantly overpowered.   I would wholeheartedly agree that 00 is superior to Wing, and did do much of it better...but I believe a tour of Gundam would not be complete without watching Wing.  Now G Gundam on the other hand...we dont get along..."
Gundam,33kmm8,Air0087,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:50:49 2015 UTC,"About Sandrock's swords, I think they used metal blades because its fit Quatre ""I don't want to kill"" personality before going full crazy ,but its fall flat when he kept hitting vital spot instead while blabbing with himself. Also, beam coating can be used on the blade, I just don't remember Wing universe have it or not."
Gundam,33kmm8,KazakiLion,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"I feel that Wing sadly gets far more criticism than is due to it since it was many western fans introduction to the series. Heck, I personally thought the dialogue was great (when watching subbed of course). There were some problems, sure, but none that stood out well enough that I can remember them.   It seems that some of the hate goes to Hiro, so maybe it's just a age thing where the kinds of fans who like Kira or anime like Sword Art Online may prefer idealistic, mary sue, ""touchy feely"" kinds of MC's. ;)"

Gundam,33kmm8,CrashmanX,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"While I may not like some of the same things about it (I agree with many criticisms of character design and about the Gundams not seeming very military), I agree.  GW may be overrated by nostalgia for many (though I've never seen anyone like that on here...ever, actually), but it's still a really good show.  YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN YOU SAID SOME THINGS STILL STICK OUT.  The show has a lot of personality.  From the music (Ah! The music!) to the characters (Except Wu Fei...), there was just a lot of personality.    Some of it is silly, but there are always dramatic, sweeping arcs, and there seems to be more players than, say, 00 (which I will agree is, from a critical perspective, superior).  The Gundams are way cooler than is possible (literally...but also in a good way), the pilots are all very distinct (they aren't super deep, but they are memorable), and I think a lot of the secondary characters got a lot of love in Wing (00 just kind of forgot about Graham for a long time, and the stuff with scar-face-guy was left dangling forever).  Wing's story is very serious, and sometimes that made its sillier moments fall even flatter, but in the end Wing's got style, and its got personality.  And I love it for it.  Even though I'm a fairly dedicated UC Elitist now (Wing is somewhat low on my list of fave shows)."

Shinn is bad, ofcourse but that is just because his character development stopped when Jesus Yamato take over, he is quite an interesting character, i am very impressed by the way he research about the freedom in order to defeat it because he knows the differences between him and Kira. Kio, on the other hand, when in the Age 3, no problem. But when he have the Age FX I stopped watching, nuff said. And can Nina Purpleton considered a main character? If yes then she is the queen here, most people just want her to die. She is so fucking bad, a motherfucking asshole after what she did to Kou."

Gundam,33f8am,Terminimal,3,Wed Apr 22 01:17:05 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that maybe we'll get another season entirely. From the sounds of it there was a bit of rushing and unexplained things in the show itself.  Haven't watched G-Rec yet so I don't know all the details. Just a speculation on my end.

I kinda got disheartened to see myself and others getting downvoted in threads asking for explanations and opinions on the pacing and character interactions/factions, etc.  I know how Tomino likes to leave things for viewers to figure out, and I got that from Early UC and especially from Turn A.

(Those sure were federation soldiers camped out in Amuro's house.) Zeon didn't necessarily control the entire continent- (Matilda's supply line wasn't supplying nothing, after all- they sure weren't flying cross continent just to resupply a single ship.)  ETA- Also pointing out, Amuro's mother playing nurse in what is clearly zeon controlled space is in the same episode appears to happen nearby, but Amuro takes the core-fighter to actually get there, implying it's not actually all that close at all. The two locations could have easily been (and almost certainly were) miles apart."
Gundam,33busv,aceoftherebellion,1 point,Tue Apr 21 10:40:19 2015 UTC,"I had to double check the episode because at first I thought the soldiers in Amuro""s house were Zekes. So that's a fair point. However, I'm pretty sure that Matilda was only supplying them and that her run was incredibly dangerous (at least the first time we see her) as she flies right into an active battle that Garma had said was near one of the defensive lines.   In either case it seems ludicrous that they'd stop for this purpose while trying to get their top secret ship back to Federation territory."
Gundam,33busv,obsessedowl,2,Tue Apr 21 13:32:42 2015 UTC,"Oh her runs were dangerous, yeah, but I mean she wasn't taking nonstop flights from Jaburo strait to Whitebase and back, the federation had an active campaign going in North America with the White-Base being one of many units her supply corps would have been supplying. Remember that the recapture of California base was another major federation victory late in the war, and that didn't come out of nowhere- retaking North America was one of many federation goals, and it's very likely there were in fact many small pockets of federation controlled ground dotted along the white-base's path.  It seems kind of absurd on the surface for the white-base to randomly stop, but considering just how dangerous their trek really was, and assuming that they did in fact stop in a relatively safe pocket of space, it would almost be more absurd not to stop and take a breather if it was possible to do so, simply for the morale boost. Especially if they were waiting for supplies anyway.  At any rate, it made more sense than 'white base needs salt!!!!?'"

To be fair they're trip to get the ship to Federation headquarters was pretty nonsensical considering they somehow go from the eastern coast of North America to Turkey from the rear of the Zeon forces meaning they went through Southeast to East Asia despite that being on opposite side of the planet, meaning they either teleported or circumnavigated the continent they were actually trying to get to."
Gundam,33busv,derpman4k,5,Fri May 1 23:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was put off by comments for Episode 8 of G-Reco -- in which there is a similar scene -- when I feel like past series included ""breaks during combat"" quite frequently (as posted above).  It's actually something I enjoy watching as it feels quite real in it's own way.  I'm sure WWI soldiers played cards in between or during fights as well (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-03/german-soldier-otto-strube-playing-cards-ww1/5700582).  Even though they are taking part in a war, they're still human and would feel the need to take breaks, especially as the war drags on."
Gundam,33busv,Saji-Crossroad,3,Tue Apr 21 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"Came here to post the same thing, though I kinda hesitated because this was between battles in MSG. In G-Reco it was during an actual battle. But it wasn't like they were playing on the beach, it was a re-supply during battle, not unrealistic at all just that the battle was kind of ignored.   I bet if one person said something in regards to it during the re-supply no one would have cared.   But yeah I completely agree  +1d"

Gundam,33db4x,starcolored,2,Tue Apr 21 21:01:28 2015 UTC,"Frontal isn't a Char clone. When Mineva and Banagher confront Frontal in front of the box, Mineva explicitly calls him nothing more than a man made in Char's image. He's just a guy modified to appear to be Char, thoroughly mind-fucked, and instilled with Char's residual grudge from the Sazabi's Psycoframe. This is why a lot of Japanese media like games doesn't even refer to him as a Newtype, such as the Dynasty Warriors Gundam series classifying him a Cyber-Newtype and the G Generation games giving him the abilities of neither. Also, it takes time for a clone to grow up, you don't just pop out at whatever age you were cloned at. That means Char would've had to have been cloned within a few years of his birth for Frontal to be the age that he is, which would be pretty bizarre."
Gundam,33db4x,CaptainJesusNFriends,2,Tue Apr 21 23:27:28 2015 UTC,What would Mineva know about Frontal though?
Gundam,33db4x,starcolored,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:20:14 2015 UTC,"And what would Emma know about the Zeta's Bio-Sensor? Disregarding the fact that as the princess whom Neo Zeon blindly follows she can probably gain access to whatever information within her organization she wants, the plausibility of her having that knowledge is moot. Call it a plot hole or don't, the fact is she knows it. (Also, Frontal never exactly denies it.)  The Japanese Wikipedia article also supports this: その正体は、ジオン残党により意図的にシャアに似せて作り出された人工ニュータイプ（強化人間）であり (tl: his identity is an artificial newtype (enhanced human) intentionally created to resemble char by zeon remnants)"
Gundam,33db4x,CaptainJesusNFriends,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:56:08 2015 UTC,"I guess I can't argue that. Though a clone being grown all speedy like isn't out of the question. I don't think they're ever very literal about what Frontal is. As for the aggression in Sazabi's cockpit, if he isn't reunited with Amuro and Lalah until his death at the end, wouldn't that make what Frontal became all of Char? If it were just his aggression, wouldn't Char's newtype ghost already be with them, in a pure form? That's also giving me another neat thought, if this happened to Char, why not Amuro?"
Gundam,33db4x,starcolored,2,Wed Apr 22 08:27:10 2015 UTC,"As far as clone aging goes, I wouldn't disagree with that if there were some sort of capability for it depicted, but cloning in Gundam is so seldom a thing that it gives the impression that they still have a very rudimentary skill at it.  Char's ghost was already with them. That's why it appeared with Lalah's. Only part of Char remained after the Axis Shock. (Fukui: ""In the last scene of “Char’s Counterattack”, when Char’s soul is dispersed, it’s not strange to think that part of him consented to die peacefully, but another part might have been unable to consent to dying and remained in the world as a kind of grudge."") Amuro didn't die holding a grudge against humanity so most likely there was no part of him feeling conflicted with his main consciousness, but the whole idea is vague and probably not meant to be well understood anyway."
Gundam,33db4x,CaptainJesusNFriends,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:48:32 2015 UTC,I thought it was Amuro and Lalah telling Frontal/Char to come with them.
Gundam,33db4x,starcolored,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:53:56 2015 UTC,"Nah, according to Fukui, what happened was Banagher had appeased Full Frontal (Char's grudge), then Char came (as well as Lalah) to reclaim that part of him. Amuro, if you'll remember, didn't actually speak until after the Neo Zeong had already disintegrated and Char had reclaimed his missing piece.  But, I will say that they could've handled that scene better. The pacing of it tends to make everyone interpret it a little differently."
Gundam,33db4x,CaptainJesusNFriends,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:59:49 2015 UTC,I'm going to need to rewatch that then.
Gundam,33db4x,starcolored,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even I still feel like, based purely on watching the scene as opposed to what the author says is happening, then Banagher does not successfully persuade Frontal and it's actually Char and Lalah which convince him to give up, because there's absolutely no time between when Frontal denies Banagher and the ghosts appear. So it makes it seem like they're the ones who convinced Frontal even though that's not the case."
Gundam,33db4x,Turambar87,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:14:11 2015 UTC,"I figured it was actually Char's body, like they found him dead in the sazabi cockpit.   Then, they reanimated it using cyber-newtype and cloning technology to replace the parts that had died, and get it walking and talking.    Since Char's spirit was gone, it wasn't Char, but it was good enough.  Eventually (during/after ep6 i guess) Char's spirit re-entered his body, probably when it was hooked up to Neo Zeong's huge ass psycommu antenna, and took control to talk to Syam Vist."
Gundam,33db4x,LightningEagle7,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"If Full Frontal wasn't a clone of Char, than why would Char's, Lala's, and Amuro's space ghosts show up when he died....?  EDIT Upon further research, you were correct.  I had no idea he was genetically altered and given his memories... I guess he's a non-genetic clone?"
Gundam,33db4x,starcolored,2,Wed Apr 22 12:23:27 2015 UTC,"If you're still looking for the answer, the author of Unicorn said Char came to retrieve the piece of him that was left behind after CCA and ""put into"" Full Frontal via the Sazabi's Psycoframe.  About clones, as the meaning of the word is a being which is genetically identical to what it came from, I guess you could say a non-genetic clone is something that shares its memories and thinking patterns instead of its genetic makeup. In that sense Full Frontal is close to Char but not identical, as he does not have Char's entire consciousness but only a fragment and forms different ideas about how to go about the Zeon-Federation conflict than Char."
Gundam,33db4x,GospelX,-3,Wed Apr 22 13:17:39 2015 UTC,"Full Frontal was some random ace pilot who was selected to receive plastic surgery to resemble Char and was then brainwashed somehow with the remains of the Sazabi's psychoframe.

He possesses the remnant thoughts of Char (part of his soul)...   Copy of Char is kind of ambiguous, so it could be it's like I say and it could be I'm wrong.

Londo Bell was formed to handle the scattered remnants and quell new uprisings before they could become a major military threat. Going on the previous assumption that cloning is a pricey and often failure-ridden proposition, putting immense resources towards developing an only marginally successful run of pilots when there was no clear need to probably wasn't something the Federation could afford.  Second, I remember a number of comments on how the Federation distrusts Newtypes (particularly how Amuro's low rank in CCA is basically the result of anti-newtype bias) and they may not have wanted to rely on newtype clones. While cloning oldtype aces might be viable, we then go back to the question of cost in comparison to simply recruiting and training more oldtype pilots."
Gundam,33db4x,CrashmanX,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:48:25 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this, but surely it's much much easier and less resource intensive to clone 12 of the same person rather than making a clone of 12 different person. And whenever science project like cloning happens, they always make a batch of them for all kind of experimental purposes, so I am guessing they only got to make one batch of Purus as experiment and Neo Zeon fell before they have enough test result to authorise another batch of clones.  Also, you don't want to have a clone of your leader, can't risk having the clone eventually disagreeing the decision of the original and end up dividing the power. If all you want is soldier, I wouldn't clone another Haman or Char."
Gundam,33db4x,CrashmanX,0,Tue Apr 21 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the ethics was a huge part of it. Just because they could doesn't mean it wasn't frowned upon. Another point being that like /u/corezon mentioned, the Purus turned out great right? Except not. I also don't imagine cloning like that is cheap, nor easy. If they had found a way to implant the clones with the memories of the original successfully (I.E. an actual Char clone and not the failure that was Full Frontal) then I could see cloning taking off like a rocket and Zeon winning easily. However as we saw with Full Frontal memories weren't transferred perfectly and instead of being a clone of Char he became his own person."
Gundam,33db4x,Mayomori,0,Tue Apr 21 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"""ethics was a huge part of it.""   Why, though? Why would it be frowned upon? I don't recall any negative reaction to the Purus offhand that they're inferior because they're clones. It's never brought up again.   I also don't imagine cloning like that is cheap, nor easy.   Yet they made 12 clones of some random Newtype, not their leaders and aces? You could argue the Purus were experiments, sure, but then why make 12 of them, and why not begin with Haman, for example?"
Gundam,33db4x,CrashmanX,0,Tue Apr 21 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"Why, though? Why would it be frowned upon? I don't recall any negative reaction to the Purus offhand that they're inferior because they're clones. It's never brought up again.   Why? Because making clones is a hugely questionable morality thing. Clones are a very grey area because who are we to play god and create life? Are clones considered to be the same as all other humans? Clearly Marida was not treated as such nor were the other Puru clones. While it may not be brought up in the main series, I would imagine in a real world scenario it would be a issue. Much like how not all Nazi's agreed with many of the experiments they performed. Just because they didn't, doesn't mean everyone agreed with it.   Yet they made 12 clones of some random Newtype, not their leaders and aces? You could argue the Purus were experiments, sure, but then why make 12 of them, and why not begin with Haman, for example?   12 of a newtype who was thought to be powerful. If you make 12 of an ace there's no promise that those 12 will come out to be as good as that ace, you could end up with 10 useless fodder and only 2 aces. For the leaders, that's a lot of brainwashing/traning to get them into the same mindset as the original. At best they'd act as body doubles.  Meanwhile you make 12 clones of a newtype. If all 12 turn out to be Newtypes you've learned somethings. One being that newtypes is a genetic thing and isn't something that is developed under circumstances. With 12 newtypes if one turns out to not be an ace, well then you've got a few aces and you have a new newtype to lobotomize and experiment on. There's a lot you can gain by cloning something you don't understand, you can do a LOT more experiments to understand the thing better."
Gundam,33ct8y,KaSplosion,7,Tue Apr 21 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/hXx4R00  That is always a helpful link , and I would always recommend to start with Wing or 00 then slowly get into UC."
Gundam,33ct8y,Secret_turtles2345,3,Tue Apr 21 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"I'm personally not a real big fan of this recommendation, if only because Wing and 00 are not very representative of the franchise as a whole, and I feel like they're very mediocre Gundam shows.

However after watching Wing he was hooked. 00 for whatever reason was just good time's with that first half, second half was lack luster. But I get the idea of them not being good portrayals of Gundam as a whole."
Gundam,33ct8y,Secret_turtles2345,6,Wed Apr 22 07:53:30 2015 UTC,"Noticed people getting downvoted for suggesting you start with 00, so I will back them up.  00 is an excellent place to start IMO. It is in its own universe altogether so you don't feel overwhelmed with being thrown into a UC-based timeline and being confused what happens before/after. Plus the action is great, and the characters I found to be likable.  However as other people you can pretty much start wherever, but from a personal recommendation I actually started with Build Fighters. Didn't have much exposure to the series prior to watching but, like yourself, I was interested in the toys/models/ideas entirely. Glad I started here as it was enough to spark interest."
Gundam,33ct8y,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Wed Apr 22 01:33:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed. i started watching 00 and i like it a lot, but im watching the english dub and a lot of the character seem so stale that it almost bores me. I might put that aside and start with build fighters instead."

Gundam,33ct8y,chrysamere,2,Tue Apr 21 23:31:11 2015 UTC,Depends on how much time you can I invest. You should probably start with 00.
Gundam,33ct8y,WisteriaHysteria,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"Want to know how I started?  0083 --> Char's Counterattack --> G-Gundam  It honestly doesn't matter where you start, just so long as you get into things and become a fan.  Most of these shows and OVAs are self-contained enough that any of them can serve as a good jumping on point.  The UC stuff in general, you'll have a better appreciation for everything if you watch in production order, but most of them include enough recaps and explanations of what's going on that you can jump in anywhere and still follow what's going on in the core-story of that show.  If you're hesitant about the franchise as a whole, go for one of the shorter OVAs that aren't a big time investment.  Most of the OVAs tend to be pretty good (if they're not a sequel to something like Endless Waltz).  If you're dedicated enough dig into the franchise in earnest, go with a longer show."

Gundam 00 isn't bad either but personally I'd start with an older series before moving into newer ones. Also you can watch the original Gundam, it's what started the franchise.  Now being your a fan of the models, Gundam Build Fighter is nice to watch, it's not a serious series like the main Gundam ones and they are all on YouTube.

Gundam,33ct8y,alkonium,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:41:38 2015 UTC,"So basically, Gundam stories are mostly set in different universes.  Universal Century is the 'Main' one, with...  Gundam 0079, 0080 War in the Pocket Zeta Gundam, ZZ Gundam, Char's Counterattack, Unicorn F91, Victory, Reconguista in G (Technically set in the 'Rebuild' Century, but it's the same canon- just way later on.  Then there's Cosmic Era, which is Gundam Seed, Anno Domini with is 00, After Colony which is Gundam X & Future Century, which is G Gundam. All of the different timelines have different Gundams, characters and worlds. Personally, I think UC is best as it's the most 'realistic' and well developed."

Gundam,33brm5,corezon,15,Tue Apr 21 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"I think Garma's place in the story is to show just how far Char is willing to go to have his revenge - Garma was a good friend to Char, a pretty nice guy, loyal, smart. Seemed like a good guy overall. But his last name is Zabi.  Interesting that Char was willing to kill Garma, but not Minerva. What makes those two so different? Did Garma even know that his family killed Zeon Daikum? He would have been just a small boy."
Gundam,33brm5,chrysamere,11,Tue Apr 21 06:02:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting that Char was willing to kill Garma, but not Minerva. What makes those two so different?    Keep in mind that Char grows and changes too, over the course of the series.  If he'd had a chance to off Mineva early on, I get the sense he might have done it.  As you point out; Char has no problem befriending somebody, acknowledging that they're a perfectly alright person, and then leading them into a fatal trap because of the family they're born into.    Later in the series, when Kishiria interviews him, saying that she knows who he is and what he did, he owns up to it immediately and tells her that revenge was a hollow, unsatisfying feeling.  I don't think he's just lying to get in her good graces at this point.  I think he really does regret murdering Garma, and by that point, I don't think he'd have killed Mineva either.  In the end, when he kills Kishiria, it's a bit ambiguous as to why.  His sister has just talked him into ceasing a fight with Amuro, which can be seen as analogous to stopping the futile fighting between the Federation and Zeon at this point.  The outcome of the war is now determined; what's the point in more lost life?  By killing the last living commander of forces, he can end the war, and end the fighting.  Or perhaps they're just showing that even Char's conscience won't get in the way of a grudge when the opportunity presents itself.  Either of these explanations works extremely well with the character who we see to be very conscious of the unjust loss of life moving forward (Zeta), and also unable to let go of petty conflicts (CCA).    TL;DR Char's a complex dude, dude."
Gundam,33brm5,sdwoodchuck,3,Tue Apr 21 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that once every other Zabi was dead Char thought the Infant Mineva would be free of their influence. It's why he's so pissed off Haman is shoving all that ""Hail Zabis"" shit down her throat. Also I don't think Char would personally kill a one year old child, no matter how much he hates the Zabis."
Gundam,33brm5,mixmastermind,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:09:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Char didn't seem to regret killing Garma; he even gloats about it afterwards, to himself, and the only indication he gives of regret (that I remember, at least) is when he's being interviewed by Kycilia.  What's to stop him from lying about regret?  She knows he's responsible for Garma's death, so he can't deny it; she knows he would have reason to harbor a grudge, so he cops to that too.  From Char's perspective, the only way to get close to Kycilia - and thus continue/complete his revenge - is to tell her that, yes, he did kill Garma, but he's turned over a new leaf, you see, he's realized the error of his ways, and he definitely won't pose a threat to Kycilia now."
Gundam,33brm5,DaveThomas6735,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:08:12 2015 UTC,"You could be right; as I said that segment is handled fairly ambiguously in terms of Char's motivations, but we're given plenty of reason to justify that his killing Kishiria is an act of ending the war rather than an act of revenge, and considering that he seems to have dropped his more overtly homicidal tendencies, and his later appearances carry none of that degree of pettiness, it's the view on the matter that makes the most sense to me."
Gundam,33brm5,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"The show isn't ambiguous about his motivations at the end. Char's motivations are explained with the small tidbits of information we get from Sayla, and then Ramba Ral as he calls her ""Princess."" By the end of the original series its quite clear that the Zabis killed his dad and that Char has been getting revenge one Zabi at a time."
Gundam,33brm5,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"It's clear that was his motivation at the time of Garma's death.  It is unclear that his motivation at the end of the series is still in line with that.  The character has absolutely changed by that point of the series. His motivations over all have grown.  He's no longer the angry little boy playing soldier that he was when he led Garma to his death, and he shows absolutely no vengeful leanings in regards to the Zabis at all until the very end.    He also hasn't been ""killing Zabis one at a time.""  He's killed two, total. The first one was obviously an object of revenge.  The second is not so obvious.  Is it possible he regressed back to behaving like a vengeful child at the end?  Sure, it's possible.  He certainly shows he can hold a grudge for petty reasons even after that.  However, immediately before that, we see him convinced to set the conflict aside.  We see him informed of Kishiria's escape, and  More so we see him protective of his sister, and wanting her to get to safety, and his readiness to give his life to see that through (it's clear to Sayla that he expects to die).  At that moment, I'd argue his motivation is more in line with ending a war that has already gone on too long, than it is in petty revenge.  It just doesn't add up with what his character has grown into by the end of the series."

Char even tells Garma this as he's killing him.  ""Blame this on the misfortune of your birth."" I.E. ""If you weren't the son of the man that killed my father we could still be bros.""   Interesting that Char was willing to kill Garma, but not Minerva. What makes those two so different?   Mineva was a baby that hadn't learned to walk yet. Garma on the other hand was heading his father's Earth Invasion Force and had almost 2 decades under his family's thumb to corrupt him. Garma would never go along with betraying his own family no matter how good of friends he may have been with Char and Char knew this so he'd have to get rid of him before continuing on with his plans. Mineva on the other hand was completely innocent and could be raised to see the horrors her family caused in a negative light without their influence over her...  Also - It seems like Garma annoys Char by circumstance: to put it simply Garma is living the life that Char was supposed to be living before Garma's family ruined it for him."
Gundam,33brm5,DenkouNova,2,Tue Apr 21 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"Presumably Char only wanted revenge against Degwin and children.  Killing Mineva wouldn't have saddened Degwin much, it would just have made Char look like a brutal monster.  By the way, I don't remember what happens to Dozle's wife?

What did rub off on Minerva was the strength and willpower to command and stay at the head of a faction. As shown, Minerva always has a prideful and mature attitude towards the conflicts in Unicorn.

Gundam,33c8hj,KuroTheDigger,5,Tue Apr 21 10:14:06 2015 UTC,"It can depend, Build Fighters can be a great primer and and while there are lots of designs it's not really going to spoil anything on its own.  Unicorn on the other hand, while visually appealing and thus easily approachable is the book end to the early Universal Century era and even I it doesn't outright spoil it does have some expectations of the viewer in terms on knowledge.  The original MSG does have its 3 compilation movies which could be a good starting point as it's what kicked this all off and 3 movies are are lot easier to get through than the 40-something episodes if you have a hard time dealing with the older animation."
Gundam,33c8hj,CybranKNight,3,Tue Apr 21 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"IMO.   0080 War in the Pocket - A good snapshot of early UC, animation is gorgeous, a short length of 6 episodes. Deals with a lot of the underlying facets of MSG such as the impact of war on the civilian spacenoids. One of my favorite OVAs of all time. Its a series I'll recommend to people who arent even anime fans. Definitely my highest rated pick.  GBF - Solid pick. Light hearted and not in your face with the ""War is hell"" motif. Just pure mech porn with great character designs, mech designs, and devolpment for story and charcters. It is essentially YuGiOh in Gundam form. (That is NOT a bad thing either, yugioh had plenty of epic/dark/wonderful times.)  Unicorn - An....okay pick. Now a lot of fans will tell you to NOT start with it. But we get a lot more out of Unicorn than the fresh blood. As someone on here described it, it is, ""a giant love letter written to fans of the UC"" Im not saying its a bad place to start, the animation, ost, writing, and everything about it is damn good. As I said the thing is those familiar with the UC get a LOT more out of unicorn than someone who is watching it blind. Doesnt mean you cant revisit it later down the road with a lot of ""Oohhhhh, I get it now.""  G Gundam - Man, this doesnt represent what gundam is really about at all. But its my personal favorite, what I grew up watching on Toonami, and its what hooked me into Gundam years ago. Its cheesy, stupid, fun, and at points dark. lots of twists and turns in the story you wouldnt think were even coming. Personally, one of my favorite parts about G is that Domon loses in the first half....like...a lot. And for a show that is essentially gundam meets dbz meets bad kung fu movie, that is a grwat way to treat your mc.   Gundam 00 - Okay. Honestly havent seen it, been meaning to. Lots of people say good things about it as a starter and Ive seen plenty of newer fans who had gotten hooked by it.   Okay now heres what I recommend you stay away from. Do not go for Reconguista. Even the fanbase that worships Tomino is conflicted about it, thats something you dont want to throw a newcomer into.   Stay away from original trilogy/series untill youve given him a sample of UC. I love 0079, its a classic. But do I think its good for someone who is heavily invested in the newer anime thats out like SAO and AOT? Hell no. It can be jarring, and that is why I personally think Unicorn is a good pick. It has that modern flair to it which is good at assimilating people into the fandom."
Gundam,33c8hj,ConchobarMacNess,3,Tue Apr 21 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"Go big or go home: if your friend can't handle the original three movies, they're probably not going to like a show that deals with the same themes, etc.  Or maybe easy mode?  Something like 00 is shiny, still relatively new, not as sad as some of the shorter stuff but not rainbows and sunshine either."
Gundam,33c8hj,battlegrids,3,Tue Apr 21 10:46:44 2015 UTC,"I would start with a shorter UC series like 08th MS Team or 0083. Both of these are accessible, animation is modern enough, and short enough for a good taste. Another option would be 00. I was christened on Wing like a lot of people, but removing all nostalgic bias I'd pick 00 over Wing now. It has that added relevance to modern times with themes like resource politics and terrorism."
Gundam,33c8hj,laneo333,3,Tue Apr 21 12:12:27 2015 UTC,"I have no bias at all (I'm 15 and french, so the anime never aired in my country, even if it did I wasn't born, and I watched all of UC+CC+AW before Wing) and I'd still pick Wing over 00.  Wing just felt more ""Grounded"" like other UC/AW gundam than 00. Just a personal opinion though."
Gundam,33c8hj,IKill4MySkill,2,Tue Apr 21 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"your opinion is completely valid, even though we differ. Ultimately I say watch both anyways because they are both worth seeing, and plenty faithful enough to the essence of Gundam.   besides...long live Trowa Barton and Heavyarms!!!"

Gundam,33c8hj,Webemperor,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:38:59 2015 UTC,"Someone else has already mentioned it, but I'm going to toss another vote to 0080 War in the Pocket.  It's six, half hour episodes, which is among the most minimal time commitments you can find with Gundam.  It handles the moral ambiguity of war just as well as the full length entries, and arguably more so.  The mecha designs are classic, without being quite the old-fashioned look you find in 0079; it primes a viewer on the basic aesthetic principles of Gundam without falling into the pitfalls of the older animation.  The story builds on the groudwork of the original series without leaning on it, so a newcomer can pick up the relevant bits of the conflict completely within the series itself.  It is also impressively free from some of the more prevalent anime tropes, so someone who might be annoyed by them won't trip over 0080's writing.  Also, it was where I started with Gundam, almost 20 years ago now, so I can attest to its draw."
Gundam,33c8hj,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:31:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I honestly don't thin that Build Fighters/Try is a good first Gundam anime, as you don't really get an idea of what Gundam anime are all about. Given, it does have suits, pilots and characters with emotional moments, yet I feel that the best way to introduce anyone into a new anime franchise is giving them something that can stand alone and still give a good idea of what gundam is about.  Gundam 00 is a good start for any gundam fan, and because of the  distinct characters, nice suit designs and modern animation style, it is the perfect way to start. But that also depends on what your friend is into? Does he like fairytale types of anime with romance and many deaths? Suggest him to wast Gundam Seed, the first 50 episodes, as they are also a good introduction to Gundam. However, if your friend like realistic suits and storylines, 08th Ms Team is the way to go and if you want him to get his mind blown with a solid storyline, awesome suit designs and tons of epic music, let him watch Gundam Unicorn, as it can be watched even without seeing the rest of the UC anime.  It all comes down to what your friend is into, as that's the best way giving him the first anime to watch."

Gundam,33dyks,ConchobarMacNess,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind. When we go dub these things, we have to play along with the lip flaps. There is room for interpretation, but only to what can match.  This is how you get bad/cringe/awesome dubs when someone doesn't take the time to match up syllables. They can insist on a weird cadence and sometimes you have to add filler in there which really dulls what the character is saying.  I'm not saying that's the case with Unicorn. It had a great dub and they developed it in line with the Sub so Sunrise gave the green light all the way through."
Gundam,33dyks,CrashmanX,-3,Tue Apr 21 21:42:35 2015 UTC,"I totally understand why two people in the same army would do this, but in my specific examples, I was talking about Banagher addressing Riddhe or Kamille addressing Char. Banagher and Kamille aren't in the military, and are probably completely unaware of tradition or naming conventions."
Gundam,33dyks,OhUmHmm,5,Tue Apr 21 19:31:18 2015 UTC,It's their title. It's rude to call Patrick Stewart anything but Sir Stewart or similar because he's been knighted by the queen.
Gundam,33dyks,NoctyrneSAGA,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Can't speak to Banagher as I'm still working through Zeta, but Kamille's parents were MS designers, so it's possible he's familiar with naming conventions.  Alternatively, perhaps there were some off-screen ""corrections"" handed out by Cpt. Bright, or else he just mirrored the behavior of the actual officers once onboard.  I don't recall Jirad calling Kamille ""Ensign Kamille"" or Char calling Amuro ""Warrent Officer Amuro"", so I'm not sure about two individuals across different armies."

Gundam,33dyks,CrashmanX,-8,Tue Apr 21 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"Because Forrest still calls him Lt. Dan decades later, even though they are both out of the military, and Dan is a vocal critic of the army and the war. Nobody calls him Lt. Dan anymore, except for Forrest. Yes, it is a sign of respect, but my point is that these characters are still addressed by their rank even in socially awkward positions. Forrests autism prevents him from recognizing why he shouldn't use his rank any longer."
Gundam,33dyks,ConchobarMacNess,9,Tue Apr 21 19:34:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by socially awkward positions. They are in a war and these people are in the military.

Gundam,33dyks,corezon,3,Tue Apr 21 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"That has nothing to do with him being autistic. That's just the way a lot of people address people with titles, even when they don't hold them anymore.  For example, I'm in university and sometimes when I go to talk to a professor I address them as 'Professor' or professor followed by their last name. Its a title, same as a military rank though not as formal. After I graduate if I see them again and I decide to talk to them I'm still probably going to call them Professor. Even if at that time they're no longer a professor, to me I'm going to associate them with the position I first met them and interacted with them in. I mean, I could call them by their name, but its also not a weird thing that I would call a professor Professor."

Gundam,33dyks,CybranKNight,14,Tue Apr 21 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"Number 1, Military. You refer to another by their rank and then name so as to specify them.  Number 2, it's their title. It'd be rude to refer to them as something else. Sorta like Doctor, Sir, or similar.   Number 3, it's how they know the other person. Kinda like a nickname. I have friends whom I refer to by their nickname while everyone else calls them by their real name. Why do I keep referring to them as such? Cause it's their name in my head."
Gundam,33dyks,kuroageha,8,Tue Apr 21 19:40:42 2015 UTC,"In battle, it makes sense.  A military unit is trained to maintain its order while on duty, even in dire circumstances--especially in dire circumstances, because that order and organization is what allows an overwhelmed force to survive.    Outside of moments of military requirement though, it's likely more an expression of Japanese social order.  As much as Gundam eschews Japanese classism for the most part, you have elements of it sneak in (probably unintentionally even, just as part of the writers' ingrained habit), and one of those ways is that people refer to others of higher rank by their rank even in less formal circumstances."
Gundam,33dyks,duelistgamer,3,Tue Apr 21 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused.  If I were in the person's shoes, I would do the same. I am participating in a war/conflict, regardless of my status being civilian or not. If I am piloting a mecha, it makes even more sense to address these individuals as such."
Gundam,33dyks,kuroageha,2,Tue Apr 21 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that as I recall it(it's been a bit since over watched the earlier unicorn episodes) is also how Banagher is introduced to Riddhe, he meets him in a military context. So it's natural that it's how He's know to him.  It's also possible that due to the nature of he subject he was learned at the school that, either as a course or just on his own, he learned some basic military nomenclature, he was certainly learning some military history at least."
Gundam,33dyks,duelistgamer,2,Tue Apr 21 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"Additionally, note that Japanese has no equivalent of 'sir' that we use, instead you have to use the rank instead when addressing someone.

In fact, even on land it was rather mediocre since all it had was a standard Geara Zulu beam machinegun along with the heat claws and heat knife combo. The reason why it was helpful to the remnants arsenal was just its longer operation time and superior armaments."

Without the real threat of large numbers of amphibious MS invading earth there probably just wasn't an easy way to get budget for it.

Although based upon the old MSM-01 Zaku Marine Type created by the Principality of Zeon, this suit is an improved version created by the Earth Federation Forces. Ironically, the EFF was never able to use these suits as they were captured by the Neo Zeon forces during the First Neo Zeon War, when their forces invaded Earth in UC 0088. In UC 0096, at least two of these suits were used by Zeon remnants to attack the Federation's Torrington Base. Two of these units would later be destroyed by the RX-160S Byarlant Custom.

Gundam,3394cr,taarec10,16,Mon Apr 20 17:10:10 2015 UTC,"I can't answer for the people complaining about the Wing suits; my complaints about a Gundam series rarely involve the technology involved, since it's all fairly absurd and I love absurd tech.    That said, there is a pretty big contextual difference between the suits in Wing and the Turn A.  The suits in Wing were made to be battlefield fighters.  They are built among the suits of their own time, and somehow exceed them by enormous orders of magnitude.  Like I said, I'm cool with that, so I'm not even saying that's a negative.  Just worth pointing out.   By comparison, the Turn A is essentially a doomsday weapon.  It isn't built of the stuff of its in-series contemporaries; indeed, its in-series contemporaries are almost all long lost suits from ages past.  The Turn A is weapon of a bygone era, the peak of technological advancement beyond what the series characters can fathom, and made for the purpose of eliminating technology.  It is essentially the equivalent of an anti-technology nuke, made to destroy indiscriminately, not a suit that is made to vastly outclass its contemporaries in conventional warfare."
Gundam,3394cr,sdwoodchuck,4,Mon Apr 20 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"Technically, the only reason the Gundams in Wing are so much stronger than the average suit is because the production version of the Tallgeese, the Leo, was scaled down and reduced in power because no one could pilot it at the time it was produced. They also use more common, and thus cheaper, armor materials instead of Gundanium, which is more rare and not feasible for use on mass-produced suits. Essentially, the Gundams in Wing are only stronger because the mass-produced models they fight against are weaker by design.  This makes the Wing suits not too dis-similar from the Turn A really. And while I've never heard these complaints myself, I can't help but think that anyone doing so is either unaware of the plot given reasons, or is ignoring them for some reason. Though mostly it's probably because Wing is a fan favorite, which tends to draw that much more visceral hatred for it from others, irrational as it may be."
Gundam,3394cr,MisterPuck,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:21:38 2015 UTC,"You say that but the difference is still staggering to the point that even the ""comparable"" non mass produced MS like the Virgos and even Mercurius and Vayeate were just ruined by the Gundams. The biggest problems I have with the Gundam though are this: the incredibly fucking ridiculous powerplant that the Zero had to have for that gun, shooting off more than one shot per battle (that is pure OP horse shit) and I have problems with how Heavyarms carried its ammo and paid for it after every battle without completely bankrupting the Barton foundation. Another series I have a problem with is SEED for a lot of the same reasons. The beam spam isn't feasible."
Gundam,3394cr,baconbitarded,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:12:03 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the beam spam in SEED is completely feasible. If you look at the Buster, its ONLY function is to fire it's single gun. The entire suit is designed to pump all energy into a single shot. With the Freedom, you're dealing with a suit that now has a limitless nuclear power supply. Given that N-Jammer Canceller (I know, I know... just typing that made me laugh at how ridiculous the naming convention is) tech was present for the Freedom and Justice, it also wouldn't be too far of a stretch to think that the METEOR units were equipped with them as well."
Gundam,3394cr,corezon,10,Wed Apr 22 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"I had a feeling that OP has not seen Turn A. If you haven't watched it then do it already and you won't be asking this kind of question anymore.  Nobody complained the gundam for being to strong in Wing, people complain how they are absurdly strong only when they needed to be."
Gundam,3394cr,BoyGodz,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:13:31 2015 UTC,"I've watched it and I know the Turn A wasn't even close to 100%. But I'm questioning the bias for Wing Suits when it comes to people using the reasoning that the Wing suit capabilities's aren't ""grounded in reality"" and criticize the series while those same others praise Turn A yet do not have a problem with a MS having enough nanomachines to stretch from the Earth to Jupiter without any explanation."
Gundam,3394cr,BoyGodz,5,Mon Apr 20 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"Instead of saying people criticise based on a series ""not grounded in reality"" I think it is more appropriate to say it is ""not true to its setting"". All gundam are fiction and almost all of them involved fictional technology to justify itself, but not all series stay true to those setting or rules, in the case of wing, power level of gundam varies as the plot requires, sometimes they can be defeated with one method but next time they faced the same problem the gundam just tanks through it, instead of addressing the inconsistency they just reasoned it with ""gundams are op"" excuse, which is made more and more apparent as the series goes on.  Turn A doesn't have that problem because 1. They hardly show what Turn A is capable in the anime, 2. There is hardly any fight where it is suppose to pose much of a challenge to Turn A, and 3. The Turn A hardly fight seriously at all. It is hard to call anything OP without seeing much of a fight."
Gundam,3394cr,KronusX7,2,Mon Apr 20 19:31:50 2015 UTC,Well the Turn A is supposed to be OP  Why argue against what it's made to be??
Gundam,3394cr,Qwiser,2,Tue Apr 21 05:10:09 2015 UTC,Have you read about the Turn A? I feel it got a better collection of excuses then the Wing suits.
Gundam,3394cr,Mayomori,-5,Mon Apr 20 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"I have read some background info, but the origin of the Turn A and X are not complete imo. At least with the Wing suits, they explicitly tell that Gundanium armor  and its unique ""space forging"" allows those Gundams to tank enemy attacks."
Gundam,3394cr,Amuro_Ray,9,Mon Apr 20 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"""Tank enemy attack"", when the plot call for it. The fact that the Wing Gundam was shot down on its first episode by a mere jet was absurd when it can tank multiple MSs later on."
Gundam,3394cr,Amuro_Ray,2,Mon Apr 20 18:04:28 2015 UTC,Turn A is a bit of a mysterious suit from a future lost. It has a bit of an excuse since it was built when it may not have been outside of what was possible.  Wing Gundam was a bit too out there compared to other suits. Made from a (light?) near indestructible metal with a small (no?) radar signature and combat capabilities far higher than any mass production suit kinda made them massively overpowered.  I can't think of any Gundam show where the grunts were as outclassed as a leo vs Wing Gundam. X kinda comes close though I guess.
Gundam,3394cr,AkiZayoi,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"The Leo was an old suit. The newer mass produced MS such as the Taurus, Virgos, and the Serpents were not slouches at their introduction."
Gundam,3394cr,KaziArmada,3,Mon Apr 20 17:27:27 2015 UTC,The Taurus were weren't really a match for any of the gundams with space capabilities. Even the non space capable suits shrugged off a ludicrous amount of damage
Gundam,3394cr,starcolored,0,Mon Apr 20 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"While entertaining, and to be honest necessary, I still can't help but find the Turn X and Turn A's technology being based on unknown, likely extraterrestrial science, lazy from a story perspective. Though a lot of Turn A can be seen as Tomino creating a fantastical side universe without as much need for logic as every other universe in Gundam (barring G, for obvious reasons). Though this can present many issues in regards to scaling the two main Correct Century Mobile Suits abilities. Especially considering the novelization gave extra details not in the anime, which also makes them non canon to the anime, much like Amuro and Kamille's novel deaths.  These details include the fairly liked ability of the Turn A to teleport beams into cockpits, which in the anime it simply never showed the ability to do. Though it really doesn't matter, I mean, the Turn A didn't need the extra boost of that skill to be top tier among mobile suits anyway, whether it is bashed or loved based on its design."
Gundam,3394cr,Greytalon,2,Mon Apr 20 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"Consider the fact that we don't know entirelly what the Turn units could do, but then stop looking at them as a Mecha series.  Consider them the man-made end to a Cthulhu-ish horror story, weapons that could wipe the solar system of life with the snap of a fingers. They're not weapons on par with their peers...they're basically gods in metal form."
Gundam,3394cr,baconbitarded,2,Mon Apr 20 23:40:26 2015 UTC,"The Turns aren't based on extraterrestrial science, they're human creations. The Turn X came from the civilization of people who left the Earth. Since the Earth civilization was able to reverse engineer its technology, it's not that its science is unknown, only that nobody by the time of the series is able to understand it since civilization has regressed so much. Rather than being lazy, the gap between the Earth civilization and the Turn technology fits in thematically with the rest of Turn A's story; people who left the Earth were able to progress more rapidly by not being absorbed in the Earth civilization's need for constant warfare, so much so that it drove the Earth to paranoia, then given the same chance at prosperity the Earth merely wiped itself out."

It's just that while it is perfectly free to ridicule the science of it, a lot of fans really focus on the story, characters, or designs of Turn A Gundam rather than its science."

It has a different ""feel."" For example, the way our new crew are already trained soldiers by the first episode, instead of civilians slowly sucked deeper and deeper into the war, like most Gundam series. It's refreshing.  This might be because Neo's identity was spoiled to me before I ""forgot"" it a year or so ago, but it seems pretty obvious who he is. Especially if you look closely at the credits. I imagine it's not exactly supposed to be a surprise. He's got a cooler mask than Rau's, at least, and my judgement of the character depends of how his motivations are explained. Rau was great, and it was fun to see him go from calm badass to slasher-movie-psychopath, but his backstory and motivations kind of ruined it for me. I'm more interested in this new Chairman guy with Char's voice. He seems connected to this ever-growing Le Creuset family, but different."

From what I heard, Fukuda and his wife had plans all along to make Kira the main protagonist again and let Shinn be the big bad villain, a lot of people weren't happy because the VA for Shinn is already receiving death threats for destroying Freedom. Cagali's VA is a friend of Shinn's so she spoke up for him and that's how she got into an argument with the director and never be involved with the production again."

Then you get him saying that the Shinn from SRW Z is ""the true Shinn in my heart."" Then we have how SEED's last stretch got rewritten due to the show's popularity. Flay didn't pilot the Strike Rouge or have a bomb put in her. Kira didn't die. Athrun isn't a cripple.  I seriously doubt that what we got was what was originally intended. I just do. Fukuda's ""I wanted to make a character who loses everything,"" I get the feeling that's him doing damage control after he and his wife acted like rockstars and alienated cast, crew and possibly a part of the Japanese fanbase."

Seed on its own is solid, Destiny however has quite many flaws, but can still be an enjoyable watch."

Gundam,336igx,nanobozz,6,Mon Apr 20 00:25:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly though, it's kind of hard to say. We have Kamille, who was implied to be a better pilot for Zeta than Amuro, but who hates war, is kind of unstable, and may be kind of mentally incapacitated. There's Judah, who may be the strongest newtype ever but hates fighting so much he went to Jupiter. We saw how well that turned out for Scirocco. Amuro is pretty well balanced by CCA but even he had issues with the v gundam (that probably would have been worked out over a longer period of time). He probably would have been ok. But more so than any other Gundam I think Banagher was the perfect fit for the Unicorn. He's not mentally unstable but isn't a war monger. He seems to get the best out of it. In other series I would think things like what if Amuro piloted the Zeta or if Kamille got his hands on the ZZ. But I never really thought of any other pilot for the Unicorn.      To me a more interesting question is what could a strong newtype do in the F91. Seabook is supposed to be a weak newtype at best. Dat power to weight and thrust to weight ratios in the hands of a powerful newtype would be something to see"
Gundam,336igx,iceman_in_black,3,Mon Apr 20 01:37:42 2015 UTC,"On this note, how does Lalah Sune stack up compared to other UC newtypes? Certainly she was one of the most successful early ones, but how does she compare in terms of absolute skill and power?"
Gundam,336igx,Zonetr00per,8,Mon Apr 20 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"I suspect Lalah was the strongest newtype, or at the very least had the greatest potential.  She had the mental connection stuff going on before anybody else, and she managed to continue this beyond death; at the time of her death she has managed to become atemporal (she specifically says that she can ""see time""); she was controlling bits before anyone else had the experience to train her in that capacity and before the tech was perfected; and she was giving whole fleets headaches on the battlefield just by being in the region.  Other Newtypes show one or more of these traits, but as far as I know she's the only one that shows all of them, all while being remarkably stable (if a little kooky), and completely in control of her emotions.  And let's not overlook something:  it's no small feat that she could casually, confidently, and correctly predict the weather.  Compare this to most Newtypes, whose precognitive abilities seem to boil down to ""heads up,"" hers were so fine tuned that she knew specifically how the weather was changing, some time in advance."
Gundam,336igx,sdwoodchuck,3,Mon Apr 20 03:13:48 2015 UTC,": it's no small feat that she could casually, confidently, and correctly predict the weather.    Did she?  I don't think it counts in a colony. I do agree about her being one of or the strongest newtype."
Gundam,336igx,Amuro_Ray,3,Mon Apr 20 05:07:55 2015 UTC,There are some series that say the weather in colonies is regularly scheduled. It kind of feels like predicting the 11 o'clock news will be on at 11 o'clock or predicting the starting lineup by reading the sheet the coach or manager turned in.
Gundam,336igx,iceman_in_black,2,Mon Apr 20 05:21:41 2015 UTC,The scene where she predicts the weather in a colony was clearly there to show her abilities; it's not like she just looked at the schedule and decided to play a trick on Amuro.
Gundam,336igx,sdwoodchuck,2,Mon Apr 20 05:31:24 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good question. Yeah she was in the Flanagan institute but I don't know of anything that says she was artificially enhanced in any way. She seems mentally stable. And she seems to clearly be one of the strongest newtypes ever as 1) she and Amuro connected so deeply and quickly and 2) she consistently has the ability to communicate with others even after she dies. You can teach piloting skills (and newtypes seem to pick up almost anything faster than oldtypes anyway). She's not really mentioned with the strong newtypes, and that may be partially due to a) her peaceful nature since she's never really seen or remembered as a pilot and b) her career was brief at best. But looking at it she has to be up there with Judah as far as potential to be the most powerful newtype. That's probably why she has such a large role in the conflict between Char and Amuro even years after her death (which again played into the connection between her and Amuro and not to mention the whole Amuro accidentally killing her thing making stuff bad between them)"
Gundam,336igx,iceman_in_black,2,Mon Apr 20 02:13:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to pilot it. After watching Seabook fly it. I would end up cooking myself in the suit.

Gundam,336igx,ZeonTwoSix,6,Mon Apr 20 03:12:16 2015 UTC,"Let's see  Banagher Links has the バナージ・リンクス ACE ability which PPx1.2 when Unicorn Gundam is in Destroy Mode.  Which is great for leveling and stat boosting but not very combat oriented so it ain't hard to go above and beyond him when choosing a alternate    For map clear Marida seems like a good candidate at first glance  Marida Cruz マリーダ・クルス    At 130 will, the ""Focus"" Spirit Command auto casts on the player phase, it saves a lot of SP but if you play on casual, and do your upgrades as you should you rarely have to cast ""focus"" outside of boss battles, and even that is due to lack of lvling and proper pilot skilling, also unfortunately as an Enhance Human she can't use Newtype skill which means she can't actually use the Unicorn's attacks    Kamille is great candidate, since he has Newtype skill  Kamille Bidan   カミーユ・ビダン    Counterattack damage x1.2, Critical Rate +20%  Make him a dodge tank and throw him into enemies would work and watch him wreck havoc    but to fully utilize the Gundam you need more +Newtype skill which Char , Four and Haman can offer not to mention Char's + 20 skill from ACE makes him a absolute killer on the map  Char Aznable    シャア・アズナブル +1 to Newtype skill, Skill +20    Amuro get's the +20 but he gets Newtype range, while Char has +Newtype skill, big difference in damage out put.  Amuro Ray   アムロ・レイ  Newtype weapons range +1, Skill +20    Shinn and Kira both get better SEEDs which modifies evasion and will but doesn't have anything that directly impact damage output so that rates them lowly, and SEED isn't +Newtype    However Lockon does have DPS boosting skills  Lockon Stratos  ロックオン ストラトス Critical Rate +20%, All Attack damage x1.1  it makes him a decent candidate, yet no +Newtype    But then if you are going with the full Hot Blood + Sure Strike with max stats after multiple play throughs then  Trowa Barton    トロワ・バートン    ALL Attack damage x1.2  has a direct damage modifier. but you know, no +Newtype    Char's Newtype+ is the best in almost all cases but if you really pimped the fuck out of your Unicorn and all your pilots have 400 to all stats and S in all terrain then Trowa/Lockon is your guy  The problem with Lock on is that while Unicorn's more effective weapons are ranged the strongest attack dubbed the ""gonad ripper"" is a melee attack which uses attributes that you usually don't put on Lockon, but then again you don't have much use for melee stats on Char either.....actually most retro gundam pilots are pretty ranged stat heavy. If we are talking natural stat distribution then you would actually go with someone like Kamille or maybe Shinn, except Shinn's SEED does jack shit when Unicorn needs +Newtype to use its more powerful attacks    But if you really want to fuck with people I'd just say Wufei is the best cuz  Wufei Chang 張五飛   At 130 Will auto cast Invincible at the beginning of your turn  G-fucking G but the downfall is that Wufei has jackshit for Newtype+, actually fuck none of the Wingboys have a single fucking point in Newtype+ making them fucken useless in Unicorn    In the end Char is the best. +Newtype and Gundams just match up so well, it's hard to use other Gundam world pilots because SEED/Innovator isn't Newtype and without +Newtype u basically can do jack shit in the Unicorn. And not having Newtype means no Awakened Unicorn means no gonad ripper, means your Unicorn is fucken useless, well not useless cuz Beam Magnum will still fuck shit up but very suboptimal when you are locked out of Awaken  So yeah Char is best"

Gundam,336igx,Blasterion,4,Mon Apr 20 11:44:21 2015 UTC,"In term of potential I'd say Kamille > Banagher > Judau.  Reason why Judau in ZZ is stronger than Zeta Kamille is because Kamille awakened Judau's potential which allowed him to grow a lot faster as a newtype and to be pretty powerful from the start.  Kamille had a higher potential than anyone else but couldn't achieve it.  Now I'm not convinced he would've been more OP than Banagher at piloting the Unicorn, mostly because Banagher know how to deal with his feelings and it only got to his head once it was when Daguza die.  Kamille on the other hand cannot control himself, he's too emotional and wouldn't been able to resist the NTD.  So yea the Unicorn could be more powerful with Kamille, but he wouldn't be able to control it at all, he'd just be a part of the MS, a weapon with no will."

Gundam,3334td,Rook-walnut,162,Sun Apr 19 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"Well, taking the average size of a space colony to be 6.4 kilometers in diameter, and around 36 in length, that gives us:  pi * 3.22 * 36 = 1158.117 cubic kilometers of area.   Now, all of that isn't actually solid, so we need to know the thickness of the colony walls.  Since the space colony glass seems to line up with the ground section, we can assume that they are the same thickness. Based on two scenes from Build Fighters Try (episode 3 and episode 24) and the one from Seed Destiny where a hole is made in the outside of a PLANT, and several suits fly through it, it can be estimated that the thickness of a colony wall is around 2-3 gundams, or around 50 meters. Since the endcaps of a colony are usually unique based on the colony, it is a bit harder to determine, but since they usually appear to be flat on the inside, but rounded on the outside, they are likely hemispheres with the radius of the colony.   This complicates our equations slightly. Assuming two solid hemispheres (Not accurate, but close enough) on the ends of the colony, and the sphere formula 4/3 pi r3:  The Endcaps:  4/3 * pi * 3.23 = 137.26 cubic kilometers.  The Cylindrical portion, minus the 6.4 kilometers of length taken up by the spheres and accounting for the hollow center of the colony:   ( pi 3.22 - pi 3.152 ) * (36 - 6.4) = 29.52 cubic kilometers of colony wall.   This is significantly less than a solid colony. Adding these two values together gives us the total volume of the solid part of the colony:   166.78 cubic kilometers of colony.  So, assuming the colony wall to be made of steel in a fashion similar to that of a submarine, based on episode 3 of Try Fighters, we can guess that the colony walls are around 50% metal, the rest being utility or transport. Given the density of steel, at 8,050 kg/m3 , this equates to:  166.78 km3 = 166,780,000,000 meters cubed.  166,780,000,000/2= 83,390,000,000   83,390,000,000 m3 * 8050 kg/m3 = 6.713 * 1014 kilograms of colony.  So, now we have the weight of our object, as well as the size of the part that hits the ground. Now we need velocity. We can easily find the terminal velocity (the fastest speed an object can fall in gravity while being resisted by air) by converting the colony into a sphere, effectively removing the center area. A sphere with radius 3.2 km and weighing 6.713 * 1014 kg would have a density of:  3.2 * 1000 = 3,200 m radius  4/3 * pi * 3200 ^ 3 = 137,258,000,000 cubic meters.  Since density is usually calculated in kg/m3, the density of our now-spherical colony is:  6.713 * 1014 kg  / 137,258,000,000 m3 = 4890.79 kg/m3 .   The velocity of the colony is unspecified in any material I could find. In space, things don't really slow down, since there's no air. All thrust becomes acceleration, and the colony extends further than most of the atmosphere, the bulk of which is below 16 kilometers. Therefore, you could really choose any value for the speed of the colony. Therefore, we will assume that the colony is traveling at the maximum speed allowed in the generator, or 72 kilometers per second.  So, our final calculations, simplified for the generator, are:  A spherical mass with radius 3.2 kilometers, weighing 671,300,000,000,000 kg, and traveling at 72 km/s, impacting at 45 degrees to the ground.  Now, plug those values into any impact simulator on the web. The one I used was Impact: Earth, from Purdue university.   Now, we'll do some values based on different distances from the impact point:  10 km away: We're inside the crater, which is 183 km wide and 1.42 km deep.  200 km away: We're still inside the fireball, which appears to be 270 times the size of the sun. Everything is burning. The shockwave reaches us 40 seconds after impact, and it feels like a magnitude 10.4 earthquake. The compressed air blows away nearly everything.  1000 km away: A couple of buildings will be damaged by the seismic waves, and debris from the crater is still going to fall in our area. The fireball will still be visible, and will be about 40 times the size of the sun. For about an hour after the impact, we're pretty scared, until about 50 minutes in, when the airblast hits us, and destroys our house, and likely us.  5000 km away: We're going to be pretty good. The fireball is below the horizon, and the airblast will no longer do more than shatter windows. The earthquake will cause some disturbance, and will cause cars to rock and some windows to break. However, we are not dead, most likely, which I call a win.  Also, as a final note, the impact of the colony, depending on which way it's going, could change the length of our day by up to 2.67 milliseconds.  Thanks for making it all the way down my wall of text, and I hope this answers your question."

Gundam,3334td,Karmic782,2,Sun Apr 19 10:57:42 2015 UTC,"So there were multiple colony drops in the early U.C.: Operation British, Operation Stardust, and Dublin. My understanding as to why Operation British was so devastating was that the colony exploded on impact. The Dublin drop just crashed into earth (and I think Operation Stardust as well but I don't have any good sources for that). Are these numbers the kind we would expect to see from a Dublin event as opposed to Operation British?"
Gundam,3334td,iceman_in_black,3,Sun Apr 19 11:05:03 2015 UTC,The on-screen effects of colony drops have been very inconsistent throughout the UC.
Gundam,3334td,DLGroover2,2,Sun Apr 19 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"True. But, if we're doing the math, I would expect a colony that dropped onto earth and exploded (because, lets say its nuclear reactor or thrusters exploded) to cause more damage than one that just crashed into earth. Yeah there would be a big boom either way, but Tomino tried to be fairly accurate with the science. I would think there would be multiple reasons behind making the distinction of the Operation British colony exploding and not the Dublin colony."
Gundam,3334td,iceman_in_black,6,Sun Apr 19 16:12:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the energy from a few nuclear explosions would be at least one order of magnitude less than the re-entry energy of a colony. The reason we see an explosion during the Sydney drop is because that sort of release of energy would just do that.  Also, let's remember that Tomino wasn't directly involved with ZZ, and that ZZ is shit.    I don't see any way the colony dropped on Dublin could have stayed relatively intact the way it did. It's completely ridiculous.    Edit: BRB, gonna compare math above to the Boom Table: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/usefultables.php    EditEdit: I felt that 72km's was a bit fast on the impact speed, so I halved it. It doesn't materially change the comparison, though.    The energy of the colony, before re-entry, at 36km/s is 1.68x108 megatons. ALL of that energy is going to be shed in some way.  The largest real world nuclear explosion ever generated by mankind to date is the Tsar Bomba, which is estimated at about 50 megatons. We do have reason to believe that UC nuclear payload yields are capable of much more than we are today (see: GP-02), so let's square the output of the Tsar Bomba (502 = 2500mt)... And screw it, let's make it ten of them. Now we've got 2500 * 10 = 25000mt    168,000,000mt = 1.68*108 mt in standard  versus    000,025,000mt of Tsar Bomba squared times ten.  They're not even in the same neighborhood, and that's with a reduced entry velocity.    Also, if you like Joules, the Boom Table has that, too, and the Impact Earth calculator has that output as well."
Gundam,3334td,DLGroover2,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:15:57 2015 UTC,I agree that nukes would be less than a colony as far as the magnitude. What I'm saying or really asking is wouldn't a colony drop that exploded (because some reactors or boosters went crazy or iunno someone stuck a bunch of bombs in it) create a larger explosion than one that didn't? (Ignoring the questionable but still likeable writing of ZZ or 0083 cause any thing as big as a colony will probably go boom)
Gundam,3334td,iceman_in_black,2,Sun Apr 19 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Would it make it go boom bigger? In an absolue sense, yes, it would. The point I'm attempting to illustrate is that it wouldn't make it meaningfully bigger. Kind of a drop in the bucket.    Now, if you start thinking about long-term effects of adding nuclear material, you start to get some dramatic differences. You don't just have to contend with things like ejecta mass and shockwaves and dust clouds, now you get widespread nuclear fallout contaminating a huge area due to the force of the blast blowing it laterally, and vertically into the atmosphere where it can get picked up by high altitude winds.    But... Zeon's objective with Operation British wasn't to mess up Earth. I mean, it was going to happen as a side effect, but their main goal was to take out Jaburo. So it would have been a moot point to throw a bunch of valuable nuclear fuel into the colony."
Gundam,3334td,DLGroover2,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"Your edit answered my next question. Nuclear weapons had always confused me in the Gundam universe. We have things like Operation Crossroads where being a little off target meant ships were still afloat. But in 0083 Gato takes out 2/3rds of the Federation's fleet with one warhead. That's a huge difference that I don't think was ever really explained beyond ""we used nukes, we killed a lot of people, let's ban them"". I guess it only makes sense to have distant future nukes be way more powerful. The scale is just hard to wrap your head around. The solar array and Gryps lasers were able to wipe out fleets essentially like one nuke. With Gryps being a colony I guess I kind of equated it's power to be closer to a colony drop. Dropping a colony is just much more massive even if you make Gundam nukes ridiculously powered."
Gundam,3334td,iceman_in_black,2,Sun Apr 19 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"I'll respond in order:    First, the Operation Stardust nuke didn't actually destroy 2/3 of the fleet. It did outright destroy, I think, a bit less than 1/3. Unfortunately, it incapacitated about another 1/3 (from moderately to critically, but the point is they weren't immediately fit to fight) of the ships and damaged a large portion of Konpeito. Most of the remaining ships in the area were then tasked with recovery, rescue, damage control, and repair duties.     Since the ships were bunched up, and so close to Konpeito, the nuke itself didn't have to directly strike a ship to damage it. Generate enough debris moving at a significant speed, and you've essentially got a big 360 degree shotgun.    For a time-sensitive op like Stardust, they just had to take enough of the fleet out of the fight for just long enough.    Second, the Antarctic Treaty covered more than just nuclear weapons. Its provisions include:     The use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons is prohibited Dropping space colonies or large asteroids onto Earth is prohibited All prisoners of war must be treated humanely All neutral territories must be respected and combat operations in these regions are prohibited. The neutrality of Side 6 is recognized and respected.   So, while UC nuclear weapons are indeed higher yield than our current technology, there were a lot of factors involved. The Federation had no viable defense against colony drops, and both sides learned the hard way that colonies, being relatively fragile, were highly susceptible to nuke strikes. Zeon, being a colonial nation, felt it was in their best interest to keep the federation from using its positively massive nuclear arsenal to just blow Side 3 out of orbit.    Read more here: http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty    Third, you can't easily draw a comparison between the potential output of a colony scale weapon and the potential energy release of de-orbiting a colony into Earth. Just like the colony drop vs nuke scenario, it's apples and oranges, both in scale, and in applied principles.     Think about how massive a colony is. I mean literally think about how much mass it has. A space colony is so big that capital ships can hide inside them (See: F91). Now take that mass and move it at 1 kilometer per second. That's its mean orbital velocity when it's just chillin' at L3, L4 or L5 (remember that Side # =/= Lagrange point #). Now if you de-orbit it, it's going to briefly lose orbital velocity, but it's going to begin falling towards earth, picking up momentum the whole way. It's an obscene amount of energy.  Meanwhile, a colony laser is just using generators and solar cells to charge and release energy. It's a LOT of energy, to be sure, but it's not colony-drop level energy.    To most clearly illustrate my point, refer to Operation Stardust. While the Solar System II didn't operate for quite as long as it needed to, it still wouldn't have been enough to completely change the trajectory of the colony. If a Solar System array had an equivalent amount of energy output as a colony drop, it would have been able to completely cancel out the incoming energy of the colony and stop or destroy it outright.     Is Gryps II's output closer to that of a colony drop than a nuke? Yeah, probably. But they're still worlds apart."

Gundam,3334td,faikwansuen,5,Sun Apr 19 07:10:08 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that certain areas the White Base travels through look like desert, when they shouldn't. For example, Garma was stationed in New York City, wasn't he? And the terrain in which he faces the White Base seems suitably post-apocalyptic. Of course a lot of that might be from battle, but I like to think that it was the drop in Australia that caused so much of North America to look like a desert.  Also, I think that human civilization in the Universal Century has a better ability to rejuvenate the Earth than we do today. Here's a line from Bright in ZZ, Episode 33, as the Argama crosses the Mediterranean into the European coast and sees a forest:   But the jungle [maybe ""forest"" would be a better translation, I hear 森, mori] you see wasn't created by nature. [...] These European jungles were artificially created by people in the last century. [...] That's right, humanity needed things like this. Life was like the Sahara and tons of people needed this environment.   I never heard anything like this mentioned in any other series. We see European forests throughout the first third of Victory Gundam, and there doesn't seem to be anything particularly unnatural about them.  However, something similar to the artificial forest is the Astaroth bioweapon from one of the Side Story 0079 video games. I've never played the game, I just came across this on the Wiki. But apparently it's a virus engineered by Zeon that causes plants to grow at an accelerated rate, until an ""uninhabitable forest"" covers the Earth. Which seems like a terrible strategy, since Zeon already wiped out so much plant life with the war. Accelerated growth of plant life is just what the Federation needs! Maybe my headcannon is that the Federation reverse-engineered Astaroth into a more controllable version, so that they could regrow the regions of Earth deforested by the One Year War."
Gundam,3334td,Terminimal,5,Sun Apr 19 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"There is more desert than there should be in Gundam.

This is implied to be general environmental neglect and not a direct result of the colony drop though."

Contextually this makes a lot of sense combined with another comment up in the thread, that mentions that colonies have much less mass than a solid space rock would. Instead of it being so devastating that New York is turned into a sandy wasteland, the much closer West Coast would've been affected worse, with climate shifts that allowed the Mojave to spread westward."

He didn't want Uso to fall into the cockpit in the first episode. He wanted to build toward the acquisition of the V Gundam. So the episode order was changed around so that we could start with the V Gundam piloted by Uso in the beginning...and then we were shown how he got it. This is probably one of the big reasons why Tomino made the series so destructive."

Gundam,3340mi,iceman_in_black,2,Sun Apr 19 13:29:34 2015 UTC,One other thing I noticed is they used the same gun sound as the leos machines guns in Wing.
Gundam,3340mi,Amuro_Ray,3,Sun Apr 19 13:31:52 2015 UTC,There are actually a lot of recycled sounds in the Gundam Universes. I know the newtype premonition sound shows up in other series (and in other media as well). A lot of the gun sounds are repeated like you mentioned. Victory came before Wing which makes it harder to tell if it was an homage or a convenient stock sound.
Gundam,3340mi,iceman_in_black,3,Sun Apr 19 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"I would lean towards convenience, to me it doesn't have the same meaning as the newtype flash"
Gundam,3340mi,Amuro_Ray,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. But I also think on some level they go for a consistency between the series. The lasers sounds are the same. All the Gundams (ok most, I'm looking at you Ez8) have the v-fins. Its convenient but it also helps to tie everything Gundam together."
Gundam,3340mi,iceman_in_black,2,Sun Apr 19 16:48:42 2015 UTC,Wing and victory were the only two shows I've seen the sound used in a lot.
Gundam,3340mi,Amuro_Ray,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:34:22 2015 UTC,But Victory comes first... Shouldn't it be the other way round and actually Leos in Wing use the same sound effects as Victory?

Your opinion or my opinion on the effectiveness of the style doesn't really matter here, even if we liked that style, it wasn't the intended effect, nor can we fault Tomino for going with such a horrible style if we hated it."

He was already depressed during Zeta Gundam and CCA and he became somewhat suicidal during V Gundam even then Bandai forced him to work in these conditions, and also forced him to change a lot of parts in the storyline to make the show more marketable, like changing when V Gundam appears and such. After the show was done Tomino did all he could to make sure Victory Gundam would be a marketing and financial failure and hoped this failure would kill the franchise. Even though he failed to kill Gundam as a franchise, he was successful at making V Gundam a financial failure, by making it one of the least selling Gundam shows to date."

The whole point of Selene and Sven's short relationship was to illustrate that be it Natural or Coordinator, they were both human. Their situation eliminated the shackles of war born hatred and instead showed the perpetual human desire to survive. Whether they lived or died was not as important as their mutual understanding. However (and don't quote me on this) I believe I've read that there was a manga version of Stargazer that showed Sven and Selene alive post Stargazer. I'm not sure if the manga is canon (as it's not animated) but I myself prefer the ending where we simply don't know their fates. They either just made it, or were too late. And I find that to be a truly beautiful ending.  Edit:Spelling ;)"

You are told that to live in ORB, you have to accept it's ways. What makes this terrifying is that the citizens hold no power in ORB. It's not a constitutional monarchy, wherein the power lies with the elected assembly and the nobles can't dictate policy. ORB is a union of principalities or it's full name in Japanese, United Emirates of ORB. An Emirate IRL is a region ruled by an Emir, a dynastic Islamic monarch.  Then it even takes on another sad turn when you consider they may not even have religious freedom. Remember the necklace Cagalli gives Athrun, the Haumea amulet? I did a search and Haumea is a Goddess of Fertility and Childbirth worshiped in ORB. ORB has it's own religion, and if you have to follow it's ways as per what Uzumi said...  What about the PLANTs? They're under Lacus' control now. Let's hope they never find out that her, Kira and the Archangel interfered with Durandal's operation to capture Djibril in ORB. You know, the man who used a superweapon to wipe out a number of colonies? These are people who became bloodlusted after one, repeat, one colony was destroyed. While the bastard who did it may be dead, the people who interfered with the operation to capture him are now running the country.   I honestly don't think everyone would be sunshine and lollipops with her in charge. But you can't really complain, as she made her boyfriend a high ranking military officer. You know, the guy who has fought against ZAFT in two wars using stolen ZAFT Mobile Suits? Possessor of one of the only nuclear powered Mobile Suits in existence?  And it's not like anyone can build anymore nuclear MS. There's a treaty after all preventing people from doing so. So while ZAFT/ORB may have them, anyone who tries to even the playing field will be the bad guy. You know. Kinda like how Cagalli was upset that ZAFT was building more mobile suits after the first war, upgrading what they have and building a new battleship? It's not like ORB upgraded it's mobile suits, hid a battleship and a repaired Freedom within it's boarders.  Oh wait."
Gundam,3322f8,Char_X_3,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"Like ORB being idealized.   I wouldn't say ORB was idealized. ORB was one of only 3 neutral parties in the whole Naturals vs Coordinators war -- the others being the Kingdom of Scandanavia (which borders the EA and is therefore less safe) and the Equatorial Union (which is weak as shit and only exists because the EA had no use for it). It was really the only option for mixed Natural/Coordinator families and/or those who really didn't give a shit about the war. Likewise, the fact that ORB had a lot of Japanese settlers and was anti-war is an extension of the current IRL Japanese mentality towards conflict (i.e. don't get involved, stay neutral and advocate peace). However, even then, ORB wasn't able to stay 100% neutral due to the influence of the Earth Alliance (and eventually, Blue Cosmos/LOGOS once the Eurasian Federation was backstabbed and annihilated by the Atlantic Federation at Josh-A). Things like religion weren't important at all in CE given biological biases were the cause of the war -- which essentially overcame racial, ethnic and religious prejudice.   What about the PLANTs? They're under Lacus' control now.    Lacus is only the face of the ""new"" ZAFT. She represents her father's Clyne Faction pre-Patrick Zala's rampage. No one in their right mind would give the power of an entire country to an 18 year-old (especially after Cagalli fucked that up when ORB tried doing the same). Lacus is a great choice since she's already famous and is pro-peace and pro-Naturals; politically she also has close ties to ORB (Cagalli), the moderates/former Zala faction (Athrun, Yzak, Dearka); and she represents the most powerful military (Jesus Yamato).   Let's hope they never find out that her, Kira and the Archangel interfered with Durandal's operation to capture Djibril in ORB.   Everyone knows Kira and Lacus were in ORB during ZAFT's invasion; Kira and ArchAngel are the only reason ORB survived, and Lacus appeared on screen with Cagalli after the battle ended (and basically revealed Mia Cambell as the fake Lacus Clyne). Moreover, Durandal was just as much at fault for what happened with Djibril and the REQUIEM System since he pushed Djibril into using the weapon when ORB could've arrested him if ZAFT didn't interfere.   But you can't really complain, as she made her boyfriend a high ranking military officer. You know, the guy who has fought against ZAFT in two wars using stolen ZAFT Mobile Suits? Possessor of one of the only nuclear powered Mobile Suits in existence?   Kira became a White Jacket on his own merit. He helped end both wars and is easily the most powerful mobile suit pilot/army in the world. He also is Cagalli's brother, which promotes peace between ORB and ZAFT.   I don't think anyone cares about Kira using Freedom given the results he produced. Likewise, Strike Freedom was a prototype that was scrapped by ZAFT, and it was only able to come into fruition because Terminal stole the blueprints and made it themselves.   While it's true that Strike Freedom is one of the only Mobile Suits left with N-Jammer Cancellers, the notion is pretty much moot considering the use of N-Jammers were outlawed after SEED and all of the N-Jammers were already being dug out during Destiny. Newer mobile suits could easily have nuclear generators if the need called for it -- the Treaty of Junius outlawed N-Jammers and N-Jammer Cancellers, but the latter would become obsolete the moment all the N-Jammers were disabled in the Earth Sphere.   Kinda like how Cagalli was upset that ZAFT was building more mobile suits after the first war, upgrading what they have and building a new battleship? It's not like ORB upgraded it's mobile suits, hid a battleship and a repaired Freedom within it's boarders. Oh wait.    Cagalli was upset because ZAFT was strengthening it's army, which indicated to the (Blue Cosmos/LOGOS run) EA that another war was possible. ORB was playing the role of diplomacy, so it's only natural it would try to calm down both sides since the scars of war were still fresh. Just think about how the UN is always telling nuclear armed countries to get rid of their nukes, or strictly regulating nations that want nuclear technology (like Iran and North Korea).  ORB's army was meant for self-defence, so there's nothing wrong with them strengthening whatever technology they had. The ORB military was much smaller and weaker than EA/ZAFT anyways, with an obscure population.  ArchAngel was actually hiding under the Kingdom of Scandinavia after SEED ended. And AA isn't a registered ORB ship, especially considering it attacked ORB vessels during their interventions/ORB branded them an enemy vessel. Likewise, Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice were built by Terminal (a non-government entity) which works under the Three Ships Alliance, not ORB/EA/ZAFT."

Gundam,3322f8,rms141,2,Sun Apr 19 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Well, everything that happened in SEED post-death match was partially influenced by Bandai since Gunpla sales were lower than expected.

Destiny was all Fukuda and his wife treating the cast and crew like shit (Shinn/ZAFT got scrapped as the leads and Cagalli got neutered into a cry baby because their VAs argued with Fukuda's wife).

The moments with Sven and Selene were very touching, but for me the best moment of Stargazer was saying goodbye to the Noir. They never made it implicit, the relationship between Sven and the Strike Noir, but the moment when they leave it behind... that really got me. Mecha and pilots do have a relationship, and the Strike Noir was something special to Sven, it got him into space, it encased and protected him. The Strike Noir was partially the embodiment of Sven's dream, and a shadow of his past, and when the time came for them to part, she gave the last of her life so that he could return home. She was a good suit that one."

Gundam,333f7t,leon004567,2,Sun Apr 19 04:10:08 2015 UTC,"You are correct in that the Federation deployed NBCs in the opening days of the One Year War; however, I don't think it's ever made clear if they were directed at purely military targets or military/industrial ones.  In either case, Zeon's use of chemical weapons against purely civilian targets and the following colony drop as the final major NBC/'doomsday' actions of the war before the Antarctic Treaty was signed probably contributed to the perception that they were the primary offenders. Frankly, it didn't help that Zeon lost - this gave the Federation virtual free reign to portray Zeon however it wished in areas they held.  Unfortunately, we don't really get a good view of how the Federation was viewed directly following 0083; although they had constructed a nuclear-armed Gundam, Zeon again upped the ante by dropping a colony that would wipe out a huge portion of Earth's food supply, no doubt hardening anti-Zeon perceptions in Federation territory.  By the time Zeta rolls around, the Titans' actions have changed that dynamic, though."

They were able to make one ""doomsday weapon"" similar to Gryps, but that one burned itself after one fire.  So not only is there no ""abundance"" of Doomsday weapons, Zeon can only make one, versus EF's 4. If that doesn't tell you how ""notorious"" EF is with its control of the Earth...well maybe you need to watch Unicorn, 3x to be sure.  Note I have not included Mobile Armors and Suits in this count, because if I did, it would even skew more into EF's (and Anaheim's) favor (or disfavor, since it's negative...). GP-03 Dendrobium  ""Orchis"" could probably annihilate a colony or two given its armaments...alone. GP-02 ""Physalis""  was  also made by the EF...and that one can carry nukes..."
Gundam,333f7t,CidImmacula,4,Sun Apr 19 05:36:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, the colony laser from Zeta was Gryps 2. They're the same.    In 0086, the Titans renamed the new colony group at Side 7 from Green Noa to Gryps. Gryps 1 was, on paper, a residential colony, but housed many Titans facilities.    Gryps 2 was a closed-type industrial colony that (according to Char) seemed to have been cobbled together from Zeon's colony scraps. It was a major Titans base at the start of the Gryps conflict, but they later moved their base to Gryps 1, gutted the colony, and constructed the laser inside it.  So yeah, that's why Bright gets so pissed when he finds out they're going to use it. He was under the impression that it had been deactivated after he captured it, ended the Titans' coup, and turned it back over to the Federation.    Also, it takes the number of active Federation superweapons to one at most times. Though it seems like they can get a Solar System array together pretty quick when they need to."

I think this is evidenced by Chairman Ronin, and Captain Bright's obvious distaste for the foundation's goal, and in the end Ronin flips the switch to save the perceived sphere of influence the Federation has attained.  It doesn't help when notoriety is implied, but not integrated into the storytelling. This is why one of the better moments of balancing is during ZZ when the Federation official states hes cool with letting the colony drop happen. At this point in production history its just accepted that Zeon is willing to do dastardly acts, but its an unusual depiction of Federation policy to be so scummy.  I guess you can make the argument concerning the Titans as being notorious for the Federation, however they were eventually given autonomy so government oversight is just not a thing anymore. So yes creating the Titans was a bad thing, but the Federation government was at the mercy of their creation."

Gundam,331736,OutZoned,9,Sat Apr 18 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"I often compare 0079 to Star Trek TOS. While they may not be as refined as later installments, shows the limitations of the era is was made in (on both a production and storytelling level) and has campy moments, they're still the most memorable installment of the franchise."

Gundam,331736,Char_X_3,4,Sat Apr 18 15:03:39 2015 UTC,I'm not knocking them. 0079 is tied with 00 as my favorite Gundam series. It just goes to show how timeless the original was.

Gundam,331736,Nick700,10,Sat Apr 18 15:10:22 2015 UTC,"0079 feels like a snapshot of history. It's almost voyeuristic, like you're staring into a time machine, watching people live and die before your very eyes.   YES EXACTLY!! IT FEELS SO REAL DESPITE ALL THE CAMPY ROBOTS!!! It's something like watching a W.W.III documentary before it ever happens.  It is an epic saga the likes of Star Wars and LOTR but with that hard realism that Star Trek seems to have ""left in the uncivilized past"" so to speak... It's the story of humanity colonizing our system without intervention from pacifistic outside species like Vulcans - and thus it reflects our violent expansion around our own planet and makes us look back on our work and wonder if we can do better in the future. It is the definition of GOOD science fiction!!  Welcome aboard the Gundam fan train!! After 08th MS Team watch 0080 for the feels and then move on to 0083 for Top Gun Gundam and your burning heart."

Gundam,331736,Brenticus302,2,Sun Apr 19 00:36:04 2015 UTC,Watching Zeta now.

Gundam,331736,Terminimal,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:38:11 2015 UTC,"I'd actually recommend watching them in chronological order so as to get the most impact from the story. It's easier to watch a story as it unfolds than jump back and forth and be like ""Oh, this happened because that happened and I remember now."" Plus, 08th MS Team is my fav and it would be next after 0079. It's the only series that shows us what the war was like for your average soldier."
Gundam,331736,puffnstuff272,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"Cronological order is great... for a rewatch. The first time, you need to do production order. Watching 083 before Zeta ruins 0083. And things like that. All gundam shows reference previously made gundam shows. I guess you wouldn't miss much by watching 08th early, but that isn't the case for some others"
Gundam,331736,Brenticus302,4,Sun Apr 19 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"I felt like I was watching an in-universe docudrama, almost propaganda. Not in a negative sense, but a sort of propaganda that's honest about what war entails, but still asks you to fight. I felt like it was saying: ""Look, boys and girls of the Earth Sphere. The crew of the White Base started out as normal kids living in a peaceful space colony, no different from you. They were cruelly forced into the war, without any real choice, but they each stepped up to the plate and helped bring the war to an end. Could you make the sacrifices necessary for peace, like the young men and women of the White Base did?""  This in-universe feel also complements First Gundam's sometimes vague or minimalistic backstory. I always thought that there was very little time devoted to the story of Zeon's assassination, and his ideals, considering how important those were. But as an in-universe docudrama, it makes sense. Everybody already knows about Zeon's death, the rumors of a Zabi conspiracy, and that Char's mission was to get revenge. The docudrama's viewers don't need to be reminded of all that. What's more interesting is Char's day-to-day life in the military, something the history textbooks don't address, but First Gundam does.  I also think of the part where the Solar Ray is fired on the Federation fleet, and Amuro, feeling the coming tragedy with his Newtype senses, bursts onto the bridge, saying, ""No! Don't do it! Don't move forward! People are melting in a whirlpool of light! That's the light of hatred!"" With all that melodrama, I felt like I was already supposed to know that I was witnessing this important, infamous historical event. Almost how 9/11 or the atomic bombings on Japan would be portrayed in a movie today."
Gundam,331736,sdwoodchuck,2,Sun Apr 19 00:54:45 2015 UTC,It does have fantastic world building. There is a reason that so much of it would be copy and pasted by later robot shows.
Gundam,331736,iceman_in_black,2,Sat Apr 18 15:06:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, a lot of people had a lot of really good thoughts on why 0079 is so great, including OP.   I feel the same way.  It is timeless in a way few things are.  The pacing of the show is perfect, I think- overall.  You get the feeling  that the people being portrayed are genuinely swept up in a conflict much greater than they are.  And that's a sticking point for me.  It felt like what was happening would be natural to read in a text book, somewhere down the road.  It felt like history."
Gundam,331736,OhUmHmm,2,Wed Apr 22 18:13:52 2015 UTC,"There are people that will suggest watching all the side stories before you move on to Zeta.  I get where they're coming from, but I don't agree with them.  I would jump into Zeta right away, before you watch anything else (08th MS Team shouldn't actually impact that).  The reason is because, while the side stories give some further context, and one in particular moving from 0079 to Zeta, that context actually works against the surprises at the start of Zeta.  Without getting into spoilery details, between the end of 0079 and Zeta's 0087, there has been a pretty dramatic paradigm shift that is fascinating to see once it's already in full swing, before you see how it gets there.  It enhances that snapshot-in-time sense that you had with the first series, by continuing from it, but not in a smooth transition.  It's like seeing a picture of someone you're familiar with, and then seeing another photo, seven years later and with a nasty scar.  The difference is striking.    Production Order is a good ground rule, but for UC in particular, I'd say 0079 -> Zeta -> ZZ* -> CCA -> 0080 -> 08th MS Team -> 0083, then you can tackle F91, Victory, and Unicorn in whatever order you like, since they aren't really connected to each other in a meaningful plot sense.    *ZZ is totally optional, and I'd actually recommend you just read a plot summary of it after Zeta.  You can come back and give it a real shot later, and you should because the latter half of the series is really good, but the first half is frustrating and will really bust up your groove continuing after Zeta."
Gundam,331736,Broward,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:16:47 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of that to find in the Universal Century. Tomino was (eventually) allowed to build and grow his own little universe. Its cool that there is so much information as far technical specs and the like. I love the depiction of war as a grey morality. But the best part for me is the characters. Each character has layers and depth and grows over time. Each side has jerks that you hate, and each side has people you either love or can at least understand what they are fighting for. Even though people like Ramba Ral fought for Zeon, they were still good honorable people."
Gundam,331736,HeIsAnAli,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"I love 0079 for more or less the same reasons.  08th MS team is probably my favorite mecha series as it combines that feeling of gritty historical realism with unparalleled animation.    I would also strongly recommend an anime called ""the legend of galactic heroes"" -- there are 3 movies that introduce the series very well.  It is the only other anime that gave me such a strong feeling of historical narrative.  Edit: despite LOGH being a masterpiece, it was never brought over to the US, so only subs exist.  Hope that does not deter, it is an amazing series."
Gundam,331736,HeIsAnAli,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"If that was what you enjoyed the most, I highly recommend you watch Legends of Galactic Heroes.

It is also somewhat dated animation by today's standards, but one of the best stories you could find and it is available on youtube for easy access."

In hindsight, maybe coming to terms regarding the copious amounts of beam spam was what got me to swap the Strike Freedom for the Zabanya, but I digress."

Gundam,32ytto,Xikar_Wyhart,4,Fri Apr 17 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"It seems like a story element that got hastily changed.  As /u/nontelop mentioned, the flashback character closely resembles Junya both in appearance and somewhat in manner, while the flashback character looks nothing like Saga, and honestly doesn't behave like him either.  Now we can certainly give some allowance for the fact that it was years ago that the encounter took place, and everybody involved is still in the under-19 bracket during the series.  Kids change a lot, both physically and behaviorally, in a short time.    I have no confirmation on this, so it's all just speculative, but I'll tell  you what I think happened.  I think originally Saga was intended to be Sekai's final-round rival, and his former training partner in Jigen Haoh School instead of Junya.  A lot of Saga's motivation gels well with that.  He's trying to find stronger opponents (classic martial artist trope; also somewhat attributed to Junya), and he continues fighting through injury (another classic Martial Artist trope, and mirrored in Sekai's fighting through injury via assimilation).    Junya was probably intended to be the one who busted up Yuuma's confidence years ago.  Notice that while he has that motivation of getting stronger and learning ""secret techniques,"" this is supplemented with a malicious attitude toward other fighters, which actually matches up really well with the flashback figure.  There's also the meeting where Junya and his thugs try to steal the Build Burning's spare parts from Yuuma.  This is not only a very underhanded thing to do (not something that makes a lick of sense coming from a martial artist looking to encounter stronger opponents), but this encounter takes on a much less random, and more sinister flavor, if Yuuma and Junya are rivals rather than Sekai and Junya.    For whatever reason, they seem to have done some rewrites, probably after some of the early footage was already animated, and after some later-series scenes/ideas were already scripted.  Probably they realized that they wanted each of the Try Fighters to have a rival in the final, and if Yuuma has Sakai as a rival, and Junya as a Rival, and then has a Rival in the final three, then the end of the series becomes the Yuuma show.  So they split it up such that Yuuma has a rival in Sakai, Sekai has a rival in Junya, and then all three have rivals in the final."
Gundam,32ytto,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is that we find out Adou is the guy Yuuma is looking for almost immediately after he make an appearance, then why don't they just make Adou appear as the long hair hooded guy in the memory instead of the Mr.Chin we get here? I would understand if Adou is a character that has already showed face in previous episode and then later someone calls for a change, so that they just shoehorned it onto Adou and hope the audience forget about it. They don't have to have the inconsistency but they went with it anyway, just doesn't sit well with me."
Gundam,32ytto,BoyGodz,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"Again, this is all speculative, but I imagine that their character artwork and such was done before animation even started, such that if they made a change to the character roles at the last minute, they'd still need to use the assets they've already developed, rather than step back and get the character designer (who by this point is probably contracted to another job already) back in to do one new character."
Gundam,32ytto,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"Surely the decision is made after they completed the production of ep2, otherwise they could have just left out that single cut with the hooded guy, wouldn't it be the exact situation with what you are saying (getting the character designer back to create Adou). Otherwise they could have easily avoided the inconsistency by 1. Going with hooded guy for the rest of the series, or 2. Edit the flash back scene to not show hooded guy. Just kind of poor planning to roll back on character designs 2 episodes in."

My main point is that you have to make time for Unicorn. It's beautiful, expertly written, excellent soundtrack and and amazing series overall. It's one of my all time favorites."
Gundam,32wy2x,iceman_in_black,3,Fri Apr 17 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"To expand on some of these a bit more:  08th MS team has some narrative and characterization difficulties relating to the director's death, but overall comes off with a solid story and all-around show. Very well animated, and gets a lot of applause for being a 'realistic' Gundam series (heavy focus on the actual mechanics of mobile suits, tactics of their use, and such).  0083 is similarly well-animated, has some very strong characters, and nicely bridges the gap between MSG and Zeta; if you're a fan of the overall UC narrative, you may want to pick up this. Unfortunately, all of this is overshadowed by a truly awful plot twist towards the end of the series that badly damages the story. I still like it.  Unicorn serves as a 'conclusion' to the larger Federation-Zeon conflict in the same way that CCA served to conclude Amuro and Char's stories. Compression from the source material unfortunately results in some characters acting odd towards the middle of the story, but there are some very strong characters to balance them out and the whole thing is piled with truly incredible animation and soundtrack."
Gundam,32wy2x,Zonetr00per,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:59:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this. I think the mild hiccups in Unicorn and 08th can be easily overlooked.

Gundam,32wy2x,Nick700,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:26:35 2015 UTC,"You need to watch 0080. It is a side story, but one of the best Gundam anime ever.   Then continue the timeline where you left off and watch F91 and Victory. Victory is about as good as ZZ but is more depressing like Zeta. F91 is only good for the amazing animation. Then go to Turn A, the best Gundam series. Then G-reco.  I also skipped over the alternate universe shows like X and 00, just watch those any time if you want."

Gundam,32roec,duelistgamer,14,Thu Apr 16 04:29:53 2015 UTC,"Calling it a ""robot"" or a mech is good enough, no? Name one transformer that looks anywhere similar to this. One."
Gundam,32roec,Setsuna-F-Seiei,7,Thu Apr 16 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"Transformers don't have a set design theme. Just about any giant robot could potentially be a Transformer. No, there isn't any specific character I could compare this design to, but if I had no prior knowledge of Gundam and this robot were called a Transformer, I wouldn't think twice about it.   You are right, they could have just said robot or mech, but I'd still wouldn't say they are morons just for calling it a Transformer."
Gundam,32roec,duelistgamer,2,Thu Apr 16 05:02:25 2015 UTC,"It's not about the design theme. There are a number of ""prototypes"" that you would mentally associate the robot with before calling it a transformer, be it optimus, red alert, starscream, hot shot or someone else.  I don't see people make this mistake when discussing a number of other mech/robot shows. It's mostly Gundam-style mechs that people fuck up."
Gundam,32roec,Setsuna-F-Seiei,4,Thu Apr 16 05:31:13 2015 UTC,"There are a number of ""prototypes"" that you would mentally associate the robot with before calling it a transformer, be it optimus, red alert, starscream, hot shot or someone else   No, I wouldn't actually. There isn't any Transformer that I'd use as a defualt comparison because they all look so different. All of those characters you named have radically different designs.

Gundam,32roec,duelistgamer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"You misunderstood the argument.  There are a lot of robots in Transformers that are immediately identified by a large number of people. They are representative forms of what you would expect a transformers-style robot to look like. Each of them often has a same basic design across the different shows and movies, such as Starscream with it's sleek fighter jet look, Optimus Prime with it' blocky truck-like appearance etc."
Gundam,32roec,CrashmanX,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:20:43 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of robots in Transformers that are immediately identified by a large number of people.   For most people it's Optimus, Bumblee Bee, Megatron, and Starscream. You're lucky if many even recognize their 80's look. Most people today only really know of those 4 as they're prominent in the Bayformers movies. Had it not been for those movies, Transformers would've nearly faded into obscurity by this point."
Gundam,32roec,duelistgamer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:34:37 2015 UTC,Most people today only really know of those 4 as they're prominent in the Bayformers movies.    I disagree. Unicorn trilogy aired in the 2000s where I live(d).
Gundam,32roec,CrashmanX,3,Thu Apr 16 14:44:23 2015 UTC,"As it did here in the US. But if I ask someone ""Hey, do you know who Hotshot is or what he looks like?"" or asked them ""What does Bumblebee look like?"" or even ""What color is Megatron?"" I bet 9/10 times people are going to say the Bayformers counter parts if they even know.  Why? Because they were kids when it aired or they didn't watch it. Gundam Wing, 08th MS, G, and 0079 all aired before Transformers did here in the US and SEED aired after, yet if I show them a Gundam most people call it a Transformer initially.   They see Giant robot, their first thought is Transformer because that's the most popular thing with Giant robots here in the US and in many places that aren't Japan."

Gundam,32roec,duelistgamer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:30:49 2015 UTC,I know that. But there isn't a single transformers design that would look even remotely like a zaku.

It's bright and happy for sure, more than most gundam series, and they don't stop for ANYTHING.  This show seriously just goes full speed from the start all the way to the end, and they get through a whole gundam show's worth of stuff, in about half the usual episodes.  They spend plenty of time on chaotic robot destruction, and it's good stuff.  Don't get hung up on details, just roll with it."
Gundam,32uhxk,Turambar87,2,Thu Apr 16 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"Hah, whenever I'm describing G Reco from now on, this is more or less how I'm gonna describe it."
Gundam,32uhxk,PirateLincoln,4,Fri Apr 17 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"Good; not great.  I like the mobile suit designs, I like most of the characters, and while the tone is lighter, I wouldn't say it's necessarily kiddish (the tone is pretty close to Turn A, if you've seen that), and some elements of the plot are remarkably mature, though others are comparatively silly.   Also, I love the environment aesthetic.    The downside is that it feels like it was written as a longer series, and the cuts are clumsy.  Some character motivations are bizarrely unexplained, some major character revelations happen off-screen between episodes (this is not an exaggeration: one episode begins with characters saying ""so it turns out so-and-so was a spy, who'd have guessed it?"" with no prior indication) and the overall flow is erratic.    I like G-Reco, but it does have some glaring problems.  I find myself hoping that they get a chance to do some more in that timeline, so that the good elements get a better series to shine in."
Gundam,32uhxk,sdwoodchuck,3,Thu Apr 16 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't really enjoy it.  I don't have a problem with the lighter tone, the problem for me is that the tone clashes with the message Tomino is trying to convey.  I also feel like characters actions and allegiances aren't really motivated by anything at times (like when the main character basically switches sides for no reason).  Some of the suit designs are neat, and when the show wants to it knows how to show some great battle sequences, but as a whole I was pretty let down."
Gundam,32uhxk,LordRevann,2,Fri Apr 17 13:49:51 2015 UTC,"If you can get past the ridiculousness of Episode seven (Phew massive battle, I'd better rearm and refuel, oh hi dad, who is a key figure and would stop the war if you were killed in the middle of this battle...Let's stop for a picnic right here, fancy some tea and sandwiches?), then you are going to make it, I had to stop watching it at that point for a few weeks.  Don't get me wrong the fights are great, but that one episode ruined what little I had left of patience in the series, when I felt like watching it again, I got to the point where they board the crescent ship, and then I just said ""f#@k it, let's just watch the last episode""...Made about as much sense as trying to watch the rest of the series, not much beyond fighting over who has control of the battery manufacturing, the G-Self, or space nuts (no, they really are called that)."

Gundam,32uhxk,outamyhead,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"For a series that isn't based on an original Manga, they are good.  Have you read the Manga of Unicorn, because those fight scenes are a heck of a lot better than the OVA."

Tone is light overall, but the series itself is appropriately complex for a Gundam series. I personally think it's worth watching and probably benefits more from a binge watch, but it's hard to say if it would be worthwhile to you without knowing what you like in general."
Gundam,32uhxk,GospelX,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"Well, my two favourites are Unicorn and 00.   But I have also seen MSG 0079, Zeta, Seed, Seed Destiny, 0083."

Gundam,32uhxk,brandonvandyke22,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:24:08 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, if you can get past the bright visuals and the genki-ness of it all, you can find an interesting storyline delivered in surprisingly sharp manner (terminology is introduced episodes before you are actually told, mostly because there's a lack of informational monologues that most series (and bad writers) shove into conversations) as well as solid world building that slowly shows viewers that the future after the UC calendar looks like. It's too bad that Tomino pursued a tone that turns certain viewers away from the series. I hope that someone creates a series in this particular timeline that aligns more with what the ""hard"" Gundam fans might want. The world is too rich to be a one-off."

Gundam,32x5wr,wjapple,3,Sat Apr 18 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"I know it's not a popular opinion, but i agree. Zeta, and especially ZZ just have too much Filler. Granted they arent nearly as bad as 90's anime like DBZ or sailor moon. I appreciate the trend nowadays toward succinct 26 episode shows.  I'd rather have to stay focused to keep up with a show than be so bored i could care less about all the characters getting blown up."
Gundam,32x5wr,DenkouNova,0,Fri Apr 17 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"There's real character development in the series, and I'm happy to see that, but dammit it's just so padded out.  I know I sound like a true-blue UC fanatic when I say this, but 26 episodes of Zeta and I've had enough of kids going for glory on the battlefield instead of following orders... because the pride of the soldiers comes before strategy, both AEUG and Titans have wasted a huge amount of lives and resources on nothing more than an elaborate game of cat and mouse.  It's so frustrating coming from Gundam 00 and Geass and Log Horizon and such, where the fights had purpose because the factions developed their plans over the course of the series..."
Gundam,32x5wr,EPrest90,2,Fri Apr 17 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"This is kind of Zeta's problem, I think. I felt Turn A had less pacing problems and ZZ had its pacing problems only at the beginning.  I wish First and X had been 52 instead of 38."
Gundam,32x5wr,OmegaSeven,2,Fri Apr 17 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"Zeta at 3 cour instead of 4 sounds like it would be about right for the scope they wanted. Yeah, I think that length sounds good."

Gundam,32x5wr,EPrest90,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:23:36 2015 UTC,Zeta has some trouble getting going but it does pick up in the back half if I'm remembering right.

Scirocco was the puppet master."
Gundam,32taqb,chrysamere,2,Thu Apr 16 16:47:02 2015 UTC,I'm only talking about their strength on the battlefield. Of course Scirocco was more dangerous overall since he was a mastermind. But on the battlefield it felt like Scirocco wasn't as dangerous as Yazan.

He's smart, that's why he didn't get himself killed, which I actually liked, how a villain was smart enough to know when to back off. But Scirocco was more in control of the battlefield and was able to influence the flow of battle a lot better than Yazan. All Yazan had was remarkable skill.

Taking the TV show as cannon, then Gundanium armor in AC timeline is immune to MS class projectile weapons, from Leo's 105mm Rifle to Tallgeese's Dober gun, and provides some defense against beam weapons even without special treatment (see Tallgeese VS Heavy Arms duel).   Wing and Heavy Arms (and their respective upgrades) have higher firepower than the vast majority of UC MS, but Sandrock, Deathscythe, and Shenlong, however, have very limited ranged combat ability.   Over all, the 5 Gundams in AC timeline are designed for one-man operations, and they surely outpower most MS from UC interms of relative strength.They are more comparable to Gundams from 00 imo."
Gundam,32s7at,leon004567,0,Thu Apr 16 08:31:44 2015 UTC,We need a ranking and power ratings of all gundams and other prominent mobile suits from across timelines!

I won't even mention the number one and two physics defying suits the Turn A and 00 Quanta respectively. It's a much better picture numbering them within their own Timeline

Gundam,32s7at,Hellbender79,3,Fri Apr 17 08:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think some of the people here are majorly overrating the Wing gundams.  One thing that is true is that Wing Zero and Tallgeese III have ridiculous laser cannons that shouldn't be on a MS. The closest thing you get to a cannon like that is the Hyaku-Shiki's mega beam cannon, or the Full Armor ZZ Hyper Beam Cannon. And those are huge and require external power sources. But aside from that..  Do you guys really think something like Shenlong Gundam could defeat Nu Gundam? What would Shenlong do when it is surrounded by funnels on all sides? Could Heavyarms defeat Sazabi? Let's not even get into how badly Sinanju would beat on the Wing Gundams."
Gundam,32s7at,iceman_in_black,2,Thu Apr 16 17:18:28 2015 UTC,Sinanju wouldn't be able to catch the Tallgeese much less Epyon or Zero who has an acceleration of 15Gs.
Gundam,32s7at,Hellbender79,0,Thu Apr 16 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, where do you get those numbers from? Second, we're not talking about a race, we're talking about a battle. If Epyon or Zero wants to run away, Sinanju could just shoot it in the back."
Gundam,32s7at,iceman_in_black,2,Thu Apr 16 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah because we can't use speed in a battle. Epyon and Zero would dodge and avoid all range attacks, and in close combat, almost every Wing Gundam suit would be too much, especially Epyon.    ""Designed by the Gundam Scientists, the Tallgeese was a well rounded unit featuring both long range and melee weapons, and also heavy armor coupled with high power boosters. However, the powerful boosters put a lot of strain on the pilot, producing acceleration of about 15 Gs"" from Gundam Wiki...Epyon and Zero are note to be much faster than Tallgeese."
Gundam,32s7at,autowikiabot,0,Fri Apr 17 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you got down-voted for that one, your 100% right.  Look at basic power to weight ratios on the MS and it not hard to see how much faster AC gundams are:   Sinanju: 3240 kW/56.9 metric tons = 56.9 Unicorn (RX-0): 3480 kW/42.7 metric tons = 81.49 LM314V21 Victory 2 Gundam: 7510 kW/15.9 metric tons = 472.3 Wing Zero (Epyon not listed, but it should be similar): 3732 kW/8.0 metric tons = 466.5   Basically, not only is Gundanium stupid strong compared to Gundarium/Luna Titanium, it is really light meaning faster acceleration, maneuverability and so forth (this is one of the big reasons the V2 has a Gundarium alloy/super-ceramic composite armor instead of pure Gundarium) .  The Wing and Epyon are also transformable Zeta-types which will give and even greater speed and maneuverability advantage at range.  On an unrelated note, Newtype powers aren't going to give a massive advantage in this fight, as perfect pilot skill can match newtype talents and reactions source, thats not even accounting for the god-mode Zero system."
Gundam,32s7at,iceman_in_black,3,Sat Apr 18 04:52:35 2015 UTC,"I just checked your math because I did a Top Five Gundams of the UC. It's a little off (I think you used the max weight instead of the standard weight, Wing Zero only lists standard weight. Standard weight was what I used for the calculations). They're actually more like:     MSN-06S Sinanju 0.128571429 kW/kg  RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 0.146835443 kW/kg  LM314V21 Victory 2 Gundam 0.653043478 kW/kg  XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero (Endless Waltz) 0.4665 kW/kg     So power wise the Victory 2 Gundam is way more powerful, but when you look at the thrust to weight ratios     LM314V21 Victory 2 Gundam 2.904347826 kg thrust per kg weight  XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero (Endless Waltz) 11.01875 kg thrust per kg weight     So Wing Zero (Endless Waltz) is much faster than Victory 2. Oddly enough if you wanted to pick a UC Gundam to take on Wing Zero, I'd pick the F91.     F91 Gundam F91 0.590277778 kW/kg power to weight ratio  12.27777778 kg thrust per kg weight     So the later U.C. Gundam's aren't quite as outgunned as you'd think."
Gundam,32s7at,chrysamere,2,Sat Apr 18 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  That post you made earlier was definitely the inspiration for mine.    I think you used the max weight instead of the standard weight   I was assuming max weight was referring to a fully loaded version of the suit, as we would see in combat.  The logic was that UC MS can carry a large variety of weapons, ammo and energy packs into battle, whereas AC MS essentially deploy with the same thing every time, so only one weight number is necessary.    So the later U.C. Gundam's aren't quite as outgunned as you'd think.   I was replying to the comment about the Sinanju, which would be a lot slower than a AC MS.  But as far as late UC is concerned you are correct, speed would be very comparable between the universes.  However, to get these speeds Gundarium alloy/super-ceramic composite armor had to be used which is even less durable than armor used in 0087 (Ceramic composites were equivalent to B-Gundanium, not the Y-Gundanium seen in every MS from the Zeta to the Unicorn).  Good catch with the F91 though, I did not realize it had superior thrust/weight to the V2."

I also think that the standard weight is what the suit goes out with with standard equipment and arms. The max weight is the ""lets cram everything we have onto this thing because we're probably going to die in this next battle"" sort of thing.      But yeah the numbers looked different from what I did so I started looking into it.

Gundam,32s7at,taarec10,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:52:59 2015 UTC,"I just posted some updated numbers that are a better comparison of UC Suits to Wing Gundams and can expand on it if need be (its in an excel sheet) but there is one thing that can't be overlooked (and I wanted to expand on since I had the time):     The ZZ (or double zeta or whatever) has a pretty high output at 7340 kW, almost twice Wing Zero's 3732 kW output. (The F91 and Victory Gundams are pretty high as well but I couldn't find the output numbers for their beam weapons)     The ZZ has the High Mega Cannon with an output of 50 MW, which destroys suits with ease (and could probably do significant damage to a colony) but will nearly completely drain the suit of power after one shot as the generators can't handle the power demand. The F91 suffered a similar problem with the VSBR.      Wing Zero, with half the generator output, can fire its twin buster rifle multiple times, taking out waves of enemys, colonies, or fortresses with ease and the generators have no problems maintaining power levels for the suit. If that were to hold true in a fight with a UC Gundam, Wing Zero would almost certainly win."
Gundam,32s7at,iceman_in_black,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:16:02 2015 UTC,That was the first thing I admitted in my post. The Twin Buster Rifle is just absurd. Any kind of real comparison needs to take it out of the equation.   It can be dodged though. Zechs dodges a shot in Epyon and Heero dodges a shot in Mercurius.
Gundam,32s7at,DJ_Serious,2,Sat Apr 18 13:32:54 2015 UTC,"In the canon of Frozen Teardrop, The TBR is what's called a Minovsky attrition induction weapon. The more your enemy scatters in their environment for defenses, the more effective the weapon actually becomes. Its literally a doctored beam that causes cascades in the particles themselves. If your enemy doesn't scatter, its an above average beam rifle. If your enemy does scatter, the potency rises exponentially against density and area, verses the ignition charge of the TBR. Its like a lighter catching petrol fumes and causing an explosion: the particles can only ""burn"" once. Like conventional beam weapons, its range is limited depending on how long the shot can maintain its cohesion and not split up, diffuse and disperse. Actually firing the weapon works similarly to the Vayate's large beam cannon's collector, but the collectors are located in the shoulders as the large ring-like units and also throughout other parts of the mobilesuit including the large yellow rail over the rifle's top and the interior, parts of the shield and parts of the wing assembly -- which is why you'll notice almost always whenever it fires a hi-output shot, the wings are open. In this way, the weapon has three input sources: the natural output of its own ultracompact fission reactor, the caps/condensers its loaded with between sorties and the recovery system distributed over the body of the mobilesuit. The weapon is even seen as not requiring a direct-line of sight, that the attrition effect can interfere with an ultracompact fission reactor enough to destroy a mobilesuit with proximity alone."
Gundam,32s7at,chrysamere,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:46:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you explained all of that, but regardless.. scattered enemies or not, the TBR destroys everything it is pointed at.

Gundam,32s7at,DJ_Serious,2,Mon Apr 20 16:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'm explaining it because a lot of people don't know how it works and there is some ""ground"" for the TBR to stand on."
Gundam,32s7at,dataznthug,0,Mon Apr 20 16:56:59 2015 UTC,Right. I was bored and looked at the numbers to see just how absurd it was. If the F91 or V-Dash could play by those rules they would probably run circles around Zero.

Gundam,32rdv1,leon004567,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:52:45 2015 UTC,To achieve such a thrust ratio though the engines on that thing would be so ridiculous what would be the point of having an MS attached to it? Missiles would fly so fast and hard they wouldn't need explosives if you could move it with that much thrust in such a small package.
Gundam,32rdv1,CrashmanX,3,Thu Apr 16 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"In UC timeline most MS from around 0087 and after have higher than 1 thrust to weight ratio, even grunt suits, i.e. Nemo, GMIII.

I love Zeta, but the Psycho Gundam is probably my strongest example of this, especially in it's ""I can turn into a floating box"" Mobile Armor transformation.  It sticks out like a sore thumb in Zeta because so many of the suits there exemplify the agility to avoid beams design philosophy, that a big dumb target just seems strange.    From a more practical/entertainment perspective it's the beam shields, anti-beam coatings, and junk of that nature.  It isn't that this sort of technology is implausible--it actually makes perfect sense for the tech to go that direction as a reaction to more prevalent beam weaponry--it's that it makes the fights so much less interesting.  With beam weaponry causing big, and sometimes fatal damage on a single hit, there's a kind of urgency to combat that gets watered down when a direct hit with a beam or two doesn't make a difference."
Gundam,32rdv1,sdwoodchuck,4,Thu Apr 16 15:41:12 2015 UTC,Too many sharp or spikey shapes. It makes me too aware that the suit is trying to look cool and looses the real robot feel.

Zock, Big Zam, etc. Pretty much all mobile armors just make no sense to me and loathe them all. They just aren't practical if it's not a gun boat at that point.  Transformations for the sake of having a transformation. Lookin at you Sentinel Gundam, Double Zeta, Victory, Strike, etc. Anything that has a pointless transformation. The Zeta and it's line has a purpose, Atmospheric re-entry and increased thrust by re-positioning the thrusters, it makes sense. Stuff like the Victory just doesn't, stuff like the Double Zeta makes even less sense and serves no practical purpose on the battlefield. AGE-3 is especially bad about this, but it's designed to sell toys so it gets a bit of a pass."
Gundam,32rdv1,CrashmanX,3,Thu Apr 16 05:28:41 2015 UTC,"Zeta makes sense because due to the advent of beam weaponry, armours are now useless so the only way to not get hit by the beam is to dodge and you need acceleration, agility and thrust to dodge."
Gundam,32rdv1,CrashmanX,2,Thu Apr 16 05:46:41 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't transform mid battle to evade a beam. That just doesn't make sense. You'd be caught by the beam in mid transformation.  But, I get what you're saying."
Gundam,32rdv1,ExpiredSushi,5,Thu Apr 16 05:49:24 2015 UTC,"Actually you would. They can transform while moving and alot of MS->MA transformations are to reposition yourself in a more advantageous situation (Fly away from the battle and take cover behind an asteroid or something).     Also, with things like the Victory and ZZ, they don't actually transform? They are modular, so they can transport as smaller pieces before combining near where they are needed. The ZZ's benefit is that it can serve as 3 separate, relatively agile fighters instead of one giant clunky powerhouse. The Victory benefits because it can easily replace any lost armor by having a new piece flown in.    The Sentinel is a flying brick, so giving it an MA mode gives it more thrust to hopefully compensate. And I don't know what transformation you're talking about for Strike."
Gundam,32rdv1,CrashmanX,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"I've not seen a MS transform and move at the same time. I've only ever seen them stop to transform. And in-atmosphere that'd be incredibly difficult as they'd have to have very high speed to keep moving, stop thrusting and change shape throwing around weight, then start moving again without hitting the ground.  As far as the Victory's transformation, it still transforms mid combat. Which is ridiculous. Doesn't make any sense why you'd carry spare parts and not just whole other units, especially when the entire top or lower half would have to be swapped out and not just singular parts like an arm or leg.  For the ZZ, in theory yes. However it's power is so weakened by having 3 parts that it defeats the purpose of even being able to split up.  If the three parts could easily hold their own against any one mobile suit then that'd make sense. However it's shown been shown that most mobile suits are more agile and durable than the singular parts of the ZZ. If the ZZ were piloted by 3 skilled aces, I could see it's transformation being useful. However at that point it's power output isn't enough to compensate for having 3 good pilots in one machine instead of 3 slightly weaker machines which could take it down.  The sentinel, I guess? But it's transformation is so ridiculous that if it were to take any sort of decent blow it'd be incapable of transforming and that'd negate the whole point of having a transformation. Also given that it's a space use unit, are you really worried about getting around THAT fast with it?   Strike, it could separate into parts sorta like the Victory. Last I knew it's parts could fold and transform sorta like the Victory as well."
Gundam,32rdv1,ExpiredSushi,3,Thu Apr 16 06:31:15 2015 UTC,"I've not seen a MS transform and move at the same time.     One example off the top of my head would be the Asshimar. I think you're mixing up transformation and stock footage.     you'd carry spare parts and not just whole other units     Thats the whole point of the core fighter system. It can eject from damaged parts, get new ones and continue fighting. In Victory, its shown to be incredibly useful because Uso repeatedly has to replace damaged parts. Also because they were fighting with significantly low numbers, they needed their pilots to survive. It transforms so it can still function if missing a crucial part. A Flying Torso is hardly aerodynamic, but if its in a jet-shape, it can still serve as an enlarged core fighter with a beam shield and beam rifle instead of just vulcans.     ZZ     ZZ is probably one of the weakest examples. You are right in that the individual parts are weak, and it doesnt have the excuse of being modular like Victory. It has an interesting idea, but poor execution. There's a reason that later on Judau is the sole pilot.     Sentinel     How the sentinel transforms is a mess, but its important to know that in the novel it functions as the head of a taskforce with Zeta escorts which would rush to their targets. Its also more of an artillery suit, but the pilot was a hothead who kept getting it into close range engagements. Also, what does being in space have to do with not needing speed? When is there any reason to not want your suit to be able to go faster?     Strike   Um, I think you're confused. The only ""transformations"" it had were switching backpacks and I guess using phase-shift armor. Both of which had purposes."
Gundam,32rdv1,CrashmanX,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:58:36 2015 UTC,"One example off the top of my head would be the Asshimar[1]  . I think you're mixing up transformation and stock footage.   Admittedly I had not recalled this scene. As far as mixing up, no. There are few examples I can recall of a mobile suit moving and transforming at the same time.   Thats the whole point of the core fighter system. It can eject from damaged parts, get new ones and continue fighting.   In real combat that doesn't make any sense though. In anime sure, it works. But in real combat, no that'd be ridiculous. You wouldn't carry just torsos and legs and not carry the cores. You'd have extra cores so you could fleet multiple people. Only once you're out of cores would you worry about using the extra parts as repair parts to be swapped out. Otherwise you want as many fighters out as possible.   It transforms so it can still function if missing a crucial part.   It would still be able to function without transforming though. If it can function without the part by transforming, that means it can function without it without needing to transform. It'd make much more sense if they had to swap singular limbs at a time, not entire sections of the unit.   Also, what does being in space have to do with not needing speed? When is there any reason to not want your suit to be able to go faster?   When you're not deployed to a large theater of battle. When you're fighting area is smaller there's no need to be this massive block that has to travel huge distances. As seen with many mobile suit encounters it'd be far less advantageous to have this block that can move fast and get in range compared to just having a mobile suit with HUGE weapons that can fire from nearly anywhere, as seen by the Sentinel's later upgrade The Deep Striker. Which admittedly has HUGE thrusters, it also carries HUGE guns to hit from long range without needing to get up close.   Um, I think you're confused. The only ""transformations"" it had were switching backpacks and I guess using phase-shift armor. Both of which had purposes.   I might be. Though I could've sworn the Strike had extra tops and bottoms which were carried on the ship much like the Victory Gundam. I know there was at least one unit in SEED which could do that.

Zeta Messala    Yes, they sometimes do it when standing still, but they also transform while moving.     You'd have extra cores so you could fleet multiple people.     In Victory Gundam, they lacked pilots in the beginning. They had all the spare parts because they knew the suit would get damaged. As long as the core fighter survives, they can deploy new parts to keep fighting. By the end of the series they have at least a dozen Victory Gundams because they have more pilots at that point, as well as more support. The League Militaire were barely surviving for the longest time, their numbers were small.     It would still be able to function without transforming though.     And it does But it also takes advantage of the jet design The Victory is strong because of how versatile it is     just having a mobile suit with HUGE weapons that can fire from nearly anywhere     So instead of having the option of being mobile, they should just focus on being a drifting turret? The Sentinel doesn't have defense mechanisms to protect itself like an I-Field, so its best bet is to try and evade. Also, by transforming it redirects its thrusters giving it maximum speed to either get closer to (ill-advised) or AWAY from enemies.     I don't think it was the Impulse.     The only modular suit in CE I know of is the Impulse, which uses both a modular system and a backpack system."

Gundam,32seam,Thetiz,3,Thu Apr 16 09:42:17 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he's a Gundam SEED fan, so I would suggest sticking with a High Grade kit from that series.  It will say on the box what series it's from, or you can use a site that lets you search by series, such as:  http://www.gundamplanet.com/gundam.html?cus_grade=146  That's probably a good place to start, but if you can't find out which mobile suits he likes you might want to consider getting him a gift card to somewhere like this.  It might be that he hates Gundam SEED but just really likes the Destiny Gundam, or you might happen to grab the one mecha he doesn't like, that kind of thing.  Even narrowing it down to High Grade kits from that one Gundam series, there's still 26 to choose from just from that link, so if you're unsure it can be easy to grab something he won't like.  Then again, some folks are just happy to get more gunpla, and won't particularly care what they get as a gift.  :D"
Gundam,32seam,PirateLincoln,3,Thu Apr 16 10:04:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, and ""grade"" is how Bandai sorts the level of complexity of the kit, I guess is a good way to put it.  High Grade is 1/144 scale kits, Real Grade is 1/144 scale kits with better detail, Master Grade is 1/100 scale kits with about the same detail as Real Grade (but obviously larger), and Perfect Grade is 1/60 scale kits with tremendous detail.  ...it's actually a bit more complicated than that, because of things like older Master Grade kits being kind of terrible, or kits from certain series being poorly made, but that's the basics."
Gundam,32seam,PirateLincoln,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:06:55 2015 UTC,"yea my friend was telling me how he really liked building the one that is a bit hard to build. I checked your link and I was surprised on how cheap they are, because the hobby store I went to had sets around 70+ AUD.   and also he has 'ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam', could you tell me what grade that is? because ill most likely get him one on the same line of grade as that one."
Gundam,32seam,PirateLincoln,2,Thu Apr 16 10:13:48 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, at those prices, he probably bought this kit:  http://www.gundamplanet.com/mg-zgmf-x42s-gundam-destiny.html  Which is a Master Grade, as are these:  http://www.gundamplanet.com/gundam/master-grade.html?cus_series=26  Amusingly, they actually have more Master Grade kits from this series than they do High Grade.  That usually isn't the case."

Also good eye, I've always like the look of the Strike Freedom, myself.  To be very honest, though, I'm not very familiar with Gundam SEED at all, and I'm only familiar with a few High Grade kits from the series, so it's possible that the Extreme Blast Mode is super-fragile or something like that.  My advice to you right now is to head on over to /r/Gunpla to ask about specific models, just to see if one of them is prone to having really bad production quality or something.  But, barring any bad news there, I'd say you've just about got yourself a good decision!"

Real grade High grade Master grade (has 2 versions)  High grade and real grade are the scale of 1/144 and master grade being 1/100. You can find out which is which by looking at pictures of each grade and version and seeing which your friend has.
Gundam,32seam,AkiZayoi,2,Thu Apr 16 10:24:24 2015 UTC,"Crazy idea, feel free to ignore. Instead of getting another model kit for your friend, what about a tool set? Really makes a difference in putting the kits together when you have the proper tools."

It was presenting in a beautiful way and as a fan of Gundam for similar reasons, I can relate to Al, appreciate the story, but also be thankful that it is only a fiction.  I imagine many other gundam fans feel a similar way about the idea when in Gundam Build Fighters this can happen:   Justified by Mr. Ral in Episode 6. People take Gunpla seriously because it's a hobby they don't have put their lives on the line for, unlike in the wars of previous Gundam shows.

Am I going to be the only person who can see this guy marching around in my hometown, always on the horizon?  ...I think I can hear a very, very distorted version of Tobe! Gundam  playing somewhere..."
Gundam,32svub,goodkid322,2,Thu Apr 16 13:19:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Generally if a pun/reference/wordplay in Japanese is that simple, then it's not a pun/reference/wordplay. There are just so many words that sound alike in Japanese that having ""Mariida"" likened to ""Marie da"" is of little literary value in that language.  Also, マリーだ it's much closer to ""I am Marie"" than ""to be Marie"". :)"
Gundam,32svub,DenkouNova,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:33:53 2015 UTC,Doesn't she show up in a series about Judau after ZZ?

Gundam,32qy50,nanobozz,2,Thu Apr 16 00:21:17 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the link! :D
Gundam,32qy50,Mayomori,2,Thu Apr 16 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"You can check out bato.to, it have most Gundam mangas over there."
Gundam,32qy50,Terminimal,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:34:04 2015 UTC,"We have this reference here for almost all the animations. Maybe someone should compile an equivalent list for manga. Not saying I'd have the initiative to compile it myself. Then again, I'm not saying I wouldn't. But I probably won't.  I can only find other people saying that a HF fan translation doesn't exist."
Gundam,32qy50,iceman_in_black,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:45:21 2015 UTC,Hathaway's Flash is apparently a tall order. The novels have been out of print for years and I've never been able to find a translation. I haven't looked in a few years but I haven't seen anyone post a link to a translation here either. I'd like to read it too
Gundam,32oe5e,ss977,3,Wed Apr 15 12:24:45 2015 UTC,Gundam Robin huh? I dig it.

Gundam,32oe5e,a_friend_of_yours,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:39:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'd love to make a gunpla out of this sketch too.
Gundam,32oe5e,space_noodel,2,Wed Apr 15 16:52:14 2015 UTC,Maybe you could try using a gm as a base and trying to modify the crossbones fullcloth armor plates to create a cloak like effect
Gundam,32oe5e,CitrusChrome,2,Wed Apr 15 17:57:56 2015 UTC,awesome! I love these games as well!
Gundam,32oe5e,MayBeANarc,2,Wed Apr 15 17:57:42 2015 UTC,Fan of ACE?
Gundam,32oe5e,Raptorianxd,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:23:40 2015 UTC,My friend used to have it and I would go to his place and ditch my friend to play ACE. I loved being Isamu.
