Honda,3e2msi,charlottechewie,5,Tue Jul 21 15:30:18 2015 UTC,I was thinking that. I'd have paid at least 2k for that camry  in a heart beat as long as there wasn't anything falling off. And I already have 3 cars.

Honda,3e2msi,pretends2bhuman,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought that too, but the impulsiveness of the situation was high lol. If I'd have left to sell privately first, I may not have gotten that ""end of month"" discount. They knocked off like 3K from the sticker so I was happy with the trade off."
Honda,3e2msi,Balls2TheFloor,4,Tue Jul 21 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"Fun story. My old car was crapping out on it's last leg (beat to hell 2001 Hyundai Accent with 190k miles) in April of '14 and they had not released the Si coupes quite yet. I didn't want a sedan which were available so I called nearly every damn dealer in Oregon/Washington and asked them all to call me when they got a coupe in. I got a call in early May and drove up to the Seattle area from Portland that day. Half way there I had to get gas and when I tried to start my car it started smoking and the engine just stopped. After about 20 minutes I was able to get her going and I left. The dealership stayed open late for me and had her ready so I took her for a quick test and then signed on the dotted line. They ended up giving me 500 for my car that barley got me to Seattle. I was just happy to be rid of the headache.  On an aside: The Dealership also tinted the windows, installed mudguards, door/window/handle cup film against my expressed wishes. The salesman that had this work done was not there so they tried to jack up the price. I literally had a 1 minute stare down with the manager after I told him that I would not pay for that crap and I would walk. Got it all for free and the car at a little better that our per-negotiated price +trade. The funny thing is, had I walked, I probably would have been actually walking at some point on that trip with my old car."
Honda,3e2msi,schlossenberger,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:56 2015 UTC,They gave you $1000 and sold the car at the price it should have been sold. They ripped you off. Like all stealerships do. Great choice on car though.
Honda,3e2msi,ktappe,3,Tue Jul 21 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"They gave him less than the value of the car but he didn't have to deal with the bullshit and haggling of selling it privately.  Think about it.  There's no easy private sales.  He'd have to list it online, meet up with how many people that may or may not be interested, and deal with a bunch of people trying to low-ball him.  I got less than I should have for my B16 Civic when I traded for my TL but at the end of the day my time was worth more than all that shit."
Honda,3e2msi,Balls2TheFloor,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"There's no easy private sales. He'd have to list it online, meet up with how many people that may or may not be interested, and deal with a bunch of people trying to low-ball him.   You forgot the hours of detailing to make it look good. I spent days cleaning my Civic when I private sold it. Then taking the photos in a nice bright but shady location, then editing them and posting them with the ad on Craigslist. Then answering calls...  Lot of work for not a lot more $.  EDIT:  Don't get me wrong; if you want $500 more, by all means, private sale it.  Just be aware it's not free money."

Honda,3e2msi,BryceSoFresh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"Financing instead of leasing, but I got 5.9%. They had a special deal where new Civics were a better fixed rate. Meaning lower monthly payments."
Honda,3e2msi,Delux23,6,Tue Jul 21 20:11:40 2015 UTC,meaning it takes longer to pay off and you pay more over the length of the loan. low monthly payments = they make shit tons of money and you make lots and lots of low monthly payments.  if you aren't making double payments every month they're hosing you down.

Honda,3e2l72,bradlee92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:14 2015 UTC,Can you be more specific when you mean burp out from thw system? Also should I buy something to flush the new one?
Honda,3e2l72,WaltMitty,2,Tue Jul 21 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"Burping the system is done by topping off the radiator with coolant and letting the car run with the cap off. As the water pump moves coolant through the system, air bubbles will rise to the top. Add coolant as needed, and as the pressure starts to build as the engine gets up to operating temp, put the cap on. You shouldn't need to buy anything to flush the system. The shadetree mechanic way of getting old coolant out of the engine is to shove a garden hose into the upper water pipe while disassembled, letting the fresh water flush out the old stuff. But some will argue that you shouldn't use tap water in the cooling system. Hope that helps."
Honda,3e2l72,draven501,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:40 2015 UTC,Topping off while the car is running will get most of the air out of the system but to get that last bit out you often need to open the bleed valve. It's small and you open it just a little until air and then coolant sputters out. If you have trouble taking the lower hose off of the radiator it might be easier to remove that hose from where it connects to up top and then remove the old radiator and lower hose together. Then move the hose to the new radiator while they're still out of the car.

There's probably a video for your specific car since they're so common, even if there isn't the process is pretty much the same for basically every car so another video would show you enough to know how to do it.

Honda,3e1299,Tang87,2,Tue Jul 21 09:51:47 2015 UTC,"I am planning on the same type of setup, actually.  From my research an H22 will probably be the easiest, and most efficient.  There are so many flavors of H22 though, however, I am keeping my eyes open for this one (From wikipedia): ""Found in the Japanese 5th gen 1997-2001 Prelude Type-S and SiR S-Spec (BB6). It produces 220 PS (162 kW; 217 hp) @ 7,200 rpm & 163 ft·lbf (221 N·m) @ 6,500 rpm and comes with a red valvecover.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_H_Engine  I am lucky where I live though, as there is a JDM Engine reseller just a few miles away!"
Honda,3e1299,remotelove,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:49 2015 UTC,"Fyi make sure you don't get the Type-S H22 because it was equiped with the ATTS system while on the other hand the SiR S-Spec comes with a LSD transmission. I don't think you can get the ATTS system to work in a swapped car unless you get all the sensors needed and such, but I could be wrong. In the long run though it would be easier and cost you a lot less to swap a engine without the ATTS system, for example the engines that were equiped with ATTS have a different block and can only be mounted to transmissions that run with the ATTS unless you get an adapter plate for them to mount together (which I don't think anyone sells anymore). However a H22 that didn't run with the ATTS can be mounted to any H22 transmission, and it's also a little easier to work on a H22 without the ATTS whether when it's a repair or modding it."

If so, you can buy a new one for $20 and the male end that connects to the radio. If you bought it from Best Buy, ask them to look at it. I was a Best Buy installer and didn't mind looking at someone's radio if they asked. If you aren't comfortable doing it yourself, pay extra and have them do it.

Honda,3dyunk,brokenmike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:00 2015 UTC,It definitely could. They recommend 7 years because after that it's a crapshoot. There's no way of guaranteeing the belt after that due to unknown conditions. Cold/hot weather make it worse. Did the last person who changed it get oil or coolant on it? Was the belt sitting on a shelf for 6 years before it went in? These are things you can't know. That's why it's 7 years or 90k

Honda,3dyunk,pussydrip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:11 2015 UTC,"It's probably sound advice to change it even sooner than 105k, but the automakers were all pressured to push out the official interval to greater than 100k to gain favorable ratings with consumer reports.   That being said, I changed the belt on my '97 at around 105k/8 years and then never again. I sold the car last fall with almost 360k total, so about 250k/10 years on the belt. I don't think those results are typical. But then again, most people don't bother at all with the timing belt and you don't hear about too many failing."
Honda,3dyunk,Wolf3188,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"I would do it soon. Theoretically it could last quite a bit longer, but changing them is a hell of a lot cheaper than fitting another motor when it snaps."

The car has had regular maintenance done, everything typical for that year and mileage. Timing belt, water pump, radiator, spark plug wires, distributor cap etc.   Not sure when Honda switched to timing chains instead of belts in their 4 cylinder motors. But that would be one of my first bits of info to look for in your case.   Just don't expect the CR-V's AWD to take you in and out of deep snow by itself.

Depending on which way they go, they could either tune it up to Si levels to compete with or replace the current K24 engine, or they could leave it low power to replace the R18 engine. For example, Fiat Abarth has a 1.4L Turbo that makes 160HP/170 ft lbs tq. That would be a pretty slick upgrade over the R18's numbers, assuming they could produce equivalent gas mileage.  One theory that's also been postulated on this subreddit was that Honda could potentially put the 1.5L Turbo in the Si, and make the Type R their headliner, thus creating 3 levels of performance for the Civic."

Most of this is arbitrary since a regular seller wouldn't tell you, but: how often was the oil changed, filters, belts, other fluids. Any major parts changes (head, gaskets, transmission parts, etc). How is the body? (Paint, rust holes, scratches). How about the suspension/brakes/wheels/tires? Just based on mileage, age and assuming it's running well, $1000 isn't really out of range, but again, this is based on some very loose information."

I mean, there isn't even the DIY payoff with an oil change...nothing to see or feel like doing the brakes or exhaust or something."
Honda,3dycvt,Aphoristics,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:22 2015 UTC,20 dollar change? That's some shady shit
Honda,3dycvt,MikeyDeez,2,Mon Jul 20 18:03:11 2015 UTC,Not really; Firestone sends out coupons quarterly.  That's how much it cost for a Civic; something like $35 regular.
Honda,3dycvt,koukiecutter,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'd rather change my own oil than have some scumbag change it at a $20 place.   Then you have them trying to get you to flush all your fluids, buy wipers etc. and you constantly have to say 'no' 20 times.   And the DIY payoff is doing something with your hands. If you don't see the payoff in that alone you're a goon."
Honda,3dycvt,MikeyDeez,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"I'll change my own; my car is lowered, rims expensive, and the hybrid aspect requires ""special"" oil.  However, I'm not going to take the time to put my gf's civic on jacks and cleanup my garage floor afterwards.  The local shop doesn't hassle me for an oil change and tire rotation.  I'm not a ""goon"" because I don't like changing oil; I can and do.  I just also value my time; a simple oil change just to save $5 or $10 and say ""I did it"" isn't worth it. I could be riding my bike, mowing my lawn, starting the cabinet project, etc...  I see where you're coming from though."
Honda,3dycvt,aykalper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, you do save when the dealer strips your oil pan, or lugs, or for that matter, anything they touch.

Honda,3dx3nx,iDriiven,2,Mon Jul 20 14:18:22 2015 UTC,"Took this from an Accord forum: ""While the I4 cars certainly have their share of (4AT) tranny issues, it is the V6 cars that are most troublesome. The V6 cars are notorious for 2nd-gear clutch pack failure and differential carrier bearing failure, especially 1998-through-2001. 2002 MIGHT be slightly better, but I have no evidence.  Typical Problem Symptoms: Flaring (slipping) between up/down shifts, esp. on 1st/2nd and 2nd/3rd gears; leaking ATF (indicative of blown axle seals, which fail when the carrier bearings fail); unusual shifting patterns (e.g., jumping from 4th gear to 2nd gear); and failure to go into any gear. Also ""D4"" indicator is blinking on the instrument panel, typically indicating a PCM error code...just to name a few issues."""

At the mileage your car has, it's either imminent or has already been taken care of.  Transmission issues aside, at 175k, the engine should be good for another 80-100k easily (provided it was maintained decently and you maintain it well).  Welcome to the club!"

Honda,3dsiim,lxndr95,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:32 2015 UTC,Nice. I just bought an 05 about a month ago and wanted to get back into modding.   How was the reflash? You just sent them your ecu with your mods and they tune it for you?
Honda,3dsiim,mohjustin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's a sort of ""one size fits all"", but works well with CAI and exhaust.  If you have race headers there's a different reflash for that.  If you do anything more, it's best to go KPro."
Honda,3dsiim,downvotebot31,2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:41 2015 UTC,I like it minus the dragon too. That color is pretty though.
Honda,3dsiim,PassionateFlatulence,2,Sun Jul 19 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's fucking awesome. The taillights and the Dragon emblem are actually relatively tasteful and give it more if an artistic flair than a ricer one.  Everyone here needs to realize that there's only so much innovation you can do with the typical stock look everyone says you need. And the RSX isn't far enough along in its existence that people start turning their cars back to stock.  You do you, OP. And tell everyone else to pound sand.👍"
Honda,3dsiim,eddiegratis,3,Sun Jul 19 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"Color is really nice and clean but not feeling the shitty altezza taillights at all, shame to see such a clean car ruined by tackiness, same with the dragon lol may as well throw up some MLP shit while you are at it."
Honda,3dsiim,eddiegratis,2,Sun Jul 19 07:47:02 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for that unicorn/dragon and those tail lights (please, oem is just much nicer), I'd give this a 10."

Honda,3dte4c,Poor4Life,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:17:34 2015 UTC,You must of been comparing the 2WD 6MT which is Manual Transmission to an AWD CVT Transmission.  The 2WD CVT get better fuel eco than the 4WD CVT.  The Real Time AWD has been around for years now in the Honda World. Ive taken All the Honda Models that has RT AWD in the snow and in the rain and it worked great! (Seattle Native)  BTW I work for a Honda Dealership :)
Honda,3dte4c,alphanu22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:31:41 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the RT AWD is basically 2WD until the vehicle detects that it is in a slide. At that point it determines how much power to send to the rear wheels to stabilize. It will even send power to just 1 wheel if its needed. It's not like Audi and Subaru who have full time AWD."
Honda,3dte4c,jordanvacc13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:50:37 2015 UTC,All is true except for send power to 1 wheel. Sends power to both rears but send more to the others if one is slipping-

You can also control music from the touch screen which displays navigation. When you're parked, you can mirror your phone display onto it so YouTube, your phone's videos, etc. (if you're waiting on someone) can be viewed simultaneously by multiple users. IIRC, not a whole lot more than what I mentioned unless I missed something entirely."

Honda,3dpxsx,domo-saur,6,Sat Jul 18 14:57:31 2015 UTC,Does the V6 have a 'hard hitting' VTEC similar to the 4bangers? I thought it was only a 4 banger engine thing to conserve fuel and have performance when needed
Honda,3dpxsx,supercrossed,3,Sat Jul 18 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"That 'kick' that you feel when it hits a certain RPM range is when the cams are changing to a different profile. Generally, you won't get as much of a 'kick' with i-VTEC than with old school VTEC. Also, with the Hondata reflash you will lose the 'kick' feeling because their maps/timing have been adjusted be more efficient and smooth compare to factory. But it is because of the sensation of that power dip and a sudden surge of power that makes us all think that VTEC is god-like."

Honda,3dsvsj,Keiththesneak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:44:25 2015 UTC,Well the manual doesn't say that I need to use any special gas. The reason I got it was so that I can use non-premium or cheap gas and then for better mileage. They are kind of shot down the drain with better or premium gas. I think it's wierd too that it behaves this way :) Maybe they swapped the parts from some other car by mistake at assembly line .. haha...

Honda,3dqog0,the_crx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:05:09 2015 UTC,Is the buckle itself dirty?  Does the light on the dash come on as well as the chime?  If everything is plugged in correctly maybe try spraying some compressed air into the buckle to clean it out.
Honda,3dqog0,556x45mm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:26:57 2015 UTC,My husband unscrewed the plastic off the buckle and said that the switch is completely messed up. Everything is plugged in and the seat belt light comes on but no other lights. He believes its just the buckle. He tested the cable with a multimeter and the connection is fine according to him.
Honda,3dqog0,556x45mm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:50 2015 UTC,Well if it is indeed the buckle the part shouldn't be too expensive.  This site is showing $52 + shipping for the buckle.  If you don't feel comfortable doing the work though I suggest taking it in.  Small things like installing a radio I would say go for it and learn but safety equipment MUST be done correctly.
Honda,3ds66v,lazyhl1994,2,Sat Jul 18 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"The switching is a myth. As long as you use the same weight like 5W-20, it wont matter what flavor. I would say though to use at least syn blend. That and full syn are a bit more refined and ""cleaner"" than conventional."

Honda,3ds66v,brokenmike,3,Sun Jul 19 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"Only benefit of synthetic over regular is going to be increased oil change intervals.  Pick a good brand and use the correct weight and you'll be fine.  I happen to like mobil 1 and pennzoil.

Honda,3ds66v,556x45mm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:49 2015 UTC,I'd just like to add that synthetics have better thermal properties. But that doesn't really matter unless you're racing the car.
Honda,3ds66v,brokenmike,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:12:36 2015 UTC,"True, syn will hold up better than dino.  I'd say racing and towing would be good applications.

Honda,3dokge,brokenmike,2,Fri Jul 17 23:57:20 2015 UTC,Cold air intake that's all. Soon to be header and cams thinking skunk 2 stage 2 cams also its just a skunk 2 muffler
Honda,3dokge,MikeyDeez,7,Sat Jul 18 01:29:56 2015 UTC,For the love of God make sure no water can splash onto that cold air intake filter. Buddy of mine lost his B20Z swap that way. Header is a good upgrade but I would skip the cams. They really don't do much and I wouldn't mess with them unless I was doing a full rebuild or boost. Matter of fact a Stage 2 cam with a stock bottom end can rob you of power and make the car run like shit. Your also going to need a tune with new cams and those can get pricey.  You could swap to Type R cams but even then you would need a tune. My advice is get some headers and enjoy the car as is. The GSR is a blast on curvy back roads with the stock power. If you want to you could save up for a full NA or boost build for the future.

I didn't say it was bad or good exhaust systems aren't huge...I wouldn't run an exhaust at all on a track car.  However, for a daily driver, I don't like fart cannons.  For example, I upgraded my ZF1's exhaust, but kept a dolphin tip style muffler rather than go with a large 3"" cannon.  It just looks a little more mature; I think."

Honda,3dmv4k,PaperScale,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"Typically for something like this the customer will get their insurance company involved.  Not sure if they will cover this but they usually do when someone fills their car with diesel or something stupid.    Then the insurance adjuster will want to pay the tech times comparable to factory warranty times which are beyond ridiculous.  Then the adviser will argue for more time, the adjuster will cry, wrong parts will be ordered and the technician will be screwed.    I'd guess time to do the head liner and door panel would be around 5-6 hours of labor give or take.  The side curtain air bag not much more once you have the headliner down.

Clubrsx.com, clubep3.com, honda-tech.com  The axles should fit, but I'm not sure if the type r header will clear the Si sway bar. On Dc5's we have to change the sway bar. The JDM header is a different design completely, did you get the exhaust manifold included with the purchase?   Yes there should be a vin number on the block and trans. Should just be k20a if it's legit JDM   The wiring ""loom"" should be the entire engine harness. If you are thinking of splicing it, have fun with that headache & electrical problems for the rest of the cars life. Don't mess with that shit. Make sure it comes with full oem wiring harness"
Honda,3dmliu,justind2473,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I have been looking at the forums, but there is some conflicting information, and I was hoping to find someone who had actually done the swap, or personally knew something about it.  The swap does include the exhaust manifold, intake manifold, throttle body, full serpentine system, etc.  It is definitely a legit k20a.  I am thinking I will just order the Type R sway bar as I am sure the Si exhaust manifold will be restrictive.    I will call and look further into the wiring harness to make sure it has not been cut.  What the guy at the shop who is selling it told me, is that it was uncut up to the dash ( or something along those lines).    Here are the pictures provided by the seller:  Pic1 pic2 pic 3 pic 4 pic5 pic 6 pic 7 pic 8 pic 9"
Honda,3dmliu,justind2473,3,Fri Jul 17 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"It's missing the extremely important bottom section of the exhaust manifold.  Without that you cannot use it, you're going to have to run an aftermarket header, which i would suggest you do anyways."

Honda,3dmliu,calpal348,5,Sat Jul 18 16:36:19 2015 UTC,"Are you in the USA ?   The Ep3 axles work just fine.  You can't use any part of the JDM exhaust manifold/header.  You either need to use your stock stuff (very restrictive on the k20a motor) or please go by a good race header for this setup. You won't regret it.  As for the wiring (loom). You can re-use your entire stock engine harness (USA version for sure, I don't know about EU).  You just have to re-use your Throttle body off your stock engine because I believe the TPS plug is different on the JDM TB.  But ALL of the other plugs line up and plug in perfect.  You don't even have to take the wiring harness out of the car.  You just unplug everything that is attached the motor/trans and leave the harness hanging in the engine bay when you pull the old motor out."
Honda,3dmliu,3v3ryd4yw1nn1n6,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"This is what I have been wanting to hear, have you seen this swap done?  From other places I have looked, I can use the stock k20a exhaust manifold if I get the type R front sway bar, and an RSX-S midpipe to match the header to the cat.  I will have to see which option is cheaper.    I do not plan on doing a cat back exhaust anytime soon, as I really hate loud exhaust on Hondas.  I would rather lose a few hp, and not feel like a complete tool driving around town.  I am interested in finding a less restrictive exhaust down the road, but I will want it to be quiet. I have seen some mufflers that have a butterfly valve that acts to either allow the exhaust to exit like a straight pipe when open, or diverts the exhaust through the muffler chambers when closed.  This seems like a good concept.    Are you certain that the stock Si harness will fit everything?  I have heard it will, and then I have heard that it won't.  I will definitely compare the two when I get the motor to my home, but this is a ""looming"" question (ha see what I did there?)  If you have done this before, please let me know.  I really hope your right, as this will make the swap a breeze."
Honda,3dmliu,justind2473,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"And yes, I am in the USA"
Honda,3dmliu,calpal348,5,Fri Jul 17 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"I have done this exact swap (k20a type r into an ep3. along with many k24 swaps into Ep3, Ek, Eg, DC etc.).  The problem with the type R exhaust manifold isn't the sway bar...it's the fact that it's an entirely different design.  The USA one has all 4 pipes coming off the merged into 1 collector where the catalytic converter bolts on.  The JDM one has 2 separate collectors with 2 pipes each.  And 99% of the time you only get that first piece with your engine that is bolted to the head.  You don't get the matching 2nd piece that bolts to that.  And even if you did, it would be right where your US Catalytic Converter would go.  If you are not worried about emissions (or it's legal in your state), i recommend getting a Race Header.  It replaces the stock exhaust manifold AND the catalytic converter and bolts right to the mid pipe.  Even a relatively inexpensive DC Sports race header with a RSX type S mid pipe and EP3 muffler sounds very nice and doesn't completely choke the motor of all it's top end power."
Honda,3dmliu,w00t692,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, I see what you are talking about with the header having two collectors.  I do have to have my catalytic converter, but I do not have to pass an emissions test (VA).     So I am looking at headers now, and some say that they will work with the k20a2/k20z1 motors only.  I would think it would be the same for all k20 heads would it not?  Would a header made for my car stock (k20a3) fit on the k20a?  I have someone who is an expert welder who can help me make something work, but I would like to have everything bolt up if I can."
Honda,3dmliu,w00t692,3,Fri Jul 17 18:12:15 2015 UTC,Buy a header for an RSX type S and then get the type S mid pipe and everything will fit fine. It's the end of the header at the mid pipe that's different...and the diameter of the pipes. They are all the same at the head.
Honda,3dmliu,3v3ryd4yw1nn1n6,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"How restrictive do you think the stock k20a3 exhaust manifold would be?  I don't really care if I lose a few hp, but I need to have this project completed in a fairly tight time frame.  If it's a matter of losing 10 hp and saving $600 I will probably go that route for the time being.    What about an rsx type s manifold?  If I can find one in a junk yard, or ebay or something,"
Honda,3dmliu,justind2473,2,Fri Jul 17 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"A header for k20a2/z1 will fit the k20a. People can even put a race header on the k20a3 as long as it's paired with a cat back exhaust. I would say just stick with your usdm header, cat, and cat back if you want to keep the tone down and not have a loud exhuast. Sure, the new type r motor would LOVE an open race header with no cat, but if your wanting to keep it mild then just stick with the current exhuast. I had a lot of fitment issues with my race header on my k20a2 running against my sway bar. Tried 3 different sway bars. Pain in the ass  Also the noise was significantly louder. I paired the race header with an Invidia Q300 cat back exhuast and it sounded amazing tho"
Honda,3dmliu,3v3ryd4yw1nn1n6,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"thanks, this does seem like the most reasonable answer.

Honda,3dkhjk,90preludeLad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"It is, if your a professional bodyman and skilled at reshaping metal.  My 2 cents, raise it up a little bit, take it to the body shop and have them fix it.  From what i can see in the pic, it looks creased.  Nothing you can roll back out.    Might be cheapest to go to a junkyard, find a totaled 8th gen with perfect quarters, cut out the wheel arch and take it to the bodyman and have him/her weld in the section then spray it.  Bottom line is quarter panel repair is expensive to have it done right, lots of labor hoours involved unlike slapping on a new fender for example."

Completely cut out the arch, rewelded in fresh metal and shapped by our local hotrod/body shop (extremely talented guys).  I had sticker shock when I got the original quotes, not going to lie.  Expect to see figures around a 750-1000 (ballpark) a side (my paint is a bit more expensive then the original honda light blue of the early 90's so your cost might be a touch lower).    Also, make sure the guy you take it to is reputable and does quality work, it's ALWAYS worth the money to spend a bit more and do it right the first time.

Honda,3dleh5,redoctoberz,2,Sat Jul 18 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"Typically the way they are setup is they use little taps throughout your OEM harnesses relating to the OEM alarm system, so it ""piggy backs"" on top of it. You will have to find all the looms, and the relay, and unplug all of that. Personally, I remove all the splice connectors too, they typically look like this:   http://s468.photobucket.com/user/aacebaystore/media/DSC_0632640x486.jpg.html  You just want to unplug all of them, then take a paper clip and undo the ""clip"" portion with what remains on your car to remove the other half of the tap. If you cut the wire, you will have to solder and repair it, so be careful, don't rip.  The one thing you WILL have to resolve is they totally sever the starter connection in your OEM harness and put the rock-ledge alarm relay in between it. You will have to get some spare wiring, or a crimp connector, and re-join the two cut parts of that (typically yellow) thick wire. Soldering and using heat/shrink wrapping for this connection will be best. If you haven't done wiring work before this whole deal may seem daunting to perform."

Honda,3dixh7,Enesex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend skunk2 coilovers. I've never had them myself but all of my friends that decided to get them have complained that they rode too bouncy. Camber kits are a good idea but if you're short on money after getting coilovers then they aren't a necessity at first. Just make sure you get an alignment after you adjust the suspension because the toe will mess up your tires more than the camber will
Honda,3dixh7,Enesex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:25:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. Yeah my plan is to get them aligned at the same times as I get the coilovers installed. What suspension do you recommend? Other thank Koni/GC?
Honda,3dixh7,bawlzdeep665,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:31:27 2015 UTC,Function form makes decent entry level 1 piece coilovers. I had them on my 91 civic and they rode well. It depends on your budget and what kind of ride quality you're looking for. I've noticed that 1 piece coilovers tend to ride stiffer than coil/strut combos.
Honda,3dixh7,Keiththesneak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:10:57 2015 UTC,You won't need a camber kit at all on ef chassis you wont be able to go low enough for the camber to become an issue.

Honda,3dixh7,urbsallday,2,Thu Jul 16 22:09:15 2015 UTC,The ground control set up is VERY popular. If you're looking for budget coilovers the progress ones I mentioned early were super solid for the price but if money isn't an option I would probably go with ground control.
Honda,3dixh7,urbsallday,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:13:24 2015 UTC,Well money is always a consideration.

Honda,3dixh7,bawlzdeep665,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:07:38 2015 UTC,For coilovers the best imo are Koni/GC setup. But that will cost over 1k new. I've had nothing but good experiences with Megan Racing. Their EZ Street coilovers are 16 levels of dampening and ride height adjustable and can be had new for around $600. Just my two cents. Good luck and EF love.

Honda,3djfqu,acatnamedmooshie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:42 2015 UTC,With that much damage you're probably going to need a new radiator support but I can't tell. If you bought an aftermarket front end it may not line up perfectly but it'll save you a TON of money. Were you looking at buying new OEM bumper and hood?
Honda,3djfqu,Keiththesneak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:02:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd second that. Also if you are moving to a bigger city look for pick n pull lots. They are how I replaced a ton of body panels. And really we won't know how much damage until you take it apart and see what's broken and what can be reused.

Honda,3djfqu,Bensoe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:42:06 2015 UTC,How is your radiator sitting?  Does coolant circulate how it's supposed to? If you get a new hood will it close? Or will bent radiator support be in the way?  Will new bumper mount right on? Or sag and look janky? These are all questions to ask yourself. Most those parts you can find at a junkyard easy brother. I see eg models there all the time.
Honda,3djfqu,urbsallday,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:36:10 2015 UTC,You can get a new front end from certifit. My only concern would also be that radiator support. Might need a new one welded on.

I can connect my S5 to the car via BT, spotify will play and steering wheel controls/touchscreen controls all work, but no metadata shows up (unknown artist, song album etc.).  USB won't recognize the phone period, let alone play tunes.    Bummer it is THE ONLY gripe I have about my '15 Si, love every other thing about the car."
Honda,3dj4ar,unsulliedbread,3,Thu Jul 16 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd buy new if monthly payments weren't an issue for you both. The warranty is better, and a civic is a perfect commuter car that has stood up to its reputation since its conception. Just save up for a nice down payment and remember you're at a dealership. Haggle the shit out of the salesmen. All they want is the commission no matter how much money they knock off of the price. Good luck and good choice in vehicle. I'm not surprised the Ford shit out on you the quick. Ford does stand for Fix Or Repair Daily 😂"

I never ever thought I would spend $25,000 to $30,000 total (taxes, warranty everything) on a vehicle EVER so the fact that it feels like it makes the most sense is somewhat terrifying to me. Honda is clearly the best investment I could find and I'm happy to be joining the club even if I'll never join the racing love."
Honda,3dj4ar,urbsallday,2,Thu Jul 16 21:48:55 2015 UTC,It's really whatever fits your budget. A used Honda will be just as reliable as a new one. The only thing a new one has over it is the warranty from the dealership. You'll be happy either way.
Honda,3dj4ar,urbsallday,2,Thu Jul 16 22:48:29 2015 UTC,Your confidence in Honda is oddly reassuring from a random stranger on the internet. But seriously all the difference after looking at complaint forums to try and predict any possible issues.
Honda,3dj4ar,Alconicoffeine,2,Thu Jul 16 23:14:39 2015 UTC,Don't be reassured just by me but by a company who's reputation precedes it. I may be biased in my opinion because I'm a Honda boy but I'll be damned if it's not for a good reason. Hope you're happy with your new Honda! 😁

Honda,3dh90k,pureluq,3,Thu Jul 16 06:49:03 2015 UTC,KBB the car you're looking at to see its general worth. Then you'll have to have some knowledge on cars to determine the cars actual value. Has it been molested by some teenager slapping eBay parts on it? Has it acquired a bunch of rust from being in a crap part of the country? Etc. etc. these are just general guidelines. Specific examples may make it easier to help us determine worth and comparison.
Honda,3dh90k,BlindThievery,2,Thu Jul 16 12:25:04 2015 UTC,"They are not the most reliable Hondas out there but if they are properly maintained, they will serve you well. I paid 2800 USD for mine. It had 168k miles on it and had been neglected for about half of those miles. I have put about $3000 in parts into it and countless hours working on it. It's an easy car to work on which is nice although not quite as easy as an old Civic. My creaks and rattles but it handles pretty fantastically for a 3000lb FWD. I suggest test driving one before you buy it. It is a surprisingly long with a terrible turning radius and cramped interior. Most people love them nonetheless!"

I have owned a bone stock Type SH for over a year and all I have had to do to it is replace the A/C compressor and dryer, radiator, leaky power steering hoses, and have a timing belt service done. The timing belt service is very important (also pricey, $700) because if an old one breaks, the valves will hit the pistons and ruin the engine. My ATTS system works and I am planning to take it to my local Honda specialist soon to have the fluid in the ATTS unit changed.

Honda,3dc0qp,MouaTV,5,Wed Jul 15 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"well its a bigger motor to start off with. the motor in this one is the b series as the original was a d series. the biggest difference with b than the d is, the dual overhead cams. one for the intake and one for the exhaust. aswell as a bigger displacement. This has a 1.8 compared to the 1.5 and 1.6 they originally came with. Horsepower wise the d series could only make around 100 to 115 hp while the b series would pump out about 150 to 180 hp.

When my parents bought their Hondas, they were able to wiggle their way with negotiations. They'll most likely do it but it really depends on the salesman.  As for addons, I'm a tech guy, but I'd honestly wait to see if the 2016 Accord models will be getting the new infotainment system (hint... Android Auto).   IMO, the current infotainment system (especially on the accords) are lacking in comparison to what they are supposed to do: distractless console, but it does quite the opposite with crappy bluetooth and whatnot. Android Auto and Apple Carplay are going to change the industry and will end up the go-to in the future. If the 2016 models do have it, I'd think about it, but it really depends if you want to use Apple/Google Maps (the traffic especiallly) and other breakthrough technologies like OK Google and Siri."

Honda,3de9rk,ygguana,2,Wed Jul 15 19:34:25 2015 UTC,"Wiggle rooms depends on how easy it is for them to sell the car. If it's a car they can't keep on the lot then you're going to have a tough time negotiating.   If you're purchasing the car through a local credit union(not sure if they have them in Canada) they offer extended warranties for MUCH cheaper. I want to say my credit union offers it for $600 which I want to say bumps it up to 10 year bumper to bumper. The dealer costs is pretty high and you have to ask yourself what kind of issues would come up to justify that cost.   Ask if they can throw in a trunk tray because they are awesome. Some dealers include the cost in the price, some don't.   Make sure you are up to date and on time with the transmission fluid flushes as honda CVTs are known to be a little ""finicky"""

As far as value of the vehicle, there's a nifty website called Kelley Blue Book. They keep track of purchase prices, and give you a range of numbers that they think the vehicle is worth. Unfortunately, it's US-only.  For example, here's the Accord Touring. The website says the following about obtaining Canadian values:   Canada  You can obtain a report from a region in the U.S. that borders your own, but remember vehicles built for the Canadian market do differ from their U.S. counterparts in both the engines and optional equipment choices. You must also do a little math to convert the U.S. dollar values to your own country's currency.  If you would like an idea of the value of a vehicle in U.S. dollars in a nearby region, enter the ZIP code closest to your province.   Alberta --- Shelby, MT 59474 Atlantic Provinces --- Bangor, ME 04401 British Columbia --- Bellingham, WA 98226 Manitoba --- Fargo, ND 58102 Ontario --- Detroit, MI 48202 Saskatchewan --- Glasgow, MT 59230   I'd say $500 off MSRP is pretty stingy. KBB suggests that the vehicle's ""fair purchase price"" is actually below Invoice. I'm not saying you'll be able to get that, but I think you can do better than $500. Are there any other dealerships in the area you could talk to? Sometimes pitting them against each other works."

Honda,3dbsnm,Aggreshun,0,Thu Jul 16 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"A little late to the party, but here's my input: First, Honda would NEVER install a Frankenstein engine... EVER. Reason? They can't stand behind it's durability. (Frankenstein Engine = Head and block weren't intended to be mated together. ie. K20a2 head on a K24a4 bottom end.) That being said, The ""swap"" gave you more displacement, yes, but in reality I bet he only gained 20hp at the most. You also lost the true Vtec from not having the K20a2 head on the 2.4L bottom end. You don't get the 50* VTC camgear, so all the tuning that was done to the car had almost negligible gains. Intake, header, exhaust for mods is realistically only a couple thousand if he had bought some high end parts; Spoiler: He didn't. In my area in the U.S. this car would bring ~$6,500 because that's what it could be built for. Not to mention you'd get to make the choice of keeping true vtec and buying a quality Intake, Header, Exhaust combo. The only thing worth money in his car is the kpro, which he states is the full ecu, but I'm willing to bet it's just the Flashpro."
Honda,3dbsnm,brokenmike,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:39 2015 UTC,Who said it didn't have a k20a2 head?
Honda,3dbsnm,Aggreshun,0,Thu Jul 16 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"Jesus man. There's so much wrong with this post that I don't even know where to begin.   I know of Honda dealerships locally that have done k24 and k20/24 frank swaps. So that's wrong.  You just said it was a k20/24 frank swap and then go right into "" lost the true Vtec from not having the K20a2 head on the 2.4L bottom end"". So which is it? A k24 engine or a k20/24 frank? From the post it looks like a K20/24 frank setup which retains the 50* VTC. So that's wrong  You could build that car for $6500? So kpro $700+, header ~$350, exhaust $600-700, Injen intake $200, CRV block ~$500+a solid $1000 in labor, Stage 2 clutch $200+, Dyno tuning $300+, Plus whatever suspension mods were done to it. I don't know where you live, but I don't think you can pick up relatively clean RSX-S's for $2500.  Flashpro is not available for this vehicle. It's Kpro or a reflash, and you can't dyno tune or run a K24 on a reflash."
Honda,3dbsnm,brokenmike,0,Thu Jul 16 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Why act as if you need to be in attack mode? Nobody is attacking you.  I don't know why I am even bothering to respond... I stated Honda would not install a Frankenstein engine and then went on to describe what it was for those who don't know what Frankenstein means. I still stand by this, I know people that work at 3 local dealerships and the scoffed at the idea of Honda letting them do any work like that. Edit- just called Honda and spoke to multiple reps, I was reassured they WOULD NOT handle this type of work. I said he lost true vtec because he did not have the a2 head. Which I also still stand by because he claimed the work was done at Honda, -insert reiteration of previous comment-. All of which is also unverifiable as far as this is concerned.    Why is there a labor cost in a build? Take that $1000 labor, spread it between the ecu and shell and it's all completely plausible. Not to mention LKQ just had 50% off a couple of weeks ago, a buddy of mine walked out the door with a 63k miles 2.4L a4 bottom end for 208$. As for the suspension, if you weren't on your hate everything hiatus, you'd see above it was stated the car needs shocks and tires, so I'm guessing minimal, if any, suspension work."

I think it needs to be somewhere between Smart Car and Miata pricing. Because it looks a lot like someone put a Smart Car and a Miata in a blender. It's longer and wider than the Smart, but it's not as big (nor as powerful) as the Miata.  I watched a video on Youtube a while back where Honda had a track day at Tsukuba with S660s for the Japanese press to drive. The guy doing the video seemed very impressed with the car. But stock NB Miatas that were also on the track that day were whizzing past it like it was standing still.  I'm not a power junky by any stretch of the imagination. But if Miatas can walk right past it on the straights at Tsukuba, then there's no way I'd pay Miata price for it.  But if it were faster than a Smart, and priced similarly (sub $20k for a well equipped one) then I'd be very interested in it."
Honda,3dciyu,karmavorous,3,Wed Jul 15 17:28:42 2015 UTC,I  think they could easily enough enlarge the 660 engine to 1000 and turn up the wick on the turbo.  The only reason it outputs 63hp is because of kei car regulations.

Honda,3d9l7s,Professor_HollingsW,2,Tue Jul 14 15:55:59 2015 UTC,I don't own a prelude but did own a 01 civic ex a few years back. The same thing happened to me when I was driving and my car had to be driven back home under 10 MPH. I know it had to do with my timing belt or the harmonic balancer. Found out after taking it apart that my harmonic balancer was stripped where it connected to the crank shaft pulley end. The end of my Crank Pulley was stripped and broked off the small rectangle key that holds it together. If you want you can check that out. I ended up just selling my car after a good friend of mine who's a mechanic said that I would have to replace the whole crankshaft and then I can put a new harmonic balancer on it. Which wasn't worth my trouble and my money to take to the mechanic to fix it. Sold my car. Hopefully it isn't what I am thinking of. Good luck.

You have stated that it is your harmonic balancer that is the problem. Do you know for sure that the harmonic balancer is out of shape / out of balance? If it is the bolt that just came out, check to see if the threads in the crankshaft is stripped, which shouldn't be likely.(where the 19mm bolt holds the harmonic balancer to the engine) If you are certain the balancer is good to use, along with the bolt you can slide the harmonic balancer back on the crankshaft, align your key(very tiny metal piece that keeps the harmonic balncer from freely spinning on the crankshaft), and torque the used bolt to 159 ftlbs you can use oil or serviceable thread locker if you'd like. If you needed buy a new bolt, torque to 165ftlbs, loosen it slightly, and re-tighten to 159ftlbs.  Edit- It is unlikely you did any damage to the internals of your engine, or any real damage to the entirety of the car for that matter."

But the hb is still in shape with no damage and from what looks to me just needs a simple drive back on, of course with torque specifications. Both crank shaft and bolt threads don't seem to be stripped. So I'll get to putting that right back on and hope it was just some off weird flaw that just so happen to happen.

Honda,3dbbua,Johnny_Dangerously,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"If you have a tandem valve, that means you're still DPFI. If you want any sort of power gain, swap a D16a6 in from a 88-91 civic/CRX. That will keep you OBD0. It will require a minimal amount of rewiring and an ECU. If you can't find an a6, opt for something out of the 92-95 gen civics. You can run a D15b7 on an A6 ECU if you use OBD0 injectors.   Or you can just replace the valve ;)"

Honda,3d8v9g,MikeyDeez,6,Wed Jul 15 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"Toyota more exciting and innovative than Honda? Ohhhkay  The Camry is slower and gets worse mileage than the Accord, and it's basically the same story with a Corolla and Civic...but there are hybrid, natural gas and performance options for the Civic.  The Insight is more fun to drive than the Prius, and the Fit is a better car than the Yaris.  I'd put my CR-Z up in the fun/innovative fight against a TC (MotorTrend agrees) and the Si holds it's own against an FRS. I've never been in a Sienna but the Odysseys are bad-ass.   Mazda has been the most fun recently, but come 2016-17 Honda is shaking things up and I don't see Mazda excelling in innovation, and their reliability has a long way to go."

Honda,3d8v9g,MCHammer666,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:16:48 2015 UTC,"Good points. Let's look a little further, the new NSX is more exciting to me than the Lexus LFA and at a fraction of the price especially since from what I heard the LFA is underwhelming. Lexus has a slight advantage on the look of their cars. On the lower end of the spectrum. On the base models, Civic has beaten the corolla on looks for several years except for the recent revision corolla where where it's very close. The Civic Si takes the lead on the corolla S especially with the Aero Package. Oh man... Dat aero package doe...   I'm not sure how I feel about the new Type R not revving nearly as high as it's predecessors. I feel that's kind of what made Honda so fun."
Honda,3d8v9g,crmickle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:54:00 2015 UTC,"LFA is underwhelming   Wut? Have you heard/seen one in person. Videos and pictures don't do the LFA justice.   Type R not revving nearly as high as it's predecessors   It's not 1999 anymore. You're not going to see super high revving FI 4cyl cars on the consumer market. Personally, I would love a higher power FI motor that revs lower than a non-FI motor that makes lower power."
Honda,3d8v9g,SlumberMachine,3,Wed Jul 15 13:45:50 2015 UTC,"Haven't been a fan of much made by Honda since around the early 2000's, but I'm not really a fan of any cars since then so whatever.   I guess s2000s were stopped in '06 or so, so they at least had that going for a bit. I'd love for them to bring back the Prelude but with how ugly many of their cars have been recently I may prefer to have my BB6 be the final generation and legacy of the true spirit of Honda. Unless they put a turbo in it like the new Civic Type R... that I could get on board with."

Honda,3d8v9g,Confirmed_AM_EGINEER,2,Tue Jul 14 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"Several areas may lag, perhaps by design, but the trump card is reliability.  You won't see videos touting reliability over 15 years but that's a huge market segment and only Toyotoa comes close."
Honda,3d8v9g,Confirmed_AM_EGINEER,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:23 2015 UTC,Some of the smaller chassis Honda's here in Australia over the last 20 years have notorious transmission issues.
Honda,3d8v9g,Confirmed_AM_EGINEER,2,Wed Jul 15 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"The main point I took away from this is simply honda could be way better than it currently is and is considerably worse than it was 10 years ago. And its true, they have nothing that you cant find somewhere else for a similar price. In 2005 honda had the NSX, which doesn't need an explanation,  and it was great and one of thefastest cars you could buy for the price. The s2000, what other car revved out to 9000? What car does that now? It also looked the business,  which helps. And lastly, they had the weird as fuck two seater hybrid, the Insight, which is to this day rated as the most fuel efficient non plug in hybrid petrol car inthe united states. It also has a dashboard that would be very comfortable in a modern day car with no adjustments. It has a manual transmission,  certainly not a common hybrid feature. Then it has it's looks, it might not be aggressive or attractive but it does stand out from the crowd. But best of all, it is light, so it gets all of the benefits of being light and small, mainly, even though it has tiny tires, you can chuck it around most corners with confidence (it actually will lift off oversteer with the biggest god damn smile) and have fun with it.  I may be biased towards the insight, I own one and love it dearly.   So yeah, looking back, Hondas range the past decade has been rather shit compared to what it used to be."
Honda,3d8v9g,thebreadgirl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:05:58 2015 UTC,Feels like Honda went the way of Toyota. I'm hoping the new Civic R renews the market's desire for exciting smaller cars.
Honda,3d8v9g,Confirmed_AM_EGINEER,2,Wed Jul 15 00:21:46 2015 UTC,"I am also excited for the type r  but I am also excited to see if they will test the s660 out in other markets. I would be very excited for an s1000 or s800 like they did back in the day. Even better, if they took the s660 and shoved a cbr 1000rr engine in it, put in a roll cage, swapped the panels for naked carbon panels, put on the lightest alloy's they can find, a subtle aero kit, a little bit wider bodykit (2-3 inches total, a looked over mugen suspension,  and dual top exhausts to top it all off. And slap on a red carbon fiber and titanium honda badge for total 'we give zero fucks'. I know its dumb, and silly. But limit that production run to 100 units and even at 60,000 usd a peice I guarantee you they would be gone in a heartbeat. Call it the  Honda m1000 Carbon. I bet you could even get all of the engineers involved to volunteer their time on the weekend. Also, the team would be like 20 guys max. It isnt complicated really.  I know their racing team can do all of these things. Shit, just have the honda jdm racing team do it.   I know they would lose money on it, but what is 10 million in the eyes of 20 billion? And think of all the buzz it would generate. A shitload of buzz, thats what."

If this guy argued that the quality control has gone down since 2001 that would be debatable, but somewhat valid. Car companies stopped making pedestrian cars with lots of power like the integra and nsx because they followed the demographics of their market. The new ctr is proof that Honda hasn't lost their edge. (Let's see a corolla get a similar nurburgring time if toyota is so much more exciting.) Also as an American what is F1 and who the hell cares?"
Honda,3d8v9g,Keiththesneak,5,Tue Jul 14 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"As far as DI engines, and assuming you're right that Honda does have DI engines, I wonder if the situation in Australia is different?  And as far as the CTR - ok, they got that on paper. When is it launching? Is there any reason we should wait 1,2,3 years to get a car that will perform excitably well, when we can get one off the lot today from virtually any other automaker?  There has been an undeniable lull in Honda's game, and it's disappointing. The CTR may yet put them on the forefront, but that's neither here nor there.  ""As an American,"" who is into Japanese cars, it's unbecoming to act purposefully obtuse about the F1 racing class.

That mutual fund wouldn't be such a good idea then, would it?

Honda,3d4fnn,TurkeyPhat,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"For me the test drive made the HR-V win over the fit. It's just such a nicer experience. It's so much quieter in the HR-V than the fit, and if I need to trade a smidge headroom for it that's fine with me. I currently drive a CR-Z which gives me almost no headroom at all, so headroom doesn't bother me a bit."

If that's too small, the Civic will have a hatch next year. I don't see the need for the 'tweener... It's not Crosstour-level head-scratching, but it still doesn't make a ton of sense to me. Honda seems to be resisting the idea of an AWD car without an Acura badge. A vehicle doesn't have to have the ground clearance of a Jeep to benefit from AWD."

Honda,3d75oy,allmotorK20,3,Tue Jul 14 01:24:07 2015 UTC,All I'm gonna say is the higher your elevation the less octane you will need.  100 octane at 7500' should be just fine. Also to my knowledge leaded fuel is not nessecary for a b18c as its a post 71' motor.
Honda,3d75oy,damndirtydiesel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was thinking, but just wanted a second opinion"

Honda,3d75oy,damndirtydiesel,2,Tue Jul 14 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"I'm running 91 octane at the moment, I have 12:1 compression pistons, bored out, stage 2 pro series cams, and a full skunk 2 valve train, I'm currently running untuned on a chipped ecu, but am about to have it tuned. I'm trying to get as much power out of this all motor build, that's why I want something better than 91"
Honda,3d75oy,Impact240sx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Very nice. The only thing higher octane is going to provide you is resistance to pre-combustion/detonation, if your having issues with that running 91 i'd say go for it. Now 91 could possibly give you problems if the timing is advanced/retarded too much on the tune. Really it's going to be trial and error, and I can't pretend to know everything so take what I say with a grain of salt."

Honda,3d5jz2,siamonsez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"Has anyone check the EGR ports?  Are there any codes?  Is the EGR valve not working correctly?  EGR flow problems can cause all the symptoms you listed. If this is doing it at med to light throttle(when the EGR valve is trying to operate), it can cause this shaking. Checking the EGR VLS(valve lift signal) at idle with a scan tool would be the first step. It shouldn't be any higher than 1.20V. If it is higher the valve is sticking open. If the voltage is ok, remove the intake and check the EGR ports for clogging or partial clog.   The shaking the tech is observing while the car is on the lift with a load(I assume he is brake torqueing the car) can be normal.   If the EGR valve is sticking open, remove the valve, place a business card over the port and reinstall the valve. Test drive to see if the symptom goes away(don't leave the card in there though)  If the valve is not opening, replace it and test drive the vehicle. Usually it will set a code of P1491(valve lift) or P0401(flow prob). But sometimes it can be missed by the PCM."
Honda,3d5jz2,whatdhell,2,Tue Jul 14 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I don't know if they hooked it up to a scanner, there's no check engine light.  Can you explain the bit about the EGR valve and the business card again? I didn't quite understand.  It's a manual btw."
Honda,3d5jz2,whatdhell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:57:42 2015 UTC,"The EGR valve has two ports on the base of it. One where the exhaust comes into the valve and another that goes to the intake manifold. Remove the valve and you will see a large hole(exhaust) and a small hole(intake). Place the card over the intake hole. Then reinstall the valve. If the valve is leaking this will seal off the valve. If you drive it after you seal off the valve and the problem goes away, the valve is bad. Note that the gasket will not be removed for this diag process(it'll prob be in two pieces. Some on the valve and some on the mounting base. It's a metallic soft gasket). If the valve is slightly leaking, or not opening all the way the PCM could miss this fault but you could have the symptoms you described. Same goes for a partially clogged port(restricts the flow of exhaust into the intake). Exhaust Gas Recirculation is for emission purposes. By ""recycling"" the exhaust back into the intake a few things happen, including;  -Combustion temps are lowered -Unburned hydrocarbons are captured from the exhaust and reignited in the engine  This all helps reduce emissions(mostly NOx). Now if the PCM is trying to produce the EGR effect but there is a flow issue(from a faulty valve or ports), the A/F mix will be slightly off and can cause misfire conditions that cause the vibration. Normally the EGR system is turned on during low to mid engine loads.   I'm leaning towards this and not a suspension issue as you said the vibration is gone on decel, cruising, and coasting. If it was an axle/CV joint it would show up under heavy load more that med/light load.   A trans judder will usually be under light load and is not common at all with these cars. We see more of shift related issues(flare/delay/harsh shift).   EGR VLS at idle with a warmed up engine and a good valve will be 1.14V. MAP sensor should be no higher than 0.90V on a good engine. If EGR VLS is higher than 1.20V under these conditions then it's a place to look(high EGR VLS will decrease I take vacuum and increase MAP voltage). The business card is a good start. Now if you drive it with a scan tool you can see the EGR VLS increase as the valve opens. If the vibration is associated with this then it's prob an issue with the EGR system.  Hope this wasnt too long or confusing for ya."
Honda,3d5jz2,whatdhell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:43:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I haven't gotten a chance to try this yet, but wouldn't it present a specific RPM? I get the vibration a specific speed, 45-50 MPH, and it happens in every gear I can go that speed in. It also presents with any acceleration through that speed range, getting worse with harder acceleration."
Honda,3d5jz2,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:55 2015 UTC,The reason I'm leaning towards EGR is because it happens with a load. Give it a try and let me know. If it happens at any speed but 1/2 throttle or more then maybe a weak spark?  But from your description I feel like it's EGR.
Honda,3d5jz2,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"Shaking while accelerating is usually:   motor mounts (you have three other mounts) tires/wheel balance/alignment balljoints axles loose lugs/wheels   Admittedly, those cars (if it's an automatic) are known to have faulty transmissions and they do present themselves ~100k miles.

Honda,3d7do7,lazyhl1994,3,Tue Jul 14 02:27:56 2015 UTC,Use honda coolant. With the engine cold remove the radiator cap. Loosen the radiator pet cock(bottom of radiator). Let drain fully. Tighten pet cock. Fill radiator with coolant(a spill free funnel is a god send). Remove rad over flow and drain and fill it to the hot line. Run engine and let the radiator fans cycle on twice(a/c off). Remove funnel. Install cap.
Honda,3d7do7,whatdhell,4,Tue Jul 14 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"Good post. One of the things I also did was after removing the radiator pet cock is run a gallon of distilled water through (not tap water since mineral can harm the radiator) to flush it out more and get anything debris out. Also, when the radiator is full of coolent, run the car and watch the radiator coolent. It will start circulating and you'll need to add more until it is full while the car is running. Plus, squeeze the tubes that run to the radiator so you can let air bubbles out cause you don't want that in your radiator. Once all that is done, close the cap and turn off your car."

Honda,3d4uu3,notarapist72,2,Mon Jul 13 18:23:00 2015 UTC,I've seen forum speculation that the V6 might have direct injection and a corresponding power increase. Also speculated is that if DI is introduced on the V6 the 6MT version would likely either disappear or stick with the current multi point injection and have less crank output than the auto.  This was forum speculation and nothing more. I think something more official would have leaked by now if it were true.
Honda,3d4uu3,pussydrip,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:39:55 2015 UTC,What was the reasoning for a DI engine to not have a M/T?
Honda,3d4uu3,whatdhell,3,Tue Jul 14 02:48:16 2015 UTC,"I think it had to do with Honda not being able to meet, or not wanting to expend the effort and cost to certify all the government emissions bullshit. It seems like the forum boys are convinced the V6-MT is going to be gone by the next generation.  Reading through a little of the site posted by u/kk144, it looks like all the buzz is about the new color options."
Honda,3d4uu3,pussydrip,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"Emission would have little to do with the trans of an engine. The engine ran with a load will emit a certain amount of CO2, CO and NOx. The only reason I could see this happening is due to CAFE standards. Or customer demand(not just the enthusiast opinion. Which rarely gets the winning bid. See Acuras current lack of a m/t option)"
Honda,3d4uu3,whatdhell,2,Wed Jul 15 03:17:27 2015 UTC,Emission would have little to do with the trans of an engine.    Are you sure about that? This is contrary to lots of forum speak of why manuals are increasing frustrating to drive due to artificial characteristics like rev hang that the makers are employing to game the emissions testing.
Honda,3d4uu3,pussydrip,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:09:30 2015 UTC,Hmm. How would rev hang decrease emissions?  Wouldn't it have to use fuel to cause the slow Rpm drop?  Although I could see the fact that the manual trans usually has worse mpg than the autos therefore burning more fuel and putting out more emissions?  Now I want to go back and re-read the procedure for EPA testing of emissions on new cars. Good point.  Edit: Jesus the EPA page is a super hard read.
Honda,3d4uu3,whatdhell,2,Thu Jul 16 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"The ""why do they do it?"" section of this site has a pretty good detail on the typical explanation that I have seen.  I have no idea about the legitimacy of the claims, but it makes sense that a manual would have more dramatic changes in engine speed over an automatic without artificial throttle control measures in place."
Honda,3d4uu3,pussydrip,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:46 2015 UTC,That was great. So they do the rev hang because if you close the throttle suddenly you'll have some unburned fuel in the exhaust. Increased emissions. Great find!
Honda,3d4uu3,whatdhell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Pussydrip."
Honda,3d4uu3,whatdhell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:09 2015 UTC,Ok so after some reading(the EPA site is a tough read. I found http://www.allpar.com/fix/EPAMethods.html to be much easier) fuel consumption is almost directly related to the amount of emissions the car puts out(obvious). So you are right. Technically the M/T accord will put out more emissions than the A/T as the auto gets better mpg(this is mainly due to the lack of VCM cyl deactivation on the manual trans car). Interesting stuff and good catch.
Honda,3d4uu3,whatdhell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:33:24 2015 UTC,The model codes have been leaked out and there will be manual transmissions in both the coupe (I4 and V6) and sedan (I4)

You're much better off keeping the stock airbox and going with a down pipe and a flashpro combo right out the gate, get an e tune from Vit and work your way from there.   I'd recommend reading thru the n/a performance sections of www.9thcivic.com and www.9thgencivic.com.   Check out threads by VitViper and read about his experience with I/DP/E mods.

The answers to these questions will tell you where to go with your mods.  I have a 15 si that im tracking about 4 to 5 weekends per year so if that's your style  let me know.

Performance wise I haven't noticed much of a difference but good god it sounds amazing. I think a down pipe and full exhaust like the Nvidia N1 or Q300 are both good exhausts, I'll be purchasing the N1 shortly. A strut bar is a simple install that classes up the engine compartment and adds some rigidity to the steering. Also lowering springs or a full coilover kit if you can afford it. If not, lowering springs will do in a pinch. You'll definitely want to look into a hondata tune if you're going to start adding bolt ons. And you'll need one if you're going to start adding forced induction like a turbo charger or super charger."

If you are buying one with 120,000+ on it, make certain that the water pump and timing belt have been changed at 120k mi.

Honda,3d16pk,BlindThievery,2,Mon Jul 13 01:17:36 2015 UTC,"It's mostly a matter of angles. A legit conversion plate is going to be a bit thick (1"" or better). With that you have to consider the offset of the Style 5's, the stock offset and setup of your CB and additional lowering plans you have (camber, drop and potential fender rolls). If you've factored all of this in, that is honestly a great deal and would look great on the Accord. Plus, I'm pretty sure the Honda center caps are the same size so you could make it look legit.

Honda,3cy4xa,assholing,2,Sat Jul 11 20:54:28 2015 UTC,"250ml is about 0.25qts(US)?  How many miles before it consumes this amount?  I'm assuming it is consuming the oil as you state there are no leaks. If it is consuming 0.25qts between oil changes, that isn't anything to worry about.  Also- the distance between the upper and lower marks on the dipstick(measured when engine is warmed up) is about 1qt. All engines consume some oil. Older engines will consume slightly more oil than normal but this shouldn't be a concern. If you have no leaks, check the oil level when you fill up the tank and top off as needed."
Honda,3cy4xa,whatdhell,3,Sat Jul 11 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely in the habit of checking the oil level since my other cars are Subaru lol. Guess I'll continue to keep an eye on it. Not entirely sure how many miles and exactly how much oil I add since I'm no longer the primary driver of the car, I just maintain it. I see it at MIN level so I'd add like 250mL to get it slightly above that level. Between each oil change, I maybe add 1/2 qt. in total, guess that's tolerable though still annoying.  Thanks for the reply."
Honda,3cy4xa,highvolkage,2,Sat Jul 11 21:57:01 2015 UTC,"If you're really only adding 1/2 quart in between oil changes I would call that normal oil consumption for a vehicle of that age and mileage.

Honda,3cy4xa,foxwrites,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:23:34 2015 UTC,I know you said no visible leaks in the engine bay or under the car but I have two suggestions/questions. Both would not amount to a lot of lost oil though.   Do you change the crush washer on the oil drain plug when you do an oil change?  The valve cover cap on the passenger's side tends to drip oil after it wears out. Check for a black plastic circle just in front of the distributor housing.
Honda,3cy4xa,bigj231,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"Haha nope, and it's not even the correct OEM washer, it's a copper one off a BMW. Though the drain plug is clean as a whistle and shows no evidence of leak. I have not changed the washer in like 10 oil changes. I'll make sure to change it to OEM next oil change in October or so. Since I cleaned around the gasket I'll be able to tell a lot easier for leaks. Thanks for the passenger side tip, I'll keep an eye on it.   I've been monitoring the oil since I topped it off and it hasn't lost any yet as of making this thread."
Honda,3cy4xa,bigj231,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, good!   I suggested the crush washer change since I noticed my mom's pilot was dripping oil from the drain plug last time I changed the oil. Turns out I didn't replace the crush washer the previous time and my dad didn't mention changing it. Needless to say, the washer doesn't have to be the exact size (m14 for hondas), it just applies pressure to the drain plug so it can sit tighter against the pan.  The valve gasket cap (actually the cylinder head cap to be exact) is a $6 piece of plastic that can be replaced in a few minutes."

Excuse my arrogance, but if they manage to get in your car or open your hood hasn't the alarm already failed you? And I believe it was a option by Viper. I can't find it at the moment. But the set came with 2 remote keys. I believe you have to have the remote starter as well. But from my understanding was it couldn't be hot wired if the remote start wasn't within 15 foot of it.

Not sure what the 2015 comes with but you could put LED's in the interior lights, license plate lights, and possibly side markers.  Philips makes some very nice plug and play bulbs, just look up what size you need.  I would try to stay with bulbs 4500k-5000k so they don't look blue.  Nothing looks cheaper than some weird neon crap on your car.  How handy are you?  You could do a headlight retrofit although I can understand not wanting to chop up your brand new car.  If you do want to do this I recommend going with OEM projectors and not aftermarket.    Other than that wheels, but those are way over the $100 budget."

Honda,3cuci6,ygguana,14,Fri Jul 10 21:28:56 2015 UTC,"I graduate with a bachelors of science in electrical engineering in December (focused primarily on embedded systems and integrated circuits), but for the most part that isn't relevant.  I learned just about everything from spending time on forums and Googling problems and CEL codes.  I also talked to my uncle quite a bit about bodywork stuff, since he owned a bodyshop in the 90's.  In the case of the cold start, I beat around the bush and tried injector cleaner (no idea why I thought that would work), then changed the fuel filter (no idea here either), before noticing that the tachometer would go nuts while the car was cranking.  Eventually I stumbled across threads talking about how tachometer issues were generally related to a bad ICM, and that turned out to be it."

Honda,3cuci6,LazyPhoque,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"You can't really tell with the matte primer, but the bodywork is still pretty messed up in some places.

Honda,3cuci6,himself1892,7,Tue Jul 14 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"Do work son! Looking good! I miss my Teggy. I had a 94 Teggy LS 5 speed that was completely stock. I mean completely. The woman I bought it from had bought it from her brother who bought it new off the showroom floor.  They had every receipt for any service done to the car. I got it for $2000 with 214,000 miles on it. The only issues it had was the clear coat was gone and it needed a ball joint, but the interior was immaculate and it ran so beautifully that it felt like a brand new car. It got 35+mpg and beat up on riced out civics like it was nothing. I got a set of GSR fat fives for it for $100 from a friend and put a short ram intake on it. I left everything else stock and it handled so amazingly well. I ended up wrecking it with 260,000 miles on it. I cried, literally cried. I haven't owned a car since that even came close to the Teg.  That was 5 years ago now and I miss that car so bad. She was perfect. I think about my Teg everyday, I miss it so much. Teggy's are great cars man, I loved that thing."

My 'Teg has no rust but damn, getting some things loosened/removed in the engine bay is very, very difficult. Yeah, taking off the cover, the old belt and then reassembling is probably an hour, but that wasnt the whole job! I had power steering and A/C components to wrestle out of the way.  TLDR: I too had a long working period in regard to changing my Integra's timing belt."

Honda,3cuci6,carcrazy0214,2,Sat Jul 11 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"In my case it was because the mileage on the odometer does not reflect the mileage on the car.  The discrepancy is due to the car being stolen and then recovered without the cluster, then having a different cluster tossed in.  Ultimately not a huge deal, but I probably overpaid."
Honda,3cuci6,carcrazy0214,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:30:47 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. I was worried about my car for a minute there! I got my car from a used car dealer.

So my title says Mileage Exempt, but as far as I know it is all good.   Glad to see you saving that Integra.

Honda,3cqcby,budra477,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:01:31 2015 UTC,I had a 90 in the same color as my first car. LOVED. THAT. THING.   I saw one for sale the other day in white for $1500.. thought about it for a fun little daily beater. But it was too riced out. :/
Honda,3cqcby,InkedAlchemist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:27:48 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/ieE9zBA http://imgur.com/E0h4wzF I daily drove this 86 up until recently when I got my 07 si coupe.   Love the 3rd and 4th gens (had an 89 as well)
Honda,3cqcby,cash-only,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:01:34 2015 UTC,LOL the number of votes keeps fluctuating trying to stay at 88
Honda,3cqcby,wizardfingers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:57:38 2015 UTC,I love it! What year?
Honda,3cqcby,Typicaldrugdealer,5,Thu Jul 9 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"1988 civic LX, 250k miles. I've had it for 4 years. Only major repairs were front left brake caliper and a new ignition coil, which I did myself. Things solid."
Honda,3cqcby,tpwalsh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:31:05 2015 UTC,Good year. Japanese built and not annoying seat belts.
Honda,3cqcby,bcoin_nz,-3,Fri Jul 10 02:20:45 2015 UTC,needs a good slamwich!
Honda,3cstx1,sainisaab,3,Fri Jul 10 14:19:30 2015 UTC,Probably a short in the speaker.   Try another speaker.
Honda,3cstx1,chriskatana,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"Cheers mate, will try another one."
Honda,3csbp5,drogotmyeyeslow,2,Fri Jul 10 11:09:42 2015 UTC,Look for the enkei and made in Japan casting.
Honda,3csbp5,ArtisticAquaMan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:38:10 2015 UTC,So the fakes won't ever have the double red enkei stamp on the lip?
Honda,3csbp5,ArtisticAquaMan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:11:23 2015 UTC,That could be replicated but definitely look in the wheel well for the castings a lot of fakes are from Taiwan.
Honda,3csbp5,stahlgrau,2,Fri Jul 10 23:07:33 2015 UTC,pics?
Honda,3csbp5,everyonestolemyname,-2,Fri Jul 10 13:57:18 2015 UTC,"the stamping on the inside.  Also, RPF1s are so cheap that it would be retarded to buy knock offs."
Honda,3csbp5,himself1892,7,Fri Jul 10 13:58:36 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever considered $800 for a set of wheels cheap...To each their own I guess.
Honda,3csbp5,everyonestolemyname,2,Fri Jul 10 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"Compared to other aftermarket wheels (not knock offs or replicas), yea they're cheap. They're also amazing.  I have a set of 17x7.5s on my 2012 Si."
Honda,3csbp5,brokenmike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:37:38 2015 UTC,Where are you getting RPF1's for $800?
Honda,3csbp5,himself1892,2,Fri Jul 10 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Tirerack.com  These are 15 inches though. Or maybe 14, can't remember."
Honda,3csbp5,brokenmike,2,Fri Jul 10 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"Must be 14"". Even the 15"" are $215 a piece. And who's buying 15"" wheels anymore. lol"
Honda,3csbp5,himself1892,2,Fri Jul 10 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with 15""s?  Hard to find tires for anything smaller is what I've heard."
Honda,3csbp5,brokenmike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"15""s are kinda small. If you're spending that kind of coin on wheels, I'd be looking at 16"" minimum."
Honda,3csbp5,i-VTEC,2,Fri Jul 10 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on the car. My rule is anything before before 2001 should get 15's, everything after 17's minimum.  Tire selection for 16"" wheels is terrible."
Honda,3csbp5,willbill642,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:56:43 2015 UTC,"Tire and rim selection at 16 is awful. 15 and 13 have some really awesome track tires, 14 has a few as well. 16 loses all those. Any other good tires start back up at 17 and sometimes even 18"
