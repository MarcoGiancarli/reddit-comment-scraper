(At the same time and on same gen console)  Of course both Normal Cards/Limited Edition and Cards Lite.    At the same time and on same gen console   So no one complains But you get different stuff at different times and on different gen consoles bla bla blaa

Typical fighter (that thinks hes good) who cant do shit but play defense. N if he does push, he doesnt push appropriately unless he has help. Kinda like tempi  Tempi earlier pushed with a cleric, was trying objectively a little, til his cleric got fucked, than jus went to the side of the castle n tried shield bashing some scrub LOL. Got wrecked, and ended up doing nothing productive LOL, cuz he had no help. Typical players that strive just to get carried. Pussy players who are one dimensional. Than he pushed at the end of the game, not realizing numbers, and left his castle to get taken over LOL soo fucking stupid. OR soo pussy that he just doesnt want to be put on a pole, so he acts like he was going to try to do something productive LOL. #AReYouGoingToLearnHowTOplayTHeGameYouBeenPlayingForYEarS??

WEAK qm players who are all lost. You call yourselves a team??? LOL game is boring cuz all there is, is laggers and scrub ass players like yourself(devil,both devils).

My question is, why be good at 1v1's but so SHIT at QM, like whats the point?? what exactly are you practicing for?? Lag clearly is dominate in 1v1's, nearly unbeatable if ur playing someone who is good and lags, (like mystic or shaymin) granted they are both good fighter dont get me wrong, but their lag makes them great. In QM, lag like that is easily beatin. Because it has more to do with strategy, its an actual team game.  Said it before, n will say it again.

HappyWars,3e53dg,jedimasterclos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:25:26 2015 UTC,"Jordan won 6 championships from 91-98  from 88 to 96, a bunch of expansion teams were added which diluted the overall quality of the league, such as the Magic, the Raptors, the Grizzlies, and the Heat - basically a bunch of noob teams which you, as leader of PTC, know are the easiest to steamroll cuz that's all you do ;)  and here, i'll just copy and paste the rest of the article  One of the staples of MJ’s legacy is that each of the teams he defeated in the finals had very memorable superstars. Although this is true, when looked at a bit deeper, these teams may be a little overrated. Let’s take a quick look at the teams Michael Jordan defeated in the finals and how they might be a little overrated:  1991 – Los Angeles Lakers – a good team, but point guard Magic Johnson was on his way out, and James Worthy was not nearly as effective as he was in the 80s. Also, the team no longer had Michael Cooper like they had in the 1980s, who was widely considered one of the best defensive players of all time. Needless to say, this Lakers team also no longer had the talents of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar like they did in the 80s – this Lakers team was a far cry from the Lakers that dominated the 80s.  1992 – Portland Trail Blazers – Outside of Clyde Drexler, this team boasted the legendary talents of…Jerome Kersey and Clifford Robinson. Moving on!  1993 – Phoenix Suns – Probably one of the better teams that MJ played, the Suns were led by then-MVP Charles Barkley, who was one of the league’s best power forwards. Outside of Barkley, this team lacked quality interior defense, a persistent theme throughout Jordan’s title run that was also a big reason why the Bulls won the 1991 and 1992 NBA finals.  1996 – Seattle Supersonics – the famous duel between Gary Payton and Michael Jordan, unfortunately, was incredibly one-sided. The Seattle Supersonics really only had two good players, Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp. Kemp was an effective forward, but his work ethic left much to be desired, and the team did not have the depth that the Bulls had, with Pippen and Dennis Rodman working as incredible defenders while Michael Jordan constantly took shot after shot, making only 46% of his shots, which is low for the “greatest player of all time.”  1997-1998 – Utah Jazz – Probably the best team Jordan faced in the finals, this Jazz team was admittedly stocked with high-level talent, which included the likes of John Stockton and Karl Malone. Still, this team paled in comparison to the 1980’s Utah Jazz, who had defensive presence Mark Eaton to stop the offensive teams in the low post.  As we can see, the teams Jordan faced in 1990s finals either had low post defensive issues, were not as good as they were in the 80s (which is why they could be overrated), or lacked great depth."

FLUKES is the ONLY person who has remained good from G00n clan throughout Happy wars entirety.  People in general didnt know how to fight for the longest time, didnt even know how to quick hit for a long time. NOW, and for quite some time now basically everyone knows how to fight to a certain extent.  Jus cuz flukes learned from someone, doesnt mean he didnt at some point surpass his successor. Which IS what happened. Flukes is not only best player to be a part of goon, but hes one of the best ever. He was the face of G00n at one point. When ppl thought G00n, they thought flukes. Demani was alright, but no where near what flukes became.  IF ANYTHING competition is just as SHIT than as it is now. n if ANYTHING, ppl have gotten better over that time. Like i said, everyone actually knows how to quick hit now. When for a long time, only but so many knew.  Ur soo fucking shit that i dont even know whom you are LOL. SO go back to putting G00n in front of your name, thinking your something, when FLUKES is the only one that is a true GOON LOL.  U have Goon in front of your name, soley cuza flukes. IDC if u were in Goon for a long time. FLUKES is the only one with Goon in front of his name, that is worth mentioning anymore.

Cannon accuracy is really only beneficial if you are trying to focus on a cannon build. I don't see any real use for Stun 2 on a cleric. Perhaps on a warrior with Super Stun 3 and Stun Crusher, but otherwise, not really that useful. Your new cleric weapon is probably not a great choice in any scenario, as you will probably not be trying to fight many mages with your cleric. If you put it on an engineer with S.

HappyWars,3e28ur,Shwrecked,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:42 2015 UTC,Smash effect isn't the best choice against bots but that's about it....
HappyWars,3e28ur,Venom_Nommy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:50 2015 UTC,nor quick match and in some situations its the worst effect to go for. the only thing i thinks best about it is that it works with all effects whilst stun and ko are crap with fire
HappyWars,3e28ur,Venom_Nommy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I would have to say that smash is the most effective. If there were no rate downs, I would use Stun. Smash is more powerful and effective because there is no rate down to it. KO rate down doesn't work but Reduce status effect does. If your opponent doesn't have Stun Rate Down and you know how to use it, you're more likely to win against a skilled smash player. IMO"
HappyWars,3e28ur,Venom_Nommy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:47 2015 UTC,as i keep saying though many people complain about getting stun rate down other than... other buffs and again not many people use stun rate down and its being used less because stun is being used less
HappyWars,3e28ur,Shwrecked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"I know, but the fact that the Stun Rate Down is available itself is a problem. For quick match feel free to use it. But when some welfare warrior comes out of nowhere with Stun rate down and you have to waste more time trying to kill him than a more advanced player, that's when you'll realize smash was better for quick match."

HappyWars,3e28ur,GOON_Bane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"Also, think about it this way.    You're 1v1ing.  They see you have stun. They Pull out SRD if they have it. (Smart players do have it.) You're forced to use Smash because KO is a no no."

I created this thread and wrote in it that we should out the lag cheaters (so they can be avoided and have a hard time rising up the leaderboard), and I'm willing to practice what I preach.    To answer your question, I looked at the leaderboard from 1 to 1000 and wrote down the names of every person I've personally seen teleporting in games (not for a few seconds but proper lagging in games where everyone else was not lagging). I know some on the list are users here and will deny ever lagging or call me a liar but I know what I saw and stand by every name on the list.

HappyWars,3dz4zf,OmniDuke,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Everyone lags on this game, There is no servers. Just because people lag does not mean there cheating. It's based on connection or location lag and those things. Everyone will have one person who says they lag."

I'm not talking about minor lag that could affect anyone playing a P2P game, e.g. when you hit an enemy and they take damage a moment later (instead of immediately). Nobody cares about lag in that loose sense of the word.    I'm talking about the players who teleport in games, regardless of who the host is. These people are extremely difficult to kill and exploit this fact. There's a reason my list is only 22 names long, even though I read through a thousand. You're on it because you're in the minority of cheaters I've seen teleporting throughout a game."
HappyWars,3dz4zf,OmniDuke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:56 2015 UTC,There only cheating if there going out of there way to lag. Which a number of people on that list don't do.

HappyWars,3dz4zf,OmniDuke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:22 2015 UTC,You can only get to that level of lag through switching.

Dont start what you cant finish. Maby you pole dancers should spend more time trying to win, than losing game, after game, after game.

HappyWars,3e34hz,Shmaydenator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:09 2015 UTC,mages need to have a slight advantage when meleeing so the attack reach up and stun come in there. as i say many times stun rate down is being used less so stun should start making a comeback
HappyWars,3e34hz,theronlol,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:45 2015 UTC,its perfect

HappyWars,3e34hz,OmniDuke,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:23:00 2015 UTC,Use a buff pincer on magic attack 3 because you have both slayers and the damage on my favorite shangri la is tremendous and put attack reach up.
HappyWars,3e34hz,Inspire_me_x,0,Tue Jul 21 16:29:17 2015 UTC,Mages die quick anyways... I would put ambush attack up 3.. Just Cuz back shots hurt to warriors a lot more.. And take off mage slayer

HappyWars,3e27n3,MMBADBOI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:45:09 2015 UTC,so HP recovery up 3 and AP recovery up 3 would be a lot better than HP & AP up 3?
