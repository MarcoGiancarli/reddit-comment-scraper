PastAndPresentPics,2y71sy,gloomswarm,19,Sat Mar 7 05:02:48 2015 UTC,"It was a lot of fun! Since College Jeopardy is a tournament, there were 15 of us and I'm still friends with everyone. Every year it's filmed at the University of Wisconsin so seeing Madison was nice. They pay for your trip and give you a per diem so that was really nice.   I've always dreamed on being on the show since I was a kid and my sister would make me ""play Jeopardy"" with her and we'd keep score while following along with the TV so this was a dream come true. Alex Trebek was nice but kind of sassy. We played cards and sang Disney songs in the green room. I especially liked getting my make up done.  Being on stage with an audience was not as nervewracking as I thought it was. You kinda block that out. The most intense part was buzzing in.   I didn't win my first match although I did play very well but lost in Final Jeopardy. Since I was one of the highest scoring non winners, I got to advance to the semifinals as a wildcard. I did worse in the semifinals so that's when I got out.  But it was a lot of fun! If I could do it again, I would."
PastAndPresentPics,2y71sy,BaisMa,6,Sat Mar 7 05:15:32 2015 UTC,Is there a trick to buzzing in?
PastAndPresentPics,2y71sy,elevatormech,15,Sat Mar 7 05:17:41 2015 UTC,"You can't buzz in before Alex finishes the question. If you do, your buzzer is disabled for like a quarter of a second and that really matters when everyone else is buzzing in too. There are lights on the side of the question board that can't be seen on TV at home. When Alex completely finishes the question, those light up and then you can buzz in."

What is wrong with deciding whether or not you find a girl attractive enough to sleep with when you see her for the first time? Maybe the internal monologue is not as crude as ""yea, i'd do her, her, her, but not her,"" but every guy assesses whether or not a girl is attractive, and whether or not he might have sex with her within a short time after first seeing her. This might not apply to older men, but every guy I know that is older than 13 or younger than 35 does."

I responded saying that it is normal, and that there is nothing wrong with it. At no point did I say I supported his decision to post his opinion on whether or not the women in the picture are bangable, because that is not what you addressed in your response. If you had said ""Dude, nobody cares, don't be a weirdo,"" I would have agreed with you, because idgaf and it IS weird.   To be offended or surprised that a heterosexual man in the average age range of redditors immediately decided who was bangable after looking at a picture of women is naive and stupid, and that was my point."
