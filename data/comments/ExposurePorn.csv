ExposurePorn,3e31hi,Vawnn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, when you set to infinity, it's actually past the focal point of where the stars are at, which doesn't make any sense, but I know this because i'll go into my live view mode to do a 10x digital zoom to check my focus.   So when I take these photos, I'm in manual focus. So it's just like the tiniest bit before infinity."

ExposurePorn,3dxxse,SaintKairu,11,Mon Jul 20 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"A really short simple answer is that the when doing long exposure, you take a photo for a long period of time.  During that time, the camera is trying to get as much information (light) as it can. So if you have an object that doesn't emit much light (the people) and a long exposure, the camera won't capture them because it doesn't get enough information.  The LEDs were super bright, so even though they were moving its enough for the camera to read the information."

Now think of how much time the camera sees the longboarder versus the background. Clearly, the background is what is seen for a majority of the time. Since there's no extra light in the longboarder vs the background, the background is what shows up in the final picture!  You could do many things to change what shows up and get various results and degrees of ""transparency"" for the boarder dude/dudette"

Also not sure what editing software you have at your disposal.l but there's some noise reduction tools that make it pretty easy."
ExposurePorn,3dqhm7,DrubieDaGuru,5,Sat Jul 18 20:17:16 2015 UTC,I would go with two exposures one for the foreground interest and one with the sky personally. The lens width also effects star streaking. So if you have a 24mm lens you can have a much longer exposure than a 200mm lens. http://starcircleacademy.com/2012/06/600-rule/  A lot of the fun in doing this is just mucking around and trying as many different exposure combos as possible until you get your desired result.
ExposurePorn,3dqhm7,PlazzmiK,2,Sat Jul 18 16:51:39 2015 UTC,"Others have mentioned noise reduction algorithms, but have you considered the application of flat-field and dark frame (you'll also need bias frames) corrections?  Or, planning for future long exposures, consider taking a few and averaging the shots for an effectively higher signal to noise ratio. This may be a bit tougher for stars since they move though."
ExposurePorn,3dqhm7,DrubieDaGuru,2,Sat Jul 18 18:59:58 2015 UTC,This is the best way to go pro...

ExposurePorn,3cl3oq,NotDrKevorkian,2,Thu Jul 9 04:51:39 2015 UTC,Stacking is great for deep space shooting but more difficult and tasking with landscape photos because you have to make masks of the landscape etc.   It was the rokinon 8mm but I actually just returned it today. I found the performance a little lacking so I'm going back to either the canon 10-22 or tokina 11-16 (I broke my last one)

ExposurePorn,3cb5ma,ad88,6,Mon Jul 6 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"There's two people here, one is my pal sitting on the floor of the tunnel. He didn't move all the time the shutter was open, so you can see him in the pic. The other person is me, but I can't be seen 'cos I was moving around all the time, wearing dark clothes, so didn't register on the camera sensor.  What you can see, is where I waved the el-wire. It's a length of glowing, flexible neony stuff, so when you waft it about, it leaves these odd trails if you bend it, fold it and then stretch it out again, all whilst walking around. With a bit of practise, you can get this flame effect.  Dunno where y'are geographically, but here in the UK, I get my elwire from elwirecraft.co.uk, they do a good starter pack with short lengths of 5 different colours, so theoretically,you could get a multicoloured flame effect. Which I've not got around to yet.  Here's an example of using it to describe the rough outline of myself, in the same tunnel a while back."

ExposurePorn,3caur8,Aaberg123,2,Mon Jul 6 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"My ""problem"" with most long exposure shots, is that it focuses too much on the moving element and forgets if the scene is actually worth shooting. And I do this all the time myself, I'm afraid.  What I do to stop myself from talking banale shots is to ask myself: ""If this hadn't been a long exposure, would I have kept the photo?"" If the answer is no, then it's not worth the effort.  For instance, this image I think is pretty nice even if I hadn't used an ND filter."
ExposurePorn,3caur8,Aaberg123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:39:39 2015 UTC,Just to clarify...do you feel that is a problem with this photo? Either way I appreciate the comment. Definitely something to keep in mind.  I think maybe I was following your mindset when i settled in on getting this shot right; my other test shots didn't do much for me. The moss was one of the few things that stood out. Capturing the motion of the water in the back made it stand out more.

ExposurePorn,3bcm5b,EightyJay,2,Sun Jun 28 09:42:02 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I'm pretty sure he/she stacked the photos in post processing. The star trails are too long to be just a 25 second exposure. With digital cameras, really long exposures (like 30 minutes, even less) can result in a lot of noise since the light sensors aren't really meant for that, so stacking shorter exposures leads to higher quality."

ExposurePorn,3b6tia,Dcap16,3,Fri Jun 26 13:05:41 2015 UTC,Excellent shots. I'm slightly surprised at the minimal noise in the image for your camera and ISO3200 did you have the built in NR on? And/or did you reduce noise through Lightroom (or some other program)?
ExposurePorn,3b6tia,lukesterite,2,Fri Jun 26 19:38:32 2015 UTC,The D7100 is a surprisingly capable camera and most people dont give the credit it deserves. Also getting close on with the exposures in camera and adding contrast is how I managed the noise in photoshop.

ExposurePorn,3axdek,wastedyeti,2,Wed Jun 24 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"Do the stars move thru the sky more quickly than closer to the equator?

ExposurePorn,3axdek,fishlips_,5,Wed Jun 24 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"It takes me about 7 minutes to do all the writing. The final picture is multiple 20 second exposures stitched together. All the stars stay horizontal and just go in a circle so I suppose the stars near the horizon have to move faster than the ones higher/closer to the pole, but the ones at the horizon are the ones you see at the equator's zenith.... this is starting to hurt my brain."

ExposurePorn,3av3hx,Marcus_BrodyIV,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure? I'm really not an expert on the physics but I run into airglow all the time when out shooting at night. I think they are similar phenomena but from what I understand, the Aurora is caused by particles ejected from the sun colliding with earth's magnetic field. I've heard airglow described as ""excited"" ionized particles in the upper atmosphere."
ExposurePorn,3av3hx,Mark_W,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:54:13 2015 UTC,You pretty much got it.  The two are unrelated events.
ExposurePorn,3av3hx,rnclark,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:38:59 2015 UTC,Airglow occurs all over the earth.  It is caused by solar UV exciting molecules in the upper atmosphere.  Polar aurora are cause by particles (electrons and protons) from the solar wind.  The colors (wavelengths of light) are exactly the same in both cases.  Your image shows what is called banded airglow.  Specifically green banded airglow from oxygen.  Your white balance is off (the Milky Way is not blue).  The banded airglow if bright enough would appear chartreuse green.  The Milky Way is mostly yellow to brownish red.  Try a sunny white balance if you want natural color.
ExposurePorn,3av3hx,rnclark,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:14:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I have several shot with natural white balance, although from an artistic standpoint, I like the blue color scheme."
ExposurePorn,3av3hx,N8C,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is certainly a current fad.  I liken it to the digital photography community deciding sunsets should always be blue with no red showing.  Fine for a particular monochrome effect.  In my opinion all blue night skies are quite boring compared to the wonderful natural colors in the night sky."

ExposurePorn,3ayig1,bcramer0515,3,Wed Jun 24 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"Here is the album is anyone is wondering.  Oh, how I wish my photos came straight off the SD card looking like this.  Since I used ISO 100 (to get the cleanest shot possible), most of my shots were underexposed away from the explosions and the explosions themselves were slightly overexposed.  I knew this would happen, but the payoff would be cleaner images that can then be altered in post processing with Lightroom. Only then am I able to rescue the light you see in the photos.  After playing around several times the year before, I found that the sweet spot with the Tokina 11-16mm is around f/8 or f/9 in terms of sharpness in low light.  You can see my Lightroom adjustments here.  The adjustment with the biggest effect was exposure, going up by almost three stops.  This was the only way to retrieve the sky and the foreground. Increasing contrast then brought out the clouds and edges of the explosions.  Decreasing the highlights and whites got rid of the blown out portions of the explosions.  I little bump in clarity, vibrance and saturation and viola. Purists may scoff at the edits, but getting a photo to look like this out of the camera without the noise is all but impossible.  I did compose the shot so that the Jupiter/Venus conjunction would be in the shot and the explosions would satisfy the rule-of-thirds, balancing out the planets and crowded foreground to the bottom left.    Most of the shots were between 7 and 10 seconds. I was in Bulb mode and just holding the shutter down with my finger. If I had a remote trigger, the shots may have been a tad sharper.  I am not a pro by any means, but I have done a lot of trial and error stuff for the past four years and have gotten pretty adept at Lightroom. Feel free to ask me any questions."
