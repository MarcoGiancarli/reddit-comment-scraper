mtgaltered,3e5cl8,Juju114,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:37:38 2015 UTC,It's better to lay down a basecoat of neutral gray and save the matte sealer for finishing the alter.
mtgaltered,3e5cl8,unusual2you,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:10:35 2015 UTC,I use light Korylon Matte Finish spray before alter any card. I do this because it gives your paint something to hold to.

mtgaltered,3djduh,alieneggplant,3,Thu Jul 16 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"Hey, altering artist here.  Just because you don't play Magic doesn't mean you should stay away from altering. I see it as another medium where artist can express themselves and showcase their talent :) However, if you do happen to play Magic, you'll be more aware of what cards are sought out by customers looking to purchase your stuff. I also find it fun to play Magic with cards I've altered myself or cards altered by some of my altering friends.  But don't let the fact that you don't play Magic discourage you from creating art :)"
mtgaltered,3djduh,sierramist84,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouragement! I think I'll probably at least learn how to play and start paying more attention to tournaments and such at my LGS just to stay educated on what people are using. But I'm hoping eventually I'll get to a point that I am doing commissions and won't have to pick what cards to do, people will provide them haha."
mtgaltered,3djduh,YukiAlters,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"As long as you have friends that play, you can get information on what cards to alter from them. They might even be your first commissions if they like your work! It's really not necessary to play in order to alter. I haven't played any Magic in over 4 months because I've found altering more enjoyable with my busy schedule. The downside is not being able to showcase your work at the LGS, but you can make up for it by increasing your internet presence."
mtgaltered,3djduh,YukiAlters,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"Well all my roommates usually go to Friday night Magic at our LGS and I've already discussed with the owner and he's open to me setting up there to do on the spot commissions, so I'm expecting my first customers to be there. I'm actually much more intimidated by the online community since there are so many great alterists competing with me haha. I live in a small city and our LGS is the only one in the county that I'm aware of so it draws BIG crowds for tournaments and FNM, and I am apparently the only person who has ever attempted to start selling alters there. So the situation for me is working out greatly! I was mostly afraid of the online response if I were to disclose that I don't actually play haha but if the responses to this are any indication I may have nothing to worry about. I don't really have any issues with admitting that I am basically only in this for the money, lol. Although I do enjoy making them, which is why I'd love to grow this into a side job."
mtgaltered,3djduh,YukiAlters,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:41:11 2015 UTC,"Ahh gotcha, being able to set up at your LGS would be a great start. As for online, there's no real need to disclose whether you play or not, it's pretty much irrelevant when it comes to altering. However, if you were in this solely for the money, I'm afraid you might be disappointed."

Well, I just took the smallest brush I had, outlined the lotus and then filled it in to make it more glass-like. Then I just kind of went along randomly with lines, trying not to make any one fragment have more than one color. Then I just kinda threw in some color that matched what was around it, sometimes a little lighter or darker. The randomness is what's so appealing, so I don't think there's any way you can really go wrong!"

Also coated the card with a matte varnish before and after painting.  Tips and suggestions are welcome! I am not satisfied with my color matching yet.

mtgaltered,3dcr1g,platform_disciple,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:40:00 2015 UTC,I think the colors actually look pretty nice! The thing you should focus most on is making thinner coats of paint because you can see the texture/thickness of it on this card.

mtgaltered,3dcshs,EH_Slivers,6,Wed Jul 15 06:53:33 2015 UTC,"2 things:  Your paint is so THICK. I can see every brush stroke, which means shuffling with these cards, its going to be obvious where they are. They will FEEL different, making them illegal in tournament play. Also they are much easier to crease and have the paint chip off, they won't be very durable.  Also, I recommend taking a toothpick and chipping away at excess paint on your headers and textboxes. Just cleans the images up and makes them seem a lot less messy.  Otherwise good color matching and great work, but try to practice thinning your paints and using multiple light layers, rather than one or two thick ones. Keep it up! Practice makes perfect!"
mtgaltered,3dcshs,tehmooch,3,Wed Jul 15 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"It would be terrifying to see anyone shuffle altered cards without sleeves! I agree with you for sure though, these are basically the first alters I've ever done. I learned something on each one and slowly began thinning my paints down and realizing chunky warhammer paints might've not been the greatest idea"
mtgaltered,3dcshs,tehmooch,3,Wed Jul 15 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"OMG you used warhammer paints?! Extremely expensive mistake my friend. Sorry to hear.  When I first started I used regular dollar store acrylics and they were still thick as all hell. Once I switched to Golden Acrylics (a bit pricey but they last forever, I alter as a side job and only need to replace a tube every 4-6 months or so) I never looked back. Huge difference in quality.  Also invest in a matte acrylic spray. NOT gloss. I tried gloss and it was sticky as hell in a sleeve, and gunked up the whole card. My matte spray makes an even finish to the alter and hides blend marks well, plus adds a layer of elasticity for durability.  Good luck and happy painting!"

Smooth those out and it'll go a long away. Your thinning and blending definitely isn't bad, but could always get a bit better, so strive for that sweet spot. Finally, Sol Ring is a prime example, get creative with full arts. I know you're depicting the ring on a pedestal, but think outside the box, it's boring as is- at least make the pedestal lighter and make the full art worth looking at!  Definitely keep it up though.

mtgaltered,3d3djy,owlgirlia,2,Mon Jul 13 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with what the other guy said, but I'd like to add that your paint seems a bit thick sometimes. It's important that you keep your paint thin, so that it's smooth and still fits in tight fitted sleeves. Also makes the colors blend a heck of a lot better."
mtgaltered,3d3djy,Zaporah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:38:11 2015 UTC,"So, how should I go about thinning it?  The Feed the Pack and Reanimate do fit their sleeves, but I do agree my paint's thick, any help with that?"
mtgaltered,3d3djy,elomenopi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:05:48 2015 UTC,A very small bit of water. Barely any. Of course it depends on how much paint you have. I usually only have a small dab of it so barely a brush full of water does the trick.

They look fantastic!  What was the process? I'm guessing you stuck paper over the part of the checklist you didn't need, pencilled the outlines, applied watercolours, then inked over it all with a pen?"
mtgaltered,3cxkw1,SubredditControl,5,Sun Jul 12 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's actually all done with acrylics and pen. I taped the outside of the cards where I didn't want paint and then painted a base coat of grey followed by white to make the whole card white. Then lightly penciled out the outline. For the color I actually just used very watered down acrylics to give it the look of water color, while still giving it the feel and quality of acrylics, and finished with doing all the pen work using a very fine sharpie to get the details."

mtgaltered,3c3pjl,zajoba,3,Sat Jul 4 18:20:18 2015 UTC,I do not remove any foil or ink layers from the card I just paint directly over the layers. The trick is that foil layer does not cover the whole surface of the card so I paint only over the parts there is no foil on so you can have foil and altered land at the same time. Unfortunately it only works on the old lands. I see no point in altering cards fully covered with foil. For me it's only deterioration and I would never do that.

So the first layer will still have a lot of the card art showing through, the next layer will show less, etc.   Repeat until you have a good base layer, and the paint won't be near the thickness of just doing one coat to block out the art underneath. Takes more time, sure, but the outcome is much better."

mtgaltered,3bwm5o,GiantPanda47,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"My only comment isn't even a complaint, more of just a recommendation. If you ever DO go back and touch it up, I'd recommend feathering the land near the bottom corners of the card. Right now, they look sort of... artificial? Add some blades of grass sticking up in front of the water. Nothing large, but still. Give it a more natural transition instead of the clear-cut line that's there now."

mtgaltered,3b90fs,QuartzComposer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"I had one of these laying around that I didn't mind killing! I think it turned out decently. The right middle section was really really hard! I should have worked more in layers instead of trying to do all of the colors all at once but, hey, it doesn't look too bad... I also had trouble making the black around the bottom smooth, something I still need to work on. I tried making some heads and spears at the bottom, but it looked like crap, so now I have the two weird lumps. I'm really happy with how the sky turned out, though! Comments and criticisms really appreciated!"
mtgaltered,3b90fs,TheInvaderZim,2,Fri Jun 26 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"If you really feel like ""killing"" the card, Alesha's artwork is something I've always felt suffers from ""battlefield syndrome"" - that is, potentially beautiful color hidden behind a dust filter. If you're looking for a way to further improve the card, sharpening the shadows and lines and making other, existing colors more vibrant would do it wonders, I think. The effect that the bright blue sky has on the surrounding image is already spectacular."
mtgaltered,3b90fs,scribeaki,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:06:25 2015 UTC,"Is the uneven edge of the lower text box intentional? The black wavy bits that ride up from the bottom of the card border into the lower-left corner distract a bit from the rest of the great work you put into the main picture and I think it would benefit from being uniformly clean and straight so all attention goes to the main picture.  The other suggestion I would make is that your colour matching is quite good but might benefit from just a little extra depth - sometimes 'washing' a layer of watered down paint over a paler base colour can help bring the colours closer together. I'm specifically thinking of the trailing banners in the upper right side, as the original art seems a little redder. A thin wash of a red shade over your extension could help even out the tones.  You've done a really nice job, and a very impressive second alter. Well done, and I look forward to seeing what you do next!"

mtgaltered,3b5h7g,anime_club,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:47:24 2015 UTC,"Specifically, just below the mana cost. I can't seem to get the color matching right. I'm using ""Smoked Pearl"", which is actually almost exactly the original color used on the lightest green part of the original art... so I tried mixing that with a touch of yellow, then I tried brown, then just a deeper green... nothing I do seems to match the second shade of light green below the mana cost."
mtgaltered,3b5h7g,clintmccool,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:19:46 2015 UTC,Fuckin hate extending this card. Probably tried upwards of ten times and something about the colors in the upper part means trouble. Yours looks relatively solid tho. Bit dark right to the right of the mana cost.  I've had the best luck with a lot of extremely thin washes of colors that are almost all white with just a tiny tint of something else. Layer enough of these up over a white base and eventually you will probably hit it. Super thin though. Very thin.
mtgaltered,3b5h7g,GeebusNZ,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'd try concealing it by lightening it as though there were some low clouds obscuring the area slightly.

mtgaltered,3augqd,sierramist84,2,Tue Jun 23 16:36:07 2015 UTC,Very interesting  Is this an acrylic color?  What technique and color or pen you use to draw a sharp black line of the character?  I used to try to draw the cartoon character on mtg card. I'm using a number 00 paint brush with black sakura pigma pen. but It looked toootally bad especially the black line in the character.
mtgaltered,3augqd,Vatarants,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"This is acrylic paints and Sakura Microperm 01 ink pen. Sakura Microperms (NOT Microns) are one of the better pens out there for doing alters. They dry fast and are waterproof; they may take some practice to get used to them though.  Sometimes, for fine details, if I can't use a marker I'll use a small brush and black acrylic paint. Just make sure the paint is watered down enough so it flows easily off the brush"
