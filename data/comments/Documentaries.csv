He treated me very well, both times smiling and laughing even though he really couldn't speak any English. He even walked outside after the dinner and took a picture with me and my brother. He was definitely not racist at all.  I think if you appreciate his food and treat him with respect he will treat you well.   On the other hand I heard a story about a chinese lady who visited his son's restaurant, arrived late,  and asked for the sushi cooked - they got very angry about that.

The Japanese have this idea of continuous improvement - tweaking things to be a little bit closer to perfect every day - and Jiro has applied this meticulously for years and years to reach perfection.

The first season follows David Chang and the second follows Sean Brock, but in both seasons they spend lots of time traveling, looking at different regions or different types of food, and meeting with many different chefs and restauranteurs.

I feel more comfortable with my own.  They understand what I'm trying to do.""   There's nothing wrong with that.  He doesn't have to explain himself, or his art, to anyone."

He likes to be able to talk to and communicate with his customers with ease and since he doesn't speak English, it makes the entire process more difficult for both parties. And since the demand is so high and he is always fully booked with Japanese speaking customers, non-English patrons just fall way down on the priority list. It is of no benefit to him really."

Documentaries,3dzy16,fcjnews,33,Tue Jul 21 04:52:36 2015 UTC,He was an asshole throughout the documentary. He basically kicked his younger son out of the family business and said don't come back and then said it was wrong for parents to help their children if they failed. He argued they should have no home to come back to. The guy seemed like a huge ass in the documentary. He's an excellent chef but seems to be a terrible person.  Edit: younger son
Documentaries,3dzy16,Wampawacka,11,Tue Jul 21 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, some of the things he did were definitely dick-ish, but I think there's some cultural context there that gives him rational for treating his children/employees/whoever the way he does.

Young Japanese parents are nothing like him... you'll meet grandmas and grampas with that attitude, and it really was shaped by the struggles Japan went through post-war imo. I get why that generation is like that.  When I stayed with a Japanese host family for a year, the grandma was very that type. I went out to some event with her and her grandson who has Downs. He's was like 10 but mentally 4. He was crying and saying he wanted to go home because it was raining and he was tired. Typical kid stuff. She totally snapped, giving him a lecture and saying 我慢しなさい！ 我慢できない子は最悪だよ！Suck it up, children who can't suck it up are terrible. She wasn't a bad grandma and she cared a lot for this kid. But that's line... saying ""gaman/suck it up"" is sooo like the catchphrase of any Japanese people over 50. You hear it so often. That's the attitude I get from Jiro. That worship of gaman. If you gaman you will succeed."
Documentaries,3dzy16,ginger_root_and_tree,5,Tue Jul 21 06:21:57 2015 UTC,You know those jokes about disgrace to the famiry?  Those spurred from somewhat traditional family.  Jiro is a very traditional man.
Documentaries,3dzy16,PM_ME_TITS_MLADY,16,Tue Jul 21 09:00:15 2015 UTC,I think that's the beauty of the film. You get to see who Jiro really is for better or worse. Which is what documentaries should be.

Like his whole schtick is the friendly, eccentric grandfather of a much-loved animation studio, but it is clear in parts of the documentary that he can be a very difficult person to work with and drives people away by being too harsh.  I guess when you're a master of your craft, people are inclined to edit out the imperfections."
Documentaries,3dzy16,baldurs_turnstile,14,Tue Jul 21 04:38:22 2015 UTC,What? They're all completely devoted to him and their craft. He demands the absolute best out of all of them and they all want to be there.

Documentaries,3dzy16,tomato_water,4,Tue Jul 21 13:10:08 2015 UTC,"I watched it a long time ago, so memory might be a little fuzzy...  But IIRC, due to (cultural??) tradition his eldest son was sort of forced to follow in his father's footsteps and is supposed to take over the main restaurant, but Jiro won't retire (he's like 85 or 90). So the son (aged like 50 or 60), who could rightly run his own restaurant, is forced to continue working for his father.   Meanwhile, the younger son who was kicked out is able to have his own restaurant is seems to be enjoying working for himself.   Yes, Jiro is devoted to his sushi, but it's as the expense of making everyone around him miserable."

I watched it in a moment of my life where I felt that anything I had to do to advance in life was pointless - boring compulsory subjects in school, unfulfilling intern work, that kind of things.   Watching the documentary taught me that you can get satisfaction  doing a good job, regardless of how average and uninteresting the task is.  The way they even pay attention to wether his clients are going to be right or left handed, so they know how to place things on the table...  You can transform anything into an art just by putting that insane amount of attention to detail."

I needed to make some print copies while I was in Japan, but the instructions was only in Japanese. The clerk handled calling a friend who spoke English, to help me out, while she was rushing to take care of other customers who came in at the same time. I know concierge services in Europe or US that does not even begin to go over the top as she did for her customers. And my guess was that she was way past pension age, but still working for the fun of it.  And comparing that to 7-eleven in Europe is even laughable. In US, they might be lacklustre, but at least they will give you a friendly service most of the time.  I myself worked in a convience store in Europe when I was younger, and was as lacklustre and pissed-off doing a shitty job. I wish I've had some Japanese mentality in me back then."

Documentaries,3dzy16,Bumbee87,23,Tue Jul 21 04:17:06 2015 UTC,I thought he was like the crystallization of a workaholic. Basically he sacrificed any personal life for sushi mastery and it seemed like he was only superficially improving at the end.

I understand that there are probably a ton of little nuances that the layman would overlook in the preparation of sushi, but there has to be some sort of skill ceiling that one can reach in so many decades of practice.

I think a lot of people would be very happy to find something in life that makes them as passionate as Jiro is about sushi. Part of passion is accepting that there will be difficulties and unpleasantries within one's work. That doesn't necessarily make his life as a whole unpleasant."

The sushi that earned Jiro his award was prepared by his son. His son is poised to inherit the restaurant, but the dude won't retire. There's an implicit tension between son and father. What I saw was a master craftsman and patriarch so devoted to his work that it has affected his ability to pass down his legacy to equally deserving people.

The man has done the same thing over and over, while improving himself ever so slightly as time goes by, but always persisting and always striving to be better.  I don't think a 20 minute clip of some awesome guy that makes really good sushi really does justice to him, his life, or his work.

If you were someone with average taste you wouldn't be able to tell much of a difference between the best and something almost as good.  2) In relation to that, you can get almost as good or close to it at a fraction of the price.  3) There's paying to just eat and be full, which can be easily done with $5 in many places or at home, then there's paying for an experience which is supposed to justify the cost."
Documentaries,3dzy16,BEIGE_CAT_MASK,3,Tue Jul 21 06:39:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not even a big sushi/sashimi fan but...  The hype is congruous to the experience of tasting something that you can't possibly get anywhere else in the world. Everything else aside, Jiro and his crew are at the absolute top of their game, and that's something that may people are willing to pay for to experience.   I can eat at burger joints any day of the week and it's fantastic to do so, but to experience the art and science this man places on his dishes is, for me, a one in a lifetime opportunity. And, obviously, many people are willing to pay for that experience.   You say it's all hype, and you are not wrong in saying that. But he's earned that hype by crafting something that nobody else is able to."

Documentaries,3dzy16,99posse,14,Tue Jul 21 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"For me what was interesting was the preparation. The rolls you buy on the cheap are cold with wasabi on the side. I found it interesting to see how warm the rice was cooked, how a dab of wasabi was placed under the fish as it was pressed onto the rice, how intensely red the tuna was. Was it just soy sauce brushed on top?  I always like making my oh-so-mediocre sushi at home and am always interested in upping my game with what I can get :)"

Made reservations 3 months before and postponed my trip a week to make it happen as fine dining is my number 1 hobby and I aim at at least 2 Michelin stars a month (21 or 12) and know quite about about good food.   I would like to point out that almost all of the quality is from his son. Jiro does some QA but that's about it. Honestly I believe his son will take it to a higher level when Jiro steps back completely. Jiro did the first 25 miles of his sushi marathon,  but his son did the final stretch.   If you aspire to eat there bring between 400 and 600 USD a person (depending on the exchange rate)  and be aware that this is not a place where you sit down for hours. It's pretty much in and out."

The person who I am thinking of is an old man by now and I am a young and fit person who could easily break every bone in his body but I get absolutely frozen when I see a photo of him and I know I would freeze if I ever ran into him in public. IMO, child abuse is probably the worst thing a human can do to another. As a child you don't know what normal is yet. It affects your mental DNA and you spend the rest of your life thinking about it.

Documentaries,3dx4b0,bundyfunday,6,Mon Jul 20 20:19:35 2015 UTC,I can't even imagine. Have you ever gotten into therapy to help process and deal with it all?
Documentaries,3dx4b0,ikkyu666,32,Mon Jul 20 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"No, but I am very aware how it has shaped me. I spent most of my childhood fighting/getting suspended, etc. As an adult I have chosen careers that fight for the underdog. I am also really quick to stand up for someone, even a stranger, if I feel like they are being attacked. I have only alluded to it to my S.O. but never really gone into any detail but after you get into altercation after altercation for stuff that isn't any of your business you start tracing the steps and I felt like I owed my SO some explanations. Also, it took me a while to warm up to sex and many of the things that go with that. You know, I feel like as far as child abuse goes a lot of kids have it worse than me. As a parent now I am highly suspicious of adults interacting with my child and I feel bad about that but I don't want my kid to experience what I did. One thing I will say to parents is to really question why a kid doesn't want to do something. My aggressor was a sunday school teacher and a boy scout leader. I kept telling my parents I didn't want to go to church or boy scouts but never told them why. I was just too scared I guess. Also, a boy at school was touching me aggressively and his parents babysat us afterschool. I knew my parents had no other babysitting option and I didn't want to be any trouble so I just kept going. I'd say one of the worst parts of this was it was during the early 90's when people didn't understand AIDS. I heard somewhere at the time that it could take up to 10 years for you to know if you had it so I remember even long after the abuse stopped I was worried that I might get AIDS and die. Parents watch your kids and strangers if you see something weird, try and do something. You might really help a kid out."
Documentaries,3dx4b0,bundyfunday,6,Mon Jul 20 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that is so awful I'm sorry you had to experience that. It sounds like you've done a great job so far reclaiming your life. I haven't personally went through anything like that, but I've dated someone that had and they were really, really helped by therapy."
Documentaries,3dx4b0,ikkyu666,6,Mon Jul 20 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you know we all go through some shit. I'm sure everyone here has gone through something fucked up that we are all glad we haven't gone through. This is just my thing. I've tried therapy for other stuff and honestly I never found the right person so I just do my thing on my own. I have found that killing kittens by drowning them has made me feel better over the years. (j/k, that was a bad joke) I like cats, got two of them. Anyways, the main takeaway I have from this is protect kids, inflict justice on those who harm kids, and always assume that everyone has something tough that they are dealing with."
Documentaries,3dx4b0,bundyfunday,6,Mon Jul 20 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha, I burst out laughing at work about your coping mechanism.  That's the trouble with therapy - sometimes you've got to shop around a bit and that can be annoying and stressful. Some years back I was dealing with massive depression and anxiety and I was seeing this therapist who I really just didn't know what to do with me as I was not in her field of study, so SHE PULLED OUT TAROT CARDS FOR ONE OF OUR SESSIONS! That fucked me up! Soon after that though I found an amazing guy that changed my life.   Everyone does have stuff they're dealing with, and that helps me be nice to people that are a pain. Suffering is relative though, so don't downplay yours because other people seem to get on! I'm kind of projecting there but whatever."
Documentaries,3dx4b0,ikkyu666,5,Mon Jul 20 22:27:40 2015 UTC,"LOL, yeah, The last time I went to one was for depression too. I essentially waited 3 months to get in and was very worried about harming myself or others every day up until that appointment. I tell this guy that and he's like, ok, come see me in a month if you like. The receptionist asked if I wanted to book a session and I said I needed to check my schedule but I would call back. Well, I never got around to calling back and then I got a bill for missing a session. I was so shocked that I had just told this dude I was afraid I might hurt myself or someone else and he never called to check on me, just sent a bill for an appointment I didn't set up. At that point I was like fuck it, we gotta step up our game and figure this shit out on our own. I can totally see how a good therapist would help - frankly, making up a fake username and saying what I did in ""public"" today was the first time I have ever said any of this shit out loud. That's a form of therapy I guess. Just don't send me a bill!"

You know, over the years it's been easier for me to understand the boy who was touching me because at that age he must have been mimicking something that was happening to him - trying to normalize it. I had to go through all of jr. high and high-school with this kid and he got more and more psychologically fucked up - I'd be shocked if he wasn't in prison or dead or a drug addict by now. Adult me feels really bad for him because I think his parents must have been abusing him but the kid in me still hates his fucking guts and is a bit scared of him."
Documentaries,3dx4b0,bundyfunday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"Very similar story here. Mine was a girl and a relative. I know for a fact that she was mimicking something happening to her. I am not that scared of her, and if I am, it's not based on what happened, but because of her personality and antics. She has no boundaries. I won't say I was abused to the degree of most people who have had to endure much worse. The abuse happened once but I was very young, and I felt a lot of shame and worry about being ""dirty"". It's hard to know what other events might have messed me up since then. It's all chicken and egg to me. I have been to therapy, so I am not completely lost.

Hear me out.  There is evidence that proves our security services filmed 'influential' political figures absuing children in situations the security services themselves have set up on the orders of powerful wealth creators: care homes, orphanages and other situations with at-risk, government accessable children. They do this to use that video material, or other evidnce as blackmail.  The security services are/ were using paedophilia as a 'trade deal' that allows corporations power over nations through blackmail... basically. (See this article as an example that sits along side numerous others: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-28597343 ).  Forget the shapeshifting lizards and the 'conspiracy theories' about hand symbols or whatever. With TTIP- and other trade deals that allow corporations absolute control over nations through financial blackmail ('you harm our corporate profits by not letting us poison your water supply with our gold mine and we sue your nation/ sector into oblivion')- coming increasingly closer these nefarious global organisations will not need this sort of heavy blackmail system in order to control influential figures and nations.  So now they plan to fizzle any talk of this previous system of paedophilic blackmail through purposely spread misinformation and discourse online. Hence the thousands of pages dedicated to attaching all this to some sort of Satanic cult behaviour that's really mysterious and infinitely complex.  They have been doing this for a while, but it has ramped up and there is increasing amounts of evidence (see this article based on the Snowden leaks: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/ )   ""Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums.

But it's also a lot easier to for people to accept as fact because it's less traumatizing and, shall we say, nightmarish. This documentary is a huge victory for disclosure. But it is the tip of the iceberg. They fought viciously to keep this information quiet. Whatever the truth may be, what interests me most is the vast number of Secret Space Programs. Don't try to pretend they don't exist. Just think about it. Unfortunately, most people I know have a knee-jerk denial response to the idea of secret ""Black Project"" space programs, even though we all know what the pie chart looks like that shows how much money NASA gets versus how much Defense gets.

Sorry about the caps.  I don't think humans are inherently bad. I think that The Powers That Be want us to think that human nature is bad so that we will continue to accept what they do behind a thin veil.  The kind of people who would go about setting up this much chaos and evil and suffering and pain are not only just doing it because they think it would get them really high and euphoric.

Spaceflight still uses so called huge fucking rockets to get anything into space, so they're easy to spot. That's why the don't actually hide the launches, it's just that the payload is classified. A somewhat recent mission got a lot of press, but not because of the payload, just because of the logo of the mission. While it's possible that there are launches we don't know about, that stuff needs infrastructure. Maybe there are a couple of hidden launchsites, but they're certainly not used for regular launches, or they wouldn't be hidden for very long.  You're right that defense spends a shitton of money on space stuff. Here's a list of some of the stuff just from the NRO. Note the last part: ""NROL-1 through NROL-66 – various secret satellites"". So there's a lot of them. We don't know what all those things are, but you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to belive that a shitload of money goes into secret projects.

If the cause is primarily power-related, I'm not really sure what we could do about it, though it would explain why people in power might have a tendency to be pedophiles, as they might be attracted to power in all forms.  If it were sexually-based, however, one would think that at some point in the near future we could create some sort of robotic substitute. If you could freeze those desires at stage one(kids are hot, ohmaigah) you might have a significant portion of the pedophile population never slide down the chain to stage 4(actually abusing a child)."

Documentaries,3dx4b0,aenemic,11,Mon Jul 20 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"It's an exaggeration of a normally healthy drive to seek young mates that effectively runs amok and becomes dysfunctional and maladaptive. This 'drive' treats youth as, effectively, a commodity to collect, curate, and use. It's almost vampiric in wanting to sap a 'resource' dry before its gone. Many who've acted on these urges describe how it made them feel closer to youth again, as if being close to the libido of a child takes them back to the source of life. These are at least some of the common traits found in those who like the fuck around with children.  It's both sexually based and power based, as the two are intertwined, and it's not just one drive. Some people who want to fuck kids would be satisfied with such robots, but for those such as the people in the documentary, it's not just about the sex but about the complete power over a living being; it's about the ability to hurt or kill them without consequence. There are people, frightening people, who like nothing better but looking at someone's face when that person realizes their life is in another's hands. There are humans who play with other humans like cats play with mice.  If you'll all excuse the shoddy analogy, perhaps we can identify two groups here.   The stereotypical otaku-hikkimori-neckbeard-basementdweller-etc with negligible social skills who has what amounts to a child-fetish, perhaps from children being easier to manipulate into satisfying this type's sexual desires. He (women doing this to boys/girls exist too) prey on children because they are easier to make into 'willing' sex partners and because of extremely damaged self image. The key idea might be ""these innocent children will love me! they'll understand! I can help them become more adult like and we can live in a world of child-adulthood!"". I believe the pedophile interviewed in the documentary at the end of the above section is this type of man, he seems to genuinely believe that the kids 'get it' and it's the authorities (the 'grown ups') who don't understand. His lack of comprehension regarding inequalities in power between the adult and the child belie his belief in his own lack of power. He would probably (wrongly) describe himself as a victim. He admits to it on live television because he doesn't get the power differential in what he's doing. Why it's not abuse for the child, it's ""liberation""! ""they really do love me! you don't understand!"" The stereotypical Patrick Bateman power psychopath. This one's drive basically comes down to ""I am above these nothings I'm forced to interact with, the rules are for other people, and I'll remind myself of that by getting off on taboo acts"". This person diddles kids because it's a power trip and raw power makes them hard/wet, however it's wielded. Whether it's fucking a child, blackmailing someone, torture, huge financial crimes, murder, or manipulating people just to screw with them, this type gets off on power and causing harm. If it was normal, mundane, or ""pedestrian"" to fuck kids, this type would fuck infants to say they did it; if fucking infants was normal, they'd fuck fetuses in-utero. (See http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/02/justice/delaware-du-pont-rape-case/ we already have a baby-raping elite). This is the same kind of person who would eat the last of an endangered animal, or eat trays of decadent food in front of the starving just to reinforce to themselves their own power. It's no surprise we see this emerge over time as a stereotype of the powerful, the elite, and the aristocratic (Bathory...). It's easier to start viewing people as objects when you're raised away from them, told you're better from birth, and shielded from the consequences of actions (affluenza writ large). This type would never admit to their acts because they want impunity, not understanding. There is no mistake that the actions are abuse of a child, they just don't give a flying fuck, and enjoy the power differential to the point of bathing in it. There is no desire to 'explain' oneself or to gain societal approval for the pedophilic acts because this type feels no need to explain themselves to society or to justify their actions.  ""I don't owe you shit, back off peasant""   tl;dr: I think you have two drive 'complexes':   The hikkimori-neckbeard type who wants a child to love them like they wish an adult would and to practically 'go out' with a child. They desire acceptance for their love of teh child sex. the patrick bateman type who wants to dissect, ravage, and drink up innocence itself, and then do it again to a theme song of their own choosing. They don't give a fuck if you accept them, and while listening to you talk they've have imagined you being slowly sawn in two for daring to question them as well as for wearing a color they dislike."

How only about half of child abuser cases actually involve pedophiles, for example.  Also answers my question quite nicely; the first group would probably be the ones satisfied with a robot substitute, as it gives them everything they want; social acceptance in that they're not abusing a child, and sexual gratification. Meanwhile, the second group would see absolutely no point, as it wouldn't meet their desires.  Awesome response, dude!"

She had emphasized that it was a fear of observation that drove them away from the living.  As for pedophilia, I've wondered if it's sort of like that. You're safe from observation and judgment, because this person's never been in that sort of situation. And if they do judge you, you have absolute power over them.

It's well established that many paedophiles were in turn abused as children themselves, and their sexuaity is so messed up as a result, they get attracted to children. The vast majority of these ministers, MPs and the like would have been educated at the kind of private schools where, sadly, 'buggery' and the like was endemic. Perhaps their demographic was more abused? As government back then was even more dominated by the privately educated than it is now, it would explain the (hopefully) abnormal concentration of paedophiles in high office."

Let's say, and I'm just pulling this out of nowhere, that the perceived ""Ideal"" age for a reproductive partner in a given population is 17. Keeping in mind that individual preferences vary from person to person, you'll get some people that prefer partners younger than that and some that prefer partners older.

Men don't just want youth b/c the child also has to be nurtured. Another problem is that the testimony from these people doesn't support that they are motivate by biology otherwise there would be at least a tiny focus on actual reproduction, a baby, where that result is pretty much absent. Another problem is that the ""ideal"" is not young enough in Western societies for the lower range of the continuum to dip into the underage (ask people what they consider the ideal age to procreate).  The answer as to why it exists is mostly that it exists. The victimizers were once victims and repeat their behavior in a form of automatism with inverted positions (I'm now the victimizer, this stand-in is me). At the core is always abuse of some sort, most likely the obvious type."
Documentaries,3dx4b0,onafarawaybeach,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:57 2015 UTC,"Then where does the sexual element come into the equation? I could easily understand wanting to dominate someone weaker than you after being dominated yourself, but pedophilia is the sexual attraction to children.  I've been reading about this for a few days, and from what I've learned, only about 60% of child sexual abuse is carried out by what are classified as a technical pedophile. So 40% are what you're talking about, but what of the other 60%?  Also, there doesn't necessarily have to be a reproductive drive behind sexual attraction; homosexuality makes that relatively clear. Not to say that the two are related, but if someone can have a sexual orientation towards people their own gender, having one towards people too young is hardly a great leap."
Documentaries,3dx4b0,Derised,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"By definition pedophilia is someone who is sexually attracted to children 11 years old and younger. The reason it's not considered natural is precisely due to the fact that these are children who have yet to go through puberty. A 17 year old is actually an adult physically and doesn't fall under pedophilia. 16  or 17 is the legal age of consent in most US states. I think it's creepy for a 30 year old to have sex with a 17 year old, but it's not really pedophilia."

Everyone who's ever studied law will tell you that the evidence of the eyes is horribly unreliable; add the passage of 20 years and the reliability is not enough for a conviction.

In decades past when being a homosexual was career and life threatening, they would have a similar interest in getting those people into positions where they could be controlled. Then they would just stockpile evidence to blackmail them.   As I understand it, they do something similar in the Church of Scientology; they secretly record all those e-readings where these people confess all sorts of stuff like they might to a Priest or Psychiatrist.

And it's also not to say that every celebrity has the entire story of what goes on in there. Some have more exposure, some have less. The stories are there on the ones not allowed to leave, though."

At their scale, too, there is literally no game in town besides Foxconn.

Apple is notoriously terrible when it comes to waste   So you understand Apple is  also leading in environmental responsibility, so you use a word like ""waste"", instead of claiming it's terrible environmentally.

Do you realize how much material and energy is wasted when you carve a ""unibody"" aluminum chassis instead of making a cheap plastic shell?    Do you? A cheap plastic shell is not recyclable. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable. Macs are used for many years longer than PCs, as well. Apple has a free take-back program as well.

Dan Viederman, Executive Director of Vérité""  Had they taken the usual approach, they would have conducted some social audits, identified the problem of debt bondage, ordered the suppliers to fix it, and waited for the next audit to demonstrate that the problem hadn’t been solved.  Instead they set out a clear vision of success: the elimination of fees paid by workers to labor recruiters. Then they didn’t simply pay the fees or address the symptoms, but worked to address the root of the problem, which is an over-reliance on unregulated and unexamined recruiters.  They spent money and staff time working with suppliers to help them understand the issue and develop a timeline and plan for them to comply. Then Apple held everyone accountable to the new standard, and continues to do so.  So again: Apple is doing more actual stuff than Samsung or any other major tech company. If you care about this as you seem to imply by even writing about this, you will both commend Apple honestly, and use their products over less, or non-socially-responsible companies.

For fun, some of us organized a trip to an airshow in Zhuhai a few years ago.  Was surreal.  The planes would roll down the runway and leap into the sky...and pretty much disappear.  Unless they got dangerously low, you really could only hear the small ones.  The bigger ones you could see most of the time, but the haze is really amazing.  I don't like to think about what I was breathing over there.  I also don't like to think about how much rat I probably consumed.  Americans have a hard time getting used to the number of rats as well.  Damn, I hate rats."

Documentaries,3dxtq5,czechm8e,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"I agree than Apple is responsible for enforcing good working conditions in the factories   Not sure how much one company can do other than not use Foxconn or other contract manufacturers in China. Foxconn is a huge conglomerate with 1.5 million employees. They make billions of dollars in profit. The ultimate responsibility for the wellbeing of those employees lays with Foxconn and Chinese government.  So what's the alternative? Apple makes Mac Pros in the US, but everyone complains about how expensive they are. We consumers have a responsibility in this as well. Will we make the choice to only buy products made in factories who treat employees well?  Personally I'd be all for manufacturing to return to the west. But it's not so simple as I've explained."

But in regards to the Mac Pro part of the reason why they can/do make it here is because so much of it is automated.  And they also don't make nearly as many units or update the design yearly.   If the western world started boycotting tech made in China and demanded it return home we'd just see more expensive products, high levels of automation, and a huge chunk of China's work force suddenly unemployed.   Then, probably, a rise of Chinese based companies like Xiaomi that will continue the poor labor practices and pump out cheap tech that's good enough to out compete our western tech. Especially in growing markets that can't afford the now more expensive western tech.   Also, companies like Foxconn are already moving away from China as labor there grows more expensive. They have a new factory in Bangladesh iirc.   This is indeed a complicated situation as you've said."

As Thailand's fishing sector faces crisis, fishermen are also moving closer to the traffickers, converting their boats to carry people and facilitating huge off-shore trafficking camps."

Documentaries,3dxwu6,apeliott,17,Mon Jul 20 17:09:13 2015 UTC,Fetishization vs. reality.  A fetish is not an objectively real object. It's purely a construct of fantasy. That's what allows it to be so alluring in the first place. Because a lot of people just don't like the way reality is.
Documentaries,3dxwu6,Biggleblarggle,-6,Mon Jul 20 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"it bleeds over into reality when men are less interested in modern women and not infantilized subservient wives, of which there are next to zero now in Japan. The unwillingness to hire women, or to elevate them to the same level as other men, has led to the tremendous population gap- women have to choose between their lives being over when they have kids, or not having kids at all, which is easier than you think because to many men you 'top out' at 25 and beyond then you're not desirable anymore."

I explained how that could happen. I didn't say that peoples' behavior wasn't influenced by their mental states and fantasies.  More to the point, though, is that it is impossible for peoples' behavior to not be influenced by their subjective experiences and thought processes. That's just what it means to be a consciousness.   Cultural and economic factors are neutral: they're emergent from the collective behavior of a lot of people. Stop trying to moralize everything and just accept that reality is the way it is. If you want to change an entire culture, you can try to do that -- and a lot of people much smarter and more powerful than you have tried... But let's at least try to cultivate the humility to recognize that not everything needs a social media ""call to action"" or whatever. Just leave people alone and stop trying to shame them or snark at them from imagined positions of self-proclaimed superiority."

It was heartbreaking for her to admit and me to hear.    She said she stopped after her schoolfriend found out and convinced her to quit after doing it for two weeks, but by that time after she had been with about 10 guys usually older business men (she was 15). It was all done through online hookups designed for such activities.  She said one refused to pay and used threats, one gave her a non-serious std and she had to go to the hospital alone, and emotionally it scarred her more then she can fathom.

I know that watching this documentary will just infuriate and sadden me, but I did read the accompanying article.  Every young Japanese woman I have ever spoken to about these kinds of things (maybe a dozen or more, but the strike rate is 100%; it's not a topic easily brought up in normal conversations) has told me they they have been sexually assaulted or worse. Like, imagine every girl's worst nightmare, and multiply it by 6... I expected them to be as furious as me, but the sad thing is, fetishising, sexualisation and general subjugation of women in Japan (usually to a smaller degree, but it's still there) is such a commonplace thing, that most of them seemed to think it was just a part of growing into a woman. In 'minor' cases, the typical reaction is to just laugh it off.  Sexual assault based on my anecdotal evidence is so much more prevalent here than in my home country (Australia), and yet is hardly talked about. Everybody knows it happens but hardly anybody sticks up for themselves or others if they witness something going down. I have personally stepped in when I've seen dudes harassing girls on the street for their phone numbers and stuff (this is usually dudes trying to recruit girls for the kinds of jobs referenced in the Vice article, other times it's just straight up personal harassment). But Japanese people will rarely/never speak up about it.  Living here for five years has somewhat desensitised me to the everyday pervasive sexism that goes on in Japan but stuff like this does get me riled up."

I watch Anime, but I feel really really uncomfortable watching young girls being shown with up skirts or just really sexual things. I don't mind watching some things that are sexual, because that makes it more real in a way, but just not with children... c'mon that's fucked up.     Lolicon is just fucked up and that probaly also contributes to this pedophilia problem. I know that it is just something that you are, just like if you're gay, but when you help pedophiles with their fantasies they are more likely to molest or rape a child because of it.

Documentaries,3e1alk,ashiron2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but as a christian I can safely say that this is not a ""christian"" kidnapping. Those people are following a doctrine that I've never found in my bible. This is sick, even if you do not believe that homosexuality(or whatever else they have seemingly ""transgressed"") is right, the bible states clearly that each man's belief is between him and God alone and no one else. Yes it does say for children to obey their parents but it does not character-shape in this way and it does say to bring your children up in the knowledge of God, but only so that they have it as an available choice to them when they are able to make a choice. I have come across churches and people akin to this, but they are usually following their own heads rather than christianity. I would apologize on their behalf if this was Christianity, but my bible tells me to not associate people who say they are brothers and sisters in Christ and are not following Christ's example, and also that ""what business is it of mine to judge those without(outside the church).""   I am however saddened that people from the outside associate this with something it is very clearly not."

Documentaries,3dv3hs,alumunum,3,Mon Jul 20 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"Very informative, but I still have a few questions.  They said that the largest organism in the world is a mycelium in Oregon. Does this mycelium have multiple mushrooms growing out of it? Is each mushroom an individual life form, or is it merely a part of one giant life form?  P.S.  Funji?"
Documentaries,3dv3hs,ThrewUpThrewAway,3,Mon Jul 20 09:26:55 2015 UTC,The mycelium is like the tree.  The Mushroom is the fruit. So the entire organism consists of a giant subterranean organism that fruits above ground. They are all part of one giant life form.
Documentaries,3dv3hs,alumunum,4,Mon Jul 20 09:45:54 2015 UTC,"Aha. So when those mushrooms release spores that grow into mycelium, does that mycelium fuse with the original, or is it a separate entity?"
Documentaries,3dv3hs,diddatweet,2,Mon Jul 20 10:39:44 2015 UTC,"I wrote a longish reply and accidentally clicked back and killed it.   But basically This journal article: ""Structural and functional interactions between extraradical mycelia of ectomycorrhizal Pisolithus isolates""  details interactions between identical sporelings that would suggest that the giant organism could have formed from dispersal of spores to subsequently meld into a single organism.   Their conclusion: The present study demonstrates that contact between mycelia of the same Pisolithus genets can result in an expanded extraradical mycelium network and enhanced nutrient translocation. Such contact can greatly enlarge the area and amount of nutrient exchange in the mycelial network, and also have an impact on the functions and nutrient cycling in the ECM symbiosis system.  However I should disclaim that it's not necessarily true for the specie in question here and there are MANY other factors."

Documentaries,3dv3hs,plexxonic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"It's not even an apples to oranges comparison.  The spores can either land nearby, in which case the resultant thing will probably fuse into the existing organism, or they might get carried off a ways, in which case they would become a separate organism.  It's not like planting two trees, where they are going to be separate entities that at most will intertangle roots."

My boat does have a trailer so it's easy for me to move long distance. It basically doubles as a camper.   The lifestyle is a transition for sure. Getting rid of a lot and downsizing. However now that I have I absolutely love it. As a human you don't need much space and stuff. I reduced my closet where it will fit in a single laundry basket.

Documentaries,3duan0,-WISCONSIN-,9,Sun Jul 19 23:50:34 2015 UTC,Craigslist.    Sailboats like this are a dime a dozen these days....   My bigass powerboat that I live on 5 days at a time in between work was soooo cheap considering what it is but for less than 15k you could probably get a really big nice sailboat that just needed some engine tlc or perhaps needed nothing...  You just have to know what you're doing around boats or be good at translating your google reading into practice.    The macgregor is (in the eyes of some sailors)  a god awful ugly boat but for practical use its probably perfect for him.    Personally I don't think I'd ever try living on a 25 unless it was something like that boat.  Otherwise it'd be too small.

I've a shoebox sized apartment in nyc that costs 5 times more in rent than your boat!   As you say, people should give it a shot. I guess most people are clueless, like me. I thought boats are expensive (may be the fancy ones are), didn't know.   How did you decide to live on the boat? spur of the moment, or you had prior sailing/living in a boat experience?"

Documentaries,3duan0,ezSpankOven,4,Mon Jul 20 02:08:00 2015 UTC,"My concern is that with maintenance costs it ends up being more expensive than a similar apartment, you'd be reliant on public transportation on land without a parking spot, and likewise you're never building any equity.   My mortgage serves as a form of forced savings, and so far its increased in value every year.  Are these concerns valid, and if so, what are the major advantages that you believe outweigh these potential cons?   I understand the appeal of downsizing for example to simplify your lifestyle, but that can be done with a small home as well, no?"
Documentaries,3duan0,felpz123,12,Mon Jul 20 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"Maintenance on a sail boat is not all that much. Especially if your backup engine is just a small outboard. Way less to take care of than a house. Why couldn't you leave your vehicle in the marina parking lot? Sure you never build any equity, but neither do people who are life long renters. If your slip rental was cheap enough you could afford to have a decent amount of money left over for savings. Gains from investing in a decent mutual fund would likely outstrip and value gains our homes see. Not to mention not paying property tax, boat insurance is likely cheaper than home insurance. Fraction of the maintenance a house requires. If you wanna move, you just go. Simple ans low cost. Not for everyone but I do see the appeal."

Documentaries,3duan0,SomeDudeinAK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:23:53 2015 UTC,"Homes are definitely cheaper than boats for maintenance. The thing about boats is that they're temperamental. If you don't know everything about the boat, the things you do to maintain them could just as easily be doing serious harm to them. I've seen way too many boat owners carry on with business as usual, not realizing that they're rotting out their decks or damaging their hulls or doing any number of things that just aren't good for the boat. The last thing you want is to be stuck with a yacht that can no longer go in the water and will cost an obscene amount to repair or dispose of."
Documentaries,3duan0,chachachickaye,5,Mon Jul 20 04:56:00 2015 UTC,"I understand the appeal of downsizing for example to simplify your lifestyle, but that can be done with a small home as well, no?    It sure can. I bought land years ago, and just built when I could afford the materials. That was the normal thing in the area I was at. Everybody started out by building a little shack, and talking about what their ""real"" house would be like, when they got around to it. Meanwhile, they'd add a room to the little shack, and another, and a deck, and keep improving on it, often winding up with something far more interesting than a ""regular"" house. I never spent more than about a thousand dollars at a time -- that was the down payment on the land. Owner financed it, no mortgage.   FWIW, the subdivision was a cheap, quick and dirty carving up of a ranch, with the bare minimum of requirements -- they just graded a few roads, and were done with it. As a result, it was very expensive to bring in electricity, so most people made their own, and the most popular setup was 2 or 3 panels for lights at night, and a generator for occasional use, like to run a power saw. Nobody even wanted the electric lines to come in. We liked being independent."
Documentaries,3duan0,SVDivergence,2,Mon Jul 20 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"If the boat's good and you take care of it, you're only really looking at the costs of routine maintenance -- which isn't so bad -- and the occasional disaster, which could be.  That being said, people don't get boats to build equity. They do it to actually live rather than exist. Though! There are some boats out there that are actually really, really popular and will continue to bring in money even if they're old."

It's an alluring lifestyle for sure but it's a shitty investment. Boats deteriorate a lot faster than houses or apartments due to the constant exposure to saltwater and the elements. The running expenses will depend on your ability to fix things, if you have to let someone else fix the motor or repair the sails the money will dry up fast. And believe me boats tend to need a lot of repairs, even new ones.  But if you work up the money to spare and make sure you have enough to start over once you tire of the adventure it will probably be the memory of a lifetime."

For sailboats, anything fiberglass built in the early 70's or late 60's were built far far stronger than they needed to be. Didn't realize quite how strong fiberglass was. These hulls could easily last 100 years.    However, the rigging (winches, stays, lines, sails) and engines and stuff can get rather costly pretty quick. And it's way harder to keep a boat from leaking (from the top, not the bottom, especially portholes and such) than it is your house.

You could probably stretch that to a decade if you were really frugal.  The big killer is boat repair.  However, the smart person will have re-build an old boat so they know everything about it.  Old marine diesel engines are pretty easy to work on, and it a really smart move to learn how to tear down and rebuild your diesel.  There are also a lot of jobs you can do anywhere.

The 6 months in the Bahamas ran about $9k. We just sold the boat for $26.5k.  Living in the States on a boat is not as glamorous as you'd imagine, you're basically living in a trailer park that floats. In a lot of marinas that cater to liveaboards more that 50% of the boats never go anywhere.   In the Bahamas you're on the hook most of the time so as long as you can fish it's pretty cheap.

Documentaries,3duan0,PM_ME_A_NEW_USERNAME,10,Mon Jul 20 03:01:04 2015 UTC,Boy you bunch sure are some cynics! Sailing has begun to fascinate me lately and I've been looking more into the viability of it as of late. For anyone else who might be interested in dipping their toes there are many forums out there where people looking for crew post and you can go there and from what I've read often they will pay for your airfare plus food aboard. Good way to learn the basics of sailing and see if you enjoy the life without having to commit to buying a boat. I am planning on trying it out this winter break if I can find someone who is willing to crew me aboard. http://www.transitionsabroad.com/listings/travel/adventure-travel/articles/around-the-world-by-sailboat.shtml
Documentaries,3duan0,intro2womenslasers,5,Mon Jul 20 01:10:39 2015 UTC,Don't be afraid to jump in as a newbie. I started by taking a basic keelboat course so I wasn't a total noob and ended up on a beautiful double masted wooden schooner as a deckhand by going on crewfinder.com. There are some really cool old timers out there who take joy in teacher greenhorns the ropes. If you're willing to work hard you're golden.
Documentaries,3duan0,lonergtg,38,Sun Jul 19 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"Hi I am in the U.S. Coast Guard let me tell you something the person who commented about marinas being floating trailer parks really described it perfectly. My job specifically is dealing with pollution which means a lot of dirt bag boat owners trying to cut corners and pump their bildges/sanitation devices (sewage tanks) straight into the water and its gross for everyone.   I would never buy a boat it's a terrible investment this documentary romanticizes the hell out of it. It even makes me want to buy a boat. And I hate rec boatss. what's the lyrics? ""Wrote a note that said be back in a minute then I bought a boat and sailed off in it?""   Anyway my point is if you're barely scraping by don't buy a boat they're really expensive and the boat isn't the expensive part. They say the two best days of a boat owners life is when they buy it and when they sell it. BOAT stands for break out another thousand. It's a hole in the water you throw money into.   If you live in or around the water check out airb&b there's probably a boat you can stay in and drink wine and have a fire near by and schmooze your girlfriend and walk around barefoot or whatever and get it out of your system, and then you can go back to your 2000 sq ft apartment with your big TV and browse reddit and all that crap when you get sick of it after a couple days. My wife and I did it in Venice it was cool.   Ok that's my 2 cents."

A few years ago, cities started giving away their parking lots to a company called Q-Park (who now is the biggest player in The Netherlands). Prices quadrupled overnight.  I used to pay 1.50 euro per day to park near the train-station and then take the train and it is now 2 euro per hour or 12 euro per day! The only thing that changed on the lot was that the two security guards that patrolled the area where fired and not replaced.  The strange thing about it all is that it was gaining income for the cities. It is numbers were black. Yet they decided to give it away to Q-Park. A company that was just new in The Netherlands and now owns nearly all public parking lots.  A company who does not make a profit because they reinvest their profit and strangely has always had a negative goodwill. As if designed not to make a profit on paper."

Documentaries,3dtxgv,ParkingPrankster,5,Sun Jul 19 20:58:38 2015 UTC,"A big problem, as David Carrod pointed out, is that the parking companies either provide their service for free, or, as in the Beavis case, pay the landowner. ParkingEye pay the landowner £52,000 a year in the Beavis car park to be allowed to operate. As it is a free car park, the only way for them to recoup this is to issue parking charges. This leads to a large number of bad practices across the industry.   Putting a ticket on a car, photographing it, then removing it, so the driver cannot pay at the discounted rate, or even appeal (appeals are only allowed for 21 days, so by the time the letter arrives after 28 days it is too late)  Ticketing drivers who visit a car park twice as if they have been there for one long stay.  Creating confusing signage and wording  Creating difficult to comply with terms and conditions, such as guess-on-exit, where you pay on exit but are required to guess how much to pay because no entry ticket is provided. Of course, the car park company know how long you stayed and could tell you, but don't. This system rakes in a £1,000,000 a year in charges per hospital where it is implemented.  Having large numbers of signs to pay lip service to signage requirements, but creating entrapment zones with no signage to generate revenue from the motorists who park in that particular area.  Changing terms and conditions without warning if the car park is not generating enough penalty revenue. A favorite is to lower the free stay period.  Charging motorists who decide not to park after reading the terms and conditions. Highview parking have just been caught out for charging motorists who drive by the road at two of their hospital car parks.  Charging motorists who break down, become ill, have an accident or otherwise suffer from an incident out of their control. ParkingEye took a motorist to court who fell on Snowdon mountain and injured his leg (the judge dismissed the claim)  This is just the tip of the iceberg."

I was staying in a hotel adjacent to the carpark and they gave me a slip to put on my dashboard for free parking which was supposed to cover me for the entire stay. I paid extra for a late 2pm checkout at the hotel but didn't notice the free ticket only covered me til the standard mid-day check out. The original fine was far more than I would have paid for even a 24-hour ticket, so I went online and the general consensus was to ignore it. After a month I start getting letters every fortnight and the price kept increasing, started at £60 and went over £200. The last letter I received from them was september of last year and it was reduced to £80, almost as if they was begging me to pay.  The thing that annoyed me was the tactics they were using to try and scare me into paying. A lot of the letters kept coming with different names in the letter header, like ""DEBT RECOVERY PLUS"" and scary sounding names like that. But doing some research online I found it was a scam tactic used by the private car park.

It wasn't a spot marked for an individual's use, it was for anyone who needed it. But because he overstayed, he got a large fine.  I know of people in my own complex who parked on what appeared to be the road, but was in fact patrolled by the parking company. Not marked bays at all. But they still got tickets.  Parking companies also sometimes have the right to actually stop people from even stopping on the land they control. I believe John Lennon Airport is an example. If you stop (say, to read a sign that lays out the details of the contract), and they catch you on camera, you get a ticket."

In general, if you follow the rules and instructions, you should be fine, be it on private land with private parking enforcement or public land with council wardens. /u/34Mbit seems to think people can just make up rules just to make money off of it.

However, I would also add that having a business model based on fines is leaving the door open for abuse. I met plenty of people who 'followed the rules' but ended up with tickets anyway.  Many of them paid out of fear or not wanting to bother fighting. For example, car park in Colchester, Essex, which allows guests to park as long as they have a guest pass - but tickets got stuck over the guest passes. In the photo 'evidence', you can't see the guest passes, so the fines were deemed legit.  That's unfair. But how could an independent body know that?

The exact opposite of the FCA would be a good one (banks pay their wages; couldn't possibly be more ironic)!   Well, what we have right now is an appeals service whose wages are funded by fines.

The problem is, if the assessor ever finds for the motorist in this location, the whole scam is over and the parking company lose one of their most profitable scams.

The signs contain a huge mass of text, in a tiny font far too small to read and are strategically placed in places where they are not visible for long. They do not comply with relevant traffic laws on size and position. So, the only way to read them is to stop, but if you stop, they charge you! When this was pointed out to the assessor he ruled that as the motorist passed a number of signs he could read a bit from each of them, piece them all together, and the signs were therefore valid. Now, this is absurd reasoning, but even if not, it simply was not true that the motorist passed a number of readable signs. The way the IPC appeal process works is that the parking company gets to see the motorist evidence, but the motorist does not get to see the parking companies. They can get hold of it afterwards though. When they did, it was found that the parking company lied and stated the motorist passed a large number of signs facing the motorist. However, in reality, all but one of these signs were 90 degrees to the motorist and so not readable as you drove by. When the motorist complained to the IPC that the parking company lied, the head of the IPC, John Davies, ruled that the lie did not matter because the motorist could see one of the signs. Now, consider that the parking company are threatening to take the motorist to court, and that John Davies, director of Gladstones solicitors will financially benefit if Gladstones are used, the whole process stinks. I understand Gladstones filed a few thousand court claims for parking operators last year, so this is a lucrative operation for them."

Documentaries,3dtxgv,CitizenTed,13,Sun Jul 19 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"Sure.   A municipality giving parking tickets has an appeals process run by the local court of that municipality. So when you appeal, you are appealing to an organization with no direct monetary interest in the outcome of your appeal.   When a private owner has your car ticketed or towed, you can again appeal in a civil court if you think the ticket or tow was unjust. And again: you'll be appealing to a disinterested party.   But the system being described in the documentary shows that the industry organization that hears appeals from drivers is run by the same people who benefit financially from appeals being denied. Their interest in denying your appeal is obvious.   That's the difference. It's like taking a vendor to a civil court for failure to deliver a product or service, and finding out that the judge who presides over the civil court is also the part owner of the vendor you're suing.

There are concerns about people's ability to fight back, of course. That's understandable and important. It's normal to demand that the tickets should be reviewed by an independent party, since this is essentially a business practice.

Documentaries,3dtxgv,herrbz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"This is true.  I used to be a security guard and I knew a guy who worked at one of of those private parking garages. He said if you over parked and didn't pay the toll they would just take down your info and then send you a bill. They would send you a couple threatening letters saying basically ""you better pay up, or else"" but if you never paid it, nothing happened. Apparently the ""excess"" parking toll was unenforceable in a court of law so the company never bothered to actually go after people who didn't pay. This was a private company though, it is probably different if you park in a state run garage."

My manager got a ticket once, and just ignored it, and nothing happened. I park there every night (6pm-2am) and haven't ever had anything in 2-3 month of use. It's frustrating how vague and hit-and-miss it can be.  Same with penalty fares on the trains. I got a ticket for riding without my railcard, when realistically the guard should able to check whether I have a railcard on a database, in case the passenger loses/forgets it. Both me and another person were stopped at the barriers by a guard - I gave my details, intending to challenge it, while the other guy just hopped the barriers and ran away. The ""independent"" company I wrote to replied with a stock copy/paste response, barely addressing anything I'd written in my email, and said that the penalty still stood.

Checking every single person takes an unfair amount of time (which would make the fare more expensive for everyone). You are basically wasting everybody else's money by forgetting it. And if the penalty helps pay for slightly cheaper fares all around then isn't that fine? It's not like the rails would be any less expensive to operate if they didn't have penalty.  If you don't want to risk the penalty then don't use the service. Train travel isn't a human right.

Do you honestly think I have never forgotten something? I forgot to check in with my rail card not that long ago, but the inspector let me off with a warning.

I wasn't suggesting I should have been afforded a free pass (I'm assuming that's why I've been downvoted), I just wanted to make a point that if I happen to forget my card, there should be better ways of checking, instead of a blanket fine. I pointed out to the company that they're saying it's OK to dodge fines as long as you're not caught, and if you do get caught, just jump the barrier, the guard won't do anything. I was curious to see what the reply would be, and in this case it was a cold, stock response, which I found disappointing. In the context of this documentary, and private companies levying fines etc, I thought it would be a worthwhile anecdote."
Documentaries,3dtxgv,Beaverman,0,Sun Jul 19 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"There's several things wrong that way of thinking.  Just because you don't always get caught doesn't mean it's sometime OK. It's never ok, but they can't check every single person all the fucking time, that would be ludicrously expensive. What they do is the hire just enough guards so that the penalty outweighs loss in travel on average, or at least so that it seems like that to the customer. That way most reasonable people will realize that they are saving nothing, and therefore not cheat.  You don't always get caught speeding, does that mean it's sometimes OK to speed?  Secondly, There are better ways of checking, but if they did that as procedure everybody would just not carry the card and demand that they check. The fine is there to deter people from leaving the card at home. The guard has no way of actually knowing if you forgot it, or if you left it on purpose.  Thirdly, It's probably not protocol for the guard to ignore you if you jump the barrier (I'm assuming you mean out of the station, otherwise you need to explain that), But the guard isn't there to rake in money, he's there to ensure no one travels on the train without having paid.

I'm not saying that everyone should be allowed to buy a railcard and never bring it to travel, so the guards have to spend time checking, and I felt stupid when I had to pay, because I realised I should've just spent an extra 5-10 minutes locating my card before I left.

I know the answer you want to hear is 'because poor people are jealous' but the closer truth is the system of extreme wealth inequality is unfair, which people don't like. It was born out of extreme violence and it has been an exploitative dehumanising system from its inception. I can understand with your attitude you're probably wealthy and disconnected from majority of poor in this world, probably indoctrinated and self-entitled as is necessary to have such skewered perception of reality, but if you genuinely want to understand, which I somehow doubt is the case, then all you have to do is read the social history of the development of capitalism, and stop thinking in the language of economic theory which is an extremely intellectually dishonest field of academia itself, designed for and by capitalists for the purpose of self-justification of promotion of unethical behaviour.

This is where the wealth is being accumulated from to a large degree, brought to you by your favourite western multinational companies and supported by a host of corrupt governments, dodgy trade deals and sketchy security companies.  Also, there are millions of software developers who live pretty much like wage slaves, just as a plumber or builder who is working for a large construction company. When corporate groups control as much resources as they do, its much harder for a single developer to come along and compete. So they just get job with them, and the cycle of wealth inequality increases. Then you end up with Microsoft, Apple, Walmart, and god knows they have been horrific for smaller businesses. They have been quite terrible for society at large, destroying diversity and competition in their fields.

The direction in which our society moves is largely determined by the governments of economic powers and the international business world, because the two are so intimately interconnected.

But that's never the conversation, because it ignores a massive swath of humanity (we'll conservatively call this group: all the people).  Lets take some real world examples.  I am not the 1%. I still made just north of 200k last year. My best friend makes 65k.  We're both home owners, me in the center of a major US city, him in the suburbs. We both drive cars that are 2013 or newer. Neither of us are in debt save for our mortgages.  Both of us do not struggle to pay said mortgage.  Truthfully, the actions of the ""ultra elite political manipulators"" are pretty irrelevant to both of us. I'm willing to bet their pretty meaningless to you too.  Sure, you may have opinions about various topics. Those opinions may differ from the ultra wealthy. But they don't really affect you in a real world way.  Now, you could argue that some rich guy came in and bought your business and put you out of work. That's valid.  But I watched a guy on my block, had a net worth around 60k, got a big ass bank loan, bought a place, put everyone out of work, revamped it and opened a different business that's become very profitable. He was hardly ""the ultra rich"". Just a businessman.  You're correct in that there are important decisions to be made on topics such as climate change, energy, etc.  And you're correct that the motives of the ultra wealthy may not be in the best interests of you or I, or the earth as a whole.  But I disagree that they're the ones in control.  Remember the old Four Boxes of Liberty saying?  In case of tyranny use the in the following order: Soap Box, Ballot Box, Jury Box, Ammo Box.  We've seen ""the people"" all over the world use all 4 (even in your lifetime, however old you might be) to great effectiveness.  Hell, you might be saying, ""powerful 1%ers have been keeping me down because I'm gay"". And you'd be right if that were the case. But that little problem seemed to stop at ""jury box"" (and allegory of course for the courts, in this case, the Supreme Court). The system does work. Just not always quickly.  Why do you think the Chinese government is freaking out over everything? Why do you think they arrest everyone and stamp out even a whiff of rumors on social media, and will manipulate their economy to show growth? Because they know that all their massive military, money, and everything else, won't stop 1 billion people who have had enough.

Yes, there's crime, more than maybe other parts of the U.S., but it's pretty avoidable and not a war zone everywhere as they make it seem.   It's all gang violence (mostly black v black). Not a problem anyone can fix, they (thugs/gangs) need to fix it themselves.   Guy says ""police aren't protecting us"", well fuck I wouldn't want to be in between a gang gun fight. It's their problem and they just blame politics and everything else but themselves. Pick up a book instead of a gun. I understand the conditions aren't the most ideal, but it's possible to be successful when you're from the south side. If there's a will, there's a way.   When I was reading the Chicago tribune last week, I saw a credit at a Chicago public college was like $86 for one credit. Fuck I wish I could pay that for one credit lol what I'm trying to say is there are resources for them and it's possible, but you have to be motivated too. When you're raised with parents who were gangsters, it'll be tough, but it's possible.   I honestly thought it was a good idea to have the national guard walk the streets.   Edit: at 16:45, the dude says ""you got like Fox News and shit, just saying what's happening and not doing anything about it""  Haha it's the fucking news, bro!

Now the real question is whether the US and china and the rest of the world is too intertwined for conflict. How will the established powers manage the rise of china and the resurgence of russia.  100 years ago, as japan rose in the east and germany rose in the west, the established powers tried to limit their rise and it ended in a world wars.  The last time we pivoted to asia was in the early 1900s to limit japan's rise and to prepare for war with japan. Today, we are pivoting to asia once again, but this time to deal with china. And in europe, european powers are trying to limit russian power like they tried to limit german power one hundred years ago.  As they say, history never repeats, but it does rhyme.

Documentaries,3dmet8,GraveRobbingBastard,50,Sat Jul 18 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"As a brazilian growing up in the 80s I can tell that Senna was more than a hero, he was our Superman. Football team didn't strike any important win since1970 world cup. Senna came right in the shadow of champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet and showed his talent in his first year, with a crappy car. His death was unreal and it felt just like the comic book Death of Superman, with all the pilots carrying his coffin. It was a real national mourning. I remember watching from my classroom window the helicopters flying over his coffin, that was being slowly transported in an open firetruck across the city,  from the airport to some public building. The documentary also shows the end of the romantic days of F1 where good pilots could make a difference and the begining of the eletronic era."
Documentaries,3dmet8,pull_the_handle,14,Sat Jul 18 03:52:35 2015 UTC,"As an American racing fan who also grew up in the late 80s/early 90s, I can say it was devastating to me as well. I know it was more so for you as a Brazilian with him being your countryman, but this man was larger than life and just an amazing talent. When it happened I just could not believe what I was watching. Senna and Ratzenberger died, and Barrichello almost died. It was a horrific weekend. No disrespect to Michael Schumacher, as he was a great talent, but Michael would not have had anywhere close to the amount of championships and wins he had if Ayrton had lived."
Documentaries,3dmet8,JulianWyvern,7,Fri Jul 17 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"You're technically right, but not because Senna would've won more than Schumacher, but rather because Schumacher would likely die in his 1999 accident. Which he survived because Senna's accident improved the safety standards  A Brazilian magazine did a small study on this, so I'm afraid it's only in Portuguese, if you want to read the full thing it's basically ""If Ayrton Senna hadn't died"" http://super.abril.com.br/comportamento/e-se-ayrton-senna-nao-tivesse-morrido"

I never really thought of it that way, but I see your point. Except for Jules Bianchi and his horrible crash, we haven't lost anyone since then. I know technically he is still alive but I just read somewhere his recovery isn't going well. And then poor Michael and what happened to him... It is hard to see our racing heroes like that.  Edit: spelling"
Documentaries,3dmet8,Bulovak,9,Fri Jul 17 22:04:34 2015 UTC,What makes your post even more morbid is that Bianchi died today :/
Documentaries,3dmet8,pull_the_handle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:19:08 2015 UTC,Wow I didn't know that. Sad to hear but merciful in a way. No one should have to live like he was and Schumi is now.
Documentaries,3dmet8,pull_the_handle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:57:20 2015 UTC,RIP Jules. I had just read an article last week where his dad said he told him some time before his accident that if he was incapacitated and couldn't race he wouldn't want to live. That situation was terrible. That man got a point in a car that could barely make the 107 rule. I don't know what would have happened but I could have seen him in that second Ferrari one day. Sad.
Documentaries,3dmet8,makingredditangery,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:22:21 2015 UTC,"Micheal would have had just as many titles as he has now, regardless if Senna was still racing or not. Shumi would have still won the 1994 and 1995 championships. By 2000 Senna would have been in deep decline due to his age. To add to that, he would be going against Shumi in his prime again the unstoppable Ferrari team."
Documentaries,3dmet8,pull_the_handle,2,Sat Jul 18 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"A good point. That Ferrari was magic. But I still think Senna could have taken 1 more championship with him. There was also the one with Prost that could have went his way easily and added another for a total of possibly five championships for him. Again no offense to Michael, but in a lesser car other than those Ferraris he would not have been as good. Senna could get more out of a mediocre car.  Edit: spelling"
Documentaries,3dmet8,makingredditangery,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:16 2015 UTC,We can play the if then game all day but Senna would lose that one as well. Prost lost a championship by one point to lauda and would have beaten Senna in 1988 under the current rules. He also could have taken a second championship away from Senna if Senna had not disgracefully take each other out in 1989. This leaves Senna with one and Prost with 6 WDC. Schumacher would take 2006 if he had better reliability and 1999 if he had not broken his legs when his brakes failed. This leaves Schumacher with 9 championships. To say Senna got more out of a mediocre car is very subjective and I would say Schumacher was just as impressive given he spent more time in his career in a mediocre car when compared to Senna.
Documentaries,3dmet8,claurbor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:25 2015 UTC,"Actually Prost lost to Lauda by half a point, the smallest margin in history. That year half points were awarded at Monaco in a famous race because it was stopped early due to rain. You will know the one. Prost was in the lead but Senna was catching, so Prost was pointing at the sky whenever he past down the main straight. Jacky Ickx controversially stopped the race without consulting the race stewards, handing Prost the victory.  Interesting footnote, according to Martin Brundle, Stefan Bellof (Brundle's teammate) was catching Senna just as quickly, so Bellof could have taken the win instead of Senna, pushing Prost to third."
Documentaries,3dmet8,makingredditangery,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"To add on to that, if the race had gone full distance, even if Prost hadn't won, he would have won the championship."
Documentaries,3dmet8,pull_the_handle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:58:22 2015 UTC,"Agree he was impressive. Prost retired at the top of the game, Senna was gone, and Michael became the man that year on. We will never know what kind of battles  we would have seen with all of them in good cars. But the Ferrari team did some shady stuff as well. Just ask Barichello and most of MS other Ferrari teammates. Look at Nico and and the sabotage they try to pull on each other now."
Documentaries,3dmet8,claurbor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:38:15 2015 UTC,"A highly dubious point. Senna was one of those drivers who hadn't lost any speed as he aged, something his close friend Sid Watkins would nag at him about.  Think of Damon Hill's performance in the Williams. If he had not died, Senna at Williams would have taken the '94 title. Schumacher won it by crashing Hill off the road. Few people seriously think that Senna would not have outscored Hill at that point and taken the title.  '95 is a bit of a toss-up, but consider that Hill's poor performance that year let to him getting dropped after '96 despite winning the championship. I say Senna has a very strong claim to the title.  '96, well Hill won it as Schumacher moved to Ferrari with a mediocre car. If Senna had stayed at Williams, I say he takes it.  At that point, this gives Senna 5 or 6 titles to 0 or 1 for Schumacher.  Or an alternative history. Senna had voiced a wish to join Ferrari at some point, likely to finish his career. By '96 Schumacher is sick of losing to Senna. So Senna joins Ferrari in '96 and quite likely never wins another title (he's getting old, plus Senna @ Ferrari is less likely to draw the dream team of Ross Brawn and Rory Byrne.) Schuey joins McLaren or Williams instead and starts taking championships. He may never have made it to Ferrari, who don't have that period of dominance without Brawn and Byrne. Or maybe they do, who knows.  Either way I say Senna definitely takes '94, with a strong claim on '95, takes '96 if he stays that long with Williams. Minimum one more title to Senna and probably more, dropping Schuey's final tally."
Documentaries,3dmet8,makingredditangery,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:56 2015 UTC,"1994 was only close due to Schumacher being penalized unfairly to keep the championship close after Senna's death. 1995 Schumacher would have taken it as well. Yes it would have been closer but I really doubt Senna would have been able to pull it off. 1996 is possible that Senna would have won but his age would have been at a time that F1 drivers really start to drop off. I also fear that Hill would have taken some points from Senna. But, I would say it is a 70% chance he takes 1996. 50-50 for 1997. At this point I don't see Senna being able to put up much of a fight. His only chance would be to take on Hakkinen at McLaren and lets be real it wouldn't be that much of a fight in the end at his age. Schumacher will win championships where ever he goes due to the dream team. I don't see it being likely that Senna goes to Ferrari with Williams being the best team at the time."

Documentaries,3dmet8,Lyongirl,23,Sat Jul 18 04:50:40 2015 UTC,I saw this documentary in a theater. My husband loves F1 racing while I pick favorites based on how much I like their names. I'm pretty sure I was the only person in the theater that didn't know he died at the end. I was so invested in the documentary I actually cried. This documentary is just that good.

Documentaries,3dmet8,NaiveMind,6,Fri Jul 17 16:36:21 2015 UTC,I knew what happened. I was crying at the beginning seeing him young in the kart tracks.  My father has a friend who was his mechanic in the karting days. It hurts deep.
Documentaries,3dmet8,jibsand,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Shit, I'm crying just thinking about it.   When I was a kid I went to USGP in Indianapolis. We sat with a group of south american fans who were all wonderfully generous and friendly. When I asked who was the best driver of all time they got quiet and one of them removed his hat and said ""Aryton Senna was the greatest driver that will ever live."" His friend followed up by saying ""He was the best. He was so good god took him from us, because we didn't deserve him.""  I knew nothing of him before then but I could tell by the gravitas of their words that he must have been really amazing. When I got home I went to library and learned as much as I could about him."

Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received that it overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby.[131] This despite the fact Senna no longer drove for McLaren and that McLaren in the preceding seasons did not use Honda power. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda[132] and was beloved in Japan, where he achieved a near mythic status. For the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger.[133]       - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna#Funeral"

Documentaries,3dmet8,mypantsareonmyhead,2,Fri Jul 17 21:22:20 2015 UTC,"True. People also cannot emotionally ""connect"" with the cars any more - they are driven now simply with video game mentality from the fans' perspective: just throttle, gas, and steering wheel.  People who watched racing in the Senna era and before, knew drivers were using clutch, gear lever, and so on, and needed mechanical sympathy for the car to be on the limit yet last the distance; fans felt a far deeper passion and respect for the drivers' talent back then."

If you read my comment, I'm talking about (and specifically used the term) fans' ""perspective"".  Compare how many times Ayrton Senna changes gear in his legendary on-board Monaco qualifying lap. And we know, that he is performing a deft mechanical function with each and every one of the scores of gear changes (and not just the gear lever - he's simultaneously manipulating clutch pedal, brake pedal, and throttle. And we watch and know, there is no way on earth we could do that ourselves.  Then watch any on-board footage of a current car. braking hard from flat out in top gear, down to a 1st gear hairpin. How many times does the driver fiddle and fuck with his steering wheel buttons?  NONE. That's how many.

Schumacher didn't really have a proper rival, I mean there were Hill, Villeneuve and Heineiken or whats his name, but no one really cared about any of them, they could have been replaced with blowup dolls and no one would have noticed.

I saw his crash live and when I saw the Marshal's run up to his car and then just stand there I knew he died instantly.

Football team didn't strike any important win since1970 world cup. Senna came right in the shadow of champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet and showed his talent in his first year, with a crappy car. His death was unreal and it felt just like the comic book Death of Superman, with all the pilots carrying his coffin. It was a real national mourning. I remember watching from my classroom window the helicopters flying over his coffin, that was being slowly transported in an open firetruck across the city,  from the airport to some public building. The documentary also shows the end of the romantic days of F1 where good pilots could make a difference and the begining of the eletronic era."

Prost responded and went to pass Senna at the end of the first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at 290 km/h (180 mph). Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away.

Documentaries,3ds9ce,mustachetwerkin,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:36:05 2015 UTC,"Alex Jones has been around for a while and in some respects can claim some responsibility for the shape of modern discussion regarding totalitarianism, corruption and globalism on the internet today. Alex Jones did a lot to turn people on to the concept of false flag attacks, subterfuge and espionage used by governments against their own people. Alex Jones haa provided a great service. The problem is there hasn't been any dramatic, catalyzing events like 911 in the past 14 years that drew a large audience to Alex Jones and infowars and I can't help but feel like it's slowly sliding further and further into a sensationalist posture in order to attract views, attention and cement their more eccentric userbase. I mean the aggressive sales of snake oil is so disappointing to see but in some senses I can understand it - if they can get away with it and people are dumb enough to buy it, why not? I just think that Alex Jones established for himself an enormous reserve of credibility that he has slowly started to mine over the past few years and it's a damn shame to see. Infowars does inform, but I've noticed a tangible change in it's approach to events and its focus less and less on the subterfuge that governments use against the people and more on the topics that serve only to divide people and turn them against each other - in some respects no differently, as any mainstream media outlet. It's a shame because Alex Jones did a lot of great activism in the past and that should be recognized. This is a good documentary that makes a lot of great points."

There was legitimately a race to discover the structure of DNA and they did it. They knew they needed Franklin's information and it was provided to them by Wilkins. She wasn't eligible for their Nobel Prize (Watson, Crick, AND Wilkins) because she had died.  His intellectual accomplishments were astonishing and they're being whittled away because people don't like him. Look at it this way, nobody shits on Einstein because somebody else proved that his ""thought experiments"" were true.  (Sorry to go off on you, it's not personal. Watson was a radical and important thinker in biology and I think that his accomplishments are marginalized because people don't like him.)"

I suppose that my feelings come from listening to a few of his talks and reading some of his writing. It seemed to me that he was a genuinely unique thinker who had a real ability to visualize how molecular biology worked in three dimensions. There is, I believe, some parallel to Einstein in terms of career path. Neither made any additional great discoveries, but their role as leaders and philosophers was important in guiding the scientific community.  eta - just so you know where I'm coming from, I have a BS in Physiology and Neurobiology and I'm an MD working as a pathologist."

The central criticism seems to accuse Diamond of attributing technological advancement solely to the availability of resources.  Some criticism on Reddit goes further: one redditor wrote that Diamond believes that two groups of people given the same resources will develop identical societies.  They also accuse him of cherry-picking his evidence.  Judge for yourself but I liked GG&S and also Collapse.
Documentaries,3djbkf,Algernon_Moncrieff,25,Fri Jul 17 07:02:14 2015 UTC,"""Diamond believes that two groups of people given the same resources will develop identical societies"" I've read both Collapse and GG&S nowhere does he say that. The only thing he implies is that if two societies are given equal resources they would develop technology at a similar rate, of course this is not accounting for cultural differences; for instances if all labor and technology was used to make monuments for their god-like leaders (word?) they would fall behind etc. The book is pretty ""dumbed down"" I guess to make it more accessible and less tedious for the average reader so he only really gives evidence that proves his theories, I can see why it wouldn't be really respected in any scientific or historical circles."
Documentaries,3djbkf,Lysergic-25,11,Thu Jul 16 22:07:15 2015 UTC,"It's bad enough to dismiss his book outright, but to not even know his central theory while you do it is just as bad as what people are claiming he does."
Documentaries,3djbkf,TheWarriorDude,13,Thu Jul 16 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"I imagine it's for similar reasons that some discredit Howard Zinn's, A People's History of the United States. It's because the work attempts to show history through a particular lens, for which many historians try to appeal to a middle-ground objectivity that sometimes becomes ambiguous. Rather people should recognize the merits of such work in the broader context; that is, consider it another drop in the bucket to a more well-rounded viewpoint on the matter. Basically, if such books are your only sources of information, you might over-apply what is otherwise a rational concept.  That said, though I'm not a historian, I'm convinced Diamond's thesis has merit even if there may be exceptions. I recently took a history of engineering class and caught right away that geographical location played a large role in addition to the resources available at one's disposal. On the flip-side, what that nation lacked also attributed to the technological route they took. For instance: Egypt had an abundance of stone quarries and the Nile. Thus their understanding of hydraulic engineering was utilized to provide an abundance of food, which fed a large population, which allowed for the specialization, which led to (at the time) advanced stonework."
Documentaries,3djbkf,lennybird,6,Thu Jul 16 23:32:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure they're so similar. Zinn is far from objective, instead structuring his essays to a more radical viewpoint with his single, tired thesis. It's repetitive to the point of monotony, especially as the reader approaches modern times, yet it proves its point of downtrodden Americans through the nation's history with specific evidence from specific circumstances. With Zinn, I don't see the cherry picking that some people are noting here in Diamond's work. Diamond is a pure sensationalist, working with half-baked theories that appeal only on first thought, but not on the second. Of course geography affects the way a society grows, there's no groundbreaking thought there, but Diamond's attention is so fixated on geography that it refuses to note development beyond this factor. I also thought the lack of concrete references in his book to be irritating, but the writing is just a pleasure to read. Diamond appeals to that middle group objectivity, yet to even the average reader, it is oversimplified and without any real legs to stand on after that preliminary bookshop glance."

I feel he just wasn't interested in describing the role of individual actions and historical chance     Because that's already covered by (traditional) historians, which does not offer much of an explanation for the dominance of western culture, other than some (unmentioned) factor intrinsic to the actual people involved."

And for the most part, Diamond is doing what we all should be doing, which is making history and anthropology more interesting and palatable to the general public. On the other hand, his writings are incredibly problematic and often paint incredibly complex phenomena with broad strokes. Pop-sci is great and serves an important purpose, but if you're only exposed to Diamond's work, you end up missing and misunderstanding the important intricacies of these issues. What is Diamond's biggest problem, is that he makes arguments about people and cultures that have been debunked (or understood as problematic) by anthropologists and historians for years. He isn't writing anything new, he is just rehashing old concepts, complete with the same tired, misunderstood themes, but tying these concepts up in a shiny new bow. And, to Diamond's credit, this is because he ISN'T an anthropologist and historian, and is probably ignorant of these issues because he lacks the theoretical background (which is a huge issue since he has an undergraduate degree in both).  I've read most of his stuff, and I find it fun to read, and thought-provoking but in the end, it mostly fails to live up to it's promises. Diamond is part of the AAAS, but it's the largest scientific society, so that is hardly a unique accomplishment. He is part of the society, not for his ""anthropological writings"" but because he is a scientist/ornithologist/geographer."

This is funny because sometimes in /askhistorians he's called racist, when he specifically, explicitly, forwards the notion that geographical traits leading to easier, earlier subsistence led to Eurasian dominance, not biological advantages.

Also, I found ""Good Calorie, Bad Calorie"" a very interesting book at how science can get stuck in a rut.

GG&S gets a lot of hate from people who either entirely misinterpret it or willfully misrepresent it as a way to score silly academic 'points.'  One somewhat valid criticism is that it is reductionist and deterministic.  I will agree with that, but so are a great many text books written by 'real' anthropologists and historians.  The trope of inevitability certainly wasn't invented by Diamond, and I would counter that his work requires context to really be understood.  I would use GG&S as a way to talk about environmental and geographic factors that were undeniably a big part of why people are the way they are.  The reason kids take intro anthro classes (aside from thinking they'll be an easy grade...) is because they're interested in why people are a certain way.  You can't talk about the incredible range of variation of cultures across time and around the world without the sort of 'background' Diamond is trying to provide.  You can't understand why Europeans had cannon without understanding the ebb and flow of culture and technology that spanned half way around the world in this huge crucible of human interaction.  You can't understanding adaptations to the environment (one of the major driving forces in cultural change) without knowing all the things that make up the environment beyond the basic natural world.  I can't tell you how many times I would get students who had ideas about inferiority and say things like ""Well, how come Europeans had all this fancy technology but Native Americans/Islanders/Whatever didn't?""  GG&S goes a long way in helping diffuse a lot of these negative misconceptions and create a dialog for the actual reasons.  Is there a whole heck of a lot of stuff that Diamond doesn't talk about?  Certainly, but I don't think the value of Diamond's work is to be this grand unified theory.  The value of it is that he created probably the most accessible and understandable foundational text for human cultural history ever.  The nuances of cultural theory are taught later, but for the 99% of people that are exposed to GG&S and nothing beyond that, it makes for a good, basic primer on how biological determinism is basically crap and where somebody happens to find themselves geographically is incredibly important.  In my experience, academia is just mad that Diamond wrote a best-selling anthropology book without being an anthropologist and therefore not part of the 'club.'  I also have to chuckle a bit when I see historians cry about Diamond not having the intellectual authority to talk about culture and culture change.  Nobody 'owns' a particular body of knowledge, but if they did, this particular plot of smarts would be quite a ways down the road from Historytown.  I fully expect a flurry of anonymous downvotes from the frustrated academics because this opinion is not a popular one among them."
Documentaries,3djbkf,DerProfessor,2,Thu Jul 16 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"As I said in a reply to a post above:  I'm a tenured historian at an R-1 university, and have taught Diamond's book in an undergraduate seminar….once.  To get myself to read it.  Never again.  It's profoundly misleading.   Yes, it does seem (try?) to offer a critique of that biological determinism (racism) popular in the 19th century.  And yes, it's well written, lots of great information.  I even liked it…!  As someone who works on this for a living, I instantly spot his stereotypes, his wild generalizations, and his cultural myopia--which means I can ignore those weaknesses, and concentrate on the great facts buried in there. (who knew that zebras were impossible to domesticate??   I'd never thought about it.)    In my experience, academia is just mad that Diamond wrote a best-selling anthropology book without being an anthropologist and therefore not part of the 'club.' I also have to chuckle a bit when I see historians cry about Diamond not having the intellectual authority to talk about culture and culture change.    Your critique of historians' (and/or anthropologists') scorn is facile.  (and wrong). The problem with Diamond is that it is a book written by an amateur pretending to be about history, and makes huge claims about historical forces and causation… without engaging with (or even reading, apparently) any historiography whatsoever.   His intro chapter is a joke: ""why haven't historians tried to explain why great white men have cargo while poor polynesian have none?"" Literally tens of thousands of sophisticated, subtle, and thoroughly-researched books have been written by historians (who have dedicated their lives to researching this topic), on every angle of this question, from the ""whys"" of industrialization to the ""hows"" of imperialism to the ""when"" of globalization…  There have been histories of cultural exchange in pre-history, histories about why Europeans devoted themselves to pursuing technology, even histories about why the whole question of technological superiority is actually a culturally-loaded one. There is a dense, sophisticated, answer to this ""question,"" just waiting there for you in your university or public library. And the the ENTIRE FIELD of geography was invented in the 1880s (amidst the second wave of imperialism) to answer this ""question""--before being thoroughly discredited by (again) literally thousands of histories written after the 1950s…   I personally enjoyed the book.  But it is wrong-headed.  And yes, the popularity of it grated.     As I wrote in another post:   It's a bit as if I--with a minor in physics back from my undergrad days--decided to write my own take on unified field theory… without bothering to look at any of the work done by physicists in the last 30 years. Yes, it would be a fun book to write;  and yes, anyone who knows absolutely nothing about physics might well be convinced.  But serious physicists would look at it, see the flaws in 2 seconds, and never look at it again.  And if it sold a million copies, and came up on Reddit again and again and again,  they would pull their hair out."
Documentaries,3djbkf,oodil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:01:01 2015 UTC,I don't think the value of Diamond's work is to be this grand unified theory. The value of it is that he created probably the most accessible and understandable foundational text for human cultural history ever.   Very well said. Thank you for making me realise this.
Documentaries,3djbkf,TheWarriorDude,46,Fri Jul 17 10:28:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to run a counter to all of the ""Jared Diamond is hated by everyone including his own mother!"" circlejerking.  No, he is not. Nor is Guns, Germs and Steel uniformly hated by everyone with a PhD in every field ever. I happened to meet plenty of professors in a number of fields who found his works interesting, if not always perfect (find me an academic who is always right and I'll find you a living passenger pigeon.) Yes, there are critics. Yes, there are problems with his hypothesis and some of his arguments. But that's not enough to entirely dismiss his works-- Diamond himself is a very smart, very good academic who also happens to be a bit of an iconoclast by today's standards. That doesn't make him wrong in and of itself.   Watch the documentary, read the book, and then also read the criticisms. Don't just take the words of random redditors who have likely not read the works themselves and are parroting whatever someone else said. I don't entirely agree with Diamond, but he does make some interesting points in his works that, while not perfect, are thought provoking and might lead you to further analysis.   One more thought: Diamond's work considers in a lot of ways that humans are simply animals reacting to environmental pressures. It's an interesting alternative (albeit deterministic) to mainstream historical thinking that human behavior is generally calculated and political. I think that a lot of people dislike his hypothesis because they dislike the idea that humans, like other animals, respond to their environment to a greater degree."

I think he's very well respected actually, it's just that his ideas and views are just heavily disagreed with and many people have offered up lots of counter arguments and research to his conclusion.  That being said I think his book and this documentary is still worth the read.

Documentaries,3djbkf,its_never_lupus,47,Fri Jul 17 04:53:23 2015 UTC,"From what I see overall objection is the book over-simplifies. The author picks on a handful of significant but not earth-shattering events, and presents them as the only cornerstones of civilisation. It's the same trap as the authors of  popular books on the history of salt, or of cod, or corn, or alcohol and their effect on civilisation. The authors get caught up in some detail and try to spin a big narrative.   And then historians get really irritated by lay people who've read one vaguely subversive book on history and think they know truths that actual academics are too blinded to see."
Documentaries,3djbkf,Drop_John,16,Fri Jul 17 01:26:13 2015 UTC,"I get that and I can agree, even though as a biologist a lot of what he says makes a lot of sense to me.   Of course the book simplifies, as it tries to find trends over thousands of years of history and whole continents. I didn't get that impression about ""the only cornerstones of civilisation"", as he never says those are the only factors that exist, he just says that they exist and they had quite an influence (e.g., the West-East orientation of Eurasia vs. the North-South orientation of the Americas and Africa), something that is not very debatable for the most part.  What I see (as a layman) is historians being on a different page than Diamond and expecting him to do something that he couldn't and didn't set out to do with his book. Also lots of academic bickering over things that look very important to academics, but insignificant to outsiders who just want to understand the world a little better. (It reminds me of the debate on the mechanisms of evolution: the different positions are like night and day to biologists, but laymen either can't see the difference or don't really care.)"

Documentaries,3djbkf,BlueHatScience,3,Thu Jul 16 21:21:09 2015 UTC,"I think that is his true value - bringing to the forefront the fact that the determining factors of how populations (including human populations) interact with their environment and change over time are not just political / social, but also - and to a far greater degree than you would think when studying history - by ecology.   Historiography is arguably too divorced from ecology (evolutionary behavioral ecology) to capture this important dimension adequately. Anthropology does much better here - but at least in the public perception, I would argue that the ecological dimension of history hadn't been widely appreciated.  Sure, Jared Diamond probably overshoots and exaggerates the relative contribution of ecology vs culture somewhat, and is thus somewhat simplistic.  ... and if, as it seems, he did actually ""fudge facts"", that's a rather more serious issue, and it speaks to the exaggerations I mentioned. But that does not detract from the fact that it's very important to draw more attention to ecology and not neglect the biological dimensions entirely and focus solely on political, cultural and social dimensions.  An often mentioned rather succinct example is also related by Josiah Bartlett in The West Wing - the story of the professor who asks ""Why is there endless conflict in the middle east?"", and after some uncomfortable silence, a student begins ""Well - there are milleia old religious and political divisions as well as ensuing territorial disputes..."" - ""NO!"", shouts the professor - ""It's because it's HOT! - and people have not enough clean WATER!"".   It's not that it's the whole story, but it draws much needed attention to an often neglected but essential part of the whole story."

Documentaries,3dj6j1,beatlejuicex,-11,Fri Jul 17 13:02:44 2015 UTC,Here is a related documentary by frontline. This documentary goes into much more detail on how the meth epidemic works out. Turns out one of the active ingredients in meth is ephedrine and only like 7 companies in the world produce it. It is mainly produced for cough syrup but can also be used to make meth. Also interesting to note is that the purity of meth is critical. The higher purity means the more ephedrine. The higher the purity the more addictive. In this documentary they talked about how the cartels gave the meth away for free. Well the reason they did that was because very high purity meth will make you 100% addicted after the first hit. There is a direct correlation between the purity of the meth and the amount of users.  That is also one of the reasons why even experimenting with drugs is extremely risky.
Documentaries,3dj6j1,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,12,Thu Jul 16 22:41:27 2015 UTC,Well the reason they did that was because very high purity meth will make you 100% addicted after the first hit.   This is complete and utter bullshit.

Documentaries,3dj6j1,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,4,Fri Jul 17 01:06:13 2015 UTC,Which you have not done. There is no drug that makes you addicted after the first high. Pretty sure the very definition of addiction contradicts that statement.

I know out here in CA, you have to show ID to buy and they limit the amount you can buy too. I think the limit is like 6 bottles per month or something like that.  For the cartels they are probably still able to buy the raw ephedrine in bulk from somewhere. As far as I know, they can't produce it themselves because it is extremely hard to produce so only major companies can produce it. If those companies stopped producing it then meth would pretty much disappear. Just like how quaaludes are no longer around. Ironically, quaaludes were produced by Pfizer and heavily abused. In 1985, Pfizer simply stopped production of them which pretty much completely eliminated the supply. Now no one is addicted to them anymore, lol.  That documentary I listed is well worth the watch. It talks about how the cartels always had certain connections to get the ephedrine. When one connection was lost, they always had another one."

Documentaries,3dj6j1,kryptobs2000,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:13:26 2015 UTC,Ephedrine is the molecule that gets you high so it it the most important element to have if you are making meth. When I talk about purity of meth I am talking about how much ephedrine it has in it.
Documentaries,3dj6j1,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,3,Fri Jul 17 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"The amount of ephedrine is important to making meth, but not using meth. The amount of ephedrine you have dictates how much meth you have. I don't know how to make meth, but say 1oz of ephedrine makes 1oz of methamphetamine. That means the dealer/manufacturer has 287 'baggies' of meth (assuming a bag is 100mg). 100mg of meth is 100mg of meth to the end user regardless how much ephedrine the manufacturer had, there's nothing more or less addicting about it.

There are no in betweens, not a lot of opportunities and living in a crazy Panopticon call-out culture probably isn't helping all that much either.

Short version:  When the FBI's COINTELPRO program was discovered, they switched from overt methods like assassinations and political imprisonment to covert methods like flooding poor neighborhoods with drugs and mass incarceration via the drug war."

Documentaries,3dip6y,Mtat78,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:20 2015 UTC,We aren't. The socialist agenda of the times were so strong that any inequality situation was deemed politically relevant. It was the climax of the cold war and the relations between US and Sweden was very frosty to the point of US recalling the ambassador from Sweden. When the swedish prime minister got assassinated in 1986 there was many who believed it was CIA who tagged him.

Documentaries,3diszw,lovekr08,20,Thu Jul 16 18:19:22 2015 UTC,It is predominantly a political conflict though not a religious one. The divide along religious lines is simply a historical artifact and suits the political agenda of both sides but there have been many protestant nationalists and being a catholic doesn't mean you can't be a unionist either. As I said it is a political conflict more so than a religious one but religion plays a supporting role.

Simply going to church or voting one way or the other (unless enough of the electorate decided for a change but apathy prevails) is not actually going to do any good for the average reasonable person in NI. The churches and political parties are some of the main actors in perpetuating the identity politics of social division in NI."

I live in Glasgow where there's always a march the weekend before the 12th I feel i have a unique view on the matter, i was very much raised as a protestant(now i see my self as a atheist), but my family origins are firmly rooted in Donegal in Ireland my grandfather was from Donegal and was a catholic. i myself grew up around a fair bit of bigotry (nothing as bad as ireland) but alot of hate all the same and enough to sour me on the whole thing. in Glasgow there's a weird connection between this and football. its funny the amount of people who are protestant or catholic but have never seen the inside their supposed place of worship or even been confirmed lol )  Ive been to these marches as a child and have fond memories with some of my family, but as i got older, the more i realised how much ( at least in my humble opinion) is wrong with these marches.   There are always a few bad eggs that spoil the fun for everyone in every event, but for me at these marches there seems to be alot of them, lots of people causing trouble fuelled by Alcohol and drugs, and violence increases dramatically around these marches.   I believe in freedom of expression, but these sorts of thing breeds Bigotry, tension & violence, all for what ? a victory in the battle of boyne  ? a battle against an English(and catholic) king by the famous King Billy although most probably dont know king billy was backed and funded by the pope of the day and head of the Catholic Church, Pope Alexander VIII. irony. ultimately the whole thing seems so silly to me.

Only very rarely did anyone see Protestant Republicans or Catholic Unionists.  Both the UVF and IRA were claiming God was on their side and that mandated their war crimes.

They clearly seem to feel that it is an important part of their history and culture. By stopping parades in the Republic it seems to send the message that their culture is not accepted (of course there are reasons why there culture may not be accepted). In know there are other reason why Unionists are opposed to a united Ireland, I just though this was an interesting though. i am also aware that there are some parades in the Republic, but these are often limited to areas close to the border with the north.   TL;DR: By not allowing parades in the Republic are Unionists being pushed further away from the idea of a united Ireland for fear that their culture will be oppressed?"
Documentaries,3diszw,River562,9,Thu Jul 16 19:58:21 2015 UTC,"The fact that they are celebrating the killing of Irish Catholic men. No, I don't think it will be accepted in Republic of Ireland.

Documentaries,3diszw,JayT2,2,Thu Jul 16 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, though I'd have to say I disagree with you on the point that it celebrates killing Irish Catholics. I certainly agree that they should not go into Catholic neighborhoods, which they sometimes seem to do it only to create trouble, however more neutral areas like shopping streets etc are fine in my opinion. If you ignore the Belfast parades (which I'm certainly not a fan of) and focus more on the country parades there is certainly a lot less hostility and a more warm and welcoming atmosphere, and certainly no focus on or even mention of 'killing Irish Catholics'."

What about all the parades that are not through subjugated communities?  Are they still only about 'showing dominance'?  Also, through the parades commission, there's plenty they can do about it."
Documentaries,3diszw,River562,3,Thu Jul 16 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"How long has the parades commission existed for?  Nowhere near as long as the marches have been occurring.  They've existed at least since the early 1800's and during the next 200 years the people that didn't want them to march through their communities had 0 political power to stop them.  Even the British government banned the Orange Order because of the horrific sectarian violence they engaged in.  That violence was not limited to marching season either.  When the government, which the Orange Order wholeheartedly supported, bans your organisation because of the violence and murder carried out, you've got problems.  Then to go marching through the communities of the same people, singing songs celebrating the violence perpetrated against them is not celebrating anything, it's to put fear into people.  The Orange Order still wants to go through nationalist areas singing songs about the violence perpetrated against that same community and the violence continues to this day.  The ""celebrations"" include burning effigies and the flag of the Republic, rioting against police stopping them from marching through areas the parades commission have told them they can't go and general thuggery.  Here's a video of one of the ""celebrations of culture"" this year:  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/orange-order-parades-24-officers-and-teenage-girl-injured-1.2284331  Everyone was obviously having great craic when they had to tip a car over on its' side when it mounted the pavement and ran over a 16 year old girl.

Documentaries,3diex7,Itsalongwaydown,12,Thu Jul 16 15:01:22 2015 UTC,That was hard to watch. RIP. A true inspiration.
Documentaries,3diex7,NcHawk17,6,Thu Jul 16 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"Her video and message to everyone last night at the Espy's brought me to tears. Lauren was truly an inspiration to everyone. Regardless of how bad her situation was, you still saw her smiling and pushing forward to her dream of playing college basketball. Her mothers speech was spot on about how people need to be thankful for the life they were given and do something everyday to make the world a better place and to defeat cancer together. Go glad they honored her."
Documentaries,3diex7,MedTainer,5,Thu Jul 16 19:13:22 2015 UTC,to have even one ounce of her bravery. wow. I can't imagine being that courageous if I was that sick. What an amazing soul the world lost.

But this girl was TERMINALLY ill and still pursuing her dreams, that is REAL courage and she deserved that award. ESPN made a huge mistake in my opinion.  EDIT: was*"
Documentaries,3diex7,HolyShnikesAHooker,11,Thu Jul 16 17:42:12 2015 UTC,Lauren Hill lost her battle to cancer April 10th of this year.  She should have received the Arthur Ashe award.
Documentaries,3diex7,nightreap3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:06 2015 UTC,Oh no! When I was living in OH she was on the local news almost every day. That's sad.
Documentaries,3diex7,paregoric_kid,-7,Thu Jul 16 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"I love the idea people have that the Arthur Ashe award somehow means something? How brainwashed do you have to be to see that it's nothing more than a publicity stunt to bring ESPN television ratings during an era in which the TV is becoming an anachronistic medium for programming?  I personally think that Caitlyn Jenner is a true inspiration. I think that the courage it takes to undertake an existential struggle like a conflicted gender identity is something that defies fear in the way that light shines through darkness. If only we could all have the courage it takes too look within ourselves and defy our fear to become the best person we can be. Isn't that what Lauren did? She didn't fear death, she fought against it with all her might. Caitlyn did something in that same vane and it shouldn't be under appreciated because she didn't die. There are Transgender people who kill themselves because she can't overcome the stigmas that society thrusts onto them. Caitlyn Jenner's inspiration could very much serve to save lives. If more people achieved their self realization with that impact in mind we may have had what it takes to cure illnesses like brain cancer by now. Instead, industrial society (including ESPN) puts profits about people to the point where its effects undermine people's health. Perhaps brain cancer wouldn't be so prevalent in a society that encompasses people who exhibit courage in the face of fear like both these people did. Not to detract from Lauren Hill's example one bit. Apples and oranges. Both are remarkably admirable.  But the idea that the strength of the indomitable spirit of this beautiful soul can be genuinely represented by an award designed with the motive of capital accumulation -- something that has exploited insulted the cherished the sanctity of life itself -- is an insult to her memory more than it is a celebration of it.  If you want to honor her spirit than learn from it. Experience her story and take its resonance into account when it comes to how you live. If we all can appreciate life the way she did than we too can make the most of ourselves and each other so we can all suffer less."
Documentaries,3diex7,victoriamproletarii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"I can relate to Lauren much more than Caitlyn.  What that award means is getting your name out there.  If you ask a group of people if they know who Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner is, they will probably know.  What about Lauren Hill?  Not nearly as many.    What's the benefit of having Lauren's story out there?  It might give other people who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness the courage to fight back and live life.    I've been diagnosided with cancer before.  Lauren's story is much more motivational than Caitlyn is to me.  If she wasn't from my area, I doubt i would have heard about her.  Caitlyn Jenner though, i heard about that for weeks through facebook.  That's why I think she should have gotten the award."
Documentaries,3diex7,nightreap3r,-3,Thu Jul 16 23:46:52 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, existence compasses a lot more than how you can relate to something. You can't relate facing your fears toward the pursuit of a genuine sense of individuality? Why even live than?  Like I said dude, the ESPYS is an award show. It's not a real fucking achievement to win an award that a bunch of people like Brit McHenry can sit on their asses and feel like they matter.  I understand the way you think, but I don't understand why you place any value in an award publicized by a corporation whose economic model is the same that has led to cancer being so prevalent in society."
Documentaries,3diex7,victoriamproletarii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:49:46 2015 UTC,"If you don't understand the reason I place value on the award, then you don't understand the way I think about it at all."
Documentaries,3diex7,nightreap3r,-4,Thu Jul 16 23:51:13 2015 UTC,I just don't see how winning an award could give any more dignity to her memory.

Documentaries,3diex7,parmesan22,9,Thu Jul 16 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"You are the reason she is courageous. I dont want to compare Jenner to hill because that gets us nowhere, but people like you who lack understanding and bully those who are different are the reason why transgender kids commit suicide at such a high rate. Jenner is one of the only visible transgender women I know of. That's why."

Documentaries,3diex7,SMOKIN-ON-BIEBERS,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the point you are trying to make. Yes,  ideally nobody would care about how somebody identifies because we will have moved past judging people for it as a society. However, we are obviously not there yet. Thus, having people who are famous be open about the position they are in when a large portion of the American public is relatively ignorant about their struggle is important."
Documentaries,3diex7,Dgjvdatujh,-2,Thu Jul 16 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"No their struggle isn't really important to me because I don't care, nobody in my life has issues with it, go get married I don't care.  It's absolutely not on my radar. Jenner isn't courageous at all."

In a world so large, I'd imagine there are even young athletes who are dealt shitty hands and push forward. It's ridiculous to stack up every person you think has shown courage and point at a specific award and say that they deserve it. It doesn't add anything to the conversation. It's just critical of a small group of people who made a decision to give out an award."
Documentaries,3diex7,0NTH3SLY,3,Thu Jul 16 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"But, if you watched the video you would see it was bigger than just getting dealt a shitty hand. Her final journey was well documented, in part, to ""be the face"" for pediatric brain cancer, which was stated to be underfunded."

Documentaries,3diex7,jncc,-2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:04 2015 UTC,What is sad is that ESPN had a chance to tell Laurens story and help raise money for cancer research. But instead they wanted to boost their ratings and be edgy. Way to go ESPN. I hope screwing over a girl that died before she was even 19 was worth those extra viewers.
Documentaries,3diex7,Pata_gucci,7,Thu Jul 16 16:25:41 2015 UTC,If it wasn't for ESPN the majority of people wouldn't know her story. ESPN also ran a tribute to her during the ESPYs.
Documentaries,3diex7,bovilexia,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:02:49 2015 UTC,Ya but they could have awarded her the award and hopefully created even more awareness for brain cancer research.

Documentaries,3diex7,bovilexia,2,Thu Jul 16 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"Well I kind of thought that if she was given the award instead of Caitlyn that would cause some controversy.  So for short while a the media, CBS, NBC, CNN, FOX would all be going nuts about if that was fair or right. That way even people that lived under a rock would know about Lauryn Hill and her efforts to raise money. That was my orignal thought which I should have explained in an earlier comment.

Documentaries,3diex7,BaltimoreBirdGuy,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:06 2015 UTC,You're acting like giving her the award would make people less aware?   Let's just say brain cancer is the bigger issue here.

Documentaries,3diex7,RAPIST_WITH_AIDS,-12,Thu Jul 16 19:24:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, everyone who is saying this girl should have won the Arthur Ashe award can shut up.  Sorry to put that so bluntly, but you need to hear it.  People who are terminally ill are a different kind of brave.  They are courageous in that they know they will meet death soon and must accept beforehand that they'll have to shake his hand and admit defeat.  They are called strong just for doing what they want to, which is somewhat correct, but it's mostly just another way of distraction and living your life to the fullest. (Source: my mother was terminally ill for 3 years and we never knew when she would go.  She had written a draft of a book about her experiences with all her emotions.)  Caitlyn Jenner, however, is another kind of brave.  Caitlyn has to now live the rest of her life in knowing some people will abhor her.  She has to go every day knowing what people say about her both to her face and behind her back.  Caitlyn has to wake up each and every day for the rest of her life understanding that people hate her just for being who she is.  No one hated Lauren Hill.  No one criticized her.  No one told her how ugly she was because of who she was.  Almost half of the entire world didn't stop and turn on its heel just to let her know she is wrong because of a single choice she made.  Lauren Hill died a hero just for doing what she loved and fighting through her pain.  Lauren Hill is an undisputed warrior, whereas Caitlyn is either despised or congratulated.  It's extremely hard to compare these two wonderful, strong, and courageous people, but I personally feel that ESPN made a strong decision, although undoubtedly difficult."
Documentaries,3diex7,PrettyLilHodor,5,Thu Jul 16 22:08:38 2015 UTC,"ESPN made a political decision. nothing more. They have shown their allegiances with their coverage of michael sams, and now this.   They take every opportunity they get to advance ""progressive"" causes"
Documentaries,3diex7,PilGrumm,-6,Thu Jul 16 23:45:16 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't follow a lot of sports and ESPN isn't a channel I'm too familiar with.  I can understand how it may seem this is a politically motivated move to gain favor with certain cliques, especially if they've a history of it.  I still stand by my original opinion in saying I feel they made a strong decision.  If it weren't for Caitlyn Jenner, Lauren Hill definitely would have taken the award, hands down.  She was a warrior."

The reason I even called it a murder in the first place is tentative, as I'm already judging Jenner to be at fault which isn't right of me to do.  I'm not implying Jenner is courageous, I'm stating it as fact.  People hate on Jenner for various reasons, but the one most talked about is her recent sex change.

Not even the police have made a final decision yet.  I'm not one who follows celebrities or idolizes them, so sometimes I can be ignorant of the special treatment they receive by the people who glorify them simply because the practice is so alien to me, I will say that, though.  I don't believe I have outright said Jenner ""deserves an award.""  I have stated ESPN's decision as ""strong"" and I have said Jenner is ""courageous.""

Documentaries,3dhrpo,rangifer2014,3,Thu Jul 16 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"What are some things you can do in your day to day life to help songbirds locally and around the world?   Reduce your consumption of material things and have a single child, if any. If you can come to terms with the fact that people living a Western-type lifestyle use many times more resources than others and yet are less happy overall, you might be open to the idea that we could do without a lot of the material things we are told we need. Less resource use equals less pressure on habitat, which is #1 in importance to migratory birds. You can also drink bird-friendly coffee (easily found through Google), get into birdwatching yourself which is cheap and able to be done anywhere in the world and increases your awareness of birds in general.   What degree did you do and how did you go about specialising in your field?   Wildlife & Fisheries Biology. I spent a summer as a volunteer on a government fish study and after that was able to get paid work with similar agencies in all kinds of beautiful wild places around the world. Get to know your professors and local wildlife professionals and you can easily get more experience than 99% of your peers.   What do you think people with house cats should do to minimise the wildlife they kill?   Keep the damn things indoors or put a bell on their collar if they're going outside. Two very simple and effective things.   Tell me some things you love about songbirds.   The cues they use to migrate are still only partially understood - some celestial navigation, use of the Earth's magnetic field, etc - it's incredible and I'm glad that it remains somewhat of a mystery. I love bird song and being able to identify birds by just hearing the snippet of a song or a call. I also love getting into the finer points of visual ID. Mainly I just love that they are this free form of entertainment everywhere you go - something to pay attention to, something to challenge you, and something to share with people who share the interest.   I'd like to mention a few weeks ago the river authority at my aunt's place had a riverbank cut back without thinking about the two kingfisher nests in the area - reported to RSPB, hopefully whoever is responsible will be prosecuted.

Documentaries,3dfvni,End_of_This,2,Thu Jul 16 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I've always seen it (at least in the Chinese sense) in a better light.  Case in point is my girlfriend's cousin.  His father was a general in the PLA and later owned a sizable construction company so never had enough time to bond with his son.  His son was very timid and would spend all of his parents money in internet cafes playing WoW and LoL all day.  his dad has four brothers and three sisters and soon the whole family (and a lot of the more well to do people in their city) knew that general Chen's son was only a shadow of his father.    I heard the story that after my girlfriend's cousin failed the gaokao (college entrance exams) papa Chen went to the internet cafe where his son would always go and took him out of it, drove him to the local army recruiting center and told him ""if you aren't going to go to college you're going to be a soldier.""    He may have only done so so he wouldn't be humiliated (though he probably does genuinely care for his son) by his peers but at least that was more proactive then what many of the Japanese families are doing.  The majority of my friends are Chinese and I could never see their parents or families let them stay in their room for years on end.  It seems like all my girlfriend's aunties and mom can do when they see each other is gossip about each other's children and knowing her mom and aunties the children would be beaten up if they stayed at home.  Just my two cents, I've always found the Chinese to be more proactive with children.  Is your family Chinese?  And if so where in China are they from?"
Documentaries,3dfvni,komnenos,2,Thu Jul 16 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I've always seen it (at least in the Chinese sense) in a better light.   In some ways, it is possible to see it in a positive light. A desire for the child to succeed. Taking an active interest in the child's success. These things, in and of itself, are great.  I grew up Chinese and around asian kids (went to elementary school in Chinatown NYC so Chinese kids, then junior high in Douglaston so Korean kids). Take an interest in your kids, that's good parenting. But from the old generation asian parenting, the pressure placed on the kids both from immigrant families here and what I know in the old country is absolutely immense (as indicated by the high suicide rate amongst teenagers in asian countries). What's worse is that, in my experience, it's only ever partially about being interested in the kid succeeding. Not every asian kid wants to be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer but somehow every asian kid ""wants"" to be one says the parent because everything and anything less is shameful.  The asian father meme is relatable to asian kids because while our white friends try to make it as exaggerated as possible, the asian kids just go, ""Well yea, that was my childhood.""   Is your family Chinese? And if so where in China are they from?   My dad's family is Chinese. My mom's is Burmese. I have no idea where in China my dad's family is from because no one from my dad's family has ever given me the same answer as to what the family's history is (and dad's version sounds like he watched a random Chinese folklore movie and picked that as the family history, not even jk) and both grandparents have passed."
Documentaries,3dfvni,rainzer,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"Haha well now I'm interested about your dad's family's history, any ideas why none of your relatives (and heck even your dad) can't give you a straight answer?  What dialect did they grow up speaking?  And what year did they come over to the US (depending on the year it could indicate if they were Cantonese or not Cantonese)?  Since you're from NYC I'm inclined to think Fuzhou but I might be wrong.  Sorry if I'm being too intrusive, I just find it interesting how no one in your family can give you a straight answer.  Thanks again for the comment!"
Documentaries,3dfvni,komnenos,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"any ideas why none of your relatives (and heck even your dad) can't give you a straight answer?   I honestly don't know. My dad's family mostly hates each other over some strange money issue that happened during their immigration here. They only kept civil until grandma and my eldest aunt passed away. After that, the only people from my dad's family who talk to each other are the kids (us cousins) and the two youngest brothers (my dad and 3rd uncle). No one knows what happened with this because obviously, each uncle will tell his own side of the story. Dad's claim is that the two eldest brothers screwed grandpa/grandma out of their savings to open a factory and offered him and 3rd uncle some minimum wage job in the garment factory so dad joined the army instead. Is this true? Who knows? But how do you ask anyone tactfully, ""Did you/your dad screw grandma?""  The only one that gave me a seemingly believable partial story of anything about my great grandfather was my 3rd uncle and all he could tell me was that my g.grandfather fought in the Sun Yat Sen revolution. After that, I have no idea how my father's family ended up in Burma. It's this issue that makes it difficult to tell what part of China my dad's family is from because my dad's family also immigrated from Burma.   What dialect did they grow up speaking?   We grew up speaking Toisonese. My dad grew up speaking both Toisonese and Burmese since my grandma spoke Toison and my dad was living/born in Burma. I want to say they came in circa 79."
Documentaries,3dfvni,rainzer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:11 2015 UTC,"After that, I have no idea how my father's family ended up in Burma.   During WWII a lot of the Republic's army was sent to Burma to fight the Japanese with the Brits, Indians and Americans (and Aussies/Kiwis too I think).  After the war ended the army ended up staying in a small section of Burma and set up a base.  As the civil war raged in China many fled to Burma (especially when huge portions of the ROC military was stuck in Yunnan, unlike the ROC forces on the coast they had nowhere to flee to besides Burma).  Years after there was a ceasefire the ROC evacuated a lot of the forces and refugees to Taiwan but many had grown attached and stayed in the region.   Since you said your great grandfather fought in the revolution of 1911 I wouldn't be surprised if your grandfather was a soldier or a bureaucrat of some sort at the time (or at the very least supported the ROC).  From what little I gathered I'd say that your family probably is from Guangdong since they spoke Toisan and many of Sun Yat Sen's forces were from Guangdong.  That really is too bad that your family is so broken up, I hope that somehow you and your cousins can get your uncles and aunties back together or at the very least try to find out about your family history (I'm one of those guys who thinks its important to know about family history), especially how with the Chinese most names and genealogies were burned during the cultural revolution so the only way you can learn about the family is through interviewing family members.

Once the routine sets in there's a gnawing sensation in the back of your mind that reminds you of what you should be doing with all that time instead of sitting in one room all day, living in a virtual world just to pass the time. It eventually becomes anxiety about what you'll even do when you leave your safe little room, will you be able to resume life as a productive member of society? It's like falling down a hole and being terrified of the ladder that's right in front of you.   Yes the parents are enabling them but there's only so much you can do with a person who doesn't want to try, whatever their reasons may be. These parents see their children unable to even cope with the most mundane of activities, how can they live with themselves if they just kicked their kids out of the one place they feel safe?"

Documentaries,3dfvni,Chocklatesoop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:33:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. But there is something sad about the fact that the enabling is done, not out of some filial duty, but because of embarrassment.

I had a friend who just eventually never left his room, and literally ended up like one of these guys in the doc (I wonder if I should pay a visit and see...). Why would young people want to study extremely hard, move away from family and friends to get a job (industries have recently moved from where the general population is in the west to specific regional centres), then work super hard at that job for little reward (in real terms, compared to recent history) to pay for the damage the previous generations did to the economy? They won't if they know that's what's happening. Infact, statistically young men in the UK are falling behind in career prospects, hell, why would a young person want to contribute to the Greek economy for example? They will leave or not contribute, though maybe I am unaware of a strong youth patriotism of some kind. It should become extremely statistically noticable if in 2002 Japan had over a million of these guys (maybe check some figures on Japan leading up to ~2002 and compare to see if that pattern is visible in other countries)."

It's common knowledge that many people dick around at their jobs, just to fill in the hours and look ""productive."" Also, as AI get better, they should take many, many jobs. So, antiwork proposes that work be extremely reduced, or even done away with entirely (in the traditional sense), replaced but what amounts to machine funded communism.   On the other hand, just go read a dystopian fiction for a different view of the future. Or watch black mirror. The contrast between the two (anti work and dystopia) is huge. I think anti work will eventually become practical, but it will have to involve the rich and powerful willingly giving up a system that they've worked hard to be at the top of, and benefit immensely from."

But I don't know, simply my point of view is that nothing like this is happening in Europe. I don't see people in Germany or France locking themselves up. Rather, what I do see is trying to find better work x life balance, meaning that a lot of people may try to start their own businesses, work 70h a week so that in 3-5 years, they might work 10h a week.   Anyway, I don't think this (meaning people just shutting off society) is an issue (of course it is, since there's the documentary, but not economically significant that is) in neither contemporary Japan nor the rest of the world.

They're just choosing isolation because they can.  I see how many people would interpret it as laziness. But when I was depressed, given the opportunity I would have cut myself off from the world entirely. Add the pressure of an extreme homogenous culture, lack of fulfilling careers,  strict gender roles, being ostracized for any faux pas well why not?"

Documentaries,3dfvni,Tedbundyishawt,5,Thu Jul 16 14:52:41 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one here who is actually thoroughly disgusted by this? Not because of the teens chossing this path, mind you. I have all the sympathies in the world for these kids. I suffer from social anxiety myself, and it's just pure hell. My parents, however, have suported me from the get-go, as they always have. They've supported me by being  invested in my health and well-being, and by encouraging me to face my challenges and find solutions. I had a period in my life when taking the bus was impossible. My parents had no problem letting me stay at home, figuring things out. That's what any loving parent would do as far as I'm concerned. At least if they're mentally functional people with the capacity for love and understanding. They understood the extreme preassure I felt from society and other people. Of course, they knew that just letting me stay in my room wouldn't solve things. So they helped push my boundaries until I was able to find a psychologist and psychiatrist so I could start making some real progress. I'm not there yet, but I'm getting there.  During these last 10 years, I've learned so much about myself, and most notably I've learned what true self-esteem and self-respect really means. I suppose in its simpliest form it means knowing that you do not have to give a flying fuck about what anyone thinks about you, if that's what you feel is the right thing to do (I assume you're all caring and empathetic people though, so this is naturally not a scapegoat fot being a self-centered asshole). As such, given my disposition with my social anxiety and the chronic depression that followed, I've found a new form of disdain towards anything that encourages stigmatizing of mental problems. And boy do these Asian cultures do that. Everything that I've read about them just reinforces my notion that they are dogshit places to live. The cultural structuring there are poison to everything that enforces empathy and understanding towards other peoples troubles. They are after all, as someone else here put it, ""face cultures"", meaning that these people value how they seem to others more than anything. So much, in fact, that if your kid hasn't been doing as well academically as your cousin, and your parents find this shameful at some fucking relative-get-together, then they will beat you for not being as well academically achieving as your cousin. And these people in these regions of the world find this to be completely acceptable. Healthy, even. Healthy for your own personal development.  Anything that shows a percieved ""weakness"" is frowned upon. It's better for them to let their kids lock themselves up than admitting that they're not feeling well. What the actual fuck? We have problems with the stigmatization of mental problems here in the west too, but nothing near this level. It's not necessarily even about mental problems. It's about conforming to the norm to the fucking extreme. You don't question. You do what you're told. There is zero space for you to sit back and think about what YOU want. As a person. As a human being.  It's disgusting beyond words. I bet ""high expectation asian father"" is very proud though. ""Famiry honor above all!"", I suppose. I couldn't even begin imagining how anyone could ever want to live in these melancholic parts of the world."

They're obviously all incredibly polite people who hadn't been prepared for their sons to become recluse. From what I could discern, Japan's society and culture are so focused on grades that there's no room for failure, and no room for burn-outs.  It's sad, and it's a real mental illness, but I can't help but want to walk into those kids' rooms, rip open the curtains and drag the kids  out to talk and explain themselves whether they like it or not.

The Japanese have a serious insecurity and it manifests itself in paralysis, even when they well-being of their own children are involved.   The Japanese are so conditioned to be followers that: they stick around work so they aren't the first to leave, they won't say anything on trains even when being groped out of worry of making a scene (leading to women-only cars), or as we see here, not take any steps to help their kids out of fear of the neighbors finding out.

Documentaries,3dfvni,the_nin_collector,13,Thu Jul 16 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"It was here that his most famous experiment, the mouse universe, was created.[1] In July 1968 four pairs of mice were introduced into the Utopian universe. The universe was a 9-foot (2.7 m) square metal pen with 54-inch-high (1.4 m) sides. Each side had four groups of four vertical, wire mesh “tunnels.” The “tunnels” gave access to nesting boxes, food hoppers, and water dispensers. There was no shortage of food or water or nesting material. There were no predators. The only adversity was the limit on space. John Calhoun meeting Pope Paul VI on 27 September 1973.  Initially the population grew rapidly, doubling every 55 days. The population reached 620 by day 315, after which the population growth dropped markedly. The last surviving birth was on day 600. This period between day 315 and day 600 saw a breakdown in social structure and in normal social behavior. Among the aberrations in behavior were the following: expulsion of young before weaning was complete, wounding of young, inability of dominant males to maintain the defense of their territory and females, aggressive behavior of females, passivity of non-dominant males with increased attacks on each other which were not defended against. After day 600, the social breakdown continued and the population declined toward extinction. During this period females ceased to reproduce. Their male counterparts withdrew completely, never engaging in courtship or fighting. They ate, drank, slept, and groomed themselves – all solitary pursuits. Sleek, healthy coats and an absence of scars characterized these males. They were dubbed “the beautiful ones.” Breeding never resumed and behavior patterns were permanently changed.  The conclusions drawn from this experiment were that when all available space is taken and all social roles filled, competition and the stresses experienced by the individuals will result in a total breakdown in complex social behaviors, ultimately resulting in the demise of the population.  Calhoun saw the fate of the population of mice as a metaphor for the potential fate of man. He characterized the social breakdown as a “second death,” with reference to the “second death” mentioned in the Biblical book of Revelation 2:11.[1] His study has been cited by writers such as Bill Perkins as a warning of the dangers of the living in an ""increasingly crowded and impersonal world.""[2]   Maybe we aren't all that different from the mice."

It blew my mind that many of the British soldiers that were defeated there, were also present a few months later at the Battle of Waterloo.   Contrary to the song, the American irregulars did not hide in the bushes and wait until they saw ""the whites of their eyes"". They prepared a battlefield, drew the British into a quagmire of mud, and picked them off from behind a protective berm. Some of the British troops were so disciplined that when their officers deserted them, they simply stood in ranks while the Americans picked them off. Bravery has its rational limits."

Documentaries,3df10r,Ze_Carioca,2,Thu Jul 16 15:30:16 2015 UTC,You are looking at it wrong. First they still impressed sailors after the war they judt cut back on it greatly. The reason for this was not the war of 1812 but because the war with france was over. The royal navy needed sailors and some were deserting in america so they re-impressed them along with American citizens. When the war ended there was no need for this practice. England never agreed to stop. America went to war to accomplish things and didn't accomplish them through the war. America did get what it wanted hut again not due to the war.   To be fair it wasn't some huge defeat for America but america didn't win. At the very best it was a draw and this is a stretch to call it that. It was more of A small war that england Fought . To preserve the status quo which it won and america lost but didn't face any consequences I'm defeat.   Given  america won a huge battle after the war was over they had pride in the conflict. Still winning a battle still means they failed in their objectives.

Documentaries,3df10r,Ba-Ba-B00ey,9,Thu Jul 16 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"Well the war was not only about the Americans attempt at annexing part of Canada. At the time england was blockading American-European trade routes. They were also supplying and helping the Native Americans to prevent further westward expansion. These were very contentious issues that helped trigger the war.  The treaty of Ghent gave fairly equal concessions to both the Americans and British. The States promised to leave the Canadian provinces alone, and the British stopped blocking trade routes and promised not to interfere with the inevitable westward expansion in the Americas  Edit- The Americans also burned down what is now Toronto"

Because the US never lost any major battles and because Thailand, Malaysia and all of southeast Asia did not turn communist -- we really won. Complete victory was simply due to US politicians forcing the military to ""fight with one hand behind its back"" and the mass media/journalists undermining morale on the US home front.

Documentaries,3de1ee,Harionago,18,Wed Jul 15 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"The Wii U is sort of a cult hit, but its sales are poor. I believe Iwata even flat out admitted that it was a financial failure before he died. They have also said that they are committed to satisfying the people who have bought the Wii U, so they are not flat out abandoning it yet. Although it's known that they are working on a future project code named 'NX' which fans speculate is their next home console. It will not likely even be announced until next year though.  They also caved recently and have partnered with another company to get into making mobile games. Iwata did not want to do this initially as was indicated in this doc, but the company eventually decided to get into that market while simultaneously stressing that they will always be committed to the console market.   All that being said, it is actually a shame that the Wii U has not sold well. It's a combination of bad marketing, the price point being a little too high, and their age old problem of lacking third party support. But I own one and there are easily 10-20 extremely good games that make it worth buying. The gamepad may not be utilized in enough titles, but it doesn't detract from your experience either and in some cases it adds an awesome element to a game. And the backwards compatibility with the Wii makes it a nice upgrade for the millions of people who bought one and can still use their old controllers and games.   Between Mariokart, Super Smash Bros, Super Mario 3D World, Splatoon, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, Pikmin 3, Hyrule Warriors, Winder Waker HD (if you never played the original I guess), Rayman Legends, Zombi U, the NEX Remix games and upcoming titles like Yoshi's Wooly World, Mario Maker (which I think has AMAZING potential), Star Fox, Xenoblade Chronicles and a new Zelda game....there's something for everyone on this console that will give you many, many hours of enjoyment."
Documentaries,3de1ee,Jalien85,5,Wed Jul 15 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with everything you said. I'm a big gamer, but I don't have any Xbox or Sony consoles. I have a Wii U and a PC.

My kids and I play together all the time and the games that are too hard for them to play, I legitly enjoy playing for them while they watch.  Of the titles we own, our favorites are Nintendoland, Super Mario Bros. U, Super Mario 3D World, Pikmin 3, Windwaker HD (anxiously awaiting Legend of Zelda), Mariokart 8, Super Smash Bros, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, and the newest addition, Splatoon (which is really entertaining to play and extremely frustrating to watch my kids play). Wii Party U is also good, but doesn't get played as much and Mario Party 10 was kind of a let down compared to previous games in the franchise.  Our family also uses the Wii U to watch Netflix in the living room.  Aside from that, I game (and do everything else) on my PC.  I wish more people knew just how fun and versatile the Wii U really is. Seems like everyone my age (almost 30) has already given up on Nintendo due to their reputation for serving the younger demographic and it's sad."
Documentaries,3de1ee,j0nnyb4n4n45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:31:30 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I'm around 30 and I'm kind of reverting to my Nintendo roots. Especially now that I'm more domesticated and live with my gf the Wii U is the ideal system to have for games we can play together. I no longer care about 'edgy' or 'gritty' games like GTA - I don't care if it's cutesy or aimed at kids - if it's fun and challenging and the controls don't make me want to smash the console, I like it. And Nintendo always finds that perfect balance - games that are easy enough for children to enjoy, but if you want to fully complete them they are maddeningly challenging."
Documentaries,3de1ee,Jalien85,2,Thu Jul 16 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"You have to admit that having only 10 - 20 good games for the console that has been out for nearly 4 years is a little lack luster.    For me personally Nintendo's downfall has been it's exclusive characters/franchises and it's absolute refusal to move forward from them. Unless you are deeply nostalgic for these characters, it's hard to get excited about yet another Mario game.  If I look forward to the future for Sony and Microsoft I get a little excited because I truly do not know what kind of revelations and boundaries they will be pushing. It's always exciting to see what new content is around the corner and watching the technology flourish year by year. If I was to think of the same future for Nintendo I just see the same recycled stuff. More Mario, more Zelda, more Donkey Kong, more Pokemon, different controls. As a consumer I can't get excited about Nintendos future when I know exactly what it is."
Documentaries,3de1ee,Harionago,2,Thu Jul 16 09:39:58 2015 UTC,"No, I kind of don't agree with a single thing you've said. I prioritize quality over quantity, and actual FUN over 'new content'. I will keep playing games like Mariokart over and over, basically until the next one comes out and I never get sick of it. I've gotten away from Nintendo for periods of time and played games for the Xbox and PC instead - honestly, half of the big titles I try I get tired of half way through and don't even bother finishing them. I eventually realized that I was just going through the motions and not actually having FUN. Every time I come back to Nintendo, I remember what it was about gaming that I actually liked. Simple and flawless gameplay mechanics that get progressively more challenging.   Also, just because they're using the same characters over and over does not necessarily mean they're making the same game over and over. If you think the Mario platformers have not evolved significantly from generation to generation then you must have just quit playing them and assumed they were all the same. Nintendo is not afraid of trying new things. Yes there's some repetition in the NSMB series, but if you look at where they've gone from Mario 64 to Mario Sunshine to Mario Galaxy to Mario 3D World - they like to shake things up.  And as for excitement for the future - I think you've got a pretty short memory if you're counting Nintendo out. Look at what a drastic move it was for them to go from the GameCube to the Wii. That was a huge innovation (and risk) that changed the gaming environment. I see Nintendo as the company that wants to pave their own way and be different. Xbox and Playstation are just trying to compete to have the most powerful hardware to host the newest AAA titles with insane graphics and average gameplay.   I personally find it hard to get excited about the next COD or Assassin's Creed games, or whatever other titles that are just extensions of the same old ""generic fantasy or sci-fi open world - go find repetitive quests and cash them in"" trope."

SNES was an absolute powerhouse; NES embarrassed atari consoles; N64 had much more processing power than the PS1; the Gamecube has great polycount pushing capabilities.   the one caveat is the gameboy, which was made on pure cheap (and magic) but portables are totally different from home consoles."

Sony was one of the first to try it out dating back to the PS2. They even released an upgraded model for the PS3 called the PSEye shortly after the PS3's release. The PS3 also launched with 6-axis motion controls which were more accurate than the Wii's controller.  Lastly Sony didn't copy the Wii U's second-display functionality. Sony again had that since the PSP with remote play..  These guys need to get their facts straight before saying one company copied another. IF anyone copied, Nintendo copied Sony's ideas and improved them, not the other way around. More likely both companies came up with the similar concepts at the same time.  Before anyone says I am a ""fanboi"" - I am sitting next to my 2DS and Wii U (The only consoles I own). I am just calling out Bias when I see it."

Documentaries,3ddyi4,EasternEuropeSlave,18,Wed Jul 15 16:32:15 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_background_of_the_New_Testament  TL:DR The only remarkable part about Jesus, as opposed to Honi the Circledrawer, Hanina ben Dosa, Theudas, Fadus, etc. was that after the second temple was destroyed in 70CE his Jewish sect (which were common at the time) didn't fade away.  There's nothing unusual about Jesus for the time period he lived in (Judea under Roman occupation). Nobody at the time paid much attention because there were a host of  self proclaimed Jewish prophets floating around gathering small groups of followers, and the Romans were playing whack-a-mole as they popped up."
Documentaries,3ddyi4,RZZRGRRL,0,Wed Jul 15 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"People should read Kooks and Quacks of the Roman Empire: A Look into the World of the Gospels:     We all have read the tales told of Jesus in the Gospels, but few people really have a good idea of their context. Yet it is quite enlightening to examine them against the background of the time and place in which they were written, and my goal here is to help you do just that. There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and loons who would follow and praise them. Placed in this context, the gospels no longer seem to be so remarkable, and this leads us to an important fact: when the Gospels were written, skeptics and informed or critical minds were a small minority. Although the gullible, the credulous, and those ready to believe or exaggerate stories of the supernatural are still abundant today, they were much more common in antiquity, and taken far more seriousl     and     Even in Acts, we get an idea of just how gullible people could be. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (28:6). And Paul and his comrade Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities. For the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (14:8-18). These stories show how ready people were to believe that gods can take on human form and walk among them, and that a simple show was sufficient to convince them that mere men were such divine beings. And this evidence is in the bible itself.     and     Miracles were also a dime a dozen in this era. The biographer Plutarch, a contemporary of Josephus, engages in a lengthy digression to prove that a statue of Tyche did not really speak in the early Republic (Life of Coriolanus 37.3). He claims it must have been a hallucination inspired by the deep religious faith of the onlookers, since there were, he says, too many reliable witnesses to dismiss the story as an invention (38.1-3). He even digresses further to explain why other miracles such as weeping or bleeding--even moaning--statues could be explained as natural phenomena, showing a modest but refreshing degree of skeptical reasoning that would make the Amazing Randi proud. What is notable is not that Plutarch proves himself to have some good sense, but that he felt it was necessary to make such an argument at all. Clearly, such miracles were still reported and believed in his own time. I find this to be a particularly interesting passage, since we have thousands of believers flocking to weeping and bleeding statues even today. Certainly the pagan gods must also exist if they could make their statues weep and bleed as well!     It's a somewhat nice fictional story."

Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, and most biblical scholars and classical historians see the theories of his non-existence as effectively refuted. There is no evidence today that the existence of Jesus was ever denied in antiquity by those who opposed Christianity. Geoffrey Blainey notes that ""a few scholars argue that Jesus... did not even exist,"" and that they ""rightly point out that contemporary references to him were extremely rare."" There is however widespread disagreement among scholars on the details of the life of Jesus mentioned in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings, and the only two events subject to ""almost universal assent"" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate."
Documentaries,3ddyi4,Birddableeder,3,Wed Jul 15 22:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm an atheist and I also don't understand why people have such problems believing Jesus existed.

Documentaries,3ddyi4,inpu,0,Wed Jul 15 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah the founders of Christianity lived between 100-300 A.D. they were allegorical authors much like the authors for other mystery cults at the time. One such source of pagan allegorical writing is ""The Golden Ass"" By Apuleius. Perhaps you should actually read Tacitus ""Annals, book 15"" and Flavius Josephus ""Antiquities of the Jews"" and come to your own conclusion. I am tired of people spouting second hand comments like ""jesus' existence is historical fact."" Well there are the sources but I promise you will be disappointed. People need to understand that the story of jesus did not happen in a historical vacuum, there was a philosophical and moral trend in the Mediterranean at the time that the gospels fit into. A revolutionary preacher who supposedly drew crowds of thousands and performed miracles would have been mentioned by contemporary historians such as Thallus, Seneca the Elder, Nicolaus of Damascus, Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Valerius Maximus, Mucianus, Servilius Nonianus, Marcus Velleius Paterculus, Titus Labienus... the list goes on."
Documentaries,3ddyi4,NGasta-Kvata-Kvakis,0,Wed Jul 15 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"Scholars don't believe he drew crowds of thousands.

Pontius Pilate, the prefect of the region, didn't even warrant any attention.  It makes far more sense, and fits what evidence scholars do have, that Jesus was a historical figure from Nazareth than the idea that a bunch of Jews in the latter part of the 1st century decided to invent a mythical preacher."

Oh and please elaborate on this ""evidence"" that ""scholars"" do have. Commonly people point to the supposed census called by Caesar that drew Jesus' family to Bethlehem, however... this census takes place decades after Luke dates it in his gospel, and people were not required to travel in order to register for taxes, AND as Joseph was a resident of Galilee he would not even be eligible for this census.  It is simply included in the story in order to fulfill the prophecy of the messiah coming from Egypt."

If it was, then virtually all our history of the ancient world would need to be thrown out.  Instead what they do is compare the documents and see what is common among them, figure out what is less likely to be an interpolation.  For example, all of the Gospels have Jesus becoming crucified with a sign reading ""King of the Jews"" over his head.  Scholars believe this to be likely since early Christians did not refer to Jesus as king of the Jews, and when Romans crucified people they would do things like this.  There is much more to it, Google or Youtube could help you in this matter a lot more than I can.   this only further supports my point that they (the gospels) are simply allegorical literature   Because they were written so soon after the death of Jesus (within 40-70 years), the idea they are 100% invented from nothing is unlikely.  First, whoever would have been inventing Christianity wouldn't have needed to bother, since there were money of these kinds of prophets roaming around at the time.  Second, the writers would have been better off picking a time outside living memory (say 100 years earlier instead of 40) since they wouldn't have to worry about elders refuting it.   Commonly people point to the supposed census called by Caesar that drew Jesus' family to Bethlehem   Actually no historians point to this.  It is believed to be an interpolation added to the story to give him a reason to be born in Bethlehem rather than Galilee.  The problem is you are looking at this like a Southern Baptist literalist, that either the New Testament is 100% accurate or 100% false.  Historians and scholars look at it differently.  They see a collection of religious documents, some of which differ wildly, but which contain some commonalities that fit into the likelihood of first century Palestine.  They also look at the likelihood of a cult growing up around a teacher who never existed and doesn't naturally fit the model of a Jewish messiah at all, vs the likelihood of a popular itinerant preacher who was crucified, and his followers refusing to believe he was dead and grafting on various popular ideas to the story.  There is a reason virtually all reputable scholars, atheist or otherwise, are convinced Jesus was a historical figure.  I recommend looking into it more."
Documentaries,3ddyi4,bjh13,3,Wed Jul 15 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'm an atheist and I think he did exist but there were many other people at that time who did the same ""miracles"" as well. I just don't think he was the son of a god.   Stories can be started from one person or idea and spread to many places over time with many things changing from the original story.   Non-Christian sources used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as Josephus, and Roman sources such as Tacitus. The sources are compared to Christian sources such as the Pauline Letters and the Synoptic Gospels, and are usually independent of each other (e.g. Jewish sources do not draw upon Roman sources), and similarities and differences between them are used in the authentication process  Although the sources for the historicity of Jesus are mainly Christian sources, such as the gospels and the purported letters of the apostles. The authenticity and reliability of these sources has been questioned by many scholars, and few events mentioned in the gospels are universally accepted.   There are still many sources that point to a Jesus existing though or at least proof of Christians who followed him and were persecuted.   Thallus (52AD)  Tacitus (56-120AD)  Mara Bar-Serapion (70AD)  Phlegon (80-140AD)  Pliny the Younger (61-113AD)  Suetonius (69-140AD)  Though all of these are based on hearsay accounts not actual people who seen him and then wrote about it. I guess that would be an important note.  Paul's biblical letters (epistles) serve as the oldest surviving Christian texts, written probably around 60 C.E. Most scholars have little reason to doubt that Paul wrote some of them himself. Of the thirteen epistles, bible scholars think he wrote only eight of them, and even here, there occurs interpolations. Not a single instance in any of Paul's writings claims that he ever meets or sees an earthly Jesus, nor does Paul give any reference to Jesus' life on earth (except for a few well known interpolations). Therefore, all accounts about a Jesus could only have come from other believers or his imagination. Hearsay."

Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.a 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.b 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commandsc and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  I'd say that is pretty clear. But then I can see why you would want to distance yourself with the old vengeful God.  No.2 - I am actually Jewish born, my family are Jewish, so no, I can categorically confirm to you that I am not a Jew hater.  No.3 - so I quoted someone else? I fail to see the big issue there, I happen to agree with his statement, it would be deceitful and most of all time consuming to re-write these brilliantly powerful words into my own hand. And after all, you yourself are religious, do you not quote scripture?   No.4 - I have done a lot of research myself, I have read many books on the subject ranging from Dennet, Harris, to Hitchens,   Now your return argument will more than likely be along the lines of ""why not read material from the other side? The theological side."" And I have also. But what it all comes down to is a distinct lack of believe, and no amount of reading will make me believe in your God, I would say it is on par with reading material on the monkey God hanuman i simply would not be able to muster enough belief to be a Hindu.  If you would like to discuss this further I would love to! I actually enjoy theology debates!"

Roman 7:6 - But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.  Galatians 3:13 - Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”  Galatians 5:14 - For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”  1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  Also here is a quick link outlining the book of Hebrews and the change in Covenants- https://www.gci.org/law/sct07  I mentioned the Jews in my previous comment because it looks like you just have a problem with the Old Testament, which Jesus replaces.   No.3 You are correct I do quote scripture and other folks a lot. I just see a lot of ""youtube"" comments copy/paste the same things. But you probably see this a lot on the flip side as well, so moot point.   ALSO, your verse that you put as evidence the Old law still is relevant doesn't quite match up. It is actually more evidence in my favor, as Jesus is talking about Himself fulfilling the old prophesies and establishing a New Covenant."

Documentaries,3dafe0,Winterplatypus,46,Wed Jul 15 09:50:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no loud noises, no colourful graphics, no biased agenda, no forced propaganda, no hidden message, just a decent documentary.

Documentaries,3dafe0,Mu-Pu,10,Tue Jul 14 22:57:49 2015 UTC,"Whilst I would agree that our.. better channels (The beeb and some of the content of C4) tend to put out quite decent documentaries, we also put out a lot of our own sensationalist crap.   Channel 4 itself is a particularly bad offender for this at times. Documentaries that are framed as a heartfelt look at a person with such and such a disability/lifestyle choice etc that are in reality nothing more than a ""look at this weirdo"" style show, C4's recent series called the undatables is a good example of this.   Whilst it does tend to be our trashier terrestrial channels that do this more regularly (I'm looking at you channel 5. though you did start off life as a channel who's principle purpose was to show softcore pornography, something my adolescent self thanks you for). The British public does seem to have a fascination with these veiled freakshows. It's likely why our import of your channel TLC has done so well.   Still as borderline contemptible as these sorts of program's are; they're at least ten thousand times the quality of anything ITV has put out in decades."
Documentaries,3dafe0,itshonestwork,2,Tue Jul 14 22:44:09 2015 UTC,ITV did (or possibly still does) a series called Exposure - kinda like a harder hitting version of C4's Dispatches - which seemed to be decent from the couple of episodes I saw.
Documentaries,3dafe0,monedula,8,Wed Jul 15 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"American ones are unwatchable for me. It's like there's no big picture. The host wants to make the show all about them, and their perfect hair, teeth and documentary voice, and that sweet come-back/one-liner against the guy being interviewed. The editing guys want to make the show all about multiple camera angles, slow motion shots, and black and white B-camera cuts. The music guy wants to make the show all about his sympathy music, with as many crying scenes as possible. And the director seems to want to embellish and exaggerate everything, as if real life isn't interesting or shocking enough. Plus you never know how much of it is just plain set up.  That and you have about 10 minutes of show, 5 minutes of adverts for medicine/a truck you need/the show on next/a preview of the next episode of the documentary you're watching, followed by a 1 minute recap of the 10 minutes you just watched 5 minutes ago, before a new 9 minutes of documentary. Unwatchable and irritating garbage.  The subject should be the focus and star of the show, but it seems like Americans can't even do a news show without making the opinionated geometrically-perfect-hair anchors the stars of it all.  I cannot imagine an American being capable or even allowed to do the kind of show Louis Theroux does. They'd either ham it up, or be asked to ham it up."
Documentaries,3dafe0,ToTheRescues,5,Wed Jul 15 14:15:31 2015 UTC,... followed by a 1 minute recap of the 10 minutes you just watched 5 minutes ago ...   I remember my son complaining about those recaps when he was just ten years old. Apparently a typical American adult has an attention span less than that of a European ten-year-old - or at least American documentary makers think that's the case.
Documentaries,3dafe0,totopops,3,Wed Jul 15 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"There's even a difference in advertisements as well.   I had to stream a hockey game from a British sports channel and I've noticed a difference in the ads. American ads try to be too funny or meta, whereas the British ones are straight forward and to the point. It was refreshing to see the bullshit stripped away for once."
Documentaries,3dafe0,ToTheRescues,2,Wed Jul 15 06:24:02 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I actually love American ads. They're hilariously over the top. Although when they're running every 8 minutes or so I guess they could get old pretty damn quick."
Documentaries,3dafe0,totopops,3,Wed Jul 15 06:57:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose the ones that show during the Super Bowl are pretty funny, but the rest just fall flat in my opinion.  And yes, the amount of ads on American TV is insane. I recently dropped my cable, so in the off chance I do watch television I'll occasionally catch myself becoming confused at the fact that I can't skip the ads."

I got an instant answer from one dude who never took his eyes off the screen, ""imperial wizard"". I looked around, and saw 5 or 6 people nod in confirmation... An imperial wizard is higher than a grand dragon.   Nobody in the room reacted to the question as if it were anything out of the ordinary.

Documentaries,3dc1lu,victoriamproletarii,3,Tue Jul 21 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"Aristotle defined spectacle as a necessary component in an epoch that we associate the construction of democracy; a system that is predicated upon the idea that represented officials will urge the state to move in a direction that follows the will of a great utilitarian idea; a majority. In a sense, a mathematical majority meets a utilitarian measure in doing what is best for the common good.  Yet, why is the common good found to be that of a majority in the first place? Perhaps the majority is, in a purely hypothetical sense for the sake of this criticism; a sordid bunch of fools? Who, under the thumb of the ruling elite are manipulated into believing that a belief that isn't even truly their own. It's not a belief in the sense that it is forged through the existential catalyst of experience. It's more closely akin to delusion that is defined as common because it is belonging to a herd of sheep; followers, you in their masses are in no way following the pursuit of a common good.  After all, the noble lie is defined in Republic as some sort of ethical achievement. As if the men who see from great heights know each stone or grain of sand that makes up the barren earth that the door dwell on or even the Kafkaesue regular life for those are don't seek to usurp the throne but instead just wish to be free of every burden, even the one brought about by undertaking the Atlas like struggle of governance. And while the idea of the noble lie being an act of benevolence is still among us, it would be silly to believe it isn't anachronistic if not antiquated.  So why does it seemingly still drive the will of the masses? In a word: spectacle.  Drama goes to show the existential value of experience. It captivates us so absolutely, even vicariously. And what greater spectacle is there than war? It arouses the pathos of man toward polar opposites in terms of belief, with little gray area. What is war good for? Without question; racketeering but is it good for much more in the anals of history. It has liberated although not as often as it's oppressed. Yet in the moment when history is unfolding instead of folding behind a turning page to have memory's recollection distort its truth we have our only true chance to determine the subjectivity of our present experience.  Calling Iraq a debacle would be an act of generosity. Calling it a crime would be fair. While ISIS is surely a staunchly polarizing and infuriating group, let's not be bound by its spectacle. Let's not be swayed into believing other than that evil is bound together in its eternal darkness. The evil that started this war is no better or worse than the evil that emerges out of it. They are one of the same and their power to tempt the hearts of men will lead his entire kind toward that darkness and in that night being us further away from our common good that lights purity may ever be willing to cut through to bring us to salvation.  Fuck ISIS and anyone who has ever supported them. If that includes our present state, allies and their respective government than so be it; that was not my choice and I doubt it would have been that of a 99% percent majority. I would imagine it surely includes our bourgeoisie, capitalist overlords who as the noble elite who try to tell us that democracy is still rooted in a lie."

Even at that age there is social outcasting and bullying. I remember one girl who was the runt of the litter (there's a class limit of 12), and there were quite a few girls (almost 3 and verbal) that would treat her like a doll becuase she was so passive. One time one of the meaner ones purposely pushed her to the floor, and when she started crying the bully helped her up, and said ""uh oh! Shhh Shhh sh. It's okay. Don't cry."" She gave her a hug, and calmed her down. As soon as the girl was calm, she pushed her to the floor  and did it all over again. Some kids are just innately evil, others weak, and others confident. Interestingly that little girl who was bullied was held back when the others moved on becuase she was so young, and began bullying the new class (who were much smaller than her) in exactly the same way she was treated. Girls are crazyily territorial in preschool; it might have to do with the lack of good toys. Boys have a plethora of blocks, trains, cars, etc. The girl section will have one princess costume out of all the crappy pretend clothes, and max three baby dolls. There might be a few barbies, but usually only one has good clothes. Immediately the girls begin fighting for dominance."

I ended up being ruthlessly teased my first week of preschool because of that and pretty much all of the girls called me ""the boy"". I didn't really care and just kept going on and playing however I wanted but I was a pretty assertive and confident child.

The ways in which they emulate their social normality is crazy, both in play and in their general behaviour and demeanor. They tend to play in extremes, when they play family there's always some terrible story going on at some point. Like the dog gets hit by a car, someone breaks a leg, way over-the-top exaggerations of severe parents/teachers/etc. They try to integrate the craziest things they've heard of into this otherwise very rigid family play. They're trying to figure out what social normality is and it's fucking hilarious at times."

British people use different words than use, and they're often what we would consider more ""classy"" words, so the kids learn that and they just sound smarter, I don't think they are any more iintelligent, North Americans are just a lot more casual.  Like when that little girl said "" I haven't played with anyone in ages"", I was taken a back, because a North American kid would say "" I haven't played with anyone in a while/longtime"". The words ""ages"" in North America is rarely used to describe the passage of a long time, so i think it's the fact they're using words we normally don't use, and that maybe white waspy people would use here."

The kids I work with just don't have the interpersonal skills that I'm seeing in this doc, and I'm wondering why. The kids I work with are very high energy, and they are mostly pretty smart, but these kids here honestly seem light-years ahead of them.

I was the little girl wanting to be everyone's friend, just looking for someone to accept me.

As an adult, I can say I went from a Jessica type personality to the Skyla type.

Documentaries,3dawgf,John_Adamska_Miller,32,Tue Jul 14 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"When I was in college way back in the 80's, Gen. William Westmoreland (former leader of US forces in Vietnam) came and spoke on the US involvement in Vietnam. According to him, the greatest mistake America made wasn't follow France into an unwinnable war against a determined enemy, but giving virtually limitless access to the press. He then stated that were he to be in charge of the military in another large conflict, that would be the one major change he would make. The US government learned from its mistake and heavily restricts the press in the Middle East war zone. That restriction of the press, combined with the lack of a national draft, keeps the American people oblivious to what is happening in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. They are also the reasons we (US) are entering year 14 of a conflict that could very well continue for another 10 years. War? What war?"
Documentaries,3dawgf,myfrigginagates,7,Wed Jul 15 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"I remember that speech. He, of course, was being disengenuous. The real mistake we made (there were two) was trying to fight WWII in Vietnam without an endgame. Our military makes this mistake over and over. Every single fight I have ever been in was fighting the war before it, without clear, concise goals. Roosevelt has been criticised for insisting on inconditional surrender but that is literally what enabled us to beat the everliving shit out of the Japanese and Germans. Otherwise we would have diddled around and tried some crazy negotiation, and they would have come back for another round in twenty five years, like they had just done.   The only way to win war--any war-- is through militarily beating the other side into the dirt so badly that they have no more will to continue on their old path. By refusing to invade North Vietnam, by trying to beat China an Russia in proxy wars, we lost both Vietnam and Korea.  We did the same in Iraq, and in Afghanistan. We beat their army, but didn't make the people suffer so badly that they had no choice but to change their pattern of life, their ideals. Ideals we demand of them as the victors. So the fight goes on. The only way we will win this one is by strangling them until they're blue in the face, and holding our bootheal on them until the next generation no longer thinks of America and the West as the great Satan, and no longer has the urge to murder Jews in Israel, and no longer wants to attack us.  What we are doing now is a waste of lives (ours and theirs) capital (ours) and time. We're running out of time for a clean solution to this. Next go round is going to be ugly. By ugly I mean nuclear/biological/chemical. It may just break us as a nation.  I'm not advocating doing that, mind. I was against this war from the get go.  But once again, we went into this one fighting Desert Storm, hoping that by not setting a standard for Victory that we could dust our hands and walk away. Hubris.  We've let our fear of being seen as the bad guys and stinginess lead us into allowing our news corps to avoid telling us the truth. When the next round comes they won't be able to avoid it."
Documentaries,3dawgf,Beamish_Boy,3,Wed Jul 15 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this just isn't true. Most wars come to a negotiated end. I agree that in regard to WWII unconditional surrender and ""no separate peace"" were the correct decisions but it's just not realistic to project that onto every other conflict.  However, I do agree with you that clear goals are important. If you don't know what you're trying to do, war is probably not the best way forward."

It's to enrich Global banks and businesses and rally the voters under one banner after the Cold War ended.   In those goals endless war and instability is the goal.

Unfortunately we've entered an era when these goals are incompatable with the means of warfare we have produced. Eventually the other guys are going to get nukes and biological weapons and we're really really going to be fucked.  That's why I noted that we're probably not going to survive the next big round. It is not inconceivable that some little group has funded in the long term enough genetic engineers in our western college system. It wouldn't be tough to build an ebola bug we can't beat.   Think of it: A slow acting, quick spreading ebola bug. Maybe with a long incubation and transmission period that hides it as we hug and kiss and fuck each other until a month or so in, we find we're all fucking infected and fucked.   We're definitely reaching the point where bio weapons can be engineered, so  I can't see what's stopping them. If Frank Hebert could write the White plague in 1982, and set it in the 80's, certainly we've reached the point where we can manufacture some real doozies in what amounts to a garage.  Reality has a long history of taking horrific events (like 9/11) that authors envision and some goober makes reality. Eventually we're going to piss someone smart off."

Yet, they have never produced even a bad cold to afflict their Arab neighbors.  Especially notable because they have small population packed into a small space, one that could be easily vaccinated.  2 -- The USSR spent billions and decades on this issue. Such a doomsday weapon could have changed the outcome of the Cold War. Yet they haven't even found a poison that leaves no trace to sophisticated coroners and pathologists.

Documentaries,3dawgf,tierras_ignoradas,6,Sat Jul 18 00:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah... No.  Total war is the best way to quickly win a war, but it is not the way to win the peace. A brutal or apathetic occupation after a war is the fastest way to lose the peace. There is a huge difference between winning the war and winning the PEACE.  We won the peace in Germany and Japan because we rebuilt them. We smashed those countries to bits and then rebuilt them into prosperous nations that became allies and trading partners. People are less inclined to fight when their lives are good and the future looks so bright they have to wear shades. We haven't done that since.   Really think about it from a realpolitk perspective and you realize that we were completely apathetic in our occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. We didn't build schools, or factories, we didn't provide them with jobs and infrastructure. We smashed their governments and economies and then sat behind fences in our F.O.B.s and it bit us in the ass hard. If you remember when we declared those conflicts over there was a lull. The natives were waiting to see what happened next and the first insurgents were foreign fighters funded by terrorists organizations. But things got worse, you topple a government and there will be a power vacuum. If you don't fill it yourself, warlords will be more than happy to come and fight for the scraps.   The landscape would be radically different if we had built roads, schools, hospitals, and kick started their economies with loans and trade deals like we did with Germany and Japan. Why would an Iraqi or Afghani man pick up an AK-47 and fight our forces if his family was healthy and happy with a bright future ahead? Ideological extremism is born out of ignorance and despair. Yet we did none of that. No funds were prepared or planned for reconstruction of these countries. The Bush administration literally had no plans for this. They expected us to be able to go in, kill the guys we were after and simply leave. The people would greet us as liberators and be so grateful they would automatically become honorary Americans and rebuild by themselves.   If we topple a country and send them back to the stone age we are saddled with the responsibility of rebuilding them. Plain and simple, otherwise you leave behind a shattered war-torn state that is prime breeding ground for the next generation of enemies. Which a more cynical person would say was the plan all along.   This talk of strangling them until their blue in the face and holding boots to peoples throats makes you sound naive at best and maliciously ignorant at worst and shows a profound misunderstanding of the regions history.

Media control was mostly happening during the invasions of both countries, for the exact reasons you've mentioned.  Also, the US has no say in who does and who doesn't enter Syria. That's, depending on the location, up the Syrian government and rebel groups."
Documentaries,3dawgf,DdCno1,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:06:34 2015 UTC,"According to him, the greatest mistake America made wasn't follow France into an unwinnable war against a determined enemy, but giving virtually limitless access to the press.   To be fair, a popular war is easier to wage than an unpopular war.  I think it's also a bit disingenuous to suggest the American public is unaware of the events in Iraq or Afghanistan. IIRC there used to be constant updates on the numbers of dead and wounded on the news, but I will admit I haven't seen that information broadcast as frequently as it was during the mid 2000s.  Also, keeping the public unaware of the realities of many situations is a tactic used for far more than war. This is not limited to America either. See: All political platforms for basically every country ever."

Documentaries,3dawgf,QuarterOztoFreedom,7,Tue Jul 14 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"The military today isn't so far from this one in many ways. The big difference, really, I think, is that the grunts today have all volunteered. Back in the day the only volunteers were by and large lifers, and they took care of each other, and fucked the grunts. This documentary only briefly goes into the class divide, and the benefits of being a lifer vs being a grunt. The good old boy network did an awful ot towards extending the chances that a lifer would survive a tour as opposed to a draftee grunt who couldn't get off the line. The real volunteers  who weren't necessarily lifers back then, tended to be lurps, or rangers, or SF. Great little documentary. 60 Minutes did an episode on a company in the field about this time that flat out refused tomove along a trail they knew was goig to be ambushed. Wish I could remember the name of it."
Documentaries,3dawgf,Beamish_Boy,6,Tue Jul 14 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree, you seem to imply that all lifers are officers which isn't true, there's plenty of lifers who are grunts infantry (grunts) and had the exact same job. Just because you're a lifer doesn't mean you aren't a grunt, plenty of lifers are infantrymen.  What they meant when they said a lifer was sending them out staying a few hundred meters back, was obviously a Captain or XO staying out of the fight (rightfully so) so he was able able to command and receive orders from above."

Anyways, John Reed - played by Beatty - was sitting at the right end of the table, looking pretty inconspicuous, when suddenly the speaker asked him what his opinion on the motivation behind the war was. You know what he did? He quietly stood up, looked around the room, and loudly said one word before sitting back down: Profits.

Documentaries,3dete4,aequitas3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:36:13 2015 UTC,"I don't understand who would want to return to the Khmer Rouge, or why.    The Khmer Rouge and their supporters wanted to return to power. After they were almost defeated by the Vietnamese in 1979, they were given shelter in Thailand and their army was rebuilt with the help of China, ASEAN and the US. There were various reasons for this. Thailand didn't want Vietnam on it's border, China wanted to curtail Vietnam/USSR influence in the region, as did the US. The US perhaps wanted to punish Vietnam after the Vietnam war.   In 1993 Khmer Rouge still had a considerable army and were one of the factions that were included in the peace agreements. They refused to disarm during the UN period and then withdrew from the 1993 elections. Because of their continuation of the war after the UN left they were outlawed in 1994. In 1996 a large number defected to the government side. They eventually splintered further and the last members surrendered in January 1999.     Looks like I'll be watching this..   Keep in mind that John Pilger tended to be very one-sided in his views on this conflict, and was very pro-Vietnam. I'm not saying he was right or wrong, just that he wasn't exactly a neutral observer."

Some probably could have a relatively complex conversation if both interlocutors have a great domain of the language and/or know each other very well (so they can predict what the other say).   Imagine being in a mountaintop and I'm on other mountaintop, couple miles away. I scream at the top of my lungs ""HELLO FFROOK"". You would probably hear something like ""EEEELLLOOO--ROOOK"". If you whistle something that sounds like ""EEEELLLOOO--ROOOK"", that sound can be as clear (or more clear) than screaming to the top of your lungs, and would require a lot less effort. With time and practice, it can be improved, but it will always be dependant in the ability of the listener to reconstruct the original message."

Thats really the only reason those few animals have on averaged lived shorter lives.   Animals in the wild live pretty rough lives unless you're at the top of the food chain.

Documentaries,3d7s6b,Flowah,14,Tue Jul 14 22:01:15 2015 UTC,"There are several reasons why no one wants to do anything about this, the main one being no one gets any short term advantage or benefit from doing so.    The Chinese are perfectly content to allow NK to exist as-is since they act as a buffer between themselves and the Unites States.    SK is in favor of reunification on the surface but lacks the resources to practically absorb NK and rebuild its infrastructure while also attending to millions of malnourished citizens - this is all while making the assumption that there is no resistance from the essentially brain washed North Koreans.    While NK doesn't pose any serious military threat in terms of an engagement with the United States, they do have thousands of artillery pieces aimed at Seoul as a kind of knife to the throat of SK - just in case. Yes NK has successfully detonated a nuclear warhead, however, the nuclear threat is currently minimal if non-existent. They have not shown they have the ability to miniaturize nor effectively deliver a nuclear warhead in any capacity (save from digging a big-ass tunnel and burying it under Seoul). There is also the very real threat of guerrilla insurgency which would draw out the pacification process making it even more difficult to rehabilitate Korea.    Now, assuming SK and the US were willing to accept the collateral damage from this engagement, we face the same situation that brought about the stalemate in the first place - namely China's involvement in the peninsula. There is absolutely no way that China would let the United States seize NK, it would be a geopolitical slap to the face of China who is currently aggressively asserting its sphere of influence in East Asia.    So where does that leave us? China doesn't want to do anything because it doesn't benefit in any way. The United States, while being strategically advantageous, isn't in a position to confront China nor does it have the political capital to wage another war (all while Russia is currently flexing its muscles). South Korea would sustain civilian casualties in at least the tens of thousands while Seoul is significantly damaged, not to mention being essentially bankrupt in the attempt at reunification.    The only way this works is if there is a slow transition, the only way that works is if the political party finally starts to disintegrate and come to the negotiation table. It's really a sad situation, however no one really has any incentive to do anything about it presently.  EDIT: typos."

I also might have seen it on the web, which would make it's appearance questionable. Did a search, didn't find shit. But see it I did.  It sticks in my mind that it was a German uni, but could have been a scandinavian country.    Found this in wikpedia;  According to reports first published in Japanese newspapers, he went to school in Switzerland near Bern. First reports claimed he attended the private English-language International School in Gümligen near Bern under the name ""Chol-pak"" or ""Pak-chol"" from 1993 until 1998.[20][21][22] He was described as shy, a good student who got along well with his classmates and was a basketball fan.[23] He was chaperoned by an older student, who was thought to be his bodyguard.[24]  Later, it was reported that Kim Jong-un attended the Liebefeld Steinhölzli school in Köniz near Bern under the name ""Pak-un"" or ""Un-pak"" from 1998 until 2000 as the son of an employee of the Embassy of North Korea. Authorities of Köniz confirmed that a student from North Korea, registered as the son of a member of the Embassy, attended the school from August 1998 until the autumn of 2000, but were unable to give details about his identity. Pak-un first attended a special class for foreign-language children and later attended the regular classes of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and part of the final 9th year, leaving the school abruptly in the autumn of 2000. He was described as a well-integrated and ambitious student who liked to play basketball.[25] However, his grades and attendance rating are reported to have been poor.[26][27] The ambassador of North Korea in Switzerland, Ri Tcheul, had a close relationship with him and acted as a mentor.[28] One of Pak-un's classmates told reporters that he had told him that he was the son of the leader of North Korea.[29][30] According to some reports, Jong-un was described by classmates as a shy child who was awkward with girls and indifferent to political issues but who distinguished himself in sports, and had a fascination with the American National Basketball Association and Michael Jordan. One friend claimed that he had been shown pictures of Pak-un with Kobe Bryant and Toni Kukoč.[31]  In April 2012, new documents came to light indicating that Kim Jong-un had lived in Switzerland since 1991 or 1992, earlier than previously thought.[32]  The Laboratory of Anatomic Anthropology at the University of Lyon, France, after comparing the picture of the boy Pak-un taken at the Liebefeld Steinhölzli school in 1999 with a picture of Kim Jong-un from 2012 came to the conclusion that the two faces show a conformity of 95%. The head of the institute, Raoul Perrot, a forensic anthropologist, considers it most likely that the two pictures show the same person.[33][34]  It is believed that the student at the Gümligen International School was not Kim Jong-un but his elder brother Kim Jong-chol. It is not known whether the student known as Pak-un in Liebefeld Steinhölzli lived in Switzerland prior to 1998.[35] All the children of Kim Jong-il are said to have lived in Switzerland, as well as the mother of the two youngest sons, who lived in Geneva for some time. The Kim clan is also said to organize family meetings in Switzerland at Lake Geneva and Interlaken.[28]  Most analysts agree that Kim Jong-un attended Kim Il-sung University, a leading officer-training school in Pyongyang, from 2002 to 2007.[36]  For many years, only one confirmed photograph of him was known outside North Korea, apparently taken in the mid-1990s, when he was eleven.[37] Occasional other supposed images of him surfaced but were often disputed.[38][39][40] It was only in June 2010, shortly before he was given official posts and publicly introduced to the North Korean people, that more pictures were released of Kim, taken when he was attending school in Switzerland.[41][42] The first official image of him as an adult was a group photograph released on 30 September 2010, at the end of the party conference that effectively anointed him, in which he is seated in the front row, two places from his father. This was followed by newsreel footage of him attending the conference.[4"

Documentaries,3d7s6b,tbwnz,3,Tue Jul 14 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"This will get downvotes, as always but, you can't deny or acknowledge something where you have no proof that it exists or not.   The only proof today are some sketches, a satellite picture of a building which the Western media call a camp, a book whose author recently said not everything he wrote was true and CNN articles.  VICE btw is always exaggerating with their articles, just to make them more entertaining. Most recent cases was a NPD march in Germany, dramatized like it would be in the Third Reich or about Polish racist skinheads attacking a family party in the UK, which turned out to be a meeting of football fans who were attacked by some British antifascists in a park. These guys were not even political.   So, what I want to say is, we don't have any single proof about anything that is going on in North Korea. No videos, no photos. Only a few shady witness statements, pushed by the media (the South Korean and American media are notorious for their unbiased articles, right?).   It's by the way the same media you call liars in other topics. You talk about brainwashed North Koreans without even realizing that you are brainwashed as well.   And again, I am not denying these camps, I am not acknowledging them too just because I don't have any proof about this whole topic. I am sure North Korean media can write good articles about the US as well, the gang violece, prison rape and homeless problem, making the US into some kind of third world country in the eyes of North Koreans.   Just one intresting story for people who might be intrested. My grandparents grew up in national socialism, my parents in communism, in Upper Silesia. West German media got entry to the country, distributing some free goods among the people. A camera recorded it. Many people took advantage of it. When my familywas able to leave communism, they saw this incident in a documentary about the fall of communism. They were reporting that people were starving and West Germans had to come to distribute free food. No one was starving there, it's just propaganda. It's the same as you distribute free Sushi on the Time Square, record it and say Americans are starving.   So, just think about it, which proof do you have about anything from North Korea?"

I definitely don't trust Vice as a source for information, but there is plenty other sources to find information about this kind of stuff.  The way I see it, there's not necessarily proof, but the there's enough suspicion where I think it is North Korea's obligation to deconfirm this information. Just like how a police officer would search your house after getting a search warrant. Someone should be able to step in and check out these various places shown in the video and mentioned by other defectors.   By the way, I'm glad you feel like you can express your opinion.

If I read on reddit stuff like: ""We need to change something"", it often has this undertone, that the US should invade the country but this makes the most sense.   It's really difficult though. North Koreans might be paranoid about spies exploring too much of the country if they suddenly get free access, the West would still say the North hides something if it's restricted access with guards or soldiers.   The best decision in my opinion would be an unification and as a German, I hope that happens because it was only positive for our country. That means though, that Americans have to let Korea go like they let go West Germany and how the Russians let go East Germany. Is the US willing though? They have lots of soldiers and weapons there, they would lose an important location close to China."

To me this reeks of the Communist party attempting to control certain aspects of peoples lives.  Those Chinese gamers act just like all the gamers I've met, they clearly didn't have any social problems, you could see them socializing in rehab.  The best evidence of damage they could show was the poor mother crying about her son turning into an internet addict, and how she had seen it on TV and in movies. As in, she knows nothing, she's just reacting to popular culture she saw on TV, and wanting to have her own soap opera to star in.  Clearly the only problem these kids had was one of being kids, and being kids who have been influenced by the West, and free thought.  This pattern has followed previously in China, and other Communist Regimes. Having a political opinion in China, when not employed in politics, is classified as a mental illness.  Look at the Rehab center itself, designed like a bootcamp, singing Chinese communist songs. How is any of this supposed to help them? I don't know either, but it certainly is designed to try to train up some good Communist Chinese children.  With Xi Jingpings opinions on the West, and its values. This whole thing just struck me as more of the Chinese Communist Party trying to remain relevant in the face of a globally connected community, and a generation of kids who don't buy into the bullshit, and are threatening to start another uncontrolled cultural revolution.  Really you could argue this isn't even Xi Jingping, but just part of a larger movement among the CPC since Deng Xiaoping's conflict with Mao Zedong in the 1980s, and the increasing Westernization that continues to horrify the more conservative members of the CPC."

None of the parents show any empathy with their children and they force the one kid to accept his abusive dad beating him and threatening him with a knife. They never said the dad was wrong and force him to kneel before him chant dad over and over.  If you want tto defend that please go ahead.

They told them in class that all the parents have been doing was pushing them to study, and that they weren't developing any sort of relationships. They taught the parents that their children were then becoming lonely and had no choice but to resort to online gaming. They basically said it was the parents fault in those classes.

The sheer amount of written information available regarding the everyday trials and tribulations of the builders, stonemasons, scribes etc. who worked on Thebes' many wonders allows John to build up a vivid picture of their personalities, hopes, dreams and foibles, across a gulf of time spanning thousands of years.  Some may find his narrative style a bit unusual; it's informal, flippant and has an ad-lib-type quality, and the cadence of his delivery can be a bit uncomfortable and breathless at points. There are a few jokes and off-hand comments that, if this was made today, probably wouldn't have made the final cut.

Few want to bike 30 miles into the city to go to work because they have to do so via motor infrastructure, but imagine if they had an unbroken, uninterrupted cycle track where they could just pedal flat-out without worrying about their safety?

This is one of the reasons Groningen (the city) is such a lively city. A lot of people come to the city to work, party, shop, and relax.

Our cities also aren't typically set up like European cities.  Even our newest cities are a few hundred years newer than European cities and the super-urban compact design didn't really catch on.  No one in America is gonna want to bike between WalMart & Bestbuy.  That's our city centers, typically.  Although we certainly have this old-town city center look in SOME towns, they're much smaller and people want to be able to get to them and park in the center with a car.

At night, when there's no other option, the 22 can be a godsend. But when the Hotel 22 is in full effect, it is a very humbling experience. Many nights it can be shoulder to shoulder, standing room only.   You can be off work late or just out of the bar(s), trying to sober up with some food on the way home. It's like trying to eat in front of a hungry orphan. And you try to give what you have left, but more often than not, they reject it. You see crying, paranoid people that may not be all there, clutching to their last bit of belongings while trying to get a wink of sleep in a bus packed full of strangers.   One of the most faith restoring things I've ever seen was on that bus route. Last year, I saw a middle aged African American gentleman riding the line, back and forth, during a heavy storm. Trying to collect all the homeless he could and bring them all to someone who was opening their home to anyone in need of shelter. Now, I'm not a believing man, but I still stood up and shook his hand and said God bless him for what he's doing as he left.  Watching this brings back quite a bit of memories. Hard not to shed a tear or two."

For every one homeless person that's a legitimate down on his luck guy, there are 10 who are addicts or have mental problems. That first group is easy to help, that second is both much more prevalent and much harder to fix. You can't force anyone to do anything, you know? Part of me thinks maybe we should send people out and find the ones who have mental problems and institutionalize them. However, that's a both dangerous precedent and morally questionable . I don't know the answer.   Drug addicts are similar. Who am I to tell them not to be an addict? There is a dude who chills by a stoplight collecting change. Hes actually a nice guy. Ill bum him smokes and buy him a hotdog every so often. Randomly I met a family member of his. He explained that the man is an addict. They have spent thousands of dollars getting him treatment, but it never sticks. He doesn't hurt anyone, but just seems content in his homeless panhandling life life of drug use.   I just don't know..."

I just want to say, however nice someone can be, can just be a facade. And you begin to recognize this fake niceness in a person who you know maybe or who you see panhandling. But nobody all of a sudden will stop giving to this man. No mass movement will occur where everyone is like ""Oh fuck, fuck homeless people"" and not give them money anymore. And they know that so they choose to emulate the nicest, and maybe even most honest-looking poor person you have ever seen. because humans will always have compassion for outsiders or people who seem to be falling out of the group.  But more importantly, the American working class and baby boomers have compassion. Places like india and china have 'successful' bums, but I do not think anywhere else in the world exists this universal feeling of wanting to help the homeless. So they fucking work you. They milk the shit out of the system just like every other species of rat has done in our modern history. They even have designated homeless people now in my city. They have to sign forms stating that they are homeless and they give you a bright colored vest that you have to wear while begging, or else the act is illegal.

Hey fine you for living out of a car and recently tore up benches in places where homeless we're known to rest their heads at night. But then everyone turns around and screams rights for all, equality, and we're good to people. It's a liberal area where they have money but don't want to help. There is also a high suicide rate in local high schools. I graduated last year and in the year since I left I believe 4 kids died. The one thing that will stick with me through my entire life from that city is the homeless man I saw everyday on my way in to work. He didn't look homeless tho. Clean cut, shaved, nicely dressed. He would sleep on a bench over night then before anyone was around would shower under a hose, put on his suit and tie, and go to work. On top of no one actually helping the homeless the prices are so high in the area for homes that a man with a job, a job that required a suit, is sleeping on a bench. I'm disgusted to be from a place where people yell out that they are good people and help others but sit by while the homeless get pushed out and kids kill them selfs."

One of the problems I see is that there's not a great forum or assistance in getting these people connected with the options available to them. A police officer might give them a pamphlet or someone might make rounds on known homeless locations but a bus could be a great resource. They have all these flyers for other bus lines why not throw in local homeless shelter flyers, and maybe hire bus drivers with humility and understanding specifically for these late night bus rides. It's hard to imagine that we lack this much compassion in the bay, we've got a lot of love, but a lot of problems to.

An obfuscation, common in many a poor argument, or from a person with no argument at all. It is perfectly possible to criticise the USA, or anyone else,  without throwing your lot in with extremists and fascists as Pilger has.   The removal and dismissal of people inconvenient to his worldview  is particularly sinister, tens of thousands of brave Ukrainians who no longer wanted their destiny decided from Moscow, protested and were shot in the streets by Putin's  puppets gone. Now replaced by a fanciful NATO coup commanded from Washington. Don't expect to hear about the plight of Gazan's, bombarded periodically by Israel and terrorised daily by Hamas, who will kill them for being gay, atheist, the wrong type of Muslim, or just a woman who didn't know her place. They and those like them will never be the victims of their own governments in Pilger's view, no it's the USA that is responsible. It is the absolving of these oppressors and tyrants that irks me, not the criticism of Uncle Sam, responsible for many evils too in it's time. I'm not even American! The willful misappropriation of blame ultimately attempts to absolve evil, and that I cannot abide."
Documentaries,3d560s,chipsngravy,2,Mon Jul 13 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"without throwing your lot in with extremists and fascists as Pilger has     When did he do that? This is a pretty serious and controversial claim, it would be helpful if you provided a citation.   I'm not seeing the part of your comment where you address your claim that Pilger spouts ""Putin propaganda"". Honestly I don't know a huge amount about the Ukraine, so if you can show where exactly he has his facts wrong that would be helpful. Here is probably Pilger's most widely distributed piece on the Ukraine. Where is he wrong here? I did some research and there is definitely evidence that the US has been meddling in the Ukraine for a long time, for example this looks pretty damning, I'm not going to bother providing citations that show Nato and US support for the unelected government which has links to neo-NAZI groups, but I will if needs be.  I can't take your comments on Gaza seriously. Your description of the carnage unleashed by Israel as a ""periodic bombardment"" completely glosses over the magnitude of the humanitarian disaster they have caused. Tens of thousands dead including disproportionate numbers of children, bombings of schools and hospitals, destruction of tens of thousands of homes and civilian infrastructure. The argument that Pilger can't mention this unless he also criticises crimes committed by Hamas is so ridiculous it doesn't merit serious comment."
Documentaries,3d5onv,John_Adamska_Miller,8,Mon Jul 13 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"I've been to quite a few countries and about 1/3rd of African countries.  I generally find at least some novelty value in a place, and I can generally visualize living in that place.  I can totally see myself in bigger African cities like Lusaka, and even smaller cities like Gaborone and Bulawayo.    But I can't see myself in South Africa.    South Africa reminds me of a ghetto USA city, except that black ghettos are huge and -much- worse, and good neighborhoods are tiny, expensive, and very gated.  It's like living in a gated resort - looks great if you don't step outside.  If you keep a very tiny life radius, you might not notice.  But if you like to explore where you live, the region is shit.    Things are slowly changing and today you can see some blacks/Indians/etc in swanky malls in Sandton/etc.  Alexanda is still a dump, but today, in 2015, a huge chunk of famous Soweto looks better than many parts of the USA.  So things are changing... But remember, it's been 25 years...    Perhaps we are expecting things to move too quickly.  You don't just get an educated qualified black majority overnight.  It takes time - a lot of time.  You can't just take illiterate people who live in shacks and turn them into productive members of modern society overnight.  It will take many decades.

But I'm not gonna deny the fact that some of John Pilger's documentaries have become dated, because this is one of them. But even then, it does still provide an insight into... the outlook at the time of it's production, which was a mere four years after the end of Apartheid.   John actually wrote a piece in 2014, titled 'South Africa: 20 years of apartheid by another name', where he states that ""a babbling brook of bullshit engulfed the first ANC governments, especially its finance ministries"", before calling them out on their failures and once more repeating the Nelson Mandela quote: “If the ANC does not deliver the goods, the people must do what they have done to the apartheid regime.”"

For the vast majority of SA's population (i.e. black people) life had been horribly violent since the 17th c and the expansion of the colonial frontier.  Along with colonialism came the grinding poverty of a migrant labor system.

Documentaries,3d5onv,_Conan_of_Cimmeria_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"That article reads like a general rant against communists rather than any real appraisal of Mandela's role in the ANC.  Mandela lead the ANC as a non-violent organisation for some 20 years before the South African government decided to open fire on a peaceful demonstration in Sharpeville. The government subsequently banned the PAC (a more militant branch of the ANC) for organising the demonstration and also banned the ANC at the same time.  Only at that point (1961) did Mandela start involving himself in illegal activities and guerilla training abroad. With others he founded MK whose activities were more acts of sabotage to exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties, bombing military installations, power plants, telephone lines and transport links at night, when civilians were not present.   Wiki has a much more balanced view on his activities than the article you posted. It is not as if he doesn't have the odd skeleton in his closet (see membership of SACP) but he was never involved in the killing of thousands of civilians which that article is implying.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela   The problem is by the time the South African government realised that something had to be done about apartheid Mandela was already old.   By the time he lead the ANC to victory in 1994 he was already 76 (75?), and 82 when he left office. During that whole time he was plagued with poor health, very likely because of the years in prison. His ambition for national reconciliation were not realised not through lack of trying, but mostly because of a lack of time in a country that had spent years racially divided, and because the sanctions that had brought the impetus to bring down apartheid in the first place also left the country with large financial problems.   Lastly, whereas Mandela wanted to bring the country together the ANC that followed him were not committed to that ideal.  IMO Mandela was the best thing that could have happened to South Africa but it came many years too late."

It is true that the political deal made between the ANC and National Party to transition from apartheid had some unfair things in there, which put the new government on the back foot. For example many white government employees retired with full pension around 1994, significantly decreasing government funds.   Also, its not like all the white people just handed all their money to the black people. Not a lot changed in those 4 years. People kept doing business, and many white people now had bigger markets in which to do business.

For example    OMFG! That statement qualifies for understatement of the year!  How about, for example, the fact that the white racists gave up every government ministry except the finance ministry?  Refusing to give up control of the finance ministry meant whites were still in charge. This meant that the decades of ill-gotten economic gains, economic gains from an immoral system of near-slavery and racism, were protected and kept by the white racists.  Mandela essentially sold out black South Africans with that single deal. The economy of South Africa today is still controlled by whites, and that history is the reason why millions of black South Africans still live in dire poverty today.

Documentaries,3d5onv,delphium226,19,Mon Jul 13 20:05:28 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Speaking as someone with a huge white South African family, and as someone who has lived there for multiple, extended periods of time, I wanted to take a moment to disabuse you of your paranoid fantasies. My family in Capetown lives in a gorgeous three bedroom home out in Hout Bay. It overlooks the ocean, with a view so enviable I couldn't imagine affording a piece of real estate so nice here in America. My family in Port Elizabeth live in a comfortable home in the suburbs- their pool is quite nice, which is weird, because the ocean is so close, right? In Johannesburg, where  I have the most family members of all, some live in gated communities, others live in apartments and some live in homes on regular streets. Johannesburg in particular demands higher security measures than many other cities in this country, so there they have high walls like most other upper middle class families.  The lives my white South African relatives lead are rich and excellent. They go to good schools, have great jobs, participate in their local communities, and generally just enjoy themselves. One cousin is an architect. One uncle manages a hotel. Another is an IT professional. Like most other large, wealthy, democratic countries on this planet, the South Africa they live in possesses a strong civil society and offers a lot of opportunity to those with the economic foundation to support themselves. I'm not sure who misled you into believing something as insane and ridiculous as 'apartheid is now for the whites, who live in camps' but you should probably get to know a bit more about the country before you repeat something like that.  Of course, twenty years after the end of the white supremacist Apartheid regime, South Africa has plenty of problems. The ANC's historical legitimacy, of course, does not translate into capable governance. The integration of a majority underclass into a lean civil society was never going to be easy, or quick. That's one small part of why it was such a nightmarish idea to keep said majority oppressed in the first place.  But, while these are all challenges that must in part be shouldered by the whites of South Africa, you would be a fool to think that they don't weigh even heavier on the shoulders of blacks. Truth and reconciliation did very little to alleviate the racial economic disparity in this country. There are still millions in the homelands and ex-bantustans and townships living in abject poverty. These are not the new developments of the post-Apartheid era, rather, they are a continuation of the conditions experienced prior to its end.  I encourage you to come visit South Africa. Walk around the cities, the white areas and the black, visit the countryside, get to know the  people, and generally just develop a deep understanding of what the place is like, instead of settling for something that's startlingly reductive and nonsensical, and insulting to the millions of people that call this awesome country their home."

The gangs are a place where this makes sense, so they're attracted to it. Could they be a force for good? I don't think they have the same concept of good and bad as most others. Very few gang members would attack you outright without provocation, and many members that had dealings with my father were honest and good blokes, at least when they were dealing with my Pakeha Dad.  I've been on the receiving end of gang violence and I've seen friends be put into hospital because of this. So it's hard for me to have any sort of optimism when it comes to this. But I know that without the gangs many poverty stricken kids have nowhere else to turn, the government of New Zealand sure as hell doesn't give a fuck about them."
Documentaries,3d47ym,MauveHariboBear,19,Tue Jul 14 00:52:48 2015 UTC,"An interesting way to handle violent and defiant people is to give them just a little bit of control and power. They often redirect their aggression into something beneficial. People are less likely to be resistant to societies laws when they are given the ability to make decisions.  Take a group of gang members, allow them to provide food for elderly and people in need, and they'll do it happily (as long as they run the operation and make the decisions.) The moment someone else gets involved it will get ugly.  Teachers use this method too with students who are labeled ""trouble makers."" A simple technique to get a kid to do his work is to have the same assignment on two different colored sheets of paper. When you hand it to him say, ""would you like blue paper or white paper?"" Instead of complaining about doing the work and disrupting class, the kid will take the paper  color he wants, and be happy that he got to pick it.  Also, a teacher can ask a student a question at the end of class. ""Hey, X, we are starting a new unit next week on The American Civil War. Is there anything you'd like to learn specifically? Just tell me and I'll look into it tonight and bring you back all the information I can tomorrow.""  ""Yeah Mr. X, I'd like to learn about the types of guns they used.""  ""Awesome, I'll look into it tonight and bring it up tomorrow for you.""  In this sense, the teacher is now WORKING for the student. The teacher comes in the next day and says, ""X gave me a homework assignment last night to look into the Civil War weapons. So today we are going to start off with that!"" The student feels that he is in control when the teacher was planning on doing that lesson anyways. Now the kid has no reason to fight the teacher because the kid feels that he is the boss of the situation.  People in businesses and government use techniques like this a lot to get people to go along with them. It isn't only for teachers.  Psychology is amazing."

People in the town will turn a  blind eye and warn them if an other group starts setting up shop.   But like you said it's pretty complex stuff.

I grew up in the brown part of a wairarapa town during a period where there was a long, drawn out war between the police, the mongrel mob and black power.

But afaict, gang recruitment doesn't require that much outreach. The gangs are family and community affairs. They are kept alive not only by the gang and their members, but by environmental/institutional factors, such as the multi-generational criminalisation of communities.  btw, I just saw the movie The Dark Horse.

And it comes with the double-benefit of looking like ""hey we aren't so bad after all guys! its just the government!"". Not sure about NZ gangs but US gangs are fueled by drug money that make way more than the price of making some sandwiches.

He should have come down and gone to court when the told him to. He should have surrenderred after Sam got shot.   BUT:  The federal government, specifically the ATF and FBI, had a real hard-on for targeting fringe people in the 1990s. The tatics of treating US citizens, even those with unconventional religious and political views, as enemies rather than as fellow citizens, has led directly to the increase and popularization of these fringe views.  Ultimately Randy's family did not deserve the treatment they got. I don't think they helped the situation with their actions, but no one deserves to be killed without a trial because the ATF wants to play commando."

Even if you think you're not guilty. Hell especially if you think you're not guilty. Sending a letter to a federal court rejecting its authority and stating essentially ""You'll never take me alive!"" goes beyond ""a bit boneheaded"" and into ""paranoid, delusional, and dangerous"" territory.

Do you believe that his prosecution and trial (if he elected to plead innocent) would've went the same way without the public paying attention? Do you believe that once it was over that the authorities would've just let it go? If he won his trial, do you believe the authorities would've just went ""oh, the court said he's not guilty. The justice system truly works. Let's pack her up and go on home. Sorry Mr. Weaver."" The Justice department prosecutor in that film said it himself.  Something like, ""we in law enforcement think they're all guilty, no matter what the court says."" But what's more likely in my estimate is that without all the attention he would've probably been found guilty.  And have you ever had a loved one involved with the law? In you're experience after someone is convicted did the system just leave them alone because they did their time and paid for their mistakes? That's a bit of a naive view in my experience.   Edit: Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to justify anyone's actions and I don't claim to know what should've or would've happened if things were different.

But it's speculation either way. We know for sure that if one sends threatening letters and fails to appear for federal court, they're going to provoke a serious response from law enforcement. And we know for sure that Randy wasn't harmed in his initial encounter with law enforcement. He was in fact offered a deal.   People get acquitted of crimes all the time. Is it your position that people who are acquitted of crimes are routinely extra-legally harmed by law enforcement?  Because I doubt that.  Let's not forget, Randy did sell illegal guns to his ""buddy"" the federal informant. He broke the law. Bad idea. Innocent people get caught up in bullshit with law enforcement, and it's tragic. There are better examples than Randy Weaver if you want to look for innocent victims of a broken justice system. Weaver is an example of broken justice system meets Paranoid antigovernment gun nut Who willingly broke federal firearms laws.

I do know for a fact that it does happen though. What in my experience is more likely is that they just won't stop until they either found something or provoked him into something they could prove.   I also think that when he refused the ""deal"" that he was offered, he likely did so because he maybe thought that pissing off law enforcement was the lesser of two evils. Looks like he judged wrong. But who would you think is more likely to shoot your son and your dog? White supremacists you informed on, or the cops?   I understand that he broke the law and as I said earlier I am not particularly familiar with this case, but I think that if Sam Weaver was a 14 year old black kid, and this was Baltimore or something, the government would be saying that the ""Compound"" full of ""Anti-Gov Gun Nuts"" would've been a crack house and the family wouldve been bloods or crips and this wouldn't even have been news at the time.   Thats my speculation, and thankfully because of cases like this the public is starting to see through that shit and understand that were all people with our own motives and morals, and that mine may not necessarily line up with the cops or vice-versa and when you wind up on the short end of that dynamic it isnt gonna work out well for you."

Is it still paranoia and delusion if they really are gunning for you and trying to kill you?   Also for the record I think he was entrapped on the gun charges. That doesn't mean I think he has the right to flaunt the federal government.   I won't argue against that but at the same time how many much more serious crimes does ""the federal government"" get to commit before they loose their legitimacy in the situation.  Ideally there'd be checks and balances that if any part of the government got a little crazy (like framing citizens for crimes and then sending snipers to kill them) that there would be some other part to clamp down on them. But reality seems to be that whenever they make mistakes, no matter how egregious or inexcusable they are (if a citizen were to do the same thing), they just double-down on them.  I think that we as citizens should agree that there is a point where citizens shouldn't have to risk their lives to be the one to ""answer to"" criminals just because they have some kind of badge or uniform. They've shown that they are quite willing to lie and potentially murder you, but your supposed to just hand yourself over in the hopes they don't suicide you in the jail cell?  I don't think the obligation should always fall on the citizen to try and de-escalate the violence of government agents.  I'm not saying what he did was 100% right, but it was far more understandable than what the agents did."

Documentaries,3d2i1n,WPKage,3,Mon Jul 13 21:47:53 2015 UTC,"And what the agents did was illegal as well. Now lets measure the degrees shall we? On the one hand was a guy who cut a barrel shorter than he was supposed to and didn't buckle to extortion demands. Had it stopped there and the authorities just put a warrant out for him to pick him up next time he comes into town or something i'd be fine with it.  Instead what they do is mobilize military forces, get a sniper team together, crawl around in camo like Call of Duty: Retard Battalion. Start a shoot out where a kid gets killed, then murder a mother with a sniper rifle from a concealed position while she's holding a child.  So back to my original question. How many measurably worse crimes are government agents allowed to commit before they loose their legitimacy.  I agree he did nothing to de-escalate the agent's violence. He didn't talk them down and keep them form going way the hell overboard. My argument is I don't think that the onus is on any individual citizen to have to do that. I think there should be some sort of checks and balances in place, some sort of cost-benefit analysis at some point to keep a bad situation to spiraling into infinitely worse territory.  And if you think that escalating something to the point of multi-murder is acceptable for some arbitrary regulation violation then I don't really think I trust much in your reasoning abilities personally.  If you want to kill someone I expect a damn good reason."

Would the boy have been shot if his father had not broken the law in the first place?  No. Once again, he might not agree with the law, but he broke it.  I think it is a good law. Every step of the way, this man made decisions that led to what happened.  The only good decision he made during the entire ordeal was coming out and surrendering when he did.  I don't agree with what ended up happening, but that man was ultimately responsible for everything that happened.  It was his actions that caused this.

Lets crawl around in the bushes and wait till they come out into cougar country (because of course they'd be armed) and then use that as an excuse to start a shoot out.""  Instead of, ""Yes it's wrong to break the law, but lets not make this into a worse situation"".  There were violent jackasses on both sides, when you compare the degrees of jackassery however, his was a bit on the light side in comparison.  TL;DR: It's okay to kill people over arbitrary laws that don't solve anything or protect anyone... what a wonderful world that kind of thinking will make.  Laws that make the world a more deadly and dangerous place are bad laws. Bad laws will never be fixed so long as people are willing to excuse any level of violence in the name of enforcing them  Today we look back on the thousands dead from alcohol prohibition as senseless and stupid. In 100 years I hope we look back on some of the ineffective laws we have today as equally pointless and stupid."

To me the most unexcusable mistake the government made not just with Weaver but also at Waco was painting these Americans with fringe beliefs as enemies. We're supposed to be a country with the freedom to move to the middle of Idaho and have weird ideas. I think that the government's stance on these folks was a huge part of why the tragedy happened.   But I think Randy's paranoia about that same government led him to put himself and his family in a situation that could only end in tragedy. I think that time in the history of Federal law enforcement shows us how flawed human behavior leads to horrible outcomes. The government should not be in the business of enforcing conformity. When we consider our government or our neighbors as ""other"" then we treat each other terribly. Let's not forget that a law enforcement officer lost his life during the Ruby Ridge standoff as well.

That same year I used that book in a report and was given an F, it was made worse when my teacher found out that the real author not only signed my book but that we was now a sort of family friend that we planned our 4th of July's around. I am currently trying to contact my father to acquirer the group photo of us and the book he autographed.   Really nice guy who was also vary sad and dead inside. The worst part he said was watching his children being gunned down."

I suspect you he get an F not because of his reports topic or content, more likely he got an F because he can't write. Look at that sentence. Who is the real author? The guy who wrote his school report? I wouldn't be surprised if the report submitted was barely English.   My father, a mostly VARY native american man   What does that sentence mean?  His post is very similar to this ""documentary"". What message or story was this documentary attempting to tell? It did a really poor job of explaining what happened at Ruby Ridge during the 10 day siege. It did a really poor job of illustrating why the ATF was there. It spent the bulk of its time as the young women (who was what 5 years old at the time of the siege) toured the remains of ruby ridge. What was the point of that? Her recollections don't even jive with events of the story other people told in the documentary.  The documentary kept talking about this new world order and ZOG, but it didn't even delve into that.  There were two very high profile incidents in the 90s, this and WACO. The ATF was out of control then and that is it. They were out of control. There is no Zionist movement coming for Randy Weaver. WHY WOULD THEY? If they wanted him and they controlled the world they would just make him and his family vanish.  On another note if you want a really interesting read on WACO, check out the fires of Waco and the documentary on it. Very chilling stuff about an out of control ATF."

Documentaries,3d1zyx,boywbrownhare,3,Mon Jul 13 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'll be up front and say that I am biased on the issue. But with bias one must decide whether one is biased because they see the reality or because they are ignorant (or some degree in between). So make of points what you will, but I will say that I've done a fair share of research that only seems to provide corroborating evidence to the claims made in this documentary (in my eyes). I'll go through some quick points, but first I will say that Outfoxed is not entirely impartial, it is pushing a claim just as one writes a thesis paper in college and tries to support it. Some of those interviewed are testimonials from the inside, some are from politicians, and some are from progressive watchdog organizations like Media Matters—which makes no attempt at claiming ""impartiality,"" but rather to act as monitor to what Fox says. Some don't like this, but I like it because I see the influence and rhetoric that Fox tends to put out, and I want to make sure I'm in the loop. I'm glad someone is watching; that only gives me more information to form my opinion.   For starters, I'll point you to another documentary: Control Room. This is a documentary that focuses on journalists from a variety of news outlets—primarily Al-Jazeera—and their reporting of the early years in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Lieutenant responsible to coordinate with these media journalists at the start of the film doesn't quite see the bias of Fox, but as the documentary presents, begins to accept that Fox too has a selective bias. What I find interesting is that Al-Jazeera was simultaneously accused of being a propaganda outlet from both sides; that is, from Fox as well as Saddam.  Fox News has a tendency to have less informed or misinformed viewers than most news outlets; most of Fox's audience resides with conservatives, for which a large portion of total conservatives both trust and seek this as their main (and primarily only) source for news. All studies can be found in a submission I posted a while back, attempting to refute Politifact's claim on some of this.  Fox News was implemented by Roger Ailes, a media analyst and political strategist for the Republican party under Nixon, Reagan, and H.W. Bush—now President of Fox News and Chairman for Fox Television Stations Group. To be clear, a lot of blind apologists of Fox will claim that Fox has little influence compared to claimed local and network news, primarily the claimed, ""liberally-biased"" ABC, NBC, and CBS channels. Evidence from PEW says otherwise:   But the deeper level of viewer engagement with cable news may help to explain why cable television—despite a more limited audience—seems to have an outsized ability to influence the national debate and news agenda.   Understand, too, that local Fox affiliate stations, with evidence cited from the memos and testimonies in this documentary, receive in effect marching orders from executives. A good example of this revelation is with respect to Monsanto lawyers faxing two letters directly to Roger Ailes and that disseminating through the ranks to end up with the firing of two journalists who were critical of a growth hormone made by Monsanto. This segment from The Corporation gives their account. It should be noted that 4 weeks of jury listening to testimony believed the journalists were protected under Whistle-blower status and the news station was wrong to fire them. After several attempts at seeking an appeal, Fox had the case reviewed and reviewed on account that the FCC whistle blower policy was in effect not enforceable. It had little to do with the veracity of reporting. But my main point in raising this case is that some will claim that, cable Fox News is not associated with any of the myriad affiliate networks—to which I strongly contest.  I hope this helps."

Documentaries,3d00m3,GrapeBread,4,Mon Jul 13 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yes. Just cause other folks are worse doesn't help your situation.   Can you get away with it for a couple years? Sure, like they said in the video, the liver will repair itself. There may also be some cognitive deficits that will also get better over time.  Not judging you here. I went through the same thing and still have those kinds of nights from time to time (birthdays, Halloween). Bottom line though, alcohol is poison, and to process that poison, your liver produces an even more toxic poison (acetaldehyde) as a by-product. The less you drink, the healthier you'll be."
Documentaries,3d00m3,consumeradvocacy,0,Mon Jul 13 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"The less you drink, the healthier you'll be.   How do you explain this massive CDC study that found moderate drinking was the most beneficial for health?"
Documentaries,3d00m3,GrapeBread,2,Sun Jul 12 19:34:11 2015 UTC,"If you notice, none of the scientists who actually have expertise in this kind of thing concluded that moderate drinking was good for overall health.   Of course a journalist who makes his living based on page views will use his vastly superior scientific knowledge to say CDC scientists are full of shit. After all, he majored in Modern English, and Art History, with graduate degrees in History of Ideas, and Journalism so he's basically got the same credibility as them.  In the video they address this topic and basically, the only evidence of moderate drinking (1 drink for women, 2 drinks for men) improving health outcomes is for men aged 50-60 who are at risk for heart disease. Alcohol in mild consumption seems to have a cardio-protective effect which quickly becomes deleterious once you go past a few drinks a day.  You also have to take into account the added risk for certain cancers, and liver disease as well as accidents caused by alcohol. If you know you're at risk for heart disease then it probably helps. If you have no history of heart disease but you've had several close relatives die of cancer, not so much.   And for every person who lives 5 more years due to alcohol consumption, another dies in a drunk driving accident in their 30's, possibly killing another young person in the process, essentially cutting out 30, 40, 50+ years of healthy living.  Here is the link to the actual study mentioned in the article."
Documentaries,3d00m3,Northern_Tang,2,Mon Jul 13 06:29:20 2015 UTC,"This meta-analysis looked at 1.1 million people through 34 different studies and found that moderate drinking leads to significantly lower mortality (15-20% lower). The study found that moderate drinking reduces mortality between 0.5-3 drinks per day, and that the risk for abstainers and those that drink about 3.5 drinks per day is equal. This is across all age groups and demographics and in the US and Canada.   On your second point, the societal effects of drinking and substance abuse are obviously negative. But that is not a result of alcohol itself, but rather poor decision making."

I think not drinking every day is important.
Documentaries,3d00m3,badsingularity,6,Sun Jul 12 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"When you look at the studies that look at the effect of alcohol on all-cause mortality, 1 unit per day (for men) is hard to distinguish from people who choose not to drink - when they choose the right people for the control group. In the earlier studies that found moderate drinking to actually improve health (which helped start the red wine/resveratrol craze), the control groups of non-drinkers tended to include people who couldn't drink due to health reasons."

Odds are these kind of technologies are decades and decades into the future before they become viable (read: probably not in our lifetime), and quite possibly never if you're expecting organs like livers to be ""3D transplanted"". Medical breakthroughs are coming thick and fast, but being able to just replace faulty organs without having any major complications to the point where humans literally don't need to care about their health anymore is basically science fiction at the moment."
Documentaries,3d00m3,SyncopationNation,8,Mon Jul 13 06:31:48 2015 UTC,I was being tongue in cheek but I don't agree with your assessment. If you look at how fast technology has advanced within the past 30 years or so I don't think it's such an unrealistic assumption that within my lifetime (I am currently 29) we will see some major advances in what can be achieved medically and technologically. The only thing that can hold back the advancement is the unwillingness of humans to try new things - I'm referring specifically to right wing Christians and the such believing that stem cell research etc is meddling with God's work.
Documentaries,3d00m3,jarek322,3,Sun Jul 12 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"My assessment isn't just based on how I feel though. I'm a medical student and I remember our genetics professor discussing things like Huntington's disease. How in the 70s when they first began to discover the chromosomal locations they figured a cure was right round the corner, then in the 80s and 90s as they deciphered more and more of the human genome, most even scientists assumed cures were absolutely imminent. Today 40 years on with countless advances and colossal leaps in knowledge, what we can actually do for someone diagnosed is about the same as what we could do at the start --pretty much nothing.   Don't forget, even though breakthroughs are plentiful and there's lots of interesting ideas and avenues being pursued, it usually takes multiple generations for these advances to actually become practical and widely applied in society."
Documentaries,3d00m3,SyncopationNation,3,Sun Jul 12 20:15:48 2015 UTC,"For the specific examples:    3D printed livers: are available right now, but really just for toxicity testing during preclinical trials. Check out Organovo. Plenty of work going on right now focusing on printing stem cells to create transplantable tissues and organs, and other ways to implant cells (like beta cells for diabetes). I think implanted or ""wearable"", rather than transplanted, livers and kidneys might come first (easier to avoid immune reactions), but still entirely reasonable within 20 years. People writing press releases or looking for VC funding would have been saying a cure for HD or other genetic diseases was right around the corner as soon as the genetic defect was isolated, but pretty much anyone actually doing the research (from genetics to med chem) didn't believe it. Those folks would say 7 years minimum after discovering the right drug candidate, and god knows how long before that. Knowing the cause doesn't mean you have the right tools to address it, or even a clue as to what the right tool might look like. But right now: people can shorten trinucleotide repeats in vivo with TALEN and CRISPR. We're a long way from knowing if TALEN or CRISPR can be made safe enough for use in gene therapy in humans, or from dealing with all of the ethical implications. But if the technique turns out to be safe for deleting repeats then we have the tool, we know where to point it, and it's entirely reasonable to expect it will work. Again, a 20 yr time frame is reasonable."

Documentaries,3d00m3,beerybastard,2,Sun Jul 12 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"thank you for this link to a fascinating documentary! However I am puzzled by it. If moderate drinking is so bad for us why do so many moderate drinkers live to a ripe old age? Surely there is a point of moderation between 3 drinks a day and 21(!!) in one sitting. And as the researchers admit, they do not fully understand what causes hangovers. So how can they understand the long term effects of drinking.  My maternal grandmother lived to 103 and she drank martinis through the evening to the bitter end...   That being said I love these twins. They have appeared in a different series, Medicine Men Gone Wild, which is even more incredible than this docu."

Documentaries,3d00m3,blazingeye,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:16:30 2015 UTC,In the UK a standard is smaller than the US. A shot is 1 fl oz vs the US 1.5 fl oz.

This is the study that was linked and it basically contradicts this guy's outcome.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222361/  Although many researchers have included moderate alcohol use as a low-risk lifestyle factor in their indices, any potentially favorable health impact from moderate alcohol use has to be carefully balanced against the well-documented harm caused by excessive alcohol use.1–3,33 Even taking into account potential reductions in mortality from moderate alcohol consumption, the net impact from all alcohol use in many societies results in an increase in mortality and years of life lost.34 Epidemiological evidence yields mixed conclusions regarding the effect of moderate alcohol use on different health outcomes. For example, moderate alcohol use has been reported to be associated with reduced all-cause mortality,35,36 cardiovascular disease,37,38 and diabetes.39,40 However, the validity of observational studies has been questioned because of possible incomplete control of confounding and issues surrounding the proper specification of a referent group.41,42 On the other hand, alcohol use does not appear to afford protection against many cancers,38 including breast43–45 and colorectal cancers.46 Furthermore, the impact of alcohol use on intentional and unintentional injuries is clearly evident.38,47"
Documentaries,3d00m3,bobbybottombracket,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:57:39 2015 UTC,I linked this 1.1 million person meta-analysis below that came to the definitive conclusion moderate drinking reduces mortality
Documentaries,3d00m3,Atlascantakeit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:00 2015 UTC,"A meta-analysis just uses previous studies but gives no insight as to why this is actually happening. They even acknowledge differences in other countries for mortality which they can't explain. If alcohol was the factor they would notice changes across the board so something else is at play here. They even mention there are 0 controls for this. It's a nice observation and I hope it's true but alcohol studies like these aren't exactly trying to find an answer, more of a correlation. There are theories that people who drink socially live longer due to a better network of friends and family vs those who don't drink at all. There hasn't really been anything that definitively shows alcohol does anything but correlate to longer life."
Documentaries,3d00m3,hive_worker,2,Mon Jul 13 06:33:36 2015 UTC,"Making a habit of binge drinking is obviously going to be bad for you because it never allows your body to heal. A belligerent night out with your friends every few weeks isn't going to have a massive effect on your health. Doing it every week or every other week is obviously going to have some negative effects on your health down the road.  The definition of 'Responsible' drinking and 'binge' drinking varies from person to person, so I don't believe any small group research will ever yield realistic results.  Responsible to me means I remember the whole night when I wake up the next day, and Binge drinking means I blacked out at some point, everyone defines it differently. In the end all I care about is if I had fun with my friends. But to some of my friends I know Binge drinking means they threw up, regardless of how much they drank."

Documentaries,3czjbu,ferio252,17,Sun Jul 12 08:23:29 2015 UTC,"They said it would take 30,000 man hours?  So a reasonable estimate is that it would cost the company $1M for this check just in labor.

It is also cheaper to maintain, has more seats and longer range.  Sometimes it's cheaper to upgrade than to continue flying an old plane."
Documentaries,3czjbu,Metsican,19,Sun Jul 12 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"You're correct, $2 million is about average for a D-check on a 747.  What you're wrong about is saying that the airplane is worth $300m. Airplanes depreciate greatly in value. Like, a lot. A LOT.  An older airplane also costs quite a bit more per hour to operate than a newer plane. This is due to both the older components degrading and resulting in needing replacement more often, and also due to the newer airplanes using way more fuel efficient engines.   It's sometimes a better long-run strategy to simply ""retire"" an old plane before it goes into d-check and have it moved to an airplane storage facility like Victorville, CA."

What that means is regular ticket holders on existing routes were being used as mules; the entire plane was not being rented. There are several cases of flight crews doing this is well. There were at least two cases of South African Airways flight crew drug smuggling on regular routes in recent memory.

On the older Boeing 747s, some of these wing loading tests were also carried out as well. The tests also involved bending the wing upwards till it broke. Seven feet was what they expected it to bend in heavy turbulence but the engineers designed them not to break till 21 feet of deflection from nominal.

I always wondered why my tax documents from Wells Fargo refer to it as ""Wells Fargo Bank, N.A."". Part 2 of the documentary has an explanation, which seems to be a minor historical note, and interesting to me.  Here is an article on it from Wells Fargo its own bad self:  https://blogs.wellsfargo.com/guidedbyhistory/2010/04/bank-of-north-america/  TL;DR: N.A. doesn't stand for North America as one might assume. It is for National Association."

Later, watching my grandfather die in the hospital, strapped down to a hospital bed, being pumped full of opiates that didn't even touch the pain anymore, I started to think that the way we handle death was cruel and almost evil.

My second aunt, it started in her jaw. She was diagnosed, and in less than a year, she was dead.  I hate the idea of dying.

That being said, I fully support someone's decision to end their life with dignity when there are more bad days than good.

Documentaries,3cxn77,-Lo_Mein_Kampf-,2,Sun Jul 12 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"This is a great documentary that showcases the opportunity we have to allow folks to end life on their own terms. I strongly considered this route for my disease which has a lot of similarities to ALS, it's pretty awful to suffer at the end with neurological diseases because you lose every last dignity. You become a shell, you lose your personality, memories, physical abilities, etc. I got a second chance at life through nothing short of a miracle, some very good luck and being in the right place at the right time. I feel horribly for anyone in this position that they should need to travel to Europe to die with dignity, which is extremely difficult when you're disabled. If it is your religious imperative to suffer at the end, then you can go that route and die with your morals intact, but you have no right to push your morals on to others who have little desire to suffer pain and indignity. We know who these people are, and which organizations and political affiliations they represent. They push their misleading propaganda designed to sway favorability against death with dignity in the US. It's disgusting. I stay out of politics with the exception of voting, but this makes me seethe with anger.   And for reference to those of us in the US, IIRC, I don't believe this man would have been eligible for  assistance in Oregon or Washington because he had more than 6 months left to live:  Wikipedia: ""However, the Washington Death with Dignity Act was approved on the November 4, 2008 election by 57.82% of Washington state voters. The provision allows an adult Washington resident who has a six-month predicted survival to self-administer lethal medication prescribed by a physician.""  By the time he reached 6 months, he would have been so far gone that he couldn't have taken the dose himself which is a major requirement of assisted suicide. This is why we shouldn't write laws based on cancer alone.  I'll stop raging now, thanks for posting this."

If a terminally ill person doesn't want to play the odds for a recovery, why not offer them the choice?     assisted suicide laws put poor people at risk     If they're already terminally ill, how?     Doctors make mistakes in medical care     I don't understand what where you're going with this point.     assisted suicide laws remove incentives to do medical research     I'm going to say this as nicely as I can; I feel that this is a morally corrupt stance. I am vehemently against this line of reasoning because it forces unwilling people to participate in medical research. People should not be forced to participate in medical research if they do not want to.      assisted suicide laws put pressure on dying people to end their lives     Not necessarily. In states that allow assisted suicide, many patients do not follow through with their prescriptions and choose a natural ending. Merely having the prescription is a comfort measure.     God is the one who created us, he is also the only one who has the right to take our lives away.     I respect your beliefs but I find them intolerant.

Documentaries,3czku8,somethingsomethingbe,3,Sun Jul 12 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"The main reason is because in pluto's orbit, there are lots of other ""pluto's"" which is the main reason it lost its status.

I have not much to contribute to the thread, but if you're hesitating to watch it, here's a couple quotes from Chichek, a 16 year old Kurd girl (woman, really) combatant.   ISIS should fear us, because we fear nothing! We believe in ourselves. When ISIS militants hear female voices, they get very scared. They're afraid of us. Afraid of women. They believe they'll go to hell if a woman kills them. That's why they avoid women's bullets.   And this part especially:   A girl is always at home, doing household chores, Doing everything her parents wish, and then her parents marry her to some man. And then she does everything he wants. In other words, she becomes his slave.  [...] But when a person comes here, they become themselves. My mum is a housewife. I don't want my life to be like her, it's slavery, And it plays into the enemy's hands.  I want to be part of this revolution and protect women's rights. Because I've learned so much I won't return to the life of a slave. Chichek smiles   All this coming from a 16 year old girl. How clever and courageous she is.  Big respect to the Kurds by the way."

Documentaries,3cx3o5,Chocolate_fly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:36:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's clear to me now that you edited your previous comment. I thought you were trying to say that citizens in the U.S. we're less sympathetic (relative to other western countries) because our government is constantly at war.   The distinct between the U.S. government and its citizens is appalling. The government doesn't represent the people in this country. I'm sure it's like that in most places too. I know most Canadians hate their leaders.   To go back to OP's comment though- I think there's merit in him saying he's 1) white, 2) male, and 3) from middle class America. I am also those three things. Being white, male and from the western world growing up in the middle class, we are more privileged than any other group in the world. It's relevant to acknowledge that we have privileges other people don't have- even women, blacks or minorities who are also middle class westerners. I think he's more or less 'joking' that even though he is so privileged he can still feel sympathy and respect for those who are not privileged."

Had OP said he was a pauper black woman, my reaction would have been the same.  And what privileges do we, as white men, have that other people from the middle class don't? These days, the amount of money one has is pretty much the only determiner to the ""privileges"" one is granted. There are some intances of racism, sure, but that's not a one way street.

But these instances don't take away the fact that white people (especially men) have been privileged for thousands of years. The history of privilege influences the modern day in most places. There's a reason we are heckled, and it's because our parents and grandparents had access to education and opportunities whereas minorities parents and grandparents often did not. These issues take generations to resolve. And goes for women, where much of the material world favors masculinity as a proxy for power. Just look at how many women are CEOs and presidents around the world- even in the western world. Sure there are some but not to the level of men. This is a causation of male-centric culture. It's there even if you don't consciously acknowledge it.   I'm a guy, but I'm also a feminist so many men tend to disagree with my views, sadly."
Documentaries,3cx3o5,Fernas21,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:14:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if I gave that impression, but it's not like white people are not welcome in where I live. It's a peaceful neighbourhood, there are just a few bad apples (black and white), that's all.  As to white men being privileged for thousands of years, tha'ts complete nonsense. For thousands of years white men were as privileged as any other man. They would be born in a poor life, obey to whatever nobles controled them and hope not to get killed when the next plague or war came. Unless they were rich that is, then they would be as privileged as any other rich man in the world, regardless of race.  White people were also enslaved. By Arabs, Turks and even by other white people. The word ""slave"" itself comes from the word ""Slav"", which are white people. 1 2 3  And even if our ancestors had more oppurtunities than theirs, so what? That's not my fault, that is no justification to be racist towards me. That's the old ""a father's sins pass to his son"" philosophy, which I strongly despise. They now have the same opportunities as I do, take them. Heck, my grandparents went through famine and had to work since they were children. Were they really privileged for being white? No. They were poor, and poor white people are not entitled to white privilege. Dough is what matters.  And the world favours men so much that there are universities and companies with gender quotas for women, women get shoter sentences for the same crimes and more funding for breast cancer than prostate cancer (despite similar mortality).   Also, things like domestic violence are sometimes synonimous with violence against women. The other day I saw a state sposored ad against domestic violence in Portugal that said something like ""Stop domestic violence, so that no more women die."", despite the fact men are 18.9% of domestic violence victims in here. But only women are mentioned. 1 2  There's always the infamous rape claims made by women in English speaking countries (I say this because I'm not aware of anything similar in Portugal), where the claimants are simply believed without due process, greatly affecting innocent men's lives. 1  These are not signs of a male centred culture.  And what exactly is stopping women from becoming CEOs and presidents? Is there something barring them from doing it or do they just not want those positions, like so many men?  Edit: formatting"

Documentaries,3cv6x5,MasonIsACat,60,Sat Jul 11 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"Watched this a few months before having my first baby and I can say it definitely shaped a lot of my parenting techniques. It's amazing how confident and grateful the ""less fortunate"" kids grow compared to how the more fortunate grow. It reminded me my kid isn't made of glass and that we have been doing this for a very long time."
Documentaries,3cv6x5,youknowthename,7,Sat Jul 11 10:59:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. I have my six-week-old in my arms now and many things my husband and I've chosen to do are based on other nationalities'/historical methods of baby-rearing, inspired in part by this documentary."
Documentaries,3cv6x5,Cuglas,2,Sat Jul 11 17:35:43 2015 UTC,Like what?
Documentaries,3cv6x5,CourageousWren,19,Sat Jul 11 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"I feel that in America we are child centric but in a very technological way: we have strollers, bouncers, all kinds of technological playthings, toys, bottles, pacifiers, and so on. We show our tiny babies that we love them by surrounding them with stuff, and halt our lives to use this stuff with them. Whereas the Namibian and Mongolian parents, in my opinion, continue living their lives, but with their babies much more in contact and more of a constant presence. So while we have a basic amount of stuff for our baby, my husband and I spend a lot more time with the baby strapped to either of us and going about our daily activities, instead of designating play time or reading to him and then putting him away in a crib. Not that this is more ""right"" than other ways, but for us it feels better and works better with our lifestyle, and documentaries like this helped our decision."
Documentaries,3cv6x5,Cuglas,2,Sat Jul 11 18:02:56 2015 UTC,That's a good way to develop your child's language skills (assuming you're also talking to them a lot) too.

I did not want the bed rail, she was insistence. When we separated and had different houses, I decided not to have a bed rail at my house. Sure enough, one time the little rolled out of bed and I heard a thump! Only to open my eyes to a little giggle and a fun story to tell our friends and family. Now, she doesnt roll out of bed ever because of the experience and does not need a bed rail at either house.  Other examples I find of this mentality, things such as; drinking out of a tap, not stressing about keeping them overly rugged up in cold weather, wearing bear feet, jumping on the bed, not holding hands everywhere we walk, playing in dirt, climbing, been left alone, etc.  I think as new parents you want to protect them from absolutely everything, which is totally natural, but we have to put trust in them to protect themselves sometimes, because if we dont let them learn they never will.  Not sure if this is the response you were after, if not tell me and I will try again  haha!"

Documentaries,3cvbjx,Epignes,3,Sun Jul 12 05:16:10 2015 UTC,"Mm, the fact is, I would be entirely willing to place all the blame for what happened in Cambodia on Pol Pot and his Chinese backers... If the Americans hadn't played an integral part in his rise to power with their bombing campaign, or secretly backed him after the Vietnamese booted his ass to the fringes of Thailand's eastern border in response to his raid of Phu Quoc Island.  This is easily attainable info for those who are willing to look for it. And besides, blame doesn't lie just with the Americans, Chinese, or Pol Pot. The UN and Britain, and quite possibly my own country, Canada, also played their part by helping this tragedy last longer than it should have.  Addendum: Stalin once said. ""Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas""... I hold a great dislike for what Stalin did to my father's people during his 30 years in power.   So, in order to spit in that man's face in a metaphorical sense, I never blame an ideology for bloodshed. Because an ideology is, at it's core, an idea. And ideas are not inherently good or evil. Nor do I place blame on the nation that perpetuated an act, because the concept of nations is also an idea.   Instead, I place the blame on the person/people who was/were in charge of the nation/group at the time of an atrocity, the people who used the idea as a means to furthur their own desires for political supremacy and gave the order to put others through such grave hardship.  So, in conclusion... I may not agree with the words you speak, kind sir... But I would without hesitation defend to the death your right to say them."

Over 2,700,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Cambodia. If you combine the the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan they only total around 35,000 tons. The US may not have created the Khmer Rouge, but they definitely drove the Cambodian people to support the Khmer Rouge, who falsely promised they would stop the bombing.

After the Khmer Rouge were toppled the United States continued to send aid to them through their client regime in Thailand and lobbied at the United Nations to make sure the Khmer Rouge continued to be recognized as the official government of Cambodia.

As they stated, autism is a spectrum, and these men are high functioning for sure. But it's great proof that many people with autism are not doomed to some inherently atypical lifestyle. Plus, I laughed out loud several times at their TV show antics. I really loved this! Thanks so much for posting it! As an aspiring SLP I believe it's films like this, which make people into more than their disorder, that will allow me to help my clients to the fullest."

When that kid started talking about Las Vegas and couldn't even explain why he wanted to live there I thought ""what was the school and the parents doing this whole time?"" In the US a transition plan is required by 8th grade and needs to include realistic expectations for the students exit of High school. I do think there should always be a reach though just like applying to college.   Often completely unrealistic: ""I am going to be a doctor.""   Much more realistic: ""I am going to take some courses in health science at the local college and see how it goes. I am also going to look for a job through my community program so I can make some money.""

Some people look at people who say ""you must have realistic expectations"" as sort of a bad approach, but it is necessary in certain situations.  The Las Vegas thing is a great example--it's great to want to go to a city and live and work there, but what are the realities of that dream? Why do you want to move there? What are the work opportunities? What must you get to enable a non-citizen to work there? Those sort of things. With help, it can be done, but it more than likely won't be done on his own."

Basically, once he moves in with me, he would need a caregiver to come over and take him to appointments, clean, maybe shop, and prepare meals a few times a week. If only to give me a break.  We do have that in place, so when the time comes, he is covered as far as that goes. I do not think he would do well living away from family.  My main concern is him being able to take care of his finances. He doesn't really understand money and is very easily persuaded into things, such as signing forms. In fact, that is why me and my mother are co-guardians. I will probably ask one of my children to assume that position, should the time come.

Documentaries,3cqoyh,downwardsslope,17,Fri Jul 10 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"My son was diagnosed with Aspergers and some of these sentiments in this video hit home.  He is high-functioning on the Autism spectrum and an amazing son.  The depth of my pride for him grows and I could never have asked for a better child. But sometimes it is crushing to have a child with a disability. For a time my son was enamored with football.  He kept telling me that he was one of the best at school and at lunch he got the ball and was an awesome running back.  This went on for a few months and it was to the point I was considering putting him in football. It turns out his perception was way off.  As I started talking to him about training and was working with him in the backyard he explained to me his methods of playing football.  The children thought he was so good they put him on a team all by himself.  Then they would give him the ball and have him run.  The kids would chase him and tackle him.  Rinse and repeat.  Meanwhile my son thought he found something children actually liked him for and thought he was relating and making friends – they were just playing ‘smear the queer’ and my son was the unknowing victim. I cannot tell you the anger and hatred in my heart.  The thoughts that go through my head are murderous when my son gets abused or taken advantage of because he thinks and feels differently about life.   His problem is that he fits in just enough where human cruelty is often ignored because his disability isn’t in your face obvious.  Last week he asked me what it was like to kiss a girl because he didn’t think he would ever get to do so.  A girl told him no one would ever kiss a person like him.  Right now and for the past couple of years we have bonded over basketball.  He wants to play basketball so bad it has become his dream in life.  I have had to subtly talk him out of setting his goals to the NBA and then I set his goals to playing high school.  I have put him in camps and had private lessons.  He’s gotten better but it’s going to be a challenge to have him earn a spot on any team.  We play every day; in fact we are in the middle of the Father/Son basketball championship.  I’m up 3 to 0 in the best of 7 series. I’ve also started teaching him technique.  I’m going to try and get him into the coaching/training angle so talking to him about the X’s and O’s of it.  I’ve started a relationship with a local high school coach and he is going to help get my son some knowledge based skills.  We do tutorials.  I will do whatever it takes to get him involved in what he loves.  But his future, man… it breaks my heart at times the anxiety I have about his future.  He is so easily taken advantage of in life.  He has a younger brother and I feel terrible because I’ve put a burden on him he didn’t ask for born out of family obligation. I fret all the time about what is next for my son.  I fret he will never achieve his dreams.  I fret his life will be one rife with abuses and I am scared about what will happen when I am gone.  And I have guilt about passing that responsibility to his younger brother. I love my son.  He’s the best thing that ever happened to my life.  He changed me in ways I didn’t know it was possible for me to do so.  My only dream in my life is to provide him with every opportunity to be happy.  It’s a struggle at times – people can just be so cruel."

Documentaries,3cqoyh,downwardsslope,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"Well,  the short of it was that I was born before DNA testing and only blood type was available.  Both my father and I have the most common blood type so it meant he was a match but because he was running my mother's name through the mud with his new girlfriend, she dropped the paternity suit thinking he might come around in a few years when he saw his likeness in me (I do look just like him).  Instead,  he told his family I wasn't his and moved to Cali to be a test pilot and died in an ultralight crash when I was four.   Struggles?  Well,  you don't know what you're missing in a way when you've never had it.  I would say there's always this inner voice of shame for being a bastard that is there.  A sense of abandonment too,  especially because his family never wanted to know me either.    Luckily for me,  my mom is one of 11 kids so her family is big enough to make up for not knowing his.  Anything else you're curious about,  let me know."

I would just ask, if there is a way, to minimize or eliminate a future caretaker role for your younger son. I am currently in a limited caretaker role for my own mother and it is a real financial and emotional burden. Half of my income goes to ensuring my mother has a home and some stability in her life. I have had to take this on because there is no one else. I have no siblings. Her parents are too old and don't have the money to help much. While I love my mother, I have lost a lot of my hopes and dreams in the last several years to make sure she is okay. The ability to move. To travel. To do a lot of things. My only way to change this is to earn more in my field so I can continue to support her, and also live a life that brings me some comfort and happiness. In short, if you can find a way to avoid forcing the care of your older son on your younger son...please do. I hope I have not offended you."
Documentaries,3cqoyh,sarahbotts,3,Sat Jul 11 01:26:50 2015 UTC,I understand you.  I do.   I have had to table my hopes and dreams.  I went to school to work for money.  I stay late hours so that my youngest son will not have a burden if I can help it.  I save 30% of all my income to these efforts.  I have bought two properties with homes (I live in one and my parents live in the other) so that each son can have a haven and a place to go when I'm gone.  I've got enough life insurance that all the basics will be covered if something (cancer comes back) happens to me before my sons are men.  I think my eldest will be able to live on his own.  And he will not be a complete burden.  But he needs someone who loves him to help him in life where he is challenged.  I'm doing everything in my power to make the life of my children after me as easy as possible for them.  And I know what you mean.  I've had to give up everything.  I'm in my mid-thirties with no significant other.  Not much time or energy to date.  And having to work my tail off to get as secure a future as possible.    I will do whatever I can to minimize my youngest's burden.  But it is a family burden -- he's only four so he has no concept yet.  My eldest is a tween .

It is hard, I can't speak for your son and even from your comment I cannot truly grasp what how ""bad"" his asperger's is.  When I was in elementary school I had very few friends, mostly they were just the ESL kids who couldn't communicate with people who spoke english as a first language.  In middle school I had two actual friends.  It wasn't until high school when I started to mature and find my own niche.  I just graduated from college and am about to go halfway around the world alone to learn another language and do an internship.  I don't know you or your son but as someone who went from having almost zero friends growing up to maturing and make friends (and hell relationships) I don't see why your son couldn't continue to mature into a fine young man.  If it weren't for my parents I doubt I'd be where I am today, the world needs more parents like you."
Documentaries,3cqoyh,downwardsslope,2,Fri Jul 10 19:35:35 2015 UTC,Thank you.  And I bet your parents are very proud of you.  He is 11.  His disability is not as severe as some.  It impacts him socially most of all.  He has maybe one friend.  He has issues with the fine motor skills.  He's too awkward at running to make a go of that.  We tried a lot.  With basketball we spend an hour or two every day practicing and working on his fine motor ability.  Dribbling with each finger ten times.  Slapping the ball.  Passing lane work.  Etc.  It's a challenge but it's what he loves so I'm not going to discourage it for another niche.  I will let him do that if he desires.
Documentaries,3cqoyh,germxw,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:20:37 2015 UTC,Have you taken him to see a physical therapist?  When I was around seven or eight I went weekly and at home I did body exercises on the floor (don't know how to describe them...).  I still struggled with the little things like jumping jacks well into middle school but they definitely helped.  I hope the best for him and wish you and your family good luck in the future.

If they don't have insurance when they move in, we set them up with Medicaid and get them their SSDI. Normally when they come into a setting like this, their parents are usually their guardians. I've never heard of someone not having a legal guardian. People in our agency have advocates, as well. So, I'm assuming if they were not in their parent's care, then they would have a state assigned advocate. If they are higher functioning, they can be their own advocate."

They are wards of the state and get services, but the funding is terribly, inhumanely low in a lot of cases. A lot of the older people came out of truly awful institutions, and the results of the abuse and neglect they experienced there often almost overshadow their actual disabilities. Unfortunately this often means they are an absolute pain in the ass to be around (just being honest, this would be apparent to you within minutes) which gets them even less attention and often pairs them with the least experienced caregivers. All you need is a few days of training and you're in, and most places are competing for employees with the local fast food places because the funding is shit and a lot of the companies are skimming so much off the top.  Bottom line, society does not give a flying fuck about these people, period. If they did, we would set aside enough money to get caretakers who aren't from the very very bottom of the employment barrel, and maybe the clients could have enough cash so that their caretakers wouldn't have to be buying them clothing and food and cleaning supplies out of their own empty pockets. Absolute BS.  Sorry, shit gets me worked up."

In fact, one of the criteria to be identified as having an LD is that the child must have at least average intelligence. Their intelligence & their ability to process information doesn't match up. There is unfortunately quite a bit of misunderstanding & stigma that LD individuals are ""dumb.""  Also, as a side note, ADHD is not considered a learning disability here.

For example, Down’s syndrome is classed as a learning disability, whereas dyslexia is classed as a learning difficulty, in that it only affects an individual’s relationship to the processing of information, usually manifested in problems with reading, writing, and spelling."""

It used to be that ""Mental Retardation"" was perfectly acceptable, but then it became ""Intellectual Disability"" and a friend of mine who is currently in the field in the US tells me there's an even newer term that's being used. It keeps happening because people don't like acknowledging retardation.  In the US, to be classified as LD, you cannot be retarded. I have helped many children & parents understand that LD does not mean they are mentally retarded. In fact, some of my students had quite high IQs and were even in the gifted range.

It would be the lightest of the massive particles in supersymmetry if the theory holds.  WIMP's and other particles that they are trying to detect are sub-atomic particles. Atoms are made up of composite subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons) which themselves are made up of elementary particles (up quarks, down quarks)  Edit: I should add that this experiment was pretty much unsuccessful. However, they don't know if that's because they couldn't cancel out the background radiation, or the detector wasn't strong enough, or they may just be completely wrong about this type of detection!

I can't tell you how many times I meet someone who has been on a mission and fallen in love (girl or boy) but because of the deep imbedded religious hold that the Mormons have on their congregation it has ended up usually with people committing suicide or on drugs.

Documentaries,3cpxrm,TastyJams,3,Thu Jul 9 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"This documentary is highly misleading and really more of an ad than a respectable documentary. I actually almost attended Earthship Biotectureship's Earthship Academy but didn't after searching more after I found a deleted post on their webforum by Marcus Lewitzki complaining about all the Earthships they built in Northern Europe that failed because of very, embarrassing amateur mistakes like not insulating the ground in wet, damp England. All simply because there is no one design fits every need and region as they portray at Earthship Biotecture.   This page documents the failures of Earthships in Europe: http://earthshipeurope.org/index.php/earthships/performance?showall=1&limitstart=  Proving my point after relentlessly searching for past members posting their experiences, I found that they all were very idealistic people like myself, with no background in construction or related fields. Further, earthships often take advantage of naive volunteer labor to help the labor intensive task of pounding dirt to the tires, and often the well off people whose homes are being built, don't even offer the volunteers meals. I even decided to lose my $400 deposit to attend the Earthship Academy.  Later I found an episode of the permaculture podcast with Bob Theis ( http://www.bobtheis.net/ ) an architect and natural builder most famous for his work with straw bale. The host specifically asked what he thought about Eartshships: http://www.thepermaculturepodcast.com/2013/bob-theis-2/  Some of his major points of critique of earthships: 1) Back in the 1970s when he(Theis) was first building they thought they needed much more thermal mass for passive heating and cooling. Now they know the real key is a well sealed and insulated ""envelope"" and if you have that you don't need much thermal mass. 2) Dirt actually has poor insulating properties compared to many other natural building materials. 3) It is tedious and too labor intensive. You get volunteers excited initially and you lose them because they get bored of the deathly slow pace of banging dirt into tires. Eventually you loose any goodwill and the volunteers wash out.  This guy Theis sounds like he knows what he is talking about and updates his knowledge, while Michael Reynolds is more about marketing himself and Earthship Biotecture when his company's solutions don't work that good, it is too labor intensive and it is not well suited for regions outside of the American Southwest.  Don't let this documentary which is an advertising vehicle for a company hyping a green solution that doesn't really pan out, fool you."
Documentaries,3cpxrm,Nikolasv,2,Fri Jul 10 23:15:34 2015 UTC,Thank you for putting this post together. I watched the docu and always read the comments here if there is anything. I liked it a lot and would have considered myself bias if it wasn't for your post. Always good to see someone shed light on the other side to things.   Anything you DO like about what they do? You only listed negatives and you seem much more informed on this whole topic than me and I would like to know what you think! Thanks again!
Documentaries,3cpxrm,soul_oh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"First off, who has the money for a new built home in what those folks at Earthship Biotecture term ""pockets of freedom""? If you look at their maps those pockets are in marginally inhabited areas of the USA, with low population density that lack many jobs. It is mostly a viable option for people with big pockets who don't have to worry about the local job market.  Second, it is made to sound more attractive than it really it is. I realized after researching that the Earthship Academy is a disingenuous effort.  Earthships are hugely labor intensive, so that academy is a good way to attract naive, enthusiastic people with no construction experience and worse than unpaid labor, they actually pay to be labor to help Earthship Biotecture with the labor intensive tasks of Earthships. There are much better ways to build with large thermal mass, like using straw bales. It is much easier to buy and stack straw bales than pound dirt into tires. Plus straw bales are not toxic and don't off-gas like tires and straw has better insulation and thermal properties than dirt.   What made me want to attend the Academy is that I was sick of my job and being paid to be part of and perpetrate and continue the world's problems and not its solutions. But earthships are not really a solution. For example, locally there is decidedly non-green, intentional community. Even if I had money to build my own earthship with solar panels, how is that consuming less resources than just taking up one room in a intentional community that does not market itself as green? Plus at that community with my rent, I get dinner prepared, access to a personal grocery shopper where I just have to list what food items I want on the refrigerator, I don't have to work hard to maintain social contacts since over 40 people live in the several houses the community owns, I am a 20 minute ferry ride from lower Manhattan, etc.   Dmitry Orlov wrote:     http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-collapse-best-practices.html The idea of making cars more efficient by making more efficient cars is sheer folly. I can take any pick-up truck and increase its fuel efficiency one or two thousand percent just by breaking a few laws. First, you pack about a dozen people into the bed, standing shoulder to shoulder like sardines. Second, you drive about 25 mph, down the highway, because going any faster would waste fuel and wouldn’t be safe with so many people in the back. And there you are, per passenger fuel efficiency increased by a factor of 20 or so. I believe the Mexicans have done extensive research in this area, with excellent results.   The average American car only transports 1.2 passengers! Tesla and tech-investor Elon Musk, are not the solution, they are helping to perpetuate the world's problems with the naive techno-positivist hopium they spread. Why continue to transport 1.2 people weighing 200lbs or less(believe it or not the average American male is about 200 lbs!) in cars weighing 2,000 to 4,000 lbs and pretend that because the car in the future will be electric a real change occurred? It is just catering to the bias of richer, lazy people who want to feel good about what they can buy instead of actually changing our fundamentally wasteful human behaviors. Orlov described a much better solution, but it requires a change in behavior, not a buy more solution that a Reynolds or Musk advocate to their wealthy clients.   Mischa Hewitt was involved the failed Eartship in Brighton, UK and has went on to publish and write about that failure. He now uses uses different materials and approaches after its failure, as most architects except Michael Reynolds know that architecture is not copy and paste, that you cannot ignore local climate and the environment. Really Earthship Biotecture, permaculture and such movements are just gonna burn out people with good intentions with their nonsense and over-selling to make a buck."

Documentaries,3clzoe,A_Fart_Is_a_Telegram,258,Wed Jul 8 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you something as a person who was an exclusive wholesale distributor of olive oil:  There's a reason why I left the industry for royalties and that's because I couldn't compete on cost with fake extra virgin olive oil that was cut with impure crap. My olive oil was a couple dollars more because it was fully pure and won many awards in Europe for its amazing quality and taste.  That didn't matter; people are too price sensitive with all these fake products being sold to them under cost.  Edit: I'm sorry my inbox got pounded, I'm not used to this many messages! I'm swamped these few days so I promise I'll get back to you all by the end of the week.  As for the olive oil, I still have some of my own brand in the pantry so I haven't felt the need to go shopping for it lately. I'm not sure about all the new entrants to recommend any particular one. The free market really pushes a lot of people in and out of the industry.  Taste test never trumps lab test but awareness of acidity, color, smell, and taste can be better than blind. Price point is not always indicative of good oil but it can be. Look for areas the oil is being imported from and check the documentary out. Some regions are notorious.  Small farms overseas are good sources but you'll need to know people. I had met a few Greek people that had small farms in their homeland and they'd bring oil with them back stateside and sell some. Same deal with some Spanish farmers, local small guys aren't cutting their stuff when you get it from the source.  Now to expose some dirt: There are oil producers that will offer both an uncut product with their own label on it or will rebrand it and cut it for an importer. Follow the company trail by seeing who is importing the oil, from what company, and what that company actually sells as far as 'OEM' oil (look for reviews and awards).  Thing is it takes a lot of oil to be worth importing uncut product but there's just not enough demand at that price point. We will see how the market corrects itself in the future. It is up to an aware consumer to demand better product and to force the invisible hands of market forces.  Tl;dr Now that I think of it, it's really like the OEM and Cocaine industries meet. It is up to an aware consumer to demand better product and to guide the invisible hands of market forces."
Documentaries,3clzoe,ZackLabel,125,Thu Jul 9 02:48:14 2015 UTC,"people are too price sensitive with all these fake products being sold to them under cost.

When I ran out of what we bought on site, I emailed the lady I met at the olive mill and asked if she'd send me some.  Turns out, she was very happy to do it!  Only problem is the high shipping costs (70 Euro) - the oil itself isn't really all that expensive, especially considering its quality (about 15 Euro per liter.)    Still, for about $120, I have 3 liters of top notch olive oil that I use sparingly enough that it will probably last more than a year, even though I gave about 1/3 of it away as Christmas gifts.

The tobacco companies asserted that their logos and intellectual property had value, and by not being able to use it that constituted a resumption of that property.

Our FDA has, over the years, allowed numerous toxic and carcinogenic additives to be produced and sold by giant food manufacturers, and labeled them as ""Generally recognized as safe"". Again, they allow the food manufacturers themselves to make this determination.  If one is truly interested in assuring the safety of their food supply, then just grow your own, and buy local and organic. Get to know the actual, real people who are producing your food. Buying chicken nuggets that originate from factory-farmed chickens in Brazil, then slaughtered and processed in another factory, frozen and flown on jumbo jets to a distribution center in Atlanta or Chicago, and trucked in 18-wheelers to your local fast food joint where they're finally deep-fried, is just stupid and irresponsible, on so many levels."

One thing to keep an eye out for is that elsewhere in the world, much of the olive oil bottled as Italian is actually from Spain, and has just been bottled and/or pressed in Italy. Remember that Spain is the world's largest producer of olive oil, and Italy imports hundreds of thousands of tonnes of it each year. There is a bit of info here - this was the first relevant google result for me, but I'm sure there are much better links out there. Most of what I know about this I've learned first-hand as someone who lives in southern Spain, has visited olive oil co-ops, loves olive oil and is good mates with an olive oil broker. I don't want to disparage oils from any particular country, as Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and others all produce phenomenal oils. One thing, give preference to oils in cans or very opaque glass so that you're not buying oil that has already oxidised from exposure to light, and try local oils as well. If there is a cooperative nearby, drive out and visit: it's very interesting, and most co-ops I've heard of sell direct to the public."

I once watched a cooking show where a couple of chefs were casually talking about how EVOO from California is superior in quality. I had never bought EVOO from California prior to hearing that because they are usually more expensive than the ones from Italy. After I made the switch, I noticed the difference right away. California EVOO tends to be more pungent and even fruity."

Documentaries,3clzoe,unispecte,5,Thu Jul 9 05:43:29 2015 UTC,Should be a lot safer sticking to oils made from North American grown olives. Here in NZ high quality locally produced olive oil has really taken off in the last few years.
Documentaries,3clzoe,SHINee21,2,Thu Jul 9 01:24:29 2015 UTC,"Look for things like harvest date (not when it was bottled, but when the olives were actually collected) on the bottle, and make sure that it's under a year old, preferably. Greece and Italy don't have a monopoly on good EVOO, and in fact are more at risk for having adulterated oil, so don't take ""imported from Italy"" as an automatic mark of quality. There are great oils produced all over the world, like in Spain, Chile, Australia, California, etc. You can also check out the website ""truth in olive oil"" run by an author named Tom Mueller who wrote a book on the subject, and I believe he has a list of retailers that sell quality oil in North America that you may find helpful!

If you give them good olive oil they make a face like a kid drinking coffee for the first time.  They want to taste, salt, sugar and butter in their 'Italian' food.  None really cook at home except to go to their grand parents for Sunday dinner or holidays.  The food is all about massive piles of sausages, steaks and cold cuts and limp vegetables.  Why?  Bought in plastic tubs, precooked and presauced.  Nearly every one of them is obese and proud.  Good olive oil is terrible to waste on those that cannot appreciate it's complexity and how it is a result of true craftsmanship.  The mob and the middle eastern scammers are more than happy to supply obese big three retirees and their spawn, with colored soybean oil, posing as EVOO."

Documentaries,3cj5hy,KlugerHans,2,Wed Jul 8 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"""The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners. The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. The command module's inner structure was an aluminum ""sandwich"" consisting of a welded aluminium inner skin, a thermally bonded honeycomb core, and a thin aluminium ""face sheet"". The steel honeycomb core and outer face sheets were thermally bonded to the inner skin.  In fact, the astronauts' overall exposure was dominated by solar particles once outside Earth's magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity."""

Astronauts and instrumentation are reported to have been exposed to 1.79 sieverts during that total time. That ends up being roughly 0.0238 sieverts per hour.  Fukushima robots (with much more sensitive computing and instrumentation involved than the 50 year old apollo computers) encountered 9.7 sieverts per hour.  Not sure if you're stupid or just trolling for fun.  Edit: Forgot 1.79 sieverts was total trip time. So 1.79 / (75 * 2) hours = 0.0119 sieverts per hour through the Van Allen belt (approximating from an average speed.)

As technology improves and costs go down they'll become the norm because there is simply no way for us to continue burning hydrocarbons (of any kind) in vehicles past near future.  Fun fact: It takes 6kWh of electricity to produce a gallon of gasoline (not including the energy used to transport the oil to the refinery and then to the gas station), and the average fuel consumption of a vehicle in the United States is 25MPG. A Tesla can travel about that amount with 6kWh of charge. The process of drilling, refining and transporting fossil fuels across the world is a HUGE waste, especially when the efficiency of an internal combustion engine is only in the ~40% range.

Honestly, the title is off putting but I decided to watch the video as I think it's important to keep an open mind. I think all atheists wish the same of their believing friends. I actually enjoyed the presentation. It wasn't heavy handed and the idea of living in a simulation is very interesting to me. I actually told a faithful friend that it's possible I could believe in a higher power but my idea of the creator would likely terrify them (AI). I'm an engineer by profession and definitely migrate to the materialistic view of the world because that's what works in practice.

Documentaries,3cjp6r,thedinkylink,3,Wed Jul 8 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Watching that video, I felt that using quantum mechanics to argue for the simulation hypothesis was just unnecessary and the analogies to digital simulation just plain wrong. The simulation hypothesis is just that if there is a Grand Unified Theory - a set of equations describing the theoretical underpinnings of the Standard Model of particle physics, then it should be possible to simulate a big bang and a whole universe given enough compute power. We don't have a GUT yet, nor do we know if it is possible for there to be one. But lets say we do discover the GUT and find ourselves simulating small big bangs. The question still remains if we are living in a simulated universe. There are some papers which explore what would be observable if the universe is simulated in a hypercubic lattice with size of the order of the Planck scale. This is to say that the scientific community is not entirely dismissive.   My utterly philosophical argument against a simulated universe is that the simulator must be able to intervene breaking the laws of physics of the simulated universe every now and then. We would call them ""miracles"" and it would be commonplace. That obviously is not empirically true. This is obviously a weak argument since you can say that simulator could be incapable of intervening or doesn't wish to intervene. Then why do we care at all if this is a simulation or not as long as all laws of physics are never violated."

They postulated that the ""graininess"" of universe can be digitally mapped. I don't agree with their conclusion that since it could possibly be mapped that it must necessarily be so. They go on to say that the idealistic view of the world is superior to the materialistic view based on some things Einstein/Bohr said along with the strange observations at the quantum level. Again - I don't agree with their conclusion on this either. The point of my original post was that the video was being criticized unfairly due to the title and should be viewed for discussion. This has been a bit of a social experiment for me to see how the community on reddit responds. I have to say I'm disappointed by the knee jerk reactions of most of the commentary. Fundamentalism swings in both directions. Resorting to name calling about something that might possibly disturb your world view is what atheists have been fighting for a long time. I've never been a believer and would often get criticized that all I needed was to read the good book. I did read it and it only reinforced my lack of belief. This video could be analogous to the bible for you but you should still watch it in its entirety without prejudice if possible. It's not 100% right or wrong - it's just a hypothesis. If you still feel it's not worth your time that's fine too, but don't expect to be the authority on something you haven't experienced (and don't make an appeal to authority about quantum physicists dismissing this out of hand)."

Everyone keeps saying that anyone with passable knowledge of QM would ""laugh their asses off"" or ""no real scientist would comment as this video has no actual science"". I would hope that both of these claims to be untrue as I find bits and pieces of the video very interesting.  I would love to hear someone with direct experience with the ""two slit"" experiment comment, and also I find the theory of gravity and time dilation as possible evidence of universal ""rendering"" interesting.

That kind of thinking is really more akin to religion than science.  The most likely scenario if we were to change the simulation in which we exist(violate the laws of physics, ""hack"" it, perceive anything outside our simulation sandbox) is that we would immediately be shut down. Any other parallel simulations that shared the flaw allowing this failure would also likely be shut down. The flaw would be fixed and it would be rerun.  At least that's what I do when I run automated tests. I can't imagine we would be viewed any differently. There's not really any reason to believe that we are even a focus of the simulation. It's much more likely that we are a byproduct and something else entirely is being studied. An alien race simulating their ancestors for instance.  disclaimer: I do believe it's very likely we are living in a simulated reality but I don't think it matters that much."

At least at a greater scale, our human scale, with practical behaviour. And if it was suggested, we honestly do not know. Look at Einstein.

I stopped watching around 30 minutes in, but at 25 minutes they said something like the ""processor"" that limits the speed of things (like light etc) is equidistant from all things, and space is an illusion. They use that to say that nonlocality is explained. Why then is time experienced slower for those who are around high mass objects like black holes if the processor that would control our perception of speed and time is equidistant from all points? Would not that massive object slow down time for all observers, no matter where they are located, as long as that massive object is being observed? Since mass is neither created or destroyed, how then can time be experienced any differently when moving quickly or being near to a large mass object? Shouldn't that processor be calculating the same amount of information at all times?  Maybe I should have paid more attention, but it seems like either the person explaining things in the video is reaching, or they've got an end goal for all this and are just ignoring things that don't match up and focusing instead on things that might."
Documentaries,3cjp6r,xTRYPTAMINEx,3,Wed Jul 8 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, that time is only movement.  If you were to go into a black hole, time would still seem the same to you. Information is still being processed at the same speed as someone outside of it. Time really wouldn't be experienced slower for those around high mass objects AFAIK, it's somewhat of an illusion. Time only seems slow from our perspective outside of it, while in reality they would be experiencing things in regular motion just as we do now.  As for why it slows down... Maybe our universe has a shitty graphics card and it's bottlenecked with the sheer amount of information flooding into it, and time slowing down is like the stuttering/lowering of fps when you don't have a powerful enough GPU to process everything smoothly in real time. In many video games, the program will only render what it has to, which is more as you get closer to something(IE only rendering trees in a forest directly in view, ones that you can't see don't get rendered. If you're far away, it will only really render the first few outside layers of trees if it's a thick forest). Maybe it works the same way, and as you get closer, the gigantic mass of information that is a black hole just lags you out because you then have to render everything. I mean, I'm completely talking out of my ass here, but it would be interesting if it did work like that."

The argument they are making is not a new one regarding idealism vs. materialism. Does essence precede existence or does existence precede essence? Since observations of the universe at the quantum level are ""quantized"" or discrete it suggests the world is digital. If it is digital is can be programmed or simulated with God being the programmer outside the material world.

I was just confused how the narrator could say that the ""processor"" controlled the speed of time, and yet speed/time was different for an person near a large mass object or an observer moving at high speeds than it was for one not at those relativistic speeds or near those mass objects. If someone was observing that massive object, you'd think following their logic that time would slow for all in the universe since the ""processor"" needs to cope with the extra data.

The double split experiment has always fascinated me.
Documentaries,3cjp6r,kindanormle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:01:44 2015 UTC,"No, you captured the author's ignorance perfectly.  One doesn't need to be a subject matter expert to know this video is a Creationist sales pitch."
Documentaries,3cjp6r,thedinkylink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:08:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was a creationist sales pitch. I ignored that part and was interested in the simulation hypothesis and how it fit in with the narrative.
Documentaries,3cjp6r,aykontakt,0,Thu Jul 9 00:20:01 2015 UTC,"but more the conclusions they drew about the quantum entanglement and nonlocality implications which go over my head.   I don't have the patience to watch that drivel so I don't know if they came up with any conclusions about nonlocality of timespace or the double-slit experiment but if their conclusion is different from ""this shit is weird and doesn't make any sense"" then they don't know what they are talking about or they are lying to you.    Richard Feynman, arguably the most prolific contributor to quantum mechanics said: ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics."""
Documentaries,3cjp6r,thedinkylink,2,Wed Jul 8 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"Just a general observation that you seem highly opinionated/emotional about this. You're also using the argument from authority fallacy with regard to Feynman. If you dont' have the patience to watch what you consider to be drivel then you really can't make an informed judgement about the content. With that said, they covered both the double-slit experiment and action at a distance and offer the simulation argument as a possible explanation."
Documentaries,3cjp6r,aykontakt,0,Wed Jul 8 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"This is not an argument from authority. If there is a real physicist person here, please chime in. In support of me obviously. I read popular science books so I know. The fact that those aspects of quantum mechanics don't make any sense are that obvious.   Just to be clear, mathematics of quantum mechanics are used to solve real world problems, they are confirmed by experiments and observations. There are simple observations and experiments that physicists performed 100 years ago that make no sense to us. Those include the double slit experiment, the quantum entanglement, ok I'll leave it that that even though there are more because the implications of those two easily observable phenomenons are staggering. In our world we can know the past, the present (sort of exists) and we don't know the future. One of the interpretation of the double slit experiment could be that we don't know the past, the present doesn't exist, and we can know the future. Mathematically. In terms of probabilities.  ti;dr Quantum mechanics doesn't make any fucking sense at all and it's not an argument from authority to say that most physicists in the world say so."

Documentaries,3cjp6r,isableandaking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like how EVE Online works, when there are a lot of players in the same area, it leads to massive slowdowns of the game space time continuum. If you go to another server you have less players, thus less information to process so it works in normal speed.  The point where it looks to be flowing at normal speed to external observers is probably related to what they were saying later in the video - the slit/double slit experiment. When they delay observance, the particles behave as waves, when they start observing apparently time reverses itself to prove that the particles were all along behaving properly and not like simplified waves.   Basically you are far enough away from the massive object and the universe gets approximated for you, then uses the time shift to actually deliver the ""real""/observed result, we just don't notice it with our senses."

Below is the link to an explanation of a the holographic principle by the physicist who proposed it: Leonard Susskind along in cooperation with a Dutch physicist Gerard 't Hooft. It's not as simple as the BS in the other video, but he explains the concept of information in the physical world, the law of preservation of information pretty well.  When asked by the interviewer if we live in a holographic world Susskind responded: ""You know the answer, of course not"" (see tl;dr for link to the interview).  Holographic principle simply states that information contained within a volume of space can be represented on the boundary of that space. It's just a fundamental property of nature, not unlike the fact that the sum of all angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.   So the information in the OP video is nonsense.

For video tl;dr go to 10:33 of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJqT357ofuE  tl;dr No, we don't live in a holographic world.

And how can Trump do anything to stop them from doing that???  This must be one weird documentary!
Documentaries,3chrqk,micopedra,-4,Wed Jul 8 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"I just finished the documentary and the director has failed to stay unbias throughout the video. First, the population of Aberdeenshire is 250,000+. They've showed a small population rallying against this project.  The main argument has been that it's been bad for locals/the environment. Trump said it'd be better for the environment. This video showed some pretty weak details on both sides (is there any real danger in artificial sand dunes?)  Right before he was arrested for breaking and entering on the course, the Trump representative warned him that he'd be breaking the law. He mentioned that some film was confiscated while in the police precinct. It's fair to infer that they did in fact break in to the golf course and were caught; and were treated as criminals. The filmmaker never addressed his arrest; he only got a few people to say how absurd and violent it was.  I think this documentary would have better been served addressing the concept of CPO's and the Irish government allowing such an absurd law to take precedence: ""A compulsory purchase order (CPO) is a legal function in the United Kingdom and Ireland that allows certain bodies which need to obtain land or property to do so without the consent of the owner""  The things you can criticize Trump for are: the lack of respect for the community during the construction and, his bluntness.  With what little information this video actually provided; it's an argument of around 10 locals (~100 Anti-Trump protesters at the end) vs. the interests of a billionaire + the Scottish Government. And, it's pretty evident they cleaned up Forbes house for the shooting as Trump and the Honorary Professor from Aberdeen Business school said they have been to Forbes' place and it was pretty much a slump. Makes me question this entire video.  Trump did give the reporter the benefit of the doubt. He answered all of his questions every time the interviewer approached him. He didn't pursue any of the homes with CPOs, and he built a beautiful golf course.  It was an interesting documentary but claiming that he used deceit, bribery and ruthless techniques is unsubstantiated and vilification of something that really isn't that harmful.  Granted, I'm against the 1% having and holding so much power, I don't think we should use Donald Trump as the scapegoat for evil. If he is evil, this isn't the proof of it.  TL;DR This documentary is Anti-Trump in it's core and, isn't representative of the actions represented in the title (deceit, bribery etc...).  Edit"
Documentaries,3chrqk,idontlikechoppas,-11,Wed Jul 8 16:05:30 2015 UTC,its a pretty weak doc. Is anyone really surprised Trump or any other big corporation cares more about money than the wants of a few poor scottsmen?

The initiatives that are public include a variety of destabilization operations. The Department of Defense just seeded anthrax into North Korea into the presence of a variety of North Korean officials. The US, along with SK and JP through the UN are currently executing on a plan to use a human rights front to name and shame various officials throughout the Kim administration via international criminal courts so that those in the regime increasingly question the cost to themselves of following orders from higher up. Propaganda from inside South Korea is being increased in North Korea. Several highly ranked officials have been persuaded to inform on Kim - this led to the, for example, recent (infamous?) anti-airgun execution. We are in talks with China about removing their support and getting their aid for reunification and post-invasion rebuilding. Japan and South Korea, along with the United States have been building interception capabilities to thwart NK nuclear capabilities. We are in talks with China about whether there is a red line that, if crossed, would remove their support for Kim - the idea being we would spur NK to trip that red flag with special operations.  As far as I know the full plan is not public, but it would look something like: the regime is continually destabilized until it is on the precipice of collapse. Under this pressure clandestine activities would spur the regime to take some action public enough for the countries to announce their need - either for self defense or human rights - to enter the country. Pyongang would then be captured, military capabilities seized and a transitional government put in place while stabilization and transferal programs take over. The logistics of this are boggling (there are networks of caves for guerilla fighting and NK has a HUGE standing army)."

Documentaries,3cf98e,Timguin,3,Tue Jul 7 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"Hadn't heard about that one, although similar incidents have happened frighteningly frequent. Even though the NK government accuses the US of targeting them for bio-attacks, it's still quite a jump to make, seeing that this isn't the first time it happened and the deliveries were made to several states and countries, not just SK. Also, why would they deliver it via standard shipment if they intended to use it as a weapon? (Which would be rather ineffective, seeing that it's not a weaponised form. There is no delivery. with a sample of this size you could kill maybe a handful of people if they're all in the same vicinity.)  I'm not sure. Generally, I think many countries have contingency plans involving illegal warfare, but I just don't see it making any sense to use against NK. There's no need because the regime is failing as it is and SK would rather it taking a bit longer, seeing that they haven't gathered a fraction of the ressources they announced they'd save up for this eventuality. There's also easier ways to simply kill people that don't carry the risk of a political fallout that would result from the use of a bioweapon."

Documentaries,3cf98e,RamMeSlowly,5,Tue Jul 7 22:47:45 2015 UTC,"Some of the individual items are things I've read before, but the idea we plan on intentionally flaring up the Korean Peninsula soon is hard to believe."
Documentaries,3cf98e,seattlyte,-1,Tue Jul 7 18:43:30 2015 UTC,Please see the other branch of the thread. I posted a link that will get to you to Geun-hye's address to the UN on upcoming unification. Searching around using whatever search engine you trust should find all of the information necessary to confirm the claim that unification is not only now the official policy of the Geun-hye administration in South Korea but that there is multi-lateral signoff and UN support.
Documentaries,3cf98e,seattlyte,13,Tue Jul 7 18:46:32 2015 UTC,It's not a secret. Don't know what the downvotes are for.  South Korean President Geun-hye announced to the UN that she was planning reunification and asked for UN support.  Here's a Brookings Institute report on Preparing for One Korea.
Documentaries,3cf98e,Drew2248,6,Tue Jul 7 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I'm not buying your assumptions here.  You take a series of fairly innocuous events -- such as shipping a small dose of anthrax accidentally to South Korea (then publicly announcing it!), President Geun-hye's innocuous speech to the United States in which she said what every South Korean president has said for years, that she wants reunification, and run with them a little too ""creatively,"" I think. These ""destablization programs,"" as you call them, how are they in any way different from what we've done in the past? You actually claim we just ""seeded anthrax into NK,"" but you give absolutely no evidence for this astonishing claim that we are engaging in bacteriological warfare against every treaty we've signed.  You say we are in ""talks with China,"" but we are nearly always in talks with China and much of what we've always talked about is . . . North Korea. I guess ""talks"" must equal ""plans to overthrow a government""?  I realize that in some people's fevered imaginations things like this scenario are really, really cool to imagine happening.  Do you watch a lot of video games?  Do you spend too much time alone fantasizing?  Are you a young male in need of some historical and logic training?  You write like all of these.  There is no point in taking a series of minor developments and then trying to link them into some enormous conspiracy as you've done here. The links you provide as your ""evidence"" are weak as none of them speaks to your larger claim at all.  Each is a minor detail from which we are supposed to believe that your larger claim -- the U.S. is right now planning to overthrow the North Korean government -- is true.  Nonsense. You provide no evidence of that, and in fact your argument is your own fantasy and conspiracy theory.  Sorry, not buying this even a little bit."
Documentaries,3cf98e,seattlyte,3,Wed Jul 8 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"I got turned onto the anthrax thing when watching the Daily Press Briefings out of the State Department. Kirby of course denied US involvement, but I doubt he would know about it, even with his history in the DoD, given that sort of activity would be special forces and of course denying international crimes is standard practice both inside and outside the United States. I would note that you would have to admit that the anthrax incident shows that the US has stores of anthrax - so that's at least new information for you. If you think special forces using anthrax is too extremely speculative you can, but that shouldn't lead you to reject the entire thesis (which used this only as an anecdote).  Your characterization of SK policy is wildly off base. Previous presidents run under the Sunshine Policy - toward a mutual recognition of two independent states. It is just recently that this Sunshine Policy has been repealed and Geun-hye's 'innocuous speech' to the UN is absolutely the first of its kind.  The destabilization programs are in fact new, especially their coordinated nature and their appeal toward toppling support for the current regime. The Interview was another one and I can 'be creative' in linking Wikileaks documents and journalist coverage here as well.  The China thing I got directly from a Defense Official during a Washington National Defense Thinktank. So I'm repeating what a high level official said about China. There's zero speculation from yours truly. I can find a link to this talk if you are interested.  I am none of the things you've suggested I may be. You're doing quite a bit of fanciful speculation of your own. ;)  Certainly the links are separate bits to support small sentences from a larger block of text. If you aren't looking for support for individual claims and something for the substancial argument - did you look at the Brooking Institute link? I follow Washington and Defense folks quite closely and am speaking in a casual way primarily from memory and finding supporing links as requested/necessary. If you follow the Hill and defense officials I garuntee you that they are talking about plans for reunification. I can do one better though and find supporting links. I'm a busy man, though, so I'll need some time and I'll need to know that you're interested.  Finally, we have the benefit that time will resolve this 'dispute'. I hope that in a few years you'll remember this exchange. Bug in your ear. Of course, if it doesn't happen, I'll do the same."
Documentaries,3cf98e,JasonKimball,5,Wed Jul 8 04:48:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about this post, specifically the last paragraph.  Of course no one would be surprised if there was a conspiracy to change the government in NK... But the speculation is a little crazy.  Because any time there's a plan like that, things usually change, adaptions need to be made, and ultimately it becomes non-viable.  This is something that Putin has been ""lecturing"" us about on the intl. stage: that there's simply no way to change a govt in this manner and make it stable.  It creates an unstable situation.  I'm honestly surprised we were able to pull it off in other countries and keep the degree of control we kept.  So NK will probably be a failure.  But... if everything you said was true, do you have a problem with that plan?"
Documentaries,3cf98e,seattlyte,2,Tue Jul 7 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"Well there's no conspiracy. The president of south Korea announced it to the UN.  We have successfully done regime change before, specifically unifications. Agreed that it is dangerous and dirty business.  I'd rather talk facts over opinions at this point: it is clear to me that most people do not even know a unification is foryhcoming and so ethical deliberation can't really be had."

Documentaries,3cf98e,StrukkStar,0,Wed Jul 8 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"You think NK wouldn't consider a lot of these measures as an attack? If Kim Jong-un doesn't want unification then there's no other way but war and he doesn't want unification because he'd be on trial for all the shit he has done against his people later and spend the rest of his life in prison or get executed, instead of the comfy life he has now. And as I said, there won't be a war because NK has a really strong military and the consequences would be dire."
Documentaries,3cf98e,seattlyte,2,Wed Jul 8 00:54:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think you deserve downvotes as this is a legitimate criticism and concern.  But the response also (almost) replied with the correct response.  The plan is to first destabilize the regime and then go for unification. There is the risk of war and artillery barrages against Seoul, etc. If done properly the loss of support or splitting of the regime would sever the capability of NK to respond in any effective way to a forced unification.  Yes, you are right. NK would see a forced, unwelcome unification as an act of war (so would we).  But you're missing the destabilization piece. That's critical to understanding the strategy."

Documentaries,3cjnzr,AntennaTV,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:34:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. So why do the majority of venezuelians keep on voting for Chavez' and Maduro's  party?
Documentaries,3cjnzr,bouras,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:30:49 2015 UTC,"Largely, it's simply a result of tying this false ideology of a ""Bolivarian revolution"" to a lot of money given away, or the implied threat to revoke said money.  It works on the individual, organizational, and state level.  For the individual who may be living in or promised some future free housing, attending free ""university"" (really just indoctrination school) or offered the same for his or her children, or a free Orinoquia phone or a free Canaima Linux distro laptop...for all of these people, voting for the party is desirable and required. And the threat of the loss of access to these benefits always looms if they should not attend a rally, if they should not show up to vote, etc.  For the organization, allegiance to the PSUV (Venezuelan United Socialist Party) facilitates access to state resources --which essentially means that they're given access to the teat of PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company). In addition, a loyal import/export firm would have preferential access to PSUV-controlled bureaucracies and may even enjoy a preferential monetary exchange rate, which is a huge differentiator: those close to the government pay 6.30 Bolivares in exchange for one U.S. dollar, whereas those who aren't well-connected pay 616.04 Bolivares to the dollar. You can see all off the exchange rate at www.dolartoday.com ; there are actually four exchange rates...each one with its own technical qualifiers-to-access, but largely just based on who you know.   For the organization not aligned with the PSUV, there exist the less preferential exchange rates, less favorable access to government bureaucracies...and again the looming threat, in this case of ""expropriation"": your company is seized from you if someone well-connected within Chavismo decides you are an enemy, or that your company is so important to the state (or to a greedy and otherwise uncompetitive Chavista) that it (or he or she) has to take it over.   For the city, state, and national public sector, the PSUV again has the ability to give or take away from the budgets used to administer government. They trump up charges against politicians who combat against Chavismo, and pour money into the coffers of parallel politicians and institutions that are installed alongside the official government, first by Chavez, now by Maduro. That is what Venezuela's recently replaced Foreign Minister used to do: he was appointed by Chavez to serve as a de-facto Chavista governor of Miranda state after no amount of engineered voting, bribery, or obstruction managed to replace the official executive, Henrique Capriles.  Just yesterday, Capriles alleged that the last Venezuelan presidential election -- incidentally, one which he just barely lost against Nicolas Maduro -- cost $12 billion. This is the compiled value of money doled out to individuals, companies, local/state/national agencies to bring out the vote, as well as the economic cost to private industry due to the implementation of last-minute ""fair price"" decree: wherein retailers were ordered by the government to sell their inventories at or below prices pegged to the 6.30 exchange rate whether or not they had been purchased at that price, and with no guarantee of access to that rate to replenish inventories. As you can quickly calculate, that would lead to staggering losses.  As it stands today, Maduro's popularity rating stands at around 24 percent. As it stands today, a barrel of Venezuelan oil is trading at around $49, not the $140 to $200 that in the past allowed Chavismo to buy it's way out of trouble. Venezuela stands at the end of the highest-priced, longest-running oil boom in world history, and it is facing insolvency, thanks to Chavismo.  Chavismo has run out of carrots; all it has to dole out now, is the stick. It has done so by putting down peaceful protests with massive force, both governmental and paramilitary. It has thrown opposition leaders in prison, including @leopoldolopez, who -- counter to the counterfeit concept of ""Bolivarianism,"" is actually a descendant of Simon Bolivar -- it has thrown a sitting mayor in prison for ""not doing enough to stop protests,"" only to have the people elect his wife in protest. It has leveraged what little wealth is being generated by PDVSA to give EVERY television network buyout offers they couldn't refuse (1. They paid a ton, and 2. They threatened to revoke broadcast licenses), and they have expropriated or sent military units to oversee newsprint manufacturers in order to deny paper stock to print organizations which are not aligned with the regime.  I could go on, but you asked why the people kept voting for them, so:  TL;DR: indoctrination, bribery and coercion...but they've run low on popularity and are nearly out of money ($17B in foreign reserves, less than $1.5B of that in cash). All they have left now is coercion, violence, and abuse.  Venezuela is about to get very ugly."

There has been ZERO impact on the Venezuelan people as a result of these targeted sanctions.  Nicolas Maduro has promoted all seven, and took to the air in one of his interminable ""cadenas"" -- seizing the broadcast signal of every television station in the country -- in order to decorate them.  A month or so earlier, he had deployed warships to one of our neighboring Dutch islands and threatened action if they did not release a known narcotrafficker, Pollo Carvajal. He was released, and not taken into DEA custody, and a grand pageant was made at his homecoming, too.  It is an evil, and criminal, government.  It is an insecure nation.

It seems that the some students are leaving because they think that their degree would not permit them to practice abroad but some are staying and appreciate the community -based approach of medicine.  Link for those interested.  From the article: Instructors and students at the school defend the curriculum, saying it emphasizes preventive medicine that has a greater impact on daily life than traditional training that might involve costlier diagnostic technology. Students accompany Cuban physicians on rounds in poor neighborhoods and attend classes emphasizing their work's social impact.  Razi Sulaimon, who grew up in a West Bank refugee camp, said he believes his Venezuelan degree will enable him to work as a doctor and is among the many who are staying.  I guess it's just a different way to view medicine. Hard for me to tell who is right or who is wrong. Don't even know if there is a right or wrong in this case."

Documentaries,3cjnzr,AntennaTV,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"With regards to what the ""revolutionary"" universities teach, those graduates didn't really need to know anything so long as they were radicalized and obedient. The oil company PDVSA is the perfect example of that:   Some years ago, qualified oil industry workers and management -- rebelling against Hugo Chavez' moves to take control of PDVSA -- elected to go on strike. Chavez, rather than give up control, fired everyone. EVERYONE. And blacklisted their names to keep them from ever gaining another job with the state, or any sort of benefits. (He also blacklisted any Venezuelan who signed a subsequent recall petition against him. That's the infamous ""Tascon List,"" which you can read about broadly on the internet.) As a result of his actions, PDVSA is now a bloated, inefficient entity with three times the headcount that it had when those employees launched their strike, but which now extracts twenty percent less oil. PDVSA and the country could barely withstand these inefficiencies -- and all of the Chavista embezzlement nationwide -- when oil was at $200/bbl. With the price per barrel now around $49, the only future is collapse. But so long as you wear your red shirts, go to the rallies, go to the elections, and on occasion take up arms to intimidate the opposition, no matter how little you learned at your Chavista university, no matter how little you work (it is unlawful to fire workers, for the most part), so long as you show submission and fealty to the regime, your government job is safe."

Even in Cuba, they teach actual science science at their universities and their doctors could practice in any country with their knowledge.  Venezuela should at least do the same."
Documentaries,3cjnzr,bouras,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:36:44 2015 UTC,"I think the students who are leaving the program first saw the program as a stepping stone; a way to receive a free education, which would enable them to emigrate out of the Palestinian territories with a valuable skillset which they could then leverage to gain residency abroad.  That is not the case. It isn't the case for Venezuelan physicians, it isn't the case for Cuban physicians, and it won't be the case for the Palestinians who stay. Venezuelans with professional educations are leaving the country in droves. In the United States, Venezuelan emigres comprise the most financially successful group of expatriates, and nearly to a person, these individuals are graduates of private universities, or of universities which continue to fight a long, hard struggle to keep Chavismo out of its leadership offices and organizations. During protests last year, a Chavista graduate who had been denied a leadership role in student politics -- via the ballot -- was photographed and identified on the grounds of the UCV (Venezuela Central University), leading a band of armed ""colectivos"" in an assault on the student body.  I have less confidence than you in the amount of science that Cuban physicians are trained in. My cousin was an eye surgeon with the Venezuelan Air Force, traveling to Africa -- with Cubans -- on many occasions to perform eye surgery for the economically disadvantaged. Ask much as he believed in these goodwill programs at the outset, he eventually left the service in disgust. The programs did perform some surgeries, but every group of physicians was accompanied by military, political, and intelligence attaches, working to expand indoctrination, and to secure African routes for contraband, ie drug trafficking. Our family containing a long-lived vein of military service and drug interdiction within it, he could not abide serving to provide cover for the regime's true purpose in bonding with disadvantaged Africans.  More recently, Cuban physicians set doctors from elsewhere in the world aghast with their cultural and medical practices while providing support to the mission to combat the Ebola virus. And again, the intelligence contingent to watch over the physicians they sent, and to explore political and ideological bonds with the affected nations were as big or bigger than the number of doctors sent to fight the disease."

Documentaries,3cesou,Mark7A,3,Wed Jul 8 08:21:17 2015 UTC,"I have also worked in a lab at a big research university where a grad student handed a container full of mice and told me to kill them (I would guess that there's 30-50 in the plastic cage. I can feel the heat from the wiggling bodies). I was too much of a wuss to wring their necks so I used CO2 instead. The grad student let them overbred because they were too lazy to separate the males and females after they've bred. Also, I never want to see half-eaten baby mice in cages ever again.   I've also worked in a primate enrichment program. I think we could've done more but I don't think we were given the resources. I saw primates in small cages. I'm sure the cages are up to ""standard"" but when you think about how they live in groups, the ""standard"" is beyond inadequate. The majority of the primates are housed in windowless rooms. Some macaques and Capuchin are in rooms with windows. This is how animals start their abnormal behavior. It's hard to watch an intelligent creature attack their own limbs when they have phantom limb syndrome.   That's not to say animal model testing is not needed. I don't think we're quite there to simulate a mammalian body but I do think we could probably do less of it."

Documentaries,3cesou,Actually_Saradomin,10,Wed Jul 8 07:34:17 2015 UTC,"It's a complex issue. If you were to conclude that primates are worthy of moral consideration, then you can develop an argument that they have a right to life. If you reach that conclusion, then it really doesn't matter how many positive consequences these experiments have. It's obvious that human experimentation would have long term benefits, but we believe that is immoral for the same reason: an individual's right to life is not negated by the potential benefits that killing the individual may have.   Ultimately, this touches upon a subject important to bioethics: speciesism; i.e., discriminating against an individual being based solely on species membership. Philosophers who oppose speciesism argue that one's obligations to an individual is dependent solely on their morally relevant characteristics, and species membership is not morally relevant. There are entire books written about this issue, so it's tough to summarize.   Another thing to consider is that it may be more moral to cut spending on new medical research and spend the money instead on widely distributing already developed medical technologies to lower income areas across the globe. Meanwhile, we could also spend some of the money on developing alternatives to animal testing.  But, really, there's no easy answers when it comes to bioethics. Sometimes an idea can seen incredibly stupid when it's presented in one sentence. But when you elaborate on it, it can seem a lot more reasonable."

Without testing on live animals (I.e. complete biological systems) we wouldn't just ""slow"" down medical research, we would shut it down completely. It's simply not possible to go from research on cell cultures to clinical treatments. It's a matter of how treatments scale through more complex biological systems that require actual whole biological systems for research. Researching on live animals is so much more complex, difficult, expensive, time consuming, and stressful on researchers than research on non living animals. if researchers had the choice they would not use animals at all, but the truth is that there is no choice.

Documentaries,3cesou,SecretAg3nt,2,Tue Jul 7 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"For the record it is extremely hard to do testing in primates in the US, at least at a university. You have to be a scientist with a very impressive track record to even get a crack at having a few primates, and even then you have to provide strong scientific justification for why the research requires a primate model and detail how you plan to minimize pain and distress. Many of the major funding agencies right now are only awarding grants to the top 8-10% (that's probably generous, the real figure is likely lower). That figure would also be for all proposals coming in for a certain area, so for instance 8-10% of all people studying diabetes across all models, animals and human. Combine that with the fact that purchasing a single primate is going to cost around $10,000-$15,000 last I heard, and that housing costs will quickly surpass that figure, and you can bet a researcher with a primate wants to do everything they can to keep that animal happy. Happy healthy animals are necessary for running good experiments. I wont even get into all the costs associated with safety, experimental equipment, and so on. With all that said, I couldn't work with primates personally. I've been working with rats for 6 years and I'm burned out. I like animals too much to keep doing it. I'll clarify that by saying that I feel this way only because I don't feel I personally have what it takes to hack it in science.

I don't enjoy the thought of conducting experiments on animals (I would want to make it as relatively painless as possible) but, at the end of the day,  human life trumps an animal's. Everytime. It's really a damned if you do, even more damned if you don't situation. It's unfortunate that it sometimes requires an animal to suffer, but it's a cruel necessity for the advancement of biomedical sciences.   For those who are staunchly against animal testing: We could always cut out the middle-man and use you for our research trials."

Or those who are already sick.  Let me give you an example: a patient has terminal cancer. There is a potential treatment for that particular cancer. Give this new treatment to that patient. That patient is the one who's sick and is going to die so no need for animal testing.  The reason why we are testing on animals is because we want a cure ASAP. If we would all accept the idea that getting a cure for a disease is a slow process then there wouldn't be animal testing.
Documentaries,3cesou,GreedyR,0,Tue Jul 7 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"We are testing on animals because its much less unethical than testing on humans.

Documentaries,3cesou,The_Submentalist,2,Tue Jul 7 16:44:28 2015 UTC,What's so unethical about giving a potential cure to a human who needs it? Why should we consider this as human testing? Why shouldn't we accept the risk of being harmed by a potential cure?   Let's not forget that just because treatment works on animals doesn't means that it will work on humans and just because it was harmful on animals doesn't mean it's harmful on humans.  I personally am unsure about the whole issue. The are good arguments from both sides.
Documentaries,3cesou,GreedyR,2,Tue Jul 7 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"There are certainly good arguments from both sides, but from a purely scientific standpoint, animal testing is essential, due to potential side effects. And honestly, I think that a humans life is worth more than a monkeys, objectively, and that Is why I would support animal testing for the betterment of humans over human testing for the betterment of humans.  Your argument is valid, but we have to recognize that the rewards outweigh the risks. If we find that a cure causes severe Nausea in monkeys, we can safely assume that it will do the same in Humans, due to the immense similarities.

It's also correct that in vitro experiments are largely lacking compared to in vivo ones. There's not currently anyway to mimic the complex interactions and environments in a living organism in a petri disk. The chemical composition, interactions between organs and architecture (2-d in a Petri dish vs. 3-d in vivo) all make a huge difference and will affect the result.

Documentaries,3ci0dx,Weaby,5,Wed Jul 8 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say this is worth watching as someone who has seen like every North Korean documentary (that are in english or have subtitles in English at least. This follows the North Korean underground railroad that goes through China around back to South Korea.  For some reason China will actually deport North Koreans it finds back to their home country. Many countries refuse to deport people if they will face inhumane conditions when they get home. Obviously, that'll be the case here. I'm sure they're either killed or left to rot in a prison camp for the rest of their lives. I think death is for sure the best way to go in that case.  The Chinese exploit the shit out of North Koreans who sneak over the border because of this. They can basically imprison people under threat of reporting them to immigration and getting them deported. It sounds like a lot of North Korean women are forced into marriages or other even worse forms of human trafficking that I don't want to think about.  It's disgusting that China will deport North Koreans. What a shameful thing to do. You guys have like 1.5 billion people in your country, what's another few thousand escapees hanging out until they can get to South Korea? I'm sure none of the North Koreans want to stay in China. South Korea gives instant citizenship to any North Koreans who are able to make it into the country. Pretty sweet deal."
Documentaries,3ci0dx,rollerboogie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:41:09 2015 UTC,"I think it has a lot to do with their current political standing with North Korea, but I am in no way suggesting it makes the system set in place any less dispicable. It sickens me that the excuse they use to justify their actions is that they don't want to encourage any more people from attempting to escape. I cannot comprehend the idea of denying a person an opportunity to truly be alive even after they've been denied the absolute most basic human rights since the very day of his/her birth.  On a side note, I agree that what South Korea does is absolutely admirable. From sending balloons over the boarder with copies of The Interview attached to granting human beings citizenship. This video here initially piqued my curiosity on the subject and my interest hasn't simmered down quite yet. I don't expect it to anytime soon."

However, I do see the importance of culture and history. But are you willing to save  artifacts over human beings? I don't think so. The only way I see around this is if the people of that region are willing to risk their lives to save their culture and ancient monuments. This is a war the West must not get involved.

However, as someone studying history right now and planning on continuing my study of history and archeology in grad school, I think you don't understand the importance of preserving these artifacts.  What is left behind by ancient civilizations is the only way we can find out about our past. Before history started to get written down, it's basically impossible to understand ancient cultures and how they lived and operated. This is why people are working so hard to preserve all of it. And the groups that are destroying these sites and artifacts are causing serious damage to our ability to research and understand our ancient past. Many of these artifacts and sites are from the age when people first started forming civilizations; it is when humans first started becoming the way they are today.   I really hope that they find a way to stop these people before they do too much damage. Like I said before, as an aspiring historian/archeologist this makes me very sad."

Pretty obvious the filmmaker, Morgan Matthews, was in on the hoax at the end. He puts together this whole documentary to show how ridiculous and crazy these characters are and then basically throws himself in that same boat.  Great ploy to generate controversy for your upcoming doc and call your audience stupid at the same time.   Edit: Yeah, keep downvoting, but know that the cut on that dog's throat was very obviously done with a blade, and the fact that the kid came forward later and said he was in on it probably means Matthews was well aware that kid mutilated his dog just for the doc. That's pretty damn shitty if you ask me."

The camera angle that captures the ""bigfoot"" was perfect as Matthews was falling down, and the homeless kid has been interviewed post-filming and has even said they did multiple takes of that scene. Also the fact that Matthews still insists in interviews that he isn't sure if that encounter was actually bigfoot or not leads me to believe he was in on it. He wouldn't have a doubt in his mind it was all Dyer's doing, especially after spending all that time with him and seeing how whacked out he was. He even suspected him of hoaxing when the rotting ribs were found in his tent and Dyer said he saw a little girl in the woods."

Documentaries,3cccbh,trillest_sloot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:55:19 2015 UTC,"Idk man, I guess it depends on  how much you take. I used to take a lot quite frequently when it was cheap and easily available (was sold as methylone not MDMA). Even good MDMA gets pretty speedy when used like that.   I've seen the drug described as MDMA lite on forums when it first came out and I think that's a pretty good description. But still pretty close in effects.  I'm guessing that if you're buying ""molly"" that you live in the states and if so, the chances are that you have methylone. Look into the dark net markets if you want a safe and relatively risk free way to get good quality drugs.  Edit: If the effects last 8 hours from one dose its probably not MDMA or Methylone."
Documentaries,3cccbh,GandalfTheEnt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:42:59 2015 UTC,I only have that kind of buzzes an odd time lately. Should I put it down to pills being shit or my tolerance? Does doing it every week or two really make it really less effective?
Documentaries,3cccbh,A_Fart_Is_a_Telegram,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:07:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you are doing it every week or two you will sooner or later lose that love buzz that makes the drug so special.   Dose every 2-3 months and if you are redosing, take no more than half your original dose, no later than 2 hours after your original dose. Don't take more than 250 mg in a night (I find there are no more positive effects after 180-200).   Tolerance does not return to normal easily. You may have to wait years to get the full empathogenic effects back. For some it never returns.   If you take MDMA, try to wait 6 months and then take either MDA or bkMDMA (methylone). You might experience some of the magic you remember from your early usage. Try a small-ish dose (100-150mg) and maybe smoke a joint. Don't drink too much as this tends to dull the experience.   People don't seem to understand, MDMA is for SPECIAL OCCASIONS. It loses its magic if consumed too frequently. Frequent usage can also screw up your serotonin system and lead to depression later in life.  Please always do a ton of research before trying a new drug. I can't say I haven't abused MDMA but I am taking a long break at the moment to try and regain its more desirable effects."
Documentaries,3cccbh,GandalfTheEnt,2,Tue Jul 7 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting and I agree. I never really get a love buzz anyway. It's always just ""buzzed out of it"". And a few good times so buzzed you don't know whats going on. I got that a few weeks back and I think it's because I had actual MDMA, most other times I have a buzz but not always like that. And that big buzz was after taking stuff at the club hours before. I would love to get a testing kit because after watching this doc I really feel like bath salts are lurking in the pills here. For instance one pill a few weeks back made me think my friend had green hair and an orange face and I had to sit down. MDMA shouldn't cause this."
Documentaries,3cccbh,A_Fart_Is_a_Telegram,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:43:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry man. I misread your comment. I thought that you were saying that you no longer get a love Buzz from MDMA, which is pretty common amongst frequent users.   Since you are probably not getting MDMA, you can disregard my dosage/ use advice. It only really applies to seratonin based drugs (MDMA, MDA, and to a lesser extent methylone).  What you're getting is probably a dopamine acting stimulant (buzzy, no empathy). There are hundreds of these from caffeine to meth, but it's often something like 4-fma or 4-mmc or some cheap chemical from China.   If you are serious about taking  drugs, I would seriously advise you to use TOR to purchase them. It's not that hard to use and virtually risk free if you buy domestic.

With all the regulations that the industry has placed on itself for herb since '96 we have seen some positive changes for the products. That and it doesn't have any deadly (directly) consequences like overdosing as does pharmaceuticals or harder drugs."

Prior to selling to someone who I had not sold to before, I would give them about a 15 minute speech about what they were about to purchase.  I never once sold it as LSD, and was very adamant about it being a RC.  I even told them that in large doses it could kill them.  To only eat one the first time to know what it would do.  People who intentionally mislead others to make a profit are the lowest form of scum IMO.    I fully agree with the information here.  TEST TEST TEST.  When ever I would get new product in I would give a small sample to an acquaintance of mine who had access to proper equipment.  He was able to confirm what it was and somewhat the dosage (within 50ug) the tabs were.   I remember watching as the market changed what was acceptable as a minimum dosage.  I started with some 500ug blotter, which can still get you off but nothing out there.  But when I stopped messing with it, the standard was 1000ug(1mg).

Instead of simply paying taxes off to the government, each citizen is now charged with instructing how a portion of those tax dollars are invested back into the nation, via crowdfunding. Yes, you could choose to have your tax dollars invested into your own company. Yes, fraud would still be fraud, the honor system that we already largely rely upon.  World B: The middle class is small and shrinking. But if you have a really good idea and don't screw it up (or are smart/talented enough to have several) you might find yourself in a position to suddenly become extremely rich.

The ""self-made richest"" statistics are totally meaningless, since almost none of the people called ""self-made"" actually are; generally they are starting in the top 10% or so and making their way to the top 0.1%, virtually none of them come from the other 90%. The competition at the top is between the extremely rich and the ultra-rich, the rest of the population is stagnating.    The apologetics you're trying to push are cute, but they simply aren't true.

It depends on the platform you work with, robotic arms require ROS (robotic os), basically C++ in linux. Many commercial humanoid robots have their own IDE. But in the end it is mostly C++. Robot perception & navigation not only require solid programming skill but also a lot of maths.    If you don't know where to start, I suggest you start it as a hobby, get an Arduino or Raspberry Pi board, some motors, sensors & fool around with them. It will give you some ideas.

Maybe I'm just describing evolution, but afaik there is no evidence that would support my claim or the philosopher's regarding culture of cells.

Boondock saints is the movie you like to watch when you're maybe 13 or 14 because how ""edgy"" it is.  You look back retrospectively and see all the problems with it, at least that's how I see it."
Documentaries,3ccm9d,kyle_kyle_kyle_kyle,21,Thu Jul 9 18:05:07 2015 UTC,This documentary is wonderful and was only possible due to the ego and arrogance of Troy Duffy. It's a window into how sudden fame and success can truly bring out the worst in people. If you haven't watched it and are a fan of the Boondocks Saints do yourself a favor and watch this doc because it gives you the story behind the movie which is fascinating and almost tragic.   In my opinion The Boondocks Saints is not the great movie that many college freshman will try to convince you it is. It's alright but not groundbreaking or revolutionary or really that significant. I remember loving it when I was younger because it was graphic and unapologetic but as time has gone on I've realized just how stupid of a movie it really is. After watching this documentary it solidified in my mind how much I dislike the movie because of how much Troy Duffy I see in it. Normally I can separate my distaste for an artist and the work they do to have an objective opinion of their artwork. In this case however the movie isn't that good and the guy is a terrible human being.   Tl;dr: if you like the Boondock Saints and documentaries about people that make you want to punch your screen this is the flick for you.

Recently re watched it and i'm totally with you. A lot of the trite acting comes out in a big way, like the forced laughter and interactions with ancillary characters (fat woman at the butcher shop, reaction to bartender botching his one liners). The smart cop dumb cop interaction between Paul (Willem) and Greenly becomes so predictable you want to slap him when he jumps into the river dance around the corpses.   It really starts to become forced and on the nose when the saints turn themselves into the office after Greenly says ""good bye and good luck, thanks for coming out"" and the door swings open, and even after that the bar is raised even higher around the aura of the saints when they can speak 5 languages which is never mentioned anywhere else in the film and is never used other than in the interrogation room. Not even their father Il Duce speaks any other language.   The most interesting character is Rocco and I mean it. Not just his character but his acting as well. The cat scene is by far the most authentic part of that whole movie. and the cinematography when he says ""I killed your cat you cunt!"". That lead up to the cat, the cats death and resolution is the best part of the whole movie and always will be."

Documentaries,3ccksb,kryptobs2000,2,Tue Jul 7 01:47:08 2015 UTC,That his interpretation of the movie was the mother was crazy and manipulative. Essentially the view the sons have of the mother. I'm not sure if he was joking or just being an idiot.
Documentaries,3ccksb,calimiket,-12,Tue Jul 7 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how I feel about this, only about 30m in so far (I've seen it before, but don't remember it at all). I definitely think he had child porn, but it seems so fishy about the molestation thing how the stories just completely don't match up. I can see some people lying because they're embarrassed, saying it didn't happen, and some lying just to get him in trouble, but of all of the kids he taught they can't get a clear picture?   This will be probably be controversial, but please hear me out first, however I do not have a real problem with the mere possession or viewing of child porn so long as they do not contribute to the production of it, either directly or indirectly (such as paying for it or maybe even just contributing to ad revenue on a website if those exist).   My thought behind this is that pedos are probably just like gay people (or straight people); they are attracted to kids and there is nothing they can do to change that. As such some child porn already exists out there and viewing it, within reason, is not hurting anyone. The alternative is that these people have no outlet which I fear would lead to a greater desire to act on it in real life. I don't think child porn should be legal for that reason, but I don't think it should be viewed as a criminal issue either."
Documentaries,3ccksb,kryptobs2000,5,Wed Jul 8 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"So others have posted this as well. The director makes it appear like the stories don't match.

Documentaries,3ccksb,swimcool08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:00:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I was wondering if it was just the way it was edited. The main thing that made me say that though is there were a couple of people saying they had no negative experiences in the class. Then they interview a guy saying he was raped, punish raped, and described how kids were raped in the back room or wherever, but 'never molested in the class/main room.'   He then goes on to describe a game of 'leap frog' where the whole class stands in a line with their butts up and the father and son 'leap frog' over each of them and stick their penises in each butt. I just cannot believe that happened for so many reasons, not to mention he made a huge contradiction to what he just said (when called on it he said something like, 'oh that was just a game, I didn't consider that molestation' Whaaat?!).   It could just be that he was lying and the bigger picture was clear, but eh.. I dunno... just mentioning that I guess. It seemed like such a bizarre story to me and hard to believe. If it was anything like described I don't see how a family friend and multiple students would say the class was completely fine or even more so how a single kid would not come out and say something."
Documentaries,3ccksb,kryptobs2000,0,Tue Jul 7 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the leap frog story at all. It's so insane, I do think that guy was lying, he just seemed like a liar when he spoke.  I suspect he was one of the 'hypnotized' where people tell a kid enough times that something happened and suddenly the kid really has those memories out of thin air.   Probably things conflict in his memory and he doesn't understand why, that's why he seems like a liar, but who would lie about that.   Just my guess"

Documentaries,3ccksb,kryptobs2000,0,Wed Jul 8 04:57:16 2015 UTC,"Did you read what I said? I never justified going after children certainly, just that I don't think it should be criminal to possess or view child porn so long as you're not contributing to the production of it. These people have these desires regardless and they are not going to go away. I don't think child porn should be legalized as that would encourage the production of it, I don't think existing child porn should even be legal because it's still victimizing the child photographed regardless if the damage has already been done, but in the same vein the person viewing it is not inherently bringing any harm to the child or anyone else and as such I don't feel they should be punished, it's not a criminal issue until you cross the line to contributing harm to children, prior to that it should be, imo, viewed as solely a mental health problem."

It contributes and is the viewing of the abuse of a child. It is something you should fight. Its creating demand for something. And in his time, it's clear he paid for it which is becoming part of the crime by supporting the criminal.  I am fairly liberal on this issue and I think we should get more help for pedophiles and stigmatize it less so they can get help. I even would argue for a safe method of hentai or simulated porn to aid in therapy or reducing urges to act. Verdict is out on whether they hurts or helps.   But it is still 1000% wrong to watch/have child porn. It is not a victimless crime."

Compared to marijuana for instance it's still illegal to possess marijuana when it's decriminalized, it's just no longer a felony but a misdemeanor. So in my system child porn is still illegal, but the mere possession of it is not criminal. The production, maybe even buying it (whether if only for 5$ or funding a movie) would be criminal and punishable.   Ideally, and I haven't worked this all out, but if someone is caught with child porn on their computer and there is no reasonable belief or suspicion that they produced it or were involved with harming children (maybe run an investigation to find out) the person will have their porn wiped/confiscated or w/e and be offered some type of therapy or treatment (what can we really do to help? I'm not sure)."

He lets you draw your own conclusions about who is lying and who is telling the truth. By the time it was over, I had concluded that the father had sexually molested his younger brother and probably all of his sons. It is interesting that the middle son, Seth, refused to be interviewed. I suspect, that like his mother, he is trying to somehow have a life. As to whether or not Jesse molested anybody is a question I don't know the answer to and I rather suspect Andrew Jarecki doesn't either. The father confesses that he molested two boys at their lake cottage. Did he molest boys in the basement......I kinda think so. I believe Jesse's lawyer's version of his conversations with the father in prison and his conversation with Jesse about whether to plead guilty or not. I think he would have taken this to trial and done be best job possible The person I feel sorriest for is the Mother. She was vilified by her sons. The people I feel least sorry for are the Father and the oldest son, David. These guys are totally creepy.....both of them.

Documentaries,3cdsd6,Ewannnn,4,Tue Jul 7 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"I swear with this Greece thing I have no idea where i stand. I know from my graduate poli sci classes, that its proven austerity doesnt work, it makes everything worse and causes a long term recession. However, I have trouble with giving Greece another bailout, given that they have had two, and seem to be in the same position over again. Maybe I just dont understand enough, but something seems very wrong, when a country needs three multi-billion dollar bailouts in this short of a time, all while saying they are cutting spending. Maybe they do need to be on their own currency, to allow them to have monetary and fiscal policy control. Because it seems right now, having them tied to stronger economies is not helping."
Documentaries,3cdsd6,swimcool08,5,Tue Jul 7 03:57:15 2015 UTC,"I just think the greek people have been completely unrealisitc, and i fear that they believe that exiting the Euro means they go back to business as usual. Do most of them realize how bad of a position they are in? Either way they are going to be in a very problematic position.  My fear stems from them, for some reason, hating the same banks that allowed them to have the good times. They are hating the people that took a giant risk to save their country twice before. It seems like they are completely out of touch. But i guess the sudden wakeup will force them to realize the shit they are in.   Honestly Austerity is bad, most of the time. The problem with Greece is that they have problems doing even the most basic governmental tasks. They have rampant corruption, problems collecting taxes, and benefits that are completely bonkers.  Welfare is not always a definitive good thing. It's not a linear function. It's more of a second order function. It's good in the beginning, but at some point it drops off and becomes bad again.  EDIT: So i just started watching this. My fear seems justified. The pensioners are saying ""shame on them"" when if fact it was their generation that spend all the money without constructing a proper government and welfare system. It's the classic political problem of the voting public seeing themselves as separate from the governing class. A democracy means that the people are the government. If something goes wrong, then it's just as much your fault as everyone else.  In this case it might get better, but it first has to get a whole lot worse. Democracies aren't good at getting past those local maximums."
Documentaries,3cdsd6,Beaverman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"agreed. I think many are not fully realizing the situation. i agree that the loans should not have been due this soon, and that the terms the country are in, are dire but there is no other option. i dont want austerity to be continued, but there is something very very wrong with the system, if by now they have to be bailed out yet again for running out of money."
Documentaries,3cdsd6,swimcool08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"And before that they did the currency swap with Goldman to hide 2.8 billion dollars of debt.  I'm just really happy I'm not Greek. It's not going to be fun waking up one day suddenly living in a country with an unstable economy. A place where even in the bank your money can be devalued from one day to the next.  I do believe their reluctance to do anything at all is going to harm them in the long run. My real fear is that even with a new currency they are going to continue their bad practices.  It's going to be interesting to follow it as it develops. It's something that has never happened before, hell you can't formally even exit the Euro."
Documentaries,3cdsd6,Beaverman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"so to me the scary part, is what this is going to do to the global economy. right now china is already in a stock market plunge, and adding in this, im scared we will go into another really big recession and economic crisis."
Documentaries,3cdsd6,swimcool08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"That's also very interesting.  I think most of the debt is help by the troika, so private banks should have very little exposure. Additionally Most of that debt is help by the EU fund (323B Euro). That's pretty much a drop in the bucket for Europe.  I'd imagine it would cause some uncertainty in the market, it will probably drop for a while. However, i doubt we will see a spiral like the one in 2008. There the whole problem was that the banks were too big to fail. Greece really isn't too big to fail in the global economy (It's a tiny economy).  I'm not an economic analyst though, so i look forward to finding out."
Documentaries,3cdsd6,Beaverman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"ah so my worry is not that greece is too big to fail. but instead that greece is going to drive down the value of the Euro. if the euro devaluates it could bring down the larger economies within europe, and ripple around the world. Basically i see this, as proving that the Euro could be in trouble, or at least that it has countries involved that should not be, thus the vulture of hedge funds are going to try to drive down its price as much as possible to make money."
Documentaries,3cdsd6,swimcool08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:40:22 2015 UTC,"That is of course a real worry. There are some countries that are in almost as bad a shame as Greece, countries like Italy, Portugal, and Ireland could be in trouble at some point. I haven't considered that too much, for some reason I never accounted for investment banks and speculation.  I don't know if the investment banks are daring enough to do that. Who would bail them out in that case?"
Documentaries,3cdsd6,Beaverman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"well, if 2008 taught us anything,(at least in the US), banks only got bigger than they were before the bailouts. so somehow the govt would have to bail out the banks or risk a horrible catastrophe"
Documentaries,3cdsd6,swimcool08,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"im with you on this. I get conflicting explanations, but at the end of the day, something is wrong with Greece if they require a bailout for the 3rd time.  anyone have a dummys guide to the greek financial crisis?"
Documentaries,3cdsd6,stinkjel,2,Tue Jul 7 09:49:56 2015 UTC,"anyone have a dummys guide to the greek financial crisis?   The basics are at khanacademy I highly recommend all the banking series. They're great.  Then once you get the basics, you HAVE to put things into political, structural perspective. The very best I've seen do that recently is Mark Blyth in his lecture Austerity and the Politics of Money  Now, let me comment on the documentary we watched.   I don't think it's absolutely bad. The people you see are real, I met a lot like them, (and a lot of others who didn't make it on TV) They might not be a representative sample of the greek population, but they're the people you might meet yourself if you go there. The problem is, they can't explain the crisis to you; they ARE the crisis, because they are living in it. So the sensible thing to do would be to show the conflicted emotions, the hardships, and investigate into what happened. To my great regret, they don't. Instead, they use the confusion, the amalgams, the contradictions and emotions to sell you a narrative you can't really disagree with, since it's the greeks you were shown on screen speaking. The BBC show you no infographics, nothing about the political landscape besides Syriza, no economics, no data :(    It's really tempting to call that propaganda... I have to admit, they just probably don't know better, but it makes me think of the kind of shit you see on r/hailcorporate"

When the police run into an unlicensed business that has direct connections with gang members in a high gang-violence area, do you really think they would do anything but shut the business down as quickly as possible? You have to run your programs within the confines of the law and be conscientious of how it will appear to police whose goal is to prevent crime first and foremost.    That being said, I do understand how frustrating this must feel to the people running it, they obviously had good intentions. I also do agree that the sort of zero tolerance policy I mentioned before is not necessarily the optimal solution in every case and community policing and a little more knowledge of the goals of this place by the police would have made a big difference in preventing this from happening."

Documentaries,3c8ypo,Necrothus,7,Mon Jul 6 11:41:44 2015 UTC,"The question at hand isn't ""did he have licenses"", it is ""do the police have a right to apply asset forfeiture law when dealing with an unlicensed neighborhood co-op"", to which the answer is ""no, this is a civil case, not a criminal case"".  That's the crux of this issue: the line between civil ordinance case versus criminal activity case.  The police are not a civil law application force, they are strictly for serving the city and protecting its citizens from criminal law breaches.  When we use them in civil matters, we end up with these kinds of overreach where they seize monies that they have no business seizing.  As for your assertion that the co-op had ""connections with gang members"", so does the corner store that sells them cigarettes, but there is no criminal law being broken to sell a known gang member a product.  So too does the DMV that issued a known gang member a license to drive a vehicle, but there is no police force seizing state dollars because of the DMV working closely with known gang members who gasp committed drivebys with that license!  The simple fact is, there is no precedent which allows the police force to enforce civil statutes and apply asset forfeiture because of ""connections with gang members"" in some illusory manner where there is no proof that an illegal activity happened.  Sadly, until the Supreme Court resolves this issue, we will continue to have police forces seizing money illegally  without a person being convicted of a crime.  To your point that ""a little more knowledge of the goals of this place by the police would have made a big difference in preventing this from happening"", I believe this is a naïve statement hoping that the police would not have shown such a heavy handed response if they had only KNOWN about the tough work of the owner.  I believe they fully knew what was going on but painted a narrative of ""gang relations"" to apply asset forfeiture law to this because they know there is currently no burden of proof tied to these asset forfeitures.  It's free money if you can use the right words and cite the right statutes, all without conviction in a court of law.  Follow the money.  That maxim always works."
Documentaries,3c8ypo,WTFppl,14,Mon Jul 6 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, the police were not there because of business related issues. The officer even says the reason on the video.   do you really think they would do anything but shut the business down as quickly as possible?   There is a Federal Law called ""due process"", it's part of our countries extensive law history; do you think that shouldn't apply to who ever a police officer deems is not worthy of due process? Because what you just did here was provide and unlawful excuse for depriving ""due process"".  And you got 232 upvotes for you statement of depriving ""due process""...  Sickening."

If a person attempts to run a business for the public and they don't follow proper building and fire safety codes they will be shut down. It doesn't matter what the business is. Small scale daycares run out of houses get busted for violating this type of thing all the time.  If you're going to offer a service to the public you have to follow building and fire codes. You have to. It isn't optional. Failing to do so is considered a danger to the public.  The current practice of police departments straight up stealing money from people is bullshit however. That is incredibly frustrating. The police often use any infraction no matter how minor (and often use suspicion alone) to take personal property from people. That is total bullshit.  But remember people. If you're gonna offer a public good, even out of your personal house, you have to follow building and life safety codes."
Documentaries,3c8ypo,CapsUnlocker,39,Mon Jul 6 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"Suspected fire code violation isn't the reason the police came. Police do not inspect for fire code compliance and they certainly do not raid and execute civil forfeiture and then evict someone based on fire code violations.  The only proof of any violation of fire codes is that a blog says ""and didn't even have a plan to follow things like fire code."" That doesn't specifically mean that he had fire code violations and this the source is suspect? Do they have any experience with NFPA and local ordinance codes? Is he a building inspector? We don't know and he certainly isn't giving the context that he witnessed violations, only that Andy wasn't specifically planning on  worrying about whether he was or wasn't following any fire code provisions.  What about the business license? Do you think if a business if found operating without a business license that police immediately should take possession of property and evict the owner? NO. They must be given written notice and time to correct the violation.  Whatever though, feel free to hammer in context to a sourced blog to push your opinion home.  TL;DR: This had nothing to do with fire codes and an unlicensed business. Proof hasn't been provided as such anyway."
Documentaries,3c8ypo,MoreWhiskeyPls,4,Mon Jul 6 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"Fire marshal's deal with those sorts of issues. Now if the fire marshal shows up and deems there to be an issue, police can come back and remove people.  With that being said, cops can and do assist with evictions. Illegal businesses/daycares etc are their jurisdictions. The line is blurry many times, but that's usually because people panic and vote for/enact legislation without realizing the ramifications. So an unlicensed daycare has a gas leak and a bunch of kids die, it then becomes illegal to look after a bunch of kids and give them a positive outlet without paying/jumping through hoops for the city/state. It's complicated.  The cop's attitude though rubs me all wrong."
Documentaries,3c8ypo,CapsUnlocker,3,Mon Jul 6 07:28:03 2015 UTC,"Cops assist in actual evictions, yes. Those are where tenants are escorted off of the premises, similar to the end. That may have been the case as previous to that Andy said they were trying to work something out with the landlord before the next day. It may have even been that they were behind on their rent by a month or some sort of deadline and when police raided the building, the landlord just thought it was too much drama and kicked them to the curb. We don't know.  HOWEVER, evictions are not raids. That isn't what happened. Fire Marshals wouldn't be kicking in doors, taking money, throwing a dart board on a pool table and so-on.  Saying all of that, maybe, just maybe there was a lot that lead up to that day. It is speculation. The only evidence that was being tossed out there was a statement on a blog from the video's creator with no real context. The blog didn't even state that they had violations or that there was some sort of history there. Even worse, the video creator stated at the end of his video that he has seen the same occurrences to similar places in the neighborhood. But what does he know, right? He's just the guy that wrote the blog that barely mentioned the lack of a business license and Andy's lack of planning/caring/whatever of possible fire code issues that the statement I was replying to was referring to."

To give an example: There was a head on collision near me recently that resulted in both parents dying leaving 2 very young toddlers without parents. The family set up a gofundme account and local media ate up the tragic story. One child likely won't make it, the daughter is broken but ok. The family put up youtube videos with lots of tears and asking for assistance. From first and second hand knowledge, I know the family is only after money as they're all very much into drugs (including the now deceased parents.) No one will touch the 2 year old as she is accused of being the daughter of another man. While she cries for attention, they discuss who's getting what.  Simply put, rarely do we get the actual story on these things until well after the public's attention has moved on. So until we get factual information, it is only speculation.

This isn't an issue of ""a few bad apples."" This is how government functions. When you consent to giving someone power over you, you shouldn't be surprised when they take advantage of you and look out for themselves. This isn't just directly as police, but throughout government at every level. It has the power to tell you what to do by force at the end of a gun. If you resist, you may be murdered, kidnapped and thrown in a cage, and/or simply extorted for money.  The SCOTUS has ruled numerous times that the police have no obligation to protect you or your property. They are LAW ENFORCEMENT officers, not protectors of the citizenry. Don't be fooled.

The total dollar value of civil asset forfeitures was actually higher than the total dollar loss attributed to petty theft in the United States last year.   Where are you getting that from? I can't find any statistics anywhere about petty theft, neither it's total nor it's relation to civil asset forfeiture. What I did find was FBI statistics on:    Larceny-theft: estimated $7.6 billion;  Burglary: estimated $4.5 billion; and Robbery: estimated $404 million;   Once again, I'm not condoning civil asset forfeiture. That the amount is greater than $0 is a national travesty and a violation of the principles of this nation. On that point we both agree.

Documentaries,3c8ypo,Gingrich2016,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:25:35 2015 UTC,"It makes sense for civil asset forfeitures to be valued higher than petty thefts. Asset forfeiture is designed to target major drug dealers, while petty theft only includes stolen goods valued below $400. Consider a cocaine dealer who has $10,000 seized. It would take a minimum of 26 petty thefts (<$399 each) to net the same value. Cops are seizing cars, planes, and boats while petty thieves are running off with wallets, packs of gum, and cell phones, so in reality there are probably dozens or hundreds of petty thefts per every one asset forfeiture. The fact that one is higher than the other does not indicate wrong-doing on the part of police.   I am not sure how I feel about this issue. The lack of oversight does not sit well with me, but the government does need a mechanism to seize ill-gotten property in cases where criminals skip trial or where the owners are complicit in a crime (i.e. a drug cartel owning a plane but only the pilot being charged). I wish I could find an even-handed source of information about this topic."

I don't think there is, or ever would be, much resistance to the concept of impoundment. But in the absence of formal charges, and in the case of trials that result in not guilty verdicts (and perhaps plea bargains, situationally), there should be an absolute requirement to return impounded goods and money.  It's the whole disconnect between seized goods and any subsequent legal process that is the most disconcerting to me."

The former Oxnard police officer who recently left the department said he saw the tattoos on the officers. He made a drawing of what the “shooting” tattoo looks like. He said the tattoos were probably purchased from a tattoo shop in Port Hueneme because that is where Oxnard officers go to get tattooed. The former Oxnard police officer also provided the names of seven Oxnard officers and two retired officers who allegedly had the tattoos. The nine names also included two officers who are currently commanders at the Oxnard Police Department. One is a watch commander.   The former Oxnard officer told American Justice that if smoke is added to the tattoo, coming out of the barrel, then the shooting was fatal.

Or I think it depends on the person. I've been taking an SSRI for a while and it's made a world of difference in my life. I know it's not a placebo effect. I know it's not my mind playing games with me. I went into this not expecting it to work. I expected it to not help me at all and for there to be no change.   I've never felt like a zombie. I've never felt like it made me not want to do things. I've had zero problem with my sex drive. I'm sure that there are some people who have problems. But it's not everyone. I know several people who are on the same drug and none of them have had any issues."
Documentaries,3c6zhs,WelcomePlayer1,162,Sun Jul 5 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah they definately work for a lot of people, but are also very bad for others.  I've tried 5 different SSRI prescriptions and they've all made me feel worse. I completely flatline, feel nothing emotionally, can't get erections and do some questionable things without realising until after (judgment severely impaired).  Then you hear about all these shocking stories of suicide/homicide. Doctors need to warn their patients more and probably book them for check-ups often early in the process to make sure they're feeling ok. Then when patients come off them they get nasty withdrawal effects.  SSRIs are life saving for some people, and devastating for others. 5-HTP and other chemicals have been more beneficial for me."
Documentaries,3c6zhs,altF4core,14,Sun Jul 5 16:15:21 2015 UTC,Your doc is supposed to prescribe lower doses/less often so you don't go through withdrawals. I spent 6 months reducing how often I took mine and was totally fine

Documentaries,3c6zhs,luxdesigns,5,Sun Jul 5 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"Doctors need to warn their patients more and probably book them for check-ups often early in the process to make sure they're feeling ok.    That is entirely what they are supposed to do with new patients. The American Psychiatric Association makes this recommendation very clear.  Also, pharmacists are supposed to give patients the PI insert sheets with the large black box warning labels.   Then when patients come off them they get nasty withdrawal effects.   There are ways to minimize these withdrawal effects. Indeed, it is inadvisable to quit 'cold turkey' and typically SNRIs and SSRIs with the major withdrawal syndromes are slowly tapered off while a long-acting SSRI (such as fluoxetine) is administered.   5-HTP and other chemicals have been more beneficial for me.   The problem with this is the regularity and potency of these supplements. There are already huge variances allowed for generic drugs vs brand drugs; the variances are even greater for over-the-counter supplements. They cannot be relied upon for first-line pharma therapy because of the unreliability of proper dosing."
Documentaries,3c6zhs,luxdesigns,25,Sun Jul 5 21:18:17 2015 UTC,"I hope you were lucky enough to get your erections and sex drive back.  I and many others were not so lucky.    My experience with SSRIs left me with a kind of permanent sexual dysfunction.  I can still get erections if I try hard, but my sexual desire is like 10% what it used to be before the drug.  My genitals still feel numb to pleasure even years later.  This condition is called PSSD (Post SSRI sexual dysfunction) and its a bit more common than many realize.  Its even worse when on the SSRI though.    Which reminds me, my buddy is on an SSRI and last year his girlfriend of 2 years broke up with him because he basically stopped having sex with her.  I know this because she contacted me about him as she thought he was cheating on her, but I knew he wasn't.  He just didn't care about sex anymore.  Boy do I know that feeling -_-."
Documentaries,3c6zhs,altF4core,14,Sun Jul 5 17:55:35 2015 UTC,I recommend reporting your persistent SNRI sexual dysfunction to RxISK.org.  They are building a database of reports from people who got permanent sexual dysfunction from SSRI/SNRI antidepressants and among other prescriptions.  Hopefully this will help in the future so there could be a warning for a chance of permanent sexual dysfunction on the drug's info sheet.

Documentaries,3c6zhs,nwo_platinum_member,5,Sun Jul 5 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"From my understanding from anecdotal evidence, SSRIs are harder on the male sex drive. I'm female and I've been on lexapro for a year. It's been a life saver for me since I was having crippling panic attacks and depression. My sex drive is lower but it's not horrible. I feel like for men it can be really bad. My doctor told me when he prescribed it to me to let him know ASAP if I felt a bizarre change in behavior or felt like harming myself or others. I don't think it's a common side effect but one to always be cautious about."

Documentaries,3c6zhs,dollpartsss,5,Sun Jul 5 18:55:42 2015 UTC,Yea you're loaded full of dopamine 24/7 now. You've got to think about the long term side effects on your heart and brain when you're dealing with amphetamines though.
Documentaries,3c6zhs,forestcollector,6,Sun Jul 5 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"Generally if you're taking adderall your dopamine levels are decreased and the drug facilitates a more functional mind state. The word choice behind saying that he's being pumped with dopamine makes it sound like it's excessive or unnecessary.  Perhaps not your intention, but my observation of it.   In regards to long term effects, you weigh the realities of being able to function vs the health risks down the line, this of course is applicable to large variety of drugs for mental disorders.  Sometimes there really isn't even a choice."
Documentaries,3c6zhs,PorkBrosnan,2,Sun Jul 5 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"Generally if you're taking adderall your dopamine levels are decreased   The theory with ADHD is that there is insufficient dopamine activity in a specific part of the brain. The problem with drugs is that you can't chose which part of the brain they get deposited. When you take Adderall it may even out activity in that part of the brain that is missing it, but it causes excessive dopamine activity in every other part.  Amphetamines are not good treatments for either depression or anxiety due to various risks and long-term problems associated with their use."

My doctors never once mentioned the possibility of lingering effects, just randomly threw medications at me it seemed, and frankly they didn't seem to know jack shit about the medication they were prescribing.   After several years of trying to treat this, not having a single medication not make things worse, and having woefully inadequate access to healthcare, I'm done.

Documentaries,3c6zhs,Eswyft,4,Sun Jul 5 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the same for me. I started SSRIs when I was 15, because I was depressed about having unrequited romantic feelings. For the past 11 years after that, I've had a really low sex drive, difficulty becoming/staying erect, and numbness/anhedonia. I've been off the SSRIs for a few years now (2?), and it hasn't gotten better. I force myself to go through the motions once or twice a month for ""prostate health"", but there isn't any pleasurable feeling.  I guess now I don't have to worry about unrequited romance now, though. I've avoided putting myself out there in the dating field because I'm afraid I'll meet someone I really like, who likes me back, and then it doesn't work out because my sex drive and performance are broken. I'd be crushed if that happens, so I don't date at all."

I'm going to assume you're just not relating the entire thing, because being depressed isn't a result of something like that, that issue could compound it for sure though.   If that is the entire story you had a really shitty doctor and I'm sorry."
Documentaries,3c6zhs,motorbikebeat,30,Sun Jul 5 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint about SSRI's is that drs act like you just need to keep trying one until it works and worse still they ignore your life problems. I have chronic pain, I'm disabled/handicapped (not legally, have not applied nor do I feel a need to). It literally hurts to play a videogame or something, I get tired quickly and have to take a break not to mention doing actual work, which I still do I just take a lot of breaks. No matter how many ssri's, snris, or w/e I try they're not going to work, my life is rather shitty.   Now my problem may or may not have a solution, but a lot of peoples do. Most people are not depressed b/c there is something wrong with their brain, they're depressed because they don't have a job, friends, w/e. Some people cannot go out and get those things due to their depression in which case an antidepressant might help, but a lot of them simply do not have the means to do so for one reason or another and you can't medicate your way into a better local economy or something. Of course it costs 20c to produce a months worth of antidepressants and they make 10$ profit on it where as it takes thought, time, and effort to create social programs that actually help people and no one wants to pay for that."

I had no one to lend me money. I had to drop out of college, and move cross country to a place I hated from a place I loved, and live with my abusive Mom.  I took so many different medications, listening to my psychiatrist, desperately wanting to get better for years, until one of them, Luvox, gave me Serotonin Syndrome. I had a seizure and pissed myself in front of my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. Romantic.  I had to stop taking all of my medications. Subsequently, my insurance finally agreed to pay for therapy, where I realized my feelings and depression were normal for my situation. There wasn't anything wrong with me. Of course I was depressed. No one stopped for one second to say, ""Hey, your feelings are normal for the situation you are in"". Instead they immediately started throwing medication at me.  I'm not saying medication doesn't help people, but for me it was completely wrong. Therapy was the right solution, and it wasn't available to me until an SSRI almost killed me."

Just like giving someone pain medication for a broken leg is not denying that pain is the normal response in that situation.  Depression can often be a hole, and if its a short-term situation, then there isn't a need for SSRIs. If however you are in a long-term situation or the depression effects you drastically, then SSRIs are there to help.   That's the idea anyways."

I was in a very similar situation to /u/motorbikebeat and I too had a negative reaction to SSRIs.    The system of diagnosis and prescription is currently terrible and that's the point.  Yes they may work for some, but that's not the point.  We know SSRIs CAN work, but what about when they don't.  They are currently treated like a panacea cure in depression treatment.  They are not at all.   I was literally sent to a pyschologist who talked to me for 10 minutes and prescribed an SSRI of which he had posters and brochures all over his office.  I was told take this pill and we will give you a second chance.   That is just an example of how shittily the prescription of SSRIs is often handled in the treatment of depression."

Didn't take my insurance at the time, so she let me pay the 15-min session price for a 1-hour session, actually talked to me about the side effects, asked my concerns, always made time for last-minute appointments or texts if there was an emergency, etc. It was great.    Moved out of state a few years ago, and she's definitely high on the list of things I miss the most.

Here's what the study says:  Taking amino acid precursors (like 5-htp or l-dopa) alone won't work, and can actually hurt by facilitating the depletion of other centrally acting monoamines (like serotonin or dopamine) or precursors.  In particular 5-htp depletes dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.  Reason cited: synthesis of monoamines from different precursors can be catalyzed by the same enzyme. If one is dominant, the synthesis of the others are blocked.  However, when used in a correctly balanced combination of amino acid precursors, this is no longer a problem and the supplements can be effective in rebalancing to make up for deficiencies. For example, you might want to take a balance of 5-htp, l-dopa, and l-tyrosine. But the optimal dosing values vary wildly from person to person, so there is not an easy answer.  Of course, adding on to this, the idea that depression is simply a serotonin deficit is ridiculous, which is noted in the video. Even if 5-htp did directly increase serotonin levels with no strings attached, it still wouldn't necessarily be a cure for or even help with depression.

This is not realistic when you are dealing with people who have debilitating psychiatric illnesses. As a result it has come to many PCPs in my area initiating psychiatric medications. SSRIs are at the top of the list of psychiatric medications I prescribe in terms of frequency prescribed. I personally have sorted through numerous psychiatric literature and follow my patients VERY carefully due to the potential for serious side effects. I do the following to attempt to identify when people are having a bad reaction - I bring them back 1 week after initiation then bring them back at 1 month and give no refills until the 1 month mark. If necessary I call them at home to assess how well they are. I also screen very carefully to figure out if the issue is bipolar disorder versus a true MDD. SSRIs when prescribed in Bipolar disorder can cause a manic phase which can end in homicidal or suicidal intent/action. Lastly, I do inform them of potential side effects and provide a ""game plan"" if they are feeling suicidal/homicidal. Thankfully because of this careful followup I have on a few occasions recognized issues and have stopped treatment without any serious negative outcomes (knock on wood).

The worst part of SSRI's is the withdrawal. Your mileage may vary.     I get the impression that the people who think SSRI's are pure evil have not tried any of the heavier psych meds on the market.  Try Risperdal or Geodon and tell me again how horrible SSRI's are."

I think its the fact that we are dealing with a disease, depression, which doesnt have a concrete cause, and already puts ppl into a pretty dark place. If the medicine can have side effects or paradoxical reactions, meaning it does the opposite of what it should, then that makes the dark place worse.   This is why you need to have a firm relationship with your doctor when taking them and be fully willing to relate your symptoms. If not, you cannot blame them for bad side effects."

Some have very negative reactions however and doctors don't do enough to follow up and identify those people.  For example, antidepressants significantly increase overall suicidality.  That's fact  and the FDA requires this black box warning.  My own experience with SNRIs is quite negative.  They increase suicidal thinking, cause thoughts about harming others, make me extremely agitated and irritable, cause racing thoughts and hyperactivity, increase anxiety and cause insomnia.  Obviously, I shouldn't take SNRIs.  Please don't misunderstand me.  I'm not saying SSRI/SNRIs are a problem.  It's the individual patient's reaction that is the problem.  SSRI/SNRIs are useful for many people but family doctors who prescribe these medications need to do a more thorough job of screening patients who react negatively to treatment."

Expand the group now to include your friends - size of say, 30 - still no ill effects. Entirely believable, entirely true. What happens when we turn that number up to 100, though? 1,000?  My guess is that some people are internally organized in such a way that their inhibitions - everything from not being rude, to violence - are in the not-expressed category. SSRI's loosen you up, switching not-expressed to expressed. Are those people wrong for that? No - they couldn't possibly imagine that this drug would have this effect on them. Are these people lying? No - but if your net is too small (you+friends) you may never encounter them. Your experience is valuable, but it's not enough for a full analysis."

I don't fall into spirals I can't control.  Only negative side effect is that my clitoris is less sensitive, but I've adjusted to that and sex is still awesome.  The SSRIs (I call them my ""srees"", rhyming with trees) have been really essential for me to get to a point where I can recognize what's happening to me and work through my issues in therapy.  It's a relatively small portion of people that benefit.  For what I take (celexa) 50% of people report improvement compared 30% who'd report improvement from a placebo.  But head meds are just really hard, you have to try a few until you find what's going to help.

I think the thing was I should've been depressed. If your life sucks and you never go out then why would you be happy. I just had a normal mental state for how I lived. I think a lot of people take SSRIs for the wrong reason like that.  I'm sure they work great, but I'm a pretty average guy and they were a nightmare for me.

Documentaries,3c6zhs,saxybandgeek1,4,Mon Jul 6 03:19:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was put on Zoloft recently and had a polar opposite effect.  To elaborate a little bit, about 6 years ago I was baker acted for 10 days after a failed suicide attempt. After diagnosis, I was told I suffered bipolar II, borderline personality disorder, PTSD, manic depressant, as well as ADD and an insomniac. I was well OVER medicated on five different prescriptions, lost over 40 pounds (already having anorexia nervous a, they'd prescribed the highest dose of adderall, some klonopin, celexa for depression, depakote for mania and ambien for sleeplessness). I felt it was more circumstantial depression, as I haven't had the greatest life, but I'm the type to power through with a smile. Making others smile is my gift and the only true medicine I have.  Anyways, I gave birth to my first and only child and have suffered depression since (and before even being pregnant as well).   So, I really wasn't a fan of medication, but I had realized my lack of motivation, my loss of passions and ambitions began to effect others around me. I was okay with it effecting myself, because I've dealt with it forever anyways.   That being said, I went back to my primary care physician and asked what I could take while breastfeeding so she prescribed me Zoloft. The effects I had were the opposite of a normal person. I suffered bruxism, extraordinarily high anxiety to the point of not being able to speak or breathe constantly for the three days that I took it. I couldn't even stay at work ( at the time I was a seller in a call center). She immediately took me off and offered Valium and told me to stop breastfeeding immediately. Which I did and continued to pump, because breastfeeding in itself is therapeutic. I tried another medication after Zoloft was out of my system with the same result.  Had I taken it any longer, I would have killed myself.  I never think like that, for what matters most is my daughter. I will not put her through what my mother did to me. I need to stay strong, level-headed and logical and not cry and freak out the way my mom did to me at ages earlier than 8. I bore my mothers issues at such a young age, that I developed my own issues and methods to try and cope.   Needless to say, I am still depressed, but trying to find alternatives like magnesium or vitamin b. Or any vitamins in general until I am done breastfeeding. Then I would like to try Saint Johns Wart. If that does not work and I am in a situation where I am financially capable (I currently am not, I have a job that I work ten hours a week while I go to school for my AA), I'd like to see a specialist in psychiatry, but only after I go see a cognitive therapist.   I feel that perhaps sometimes depression is deep seated from a past experience, but I can't dig that shit out myself. So here's to hoping.  And if anyone else is suffering, I am a very good ear. I love to listen and I empathize well. You are never alone in suffering, no matter how much you feel like you are."
Documentaries,3c6zhs,parttimehuman2,3,Mon Jul 6 03:33:35 2015 UTC,"Your story is remarkably similar to my own. My mom has/had a lot of problems that were made to be my problems at a very young age. I was the adult in that relationship even as a child. It was seriously awful. No stability,  lots of fear, and way too much responsibility at a young age took its toll. I was coping with a lot and doing it poorly because I had no role model to show me how to cope properly and also ended up with an eating disorder and self-harm issues. Therapy has helped tremendously and helped me realize that part of the reason I was struggling because I never learned healthy coping mechanisms. No adult had ever showed me the right way to react to life. My mom reacted by drinking, over medicating herself, running from things, sleeping all of the time, etc. Not healthy at all. All I knew was that I didn't want to cope the way she did so I dealt with it differently, but still not the right way. So I've done a lot of work on that and am much, much better than I was.

The whole scientific argument against SSRI's is that they arguably have no effect whatsoever, and that people who do experience an effect number in equal quantity as those taking a placebo.   None the less, documentaries like this are not useful for this subreddit as they promote anti-science and anti-medicine beliefs, leading ultimately to the idea that medical/psychiatric practice is for the purpose of mind control and altering of thought/behaviour.

SSRIs have done far more good than bad, and this sort of documentary has very little basis in concrete science, whereas the efficacy of SSRIs does.   Of course, people in this thread have, and no doubt will continue to point out all the scary side effects drug companies must warn consumers about, but I believe this is a weak argument at best. Even the most threatening of these, suicidal ideation, is not confirmed, and scientific opinion is divided on it. The reason that warning is there is more because of the company's lawyers than strong scientific consensus.   For the vast majority of people, if SSRIs have a negative result, the most common one will be that they simply don't work and cost them needless money. I'm not trying to dismiss the fringe cases and those who have had their lives genuinely ruined, but rather temper documentaries like this which are bound to trigger the human availability bias and taint clear reasoning with the irrational nature of the human mind.

You don't have to look any further than the list of side effects on any SSRI to know there are extremely dark possible outcomes when taking these drugs. Are CVS and Walgreens unscientific fear mongers for telling their customers that SSRIs could make them homicidal or suicidal? Because they usually put that right on the bottle. Do you think patients shouldn't be given this information?  What exactly is your point here?   These drugs are serious business and I think we have a tendency to idolize doctors as all-knowing authorities in their fields, when any good doctor will tell you that is far from the truth, especially with psychology.  It is more important now than ever for patients to take an active role in their own treatment, to seek multiple scientific opinions, and above all, to educate themselves on their own conditions and the possible courses of treatment. I say all this as a whole hearted believer in psychiatric medicine, and as someone who believes that literally everyone should have a primary care psychiatrist.   Finally, I'd just like to point out that you are the one capitalizing your words and throwing around obscenities, even though your comment contains absolutely no information.

Hell you'll probably find a guy who went mad after taking aspirin or something, you just have to accept meds have side effects and some of those are bad, but thankfully super rare.  Also what these fear mongerers don't always tell you is that it wasn't the medication that caused the problem, but suddenly stopping it. Your are under NO circumstance supposed to stop any antidepressants instantly, you have to reduce the amount little by little. I've taken max 20mg of escitalopram, now I'm taking 10mg.

Your comparison is faulty because it's comparing the the frequency of violence in a sample of people on SSRIs (who have an expectedly high frequency of psychiatric conditions) to the frequency in the general population (who have a much lower frequency of psychiatric conditions). Therefore, you can't get ANY useful information out of this comparison!

So correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't these people who were put on antidepressants and killed their families simply have found the motivation to do so, and therefore not have been be normal at all?"

I think having a strong support system of a therapist and psychiatrist --- both of which you have sessions with --- is required to treat depression/anxiety, and even more important when treating it in tandem with drugs.  Especially in the US, many MDs prescribe SSRIs/Benzos without any of the experience and training that psychiatrists get, which can lead to these kinds of outcomes. Like with any tool, used the wrong way can have devastating consequences.    This would be near impossible to track - but see how many negative outcomes happened when people weren't treated for their mental illness due to fear of/distrust of drugs and treatment."

Documentaries,3c6zhs,b2q,10,Mon Jul 6 04:15:08 2015 UTC,"Here's a 2009 Oxford study about the emotional effects of SSRIs:  http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/195/3/211  The study found that the SSRI caused most participants to experience an 'emotional numbness' that reduced positive emotions along with negative.  Most participants felt less empathy and sympathy.  Some reported self harm and suicidal thoughts due to the SSRI induced emotional numbness and one participant attempted self-harm in an effort to feel emotion.   Most participants described feeling emotionally detached or disconnected, and attributed this to their SSRI antidepressant. Some participants described being detached from their surroundings, and described feelings of being ‘ in limbo’, of ‘unreality’ or ‘ disconnection’ and of feeling as though they were a ‘ spectator’ rather than a participant. Some participants described functioning like a ‘zombie’ or ‘ robot’, with reduced or absent emotional responses. Some participants described feeling detached from their own emotions and instincts. Most participants described that this emotional detachment extended to a detachment from other people. Specifically, they felt reduced sympathy and empathy, and felt detached during social interactions. In particular, many participants described an emotional detachment from their friends and family, including their partner or children. Participants’ attitudes towards emotional detachment from other people were mixed. Although this was often seen as an undesirable side-effect of antidepressants, it was also sometimes seen as beneficial, by allowing disengagement from others’ problems, others’ negative emotions and highly charged situations that would otherwise be upsetting. Just not caring  Almost all participants described not caring about things that used to matter to them and attributed this change to their SSRI antidepressant. They cared less about themselves, about other people and about the consequences of their actions. Not caring could have both helpful and unhelpful consequences, reducing the sense of pressure and stress that some participants felt in their daily lives, yet increasing the likelihood that important tasks were neglected.  Many participants described a general feeling of indifference to things in life that used to matter to them. Many participants described feeling apathetic and unmotivated, despite their illness having improved and attributed this apathy to their antidepressant. Some participants felt that their sensible, safety-conscious, side had diminished and they just did not care as much about the consequences to themselves of their behaviour. As a result, they might behave in a less careful, considered way. A few participants went further, mentioning thoughts of self-harm or suicide that they related, at least in part, to feelings of emotional detachment and emotional numbness. One participant had started to self-harm in an effort to feel emotion. Many participants reported not caring as much about others, such as during social interaction, by being less sensitive or courteous towards other people. In addition, many described reduced concern for others’ feelings, and reduced concern about other peoples’ opinions of them. Some participants described being less concerned or even unable to care about responsibilities in their everyday lives, such as at home, in their finances or at work, and might include, for example, a lack of urgency or need to complete tasks. Changed personality  Some participants felt their personality had changed in some way, or been lost, leaving them ‘like a shell’. In some ways, they were not the person that they used to be. Participants reported that specific aspects of their personality, and, in particular, emotional aspects, had been changed or lost, such that they were a different person. These changes were attributed by participants to their SSRI antidepressant. Some participants believed that at times their antidepressant had made them behave quite out of character. One participant believed that the medication had changed their personality permanently, having a lasting effect beyond finishing their medication."

I haven't watched the documentary yet, but the title is the kind of bullshit that keeps people from getting medications that they desperately need.

I try to kill myself, I get even more depressed and more episodes than usual. My mood goes crazy and I can't focus on anything, I can't enjoy anything. My dick stops working, my brain is foggy.  Eight years.  Eight fucking years until they finally decided to see if it wasn't just regular ol' depression/anxiety.  I hate SSRIs, I've been on multiple.

Documentaries,3c6zhs,Mad_Jester,12,Sun Jul 5 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"Effexor is not an SSRI, it's  an SNRI with some dopamine action at very high doses.  It has some pretty strong dose-dependent effects, too, so for example I have heard of using doses in the 600 mg range to treat Bipolar successfully whereas smaller doses run into the problem you mentioned, the increased mania, which is worst with SSRIs.  Personally I take Effexor 300 mg (because that's as high as my doc will let me go) with remeron and it works decently for me.  I do probably have some kind of cyclical element to my depression, and the manic symptoms are worse on this regimen than they used to be, but not so much that it's unmanageable.  Unfortunately I don't have the luxury of messing with my current regimen; I'd like to try different dosages at the very least.  To be honest though, the hand tremors from the remeron bother me more than the increased mania!  Everyone is different, I've had lots of people tell me they wouldn't be ok with the side effects I live with, but for me the trade off is worth it.  Also, those psychiatrists were insanely irresponsible to push this drug on you.  Not only because of your past experiences which certainly should have been enough, but also because this should never ever be the first antidepressant you try on anyone.  It's got way more unpleasant side effects and by all accounts the absolute worst withdrawal of any antidepressant on the market, so bad that it takes years to wean people off it and even then they frequently wish they were dead for the last few weeks.  It has its place- as a last resort for treatment resistant patients with severe depression.  It really shouldn't be given to anyone else….  ever.  And I say this as someone who is pretty happy with it!  Sadly yours isn't the only story like this I've seen, it seems to be getting very common these days.  And most patients aren't even given any warning about the withdrawal.  It's giving the drug a bad reputation, but really, it's the doctors who should be getting a bad name.  Completely irresponsible practitioners."

I had to begin tapering off the effexor myself via a very sensitive scale and careful measurement (they were capsules, so.) I reduced it about 25mg at a time and I know it's SUPER irresponsible of me to do, but they wouldn't do anything despite my constant requests to be tapered off. Once I had gotten down to 225mg (150 and a 75) I told them what I was doing and they gave me a script so I can properly taper myself off.  Sorry about mixing up SSRIs with SNRIs, however."

She's only 23 but she's seen all of the world she'll ever see. She won't be at family Christmas anymore or see her nieces & nephews born. If they truly aren't allowed to leave the convent ever, she won't even be able to be with her parents when they pass away.   I'm not saying the girls oughtn't become nuns, however. We all must make our own choices and sometimes the right decision hurts. Their dedication to their faith is incredibly admirable and I don't want to understate how amazing those girls must be.

I was also taught that God appreciates action more than words, and would rather you have a good heart and help those in a worse situation then yourself. That is the impression I also got from reading the Bible.   This is essentially what made me lose interest in organised religion, the hypocrisy of it all,  good example being the convents spending 3/4 lives praying, instead of devoting their lives to really help those in need and making an actual difference in someone's life."

In regards to you statement that people spending a majority of their lives praying instead of making an 'actual' difference in someone's lives, if that is how you see it, then I would have to comment that you had and apparently still have an erroneous understanding of the Catholic reality of prayer.

That psychology 101 or business 101 class really paid off. But what relevant ""life experience"" do you have? Have you ever worked or know some one that worked in a Chinese factory? Have you ever even been to China?  Because I have. Both my retired Grandma, late grandpa, and my retired Aunt worked in Guangzhou Second Cigarette Factory on Zhongshan Road, which is about 2-300 miles from Xiaomen, the city where the documentary took place. My mom worked there for about 10 years before emigrating to the US too. Quadruple first account sources, beat that.  Like the documentary, they wore a uniform (pink shirts). Life revolves around the factory since the factory have subsidized apartments (my aunt owns two, one to live, one to rent out), subsidized food (actually better food than EUPA in the documentary, one of their options was an all-you-can-eat buffet), and get this, a ridiculously strong worker's union, including pension.  Everybody treats each other with respect and care. When my granny was hospitalized for diabetes, the factory paid her 10,000RMB (~$1,500USD) as a get-well present along with paying ALL her medical bills. At the time, she was already retired from the company for over 20 years. Name one USA corp that will do that. Not even places like Google is that nice.  Speaking of retirement, my aunt retired a couple of years back at the young age of 50 (genetically speaking, most of the females in the family dies at least well into the late 80 to early 90. She has at least 30 more years of retirement). She's on full company pension,  5,000RMB/month, which is like an entry-level middle management's salary. And that's with her never having a position higher than a group foreman. She spends her free time stress-free learning crafts, swimming, and taking care of my cousin.  Sorry to go nuclear wall of text on you, but does this sound like a grim terrible life to you?  Now, before you call me a paid Chinese shrill, know that, as stated above, my mom emigrated to the USA. I am a bleeding-heart red-white-and-blue patriot that became a US citizen the manly way: paid my dues, took an oral and written exam on US history and current events, and swore an oath to the flag. I didn't just born a citizen like you, I earned it. It's just that I hate when people talk bullshit and call it facts. Sure, there are bad apples like FoxComm, but not all Chinese companies are death sentences. They are still run by humans, employed humans, and socialize like humans.  TL;DR"

Whats the level of curruption and envoirmental damage with mining? Oil & gas?  http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/sector-secteur/species-especes/salmon-saumon-eng.htm  At a Glance Canada is the fourth-largest producer of farmed salmon in the world. Atlantic salmon is Canada’s top aquaculture export, although Chinook and Coho species are also farmed. The United States is Canada’s largest export market for farmed salmon.  Value Farmed salmon had a farm-gate value of $816 million in 2013. The farm-gate value represents a product’s value once it is sold by the producer. British Columbia was the largest salmon producer with a farm-gate value of $475.8 million, followed by New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador with a combined farm-gate value of almost $300 million. Farmed salmon is Canada’s third-largest seafood export by value, the largest agri-food export from British Columbia, and a significant economic contributor to coastal and rural communities on the east and west coasts.  Production In 2013, British Columbia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador produced almost 116,000 tonnes of salmon, representing 95% of total salmon produced in Canada in 2013. British Columbia is the largest salmon producer of salmon with almost 74,700 tonnes or 61% of Canada’s total production.  Canada’s farmed salmon industry provides more than 10,000 jobs, the majority of which are in coastal communities across British Columbia, in New Brunswick’s Bay of Fundy area, and increasingly in Newfoundland and Labrador as well as in Nova Scotia. Farmed salmon operations also provide employment to residents of Aboriginal communities and have played a role in reviving communities located in remote coastal areas of Newfoundland and Labrador.

Just because bread goes for X euro in Germany doesn't mean that it has to go for X euro in your country.

Documentaries,3c88ni,Moody_Immortal_1,3,Mon Jul 13 09:55:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. This was a brilliant short doc. I felt a good amount of rage regarding the DVLA. I actually had a family member with Dementia who was reported to the DVLA, and STILL-they stalled in revoking the license. I hope this documentary will also had a bit of heat to the DVLA to look at this case and stop trying to avoid it. They simply need to do a range of vision test and work with her medical team to be sure they understand."

I have the single eye, not my car. My young optometrist with all the latest equipment and none of the attitude, said to me ""you've got perfectly good vision in one eye. If the license people give you a hard time, you've got my number, I'll straighten them out"". And she did.   People with two eyes close one of them and think people with one eye can't drive because they don't have depth perception, but you and I know you compensate for it. It takes a bit of time, but you don't need two eyes to know which side of the white line to drive on when you're on the road. One side good, other side with oncoming traffic, bad.  In Ontario, on rural two-lane highways, they put ridges in the asphalt so that two-eyed people know there's a stop sign coming up, even though you can see the stop sign. Your tires make a broom pause broom pause broom sound. Some two-eyed person in car asked ""why do they do that when you can clearly see the stop sign"". Without at beat, I told him ""that's so blind drivers know there's a stop sign coming up"". He said, ""that makes sense"". Long pause. ""Wait a sec"".  And besides, eye-patched Israeli Prime Minister, Moshe Dayan, drove his own car and Captain Hook drove his own ship in Neverland. Aside from Peter Pan, nobody gave them a hard time. I was moved, from personal experience, by your story and this film. Good job! I'll give the idiot bearuocrats the number of my optometrist. Cyclops unite!   Your friend, Paul"

Documentaries,3c88ni,birdcatcher,4,Mon Jul 13 09:54:31 2015 UTC,I know this doesn't mean much coming from a random dude on the internet. But I'd totally opt for an eye-patch over an always open and unblinking eye.
Documentaries,3c88ni,tisonlyi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"I have one eye.   Some people rock the prosthetic, others - like me (eye too big, radiation burns on lower lid) - don't for numerous reasons.    I think you're right in this case, but there's a lot of pressure to wear the prosthetics from prostheticists.  I couldn't carry on wearing it because of constant pain and aggravation... But really, they do go on and on and on at you to wear the damn thing, even if it's painful.   Given the unblinking eye and the attendant build up of drying eye juice, I have to feel she'll suffer similarly.   Added: I mostly don't wear anything these days, but I did wear a patch for a few years and had no comments in a few cities I lived in across several countries, but then the current city I'm in... ""Yarr!"" every few minutes walling around the city centre. Asshats."

Documentaries,3c88ni,jdlmama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:56:42 2015 UTC,"I have to say, watching this documentary made me quite angry for her. She has proven herself as a capable driver, takes pride in her job and independence and is clearly no danger on the road.  The fact that they will take her licence away without at least asking her to sit a new driving test even at her own expense (which I am sure she would be willing to do), is appalling.    She's already shown that she can use her vision safely on the road and one of the first things they ask you here in the UK on your driving test is to read a licence plate within a certain distance. She would pass that?   I can understand why she is upset about the situation, because the DVLA have, in effect, robbed her of her own independence and freedom due to a disability she has no control over of having, yet the disability has no effect on the actual practice of her driving!  I think my point is, that in cases like hers, they should be judged each in their own merit. God knows we pay enough for our licences and road tax here.. It needs to change.  On a personal note it took me 6 tries and over £600 to pass my driving test, through nerves (each time I took the test I got more nervous until the examiner gave up and told me to see a doctor because my nerves were getting in the way). I do not test well! (Shaking, sweating trembling, babbling) I was given beta blockers for the day and they worked great and I passed the same day.  I'm a good driver, it's my favourite thing to do, and my car is my pride and joy, but... The fact that I'm on the road and she can't be really bothers me.  Good luck Michelle, I really hope that you get your licence and freedom back. Much love!"

And the staff outnumbers residents 2 to 1.  Interesting that the woman who runs the place explained that all costs are paid by the government though, and that the budget is the same as any other nursing home.  When I saw it I thought it must cost families a fortune to put a parent in a place like that.  In the US it would, but not in the Netherlands I guess."
